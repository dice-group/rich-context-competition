    "reduced_content": "Short and Sweet\nTurbine Blade Illusion\nGeorge Mather and Rob Lee\nSchool of Psychology, University of Lincoln, Lincoln, UK\n Keywords\n3D perception, shapes/objects, scene perception, surfaces/materials\nIn January 2017, wind turbine manufacturer Siemens installed one of its B75 turbine blades\nin Victoria Square, Hull, to mark the start of the city's year as UK City of Culture. The\n`Blade' installation (January 8\u00adMarch 18, 2017) was conceived by artist Nayan Kulkarni.\nThese turbine blades are huge 75-m long fibreglass, balsa wood and resin composite objects,\ncast as a single element, and are claimed to be the world's largest handmade components.\nNayan Kulkarni declared that the act of installation in the square changed the blade from an\nindustrial component into a readymade artwork, in the tradition started in 1913 by Marcel\nDuchamp with his `readymades' which included bicycle wheels, shovels, urinals and bottle\nracks.\nDuchamp considered readymades to be an antidote to `retinal art', to emphasise the\nconceptual qualities of art rather than their purely visual appearance. But the Blade\ncertainly creates a striking visual impression, a metaphorical poke in the eye. Some of this\nimpact must come from its massive scale and its lightness and smoothness, with some\nspecularities, so incongruous against the textures and colours of the ornate Victorian\narchitecture of the square. The local newspaper (Hull Daily Mail, January 9, 2017)\nreported some visitor reactions. One commented that ``It looks like a big tooth. It looks a\nbit odd to be honest.''\nArt critic Adrian Searle (The Guardian, February 5, 2017) declared: ``An elegant, lovely\npiece of engineering, it is somehow diminished by being shorn of its function. It is only big.''\nBut it is more than big. Something else seems to be at work too, at least to the eyes of\nvision scientists. At first sight, the initial media photographs of the installation seemed to be\nclumsy fakes. The blade appears to be a cylindrical object, strangely out-of-keeping with the\nCorresponding author:\nGeorge Mather, University of Lincoln, Brayford Pool, Lincoln LN6 7TS, UK.\nEmail: gmather@lincoln.ac.uk\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sage-\npub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\ni-Perception\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ipe\nFigure 1. Three photographs of the `Blade' installation in Victoria Square, Hull, UK. In the top two\nphotographs, the blade appears to be cylindrical, and its lighting seems out of place with the daylight\nilluminating the rest of the scene. In the bottom photograph, the actual S-shaped profile of the blade is\nmore apparent.\n2 i-Perception\nlocal environment, lit differently, as though it was superimposed on the scene digitally (see\ntop two photographs in Figure 1), but the blade really was there. So what is going on in the\nphotographs?\nCloser inspection on-site (bottom photograph in Figure 1) reveals that one side of the\nblade is indeed convex and approximately cylindrical. But the profile of the other side is more\ncomplex, with both a convexity and a concavity (as shown in Figure 2). The blade's cross-\nsection is that of a wing, unsurprising given that its function is to generate lift which causes\nthe turbine to spin. The blade's leading edge is rounded while its trailing edge tapers to a\nsharp point. The blade had been installed in the square with its leading edge facing the\nground and the sharper trailing edge pointing skyward. The photographs actually show\nthe side which is both convex and concave (right side in Figure 2); yet, the entire face\nappears to be convex, and this seems to be the source of the blade's paradoxical appearance.\nWhen illuminated by overhead daylight, the lower part of the blade, close to the rounded\nleading edge is in shadow. The upper part of blade below the trailing edge is also in shadow\ndue to the concave profile. The middle part of the blade receives daylight and appears lighter.\nThe pattern of light and shade across the side of the blade is ambiguous of course. It could be\ncaused by a convex surface, or a more complex combination of concave and convex\ncurvature. The surface curvature we perceive relies on unconscious assumptions or `priors'\nabout natural visual objects and scenes, which are integrated with incoming sensory data\n(Kersten, Mamassian, & Yuille, 2004). Two priors seem to be operating in the scene. The first\nFigure 2. Diagram illustrating the cross-section of a turbine blade such as that shown in Figure 1. The\ncross-section is that of a wing, with a rounded leading edge (bottom) and a trailing edge which tapers down\nslightly to impart lift (top). The photographs in Figure 1 show the righthand side of the blade as depicted in\nthe cross-section.\nMather and Lee 3\nassumption is that objects tend to be convex rather than concave (Langer & Bu\n\u00a8 lthoff,\n2001), so the local evidence provided by the blade's shading is interpreted in terms of a\ncylindrical shape lit from the front (Kleffner & Ramachandran, 1998), and specular\nreflections reinforce this interpretation (Adams & Elder, 2014). The second assumption is\nthat the most likely direction of the global light source is overhead (Mamassian & Goutcher,\n2001). So there is an inconsistency between the blade and the rest of the scene in terms\nof apparent light source direction, subtly reinforcing the visual impression that the blade is\nout-of-place.\nAs a test of this account of the blade's appearance, we created virtual versions of\nthe convex (C-shaped) profile and the more complex (S-shaped) profiles, lit either from\nabove or from the front. Figure 3 shows these two profiles. The left-hand images depict\nthe C-shape; the right-hand images depict the S-shape. The top pair of images is lit from\nabove and the bottom pair of images is lit from the front. Notice that, as expected on the\nbasis of the blade's appearance, the bottom-left (C-shape) and top-right (S-shape) images\nappear similarly cylindrical and lit from the front, though the former is lit from the front and\nthe latter is lit from above. The inset figures show oblique views, which are included in\nfly-around animations in supplementary materials. Marlow and Anderson (2016) recently\ninvestigated ambiguities in the apparent shape of 3D surfaces defined solely by luminance\ngradients, and showed that the addition of motion or texture information can disambiguate\nsurface shapes similar to those we used. So the illusion we describe depends on keeping the\nblade very clean.\nFigure 3. Synthetic images created using BlenderTM, showing a C-shaped object (left) and S-shaped object\n(right) illuminated either from above (upper row) or from the front (lower row). The lightness profile of the\nfront-lit C-shaped object (bottom left) is similar to that of the top-lit S-shaped object. Both objects appear to\nbe cylindrical, approximately reproducing the appearance of the blade in the photographs of Figure 1.\n4 i-Perception\n"
