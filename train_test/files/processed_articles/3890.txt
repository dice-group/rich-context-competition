This study explored the relationships between cultural\nattitudes and eating behaviors of young adult African American men and women. Endorsing a strong orientation on\nvarious dimensions of African American culture were related to less dieting, bulimic, and anorexic behaviors and\nattitudes. This study extended our knowledge of the ways in which cultural attitudes were related to the physical and\nmental health of African Americans and recognized the significance of individual differences within this group.\n",

Culture is entwined in\na person's daily actions and is consequently a key factor in\nthe meaning of food and eating. This study will examine\nthe relationship between cultural orientation and eating\nbehaviors of African American men and women.\nAfrican American cultural attitudes\nJones (2003) posits that African American culture has a\nunique worldview that reflects the attitudes, cognitions,\nvalues, and behaviors of African American experiences in\nfive dimensions: time, rhythm, improvisation, orality, and\nspirituality (TRIOS). TRIOS, as a theory, is a way to under-\nstand the psychological and cultural resources that helped\nAfricans in America to survive and be resilient to racial\nThese coping mechanisms became cultural patterns,\nwhich in turn were passed onto the next generation of\nAfrican Americans. Jones (2003) has developed a scale\noperationalizing the TRIOS dimensions, and African\nAmericans score significantly higher than, or as high as,\nany other ethnic group on all five TRIOS dimensions in a\ntest of validity. High levels of TRIOS are associated with\ngreater psychological well-being in the African American\npopulation (Jones, 2003). This broad and comprehensive\ntheory of cultural orientation for African Americans aids in\nour understanding of African American eating behaviors.\nThe current research\nThere are several limitations in the extant literature on the\nrelationship between culture and eating among African\nAmericans. One limitation is that the majority of studies on\nthis topic have failed to examine how specific elements of\nAfrican American culture may be associated with eating\ntion is that research on African American culture and eating\nbehaviors is still lacking a comprehensive measure of\nEating behaviors and related cultural\nattitudes of African American men\nand women\nChristina Oney1, Daniel DePaulo1, Rebecca Lewis2\nand Robert Sellers2\n Keywords\nAfrican Americans, cultural orientation, eating disorder behaviors, gender\n1City University of New York, USA\n2University of Michigan, USA\nCorresponding author:\nChristina Oney, Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC),\nCity University of New York, Room N651D, 199 Chambers Street,\nEmail: coney@bmcc.cuny.edu\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \ncultural orientation (Henrickson et al., 2010). While it is\nimportant to understand the relationship between eating\nbehaviors and other proxy measures such as racial and eth-\nnic identity, these measures may discount the richness of\nculture (Harris and Kuba, 1997). The final limitation is that\nprevious research on this topic has been mainly compara-\ntive in nature. Comparative research fails to recognize and\nexplain individual personality differences within African\nAmericans.\nThis study addresses these limitations in the existing lit-\nerature by investigating whether cultural orientation is\nrelated to eating behaviors for African American men and\nwomen. We are defining eating behaviors as dieting,\nbulimic behaviors, and oral control (exercising control of\nover eating or anorexia). This study will focus on the con-\ncepts of time, rhythm, improvisation, orality, and spiritual-\nity from the TRIOS measure.\nHypotheses\nFirst, we expect time orientation to be related to dieting\n(hypothesis 1). According to TRIOS, time relates to one's\nown personal perspective on the past and future. For past\norientation, time has no independent value; time is not the\ndriver, or the determiner. On the other hand, future orienta-\ntion attributes great significance to the concept of time. Past\norientation is more reflective of traditional African cultural\nsystems which value connecting with ancestors and history\n(Jones, 2003). In contrast, future orientation is more preva-\nlent in Western culture. In Western culture, a future orienta-\ntion is coupled with individualistic and goal-oriented\nattitudes (Kelley and Worthley, 1981). Previous research\nhas found that African Americans are more past-oriented\nand that European Americans are more future-oriented;\nthese differences in temporal orientation have been related\nto health outcomes and health management (Brown and\nIn future orientation, behaviors, including eating, are\nmore regimented. In past orientation, behaviors, including\neating, are more organic and less tied to prescribed, exter-\nnal sources (Mbiti, 1990). Dieting is related to a focus on\nthe future; if a person struggles in the moment they will be\nrewarded in the future with a thin body. Past orientation\nmay be related to enjoying the eating experience with less\nconcern for future consequences, such as weight gain.\nPresent orientation may also view food as a means of con-\nnecting with African or African American culture and his-\ntory, and those who endorse this view of time may derive\nmore enjoyment and purpose from food. We predict that a\nstrong past temporal orientation will predict less dieting\nbehaviors as these behaviors are related to the future conse-\nquences of food and eating.\nSecond, we expect improvisation orientation to be\nrelated to bulimia (hypothesis 2). Improvisation is one's\nability to creatively solve problems and adapt to overcome\nbarriers. Improvisation also reflects personal expression\nand style. African American culture fosters an improvisa-\ntional orientation, which has been hypothesized to be\nrelated to attitudes about appearance and the body for\nwomen (Lovejoy, 2001). Improvisation is linked to a\ngreater appreciation of creative style rather than a fixation\non rigid standards of physical appearance (Lovejoy, 2001).\nRacial differences in standards of appearance and the body\nhave been hypothesized to be related to African Americans\nhaving more fluid and flexible notions regarding standards\nof beauty and also less emphasis on external appearance\n(Lovejoy, 2001). Less restrictive standards of appearance\nare related to less eating behaviors (Hewitt et al., 1995).\nTherefore, we expect greater improvisation orientation to\nbe related to less bulimia.\nThird, we expect people who score high on improvisa-\ntion to show less restrictive eating (oral control) (hypothe-\nsis 3). In addition to being able to meet the challenges of\neveryday life, improvisation includes optimism about the\nfuture (Jones, 2003). We hypothesize that people who feel\ncapable of overcoming the obstacles that life throws at\nthem will be less afraid of the possible negative conse-\nquences of eating and therefore less likely to show restric-\ntive eating patterns.\nFourth, we do not expect a significant gender differ-\nences in eating disorder symptomatology nor cultural ori-\nentation. Recent studies examining the relationship between\nmen and maladaptive eating behaviors suggests that while\nthe gender imbalance still exists, the differences in eating\ndisorder diagnoses between men and women may not be as\ngreat as previous literature has reported (Anderson and\nBulik, 2004). Further research suggests that this gender dif-\nference is even smaller in the African American community\n(Croll et al., 2002). Gender differences inAfricanAmerican\nculture have not been empirically measured. We have no\nreason to hypothesize a specific difference for African\nAmerican men and women.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThese data were collected as part of a study examining\nAfrican American college students' daily experiences. In\nTotal, 439 self-identified African American second- and\nthird-year undergraduate students were recruited from three\nstandard deviation (SD)=.95years). The students were\nrecruited from three universities: a large public university\nin the Midwest that is predominantly European American\n(n=159); a large public university in the Southeast that is\nalso predominantly European American (n=151); and a\nmedium-size private university on the East Coast that is\nhistorically African American (n=129). The mean income\nOney et al. 3\nof the participant's parents ranged between US$55,000 and\nUS$64,999, while individual incomes ranged from less\nProcedure\nTwo procedures were employed to recruit participants for\nthis study. The office of the registrar at the two predomi-\nnantly European American universities provided contact\ninformation for all students who self-identified as African\nAmerican on their admissions applications. We used this\ninformation to recruit students via email and telephone\nsolicitations. At the historically African American univer-\nsity, researchers relied on campus-wide outreach methods\nincluding fliers, word of mouth advertising, and classroom\nannouncements. At all three institutions, researchers asked\npotential participants screening questions to ensure that\nthey self-identified as African American and were at least\nyears of age. If students answered affirmative to those\nquestions, they were asked to participate in a study examin-\ning African American student's daily experiences pertain-\ning to race. The students then scheduled a time to come to a\nlaboratory space to complete a web-based survey within\nweeks of initial contact. Participants completed instru-\nments assessing racial identity, psychological well-being,\nracial experiences, cultural orientation, and demographics.\nParticipants were paid US$15.\nMeasures\nEating behaviors.Eating patterns were assessed using the\nassess eating disorder symptomatology (Garner et al., 1982).\nThis scale has been used in nonclinical samples as a con-\ntinuous variable, due to the low base rate of clinical eating\nbehaviors found in the general population (Mazzeo, 1999;\na continuous measure ranging from 1 (never) to 6 (always).\nThis scale contains three subscales: dieting (13 items;\n=.90), bulimic tendencies (6 items; =.71), and oral con-\nscale evaluated perceptions of body image, nutritional\nattitudes, and eating habits. A sample item is \"I am preoc-\ncupied with the desire to be thinner.\" The bulimia subscale\nassesses binging and purging behaviors. A sample item is \"I\nhave gone on eating binges where I felt that I may not be\nable to stop.\" The oral control subscale evaluates a person's\nattempts to exercise control over the circumstances of eating\nand is similar to anorexia nervosa symptomatology. A sam-\nple item is \"I avoid eating when I am, hungry.\" A higher\nscore on any of the three subscales means a greater endorse-\nment of those attitudes or behaviors. Participants' scale\nscores were calculated by averaging across the items to\nwhich the participant responded, which allowed for the use\nof the response anchors to interpret the scale scores.\nCultural orientation.For this study, we used Jones's TRIOS\nscale, a 28-item measure of dimensions of African American\ncultural identity. The five dimensions of African American\nculture give TRIOS its name: time, rhythm, improvisation,\norality, and spirituality (Jones, 2003). Participants use a scale\nranging from -3 (very untrue) to 3 (very true) to rate the\nextent to which they agreed with each item. The time sub-\nscale (six items; \n=\n.70) measures the strength of personal\npresent\u00adpast orientation (as opposed to future orientation), as\nthis has been a historical tenet in African cultural systems\n(Jones, 2003). A sample item is \"Preparing for what might\nhappened in the future is often a waste of time.\" The rhythm\nsubscale (five items; \n=\n.71) measures the strength of the\ninternal responses to the rhythmic patterns found in the\nexternal world (Jones, 2003).Asample item is \"I have a flow\nto my life that connects me with my environment.\" The\nimprovisation subscale (seven items; =.79) examines the\nextent to which a person uses goal-directed creative problem\nsolving as a means of control and structure in interactions\nwith others (Jones, 2003). A sample item is \"When a situa-\ntion arises, I usually know 2 to 3 different ways to handle it.\"\nThe orality subscale (three items; =.80) measures the pref-\nerences for oral face-to-face communication and personal\nexpression and endorses the meaningful role of spoken\nwords in human affairs. A sample item is \"In my social\ngroup, laughter often holds us together.\" The spirituality sub-\nscale (seven items; \n=\n.92) accesses the degree to which a\nperson believes in the value of a higher power and unknown\nforces that influence all living things and one's life in par-\nticular (Jones, 2003). A sample item is \"In most aspects of\nmy life, I am strengthened by my spiritual beliefs.\" For each\nsubscale, higher scores corresponded with a greater strength\nin the endorsement of that cultural ideology. Participants'\nscale scores were calculated by averaging across the items to\nwhich the participant responded, thus allowing for the use of\nthe response anchors to interpret the scale scores.\nBody mass index. Participants self-reported their height and\nweight which were converted into a body mass index (BMI:\nweight in kg/height in m2) score. A BMI of 25 is the thresh-\nold for the overweight category according for the Center\nfor Disease Control, while 30 is the threshold for obesity\n(Flegal et al., 1998). However, it should be noted that there\nis some controversy about the classification of weight sta-\ntus using BMI for African Americans (Deurenberg and\nResults\nThe means and SDs for all measures are presented in Table 1.\nOverall, participants showed a past-time orientation (a nega-\ntive TRIOS-TIME score), strong spiritual beliefs (a high\nTRIOS-SPIRIT score), a preference for humor and storytell-\ning (a high TRIOS-ORAL score), an ability to adapt to chal-\nlenging situations (a high TRIOS-IMPROV score), and an\n4 Health Psychology Open \nappreciation of the role of music and rhythm in shaping eve-\nryday living (a high TRIOS-RHYTHM score).\nThe eating disorder scores from the EAT-26 (Table 1)\nwere significantly lower than those reported by majority\nEuropean American women samples (Mazzeo, 1999; Sabik\norder scores were also slightly lower than a sample of all\nAfrican American women (Akan and Grilo, 1994). The\nticipant was classified as overweight.\nThe correlations (presented in Table 1) indicate that cul-\ntural orientation (TRIOS) was negatively correlated with\ndisordered eating behaviors and attitudes. The exception\nwas time orientation, which was negatively related to diet-\ning, but unrelated to bulimia and oral control. These results\nindicate that stronger African American cultural orienta-\ntions are associated with less eating disordered behaviors\nand attitudes of dieting, bulimia, and oral control.\nCultural identity as a predictor of eating\nbehaviors\nHypothesis 1 was supported with additional results.\nMultiple regression was used to determine the impact of\nScreening of the data demonstrated linearity, the absence of\nmulticollinearity, a lack of univariate and multivariate out-\nliers, and homoscedasticity of residuals.

As predicted,\nmean gender differences in study variables were examined\nin the analysis presented in Table 5. There were no gender\ndifferences in any of the disordered eating variables.\nHowever, contrary to our hypothesis, there were gender dif-\nferences with regard to time, spirituality, and improvisa-\ntion. Men were more likely to be of a present orientation,\nwomen were more likely to be spiritually oriented, and men\nwere more likely to display improvisation.\nDiscussion\nTime orientation was related to dieting forAfricanAmerican\nmen and women. The greater endorsement of future orienta-\ntion (as opposed to past orientation) was related to more\ndieting. In a future orientation, food may be viewed as a\nmeans to an end. For instance, if a person aims to maintain\nor achieve a culturally desired thin body size, eating may be\nviewed as a means to achieve that goal. This relationship\nsupports the notion that if a person uses discipline and self-\ncontrol through restriction of food, there will be benefits or\na pay-off in the future when they obtain their desired body.\nHigh levels of improvisation orientation were related\nto less bulimic behaviors. This may suggest that the use of\ncreative problem solving in the face of stress may be a key\nfactor in this relationship. A person with high improvisation\nTable 3.

Binge eating demonstrates a loss\nof control where purging demonstrates a maladaptive coping\nmethod to regain control. Improvisation also endorses per-\nsonal expressiveness or style. Perhaps African Americans\nendorse more fluid notions of beauty, which means standards\nare not rigid or fixed by restrictive standards of body size/\nshape rather style, attitude, and other characteristics can make\nsomeone attractive or beautiful as well (Parker et al., 1995).\nAs hypothesized, we found that improvisation is related\nto lower levels of maladaptive food control (oral control).\nUsing food to regulate mood is a maladaptive coping mech-\nanism that can contribute to the development of maladap-\ntive eating behaviors (Sims et al., 2008). Perceived stress is\ncommonly linked to binge eating episodes which can lead\nto increased obesity and long-term health risks (Ng and\nJeffery, 2003). However, stress can also contribute to a\ndesire to restrict eating. Ruggiero et al. (2008) have shown\nthat high levels of stress are linked to an increased drive for\nthinness and more body dissatisfaction. High levels of\nimprovisation are linked to more active coping mechanisms\nand less reliance on manipulating food intake when dealing\nwith stressful situations. African Americans who show\nhigher levels of improvisation are more optimistic and\nengage in more effective problem solving. These individuals\nfeel a sense of control no matter what is going wrong with\ntheir lives and this may allow them to maintain healthier\neating patterns.\nA strong spiritual orientation was related to less bulimic\nbehaviors, a relationship that was not originally hypothe-\nsized. Richards et al. (2007) have previously shown that\nattending to a patient's spiritual growth may significantly\nreduce eating disorder symptoms when used as part of a\ncomprehensive treatment plan. Jacobs-Pilipski et al. (2005)\nfound that college women who rated spirituality as impor-\ntant were significantly more likely to use their spiritual\nbeliefs and practices (i.e. praying, meditating, reading spir-\nitual/religious texts) as a way to cope with distress related to\neating. This study suggests that the use of spiritual beliefs\nand practices as coping mechanisms for distress related to\neating could help prevent the development of maladaptive\neating behaviors for both men and women. Greater belief in\na higher power may also be related to respecting and accept-\ning the body in its natural form and thus less likely to abuse\none's body by binging, purging, or pills.\nSpirituality can be expressed in many ways including\nthrough organized religion. In Christianity, one's body is\nconceptualized as the temple of the Holy Spirit (Parker\net al., 1995). The body has greater significance than its out-\nward appearance; instead, it is a vehicle to do God's will.\nTherefore, harming one's body through starvation, binging,\nand purging, or eating excessively could be perceived as\ncontrary to God's will. In the African American community,\nthe church is a safe haven and a source of social support. It\nis also a place where a person can find comfort and display\ntheir own sense of style and these expressions will be appre-\nPrevious research on eating behaviors and spirituality\nhas focused on how spirituality can be used in the treatment\nof disordered eating behaviors (Emmett, 2007). Spirituality\nhas been shown to have a positive effect on African\nAmericans' physical health and psychological well-being\nBowen-Reid and Smalls, 2004). This study builds on this\nbody of literature for African American populations.\nThis study found no gender difference in dieting,\nbulimia, and oral control. This is consistent with previous\nresearch which suggests gender differences of eating pat-\nterns are not as large in the African American community\ncompared to the European American community (Croll\net al., 2002). These results were contrary to a previous\nstudy (Taylor et al., 2007), which found that African\nAmerican women suffer from disordered eating behaviors\nat a higher rate than men.\nContrary to our hypotheses, there were gender differences\nin three dimensions of cultural orientation. Men were more\npast-oriented in our study although previous research has\nbeen mixed about gender differences in time orientation\nspiritually oriented; this finding is expected since women\nare often viewed as the bearers of culture within a family.\nSpirituality is more central to African American culture\n(Jones, 2003) and spirituality may hold a special meaning for\nAfricanAmerican women as the church is often an institution\nto transmit culture (Lincoln and Mamiya, 1990). In addition,\nthe African American church is often a place of female lead-\nership and predominant female membership. Finally, men\nshowed higher levels of improvisation. This may be due to\nthe higher levels of collective coping shown in African\nAmerican men (Lewis-Coles and Constantine, 2006).\nImplications of findings\nThis study highlighted the importance of culture, not gen-\nder in eating behaviors. This is contrary to previous research\nwhich suggests the gender is a strong predictor of maladap-\ntive eating patterns in the majority of European American\nsamples (Lewinsohn et al., 2002). Our results also reveal\nthe possible role of effective problem solving and coping\nskills in relation to eating behaviors (Lobera et al., 2009).\nBoth improvisation and spirituality have components of\nthese skills, which may be the driving force in their rela-\ntionship to eating behaviors.\nAfrican American culture is related to less maladaptive\neating behaviors, but not necessarily related to healthy eat-\ning. Results of this study suggest that African American cul-\nture may reject the thin ideal but may be linked to higher\nlevels of obesity. Conventional weight-loss methods are\noften regimented in nature and may be related to cultural\nOney et al. 7\norientation. Promotion of intuitive eating, which is more\naligned with African American cultural orientation may be\nmore effective in achieving effective and long lasting weight\nloss.\nLimitations\nThis study was limited to a college-aged population and\nthus might not be representative of the majority of African\nAmericans. In addition, there may also be a cohort effect\ndepending on cultural attitudes and orientation. Also, this\nstudy could potentially determine the basis for a causal\nrelationship between cultural orientation and eating behav-\niors. However, future longitudinal research would be\nneeded to establish the exact nature of this relationship.\nFinally, other factors related to eating behaviors, such as\nphysical activity levels, were not included in this study.\nConclusion\nThis study highlights the significance of cultural attitudes\nin-group comparisons and clarifies previous research which\nsuggests African Americans are uniformly protected against\nmaladaptive eating behaviors. Instead, the study demon-\nstrated that spirituality, improvisation, and time orientations\nare specific aspects of African American culture which are\nsignificantly related to less eating disordered behaviors.\nIdentifying these aspects of culture in African Americans\ncan be used to plan more efficacious treatments as well as\naiding in the prevention of maladaptive eating behaviors.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAkan GE and Grilo CM (1994) Sociocultural influences on eat-\ning attitudes and behaviors, body image, and psychological\nfunctioning: A comparison of African-American, Asian-\nAmerican and Caucasian college women.
