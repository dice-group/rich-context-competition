    "abstract": "Abstract\nA 10-question Likert-type scale survey was presented to parents of children enrolled in the Imagination Library's (IL)\nprogram. IL sends age-appropriate books once a month to children from birth to age 5 so that their parent can read to\nthem. After registering for the program and receiving books, 93 parents answered the survey questions electronically. The\nquestions noted the difference in family literacy behavior after receiving the books. Nine of the questions were multiple-\nchoice whereas the last question was open-ended. This third-year survey was compared with the earlier surveys to establish\nreliability and used repeated questions to establish validity. The respondents were drawn from a rural minority population\nin an economically depressed area. The survey results suggested that parents spend more time reading to their children\nregularly after enrolling in the program. The percentage of parents who read to their children more than once a day rose\nfrom 24% to 43%. According to the survey, 48% of parents reported that their child was much more interested in reading.\nMore than half of the parents (67%) reported that their child asked more frequently for books to be read to them after\nenrolling in the program. In addition, 68% of the families reported that multiple members of the family were engaged with\nthe reading activities. Families report that reading the books had been a positive experience for their children and had helped\n70% with vocabulary development and 66% with listening skills.\n",

(Evans, Kelly,\nSfkora, & Trefman, 2010). In addition, the study found that\n\"children of lesser educated parents benefited the most from\nhaving books in the home\" (University of Nevada, Reno,\n2010, p. 1). Students with books in the home tended to aver-\nage 3 years longer attendance in school. \"While the ideal\nhome library size was 500 books, students with as few as\ntwenty books showed a marked increase in reading achieve-\nhome, a child reached a higher level of education.According\nto the Evans (2010) study, with each new book added, the\nchild gained academically.\nThe Imagination Library's (IL) purpose is to increase the\nnumber of books in the home while also increasing the\namount of time that children are exposed to quality books.As\na function of assessing the success of this effort, a survey was\nsent to the parents of those students receiving IL books in the\nmail each month.\nThe participants being investigated in this study are\ndrawn from 1,129 registered families who have received\nbooks monthly for the past 26 months. The age-appropriate\ntitles are chosen by the IL based on multicultural stories,\naward-winning literature, and artwork.

School-age students from third grade to sixth\ngenerally add new word meanings at about the same rate\nacross vocabulary levels according to Biemiller and Slonim's\nstudy (2001). The problem is the huge gap in vocabulary lev-\nels with beginning Kindergarteners. \"In the preliterate\nperiod, children come to differ by several thousand root-\nword meanings. This is a gap that is too often not closed in\nlater years. Hence, we must find ways of supporting vocabu-\nlary acquisition during the preliterate period\" (Biemiller,\nBy listening to stories, young children develop an under-\nstanding of decontextualized vocabulary, which is composed\nof words that express ideas other than the here-and-now.\nYoung children develop new vocabulary by inferring word\nmeanings from the context of the story. Storybook language\nis often more formal than spoken language and offers a word\nchoice variety that might not be found in day-to-day speech\npatterns. \"A strong relationship has been found between\nexperience with books during early years and language\nstories regularly, children develop story sense, or the under-\nstanding of the organization of narrative discourse. They\nlearn that stories have a problem and a solution with a begin-\nning, middle, and end. With exposure to stories, children\nunderstand what format to expect. Therefore, they are able to\ndevote their attention to the story and they are able to antici-\npate and predict the story sequence automatically. Experience\nwith stories builds background knowledge and helps chil-\ndren to sort new information into similar groupings. \"This\nhelps children recall information, access it, and connect it to\nincoming information. Stein and Glenn (1979) found that\nwell-read-to children internalized a form of story grammar\nwhich aided in understanding and retelling simple stories\"\nReading to young children provides more benefit than just\ndeveloping vocabulary. Phonological awareness is also devel-\noped from listening to stories. The child becomes aware of\ndifferent sounds of the language and matches them to letters.\nStory books offer linguistic games, rhymes, and jingles to help\nchildren become aware of letters and words. According to the\nstudy of 1,171 first graders and their parents from 19 schools\nin Rogaland County, Norway, a significant difference in school\nachievement was attributed to reading to children before they\nattended school. This study found that the parents' own moti-\nvations to read also influenced the child's reading skills. A\nbook in the hands of the parents advertises the value of read-\ning. The Norwegian study concluded that home reading envi-\nronment is crucial for developing children's reading skills\nIf children arrived at Kindergarten ready to read, with\nwell-developed print concepts and book handling skills,\nwould this help them launch into a successful journey with\nliteracy? If they have parents who value literacy and actively\nengage in reading regularly, would this factor influence their\nschool success? For years, researchers suggested that these\nfactors play an important role in literacy development (Elley,\nAccording to the national 2012 Scholastic survey, about\nhalf of parents feel their children do not spend enough time\nreading books for fun. The IL books encourage families to\nspend more time reading books for entertainment. With the\npurpose of supporting emergent reading skills, it sends free\nbooks in the mail to families who register to be a part of the\nprogram. \"Over the last 10 years, the IL grew from one\nsmall county in east Tennessee to being supported locally\nin almost 2,000 communities in three countries\" (http://\nusa.imaginationlibrary.com/program_replication.php#.\nUaUG7thjGrk).\nPopulation\nThe Southwest New Mexico area served by this project is\nrural, with 7.4 people per square mile having an average per-\ncapita annual income of US$21,726. Sixty percent of the\npopulation is below the poverty level, and 48.3% identify\nthemselves as having Latino origins. Therefore, rural pov-\nerty is the pervasive element of this minority population,\nwith 6% of the population composed of children under the\nage of 5. This population has been receptive to free books\nwhich arrive in the mail, and which can be shared with small\nchildren. Over two thirds of the homes with preschoolers\nmonths.\nPurpose of the Program and the Study\nThis question emerged during the assessment of the pro-\ngram: Would receiving books in the mail increase the time\nparents report reading to young children? To answer this\nquestion and to measure the effectiveness of the program,\na 10-question Parent Satisfaction Survey was emailed to\nTable 1. This third-year survey was compared with the ear-\nlier surveys to establish validity and reliability. Ninety-\nthree participants responded, which represents a 20%\nreturn rate. The survey questioned the change in family\nliteracy practices as a result of the availability of conve-\nnient picture books at no expense to the parents. These spe-\ncific questions were asked: How often did you read to your\nchild before and after receiving books from IL? Since\nreceiving books from IL, how often does your child ask to\nbe read to? Has receiving books from the IL made your\nchild more interested in books? What impact has participa-\ntion in the IL had on your child?

(You may be anony-\nmously quoted in our communications with the press and\nothers). Here are some sample responses: 1. Thank you for\nthe program. 2. This is a great program, I just wished it was\navailable in more areas. I tried to recommend it to a friend in\nIdaho, but they couldnot get them there because there was no\nsponsor. 3. This is a fantastic program. My daughter looks\nforward to the book in the mail each month.\nMaterials and Procedures\nThe Likert-type scale method used in this study is a familiar\ninstrument used to measure responses. It facilitates data\ncoding and analysis (Li, 2012). This Likert-type scale sur-\nvey was written by the local ILAdvisory Board, which con-\nsisted of professors of education, administrators, and\nparents. The survey was based on a time-tested template,\nused nationally by the IL, which originated in the National\nCenter for Education Statistics about reading frequency and\nbehavior. The research center purports \"that based on aca-\ndemic literature, the best way to assess family reading\nbehavior is through surveying parents\" (Ridzi, Sylvia, &\nOpen coding and theme-based concept style was used to\nanalyze the data. A qualified survey was used which analyzes\nfrequencies in the number of characteristics in a population;\nthe open-ended comments question used coding suggested\nrecipients). A 27% response rate with an n = 93 was pro-\nduced. The survey was sent to email addresses that were pro-\nvided using MailChimp and SurveyMonkey and the\nDollywood Foundation's secure database. All book recipi-\nents were invited to participate in the survey. This is the third\nannual survey, so ineffective questions have been removed\nand new questions have been added. Trends in the annual\nsurvey responses suggest that the survey is valid and reliable.\nA reliability of r = .91 was established from surveys taken\nover a 3-year period. Validity from repeated questions on the\nNine survey questions had multiple-choice responses.\nThe Likert-type scale was used to report these responses. The\nmedian was used for analyzing the data from the Likert-type\nscale (McLeod, 2008). A number was assigned to each\nresponse and this number was multiplied by the frequency of\nresponses to arrive at a weighted score for each answer. An\naverage of the weighted scores was arrived at by dividing the\ntotal weighted score by the number of responses. This num-\nber was used to decide the common factor most respondents\nreported. The descriptive percentage of each response was\nalso reported.\nExport\nCustomize\nDo you and your child check out books from any community\nlibraries?\nAnswer choices Responses\nWhat differences have you noticed in your child who is\nparticipating in the Imagination Library?

(If they do, please use the\n\"Other\" field to tell us approximately how many titles you\nhave.)\nAnswer choices Responses\nA comment section was added where parents could men-\ntion additional information concerning the question. These\nresponses were coded into five categories (Jansen, 2010).\nFirst, they were divided into positive and negative com-\nments. The positive responses were subsequently sorted into\ntopics: Multiple children benefited from the books, bonding\noccurred within the family, titles were interesting, and infants\nwere included in literacy time.\nLimitations of the Study\nThe study was limited to self-reporting of the time parents\nspent reading to their children. The danger in self-reporting\nsurveys is the tendency to overinflate responses. A compari-\nson group of self-reporting parents who did not participate in\nthe program was not acquired. In addition, the parents who\nhad limited access to computers may not have been able to\nrespond electronically to the survey and their responses were\nnot recorded.\nResults\nThe Likert-type scale analysis of Question 1, \"How often did\nyou read to your child before receiving books from the IL?\"\nrevealed that before entering the program, the average family\nread to their child only 3 or 4 times a week (M = 3.4). A quar-\nter (24%) of the parents read to their child once a day while\nanother quarter read more than once a day. Those parents\nreading \"not at all\" to their child was 4%.\nAfter entering the program, the average family read to\ntheir child once a day (M = 4.21) according to the results of\nQuestion 2: \"How often did you read to your child after\nreceiving books from the IL?\" The number of parents who\nread more than once a day increased from 24% to 43% and\nthe parents who read not at all shrank from 2% to 0.\nBy interpreting the results of Questions 1 and 2, a marked\nchange in family literacy behavior is noted. These results\nwere consistent with the previous year's survey results,\nwhich reported that daily reading rose from 46% to 78%,\nwhile the parents who seldom read to their children dropped\nfrom 9.3 to 0. In both years, the percentage of parents who\nread more than once a day almost doubled. The value of this\nchange in behavior is validated by the National Association\nfor the Education of Young Children which advises that chil-\ndren be read to every day for 20 min. By the age of 5, the\nchild will have listened to stories for 600 hr. This activity\narms children with a vocabulary and a depth of background\nknowledge that prepares them for success in school.\nThe average family reported that their child asked to be\nread to more often after entering the program, according to\nthe results of the Likert-type scale analysis of Question 3 (M\n= 2.63): \"Since you enrolled in the program, how often does\nyour child ask to be read to?\" This question demonstrates the\nconnection between the exposure to books and the motiva-\ntion for reading them. The bonding that occurs during\nread-aloud time makes reading a comforting experience. The\nsurvey suggests that more than 67% of the children were\nmotivated to request the reading experience since they have\nbeen enrolled in the program. Other school-related benefits\nare derived from motivation to read. Children understand\nreading, have developed concepts of print, and can quiet\nthemselves and direct their attention to listen to a story.\nAn increased interest in reading books was also recorded\nby Question 4: \"Has receiving books from the IL made your\nchild more interested in books?\" The results of the Likert-\ntype scale analysis (M = 1.1) demonstrated that most families\nreported that their child was more interested in reading after\nentering the program. Almost half (47%) of children were\nreported to have more interest in reading. Both Questions 4\nand 5 \"What impact has participation in the IL had on your\nchildren?\" focus on the motivation to read and the bonding\nprocess. Both responses show that family time spent sharing\nbooks had a positive impact on the family.\nQuestion 6, \"Are other members of the family benefiting\nfrom having IL books in the home?\" asked about the number\nof family members who read the IL books. The construct\nwhich determined this question was the cost-effectiveness of\nthe resources expended. As many as 67% of the families\nreported that more than one person in the household bene-\nfited from the program, according to the results of the Likert-\ntype scale analysis (M = 2.65). Often, more than one member\nof the family received books, and this doubled the exposure\nby the number of books read to the child. Open-ended\nresponses show that older children enjoyed receiving books\nin the mail so that they could read to the younger children.\nFathers also spent more time reading to the kids.\nThe number of library visits is also a measure of reading\nmotivation. Ten percent of the families used the library once\na week. Responses to Question 7, \"Do you and your child\ncheck out books from the library?\" revealed that the percent-\nage of children attending the local public library remained\nsteady at around 46%. Those families who never used the\nlibrary remained at 52%. Living in a remote part of New\nMexico does not lend itself to frequent public library use.\nThis fact underscores the value of having a new book arrive\nin the mail once a month.\nQuestion 8, \"What differences have you noticed in your\nchild who is participating in the IL?\" measured the parent's\nperceptions of improvement from using the IL books. The\ndesign of this question measured the effect of reading to chil-\ndren on the executive function of the brain that has been\nshown to improve with parent\u00adchild interaction (Center on\nthe Developing Child at Harvard University, 2011). The\ndevelopment of the executive function determines the ability\nto avoid distractions, control impulse, and handle multiple\ntasks at the same time. The three distinctive aspects are\nworking memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive or mental\nflexibility.\nSeventy percent of the parents noticed increased vocabu-\nlary skills exhibited by their child. Thirty-seven percent of\n6 SAGE Open\nthe parents believed that their child had improved in social\nskills from having experienced the books while 67% of the\nparents had noticed an increase in their child's listening\nskills. Only 9% of the parents noticed no difference in their\nchild's development.\nElectronic books (eBooks) were the focus of Question 9:\n\"What electronic devices does your child use to read?\"\nEBooks are defined as books viewed on a screen that turn\npages and might have interactive features such as read-\nalouds or dictionaries which search for word meanings. Half\nof the students used eBooks in the form of iPads (20%),\nKindles (7%), and the Smart phone (8%). Results correspond\nwith the recent Scholastic survey on eBook use which reports\nthat 47% of preschoolers have been exposed to eBooks\n(Scholastic, 2012). Parents responded that they had more\nthan 10 titles on these devices and they used this list of pro-\ngrams: Leap Pad and Leap Frog, Tag Reader with Tag Reader\nJunior, Nabi, Inno tab, and the Android tablet with Kindle\napplications. As IL books are paper and not electronic, the\nchanging reading interests of the parents and children were a\nconcern.\nThe last survey Question 10, \"Are there other comments\nyou would like to share about the IL program?\" was open-\nended and the responses were coded into major themes. First,\nthey were sorted into positive and negative answers. Forty-\nfive of the 46 responses noted a positive reaction to the pro-\ngram. The only negative response was that one title was\nrepeated. Typical examples of the positive comments were as\nfollows: \"Reading to my children on a daily basis has made\nme more aware of their intellectual growth. It's as important\nto us as eating a sit-down meal with the family.\"\nThese major themes emerged from the responses:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Twenty-nine people noted the high quality of the\nbooks and the interesting book choices. \"These are\ndelightful books we wouldn't have thought to choose.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Getting the books in the mail was an exciting event\naccording to sixteen parents. \"It allows them to asso-\nciate literacy with the thrill of receiving something\nwith their name on it in the mail.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Nine responses suggested an increase of family bond-\ning after reading the books together. \"We read the\nbooks when they come in the mail instead of watching\nTV.\" \"It gives me a reason to spend more quality time\nwith my child.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Intellectual developments as a result of IL were noted\nin seven comments: \"A world of imagination was\nopened to the child.\" \"The IL is an amazing initiative\nto help develop our kid's intellectual, social, and\nspeech skills.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 According to four written responses, multiple people\nin the household benefited from the books. \"My older\nchild (6) likes to read the books to her little brother so\nit is a great experience for both of them with interac-\ntion that promotes development.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Infants are included in literacy time according to three\nrespondents. \"My child is not able to talk, but she does\ngrab for books.\"\nConclusions and Recommendations\nThe survey results suggest that families are spending more\ntime reading to children, and relationships between and\namong family members are changing. The parents who read\nmore than once a day rose from 24% to 43%. The number of\nparents who never read to their children shrank from 2.0% to\n0. Fathers and older siblings participated in reading stories to\nyounger children. As one respondent wrote, \"Her father\nspends more time with her reading.\" Reading at home became\nroutine in the families who receive books monthly. Electronic\nbooks were available in the homes of about half of the fami-\nlies that were polled. This number corresponded to the use of\neBooks nationally according to the 2012 Scholastic Survey.\nThe purpose of the IL program is to nurture emergent\nreaders and provide them with reading choices that they\nmight not otherwise encounter. The survey reports validate\nthat the goals of the Southwest IL program have been met\nand that the literacy behavior of the families has experienced\na positive change. Furthermore, this change has resulted in\nimproved reading scores in the early grades and higher pass\nrates on the end of year competency scales. This data will be\nused to persuade legislatures that the program is worthy of\nstate-wide replication at the low cost of US$2.10 per book.\nAs the heavy lifting of administering the program, publish-\ning, and mailing the books is assumed by the Dollywood\nFoundation, a great service is rendered to the parents and\nchildren of the state at minimal cost.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBiemiller, A., & Slonim, N.
