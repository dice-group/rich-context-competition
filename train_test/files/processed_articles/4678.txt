In the framework of an artistic\u00adscientific project on eye-movements during reading, my\ncollaborators from the psychology department at the KU Leuven and I had a close look at the\npoem \"Un coup de d\u00e9s jamais n'abolira le hasard\" (\"A throw of the dice will never abolish chance\")\nby St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. The poem is an intriguing example of nonlinear writing, of a typographic\ngame with white and space, and of an interweaving of different reading lines. These specific features\nevoke multiple reading methods. The animation, Movement in Un coup de d\u00e9s, created during the\nstill-ongoing collaboration interweaves a horizontal and a vertical reading method, two spontaneous\nways of reading that point at the poem's intriguing ambiguity. Not only are we interested in different\nmethods of reading; the scientific representations of eye movements themselves are a rich source\nof images with much artistic potential. We explore eye movements as \"eye drawings\" in new images\ncharacterized both by a scientific and by an artistic perspective.\n",

I gave the\nproject the name \"Reading paths, eye drawings and word islands.\" The first results of the\nproject that I describe were part of the exhibition \"Over de eenheid en veelheid van het\nboek\" (\"On the unity and multiplicity of the book\") in the Nottebohm Room of the Library\nHendrik Conscience in Antwerp (6 August to 11 September 2011). I had already worked with\nJohan Wagemans for several years in the framework of \"Parallellepipeda,\" a cross-over project\nbetween art and science with a final exhibition in the museum M in Leuven (28 January to 25\nApril 2010). You can read more about this collaboration in the text \"Towards a new kind of\nexperimental psycho-aesthetics? Reflections on the Parallellepipeda project\" (Wagemans\n2011). During this cooperation I became acquainted with recordings and reproductions of\neye movements while looking at art. At that time, I was in the midst of preparing my PhD in\nthe Arts, working on \"Dimensions of the book.\" At http://www.ruthloos.be, one can find a\ncluster of words summarizing what my PhD is about and many images.\nI became very curious about the way we read, seen from a scientific point of view. The\nauthors that I have studied for my thesis provide philosophical and literary concepts that\ncan be employed when contemplating the book, its relationship with the reader, the author,\nthe world, and other books. They also speak about reading and writing, reading as branches\nin the imagination, reading as a creative act, and reading as rewriting. I wondered how\nreading is looked at by scientists (literally and figuratively) and whether this could enrich my\nintellectual and artistic quest around the book. In an early phase of this project, I understood\nthat \"an ordinary text\" has a repetitive linear reading pattern (Rayner and Pollatsek 1989).\nThe representations of the scan paths reminded me of a kind of writing, an illegible one,\nan asemic writing that presents the visual aspects of language, and language as image. The\nvery repetitive character (following the linear structure of the text) brought me to the question\nReading paths, eye drawings, and word islands 51\nFigure 1. Animation Movement in Un coup de d\u00e9s shown at the solo exhibition \"On the unity and\nmultiplicity of the book\" (2011) in one of Belgium's finest library rooms: the Nottebohm Room. The\nfigure shows the installation Carpet of Books with Lines of Flight.\nof what patterns would occur whilst reading texts with a different layout. We carried out\nexperiments with a short text that had some specific features in its layout, as an opportunity\nto learn about a whole range of representation possibilities for the collected eye-movement\ndata. Frouke Hermens, specialised in the field of visual perception, guided me through the\nworld of vision sciences. She is currently preparing an article, based on these initial data,\n\"Task effects on eye movements of viewers of nonlinear text\" (Hermens no date), and recently\nstarted a study on the eye movements of linear and nonlinear poems of the Belgian poet Paul\nVan Ostaijen.\n2 Movement in space and time, and in meaning\nMy interest in the work of the French poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 (1842\u00ad98) has focused on his\nlife project \"Le Livre\" (\"The Book\"). In Mallarm\u00e9 (1986) and Scherer (1978), one can read\nhow he especially thinks about the structure of the book and how it should be a book that\nis characterized by movement, with mobile pages in different combinations allowing for\ndifferent readings. An intriguing quote by Mallarm\u00e9 reveals a special complexity: \"A book\nneither begins nor ends: at most it pretends to\" (cited from Scherer 1978, page 24). Mallarm\u00e9\nwould never realize his total book. Although someone like Deleuze (1988, page 44) sees this\ndifferently: \"Our error is in believing that they [Leibniz and Mallarm\u00e9] did not succeed in\ntheir wishes: they made this unique Book perfectly, the book of monads, in letters and little\ncircumstantial pieces that could sustain as many dispersions as combinations.\"\nThe element of movement and the possibility of different readings also play a role in\nMallarm\u00e9's (1897/1914) last poem \"Un coup de d\u00e9s jamais n'abolira le hasard. Po\u00e8me.\"\nThere is movement between the double pages with each showing other (textual) images,\nmovement of the different reading lines that vary in size, and the typographic approach in\nwhich movement is expressed, not just in the size of the letters alone but also in the shape of\nthe text. There is cyclic movement. The title of the poem is divided into quarters spread on\nthe different pages. The poem ends with the same words with which it begins: \"Un coup de\nd\u00e9s.\" There is movement in time, the reading process, movement in the individual readings of\nthe same reader that vary, or of different readers, movement in more (or less) understanding,\nin grasping a meaning, in the appearing, disappearing, and reappearing of meaning.\n3 Between text and image\n\"Un coup de d\u00e9s\" is a particularly difficult poem. In its hermetic form, it is very difficult\nto grasp. It is therefore not a narrative poem; rather it presents \"prismatic subdivisions\nof an Idea\" that appear in variable positions, as Mallarm\u00e9 mentions in his foreword. \"Un\ncoup de d\u00e9s\" not only challenges our understanding but also alludes to another reading, a\ntabular reading. Here, it seems useful to make a link to the distinction made by Jean G\u00e9rard\nLapacherie (1984) between a linear and analytical reading (word) and a tabular and synthetic\nreading (image).\nThe two poles--image and language--refer to reading and looking, a semiotics of the\nlanguage and a semiotics of the image. They (the two poles) refer to a linear reading, a\nmovement from left to right and from top to bottom, and a tabular reading: in all directions,\nthere is no before and after, and no beginning and end, but a contiguity of characters.\nMallarm\u00e9 comes close to a tabular reading through his specific dealing with the white,\nthe tension between black and white, and the structure of the poem (see Figure 2 for an\ncoup de d\u00e9s\" as oscillating between \"visible\" and \"readable,\" and about how the poem \"tries\nto enrich analytical reading by global and simultaneous vision, and also to enrich static\nvision by the dynamism of the play of optical movements.\"\nFigure 2. Double page 4 of the 11-page-long French poem.\nThe Belgian conceptual artist, Marcel Broodthaers (1925\u00ad76), plays in a special way with\nthe image character of \"Un coup de d\u00e9s.\" In his artist's book Un coup de d\u00e9s jamais n'abolira\nle hasard. Image (Broodthaers 1969) (\"Image\" appears instead of \"Poem\"), the words of\nMallarm\u00e9 are replaced by black bars with the same dimensions (see Figure 3). The poem by\nReading paths, eye drawings, and word islands 53\nMallarm\u00e9, floating between word and image, becomes all image. However, the image here\nretains a strong bond with the word, because the image is not only image in a synthetic sense\nbut just as much a text (albeit an illegible one), a geometric writing. The asemic writing is\nhere, however, not something that refers to writing as such, but is something that refers to a\nvery specific readable text, and that constitutes its particularity. Johanna Drucker (1995, pages\n115\u00ad116) writes in The Century of Artists' Books that Broodthaers, with his subtle approach\nto the work of Mallarm\u00e9, provides a conceptual analysis of the poem. Johan Pas (2010),\nalso a connoisseur of artists' books, writes that \"Broodthaers' 'constellation' parasitizes,\nparodies, and permutes. By reproducing the original layout of the experimental poem and\ntransforming it into a geometric composition, Broodthaers linked the roots of the poetic\navant-garde (\"Un coup de d\u00e9s\" is considered to be the very first example of visual poetry) to\nthose of the pictorial abstraction.\"\nFigure 3. On the foreground one sees Broodthaers' artists book printed on transparent paper. This\ntransparency makes visible the underlying pages and provides as such a kind of summary of the book.\n4 Eye movements or eye drawings?\n\"Un coup de d\u00e9s\" as nonlinear text and innovative typography makes one very curious about\nthe form of concrete reading patterns. To be able to register and research eye movements, we\nworked with a digitized version of the poem. From each double page, we took a photograph.\nThe two-page spread for Mallarm\u00e9 is an important unit, including the centerfold. The\nphotographs were presented on a 21-inch computer screen. Reading in the lab means that\nyou do not turn a page but determine the pace at which the various pages are shown. It was\nnot possible to go back or forward one or more pages, thus making the reading process more\nlinear than usual. This gives the subjective feeling that you have less time to spend on each\npage than in a normal reading situation. However, the visual structure of the poem and its\nhermetic character is so special that it puts these restrictions of an unusual reading situation\ninto the background.\nFigure 4. Double page 7, scan path with fixations and saccades.\nMallarm\u00e9 wrote an interesting preface to the poem in which he reflects on different\nforms of reading, the impact of the typography, and the significant presence of the white.\nCertain representations of the eye movements make one think of constellations, and that\nis something that Mallarm\u00e9 himself seems to suggest. Every double page \"eye drawings\"\noccurred (ie, what I as an artist could call (eye) drawings). Some of them had a similar visual\nstructure to that of the text of the poem. These images, with small dots and lines, give the\nimpression that the reader was looking for an image that connects points. This reinforces the\nidea of the poem as a \"starry sky\" (wherein we also perceive figures), an idea also mentioned\nby Van Dijk (2005, page 45). These scientific images of scan-paths that I isolate here underline\nthe tabular or synthetic aspects of the poem (Figures 4 and 5).\n5 Horizontal and vertical movement\nWhat drew our attention concerning two separate series of readings by one and the same\nreader were the differences in reading direction. In one case, it was a horizontal movement\nthat passes the fold, and in another case, it was a vertical reading (that contained horizontal\ncomponents) with a gaze that went downwards per single page. In both cases, this was a\nspontaneous reading movement.\nFor the animation shown in the exhibition \"On the unity and multiplicity of the book,\"\nthese two ways of reading were interwoven. The animation presents the various reading\nmethods evoked by the poem itself and which form a source of ambiguity.\nIn the viewer function of our analysis program, the horizontal reading, an edited scan-\npath, could be inserted as a background. The text of the poem was omitted, texture was\nbrought in, and the colours were changed to red and white. The shape of the eye drawing (the\nscan-path) itself, in linear white, remained unchanged (Figure 6). Over this static image, a sec-\nond dynamic reading was laid. In the animation (http://www.youtube.com/user/EyeDrawings)\nReading paths, eye drawings, and word islands 55\nFigure 5. Double page 9, scan path with fixations and saccades.\na blue dot can be seen moving over the white linear drawing forming a rather vertical route\nper page. Also in blue, there is a timer that indicates the passing of time.\nThat the poem evokes multiple reading methods is also confirmed by Van Dijk (2005,\npage 47). She refers to Malcolm Bowie, who makes a connecting idea in Mallarm\u00e9 and the Art\nof Being Difficult. Bowie speaks about concurrent reading methods. Text fragments, isolated\nby space, become available in a new way. Semantic strings are formed across syntactic\nboundaries, by the grace of the white. Bowie speaks in terms of a \"network of rebellious\nstructures\" and \"the multifarious semantic texture of Mallarm\u00e9's lay-out\" (Bowie 1978, page\nBefore the creation of this animation, a prior idea was to work only with a moving red dot\non a white background in an animation that included the overall reading of the 11 double\npages of the poem. I imagined it as an independent mural work. However, during the project\nthis idea changed, because I wanted to make a work that could connect with the specific\narchitecture and characteristic display possibilities in the Nottebohm Room (Figure 7). In\naddition, this specific environment was an opportunity to exhibit the two original books (of\nMallarm\u00e9 and of Broodthaers). As it is possible to open them on one double page only (in a\nphysical constellation, not a digital rendering), I decided to focus on one double page for the\nthree works, in this case, page 4.\n6 Further possibilities\nIn further development of this project, it could be interesting to present two readings side\nby side, a reading of the book of Mallarm\u00e9 and a \"reading\" of the book by Broodthaers; or\nto gather various readings of one reader of the work of Mallarm\u00e9 to see how the reading\nchanges as one gradually understands more of the poem. Reading and rereading. Reading\nas rereading. Vladimir Nabokov argued that one cannot read a book, only reread it. A good,\nFigure 6. Basis image (\"found and created\") for the animation.\ncreative reader is a rereader. A similar idea is developed by Roland Barthes: rereading a text\nWe could also collect many readings of many readers, as a kind of intertextual summary,\nor summarize the work itself in a layered reading, as Broodthaers seems to do in the beautiful\nedition on translucent paper.\nWould it be possible during our study to learn something about \"meaning\" and where\nit occurs, or about our thoughts, and their forms? For example: which kind of eye drawings\nwould arise if we read Paul Van Ostaijen's (2010, page 123) poem that opens upper left with\n\"the bar is empty\" and closes bottom right with \"and full of people,\" separated by a sea of\nwhite? What drawings would occur in this sea, and could these drawings tell us something\nabout our imagination? Aside from this (unrealistic) question, we could ask ourselves: What\ncan we learn from reading poetry, about reading in a general sense?\nAnother project within this project could be to examine the effect on the reading pattern\ncaused by reading with tasks. Working with tasks builds further on studies which examined\nwhat eye movements observers make when they look at a work of art, like Yarbus (1965/1967),\nwho made an observer look at a painting while he tried to answer different questions about\nthe painting. In the context of reading a normal linear text, or an otherwise designed text, a\nreader could be asked to pay attention to specific words that reappear, to the use of different\nlanguages, to different reading directions, and to the spacing of the text columns. As I learned\nfrom Frouke Hermens, who has been analysing the data on participants who read a text\naccording specific tasks, these tasks lead to interesting and varying scan-paths.\nReturning to Mallarm\u00e9, looking at the scientific material was an inspiring way to get to\nknow the poem in some of its multiplicity and, thereby, to learn something about reading\nas a physical act, which is never separated from reading as a mental act. How do scientific\nrepresentations (from my artistic point of view: how do eye drawings) hover between optical\nperception and subjective imagination?\nReading paths, eye drawings, and word islands 57\nFigure 7. Setup in the Nottebohm Room with, on the left, the book by Mallarm\u00e9 and, on the right,\nthe book by Broodthaers.The animation was displayed in between. The white scan-path has a similar\nvisual structure as is seen in the open book pages. The path that is followed by the blue dot is differing.\nIn addition to an intellectual motivation, there is the artistic curiosity. The many different\nrepresentation methods of eye movements are a real artistic potential to examine. There are\nseveral possible ways to continue our project.\nOne of such is the creation of a series of animations in which qualities of specific\nrepresentations can be highlighted. The new moving images can acquire (a certain degree\nof) autonomy compared with their origin. There are possible departures such as putting\na reading of Mallarm\u00e9's Poem over Broodthaers' Image, or vice versa; presenting multiple\nreadings of the same two-page spread together in one and the same image, as a moving\ntangle; or not presenting eye drawings as a static image but letting them originate in an\nanimation--the eye that draws its trajectory in real time.\nWe were reminded of the importance of the white in the poem of Mallarm\u00e9 by mistakenly\nplacing the eye movements of a previous page over a following page, which meant that the\neye was reading the white only, and not the text, thus causing a humorous effect. This could\nalso be a starting point for a new creation.\nThe intention is not to stay close to the scientific material during the whole project but to\ncreate an independent work, enriched by the sciences. One example is the intertwining of\ntwo images into one independent image: the asemic writing and the eye drawing--or how\nreading and writing have something in common.\n7 In between\nThe special feature of this collaboration is the active participation of both sides, leading to\nnew creations that--for now--seem to exist in an intermediate space. The animation, in its\npartly unfamiliar use of eye-movement data, is still clearly recognizable by the scientist, but\nnot necessarily by the nonprofessional, including the artist and spectator, for example. At the\nsame time, the (\"partly created, partly found\") animation became semi-independent in an\nartistic way, as it was shown in an exhibition context, in a context of visual arts. This allows\naspects other than scientific aspects to appear. However, I would not call the animation an\nartwork. It is a work that bridges two worlds, art and science. In fact, the visual beauty in\nscience itself makes bridging possible. The specific aesthetics, real and potential, of graphical\n(static and dynamic) representations, and the way they connect to the imagination of the\nviewer, overcome the gap between arts and sciences.\n"
