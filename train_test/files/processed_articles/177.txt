The number increased from around 15,000 in 1971\ndead.\nIT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW the number of endar-\nterectomies performed for disease of the extracranial\narteries supplying the brain, to realistically assess the\nsignificance of the controversy concerning the indica-\ntions for the procedure.

The National Hospital Discharge\nSurvey was used to estimate those patients operated on\nin short-stay hospitals, exclusive of military and Veter-\nans Administration hospitals, located in the fifty states\nand the District of Columbia.

Information concerning public health service and\nother hospitals was not obtained.\nNational Hospital Discharge Survey\nThe National Hospital Discharge Survey is a survey\nof patients discharged from short-stay hospitals, exclu-\nsive of military and Veterans Administration hospitals,\nlocated in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nShort-stay hospitals are defined as having six beds or\nmore and an average length of stay less than 30 days.\nThe universe of the survey consists of 6,965 short-stay\nhospitals contained in the 1963 Master Facility Inven-\ntory of Hospitals and Institutions. New hospitals were\nof these hospitals were sampled providing approxi-\npitals with 1,000 beds or more in the universe of short-\nstay hospitals were selected with certainty. All\nhospitals with fewer than 1,000 were stratified, the\nprimary strata being 24 size by region classes. Within\neach of these 24 primary strata, the allocation of the\nhospitals was made through a controlled selected tech-\nnique so that hospitals in the sample would be properly\ndistributed with regard to type of ownership and geo-\ngraphic division. Sample hospitals were drawn with\nprobabilities ranging from certainty for the largest hos-\npitals to 1 in 40 for the smallest hospitals.\nSubsamples of discharges were selected within the\nsample hospitals using the daily listing sheet of dis-\ncharges as a sampling frame. These discharges were\nselected by random technique, usually on the basis of\nthe terminal digit(s) of the patient's medical record\nnumber, a number assigned when the patient was ad-\nmitted to the hospital. The within hospital sampling\nratio for selected sample discharges varied inversely\nwith the probability of selection of the hospitals.\nStatistics produced by the National Hospital Dis-\ncharge Survey are derived by a complex estimating\nprocedure. The basic unit of estimation is the sample\ninpatient discharge abstract. The estimating procedure\nused to produce essentially unbiased national estimates\nin the National Hospital Discharge Survey has three\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nprinciple components: inflation by reciprocals of the\nprobabilities of sample selection, adjustment for non-\nresponse, and a ratio adjustment to fixed totals. These\ncomponents of estimation are described in Appendix I\nof two earlier publications.3-6\nBecause the estimates from this survey are based on\na sample rather than the entire universe, they were\nsubject to sampling variability. The standard error is\nprimarily a measure of the variability that is attributed\nto using a value obtained from a sample as an estimate\nof a population value. The relative standard error is\nobtained by dividing the standard error by the estimate.\nThe resulting value is multiplied by 100 which ex-\npresses the standard error as a percentage of the esti-\nmate. The relative standard error ranged from 16.5%\nFor the purposes of this study, the appropriate code\nfrom the International Classification of Disease was\ndetermined for endarterectomy for vessels of head and\nfrom the Eighth Revision International Classification\nof Diseases, Adapted for Use in the United States\n1982 the International Classification of Diseases,\nNinth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)6\nFederal Hospitals\nThe Biometrics Division of the Veterans Adminis-\ntration was contacted. They did have actual counts on\nthe ICDA-8 code 26.1 for the years beginning October\nwas used but the second digit was not used and; there-\nfore, the procedures were for all endarterectomies not\njust for those of extracranial vessels.\nThe statistics of endarterectomies performed in the\nArmed Forces hospitals were obtained by direct con-\ntact with the Departments of Army,2 Air Force,3 and\nICDA-8 code 26.1 was used (all endarterectomies of\nhead and neck and base of brain) and for the years 1980\nthrough 1982 the International Classification of Proce-\ndures in Medicine (ICPM) code 538.1 was used (all\nendarterectomies except coronary).\nResults\nThe number of endarterectomies of the head and\nneck has increased steadily during the 12-hour period\n15,000 such procedures in non-federal hospitals in\n1971, this procedure was performed approximately\naround 3,000 times in federal facilities. This repre-\nsents a 4.7-fold increase in non-federal hospitals and\nabout a 2.9-fold increase in Army, Navy, Air Force\nand Veterans Administration hospitals.\nData for the largest population represented here, the\ncivilian population, were obtained from a survey in\nwhich estimates of events less than 10,000 are consid-\nTABLE 1 Number of Endarterectomies of Vessels of Head and\nNeck\nDeath\nAverage %\nNational\nHospital\nDischarge\nSurvey\n(Estimated to\nArmy\nand\nAir Force\n(% Navy)\nVAH\nBoxed areas include other endarterectomies than those for vessels\nof head and neck.\nered unreliable. For this reason, for each year the esti-\nmates of patients who had undergone endarterectomies\nand were discharged dead are not presented in Table 1.\nHowever, the percent of patients who had this proce-\ndure and were discharged dead was fairly consistent\nfor each of the 12 years under study, and averaged\n2.8% of all endarterectomy discharges. This appears to\nbe slightly higher than the percent of deaths in federal\nhospitals.\nDiscussion\nThe increase of procedures from approximately\ndifficult to understand in light of the lack of objective,\ndouble-blind prospective controlled studies to demon-\nstrate that endarterectomy is clearly advantageous to\nmedical therapy. This 467% increase must be based on\nthe opinion of the surgeons that the procedure is of\nconsiderable value. One can neither refute nor support\nthis concept on the basis of available data. Dr. Jack\nWhisnant, in his recent review of the decline of\nstroke,7 estimated that there were probably only ap-\nhave appropriate symptomatic angiographic lesions. If\nhis calculations are correct, even if surgery were ap-\npropriate for each of these 35,000 cases, there still\nwould be 50,000 procedures for indications that are not\ngenerally accepted. Thus, it is possible that between\ncedure that many physicians might not have agreed\nwas indicated. In addition, as mostreportsindicate that\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nstroke occurs from one to five times as often as death\n9,000 persons in this group may have had a stroke.\nThis would result in a combined mortality and morbid-\nand certainly should not be dismissed lightly.\nReferences\n1.
