Associated with the concept of territory, the \"bor-\nder\" is a universal structure, an organizational scheme\nfundamental to social and human life on Earth. The \"border\"\nis also a changing geographic reality that can be addressed\nin so many ways and can take many forms: linear, zoned, or\nsimply mental and imaginary.\nIn geography, the territory is space appropriated for a\ncertain social group and the \"border\" is the physical or psy-\nchological limit of that territory. Globalization created new\nterritories and new \"borders\" not always easy to cross--but\nthey all exist and coexist giving new meanings to the idea\nof space appropriation. Geographical space has gained all\nthese dimensions and can no longer be viewed in terms of\nits materiality.\nGeography education is inevitably connected to these\nnew approaches of territory and its limits, as the multicul-\ntural dimension of societies has made it impossible to\nignore that many global issues are now reflected in our\ncountries, regions, cities, and of course in our schools. And\nfor a subject specially designed to understanding the rela-\ntions between nature and society and its impacts in our\ndaily lives, the notion of inclusion and exclusion is particu-\nlarly relevant. It is a geographical concern to understand\nhow students can acquire knowledge that prepares them to\nanalyze and understand the complex and relevant problems\nin this world of multiple relations.\nThis is also a teachers'concern expressed in many studies\ndone in Portuguese schools. The complex world is no longer\na distant reality but it is here in our lives and in our class-\nrooms. The \"borders\" geography education addresses are not\njust national borders or European ones but they are increas-\ningly social and physiological. And these are many times the\nmost difficult ones to address. Through citizenship educa-\ntion, teachers in general and geography teachers in particular\ntry to address many issues related with the need to develop\ncritical thinking about complex global issues that are now a\nreality in their lives.\nPortuguese schools are multicultural territories where\nsometimes the borders in terms of social divisions and the\ninvisible and visible lines between groups are very real and it\nis important to challenge those borders which deny freedoms,\nrights, and capabilities. This article shows that school geogra-\nphy has been trying to \"tear down walls\" in what concerns the\nunderstanding of the world. First, we refer to the meaning of\n\"citizenship education.\" Then, the article focuses on present-\ning the nature of school diversity and how school geography,\nthrough teachers' voices, provides a territorial dimension of\nanalyses important in an effective citizenship education and\npractices.\nThis multiscale analysis is important when thinking about\ncitizenship at different levels and its impact in human and\nsocial development. It allows to analyze problems at local,\nregional, national, and global level and critically analyze its\nimpacts also at different levels.

The data presented\nare selected from a broader research that intends to prove\nthat many of these approaches can be made at local level, or\nin other words, that cities can be spaces where the benefits\nand problems of globalization can be found and studied and\nwhere the notion of territory and border can give an impor-\ntant framework to geographical education in Portuguese\nschools.\nThe Meaning of Citizenship Education\nA wide range of terms is used worldwide to denote a form of\nteaching and learning that in some way encourages good\ncitizenship. These include citizenship education, civics,\nsocial studies, life skills, and moral education. In addition,\nthere are relations with a variety of subjects (e.g., history,\ngeography, economics, politics, languages, environmental\nstudies, and religious education). Discussion of citizenship\neducation therefore encompasses a diverse and complex cur-\nFollowing an analysis of the more than 300 known defini-\ntions of democracy associated with citizenship education,\nDavid Kerr (2003) identifies a number of linked themes and\nconcepts that are common to citizenship education:\nThey include the themes of: the preservation of some-\nthing, such as democratic society and its associated\nrights; the notion of participation in society; the\npreparation or capacity building of young people for\nactive and informed participation; a focus on inclusion\nor integration into society; a concentration on contem-\nporary society, the encouragement of partnerships;\nand the promotion of an international perspective . . .\nThe definition also highlights a number of key con-\ncepts that underpin citizenship education, including\ndemocracy, rights, responsibilities, tolerance, respect,\nequality, diversity and community . . . Citizenship edu-\ncation also involves the dimensions of knowledge and\nunderstanding, skills, attitudes and values. These\ndimensions are brought together through teaching and\nlearning approaches, which have the primary goal of\nshaping and changing the attitudes and behaviour of\nyoung people through into their adult lives. The life-\nblood of citizenship education is modern society and\ndiscussion of the topical and sensitive issues it throws\nup. Citizenship education enables consideration of\nthese issues, often set within an appropriate historical\nframework, from a range of perspectives.\" (pp. 7-8,\nitalics added)\nPortugal followed the recommendations of the Council of\nEurope on education for democratic citizenship (Council of\nEurope, 2002). The Council of Europe clearly referred to the\nfact that it was a responsibility of present and future genera-\ntions to maintain and safeguard democratic societies, and\nthat education had an important role in promoting the active\nparticipation of all individuals in political, civic, social, and\ncultural life. Thus, education for democratic citizenship was\nvery important and should be implemented in all member\nstates. It was declared that\neducation for democratic citizenship should be seen\nas embracing any formal, nonformal or informal\neducational activity, including that of the family,\nenabling an individual to act throughout his or her\nlife as an active and responsible citizen respectful\nof the rights of others;\neducation for democratic citizenship should be con-\nsidered a factor for social cohesion, mutual under-\nstanding, intercultural and interreligious dialogue,\nand solidarity, that it contributed to promoting the\nprinciple of equality between men and women, and\nthat it encouraged the establishment of harmonious\nand peaceful relations within and among peoples,\nas well as the defense and development of demo-\ncratic society and culture; and\neducation for democratic citizenship, in its broadest\npossible sense, should be at the heart of the reform\nand implementation of educational policies.\nFollowing this and other important recommendations, the\nPortuguese Ministry of Education published in 2006 the\n\"Strategic goals and recommendations for an action plan of\nCitizenship Education\" (http://sitio.dgidc.minedu.pt/cidada-\nnia/Documents/FECidadaniaSP.pdf). It refers the need to\noffer all students a common base of knowledge, attitudes,\nand values through an accurate education for rights and\nresponsibilities in an educational perspective for global citi-\nzenship that allows the following:\ncontribution to students' personal and social develop-\nment based on diversified experiences of demo-\ncratic life;\nstudents' development as active members of society\nable to eliminate the social mechanisms that build\nand reproduce inequality and discrimination, as\nwell as able to value diversity as a way of human\nenrichment; and\nstudents' awareness of their responsibility as members\nof society, encouraging participation, coresponsi-\nbility, and compromise in the building as world,\nwhere freedom, justice, and solidarity really exist.\nThis is particularly important when considering the\nchanges Portuguese society has been going through in what\nconcerns its multicultural dimension. And of course, schools\nare an expression of these changes, as it will be addressed in\nthe next chapter.\nMulticultural Dimension of Portuguese\nSchools--Recent Changes\nPortugal was for many centuries a country of emigrants, but\nrecently this situation has changed. In the last decades,\nPortuguese society has been changing as a result of the\nchanging times--each year, more and more people from dif-\nferent countries, cultures, and religions have been arriving to\nPortugal in the pursuit of work and a better life. Although\nthis situation is not new to Portugal that for many years has\nreceived immigrants from PALP (Portuguese Speaking\nAfrican Countries) and Brazil, what makes this phenomena\nchallenging has been the arrival of many immigrants from\nEastern Europe.\nThe National Institute of Statistic recorded the following\nvalues for immigrants in Portugal, in the last decade\n(Table 1).\nIt is clear to perceive that the percentage of immigrants\nhas been growing in a fast rate practically doubling each\ndecade. The origin of the immigrants also changed as shown\nin Figures 1 and 2, for the last 10 years:\nIt is clear that in 2000, it was still Africa the main supplier\nof immigrants to Portugal (almost 47% of the total immi-\ngrants). The majority of this African immigrants arrived\nfrom the PALP (a total of 95% of African immigration to\nPortugal), as Table 2 shows.\nDuring the decade of 2000, these figures started to change\nand presently Europe is the main supplier of immigrants who\narrive in Portugal. Figure 2 shows the shift from a strong\nAfrican immigration to an unprecedented number of\nEuropean immigrants arriving in Portugal.\nThe majority of these European immigrants arrived from\nseveral destinations, especially from Easter Europe as\nFigure 3 shows.\nImmigration from Eastern European countries is now\nalmost 70% of European immigration. It is important not to\nforget the percentage of immigrants arriving from Central\nand South America, the relative value of which has increased\nreaching more than 25% of the immigrants arriving in\nPortugal). These immigrants are mainly from Brazil (95% of\nimmigrants originating from South America in 2000 and\nThis changing pattern of immigration presents many chal-\nlenges to both state and society. This flow of immigrants to\nSouthern Europe has made the Mediterranean region more\ncomplex and created many new problems. The nature of\nimmigration since the 1990s is a remarkable mix of nation-\nalities and skills (Baldwin-Edwards, 2004).\nBut it is not only society that has had to face these recent\nchanges: The educational system has also felt the need to\nadapt to this new Portuguese reality. School is becoming a\nmix of nationalities and cultures. If society is increasingly\nmulticultural, Portuguese schools include, nowadays, a\nyoung population of different cultural origins. The school\nhas more than ever before an importance in recognizing the\nmulticulturalism of school attendants. It is necessary to take\nin consideration this dimension in such a way that all the dif-\nferences are respected and still school prepares its students to\nThe integration of migrants, refugees, asylum seekers,\nand minorities in the Portuguese education system follows\nthe principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nand, particularly, the United Nations Convention on the\nRights of the Child36 (Article 2, n.1), which is applied inde-\npendent of the child's legal status. The national legislation\nand the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic (Articles 13,\n15, 73, and 74) bestow rights of equal treatment in access to\neducation and teaching, independent of race, language, terri-\ntory of origin, or religion. In these terms, any child (exiled,\nTable 1. Immigrants in Portugal in the Last Decades (National\nImmigrants\nAfrica Europe Central\nand South\nAmerica\nNorth\nAmerica\nAsia Oceania\n%\nFigure 1.

Applications are analyzed by the Ministry of\nEducation according to a table that contemplates 25 coun-\ntries. A Support Office for the Recognition of Qualifications\nand Competencies is maintained by the ACIME (High\nCommission for Immigration and Ethnic Minorities) for this\nspecific purpose.\nImmigrant, refugee, or asylum-seeker students who enter\nthe Portuguese education system benefit from pedagogic\nsupport which is both adequate to their situation and compat-\nible with the resources available to their new school. The\nsupport measure ought to be focused on the removal of all\nthat hinders the students' progress and the creation of spe-\ncific activities for the learning of Portuguese as a second lan-\nguage, whenever they prove necessary. Schools should also\nperform a diagnostic assessment of the pupil, followed of an\nindividual educational support plan (Dias, 2005).\nAccording to a Ministry of Education report (Direc\u00e7\u00e3o\nGeral da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o [DGIDC], 2005), Portuguese schools\nwere attended by students of 120 nationalities, which have a\ntotal of 80 languages as their mother tongue. This report\nintended to characterize the situation of the students whose\nmother tongue is not Portuguese and reached some interest-\ning conclusions:\nAlthough students from Angola and Cape Verde are in\nthe top of the countries of origin of the students who\nwere not born in Portugal or whose parent's mother\ntongue was not Portuguese, Brazil and Ukraine\nare now in third and fourth position, between\nzilian students represented 8.2%, while the percent-\nage of Ukrainian students had increased to 8%.\nAccording to the data of the study, which involved\nzil, Ukraine, France, Moldavia, Germany, and\nSwitzerland had a growing number of students in\nPortuguese schools, while others were in low num-\nbers such as Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9\ne Pr\u00edncipe, and India, in what concerns students\nwhose mother tongue was not Portuguese.\nAmong the 80 languages spoken by students at home,\nthe \"crioulo\" languages spoken in PALP countries\nare the most common, followed by Ukrainian. The\nmajority of the students speak Portuguese in school\nwith teachers and peers, but 5% communicates with\ntheir peers in \"crioulo.\"\nThere is also a relation between school achievement\nand nationality.Among the best succeeded students,\nthere are nationalities such as Moldavia, Switzer-\nland, Germany, Romania, and Ukraine.\nIn what concerns the understanding of school subjects,\nin a scale of four (ranging from \"good,\" \"satisfac-\ntory,\" \"not satisfactory,\" to \"don't understand any-\nthing\") 40.6% of the students got a \"satisfactory\"\nand 30% reached \"good.\" Yet, one in each four\nstudents shows great difficulties in the mastering\nof Portuguese language and almost 5% considered\n\"don't understand anything\" in what the use of Por-\ntuguese language is concerned.\nIn what concerns school achievement, 60% of students\nwhose mother language is not Portuguese manages\nto get a satisfactory level, and the remaining 40%\nrefer in equal parts to very good levels of achieve-\nment and negative achievement.\nThe fact that students enter the system without testing for\nPortuguese language skills has given rise to some criticism.\nIn fact, immigrant students are integrated in schools without\nhaving actually developed the learning skills necessary to\ncope with the curricula. It was exactly this situation that led\nto the implementation of a program of integration of stu-\ndents whose mother tongue was not Portuguese, in 2005, by\nthe Ministry of Education.\nHaving presented the situation in terms of nationality and\ncultural diversity of Portuguese schools, it is important to\nrefer how the school system has been trying to overcome all\nthe challenges of multicultural schools. If much has been\ndone in terms of educational policy, a lot remains in the\nTable 2.

And if in some school subjects it is difficult to\napproach the item of living in a multicultural society and\nschool, in school geography this item is an important cur-\nricular part of the school subject.\nThus, geography gives an important contribution in terms\nof discussing these new situations which are a reality of\nPortuguese classrooms. In the following chapter, a study\ninvolving geography teachers will be presented--It was\nimportant to know their views and practices in citizenship\neducation; considering Portuguese multicultural school,\nschool geography is even more relevant in what concerns\ndealing with differences in terms of language, culture, reli-\ngion, and other aspects.\nSchool Geography and Citizenship\nEducation--Recent Approaches in\nCompulsory School\nDue to the growing ethnic, cultural, racial, language, and\nreligious diversity in Europe and throughout the world, citi-\nzenship education needs to be reviewed to prepare students\nto function effectively in the 21st century. Citizens in this\ncentury need the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary\nto operate in their cultural communities and beyond their\nThe role of school has never been so important in helping\nstudents to develop, not only thoughtful and clarified identi-\nfications with their cultural communities and their nation-\nstates but also clarified global identifications and deep\nunderstanding of their roles in the world community.\nAccording to DeJaeghere (2009), schools should be talking\nabout critical citizenship pedagogical approaches that bring\ncoherency to other approaches found in different forms of\neducation and apply them to the purposes of citizenship edu-\ncation in multicultural societies.\nThese approaches are summarized by the author in four\nmain areas:\n1. including marginalized knowledge and voices in\nthe curriculum to allow for the construction of\nalternative forms of citizenship, and seeing this\nknowledge in relation to, and as a critique of, main-\nstream constructions of citizenship and democracy;\n2. learning and enacting double-consciousness,\nwhich is examining one's perspectives about and\nidentity related to citizenship through the eyes of\nanother (self-awareness and awareness of others'\nperspectives) and understanding the complexities\nof citizen identity affected by discrimination and\noppression;\n3. developing intercultural understanding through\nintercultural learning experiences to engage others\nin civic relations and spaces; and\n4. utilizing strategies for collective social action, such\nas a collaborative engagement of students, teachers,\nschools, and communities to create social change.\nSo, how can school geography do its part?\nThe International Declaration on Geographical Education\nfor Cultural Diversity (International Geographical Union\n[IGU], 2000) considers in its preamble that school geogra-\nphy is committed in the world effort to enhance the ability of\nall citizens to contribute to creating a just, sustainable, and\npleasant world for all. In fact, the nature of geography educa-\ntion has specificities that make this school subject a major\ncontributor in overcoming some of the bias that arise in a\nmulticultural society and of course in multicultural school\nsystems.\nIn fact, geography education offers foundations for peo-\nple of the world to develop\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 the ability to be sensitive toward and defend human\nrights;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 an ability to understand, accept, and appreciate cul-\ntural diversity;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 an ability to understand empathies and critique\nalternative viewpoints about people and their social\nconditions;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a willingness to be aware of the impact of their own\nlifestyles on their local and broader social contexts;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 an appreciation of the urgent need to protect our\nenvironment and bring about environmental justice\nto local communities and regions that have experi-\nenced environmental devastation; and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 an ability to act as an informed and active member\nof their own and the global society.\nPortuguese National Curriculum (Department of Basic\nEducation [DEB], 2001) doesn't have a specific discipline to\naddress citizenship education and so, this task has been\nattributed to the several curriculum subjects. Some guiding\nlines are presented in terms of what dimensions school sub-\njects should address in the formation of a conscientious citi-\nzenship:\ncreation and development of a personal and social\nidentity;\nparticipation in civic life showing responsibility, soli-\ndarity, and a critical attitude;\nrespect and valorization of individual and group\ndiversity in what concerns their communities and\nchoices;\ndevelopment of an ecological awareness leading to the\nvalorization and preservation of the natural and cul-\ntural heritage; and\nvalorization of the relational dimension of learning\nand the ethical principles that regulate the relation\nwith knowledge and the others.\n6 SAGE Open\nIn view of these recent concerns, school geography in\nPortugal was reorganized in terms of contents and compe-\ntences (DEB, 2002). It assumes its vocation in terms of giv-\ning a fundamental contribution to citizenship education. The\nconcept of the \"geographical competent citizen\" is intro-\nduced and defined as \"the one that has spatial skills, having\nthe ability to view spatially phenomena, interconnecting\nthem, and understand their territorial patterns, use different\nscales of approach, and understand territorial, cultural and\nindividual identity.\"\nConsidering that the teaching of the subject should be\ncentered in the interpretative dimension of several educa-\ntional experiences and not in the theoretical contents of\ngeography, school geography is organized in six broad\nthemes that should be developed in compulsory school:\nThe Earth: How to study it and represent it;\nNatural environments;\nPopulation and its patterns;\nEconomical activities;\nDevelopment contrasts; and\nEnvironment and society.\nIn each theme, teachers should create learning experi-\nences that allow the development of general competences\nand also specific geography competences: location, knowl-\nedge about places, and dynamisms of the interrelations\namong places. So, what does learning geography mean?\nAccording to the International Declaration on Geo-\ngraphical Education for Cultural Diversity (IGU, 2000),\ngeography plays a major role in identifying cultural diversity\nof people around the world and their potential communality\nof Earth through the study of place, space, territory, natural\nresources, and people's livelihoods. In so doing, geography\nacts as an important \"bridge\" between the physical and social\nsciences. Geographers have a long history of significant\ncontributions to decision making at local, regional, and\nglobal scales for a variety of issues, including resources\nmanagement, health, environmental assessment, transporta-\ntion, climate changes, and hazard management. Because\nhumanity's common concern at the start of the 21st century\nis about its natural and human-created environment, geogra-\nphy's main contribution to the future of the planet now lies in\nits pedagogical and scientific efforts to explicate further our\nunderstanding of spatial aspects of the human\u00adnature\ninterface.\nThis contribution to the understanding of the world also\nimplies civic education--Through geography, students are\nencouraged to explore and develop knowledge and under-\nstanding, skills, and attitudes and values. In terms of knowl-\nedge and understanding, one of the most relevant issues is\nthe diversity of peoples and societies on Earth to appreciate\nthe cultural richness of humanity. In terms of skills, students\ndevelop the ability to use communication, thinking, practical\nand social competencies to explore geographical topics at a\nrange of scales from local to international. And in terms of\nvalues, students develop the capacity to understand their sur-\nroundings and the variety of natural and human characteris-\ntics on the surface of the Earth as well as learn to respect the\nrights of different social groups.\nSchool geography in Portugal pursues all these goals, and\nits educational relevance increases when considering diver-\nsity issues not only in a regional or national scale but also in\na local scale, in the classroom, in the school. Geography\ndeals with issues closely related to citizenship, multicultural-\nism, among others. These issues are very important nowa-\ndays, and geography allows a multidisciplinary and global\nvision of the world events. Even in what concerns globaliza-\ntion, school geography bases its analyses in the understand-\ning of other cultures, in intercultural and economic changes,\nand in changes in general (Cachinho, 2000).\nIn the next section, geography teachers share their consid-\nerations about these issues and explain how geography\nthemes adapt to dealing with aspects of multiculturalism,\ncitizenship education, and other important questions. More\nimportant, how do geography teachers view their roles as\ncitizenship educators through geography in their multicul-\ntural classes.\nGeographyTeachers Perceptions on\nCitizenship Education--The Importance of\ntheTerritorial Dimension\nThese data are part of a broader research concerning school\ngeography in Portugal, teachers training and concerns, reor-\nganization of the school subject, and the role of geography\nin the national curriculum. About 200 geography teachers\nparticipated in this research explaining how they have\nadapted in the last decades to changes in the national cur-\nriculum in general and in the particular subject they teach--\ngeography.\nThe first thing teachers were asked was, considering the\nmain themes of school geography, which ones adapt better to\nallowing approaches related to citizenship education in their\nclassrooms. The Figure 4 shows that this is a cross-curricular\ntheme in geography, but there are two themes that presented\nthemselves as particularly relevant to this kind of approach.\nThe themes are presented in the order they are taught during\nthe last 3 years of compulsory school (at least till 2009,\nbecause now compulsory school has 3 more years, but that's\nanother issue).\nIt is important to refer that teachers were also asked\nabout the themes that are most interesting in developing\nissues about sustainable development and environmental\neducation, but for the purpose of this presentation, we will\nfocus on the themes that most adapt to citizenship educa-\ntion issues. The graph shows two main themes for this pur-\npose--\"population and its patterns\" and \"developments\ncontrasts.\"\nWe will focus on the theme related to population and its\npatterns to understand the kind of learning students can do.\nThe study of this theme implies developing learning experi-\nences related to\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Population\n\u00ad Distribution and factors\n\u00adE\nvolution of the population and demographic\nvariables\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Mobility\n\u00ad Types of migrations\n\u00ad Migratory fluxes\n\u00ad Causes and consequences of migrations\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Cultural diversity\n\u00ad F\nactors of identity and differentiation of popula-\ntions\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Urbanized areas\n\u00ad Urbanization and rural areas\n\u00ad Urban areas' structure\n\u00ad Urban and rural ways of life\nIn geography research, some of the findings have already\nproved the need to approach these items within a territorial\ncontext. Issues like cultural diversity need a territorial basis\nof analyses which provides different types of learning. One\nthing is talking about cultural diversity in the world, in\nEurope, in the city, or even in the neighborhood; another is\napproaching these issues in a des-territorialized context (as\nit is done many times in citizenship education).\nClose approaches are more connected to students' expe-\nriences, feelings, and emotions, and at this local level of\nanalyses, certain issues can have the effect of challenging\nstudents' reflections and critical thinking about their own\nbeliefs. The analysis of some phenomena at a regional level\nmay also be interesting to develop a wider awareness of\ncultural issues. And making the same study at the global\nlevel will certainly give another understanding of the cul-\ntural diversity issue.\nSo, how can teachers manage all these approaches in the\ngeography class? Giving students the possibility to range\nfrom these different levels of analyses enables them to grow\nfrom \"their own experience\"\u00adbased perceptions to a wider\ncomprehension of the phenomena. This means involving stu-\ndents in problem-based activities, many times arising from\ntheir own experience. The development of a geographical\nliteracy can be based in memorization of isolated geographi-\ncal facts. Students live in a multidimensional world and\nbecome aware of it in many contexts. It is the daily relation-\nship with the environment that helps shaping knowledge and\nunderstanding of space.\nThe multicultural dimension of the classrooms can be an\nimportant asset for teachers when approaching population\nand diversity issues. And through geography, it is possible\nto do these multiscale analyses to show that oftentimes\nlocal issues are a consequence of global ones. Or, on the\ncontrary, students may perceive that those global issues\nhave local impacts that reflect in their existence and\nperceptions.\nThe most important contribution of geography is, by set-\nting a territory of analyses, with its physical or imaginary\nborders, it is clearer to approach certain issues. When asked\nabout the importance of citizenship education, which is a\nconcern for geography teachers, many referred to values\nand attitudes, but the majority considered that these should\nbe worked within a context that helped to clarify the ques-\ntions in discussion. And it was clear that some teachers give\nmore importance to a local level of analyses of problems\nwhereas others consider that the regional and global dimen-\nsion can never be forgotten to understand the dynamics and\ninterrelations of natural and social issues (Figure 5).\nThe Earth:\nhow to study\nand represent\nit\nNatural\nEnvironments\nPopulation\nand Its\nPatterns\nEconomical\nactivities\nDevelopment\ncontrasts\nEnvironment\nand Society\n%\nFigure 4.

Geography teachers' perceptions about citizenship\neducation\n8 SAGE Open\nThe analyses of teachers' perceptions about their role in\naddressing issues of citizenship education showed that there\nare six main areas that are considered fundamental:\nthe development of values, attitudes, and social com-\npetences;\nthe formation in terms of knowledge about their rights\nand duties as members of society;\nrespect for others and the environment, know himself\nor herself;\nformation of the individual conscientious of the world\nthey live in, active and participative in society;\nformation of the individual in terms of his or her inte-\ngration in various communities; and\nthe idea that citizenship education implies some kind\nof membership that can range from community\nlevel to global level.\nComparing those with Kerr's (2003) themes that involve\ncitizenship education, Portuguese geography teachers share\nthis common idea of contribution to the integration of stu-\ndents in their communities and have an active and construc-\ntive participation in them:\nPreservation of something: In geography, the idea of a\nsustainable world is very connected to the theme of\ndevelopment and social issues;\nNotion of participation: In geography, students\ndevelop competences related to problem solving\nand decision making about social, economical, and\nenvironmental issues;\nFocus on inclusion or integration: In geography,\nthrough the learning of different places, societies,\nand problems, students learn to respect differences\nin a plural society, and are sensible to the existence\nof different cultures and worry how they relate and\ninterconnect;\nPromotion of an international perspective: Geogra-\nphy education helps in developing awareness about\nthe main problems of the world, and develops the\nnotion of geographical diversity and the ability to\nsearch for strategies that lead to the possible solu-\ntion of common problems;\nKey concepts: Through geography education, it is pos-\nsible to clarify many key concepts (knowledge and\nunderstanding, skills, attitudes, and values) as geog-\nraphy deals with real problems of the real world.\nBy giving all these approaches a territorial dimension,\ngeography education allows the approach of issues of diver-\nsity, conflicts, integration, or any other in a real context that\ncan be very effective in terms of developing critical analyses\ncompetences. That may be the most important contribution\nof geography education to tearing down walls.\nFinal Reflections About Urban Geography\nContribution to Citizenship Education\nIn the previous sections we tried to demonstrate how\nPortuguese society is more than ever a multicultural one,\nand how it reflects in the complexity of our schools and how\nit was necessary to develop different approaches to help\nstudents understand this diversity and adapt to it. The par-\nticular case of school geography was referred, an example of\na school subject that has taken the lead in many projects and\nstudies related to citizenship education.\nThe themes explored by the school subject are particu-\nlarly relevant in studies about social and economical prob-\nlems of our societies and their impact in the territorial. It\nwas also mentioned that it is exactly this possibility of con-\nducting studies at different scales that gives geography its\nimportance in terms of approaching issues of human and\nsocial development. We would like to refer to the impor-\ntance that urban studies have been gaining in specific areas\nof study of many global issues.\nAccording to Cabigon (2008), understanding the nature of\ncities in globalization is essential knowledge. In fact, cities all\nshare common traits (e.g., a market-oriented nature). They\nalso hold a potential for dualism (promise: wealth, innova-\ntion, and social change; and trouble: prostitution, poverty,\ncrime, and pollution, among many others). Cities are very\nimportant both globally and locally. They are the center of\ntrade, commercial establishments, business firms, advanced\nculture, and technology. They are the destinations of immi-\ngrants hoping and searching for employment. Cities represent\nthe most often used and influential places in the world.\nThis means that our success and survival in the world\ntoday and tomorrow depends on the knowledge we have\nabout cities. Cities are particularly challenging entities to\nunderstand. Equally important is that they are constantly\nevolving, impacting on our lives and the lives of others.\nGeographers have always been interested in cities as they\nsometimes reflect many events that happen at a different\nscale, and reproduce many of the issues that also appear at\ndifferent scales. Being a close reality for Portuguese stu-\ndents, what happens in the city may be a good place of study\nto understand most complex phenomena.\nThe importance of the city as the living place of a great\nin the Expo in Shanghai, titled, \"Better World Better Life.\"\nUrban inequality in the cities always has a social and territo-\nrial expression.And these inequalities can have serious polit-\nical repercussions. The UN Report State of the Cities\nSocial and economic inequalities can awaken a host\nof negative sentiments among the poor and dispos-\nsessed and lead to mass action, or worse, civil strife,\neither because disparities are not acknowledged and\nthus not remedied, or because corrective measures\nsuch as laws and redistribution policies attempt\nto entrench the status quo or seek to placate those\nmired in a highly unequal system and\nInequalities can also reduce the base of social and\npolitical support for fundamental structural reforms\nnecessary to embark on a path of high growth with\nmore equity.\nThe discourse about the city could easily be the discourse\nabout the world's inequalities and this is why geographers\ngive a special attention to the city when creating citizenship\neducation activities. In her research, Soenen (2002) presents\na study on community development in urban environments\nundertaken in multiethnic schools in Flanders. The main\npurpose was to research changes in schools and use the com-\nplexity and diversity of the city to build social integration\nand a sense of community. Some of the conclusions of the\nstudy reinforce the importance of the city approach in deal-\ning with multicultural integration issues.\nThe movement of educational cities has been drawing\neducators' attention since 1990 to the fact that the city pro-\nvides the best material conditions from which to forge a gen-\neral offer of diffusion of the learning and the knowledge\nneeded for life in society and, at the same time, can create the\ngreatest range of inequalities in its distribution. The city is a\nshopwindow filled with an array of offers and possibilities\nwaiting to be chosen, but very often, they are not taken\nadvantage of, or else there is an unequal distribution of the\nfreedom to do so (International Association of Educating\nIn its Charter of Educating Cities, it is stated that diversity\nis inherent in the modern city and the notion is that it will\nincrease even more in the future. Accordingly, one of the\nchallenges facing the educating city is to foster a balance and\nharmony between identity and diversity, taking into account\nthe contributions of the communities of which the city is\ncomprised and the rights of all those living in the city to feel\nthat their own cultural identity is being recognized.\nAnd these are important reasons why to approach human\ndiversity in school geography at the local scale is very impor-\ntant to help students grasp the real impact of their imaginary\nborders in the place they live in. Because \"borders\" are real\nand their impact is visible in the living space of cities. And it\nis by fighting the closest ones that maybe distant ones will\nfade away.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBaldwin-Edwards, M.
