The relationships between ADMA and surrogate measures of arterial stiffness\nwere evaluated.\nMethods: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy control subjects were recruited.\nADMA was quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Arterial stiffness was evaluated\nusing pulse wave analysis.\nResults: There was no significant difference in plasma ADMA concentration between patients\nwith rheumatoid arthritis (n \u00bc 30) and healthy controls (n \u00bc 30). Aortic augmentation pressure\nwas significantly higher in patients than in controls. C-reactive protein and Health Assessment\nQuestionnaire score were independent predictors of arterial stiffness in patients. There was no\nrelationship between ADMA concentration and aortic augmentation pressure in the study\npopulation as a whole.\nConclusions: Arterial stiffness appears to be increased in rheumatoid arthritis and independently\nassociated with systemic inflammation and physical disability. ADMA concentration was not\nincreased in this small group of patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared with healthy controls;\nnor was it associated with arterial stiffness.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1Rheumatology Unit, Department of Clinical and\nExperimental Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliero-\nUniversitaria of Sassari and University of Sassari, Sassari,\nItaly\n2Cardiology Unit, Department of Clinical and\nExperimental Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliero-\nUniversitaria of Sassari and University of Sassari, Sassari,\nItaly\n3Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sassari,\nSassari, Italy\nCorresponding author:\nGian Luca Erre, Rheumatology Unit, Department of\nClinical and Experimental Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliero-\nUniversitaria of Sassari and University of Sassari, Viale San\nEmail: e.gianluca@libero.it\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

The aim of the present study was\nto investigate whether levels of asymmetric\ndimethylarginine (ADMA), as a measure of\nendothelial dysfunction,3 are higher in\npatients with rheumatoid arthritis compared\nwith healthy control subjects. In addition,\nthe relationships between ADMA and surro-\ngate measures of arterial stiffness were\nevaluated.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nConsecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis\nwho met the criteria of the American College of\nRheumatology4 and had no history of cardio-\nvascular events were enrolled from the out-\npatient clinic of the Rheumatology Unit,\nDepartment of Clinical and Experimental\nMedicine, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria\nof Sassari and University of Sassari, Sassari,\nCollected data included: presence of conven-\ntional cardiovascular risk factors; treatment\nwith aspirin, or antihypertensive or cholesterol-\nlowering drugs; duration of rheumatoid\narthritis; steroid treatment; type and dosage\nof antitumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a\ninhibitor treatment; C-reactive protein (CRP)\nconcentration; erythrocyte sedimentation rate;\nimmunoglobulin M rheumatoid factor; antic-\nyclic citrullinated peptide; Disease Activity\nScore (DAS);5 Ritchie Index;6 and Health\nAssessment Questionnaire (HAQ).7\nControl subjects strictly matched for con-\nventional cardiovascular risk factors (using\necho colour Doppler carotid ultrasound),\nwho were attending routine check-ups at the\noutpatient clinic of the Cardiology Unit,\nDepartment of Clinical and Experimental\nMedicine, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria\nof Sassari and University of Sassari, were also\nenrolled. The protocol was approved by the\nethics committee of the University of Sassari\nand all participants provided written informed\nconsent prior to enrolment.\nStudy parameters\nWhole blood was collected into sterile\ntubes containing ethylenediaminetetra-acetic\nacid (EDTA)-potassium, then centrifuged in\nresulting plasma was stored at \u00c020C until\nanalysis. Plasma ADMA was quantified\nusing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA; DLD Diagnostika GmbH,\nHamburg, Germany), according to the manu-\nfacturer's instructions. Arterial stiffness was\nevaluated by pulse wave analysis as\ndescribed,8 using a high-fidelity hand-held\ntonometry probe (Millar pressure tonometer,\nPWV Medical, Sydney, Australia). Registered\nradial pulse waveforms were recorded using a\ncomputer-based pulse wave analysis system\n(SphygmoCor\u00d5, PWV Medical, Sydney,\nAustralia).\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD or n (%)\nof participants. Between-group compari-\nsons were made using Student's t-test,\nKolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test or 2-test, as\nappropriate. Bivariate relationships were\nanalysed using nonparametric Spearman's\ntest. A two-sided P-value 0.05 was con-\nsidered statistically significant. Data were\nanalysed using SPSS\u00d5 version 11.0 (SPSS\nInc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows\u00d5.\nResults\nThe study included 30 patients with rheuma-\ntoid arthritis (two male/28 female; mean age\nyears). Demographic and clinical characteris-\ntics of the study population are shown in Table\n1. There were no significant between-group\ndifferences in cardiovascular risk factors.\nSignificantly more control subjects than\npatients were taking aspirin (P\u00bc 0.04).\nData regarding ADMA and arterial\nstiffness parameters are shown in Table 2.\nTable 1.

This is in contrast to the\nfindings of other studies, which have reported\nsignificantly higher ADMA concentrations in\ntreatment-nai\u00a8ve patients with rheumatoid\narthritis, compared with controls.9 A small\nprospective study found a significant reduc-\ntion in ADMA concentrations after 3\nmonths' anti-TNF-a treatment.10 It is there-\nfore possible that the absence of a significant\nbetween-group difference in ADMA concen-\ntration in the present study may be a result of\nlong-term treatment with anti-TNF-a drugs\nin our patient group. It should be noted that,\nas the range of biological variation of ADMA\nis extremely narrow both in health and\ndisease,11 the sample sizes of our study and\nother studies might be too small to draw firm\nconclusions regarding ADMA concentrations\nTable 2.

Furthermore, hetero-\ngeneity in ADMA quantification methods\nand in enrolled patient populations may\nfurther explain these apparently contradict-\nory results.\nArterial stiffness is related to systemic\ninflammation and is elevated in patients with\nrheumatoid arthritis compared with healthy\ncontrols.12 There was a statistically signifi-\ncant increase in arterial stiffness in patients\ncompared with controls in the present study.\nIn addition, the inflammatory marker CRP\nwas a major predictor of arterial stiffness in\nour patient group. We found no relationship\nbetween ADMA concentration and aortic\naugmentation pressure (as a measure of\narterial stiffness) in either the study popula-\ntion as a whole or in the patient group alone.\nThis may be due to the small sample size of\nour study.\nIn conclusion, arterial stiffness appears to\nbe increased in rheumatoid arthritis and is\nindependently associated with systemic\ninflammation and physical disability.\nADMA concentration was not increased in\npatients with rheumatoid arthritis; nor was\nit associated with arterial stiffness.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nEditorial assistance was provided by Gayle\nRobins on behalf of HPS\u00adHealth Publishing\nand Services Srl and funded by Pfizer Italia.\nReferences\n1.
