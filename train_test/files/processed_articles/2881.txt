    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe use a unique and comprehensive data set on open-end real estate funds\nin Germany to study a liquidity crisis that hit this industry between 2005\nand 2006. Since this industry is comparably unregulated our data set per-\nmits us to contrast competing explanations of liquidity crisis. We nd that\nfundamental factors matter for the liquidity outow in normal times. During\nthe crisis, however, they do not play a role. During the panic only strategic\ncomplementarities drive withdrawals. Furthermore, we nd that funds with\na higher load fee suer from substantially larger outows in the crisis period,\nwhile a higher load fee reduces gross outows in normal times. As institu-\ntional investors predominately invest in funds with a low load fee this is in\nline with recent theory arguing that complementarities are mitigated by the\ninvolvement of large institutional investors who can at least partially correct\nfor the coordination failure resulting from complementarities.\nKeyword Liquidity Crisis, Runs, Strategic Complementarities\nNon-Technical Summary\nThe lack of liquidity, though not the origin, is at least an important amplier of\nnancial crises. Liquidity risks on the balance sheet of various nancial intermedi-\naries also played a crucial role in spreading the subprime crisis. As a consequence\nthere are growing demands for a stronger regulation of liquidity risk, in particular\nfor higher regulatory liquidity requirements for banks.\nHowever, from an academic perspective it is far from clear whether a higher\nregulatory liquidity ratio is indeed preferable or not. One main perspective taken\nin the literature for instance argues that banking crises are mainly driven by bad\nfundamentals or bad performance of banks. Although banks' liquidity transforma-\ntion increases the destabilizing eect of a bad performance, it is exactly this greater\nfragility which serves as an important device to discipline the bank management\naccording to this view. Only the threat that a bad performance leads to massive\nliquidity outows, to a crisis at the respective bank and ultimately to a job loss\nincentivizes the bank management to do the best they can to improve the bank's\nperformance. A high regulatory liquidity holding undermines this threat and pre-\ndominantly impairs banks' eciency.\nAn opposing view suggests that a higher liquidity ratio can reduce destabilizing\nself-enforcing eects. The larger the liquidity transformation of a nancial interme-\ndiary (the more illiquid and long-term the assets relative to the liabilities) the larger\nthe fear of investors that the long-term return of their claims is reduced by a large\nscale withdrawal by other investors. Accordingly, if investors expect massive with-\ndrawals by others, they have a strong incentive to withdraw their funds themselves.\nThe expectations of a (liquidity) crisis become self-fullling. A higher liquidity ratio\ncontains these self-enforcing crisis moments and fosters funds' stability.\nThis paper tries to assess the explanatory power of these two contrasting views.\nIn doing so it analyzes the liquidity stance of German open-end real estate funds.\nCompared to banks these nancial intermediaries are far less regulated. Therefore,\nthey are much better suited to identify and study the described mechanisms. Even\nthough they are less regulated open-end real estate funds perform a liquidity trans-\nformation which is very similar to those of banks: They guarantee the redemption of\nshares of any volume at a price which reects the discounted expected earnings and\nnot the market value of their assets and which adapts only staggeringly to changing\nmarket conditions. Thus while funds' assets - predominantly commercial real estate\n- are fairly illiquid, their liabilities are very liquid.\nThe present paper uses a unique data set that contains balance sheet information,\nperformance and liquidity status on an individual fund basis from mid 1993 to mid\nopen-end fund industry was suering from a severe credibility crisis which lead to\nmassive liquidity outows. This permits us to also study to what extend the relative\nimportance of the two mechanisms shifts from non-crisis to crisis times. Thus we\ncan analyze whether poor performance or expected withdrawals of other investors\nwere more important for liquidity outows in crisis or in non-crisis periods.\nOur results show that in non-crisis periods a fund's outows are driven by both\nits past performance and its liquidity ratios. Thus in tranquil periods both mecha-\nnisms play a role: By withdrawing their funds in response to bad past performance\ninvestors discipline on the one hand fund managers since managers remuneration\ndeclines as the fund volume drops. Furthermore, a declining liquidity ratio increases\nthe likelihood of a future closure of the fund together with a job loss of the man-\nager. On the other hand liquidity outow is particularly high at funds with a low\nliquidity ratio. This suggests that investors tend to redeem their shares at funds\nwith a low liquidity ratio if they expect or observe a given liquidity outow. In the\ncrisis period, however only the latter eect remains signicant. During the panic\ninvestors only responded to the threat of a liquidity shortage of their funds resulting\nexpected withdrawals. They did not respond to past performance in that phase.\nConsequently, our results suggest that a higher regulatory liquidity ratio would in-\ncrease crisis resilience of open-end real estate funds without undermining essential\ndisciplining mechanisms of the fund management. The disciplining of the manage-\nment through investors withdrawals is mainly ensured in non-crises periods and does\nnot work through the threat of a liquidity driven fund closure.\nA further important result of the present study relates to load fees in channel-\ning liquidity outows. We nd that in non-crisis periods a higher load fee results\nin lower liquidity outows. This seems to be in line with intuition, since the load\nfee has a xed cost character. A fund with a lower load fee should therefore at-\ntract predominantly investors with a shorter investment horizon which implies that\nholding the fund's volume constant gross outows must be larger at any point in\ntime. However, in the crisis period we nd a strong positive relation between the\nthe load fee and fund gross outows. This could reect the involvement of institu-\ntional investors in German open-end real estate funds. In particular during the low\ninterest rate phase prior to our crisis period institutional investors used open-end\nreal estate funds to park liquidity at a comparably high yield. Given their relative\nshort investment horizon they likely invested predominately in funds that charged a\nlow load fee. Thus our positive relation between the load fee and the gross outows\nin the crisis period could be seen as an indicator for a stabilizing role of institu-\ntional investors. This would be in line with recent theoretical ndings which argue\nthat large institutional investors are less driven by expectations of the withdrawing\ndecisions of other investors and therefore help contain self-enforcing crisis eects.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nLiquidit\u00e4tsrisiken sind, wenn nicht als Ausgangspunkt, so doch zumindest als Ver-\nst\u00e4rkungseekt f\u00fcr Finanzkrisen von zentraler Bedeutung. Auch f\u00fcr die Ausbreitung\nder Subprimekrise war das Liquidit\u00e4tsrisiko verschiedenster Finanzintermedi\u00e4re ent-\nscheidend. Daher wurden in Folge der weltweiten Wirtschafts- und Finanzkrise ver-\nschiedentlich Forderungen noch einer st\u00e4rkeren Regulierung der Liquidit\u00e4tsrisiken\nund insbesondere nach einer h\u00f6heren regulatorischen Liquidit\u00e4tshaltung seitens der\nBanken laut.\nAus wissenschaftlicher Sicht ist es allerdings alles andere als eindeutig, ob tat-\ns\u00e4chlich eine h\u00f6here geforderte Liquidit\u00e4tsquote f\u00fcr Banken sinnvoll ist. Eine der\nwesentlichen Sto\u00ffrichtungen der Literatur zeigt beispielsweise, dass Bankenkrisen\nvor allem durch eine schlechte Ertragslage bedingt werden. Eine Liquidit\u00e4tstrans-\nformation f\u00fchrt dieser Denkrichtung zu folge zwar zu einer st\u00e4rkeren Destabilisierung\nim Falle einer schlechten Rentabilit\u00e4t, diese ist aber als Disziplinierungsinstrument\ngegen\u00fcber dem Bankmanagement elementar. Nur die Angst, dass eine schlechte Er-\ntragsentwicklung zu massivem Liquidit\u00e4tsabuss, zu einer Krise der Bank und damit\nletztlich u.U. zum Jobverlust f\u00fchrt, stellt sicher, dass das Management auch alles\ntut, um eine gute Ertragsentwicklung zu garantieren. Eine h\u00f6here Liquidit\u00e4tsquote\nunterminiert diesen Eekt und f\u00fchrt demnach vor allem zu inezienteren Banken.\nEine kontr\u00e4re Sichtweise legt dagegen nahe, dass eine h\u00f6here Liquidit\u00e4tsquote de-\nstabilisierende und sich selbst verst\u00e4rkende Eekte eind\u00e4mmen kann. Je h\u00f6her die\nLiquidit\u00e4tstransformation eines Finanzintermedi\u00e4rs (je illiquider/langfristiger seine\nVerm\u00f6genswerte relativ zu seinen Verbindlichkeiten) umso gr\u00f6\u00ffer die Angst der In-\nvestoren, dass die langfristigen Ertr\u00e4ge ihrer Titel durch den fr\u00fchzeitigen Abzug\nvon Mitteln durch andere Investoren beeintr\u00e4chtigt werden. Bef\u00fcrchten Investoren\ndemnach einen massiven Mittelabzug, so haben sie selbst auch ein Anreiz ihre Mittel\nzur\u00fcck zu fordern. Die Erwartungen einer (Liquidit\u00e4ts-) Krise werden demnach sich\nselbsterf\u00fcllend. Eine h\u00f6here Liquidit\u00e4tsquote kann diese sich selbst verst\u00e4rkenden\nMomente einer Krise eind\u00e4mmen und so zur Stabilisierung beitragen.\nDas vorliegende Papier versucht den Erkl\u00e4rungsgehalt dieser beiden kontr\u00e4ren\nSichtweisen empirisch abzuw\u00e4gen. Dabei analysiert es nicht die Liquidit\u00e4tssituation\nvon Banken, sondern untersucht den Liquidit\u00e4tsabuss oener Immobilienfonds in\nDeutschland. Im Gegensatz zu Banken sind diese Finanzintermedi\u00e4re weit weniger\nreguliert, so dass die Wirkungsweise der beschriebenen Mechanismen besser nach-\nvollzogen werden kann. Dar\u00fcber hinaus weisen oene Immobilienfonds aber eine\n\u00e4hnliche Liquidit\u00e4tstransformation wie Banken auf: Sie garantieren die jederzeitige\nR\u00fccknahme von Anteilscheinen in jeder H\u00f6he zu einem Preis, der den Ertragswert\nund nicht den Marktwert der Assets reektiert und der sich nur verz\u00f6gert an ver-\n\u00e4nderte Marktsituationen anpasst. D.h., die Verbindlichkeiten der Fonds sind sehr\nliquide, w\u00e4hrend die Aktivseite mit Gewerbeimmobilien weitgehend illiquide ist.\nDie Untersuchung baut auf einem einzigartigen Datensatz auf, der die Bilanz,\nLiquidit\u00e4tssituation und Ertragslage jedes einzelnen deutschen oenen Immobilien-\neiner massiven Vertrauenskrise ein, die um die Jahreswende 2005/2006 zu massiven\nLiquidit\u00e4tsab\u00fcssen aus diesem Fondsegment f\u00fchrte. Dies erlaubt es uns, auch zu\nuntersuchen, wie bedeutsam die beiden Mechanismen in Krisen- und Nichtkrisenpe-\nrioden sind d.h. inwieweit schlechte Ertragsentwicklung oder erwartete Mittelabz\u00fcge\nanderer Investoren f\u00fcr die Mittelab\u00fcsse in Krisen- relativ zu Nichtkrisenphasen ver-\nantwortlich sind.\nDie Ergebnisse zeigen, dass der Mittelabuss in Nichtkrisenphasen, sowohl von\nder vergangenen Ertragsentwicklung als auch von der Liquidit\u00e4tsausstattung des je-\nweiligen Fonds abh\u00e4ngt. Demnach spielen in ruhigeren Perioden beide Eekte ein\nRolle: Indem sie mit Mittelabz\u00fcgen auf eine schlechte Ertragsentwicklung reagieren,\ndisziplinieren Anleger einerseits das Fondmanagement: Bei einem geringen Fondvolu-\nmen sinkt die volumenabh\u00e4ngige Verg\u00fctungskomponente. Au\u00fferdem k\u00f6nnte durch\nr\u00fcckl\u00e4uge Liquidit\u00e4t, eine Schlie\u00ffung und damit ein Jobverlust wahrscheinlicher\nwerden. Andererseits ist aber der Mittelabuss bei Fonds mit geringer Liquidit\u00e4ts-\nausstattung besonders hoch. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass Anleger bei einem Fond\nmit geringer Liquidit\u00e4tsausstattung eher ihre Anteile zur\u00fcckgeben, wenn sie einen\nMittelabuss beobachten bzw. erwarten. In der Krisenphase geht dagegen nur von\nder Liquidit\u00e4tsausstattung ein signikanter Eekt auf den Mittelabuss aus. W\u00e4h-\nrend der Panik scheinen Anleger in ihrem Abzugsverhalten alleine auf eine m\u00f6gliche\nIlliquidit\u00e4t infolge der erwarteten Ab\u00fcsse reagiert zu haben und nicht nach der\nvergangen Ertragsentwicklung der Fonds dierenziert zu haben. Unsere Ergebnisse\nzeigen somit, dass eine h\u00f6here regulatorische Liquidit\u00e4tsquote die oenen Immobili-\nenfonds krisenfester macht, ohne essentielle Disziplinierungsmechanismen gegen\u00fcber\ndem Fondmanagement auszuhebeln. Die Disziplinierung des Managements \u00fcber das\nAbzugsverhalten, scheint vor allem in Nichtkrisenperioden eine Rolle zu spielen und\nhier nicht \u00fcber die illiquidit\u00e4tsbedingte Fondschlie\u00ffung zu wirken.\nEin weiteres interessantes Ergebnis der vorliegenden Studie bezieht sich auf den\nAusgabeaufschlag und dessen Eekt auf die Mittelab\u00fcsse. In Nichtkrisenphasen\ngeht ein h\u00f6herer Ausgabeaufschlag mit geringen Mittelab\u00fcssen einher. Da der Aus-\ngabeaufschlag einen Fixkostencharakter hat, erscheint es auch logisch, dass ein Fond\nmit geringerem Aufschlag insbesondere Investoren mit k\u00fcrzerfristigem Investitions-\nhorizont attrahiert und somit bei gleichem Volumen zu jedem Zeitpunkt h\u00f6here Ab-\n\u00fcsse hat. Interessanterweise ist aber in der Krisenphase der Zusammenhang signi-\nkant positiv: Mit h\u00f6herem Ausgabeaufschlag steigt der Mittelabuss. Dies k\u00f6nnte\nauf den Einuss institutioneller Investoren zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren sein. Diese parkten wohl\ngerade in der Niedrigzinsphase vor der Krisenperiode umfangreich Liquidit\u00e4t in oe-\nnen Immobilienfonds. Aufgrund ihres eher kurzfristigen Anlagehorizonts d\u00fcrften sie\ndabei eher Fonds mit geringem Ausgabeaufschlag bevorzugt haben. Insofern w\u00fcrde\nder positive Zusammenhang zwischen Ausgabeaufschlag und Mitteabuss auf eine\nstabilisierende Rolle institutioneller Investoren hinweisen und damit j\u00fcngste theore-\ntische Ans\u00e4tze best\u00e4tigen. Diese argumentieren, dass gro\u00ffe institutionelle Investoren\nweniger vom Verhalten der anderen Fondeigner und ihren Erwartung hier\u00fcber ge-\ntrieben sind und somit sich selbst verst\u00e4rkende Kriseneekte eind\u00e4mmen.\nContents\n2 Related Literature 4\n3 Background on open end real estate funds in Germany and the\nList of Tables\n1 Summary Statistics of Key Variables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n2 Fixed Eects Estimation for Outows: Pre-Crisis Period, Monthly\n3 Fixed Eects Estimation for Outows: Crisis Period, Daily Data from\n4 Fixed Eects Estimation for Outows: Post Crisis Period, Daily Data\nList of Figures\n1 Open Real-Estate Funds: Volume in bill. of Euro (rhs) and y-o-y\n2 Open Real-Estate Funds: Monthly Flows in % of Fund Volume, 1993-\n2007 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n3 Open Real-Estate Funds: Daily Flows in mill. of Euro, 15th of\nThe dark and the bright side of liquidity risks:\nEvidence from open-end real estate funds in\n1 ",

However, there are two opposing\nviews on the origin of nancial crises which lead to two contrasting perceptions\nof liquidity risks. According to the fundamental view banking crises are triggered\nby low asset returns.2 Responding to bad performance by massive withdrawals\ndepositors exert control over the bank management. Therefore this view emphasizes\nthe bright side of liquidity mismatch: It is an important incentive device.3 In\ncontrast, following the panic view the crises of nancial institutions result from\nstrategic complementarities that arise from the liquidity mismatch. If the assets\nof a nancial institution are less liquid than their liabilities, investors prefer to\nwithdraw their funds prematurely or refuse to rollover short-term claims if they\nexpect other investors to do the same.4 Thus liquidity risk also has a dark side in\nthat it generates a self-enforcing momentum to banking crisis that can also lead to\nthe failure of solvent banks.\nUnderstanding the relative importance of these two views is crucial because they\nhave opposing implications for regulation. While a binding regulatory liquidity\nholding would undermine the disciplinary role of the liquidity transformation, it\nwould clearly contain the self-enforcing momentum of crisis and reduce the risk of\ninecient liquidations of banks.\n1Falko Fecht (falko.fecht@ebs.edu) and Michael Wedow (michael.wedow@bundesbank.de). We\nare grateful to Itay Goldstein and Marcel Tyrell for helpful comments and suggestions. We thank\nMichael Halling and participants for comments received at the FMA 2008 meeting. The paper\nrepresents the authors' personal opinions and not necessarily those of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nAll remaining errors are of course our own.\n2Theoretical models taking this perspective are, for instance, Gorton (1985) and Allen and Gale\n(1998). Empirical studies suggesting that banking crises are driven by business cycle downturns\n3This argument is modeled, for instance, in Calomiris and Kahn (1991) and Diamond and Rajan\n4This is the view taken in the classical work by Bryant (1980) and Diamond and Dybvig (1983).\nIn this paper we therefore try to assess the relative importance of these two views\nby studying their respective explanatory power for a crisis that hit the German open\nend real estate fund industry by the end of 2005 and in the early 2006. During this\ncrisis the instability of one fund spread to the whole industry and lead to massive\nliquidity outows. Open end real estate funds are relatively unregulated in Germany\nbut nevertheless provide a signicant liquidity transformation. Thus compared to\nstudies that focus on the relatively regulated banking sector this crisis episode in\nGermany is much better suited to tell apart the two opposing views.5 Our data\nset comprises detailed balance sheet information for each individual German fund,\nits returns, the fees charged, and its liquidity outow before, during, and after the\ncrisis.\nOur results show that investors' withdrawal decisions are driven by past returns\nbefore and to some extent also directly after the crisis. However, past performance\ndoes not have any explanatory power for the liquidity outows during the crisis.\nThis suggests that during the crisis investors did not dierentiate between well and\nbadly managed funds. Investors did not use their withdrawal decision to exert\ncontrol over the fund management. On the contrary, the sizeable explanatory power\nof funds' liquidity for their outows in particular during the crisis suggests that\ninvestors more or less only responded in the crisis to strategic complementarities.\nThus while in more tranquil periods withdrawals might fulll their disciplinary role\nand complementarities are of minor importance, during the crisis the self-enforcing\nelements put forward by the panic view seem to be prevailing. This suggests that\nthere are signicant non-linearities involved in the role of complementarities and\nthat studies that try to assess the importance of complementarities during tranquil\ntimes might be misleading.6\nThis view is also supported by our results on the impact of the regional scope of\nthe funds. The troubled fund that triggered the crisis was only invested in German\nreal estate. Furthermore, the ailing German economy depressed German real estate\ninvestment returns by that time. However, our results indicate that during the crisis\n5For a recent study that tries to assess the disciplinary role of demand deposits in banking see\n6See Chen et al. (2007) for a recent study that assesses the role of complementarities in the\nU.S. mutual fund market during normal times.\noutows of funds that were only invested in Germany did not signicantly vary from\noutows at internationally invested funds based in Germany. This suggests that\nthe investors' run was not simply a response to revised expectations about future\nA further interesting result concerns the role of load fees. Since load fees have\nxed cost character one would expect that investors are willing to pay higher load\nfee the longer their investment horizon. For the pre-crisis period as well as for the\npost-crisis period we nd that indeed gross outows are smaller the larger the load\nfee suggesting that indeed the average investment horizon of investors is larger the\nlarger the load fee. However, during the crisis period we nd a strong positive eect\nof the load fee on outows. Thus larger load fees and longer average investment\nhorizons do not keep investors from running. Quite the contrary, investors with\nshorter investment horizons seem to have a stabilizing eect. This might be related\nto the role of large investors in panics and the fact that institutional investors used\non a large scale open end real estate funds to park liquidity. As shown in recent the-\noretical work by Corsetti et al. (2001) and Bannier (2005) large investors internalize\npart of the complementarities and therefore respond less to their expectations about\nthe behavior of other investors. Thus instead of herding they react more on fun-\ndamentals and thereby limit the destabilizing eect of strategic complementarities.\nConsequently, if institutional investors had relatively short investment horizons (be-\ncause they only wanted to park liquidity) they likely preferred those funds with low\nload fees. This in turn stabilized those funds' outows during the panic. In order to\nnd more evidence for this reasoning, we also use some low frequency data on the\ninvestor structure of the individual real estate funds. However, here we do not nd\nany systematic inuence of the fraction of fund shares held by retail investors and\noutows.\n7This also means that we do not nd evidence for the informational contagion put forward by\n2 Related Literature\nOur paper is related to several strands of the literature. Most importantly, as already\ndiscussed in the introduction our paper contributes to the debate about the origins\nof nancial crises. It tries to shed some light on the explanatory power of the two\nopposing views: the fundamental view and the panic view on nancial crisis as\ncontrasted, for instance, in Allen and Gale (2007).\nThe main theoretical contribution modeling the fundamental view is Allen and\nGale (1998) who argue that bank runs are a result of weakened banks' return on\nassets in a business cycle downturn. This view is supported by the empirical study\nof Gorton (1998) who nds that historically bank runs are predictable using business\ncycle data. Calomiris and Mason (1997) nd empirical support that individual bank\nfailures were strongly correlated with bad aggregate and individual fundamentals\nduring the great depression. Our paper contrasts with their results since we do not\nnd any evidence that fundamentals help explain the massive withdrawals of funds\nin the crisis. Neither past performance nor geographical investment scope seems\nto have an inuence on investors' withdrawal decision. From that perspective our\npaper also tests the theoretical arguments put forward by Chari and Jagannathan\n(1988) and Chen (1999) who argue that a run results if investors update their return\nexpectations of their bank when observing another bank with a similar portfolio\nfailing. In the case of the German open end real estate funds the fund that initially\nfailed was only invested in Germany. However, investors ran also on those funds\nthat were globally or Europe wide invested.\nThese results are also related to Calomiris and Kahn (1991) and Diamond and\nRajan (2001). They argue that the liquidity risk generated by the maturity trans-\nformation serves as a disciplinary device. The threat of a run is necessary to ensure\nthat managers of nancial institutions behave and contribute to a high return. But\neven though managers might behave in equilibrium, bad luck might lead to low\nreturns which trigger a run. Given that we do not nd any signicant inuence\nof fundamental factors on the cross-sectional distribution of liquidity outows, our\nresults do not conrm the view that panics are a measure to exert control. In-\nvestors in German open end real estate funds did not dierentiate between funds\naccording to their past performance during the crisis. However, in more tranquil\nperiods investors respond signicantly to past performance. Thus to that end our\npaper conrms the ndings of a vast literature that indicates that open-end mutual\nfund investors use past performance as a screening and monitoring device for fund\nnd evidence that mutual fund ows are positively related to past performance. At\nthe same time, though, Edelen (1999) nds evidence that unexpected ows force\nfund managers into detrimental liquidity trades and impair funds' performance.8\nThe panic view which goes back to the path breaking work by Bryant (1980) and\nDiamond and Dybvig (1983) emphasizes that strategic complementarities between\nthe withdrawal decision of depositors arises because the withdrawal of other deposi-\ntors reduces the expected repayment that a single depositor can realize if he refrains\nfrom withdrawing. These complementarities in depositors' strategies can generate\na coordination failure and lead to a bank run. The problem with this multiple\nequilibria view is that the crises are completely unrelated to economic fundamen-\ntals. The literature on global games following Carlsson and van Damme (1993)\nand Morris and Shin (1998) shows that the multiplicity of equilibria does not oc-\ncur when investors have slightly heterogenous beliefs about economic fundamentals\nwhile strategic complementarities still prevail. Goldstein and Pauzner (2005) apply\nthis approach to depository institutions and nd that due to the strategic comple-\nmentarities among depositors marginal changes in fundamentals can lead to a panic\nand to a sudden increase in withdrawals. Using the liquidity ratio and the interac-\ntion between the liquidity ratio and the past performance as explanatory variables\nfor the outows permits us to study the role that these strategic complementarities\nplayed in the crisis. If a fund has a high liquidity ratio even large redemptions by\ninvestors (triggered by the crisis of other funds or by deteriorating past performance)\ndo not necessarily have a negative eect on the future redemption rate. From this\nperspective our paper is also related to the empirical work by Chen et al. (2007).\nUsing US mutual funds data they show that indeed the liquidity outows are more\nsensitive to bad performance in funds that hold less liquid assets. In contrast to our\n8The results by Jank and Wedow (2008) also conrm that performance drives ows into funds\nbut that enhancing performance may also make funds more vulnerable when market liquidity dries\nup.\npaper, the period they study is a relatively tranquil period without any substantial\nturmoil in asset markets. But by their very nature strategic complementarities are\nmore important in periods of crises such as the one considered in our paper. And\nour results show indeed that studying complementarities during tranquil periods\ndoes not provide a full picture of their importance. While complementarities seem\nto amplify withdrawals in response to bad performance in non-crises periods, the\npurely self-enforcing mechanisms are much more important during crises.\nOne way to contain the liquidity risk and its adverse eect on funds' performance\nis to charge a high load fee and thereby attract rather long-term oriented investors.\nThis argument has been formally modeled, for instance, by Nanda et al. (2000).\nSimilar to our results Chordia (1996) nds that indeed load fees dissuade investors\nwith large liquidity risks from short-term investment and redemption. However, an\nissue that has not been addressed in the literature so far is, to what extent these\nmechanisms still work during panics, i.e. whether investors still care about the\npaid load fee during panics or whether investors with dierent investment horizon\nrespond dierently if they anticipate large scale redemptions of other investors with\nits negative eect on performance.\nThe application of global games to nancial crisis has also shown that com-\nplementarities and the resulting amplication of crises can be mitigated by large\ninvestors. Given their larger average size institutional investors know that it is\nlikely that their decision is pivotal for the default of the nancial institution. Thus\nthey tend to internalize the implication of their own decision, do not rely too much\non their expectations about the decision of others and therefore contribute to more\nresilient nancial institutions. This was rst pointed out by Corsetti et al. (2001)\nin the context of currency crises.9 Chen et al. (2007) present a formal model of this\nargument for mutual funds and test it for US open end mutual funds. They nd\nthat funds primarily held by institutional investors suer less from eects induced\nby complementarities than mutual funds. While our direct low frequency measure\nof the share of institutional investors does not indicate any signicant eect on out-\nows during the crisis, the impact of the load fee might actually capture this eect.\nRelated is also the study of Del Guercio and Tkac (2002) and James and Karceski\n9See also Bannier (2005) for the role of informational advantages of institutional investors in\nthis reasoning.\n(2006) who show that the involvement of institutional investors seems to contribute\nto a better screening and monitoring of mutual funds. Funds with a larger share\nheld by institutional investors tend to perform better.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 3 presents a short\ninstitutional description of the German open end real estate fund industry and gives\nsome background information on the crisis. In section 4 we describe our data set\nand in section 5 our estimation approach. Section 6 gives the results and section 7\ndraws some conclusions.\n3 Background on open end real estate funds in Ger-\nOpen-end real estate funds are the most important retail investment vehicle for real\nestate in Germany.10 In 2007 these funds managed in total about 85 bn Euro which\namounted to roughly 10% of German investment funds' assets.\nCompared with other retail nancial institutions open-end real estate funds are\nrelatively unregulated.11 Open-end real estate funds are obliged to hold between\n5% and 49% of their assets in liquid reserves, i.e. cash and securities. When liquid\nreserves drop below 5% the management of the fund has the option to suspend\nredemption. During this period the fund has to obtain additional resources by\nliquidating some assets or by increasing his debt ratio. To do so the fund can\nsuspend redemption up to two years. However, up to 2005 no fund ever had to\nresort to this measure. The book value of the real estate held by funds is assessed\nby external experts once a year based on the expected future return on these assets.\nTo avoid large jumps in the book value a 12th of the real estate is evaluated every\nmonth. Together with liquid reserves these book values are the basis for the quoted\nredemption price.\nWhile in most other countries open-end real estate funds disappeared, often as a\n10This section gives only a brief overview of the institutional background and of the crisis.

Between 1993\nand 2003 capital invested in these fund more than quintupled, whereby particularly\nin the aftermath of the stock market downturn in 2001 large amounts of capital\new into open-end real estate funds (see Figure 1). However, starting in 2004 fund\nvolumes stagnated. At the same time the anyway rather low but very stable returns\nof these funds reached a historical low and continued to decline. Withdrawal of funds\nat individual open-end real estate funds started and triggered a liquidity shortage,\nfor instance, at the fund managed by the investment company owned by DekaBank,\nHypoVereinsbank, and Commerzbank. In all cases, however, the banks stepped in\nand provided liquidity often by buying up shares or real estate from their respective\nfunds.\nFigure 1: Open Real-Estate Funds: Volume in bill. of Euro (rhs) and y-o-y Return\nD\nM\nO\nM\nN\nD\nM\nO\nM\nN\nD\nM\nO\nM\nN\nVolume Weighted Return Fund Volume\nOn December 11, 2005, Deutsche Bank announced that an unscheduled reevalua-\ntion of its biggest ($7.2 billion) real estate fund, Grundbesitz Invest, was unavoidable\nand would very likely lead to a devaluation of the redemption price. This lead to a\ndramatic withdrawal of funds not only from Grundbesitz Invest but also from most\nother German open-end real estate funds. At Grundbesitz Invest this run absorbed\nmost of the fund's liquidity. Since Deutsche Bank refused to provide additional\nliquidity, redemption had to be suspended on 13th of December, 2005. Yet the\ndramatic liquidity outow continued at other funds (see gure 2).\nN\nD\nM\nO\nM\nN\nD\nM\nO\nM\nN\nD\nM\nO\nM\nInflow Netflow Outflow\nOn January, 17th and 19th two additional funds managed by investment com-\npany KanAm had to be closed after a rating agency set their recommendation on\nsell.12 Given the already alarmed investors the sell recommendation accelerated\nthe liquidity outow leading ultimately to the closure of the two funds and a re-\nnewed upsurge of outows in other funds (see in particular gure 3). The following\n12The decision of the rating agency was primarily based on a link of the investment company\nwith a partner in the US which the rating agency argued would trigger a run on the fund and thus\nthe suspension of convertibility.\nmonths saw a decline in aggregate outows which were only shortly interrupted by\nthe reopening of the 3 previously closed funds.13 Net ows again turned positive by\naround June 2006 and have since largely remained on this shore.\nFigure 3: Open Real-Estate Funds: Daily Flows in mill. of Euro, 15th of Dec.2005\nCash Outflow Cash Inflow Netflow\n4 The Data\nThe data used in the analysis comes from three dierent data bases of the Bundes-\nbank which each oer a dierent observation frequency. First, our data set contains\ndaily data on the the liquidity status of each individual open-end real estate fund in\nGermany. This daily data was collected as a consequence of the ongoing diculties\nof the German open-end real estate funds at the end of 2005. The data comprise\n13DB Grundbesitz Invest restarted redemption of shares on the 3rd of March, KanAm Grund-\ninvest on the 31th of March and KanAm US-Grundinvest on the 13th of April. Further peaks in\nFigure 3 are due to sales of shares by banks which supported funds.\ninformation therein includes in- and outows as well as the liquidity position of 33\nup to 39 funds.14 The number of reporting funds varies given that three funds were\ntemporarily closed down during the crisis and because ve additional funds started\nreporting which were issued in the second half of 2006.\nSecond, the Bundesbank collects monthly data on a range of balance sheet items\nfor real estate funds covering also information on the Load Fee, Debt, Liquidity and\nSize of each fund.15 We use this data in our analysis of the pre-crisis period. The\ndata also contains a 12-month rolling Return for each fund adjusted for dividends\nand net of management fee. This relatively large rolling window appears warranted\ngiven the large persistence of returns.16\nThird, data on the involvement of households measured by the percentage of\ntotal outstanding shares held by households on a quarterly basis are added. This\ndata is covered by the variable Private.\nFinally, we add variables containing information on the geographic focus and age\nin years for each fund. The geographic focus is given by a dummy variable equal to\n1 if a fund's majority of investments is located in Germany. A further dummy (Non-\nRetail) was added for funds that are not truly mutual funds. A number of mutual\nfunds have high minimum investment requirements or are only accessible for certain\ntypes of institutional investors. We therefore include a dummy for Non-Retail Fund\nequal to one if a fund stipulates such requirements which limit the accessibility by\nretail investors.\nTable 1 contains summary statistics for key variables and Table 5 the correlation\nmatrix.\n14The outow of funds is given by the value of actual share redemptions and excludes dividend\npayments. This is particulary important for open real estate funds since that they are obliged by\nlaw to pay out 90 % of any capital gains.\n15The load fee is calculated on the basis of the dierence between issue and redemption price\nand is expressed as a ratio over the redemption price. In the empirical analysis, we use the load\nfee lagged by one month.\n16Calculation is based on the Bundesverband Investment and Asset Management e.V (BVI).\nTable 1: Summary Statistics of Key Variables\nVariable Obs Mean Std. Dev. Min Max\nPrivate Investors is the share of private investors in a fund. Outow (Netow) ratio is the absolute outow\n(netow) over the volume of the fund. The 12-month return is a 12-month rolling return for any given\nmonth. The liquidity ratio is given by the ratio of liquid assets over the volume of the fund. The debt ratio\nis given by total debt over the volume of the fund. The load fee is the dierence between issue and\nredemption price as a ratio of the redemption price. Age is given in years since establishment of the fund.\nGeo. Focus is a dummy equal to one if a fund's assets are predominantly located in Germany. Non-retail\nfund is a dummy equal to one if a fund has investor restrictions in place.\n5 Regression Analysis\nSince we are interested in explaining the relative liquidity shock of the open-end\nreal estate funds we use as endogenous variable the Euro value of outow of each\nfund divided by its size, i.e. its balance sheet total in Euro. We also normalize the\nliquidity and the debt of each fund by dividing it by the size of the respective fund\nto get the liquidity and debt ratio. Return is given by the rolling 12-month return\nand measured in per cent. The load fee is calculated as the dierence between the\nissue and redemption price and is given as ratio over the redemption price. In order\nto avoid any bias as result of endogeneity we use lagged values for all our right hand\nside variables.\nWe estimate the gross outows separately for the pre-crisis, crisis, and post-\ncrisis period. We do so for two reasons: Firstly, studying the dierent periods\nseparately allows us to see whether investors' motives for withdrawing their funds\nvaries between crises and non-crises times. In particular this permits us to study\nwhether complementarities become more severe in crises periods. Secondly, the crisis\nlasted only ve months. Thus using monthly data does not allow us to develop a\ndetailed picture of the crisis period. Using the daily data we are able to give a much\nmore clear cut analysis of the crisis. However, using data at dierent frequencies\nfor the dierent periods apparently limits the comparability of the results across\nperiods.\nConsequently, for the pre-crisis period for which we dispose only of monthly data\nwe estimate the following equation:\nOutflowi,m\nSizei,m\nReturni,m-1\nLiquidityi,m-1\nSizei,m\nSizei,m\nLoad Feei,m-1\n+...+ i,m\n.\nWe try to explain the relative outow of fund i in month m by fund i's past\nreturn, liquidity ratio, and load fee etc. in that respective month.\nFor the crisis and post-crisis period we have daily data available. For those two\nperiods our specication is\nOutflowi,t\nSizei,m\nReturni,m-1\nLiquidityi,t-1\nSizei,m\nSizei,m\nLoad Feei,m-1\n+...+ i,t\n.\nwhere Outow and Liquidity is given for each fund i on day t. Return, Debt\nand Load Fee are also for these periods given at a monthly frequency. represents\nthe error term, where we assume i,t\n iid(0, 2), is independent. We focus on\noutows instead of net ows for three reasons. First, from the theoretical perspective\ncomplementarities are relevant for outows only. Secondly, as Figure 2 shows the\nbehavior of in- and outows dier widely. Third and related there is the potential\nthat banks provided support to open-end real estate funds thus leading to a bias in\nactual ows.\nWe primarily rely on the xed eects estimator since this estimator will be con-\nsistent in the presence of any correlation between the explanatory variables and the\nxed eect but also show the results for the random eects estimator. Irrespective\nof the estimator the direction of the eects remain largely unchanged.\nOur rst set of estimations covers the pre-crisis period from April 1994 to November\n2005 using the available monthly data. The estimation results are reported in table\n2. Each column reports the results for an estimation of funds' outow and gives the\ncoecients of the explanatory variable in the respective row. The absolute value of\nthe respective z-statistics are reported in brackets below each coecient.\nMost importantly is the negative eect of past returns on gross outows. Thus\nfundamentals matter for withdrawal decisions. Withdrawals at a specic fund are\nthe higher the worse the past performance of that respective fund was. This also\nconrms our hypothesis that investors' withdrawal decisions serves as a disciplining\ndevice. If fund managers know that a low performance induces larger outows\nthey have stronger incentives to ensure a high return because their remuneration is\ntypically related to the volume of funds under management. Furthermore, due to the\nliquidity transformation higher liquidity outows depress future returns since fund\nmanagers might be forced into detrimental re sales or to raise debt at unfavorable\nconditions.17 So also future performance related remuneration will be reduced by\nthe withdrawals. Moreover, lower future returns increase future outow and the\nanticipation of this vicious circle can lead to a run on the fund and its closure. Also\nthis threat might have a disciplining eect on fund managers.18\nThe second evident eect that we nd is that funds that had a higher previous\nliquidity ratio experience lower outows. Since we focus here on gross outow,\ni.e. withdrawals only, our result indicates that withdrawals are larger if a fund\nholds fewer liquidity. This suggest that there are complementarities at play: At a\nfund that holds less liquidity a withdrawal of some investors will induce more other\ninvestors to withdraw, too, because the expected negative eects of the withdrawal\non future performance is larger. A higher liquidity ratio enables a fund to redeem\na larger number of shares without liquidation costs.19 However, the sensitivity of\noutows to lower returns is reduced by a higher liquidity ratio (see column 8 in table\n17See Edelen (1999) who provides direct evidence of this eect for open end mutual investment\nfunds in the U.S.\n18Martinez Peria and Schmukler (2001) nd evidence for this eect in the Latin American bank-\ning sector.\n19It might be interesting to note that a potential endogenous eect would run in opposite direc-\ntion: Funds that anticipate higher liquidity outows would hold higher liquidity ratios.\n2). Thus at funds with a high liquidity ratio the sensitivity of outows to return\nshocks was smaller. In line with the argument of the global games literature the\nresponse to bad fundamentals was less amplied by strategic complementarities at\nfunds that had a high liquidity ratio.20\nHowever, we do not nd evidence for a dampening eect of institutional in-\nvestors on outows in the pre-crisis period. The return sensitivity of open end real\nestate funds that are classied as non-retail fund is not signicantly lower than the\nsensitivity of retail funds (see column 7 in table 2).\nWith respect to the load fee our hypothesis is that a larger load fee deters\nshort-term investors. Thus the average holding period of investors should increase.\nConsequently, for a fund of given size with a larger load fee the gross outows should\nbe lower. The estimated coecients have in all cases the expected size. However,\nthey are generally not signicant.\nWe also report the results of the baseline regression using the random eects\nmodel in column 6 of table 2. Compared with the coecients of the xed eects\nmodel in column 5 the results remain stable. The Hausman test indicates for the\npre-crisis period no signicant dierence between the estimates of the two models\nwhich suggests to use the random eects results for eciency reasons.\nOur second set of estimations makes use of the daily data for the crisis period\ntable 3. While the coecient of previous returns has the expected sign, it is generally\nnot signicant for this period. During the crisis period investors seem to have paid\nless attention to funds' past performance when taking their withdrawal decisions.\nHowever, this might also reect the fact that the past return is at monthly frequency\nwhile the liquidity outow is for this period on a daily basis.\nThe liquidity ratio of the fund is available in the same frequency as the with-\ndrawals. In contrast to past returns, the liquidity status has indeed a signicant\nand relatively strong eect on the gross liquidity outow. Thus during the crisis\ninvestors withdrew their funds particularly from those funds that ran a low liquidity\nratio. This suggests that investors were driven by the concern over a liquidity crisis\n20See, for instance, Chen et al. (2007) who argue along that line.\nof funds due to excessive withdrawals. At funds with higher liquidity ratios this con-\ncern were smaller and withdrawals therefore lower. The sensitivity of outow to the\nliquidity ratio seems to have been much higher during the crisis than before indicat-\ning that indeed strategic complementarities became much more a worry in the wake\nof the panic. However, there is also a dierent interpretation of our results. The\ncrisis was triggered by the announcement of Deutsche Bank that real estate held\nby its fund had to be devaluated. Consequently, devaluation expectations might\nhave been lower at funds that held a relatively high liquidity ratio. This might also\nexplain why outows at those funds were smaller.\nIn contrast to the pre-crisis period, for the crisis period complementarities did not\namplify the liquidity drain in response to bad performance. Since past performance\ndoes apparently not explain outows during the crisis, it is not surprising that this\neect was also not amplied by complementarities. However, the signicant negative\ncoecient of the interaction term of the liquidity ratio and past performance is\npuzzling (see column 8 of table 3). According to this result funds with a high\nliquidity ratio should have a higher sensitivity of outows to past return which is at\nodds with the results from the global games literature.\nWe also included a dummy variable for the geographical focus of the fund in our\nestimations. In 2005/2006 real estate investment experienced very low returns only\nin Germany and not on a European or global level. Therefore, the devaluation and\nclosure of Deutsche Bank's fund only revealed information about the performance\nof German real estate investment. Consequently, if indeed investors updated their\nbeliefs about the future returns of real estate funds based on the closure decision of\nDeutsche Bank they would have run only on domestically invested funds. However,\nour estimations indicate that investors did not dierentiate between funds according\nto their investment scope. This further strengthens the view that it was not the more\nsevere downgrade of return expectations why investors withdrew particularly from\nfunds with a low liquidity ratio but rather the fear from more severe return eects\nof excessive withdrawal of other investors.21\n21Notice that one could also argue that a high liquidity ratio was an indication of high future\nperformance in the presence of very weak real estate returns. While this might have been true for\nsome funds that were solely invested in Germany this argument does not hold for Germany based\nfunds that were globally invested.\nThe debt ratio can be viewed as a second measure for a fund's liquidity. There\nis a regulatory upper limit imposed on the debt ratio of open-end real estate funds\nof 50 % that limits their ability to obtain liquidity when needed. Consequently,\na higher debt ratio should have a positive eect on outows. However, one may\nthink of a negative eect when renancing of real estate with debt is relatively\ncheaper. In that case a high debt ratio signals higher future returns. These two\ncounterbalancing eects might explain why we do not nd a signicant eect of the\ndebt ratio on outows during the crisis.\nInterestingly, a further robust result of our estimations indicates that the outow\nwas larger at funds that charges a higher load fee. A larger upfront fee, which also\nmeans a larger fee to reinvest in a fund, does not contain investors incentives to\nwithdraw during a run. The tilt towards longer-term investors that could supposedly\nby achieved by charging a higher load fee does not limit investors tendency to panic.\nOn the contrary, funds with a higher load fee might have attracted particularly\nsmall long-term oriented retail investors while institutional investors that are more\nconcerned with asset liquidity were deterred from buying shares. Following the\nndings of the global games literature complementarities are most severe among\nsmall retail investors, while large institutional investors contain them. This might\nexplain why the load fee did not reduce the liquidity outow but rather spurred the\nwithdrawals during the crisis.22\nTo explore this argument further we use quarterly data on the investor structure\nof the individual funds in column 9 of table 3. The ratio of shares held by of private\ninvestors permits us to study whether the coordination problem and ultimately\ncomplementarities are indeed more severe if small retail investors account for a\nlarger fraction of investors. In addition, interacting the fraction of shares held by\nprivate investors with the return also allows us to study whether the investors'\nresponse to lower past performance is more amplied by strategic complementarities\ngiven a larger fraction of small retail investors. However, neither the fraction of\nprivate investors nor its interaction with past performance has a signicant eect on\noutows according to our estimates (see column 9 and 10 in table 3). Similarly the\n22The random eects coecients are reported in column 6. The Hausman test is signicant\nwhich indicates that the coecients are inconsistent in the random eects model. We thus only\nrefer to the results of xed eect model.\ninteraction of the dummy variable for non-retail funds with the past performance\nhas no signicant impact on withdrawal decision. Thus with this lower frequency\ndata we cannot conrm the view that institutional investors stabilized the liquidity\noutow.\nIn the third set of estimations we study the post-crisis period using the data on\nthe daily liquidity outows starting on the 1st of June 2006 and show the results\nin table 4. For this period we nd only few robustly signicant determinants of the\nredemption of shares. The past return as well as the liquidity ratio have puzzlingly in\nfew estimates a positive eect on outows. However, mostly they are insignicant.\nInterestingly, when an interaction term between the liquidity ratio and the past\nperformance is included (see column 8) both past performance and the liquidity\nratio have the expected signicant negative sign. Furthermore, in this specication\nwe nd that a higher liquidity ratio dampens the eect of past performance on\noutows which is again in line with the predictions of the global games literature.\nFurther robustly signicant results for this sub-period are, rst, a negative eect\nof the load fee on outows which is again in line with the view that a high load fee\nincreases the expected investment horizon and therefore reduces the average with-\ndrawals. Second, we nd a robust negative eect of the debt ratio on the outows.\nThus withdrawals at funds with a relatively high debt ratio were lower. This might\nreect the already mentioned eect that in a low interest rate environment a high\nleverage might bring about high expected returns.\n7 Conclusion\nIn this paper we studied the outows of funds from German open-end real estate\nfunds before, during and after a crisis period in 2005 and 2006. We disentangle the\neects that contributed to these massive withdrawals. We nd that in contrast to\nthe pre-crisis period during the panic fundamentals did not matter: funds' past per-\nformance had no signicant impact on investors withdrawal decision. Furthermore,\nthe sensitivity of outows to past performance was only more severe at funds with a\nlow liquidity ratio in the pre-crisis period. But we nd that during the crisis strate-\ngic complementarities became more important for outows. Particularly during the\npanic (but also to a lesser extent in the pre-crisis period) funds with a low liquidity\nratio experienced more dramatic outows. This suggest that a main driving force of\nthe crisis were investors worries about massive withdrawals of other investors and its\ndepressing eect on future returns. Thus while our results indicate that the liquidity\ntransformation of open-end funds might serve during normal times as a disciplining\ndevice since investors respond to bad performance, during a crisis fundamentals do\nnot play a role and the liquidity risk only generates strategic complementarities and\nthe self-enforcing mechanisms leading to liquidity crisis. Thus a higher regulatory\nliquidity ratio would increase crisis resilience of open-end real estate funds with-\nout undermining essential disciplining mechanisms of the fund management. The\ndisciplining of the management through investors withdrawals is mainly ensured in\nnon-crises periods and does not work through the threat of a funds closure due to a\nliquidity shortage.\nA load fee also seems to have a positive eect on the average holding period\nof investors in normal times. It thereby contains withdrawals in non-crises peri-\nods. However, we do not nd evidence that investors with longer-term investment\nhorizons have a lower tendency to panic during a crisis. On the contrary, the load\nfee had a signicant positive eect on withdrawals during the crisis. Since particu-\nlarly institutional investors used the funds to park liquidity, they might have been\nthe share holders with the shortest investment horizon. Thus at funds with a high\nload fee only a low fraction of shares were held by institutional investors. Large\ninstitutional investors are supposed to have a stabilizing role since they contain the\namplication through strategic complementarities. Consequently, those funds that\nhad a higher load fee and thus fewer institutional investors might therefore have\nexperienced more severe outows. Hence, our ndings support the view that the\ninvolvement of institutional investors did not necessarily contribute to the severity\nof the crisis.\nA major policy implications of our results is that the suspension of convertibility\nthat is required if the liquidity ratio drops below 5% is indeed benecial. Obviously,\na mandatory minimum liquidity ratio might depress funds' returns. However, the\naverage asset returns of most open end real estate funds were not substantially above\nmoney market rates suggesting that overall fund returns were not impaired by the\nregulatory liquidity holding. Furthermore, as discussed in the paper mandatory\nliquidity holdings could in principle undermine the disciplinary role of the liquidity\ntransformation as a run never leads to a liquidation of the fund. However, according\nto our ndings investors do not respond to fundamentals during panics. They do\nnot dierentiate between funds that performed well and those that underperform.\nThus the liquidity transformation does not serve as a disciplinary device since it does\nnot amplify incentives to withdraw from ailing funds. Consequently, a mandatory\nliquidity holding cannot undermine this disciplinary eect.\nWe nd complementarities that amplify incentives to withdraw as response to\nbad performance only for non-crises period, i.e. periods when funds were not aected\nby liquidity shortages. Those complementarities might have a disciplinary eect but\nthey are not constraint by a minimum liquidity requirement.\nA suspension of convertibility triggered by a shortfall of the liquidity ratio below\nsome threshold contains, however, the complementarities that constitute to a pure\npanic. The strong response of withdrawals to actual liquidity holdings indicates that\ninvestors were particularly worried about funds' illiquidity and resulting detrimen-\ntal re sales during the crisis. This eect should be in principle eliminated by a\nsuspension of convertibility. However, a low threshold level for the liquidity ratio\ndilutes the stabilizing impact of a suspension of convertibility. Only at a relatively\nhigh threshold investors no longer need to worry that excessive withdrawals force a\nfund into detrimental re sales of assets. Thus the fact that complementarities still\nplay a prominent role at a mandatory liquidity ratio of 5% suggests that it might\nbe benecial to increases that threshold.\nOn a more general note, a higher mandatory liquidity ratio should not only\nstabilize liquidity outows it should also stabilize asset price developments. On\nthe one hand, if funds are no longer forced into detrimental re sales during crises\ndevaluations of commercial real estate should be less pronounced. On the other\nhand, if funds are forced to hold on to more liquidity when attracting new funds\nthe pace at which they can invest in new real estate is slower and the risk of the\nemergence of potential real estate bubbles is limited.\nReferences\nAllen, F. and D.
