To understand the worsening epidemiological trends of asthma, this study\nanalysed the data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) to determine the prevalence and risk factors for asthma and wheezing\namong US adults.\nThis analysis used data from 18,825 US adults aged o20 yrs who had participated in\nthe NHANES III project. After excluding subjects with physician-diagnosed emphy-\nsema, a total of 18,393 subjects were included in the final analysis.\nThe prevalence of current asthma (asthma) was 4.5% and the prevalence of wheezing\nin the previous 12 months (wheezing) was 16.4%. Mexican-Americans exhibited the\nlowest prevalence of asthma when compared with other race/ethnic groups. Multiple\nlogistic regression analysis showed that Mexican-Americans were less likely to report\nasthma when compared to non-Hispanic whites. Low education level, female sex, current\nand past smoking status, pet ownership, lifetime diagnosis of physician-diagnosed hay\nfever and obesity were all significantly associated with asthma and/or wheezing. No\nsignificant effect of indoor air pollutants, as derived from the use of household heating/\ncooking appliances, on asthma and wheezing was observed in this study.\nIn conclusion, this study observed racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of\nasthma and wheezing and identified several important risk factors that may contribute\nto development and/or exacerbation of asthma and wheezing. Contrary to earlier\nreports, the proxy measures of indoor air pollution used in this study were not found to\nbe associated with increased risk of asthma and wheezing.\n*The Texas Tech University Health Sciences\nCenter, #The University of Texas-Houston\nSchool of Public Health, TX, USA.\nCorrespondence: A.

Tortolero,\n Keywords: Asthma\nepidemiology\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey III\nThe incidence, prevalence and severity of asthma have been\nincreasing in the general population, both worldwide and in\nthe USA, for the past two decades [1]. There are y14 million\npeople in the USA suffering from asthma. The prevalence of\nself-reported asthma increased by 75% in the USA from\nreported asthma were California (7.1%) New York (6.8%)\nand Texas (6%) [2]. In the largest asthma prevalence survey\nconducted to date, the European Community Respiratory\nHealth Survey (ECRHS), an overall prevalence of 4.5%\nin adults aged 20\u00ad44 yrs was found. However, there was\nconsiderable variation among the 22 countries studied [3].\nIn the absence of any gold standard, and because of\nthe variable nature of the disease, accurate case findings of\nasthma, outside of the clinical setting, is very challenging. A\nvariety of methods have been used in epidemiological surveys\nto define asthma: self reports of physician-diagnosed asthma\n[4, 5], presence of asthma symptoms, such as wheezing [5],\ncombination of asthma symptoms, e.g. discriminate function\npredictors [5], or objective measurements like spirometry [6]\nor use of methacholine or histamine for testing bronchial\nresponsiveness [5, 7]. Each approach may lead to selection of\ndifferent study groups with asthma, thereby reporting results\nthat may not be comparable. Although, large-scale epidemio-\nlogical surveys, such as the ECRHS, have been conducted\nusing nonspecific bronchial challenge [3], the cost and techni-\ncal skills involved remain a limiting factor in their widespread\nuse. Hence, questionnaire-based self-reports of asthma remain\nthe most commonly used approach for defining asthma in\nepidemiological surveys.\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) provided a rich population-based dataset to\nidentify determinants of asthma and wheezing. This study\nanalysed the data gathered from the third, and most recent,\nround of the NHANES, to estimate the prevalence and\ndetermine the risk factors for adult asthma and wheezing in\nthis population.\nMaterials and methods\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) con-\nducts several large-scale surveys to assess the general health\nstatus of the USA9s general population. Data from the\nNHANES III, which was conducted by NCHS from 1988\u00ad\n1994, was used. Detailed descriptions of the stratified cluster\nsampling strategy have been described elsewhere [8]. This\nsurvey gathered information regarding the health status of\npreset upper age limit. In order to obtain reliable estimates of\nthe health status of different population subgroups, younger\nchildren, older persons, Mexican-Americans and African-\nAmericans were sampled in large numbers. The overall\nPrinted in UK \u00ad all rights reserved\nEuropean Respiratory Journal\nresponse rate in the NHANES III was 82% (80% for Whites,\n86% for Blacks, and 87% for Mexican-Americans) [9].\nStudy population and outcome variables\nThe analyses involved using data from the 18,825 adults\naged o20 yrs and who were interviewed in the NHANES III\nproject. In this analysis two outcome variables, asthma and\nwheezing, were used. Current asthma (asthma) was defined as\nan affirmative response to the question \"Has a doctor ever\ntold you that you had asthma?\" and \"Do you still have\nasthma?\" Wheezing was defined as an affirmative response to\nthe question \"Have you had wheezing or whistling in your\nchest at any time in the past 12 months?\" Subjects who\nresponded in the affirmative to the following question \"Has a\ndoctor ever told you that you had emphysema?\" (item\nHAC1G in NHANES III, n=432) were excluded from the\nanalysis.\nIndependent variable selection\nIndependent variables included in the analysis were selected\nbased on risk factors reported in the literature, and classified\ninto five broad conceptual categories: 1) demographic i.e. age,\nsex, race/ethnicity, urban/rural, and census region; 2) socio-\neconomic i.e. education and poverty income ratio; 3) indoor\nair quality based on the response to a limited number of\nquestions on the use of a space heater, furnace, or oven to\nheat the home; 4) allergy, hay fever; and 5) other character-\nistics i.e. smoking history, body mass index (BMI), and family\nand household size.\nStatistical analysis\nSince the NHANES III uses a complex survey design, a\nstatistical package (STATA statistical software; Stata Inc.,\nCollege Station, TX), which allows users to incorporate\nsampling weights and compute sampling variances, was used\nfor the analysis. Simple descriptive statistics were used to\ndescribe the study population, followed by univariate and\nmultivariate analyses using logistic regression to explore the\nassociation between independent variables and the outcome\nvariable. Separate univariate and multivariate models were\nbuilt using asthma and wheezing as the outcome variable. All\nvariables significant at pv0.1 were considered for inclusion in\nthe final model. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used\nto simultaneously adjust for the various independent vari-\nables. Estimated crude odds ratios (ORs), and adjusted ORs\nwith their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were\ncalculated.\nResults\nBased on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total\nanalysis. Table 1 describes the weighted percentage of the\nrespondents by selected demographic and housing-related\nvariables. The prevalence of asthma was 4.5%, while wheezing\nwas reported as 16.4%. The prevalence of asthma and wheez-\ning did not differ significantly across different age groups\n(table 2). When restricted to age group 20\u00ad44 yrs (as used in\nthe ECRHS), the prevalence of asthma was 4.7 % (95% CI\nAn estimated 11.4% of the USA population were living\nbelow poverty level and an estimated 24.7% had v12 yrs of\neducation (table 3).

No differences, however, were observed for wheez-\ning. The prevalence of asthma and wheezing did not vary\nsignificantly by region. However, when the data were stratified\nby race/ethnicity, an interesting pattern was observed. Mexican-\nAmericans living in the south region of the USA had the\nother race/ethnicity group (which included other Hispanics\nand Asian populations) had the highest prevalence in the\nand those in the Midwest exhibited the lowest prevalence\nhighest prevalence of wheezing in the Midwest region (21.7%,\nThe estimated crude and adjusted ORs with 95% CIs for\nassociations between independent risk factors and asthma and\nself-reported wheezing in the previous 12 months are pre-\nsented in table 4.

Use of a stove/oven for heating by the residence in\nthe previous 12 months showed a 45% increased odds of\nwheezing in the univariate analysis. This point estimate\ndecreased when adjusted for other variables in the final\nmodel, but was retained due to its strong univariate effect.\nThere were no significant differences in the prevalence\nof asthma and wheezing for the use of stove/ovens between\nmale and females. Owning a pet was also significant in the\nunivariate analysis, however, the effect was diluted and\nbecame nonsignificant when adjusted for other variables in\nthe model. A moderate association of BMI with wheezing was\nobserved for both underweight and obese individuals in the\nunivariate analysis. However, the OR increased significantly\nfrom 1.30 to 1.52 for obese individuals only. When stratified\nby sex, no significant differences in the prevalence of asthma\nand wheezing for obesity were observed. A strong association\nof wheezing with past and current smoking history was\nobserved in this analysis. Living below the poverty level, and\nlifetime history of hay fever were also significantly associated\nwith wheezing.\nDiscussion\nThe major strength of the present analysis is that it is\nbased on a large representative national sample of the USA\npopulation. Few population-based studies have addressed the\nprevalence of asthma among adults in the USA.\nThe results show that the prevalence of current asthma was\n4.5% and the prevalence of wheezing was 16.5%.

In the ECRHS, asthma prevalence was generally\nhigher in English-speaking countries. The median prevalence\nthan what was found in the present study. However, it is\ndifficult to directly compare prevalence rates observed in this\nstudy with other reports due to the use of different popula-\ntions and case definitions.\nThere was a significantly higher prevalence of asthma,\nbut not wheezing, among females in this study. Asthma and\nwheeze are generally reported to be higher among male\nchildren, but the trend usually reverses around puberty [3,\n12\u00ad14]. It has been suggested that the higher prevalence rates\nobserved among females could partly be due to their smaller\nairway calibre size [13]. Alternately, it may also reflect the\ntendency among physicians to diagnose a respiratory condi-\ntion as asthma in females and chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisorder (COPD) in males [10].\nContrary to earlier reports [10, 15] non-Hispanic Blacks did\nnot have a higher risk of asthma in this study. Moreover, non-\nHispanic Blacks showed less wheezing compared with non-\nHispanic Whites, and Mexican-Americans showed the lowest\nrisk of asthma and wheezing compared with the other groups.\nPrevious studies from California, New Mexico and Arizona\nhave found a lower risk of asthma and other respiratory\ndiseases among Mexican-American adults [6, 16]. Results\nfrom the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nsuggested that Puerto Rican children have the highest preval-\nence of asthma (20.1%) compared with Mexican-Americans\n(4.5%), non-Hispanic Whites (6.4%) and non-Hispanic Blacks\n(9.1%) [15]. It has been argued that the lower risk among\nMexican-Americans can be explained by differences in socio-\neconomic status (SES) and access to healthcare. However, in\nthe present study, rates remained significantly lower among\nMexican-Americans, even after controlling for SES and other\nconfounding factors.\nThere were no overall differences in prevalence of asthma\nand wheezing across regions, although a variation across\ndifferent race/ethnic groups by region was observed. Earlier\nreports indicated that the morbidity and mortality of asthma\namong Puerto Rican Hispanics is highest in the north-eastern\nfound the highest prevalence of asthma among children\nyounger than 18 yrs of age in the north-eastern region of the\nUSA [18]. This study found the highest prevalence of asthma\nwas among the other race/ethnic groups and the highest\nprevalence of wheezing among Mexican-Americans to be in\nthe north-eastern USA. In the NHANES III, Hispanics who\nwere not self-reported as Mexican-American were included in\nthe other race/ethnic groups category and these should have\nincluded Puerto Ricans. Therefore, the possibility of mis-\nclassification of Puerto Ricans as Mexican-Americans is not\nlikely to explain the high prevalence of wheezing observed in\nthis region. A variety of factors could explain the decreased\nrisk of asthma among Mexican-Americans. These include\ngenetic/biological factors, differences in health beliefs and\nbehaviours among Hispanic subgroups, protective psycho-\nsocial effects, consumption of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables,\nand differences in migration pattern, favouring a \"healthy\nThe majority of the relatively few studies that have looked\nat the relationship between asthma and poverty in adults have\nfound an association between low SES and asthma, as was the\ncase in this study. This was also true in the two previous\nrounds of the NHANES survey [4, 10, 11]. Persistent wheeze\nwas also found to be associated with poverty among children,\nbased on parental social class [20]. In contrast, MIELCK et al.\n[21] in a review of 24 studies found either no association or\nnegative association of SES with asthma. However, in their\nown study, the authors found a strong association between\nDifferences in the measurement of SES and definitions\nof poverty may be partly responsible for the inconsistent\nfindings.\nIn this present study, the prevalence of asthma and/or\nwheezing was affected by various environmental factors. Both\ncurrent and past smoking, were strong predictors of wheezing,\nbut not of asthma, compared with never-smokers, this was\nmost marked in current smokers. These results did not change\nwhen the analysis was restricted to subjects aged 20\u00ad44 yrs;\nthis finding is consistent with that of the ECRHS [3]. The\nrelationship between smoking and asthma has been a sub-\nject of interest and conflicting findings. Thus, several studies\nhave reported an association between smoking and asthma\n25]. Although the harmful effects of maternal smoking on\nthe respiratory system of developing foetuses and children\nhave been well documented [26], no clear cause and effect\nrelationship between smoking and asthma in adults has been\nestablished. Cigarette smoke is likely to induce increased\npermeability of respiratory epithelium, which may result in\nincreased \"trafficking\" of allergens and other inflammatory\ncells to submucosal cells resulting in allergic inflammation of\nThe use of space heaters, furnaces or gas stoves may affect\nindoor humidity levels, which might indirectly contribute to\nthe growth of house dust mite, especially when malfunction-\ning. They can also generate oxides of nitrogen, which are\noxidant gases and indoor air pollutants. Studies performed in\nhave reported increased risk of wheezing among females using\ngas cookers. In the ECRHS, although a positive association\nwas found with gas cooking, this was limited to females and\nthere was considerable variation among countries [3]. The\nresults from this study are consistent with those of earlier\nUSA-based studies; a moderate associations between the use\nof a gas stove and wheezing was observed only in the univariate\nanalysis. No quantitative measurements of indoor pollutants\nor allergens were made in NHANES III, and the questions\nrelating to indoor air were narrow in their scope; these are\nimportant limitations to the study9s findings. The relation-\nship of these findings to housing characteristics and home\nheating, ventilation and air conditioning should be further\nexplored.\nPreviously, pet ownership has been linked to asthma and\nasthma symptoms in children and adults [31] as found in this\nstudy. The magnitude of the association with wheezing, how-\never, was diluted and became nonsignificant after simulta-\nneously adjusting for other confounders in the model. One\npossible reason for this diminished effect could be that sub-\njects with wheezing avoided pets and this observed association\nhas been underestimated. Hay fever is a well-established risk\nfactor for asthma and wheezing, and the current findings are\nconsistent with this.\nUntil recently, few epidemiological studies have looked\nat the relationship between obesity and asthma. However,\npositive associations have been found in studies of nurses [32],\nchildren [4], and British adults [33], and the results from the\npresent study are similar. Individuals with asthma tend to be\noverweight [4] and obese individuals tend to have lower\npulmonary function tests [34]. Due to the cross-sectional\nnature of the study it may be argued that the higher BMI is\na result of asthma, due to weight gain from corticosteroid\nuse or avoidance of physical activity. Obese individuals are\ngenerally sedentary, which may result in increased time spent\nindoors, thereby predisposing them to indoor air allergens,\nenvironmental tobacco smoke, and dust mite antigens.\nObesity also predisposes to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease,\nwhich may induce asthmatic symptoms [35]. Given the current\nconcern regarding obesity as a public health problem in the\nUSA, a more detailed evaluation of this association is\ndefinitely warranted.\nThe major limitation of this analysis is the cross-sectional\nnature, which precludes establishing temporal relationships\nor inferring causality. Asthma is frequently misdiagnosed,\nespecially among the elderly and very young. With the\nabsence of any objective measure to test airway hyperrespon-\nsiveness (e.g. histamine or methacholine challenge tests) the\npossibility of misclassification cannot be ruled out. However,\nany such misclassification would likely be nondifferential.\nIn the present study, all subjects with emphysema in the final\nanalysis were removed but those who had responded affirma-\ntively to the question on ever having been diagnosed as having\nchronic bronchitis (item HAC1F in the NHANES III) were\nretained. This decision was made because chronic bronchitis\nis a symptom-based diagnosis and although the authors\nrecognise that the main risk factor for \"true\" chronic bron-\nchitis is cigarette smoking, it is also true that asthma may\npresent with chronic cough as its only symptom (cough-\nvariant asthma). Consequently, there is a certain degree of\noverlap between the two conditions in adults. Interestingly,\nwhen a subgroup analysis was performed on persons who\nindicated having a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis (but not\nemphysema) and these respondents were stratified by smoking\nstatus, a higher prevalence of current asthma was observed\nCI 17.5\u00ad31.8) with chronic bronchitis. This would support the\nimpression that there is some overlap (possibly misclassifica-\ntion) between chronic bronchitis and asthma, but that smok-\ning status does not significantly impact the prevalence of\nasthma in these persons. However, when the prevalence of\nwheezing in the previous 12 months was examined in the same\nsubgroup of chronic bronchitis subjects, by smoking status,\nthe breakdown was as follows: nonsmokers (45.4%, 95% CI\ndisparity between the findings for asthma and wheezing, it is\npossible that wheezing in current smokers reflects a condition\nother than asthma (e.g. undiagnosed COPD, or chronic\nobstructive bronchitis), leading to some misclassification of\nasthma status.\nIn summary, this cross sectional analysis of the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination III dataset showed that\nrace/ethnicity, female sex, socioeconomic status, smoking,\nobesity, hay fever and pet ownership are important risk\nfactors for asthma and wheezing. Differences in prevalence of\nasthma and wheeze were observed for USA regions when\nstratified by race/ethnicity. Mexican-Americans are less likely\nto report asthma and wheeze irrespective of their socio-\neconomic and health insurance status. No significant associa-\ntions were found with a few surrogate measures of indoor air\nquality.\nReferences\n1. Anderson HR. Is the prevalence of asthma changing? Arch\n2.
