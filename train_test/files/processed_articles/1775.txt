Data were compiled as geometric means and selected percentiles of urinary\narsenic concentrations (mg/l) and creatinine-corrected urinary arsenic (mg/g creatinine) for total arsenic, dimethylarsinic acid, arsenobetaine, and a sum of\nthe inorganic related species.\nResults: Arsenic acid, arsenous acid, arsenocholine, and trimethylarsine oxide were detected in 7.6%, 4.6%, 1.8%, and 0.3% of the participants,\nrespectively (the limits of detection of 0.6\u00ad1.2 mg/l). Monomethylarsonic acid was detected in 35% of the overall population. For all participants aged Z6\nyears, dimethylarsinic acid (geometric mean of 3.71 mg/l) and arsenobetaine (geometric mean of 1.55 mg/l) had the greatest contribution to the total\nurinary arsenic levels. A relatively greater percentage contribution from arsenobetaine is seen at higher total urinary arsenic levels and from\ndimethylarsinic acid at lower total urinary arsenic levels. For all participants aged Z6 years, the 95th percentiles for total urinary arsenic and the sum of\ninorganic-related arsenic (arsenic acid, arsenous acid, dimethylarsinic acid, and monomethylarsonic acid) were 65.4 and 18.9 mg/l, respectively. For total\narsenic and dimethylarsinic acid, covariate-adjusted geometric means demonstrated several slight differences due to age, gender, and race/ethnicity.\nConclusions: The data reflect relative background contributions of inorganic and seafood-related arsenic exposures in the US population. Arsenobetaine\nand dimethylarsinic acid are the major arsenic species present with arsenobetaine, accounting for a greater proportion of total arsenic as total arsenic levels\nincrease.\nKeywords: speciated arsenic, human, urine, biomonitoring, NHANES.\nIntroduction\nArsenic is an element that is widely distributed in the earth's\nsurface in small amounts, primarily in its inorganic forms.\nAnthropomorphic sources of arsenic have included the\nsmelting of mined metals. Inorganic arsenic is used currently\nas an outdoor wood preservative, in some pesticides, as\nsemiconductor dopant materials, and in certain medicines.\nGeneral human exposure to inorganic arsenic results from\nnatural amounts consumed in drinking water. However,\ndietary arsenic may be an important source (NRC, 2001)\nwhen drinking water levels are low. Arsenic also forms\norganic compounds through biological action on inorganic\narsenic. These organic forms are found in fish, shellfish,\nseaweed, and aquatic sediments and are generally much less\ntoxic. These dietary arsenic species are commonly represented\nby arsenobetaine and, to a lesser extent, by arsenocholine and\narsenosugars (Heinrich-Ramm et al., 2002). In addition to\nthe arsenical forms found in marine organisms, mono- and\ndimethylated pentavalent and trivalent arsenicals are formed\nfrom inorganic arsenic in mammals. Historically, this\nmetabolic pathway was viewed as a detoxification mechanism.\nThe trivalent methylated metabolites are believed to be highly\ntoxic and have been recently detected in human urine (Vahter,\nmetabolites of inorganic arsenic, above typical environmental\nlevels, can result in a variety of adverse health effects, such as\nskin disorders, neuropathy, and cancer of the lung, bladder,\nUrinary levels of arsenic are generally regarded as a good\nmeasure of exposure (WHO, 2001). In this article, we\nprovide the first urinary arsenic data in a representative\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES). Total urinary arsenic was measured by\ninductively coupled plasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass\nspectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS), a technique that minimizes\nor eliminates many argon-based polyatomic interferences\n1 Address all correspondence to: Dr. Kathleen L.

Seven urinary inorganic and organic\nforms of arsenic were measured separately by high-\nperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to\nMethods\nStudy Design\nNHANES is conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC). This survey is designed to assess the\nhealth and nutrition status of the civilian, non-institutiona-\nlized US population using a complex multistage probability\nsample design as previously described (NCHS, 2008). For\nmeasurements in a random one-third subset of persons aged\nZ6 years representing the civilian, non-institutionalized\npopulation of the United States by age, gender, and self-\nreported race/ethnicity categories. Race/ethnicity categories\nwere non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican\nAmericans. Remaining race/ethnic groups, although not\ncategorized separately, were included in total population\ncalculations. Age categories were children 6\u00ad11 years,\nincorporates sample population weights to account for\nthe unequal selection probabilities caused by the cluster\ndesign, non-response, and planned oversampling of certain\nsubgroups. The overall NHANES unweighted interview\nresponse rate was 79%. Each subsample involves separate\nsample weights. For analysis of subsample data, appropriate\nsubsample weights must be used.\nLaboratory Methods\nDuring the physical examinations, spot urine specimens were\ncollected in arsenic-free containers, stored at r41C, and then\nshipped on dry ice to the CDC's National Center for\nEnvironmental Health. Urine samples were stored frozen\n(r\u00c0701C) and typically analyzed within 3 weeks of\ncollection. Total urinary arsenic concentrations are stable at\n\u00c0701C for 43 years). Total urinary arsenic was analyzed\nurine was diluted with 2.25 ml of diluent (2% v/v nitric acid\nand 10 mg/l gallium internal standard). Matrix-matched\ncalibrators were prepared by adding 0.1 ml of a calibration\nstandard into 0.9 ml of pooled urine (tested to be o5 mg/l\narsenic (As)) and 9 ml of diluent. Analysis was performed on\n(PerkinElmer SCIEX, Concord, ON, Canada) equipped\nwith a Meinhard quartz nebulizer (Type TQ-30-A3), a DRC\nquartz cyclonic spray chamber, a 2.0 mm ID quartz injector,\nand nickel sampler and skimmer cones. Total urinary arsenic\nwas quantified based on the ratio of analyte to that of the\ninternal standard in peak hopping mode. Argon chloride\npolyatomic interferences were eliminated by operating the\nICP-MS in DRC mode using 10% hydrogen in argon at a\nflow rate of 0.2\u00ad0.6 s.c.c.m. (standard cubic centimeters\nper minute) and a bandpass rejection parameter (RPQ) of\nanalyzed two bench quality control pools along with blind\nquality control pools interspersed among the participant\nsamples. The arsenic bench QC (n \u00bc 272) had an interday\nprecision of 10.05% relative standard deviation (RSD) at\ndetection (LOD) for urinary arsenic was 0.74 mg/l. Accuracy\nwas verified by analyzing standard reference material (SRM\n2670) from the National Institute of Standards Technology\n(NIST) and reference materials from the Centre de\ntoxicologie du Que\n\u00b4 bec (CTQ).\nSeven arsenic species in urine were separated by HPLC\n150 mm, 5 mm, PEEK Hardware; Hamilton Company,\nReno, NV, USA) (Verdon et al., 2004). Urine was diluted\n1:4 in 0.1 M ammonium acetate, pH 5, centrifuged at\ninjected onto the column. Arsenic species were eluted using a\nlinear gradient with a starting mobile phase of 10 mM\nammonium carbonate, 10 mM TRIS buffer, and pH 8.6 that\nswitched to 10 mM ammonium carbonate, 5 mM ammonium\nsulfate, and pH 8 pumped at 1.0 ml/min. Column effluent\nwas directed to a Meinhard quartz nebulizer (Type TQ-30-\nA3) in a quartz cyclonic spray chamber attached to an\nELAN DRC II ICP-MS (PerkinElmer SCIEX, Concord,\nON, Canada) that was equipped with a 2 mm ID quartz\ninjector, platinum sampler, and skimmer cones. The ICP-MS\nwas operated in DRC mode using 10% hydrogen in argon at\nin single ion mode as described previously (Jarrett et al.,\n2007). Signal data were collected and analyzed using\nTotalChromt chromatography data processing software\n(PerkinElmer SCIEX) and Microsoft Excel 2003 (Microsoft\nCorporation, Richmond, WA, USA). An electronically\nactivated six-port switching valve with a 200 ml sample loop\ninstalled between the column and the ICP-MS was\nprogrammatically switched to the inject position at 30 s after\nthe autosampler's sample injection. This introduced an\narsenic internal standard peak that appeared on the\nchromatogram before the column void volume. Figure 1\nillustrates a typical patient sample and one of our bench\nquality control samples containing all seven arsenic species.\nThe integrated peak area ratios (analyte areas divided by\ninternal standard area) were used to calculate the concentra-\ntion of each arsenic species against calibration curves\nconstructed using the human urine-based calibrators that\ncontained arsenocholine, arsenobetaine, trimethylarsine\noxide, dimethylarsinic acid, monomethylarsonic acid,\narsenic acid, and arsenous acid. The limits of detection were\nas follows: arsenic acid 1.0 mg/l, arsenous acid 1.2 mg/l,\nLevels of urinary total and speciated arsenic\nCaldwell et al.\narsenobetaine 0.4 mg/l, arsenocholine 0.6 mg/l, dimethyl-\narsinic acid 1.7 mg/l, monomethylarsonic acid 0.9 mg/l,\nand trimethylarsine oxide 1.0 mg/l. Quality control samples\nconsisting of previously characterized urine spiked with\nknown amounts of arsenic species were co-analyzed with\neach run.

Geometric means and percentiles were\ncalculated using SUDAAN version 9.0 (Research Triangle\nInstitute, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). Ninety-five\npercent confidence limits (CI) for geometric means were\nestimated based on the Taylor series linearization method\n(SUDAAN user's manual, 2001) and CIs for percentiles\nwere adapted from the methods of Woodruff (1952) and\nKorn and Graubard (1998). SUDAAN uses sample weights\nand calculates variance estimates that account for the\ncomplex survey design. Geometric means were computed\nwhen 460% of the samples had detectable values. The LOD\ndivided by the square root of 2 was used for imputation of\nvalues lower than the LOD. For each of total urinary arsenic\nand dimethylarsinic acid, sufficient data were available for\ncomparing the covariate-adjusted geometric means of demo-\ngraphic groups by least squares multiple regression using the\ncovariates of age, gender, race/ethnicity, and urinary\ncreatinine.

Human exposure to inorganic arsenic occurs\npredominately through drinking water and less frequently\nfrom other sources, including contact from wood treated with\nchromated copper arsenic preservatives and certain pesti-\ncides. Dietary exposure to arsenic may be an important\nsource if drinking water levels are low. Exposure to organic\nforms of arsenic primarily occurs from seafood. Measuring\ntotal arsenic in human urine assesses the combined exposure\nfrom all routes of exposure and all species of arsenic. The\nindividual species of arsenic measured in this study was the\ncommon inorganic and organic forms; some rarer types\nof arsenic, such as 3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenyarsonic acid\n(a chicken feed additive, roxarsone), were not measurable\nby our speciation method.\nThe levels of total urinary arsenic in the NHANES 2003\u00ad\n2004 subsample were similar to the levels reported in\n(NHEXAS) for about 80 children residing in the Great\nLakes region (Pellizzari and Clayton, 2006). In the German\nEnvironmental Survey III of 1998, median urinary total\narsenic levels in 4052 adults varied with seafood intake and\nwere approximately two-fold lower than those for NHANES\nTable 7.

For 25th and lower percentiles (data not shown), the\nestimate is below the summed LOD.\nLevels of urinary total and speciated arsenic Caldwell et al.\nhave been reported for people in western areas of North\nas for other areas of the world (Ahsan et al., 2000; Aposhian\nknown to have higher levels of arsenic in their drinking water.\nMedian and mean total urinary arsenic levels for residents in\nsome districts in Bangladesh have been reported to be about\ngeometric mean levels were about 70-fold higher for residents\nof Inner Mongolia, China (Sun et al., 2007). In the\ntotal urinary arsenic levels (and also dimethylarsinic acid)\nwere observed among the various demographic groups.\nWhether these reflect differences in exposure or pharmaco-\nkinetic factors is unknown.\nTotal urinary arsenic values can occasionally increase to\nseveral thousands of mg/l after seafood ingestion. This is due\nto the contribution of specific organic forms of arsenic\n(arsenobetaine, arsenocholine, and trimethylarsine oxide)\nfound in seafood, which adds to the total urinary arsenic\nmeasurement. Most arsenocholine and some trimethylarsine\noxide are converted to arsenobetaine in environmental\nbiosystems (NRC, 2001), so that the main seafood exposure\nlittle arsenocholine and trimethylarsine oxide in human urine\ncompared with arsenobetaine. After ingestion, organic forms\nof arsenic are excreted quickly in the urine. Our analysis\nshows that as total urinary arsenic levels increase from o20\nurinary arsenic is increasingly due to arsenobetaine, with\nmedian percentages being 62.7% for total urinary arsenic\nlevels 450 mg/l. The cut point of 50 mg/l was chosen because\nsome studies suggest that slight health risks may be associated\nbeen used as an upper reference range. The cut point of\n20 mg/l was chosen to correspond roughly to the 95th\npercentile of the sum of inorganic species; thus, a urine\nsample of o20 mg/l is likely to have little contribution from\norganic arsenic species. Hence, the higher relative contribu-\ntion from dimethylarsinic acid is found at lower levels\n(median percent contribution from dimethylarsinic acid for a\ndimethylarsinic acid is the predominant metabolite compos-\ning the majority of measurable inorganic-related arsenic in\nthe urine. Levels of dimethylarsinic and monomethylarsonic\nacids will increase in approximate proportion to the intake of\ninorganic arsenic. In the late 1980s, a control population of\n696 Tacoma residents demonstrated a median urinary\ndimethylarsinic acid level similar to those reported in\nof a Chilean town who consumed water with high levels of\ninorganic arsenic, median levels of urinary dimethylarsinic\nacid were about 40-fold higher than the adult median levels\nacid represented about 67% of the total urinary arsenic\n(Hopenhayn-Rich et al., 1996). The levels of monomethyl-\ncharacterized only at the upper percentiles and, as with\ndimethylarsinic acid, these levels were much lower than those\nfound in other studies where environmental exposures were\nBecause arsenic acid, arsenous acid, arsenocholine, and\ntrimethylarsine oxide were detected in only 7.6%, 4.6%,\n1.8% and 0.3%, respectively, of specimens, each species\nmade only a small contribution to the total urinary arsenic\nlevel. Arsenic acid and arsenous acid are often the primary\nforms of arsenic to which people are exposed to in drinking\nwater; however, these are metabolized in the body with\narsenic acid being reduced to arsenous acid and then\nmethylated to monomethylarsonic and dimethylarsinic acids\n(WHO, 2001). The sum of the inorganic-related species\nprovided estimates at the 95th percentiles; this level is an\nimportant upper benchmark for the US population because\nthe sum of these species represents a dose of the more toxic\ninorganic arsenic most likely incurred from drinking water.\nAlso, in recent years, occupational monitoring and research\nstudies have focused on the sum of inorganic-related species\nas a measure of inorganic arsenic intake. Studies of small\ngroups of metal smelter and sulfuric acid workers with\nvarying industrial hygiene conditions have reported urinary\ninorganic arsenic levels ranging up to several hundreds of mg/l\nduring or after work exposure (Vahter et al., 1986; Offergelt\ntreatment workers had median urinary dimethylarsinic acid\nlevels (a surrogate marker for inorganic arsenic exposure)\nthat were about 15-fold higher than adult median levels\nreported elsewhere (Morton and Mason, 2006). The\nAmerican Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists\n(ACGIH) provided an occupational biologic effect index\n(BEI) for urinary inorganic arsenic plus metabolites of\nrelated species was 18.9 mg/l, which is below the ACGIH\nBEI. Also, about 95% of the adult US population is likely to\nbe below the US Environmental Protection Agency reference\nday), if 18.9 mg is considered an approximated daily expo-\nsure (assuming 1 l of urine is produced per day by a 70 kg\nperson, steady-state conditions, and all ingested arsenic\nCDC began monitoring urinary arsenic in the US population\ncollect future survey data. This may allow assessment of the\nLevels of urinary total and speciated arsenic\nCaldwell et al.\ncurrent maximum contaminant level on human exposure\nto arsenic.\nConclusion\nThe data reflect relative background contributions of\ninorganic and seafood-related arsenic exposures in the US\npopulation. Arsenobetaine and dimethylarsinic acid are the\nmajor arsenic species present with arsenobetaine accounting\nfor a greater proportion of total arsenic as total arsenic levels\nincrease.\n"
