    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Approximately one-fourth of all cigarettes sold in the United States have the descriptor \"menthol\" on\nthe cigarette pack. It is important to determine what socio-demographic factors are associated with smoking\nmenthol cigarettes if indeed these types of cigarettes are related to smoking initiation, higher exposure to smoke\nconstituents, nicotine dependence, or reduced smoking cessation.\nMethods: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducted a review of the scientific literature on this topic which we\ncompleted by adding more recently published articles via PubMed. We also conducted further data analyses using\nthe National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the National Youth Tobacco Survey, the Monitoring the Future\nSurvey, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to provide up-to-date information on this topic.\nResults: Menthol cigarettes are disproportionately smoked by adolescents, blacks/African Americans, adult females,\nthose living in the Northeast of the United States and those with family incomes lower than $50,000. Based on\nself-reports of menthol cigarette use, menthol cigarette use among smokers have increased from 2004 to 2008.\nHowever, no increase was observed during these years for predominantly menthol brands like NewportTM, Kool,TM\nand SalemTM, however, this lack of significant trend may be due, at least in part, due to smaller numbers of\nsmokers of specific brands or sub-brands, which provide estimates which are less precise.\nConclusion: Menthol cigarettes are disproportionately smoked by groups of U.S. cigarette smokers. It is likely that\nother disparities in menthol cigarette use exist that we have not covered or have not been studied yet.\nBackground\nThere are over a thousand cigarette brands and sub-\nbrands that are sold in the United States [1]. Cigarette\nbrands are advertised or described by some specific\ncharacteristics such as been filter or non-filter, by the\nlength of the cigarette, by its Federal Trade Commission\nmachine-measured levels of tar, nicotine yield, and car-\nbon monoxide, and some brands of cigarettes have the\ndescriptor \"menthol\" in the pack [2].\nIt has been proposed that the anesthetic and cooling\nsensation properties of menthol allow smokers of\nmenthol cigarettes (by menthol cigarettes we mean a\ncigarette from a pack with the descriptor \"menthol\" in\nit) to inhale more smoke from each cigarette than smo-\nkers of nonmenthol cigarettes (no \"menthol\" descriptor\nin the cigarette pack) [3,4]. It has also been proposed\nthat smokers of menthol are more nicotine dependent,\nand as a consequence, are less likely to quit [5]. It has\nbeen hypothesized that the resulting higher smoke expo-\nsure over time may result in higher smoking-related dis-\neases among smokers of menthol cigarettes [5,6]. In the\nU.S., menthol brands tend to have higher yields of tar,\nnicotine, and CO, however, menthol is present at\nreduced levels in many nonmenthol brands [7]. Finally,\nit has been proposed that menthol levels in cigarettes\nmay play an important role in smoking initiation espe-\ncially among adolescents, most of whom are underage\nIn this article, we used a recent literature review by\nThe National Cancer Institute (NCI) to determine what\nsocio-demographic factors are associated with smoking\n(e.g., initiation, cessation, exposure to smoke constitu-\nents, nicotine dependence) menthol cigarettes and we\ncompleted it by adding more recently published articles\nwe identified via PubMed.

A review of the scientific literature on socio-\ndemographic factors related to smoking menthol cigar-\nettes was provided by the Department of Health and\nHuman Services' National Cancer Institute (NCI) [11].\nFor youth, there were nine articles listed in the biblio-\ngraphy, of which one was conducted in Japan [12]. Of\nthe eight studies conducted in the U.S., five [13-17] col-\nlected data using national samples, two were conducted\nqualitative (focus groups) in study design. Four of these\n8 U.S. articles presented data from cross-sectional stu-\nand two from a convenience sample [19,20]. Because\nmore recent information has been published or available\nsince the NCI bibliography was provided, additional stu-\ndies or reports [8,10,21] are included in the youth sec-\ntion in this article. When appropriate, we report results\nfrom these studies in this review article.\nFor adults, there were 15 articles listed and one letter\nto the editor on the bibliography provided by NCI. Ele-\nven of these 15 articles presented data from cross-sec-\ntional studies, four presented data from case-control\nstudies or data were collected using convenience sam-\nples. The most recent study listed [22] reported data\ncollected in 2002 from a specific U.S. population group\n(heroin users) in a specific location. Because of lack of\nrecent data in the NCI bibliography, other studies and\nto provide more recent information on this topic. Also\nwhen appropriate, we report results from these studies\nin this review article.\nTo provide up-to-date information on this topic, data\nanalyses were performed using specific data sets such\nas the National Survey on Drug Use & Health[25],\nhence referred as NSDUH; the National Youth\nTobacco Survey[26], hence referred as NYTS; the Mon-\nitoring the Future Survey[27], hence referred as MTFS;\nand the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey[28], hence referred as NHANES. It is important\nto note that the consistent collection of national data\non menthol cigarette use started fairly recently, in the\nNYTS, and NHANES). Two-sided t tests were used to\nassess differences between population group percen-\ntages. For all tests, p<0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nNSDUH\nThe National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)\nis a nationwide household survey that collects data on\ndrug use and drug abuse, including tobacco use, from a\nrepresentative sample of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutio-\nnalized population aged 12 years or older. Specifically,\nthe NSDUH collects data on overall tobacco use, cigar-\nette smoking, and other behavioral information related\nto cigarette smoking and brand preference. NSDUH\ndata are collected through a computerized questionnaire\nadministered in the privacy of participants' homes by a\nprofessional field interviewer who visits each selected\nhousehold. Most responses are answered in private by\nthe participant, although the interviewer reads and\nenters the responses to some questions in the presence\nof the participant. Questions about tobacco use were\nadministered through audio, computer-assisted, self-\ninterview methods to maximize privacy and improve\nreporting of sensitive behaviors. For our analysis using\nthese data, we used information for adolescents aged\n12-17 years old who smoked in the past month\nin order to determine prevalence of menthol cigarette\nuse in the overall population of smokers as well as for\nspecific subgroups of smokers and to assess trends in\nsmoking menthol cigarette use among smokers.\nNYTS\nThe NYTS is a nationally representative sample of stu-\ndents enrolled in grades 6 through 12. The sampling\nuniverse consists of public and private school students\nin the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The sam-\npling frame stratified the 50 states and the District of\nColumbia by region and urbanicity. Primary sampling\nunits (PSUs), are selected with probability proportional\nto the student enrollment in the PSU but giving dispro-\nportionate weight to Black, Asian, and Hispanic\nstudents.\nSchools are grouped by size as either large or small,\ndepending on whether they have at least 125 students\ncombined in eligible grades. All students present in a\nselected classroom on the day of the interview are\nselected for the study. Schools or students who refused\nto participate in the study are not replaced in the\nsample.\nOur analysis included 1,978 middle school students\nand 2009 combined who had valid information on the\nschool year, past 30 day smoking, brand use, and\nmenthol questions. Those who were excluded included:\nthose who did not specify a grade in school or didn't\nanswer the question (n=397); those who were not a\nhttp://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.com/content/9/S1/S1\ncurrent smoker or didn't answer the question\n(n=67,809); those who said they didn't smoke cigarettes\nduring the past 30 days, that they did not have a usual\nbrand when asked about brand use, or did not answer\nthe question (n=66,719); and those who said they do not\nsmoke cigarettes when asked about menthol cigarettes\nWe analyzed data from 2,580 adolescent smokers\nselected throughout 35 states (not all states are repre-\nsented because the survey design did not control for\nthis) and from 267 large and small private and public\nschools.\nMTFS\nThe Monitoring the Future Survey (MTFS) main data\ncollection involves a series of large, annual surveys of\nnationally representative samples of public and private\nsecondary school students in grades 8th, 10th, and 12th\nthroughout the coterminous United States. Staff mem-\nbers administer the questionnaires to students, usually\nin their classrooms during a regular class period. Partici-\npation is voluntary. Parents are notified well in advance\nof the survey administration and are provided the\nopportunity to decline their child's participation. Ques-\ntionnaires are self-completed. For the combined years of\ngrade current smokers in our data analysis. We assessed\ntrends in smoking menthol cigarettes among adolescent\nsmokers.\nNHANES\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) consists of a number of questionnaires\nadministered in the household followed by standardized\nphysical examinations and additional tobacco use ques-\ntions administered in specially equipped mobile exami-\nnation centers (MECs). The NHANES target population\nis the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. This\nnationally representative sample permits calculation of\nnational estimates. NHANES over-samples low-income\nage, blacks, and Mexican Americans. We used NHANES\ndata collected between January 2001 and December\nincluded smokers aged 20 years and older who had\nsmoked, who were recoded by NHANES as non-Hispa-\nnic white, non-Hispanic black/African American, or\nMexican American. Of the 14,272 white, black, or Mexi-\ncan American adults aged 20 years and older who com-\npleted the NHANES home interview. The final analytic\nshowed the 8 or 12 digit Universal Product Code (UPC)\ninformation on the side of the cigarette pack.\nResults\nYouth\nlescent smokers aged 12 \u00ad 17 years reported smoking\nmenthol cigarettes [10], an estimated 1 million adoles-\ncents (Table 1). Self-reports of types of cigarettes\nsmoked are subject to bias. This important topic will be\ndiscussed in more detail later. Younger smokers are\nmore likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than older\nsmokers [10,16]. Figure 1 shows that a higher propor-\ntion of cigarette smokers smoked menthol cigarettes\namong adolescents (44.8%) than among young adults\nsistent with this result specifically for adolescent current\nNYTS survey shows that 49.4% of middle school current\nsmokers and 44.9% of high school current smokers\nreported smoking menthol cigarettes (Table 2). Finally,\nAplleyard and colleagues found in a school-based survey\nkers who smoked in the past 30 days reported to have\nsmoked a menthol brand [11].\nThe proportion of menthol smokers among all cigar-\nette smokers is higher among adolescents than among\nadults in most, but not all, racial or ethnic groups (Fig-\nure 2). Among white, multi-racial, Asian, and Hispanic\nyouth, the proportions of adolescent cigarette smokers\nreporting smoking menthol cigarettes are significantly\nhigher than among adults. However, the proportion of\nAfrican American adolescent cigarette smokers (71.9%)\nreporting smoking menthol cigarettes is significantly\nlower than the corresponding proportion for African\nAmerican adult smokers (82.7%). This observed differ-\nence requires additional study to determine if it is a real\ndifference or an artifact of misreporting.\nRacial/ethnic group\nBig racial/ethnic differences exist in menthol cigarette\nuse. Very high proportions of black/African American\nadolescent smokers smoke menthol cigarettes\nof ten African American smokers in this age group\nreported smoking menthol cigarettes, followed by about\nmore than half of multi-race and Asian adolescent smo-\nkers (Figure 2). Data from the NSDUH survey shows\nHawaiians/Pacific Islanders reported smoking a menthol\nbrand in the past 30 days. Similarly, a study conducted\nshowed that 58.0% of Asians reported using a menthol\nhttp://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.com/content/9/S1/S1\ncigarette brand. However, in another study conducted\nby Moolchan [19] in Baltimore, MD he found no differ-\nence in menthol cigarette use between blacks/African\nThis study, however, used a convenience sample.\nAppleyard and colleagues also found that high school\nblack/African American, Asian, and Native Hawaiian\nand Pacific Islander smokers were more likely to report\nsmoking menthol cigarettes than their counterparts in\nmiddle school; while white and Hispanic high school\nsmokers were less likely to report smoking menthol\ncigarettes than their counterparts in middle school [13].\nA similar finding for whites and Hispanics (less smoking\nof menthol cigarettes among high school students) was\nfound by Hersey and colleagues [14].\nGender\nNo consistent gender difference in menthol cigarette use\nis observed among adolescents. The scientific literature\nprovided found no gender difference in menthol cigar-\nette use between male and female adolescent smokers.\nJohnston [21] found no gender difference between males\nand females who smoked the menthol brand Newpor-\ntTM*or reported smoking menthol cigarettes in general.\nThe use of trade names is for informational purposes\nonly and in no way implies endorsement by the US\nGovernment, the US Department of Health and Human\nYR Age GENDER Menthol Row\nPercent\nROWPER\nROWPER\nSample\nSize\nWeighted\nSize\nCigarettes\nFemale Menthol\nCigarettes\nCigarettes\nFemale Menthol\nCigarettes\nCigarettes\nFemale Menthol\nCigarettes\nCigarettes\nFemale Menthol\nCigarettes\nCigarettes\nFemale Menthol\nCigarettes\nSource: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Kaufman and colleagues [15] stated\nthat even though market shares for the cigarette brands\nMarlboroTM and Camel TMchanged little between 1989 and\n1996, the prevalence of smoking NewportTM cigarettes\ndoubled among white and Hispanic adolescents who\nusually bought their cigarettes during that period. Barker\nand colleagues [16] also found that the prevalence of\nsmoking NewportTM cigarettes increased among adoles-\nprevalence of smoking MarlboroTM cigarettes decreased\nduring this period. Consistent with results from earlier\nwas the predominant brand for 8th, 10th, and 12th graders,\nrespectively). The third-ranked brand was CamelTM (5.4%,\n7.3%, and 9.6%, respectively). Also consistent with earlier\nstudies [15,18] big racial/ethnic differences were found.\nWhile the great majority of white (61-70%) and Hispanic\n(57-65%) smokers smoked MarlboroTM, the vast majority\nof blacks/African Americans smoked NewportTM (71-\n82%). Similar results were observed by Appleyard and\nschool students. Appleyard found that the vast majority of\nwhite, Hispanic, Asian, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islan-\nder adolescent smokers smoked MarlboroTM, and the vast\nmajority of black/African American adolescent smokers\nsmoked NewportTM. The predominance of these three\nto 2008 MTFS surveys show that the three leading cigar-\nette brands smoked by adolescents are MarlboroTM, New-\nportTM, and CamelTM, in that order. A 2005 NSDUH\nreport on cigarette brand preference showed that 81.3% of\nyears or older reported to smoke a somewhat more diver-\nsified selection of cigarette brands, only 54.1% of smokers\nsmoked one of the top 3 brands.\nGeographic Differences in Cigarette Brand Use Preferences\nData on use of menthol cigarettes by region they live in\nthe U.S. is scarce. Compared to the East region of the\nUnited States, Kaufman and colleagues [15] found in the\n1990's that adolescents living in the Midwest, South,\nand West were less likely to smoke NewportTM and\nmore likely to smoke MarlboroTM.\nSmoking initiation\nIt has been hypothesized that menthol cigarette brands\nplay an important role in smoking initiation. When\nyears or older), the younger the age group, the more\nlikely it is to report smoking menthol cigarettes [10].\nUnfortunately, data on this topic is scarce and data from\ncohort studies are lacking. It is important to clarify that\nthe age of a smoker and smoking initiation is not\nequivalent. A person that is younger may have been\nsmoking longer than an older person. For example, an\nadolescent aged 14 years may have been smoking for 3\nyears, while a young adult aged 19 years may have\nstarted smoking less than 1 year ago. Thus, age or age\nthe smoker is not equivalent to smoking initiation.

However, no cohort\nstudy we are aware of collects this type of information\nfor persons younger than age 18 years, when most\nsmoking initiation happens.\nDue to lack of information on smoking initiation with\nmenthol cigarettes from prospective studies, and in an\nattempt to determine if smoking initiation is correlated\nwith menthol cigarette use, we conducted an analysis\nusing cross-sectional data to determine the prevalence\nof self-reported menthol cigarette use at different\n\"stages\" or trajectories of cigarette smoking among ado-\nlescents in grades 6th \u00ad 12.th This type of analysis has\nbeen used to determine the prevalence of nicotine\ndependence at different stages/trajectories of cigarette\nsmoking among adolescents [31]. Although this\napproach is inferior to collecting data from prospective\nstudies, it is also true that patterns of cigarette smoking\ndevelop over months or years within individuals. In fact,\nmost new smokers take an average of 2-3 years from\nthe time they smoked their first cigarette to the time\nthey become daily smokers [32]. Thus, the analysis pre-\nsented here for respondents who started smoking less\nthan 2 years ago may give us an insight on the relation\nof smoking initiation (earliest stages/trajectories of\nsmoking) and the use of menthol cigarettes. We com-\nYouth Tobacco Survey (NYTS). When looking at poten-\ntial \"stages\" or trajectories of cigarette smoking and the\nuse of menthol cigarettes, no significant differences were\nobserved between \"stages\" or trajectories and the preva-\nlence of smoking menthol cigarettes (Table 3). Among\nadolescents who smoked <1 cigarette per day (CPD) on\nsmoking menthol cigarettes. For those who smoked 1-5\nall 30 days, the self-reported prevalence of smoking\nthey smoked a menthol brand. Thus, if smoking a\nmenthol cigarette is a factor associated with smoking\ninitiation, it would be expected to see a higher propor-\ntion of menthol cigarette smokers at the earlier stages/\ntrajectories of cigarette smoking. In fact, we found the\nprevalence of menthol use to be lower among those\nwho smoked <1 CPD on 1-5 days than those who\nand to be similar to those in other stages/trajectories of\ncigarette smoking. Also, those at the highest level of\ncigarette smoking (20+ CPD on all 30 days) were more\nlikely to report smoking menthol cigarettes than all\nother smoking stages/trajectories. Thus, we found no\nindication that adolescent smokers are more likely to\ninitiate smoking by smoking menthol cigarettes.\nTrends in menthol cigarette use\nIn general, the prevalence of cigarette smoking in the U.\nS. has been declining for adolescents over the past 10\nyears.

The MTFS survey does\nnot distinguish however between these two types of\nsignificant increase in CamelTM use for boys and girls in\n10th and 12th grade and declines in MarlboroTM use\n5). A decline in MarlboroTM use was also observed\namong middle and high school boys and girls in the\n2009 NYTS compared to previous years (data not\nshown). However, because most of the cigarette market\nshare is driven by adult smokers, this decline may not\nbe reflected in the overall MarlboroTM market share.\nFinally, Kreslake and colleagues reported that expendi-\ntures in advertising for nonmenthol brands declined\nwhile expenditures in advertising for menthol brands\nthat period [8]. It is known that adolescents are highly\nsusceptible to advertising influences. Tobacco advertis-\ning, marketing, and promotion play an important role in\nincreasing smoking initiation and tobacco use among\nyouth [34]. Youth have been purposely targeted through\nadvertising, marketing, and promotion [34]. The total\nweight of evidence presented by the 2008 NCI's Mono-\ngraph #19, which was assessed from multiple study\ntypes including experimental, cross-sectional, and longi-\ntudinal studies, and conducted by investigators from dif-\nferent disciplines using data from several countries,\ndemonstrated a causal relationship between tobacco\nadvertising, marketing, and promotion that ultimately\nincreased smoking initiation and tobacco use [34]. It is\npossible that increases in expenditures in advertising for\nmenthol brands resulted in increases in youth exposure\nto such advertising, which then resulted in increase pre-\nvalence of use of menthol cigarette brands.\nAdults\nAbout three out of ten adult cigarette smokers reported\nsmoking a menthol cigarette brand (Figure 1). Young\nadult smokers aged 18-25 years are more likely to\nsmoke menthol cigarettes than older adult smokers\n(aged 26 years or older). Figure 1 shows that a higher\nproportion of cigarette smokers aged 18-25 years\nsmoked menthol cigarettes (36.5%) than older adults\nRacial/ethnic group\nAmong adult smokers, the vast majority of black/African\nAmerican adults reported smoking a menthol cigarette\na high proportion of menthol cigarette smokers are\nPuerto Ricans [37], Asians [39], and Native Hawaiians/\nOther Pacific Islanders (Figure 2). More recent informa-\ntion using data from the NSDUH survey shows that\nabout eight of ten black/African American adult smo-\nkers reported smoking menthol cigarettes, followed by\nabout half of Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Island\nadult smokers (Figure 2). In fact, almost half of adult\nmenthol cigarette smokers are from minority racial/eth-\nnic groups. Analyses with this NHANES data confirm\nthe NSDUH result that most black/African American\nsmokers smoke a menthol brand (results not shown).\nThus, one consistent finding is that black/African Amer-\nican smokers are far more likely to smoke a menthol\ncigarette brand than smokers of other U.S. racial/ethnic\ngroups, however, some other racial/ethnic groups of\nsmokers such as Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders\nand probably Puerto Ricans also smoke menthol cigar-\nGender\nsmokers are more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes\nthan male adult smokers (Table 4). The scientific litera-\nture is consistent in this finding for adult smokers but\nshows that a higher proportion of adult female smokers\nthan adult male smokers reported smoking menthol\ncigarettes. This was observed for both 18-25 years and\n26 years or older. The gender difference was also\nobserved among African Americans, whites, and Hispa-\nnics (Figure 9). The lack of a significant gender differ-\nence for the other racial/ethnic groups probably resulted\nfrom the lack of precision of the estimates for these\npopulations due to small sample size. However, no gen-\nder difference was observed for the menthol brand New-\ndata in which smokers showed their pack of cigarettes\nto the interviewer also showed a gender difference\nwhere female adult smokers aged 26 years or older were\nmore likely to smoke a menthol brand than their male\ncounterpart, but not so among the age group 20-25\nPercent\nMarlboro\nMenthol\nMarlboro Camel Kool\nMenthol\nNewport\nMenthol\nAll Other\nMenthol\nAll Other\nCamel\nMenthol\nKool Newport\nhttp://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.com/content/9/S1/S1\nyears old, probably due to smaller sample size number\nof smokers in the survey in this age group (results not\nshown).

Looking at trends in cigarette brand use from\nof MarlboroTM, NewportTM, or CamelTM use were\nnor for smokers aged 26 years or older (Figure 14). The\nlack of significant changes for specific cigarette brands\nover time may be due, at least in part, to less precision\nof the estimates due to smaller sample size numbers.\nKreslake and colleagues reported an increase for Marl-\nboro MentholTM sales data [8]. They found that although\n2005, that the sales of menthol cigarettes remained\nstable and that Marlboro MentholTM had a consistent\nmarket share growth that started in the early 1990's up\nto 2006, most recent data available when they published\ntheir article. In 2006, the authors reported, NewportTM\nwas the leading menthol brand, followed by Marlboro\nMentholTM, which they stated was particularly popular\ndata, we found that for adult smokers, even though the\nprevalence of cigarette smoking remained the same in\nreported use of menthol cigarettes increased during\nthose years for adults, more so for those aged 18-25\nyears than those aged 26 years or older.\nMenthol cigarette use self-report bias\nAs previously stated, self-reports of types of cigarettes\nsmoked are subject to bias. For example, Hersey [14],\nGiovino and colleagues [9] as well as Kreslake and col-\nleagues [8] found that menthol cigarette use self-reports\nare subject to misclassification, probably more so on\ncertain subgroups such as adolescents. Kreslake and col-\nwho smoked NewportTM, a menthol brand, also reported\nthey were smokers of menthol cigarettes when asked in\na separate question, thus 17% of them reported to be\nsmokers of nonmenthol cigarettes which is inconsistent\nwith the menthol brand Newport. When a similar\nassessment was made for participants aged 35 years or\nolder, they found that only 5% of NewportTM smokers\nreported in a separate question to be smokers of a non-\nmenthol brand [8].\nCompared to most adult smokers, most adolescent\nsmokers can be considered to be novice smokers. The\nfact that a substantial proportion of current (smoking at\nleast 1 day of past 30 days, even a puff) adolescent smo-\nkers (e.g., first triers, experimenters, <weekly smokers)\nwill not be considered to be an established adult smoker\n(100 cigarettes smoked or more in lifetime) is likely\nrelated to the differential misreporting of the use of\nmenthol cigarettes between the two age groups. For\nexample, a paper published recently by Caraballo and\ncolleagues [31] shows that 26.8% of current adolescent\nsmokers aged 12-18 years started smoking <1 year prior\nto the time of the interview. In contrast, the vast major-\nity of adult smokers are established smokers, smoke\nevery day (80%), buy their own cigarettes, and most of\nthem smoke at least half-a-pack a day. Learning specific\nbrand characteristics (e.g., full flavor, light or ultra-light;\nMarlboro MildTM, Marlboro MentholTM, Newport; TM\nmenthol or nonmenthol) develops over time. It is likely\nthat many adolescent smokers are less knowledgeable\nthan adult smokers of the specific characteristics of the\ncigarettes they smoke, especially those who are early in\nTable 5 Menthol brand use assessed with UPC bar code among adult smokers aged 20 years or older, NHANES 2003-\n5 Common Brand + Menthol info Column Percent Lower 95% Limit ROWPER Upper 95% Limit ROWPER Sample Size Weighted Size\nSource: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003-2008. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm\nPercent\nMarlboro\nMenthol\nMarlboro\nNonmenthol\nCamel\nNonMenthol\nKool Newport All Others\nMenthol\nAll Others\nNonmenthol\nSalem\nhttp://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.com/content/9/S1/S1\nthe stage/trajectory of cigarette smoking or those who\ndo not (usually) buy their cigarettes. Thus, adolescent\nsmokers are probably more prone to misreport the type\nof cigarettes they smoke, including a menthol brand,\nthan adult smokers do.\nAs previously mentioned, collecting information on\nthe type of cigarettes smoked using the 8 or 12 digit\nUPC bar code information on the side of the cigarette\npack may be seen as a solution to the problem of\nobtaining accurate information on whether the brand\nsmoked by an adolescent is menthol or non-menthol.\nHowever, most of the national youth surveys (MTFS,\nNYTS, YRBS) that collect this type of information are\nconducted in a school-setting, a place where adolescents\nwho smoke may not bring their cigarettes and where\nmost schools will not allow it. In household surveys (e.\ng., NSDUH), some of the novice or even experienced\nsmokers may not want their parents/caregivers to know\nYR Age GENDER Menthol Row\nPercent\nROWPER\nROWPER\nSample\nSize\nWeighted\nSize\nhttp://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.com/content/9/S1/S1\nthey smoke. Also, they may be less likely than an adult\nsmoker to have a pack of cigarettes with them. There is\nample evidence that a degree of self-report bias exists in\nreporting the use of mentholated cigarettes, especially\namong adolescents. Assuming that this type of bias is\nfairly constant over time, the increase over time in\nmenthol cigarette use among adolescents and adults is a\nreal one.\nConclusion\nThere is evidence that menthol cigarettes are dispropor-\ntionately smoked by U.S. adolescents, blacks/African\nAmericans, adult females, those living in the Northeast\nof the United States, and those with lower family\nincomes than their counterparts. It is likely that other\ndisparities in menthol cigarette use exist that we have\nnot covered or have not been studied. Based on self-\nreports of menthol cigarette use, the use of menthol\ncigarettes among smokers have increased in recent years\namong adolescents aged 12-17 years, young adults aged\nHispanic men. No upward trend was observed for pre-\ndominantly menthol brands such as NewportTM, Kool,TM\nor SalemTM, although this may be due, at least in part,\ndue to smaller numbers of smokers who smoked these\nspecific brands or sub-brands of cigarettes, which\nresulted in less precise estimates.\nAcknowledgement\nDisclaimer\nThe findings and conclusions in this manuscript are those of the authors\nand do not necessarily represent the official position of the US Government,\nthe US Department of Health and Human Services, or Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\nThis article has been published as part of Tobacco Induced Diseases Volume\n9 Supplement 1, 2011: Mentholated cigarettes and public health.
