To achieve this we will explore some\ncore hypotheses derived from Situational Action Theory about what makes young people crime\nprone and makes places criminogenic, and about the interaction between crime propensity and\ncriminogenic exposure predicting crime events. We will also calculate the expected reduction\nin aggregate levels of crime that will occur as a result of successful interventions targeting crime\npropensity and criminogenic exposure. To test the hypotheses we will utilize a unique set of\nspace\u00adtime budget, small area community survey, land-use and interviewer-led questionnaire data\nfrom the prospective longitudinal Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Development Study\n(PADS+) and an artificial neural network approach to modelling. The results show that people's\ncrime propensity (based on their personal morals and abilities to exercise self-control) has the\nbulk of predictive power, but also that including criminogenic exposure (being unsupervised\nwith peers and engaged in unstructured activities in residential areas of poor collective efficacy\nCorresponding author:\nPer-Olof H Wikstr\u00f6m, Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge, Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge,\nEmail: pow20@cam.ac.uk\nArticle\nor commercial centres) demonstrates a substantial increase in predictive power (in addition to\ncrime propensity). Moreover, the results show that the probability of crime is strongest when\na crime-prone person is in a criminogenic setting and, crucially, that the higher a person's crime\npropensity the more vulnerable he or she is to influences of criminogenic exposure. Finally, the\nfindings suggest that a reduction in people's crime propensity has a much bigger impact on their\ncrime involvement than a reduction in their exposure to criminogenic settings.\n",

Criminological theories (and research) tend to focus on\nthe role of either people (propensities) or places (environmental inducements) in crime\ncausation; rarely do they consider how both may be explained (and analysed) within a\ncommon theoretical framework. And yet arguably neither can be adequately explained\n(and studied) without taking the other into consideration (Wikstr\u00f6m and Treiber, 2016).\nDiscussing individual (people) and community (place) oriented research traditions in\ncriminology, Albert Reiss Jr. convincingly argued quite some time ago that `more is to be\ngained by linking those traditions than by their continued separate development and test-\ning' (1986: 29). To bridge this divide and integrate key insights about the role of people\nand places in crime causation, and to move beyond (at times) unfruitful competition and\nconflict between person- and place-oriented approaches, we argue that (proper) situa-\ntional analysis should form the foundation of criminological theory. However, `research-\ners have thus far done little to develop a systematic situational perspective' (LaFree and\nBirkbeck, 1991: 73), a statement that is still largely valid.\nTo overcome the neglect of (proper) situational analysis and advance knowledge\nabout crime and its causes, we specifically maintain that criminology needs at its core (i)\nan adequate action theory1 that helps integrate key insights from people- and place-ori-\nented approaches (Kroneberg et al., 2010; Wikstr\u00f6m, 2004), and (ii) data and methodolo-\ngies that better allow us to study the role of and test hypotheses about the\nperson\u00adenvironment interaction (Wikstr\u00f6m et al., 2012a). In this study we aim to help\nbridge the gap between people- and place-oriented approaches and advance knowledge\n\u00ad theoretically, methodologically and empirically \u00ad about the person\u00adenvironment inter-\naction in crime causation. Guided by Situational Action Theory, and utilizing a unique\nset of space\u00adtime budget, small area community survey, land-use and interviewer-led\nquestionnaire data from the prospective longitudinal Peterborough Adolescent and\nYoung Adult Development Study (PADS+) and an artificial neural network approach to\nmodelling, we will explore some hypotheses about what makes people crime prone and\nmakes places (settings) criminogenic, and specifically test the interactional hypothesis\nthat young people vary in their vulnerability to criminogenic exposure depending on\ntheir level of crime propensity.\nSituational Action Theory\nSituational Action Theory (SAT) is a general, dynamic and mechanism-based theory of\nrule-breaking and stresses the importance of the person\u00adenvironment interaction and the\nneed to properly understand and explicate the action mechanism that links people and\ntheir immediate environments to their actions, such as acts of crime. SAT insists that\npeople are the source of their actions (people perceive, choose and execute their actions)\nbut that the causes of their actions are situational (people's particular perception of action\nalternatives, process of choice and execution of action are triggered and guided by the\nrelevant input from the person\u00adenvironment interaction).\nWhereas most major criminological theories (such as control and opportunity theo-\nries2) seem to work under the (human nature) assumption that people's action choices are\nmainly driven by self-interest (Agnew, 2014), SAT asserts that humans are essentially\nrule-guide creatures and society (social order) is based on shared rules of conduct\n(Wikstr\u00f6m, 2010). SAT defines and analyses acts of crime as moral actions, that is,\n`actions which are guided by value-based rules of conduct specifying what is the right or\nwrong thing to do (or not do) in response to particular motivations in particular circum-\nstances'. Acts of crime are specifically defined as `breaches of rules of conduct stated in\nlaw', and this is what all acts of crime, in all places, at all times, have in common. SAT\nasserts that the same process that explains why people follow or break rules of law should\nalso explain why they follow or break other kinds of moral rules (for example, informal\nrules of conduct).\nMost leading criminological theory tends to focus on either person-oriented or envi-\nronment-oriented explanatory factors (although some theories pay lip-service to the\nimportance of both, they typically do not explicate in any detail \u00ad or at all \u00ad how personal\nand environmental factors interact in the explanation of acts of crime3). To bridge this\ndivide, and integrate key insights about the role of people and places in crime causation,\nwe need to focus on situational analysis. While most uses of the term `situation'in crimi-\nnology seem to refer to the immediate environment and most `situational analyses' seem\nto differentiate between people and situations (see, for example, Birkbeck and LaFree,\n1993), SAT maintains that a situation is a particular person's perception of action alterna-\ntives (on which basis he or she makes choices) that emerge when he or she takes part in\na certain setting (immediate environment) facing a particular potent motivator. A situa-\ntion is thus not the setting (immediate environment) but the particular perception of\naction alternatives in response to a potent motivator that appear out of a specific person\u00ad\nenvironment interaction (Figure 1).\nSAT insists that acts of crime are always an outcome of a `person propensity \u00ad envi-\nronmental inducements' interaction and that crime cannot be properly understood by\nfocusing on just one aspect. A person's particular crime propensities are triggered by\nspecific features of a setting, and a setting's particular criminogenic inducements are\nmade relevant by a person's specific propensities (although the relative importance of a\nperson's crime propensities and a setting's criminogenic inducements may vary by cir-\ncumstance). However, to argue that acts of crime are an outcome of the person\u00adenviron-\nment interaction does not take us far in explaining why crime happens. It is only when we\ncan identify what makes people crime prone and what makes environments crimino-\ngenic, and, crucially, specify how their interaction may trigger acts of crime, that we have\nreached some understanding of the causes of crime.\nAgainst the background that people are rule-guided creatures and that crime is essen-\ntially rule-breaking behaviour, SAT proposes that people's crime propensity (the ten-\ndency to see and choose acts of crime as an action alternative) is largely dependent on\ntheir law-relevant personal morals (internalized rules of conduct, including supporting\nmoral emotions such as shame and guilt) and their ability to exercise self-control (the\nability to withstand external pressure to act against one's own personal morals).4 The\ncloser a person's personal morals correspond to specific rules of conduct stated in the\nlaw, the less prone he or she is to violate these rules. The stronger a person's ability to\nexercise self-control, the less likely he or she is to be enticed to act contrary to his or her\nown personal morals. SAT predicts, at one extreme, that people with strong law-relevant\npersonal morals and a strong ability to exercise self-control are largely resistant to\nmomentary criminogenic influences of settings, whereas at the other extreme those who\nhave weak law-relevant personal morals and a poor ability to exercise self-control are\nvulnerable to momentary influences of criminogenic settings.5\nThe theory proposes that the criminogenic features of a setting (the immediate envi-\nronment a person at any given time can experience with his or her senses) is largely\ndependent on its (perceived) law-relevant moral context (the moral norms and their\nenforcement relevant to the motivations \u00ad temptations and provocations \u00ad people may\nexperience in the setting). Settings (places) are criminogenic to the extent that\nFigure 1. The relationship between person, setting and situation illustrated.\ntheir (perceived) moral norms,6 and their level of enforcement, encourage (or do not\ndiscourage) acts of crime in response to the opportunities they provide and/or the fric-\ntions they create.7\nThe PEA hypothesis\nThe situational model of SAT is captured in the PEA hypothesis (for example, Wikstr\u00f6m,\n2014): for any particular motivation (temptation or provocation), the resulting action\n(A), for example an act that constitutes a crime, is an outcome of a perception\u00adchoice\nprocess () that results from the interaction (\u00d7) between relevant personal propensities\n(P) and exposure to relevant setting inducements (E).\nP \u00d7 E  A\nMotivation is a situational concept. SAT defines motivation as `goal-directed attention'\nand asserts that there are two main kinds of motivators: temptations and provocations.8\nTemptations arise when there is an opportunity to satisfy a desire or to fulfil a commitment.\nProvocations occur when a friction (an unwanted external interference) causes anger or\nannoyance towards the perceived source of the friction or a substitute (see, further,\nWikstr\u00f6m, 2014: 79). The perception\u00adchoice process () is crucial for understanding a\nperson's actions. Perception (the selective information we get from our senses) is what\nlinks a person to his or her environment, and choice (the formation of an intention to act in\none way or another) is what links a person to his or her actions (see, further, Wikstr\u00f6m,\n2006: 76\u00ad84). The perception\u00adchoice process may be more or less automated (determinis-\ntic) \u00ad ranging from a fully habitual to a more reasoned process \u00ad depending on the circum-\nperception\u00adchoice process is most likely to be of a habitual nature when people operate in\nfamiliar circumstances with congruent rule-guidance (or are under high levels of stress or\nemotion) and most likely to involve reasoning when people operate in unfamiliar circum-\nstances or circumstances with conflicting potent rule-guidance. SAT asserts that acts of\ncrime are most likely to happen (being seen and chosen as an acceptable action alternative)\nwhen a crime-prone person responds (habitually or deliberatively) to a potent motivator\n(temptation or provocation) in a criminogenic setting.\nAccording to SAT, changes in people's actions (including their acts of crime) are a\nresult of changes in their personal propensities and/or environmental exposure because\nsuch changes affect the input to the perception\u00adchoice process that guides people's action\nKey issues in testing the core situational hypothesis of SAT\nBased on the more general PEA hypothesis, the main proposition to be tested in this paper\nis that young people are differentially vulnerable to criminogenic exposure depending on\ntheir crime propensity. More specifically we hypothesize that young people with a low\ncrime propensity are largely immune to criminogenic exposure whereas young people\nwith a high crime propensity are increasingly vulnerable to criminogenic exposure.\nMeasuring spatio-temporal interaction effects\nA crucial test of our hypothesis is whether acts of crime are predicted by the spatio-\ntemporal interaction between people's crime propensity and criminogenic exposure.\nInteraction effects are usually estimated in statistical analysis by studying how the effect\nof one independent variable (for example criminogenic exposure) on the outcome vari-\nable (for example crime involvement) depends on the magnitude of another independent\nvariable (for example crime propensity). Typically the data used in such studies (for\nexample questionnaire data) refer to different scales (for example, one scale measuring\ncriminogenic exposure, one scale measuring crime propensity and one scale measuring\ncrime involvement) that are spatio-temporally unconnected. This is not unproblematic\nbecause, even if such a study shows a strong statistical interaction effect (for example,\nthat time spent in criminogenic settings is predictive of the crime frequency only for\nthose with a higher crime propensity), it does not conclusively demonstrate that acts of\ncrime are actually most likely to happen when crime-prone people are in criminogenic\nsettings (because there is no spatio-temporal link in the data between being in a crimino-\ngenic setting and committing an act of crime).\nArguably, the ultimate (correct) test of our interactional hypothesis requires exploring\nwhether the elements of propensity, exposure and crime converge in time and space. In\nother words, do crime-prone people tend to commit acts of crime when they are in crimi-\nnogenic settings? To properly test this assumption we need data that locate particular\npeople in particular settings at particular times and tell us whether or not they committed\nacts of crime in those particular settings at those particular times. The unique space\u00adtime\nbudget methodology used in PADS+ helps us achieve this (see further the section on\nData and measurements below).\nCrime causation \u00ad A question of minutes rather than years\nSAT asserts that the causes of action, such as acts of crime, are situational. It is the com-\nbination of a particular person in a particular setting that triggers (and guides) a percep-\ntion\u00adchoice process that, depending on the input, may or may not encourage an act of\ncrime.9 Importantly, there is no causal ordering between propensity and exposure because\nit is their specific blend that initiates (and guides) the perception\u00adchoice process respon-\nsible for what action is taken (Figure 2). The causal time-ordering is thus between the\ninteraction (`the trigger') and the action (`the outcome'). This is allegedly normally a\nprocess of minutes (or in some instances even seconds). The main methodological impli-\ncation of this is that ideally we should aim to have data (measurements) of people's\npropensity, exposure and crimes that are as close as possible in time \u00ad preferably meas-\nured concurrently.\nThe importance of time-ordering the `cause' and the `effect' is often stressed as a key\nelement in testing causal hypotheses. However, time-ordering between cause and effect\nis only one necessary but far from sufficient criterion for causation.10 The often voiced\nopinion that longitudinal studies are (always) better than cross-sectional studies when the\nresearcher aims to address questions of causation is highly misguided when examining\nsituational factors because longitudinal data are typically collected on an annual basis. It\nis hardly an advantage to have annually time-ordered data when exploring situational\nfactors and processes; in fact, cross-sectional data are more apt. It would, of course, be\nadvantageous if the trigger\u00adoutcome (interaction\u00adaction) sequence could be time-\nordered, but very few research designs and existing data (including ours) make time-\nordering of interaction and action in terms of minutes possible. In practice, therefore, the\n(second-)best option when studying situational factors and processes is to aim to meas-\nure propensity, exposure and crime as close as possible in time (and make the reasonable\nassumption that the `interaction' produces the `action' rather than the other way around).\nSpace\u00adtime budget methodology helps us spatio-temporally link crime propensity, crim-\ninogenic exposure and acts of crime.\nBeyond neighbourhoods \u00ad Measuring settings and exposure\nSAT proposes that only the part of the environment (`the setting') that a person experi-\nences with his or her senses can influence his or her perception of action alternatives and\nchoices. Exploring the person\u00adenvironment interaction therefore requires that we have\nmeasures of settings (immediate environments) that approximate as closely as possible\nthe part of the environment that a person in a location is likely to directly experience. The\naim should be to collect environmental data about the smallest possible geographical\nunits (see, further, Oberwittler and Wikstr\u00f6m, 2009). Moreover, since people are not\nstationary but move around in space, we need a methodology that can also account for\ntheir activity fields, that is, their exposure to different settings (environments) during the\nstudy period. Even if people live in the same house and belong to the same family, they\nmay, depending on their specific way of life, have a widely varying exposure to particu-\nlar environments \u00ad for example criminogenic settings \u00ad within and outside their neigh-\nMost existing studies of the role of the environment and the person\u00adenvironment\ninteraction in crime causation are based on large (and therefore typically environmen-\ntally heterogeneous) geographical areas, and usually the person's environment is repre-\nsented only by the area surrounding his or her residence (`the neighbourhood'). In\npractice these are therefore studies of how the interaction between people's characteris-\ntics and their neighbourhood characteristics predict their crime involvement (ignoring\nthe wider environment in which a person operates), and usually the data on environments\nFigure 2. The causal interaction hypothesis illustrated.\nand crime commission are not spatio-temporally linked (for examples, see Simcha-Fagan\nbudget methodology combined with a small area community survey helps us to over-\ncome these problems and advance towards the goal of better measuring the environmen-\ntal features of settings and people's activity fields (that is, their specific configuration of\nexposure to different kinds of settings).\nData and measurements\nThe data for this study are taken from the Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult\nDevelopment Study (PADS+). This is an ongoing longitudinal study of a cohort of 716\nrandomly selected boys and girls from the UK city of Peterborough who turned 12 in\n2003. The study has so far completed nine waves of data collection. The first wave con-\nsisted of one-to-one interviews with each participant's main care-giver (parent) and the\nsubsequent eight waves consisted of data collection conducted with the participants\nthemselves via one-to-one psychometric tests and space\u00adtime budgets, and interviewer-\nled small group questionnaires. In addition, a range of official records (for example\npolice records and census data) have been collected for the participants and for geo-\ngraphical areas in Peterborough, and two special small area community surveys have\nbeen carried out (in 2005 and 2012) with random samples of the Peterborough popula-\ntion aged 18 and older for each output area in the city (output areas are small geographi-\ncal areas with, on average, 300 residents).11 For detailed information about the study\nlysed in this paper refer only to Phase 1 of the PADS+ data collection. Phase 1 focuses\non adolescence and consists of annually collected data covering the ages 13\u00ad17 (the\nstudy is very high and at age 17 (wave 6) 97 percent of the initial sample still took part.\nSpace\u00adtime budgets\nThe space\u00adtime budget methodology is the basis for the spatio-temporal matching of\ndata about people (crime propensities), settings (criminogenic features) and actions\n(crime).12 The space\u00adtime budget places a person in a setting (output area) at a specific\nhour and thereby directly links the person to the setting spatio-temporally. The space\u00ad\ntime budget also collects data about the circumstances in which he or she takes part in\nthe setting (for example, with whom and doing what) and data about whether or not he\nor she committed an act of crime when in the setting (thereby directly linking acts of\ncrime and settings spatio-temporally). For details of the space\u00adtime budget and its cod-\nSmall area community survey\nSpace\u00adtime budgets thus allow us to analyse on an hourly basis where young people\nwere (at what geographical locations), in what circumstances (for example, doing what\nwith whom) and whether or not they committed an act of crime. However, they do not\nprovide data about the wider moral context (for example, the output area's level of col-\nlective efficacy) in which young people encounter particular circumstances (for exam-\nple, socialize unsupervised with peers). The space\u00adtime budget data have therefore been\ncomplemented with relevant environmental data from a specially designed small area\ncommunity survey carried out by the PADS+ research team by a postal survey in the year\nThe city of Peterborough was (in 2005) divided into 518 output areas (with an average\nof 125 households). A random sample was drawn from the electoral register of people\naged 18 or older for each output area to ensure sufficient data for each of the 518 output\nareas. It was judged that having a minimum of 10 respondents in each area would be suf-\nficient to achieve reliable measures of output area collective features (for further details\nabout and tests of the validity of this argument, see Oberwittler and Wikstr\u00f6m, 2009 \u00ad see\nalso Snijders and Bosker, 1999). The average number of respondents per output area was\nsenting an overall response rate of 53 percent (for more details about the small area com-\nmunity survey, its design, reliability and validity, and the content of the questionnaire,\ndirectly linked spatially to the space\u00adtime budget at the output area level. However, in\ncontrast to the space\u00adtime budget, there is no temporal dimension of the small area com-\nmunity survey.\nCollective efficacy is a concept that combines residents' social cohesion and their\ninformal social control potential and aims to measure residents' willingness to intervene\nfor the common good, such as to prevent disorder and crime (Sampson et al., 1997). We\nselected collective efficacy as our prime measure of the moral context of a setting because\nit is an established and tested measure (for example, Duncan et al., 2003; Sampson and\nWikstr\u00f6m, 2008) with a focus on the level of residents' enforcement of key common\nrules of conduct relevant to young people. We used the original questions suggested by\nSampson et al. (1997) with one modification.13 The Cronbach's alpha of the combined\nscales was a highly satisfactory .87. The measure was scaled so that high values meant\npoor collective efficacy (that is, low social cohesion and weak informal social control).\nAs recommended by Sampson et al. (1997), the scale we use to classify output area lev-\nels of poor collective efficacy is an empirical Bayes estimate adjusted for individual-\nlevel socio-demographic composition (for details, see Wikstr\u00f6m et al., 2012b: 143\u00ad6).\nLand-use data\nOne limitation of the 2005 small area community survey data is that it is largely restricted\nto residents' generalized observations of other residents' relationships and behaviour.\nSocial life and controls in urban areas are determined not only by residents but also by\nthe quantity and characteristics of temporary populations (visitors) that frequent the area\nand their activities. One kind of urban area that tends to have particularly high levels of\nvisitors and non-residential activities (for example commerce and entertainment) is city\nand local centres, and because such features are an important aspect of area social life\nand control we decided to classify, based on land-use data, whether or not an output area\nwas a city or local centre area. As is the case for the small area community survey, these\ndata are spatially linked to the other data but lack a temporal dimension (that is, data\nabout day and hourly variations). We make the assumption that these data satisfactorily\nrepresent the relevant impact of visitors and non-residential activities on the social life\nand control in the output area (although we are aware, of course, that centre area activi-\nties tend to be very different at different times of the day, being focused on commerce\nduring the day and on entertainment at night).\nThe measure of criminogenic settings\nSpace\u00adtime budget data, complemented with data from the small area community survey\nand land-use data, provide information about what kinds of settings (circumstances and\ntheir moral context) a person has taken part in during the studied periods and their acts\nof crime.14 The criteria in this study for a setting to qualify as criminogenic for young\npeople are that the output area is an area with poor collective efficacy (defined as belong-\ning to the output areas with the 25 percent highest scores of poor collective efficacy) or\na city or local centre area and the young person taking part in the setting is engaged in\nunstructured and unsupervised activities with peers.\nQuestionnaires \u00ad Measuring crime propensity\nTo explore the interaction between personal propensity and setting exposure as causes of\nacts of crime, data about the participants'crime propensity need to be added. To measure\npeople's crime propensity we use an index that combines standardized values (Z-scores)\nfrom a scale of generalized personal morals (for details, see Wikstr\u00f6m et al., 2012b:\n132\u00ad5) and a scale of generalized ability to exercise self-control (for details, see Wikstr\u00f6m\nmorals (for example, Stams et al., 2006) and ability to exercise self-control (for example,\nPratt and Cullen, 2000) are indeed strong predictors of crime involvement.\nAs previously argued, data about people's crime propensity should be collected as\nclose as possible in time to the data about setting exposure and crime commission. The\ndata about the participants' personal morals and abilities to exercise self-control are\ntaken from scales measured on the same occasion as the space\u00adtime budget data.16 When\nexploring the person\u00adsetting interactions, we matched the 2003 data on participants'\ncrime propensity with the 2003 space\u00adtime budget data, the 2004 data on participants'\ncrime propensity with the 2004 space\u00adtime budget data, and so forth, to make sure that\nthe measurement of people's crime propensity was temporally linked as closely as pos-\nsible to the measurement of their criminogenic exposure and crimes. This also means\nthat any age-related (annual) changes over the study period (ages 13 to 17) in a partici-\npant's crime propensity were taken into account when analysing the person\u00adexposure\ninteraction.\nAnalytic strategy\nTo explore how young people's crime propensity and the proposed criminogenic factors\nof the environment, in combination, can predict acts of crime, we will use an artificial\nneural network modelling approach. We will first test the predictive power of crime pro-\npensity and the elements making up criminogenic exposure and, then, test the PEA\nhypothesis by studying how the influence of criminogenic exposure (exposure vs. non-\nexposure) during a particular hour affects the probability of crime in that same hour for\nyoung people with different levels of crime propensity. Finally, and based on the out-\ncome of the analysis of the propensity\u00adexposure interaction, we will estimate the impact\nof (hypothetical) successful reductions in crime propensity and criminogenic exposure\nfor young people's crime involvement.\nArtificial neural network modelling\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are highly flexible tools for performing non-linear\nregression and classification (for example, Bishop, 2009) that so far have had a rather\nlimited application in criminological studies (for example, Olligschlaeger, 1997). An\nANN specifies a mapping between input and output variables of interest; here the inputs\nare the various factors hypothesized to contribute to the commission of acts of crime,\nand the output is the probability that a crime is committed in a particular hour. We will\nselect the optimal model \u00ad the set of factors that have the greatest predictive power \u00ad via\ncross-validation. That is, we will randomly split the original data set into two parts, the\ntraining data, which are used to fit the model and estimate its parameters, and the test\ndata, which we aim to predict using the fitted model. Each ANN uses a specific set of\nincluded factors as the predictors of crime probability per hour. The ANN was cross-\nvalidated by training on 50 percent of the available data, with 50 percent withheld for\ncross-validation.\nA model predicts the probability that a crime will be committed, based on the availa-\nble information provided by the test input. To evaluate the quality of this prediction\nagainst the actual crimes in the test output data, we will use the receiver operating char-\nacteristic (ROC), a canonical test for the predictive power of a binary classifier (Brown\nand Davis, 2006; Green and Swets, 1966). Setting a threshold probability, and declaring\nthat once this probability is reached we will predict that a crime will be committed, we\ncan test how many true positives (correct identifications of crimes) versus false positives\n(predictions of crimes when none occurred) the model produces. Varying this threshold\nalters the balance between true positives and false positives, producing a characteristic\ncurve, the ROC, which shows how the rate of true positives varies with the rate of false\npositives. The procedure was repeated 10 times with different subsets of the data with-\nheld or used for training to determine the average performance of the ANN.\nThe area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a single number that quantifies the perfor-\nmance of the classifier. An AUC of 1 indicates that all true positives are identified with-\nout any false positives, that is the classifier is perfect. Conversely, anAUC of 0.5 indicates\nthe performance characteristic of a random classifier, that is the classifier is useless. The\nhigher the AUC produced by a model the greater its predictive power.\nANNs that show high predictive power (AUCs) are associated with important factors\nin predicting the outcome (in our case, the occurrence of crime). The cross-validation\nmethod, focusing on the ability to predict data previously unseen by the ANN, identifies\nmodels that generalize well and thus avoids overfitting problems common to regression\nmethods. Thus we can attribute increased predictive performance to identifying factors\nthat genuinely affect the probability that an individual will commit a crime.\nFactors are selected in a `greedy' manner through an iterative process that tries each\nelement on its own, then fixes the most important, then tries all the others next, and fixes\nthe next most important, and so on. That is, all possible one-factor ANNs are tested, and\nthe best performing is selected. This factor is then included in all future ANNs.\nSubsequently all combinations of the best single factor and one other factor are tested to\nfind the best two factors, which are subsequently included in all future ANNs, and so\nforth, until all factors have been included.\nThe collected data have a time-series structure, being the recorded movements and\nactivities of individuals for each hour over four separate days each year (190,508 total\nwaking hours for analysis, including 125 crime hours). As such, temporal correlations\nin the data can be expected to be significant and potentially introduce artefacts such\nas pseudo-replication into our analysis. To account for the time-series nature of the\ndata we always include an autoregressive (AR) component in our models, which con-\ntrols for the possibility that observed crimes are continuations of those that were initi-\nated in the previous hour (this was actually the case for 10 crime hours). The predictive\nmodels are generated as combinations of the other included factors (Table 1). In addi-\ntion to AR and the proposed causally effective factors (crime propensity and the ele-\nments of criminogenic exposure), we also included day of week (D) and time of day\n(T) as `controls'. The rationale for this is that the variables measuring the moral\ncontext (collective efficacy, city and local centres) lack a temporal dimension (if our\nvariables are sufficient to measure exposure then we would expect day and hour to\nhave no residual predictive power). With the AR factor fixed as an element of the\nmodel, and with eight remaining `free' factors, we can generate 28, that is 256, pos-\nsible models, though our `greedy' selection algorithm reduces the number of models\ntested to a more manageable 36.17 In each case the output remains the same \u00ad the\noccurrences of crime \u00ad but the inputs are chosen by which factors are included in each\nmodel.\nTable 1. Factors included in the ROC analysis and their abbreviations.\nCrime propensity\nPS = Crime propensity score (index of personal morals and ability to exercise self-control)\nElements of criminogenic exposure\nUS = Unsupervised (no adult guardians present)\nPPP = Peers present\nLC = In local centre\nCC = In city centre\nUSt = Engaged in unstructured activities\nCE = In area with poor collective efficacy\nControls\nAR = Autoregressive component\nD = Day of week\nT = Time of day\nFindings\nThe predictive power of crime propensity and elements of criminogenic\nexposure\nTo test the predictive power of crime propensity and the elements making up crimino-\ngenic exposure we assessed the value of each factor by using the area under the ROC\n(AUC) to evaluate the predictive accuracy of a series of ANNs. The value of the AUCs\nmay be interpreted in the following way: If we take a random pair of hours, one of which\ncontains crime and one of which doesn't, AUC is the probability that we assign a higher\nprobability of a crime to the hour `with'crime than the one `without'crime based on the\nincluded predictors.\nOur findings show a number of clear facets (Figure 3). Crime propensity (PS) is\nselected first, and has the bulk of the predictive power. Subsequently all the elements that\nconstitute our proposed exposure variable are selected, with an initial substantial increase\nin predictive power for being unsupervised (US) and a subsequent plateau without any\nsignificant drop in prediction for any of the additional elements (PPP, LC, CC, USt, CE)\nthat constitute our measure of criminogenic exposure.\nFigure 3. Crime propensity, elements of criminogenic exposure and controls.\nAnalysis of predictive performance by area under ROC curve (AUC).\nNote: See Table 1 for the key to the abbreviations.\nFigure 4. Probability of crime per waking hour with and without criminogenic exposure by\ncrime propensity.\nThe findings support the use of our proposed criminogenic exposure variable (that is,\ntaking part in unsupervised and unstructured activities with peers in a place of poor col-\nlective efficacy or in the city or a local centre) as a measure of the criminogenic exposure\nof a setting. Day of the week (D) and time of day (T), which were included as controls,\nlead to initially small (D), then large (T) significant decreases in predictive power (con-\nfidence intervals for day and time shown in Figure 3). This is evidence of overfitting, and\nsuggests that, once crime propensity and criminogenic features of the setting (moral\ncontext and circumstances) are accounted for, day and time have no predictive value and\nthat the included elements of criminogenic exposure pick up the day and time variations\nin crime (consequent on the view that they are markers of criminogenic features rather\nthan factors with any causal efficacy). All in all, our measures of crime propensity and\ncriminogenic exposure are strong predictors of the probability of committing acts of\ncrime in a given hour.\nThe interaction between crime propensity and criminogenic exposure in\npredicting the probability of crime in a particular hour\nHaving established the efficacy of the elements of the criminogenic exposure varia-\nble, alongside the predictive power of crime propensity, we now train an ANN on two\nfactors, using 100 percent of the data: crime propensity and the composite crimino-\ngenic exposure variable (that is, unsupervised with peers taking part in unstructured\nactivities in a residential area with poor collective efficacy or in the city or a local\ncentre). We use this to calculate directly the probability that an individual with a\ngiven crime propensity will commit an act of crime when exposed or not. To do this\nwe feed the trained ANN with a range of values of (standardized) crime propensity\nfrom -3 to 3 and of criminogenic exposure with a value of 1 or 0 (exposed vs non-\nexposed). The predicted crime probabilities (that is, the probability that a crime will\noccur in a particular hour) by level of crime propensity are plotted for hours crimino-\ngenically exposed versus unexposed in Figure 4.\nThis result shows several crucial features. Firstly, the probability of committing a\ncrime is strongly, and non-linearly, related to crime propensity (the shaded areas in\nFigure 4 indicate the 95% confidence intervals). Young people with a high crime propen-\nsity commit a disproportionate number of crimes. Even within the group with a high\ncrime propensity (PS > 1), those with the highest propensity are committing a much\nlarger number of crimes per hour than their high propensity peers. Secondly, exposure to\ncriminogenic settings results in a substantial increase in crime probability. This increase\nis, in absolute terms, much higher for those with a high crime propensity. Therefore\ncrimes are disproportionately committed by high crime propensity people in crimino-\ngenic settings. Thirdly, while the estimated probability of committing a crime for young\npeople with a low crime propensity is also higher when in a criminogenic setting, the\ndifference in absolute terms for these young people is negligible (the difference is not\nstatistically significant when crime propensity is less than -1.5, as indicated by the fact\nthat the confidence intervals overlap). Our findings thus give strong support for the PEA\nhypothesis: acts of crime are most likely when crime-prone young people take part in\ncriminogenic settings.18 Moreover, our findings specify this relationship: the higher a\nyoung person's crime propensity the stronger the influence of criminogenic exposure on\nhis or her probability of committing an act of crime. The interaction of people and places\nclearly matters in crime causation.\nA note on the potential problem of `floor effects'\nhours. This fact may cause some colleagues to worry whether our findings are largely a\nresult of the distribution of the crime variable and reflect only a (so-called) floor effect\nclassification methodology. Our neural network predicts the probability that a crime will\noccur or not within a single hour \u00ad a binary variable. This is fitted by maximizing the\nlikelihood of the observed crime/no crime events in the observed hours based on the\nparameters of the neural network (via back-propagation, a gradient descent algorithm for\nneural networks \u00ad see Rumelhart et al., 1986), not via any least-squares method or\nsimilar.\nOur evidence for an interaction effect is simply that the probability of crime rises with\ncrime propensity, as shown in Figure 4, but that it is always higher when there is (stronger)\ncriminogenic exposure. Since the two curves in Figure 4 are not separated by a constant,\nbut instead exhibit a roughly constant ratio, this is most parsimoniously explained by\ncriminogenic exposure and crime propensity interacting \u00ad rather than just summing, as\nper the standard linear model.\nChanges in crime as a result of changes in crime propensity and\ncriminogenic exposure\nAccording to SAT, to change people's crime one can either change people's crime pro-\npensities or their criminogenic exposure19 (or both) because such changes alter the per-\nson\u00adenvironment interaction, which is the input to the perception\u00adchoice process that\naffects whether or not a person is likely to see and choose an act of crime as an action\nalternative in response to potent motivators (Figure 2). For illustrative purposes we have\ncalculated how much reduction in crimes per 1000 hours would result if one succeeded\nin reducing all young people's crime propensity, or all young people's criminogenic\nexposure, by 1 standard deviation (STD) (Table 2). These calculations are based on the\nrelationships between crime propensity, criminogenic exposure and probabilities of\ncrime, as shown in Figure 4. The result suggests that successfully reducing young peo-\nple's crime propensity (as defined here) has a much greater effect on their crimes than\nreducing their criminogenic exposure (as defined here), although both changes would\nlead to reductions in crime.\nConclusions and discussion\nIn this paper we have advocated SAT as a theory that effectively integrates key insights\nfrom people- and place-oriented criminological theory and research, and we have tested\nits core situational hypothesis (the PEA hypothesis) using a unique set of data from the\nPeterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Development Study (PADS+). The PADS+\ndata and methodologies are exceptionally suitable for conducting situational analysis\nbecause they enable detailed spatio-temporal matching of people, places and acts of\ncrime, and provide in-depth data about the circumstances and environments in which\nyoung people with different crime propensities take part (and commit acts of crime). In\nthe present study we have analysed more than 190,000 hours (time awake) of people\n(propensities) and place (environmental inducements) convergences in adolescence\nSAT proposes that humans are essentially rule-guided actors and that the defining\nfeature of acts of crime is that they breach rules of conduct (stated in law) and, therefore,\nlaw-relevant personal morals and the ability to exercise self-control are the key individ-\nual characteristics upon which a person's crime propensity is dependent. The findings\nfrom our study strongly support this assertion by demonstrating that crime propensity\n(measured as an index of law-relevant personal morals and the ability to exercise self-\ncontrol) strongly predicts the probability of committing an act of crime.\nHowever, SAT also stresses that acts of crime are always an outcome of the interac-\ntion between a person's crime propensity and his or her criminogenic exposure, where\ncriminogenic exposure is seen as dependent on the moral context of the setting and the\ncircumstances in which people take part in that context. Our findings show that our\nmeasures of criminogenic exposure are strong predictors of the probability of crime\nTable 2. Crimes per 1000 waking hours (change following propensity or exposure reduction).\nhours\nChange crimes per\nPercent crime\nreduction\n(which add substantially to the predictive power of crime propensity) and, importantly,\nthat the probability of crime is strongest when a crime-prone person (as defined here)\ntakes part in a criminogenic setting (as defined here). Crucially, we find that the higher a\nyoung person's crime propensity the more vulnerable he or she is to influences from\ncriminogenic exposure.\nAlthough our study provides a methodologically and statistically rigorous test of and\nsupports the interactional hypothesis of SAT, it does not examine the proposed action\nmechanism: the presumed perception\u00adchoice process that links the person\u00adenvironment\ninteraction (the trigger) to the action (the outcome). However, previous research from\nPADS+ using randomized scenarios regarding the intended use of violence (varying by\nlevels of provocation and supervision) lends some support to this assumption, showing\nthat those with a high crime propensity (measured in the same way as in this study) were\nmore likely to choose a violent response (especially at lower levels of provocation) than\nThe fact that crime propensity is a stronger predictor of the probability of crime than\ncriminogenic exposure (Figure 3), and that successful reductions in crime propensity\nseemingly lead to larger reductions in crime than successful reductions in criminogenic\nexposure (Table 2), is not unexpected since (as our findings show) criminogenic expo-\nsure largely affects the probability of crime for those with some level of crime propen-\nsity, and particularly (and increasingly) for those with a high crime propensity, whereas\nit has little or no impact on those with a low crime propensity.\nOur results suggest which key personal and environmental factors are implicated in\ncrime causation and, therefore, which factors should be the prime target for crime pre-\nvention policy and intervention. However, our findings say nothing about which are the\nmost effective policies and interventions to affect people's crime propensities and crimi-\nnogenic exposures. They only suggest that if we can devise successful policies and inter-\nvention to affect people's crime propensities (by influencing their law-relevant personal\nmorals and abilities to exercise self-control), and successful policies and interventions to\naffect people's criminogenic exposure (by influencing the law-relevant moral norms of a\nsetting and their enforcement and/or people's access to criminogenic settings), policies\nand intervention that successfully reduce people's crime propensity would most likely be\nthe more effective.20\nIn this paper the focus has been on situational analysis. Situational analysis explains\nwhy crime happens; it specifies the interactions and action mechanisms involved and\ntells us what moves people to action (what causes action) and what factors are important\nin that process. However it does not tell us much about how particular criminogenic situ-\nations (interactions) come about and what (cultural and structural) factors and processes\nare important in this respect. SAT suggests that this is fundamentally a question of how\nprocesses of selection (contemporaneous processes of rules- and resource-based social\nselection, and agency-based self-selection within the constraints of social selection) cre-\nate criminogenic person\u00adenvironment interactions (Wikstr\u00f6m, 2014: 84).\nMoreover, situational analysis does not tell us why people develop different crime\npropensities (dependent on their law-relevant personal morals and abilities to exercise\nself-control), and why places come to vary in their criminogeneity (dependent on their\nlaw-relevant moral norms and their enforcement). SAT suggests that this is largely a\nquestion of emergence (that is, the process by which something becomes as it is). SAT\nasserts that people's crime propensities are largely an outcome of psycho-social pro-\ncesses of person emergence, particularly processes of moral education and cognitive\nnurturing of relevance to people's law-relevant personal morals and abilities to exercise\nself-control (Wikstr\u00f6m and Treiber, 2018). SAT further suggests that the criminogeneity\nof a place is largely an outcome of socio-ecological processes of social emergence, par-\nticularly processes of population and activity spatial and temporal differentiation that are\nof relevance to (time and) place-based law-relevant moral norms and their enforcement\nSituational analysis is arguably the core of the study of crime and its causes. However, to\ngive a comprehensive account of the question of crime causation, situational analysis needs\nto be complemented with analyses and investigations of how (as the `causes of the causes'21)\ncontemporaneous processes of social and self-selection and past processes of social and\nperson emergence are implicated in the creation of the situations that cause acts of crime.\nAuthors' note\nRichard Mann conducted the ANN modelling presented in this paper.

Criminological theories rarely specify a theory of action (a theory about what moves people\nto action). When they do, they typically allude to some version of rational choice theory\n(RCT). However, we do not believe that RCT is a fruitful or satisfactory basis for integrating\npeople- and place-oriented insights about crime causation (for a discussion, see Wikstr\u00f6m and\n 2. See, for example, Hirschi (1969), social bonds; Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990), self-control;\n3. Further on this argument, see, for example, Wikstr\u00f6m and Treiber (2007), re. self-control\ntheory; and Wikstr\u00f6m and Treiber (2016), re. opportunity theory, that is, routine activity and\n 4. Please note that SAT's conceptualization of self-control differs from that in Gottfredson and\nHirschi's (1990) General Theory of Crime (for a discussion, see Wikstr\u00f6m and Treiber, 2007).\nSAT carefully distinguishes between (i) the ability to exercise self-control and (ii) exercising\nself-control. The former is an individual characteristic; the latter a person's active manage-\nment of a situation.\n 5. It should be stressed that SAT acknowledges that people's crime propensity may vary signifi-\ncantly depending on the type of crime in question. To adequately study the causes of specific\ncrimes (rule-breakings) one needs to study the specific propensities and exposures that may\ntrigger and guide actions that break that particular rule of conduct.\n 6. The concepts of `place' and `setting' are closely related and overlapping. According to SAT,\nthe difference is that `place' refers to a specific location in time and space and its immediate\nenvironment (objects, people, events), whereas `setting' refers to the part of the immediate\nenvironment a person in a specific location experiences with his or her senses.\n 7. If a setting has a (perceived) high level of enforcement of moral norms promoting acts of\ncrime in response to its particular opportunities or frictions, this enforcement is criminogenic.\n 8. Motivation is the reason for action. However, people commit particular acts of crime for all\nkinds of reasons.\n 9. SAT applies a `soft' version of causality by acknowledging that there are elements of deter-\nmination (habit) and `free will' (deliberation) in the process when people make choices,\nalthough SAT insists that `free will' is always exercised within the constraints of the action\n10. Causation implies a regularly occurring (asymmetric) association between time-ordered var-\niables that holds universally (or at least in a specific context or in certain circumstances) and\nthat makes it possible to predict one (the effect) from the other (the cause). However, the idea\nof causation is not only the idea of a regular association (and the possibility of prediction)\nbut, crucially, also the idea that the cause in some way produces the effect through a causal\nprocess that links the cause to the effect (see, for example, Bunge, 2004; Psillos, 2002).\n11. The neighbourhood units in criminological studies typically have average population sizes\n12. The space\u00adtime budget methodology was first used in criminology in the Peterborough Youth\nStudy (Wikstr\u00f6m and Butterworth, 2006), a cross-sectional forerunner to PADS+, in which\nthe technique was piloted and later refined for inclusion in PADS+.\n13. We dropped one item asking about the residents' likelihood to intervene if a local fire station\nwas threatened with budget cuts from the original informal control scale because it signifi-\ncantly reduced the scale's internal consistency.\n14. Which particular circumstances help make a setting criminogenic may depend on the specific\nage(s) and/or type(s) of crime under study.\n15. Each scale was standardized over the five included years (ages). The self-control scale is a\nmodified version of the Grasmick et al. (1993) scale, and the scale of law-relevant morality is\nlargely based on a scale from the Pittsburgh Youth Study.\n16. The space\u00adtime budget data refer to the days immediately preceding the time of the data col-\nlection. There is no reason to believe that people's crime propensities (based on their personal\nmorals and ability to exercise self-control) will display any significant change over such a\nshort period of time (other than in very extreme cases). The annual correlations of the index\nof crime propensity for the five included years varies between 0.69 and 0.76 (Wikstr\u00f6m et al.,\n17. The algorithm reduces the number of models tested to 36 by selecting each factor iteratively.\nHence, for example, we investigate only two factor models that include auto-regression, the\nfactor selected for a single factor model. Likewise, our search over three factor models covers\nonly those models incorporating both auto-regression and individual propensity, and so on.\nThis means that we search over 8 + 7 + ... 1 = 36 models in total, as the number of remaining\nfactors to be selected from at each stage decreases by one.\n18. There is also an increase in absolute terms in the probability of crime by level of crime\npropensity for settings classified as `other' but not as dramatic as for those defined as crimi-\nnogenic (please recall that our classification of a criminogenic setting is rather conservative\nand that the settings classified as `other' may included several of the criminogenic elements\njointly defining a criminogenic setting).\n19. Reductions in criminogenic exposure can be accomplished either by interventions reducing\nthe criminogeneity of the settings a person takes part in and/or by interventions that limit his\nor her access to such settings (places).The latter is accomplished mainly by influencing pro-\ncesses of social and self-selection (or through incapacitation).\n20. Developmentally, exposure and propensity are not unrelated, with, for example, the implica-\ntion that, in the longer term, policies and interventions targeting exposure may also affect\npeople's crime propensities.\n21. Causes of the causes are causally effective factors and processes further back in a causal\nchain, for example factors and processes that form and shape a person's crime propensities\nReferences\nAgnew R (2014) Social concern and crime: Moving beyond the assumption of simple self-interest.\nBellair PE (1997) Social interaction and community crime: Examining the importance of neigh-\nBirkbeck C and LaFree G (1993) The situational analysis of crime and deviance.
