The authors examined the association between outdoor leisure\nphysical activity and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the Third National Health and Nutrition  \naged 60 or more years. In contrast, the mean difference in 25-hydroxyvitamin D between those who participated in\noutdoor activities daily compared with those who did not participate in the past month was similar for the youngest\nand oldest age groups: 13 and 16 nmol/liter, respectively. Those persons aged 60 or more years who participated\nin daily outdoor activities had a mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration similar to that of persons aged 20\u00ad39\nyears: 77 versus 79 nmol/liter, respectively. These nationally representative data suggest that persons aged 60 or\nmore years can synthesize enough vitamin D from daily outdoor activities to maintain vitamin D levels similar to\nthose of young adults.\naged; ethnic groups; exercise; vitamin D\nAbbreviation: NHANES III, Third National Health and Nutrition  .\nEditor's note: An invited commentary on this article\nappears on page 587, and the authors' response appears on\nIncreasing evidence suggests that low vitamin D status is\na risk factor for a range of diseases, including bone disease,\ninfection, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (1).\nA recent meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials including\nmore than 57,000 participants demonstrated a significant\nreduction in all-cause mortality among older individuals\nassigned to vitamin D supplements (2).

Vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D,\n<50 nmol/liter) is much more common among non-\nHispanic Blacks (in winter ranging from 53 percent to 76 per-\ncent across the main age-sex subgroups) than in Mexican\npercent) (9). Studies of vitamin D photosynthesis have\nshown that non-Whites have a similar capacity to synthesize\nvitamin D, but they require longer exposure to sunlight to\nachieve a similar vitamin D response because of their in-\nOutdoor activities increase body vitamin D levels through\nsun-induced synthesis of vitamin D. Previous studies have\nshown a positive association between physical activity, in\ngeneral, and vitamin D status. Blood levels of 25-hydroxy-\nvitamin D have been observed to be higher in weightlifters\nand track athletes than matched sedentary controls in some\nsmall sample sizes (n < 60) that may have decreased power\nto detect an association between physical activity and\n25-hydroxyvitamin D.\nFew epidemiologic studies have examined the relation\nbetween leisure-time physical activity and vitamin D status\nin the general population. In the early 1990s, a cross-sectional\nsurvey of middle-aged men in New Zealand found that\nmen who engaged in weekly leisure-time aerobic activities\n(indoor and outdoor combined) had significantly increased\nplasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D compared with in-\nactive men after adjustment for weekly hours of sunshine\nexposure, especially in winter (16). In a healthy workforce\nsample, also in New Zealand, the mean level of serum\n, the vitamin D metabolite formed\nmainly from sun exposure and which comprises the major\nportion of body vitamin D (1), was higher in people en-\ngaging in vigorous (aerobic) leisure physical activities\ncompared with those who were inactive, after adjustment\nfor age, sex, ethnicity, and time of year (17); moreover,\nthose who participated in outdoor versus indoor activities.\nRecent reports have confirmed these earlier findings. Analy-\nses of male US health professionals showed that participants\nin the highest quintile of leisure-time physical activity had a\n13.5 nmol/liter higher level of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D\nthan those in the lowest activity quintile (18). A cross-\nsectional survey in Florida found that osteoporosis patients\nwho reported participating in outdoor exercisewere 47 percent\nless likely to have hypovitaminosis D (25-hydroxyvitamin D,\n30 ng/ml or 75 nmol/liter) than were nonoutdoor exercisers\n(19). Finally, Dutch studies of older people living in the com-\nmunity have observed a positive association between the level\nof physical activity and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (20) and\nreported that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased by\n1.8 nmol/liter for each hour per day of outdoor activity (21).\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III) involved a representative sample of\nthe US civilian population, who were interviewed during\nments from over 19,000 participants, NHANES III offers\na unique opportunity to examine the association between\nleisure-time physical activity and vitamin D status, as well\nas whether the observed association varies with place of\nactivity (outdoor or indoor), type of activity (vigorous or\nmoderate), age, race/ethnicity, and time of year.\nA cross-sectional survey representative of the US civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population (NHANES III) was carried\nStatistics.

Of these, 18,825 were\ninterviewed at home, 16,573 of whom attended mobile ex-\namination centers.

For milk consumption, participants\nwere asked how often they had milk to drink or on cereal.\nThe four questions on frequency of consumption of break-\nfast cereal, generally fortified with 40\u00ad50 IU of vitamin\nD per 28-g serving (23), covered the major brands for cold\ncereals plus cooked, hot cereals.

With regard to race/ethnicity, non-\nHispanic Whites were most likely to engage in both outdoor\nand indoor activities and Mexican Americans least likely.\nThe proportion engaging in outdoor and indoor activity\nalso varied by month, being lowest in January-February\nand increasing to a peak in July-August before declining\nagain.\nThe adjusted mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concen-\ntrations varied between levels of demographic and lifestyle\nvariables (table 2).

For race/\nethnicity, vitamin D was highest in non-Hispanic Whites,\nintermediate in Mexican Americans, and lowest in non-\nHispanic Blacks. Vitamin D levels were inversely associated\nwith body mass index. The expected seasonal variation in\n25-hydroxyvitamin D was present, with levels being lowest\nin March-April and highest in July-October, adjusting for\ncovariates.\nVitamin D concentrations were also related to lifestyle,\nbeing positively associated with frequency of milk intake in\nthe last month and with daily amount of vitamin D supple-\nment intake, but not with cereal intake.

In\nparticular, consistent with previous research (17), it is the\nplace of physical activity (outdoor rather than indoor) and\nthe frequency of activity rather than the intensity that are\nrelated to vitamin D status (table 3).\nPrevious research has shown that the capacity to synthe-\nsize vitamin D from solar ultraviolet B exposure decreases\nwith age (6). A somewhat surprising observation in the\npresent study was that the 25-hydroxyvitamin D increase\nwith daily outdoor activity in people aged 60 or more years\nwas as great as that in people aged 20\u00ad39 years (figure 1).\nOne explanation is that older people, who are mostly retired,\nmay spend more time outside each time they participate in\nphysical activity than younger and middle-aged people who\nare mostly working. Another explanation is that adults aged\nless than 60 years, who are mostly working, are less able to\ndo physical activity in the middle of the day when ultraviolet\nradiation from the sun is strongest (30). The elevated serum\n25-hydroxyvitamin D level in people aged 60 or more years\nwho participated in daily outdoor physical activity indicates\nthat this activity pattern can minimize and potentially pre-\nvent the age-related decline in body vitamin D status. This\nfinding is consistent with that of a recent survey of people\naged 60\u00ad87 years who were living in a Dutch town (i.e., that\noutdoor activities were associated with significantly higher\nplasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels) (21).\nThe increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with daily\noutdoor physical activity occurred in all seasons (table 4).\nThis result was also surprising because solar radiation is\nstrongest in summer and weakest in winter when prolonged\nsun exposure (>4 hours) is required for skin to synthesize\nvitamin D at latitudes above 25 degrees, particularly\nabove 42 degrees North where no synthesis takes place\n(30, 31). However, interviews in NHANES III were carried\nout mainly in the southern states during winter and in the\nnorthern states during summer to ensure optimal weather\nconditions for interviewing (9). Thus, the NHANES III\nsample will have overestimated solar radiation exposure\nin winter and underestimated it in summer, since the inten-\nsity of solar radiation is inversely associated with latitude\nThe greater increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D with daily\noutdoor activity in non-Hispanic Whites, compared with\nTABLE 4.

The maximum mean level of serum\n25-hydroxyvitamin D of 52 nmol/liter in non-Hispanic\nBlacks observed among those who engaged in daily outdoor\nactivity (table 4) is of concern, given recent evidence sug-\ngesting that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels need to be\nabove 75 nmol/liter for optimum health (32). Other strate-\ngies, such as vitamin D supplementation or fortification of\nfood, as already occurs with milk, are required to elevate\n25-hydroxyvitamin D in African Americans to the above\ndesired level during winter months at higher latitudes. The\nlack of an association between cereal consumption and se-\nrum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (table 2) contrasts with results for\nAfrican American and White women aged 15\u00ad49 years from\nthe same study that showed significantly higher unadjusted\nvitamin D levels for women in the highest cereal consump-\ntion category, although the significant association between\nserum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and cereals remained only in\nBlack women after adjusting for covariates that included\nmilk consumption (23). In our analyses, there was a signif-\nicant positive association (p < 0.001) between the frequency\nof cereal intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D when milk\nwas excluded from the model (data not shown), indicating\nthat milk consumption was a positive confounder. Thus,\nmay have been associated with vitamin D status in sub-\ngroups such as young Black women (23), but not in the total\npopulation.\nDaily outdoor physical activity was associated with an\nincrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D similar to that of daily\nconsumption of milk, both about 10 nmol/liter (table 2),\nindicating that both are likely to be effective strategies for\nmodest increases in body levels of vitamin D. Daily con-\nsumption of at least 400 IU of vitamin D supplements was\nassociated with a smaller increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D\nof about 5 nmol/liter (table 2), a little lower than the reported\nor\nnation is that many participants may have used vitamin D2\nthat does not increase 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as much as\nvitamin D3\n(34). More importantly, recent studies indicate\nthat much higher levels (e.g., 4,000 IU per day) are required\nto increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels up to 100\nthe larger-dosed vitamin D supplements would assist\nindividuals living at higher latitudes to have optimal levels\nof 25-hydroxyvitamin D.\nThe finding of a strong association between outdoor phys-\nical activity and vitamin D status has implications for public\nhealth. The data in table 1 show that 22 percent of all US\nadults did not participate in any outdoor physical activity in\nthe past month at the time NHANES III was carried out. Of\nconcern, those groups with the lowest vitamin D levels--the\nelderly, Mexican Americans, and non-Hispanic Blacks--\nwere least likely to have reported engaging in any outdoor\nphysical activity in the past month. Public health interven-\ntions supporting outdoor activities probably would improve\nthe vitamin D status of these communities. Previous\nresearch suggests that a 10 nmol/liter increase in 25-hydroxy-\nvitamin D from daily outdoor physical activity (table 3)\ncould result in modest but important reductions in disease\nrates. For example, a recent meta-analysis of randomized\nclinical trials has shown that a weighted vitamin D dose\nof 528 IU/day, estimated to have increased 25-hydroxy-\nnmol/liter, reduced total mortality by 7 percent (2). A\ncohort study of US health professionals observed that\na 25 nmol/liter increase in predicted plasma 25-hydroxy-\nvitamin D was associated with a 17 percent reduction in\ntotal cancer incidence (37), equivalent to a 7 percent reduc-\ntion for a 10 nmol/liter increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D.\nThe association between outdoor physical activity and\nvitamin D status provides another mechanism for how\nphysical activity may lower chronic disease risk. The well-\ndocumented inverse association between physical activity\nand various diseases, such as coronary heart disease, diabe-\ntes, and breast and colon cancers (38), may partly be due to\nincreased vitamin D levels arising from outdoor physical\nactivity, since epidemiologic evidence suggests that low vi-\ntamin D status increases the risk of these diseases after con-\nThis study has a few limitations. Its cross-sectional design\nprecludes determination of cause and effect. Moreover,\nmeasurement error is likely to be present, particularly with\nregard to physical activity measures. For example, the place\nof physical activity (outdoor or indoor) was not recorded\nduring the interview and had to be inferred from the type\nof activity. Information was collected only on the frequency\nof physical activity and not on the time participating in\nactivity or the time of day when it was carried out. Both\nof the latter are likely to have influenced serum 25-hydroxy-\nvitamin D levels. Further, the determination of vitamin D\nstatus from a single measure of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D\nalso is likely to have contributed to measurement error. If\nthis measurement error was random, it may have weakened\nthe observed association between outdoor physical activity\nand vitamin D, in which case, the true effect of outdoor\nphysical activity on vitamin D status maybe stronger than\nwhat is reported in this paper.\nIn summary, nationally representative data demonstrate\na strong association between the frequency of outdoor phys-\nical activity and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the\nUS population. Daily outdoor activities may be able to re-\ndress the differences in vitamin D status associated with age\nand sex, but not those associated with race/ethnicity. Public\nhealth strategies that support daily outdoor activities that are\nsafe (e.g., by avoiding sun burn) probably will increase the\nvitamin D status of the general population. However, addi-\ntional strategies, such as higher-dosed vitamin D supple-\nments, are required for African Americans in order to\nachieve optimal vitamin D levels.\n"
