In the past three decades, obesity\nhas tripled among adolescents [4] and more than doubled\namong 20\u00ad39 year olds in the U.S. [5]. A substantial\namount of weight gain [6-9], concomitant with precipi-\ntous declines in physical activity [10-13], occurs in the\ntransition from adolescence to young adulthood.\nPhysical activity and sedentary behavior have become\nmajor focal areas in obesity research, interventions, and\nThis article is available from: http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/4/1/26\n\u00a9 2007 Boone et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nInternational Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2007, 4:26 http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/4/1/26\n(page number not for citation purposes)\npolicies. Both have been linked to obesity among adoles-\nand assessed as target behaviors in randomized controlled\ntrials among young children and adolescents [21-25], but\nfull understanding of optimal behavior patterns for obes-\nity prevention is far from complete. Sedentary behaviors,\nsuch as television viewing and computer games, may\ninfluence energy balance through displacement of physi-\nreduced metabolic rate [29]. Sedentary behaviors are gen-\nerally more strongly and consistently associated with\nobesity than physical activity [16], and are thus com-\nmonly targeted by interventionists working with young\npopulations.\nPhysical activity and sedentary behavior often co-occur\nthere are few studies that examine their combined effects\non obesity development over time. Furthermore, longitu-\ndinal effects from adolescence to adulthood are particu-\nlarly important due to high risk of obesity onset and the\nabundance of changes in lifestyle and environment dur-\ning this transition period [33,34]. Unfortunately, longitu-\ndinal studies examining physical activity and sedentary\nactivity in relation to obesity are sparse: the only American\nobservational cohort that captures the adolescent to adult-\nhood transition is limited to females in three cities [17];\ninternational studies that capture this lifecycle phase\nassess sedentary activity [15,35] or physical activity\n[36,37], but not both; and randomized controlled trials\nare usually of short duration (less than one year) [21-\nIn this study, we assess the combined association of mod-\nerate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and TV/video\nviewing (screen time) on incident obesity in a large\nnationally representative survey of adolescents followed\nthrough young adulthood. We hypothesized that cross-\nsectional and longitudinal patterns of physical activity\nwould mitigate the adverse association between sedentary\nbehavior and both current and incident obesity.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nThe study population includes more than 20,000 individ-\nuals enrolled in The National Longitudinal Study of Ado-\nlescent Health (Add Health), a prospective cohort study of\nadolescents, representative of the U.S. school-based pop-\nadulthood. Add Health included a core sample plus sub-\nsamples of selected minority and other groupings col-\nlected under protocols approved by the Institutional\nReview Board at the University of North Carolina at\nChapel Hill. The survey design and sampling frame have\nbeen discussed elsewhere [39]. Add Health includes three\nwaves: Wave I (1995) did not collect measured height and\nweight, so we used Wave II (13,570 eligible adolescents,\ngible young adults, measured August 2001 and April\nble longitudinal respondents). Wave II followed the\nschool-based sample of adolescents who did not graduate\nprior to 1996; high school dropouts and older high school\nstudents were included. Eligible respondents included\nthose with sample weights. Females reporting pregnancy\nfor Wave II or Wave III (n = 378) and individuals who\nused a walking aid (e.g., cane, crutches, or wheelchair) (n\nII, or less than 19 or greater than 26 years of age at Wave\nIII (n = 115); or had incomplete physical activity, seden-\ntary behavior, height, weight, or relevant demographic\ndata (n = 1,231) were excluded from analysis. Less than\n7% of Wave II respondents were between 18 and 20 years\n\u00ad these were typically older adolescents who were still\nenrolled in school; despite being older than adolescent\nchronological age, they were retained in the Wave II sam-\nple: (a) to maintain consistency with the sampling design\nfor national representation and (b) based on their lifecy-\ncle stage \"of school-age\" in terms of social influences and\nlife stage. Our final sample includes 9,155 adolescents,\ndescriptive and logistic regression analysis.\nStudy Variables\nWave II and III in-home surveys of study participants pro-\nvided physical activity, sedentary behavior, and body\nmass index [BMI: weight (kg)/height (m2)] data. Wave I\nin-home surveys of parents provided income and educa-\ntion data. Education was the highest level of education\nattained by either parent. Where missing (n = 1,502;\n13.9%), income was imputed using a method similar to\nthat used in other national surveys to deal with missing\ndata [40,41]. Race and ethnicity were determined prima-\nrily from adolescent self-report; parent interviews were\nused as a secondary source.\nObesity\nBody Mass Index (BMI) was computed from measured\nheight and weight at Waves II and III. Adolescent respond-\nents were classified as obese at Wave II using International\nObesity Task Force (IOTF) BMI  30 kg/m2-equivalent\nage- and sex-specific BMI cut-points [42]. The IOTF cut-\npoints provide comparability to otherwise discrepant\nobesity definitions for adolescents and adults [6,42],\nwhich is vital for longitudinal analysis spanning the ado-\nlescent and adult years. At Wave III, when respondents\nwere 19 years and older, the adult obesity cut point (BMI\ndefined as BMI  30 kg/m2 among Wave III respondents\nInternational Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2007, 4:26 http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/4/1/26\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nwho were not obese (BMI below the age- and sex-specific\nIOTF obesity cutpoint) at Wave II.\nPhysical Activity and Screen Time\nDescribed in detail elsewhere [45,46], Add Health surveys\nemployed a standard activity recall. While the recall has\nnot undergone validity or reliability testing, it was based\non self-report questionnaires that have been validated in\nother large-scale epidemiologic studies with regard to\nphysical activity [47]. However, validation of self-reported\nsedentary behavior is scant [48]. In this study, physical\nactivity was defined as weekly frequency of moderate to\nvigorous physical activity (MVPA; includes skating &\ncycling, exercise, and active sports), hereafter referred to as\n\"bouts\". Screen time was defined as hours of television\nand video viewing per week. The screen time distribution\nincluded a very long tail; thus, screen time greater than 80\n80 hours in order to stabilize regression estimates. Longi-\ntudinal measures were created as change variables, repre-\nsenting the change in MVPA bouts and truncated screen\ntime hours from Wave II to Wave III.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using Stata, version\n9.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) [49]. Descriptive\nanalyses used post-stratification sample weights for\nnational representation; adjusted Wald tests compared\nmeans and design-based F-tests compared distribution of\ncategorical variables between obese and non-obese sub-\ngroups. All analyses used multiple stages of cluster sam-\npling to adjust for survey design effects.\nAll analyses were stratified by sex due to known differ-\nences in physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns\nbetween males and females [12,34]. Logistic regression\nmodels were used to assess correlates of adolescent obes-\nity status (Wave II) and predictors of obesity incidence\nfrom adolescence to young adulthood (Wave II to Wave\nIII). Wave II obesity prevalence models included Wave II\nphysical activity and Wave II screen time. Wave III obesity\nincidence models excluded respondents obese at Wave II\nand assessed Wave II physical activity, Wave II screen\ntime, and physical activity & screen time change variables\n(Wave III-Wave II). All quadratic terms related to physical\nactivity or screen time and all potential interactions\nbetween Wave II physical activity and screen time and\nchange variables were assessed in each model; non-signif-\nicant (p  0.10) terms were excluded. Age, race/ethnicity\n(White, Black, Native American, Asian, Hispanic), house-\nhold income tertile, and highest parental education are\nestablished confounders in behavior-obesity relation-\nships, so they were included in all models. Due to less\nconsistent relationships involving season, smoking status,\nand geographic region, we tested these variables empiri-\ncally for confounding and included them in the model as\ncontrol variables if their inclusion resulted in at least a\n10% change in estimate of the odds ratio for obesity\nrelated to physical activity and/or screen time.\nTo illustrate the effects of shifts in continuous physical\nactivity and screen time variables on incident obesity,\nmodel estimates were used to (1) calculate odds ratios for\nincident obesity and (2) predict obesity incidence based\non assigned physical activity and sedentary behavior pro-\nfiles. Odds ratios compare selected physical activity and\nscreen time levels to an \"undesirable\" referent profile of\nlow physical activity (1 bout per week) and high screen\ntime (40 hours per week). These values correspond to the\n10th and 90th percentiles, respectively, at Wave II for the\ntotal sample; there was no reason to suspect differential\nreporting or differential associations with obesity by sex,\nso combined values for males and females were used to\nprovide consistent comparisons.\nGiven the complexity of our models, involving quadratic\nterms and change variables, we used coefficients from the\nmodels along with experimentally assigned physical activ-\nity and screen time values to predict obesity incidence. We\n(a) fit logistic models of obesity incidence from adoles-\ncence to young adulthood (Wave II to Wave III) including\nWave II physical activity, Wave II screen time, and physi-\ncal activity and screen time change variables (Wave III-\nWave II), (b) assigned specified physical activity-screen\ntime combinations to all members of the cohort, then (c)\napplied model coefficients from (a) to the experimentally\nassigned physical activity and screen time values. These\nresults provide predicted obesity incidence at specified\nphysical activity and screen time levels, providing the\nopportunity for \"natural\" experiments involving simu-\nlated manipulations of the activity and screen time pro-\nfiles and, as such, aiding in the interpretation of model\nresults.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nria.

Among females, obes-\nity prevalence also varied by race at both waves and region\nat Wave III (Table 1). Non-obese females were slightly\nyounger than obese females at both waves (Table 2).\nDescriptive statistics for physical activity and screen time\nby sex, wave of survey, and obesity status are presented in\nTable 2.

Neither physical activity during adolescence nor\nchange in physical activity significantly predicted incident\nobesity in males. Similar to the cross-sectional analysis,\nthere was a slight curvilinear relationship for physical\nactivity among females.\nRelative odds of incident obesity from adolescence to young\nadulthood\nBased on coefficients from the model displayed in Table\n4, Table 5 presents odds ratios for Wave III incident obes-\nof Wave II physical activity & screen time for males and\nfemales, respectively (referent profile: 1 bout of physical\nactivity and 40 hours screen time; all other variables were\nheld constant). Consistent with the model estimates, rela-\ntive odds of incident obesity become more protective with\nlower adolescent screen time regardless of physical activ-\nity. This association was more dramatic in females than in\nmales: for example, very low screen time (4 hours per\nweek) reduced relative odds of incident obesity by over\nmales (OR4 hours, 1 bouts\n= 0.78) with very low physical activ-\nity (1 bout MVPA per week). These patterns were similar\nwith negative, constant, and positive temporal shifts in\nscreen time. Furthermore, this pattern is nearly identical at\neach level of physical activity, despite statistical signifi-\ncance in the logistic regression model for females.\nAdjusted obesity incidence from adolescence to young adulthood\nAlso based on model coefficients displayed in Table 4, Fig-\nure 1 shows predicted obesity incidence at experimentally\nassigned combinations of physical activity and screen\ntime profiles (25th and 75th percentiles of MVPA and\nscreen time). Change in MVPA from Wave II to III was\nheld constant due to lack of statistical significance as\nshown in Table 4, and change in screen time was not dis-\nplayed because patterns were similar across the relatively\nnarrow range of observed values.\nTable 3: Cross-sectional physical activity and screen time as predictors of obesity status of participants (Wave II)a\na National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.

Fewer weekly hours of screen time\nduring adolescence reduced the relative odds of incident\nobesity by over 40% among females and over 20% among\nmales. Contrary to our hypothesis, longitudinal patterns\nof physical activity were less important predictors of inci-\ndent obesity. Our results suggest that physical activity, if\nnot maintained, may not be protective in the long-term\nand may not counteract the negative effects of screen time\nduring adolescence and over time. Declines in screen time\nduring the transition from adolescence to young adult-\nhood were associated with lower obesity incidence, partic-\nularly for females, but not enough to overcome the\nobesity-promoting effects of screen time during adoles-\ncence. Our longitudinal results, including stronger results\nfor females [35], are consistent with other studies summa-\nrized in a recent literature review [16] and in other recent\nstudies showing a positive relationship between sedentary\nrelationship between physical activity and obesity\n[36,37], although existing literature is inconsistent.\nIn contrast, our cross sectional analysis suggests a strong\nprotective association between physical activity and prev-\nalent obesity for adolescent males, while both physical\nactivity and screen time were important factors for adoles-\ncent females. This protective cross-sectional association\nbetween physical activity and obesity is not observed lon-\ngitudinally, perhaps because such associations are dimin-\nished by other important lifestyle changes occurring\nduring this lifecycle period [51]. Gordon-Larsen et al.\nshowed a positive relationship between physical activity\nand incident obesity among adolescents between Waves I\nand II of Add Health [52], which is consistent with this\nexplanation because it studied a one year follow-up\nperiod in contrast with the five year period assessed in the\ncurrent study. Additionally, as noted in the Must and\nTybor review [16], cross-sectional associations may reflect\ncausal effects of physical activity patterns on obesity, but\nthey could also reflect limited capacity to engage in exer-\ncise or sports due to extreme obesity, lack of social support\nfor overweight or obese adolescents, or weight loss efforts.\nIn females, the likelihood of obesity peaked at two to\nthree MVPA bouts per week, perhaps reflecting reverse\ncausality as described above or inaccurate reporting of\nMVPA. Those engaging in two or three bouts of MVPA\nmay have been more likely to exercise for weight loss or\nmaintenance and hence at greater risk of obesity. Alterna-\ntively, reporting two or three bouts may reflect over-\nreporting to a greater extent than those with high MVPA\nfrequency; that is, due to social desirability, those with no\nMVPA may over-report within a reasonable range, result-\ning in high obesity prevalence and incidence in this MVPA\nrange.\nFor females, reduced screen time was associated with a\ngreater relative reduction of a larger absolute obesity inci-\ndence than for males (13% for males versus 16% for\nfemales), resulting in a greater potential impact of screen\ntime on obesity incidence. Assuming no change in screen\ntime, experimentally assigning low versus high screen\ntime led to predicted obesity incidence of approximately\nage point difference) for males. These results underscore\nthe potential public health impact of reducing screen time\nduring adolescence on controlling obesity incidence in\nfemales in particular.\nThe association between screen time and incident obesity\nmay differ by sex due to biologic differences in changes in\nenergy expenditure in response to screen time, in the\neffects of other lifestyle factors, misclassification biases by\nsex, or, more likely, a combination of all three. Biologic\ndifferences such as differential reductions in metabolic\nrate while engaging in sedentary activity are not evident in\nclinical research, but these studies are often limited to\nyoung children or include only one sex [29,53]. Other\nlifestyle factors such as changes in energy intake related to\ntelevision viewing [27,28] or concurrent activities while\nwatching television or videos could also differ between\nPredicted obesity incidence (%) based on obesity incidence\nmodels (Wave II to III)a\nPredicted obesity incidence (%) based on obesity inci-\ndence models (Wave II to III)a. a National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health.

Similarly, as hypothesized by Dunstan\net al. [54], screen time may be an indicator of sedentary\nbehaviors in general, including activities such as computer\nuse or reading, to a greater extent in females than males.\nUnfortunately, we are not able to quantify energy intake\nor overall energy expenditure in Add Health, so we were\nunable to investigate this issue. Recent studies in adult\npopulations have demonstrated stronger associations\nbetween television viewing and metabolic risk factors in\nwomen than men [54-56], suggesting that this difference\nis not spurious and reflects important sex differences in\nthe influence of screen time on obesity and obesity-related\nconditions. In addition, findings point to questions\nregarding assessment of screen time.\nRegardless of the mechanism or whether it is a direct rela-\ntionship \u00ad increased \"junk food\" consumption in\nresponse to advertisements, deflated metabolic rate, or\nsome other factor \u00ad these results suggest that adolescent\nfemales who watch less television and videos during ado-\nlescence and/or reduce their viewing time from adoles-\ncence to young adulthood are less likely to develop\nobesity as they become young adults, regardless of their\nphysical activity level. Thus, reducing screen time during\nadolescence is likely an essential component of obesity\nprevention, particularly for females. Furthermore, the\nlevel of screen time at which obesity odds were reduced in\nthis study are consistent with the American Academy of\nPediatrics recommendation [57] of 14 or fewer hours of\ntelevision viewing per week in pediatric populations.\nThere are some limitations of the current study. As noted\nabove, we could not assess energy intake, and activity data\nare subject to self-report bias. Misclassification is probably\nmost dramatic among obese respondents reporting more\nsocially desirable behavior, which would have attenuated\nthe association between screen time and physical activity\nwith obesity. For the same reason, those becoming obese\nbetween Waves II and III may have underreported screen\ntime and/or over-reported physical activity to a greater\nextent at Wave III; this differential misclassification would\nhave also attenuated the observed association between\nchanges in these behaviors and Wave III incident obesity.\nSecond, the activity recall may not have captured all\nMVPA performed by respondents, and the \"bouts\" of\nactivity classification is imprecise because each bout could\nbe of any duration. Both of these factors would be\nexpected to reduce precision and further dilute the appar-\nent influence of physical activity. Furthermore, MVPA\nbouts may more accurately reflect physical activity level\nduring adolescence, when more easily recalled organized\nsports practices and competitions are more common; this\nbias could potentially explain the lack of association\nbetween physical activity in young adulthood as well as\nstronger association with screen time, which may be more\naccurately reported, than physical activity. Finally,\nunmeasured factors related to both screen time and obes-\nity such as an awareness of healthful behaviors could have\ncontributed to these findings.\nConclusion\nPhysical activity and sedentary behavior are common tar-\ngets for obesity prevention and treatment, and this study\nassesses the extent to which they predict obesity during a\ncritical period in which risk for obesity onset is high and\nadult lifestyle takes shape. Our findings support public\nhealth strategies for reducing obesity incidence in this\nperiod that focus on reducing screen time during adoles-\ncence and maintaining these screen time reductions into\nyoung adulthood. Our research further suggests that phys-\nical activity during adolescence remains important for the\nestablishment of lifelong habits as well as short-term\nweight maintenance, but that physical activity levels\nwould need to be increased substantially and sustained\ninto adulthood in order to counteract the negative effects\nof screen time. Findings were complex for males and sug-\ngest that identification of possible intervention points for\nmales is an important next step. Further investigation of\nthe mechanism through which screen time might influ-\nence development of obesity will help to guide potential\nintervention strategies. Finally, additional randomized tri-\nals that assess the combined effects of sedentary behavior\nand physical activity on obesity over a long follow-up\nperiod that captures the transition from adolescence to\nadulthood might help to confirm or refute the causal\nnature of these relationships.\nCompeting interests\nThere were no potential or real conflicts of financial or\npersonal interest with the financial sponsors of the scien-\ntific project.\nAuthors' contributions\nJB, PG-L, LSA, and BMP contributed to the study design,\nJB and PG-L contributed to the data analysis.
