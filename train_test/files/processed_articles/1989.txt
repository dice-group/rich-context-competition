Inflammation, indicated by high-\nsensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), is a key factor linking MetS to cardiovascular disease and\ntype 2 diabetes. Our goal was to determine whether elevations of hsCRP vary by race/ethnicity\namong adolescents with MetS.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--We used the National Health and Nutrition\nadolescent adaptation of the ATP III definition of MetS. We used linear regression to evaluate the\ninteraction between MetS status and ethnicity with respect to hsCRP concentration.\nRESULTS--For male and female adolescents, MetS was associated with elevated hsCRP levels\ncompared with adolescents without MetS. However, the elevation in hsCRP between adolescents\nwith and without MetS was greater in non\u00adHispanic blacks compared with that in non\u00adHispanic\nwhites (P = 0.04) but not that in Hispanics (P = 0.18). hsCRP concentrations correlated with\nindividual MetS components similarly among all ethnicities. In an evaluation of adolescents\ndiagnosed with MetS, non\u00adHispanic blacks had higher BMI and more hypertension than other\nethnicities but there were no other racial/ethnic differences in the features of MetS.\nCONCLUSIONS--Non\u00adHispanic black adolescents have a greater differential in hsCRP be-\ntween those with and those without MetS than the differential in non\u00adHispanic whites but not\nthat in Hispanics. Therefore, even though MetS has a low prevalence in non\u00adHispanic blacks,\nMetS is a particularly good indicator of inflammation in non\u00adHispanic black adolescents.\nThe metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a\nclustering of cardiovascular risk fac-\ntors that are related to insulin re-\nsistance, specifically, elevated waist\ncircumference, hypertriglyceridemia,\nlow HDL-cholesterol, hypertension, and\nfasting hyperglycemia (1). MetS is related\nto inflammation (2) and functions as an\nindependent predictor of long-term risk\nfor cardiovascular disease and type 2 di-\nabetes among both adults (3) and chil-\ndren (4). Whereas the relationships\nbetween MetS, inflammation, and long-\nterm risks are well described in the gen-\neral population, these relationships have\nnot been delineated in non\u00adHispanic\nblack individuals. Non\u00adHispanic blacks\nare less likely than non\u00adHispanic whites\nand Hispanics to be classified as having\nMetS, largely based on a lower prevalence\nof dyslipidemia (5\u00ad7). Nevertheless,\nnon\u00adHispanic blacks are more likely\nthan non\u00adHispanic whites to exhibit insu-\nlin resistance (8,9) and to develop cardio-\nvascular disease and type 2 diabetes\naccuracy of current criteria for classifying\nMetS among non\u00adHispanic blacks (6).\nSimilarly, the relationship of MetS with\nincreased inflammation among non\u00ad\nHispanic blacks is unclear.\nHigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein\n(hsCRP) is a marker of inflammation that\nin adults is an independent risk factor for\ncardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes\n(12,13). Among children and adolescents,\nelevated hsCRP levels are predictive of\nand are independently associated with ar-\nterial changes that precede cardiovascular\ndisease, including carotid artery intima-\nmedia thickness (15).\nOur goal was to determine whether\nelevations in hsCRP values among ado-\nlescents with MetS vary by race/ethnicity.\nWe used the National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES)\nadaptation of the Adult Treatment Panel\nIII (ATP III) definition of MetS (1) to ex-\nplore the relationship between MetS and\nhsCRP on a race/ethnicity-specific basis.\nMETHODS--Data were obtained from\ntistage probability sample of the U.S.\npopulation.

Geometric means of hsCRP from the\nfinal model were estimated and compared\namong race/ethnicity, as applicable.\nFollowing the comparison of geo-\nmetric means of hsCRP, racial/ethnic dif-\nferences in the relationship between\nhsCRP and MetS were further evaluated.\nThis was performed by calculating Pear-\nson r correlation coefficients to determine\nthe degree of linear association between\nMetS components and ln(hsCRP) by\nrace/ethnicity. Finally, means and preva-\nlence of MetS components were compared\nby race/ethnicity among adolescents with\nMetS. With the exception of the correla-\ntion estimates, all analyses incorporated\nthe sampling weights included from\nNHANES.

Household\neducation level and smoking were signif-\nicantly associated with levels of hsCRP, as\ninteractions were significant and thus\nremained in the model: sex 3 ethnicity\nhigher hsCRP values than male partici-\npants (13), with the greatest difference be-\ntween sexes observed amongnon\u00adHispanic\nblacks. MetS had a significant effect on\nhsCRP for all examined ethnicities, with\nhsCRP levels increasing the most for\nnon\u00adHispanic blacks with MetS.\nGeometric means of hsCRP levels by\nsex and ethnicity (generated from the\nlinear model of ln(hsCRP)) are shown in\nFig. 1A\u00adB. In both male and female par-\nticipants, each ethnicity exhibited higher\nhsCRP values among adolescents with\nMetS compared with those in adolescents\nwithout MetS (P , 0.01 for all three eth-\nnicities). Among adolescent male partici-\npants without MetS, Hispanics had higher\nlevels of hsCRP than non\u00adHispanic blacks\n(P = 0.10). For adolescent female par-\nticipants without MetS, Hispanics had\nhigher levels of hsCRP than non\u00adHispanic\nwhites (P , 0.01), whereas hsCRP levels in\nnon\u00adHispanic blacks were not significantly\ndifferent than those in non\u00adHispanic\nwhites (P = 0.05). Amongmale participants\nwith MetS, there were nonsignificant\ntrends toward higher hsCRP levels in\nnon\u00adHispanic blacks (P = 0.07) and His-\npanics (P = 0.08) than in non\u00adHispanic\nwhites. Among adolescent female partici-\npants with MetS, both non\u00adHispanic\nblacks and Hispanics had higher levels\nof hsCRP than those found in non\u00ad\nHispanic whites (P , 0.01 and P =\n0.02, respectively). The difference in\nhsCRP (as expressed by the ratio of geo-\nmetric means of hsCRP) between adoles-\ncents with MetS and those without was\ngreater in non\u00adHispanic blacks than in\nnon\u00adHispanic whites (P = 0.04) but not\nTable 2--Linear model results of ln(hsCRP)*\nModel covariate Estimate 95% CI P\nEducation\nRace/ethnicity\nFemale\u00a7\nMetS\u00b6\n*Final model included sex 3 ethnicity interaction (P = 0.0494) and MetS 3 ethnicity interaction (P =\nvalues indicate difference from \"more than high school\" category.

Therefore, to evaluate qualitative re-\nlationships between hsCRP and MetS\namong each race/ethnicity and sex, we as-\nsessed correlations of ln(hsCRP) with BMI\nand individual MetS components (Table\n3). With the exception of diastolic blood\npressure and fasting glucose, hsCRP was\nsignificantly correlated with each of the\ncomponents of MetS in each of the sex/\nethnicity groups, with strengths of asso-\nciation that were similar between non\u00ad\nHispanic blacks and the other ethnicities.\nComparison of individual MetS\ncomponents among adolescents\nwith MetS\nAnother potential explanation for a\ngreater differential in hsCRP levels among\nnon\u00adHispanic black adolescents is that\nnon\u00adHispanic blacks may not be classi-\nfied as having MetS until they have a\nmore developed condition. To investigate\nthis, we determined mean values for MetS\ncomponents among individuals with MetS,\nalong with the proportion above/below the\nMetS-defining cutoffs of these components\n(available in the Supplementary Materials).\nNon\u00adHispanic black adolescents with\nMetS had a higher BMI but not waist cir-\ncumference than either other group. Non\u00ad\nHispanic blacks with MetS had a higher\nmean systolic blood pressure than did His-\npanics, and there was a higher prevalence\nof hypertension among non\u00adHispanic\nblacks with MetS than among either other\ngroup. There were no other significant dif-\nferences in MetS components between\ngroups.\nCONCLUSIONS--We report for the\nfirst time that non\u00adHispanic-black ado-\nlescents with MetS have higher levels of\nhsCRP than non\u00adHispanic whites but not\nHispanics and have a greater differential\nin hsCRP between individuals with MetS\nand those without MetS. These data may\nindicate that non\u00adHispanic black adoles-\ncents with MetS have a more advanced\ninflammatory condition than non\u00adHispanic\nwhites. Therefore, even though MetS has\na paradoxically low prevalence in non\u00ad\nHispanic blacks, MetS may be a particu-\nlarly good indicator of inflammation in\nnon\u00adHispanic black adolescents.\nAlthough the value of MetS has\nbeen challenged as an entity that is more\nmeaningful than the sum of its parts (23),\nthe associations between the individual\ncomponents of MetS are powerful, as is\nthe strong relationship between MetS\nand systemic inflammation (2). Indeed,\ninflammation is frequently cited as a key\netiologic factor in the development of the\nindividual components that comprise\nIn our analysis of NHANES data, we\nconsidered several explanations that\ncould contribute to the higher elevation\nin hsCRP in non\u00adHispanic black adoles-\ncents with MetS than in non\u00adHispanic\nwhites. First, there may be environmental\ncharacteristics--such as socioeconomic\nor educational differences (19)--that\ncould impact hsCRP levels differently by\nrace/ethnicity. To address these possibili-\nties, we included adjustment for house-\nhold income, education, and smoking\nstatus in our linear model (Table 2). Al-\nthough education and smoking were\nclearly linked to hsCRP levels, adjusting\nfor differences in these covariates did not\neliminate the significant effect among\nnon\u00adHispanic blacks. Nevertheless, the\npossibility of residual confounding can-\nnot be discounted because other factors\nrelated to hsCRP and ethnicity could in\ntheory account for our findings.\nA second possibility is that an elevated\ndegree of inflammation may represent a\nunique feature of the processes underlying\nMetS among non\u00adHispanic blacks--e.g.,\nthat non\u00adHispanic blacks exhibit an exag-\ngerated production of inflammatory mark-\ners from adipose tissue or elsewhere. This\ntheory is plausible because there are many\ncharacteristics of obesity and MetS that\nmanifest differently in non\u00adHispanic\nblacks than in non\u00adHispanic whites and\nHispanics. The most striking of these eth-\nnic differences relates to lower rates of dys-\nlipidemia among non\u00adHispanic blacks\n(5,6). Additionally, compared with non\u00ad\nHispanic whites, non\u00adHispanic blacks\nhave greater insulin resistance at similar\nlevels of adiposity (8,9) and less visceral\nadiposity even after adjustment for total\nfat and waist circumference (8,24). Non\u00ad\nHispanic blacks also have more subcutane-\nous fat than non\u00adHispanic whites and\nmore lean body mass per unit of body\nFigure 1--Comparison of hsCRP concentrations by ethnicity.

C: Ratio of adjusted\ngeometic means (95% CIs) of hsCRP values (MetS+/MetS2) by ethnicity. Male and female subjects\nwere combined because of a lack of an interaction between MetS, ethnicity, and sex (i.e., the ratio\nof MetS+ to MetS2 by ethnicity was constant for male and female subjects). For A\u00adC, comparisons\nbetween ethnic groups by corresponding MetS status are as follows: *P , 0.05 and **P , 0.01 vs.\nnon\u00adHispanic whites; #P , 0.05 vs. Hispanics.\nDeBoer, Gurka, and Sumner\nweight (24). Also, compared with both\nnon\u00adHispanic white and Hispanic adoles-\ncents, non\u00adHispanic blacks are less\nlikely to exhibit elevated fasting blood\nglucose values (6) despite their higher\nincidence of type 2 diabetes (10). There-\nfore, the exaggerated levels of hsCRP\namong adolescents with MetS may rep-\nresent an additional unique feature of\nMetS in non\u00adHispanic blacks.\nConsequently, we analyzed linear re-\nlationships between hsCRP and each of\nthe individual components of MetS. In all\nthree racial/ethnic groups, hsCRP corre-\nlated similarly with each of the compo-\nnents of MetS (Table 3), suggesting that\nthere are not qualitative differences in the\nrelationship between hsCRP and MetS\namong non\u00adHispanic blacks. However,\nthe potential remains for more subtle var-\niation in the relationship between hsCRP\nand the processes underlying MetS.\nFinally, we investigated whether the\nhigher elevation in hsCRP among non\u00ad\nHispanic blacks with MetS is due to the\nunderclassification of MetS among non\u00ad\nHispanic black adolescents. It has been\nwell documented that non\u00adHispanic\nblacks are classified as having MetS at far\nlower rates than are seen among non\u00ad\nHispanic whites and Hispanics (5,6).\nThese low rates of MetS classification are\nat odds with the greater degree of insulin\nresistance (8,9) and high rates of type 2\ndiabetes and cardiovascular disease in\nmost likely etiologies of the underclassifi-\ncation of MetS is the relative absence of the\ndyslipidemia of insulin resistance in non\u00ad\nHispanic blacks (7). Non\u00adHispanic blacks\nhave higher levels of HDL-cholesterol (a\nprotective cardiovascular disease factor)\nduring adolescence and lower levels of tri-\nglycerides (a proatherogenic factor)\nthroughout the life span (5,6). Interest-\ningly, non\u00adHispanic blacks appear to\nhave lower baseline levels of triglycerides;\nthough these triglyceride levels increase\nwith worsening insulin resistance, they\nare less likely to exceed currently used cut-\noff values that are heavily influenced by the\nnormal range of triglycerides among non\u00ad\nHispanic whites (7). It is possible that by\nthe time a non\u00adHispanic black individual\nexhibits triglyceride or HDL-cholesterol\nabnormalities that exceed current limits\nfor MetS classification, he or she may al-\nready have a more advanced condition of\nMetS that includeshigherhsCRPlevelsthan\nthose observed in non\u00adHispanic whites.\nTo assess for this possibility, we\nevaluated mean values of the individual\nTable 3--Correlations* between MetS components and hsCRP\nBMI Waist circumference Systolic blood pressure Diastolic blood pressure Triglycerides* HDL-cholesterol Fasting glucose\nOverall\nMale\nFemale\nData are Pearson r (95% CI). *Correlation estimates and corresponding 95% CIs did not incorporate sampling weights provided in NHANES; significant correlations (P , 0.05) in bold. Natural log of variable was\nused to achieve normality.\nMetS and hsCRP in non\u00adHispanic black adolescents\nMetS components among adolescents\nclassified as having MetS. In addition to\nhaving more hypertension, non\u00adHispanic\nblack adolescents with MetS have a higher\nBMI than the other groups. However, no\nother racial/ethnic differences in MetS\ncomponents were detected. Hypertension\nwas not as significantly associated with\nhsCRP levels (Table 3), leaving ethnic\ndifferences in BMI as a potential explana-\ntion for the elevated hsCRP levels in non\u00ad\nHispanic blacks with MetS. In many\nways, this is not surprising. BMI (and\nwaist circumference) carried by far the\nstrongest association with hsCRP in this\nstudy (Table 3) and elsewhere (13), and\nthese relationships have been demon-\nstrated to be similarly strong among\nnon\u00adHispanic blacks and among non\u00ad\nHispanic whites and Hispanics (25).\nThe relationship between BMI and\nhsCRP may relate to fat tissue mass (25).\nInterestingly, for a given BMI and waist\ncircumference, non\u00adHispanic blacks\nhave less overall fat mass and more lean\nmass than non\u00adHispanic whites (24). As a\nresult of data limitations within NHANES\nthe higher BMI among non\u00adHispanic\nblack adolescents with MetS is due to\nhigher fat mass, higher lean mass, or both.\nNevertheless, racial/ethnic differences\nin lean mass amount to approximately\ndifference in BMI among non\u00adHispanic\nblacks with MetS compared with other\nracial/ethnic groups suggests an element\nof increased fat tissue as well (24). Addi-\ntionally, pubertal status is known to con-\ntribute to insulin resistance and, overall,\noccurs earlier in non\u00adHispanic blacks\nthan in other ethnicities. While pubertal\nstage of subjects is not reported in NHANES\ncents with MetS tended to be older than\nthe other ethnicities (Supplementary Ma-\nterials). Consequently, even though MetS\noccurs at a lower rate in non\u00adHispanic\nblack adults than in non\u00adHispanic whites\nor Hispanics, it cannot be ruled out that\npubertal differences play a role.\nNotably, non\u00adHispanic black adoles-\ncents with MetS did not have significantly\ndifferent levels of triglycerides or HDL-\ncholesterol compared with the other\nracial/ethnic groups (Supplementary Ma-\nterials). This suggests that whereas pop-\nulation differences in lipid levels are\nwide, non\u00adHispanic black adolescents\nwith MetS have levels of triglycerides\nand HDL similar to those of other racial/\nethnic groups. While this may represent a\nsubset of non\u00adHispanic black adoles-\ncents with a greater predisposition to-\nward dyslipidemia, these data also\nsupport the hypothesis that non\u00ad\nHispanic black adolescents with MetS\nhave a more advanced condition--\npotentially driven by a further degree\nof obesity, as represented by BMI differ-\nences. This imbalance in the classification\nof MetS has led the American Diabetes\nAssociation and others (6,23) to call for\nalternate sets of criteria for diagnosing\nMetS. These alternate approaches could\ninclude the use of race/ethnicity-specific\ncutoff values for MetS components or de-\nvelopment of continuous criteria that add\nup the degree of abnormality in each of the\nindividual components instead of requiring\na person to exceed cutoff values for a set\nnumber of components. Use of such criteria\ncould result in the earlier classification of\nMetS among at-risk adolescents.\nIn conclusion, the classification of\nMetS confers a greater differential in\nhsCRP levels among non\u00adHispanic black\nadolescents than among non\u00adHispanic\nwhites but not among Hispanics. Though\nthe exact nature of the relationships be-\ntween MetS, BMI, and hsCRP between\nethnicities remains unclear, these data\nsuggest a more advanced state of inflam-\nmation in the setting of MetS among\nnon\u00adHispanic black adolescents than\namong non\u00adHispanic whites, with one\npossible etiology being a relatively more\nsevere condition of MetS. Given racial/\nethnic differences in the classification\nof MetS using current criteria, there\nremains a great need for specific diagnos-\ntic tools to assess inflammation-related\nand MetS-related risk among adolescents\nof all racial/ethnic groups.\n"
