    "abstract": "Abstract: Sex differences in spatial cognition are well documented; males typically\noutperform females on tasks dealing with mental rotation and spatial navigation,\nwhile females tend to outperform males on tasks dealing with object location,\nrelational object location memory, or spatial working memory. Here we investigated\nboth behavioral and neural sex differences in sex-specific spatial abilities. In\nExperiment 1, sixty-six (30 males, 36 females) participants completed computerized\nmental rotation (MR) and spatial working memory (SWM) tasks. In Experiment 2,\ntwelve (6 males, 6 females) participants were given slightly modified versions of the\nsame tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In both\nexperiments, males outperformed females on the MR task, but no behavioral sex\ndifference was observed on the SWM task. Males showed more activation in left\nparahippocampal gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, inferior\nfrontal gyrus in the MR task . Females showed activation in the left parahippocampal\ngyrus only. For the study condition of the spatial working memory task, females\nshowed activation in left inferior frontal gyrus, while males activated left inferior\nparietal and medial frontal areas. In the test conditions, females showed activation in\nthe right inferior frontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and left parahippocampal\ngyrus. Males activated right medial frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobe.\nInterestingly, similar regions \u00ad parahippocampal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, and\nmiddle temporal gyrus \u00ad were found to be active when males solved mental rotation\ntasks and females solved spatial working memory tasks. Further, performance was\nmodulated by activation in the parahippocampal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus for\nmales and the middle temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus for females. These\ndata extend previous claims for sex differences in sex specific spatial cognitive\nCommon Ground for Spatial Cognition?\nabilities by demonstrating both behavioral and neural sex differences consistent with\nan evolutionary model, which suggests sexual selection may have favored sex-\ndifferences in such abilities and the neural substrates that sub-serve those processes.\n",
