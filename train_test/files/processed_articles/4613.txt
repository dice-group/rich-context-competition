I don't\nmake the joke just because I get laughs. Students don't laugh\nbecause the joke is especially humorous. They laugh, I sus-\npect, because what I say is apt; it accurately describes our\nshared embodied experience of confusion and overwhelm\nwhen faced with complex ideas and experiences. And\nbecause laughing at the joke gives us an unexpected chance\nto release built-up tension, it clears space so we can share a\nsmall moment of relaxation before we dive back into the\ncomplexity.\nThe setup for the joke happens something like this: A stu-\ndent (and I should state explicitly that the majority of my\nstudents are \"adult learners\" and predominately women;\nthey've returned to formal education in their full-on adult-\nhood, even their \"mature years,\" to complete an undergradu-\nate degree or begin a graduate degree) will be lamenting a\nparticularly difficult reading assignment (usually something\ntheoretically substantial) or discussion topic (usually some-\nthing theoretically substantial!), complaining about the\nimpenetrability of the ideas and how they'll never be able to\nget their minds around \"this stuff,\" describing vividly the\nexcruciating pain involved in stretching their minds and\nthinking deeply. I listen closely to their plaintive cries and\nwhile quite sympathetic, at some point I can't resist asking,\n\"Does your brain feel like it is going to explode?\" And my\nstudents always respond with \"Yes!\" and then they laugh, to\nwhich I reply with something along the lines of, \"Good!\nThat's exactly the experience I was hoping you'd have. If\nyour brain doesn't feel like it is going to explode once in the\nwhile then we aren't doing our jobs!\"\nSometime, the joke has been known to turn into a strange\ncompliment. It might happen this way: A student stays some-\nthing particularly insightful or innovative for him or her, and\nin response I exclaim, \"Everybody out of the way! What you\nsaid is so amazing my brain is about to explode!\"\nI never once imagined that my mother's brain--or mine,\nfor that matter--could explode for real.\n1Marylhurst University, OR, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJennifer Sasser, Ph.D., Chair, Department of Human Sciences, Director,\nEmail: jsasser@marylhurst.edu\nTransforming Trauma Through Reflection\nand Praxis: Embracing the Principles of\nCritical Educational Gerontology Life-\nWide\nJennifer R. Sasser1\n Keywords\nauto-ethnography, critical gerontology, educational gerontology, collaborative inquiry, reflective practice, learning in\nadulthood, community-based education\n2 SAGE Open\nPreamble: Commitments and Contexts\nMy central preoccupation in this essay is a significant, unex-\npected event from my \"non-academic\" life: An aneurysm\nruptured in my mother's brain. I explore my experience of\nthis event from the standpoint of being her adult daughter\nand primary family caregiver as well as a mother to my own\ndaughter and an educational gerontologist with a commit-\nment to the use of Critical Theory. I celebrate the primacy\nand legitimacy of individual and shared experience and the\ntransformative potential of solitary and communal critical\nreflection on experience. I offer an episodic narrative of my\nmother's and my experience as an example of age autobio-\ngraphical work (Gullette, 2003), a kind of critical\nGerontological \"case study\" of the ongoing, messy process\nof working through and transforming trauma into deeper\nalbeit partial and provisional understanding.\nFor more than two decades (longer than half my lifetime),\nmy intellectual commitments have been informed by the\nCritical Gerontology framework, an alternative approach to\nGerontological education, theory-work, research, and\npractice.\nResisting neat categorizations and extending provocative\nnotions from Deleuze and Guattari, Katz (2003) referred to\nCritical Gerontology as \"a pragmatic and nomadic thought-\nspace across which ideas flow and become exchanged . . . a\nmagnetic field where thought collects, converges, and tra-\nverses disciplines and traditions\" (p. 16). According to Ray\n(2008), within this critical Gerontological thought-space,\ntwo \"parallel lines\" have developed over the past 30 years:\nthe political economy approach which foregrounds the social\nstructures that construct and affect aging, old age, and later\nlife; and an approach informed by the humanities which fore-\ngrounds individual experiences and processes of meaning-\nmaking in adult aging. Although my cross-disciplinary\neducation and work as a gerontologist has been primarily in\nthe context of the human sciences disciplines, I have spent a\nlarge portion of my life involved in the arts, specifically\nmusic, dance, and theater. In this essay, I am self-consciously\nsituated in this disciplinary mash-up and while sensitive to\nsocial constructions of and structural constraints on experi-\nence, I am walking the critical Gerontological line that privi-\nleges exploration of and reflection on individual experiences\nas a source of knowledge about our travels through the life\ncourse.\nWhat holds critical gerontologists together as a commu-\nnity of scholars, teachers, and practitioners, whichever \"line\"\none is enacting, is a shared commitment to several strong\nprinciples: (a) the importance of acknowledging and bridg-\ning the biographical and the historical, the personal and\npolitical, and social structures and individual agency; (b) the\ncommitment to critically reflecting upon and thinking about\nself, society, and the field of gerontology itself; (c) the privi-\nleging of collaborative theorizing, not only with other schol-\nars and educators but also with students and especially with\nolder persons, the very subjects of--and potential partners\nin--inquiry; (d) the commitment to grappling intentionally\nwith--rather than attempting to simplify or reduce--the\ncomplexities of what it means to be a human being; and (e)\nthe imperative that the ultimate outcome of our striving must\nbe a deeper understanding of lifelong human development\nand aging in the service of personal, social, and cultural\nWhat I consider to be especially powerful about Critical\nGerontology is that it serves as a meta-framework, a compre-\nhensive sensibility within which to ask and pursue answers\nto questions about the most complex features of our travels\nthrough the life course as human beings because it recog-\nnizes that who we are and the work we do in the world are\nintertwined inexorably (Glendenning, 2000). And, most cru-\ncially, it provides a lucid counter-argument to the narrow and\nover-determining normative discourses and practices that\nstill dominate a great deal of the research and theory regard-\ning adult development and aging, later life and old age\nAs I mature into my professional (and personal) life, I\nhave been moved deeply by provocative contributions from\nhas inspired me to turn the lens of Critical Gerontology back\nupon myself, to ask probing questions, such as\nWhat have I been doing all these years and why? What\nmotivates--even compels--my research and theorizing? How\nhas my personal life shaped and been shaped by my work in\ngerontology (or age studies, as Margaret Gullette would have\nit)? How has my sense of the field, and myself in it, changed\nover time? What do I celebrate--and regret--about my scholarly\nlife and the progress of critical gerontology overall? What do I\nsee as the central issues for critical gerontologist in the future?\nI have been supported in my movement toward deeper\ncritical reflection and praxis especially by Biggs (2005) who,\nin his discussion of research training for a critical sensibility\ntoward aging experiences, asserted quite boldly that \"we\nneed, then, techniques by which to know ourselves and the\ncontexts in which we work\" (p. S125). He continued, advo-\ncating that\nidentifying multiple sources of empathic understanding such as\nsimilar life events and attending to biography, oral history, and\ntestimonia may be used to enhance a will to understand. The\nproblems of . . . amnesia of depth, indicative of seduction by\nsimple states of mind, plus their undertow, the avoidance of\npersonal anxieties with age, point to a need for enhanced self-\nreflection of this type. (p. S126)\nI remain convinced of the relevance and power of the\nCritical Gerontology ethos for my work-in-the-world, but\nsomething even more elemental has happened: I have\ndecided to take the principles of Critical Gerontology so seri-\nously as to try to live my daily life informed by them (not\nonly employ these principles in the context of my work as an\neducational gerontologist). As well, I have decided to take\nmy lived experiences from the \"rest of my life\" so seriously\nas to attempt to live my life as an educational gerontologist\nby them. And so as a point of departure for exploring the\nconnections between the ways I think, the work I do, and\nhow I've responded to--recovered from, learned from, and\nintegrated--the particular kinds of grown-up-hood complex-\nities I've experienced over the past many years, I chose to\ndwell for a time in the intense center of my experiences with\nmy mother. As well, consistent with the practices described\n(hopefully) out of the \"muddle\" (G. Bateson, 1972) created\nby this crisis to (hopefully) a place of deeper understanding.\nBut my resolve was not enough, I needed the help of others,\ntheir insights, mentoring, and compassion, to do so. Thus, I\nalso recommitted myself to a collaborative mode of work\nwhereby I invited anyone--colleagues, friends, family, stu-\ndents, elders, even strangers--who was interested and will-\ning to think with me about the larger meanings and\nimplications of these and other life experiences and to offer\ntheir own experiences for collaborative mulling-over as well.\nThis is a hybrid essay, a combination of mini-memoir and\nscholarly discourse; perhaps it even qualifies as a \"testi-\nmony,\" because through the process of putting to words my\nand my mother's experiences, I am \"bearing witness to a cri-\nsis or trauma\" (Felman, 1995), so as to deeply question how\nI might theoretically and pedagogically and personally make\nuse of these experiences, not only on behalf of my own and\nother's deep development and intentional aging but also as\nfecund material to enrich my teaching and praxis (Biggs,\nTestimonia: Trauma (and Glimmers of\nTransformation)\nTwo weeks after she celebrated her 60th birthday and one\nweek after returning from a cruise to Mexico with her younger\nsister, an undiagnosed aneurysm ruptured in my mother's\nbrain. She was driving from the library at the university where\nI work to my house to meet me and my daughter for dinner\nwhen her brain exploded. It was February 19, 2006, and I had\nrecently celebrated my 39th birthday, my daughter had cele-\nbrated her 10th birthday, and only recently, months before my\nmother's aneurysm, we'd felt as though we were emerging\nfrom a period in our lives that had been extraordinarily chal-\nlenging, even traumatic, for all three of us.\nIn my own life throughout the previous decade, I had\nexperienced many unanticipated events that demanded of me\nwhat felt like an almost constant process of adjustment and\nadaptation, periods of recovery and reflection followed by\nrebuilding of self and life-world. In the most recent months,\nthere had been my maternal grandmother's rapid decline and\nnear-death, followed by her equally rapid and unexpected\nimprovement. This grand woman, my only surviving grand-\nparent, had been my \"best person\" throughout my growing-\nup years, my unlimited source of unconditional positive\nregard, and my model for the reality-bending possibilities of\ncuriosity, intent, will, and hopefulness. Driving 12 hours\nthrough the middle of a frozen winter night, my mother and I\nrushed to her so that we might be there in time to care for her\nduring what we thought were her final days on earth. When I\narrived at her bedside, I had no doubt that she was dying. I\nclimbed into bed and slept with her all night. In the morning,\nmy grandmother woke up, toileted, and dressed herself,\nwhereas I woke up vomiting and continued to do so for 2\ndays. This was a singular, beautiful experience, an unex-\nplainable yet verifiable event. I was deeply shaken.\nAlso during the half-year prior to my mother's ruptured\ncerebral aneurysm, there had been the unexpected and vio-\nlent end of her second marriage and her first sustained expe-\nrience of living alone. She and her first husband, my father,\nmarried when they were both 18 years old, right before he\nheaded off to the Vietnam War; I was born 9 months later.\nThree years later, my brother was born with severe and irre-\nversible auditory and visual impairments caused by a con-\ngenital syndrome, the existence of which had been unknown\nto my family prior to my brother's birth. Growing up, I had\nplayed the steady, strong eldest child and helpmate to my\nmother, as she was completely dedicated to my brother who\nhad so many needs, while at the same time dominated by my\nfather who also had so many needs. My mother struggled\nwith her own depression and fear and great self-doubt; it was\nall she could do to cope with even the smallest of life's has-\nsles. Until my brother left home in his early twenties, my\nmother's daily reality--her identity, in fact--was organized\naround the considerable responsibility of parenting a child\nwith significant impairments.\nShe'd been married to my father for 25 years and had\ncared for my brother for 21 of those 25 years when, for the\nfirst time in her life, she chose herself; the day after my\nbrother's 21st birthday my mother ran away from home.\nQuite courageously, she walked away from life as she had\n(and we had) known it, as she felt her responsibility to keep\nour family together for my brother's sake was unnecessary\nnow that he was living on his own out in the world.\nAt the time, I was a 24-year-old married gerontology\ngraduate student. Like my mother, I'd married quite young,\nenthralled with the idea of \"true love,\" but also (I only real-\nized much later) because early marriage offered me an escape\nfrom my intolerable native family situation. My mother and\nI had been meeting for lunch a couple of times a month to\ncommiserate over our separate and shared woes. I'd known\nfor quite a while that something of significance was going on\nwith her as each time I saw her, she'd hand over to me\nanother small box of objects that were important to her, that\n4 SAGE Open\nshe expected me to protect for her. I even suggested to her on\nthe occasion of one of these deposits with me of her senti-\nmental objects that it seemed that she was \"preparing for\nflight.\" And so, when she phoned me and asked that I pick\nher up and help her \"run away from home\" I wasn't too sur-\nprised--I'd always wondered why she hadn't fled sooner--\nthough I was in shock because of what I could foresee as the\nconsequences of her actions. Indeed, the consequences were\nnumerous, significant, and lasting. My father felt betrayed by\nmy collusion with my mother and responded in extreme\nways; I felt caught in between my parents and unfairly relied\nupon by my mother; my brother felt that his and our family's\nentire life had been a lie.\nAfter a few months, in between staying temporarily with\nme or friends and for a very short while on her own, my\nmother met and married her second husband, to whom she\nwas married for 13 years until the day after Mother's Day\n2005 when she found herself truly on her own for the first\ntime in her entire life.\nIn the months that preceded the explosion in her brain, my\nmother had gone a long way toward establishing a life as a\nsingle, late \"middle-aged\" woman who'd already traveled\nthrough the life course for several decades, to fully embrac-\ning her \"third age\" or \"adulthood 2\" with vitality and pur-\n2002). I'd helped her to acquire an apartment in the neigh-\nborhood where my daughter and I are established; a friend\nand I had moved her into the new place and had kept her\nclear of her second husband. No longer focused on keeping a\nstruggling relationship together, she found that she had the\nenergy to think new thoughts and embrace new challenges.\nWith the approach of her 60th birthday, my mother had\ndecided it was the ideal time to pursue as many of her dreams\nas she could: going back to school, training for a walking\nmarathon, building economic security, and developing cur-\nrent and new friendships. Her decision to return to college--\nin fact, to the university where I am on the faculty-- to\ncomplete her undergraduate degree was to fulfill a lifelong\ndream that had been disrupted so many years previously, a\ndream that she shared with many of my students who are also\nwomen returning to college in their mid-lives. Even without\na college degree, my mother had worked hard for over two\ndecades as a medical assistant in a managed care setting, pro-\nviding a steady source of income in both of her marriages to\nmen who were chronically unemployed. Newly independent,\nshe described to me feeling an unfamiliar vitality, clarity, and\npurposefulness; she said that she'd never felt \"better or\nyounger\" in her life, that for once her \"insides and outsides\"\nmatched, she felt her life had a coherence that she could get\nused to and wanted to make last as long as possible.\nFrom my vantage point as her adult daughter, she seemed\nto me to be experiencing a fundamental shift in the substrates\nof her identity, her very way of being in the world was trans-\nforming. For what felt to me to be the first time in the almost\n40 years I had been her daughter, she was expressing her\nthoughts and feelings in a way that impressed me as repre-\nsenting some deeper truth that she'd carried around within\nher for decades but never felt up to narrating. And she not\nonly expressed herself in an increasingly open and innova-\ntive way, she also began--at least discursively--to assume\nresponsibility for her life choices in a way I was completely\nunaccustomed to and wanted to put my faith in with a des-\nperation that surprised and somewhat concerned me. I dis-\ncovered in myself a ferocious hope that her new habits of\nthinking and being in the world would \"stick.\" (And I must\nadmit here that I wanted this as much for my own sake and\nthe sake of my daughter as I did for my mother's sake.)\nMy mother was asking the kinds of questions that she'd\nnever allowed herself to ask before without being paralyzed\nby fear, as if to ask such existential questions about the uni-\nverse and her place in it would unleash uncontrollable and\ndestructive forces. I noticed that she was inventing wholly\nnew language to describe her current self, whom she aspired\nto become, not only whom she'd been in her \"past life.\"\nBefore my eyes, my mother, who for so many years had\nseemed resistant to engaging in self-reflexivity and assuming\nher own agency, was evidencing the possibility of the\n\"reversibility of discourses\" about her life and self (Powell\n& Biggs, 2003). For the first time in my life as her daughter,\nI experienced her as a growing-up person, by which I mean\nto say, she was exhibiting the sensibilities and characteristics\nI had come to associate--theoretically and in my own strug-\ngles with personhood--with grown-up-hood, an intentional\ncommitment to our own deep development and a purposeful\nand responsible life, no matter how complex and \"messy\"\nthat life might be (Gullette, 1997). My mother seemed better\nable to dwell with and negotiate the contradictions inherent\nin her identity as an aging woman despite having few models\nAll of this was jarring because of my unfamiliarity with\nsuch maternal agency from the standpoint of being my moth-\ner's daughter and it instigated for me yet another spiraling\nphase in my own developmental journey. The innovations\nmy mother seemed to be making in her self and her life-\nworld were a source of new hope for me about potentialities\nfor her life and our life together as growing-up mother and\ndaughter as well as for the role she might play in my daugh-\nter's life as a grandmother. It felt strange to me witnessing\nmy mother's increasing independence as a woman, not only\nas my mother. She was becoming . . . how to say it? Not so\nmuch a new person but a larger and more solid person in the\nworld, an expanded mother who took up more space, a fuller\nbeing.\nIntensive Caring\nIt had been an arduous process convincing the attending\nemergency room physician at the hospital where the ambu-\nlance initially took my mother that in fact she was experienc-\ning a cerebral emergency. I arrived at her bedside to discover\nhim accusing her of \"drug seeking behavior\" for what was\nprobably \"just a bad migraine.\" The minute I looked at my\nmother's face and heard her voice, I knew that she was expe-\nriencing something more significant than a migraine head-\nache. I insisted that the neurologist on call be brought in for\nconsultation immediately. In response to my plea, the ER\nphysician said, \"And you are?\" To which I responded, \"Her\ndaughter, Dr. Sasser_.\" He asked, \"What kind of doctor\"? I\nsaid, \"A gerontologist.\" To which he replied, \"So you aren't\nan MD. Well, I think we have this under control. We'll keep\nan eye on your mother.\" To which I responded with mostly\nincoherent wailing that fortunately resulted in the specialist\nbeing paged and appropriate diagnostic imagining ordered.\nThe neurologist told me later that had he not been called to\nthe scene when he had, my mother most likely would have\ndied or been impaired severely and irreversibly.\nPerhaps it is important to this story for you to know that\nthis hospital was part of the medical complex where my\nmother had been working as a medical assistant for two\ndecades and where she received her routine medical care; she\nknew almost everyone on staff in the ER, including the\nattending physician. As if our experience in the emergency\nroom wasn't upsetting and shocking enough, my mother was\ndischarged too soon after her post-operation hospitalization,\nresulting in a major set-back in her healing. As well, the\nmanaged care system of which the hospital was a part\nattempted to renege on their commitment to her as an\nemployee and client, threatening to deny her medical claims\nand discontinue her relationship with the neurology special-\nist to whom they had referred her for surgery. This stubborn\ninstitution gave us nothing but problems every step of the\nway as I attempted to navigate it as her caregiver, with vary-\ning degrees of success and a great deal of exasperation. I\nwonder, what fate might my mother have faced without me\nthere to advocate for her?\nOnce she was stabilized medically and waiting in the\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) prior to receiving the emergency\nprocedure to remove the blood that had pooled in her cranial\ncavities and seal off the aneurysm with a coil made of tita-\nnium, my mother's two preoccupations were, first, why this\nterrible thing had happened to her especially now that she\nhad, as she put it, \"gotten her act together,\" and second,\nwhether it would be possible for me to smuggle into the ICU\na hamburger and fries. During her stay in the hospital--first\nin the ICU, then in the regular medical ward, and then when\nshe was recuperating under my care--her personality seemed\ncharacterized by extremes. Elements of her best and worst\nself co-existed: She was funny one moment, even uncharac-\nteristically ironic, and the next moment, she was perseverat-\ning about something she couldn't remember or locate, such\nas a pair of red and black socks that she feared had been left\nat the hospital or the fact that her car was still parked at my\nhouse rather than at her apartment and that it needed its bat-\ntery recharged. Elements of my best and worst self battled:\nAt one moment, I was patient, empathetic, not easily ruffled,\ncompletely fierce in my devotion to her; in the next moment,\nI was barely able to suppress impatience, annoyance, fear\nthat my mother's current state would become her permanent\nway of being in the world, that I would become her long-\nterm guardian. All I could think about was the absurdity of\nworrying about lost socks when she was almost lost to the\nworld or changing the oil in her car when she had actually\ncrashed her car as she'd been driving when her brain\nexploded.\nI felt a strange kind of disappointment mixed with grief\nbecause, as I have described, only months before the crisis\nour relationship as growing-up daughter and mother began to\ntransform. We were reliant upon one another in new and bet-\nter ways; we occupied clearer and more \"appropriate\" roles\nthan ever before. I think we both thrived (as did my daugh-\nter) because of these hard-won innovations in our relation-\nship. And so I was jarred deeply by the incontrovertible fact\nthat this newfound stability, these new modes of being in the\nworld for my mother and for us, was being disrupted by an\nevent of such magnitude and consequence as a ruptured brain\naneurysm.\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that I was in crisis.\nThere was a collection of thoughts that I perseverated on day\nand night. These thoughts were surprisingly logical in form\nwhile being emotionally intense in content: My mother\nalmost died but didn't; my mother didn't die but she might be\nleft with severe and lasting impairments; my mother seemed\nto have some rather severe impairments and some of them\nmight or might not go away with time as her brain healed;\nmy mother was alive and here with me still, for which I was\nthankful because I wasn't ready for her to leave the earth (I\nwonder, are we ever really ready? What does it mean to be\nready?). Would I be able to sustain my energy and serve as\nher caregiver for an unknown length of time? I had been a\ncaregiver for family members and others many times in my\nlife, so I had real and direct and cumulative experience. My\nbeginning in the field of gerontology, and one of the ways I\nsupported myself right after high school and during my\nundergraduate years, was as a certified nursing assistant\nworking in nursing homes. I'd also had early training in my\nfamily. So serving as my mother's caregiver in the aftermath\nof her aneurysm wasn't a departure from my normative fam-\nily reality nor my early work roles; rather, it seemed consis-\ntent with my past experiences, though of course also distinct\nbecause of the magnitude and emergent nature of my moth-\ner's health crisis, because it was going to be for an indefinite\nlength of time a totalizing force in both of our lives, and\nbecause it happened with no warning in the middle of what\nwe were both experiencing as a gentler, calmer phase of our\nlife. Was I up to it, could I make it through another round of\ntaking care of my mother? And would my years of experi-\nence as an educational gerontologist with a commitment to\nCritical Theory help me to navigate and manage this\n6 SAGE Open\noverwhelmingly complicated situation? Could I call upon\nmy \"expertise\" for dealing with complexity now when my\nmother and I most needed it?\nThese and other thoughts looped through my mind as\nreality narrowed and many of the central features of my life\ngot knocked into the background, especially the features per-\ntaining to my professional life. It was the middle of a term in\nwhich I had a larger-than-usual collection of responsibilities:\nteaching three advanced seminars, departmental administra-\ntive duties including advising students and supervising fac-\nulty, university committee work, and outside professional\ncommitments and speaking engagements. In between tend-\ning to my mother and tending to my daughter, I made phone\ncalls and sent email messages, canceling and postponing,\ndeferring and apologizing. I asked human resources at the\nuniversity about the process should I need to take an indefi-\nnite family leave of absence; in asking, I worried that I was\nincreasing my vulnerability as an associate professor and\ndepartment chair working without a contract nor tenure (the\nuniversity where I work does not have a tenure system and is\nan \"at-will\" employer). I don't know how I did it but some-\nhow I managed to fulfill baseline professional obligations\nthat felt crucial or time-sensitive: reading student papers in\nthe hospital waiting room, answering email messages in the\nmiddle of the night, calling in favors from my colleagues and\nstudents, and asking them to extend to me their understand-\ning and benefit of the doubt during this time in which I was\ndisoriented and overwhelmed.\nPerhaps as a way to manage the intense un-synthesizable\nmixture of emotions I was flailing in, I started keeping a new\njournal specifically devoted to recording everything that was\nhappening related to my mother's crisis. From the mundane\nto the philosophical, I documented it in the little brown book\ngiven to me by a concerned friend. On the inside cover, I\nwrote the medical nomenclature for what had happened to\nmy mother--\"sub-arachnoid hemorrhage\"--and accompa-\nnied the words with a drawing of an upside-down spider,\nimagining that there was a huge red arachnid lodged supine\nat the bottom of my mother's skull. I listed the many medica-\ntions she would have to take every 2-4-6 hours 'round-the-\nclock for an indefinite length of time, dispensed by me until\nshe might be able to monitor the elaborate system for herself.\nI did a lot of free-writing about anything I could remember\nfrom the weeks preceding the massive rupture, searching for\nsigns of the impending explosion (perhaps I was imagining\nthat I might have prevented it if had I been paying more\nattention?) and I noted things my mother said and my obser-\nvations of her condition. I kept lists of contact information\nfor all of the people who would need to know about what had\nhappen to my mother, bills that I'd need to pay for her, and\nreminders to myself of my other responsibilities: my daugh-\nter's schedule or tasks at work that had to be completed by\nme or by a proxy. I studied medical journal articles and took\nnotes about what had happened to her: the etiology of the\naneurysm, the symptoms and treatment and long-term\nprognosis. I learned that such aneurysms are hereditary and\nstrike women more often than men and are often fatal or\nresult in permanent impairment. My initial impression was\nconfirmed that my mother had somehow beaten the odds of\nthis unexpected and devastating thing that had happened to\nher.\nI still don't quite understand how it was possible, but even\nin the middle of my mother's crisis, and my own crisis that\nwas triggered by her crisis, I felt strongly that while this was\nno doubt a traumatic and stressful experience, it was also a\npotentially liminal event in our intertwined lives. I began to\nsee connections, the ways in which what I was thinking and\nfeeling about this experience seemed to relate to, even be\nfacets of, my long-standing preoccupations: the primacy of\npersonal experience as a legitimate basis for understanding;\nthe challenges and potentialities of deep adult development\nand intentional aging; practices for transformative, emanci-\npatory teaching and learning in adulthood; the complexities\nof embodied consciousness and meaning-making in the far-\nthest reaches of the human life course. I jotted notes to\nremind myself of possible future inquiry and writing proj-\nects, about how I might use these emerging insights in my\nteaching and work with my adult students. I felt questions\npouring out of me; I could barely keep up with them! As for\nanswers, if I had any, they were at best emergent, partial, and\nprovisional. I was experiencing my own metaphoric explod-\ning brain. My sense of what was important to me in my\nwork--no, not just in my work, but in every facet of my\nmessy life--was shifting. Key features of my identity were\nbeing dismantled and reassembled in ways that I experienced\nas deeply frightening and exciting. But just as I was uncer-\ntain about whether I could fulfill my responsibility to my\nmother as her caregiver as well as mother to my daughter, I\nwas uncertain as to whether I'd have the energy, courage, and\nlife-world support to enact my aspirations for my own per-\nsonal and professional development.\nI also wondered if my body was sound enough to carry me\nthrough what I hoped would be a long journey through the\nlife course. One of my journal entries written during the ini-\ntial days after my mother's emergency reflects my sudden\nrealization that my daughter and I might be walking around\nwith hidden cerebral aneurysms. I wrote, \"Time bomb: Does\nit exist? What will set it off? Is there one within me?\" (At the\nurging of my mother's surgeon, I had a magnetic resonance\nimaging procedure [MRI] soon after her rupture; it indicated\nthe absence of any visible potential aneurysm in my brain;\nmy daughter asked to meet with her pediatrician to find out\nwhether she, too, should have an MRI). Faced with such\ncomprehensive uncertainty, I felt I had no choice but to write\nthrough my experiences, from the coldly pragmatic lists to\nwhat I now experience as heart-breaking passages about my\nthoughts and feelings as I struggled through this experience\nwith my mother (and also with my daughter), one of the Big\nEvents of Life, a point of confluence where all the existential\nfeatures of life as a human being collide: frailty,\nimpermanence, terror, suffering, love, hope. Writing became\na crucial, critical praxis through which I honored my confu-\nsion, legitimized my own and my mother's (and my daugh-\nter's) embodied experiences, and reclaimed a sense of agency\nover my life when so many aspects of it were out of my con-\nMagic Charm\nAfter her brain exploded, while she was recovering in the\nhospital and in a state of confusion punctuated by her emerg-\ning realizations of what had happened to her, especially\nabout how her life had been altered irrevocably, my mother\nwas frightened and in pain, unable to sleep. I felt as though I\nwas slammed right up against the limits of my ability to\nencourage and comfort her. The pep talks I had given her\nmany times throughout our life together whenever her confi-\ndence faltered or she was anxious now seemed quite banal.\nMy assurances that I loved her and that she was safe and that\nI'd take care of her didn't seem to do much to reduce the utter\nterror she felt. I couldn't be with her constantly while she\nwas in the ICU, though that is what she wanted, and while I\ncalled her often when I wasn't by her side, phone conversa-\ntions were very challenging for us because of the constant\npain in her head and auditory impairments as an aftereffect of\nthe aneurysm. I realized that what she needed was a strong\nimage or notion that she could hold onto, something she\ncould call up in her confused mind in the middle of the night\nlike a touchstone or a magic charm.\nI remembered an \"enticingly beautiful idea\" from a tran-\nscript of a National Public Radio interview that one of my\ncolleagues had given me the week before my mother's aneu-\nrysm. A pediatric researcher had demonstrated that \"babies'\ncells stay in their moms, not for days or weeks, but for\ndecades\" and that these cells \"protect, defend, and repair her\nfor the rest of her life whenever she gets seriously ill\" (\nKrulwich, 2006). I had my strong image around which to\ncreate for my mother a simple, positive visualization: My\nfetal cells, but in the form of little homunculi that looked just\nlike me, were coalescing around the site of my mother's\naneurysm, working day and night to make sure that her brain\nwas healing and there would be no further explosions.\nA few days after my mother underwent the special proce-\ndure to repair the aneurysm with a titanium coil, I read the\ntranscribed interview to her and then offered her the visual-\nization I had constructed, urging her to focus on the image of\ntiny little me inside her brain whenever she felt anxious or\nfrightened. For a couple of days it worked like the magic\ncharm it was intended to be. Then, one night when she was\nsuffering from an intense migraine headache that was a sec-\nondary outcome of the trauma to her brain, she called me\nweeping, repeating over and over again, \"I've been looking\nfor you in my mind like I've been doing but now I can't find\nyou. You've disappeared.\"\nHer sudden and qualitatively different dependency--the\nimmediacy of her existential vulnerability--devastated me\nand called forth my deepest, fiercest protective impulses. I\nbecame quite metaphysical. I assured her that I was in fact\nthere inside and beside her. Even if sometimes she was not\nable to find me, I wasn't hiding, nor would I ever flee from\nher. When she couldn't \"see me,\" she only needed to breathe\ndeeply and know I was there like the air.\nLiving Theory\nIn my post-crisis recovery as I endeavor to transform trauma,\nin my ongoing project to connect my \"personal experiences\"\nwith \"critical Gerontological praxis\" (Ray, 2003), I have\ncome to realize that it wasn't the event of my mother's health\ncrisis per se that was the point, and this hasn't been a story\nabout a bad thing that happened that caused me to decide to\ndo some things in my life differently because I realized (once\nagain) how precious and transient this life is. In an instant, a\nbrain explodes, a car crashes, a relationship comes to an\nabrupt end or changes dramatically, something violent alters\nreality in inconceivable and irreversible ways. For many of\nus, time unfolds unpunctuated by such violent episodes of\ncrisis. We have the sheer good fortune of living in Western\nadvanced capitalistic countries during this historical epoch.\nMost of our travels through the life course are paved with\ngood health and opportunities, at least when compared with,\nsay, those living in extremely marginal economies or in war\nzones. Typically, our lives are not strewn with daily remind-\ners of our true nature as embodied humans, the profound\nfrailty we share regardless of how we are positioned in terms\nof age, health, or ableness. As Gadow (1983) reminds us, we\nare each of us as flesh vulnerable and dependent upon each\nother. The inescapable fact is that each of us has one foot on\nthe earth and one foot in the stars.\nIt almost goes without saying that the work we do is\ninformed by the lives we live--and the lives we live are\nhopefully informed by our work, as well--especially in a\nfield such as gerontology; but I've come to want something\nmore, a deeper and larger connection between my work and\nthe rest of my life. As I aspire to do for my students, so I have\nbeen attempting to do for myself: I construct opportunities,\nsometimes only momentary and sometimes sustained, for\nengaging purposefully in critical reflection about and con-\ntemplation of what I am experiencing and learning, and ways\nI might enact my emerging understanding, make connections\nbetween (and perhaps resist the boundaries around) the per-\nsonal and the professional, my inside world and my life-\nworld, my experiences as a daughter, a mother, and a Critical\nEducational Gerontologist living in a particular time/place\nand space(s). In all honestly, I didn't come out of this experi-\nence with my mother with a sense of new personal coherence\nor theoretical certitude or professional mastery. Instead, I\nwas broken wide open and in being broken and open I real-\nized that my only way through the accumulated trauma was\nto embrace rather than flee from uncertainty and instability\nand complexity. My relationship with Gerontological Critical\nTheory became less abstract and more grounded in lived\n8 SAGE Open\nexperience, my form of consciousness more \"meta.\" The\n\"something new and good\" that I hoped would emerge from\nmy experience caring for my mother during and after her cri-\nsis began to take shape. I understood that a way to transform\ntrauma, my own and others', as well as dwell within the rich\nmessiness of my life, was through critical Gerontological\npraxis in which I emancipated myself from the oppressive\nexpectations \"in and out of academe, which dictate how we\nshould think, research, write about, teach, and otherwise con-\nstruct knowledge regarding age, aging, and age relations\"\nNew questions began to emerge and invite my sustained\nattention: What are the social and ideological impediments\nor challenges to our own and others'capacities for resilience,\nadaptation, and growth as we travel through the adult life\ncourse, and how do we address these structural issues and\nenhance individual agency? What happens when I de-com-\npartmentalize my life, when I resist the fracturing of my\nidentity that can result from occupying multiple, often dispa-\nrate roles? What are intellectual and spiritual practices for\nengaging the big questions of being human? Can we learn to\napply intentionality to deep development and aging without\nthe need for such brutal reminders of impermanence and fra-\ngility? When these brutal reminders come into our lives, and\nthey will, how can we recognize them as opportunities for\npersonal growth, enhanced relationships with others, even\nnew modes of being-in-the-world?\nIn reflecting upon the extent to which my \"expertise\" as a\nCritical Educational Gerontologist helped me cope with this\ncrisis, my commitment to Critical Gerontology deepened and\ntransformed. I came to realize that at heart, I am a\nGerontological-anarchist: I'm committed to freedom and\ncreativity as we travel through the life course more than I am\ncommitted to the codification, standardization, and institu-\ntionalization of ideas and practices around the human aging\njourney. I simultaneously appreciate and see through the\ndesire to make the messiness of this human experience tidy.\nThe human journey is a complex, multifaceted process that\nunfolds over a long period of time--if we are fortunate--\nand, thus, invites and even demands a multifaceted, nuanced,\nand critical approach. How could my work as a Critical\nEducational Gerontologist devoted to this wild, emergent,\nand complex phenomenon be anything less than wild, emer-\ngent, and complex?\nInterlude: Space and Time (September\nI have written and re-written various sections of this essay at\ndifferent times over the span of several years. The day upon\nwhich I wrote this interlude was almost 7 months to the day\nsince I heard the voicemail message from my mother. She\nwas calling from the roadside where she had crashed her car\nto tell me she thought she was having a stroke or aneurysm.\nI hadn't answered the call and so she left a message on my\ncell phone. At the time of her call, I was in the bathroom\ngrooming myself in preparation for her expected arrival for\ndinner. When I listened to the message, I was so shocked by\nher slurred speech that I accidentally dropped the cell phone\ninto the toilet.\nThe site of the crash is on the route I drive from the neigh-\nborhood where we live to the university where I work. Each\ntime I make the drive, I am reminded of the trauma we are\nstill living through. My mother returned to full-time work\nout of necessity a few months after her ruptured aneurysm .\nI'd have given just about anything if she could have taken\nmore time on medical leave not only to recover from the rup-\nture but also to engage in emotional healing and self-reflec-\ntion, so that she might start the difficult work of integrating\nthis event into her sense of self. Instead, she's back to \"nor-\nmal\" life but she feels anything but \"normal.\" I received an\nemail message from her in which she wrote,\nYesterday was a particularly difficult day. Three huge errors\nwere brought to my attention at work. Last week I noticed that I\nwas more confused than usual . . . not sure why. My boss was\nvery kind about my errors but it threw me for a loop. I hope that\nI can heal from this aneurysm before I cause harm to someone\nand/or lose my job because I can't do it anymore. I am so\nfrustrated and sad. I am going to do as you suggested and be\nvery kind to myself and not stress too much.\nFrustration, sadness, intermittent confusion, even some\nanger, and resentment are emotion states that my mother\nstruggles with on a daily basis. But all of these feelings are\ncounter-balanced--I think, I hope--by a renewed sense of\ngladness to be alive.\nIn addition to returning to full-time work, my mother\nresumed many of the other activities of her \"normal\" life:\ndaily fitness walking, small trips to visit family and friends,\nand active (though circumscribed) planning for her future.\nThe one activity she has decided not to resume is formal edu-\ncation; she will not fulfill her dream of completing her under-\ngraduate degree. And there are new activities in my mother's\nlife. Every 6 months for the next several years, she will have\na diagnostic angiogram or an MRI to determine if the site of\nthe ruptured aneurysm is still stable.\nThe first round of these tests, 6-months-out from the cri-\nsis, revealed that the site of the aneurysm was exposed, that\nthe titanium coil had compressed and my mother was at risk\nfor another rupture. This news was hard for us to take. The\nodds were so small that something like this would happen\n(close to as small as the odds that she'd experience and sur-\nvive a ruptured aneurysm in the first place) and the conse-\nquences of not fixing the rupture site could be serious, even\nfatal. She scheduled the procedure immediately, wasting no\ntime and without consulting me. The date of her hospitaliza-\ntion was the first day of Fall term at my university; in fact, it\nwas the first day I was scheduled to teach a new course. I\nrealized then in a way I hadn't fully realized during the initial\ncrisis that this was the \"new normal\" for us; my professional\nand personal responsibilities have some kind of significance\nand importance but they have to be balanced indefinitely\nwith the reality of my mother's delicate embodiment. Our\nshared reality has been altered; we mark the passage of time\nbased on how long it has been since the moment her brain\nexploded.\nPost-Script: Collaborative Moments\nI had been working on this essay for some time before I\noffered to read it to my mother, though before I got too far\nunderway with the writing of it, I asked her for her permis-\nsion to put at its center our still-raw experiences. I've read\nsections of this essay to students and friends and colleagues.\nI've discussed its theoretical foundations with generous and\ninsightful colleagues in the United States and United\nKingdom. But when I was asked the year after the crisis to\noffer a presentation at the continuing care retirement com-\nmunity (\"CCRC\") that is adjacent to the campus where I\nwork, I realized that this could be an opportunity to put into\npraxis my Gerontological Critical Theory commitments,\nespecially my commitment to cross-generational collabora-\ntive inquiry. More pragmatically, I hoped whoever attended\nmy presentation might offer me some much-needed help, as\nat that time, this was an essay looking for an ending!\n(Actually, I suspect I was looking for some resolution to the\ntumultuous period my mother and I had experienced.)\nI decided to do a \"performance\" of an earlier iteration of\nthis essay with an audience composed of elders living in the\nCCRC and the surrounding community, administrators and\ncaregivers working at the CCRC, and faculty and students\nfrom my university. I began the performance, which included\na reading of the essay followed by open discussion, by shar-\ning with the audience that the essay was a work-in-progress\nthat I'd been writing over several month (now over several\nyears!) and that it had come to a rather definite (though hope-\nfully temporary) standstill. I told the audience that I simply\ncouldn't figure out how this essay wanted to end, though I\nwas definitely ready for it to end, and that I invited them to\ncollaborate with me in thinking through the possible forms\nthe ending might take. I also let them know that the process\nof writing early versions of the essay had been a profound\nexperience for me because it is a testimony to a significant\nlife-crisis and an intentional effort to integrate this experi-\nence into my sense of self (as well as support my mother in\nher efforts to do so as well). I hoped my mother's experience\nand my experience with her would count for something,\nwould instigate something new and good.\nThe reading of the essay took about 45 minutes. It took\nplace in a dark dining room without a functioning micro-\nphone system; there had been a bad storm with high winds\nand, as a consequence, a power outage. As I read the essay,\nas I projected my voice so all could hear, including those\naudience members with hearing impairments, my throat\nbecame dry and strained. I was quite shaken by the emotional\nand physical effort it took to make it through reading the\nessay under such conditions. I had tears in my eyes. I was\ncovered with nervous sweat and exhausted. I felt vulnerable\nas I'd never before revealed so much of myself and my life in\nsuch a public venue, nor had I ever delivered this style of\npresentation.\nAt the conclusion of reading the essay, I left the protection\nof the podium and ventured out into the large audience. I\nasked, \"So, what do you think? How does this essay wish to\nend?\" One of my close colleagues laughed as she\nsuggested,\n\"Maybe you should end the essay by telling about how after you\nheard the message from your mother where she told you she\nthought she was having a stroke you were so shocked you\ndropped your cell phone in the toilet!\"\nAnew student at my university whom I'd yet to meet said,\nwith tears in her eyes,\n\"I'm very surprised and moved by what you've just read. I can't\nbelieve what you and your family have lived through. It is very\nbrave of you to share all of that with us. I hope you and your\nmom will be okay.\"\nA woman who lives at the CCRC asked me if I was doing\nokay, if I was eating well and taking care of myself, if I had\na faith tradition to bolster me in times of trouble, and if I was\nstill scared and sad. Other audience members related stories\nabout their own losses and existential concerns: spouses who\nhad died suddenly or tragically, adult children who were suf-\nfering with mental illness, other unexpected life crises that\nthey had survived. We exchanged poignant stories for some\ntime and then I asked the audience yet again for advice as to\nhow this essay might wish to end. Another woman who lives\nat the CCRC said something that has stayed with me and has\nbeen borne out in subsequent months and years in my experi-\nences as my mother's daughter. She said, in a very quiet\nvoice, that only I and a few others could hear, \"I don't think\nthere can be an ending for such a thing. I think you need to\naccept that there is no ending, that it is an unfolding story.\"\n"
