    "abstract": "Abstract\nSemantic loss, which refers to over-, under-, or mistranslation of a source text (ST), may result in partial or complete loss\nof meaning in the target text (TT). This phenomenon is prevalent in the translations of an ST, especially translations of the\nHoly Qur'an due to factors such as the lack of equivalence of some cultural words in the target language (TL). In relation to\nthis, translators of this holy book have been critiqued for their inability to completely convey the true and accurate meanings\nof the Holy Qur'an. This study attempted to investigate the semantic loss in the translation of the Surah al-WaqiAAa by\nAbdullah Yusuf Ali. It also examined the frequency and causes of such losses. This research, which is qualitative in nature,\nutilized descriptive content analysis of the Surah. The translation of the ayat [verses] related to the problem of the research\nhas been extracted from the work of Abdullah Yusuf Ali, The Holy Qur'an: Text and Translation. The meanings of the translated\nverses were verified by two Arabic language experts who had mastered English as well. The causes of losses were identified\naccording to Baker's typology. The findings showed frequent partial and complete semantic loss of meanings mostly due to\nmistranslations, semantic complexity of the vocabularies, and culture.\n",

However,\nto achieve fruitful communication between any two differ-\nent linguistic codes, full command of the two languages is\nrequired: the source language (SL) and the target language\n(TL). The absence of such understanding would pose quan-\ndaries in transferring the intended meaning from one lan-\nguage to another; consequently, ineluctable losses could\noccur. Thus, any translation process should ensure that the\ntarget text (TT) presents the key elements of the source text\n(ST) by incorporating it well into the incipient product to\nproduce the same effect as was intended by the ST. One such\nsignificant motivation for the translation of the Holy Qur'an\ninto another language such as English is the fact that many\nMuslims do not speak Arabic, and, thus, the need for schol-\nars to translate the Holy Qur'an to communicate its message\nto Muslims all over the world is paramount (Mohammed,\n2005). However, for a text such as the Holy Qur'an, which\nconveys the words ofAllah theAlmighty, translating it poses\nlots of difficulties and quandaries for translators.\nStatement of the Problem\nOne of the difficulties in translating the Holy Qur'an is that\nsome lexicons are Qur'an specific, and they do not have\nequivalents in English. For example, the Qur'anic word \n[tayammamoo1] does not have an equivalent word in English\n(Khalaf & Y\nusoff, 2012). Thus, when an attempt is made to\ntranslate this word into English, its original meaning could\nbe lost. Another thing is that there are some deviations and\nundertranslations as a result of not referring to the interpreta-\ntions of the Holy Qur'an, lack of understanding of Arabic\n1Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nNoureldin Mohamed Abdelaal, Faculty of Modern Languages and\nCommunication, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 UPM Serdang, Selangor,\nMalaysia.\nEmail: nourabdelal@yahoo.com\nSemantic Loss in the Holy Qur'an\nTranslation With Special Reference to\nSurah Al-WaqiAAa (Chapter of The Event\nInevitable)\nNoureldin Mohamed Abdelaal1 and Sabariah Md Rashid1\n Keywords\nsemantic loss, translation, Holy Qur'an, Surah Al-WaqiAAa\n2 SAGE Open\nlinguistics, and inability to decode and convey the nuances\nIn relation to this research, some previous research was\nconducted to address the phenomenon of deviations, such as\nsemantic loss in some verses (Ali, Brakhw, Nordin, & Ismail,\nto focus on the semantic loss in only certain verses from dif-\nferent chapters. To date, little is known about the semantic\nloss in English translations of complete chapters. Thus, there\nis a need for further research to investigate such types of\nsemantic losses in the translation of certain chapters in the\nHoly Qur'an. In addition, Surah al-WaqiAAa has not been\nexamined from this perspective. Therefore, the proposed\nresearch sought to examine the types of semantic losses in\nthe English translation of this Surah byAbdullah Y\nusufAli.\nResearch Objectives\nSpecifically, the present research sought to (a) examine\nsemantic loss in the English translation of Surah al-WaqiAAa\nand the types of these losses and (b) identify the causes of the\nidentified semantic losses. In the context of this research, the\nterm losses refers to two senses. In the general sense, it refers\nto the partial or complete loss of any verbal sign (e.g., word,\nphrase, sentence); while in its specific sense, the term refers\nto losses affecting the interpretation of these verbal signs on\nthe semantic level (Al-Masri, 2009). Such losses can reduce\nor negatively affect the ways by which target readers under-\nstand the TT.\nLiterature Review\nThe semantic relationship between words in two different\nlanguages does not correspond to one-to-one sets or even\none-to-many sets; in addition, there are a lot of fuzziness,\nobscurity, and ambiguity in the boundaries between any\ntwo languages (Nida, 1994). Because of these complicated\nboundaries between languages, translators face the challenge\nof losing meaning in their TTs. The TL's linguistic system\ncannot represent a lot of meanings in the SL. For example,\nthe grammar of English sometimes does not have plural\nforms of words in which plurality makes a big difference in\nIn Arabic, the words  [alriah] and [alreeh]\n\"wind\" have two contrasting meanings; the first plural\nword expresses blessing whereas the singular expresses\npunishment.\nIn translation, semantic loss may occur due to those dif-\nferences of mapping vocabularies in different languages.\nLanguages map words in different ways; a concept that can\nbe expressed by just one word in English may be expressed\nby many words in another language. For example, in English,\ntable can be rendered into different lexemes in the Polish lan-\nguage (Ameel, Malt, Storms, & V\noccurs in Arabic frequently. The English word cup can be\nrendered into diverse lexemes inArabic with different shades\nof meaning. In particular, in Arabic and the Qur'anic lan-\nguage, the word cup may mean  [ka/as],  [koub], and\n [ibreeq]. Such a gap of mapping vocabularies results in\ndifficulty in translation, and, hence, loss is likely to occur.\nSemantic losses, cultural losses or inequivalences, can\nresult from overlooking the literariness or figurativeness of\nthe ST. Translators sometimes do not observe the figures of\nspeech or rhetorical devices in the SL. Besides, they some-\ntimes have problems in observing the symbolic level, and, as\na result, a loss in literary translation occurs (Al-Masri, 2009).\nThis also applies to the Holy Qur'an whose language is more\nsophisticated than literary texts.\nProblems in translation that lead to semantic loss may fall\ninto two broad types: linguistic (semantic and syntactic) and\ncultural. Those semantic problems can include lexical and\nmorphological problems.\nLexical Problems in Translation\nLexical and morphological problems are among the promi-\nnent problems in translation. These may include synonymy,\npolysemy and homonymy, lexical gaps, and collocations.\nSynonymy\nSynonymy, a lexical relationship term used to refer to the\nhas been identified as one of the troubles in translation from\nArabic into English. Shunnaq (1992) states that translating\ncognitive synonyms2 is confusing due to the slight differ-\nences between these synonyms. Hence, a good criterion can\nbe the intuition of a native Arabic speaker who is able to\njudge such differences better. For example, the slight dif-\nference between  [yaghbit] and  [yahsud] cannot be\nrealized without having intuitive and deep knowledge of the\ndifferences between synonyms in Arabic. As a result, trans-\nlators may use \"envy\" as an equivalent for both, though it\nis completely divergent from the real meaning because the\nfirst word,  [yaghbit], has a positive implication, whereas\nthe latter word,  [yahsud], has a negative implication\nSynonyms, in a religious context such as the Holy Qur'an,\nare a more intricate issue. The Holy Qur'an language is the\nmost eloquent language among the different Arabic dialects.\nTranslators sometimes render some words as synonyms,\nthough they are not. Translating what look to be synonymous\nverbs is also problematic. Arberry3 considered  [yahlif]\nand  [yuqsim] as synonyms, and he translated them as\n\"swear.\" In Arabic, the two verbs have different implica-\ntions. The verb  [yahlif] is used in the Holy Qur'an to\nrefer to hypocrites and disbelievers, which means breaking\nthe oath; the verb  [yuqsim] is utilized in the Holy Qur'an\nto refer to believers who fulfill their promises and oaths\nAbdelaal and Md Rashid 3\nSimilar to the problems above, Abdul-Raof (2005) dis-\ncussed some problems that translators faced and sometimes\nfailed to overcome. He mentioned that semantic void is one\nof the prevalent difficulties faced by translators, which is\ncaused by the inability to differentiate in meaning between\ncognitive synonyms. Consider the following example from\nSurah alAAmran:\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n    \n\n  \n  \n  \n) \n[Nazzala AAalayka alkitaba bialhaqqi musaddiqan lima bayna\nyadayhi waanzala alttawrata waal-injeela]\nArberry (1996) translates this verse as follows: \"He has sent\ndown upon thee the Book with the truth, confirming what was\nbefore it, and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel\" (p. 73).\nIn this verse,Arberry translated the two verb words \"\"\n[nazzala] and \"\" [anzala] as \"send down,\" as if the two\nwords were synonyms. However, in Arabic, they have dif-\nferent senses; the first lexicon \"\" [nazzala] signifies the\npiecemeal revelation of the Holy Qur'an over 23 years.\nIn contrast, the second lexicon \"\" [anzala] signifies to\nreveal (the gospel and Torah) at one instance. Hence, in this\ncase, the translator has failed to show the nuances between\nAnother problem in the use of synonyms is the collocated\ncognitive synonyms. These synonymous words, which come\ntogether for both emphasis and stylistic or aesthetic purposes,\nare referred to as collocated synonyms. The second synonym\nis usually used to add beauty to the text or to create rhythm\n(Shehab, 2009). Translating those synonyms cannot be done\nby translators, and when translated, they look redundant\n(Shehab, 2009). For example, the English noun \"despair\"\nmay be translated as   [qoonootun wa ya/s]. The two\nArabic words (i.e.,  [qoonoot] and  [ya/s]) are syn-\nonyms; however, the second synonym (i.e., ) was used to\nadd beauty to the translation (Shehab, 2009).\nIn sum,Arabic, unlike English, is rich with synonyms. For\nfor the word \"\" [alssaif] \"the sword\" and 8 synonyms\nfor the word  [alaAAsl] \"honey.\" Richness of synony-\nmous vocabularies in the Arabic language, in general, and\nthe Qur'anic language, in particular, poses difficulties for a\ntranslator as he may use one synonym in lieu of another that\nis more accurate.\nPolysemy and Homonymy\nThere are two views regarding lexical ambiguity: that words\nhave their lexical ambiguity prior to their semantic occur-\nrence inside a text or that lexical ambiguity is context depen-\ndent, and this means it occurs due to the effect of the text\n(Simpson, 1981). Homonymy and polysemy are two of the\nmain causes of lexical ambiguity. Homonymy refers to this\nsense relationship when two words have the same spelling but\ndifferent meanings (Crystal, 1991). A classical example for\nhomonymy is the word bank as a financial institution, which\nis defined by Collins (2006) CoBuild Advanced Learner'\ns\nEnglish Dictionary as \". . . an institution where people or\nbusinesses keep their money\" (p. 97), or the bank of a river,\nwhich is defined by Collins CoBuild Advanced Learner's\nEnglish Dictionary as \". . . the raised areas of ground along its\n[river] edge\" (p. 98). Polysemy, on the contrary, refers to mul-\ntiplicity of meanings as when a word is used in different fields\nLexical ambiguity is very common in language as a sin-\ngle string of words may lead to more than one interpreta-\ntion because one of the words has more than one meaning\nsemy can be confused with homonymy if two words with the\nsame spelling or pronunciation have two different meanings.\nAccording to the generative lexicon approach, homonymy\noccurs when distinct senses are stored separately, whereas\npolysemy occurs only when the basic meaning is stored in\nthe lexical repertoire of the person (Klepousniotou, 2001).\nPut simply, polysemy refers to multiplicity of meanings as\nwhen a word is used in different fields with different mean-\nings (Geeraerts, 2010). For example, the word  [aAAin]\nhas a lot of meanings in Arabic such as   [aAAinu\nalssawab] and   [aAAinu alhaqeeqah], which mean\ncompletely right, and  [aAAinu alibrah], which\nmeans the eye of a needle. It can also mean a spy, among\nother meanings. Thus, they are polysemes because they have\nthe same etymological root (Sadiq, 2008). Such a kind of\npolysemy might create ambiguity for a translator.\nIn relation to the Holy Qur'an, polysemy is one of its\nlinguistic features. For instance, the word  [ummah] has\nnine polysemic meanings in the Holy Qur'an. It may mean\na period of time as in Surah Ysuf (V\nerse 45) or a religious\nleader who leads people to the right path as in Surah AlNnahl\n(V\nerse 120). Many translators fail to pick the correct mean-\ning; hence, they render it incorrectly (Ali et al., 2012).\nConsider the following example:\n\n  \n \n \n \n  \n      \n\n \n  \n \n\n[Inna ibraheema kana ommatan qanitan lillahi haneefan walam\nyaku mina almushrikeena]\nArberry (1996) translates this verse as follows: \"Surely,\nAbraham was a nation obedient unto God, a man of pure faith\nand no idolater\" (p. 300). Abdullah Y\nalso translates this verse as follows: \"Abraham was indeed\na model, devoutly obedient to Allah, (and) true in Faith, and\nthese translations, we find Arberry's translation is out of con-\ntext. He translated the word  [ummah] as \"nation,\" which\nis not the correct sense in this context. The words  [ummah]\nhere refers to being an Islamic good example who teaches peo-\nple their religion, and who has a great deal of faith and piety\n4 SAGE Open\nlike Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Another example\ngiven by (Sadiq, 2008) is the Qur'anic verb  [daAAa] in\nthe following verses where it has different shades of meaning.\n    \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n    \n  \n \n  \n\n  \n\n[Hunalika daAAa zakariyya rabbahu qala rabbi hab lee min\nladunka thurriyyatan tayyibatan innaka sameeAAu aldduAAa]\nPickthall (1956) translates this verse as follows: \"Then\nZachariah prayed unto his Lord and said: My Lord! Bestow\nupon me of Thy bounty goodly offspring. Lo! Thou art the\nHearer of Prayer\" (p. 36).\n\n  \n   \n      \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n[Ya ayyuha allatheena amanoo istajeeboo lillahi walilrrasooli\nitha daAAakum lima yuhyeekum waiAAlamoo anna Allaha\nyahoolu bayna almar-i waqalbihi waannahu ilayhi tuhsharoona]\nPickthall (1956) translates this verse as follows:\nO ye who believe! Obey Allah, and the messenger when He\ncalleth you to that which quickeneth you, and know that Allah\ncometh in between the man and his own heart, and that He it is\nunto Whom ye will be gathered. (p. 125)\n     \n \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n  \n   \n   \n \n \n\n  \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n    \n \n \n\n \n    \n \n\n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n   \n  \n   \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n\n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n    \n \n\n \n     \n   \n \n[Y\na ayyuha allatheena amanoo la tadkhuloo buyoota alnnabiyyi illa\nan yu/thana lakum ila taAAamin ghayra nathireena inahu walakin\nitha duAAeetum faodkhuloo fa-itha taAAimtum faintashiroo wala\nmusta/niseena lihadeethin inna thalikum kana yu/thee alnnabiyya\nfayastahyee minkum waAllahu la yastahyee mina alhaqqi wa-itha\nsaaltumoohunna mataAAan fais-aloohunna min wara-i hijabin\nthalikum atharu liquloobikum waquloobihinna wama kana lakum\nan tu/thoo rasoolaAllahi wala an tankihoo azwajahu min baAAdihi\nabadan inna thalikum kana AAinda Allahi AAatheeman]\nPickthall (1956) translates this verse as follows:\nO Ye who believe! Enter not the dwellings of the Prophet for a\nmeal without waiting for the proper time, unless permission be\ngranted you. But if ye are invited, enter, and, when your meal\nis ended, then disperse. Linger not for conversation. Lo! that\nwould cause annoyance to the Prophet, and he would be shy\nof (asking) you (to go); but Allah is not shy of the truth. And\nwhen ye ask of them (the wives of the Prophet) anything, ask\nit of them from behind a curtain. That is purer for your hearts\nand for their hearts. And it is not for you to cause annoyance\nto the messenger of Allah, nor that ye should ever marry his\nwives after him. Lo! that inAllah's sight would be an enormity.\nThe verb  [da'aa] in these three verses is polysemic; it\nhas three related meanings. In the first verse (3:38), it means\n\"invoke\"; in the second (8:24), it means \"call\"; and in the third\nperienced translator may fall in the trap of using one form with\nthose different senses or shades of meaning (Sadiq, 2010).\nTheoretical Framework\nTranslation is the process of communicating a meaning in a ST\nthrough a means of an equivalent TT. Theories of translation\nhave always tended to revolve around the two poles of \"literal\"\n(or word-for-word) and \"free\" (or sense-for-sense) translation\n(citation needed). The concept of \"equivalence\" has always\nbeen a topic of discussion among different scholars of transla-\ntion (Munday, 2001). The concept of \"equivalence\" has always\nbeen a topic of discussion among different scholars of trans-\nlation (Baker, 2004)). Literature is abundant with translation\ntheory, and Baker's (1992) typology. This research is basically\nbased on Baker's typology of equivalence between English and\nArabic. This theory or typology was selected because it is the\nmost relevant theory. It discusses exhaustively the non-equiva-\nlence problem at different levels. It also points out the equiva-\nlence problems between English and Arabic. Baker (1992)\nbelieves that the concept of \"equivalence\" is relative because it\nis affected by many linguistic and cultural factors. She adopts\na neutral approach in her notion of equivalence (Panou, 2013).\nEquivalence at Word Level (Baker's Typology)\nAs mentioned earlier, Baker (1992) discussed equivalence at\nthe different levels; however, this research refers to the equiv-\nalence and non-equivalence at the word level. According to\nBaker (1992), it is important to distinguish between lexi-\ncal items and units of meaning to achieve good translation.\nMeanings, furthermore, differ in the orthographic words that\nrepresent them from one language to another. For example,\nthe meaning of one orthographic word in one language may\nbe represented by several orthographic words in another lan-\nguage and vice versa. For instance, \"\" [alreeh] and \"\"\n[alriaah], in Arabic, have only one equivalent representation\nin English, namely wind. Consequently, there is no one-to-one\ncorrespondence between orthographic words and elements of\nmeaning within or across languages. Baker categorizes non-\nequivalence at the word level into 11 types; however, in the\ncontext of the current research only 8 types are discussed:\n1. Culture-specific terms and concepts in the two lan-\nguages: Such culture-specific terms may include\nIslamic terms and concepts. For example, the word\nAbdelaal and Md Rashid 5\n [salah] does not have equivalent in English. The\nArabic word  [salah] refers to praying to Allah\nAlmighty 5 times a day in certain way preceded by\nmaking ablution  [wudu'aa]. Another example\nof such culture-specific terms may include Arabic\ncustoms, food, and social life; for example, \n[alssabiAA], which does not have an equivalent\nterm in English. The Arabic word  [alssabiAA]\nrefers to a custom in Egypt, whereby the family of\nthe bride visit their daughter in her husband's house\nafter approximately 7 days, taking with them some\nfood.\n2. Arabic terms that are not lexicalized in English like\nthe word  [yatawra], which can be represented\nby a phrase but not a single word; that is, to hide from\npeople. Y\net, this paraphrase does not imply the full\nmeaning of the word.\n3. Arabic words that are semantically complex. For\ninstance, the word  [ghusl], which refers to tak-\ning a bath after ejaculation or having intimate rela-\ntionship with a wife. This bath is recommended to be\npreceded by ablution  [wudu'aa].\n4. Arabic and English make different distinctions in\nmeaning. For example, the plurality in the Holy\nQur'an does not serve only for a grammatical pur-\npose; it adds extra meaning that sometimes gives the\nopposite connotations. TheArabic word  [alreeh]\n\"wind,\" which is singular, has punishment meaning.\nWhereas the second word  [alriah], which is\nplural, has a blessing and bounty meaning.\n5. English lacks a specific term (hyponym). For exam-\nple, anArabic lexical item may have many hyponyms,\nwhereas the English linguistic system does not have\nequivalent lexical items for theArabic hyponyms.\n6. English lacks specific terms (superordinate).\n7. Differences between Arabic and English in expres-\nsive meaning.\n8. Differences in form.\nMethod\nResearch Design\nThis research employed a descriptive qualitative approach;\nspecifically the content analysis type of the qualitative\nresearch. This approach requires written language that the\nresearcher examines, to identify the losses in meaning and\nthe causes behind them. Besides this, this research does not\ndepend on quantities or numbers. Strauss and Corbin (1990)\ndefine qualitative research as the one that refers to any kind\nof research that produces findings that are not attained by\nmeans of statistical procedures or other means of quantifica-\ntion, and instead, the kind of research that produces findings\narrived from real-world settings where the interest area is\nSampling\nIn this research, Ali's English translation of Surah al-\nWaqiAAa constitutes the data of the research. The transla-\ntion was extracted from the work of Abdullah Y\nusuf Ali\nresearch employs purposive sampling as the selected data\nwere elicited based on the research objectives. Purposive\nsampling is the sampling based on selecting samples for a\ndefined purpose, and this kind of sampling increases trans-\nferability (Teddlie & Y\ntranslated verses of Surah al-WaqiAAa that show semantic\nloss. According to the literature (e.g., Patton, 1990), quali-\ntative inquiry focuses in depth on somewhat small sam-\nples. However, these samples should be purposeful ones.\nPurposeful sampling refers to selecting information- rich\nData Collection Procedures\nData collection in a qualitative research may include obser-\nvations of targeted events, focus group interviews and the\nexamination of documents and artifacts (Sandelowski,\n2000). In relation to this research, the English text of the Holy\nQur'an translation of Y\nusuf Ali was collected for analysis\npurpose. The data collection involved several steps: First, the\nSurah al-WaqiAAa and its interpretation (tafsir) in the exege-\nand Sayid Qutb (2006) tafsir were identified followed by the\nidentification of the matching translation of Surah al-Waq-\niAAa by Y\nHoly Qur'an: Translation and Commentary.\" After that, the\ntranslation was examined to understand the lexical meanings\nof the verses. Finally, a comparison of the lexical meanings\nin the translation and the authentic meanings in the exegesis\nbooks, and the Arabic monolingual dictionaries, such as Al\nMoAAjam al-Waseet (Mustafa, Az-Zayyat, Abdel Qader, &\nData Analysis\nThe content analysis approach has been used in this study.\ncontent analysis is a strategy of choice in qualitative descrip-\ntive studies, which is a dynamic form of analysis of verbal\nand visual data that is oriented toward summarizing the\ninformational contents of these data. Qualitative content\nanalysis is data driven; that is, codes are not only system-\natically applied, but they were also generated from the data\nthemselves in the course (Sandelowski, 2000).\nSubsequently, the researcher used interpretation books\nas a reference for examining the authentic meanings of the\nverses under study and identifying the semantic losses.\n6 SAGE Open\nTafsir Alt-Tabari (2003), Tafsir al Qurtubi (AlQurtubi,\n(Al-Kash-shaaf; 1407 A.H) were used as the main exegesis\nbooks to examine the interpretation of the verses. In addition,\ndifferent related articles and books were used to support the\nfindings of the research. Books of heritage were also referred\nto, such as \"alMufradat fi Ghareeb Al Qur'an\" \"Strange\nV\nocabularies in the Holy Qur'an\" by Al-Asfahani (n.d.).\nDictionaries such as Collins CoBuild Advanced Learner's\nEnglish Dictionary and Cambridge Advanced Dictionary\nwere used to check the meanings of lexicons in the trans-\nlations. Moreover, two experts4 of Arabic language who are\nproficient in English participated in the verification of the\nselected data.\nResults and Discussion\nThe analysis of the data revealed that the extent of semantic\nlosses in the English translation of Surah al-WaqiAAa can be\neither complete or partial. These losses occur due to using\nwords that are not proper in their respective semantic fields\n(shift in meaning). More details about these losses are dis-\ncussed in the following sections.\nPartial or Complete Loss\nComplete losses are the losses that change the meaning\nor give an opposite one. However, partial losses are those\nlosses in which the message of the ST is partially conveyed.\nExamining the verses under study carefully, it can be seen\nthat the verses sometimes show partial loss of meaning;\nwhile, sometimes, they show complete loss of meaning.\nMostly, the over dominant type of loss is the partial one. For\nexample, in the first verse (see Table 1, Sample 1), there is a\ncomplete loss because the meaning of the Day of Judgment\ncannot be conveyed by words such as \"event\" or \"comes to\npass.\" The meaning of the ST word is very effective and has\na strong effect on the ears of native speakers of Arabic. An\nexample of partial loss is V\nerse 13 (Sample 3) as the meaning\nhas been conveyed, but not accurately.\nSemantic Losses (Shift in Meaning)\nThe shift in meaning that results from using a word that is\nnot proper in a semantic field is one of the common types\nof losses in Ali's translation of the Surah. A semantic field\ndenotes a segment of reality symbolized by a set of related\nwords. These words in a semantic field share a common\nsemantic property (Brinton, 2000). Hence, many words can\nshare shades of meaning, but they do have differences in\ntheir denotations as well as their connotations. As a result,\ntranslators sometimes choose one word, while the other one\nis the more precise option. Table 1 shows examples of such a\nkind of losses in the Surah.\nFrom Table 1, it can be seen that the translator tends to\nuse vocabularies that do not convey the intended meaning.\nFor example, the first verse (Sample 1) was translated as fol-\nlows: \"When the Event inevitable cometh to pass.\" In this\nverse, \" \n\" alwaqiAAat was translated as \"the event inevi-\ntable,\" and this is not proper because the two words are not\nequivalent. The English word event refers to \"something that\nhappens, especially when it is unusual or important\" (Collins\nCoBuild Advanced Learner's English Dictionary, 2006,\np.485), while the Arabic Qur'anic word is one of the names\nof the Day of Judgment; there could be huge number of\nevents, but there will be no more than one Day of Judgment.\nThe verse refers to the occurrence of the Day of Judgment\nevent as the translation implies. In addition, the translation\ndoes not convey the meaning that is intuitively realized by a\nnative speaker ofArabic.The literal meaning of the word refers\nto something that falls from a high point and then becomes\nstill (Qutb, 2006). This word is always used to refer to hard\nsituations and punishment; for example, another verse goes\nas \"   \" [Saala sa-ilun biAAathabin waqiAAin]\n\"A questioner asked about a Penalty to befall\" (70:1; Y\nusuf\nAli's translation). Hence, the drift of the Arabic word, in this\ncontext, refers to punishment (Al-Asfahani, n.d.). Moreover,\n\"comes to pass\" is a feeble translation of the word  [waqa-\nAAati], which in its authentic SL means \"to occur\" or \"fall,\"\nand it refers to something prodigious (Al-Waseet Dictionary, p.\n1050). In this context of translation, the expressive meaning\nTable 1. Verses With Semantic Losses in Ali's Translation of Surah Al-WaqiAAa.\nSample Verse number Verse Transliteration Translation\n  Itha waqaAAati alwaqiAAatu When the Event inevitable cometh to pass,\n   Wakuntum azwajan thalathatan And ye shall be sorted out into three classes.\n3 13     Thullatun mina al-awwaleena A number of people from those of old,\n4 22   Wahoorun Aeenun And (there will be) Companions with beautiful,\nbig, and lustrous eyes,-\n    \n La yasmaAAoona feeha laghwan\nwala ta/theeman\nNot frivolity will they hear therein, nor any\ntaint of ill,-\n Wafurushin marfooAAatin And on Thrones (of Dignity), raised high.\n7 37   AAuruban atraban Beloved (by nature), equal in age,-\n \n Wabussati aljibalu bassan And the mountains shall be crumbled to atoms,\nAbdelaal and Md Rashid 7\nis lost, as well. In addition, one ST verb was translated into\nthree words, which makes the translation unfaithful to the ST.\nIt reflects an overtranslation. The translation of such verse\nconveys a complete loss of meaning, as it is not imagined\nthat a non-native speaker ofArabic perceives the meaning of\nthe ST out of the translation. In addition, the expressive and\nconnotative meanings are lost in the translation.\nIn the second sample (V\nerse 7), the English word classes\nwas used to render \"\" [azwajan]. This rendition is not\naccurate. The word class, according to the Cambridge Online\nAdvanced Learner'\ns Dictionary, means \"people who share\nrank,\" but the ST word does not mean that; it means that peo-\nple will be grouped, but with different ranks inside. In other\nwords, people will not share the same rank, as the translation\nimplies. \"Groups\" could have expressed the meaning better\nthan \"classes.\" This loss of meaning in translating the verse\nis partial because the general meaning is partially conveyed.\nSample 3 (V\nerse 13) shows a semantic loss in the transla-\ntion as \"a number of people from those of old.\" The selection\nof lexemes is inaccurate because \"a number\" implies \"sev-\neral,\" as suggested by Collins CoBuild Advanced Learner's\nEnglish Dictionary, though, according to Makhlouf (1995,\np. 324), \"\" [Thullatun] means \"a huge number or throng.\"\nMoreover, the English word old does not completely con-\nvey the meaning of the verse, which according to Alt-Tabari\ngenerations of Muslims. The translation of the verse resulted\nin complete loss of meaning, as the denotative and connota-\ntive meanings of the verse are not conveyed in the translation.\nSimilarly, in the fourth example (V\nerse 22), the transla-\ntion of \" \n  \n\" [hoorun AAeen] as \"And (there will be)\nCompanions with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes,-\" does not\ntend to be accurate. This translation does not fit in the authen-\ntic meaning because the translation gives only description to\nthe eyes disregarding the other beauties. One aspect of the\nshades of meaning was expressed, but the other secondary\nsenses were lost. The \" \n  \n\" [hoorun AAeen] expression\nis a culturally bound term that does not have an equivalent\nin English. The translator should have better transliterated or\nparaphrased it instead of creating a partial loss of meaning.\nAnother example that illustrates such type of loss is V\nerse\n25 (Sample 5), which was translated as \"not frivolity will\nthey hear therein, nor any taint of ill.\" This translation is far\nfrom being accurate. The Qur'anic word \"\" [ta/theeman]\nwas translated as \"taint of ill.\" This translation is not accurate\nbecause \"\" [ta/theeman] is something which causes sin\nsuch a meaning accurately.A\"sinful talk\" could have been a\nbetter translation. The translation of this verse echoes partial\nloss of meaning.\nLikewise, V\nerse 34 (Sample 6) was rendered as \"And on\nThrones (of Dignity), raised high.\" The Arabic word \" \n\"\n[furushin], in this context, does not mean \"thrones\"; it refers\nto the stuff put on beds for sleeping, and in this context, as\nAlt-Tabari (2003) stated, it can refer to the women of Jannah.\nMoreover, the verse has denotative and connotative mean-\nings that are lost in translation. Connotatively, it means\nhigh-ranked women, with the best attributes. Partial loss of\nmeaning is created in the translation of this verse.\nUnsurprisingly, in V\nerse 37 (Sample. 7), \"\" [AAuruban]\nwas rendered as \"Beloved (by nature)\"; it shows a complete\nloss of meaning because the authentic meaning of the word is\nwomen who approach their husbands with sweet words and\nally bound term, so translation is not possible here. Besides,\nthe rendition of the Qur'anic word into the two-word term\nbeing beloved does not imply that these women of Jannah\nwill love their husbands or attempt to be emotionally closer\nto them employing sweet words. All these shades of mean-\ning are essential and should not be avoided. Besides, they are\nunderstood by native speakers of Arabic whenever they read\ntheArabic Qur'anic text. Likewise, in V\nerse 5 (Sample 8), the\ntranslation was neither faithful nor economical to the ST, as\n\"   \" [Wabussati aljibalu bassan] was rendered to\n\"crumbled to atoms.\"According to al-Al Asfahani5 (n.d.), the\nverse means \"to be ground to flour\" (p. 58). There is a clear\nshift in meaning here.\nThese findings, indeed, are similar to the findings of\nproblem of selecting the proper synonym. A translator,\nsometimes, is misled by the many synonyms of the ST, and\nhe, accordingly, selects the improper word. These findings\nare also in line with those of Abu-Mahfouz (2011), in which\nhe referred to how translators select a certain lexeme when\nthe other one is the correct and accurate option. The Qur'anic\ntext is accurate, complex, and pregnant with meanings, so\ntranslators should be attentive and sensitive to the language\noptions in the TL.\nCauses of Semantic Loss\nFollowing Baker's typology of non-equivalence at the word\nlevel, the following causes of losses were identified.\nCulturally bound terms.Culturally bound terms are some of\nthe prominent problems of equivalence in the process of\ntranslation. Culture is the umbrella that most of the other\nsemantic problems fall under. In the V\nfor instance, the translation failed to find an equivalence to\nthe words \"\" [alwaqiAAatu] and \"\" [waqaAAati],\nrespectively, because they are culturally bound concepts that\ndo not have equivalents in English; they are purely Islamic\nreligion terms. Likewise, in the V\ntranslation failed to convey the complete meaning of \" \n\n\n\" [hoorun AAeenun] because it is a cultural concept that\ncan only be found in the Holy Qur'an.\nLack of lexicalization.Another cause of semantic loss, as\nstated by Baker (1992), is the case when the Arabic terms\nare not lexicalized in the English language. An example of\n8 SAGE Open\nlack of lexicalization in the TL is the Verse 5 (Sample 8), in\nwhich the translation attempted to convey the meaning by\nusing paraphrase as a strategy.\nSemantically complex words.Furthermore, Baker (1992) men-\ntions another cause of problems of equivalence in transla-\ntion, namely, Arabic words that are semantically complex;\nfor example, in the V\nerse 25 (Sample 5), the words \"\"\n[laghuan] and \"\" [ta/theeman] are semantically complex\nwords. They cannot be rendered in single words. Another\nclear example of the semantic complexity is the words \"\"\n[AAuruban] and \"\" [attraban], which cannot be trans-\nlated in stand-alone words. The words \"\" [AAuruban]\nand \"\" [atraban] in V\nerse 37 (Sample 7) are semanti-\ncally complex; they cannot be translated into one-word\nequivalents.\nMistranslation losses.Lossessometimesoccurduetomistrans-\nlating the verses; either because the translator has not read\nthoroughly through the exegesis books or because of lack of\nmastery of the authentic SL. In relation to this research, the\ntranslator (i.e., Y\nusuf Ali) is a non-Arab Muslim, so he tends\nsometimes to select words that are not accurate or equivalent\nin meaning though sometimes the equivalents exist.\nIn the data analysis section, it was found that the transla-\ntor failed to select the proper words. In the V\nerses 1 (Sample\n1) and 7 (Sample 2), the translator could have selected\nmore proper words in the respective semantic fields, but he\nrendered the translation with loss of meaning due to inap-\npropriate selection of words. For example, \"fall\" could\nhave expressed the meaning better in V\nerse 1 than \"occur.\"\nSimilarly, \"groups\" could have expressed the meaning better\nthan \"classes\" in V\nConclusion\nThis research has revealed that semantic loss in the English\ntranslation of Surah al-WaqiAAa exists. The loss occurs\neither completely or partially. However, partial loss tends to\nbe more common than the complete loss. In addition, trans-\nlators, sometimes, select words that are improper in their\nsemantic fields. Such inaccuracy of selected vocabulary\nleads to a shift in meaning. Many non-equivalence problems\nwere as causes for the semantic losses found in the trans-\nlation of the Surah al-WaqiAAa in the translation by Y\nusuf\nAli. This research revealed that semantic loss occurs mainly\nbecause of cultural gaps; the Qur'anic language has its own\nlexicons that are culturally bound.Another cause is the trans-\nlator's relatively poor knowledge of the sciences of the Holy\nQur'an. In this light, many approaches of translation such\nas literal translation and communicative or semantic transla-\ntion have been used by translators. However, the former (lit-\neral translation approach) has been rejected because the Holy\nQur'an cannot be translated literally, and the latter creates loss\nof meaning. Thus, in view of the complexities of the message\nconveyed in the Qur'an, it seems reasonable to state that the\nonly acceptable translation is the exegetical translation; one\nthat is based on exegesis books, which will guide a trans-\nlator in attaining accurate meaning of the TT. Without full\nknowledge of the exegesis books, a translator will inevitably\nfail in translating the Holy Qur'an. In addition, translation\nof the Holy Qur'an should be carried out by a team of schol-\nars, who are experts in the different branches of knowledge\nrelated to the Holy Qur'an.\nAppendix\nTransliteration Table (Adopted From Islamicbulletin.org of the\nQur'an Transliteration).\n + a about  n nurse\n a cat  oo pool\nsay \"a\" twice\ndistinctly with an\nopen mouth\n o on\n b box  q\nqueen (\"k\" sound made\nin back of throat)\n d door  r\nrabbit (Rolled \"r\"\nsound, similar to\nSpanish \"r\")\n d\nheavy \"d\" sound\n(Open jaw but keep\nlips slightly round,\ni.e., duh\n sh ship\n ee feet  s sea\n f fish  s \nheavy \"s\" sound.\n(Open jaw but keep\nlips slightly round)\n gh\nthe sound you make\nwhen gargling (Touch\nvery back of tongue to\nvery back of mouth)\n t tan\n h hat  t\nheavy \"t\" sound (Open\njaw but keep lips\nslightly round)\n h\nheavy \"h\" sound\n(Drop back of\ntongue to open back\nof throat, then force\nair out for \"h\")\n th think\n + i ink ` th the\n j jar  th\"th\" sound as in \"the,\"\nbut heavier (Open jaw\nbut keep lips slightly\nround)\n k kit  u put\n kh\ngravely \"h\" sound\n(Touch back of tongue\nto roof of mouth and\nforce air out)\n w water\n l look + /\npronounce the letter\nbefore but cut it short\nby stopping suddenly\n m man  y yarn\n  z zebra\n \nBold letters are silent, i.e., w:\nwrite\n(-) is to make some words easier\nto read\nAbdelaal and Md Rashid 9\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
