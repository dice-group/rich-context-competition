In\nrecent years, \"successful aging\" has. become a famil-\niar term among gerontologists (Abeles, Gift, & Ory,\nHazzard, 1995) and a considerable body of research\nhas accumulated on its characteristics.

In this article\nwe summarize the central findings of that work, pro-\npose a conceptual framework for successful aging,\nand consider some pathways or mechanisms that\nmake for successful old age.\nDefining Successful Aging\nWe define successful aging as including three\nmain components: low probability of disease and\ndisease-related disability, high cognitive and physi-\ncal functional capacity, and active engagement with\nlife. All three terms are relative and the relationship\namong them (as seen in Figure 1) is to some extent\nhierarchical. As the figure indicates, successful\naging is more than absence of disease, important\nthough that is, and more than the maintenance of\nfunctional capacities, important as it is. Both are im-\nportant components of successful aging, but it is\ntheir combination with active engagement with life\nthat represents the concept of successful aging\nmost fully.\nEach of the three components of successful aging\nincludes subparts. Low probability of disease refers\nnot only to absence or presence of disease itself,\nbut also to absence, presence, or severity of risk\nfactors for disease. High functional level includes\nboth physical and cognitive components. Physical\nand cognitive capacities are potentials for activity;\nthey tell us what a person can do, not what he or\nshe does do. Successful aging goes beyond poten-\ntial; it involves activity. While active engagement\nwith life takes many forms, we are most concerned\nwith two -- interpersonal relations and productive\nactivity. Interpersonal relations involve contacts and\ntransactions with others, exchange of information,\nAVOIDING\nDISABILITY\nSUCCESSFUL\nAGING\nENGAGEMENT\nFUNCTION\nFigure 1.

Thus, a person who cares for a\ndisabled family member or works as a volunteer in a\nlocal church or hospital is being productive, al-\nStaying Healthy: Reducing Risk Factors for Disease\nand Disability in Late Life\nThe concept of usual aging as a large subset of\nthose elderly previously considered to be \"normal\"\nfarthest to the right, labeled \"Death,\" displays the\n1980 age-specific mortality experience of the United\nStates. The area to the left of the curve labeled\n\"Disability\" estimates that portion of the population\nwithout disability, and the envelope between the\nDeath and Disability curves denotes the disabled\npopulation. The area to the left of the curve labeled\n\"Disease\" represents the nondiseased, nondisabled\npopulation. The final curve, labeled \"Risk,\" esti-\nmates the portion of the nondiseased population at\nsignificant risk for developing disease. The increas-\ning dominance of this population with advancing\nage reflects emergence of the \"usual aging syn-\ndrome\" associated with risk of chronic disease. The\narea at the extreme left and bottom of the figure in-\ncludes the nondiseased population at lowest risk,\ni.e., those who are aging \"successfully\" with respect\nto risk of emergence of disease. While the death,\ndisability, and disease curves traditionally originate\nat 100%, i.e., with none of the population affected at\nbirth, the risk curve arbitrarily originates at 80% not\ne\nUJ\nUJ\nu\nDC\nUJ\nQ.\nDeath\nDisability\nDisease\nAGE (years)\nFigure 2.

About one third are\nmonozygotic, while two thirds are dizygotic. Com-\nparison of usual aging characteristics in twins of dif-\nfering zygosity and rearing status enables estima-\ntion of the relative contributions of heritable and\nenvironmental influences.\nSATSA-based studies have determined the heri-\ntability coefficients (the proportion of total variance\nattributable to genetic factors) for major risk factors\nfor cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in\nolder persons. These are .66-.70 for body mass\nindex, .28-.78 for individual lipids (total cholesterol,\nlow- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,\napolipoproteins A-1 and B, and triglycerides), .44 for\nsystolic and .34 for diastolic blood pressure (Heller,\ndeFaire, Pedersen, Dahlen, & McClearn, 1993; Hong,\ndeFaire, Heller, McClearn, & Pedersen, 1994;\nStunkard, Harris, Pedersen, & McClearn, 1990).\nHeritability trends across decades of advanced\nage revealed a reduction in the heritability coeffi-\ncients for apolipoprotein B and triglycerides (see\nFigure 3) and for systolic blood pressure (.62 for\nFigure 3. Relative contributions of heredity and environment\nwith advancing age to serum triglycerides in Swedish twins,\nConsistent with these age-related reductions in her-\nitability are mortality data from a 26-year follow-up\nBerkman, Floderus, & deFaire, 1994). Among male\nidentical twins, the risk of death from coronary\nheart disease (CHD) was eightfold greater for those\nwhose twin died before age 55 than for those\nwhose twin did not die before age 55, and among\nmale nonidentical twins the corresponding risk was\nnearly four times greater. When one female identi-\ncal twin died before the age of 65, the risk of death\nfor the other twin was 15 times greater than if one's\ntwin did not die before the age of 65, and 2.6 times\ngreater in the case of female nonidentical twins.\nOverall, the magnitude of the risk associated with\none's twin dying of CHD decreased as the age at\nwhich the twin died increased, independent of gen-\nder and zygosity.\nBeyond twin studies, other evidence indicates the\nimportance of lifestyle factors in the emergence of\nrisk in old age. For instance, advancing age is associ-\nated with progressive impairment in carbohydrate\ntolerance, insufficient to meet diagnostic criteria for\ndiabetes mellitus but characterized by increases in\nbasal and post-glucose challenge levels of blood\nsugar and insulin. The hyperglycemia of aging carries\nincreased risk for coronary heart disease (Donahue,\nAbbott, Reed, & Yano, 1987) and stroke (Abbott,\n1987), with progressive increases in the usual aging\nrange associated with increasing risk. Similarly, the\nhyperinsulinemia associated with aging is an inde-\npendent risk factor for coronary heart disease (Fty-\ndemonstrated that the dominant determinants of this\nrisk are age-related but potentially avoidable factors,\nsuch as the amount and distribution of body fat\n(Elahi, Muller, Tzankoff, Andres, & Tobin, 1982; Kohrt,\nStaten, Kirwan, Wojta, & Holloszy, 1990) and reduced\nphysical activity and dietary factors (Zavaroni et al.,\nSubstantial and growing evidence supports the\ncontention that established risk factors for the\nEvans County blacks (RR = 1.08)\n***...

Relation of level of social integration to age-adjusted\nmortality in five prospective studies, adapted from House, J. et\nemergence of diseases in older populations, such as\ncardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, can be\nsubstantially modified (Hazzard & Bierman, 1990;\nSticht & Hazzard, 1995). In a study demonstrating\nthe modifiability of \"usual aging,\" Katzel and col-\nleagues (Katzel, Bleecker, Colman, Rogus, & Sorkin,\n1995) conducted a randomized, controlled, pro-\nspective trial comparing the effects of a 9-month\ndiet-induced weight loss (approximately 10% of\nbody weight) to the effects of a constant-weight aer-\nobic exercise program and a control program on a\nwell characterized group of middle-aged and older\nmen at risk for cardiovascular disease. The study\nparticipants were nondiabetic and were obese\n(body mass index 30 kg/m2), with increased waist-\nhip ratios and modest increases in blood pressure,\nblood glucose, insulin, and an atherogenic lipid\nprofile. Compared to controls, the reduced-energy\nintake diet resulted in statistically significant reduc-\ntions in weight, waist-hip ratio, fasting and post-\nprandial glucose and insulin levels, blood pressure\nand plasma levels of triglycerides, low-density\nlipoprotein/cholesterol, and increases in high-den-\nsity lipoprotein/cholesterol. While the older weight\nloss subjects (over 60 years old) lost less weight\nthan the middle-aged subjects and had more mod-\nest improvements in carbohydrate tolerance, they\nparticipated fully in the reductions in other risk fac-\ntors. In general, the weight loss intervention had\ngreater effects than the constant-weight aerobic ex-\nercise intervention.\nTaken together, these reports reveal three consis-\ntent findings. First, intrinsic factors alone, while\nhighly significant, do not dominate the determina-\ntion of risk in advancing age. Extrinsic environmen-\ntal factors, including elements of lifestyle, play a\nvery important role in determining risk for disease.\nSecond, with advancing age the relative contribu-\ntion of genetic factors decreases and the force of\nnongenetic factors increases. Third, usual aging\ncharacteristics are modifiable. These findings un-\nderline the importance of environmental and be-\nhavioral factors in determining the risk of disease\nlate in life.\nIntra-lndividual Variability: A Newly Identified\nRisk Factor in Older Persons\nThe traditional repertoire of risk factors identified\nin studies of young and middle-aged populations\nmay not include some additional risk factors unique\nto, or more easily identified in, elderly populations.\nIn this regard, the MacArthur Foundation's Studies\nof Successful Aging point to a previously unrecog-\nnized risk factor -- altered within-individual vari-\nability in physiologic functions -- which may be im-\nportant in determining the usual aging syndrome.\nMost gerontological research, and indeed re-\nsearch in all age groups, is not geared to the mea-\nsurement of short-term variations and changes.\nStudy designs generally focus on the absolute level\nof a variable, perhaps comparing levels at two or\nmore time points that may be separated by months\nor years. Nesselroade and colleagues (Kim, Nessel-\nroade, & Featherman, 1996), reasoned that short-\nterm variability in a number of physiological or per-\nhaps psychological characteristics might reflect a\nloss of underlying physiological reserve and repre-\nsent a risk factor for emergence of disease or dis-\nability. To study the impact of short-term variability,\nthey examined between-person differences in simi-\nlarly aged residents of a retirement community.\nThey assessed various aspects of biomedical, cogni-\ntive, and physical functioning every week for 25\nweeks in a group of 31 individuals and a matched\ngroup of 30 assessed only at the outset and the end\nof the 25-week period, and they followed the sub-\njects for several years to ascertain the relationship\nbetween within-person variability and its risk.\nWithin-person variability of a joint index of physi-\ncal performance and physiological measures (gait,\nbalance, and blood pressure) was an excellent pre-\ndictor of mortality five years later (R = 0.70, R2 =\n0.49). Variability of the composite measure was a\nbetter predictor of mortality than mean level, which\ndid not represent a statistically significant risk factor\n(Nesselroade, Featherman, Agen, & Rowe, 1996). A\nsimilar pattern of findings held for the psychologi-\ncal attributes of perceived control and efficacy, for\nwhich average level was not a significant predictor\nof mortality but intra-individual variability scores\npredicted 30% of the variance in mortality (Eizen-\nman, Nesselroade, Featherman, & Rowe, in press).\nIt should be emphasized that some functions are\nhighly variable under normal conditions and others\nmuch less so. The significant aspect of intra-individ-\nual variability as a potential measure of decreased\ncapacity and increased risk must be a change from\nthe normal variability, regardless of whether the\nchange is an increase or decrease. For example, a\ndecline in beat-to-beat variability in heart rate has\nbeen shown to be a predictor of mortality in patients\nwho have previously suffered a myocardial infarc-\ntion. While in the physiological measurement used\nin this study, an increase in variability was associated\nwith increased risk; in other highly regulated sys-\ntems, a decrease in variability may be detrimental\nand represent decreased reserve and increased risk.\nMaximizing Cognitive and Physical Function\nin Late Life\nA second essential component of successful\naging is maximization of functional status. One\ncommon concern of older people relates to cogni-\ntive function, especially learning and short-term\nmemory. Another functional area of major interest\nis physical performance. Modest reductions in the\ncapacity to easily perform common physical func-\ntions may prevent full participation in productive\nand recreational activities of daily life.\nThe MacArthur Foundation Research Network on\nSuccessful Aging conducted a longitudinal study of\nolder persons to identify those physical, psycholog-\nical, social, and biomedical characteristics predic-\ntive of the maintenance of high function in late life.\nThe 1,189 subjects in this three-site longitudinal\nstudy were 70-79 years old at initial evaluation and\nwere functionally in the upper one third of the gen-\neral aging population. Smaller age- and sex-\nmatched samples (80 subjects in the medium func-\ntioning group and 82 subjects in the low functioning\ngroup) were selected to represent the middle and\nlowest tertiles. Initial data included detailed assess-\nments of physical and cognitive performance,\nhealth status, and social and psychological charac-\nteristics (the MacArthur battery), as well as the col-\nlection of blood and urine samples. After a 2.0-2.5\nyear interval, 1,115 subjects were re-evaluated, pro-\nviding a 91% follow-up rate for the study.\nPredictors of Cognitive Function\nCognitive ability was assessed with neuropsycho-\nlogical tests of language, nonverbal memory, verbal\nmemory, conceptualization, and visual spatial abil-\nity. In the initially high functioning group, four\nvariables -- education, strenuous activity in and\naround the home, peak pulmonary flow rate, and\nself-efficacy -- were found to be direct predictors\nof change or maintenance of cognitive function, to-\ngether explaining 40% of the variance in cognitive\ntest performance. Education was the strongest pre-\ndictor, with greater years of schooling increasing\nthe likelihood of maintaining high cognitive func-\ntion (Albert et al., 1995). This finding is consistent\nwith several cross-sectional studies, which identify\neducation as a major protective factor against re-\nductions in cognitive function. Since all the subjects\nhad high cognitive function at first evaluation, it is\nunlikely that the observed effect merely reflected\nability to perform well on cognitive tests or was the\nresult of individuals with greater innate intelligence\nhaving received more education. Instead, the re-\nsults suggest either or both of two explanatory\nmechanisms: a direct beneficial effect of education\nearly in life on brain circuitry and function, and the\npossibility that education is a proxy for life-long in-\ntellectual activities (reading, crossword puzzles,\netc.) which might serve to maintain cognitive func-\ntion late in life.\nPulmonary peak expiratory flow rate was the sec-\nond strongest predictor of maintenance of cogni-\ntive function. In previous studies, this function was\na predictor of total and cardiovascular mortality and\na correlate of cognitive and physical function in el-\nA surprising finding of this study was that the\namount of strenuous physical activity at and around\nthe home was an important predictor of maintain-\ning cognitive function. In a follow-up study to eval-\nuate a possible mechanism of this effect, Neeper,\nGomez-Pinilla, Choi, and Cotman (1995) measured\nthe effect of exercise on central nervous system lev-\nels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in\nadult rats. These investigators found that increasing\nexercise was associated with very substantial \"dose-\nrelated\" increases in BDNF in the hippocampus and\nneocortex, brain areas known to be highly respon-\nsive to environmental stimuli. These data provide a\npotential mechanism whereby exercise might en-\nhance central nervous system function, particularly\nmemory function.\nA personality measure, perceived self-efficacy, was\nalso predictive of maintaining cognitive function in\nold age. The concept of self-efficacy developed by\nBandura is defined as \"people's beliefs in their capa-\nbilities to organize and execute the courses of action\nrequired to deal with prospective situations\" (Ban-\ndura, 1995). In students and young adults, self-effi-\ncacy influences persistence in solving cognitive\nproblems (Brown & Inouye, 1978), heart rate during\nperformance of cognitive tasks (Bandura, Cioffi, Tay-\nlor, & Brouillard, 1988), mathematical performance\n(Collins, 1982), and mastery of computer software\nprocedures (Cist, Schwoerer, & Rosen, 1989). Lach-\nman and colleagues have proposed a role for self-ef-\nficacy beliefs in maintenance of cognitive function\namong older people (Lachman, & Leff, 1989; Lach-\nman, Weaver, Bandura, Elliott, & Lewkowicz, 1992).\nIn addition to these findings of predictors of main-\ntenance of cognitive function, evidence is accumulat-\ning to indicate that it can be enhanced in old age. For\nexample, older people who showed a clear age-\nrelated pattern of decline in fluid intelligence (induc-\ntive reasoning and spatial orientation) showed sub-\nstantial improvement after five training sessions that\nstressed ways of approaching such problems and\nprovided practice in solving them (Schaie & Willis,\n1986). Moreover, repeated measurement indicated\nthat the improvements were maintained. Studies\nfrom the Max Planck Institute in Berlin confirm the\nfinding that cognitive losses among healthy older\npeople are reversible by means of training, although\nthey also show a substantial age-related training ef-\nfect in favor of younger subjects (Kliegl, Smith, &\nBaltes, 1989). There is a double message in these\nfindings: first, and most important, the capacity for\npositive change, sometimes called plasticity, persists\nin old age; appropriate interventions can often bring\nolder people back to (or above) some earlier level of\nfunction. Second, the same interventions may be still\nmore effective with younger subjects, which sug-\ngests an age-related reduction in reserve functional\ncapacity. These demonstrations of plasticity in old\nage are encouraging in their own right and tell us\nthat positive change is possible.\nPredictors of Physical Function\nIn the MacArthur studies, maintenance of high\nphysical performance, including hand, trunk, and\nlower extremity movements and integrated move-\nments of balance and gait, was predicted by both\nsocio-demographic and health status characteristics.\nBeing older and having an income of less than\n$10,000 a year increased the likelihood of a decline\nin physical performance, as did higher body mass\nindex (greater fat), high blood pressure, and lower\ninitial cognitive performance. Behavioral predictors\nof maintenance of physical function included mod-\nerate and/or strenuous leisure activity and emo-\ntional support from family and friends. Moderate\nlevels of exercise activity (e.g., walking leisurely) ap-\npeared in these studies to convey similar advantages\nto more strenuous exercise (e.g., brisk walking).\nContinuing Engagement with Life\nThe third component of successful aging, engage-\nment with life, has two major elements: mainte-\nnance of interpersonal relations and of productive\nactivities.\nSocial Relations\nAt least since Durkheim's classic study of suicide\n(Durkheim, 1951), isolation and lack of connected-\nness to others have been recognized as predictors\nof morbidity and mortality. Five prospective studies\nof substantial populations have now demonstrated\ncausality throughout the life course in such associa-\ntions: being part of a social network is a significant\ndeterminant of longevity, especially for men (see\nResearch on the health protective aspect of net-\nwork membership has emphasized two kinds of\nsupportive transactions: socio-emotional (expres-\nsions of affection, respect and the like) and instru-\nmental (direct assistance, such as giving physical\nhelp, doing chores, providing transportation, or giv-\nThe three-community MacArthur study tested\nboth instrumental and emotional support as predic-\ntors of neuroendocrine function and physical per-\nformance. Neuroendocrine measures were also\nstudied as possible mediators of the effects of sup-\nport. Over a three-year period, marital status (being\nmarried), presumably a source of emotional sup-\nport, protected against reduction in productive ac-\ntivity (Glass, Seeman, Herzog, Kahn, & Berkman,\n1995). Men with higher emotional support had sig-\nnificantly lower urine excretion of norepinephrine,\nepinephrine, and cortisol, and for both men and\nwomen, emotional support was a positive predictor\nof physical performance. Instrumental support, on\nthe other hand, had few significant neuroendocrine\nrelations for men, none for women, and was associ-\nated with lower physical performance, probably as\nan effect rather than a cause (Seeman, Berkman,\nBlazer, & Rowe, 1994; Seeman, Berkman, Charpen-\nThese varying effects of social support are consis-\ntent with research relating the effect of support to\nthe specific situation in which it is offered. For ex-\nample, instrumental support rather than emotional\nsupport influenced the promptness with which\nolder people who experienced cancer-suspicious\nsymptoms actually saw a physician (Antonucci,\nKahn, & Akiyama, 1989). Opposite results came from\na nursing home experiment, however: socio-emo-\ntional support (verbal encouragement) had positive\nperformance effects, whereas instrumental support\n(direct assistance) had negative effects on perfor-\nSeveral conclusions seem warranted regarding\nthe properties of social relations and their effects:\na. Isolation (lack of social ties), is a risk factor for\nhealth.\nb. Social support, both emotional and instrumen-\ntal, can have positive health-relevant effects.\nc. No single type of support is uniformly effective;\neffectiveness depends on the appropriateness\nof the supportive acts to the requirements of\nthe situation and the person.\nProductive Activities\nOlder people are not considered \"old\" by their\nfamilies and friends, nor do they think of themselves\nas \"old,\" so long as they remain active and produc-\ntive in some meaningful sense (Kaufman, 1986). In\nlegislative policy, Congressional discussion as to\nwhether the nation can \"afford\" its older people is as\nmuch a debate about their productivity as their re-\nquirements for service, especially medical care.\nPart of the confusion stems from lack of clarity\nabout what constitutes a productive activity. Our\nnational statistics define Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP) in terms of activities that are paid for, and ex-\nclude all unpaid activities, however valuable. Sev-\neral current studies (ACL, MacArthur, HRS) utilize a\nbroader definition that includes all activities, paid or\nunpaid, that create goods or services of economic\nvalue (Kahn, 1986), and these studies have gener-\nated age-related patterns very different from those\nfor paid employment alone (Herzog, Antonucci,\nJackson, Kahn, & Morgan, 1987; Herzog, Kahn, Mor-\nThe nationwide Americans Changing Lives (ACL)\nstudy found that, contrary to the stereotype of un-\nproductive old age, most older people make pro-\nductive contributions of some kind, more as infor-\nmal help-giving and unpaid volunteer work than\npaid employment. When all forms of productive ac-\ntivity are combined, the amount of work done by\nolder men and women is substantial. Among those\nof productive activity during the preceding year;\n1-499 hours. The relationship between age and pro-\nductive activity depends on the activity. While\nhours of paid work drop sharply after age 55, hours\nof volunteer work in organizations peak in the mid-\ndle years (ages 35-55), and informal help to friends\nand relatives peaks still later (ages 55-64) and re-\nmains significant to age 75 and beyond.\nBoth the ACL and MacArthur studies address the\nquestion of what factors enable sustained produc-\ntivity in old age. Both include longitudinal as well as\ncross-sectional data, and in some respects the stud-\nies are complementary -- national representative-\nness over the full adult age range in the ACL survey,\nbiomedical and performance measures as well as\nself-report in the MacArthur research. Three factors\nemerge as predictors of productive activity: func-\ntional capacity, education, and self-efficacy.\nFunctional Capacity. -- Men and women high in\ncognitive and physical function are three times as\nlikely to be doing some paid work and more than\ntwice as likely to be doing volunteer work. More-\nover, for all forms of productive work except child\ncare, functional status also predicts the amount of\nsuch work. Indicators of functional decrement, such\nas limitations with vision and number of bed days\nduring the three months preceding the data collec-\ntion, predict lesser productive activity.\nEducation. -- Educational level is a well established\npredictor of sustained productive behavior, paid and\nHarris & Associates, 1981; Herzog, Franks, Markus, &\neffect include the role of education as a major deter-\nminant of occupation and income, both of which are\nmajor influences on the life course, the selective pro-\ncess in education that probably includes genetic\nelements and certainly includes parental socioeco-\nnomic status, and the tendency of education to incul-\ncate values and establish habits that express them-\nselves in later life as higher functional status and\nengagement in productive behavior.\nSelf-Efficacy. -- Self-efficacy and the related con-\ncepts of mastery and control are consistent predic-\ntors of sustained activity in old age. The ACL study,\nin addition to identifying a positive relationship be-\ntween self-efficacy and productive activity, found\nthat two other variables, labeled vulnerability and\nfatalism, essentially inversions of self-efficacy, were\nnegatively related to productivity. Consistent with\nthese findings, in the MacArthur sample only one\nfactor -- mastery -- emerged as relevant for both\nincreases and decreases in productivity; increases\nin mastery led to increased productivity; decreases\nin mastery had the opposite effect.\nResponse to Stress\nIf we had continuous rather than occasional mea-\nsurement of successful aging, we would expect to\nfind that even older people who are aging success-\nfully have not met the criteria at every moment in\nthe past. They have moved \"in and out of success/'\njust as healthy people can be said to move in and\nout of illness. Under the most fortunate circum-\nstances, aging brings with it some repetitive experi-\nence of chronic or recurrent stresses, the \"daily\nhassles\" of life (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) and their\ncumulative effects. Most older people have also ex-\nperienced more acute episodes, the \"stressful life\nevents\" that have been much-studied (Dohrenwend\nample, older men and women may have been seri-\nously ill, temporarily disabled by accident or injury,\ndisoriented after a stroke, or depressed by the\ndeath of a spouse. Apart from such crises of illness\nand bereavement, but similarly stressful, are the ex-\nperiences of forced retirement, sudden reduction\nin income, mugging, and burglary.\nWe propose the concept of resilience to describe\nthe rapidity and completeness with which people\nrecover from such episodes and return to meeting\nthe criteria of success. Determination of resilience\nin dealing with a specific stressful event would re-\nquire assessment of relevant functions before the\nstressing challenge is encountered and subsequent\nmonitoring to observe the initial decremental ef-\nfect, the time required to regain stability of func-\ntion, and the level of function regained. While no\nresearch has yet robustly evaluated resilience, a\nnumber of studies are relevant to it. The work by\nNesselroade and his colleagues, described earlier,\ndemonstrated the importance of short term variabil-\nity in physical function and blood pressure as a pre-\ndictor of mortality among elderly subjects. We may\ninterpret low variability in blood pressure as an in-\ndicator of resilience, but the interpretation must be\ntentative; we do not know the challenges or stres-\nsors to which these subjects were responding.\nConclusion\nRecent and projected substantial increases in the\nrelative and absolute number of older persons in our\nsociety pose a significant challenge for biology, social\nand behavioral science, and medicine. Gerontology is\nbroadening its perspective from a prior preoccupa-\ntion with disease and disability to a more robust view\nthat includes successful aging. As conceptual and em-\npiric research in this area accelerates, successful\naging is seen as multidimensional, encompassing\nthree distinct domains: avoidance of disease and dis-\nability, maintenance of high physical and cognitive\nfunction, and sustained engagement in social and\nproductive activities. For each of these domains, an\ninterdisciplinary database is coalescing that relates to\nboth reducing the risk of adverse events and enhanc-\ning resilience in their presence. Many of the predic-\ntors of risk and of both functional and activity levels\nappear to be potentially modifiable, either by individ-\nuals or by changes in their immediate environments.\nThe stage is thus set for intervention studies to iden-\ntify effective strategies that enhance the proportion\nof our older population that ages successfully.\nReferences\nAbbott, R.
