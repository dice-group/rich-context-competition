This will raise regulatory capital\nrequirements for higher risk asset classes, which include the emerging markets. Higher\nregulatory capital has an impact on lending flows only if regulatory capital requirements\nbecome binding. In other words, if banks have already calculated economic capital based\non similar risk models in the past and these remain binding no further change should occur.\nThis paper tests these two interlinked hypothesis. We expect that lending patterns will\nremain unchanged if:\n(1) regulatory capital requirements remain below the economic capital and\n(2) banks' lending is already based on risk modelling.\nTo test the first hypothesis we calculate the economic capital of the foreign portfolio of\nGerman banks as unexpected loss using a Value at Risk model. We find that economic\ncapital seems to be binding.\nThe second condition is tested by estimating the influence of unexpected loss in explaining\nlending to emerging markets. We find that unexpected loss is a significant determinant of\nthe banks' loan decisions, in particular for Large Banks as well as Landesbanken and in\nrecent years also for other banking groups. Thus, it appears that risk modelling has already\nguided lending decisions.\nOverall, the evidence from both tests points in the same direction and we conclude that the\nnew Basel Accord should have a limited effect on lending to emerging markets.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nMit Inkrafttreten der neuen Baseler Eigenmittelvereinbarung (Basel II) werden sich die\nregulatorischen Eigenkapitalanforderungen, die an eine Bank gestellt werden, an den\nKreditrisiken des Portfolios orientieren. Als Konsequenz werden die regulatorischen\nEigenkapitalanforderungen f\u00fcr Kredite mit hohen Risiken, z. B. Kredite an\nSchwellenl\u00e4nder, steigen. Ob diese Erh\u00f6hung eine Reduktion der Kreditvergabe zur Folge\nhaben wird, h\u00e4ngt davon ab, ob die neuen Anforderungen bindend sein werden. Keine\n\u00c4nderungen in der Kreditvergabe sind zu erwarten, wenn Banken das \u00f6konomische\nKapital bereits in der Vergangenheit auf der Grundlage \u00e4hnlicher Modelle berechnet haben\nund das \u00f6konomische Kapital auch nach der neuen Regelung bindend bleibt. Im\nvorliegenden Diskussionspapier werden die Ergebnisse aus einem Test beider miteinander\nverbundenen Hypothesen pr\u00e4sentiert. Wir erwarten keine Ver\u00e4nderung in der\nKreditvergabe, sofern\n(1) das regulatorische Eigenkapital kleiner ist als das \u00f6konomische Kapital der Banken\n(2) und Banken die Kreditvergabe bereits auf der Basis von Risikomodellen steuern.\nDie erste Bedingung wird getestet, indem das \u00f6konomische Kapital f\u00fcr die Auslandsport-\nfolien der deutscher Banken als unerwarteter Verlust anhand eines Value-at-Risk-Modells\nberechnet und anschlie\u00dfend mit dem regulatorischen Eigenkapital verglichen wird.

The\nnew Accord will increase regulatory capital for lower rating classes and, as a consequence,\nmany observers feared that bank lending to emerging markets would decline.1 The aim of\nthis paper is to investigate this claim bringing to bear a new and comprehensive dataset of\nGerman bank lending.\nAt the outset it is worth mentioning that the series of revisions of the new Accord have\nalready contributed to dampening fears of a large impact on lending to high risk lenders.\nAfter the first consultative proposals for Basel II were released in June 1999 and January\n2001 the Committee received a large number of responses.2 Concerns about a negative\nimpact on lending to lower rating categories, a characteristic shared by most small and\nmedium sized firms and emerging markets, lead to a reduction of these risk weights in the\nsubsequent revisions.3 Nevertheless, the third Quantitative Impact Study 3 (QIS 3)4\nrevealed that capital requirements for sovereign exposures will still rise by 28 per cent\nunder the Advanced IRB5 and 47 per cent under the Foundation IRB for Group 1 banks.6\n# The authors would like to thank Dirk Tasche and the participants of a seminar at the Deutsche Bundesbank\nfor helpful comments. Many thanks also to Heinz-Michael Ritter and Bjoern Wehlert for support with the\ndatabase for German foreign claims.\n4 During the development of the new capital framework, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\ncarried out a number of impact studies to assess the effect that it would have on banks' minimum capital. The\ncountries.\n5 The Committee proposes to permit banks a choice between two broad methodologies for calculating their\ncapital requirements for credit risk. One alternative will be to measure credit risk in a standardised manner.\nUnder the other alternative, banks that have received supervisory approval to use the Internal Ratings-Based\nApproach (IRB) may rely on their own internal estimates of risk components in determining the capital\nrequirements. For many asset classes, the Committee has made available two approaches within the IRB\nframework: a foundation and an advanced approach. Under the foundation approach, as a general rule, banks\nprovide their own estimates of probability of default (PD) and rely on supervisory estimates for other risk\ncomponents. Under the advanced approach, banks provide their own estimates of PD, loss given default\nGiven the prominent role of Group 1 banks in lending to emerging markets, this rise in\nrequirements might potentially lead to large adjustments in international bank lending to\nemerging markets.\nFurthermore, even in the absence of large changes in capital costs, Basel II might have a\nsignificant impact on bank lending flows since small spread changes may induce large\nportfolio reallocations. And, in a market characterised by credit rationing, spread increases\nmay lead to the exclusion of borrowers.7\nFewer possibilities for regulatory arbitrage might lead to shifts in the pattern of flows to\nemerging markets. The simple categorisation under Basel I gave banks leeway for capital\narbitrage by choosing higher-risk assets within a given risk category.8 In particular, the\nOECD/non-OECD distinction in principle allowed banks to hold risky assets (e.g. Mexico)\nwithout commensurate capital. The lower risk weight for short-term lending may have\ncontributed to large inflows of short-term capital before the Asian crisis.9\nThe existing literature initially predicted very large effects of Basel II on emerging markets\nspreads (see Reisen (2001), Griffith-Jones (2003)). However, this result was mainly due to\na somewhat unrealistic assumption about required rates of return for high-risk assets.\nUsing a more realistic assumption of a hurdle rate for risk adjusted returns Powell (2002)\nand Weder and Wedow (2002) find much smaller changes in credit spreads.\nHowever, the critical questions in assessing the impact of Basel II is the relationship\nbetween regulatory and economic capital and which of them is the binding constraint. In\nthis paper we test these two interlinked hypothesis: Is economic or regulatory capital the\nbinding constraint? And: have banks already based credit decisions according to economic\ncapital in the past? To the extent that the new Accord succeeds in aligning regulatory\ncapital requirements with economic capital, which are based on modern risk management\ntechniques, it should have no impact on credit decisions of banks already using these\n(LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and their own calculation of maturity (M), subject to meeting minimum\nstandards.\n6 Basel Committe on Banking Supervision (2003b), in the QIS 3 banks have been split into two groups \u00ad\nGroup 1 banks are large, diversified and internationally active with Tier 1 capital in excess of EUR 3bn, and\nGroup 2 banks are generally smaller and, in many cases, more specialised.\nWeder and Wedow (2002) address this question by computing a measure of economic\ncapital and testing its' influence on lending flows of BIS reporting banks. The advantage of\nthat approach is that it included most lenders, however, this comes at the cost of an\nextremely aggregate perspective.\nIn this paper we adopt a micro view, which allows us to control for individual bank and\ngroup characteristics. We compute bank level measures of economic and regulatory capital\nfor a sample covering roughly 95% of total foreign lending by German banks. The data set\nhas recently been compiled at the Deutsche Bundesbank and includes about 50 banks and\nforeign lending. To quantify the risk positions in German banks' foreign lending we\ncalculate unexpected loss using a Value at Risk model.11 This measure is then tested in a\ndynamic panel model on the determinants of lending to emerging markets.\nWe find that Basel II regulatory capital would not have been binding in the past, which is a\nprerequisite for the hypothesis of the neutrality of Basel II. Our results also support the\nhypothesis that banks already base their lending decisions on credit risk models if we\nrestrict our sample to the more recent period and to Large Banks and Landesbanken. Given\nthat these banks provide the lion's share of bank lending to emerging markets, and more\nbanks are in the process of adopting modern risk management techniques, we conclude that\nby the time Basel II will be adopted (year-end 2006) it will have only a negligible effect on\nGerman banks' loans to emerging markets.\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the model of bank\nlending and the empirical strategy. Section 3 describes the data set, section 4 presents the\nresults. Section 5 concludes.\n2 How do capital requirements impact on bank lending flows?\nOur approach to estimating the impact of Basel II on banks' lending to emerging markets\nis to model banks' lending decisions. For this purpose we need to establish a model of\ninternational bank lending. Most of the existing literature on international capital flows has\ntaken a macroeconomic approach, focusing on push and pull factors as determinants of\n11 We adopt a credit portfolio model following CreditMetrics, see J.P Morgan (1997).\ncapital flows.12 Thus these studies use aggregated data by creditor country and do not\npermit a detailed analysis of individual bank behaviour. One exception, Goldberg (2001),\nuses bank-level data for lending to emerging markets but likewise focuses on\nmacroeconomic push and pull determinants of capital flows. In contrast, our aim is to\nmodel and test individual bank behaviour and therefore we propose a microeconomic\napproach, using bank-level data for the determinants of lending flows. An advantage of\nstudying the effects of capital regulation at the individual bank level is that it permits\ndifferentiation between size and ownership structure.\nIn what follows, we focus on the supply side of the international credit market based on the\nassumption that emerging countries are mostly constrained by the supply side.13 This\nimplies that demand should have only a limited role on flows14 and that bank lending can\nbe modelled by a loan offer curve. We use a general loan offer curve by which credit\ndecisions depend on the expected yield over a minimum margin. The minimum margin is\nthe total sum of all costs that a loan causes for a bank. Consequently, credits which are\npriced below the minimum margin are not profitable and will thus not be supplied. The\ncomponents of the minimum margin are the risk-free interest rate, handling charges, the\nexpected loss of the loan, and opportunity costs for the capital allocation associated with\nthe loan. The opportunity costs for the capital allocation refer to regulatory capital if the\nregulatory capital requirements are binding. Otherwise they refer to economic capital\nwhich usually is measured with the unexpected loss. Accordingly the loan supply function\nis:\n( , , , )\nib ib ib ib ib\n= if RCCib\n ULib\n( , , , )\nib ib ib ib ib\n= if RCCib\n> ULib\nwhere Lib\nis the amount of credit supplied by bank b to borrower i. R is the risk-free\ninterest rate which is equal for all banks, Hib\nare bank and country specific handling\ncharges and ELib\nis the expected loss of a loan to country i. ULib\nis the unexpected loss for a\nloan to country i. It is also called marginal risk contribution. Finally, RCCib\nare regulatory\ncapital requirements, alternatively under Basel I (RCC_Iib\n) or under Basel II (RCC_IIib\n).\n12 Jeanneau and Micu (2002) give an overview of this literature.\nFrom (1) and (2) it is apparent that regulatory capital requirements will drive banking\nbehaviour only if they exceed economic capital. This means that the increase of capital\ncosts predicted in the context of Basel II will not be relevant for bank lending to emerging\nmarkets, provided that they remain below the unexpected loss. It is the explicit intention of\nthe Basel Committee to bring regulatory capital into line with economic capital from\nbelow, and not to top it. Hence, if the Basel Accord achieves its purpose, our model\npredicts that bank lending to emerging countries on average will be unaffected by Basel II.\nAlthough (1) and (2) constitute a quite general model, there may be some practical\nproblems related notably to the calculation of economic capital. The methods used to\ncalculate unexpected loss are rather complex, and therefore it is not certain whether it is\ncommon business practice to measure economic capital by means of the unexpected loss.\nAlternatively, banks could proxy economic capital by regulatory capital. If so, according to\n(1) and (2), banks' lending to emerging economies will decline irrespective of the amount\nof unexpected loss, simply because under Basel II the regulatory costs for loans to risky\ncountries will rise. Capital arbitrage considerations may also pose a problem in this set-up.\nBanks may simply base their decision to lend on regulatory capital whenever it falls below\neconomic capital. As a consequence, Basel II would have an impact on lending to countries\nwhich see their regulatory capital requirements rise compared with their current treatment.\nConsequently, Basel II will not affect banks' lending if economic capital exceeds\nregulatory capital (under Basel I and Basel II) and, additionally, if the banks consider the\nunexpected loss in their lending decisions.\nThe condition that economic capital exceeds regulatory capital can be formulated as a test,\neither separately for each country i,\n: ULi\n: ULi\n< RCC_IIi ,\nwith\n=\nT\nB\nibt\nB\nb t\nb\nb\nUL\nT = =\n=\n\u00e5\u00e5\n\u00e5\nand RCC_IIi\n=\n_\nb\nT\nB\nibt\nB\nb t\nb\nb\nT = =\n=\n\u00e5\u00e5\n\u00e5\n,\nwhere B is the total number of banks in our sample and Tb\nis the number of time periods\nthat are available for bank b. Alternatively the hypothesis can be tested on the aggregate:\n: UL  RCC_II, H1\n: UL < RCC_II, (4)\nwith\nUL =\nT\nibt\ni b t\nbi\ni b\nUL\nT = = =\n= =\n\u00e5\u00e5\u00e5\n\u00e5\u00e5\nand RCC_II =\n_\nb\nT\nibt\ni b t\nbi\ni b\nT = = =\n= =\n\u00e5\u00e5\u00e5\n\u00e5\u00e5\n,\nwhere I is the total number of countries.\nThe assumption that banks measure economic capital by means of unexpected loss when\ncalculating their minimum margins will be tested in a panel regression framework.\nFollowing equations (1) and (2) and the assumption that bank lending to emerging markets\nis constrained by the supply side, we model credit flows as follows:\nLibt\nRt\nELit\nULibt\n+\n,\nn\nj j ibt\nj\nZ\n\n=\n\u00e5 + \u00b5ib\n+ ibt\nwhere Libt\nis the first difference of credit supplied by bank b to borrower i in period t, and\nZj,ibt\nis a set of control variables which in our case are the first two lags of the stock of bank\nlending, time dummies and dummies for large banks and Landesbanken. ibt\nis iid with\nmean zero and constant variance and \u00b5ib\nis not correlated with the other right-hand\nvariables. The individual effect \u00b5ib\ncaptures unobservables at the bank level such as\nhandling charges, but also time-invariant characteristics that may drive credit to foreign\ncountries, such as cultural affinity or geographical distance.15 If banks incorporate\nunexpected loss in their decisions, we would expect that the estimation of (5) results in a\ncoefficient for 3\nwhich is significantly negative.\n15 There are three possible panel dimensions available in the present data set: time, banks and countries. Out\nof the latter two we created a new bank-country dimension which allows us to combine both dimensions and\nto capture the specific lending relation within the individual effect \u00b5ib.\n16 See appendix for the sources of the data.\n17 See Nestmann et. al. (2003) for a detailed description of the data set. The concept of credit exposure\napplied by the credit register is regulated in section 19 of the Fifth Act amending the Banking Act, which has\nbeen in force since the end of 1995. Accordingly, foreign country exposure covers on-balance sheet and off-\nbalance sheet positions. Off-balance sheet items include derivatives (other than written option positions),\nguarantees assumed in respect thereof, and other off-balance sheet transactions. The following items are\ndeemed not to be exposures according to section 20 (6) of the Banking Act: shares in other enterprises,\nirrespective of how they are shown in the balance sheet, and securities in the trading portfolio. Additionally,\nexposures to German public authorities (central, state and local government) and exposures to the European\nCommunities are not reported. The credit risk with respect to the off-balance sheet items such as swaps,\noptions and futures is captured by using the credit equivalent amount measured by the marking-to-market\nmethod. Thus, the creditor does not carry the full risk for the principal amount but only for the replacement\ncosts.\n18 Banks included under \"other banks\" consist mainly of private banks. They do not dominate the sample\nsince these banks maintain exposures to a relatively small number of countries.\n19 The information on the currency composition of German bank lending was obtained from the\nBundesbank's External Economics division. Flows were consistently corrected for Euro-US$ exchange rate\nfluctuations. The procedure for exchange adjustments is as follows. First, stock data are converted from\nDeutsche Mark into Euro to obtain a consistent series in Euro for the whole period. In a second step the\nrespective shares for bank claims in Euro, US dollar and other currencies are obtained. We then convert the\n3 Empirical Strategy and Data\nIn order to test (3) and (4) and estimate (5) we have to deal with the fact that most of the\nvariables involved cannot be observed directly. The exception is the risk-free interest rate,\nwhich we measure by the German capital market interest rate.16 In the following we\ndescribe how we estimate credit flows (L), and proxies for the regulatory capital (RCC),\nthe expected loss (EL) and the marginal risk contribution (UL).\n3.1 Estimating credit flows\nWe calculate Libt\nfrom the Deutsche Bundesbank's credit register. The credit register\nreports loans of 1.5 million Euro (formerly 3 million Deutsche Mark) or more at a\nquarterly frequency.17 Since the raw data are not consolidated at banking group level and\nbecause of various structural changes, we restrict the sample to large banks (all big banks,\nLandesbanken and a large number of private banks) and the time period 1996Q3 to\n2002Q2. Our sample provides on average 95% of German banks' total foreign lending\nover the time period. Table A1 in the appendix provides a list of the number of banks used\nData for Libt\ncan be obtained by taking first-order differences of the credit stock data.\nSince changes in stocks can be attributed to credit flows as well as to currency changes, we\ncorrected the stocks for currency fluctuations before taking differences.19\n3.2 Estimating the regulatory capital\nThe regulatory capital costs under Basel I are based on the criterion of OECD membership.\nTherefore, in our regression framework, RCC_Iib\nis a dummy-variable with the value one if\nthe country is a member of the OECD and zero otherwise.\nis calculated according to the Basel II foundation internal ratings based (IRB)\ncalibration as formulated in the fourth consultative paper. 20 It is expected that many of the\nGerman banks will use the foundation IRB approach once Basel II is implemented. For this\nreason we concentrate on this approach and neglect the alternatives (standardised or\nadvanced IRB methods). We use Standard & Poor's (S&P) sovereign ratings as proxies for\nbanks' internal ratings and match them with the corresponding probabilities of default for\ncorporates. The literature has argued that the rating criteria of German banks for sovereigns\nare very similar to those used by the international rating agencies.21 Therefore, S&P ratings\nshould be a close proxy for banks' internal ratings of public creditors. Due to a lack of data\nwe use sovereign ratings for the private sector, too. In this case sovereign ratings can be\nregarded as an upper limit for the true ratings of the private sector.22 The regulatory capital\ncharge is then obtained by applying the probability of default to the Basel II formula. Since\nno information on the respective maturity or loss given default rate (LGD) is available, we\nuse benchmark values with a maturity of 2.5 years and an LGD of 45%.\n3.3 Estimating the expected loss\nExpected loss ELit\nis measured by an index based on the S&P ratings described in the\nprevious section. The rating should reflect the expected loss of the exposure for a given\nloss given default and thus be closely related to the risk spread of a given borrower. Cantor\nand Packer (1996) were the first to propose a numerical rating score. In their paper, ratings\nwere assigned a score from 1 for AAA to 20 for a selective default. Since then a number of\nUS dollar share (still denominated in Euro) back into US dollar at the respective end-of-quarter exchange rate\n(et\n) before applying the exchange rate of the previous period (et-1\n) to obtain the US dollar share again in Euro\nand free of exchange rate movements between the two periods. While we recognise that Euro exchange rates\nagainst other currencies may be relevant, it should be noted that exposures in Euro and US$ are predominant\nfor German bank lending (see Nestmann et. al. 2003). Additionally, regressions on the flows without\ncurrency corrections did not exhibit any different results.\n20 The revision of the risk weight function focusing on unexpected loss only has been taken into account (see\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2004a).\n21 Krahnen (2000), see Brunner et. al. (2000) for a discussion of internal rating procedures of German banks;\nthe difference between banks' and rating agencies' ratings should lie in the soft information internal to banks\nacquired through banks' relationship with borrowers.\n22 To obtain an idea of the possible bias arising in this context we also performed separate estimations for the\npublic sector, but the results did not differ.\nstudies have followed and extended their proposal. For example, Bartholdy and Lekka\n(2002) additionally include rating outlooks and thus achieve an even finer distinction of\nrisks. In their approach each rating is assigned a score Sit\nranging from 1 for an AAA rating\nto 58 for a selective default. Further, they applied a logit-type transformation of the rating\nscore:\nln\nit\nit\nit\nS\nS\nS\n\u00ec \u00fc\n= \u00ed \u00fd\n-\n\u00ee \u00fe\n .\nWe extended their approach by additionally taking Credit-Watches into account.23\nConsequently, a rating change should be more imminent when a rating is under credit\nwatch than under a rating outlook. For this reason, we attempt to take this additional\ninformation into account by adding (subtracting) a 2 to a given rating score when a rating\nis under positive (negative) credit watch, while only a 1 is added (subtracted) when a\npositive (negative) outlook is assigned to a given rating. As a result, the rating score is\nconsiderably expanded and allows for more variation (see Table A4 for details). It should\nbe noted, however, that different specifications and transformations of the rating scores\nlead to similar results in the regression.\n3.4 Estimating the marginal risk contribution\nUibt\nis the marginal risk contribution of a loan to the unexpected losses of the whole credit\nportfolio. Hence in a first step the unexpected loss has to be determined at the portfolio\nlevel and in a second step it is disaggregated at the country level.\nThe most widespread gauge of a portfolio's unexpected loss is the Value at Risk (VaR).\nVaR is the maximum loss over a target horizon such that with a pre-specified high\nprobability, pc, the actual loss will be smaller. It can be determined from the distribution of\nthe portfolio losses at the target horizon as the difference between the mean of the portfolio\nvalue and the value at the pc-percentile. To obtain the marginal risk contribution, the VaR\nis weighted by the ratio which divides the covariance between the portfolio loss (PLbt\n) and\nthe loss to country i (PLibt\n) by the portfolio's variance of the portfolio loss. Note that these\nweights ensure that the marginal risk contributions add up to the VaR:\n23 Standard & Poor's (2003b) define a credit watch as \"..highlighting the potential direction of a short- or\nlong term rating where the focus is on identifiable events and short term trends that cause the rating to be\nplaced under special surveillance\".\n)\nV\nV\n(\n)\nPL\n(\nsdv\n)\nPL\n,\nPL\ncov(\nUL ]\npc\n[\nbt\nbt\nbt\nbt\nibt\n]\npc\n[\nibt\n-\nwhere PLbt\nstands for the bank's portfolio loss, PLibt\nstands for the bank's portfolio loss to\ncountry i,\nbt\nV stands for the mean value of bank b's portfolio at time t, ]\npc\n[\nbt\nV is the\nand cov (sdv) stand for the covariance (standard deviation) operator. The values for the\nweights and for the VaR have to be taken from the distribution of the portfolio value.\nThe credit portfolio's value distribution can be estimated using a credit risk model. Our\ndatabase lends itself to using a simplified version of CreditMetrics.24 The basic\nassumptions of CreditMetrics are that the returns of a creditor are normally distributed,\nfurther, that a default occurs when the returns of a creditor fall under a certain threshold,\nand that the probability of the default event can be taken from the probability of default\nassociated with the creditor's rating. As for the estimation of RCC, here we also use the\nStandard & Poor's country ratings and the one-year probabilities of default for corporates\nto compute default thresholds.25 We further assume that the correlation between the returns\nof a country can be measured by the returns from stock market indices and compute a\ncorrelation matrix of the returns for all countries in the sample with the stock market total\nreturn indices provided by Morgan Stanley. It should be noted that the index is only\navailable for a total of 51 countries (see Appendix for a list of country names).\nThe current value of a bank's overall portfolio at the beginning of a period is given by the\nsum of the bank's individual exposures to each country Libt\nwhich we take from the credit\nregister as described above.26 We then simulate returns using a multivariate normal\ndistribution with mean zero and the correlation matrix from the stock market total return\nindices. Default occurs when the simulated return falls below the threshold given by the\ncritical value that is derived from the default probability. In line with the Consultative\nPaper 4, we assume that loss given default (LGD) is constant and equals 45%27 and\ncalculate the simulated portfolio value at the end of the period. We then repeat this exercise\n100,000 times in order to obtain the simulated loss distribution of bank b in period t. In\n25 The Basel Committee (1999) notes that most banks apply a one-year time horizon across all asset classes.\n26 It should be noted that the country exposures have been corrected by deducting public guarantees, since the\nrisks are transferred to a guarantor which exhibits practically zero risk.\n27 We further assumed that the correlation between probabilities of default and LGD is constant and equal to\nzero. The same applies to LGD between borrowers. This is consistent with the assumptions of the Basel\norder to obtain a panel of observations for Uibt\nwe also calculate class distributions for each\nbanking group and each period in our sample.\nSummary statistics and a correlation matrix are given in Appendix Tables A6 and A7.\nWe start by analysing the question of whether economic capital is binding when compared\nwith a hypothetic regulatory capital according to Basel II over the last 6 years. This will be\nthe case if economic capital exceeds regulatory capital (RCC_II). We first test the\nhypothesis of equation (4), that is comparing the means of UL and RCC_II, both calculated\nover all periods, countries and banks. The results of the t-test are reported in Table 1.\nTable 1: Comparison of economic capital and hypothetic regulatory capital according to\nBasel II\n: UL  RCC_II, H1\n: UL < RCC_II,\nMarginal Risk\nContribution\nt-value\n(p-value)\nThe tests indicate that regulatory capital is not binding, because the mean of economic\ncapital exceeds or equals the regulatory requirement. This result still holds when choosing\na confidence level of 99.5%. To our knowledge banks typically do not work with\nconfidence levels lower than 99.5%.\nHowever, the outcome of the test could be driven by single countries or quarters. To check\nthe robustness of our results, we also computed test statistics according to equation (4), i.e.\nfor individual countries at the 99.9% confidence level and, additionally, for individual\nquarters (see Tables A2 and A3 in the appendix). We find only a few countries and no\nperiod for which regulatory capital is binding. So overall, the data confirm our thesis that\n(at least on average) economic capital exceeds regulatory capital.\nCommitte on Banking Supervision (2004b). For the sake of simplicity we do not include losses from rating\nmigration (\"mark-to-market\").\nOne caveat in interpreting this result is that of the test might depend on the specific model\nwe used to proxy the marginal risk contributions, namely CreditMetrics. There are other\nmodels in use like Credit Risk + (Credit Suisse First Boston 1997), Credit Portfolio View\n(Wilson 1998), or KMV (Kealhofer 1995) and it would be interesting to experiment with\nthem. The first best choice would be to use data on the actual marginal risk contributions in\neach bank, however, such data has not been collected.\nAs a second condition for the neutrality of Basel II we test whether banks' lending\ndecisions are influenced by the marginal risk contribution. To this end we estimate the\nregression given in (5). Since we use the lagged endogenous variable as explanatory, we\napply the Blundell/Bond system GMM estimator.28 We show the results for the full bank\nsample, and separately for Large banks, Landesbanken and remaining other banks, which\nare mainly small private banks.29\nTable 2 presents the results. For the full sample of banks neither of our variables of interest\nis significant. This seems to be mainly due to the heterogeneity between banking groups.\nWhen differentiating between banking groups the following picture emerges: The\ncoefficient for marginal risk contribution (UL) is negative and significant at the 1 percent\nconficence level for Large Banks and other banks. Unexpected loss seems to have\ndetermined lending by these banking groups. For the Landesbanken, on the other hand,\nunexpected loss is not statistically significant.\nSomewhat surprisingly, the interest rate and expected loss are insignificant in most\nestimates. A possible reason for the latter might be that banks use internal ratings, which\ndiffer significantly from the ones of S&P. For instance Krahnen (2000) argues that internal\nratings of German banks are more volatile than ratings of external rating agencies, which\nmay be due to soft factors that are not publicly known and part of banks' informational\nlead and thus represents the value added of internal ratings. However, to our knowledge,\nthis argument applies mostly for internal ratings of firms and less so to sovereign ratings.\n29 As described above, the dataset comprises quarterly credit flows to 30 emerging markets between 1996-III\nTable 2: Blundell-Bond System GMM Estimation30 of Equation (5), Dependent Variable:\nCredit Flows (Libt\nAll Banks Large Banks\n(Big Four)\nGerman\nLandesbanken\nOther\nInterest Rate (Rt\nExpected Loss (ELit\nMarginal risk\ncontribution (ULibt\nLending Stock (Libt-1\nLending Stock (Libt-2\nHansen test#\n(p-value)\nAR (1) test\n(p-value)\nAR (2) test\n(p-value)\nt-values in brackets, *, **, *** denotes significance at 10%, 5% and 1%.\n#Hansen test for over-identifying restrictions.\nIt is important to note that the results are largely based on data before the first Basel II\nproposals were published. Since then Landesbanken (like many other banks) may have\nbeen modernizing their risk management taking the proposals into account. We test\nwhether this \"phasing in\" is important by limiting the estimation for the time after the first\nConsultative Paper was published by the Basel Committee in June 1999. Now the results\n(given in Table 3) confirm that overall banks have based their international lending\ndecisions on unexpected loss considerations. The variable unexpected loss enters\nsignificantly in the lending equation for the full sample, Large Banks and Landesbanken.\n30 Only asymptotically more efficient two-step Blundell-Bond system GMM estimates are reported. To\ncompensate for the downward bias in two-step estimates of the standard errors the finite-sample correction\nderived by Windmeijer (2000) is applied. Regression results have been obtained combining the columns of\nthe instrument matrix and thus use only one instrument for each variable and lag distance, rather than one for\neach time period, variable and lag distance.\nThis results support the view that lending has increasingly been determined by economic\ncapital in preparation for Basel II.\nEquation (5), Dependent Variable: Credit Flows (Libt\n), time dummies included\nAll Banks Large Banks\n(Big Four)\nGerman\nLandesbanken\nOther\nInterest Rate (Rt\nExpected Loss (ELit\nMarginal risk\ncontribution (ULibt\nLending Stock (Libt-1\nLending Stock (Libt-2\nHansen test#\n(p-value)\nAR (1) test\n(p-value)\nAR (2) test\n(p-value)\nt-values in brackets, *, **, *** denotes significance at 10%, 5% and 1%.\n#Hansen test for overidentifying restrictions.\nNext we check whether the result is robust to the inclusion of regulatory capital according\nto Basel I (RCC_I). Recall from above that under Basel I all OECD countries have a zero\ncapital requirement, while non OECD countries have a risk weight of one hundred. Given\nthe results of Table 2 we would expect that regulatory capital had no influence on lending\ndecisions. We now test the question from another angle by including both Basel I\nregulatory capital (which is simply an OECD dummy) and unexpected loss in the lending\nequation. The results in the Appendix Table A5. In none of the cases regulatory capital is\npositive and significant. Thus Basel I does not seem to have impacted lending decisions,\nand regulatory arbitrage opportunities under Basel I seem to have played a minor role only.\nThe result further corroborates our hypothesis that the introduction of Basel II will not lead\nto considerable adjustments in the banks' portfolios. Finally, it should be noted that the\nsignificance of unexpected loss is not robust to the inclusion of the OECD dummy for the\noverall results and other banks. Since the correlation between the variables of interest is\nlow (see Appendix Table A7) we cannot attribute this finding to the collinearity among the\nvariables, but rather to the heterogeneity among the group of other banks.\n5 Conclusion\nThe empirical evidence presented in this paper suggests that Basel II will have a limited\neffect on loans to emerging markets, as least if German Banks are representative of other\nbanking systems. According to the evidence presented here the Basel Committee seems to\nhave achieved the goal of bringing regulatory capital in line with economic capital from\nbelow. It seems to be that the capital costs will not rise on average and, additionally, that\nmost internationally active banks have already adopted modern risk assessment tools for\ntheir decisions.\nSpecifically we showed that on average economic capital is higher than regulatory capital\nunder Basel II. This is true for plausible levels of confidence in calculating economic\ncapital based on a Value at Risk Model. We then proceeded to estimate a dynamic panel\nregression of determinants of lending to emerging markets. We find that economic capital\nis a significant determinant of the Large banks' loan decisions. When we restrict the\nsample to more recent years economic capital enters significantly for all banks. Further, we\nfind no evidence that banks have biased their lending towards OECD emerging markets for\nwhich capital costs are zero under Basel I. We therefore expect that by the time the Basel II\nrules will become effective they will have only a negligible effect on German banks' loans\nto emerging markets.\n6 References\nBIS (1999), \"A New Capital Adequacy Framework\", Basel Committee Publication No. 50,\nJune.\nBIS (2001), \"The New Basel Capital Accord\", Second Consultative Paper, January.\nBIS (2003), \"The New Basel Capital Accord\", Third Consultative Paper, March.\nBartholdy, K, and N.
