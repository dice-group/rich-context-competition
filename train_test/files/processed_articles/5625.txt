Occurring predominantly from over-stimulation of\nionotropic glutamate receptors located along dendrites,\nexcitotoxic axonal degeneration may also occur in white\nmatter tracts. Recent identification of axonal glutamate\nreceptor subunits within axonal nanocomplexes raises the\npossibility of direct excitotoxic effects on axons. Individual\nneuronal responses to excitotoxicity are highly dependent\non the complement of glutamate receptors expressed by\nthe cell, and the localization of the functional receptors. To\nenable isolation of distal axons and targeted excitotoxicity,\nmurine cortical neuron cultures were prepared in com-\npartmented microfluidic devices, such that distal axons\nwere isolated from neuronal cell bodies. Within the com-\npartmented culture system, cortical neurons developed to\nrelative maturity at 11 DIV (days in vitro) as demonstrated\nby the formation of dendritic spines and clustering of\nthe presynaptic protein synaptophysin. The isolated distal\naxons retained growth cone structures in the absence of\nsynaptic targets, and expressed glutamate receptor sub-\nunits. Glutamate treatment (100 mM) to the cell body cham-\nber resulted in widespread degeneration within this chamber\nand degeneration of distal axons in the other cham-\nber. Glutamate application to the distal axon chamber\ntriggered a lesser degree of axonal degeneration without\ndegenerative changes in the untreated somal chamber. These\ndata indicate that in addition to current mechanisms of\nindirect axonal excitotoxicity, the distal axon may be a\nprimary target for excitotoxicity in neurodegenerative\nconditions.\n",

The response of an individual\nneuron to excitotoxicity is dependent on a number of factors,\nincluding the intensity and duration of the excitatory in-\nsult, and the profile of excitatory receptors or downstream\nsignalling molecules expressed by the cell (Arundine and\nTymianski, 2003). Pathologically, excitotoxicity can result in\napoptotic cell death that may be preceded by dendritic beading.\nExcitotoxicity has also been implicated in axon degeneration,\nand in cultured cortical neurons degeneration is preceded by\nneurofilament loss (Chung et al., 2005). Furthermore, excito-\ntoxicity has been shown to result in a distal axonopathy in\nretinal ganglion cells (Saggu et al., 2008) and cultured motor\nneurons (King et al., 2007). It is currently unknown as to how\nexcitotoxicity results in axonal degeneration.\nNeuronal glutamate receptors, the mediators of excito-\ntoxicity, are found on postsynaptic densities where they are\ninvolved in synaptic transmission. However, immunohisto-\nchemical techniques have demonstrated the presence of\nglutamate receptors at numerous extrasynaptic sites includ-\ning the soma, dendrites and spines (reviewed in Newpher and\nEhlers, 2008) and presynaptically (Tovar and Westbrook,\n2002). Importantly, electrophysiological techniques have also\nindicated that these receptors can be functional (Andrasfalvy\nreceptors, and specifically NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)\n1 Both these authors contributed equally to this work.\n2 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email Tracey.Dickson@utas.edu.au).\nAbbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; AMPA, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid; DIV, days in vitro; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MAP2,\nmicrotubule-associated protein-2; NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate; NR1, NMDA receptor subunit 1.\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nreceptors, have been particularly implicated in excitotoxicity\n(Sattler et al., 2000). Current evidence supports the notion that\nsynaptic receptor activation promotes neuroprotection\nthrough activation of survival genes and suppression of\napoptotic genes, whereas extrasynaptic stimulation promotes\ncell death (Hardingham et al., 2002), although this may be due\nto differences in receptor subunits (Liu et al., 2007). Thus, the\ndistribution of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors,\nrather than total calcium load, influence neuronal suscepti-\nbility and responses to excitotoxicity (reviewed in Hardingham\nAlthough excitotoxicity is considered primarily a neuronal\nsomatodendritic insult, glutamate toxicity has also been\ndemonstrated to occur in white matter tracts lacking\nneuronal cell bodies. This type of toxicity, often associated\nwith brain injury, ischaemia and glaucoma (Stys and Li, 2000;\nSaggu et al., 2008), has been attributed to glial cells known to\nexpress functional glutamate receptors (Micu et al., 2006;\nMatute, 2007). Oligodendrocytes are directly vulnerable to\nAMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic\nacid) mediated Ca2+ excitotoxicity resulting in demyelination\nand secondary axonal pathology (Yoshioka et al., 1995;\nBannerman et al., 2007). However, the recent identification\nof axonal glutamate receptor subunits within axonal inter-\nnodal nanocomplexes, raises the possibility of direct axonal\nstatus of these receptors remains disputed; they may be\ninvolved in local regulatory mechanisms within the internodal\nnanocomplexes they reside in.\nInvestigation of the expression of glutamate receptors in\ndifferent neuronal compartments and their role in excito-\ntoxicity is difficult under standard culture conditions due to\nthe inability to specifically target excitatory agonists. Simi-\nlarly, in vivo investigations are complicated by the presence\nof glial cells. To overcome this, we have utilized microfluidic\ndevices (Taylor et al., 2005) to establish compartmented\nembryonic cortical neuron cultures. Such devices allow fluidic\nisolation of distal axons from cell bodies, thus allowing focal\nexposure of the axon or soma to excitotoxins. In this study,\nwe have examined the maturation of primary mouse cortical\nneurons within a microfluidic device, in addition to immuno-\ncytochemical and Western blot analysis of the expression\nof glutamate receptor subunits in both the somal and dis-\ntal axon compartments. To determine if excitotoxin-induced\naxon degeneration can result from somal or axonal exposure\nto excitotoxin, we also examined the effect of a chronic\n(24 and 72 h) exposure of glutamate to either the somal or\naxonal chamber.\nAll animals experiments used were reviewed and approved by\nthe Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Tasmania.\nPrimary cell culture\nPrimary cortical neurons were dissected from the superficial\nlayers of cerebral cortex of gestational day 14 embryos,\nobtained from pregnant C57Bl/6 mice and prepared as\nCells were dissociated in `initial' plating medium: Neurobasal\nmedium (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies), 2% B27 supplement\n(Gibco BRL, Life Technologies), 10% foetal bovine serum,\n0.5 mM glutamine, 25 mM glutamate and penicillin/strep-\ntomycin. Cell density and viability was assessed using a Trypan\nBlue dye exclusion assay, and the volume adjusted to achieve a\ndensity of 86106 cells/ml. Neurons were plated into prepared\nmicrofluidic devices (450 nm barrier grooves, Xona\nMicrofluidics, Figure 1A) as outlined below. In contrast to\nCampenot compartmented chambers utilizing Teflon divisions\nand scratched substrate to guide axonal growth, microfluidic\ndevices are fabricated from PDMS using a photoresist template\nto create microchannels for axonal growth between compart-\nglass coverslips (Livingstone), coated with 0.001% poly-L-lysine\nand incubated overnight. Microfluidics were rinsed with initial\nplating medium, which was removed immediately prior to\naddition of cells into the somal chamber. Plated neurons were\nincubated for 10 min to facilitate adhesion, followed by\naddition of initial plating medium. Cultures were incubated\n), with the medium\nchanged to 'subsequent' growth medium (Neurobasal medium,\n2% B27 supplement, 0.5 mM glutamine and penicillin/\nstreptomycin), at 1 and 7 DIV (days in vitro).\nLabelling of live cells in microfluidic chambers\nNot all neurons extended axons through to the distal\nchamber, therefore, to identify neuronal soma with isolated\ndistal axons, the lipophilic membrane stain CM-DiI (1 mg/ml,\nMolecular Probes) was added to the distal axon chamber.\nMicrofluidic isolation between the treated and untreated\nsides was achieved by maintaining a lower fluid volume on\nthe treated side (Taylor et al., 2005). Microfluidic devices were\nincubated for 4 h under standard growth conditions,\nfollowed by media change. Subsequent experimentation\nwas performed the next day, as required.\nIn some experiments, neurons were transfected with a\nplasmid expressing GFP (green fluorescent protein; pmax GFP,\nLonza) to allow morphological analysis of neuronal pro-\ncesses. Briefly, 800 ng plasmid DNA was applied to the somal\nchamber using the LipofectamineTM 2000 reagent (Invi-\ntrogen) for 6 h, under standard growth conditions, according\nto the manufacturer's instructions. This was followed by\ncomplete media change. Transfected neurons were visualized\nby fluorescence microscopy after 24 h.\nExcitotoxicity\nExcitotoxicity was initiated in mature (11 DIV) compart-\nmented cultures (n55 repeats) by a single application of\nK.

Microfluidic isolation was\nperformed as above. Additional cultures were treated with\n100 mM glutamate for 72 h to the axonal chamber, beginning\nat 10 DIV. Treated cultures were maintained under standard\ngrowth conditions for 24 or 72 h, followed by fixation.\nInhibition of caspase activity\nThe pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (R&D Systems) was\nadded to either the distal axon or somal chambers to inactivate\ncaspase activity. Cultures were pre-incubated in 10 mM Z-VAD-\nFMK in culture medium for 2 h and excitotoxicity induced as\ndescribed above.\nCell fixation and immunocytochemical labelling\nCortical neuron cultures were fixed with 4% PFA (para-\nformaldehyde) for 30 min at room temperature, then\n(NMDA receptor subunit 1) visualization, coverslips were fixed\nin ice-cold methanol for 10 min at 220\u00b0C, omitting\npermeabilization (note: AMPA receptor immunoreactivity\nwas not affected by the method of fixation). This was\nfollowed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted in\nPBS, for 1 h at room temperature followed by 4\u00b0C overnight.\nAntibodies used in this study include those directed to GluR1\n(1:200 Millipore). All antibodies are commercially available\nand optimum concentrations were individually determined\nfor each antibody. Species and isotype appropriate fluor-\nescent AlexaFluor secondary antibodies (1:1000, Molecular\nProbes) were applied for 2 h at room temperature.

Image acquisition and subsequent\nanalysis was performed blinded to experimental conditions.\nFour 6400 images were randomly captured from each distal\nimposed on each image using Adobe Photoshop (CS5). Axons\nin each square of the grid were scored as either whole,\nbeaded (distinguishable swellings connected by sections of\naxon) or fragmented (disconnected swellings) (Figure 1D).\nOverall degeneration was calculated as the sum of beaded\nand fragmented axons. Values were expressed as a percentage\nof total axons. Total values from each square were averaged\nfor each coverslip and analysed using Student's t-test. P-\nvalues ,0.05 were considered significant. A minimum of five\nseparate culture repeats were analysed. Data are represented\nas means\u00a1SEM.\nRESULTS\nDevelopmental characteristics of\ncompartmented cortical neuronal culture\nMouse cortical neuron cultures were established within\ncompartmented microfluidic culture devices (Taylor et al.,\n2005) and their growth characteristics were examined over a\ntime course (Figures 2A\u00ad2E). Initial neuronal development (1\u00ad\n3 DIV) was restricted to the somal chamber (Figure 2A). By 5\nDIV, the neurons had extended multiple neurites within the\nsomal chamber (Figure 2C) and axons were present within the\nmicrochannels (Figure 2D). At 7 DIV long, relatively\nunbranched axons were present extending from the micro-\nchannels into the distal axon chamber, forming an exten-\nsively branched network at 11 DIV (Figure 2F). Isolated axonal\nhealth declined from 14 DIV, with extensive distal axon\ndegeneration present at 15 DIV (Figure 2H). Degeneration of\naxons within the distal axon chamber from 15 DIV was not\naccompanied by degeneration within the somal chamber\n(Figure 2G).\nDouble immunolabelling verified that axons (NF-M\nimmunoreactivity) were present in the distal axon chamber,\nwith neuronal cell bodies and dendrites (MAP2 immuno-\nreactivity) restricted to the somal chamber (Figure 2I), as\npreviously described by Taylor et al. (2005). NF-M immunor-\neactive axons were also present in the somal chamber.\nNeurons with axons extending into the distal chamber were\nidentified by incubating the distal axon chamber with CM-DiI\nprior to treatment. CM-DiI was taken up by the axons and\ntransported to the cell body (Perlson et al., 2009) (Figure 2J).\nDiI retrograde labelling from the distal axon chamber\nindicated that approximately 30% of neurons extended\naxons to the distal chamber.\nNeuronal maturity in compartmented cultures was deter-\nmined by examining the presence of growth cones, synapses\nand spines. Previous investigations have demonstrated that\nunder standard conditions, immature neurons prior to the\ndevelopment of synapses have numerous growth cones (Haas\net al., 2004). As neurons mature, punctate synapses and\nmushroom-shaped spines are formed on the dendrites\naccompanied by the loss of growth cones (King et al.,\n2006). In the current study, the presence of growth cones in\ncompartmented cultures was examined by phalloidin staining\nfor filamentous actin and synaptic puncta were visualized by\nimmunolabelling with the presynaptic marker synaptophysin\nin addition to the dendritic marker MAP2. Dendritic spine\nmorphology was determined by examination of neurons\ntransiently transfected with a GFP expression construct. In\nthe somal chamber at 11 DIV, few growth cones were present\nand synaptophysin positive puncta were immunolabelled\nalong MAP2 immunopositive dendrites (Figure 3A), with the\nnumber and density of puncta varying between cells,\ncongruent with previous investigations (King et al., 2006).\nFurthermore, GFP expression revealed short, mushroom-\nshaped spines (Figure 3B) on the dendrites in addition to a\nnumber of long filopodial spines (Figure 3C). These data\nindicate that, in the somal chamber, synapses were present in\naccordance with neuronal maturity in standard cultures (King\net al., 2006). However, in the distal axonal chamber at this\ndevelopmental stage, large growth cones were present at\nthe ends of axons (Figure 3D), indicating a stage of im-\nmaturity not usually seen in standard cultures at this time\npoint in vitro.\nGlutamate receptor expression in\ncompartmented cultures\nTo examine whether components of the machinery required\nfor functional glutamatergic signalling, and therefore\nexcitotoxicity, were present, the expression of glutamate\nreceptor subunits was determined. Expression of both NMDA\nand AMPA receptors was examined within the somal and\ndistal axon chambers of mature (11 DIV) cultures by immu-\nnocytochemistry using glutamate subunit specific antibodies.\nThe expression profiles of the receptors varied between\nneurons within each culture. Within the somal chamber, im-\nmunoreactivity for AMPA (GluR1) and NMDA (NR1) receptor\nsubunits was present throughout the soma, with punctate\nexpression along the dendrites (Figures 4A and 4B). Within\nthe distal chamber, AMPA subunit labelling (GluR4) was\nfrequently present and punctate along distal axons and\nwithin the growth cone (Figure 4C). Immunoreactivity for\nNMDA receptors was occasionally present within distal axon\ngrowth cones (Figure 4D).\nTo confirm the presence of glutamate receptor subunits\nin the somal and distal axon chambers, protein was harvested\nK.

Coomassie staining\nof SDS/PAGE gels demonstrated a good yield of protein from\nboth chambers (Figure 4E). Western blots confirmed the\npresence of NMDA (NR1 labelling at 120 kDa) and AMPA\nreceptors in the somal chambers (Figure 4F). Interestingly,\nWestern blot analysis also demonstrated the presence of\nAMPA receptors in protein harvested from the distal axon\nchamber (Figure 4F). NMDA receptors, however, were not\ndetected in the distal axon chamber (Figure 4F). Together,\nthese data indicate differential expression of glutamate\nreceptors subunits on both the somatodendritic compart-\nment and distal axon of the cortical neuron, with strong\nevidence for the presence of AMPA receptor subunits in the\naxon.\nFunctional contribution of expressed glutamate\nreceptors to focal excitotoxicity\nTo determine the role of the axon in mediating excitotoxi-\ncity, mature (11 DIV) mouse cortical neurons were treated\nwith 100 mM glutamic acid or vehicle control, applied to\neither the somal or the distal axon chamber of the\nmicrofluidic device, and maintained for 24 h post-treat-\nment. Following treatment, distal axon degeneration was\nassessed based on neurofilament immunoreactivity for\naxonal integrity.\nFigure 2 Neuronal growth in compartmented culture\nInitial neuronal growth in compartmented culture (2 DIV) (A) is restricted to the somal chamber with axons extending into the distal cham-\nber to form a branched network at 11 DIV (B). At 5 DIV neuronal growth is characterized by branched neurites within the\nsomal chamber (C) and neurites visible within the microchannels (arrow) (D). At 11 DIV neurites within somal chamber (E)\nwere densely branched, and axons within the distal axon chamber (F) had formed extensive branched networks.

Of\nrelevance to the current study, our previous investigations\net al., 1996) have demonstrated that neuronal vulnerability\nto excitotoxicity is dependent on neuronal maturity and\nexpression of glutamate receptor subunits, which is variable\nbetween cell types. Thus, for the current study it was im-\nportant to determine the maturity of neurons within the\nmicrofluidic culture chambers.\nUnder standard growth conditions, development of pri-\nmary murine cortical neurons occurs via a sequence of\npredetermined steps that include neurite outgrowth, polar-\nization and elongation followed by movement of glutamate\nreceptors into the synapses and loss of immaturity markers\nThe timing of these developmental stages is dependent on\nAssessment of neuronal growth of cultures in microfluidic\nchambers indicates that development occurs in a similar\nmanner to standard cortical culture within the somal\nchamber, including the presence of mature spines and\npunctate glutamate receptor subunits at 11 DIV.

Excitotoxic\nstimulation of axonal glutamate receptors resulted in axonal\ndegeneration, which, unlike somatodendritic exposure, was\nconfined to the exposed segment of the axon and did not\ncause retrograde degeneration or apoptotic cell death, even\nat extended time-points of 72 h. These data also suggest the\npresence of functional glutamate receptor complexes on\nthe axons in this chamber.\nAxon degeneration and excitotoxicity\nAxon degeneration following glutamate receptor stimulation\nhas been previously reported in a number of studies. In vitro\nstudies have indicated that axon degeneration occurs as a\nresult of chronic excitotoxicity in cultured motor (King et al.,\nstudies, however, glutamate or other agonists were globally\napplied to the cells and so it is unclear if axon degeneration\noccurred from toxicity to somatodendritic glutamate recep-\ntors, or receptors present on axons, growth cones or\npresynaptic terminals. In vivo studies have allowed focal\nexcitotoxin exposure of neuronal compartments. Somal\nglutamate exposure to retinal ganglion cells resulted in a\ndegeneration of the distal axon (Saggu et al., 2008),\nconfirming excitotoxic axonal degeneration in the unexposed\naxon segment, consistent with the current study in cortical\nneurons. In vivo glutamate exposure to myelinated axons also\nresulted in axonal damage to the optic nerve (Matute, 1998)\nand external capsule (Fowler et al., 2003). The vulnerability of\nmyelinating oligodendrocytes to excitotoxicity has been well\ndocumented and myelin has been demonstrated to play a role\nin axonal excitotoxicity (Fowler et al., 2006). However, studies\nusing myelin-deficient Shiverer mice show that compact\nmyelin is not required for AMPA toxicity to axons (Pitt et al.,\nA study by Underhill and Goldberg (2007) utilized a\nCampenot style compartmentalized culture system to directly\nexamine the role of glutamate receptor activation in axon\ndegeneration in the absence of glial cells. Their data\ndemonstrated that brief (2 h) axonal exposure to glutamate\nreceptor agonists, NMDA or AMPA, did not result in sig-\nnificant axonal degeneration. Conversely, the current study\nusing a compartmentalized microfluidic culture system,\ndemonstrates the novel finding that chronic (24 h) glutamate\nexposure results in axonal blebbing and fragmentation in a\nproportion of axons. The reasons for these conflicting results\nmay be the length of time of the exposure, the agonists used\nor differences in the culture systems, which may select for\nisolation of axons from specific cell types. Interestingly, in\nvivo studies also suggest difference in chronic versus acute\nexcitotoxic axonal exposure (Matute, 1998). These data\nsuggest that excitotoxicity can be mediated through\nglutamate receptors expressed on the axon.\nExcitotoxicity and glutamate receptor expression\nIn the current study excitotoxicity could be mediated through\nglutamate receptors expressed either on the axon shaft or on\nthe growth cones. Glutamate receptors can be trafficked to the\naxonal compartment and in particular their presence within\ngrowth cones during neuronal development has been well\ndocumented (King et al., 2006), with a proposed involvement\nin pathfinding (Zheng et al., 1996). Recently, subunits for\nAMPA and kainate receptors have been shown to be present on\nthe functional activity of these receptors is currently disputed.\nOur data confirm the presence of AMPA receptors in the\naxonal compartment of cultured axons by immunocytochemi-\ncal labelling and Western blot analysis. The role of these axonal\nglutamate receptors is unclear; however, the expression of\nfunctional NMDA and non-NMDA receptors on glial cells (Gallo\npossibility that axonal glutamate receptor subunits may\nfacilitate glutamatergic signalling between axons and myeli-\nnating oligodendrocytes or astrocytes.\nA limitation of the current study is that cultured distal\naxons were unable to synapse on other neurons, prevent-\ning the formation of the presynaptic terminal. This excludes\nthe possibility that excitotoxicity was mediated through\npresynaptic receptors. In vivo, both NMDA and AMPA\nreceptors are found presynaptically, where they are thought\nto regulate glutamate release (recently reviewed in Pinheiro\nand Mulle, 2008) and could potentially be targets for\nexcitotoxic stimulation. Although the expression pattern of\naxonal glutamate receptors may differ in vivo, the current\nstudy suggests that excitotoxicity can be mediated through\nextrasynaptic glutamate receptors expressed on the axon.\nThe demonstration of the extrasynaptic expression of\nglutamate receptor subtypes (Passafaro et al., 2001; Tovar\nZundert et al., 2004) suggests a wider role for glutamate than\nsolely as an inter-neuronal excitatory transmitter (Araque\nand Perea, 2004). Glutamate receptor subunits at non-\nsynaptic sites on dendrites and spines are thought to act as a\nreserve supply of synaptic receptors (for recent review see\nNewpher and Ehlers 2008). However, electrophysiological\nrecordings indicate that these extrasynaptic receptors are\nfunctional (Andrasfalvy and Magee, 2001) and a modulatory\nrole has been suggested, through activation by glutamate\nspillover from the synapse or glial derived glutamate (Dia-\npathological stimulation of glutamate receptors, extrasynap-\ntic and synaptic receptors have been reported to play a\nsignificantly different role in excitotoxicity. Stimulation of\nsynaptic NMDA receptors is neuroprotective, whereas activa-\ntion of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors triggers neuronal\nExcitotoxicity-mediated axonopathy\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\ndegeneration (Hardingham et al., 2002), although some\nauthors demonstrate that preferential expression of receptor\nsubunit types at extrasynaptic sites is responsible for this\neffect rather than localization itself (Liu et al., 2007).\nMechanisms of axonal glutamate excitotoxicity\nand implications for disease\nMechanism of axonal degeneration, including potential\ndifferences between axonal and somal glutamate stimulation,\ncannot be fully determined in the current study; however, the\nprotective effect of a pan-caspase inhibitor suggests the in-\nvolvement of pathways associated with apoptosis. It is of parti-\ncular interest to note that application of inhibitors to either the\nsoma or axon provided protection from degeneration. The role\nof axonal caspases in axonal degeneration is being increasingly\nrecognized and has been reported in a number of models\nsuggests that retrograde signalling to the soma is involved in\naxon degeneration following axonal excitotoxicity, without\ninducing frank apoptosis. Further elucidating the mechanisms\nof excitotoxin-induced axon degeneration will be the subject of\nfuture studies using this model.\nThe findings of the current study have a number of\nimplications for our understanding of neurodegenerative\ndisease. Excitotoxicity within the white matter has been\nshown to occur in a number of degenerative conditions\nincluding glaucoma (Saggu et al., 2008) and multiple sclerosis\n(Pitt et al., 2003), and is also common following injury\n(reviewed in Lau and Tymianski, 2010). Furthermore, axonal\nexcitotoxicity may be involved in any condition involving exci-\ntotoxic pathogenesis including, potentially, ALS (amyotrophic\nlateral sclerosis) (van Damme et al., 2005) and AD (Hynd et al.,\n2004), with local regions of excitotoxicity triggering axon\ndegeneration and synaptic loss. At present, excitotoxic damage\nis attributed to neuronal soma and glial cells, and secondary\naxon degeneration via axon\u00adglia signalling. The current study\nsuggests that axon degeneration could occur from direct\nexposure of the axon to excitotoxins. However, axonal\nexcitotoxicty did not result in a dying back, even 72 h\nfollowing exposure. The relative immaturity of the axons\nthrough lack of presynaptic targets and therefore retrograde\nsignals from postsynaptic cells may be a factor in the lack of\ndie back in this study. It is currently unknown as to how\naxonally mediated excitotoxicity affects a cell's survival in\nmature cells in vivo in the long-term. However, this may have\ntherapeutic implications as intervention may need to be\ndirected specifically to induce axon protection.\nFUNDING\nThe work was supported by the Wicking Dementia Research\nand Education Centre, National Health and Medical Re-\nsearch Council [grant number APP10039], Tasmanian Masonic\nCentenary Medical Research Foundation, and Alzheimer's\nAssociation Australia, Motor Neuron Disease Research\nInstitute of Australia, University of Tasmania.\nREFERENCES\nAndrasfalvy BK, Magee JC (2001) Distance-dependent increase in AMPA\nreceptor number in the dendrites of adult hippocampal CA1 pyramidal\nAraque A, Perea G (2004) Glial modulation of synaptic transmission in\nArundine M, Tymianski M (2003) Molecular mechanisms of calcium-\ndependent neurodegeneration in excitotoxicity.
