    "reduced_content": "Although the individual components of the metabolic\nsyndrome are clearly associated with increased risk for\ncoronary heart disease (CHD), we wanted to quantify\nthe increased prevalence of CHD among people with\nmetabolic syndrome. The Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) was used\nto categorize adults over 50 years of age by presence of\nmetabolic syndrome (National Cholesterol Education\nProgram [NCEP] definition) with or without diabetes.\nDemographic and risk factor information was deter-\nmined for each group, as well as the proportion of each\ngroup meeting specific criteria for metabolic syndrome.\nThe prevalence of CHD for each group was then deter-\nmined. Metabolic syndrome is very common, with 44%\nof the U.S. population over 50 years of age meeting the\nNCEP criteria. In contrast, diabetes without metabolic\nsyndrome is uncommon (13% of those with diabetes).\nOlder Americans over 50 years of age without metabolic\nsyndrome regardless of diabetes status had the lowest\nCHD prevalence (8.7% without diabetes, 7.5% with\ndiabetes). Compared with those with metabolic syn-\ndrome, people with diabetes without metabolic syn-\ndrome did not have an increase in CHD prevalence.\nThose with metabolic syndrome without diabetes had\nhigher CHD prevalence (13.9%), and those with both\nmetabolic syndrome and diabetes had the highest prev-\nalence of CHD (19.2%) compared with those with nei-\nther. Metabolic syndrome was a significant univariate\n2.59). However, blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, and\ndiabetes, but not presence of metabolic syndrome, were\nsignificant multivariate predictors of prevalent CHD.\nThe prevalence of CHD markedly increased with the\npresence of metabolic syndrome. Among people with\ndiabetes, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was\nvery high, and those with diabetes and metabolic syn-\ndrome had the highest prevalence of CHD. Among all\nindividuals with diabetes, prevalence of CHD was in-\ncreased compared with those with metabolic syndrome\nwithout diabetes. However, individuals with diabetes\nwithout metabolic syndrome had no greater prevalence\nof CHD compared with those with neither. Diabetes\nThe frequent simultaneous presence of obesity,\nhyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension was\nfirst described in the late 1960s (1). This associ-\nation (i.e., diabetes, hypertension, and obesity\nwith hyperlipidemia) was subsequently highlighted in the\nlate 1970s by a number of German researchers, including\nHaller and colleagues (2,3). They coined the term \"meta-\nbolic syndrome\" and described its association with athero-\nsclerosis. In 1991, Ferrannini et al. (4) described the same\nclustering of abnormalities in this cardiovascular and\nmetabolic syndrome as being caused by insulin resistance\nand concluded that \"insulin resistance syndrome\" was the\nappropriate name for this condition. At about the same\ntime, Reaven (5,6) agreed that insulin resistance was the\ncause of these abnormalities. He initially did not include\nabdominal obesity, however, and he used the term \"syn-\ndrome X.\" It appears that metabolic syndrome, insulin\nresistance syndrome, and syndrome X all refer to the same\nclustering of risk factors associated with atherosclerosis\nand coronary heart disease (CHD). In fact, Meigs et al. (7)\nfound that among nondiabetic subjects from the Framing-\nham Offspring Study, a clustering of risk factors, including\nhyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose\nintolerance (rather than hyperinsulinemia alone), charac-\nterized the underlying features of the insulin resistance\nsyndrome.\nThe pathophysiology of this syndrome remains a subject\nof continuing controversy, although some have suggested\na causal relationship with insulin resistance and/or vis-\nceral adiposity. At the same time, it has become increas-\ningly apparent that even small increases in fasting or\npostprandial glucose values (including impaired glucose\ntolerance or impaired fasting glucose) impart an increased\nrisk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (8\u00ad14). In\nthe Quebec Prospective Study, Lamarche et al. (15)\nshowed that even without hyperglycemia, elevated levels\nof insulin (i.e., insulin resistance), small dense LDL cho-\nlesterol, and apolipoprotein B were associated with risk\nfor ischemic heart disease.\nIn 2001, the National Cholesterol Education Program\n(NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III provided a defi-\nnition for metabolic syndrome (16). The NCEP criteria are\npractical for physicians to use, since the variables defining\nFrom 1Outcomes Research & Management, U.S. Medical & Scientific Affairs,\nMerck & Co., Inc., West Point, Pennsylvania; and the 2Department of Medi-\ncine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio,\nTexas.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Steven M.

Ford et al. (17) have previously shown that\nmetabolic syndrome is common in people 50 years of\nage. Since glucose intolerance is an important part of\nmetabolic syndrome and increases with age, this report\nwill focus on the interactions among metabolic syndrome,\nhyperglycemia, and prevalence of CHD. We used Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) data to evaluate the prevalence of CHD in\nindividuals 50 years of age with metabolic syndrome,\nwith and without diabetes, using the NCEP definition.\nNHANES III was conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in two phases: phase 1\nsurveyed during either phase are included. The survey was a stratified\nprobability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Afri-\ncan Americans, Mexican Americans, and the elderly were oversampled to\nprovide more accurate estimates of their characteristics within their respec-\ntive populations and the population as a whole. Each respondent was assigned\na weight based on geographic and demographic characteristics to allow the\ncalculation of population-based estimates. A subset of adults 50 years of age\nrepresenting 76.1 million Americans was used for this analysis.\nAn adult in-home questionnaire was administered to sampled subjects 17\nyears of age. Physical exams were conducted on those subjects who were\nambulatory and who consented to the examination given at a date subsequent\nto the in-home interview. Adults 50 years of age who were scheduled for and\nreceived morning physical exams after a fast of at least 9 h were retained for\nanalysis (n  3,510). During NHANES III, oral glucose tolerance testing was\nconducted on approximately one-half of the examinees aged 40\u00ad74 years. This\nsubsample most closely conformed to the World Health Organization criteria\nfor oral glucose tolerance testing to identify diabetes and was the population\nused to estimate the prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance.\nThe NCEP ATP III panel defined metabolic syndrome as the presence of\nthree or more of the following risk determinants: 1) increased waist circum-\nmg/dl in women); 4) hypertension (130/85 mmHg); and 5) impaired fasting\nWe determined the prevalence of metabolic syndrome based on fasting\nglucose levels and glucose tolerance and then stratified the population into\nfour groups (no metabolic syndrome or diabetes, metabolic syndrome without\ndiabetes, metabolic syndrome with diabetes, and no metabolic syndrome with\ndiabetes) using the NCEP definition of the metabolic syndrome and either\nself-reported history of diabetes or a fasting plasma glucose value 7.0 mmol/l\n(126 mg/dl) (16,20). Serum lipoproteins were evaluated as part of the blood\nbiochemistry panel of the laboratory exam. LDL cholesterol was calculated\nusing the Friedewald equation for those with serum triglyceride levels 400\nmg/dl (21). Blood pressure is reported as the average of six readings, three\ntaken during the household interview and three taken during the physical\nexam. The NCEP metabolic syndrome cutpoint for blood pressure is 130/85\nmm/Hg. Individuals reporting a history of hypertension and current blood\npressure medication use were defined as having hypertension regardless of\nmeasured blood pressure values. BMI was calculated as the weight of the\nindividual in kilograms divided by the square of the height in centimeters.\nIndividuals with a history of diabetes or glycemic medication use were defined\nas having diabetes regardless of measured fasting glucose values. Insulin\nmeasurements were performed using the Pharmacia Diagnostics radioimmu-\nnoassay kit. Insulin sensitivity was calculated using the formula of McAuley et\nmmol/l)] and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (23).\nAs a result of low prevalence of CHD in the population 50 years of age\nmetabolic syndrome clusters with age, we chose to focus our analysis on\nthose 50 years of age. Presence of CHD is defined as self-reported myocar-\ndial infarction or a positive response to the angina pectoris section of the Rose\nQuestionnaire (24). Our definition of CHD was based upon information\navailable in the NHANES III database, but probably represents an underesti-\nmate of the true prevalence. Defining CHD only as self-reported without\nincluding information from the Rose Questionnaire reduces the prevalence of\nCHD by 2\u00ad3% but does not otherwise change our results.\nStatistical analysis. All data were analyzed using SAS version 8e and\nSAS-callable SUDAAN version 8.0.1 (25,26). SUDAAN uses characteristics of\nthe sample design and sample weights to calculate appropriate estimates of\nvariance. The CROSSTAB and DESCRIPT procedures of SUDAAN were used\nto produce frequencies of categorical variables and means  SE of continuous\nvariables. Overall tests of significance across the four study groups were\nevaluated by ANOVA using the MULTILOG and REGRESS procedures.\nSummary statistics are presented as means  SE for continuous measures and\nfrequency percentage for all discrete measures. Age-adjusted CHD prevalence\nrates were computed by the direct method using the age distribution of the\nU.S. population based on the 2000 U.S. Census.\nFor Fig. 2, tests of significance were calculated using pairwise comparisons\nadjusted for multiple comparisons by the method of Bonferroni. A multivar-\niate logistic model predicting CHD was developed using the RLOGIST\nprocedure in SUDAAN. The independent variables of interest, the individual\nrisk factors of metabolic syndrome as defined by NCEP, diabetes, and an\nindicator variable for metabolic syndrome (a proxy for the interactions of the\nindividual factors) were fit simultaneously. The odds ratios and 95% CIs for\nhaving CHD given the presence of any one risk factor, controlling for all\nothers, are presented in Table 3.\nThe attributable risk of CHD was calculated as the difference in prevalence\nbetween the population without either diabetes or metabolic syndrome and\nthe appropriate group (i.e., metabolic syndrome without diabetes, diabetes\nwithout metabolic syndrome, diabetes and metabolic syndrome) divided by\nthe prevalence of CHD in the appropriate group.\nRESULTS\nAge-adjusted prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the\nU.S. population 50 years of age categorized by glucose\nintolerance is shown in Fig. 1. There is a stepwise increase\nin prevalence of metabolic syndrome with worsening\nglucose tolerance from 26% in those with normal fasting\nglucose rising to 86% in those with diabetes. As can be\nseen in Table 1, metabolic syndrome is very common in\nthe U.S. population over the age of 50 years, with 43.5%\nmeeting the NCEP criteria. In contrast, diabetes without\nmetabolic syndrome is uncommon in the over-50 popula-\ntion (only 13% of diabetic patients do not meet criteria\nfor metabolic syndrome).\nFor most cardiovascular risk factors, the group with\nFIG. 1.

An\nexception to this observation was HbA1c\nlevels, where the\ntwo diabetes groups were comparable. The two groups\nwithout metabolic syndrome were also very similar regard-\nless of absence or presence of diabetes. Insulin resistance\nwas highest and insulin sensitivity was lowest in the\ndiabetes with metabolic syndrome group (4.9  0.1),\nfollowed by the metabolic syndrome without diabetes\ngroup (5.5  0.1). Insulin resistance was lowest and insulin\nsensitivity was highest in the group without metabolic\nThe proportion of each group meeting each NCEP\ncriterion for metabolic syndrome is shown in Table 2.\nAgain, the characteristics of the two metabolic syndrome\ngroups are comparable with the exception of fasting\nglucose (by definition) and are different from the two\ngroups without metabolic syndrome.\nFigure 2 shows the age-adjusted prevalence of CHD in\nthe various groups. The overall prevalence in this age\ngroup was 11.7%. Americans over 50 years of age without\nmetabolic syndrome and diabetes had the lowest CHD\nprevalence (8.7%), and those with both metabolic syn-\ndrome and diabetes had the highest (19.2%). Individuals\nwith diabetes in the absence of metabolic syndrome did\nnot have an incremental increase in CHD prevalence\ncompared with individuals with neither (7.5 vs. 8.7%,\nrespectively). Differences between the groups, both overall\nand using pairwise comparisons, were all statistically\nNot surprisingly, metabolic syndrome was a significant\npredictor of prevalent CHD in univariate analysis (OR 2.07,\npressure, HDL cholesterol, and diabetes, but not presence\nof metabolic syndrome, were significant predictors of\nprevalent CHD in multivariate analyses.\nAs shown in Table 4, the excess prevalence of CHD\nattributable to metabolic syndrome and/or diabetes was\n37.4% (1.1 million cases of CHD) in the group with meta-\nbolic syndrome without diabetes and 50.3% (1.1 million\ncases of CHD) in the group with both metabolic syndrome\nand diabetes. The entire excess prevalence of CHD among\nthose with diabetes was in the group with both diabetes\nand metabolic syndrome.\nDISCUSSION\nThis analysis examined CHD prevalence by metabolic\nsyndrome criteria from the NCEP and diabetes status\nbased on 1997 American Diabetes Association criteria\nusing NHANES III, the most recent large clinical survey of\na representative sample of the U.S. population, which\ncollected all necessary information to characterize individ-\nDemographic and laboratory characteristics among U.S. population 50 years\nNo diabetes Diabetes\nP * Total\nNo metabolic\nsyndrome\nMetabolic\nsyndrome\nNo metabolic\nsyndrome\nMetabolic\nsyndrome\nFactor\nData are means  SE unless otherwise indicated. *Statistical significance of differences across the groups (ANOVA).

The prevalence of metabolic\nsyndrome increases with increasing glucose intolerance.\nThe prevalence of CHD markedly increases with the\npresence of metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of CHD\namong all participants with diabetes was increased com-\npared with the prevalence among those with metabolic\nsyndrome without diabetes. However, individuals with\ndiabetes without metabolic syndrome had about the same\nprevalence of CHD as those with neither.\nOne possible reason for the excess prevalence of CHD\nassociated with metabolic syndrome is the direct effect of\ninsulin resistance on the heart and arteries (27). It is more\nlikely that the bulk of the increased prevalence is mediated\nby known cardiovascular risk factors. Indeed, all five\nmetabolic syndrome criteria are established cardiovascu-\nlar risk factors. We know that the presence of multiple risk\nfactors confers increased risk (28). However, it is unclear\nwhether the metabolic syndrome confers elevated risk\nbeyond the sum of its parts (29). Our multivariate analysis\nwould suggest that the risk from metabolic syndrome is\nderived from its individual components, especially HDL\ncholesterol and blood pressure. However, modeling meta-\nbolic syndrome as the sole predictor of CHD yields more\nthan a twofold increased risk compared with not having\nmetabolic syndrome and is a convenient way to encapsu-\nlate a number of proven risk factors.\nIt has been argued that the excess prevalence of CHD\nseen in those with diabetes is directly associated with\nhyperglycemia. In our study, metabolic syndrome has been\ndemonstrated to be much more important, with no in-\ncrease in prevalence of CHD seen in people with diabetes\nin the absence of metabolic syndrome. Although one of the\ncomponents of metabolic syndrome is fasting hyperglyce-\nmia and many of the subjects in this study with metabolic\nsyndrome without diabetes still may have had hyperglyce-\nmia in the nondiabetic range, modestly increased glucose\nalone is unlikely to account for the increased CHD risk.\nBecause 1) most people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes\nand metabolic syndrome and 2) most individuals with\nimpaired fasting glucose also have metabolic syndrome,\nour work is consistent with our previous study using\nNHANES III data that showed an increased CHD preva-\nlence in those with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose\nThere are limitations to this analysis. Since the case\nfatality rate among people with diabetes is higher than in\nthose without diabetes, this cross-sectional study is sub-\nject to survival bias, which would underestimate the\nimpact of diabetes on CHD. The same may also be true for\nmetabolic syndrome in the absence of diabetes. The NCEP\ncriteria for metabolic syndrome have face validity, but\nhave not yet been formally validated or studied. Since\nNHANES III was a cross-sectional study, we cannot infer\ncausality from these associations. These results should be\nconsidered hypothesis-generating, which requires pro-\nspective studies among those with diabetes to demon-\nstrate if those without the metabolic syndrome indeed\nhave a lower cardiovascular risk than those with the\nsyndrome. More recent studies have shown that there is a\ncontinuing epidemic of diabetes and obesity and suggest\nthat NHANES III data, even adjusted for recent census\ndata, may be underestimating the prevalence of diabetes\nand metabolic syndrome (31).\nThe prevalence of CHD markedly increases with pres-\nence of metabolic syndrome. Among people with diabetes,\nprevalence of metabolic syndrome was very high, and\nthose with diabetes and metabolic syndrome had the\nhighest prevalence of CHD. Among all individuals with\ndiabetes, prevalence of CHD was increased compared to\nthose with metabolic syndrome without diabetes. How-\nFIG. 2.
