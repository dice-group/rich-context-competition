    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecent European studies present persistently critical views of the under performance of\ngovernment-backed venture capital (GVC) schemes when compared to their private sector\ncounterparts. However, they assess the performance of outmoded funding models and fail to\ncontextualise the economic development role of these schemes. This paper provides a\ncontemporary assessment of the business impacts of the UK government's flagship Enterprise\nCapital Funds VC scheme in addressing the sub-\u00a32 m equity finance gap facing young potential\nhigh-growth businesses requiring investments. Supply and demand-side evidence is presented\nfrom interviews with ECF fund managers, alternative private VCs, industry experts and surveys\nof successful and unsuccessful scheme applicants. We find that, despite the limitations of mid-\nscheme evaluation, Enterprise Capital Funds are addressing the UK equity gap and delivering\nbusiness employment, revenue and innovation impacts. However, further progress is required\nin order to achieve optimal business exits and sustainable early stage private VC system impacts.\n",

This phenomenon alongside recent large-scale data\nwhich cast questions over the value of GVC schemes (Grilli and Murtinu, 2014; Munari and\nToschi, 2015), makes it apposite to take a closer look at a major European GVC scheme.\nThis paper assesses the business impacts of the UK government's Enterprise Capital Funds\n(ECFs), the UK's foremost GVC scheme addressing the equity finance gap facing young,\npotential, high-growth, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) requiring investments\nup to \u00a32m. Established in 2006, ECFs have received \u00a3840m UK government investment,\nincluding a \u00a3400m three-year extension tranche announced in Autumn 2014,1 thus far\ncreating 18 rolling 10 year limited life funds. As Lerner (2002) and Tokila and Haapanen\n(2009) suggest, scheme assessment should consider its aims and objectives, whilst Greene\n(2009) highlights the need for thorough mixed methods approaches to more fully\nunderstand the impacts. The ECF has a dual rationale to plug the early stage finance gap\nand develop potential high-growth SMEs, and to stimulate the creation of new early stage VC\nfunds, providing demonstration effects that encourage other private VCs into early stage\ninvestment, developing a sustainable VC ecosystem in the UK. Whilst the second aim meets\nLerner's (2010) requirement for GVCs to catalyse private sector VC ecosystems and withdraw,\nthis paper focuses on how the ECF model impacts on businesses, addressing Colombo et al.\n(2014) in examining how effective the design of contemporary GVC funds are.\nThe paper draws on empirical interim ECF evaluation demand and policy supply-side\nevidence in early 2014, including ECF fund managers, other contemporary UK seed and early\nstage risk equity financiers and views from the wider business support services ecosystem. The\nfocus is on a survey of 75 SMEs assisted by ECFs, since their inception in 2006, examining\nthe evolving design and approach of the ECFs and their impacts on business development. This\nspans a period immediately prior to the GFC during which the first `pathfinder' group of eight\nECFs were established, between 2006 and 2008, and post the onset of the GFC when the newer\nThe paper initially summarises the theoretical context relating to GVC policy\nintervention, scheme design, and the evolution of the ECFs, before presenting the\nmethodology and key ECF business impact findings. It concludes by discussing the\nfindings and considering how ECFs might achieve their longer-term aim of establishing a\nsustainable seed and early stage UK private sector-led VC market.\nTheoretical context\nGVC theories can be defined as predominantly supply-side relating to the rationale for\ngovernment intervention, addressing an equity gap and developing a VC ecosystem (Lerner's,\n2010 vision of developing professional VC support services), and the related design and\nimplementation of schemes, addressing the fit for purpose question. Demand side theories\nrelate to the entrepreneurial ecosystem and whether there is an adequate supply of suitable\nyoung investible potential high-growth businesses (Mason and Brown's enterprise pipeline, 2013).\nSupply side rationale\nThe rationale for government support to young potential high-growth businesses is\npredicated on the certification hypothesis, suggesting that policies can pick winners, or in\nthe case of co-funded public\u00adprivate investment schemes, can pick winning partners (Baldock\nand Mason, 2014) who can affectively select businesses and assist growth that would\notherwise not take place. Colombo et al. (2014) also find that government funding may\nsignal quality to other private investors, generating a crowding-in effect. Since potential\nhigh-growth firms are associated with innovation, revenue and job generation (Audretsch,\nthrough development of high value export products and services (HM Treasury and BIS,\n2011), GVC schemes have come to the fore in the post GFC period (Wilson and Silva, 2013),\nparticularly focusing on seed and early stage development where external financing for these\nbusinesses appears most problematic.\n\u00a35m today, the evidence is that the gap relating to entrepreneurial risk finance varies in\nintensity and scale over time, as demand and supply alter, with supply-side intervention\n(2012) define the equity gap as between the upper limits of business angel finance and the\nminimum capital requirement for the public equity market, considered to range from\n2007). By the late 2000s, evidence of the trend for private VCs to retreat to later stage\ninvestments suggested that the gap had extended beyond \u00a32 m to over \u00a310 m (Rowlands,\nthe supply of business angel finance suggested that the gap was also encroaching into the\nThe finance gap is caused by market imperfections (Modigliani and Miller, 1958) with\ninformation asymmetries considered a major cause (Akerlof, 1970; Myers and Majluf, 1984)\ndue to the unequal knowledge exchange between financiers and businesses. This is particularly\nproblematic for young high-growth potential businesses without track records to demonstrate\ntheir market traction and value, and often lacking sufficient collateral with their true value\nbeing associated with intangible intellectual property (IP) (Hsu, 2004). These businesses\nrequire risk equity finance, but face problems of adverse selection and moral hazard\n(Carpenter and Peterson, 2002) resulting from the prohibitively high cost of due diligence\nfor relatively small\u00adscale seed and early stage investments and reflected in the resultant\npoor performance of these equity markets in recent years (BVCA, 2013; Mason et al., 2010).\nThe temporal changes in the supply of finance are captured in the finance escalator model\n(Nesta, 2009a), which incorporates Berger and Udell's (1998) concept of declining\ninformation opacity of young firms as they progress through the business development\ncycle. This suggests that as businesses develop and gain market traction, a different and\nwider range of finance (debt and equity) become available. The escalator model can be used\nto demonstrate finance gaps and pinpoint where GVCs can make most impact (Baldock and\nColombo et al. (2014) raise one further important market failure hypothesis that GVCs can\naddress social pay-offs and externalities that private transactions take no account of. They\nview this as contentious, requiring careful attention to scheme design and context, since it may\ntypically take place in peripheral, less favoured thin markets and can lead to underperforming\ninvestments and crowding out of private investors (Armour and Cumming, 2006).\nEcosystem and demand side theories\nThe development of a more efficient seed and early stage financing escalator, is pyramidal,\nbased on a sufficient pipeline supply of young investible businesses (Mason and Brown, 2013;\nMason and Pierrakis, 2013). This requires a carefully integrated policy to develop the VC\nand equity finance and entrepreneurial ecosystems (Hughes, 2009; Hwang and Horowitt,\n2012), taking into account both the supply-side mechanism and also the potential demand-\nside failures in relation to investment readiness (Mason and Kwok, 2010).\nFrom a supply-side perspective, Hall and Lerner (2010) find that private VCs can address\nfunding gaps, overcoming information asymmetries, adverse selection and moral hazard\nthrough their screening, monitoring and management support processes. However, in an\nunder-developed market where there are gaps in VC investment, Colombo et al. (2014)\nsuggest that GVC can attract, train, nurture, and raise the quality and volume of private\nVC. Lerner (2010) finds it essential for GVC schemes to attract skilled private investors and\nembed an early stage VC investment culture and support service network (e.g. specialist\naccountants, lawyers, advisors).\nFrom the demand side, developing the resource based knowledge of small firm\nalongside broadening the pecking order financial preferences of entrepreneurs (Myers and\nMajluf, 1984; Norton, 1991) and tackling signalling issues which may particularly affect the\nability of entrepreneurs in more peripheral areas to find and obtain equity funding (Amini\net al., 2012; Mueller et al., 2014). Whilst this paper focuses on the supply-side, the extent of\nintermediary knowledge and visibility of ECFs to entrepreneurs is discussed.\nDesign theories\nThere would appear to be a strong justification for public policy intervention in order to\naddress market failure, but policy interventions require careful consideration of potential\n2009) which may result from agency failures (Akerlof, 1976) from poor management and\npolicy making. In recent times, there has been a proliferation of GVC design theories,\ndrawing on global experiences in searching for the holy grail of an established private\nsector-led early stage finance market which addresses the equity gap (e.g. Cumming, 2011,\ndifferent institutional environments (Florida and Kenney, 1988), very few GVC schemes\nThe most successful in terms of developing early stage private VC investment and generating\nsuccessful exits have been the US Small Business Investment Company (established 1958),\nIsraeli Yozma funds (established, 1993), and Australian Innovation Investment Fund\n(established, 1997). Many more recently established funds have not had sufficient time for\nproper assessment.\nAn extensive review of GVC studies suggests that the more successful schemes are private\nVC led, attract co-investment, inward investment and experienced VCs who up-skill local\nVCs over time, are time limited but extendable to facilitate optimal exit timing, monitor, and\nadjust to changing market requirements, have sufficient scale of funding and target market,\nremain focused and avoid mission creep, and operate within a wider supportive\nentrepreneurial and financing ecosystem which takes into account exit market\nopportunities. These points are developed below.\nFirst, Murray (2007) recognised GVC schemes' shift towards private sector-led `hybrid'\nco-funding arrangements, which Colombo et al. (2014) characterise as a shift from direct\nfunding which might require private match funding (e.g. Finnish Industry Investment's\ndirect funding to businesses) to private VC-led co-funding (e.g. the UK ECFs) or fund of\nfund structures (e.g. UK Innovation Investment Fund). Lerner (2002) questioned the\nlegitimacy of government officials running funding schemes, noting the potential for\npolitical distortion and propping up favoured businesses. By the end of the decade,\nLerner (2010) strongly advocated a private sector-led approach investing in viable\nbusinesses. He highlights the Israeli Yozma funds3 and their ability to attract foreign\ninvestment and skilled fund managers to provide a demonstrator effect for other private\nfund managers to follow. A key part of the private sector-led approach is the ability to\nleverage co-investment funding from the private sector, increasing fund size and engendering\na private sector investment dynamic. Recent large data European (Grilli and Murtinu, 2014)\nand UK (Munari and Toschi, 2015) studies point to the importance of experienced hands-on\nprivate sector fund managers and support the view that successful VCs have niche ``hard to\nimitate'' knowledge of sectors and stages (BIS, 2011) and are persistent performers who build\nSecond, that government intervention should add value to the market (Wallsten, 2000)\nand withdraw when its job is complete in order to avoid private sector reliance and crowding\nout (Lerner, 2010). In this respect, Lerner strongly advocates time limited schemes (e.g. the\n10-year Limited Partnership (LP) model) driven by private sector performance dynamics\nwhich avoid evergreen fund pitfalls of persistently funding poor performing portfolio\nbusinesses, as exhibited in Murray et al.'s (2009) GVC review of Finland. Lerner et al.\n(2005) acknowledge that achieving this performance balance requires regular monitoring\nto avoid counter arguments that private sector-led GVC potentially cherry pick the best\ncompany investments, crowd out the private sector, distort and inflate market valuations,\nand fail to address wider economic development objectives, such as regional development\nThird, the required size and scale of GVC activity is widely debated. UK and European\nVC funds have been dwarfed by their US counterparts; US funds distribute over five times\nthe value from less than four times the number of funds (Ernst and Young, 2010). The\nimplication is that UK GVC funds have insufficient scale to achieve Markowitz's (1952)\nportfolio size optimisation. Technopolis (2011) European VC report recommended that\nfunds require sufficient size to follow-on invest in their best portfolio companies and\navoid forced early exits at sub-optimal value, suggesting a minimum fund size of \u00a340 m\nfor a seed or early stage VC. In this respect, the ability of GVCs to achieve timely fund\ncycle development, raising investment for second funds (Gompers and Lerner, 2001), is\ncrucial and appears to have been badly hampered across Europe by declining early stage\ninvestment post GFC (Dittmer et al., 2014). Dittmer et al. (2014) also suggest that a possible\nsolution to European GVC scale is to operate across borders on a pan-European scale, as\nevidenced by the UK Innovation Investment Fund (BIS, 2012).\nFourth, GVC funds require a wide enough focus to meet a sufficiently good pipeline of\ninvestible businesses. Reports on the failings of UK (NAO, 2009) and Finnish (Murray et al.,\n2009) regional GVC funds highlight their being too small in scale and narrowly focused into\nregions to generate sufficient critical mass of investment and returns. This suggests that funds\nwhich are sector- or stage-specific are likely to locate in high density clusters, such as\nLondon's Tech City seed VCs, or to syndicate and work with other VCs and investors\nsuch as the recently emerging angel capital groups (Baldock and Mason, 2015) in order to\nfacilitate inter-regional and international investments (Hopp, 2010; Hopp and Rieder, 2011).\nFifth, GVC schemes require a long-term minimum 10-year view (Lerner, 2010) with\nflexibility to extend further. Whilst Lerner advocates regular monitoring to ensure that\nfunds are performing their intended roles and to avoid mission creep to safer later stage\ninvestments (Gill, 2015; Murray et al., 2009), it is equally important that government avoids\nmicro managing and allows GVC funds to develop over sufficient time. The trend towards a\ndoubling in early stage VC portfolio exit timetables, from around four years in the early 2000s\nto around eight years post GFC (Axelson and Martinovic, 2012; Baldock and North, 2016,\nto whether 10-year LP GVCs will be able to allow their portfolio firms to fully mature and avoid\nearly sales and potential share value dilution. Mason and Brown (2013) point to the importance\nof an exit market, for trade sales and initial public offerings (IPOs) (Baldock, 2015) in delivering\nblockbuster VC exits which will lead to recycled funds and new private VC entry.\nFinally, GVC operates within a holistic entrepreneurial financing ecosystem which\nsupports enterprise development and appropriate funding supply (Hughes, 2009). From\nthe VC scheme design perspective, Lerner (2010) stresses the importance of developing\nsupport and promotional networks, making them visible and accessible, linking different\ntypes of finance and financial intermediaries and avoiding duplication. This emphasises the\numbrella role of state investment banks such as the German KfW4 in operating technology\nfunds (Grunderfonds) and managing the evolving finance escalator, highlighting the role that\nthe new British Business Bank can play in achieving this in the UK (Breedon, 2012;\nThe role of ECFs\nThe ECFs, introduced in 2006, mark an important advance in UK GVC schemes, notably\nthe previous small-scale public-led Regional Venture Capital Funds (Colombo et al., 2014).\nThey represent a significant increase in the size and scale of funding and a concerted effort to\ndeliver private VC-led co-investment funds.\nBetween 2000 and 2012, the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) placed\nleverage of 0.5 \u00c2 which was set to rise to almost 1 \u00c2 during the lifetime of the current\nschemes. Increased private funding leverage results from the increase in co-funding schemes\n(Murray, 2007), mainly relating to the ECFs, UK Innovation Investment Fund (UKIIF)5\nand Angel Co-investment Fund (ACF), all designed to stimulate private sector investment to\nincrease fund size and generate a private sector-led fund performance dynamic (Lerner, 2010).\nFrom establishment, the ECFs have had two main objectives:6 first, to provide gap\nfunding for potential high-growth SMEs, mainly in seed and early stage development\nrequiring \u00a3250,000 to \u00a32 m; second, to provide a demonstration model for early stage\ninstitutional VCs, by establishing a UK early stage VC ecosystem and encouraging new\nprivate fund managers into the market, effectively addressing recommendations for\nprivate sector-led public funds (Lerner et al., 2005). These key objectives have not\nchanged over time, although the individual funding models have evolved with greater\nfocus from 2010 on seed and earlier stage VC.\nThe funds require a minimum of one third private investment, restricting private\nindividual investment to 50% of the private funding contribution to broaden the private\ninvestment base. They are not pari passu (as favoured by EU schemes), offering an up-side\npriority private investor return7 to encourage improved fund management performance, as\nfavoured by Lerner et al. (2005) and Jaaskelainen et al. (2007) to encourage competent early\nstage private investors. The funds are formed under 10-year Limited Partnership (LP) status,\nwith options to extend up to 12 years, a feature which complies with Lerner's (2010)\nrequirements for GVCs to have flexibility to enable maximisation of their portfolio exits.\nThe UK government provided \u00a3240 m in 2006 for the initial eight pathfinder ECFs,\nrise in the scale of ECF funding continues the trend in increasing UK GVC scheme funding\nsince 2000. It demonstrated the UK government's commitment to develop the seed and early\nstage VC market and followed negotiations leading to the EU's January 2014 increase in the\nstate aid limit (EC, 2014a) from \u00a32 m to \u00a35 m on initial investments into portfolio companies,\nalongside increasing follow-on funding to 15mE capped at 15% of fund value (rising from\n10%) and with the public funding limit doubling to \u00a350 m for individual funds. This scaling-\nup meets the recommendations for larger scale European funds to adequately facilitate\nfollow-on funding and optimise business growth and exit values achieved (Rigos, 2011;\nECF funds have increased in scale over time (Table 1), rising from an average \u00a326.875 m\nfor the eight pathfinder funds to \u00a341.075 m for the eight second tranche funds, reaching the\nscale recommended by Technopolis (2011) for a sustainable GVC funding cycle. The funds\nare individual, mainly serving the seed and early stage UK VC markets, and include\ngeneralist sector agnostic and specialist sector funds, notably in technology and IT. A\nfeature is the concentration of 16 out of 18 funds with headquarters within the London-\nOxbridge triangle, being drawn to the traditional bedrock of UK new technology companies,\nwith only three funds having offices in other regions covering the East Midlands and\nScotland. To some extent, this is off-set by the presence of European Regional\nDevelopment Fund regional VC funds, with a particularly strong presence in the North\nWales (\u00a3150 m).8 The ECFs, with the exception of the more recent Notion fund, which has\nadditional European Investment Fund (EIF) investment, operate under the former EU state\naid limit of \u00a32 m maximum initial investment into individual portfolio companies, with an\noverall limit on follow-on funding of 10% of fund value in any one portfolio company. This\nlevel of funding appears more suited to shorter horizon digitech investment (Baldock et al.,\n2015; North et al., 2013) and is likely to be insufficient for long horizon capital intensive\nR&D investment sectors such as life science (Rowlands, 2009; SQW Consulting, 2009) and\nunderpins the 2014 increase in EU state aid limits on follow-on funding.\nThere is further evidence of scheme evolution to adjust to changing post GFC market\nrequirements. The second tranche of ECFs, since 2010, contains innovative features designed\nto enhance their impacts. These include the Notion fund being able to invest beyond the \u00a32 m\nstate aid limit in European companies, with a minimum investment requirement into UK-\nbased companies aligned to the UK government's investment, which is similar to the\noperation of the pan national UKIIF, supporting Lerner's (2010) globalisation of VC\nthesis and that specialist sector-based funds can operate on a more effective scale if they\nare international (Dittmer et al., 2014). There is also avoidance of the RVCFs' regional\nNottinghamshire businesses, receiving a bonus for local investments, but is also able to\ninvest in other parts of the UK in order to ensure a suitably sized and balanced portfolio.\nGreater focus is given to seed and early stage investment in the second tranche ECFs,\nfollowing Lerner et al.'s (2005) recommendations that schemes have to be flexible to\nadapt to the market's requirements, which in the UK post GFC saw a sharp decline in\nseed and early stage investing (BVCA, 2013). The London-based Passion seed fund operates\nas an accelerator in order to maximise portfolio funding opportunities and minimise due\ndiligence costs. This pure seed fund operates at well below the typical \u00a3250,000 lower\ninvestment of most ECFs, focusing on seed and earlier stage syndication investments to\nspread risk and make investments more attractive to later stage VCs (Hopp, 2010). It has\nprovided a seed funding model in London that other private VCs and angel capital groups\nare following (e.g. EC1, Connect Ventures, Playfair Capital).\nA feature of the ECFs has been their stretch-funding provision to new fund managers.\nThis has attracted highly skilled European and US fund manager investors, enabling\ncapacity building of the sector in the UK and potential to achieve the funding scale\nrequired to create a lasting scheme legacy, following Lerner et al.'s (2005) inward\ninvestment investor skills recommendation. An important element of this VC development\ncycle is generation of second funds (Gompers and Lerner, 2001) that can build on the initial\nECFs, providing further scale-up and ability for substantial follow-on funding to the best\nFund name Date closed Size Sector/Stage Location\nGeneral Technology\nSustainable Technology Partnership 2006 \u00a330 m Early stage London\nCleantech\nAmadeus and Angels 2006 \u00a310 m Seed stage to Series A Cambridge/London\nSeed Fund General Technology\nGeneral Technology\nGrowth & MBO Generalist\nMelton Mowbray/\nBirmingham\nTech/Software\nSoftware/ E-commerce\nManagement Science/Technology\nGeneralist\nCloud Computing/\nSoftware as a Service\nLongwall Ventures ECFa 2012 \u00a340 m Early stage Engineering/ Oxford\nScience/ Technology\nForesight Nottingham 2013 \u00a340 m Early/Growth stage Nottingham\nFund Generalist\nDigitech\nEarly Stage Fund General Technology\nRegents Park Partners II 2014 \u00a330 m Early stage software London\nTechnology/B2B\nNote: Stages are adapted from BVCA (2013).

Notably, thus far, the scheme has seen just four second\nfunds created (Table 1) and these have taken six to eight years to appear after the first funds,\nwhich may have resulted in some portfolio company funding shortfalls (examined later).\nOver time, the ECF scheme aims to establish a sustainable private seed and early stage VC\nmarket in the UK and then withdraw (as advocated by Lerner, 2010). However, the absence\nof blockbuster exits, due to the poor exit markets in the post GFC period, has prevented\nrecycling of investment funds and signalling of widespread encouragement of private VCs\ninto these markets (Mason and Brown, 2013). As such there is no evidence of the scheme\nwithdrawing and it is likely to have an increasing presence in follow-on investments\nupstream into the `series A-B' later phases in order to generate optimal exits (as predicted\nApproach and methodology\nThis paper uses a pragmatic mixed methods approach (Patton, 1990). Whilst predominately\nbased on a demand-side quantitative cross-sectional survey of 75 ECF-assisted businesses, it\nalso incorporates elements of longitudinal demand-side survey and qualitative case studies,\nqualitative supply-side perspectives from VC fund managers and industry stakeholders, and\nsecondary scheme and industry data (outlined in Table 2). The aim is to provide a rounded\nand triangulated analysis which provides insightful findings (Creswell, 2003).\nSecondary data review included ECF scheme data (2006\u00ad2013) provided by the British\nBusiness Bank and contextual parallel timescale VC industry data from the UK and Europe,\ndrawn from the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) and Preqin's private European\nVC data set. The ECF desk study relates to 166 businesses funded through the first 12 funds\noperational by the end of 2013. Additionally, surveys were undertaken in February 2014\nwith assisted and unassisted applicant businesses, ECF fund managers, other UK seed and\nearly stage investors, and industry stakeholders to provide triangulation of robust supply-\nside and demand-side data (Brewer and Hunter, 1989). A caveat is the interim, largely cross-\nsectional, nature of the research, at a stage when even the older funds operating for up to\neight years have yet to experience their plum stellar exits, which typically take place later\n(Wiltbank, 2005). However, it has been possible to obtain a highly representative sample of\nboth demand- and supply-side data and cross section of stakeholder viewpoints.\nA survey of 75 ECF recipient businesses, covering 12 active funds representing 45% of the\nscheme's portfolio businesses, was undertaken using CATI recorded telephone interviews9\nwith senior managers. Surveyed businesses were randomly selected being restricted only by\nsurvey time frame constraints and requests from fund managers that portfolio businesses\nthat had exited, closed or were undergoing exits should be excluded (representing\n30 recipients). There were also 23 refusals, with the owner-managers of the remaining\n38 businesses being unobtainable for interview within the survey time period of four\nweeks in February 2014. Representativeness tests, Mann\u00adWhitney two-tailed tests, reveal\nno significant differences by sector, stage and region between the overall and surveyed\nsamples, noted in Table 2. Stage analysis adopted in the study complies with the standard\nBVCA definitions (Appendix 1), adopted by the British Business Bank. Survey piloting on\nfive businesses ensured effective questioning and routing (Patton, 1990). Interviews took\n30 minutes on average, covering a series of mainly closed pre-coded questions,\nsupplemented by strategic open questions to explore explanations and processes.\nQuestions addressed are: business profile (e.g. employment size, sector, stage, location);\nexternal financing history and requirements; reasons for seeking ECF; ECF leverage,\nadditionality, displacement and attribution to post funding business performance (HM\nTreasury, 201310); exit timetables and strategies. Additionally, five case studies were\nundertaken with failed ECF business write-downs, and supplementary counterfactual data\nare drawn from short telephone interviews with five `dead deals' where applicants did not\nreceive ECF finance.\nLongitudinal telephone survey work was undertaken with eight surviving ECF recipient\nbusinesses between 2010 and 2013 (representing one fifth of the ECF business portfolio in\n2010) and benchmarking reference is made to the BIS (2010) early assessment survey of\nIn parallel, in early 2014, supply-side interviews were undertaken face-to-face or\nby telephone with fund managers at all 14 current ECFs11 (including two new funds yet\nto invest), using a semi-structured interview approach. These were supplemented by\n13 interviews with other private VC, Venture Capital Trust (VCT) and angel capital\ngroup fund managers operating in the UK seed and early stage equity markets along with\nsix interviews with industry stakeholder experts including the BVCA, UK Business Angel\nAssociation (UKBAA), European Investment Fund (EIF), and St John's Innovation Centre,\nCambridge.

Comparing first the overall scheme data (n \u00bc 166) with BVCA\nmember VC investment data (averaged over three years, 2010\u00ad2012, to avoid annual skew),\nit is clear that ECFs are considerably more focused on seed and early stage VC investment\n(65% compared to 38%) in meeting the private sector VC gap in the UK market. ECF's are\nalso contributing to rebalancing the UK economy with 35% of investments in industrial\nsectors (e.g. advanced manufacturing, electrical engineering), but are comparatively\nunderrepresented in the health sector. ECFs relatively high proportion of investments in\ndigitech sectors (e.g. mobile applications and Internet-based activities) suggest a preference\nfor shorter horizon investing (almost half of ECF investments relate to technology/\ntelecommunications and consumer services, above the BVCA investors' 41%). ECF\ninvestments are also even more concentrated into the London-Oxbridge triangle (London,\nSouth East and East of England regions) than the BVCA investors (68% compared to 61%).\nThis reflects the UK's concentrations of high tech innovative businesses and VC financing\n(Mason and Pierrakis, 2013), but also the operation of regional GVCFs in Scotland, Wales\nand North of England (Baldock and Mason, 2015).\nAt the time of initial funding, the 75 surveyed recipient businesses were typically small\n(median 15 employees) and pre or early trading. Funding was mainly sought for R&D, early\ncommercialisation, key staff recruitment (mainly R&D technicians and sales staff), and\nworking capital to fund growth (Table 4). One quarter referred to start-up capital\nrequirements, and overall the reasons for seeking ECF finance were heavily influenced by\nthe earlier stage requirements of the assisted businesses, with only one in 12 surveyed\nbusinesses seeking funding for later stage acquisitions and management buy-outs/ins \u00ad\nthese mainly coming from the earlier pathfinder funds with later stage focus. The\nbusinesses typically described themselves as classical `gap funding' candidates: Too early\nstage for institutional and corporate VC funding and requiring too much funding for\nindividual angels or angel networks to fund.\nECF investments cover seed and more substantive early stage `series A' and `B' rounds,\nranging from \u00a320,000 seed investment to a share of a \u00a39 m `series B' early commercialisation\nround, with a mean of \u00a3964,000, and supplying 90% of the amount applied for. Average\nECF shareholdings were 19%, ranging from 4% to 60%, reflecting the high proportion of\nearly stage investments where business valuations were relatively low. The shift towards seed\nand earlier stage investment by post 2010 ECFs has resulted in average recipient business\nHalf of the surveyed recipients applied for alternative funding immediately prior to their\nECF application. This was proportionally lower amongst post GFC recipients (42%\ncompared to 59% pre GFC), suggesting increasing scarcity of suitable alternative\nfinancing. They mainly approached equity sources, with half accepting offers. A further\none in 10 (seven cases) rejected offers, preferring the fund managers and growth\nopportunities ECF offered. Some managers suggested ``alternative early stage corporate\nVC would be restrictive in terms of product and market development'' stressing the ``meeting\nof minds'' required for equity investment (Baldock et al., 2015). Only 7% applied for bank\nfinance, none since 2010. It was mainly ``out of the question'', as the businesses were too\nrisky, being early stage without a trading track record of at least two years.\nAlthough ECFs are not required to lever additional private funding, their initial\ninvestments typically represented half of the overall funding round. Just 2% was\nduplicative, where managers considered additional funds were raised ``instead of ECF'',\nratio rose to parity, mainly through angel and VCs syndication for very early stage\ninvestments, supporting Hopp (2010) and Hopp and Rieder's (2011) syndication thesis.\nTable 3.

Most (75%) would seek\ninstititional VC and private equity, but around one-third will seek further ECF funding,\ndue to insufficient trading record or profitability to attract debt or private equity finance. A\nclear benefit of ECF involvement was that 92% of the managers were more confident in their\nability to raise future finance.\nPost GFC, ECF fund managers are making far greater provision for retaining sufficient\nfunds to provide follow-on funding for their better performing portfolio businesses. This is\nparticularly evident amongst more recently established seed and early stage ECFs. Notably,\nPassion Capital's accelerator model initially invests small amounts into a large number of\nbusinesses, holding back funds to enable follow-on funding of more substantial size\ninvestments to better portfolio business performers, conforming to Markowitz' (1952)\nprinciples. However, ECFs have been hampered by EU state aid restrictions, particularly\nthe 10% of fund size limit on individual portfolio business investments. This has resulted in\none in 10 surveyed recipient businesses being ``considerably constrained '' in raising follow-on\nfunding, supporting recommendations for larger more flexible GVC funds (Rigos, 2011;\nAdditionality or displacement?\nFund managers and stakeholders unanimously agree that ECFs play an important role in\naddressing the UK's sub-\u00a32 m seed and early stage equity gap. There is little evidence of\nfunding displacement as few institutional VCs or VCTs operate at below \u00a32 m (Table 5) in\nthe early stage UK market, typically specialising in expansion and MBO/MBI activities.\nExceptions include a few emerging seed VCs in London and Octopus VCT, a specialist early\nstage investor.12 London (GLA, 213) has witnessed recent growth of seed investment\nTable 4.

However, the consensus was that, whilst London's seed digitech market\nshowed signs of overheating, demand still outstripped supply (GLA, 2013), with `smart\nmoney' ECF fund managers' expertise providing an important demonstration approach\nThe surveyed ECF businesses (Table 6) exhibit high levels of project additionality, but\nlower levels of funding additionality. This replicates other UK GVC scheme assessments,\nwith fund managers suggesting that their portfolio businesses typically overestimate their\nfundraising ability (BIS, 2010, 2012). Whilst just one quarter of surveyed managers\nconsidered that their ECF project would not have gone ahead without scheme funding,\nthree-fifths believe that obtaining alternative funding would have caused considerable\ndelays (typically 6\u00ad12 months), or project downscaling due to underfunding. Delays\nreaching the market could severely jeopardise the ultimate success of the business, as\nindicated in other early stage business finance studies (BIS, 2012; North et al., 2013).\nThe choice of VC and fund manager, or angel investor is also crucial in achieving a\n``meeting of minds'' alignment of business development aims and appropriate level of\ninput into areas such as financial management, sales and marketing including export\nmarket developments, networking contacts and linkages to further funding (Baldock\net al., 2015). This supports the Gompers et al. (2010) postulation of better performing\nVCs possessing niche management and sector skills to deliver successful investment\noutcomes. Conversely, our five case studies of ECF write-off investments demonstrate\nthat a breakdown in the entrepreneur \u00ad fund manager relationship is a key factor in failure.\nFund performance: interim assessment limitations\nInterim assessments may occur too soon to adequately assess fund performance. Wiltbank\n(2005) recognised early exit sales are often poorer performing `lemons', whilst `plum' best\nperformers typically take far longer to exit. Lerner (2010) also advocates a patient, long\ngame, approach which fund manager feedback supported. First, the top performing 10% of\n10 \u00c2 plus investment multiple portfolio companies which determine the overall success of\nfunds can take 10 years to mature. Second, the GFC typically set back older portfolio\ninvestments by two years, lengthening average exit times to 5\u00ad7 years, a finding supported\nby Baldock and North's (2016, forthcoming) UK GVC longitudinal study14 and CfEL's15\n(2013) fund managers report. This underlines the need for flexible fund management\ntimescales (Lerner, 2010) and favours the VCT and ACF evergreen approaches over\nECFs' LP agreements.\nGFC impacts meant that older, pre-2010 ECF fund managers, initially aiming for at least\n3 \u00c2 multiples now recognised they would do well to achieve between 2 and 3 \u00c2 . Most would\nTable 5.

Internal rate of return (IRR) data fell below\nexpectations, supporting the view that, even after 6\u00ad8 years, it was still too early to\nadequately evaluate fund performance. Benchmarking against Preqin's16 equivalent aged\nEuropean private VC funds offered limited value since these were self-reported,\npotentially by the better performing, faster maturing, later stage focused funds. BVCA\nmember data revealed a median negative return on investment (\u00c01.1%) for 38 funds\nInvestment Bank's (SIB) portfolio of 378 companies, including the slightly older\nestablished (2004) Scottish Co-investment Fund17 indicated similarly small numbers of\nthe need for more time for funds to mature after the GFC. Indeed, each ECF fund\nmanager forecast one or two portfolio companies that could achieve 10 \u00c2 multiples, but\nthese exit returns would not be taking place for several years.\nEconomic outputs\nMore satisfactory economic development evidence came from the survey of current portfolio\nbusiness performance outputs and projections, the fund managers' caveat being that\nportfolio business managers' projections are optimistic and rarely achieved (BIS, 2010,\n2012). Table 6 compares the actual performance of the 75 surveyed ECF recipient\nbusinesses since initial funding until the time of interview in early 2014. Figures in\nparenthesis represent those businesses funded since 2010, where it is helpful to contrast\nTable 6.

Aggregate jobs include full-time and part-time employees\ntheir performance with the overall survey. The table provides key economic impact insights\nfor policymakers relating to employment, income generation, innovation, and scheme\nattribution. Data come from a compliant survivor subset, but positive and negative\nresponse bias is likely to be controlled by the omission of successful exits and\nunsuccessful write-offs and the highly significant (>.05 level) representativeness of the\nsurvey sample (Table 3).\nSurveyed managers assessed their ECF funding attribution to subsequent business\ndevelopment (59%) as proportionally greater than its financial contribution to external\nproject funding received (49% for the relevant funding round). This suggests that ECF\ninvestment generated at least a 10% net positive catalytic impact on business development\n(i.e. jobs, sales, profits, innovation) to date (this could be higher if follow-on funding was\nsubsequently received from other sources). The lower attribution proportion (46%), but\nhigher positive net impact (14%), amongst ECF recipients since 2010 reflects newer ECFs'\nincrease in syndication (spreading investment risk and increasing investor skills) producing\nlower proportional ECF funding contribution in seed and early investment rounds post\nmedian additional funding of \u00a3550,000 (a 1:2 ratio of newer ECF to other external\nfunding, compared with the overall scheme ratio of 1:1).\nOverall, in terms of both aggregate sales turnover and employment growth since receiving\ninitial scheme funding, surveyed ECF recipients performed well, with employment almost\ndoubling (\u00fe85%) and sales turnover approaching trebling (\u00fe170%). For the newer ECF\nrecipients (post 2010), the relatively lower increase in sales turnover (\u00fe64%), but higher\nincrease in employment (\u00fe138%) is indicative of their smaller size (average 5 employees at\ntime of funding) and younger trading age (81% trading less than four years). Almost three\nquarters (74%) of new employment has been full-time in both older and newer ECFs with\nscheme attribution to new job generation particularly high (83%), representing an average of\n8.5 jobs per surveyed business. A key spillover impact was the rapid parallel growth\n(\u00fe231%) in contract labour (e.g. IT, technical production, sales and manufacturing jobs)\ndemonstrating, alongside 26% growth in new part-time employment, the flexible labour\nrequirements of these businesses to facilitate growth (North et al., 2013). Notably, the\nvast majority of contract work was UK-based.\nProfitability proved more complex to measure as older ECF recipients were taking longer to\ngain market traction than originally planned. ECF fund managers noted that traditional `J' curve\nincreases in profitability were not yet occurring, with the vast majority of portfolio businesses still\nlanguishing in a deep valley of R&D and early commercialisation pre-profit activities.\nThe vast majority of surveyed ECF businesses (93%) had increased their level of innovation\nsince funding, including new and improved products, services, marketing, and processes.\nSimilarly, 93% experienced management improvements, with 74% improving work practices.\nECF fund managers have introduced improved corporate and financial management and\nstrengthened portfolio management teams, either through their board presence as NEDs, or\nby selective board appointments, notably in sales and marketing. These findings support\nassertions that VCs can add value to the performance of their portfolio companies (Baygen\nand Freudenberg, 2000; Gompers et al., 2010), with improved corporate management viewed as\ncrucial to increasing the opportunities for future investments.\nControl perspective\nA control survey of five `dead deals' were randomly selected from three older ECFs, allowing\nsufficient time for performance comparison with funded counterparts. They come from circa\n15% of applicants reaching interview and negotiation stage, with potentially viable\npropositions, which do not convert into fund investments (BIS, 2010). Fall-out\nexplanations varied: two withdrew, perceiving themselves too early stage; one preferred an\nalternative deal; two were rejected based on proposition and due diligence evidence.\nWhilst the small control sample is not representative of unassisted potentially viable\napplicants, it provides a suitably comparable range of sectors (three IT/telecoms, 1\nbio-science, 1 recycling) spanning shorter and longer horizon investments, and regions\n(two Northern regions and three Southern regions). It therefore offers useful policy-off\ninsights when triangulated with other survey evidence. First, four out of five found\nalternative private equity funding, suggesting that potential duplication was avoided.\nSecond, the dead deal firms generally under-performed those assisted, suggesting that the\nfunds' selection process was working efficiently. One out of five failed, compared with one\nout of 10 for assisted ECFs, and another reported that delay in finding alternative funding\nresulted in 30% slower development than anticipated. This latter finding is indicative of the\nearlier assessment of surveyed-assisted businesses that the timing of ECF funding for viable\nbusiness applicants is crucial to their growth. Overall, the four surviving ECF dead deals\nachieved aggregate 43% sales turnover and 22% employment increases since their\napplications, compared to 177% sales turnover and 69% employment increases amongst\nsurviving surveyed older ECF portfolio companies.\nTriangulating with recipient survey findings, ECFs appear to have selected more viable\ncases, or offered more timely smarter finance, rather than duplicated any private investor\nactivity.\nForecast performance\nBusiness performance forecasts are subjective. Focusing on probably more accurate near-\nterm one year forecasts substantial aggregate job (\u00fe41%) and sales turnover (\u00fe55%) growth\nis anticipated. This is higher amongst newer ECF recipients, suggesting that some will\nconsiderably step up early commercialisation activities, with nine businesses predicting\nannual sales turnover increases between \u00a31 m and \u00a38 m, coming from the information\ntechnology, manufacturing and financial services sectors, with two-thirds located in the\nLondon-Oxbridge triangle.\nThe three-year sales turnover forecast indicates the potential value of recipient businesses\ncloser to exit. At this stage, they predict annual average sales turnover of \u00a311.6 m (median\n\u00a38.6 m). This contrasts to the time of initial ECF funding, when many were pre-trading\nExit strategies\nUltimately, ECFs' success depends upon exit market conditions, which were reportedly very\ntough in the UK during the post GFC period (Baldock, 2015). The UK AIM, providing\nsmaller cap business progression into public equity, has shown signs of revival with the\nnotable \u00a3120m IPO in Spring 2014 of the Cambridge-based life science company Horizon.\nLikewise, stellar trade sales, within the recently depressed UK market rather than to US or\nother international corporate buyers, will increase confidence and establish a more buoyant\nUK exit market. However, concerns persist that too many UK GVCFs sell their prized\nportfolio assets under value, because they cannot afford to follow-on fund and retain\nbusinesses until they achieve optimum exit size, market traction and sustainability\nSurveyed ECF fund managers put much greater emphasis on planning their investment\nexit from the point of initial investment than previously pre GFC, supporting a similar trend\nfound amongst business angels (North et al., 2013). They broadly accept that ``. . .it is no\nlonger sufficient to invest in a good business in the expectation that it will sell itself.'' ECF fund\nmanagers, alongside portfolio businesses, now invest more time contacting and networking\nwith potential trade buyers and VC investors, with seed VCs particularly keen to work with\npotential follow-on investors at the full `series A' stage, a point at which they may no longer\nwish to be lead investor.\nThere have been 13 ECF exits (8%). Three recent exits were reported in our survey,18 all\nbeing trade sales at multiples between 2\u00ad5\u00c2. Three-fifths of future exits are expected to be\nvia trade sales, almost one-fifth to private equity takeovers, and under one in 10 by IPO,\nsuggesting continuing perceptions of weakness in the AIM which attracted closer to 20% of\nVC exits in boom times (BIS, 2013). Importantly for the UK economy, just over half of the\nmanagers seeking trade sales expect the business to remain wholly in the UK and a further\nthird expect core R&D to remain. Furthermore, amongst portfolio managers seeking trade\nsales, most will seek managerial roles in existing (50%) or new (36%) UK companies and\nthose that reinvest (43%) will do so in UK businesses. Overall, this suggests that future\nfunding and IP spin-out development from ECF exit companies will take place in the UK,\nsuggesting considerable benefits from Lerner's (2010) global free market GVCF thesis.\nFailures\nECFs exhibit proportionally low write-down investment failures (10%), raising concerns\nthat fund managers are inefficient in culling poorer performing portfolio businesses and\nfocusing on their star performers. One quarter of older ECF recipients exhibited negative\nor zero sales turnover change over a median funding period of five years. This can result in\nsub-optimal fund performance (Markowitz, 1952) diverting fund manager time and\ninvestments into ``zombie'' unsustainable companies. Contrastingly, the emerging ECF\nseed VC accelerator model appears more ruthlessly efficient, adhering to Lerner's (2010)\nprivate sector-led GVCF vision.\nImportantly, the five investment failure case studies demonstrated investment spillover\nimpacts, including managers finding senior industry roles, the retention and redeployment of\nIP and patent activity, and in some cases the seeds of new business opportunities.\nDiscussion\nWhilst general consensus existed amongst demand and supply side informants that ECFs\nare addressing the sub-\u00a32 m UK equity gap for young potential high-growth SMEs, with\nlittle sign of duplication or displacement, considerable debate remains as to whether they\nhave the scale, profile and reach to make significant and lasting impacts on the wider UK\nseed and early stage VC ecosystem to deliver their sustainable and private sector led VC\naim.\nSupply-side informants (particularly industry trade associations and experts) supported\nholistic VC ecosystem perspectives (Hughes, 2009; Hwang and Horowitt, 2012), suggesting\nthe scheme can make a difference if it forms part of a cohesive government policy addressing\nboth the support mechanisms developing a pipeline of viable young high-growth potential\nbusinesses through investment readiness programmes, accelerators and mentors (Mason and\nBrown, 2013) delivered through the UK government's Business Growth Service (BBB & BIS,\n2015) and a suitable finance escalator supply of appropriate financing instruments. The latter\npoint suggests an important role for the British Business Bank (Mazzucato and Penna, 2014;\nVan der Schans, 2015) in monitoring and developing more effective design and operation of\nthe ECFs. A key requirement is raising ECFs' profile (highlighted by fund managers); they\nare less known than VCTs, particularly amongst financial intermediaries outside of specialist\nVC networks, underlining Lerner's (2010) requirement to develop support services\n(accountants, lawyers, fundraisers). All supply-side informants agreed that it is crucial to\ndevelop a suitable exit market, including a functioning IPO public feeder market (Baldock,\n2015), because high profile successful exits (lacking during the GFC period) will do most to\nencourage increasing earlier stage private VC investment.\nFund managers and stakeholder trade associations noted that ECF design has seen\nincreased fund size with greater attention now given to planning follow-on funding and\nexits. However, they also widely agreed that scheme funds remain too small and require\nscale would enable the number and range of investments to meet Markowitz's (1952)\noptimum of 30 investments, creating a realistic chance of ``backing their most successful\nportfolio businesses through to large 100 employee plus high profile \u00a3100 m plus trade sales\nor IPOs.'' ECF fund managers particularly noted that improved ability to develop scheme\nsecond funds would also assist the VC fund development cycle, enabling sizeable follow-on\nfunding, addressing a perceived emerging ``series A funding crisis'' and supporting\nCumming's (2011) view of successful VC transition to balanced portfolios across stages,\npotentially offering greater attraction to large institutional (e.g. pension fund) investors\nthat have avoided earlier stage investment post Dotcom (Pierrakis, 2010).\nECFs are designed as feeder demonstrators, to attract high-quality, innovative emerging\nfund managers with seed and early stage investment track records, enabling fund scaling-up\nand ultimately to spin-out and attraction of more private VC fund managers into the\nmarket, in line with Lerner's (2010) prescribed approach. Thus far, ECFs have supported\nearly stage VC activity, contributing to the increasing public sector presence in the early\nstage UK VC market (Mason and Pierrakis, 2013), but as one private VC mentioned, ``there\nis very limited evidence of it spurning independent private VC activity,'' due largely to the\ndepressed nature of the post GFC UK market. However, signs of change were emerging,\nnotably in the London market where Passion Capital's ECF model has encouraged angel\ncapital group and private seed VC activity, assisted by the catalysing effect of increasing seed\nstage syndication (Hopp, 2010), allied to the attraction of Enterprise Investment Scheme\n(EIS) and Seed EIS investor tax breaks (HMRC, 2014). Here, it was commented by a trade\nassociation that ECFs are ``offering a smart money lead in a rapidly developing market.''\nFinally, the future development of the enhanced \u00a3400 m ECF scheme was widely\nsupported, provided this harnesses the enlarged EU state aid limits. As one private VC\nnoted, ``new Super ECFs could attract substantially more private and institutional\ninvestment,'' better addressing follow-on funding and sustainability issues, also potentially\noffering the scale of funding to address the Rowlands gap (2009) in longer horizon intensive\nR&D investment which currently extends upwards of \u00a35 m. This was not addressed by other\nUK funds as UKIIF was fully invested and the Business Growth Fund was for more\nestablished businesses with annual sales turnover of at least \u00a35 m.\nConclusions\nDespite continuing suggestions that GVCFs perform more poorly than their private sector\ncounterparts, this paper finds that ECFs have evolved and adapted to meet the challenges of\nchanging UK early stage entrepreneurial financing requirements post GFC. Focusing on\nassessing scheme impact demonstrates that they are effectively meeting the needs of viable\nUK seed and early stage equity gap SMEs. First, they have encouraged and stretch funded\nexperienced national and international private-led VCs into UK seed and early stage\ninvestment, with little sign of duplication or displacement in addressing the sub-\u00a32 m\nfunding gap. Second, they have increased in size and scale, adopting innovative strategies\nof inter-regional and international investing, increasing syndication and investor\nnetworking, increasing portfolios, spreading risk, and improving planning for follow-on\nfunding and exits. Third, they have generated economic impact; levering investment,\nattributable to direct and indirect job generation, increased sales turnover and innovation,\nand improved business management.\nHowever, the ECFs are still a long way from meeting their objective of achieving a\nlegacy of a sustainable private sector-led early stage UK VC market. The combination of\nfurther increased size `Super ECFs' and second fund developments enabling follow-on\nfunding and optimal portfolio exits should enhance their profile, notably through\nsuccessful exits, and encourage increased earlier stage investment from institutional,\ncorporate and private VCs, including ECF fund manager spin-outs. The British Business\nBank will have a crucial role in overseeing this process and developing a more cohesive\nentrepreneurial financing ecosystem.\nOur study has single scheme, cross-sectional limitations, undertaken during scheme mid-\nterm at a time when the GFC had severely disrupted fund performance. A clearer view will\nemerge over the next three years as early pathfinder ECFs complete their maximum 12-year\ncycle. However, this paper establishes a robust framework for future scaled-up and\nlongitudinal research, including the potential for international GVCF comparator studies.\n"
