Silbergeld, PhD; Eliseo Guallar, MD, DrPH\nBackground--Blood lead levels above 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL) in adults have been associated with increased risk of\ncardiovascular, cancer, and all-cause mortality. The objective of the present study was to determine the association\nbetween blood lead levels below 0.48 mol/L and mortality in the general US population.\nMethods and Results--Blood lead levels were measured in a nationally representative sample of 13 946 adult participants\nof the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey recruited in 1988 to 1994 and followed up for up to 12\nyears for all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The geometric mean blood lead level in study participants was 0.12\nmol/L (2.58 g/dL). After multivariate adjustment, the hazard ratios (95% CI) for comparisons of participants in the\nacross\ntertiles0.003) for cardiovascular mortality. Blood lead level was significantly associated with both myocardial\ninfarction and stroke mortality, and the association was evident at levels 0.10 mol/L (2 g/dL). There was no\nassociation between blood lead and cancer mortality in this range of exposure.\nConclusions--The association between blood lead levels and increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was\nobserved at substantially lower blood lead levels than previously reported. Despite the marked decrease in blood lead\nlevels over the past 3 decades, environmental lead exposures remain a significant determinant of cardiovascular\nKey Words: risk factors  mortality  cardiovascular diseases  myocardial infarction  stroke\nbeen associated with increased risks of cardiovascular,\ncancer, and all-cause mortality in several occupational co-\nhorts. In the general population, Lustberg and Silbergeld1 also\nreported significant relationships between blood lead levels\nabove 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL) and cardiovascular, cancer,\nand all-cause mortality.\nEnvironmental lead exposures in the United States have\ngenerally declined since the mid-1970s, largely because of\nthe phase-out of lead in gasoline, which was finalized in\n1996. In addition, lead-based paints were restricted in use,\nand a voluntary program removed lead solder from food\ncans.2,3 Among US adults, the geometric mean blood lead\n99% of US adults have blood lead levels below 0.48 mol/L\n(10 g/dL).2 To the best of our knowledge, the association of\nmortality end points has never been investigated.\nThe purpose of the present analysis was to evaluate the\nassociation of blood lead levels below 0.48 mol/L (10\ng/dL) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the\ngeneral US population. To do so, we analyzed data from the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) Mortality Study, a cohort study based on a\nnationally representative sample of US adults in which blood\nlowed up for up to 12 years.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nNHANES III was a stratified, multistage probability survey designed\nto select a representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized\ncompleted the NHANES III interview and examination between\nmissing data for blood lead, 707 participants with blood lead 0.48\nmol/L (10 g/dL), and 1494 participants who were missing other\nFrom the Department of Epidemiology (A.M., P.M.), Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine and Department of Medicine\n(P.M., V.B.), Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, La; Department of Environmental Health Sciences (E.K.S.) and Department of\nEpidemiology (E.G.), Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Md.\nReprint requests to Paul Muntner, Department of Epidemiology, Tulane University SPHTM, 1430 Tulane Ave, SL-18, New Orleans, LA 70112.

The present study used a cohort design to\nevaluate the association between blood lead levels in adult NHANES\nIII participants with their mortality through December 31, 2000.\nThe protocol for NHANES III was approved by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention Institutional Review Board. All participants gave in-\nformed consent.\nBaseline Data Collection\nNHANES III baseline data were collected during an in-home\ninterview and a subsequent visit to a mobile examination center.\nDuring the in-home interview, demographic information, including\nage, race-ethnicity, and sex, was collected with a standardized\nquestionnaire. Additional data collected during the in-home inter-\nview included urban residence, education, household income, phys-\nical activity, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, current med-\nication use, menopausal status for women, and history of diabetes\nmellitus, myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or cancer.\nBlood pressure was measured 3 times during the in-home inter-\nview and 3 additional times during the visit to the mobile examina-\ntion center. All blood pressure measurements for each participant\nwere averaged, and hypertension was defined as systolic blood\npressure 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg\nand/or current use of blood pressure\u00adlowering medication. Height\nand weight were measured, and body mass index was calculated as\nweight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.\nParticipants had a blood specimen drawn from their antecubital\nvein by a trained phlebotomist according to a standardized protocol.\nSerum C-reactive protein (CRP) was quantified by latex-enhanced\nnephelometry. Participants were classified as having CRP 3.0\nwas measured by an enzymatic reaction. Diabetes mellitus was\ndefined as a fasting plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), a\nself-reported history of diabetes mellitus with concurrent use of\nantidiabetic medication. Total serum cholesterol was measured\nenzymatically. Serum creatinine was measured by the Jaffe modified\nkinetic method. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated with\nthe Modification of Diet and Renal Disease equation after we aligned\nthe serum creatinine concentrations with the assay used in the\ndevelopment of the equation.5,6 Individuals were classified as having\nA detailed description of the methods used in the measurement of\nblood lead levels is available elsewhere.7 All materials used for\ncollecting and processing blood lead specimens were screened for\npossible lead contamination. Blood specimens for lead measurement\nwere shipped on dry ice to the NHANES laboratory at the National\nCenters for Environmental Health at the Centers for Diseases Control\nand Prevention in Atlanta, Ga. Blood lead was measured by graphite\nfurnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry as described by Sassa\nand colleagues.8 The detection limit was 0.05 mol/L (1.0 g/dL).\nFor 8.1% of study participants with lead levels below the detection\nlimit, we imputed a level of 0.03 mol/L (0.7 g/dL). The analytical\nlaboratory followed extensive quality control procedures.7 To ensure\naccurate measurements of blood lead, blinded quality control pools\nwere incorporated with NHANES III participants' samples. This\nprogram was incorporated for the entirety of NHANES III (ie, from\ndrift in blood lead occurred because of measurement error.\nMortality Follow-Up\nNHANES III participants aged 17 years at baseline were followed\nprobabilistic matching was used to link NHANES III participants\nwith the National Death Index to ascertain vital status and cause of\ndeath. Matching was based on 12 identifiers for each participant (eg,\nSocial Security number, sex, and date of birth). Identical matching\nmethodology applied to the NHANES I Epidemiological Follow-up\nStudy for validation purposes found that 96.1% of deceased partic-\nipants and 99.4% of living participants were classified correctly.\nCause of death was determined by the underlying cause listed on\ndeath certificates. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)\nrevision 9 (ICD-9) was used for deaths that occurred between 1988\nStatistical Methods\nParticipants were categorized into blood lead tertiles based on the\nweighted population distribution. Baseline covariate levels were\ncalculated by tertile of blood lead level after standardization to the\nage, race-ethnicity, and sex distribution of the US population. Age-,\nrace-ethnicity\u00ad, and sex-standardized differences in baseline covari-\nates across tertiles of lead were evaluated by linear regression for\ncontinuous variables and logistic regression for dichotomous\nvariables.\nFor cohort analysis of the association between blood lead and\nmortality, follow-up for each study participant was calculated as the\ntime between their NHANES III examination and the date of death,\nwhichever occurred first. The hazard ratios and 95% CIs of all-cause,\ncardiovascular, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer mortality\nassociated with each tertile of lead level compared with the first\ntertile were calculated by Cox regression. Initial models were\nadjusted for age, race-ethnicity, and sex. Subsequent models were\nfurther adjusted for urban residence, cigarette smoking, alcohol\nconsumption, education, physical activity, household income, meno-\npausal status for women, body mass index, CRP, total cholesterol,\nand diabetes mellitus. Additional models were further adjusted for\nhypertension and GFR category, which are potential intermediate\nfactors in the causal pathway between lead exposure and mortality.\nTests for linear trend across tertiles of blood lead were computed by\nincluding tertile of lead as a continuous variable in the Cox\nregression models. Sensitivity analyses were conducted after exclu-\nsion of participants with a history of cardiovascular disease or\ncancer.\nTo further explore the dose\u00adresponse relationship of blood lead\nlevel with mortality, we used restricted quadratic splines with knots\nat the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the blood lead distribution\nmol/L [5.98 g/dL], respectively). Finally, the association between\nblood lead as a continuous variable and mortality was determined\noverall and for subgroups defined by age, race-ethnicity, sex,\nmenopausal status, urban and rural residence, cigarette smoking,\noverweight, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and level of estimated\nGFR. For analyses that included blood lead level as a continuous\nvariable, lead was log-transformed owing to its skewness, and the\nhazard ratios of mortality end points are presented for a 3.4-fold\nincrease in blood lead. This increase corresponds to the difference\nbetween the 80th and 20th percentiles of the blood lead distribution\nrespectively). The proportionality assumptions of the Cox models\nwere evaluated with Schoenfeld residuals. Data were analyzed with\nSUDAAN (version 9.0; Research Triangle Institute, Research Tri-\nangle Park, NC) to account for the complex NHANES sampling\ndesign, which included unequal probabilities of selection, oversam-\npling, and nonresponse.\nThe authors had full access to and take full responsibility for the\nintegrity of the data.

Among women,\nthose who were postmenopausal were more likely to have\nhigher lead levels. Also, those with higher lead levels were\nmore likely to have a household income $20 000, to be a\ncurrent smoker, and to consume alcohol and were less likely\nto have a high school education and to exercise 3 or more\ntimes per week. Mean total cholesterol, the prevalence of\nhypertension, the prevalence of reduced GFR, and the prev-\nalence of a history of cardiovascular disease were higher at\nhigher lead levels.

Indeed, an increased risk of cardio-\nvascular, myocardial infarction, and stroke mortality was\nevident at blood lead levels 0.10 mol/L (2.0 g/dL). This\nincreased mortality affected non-Hispanic whites, non-\nHispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans and both males and\nfemales. In contrast, there was no increased cancer mortality\nrisk at these ranges of exposure. The finding of no increased\ncancer mortality risk in the present study is consistent with\nexperimental evidence in which increased numbers of tumors\nare induced in rodents only after relatively high doses.\nIn the occupational setting, blood lead levels above 1.93\nmol/L (40 g/dL) have been repeatedly demonstrated to be\nassociated with increased risk of elevated blood pressure,\nimpaired renal function, and cancer. Using data from the\nNHANES II Mortality Follow-Up Study, including follow-up\nidentified a significant association between blood lead levels\nTABLE 1.

Accumu-\nlating evidence indicates that blood lead levels 0.48 mol/L\n(10 g/dL) are associated with several health outcomes,\nincluding peripheral arterial disease, impaired renal function,\nand elevated blood pressure.10\u00ad14 The present study adds\nimportant data on total and cardiovascular mortality, end\npoints of unquestionable public health relevance, to the list of\nhealth outcomes that are associated with blood lead levels\nThe association between lead and cardiovascular disease is\nbiologically plausible. Increases in blood pressure and renal\ndamage have been observed after induction of lead exposure\nin rodent models.15,16 However, because these experimental\nstudies have been conducted at doses that produce blood lead\nlevels in rodents 10 times the median reported in NHANES\nIII, the relevance of these studies to the range of blood lead\nlevels reported in the present study is uncertain. In other\nepidemiological studies, associations between blood lead\nwith increased blood pressure and decreased GFR have been\nHowever, the extent to which blood pressure and renal\nimpairment mediated the effect of lead in the present study is\nunclear. Although the association between blood lead and\ncardiovascular disease outcomes persisted after adjustment\nfor estimated GFR, estimated GFR is considered a crude\nmeasure of renal function. Studies using more sensitive\nbiomarkers of early kidney damage and renal tubular dys-\nfunction, such as cystatin C, retinal binding protein, and other\nlow-molecular-weight proteins, may be informative in under-\nstanding the mechanism underlying lead-associated cardio-\nvascular disease.15 Weaver and colleagues19 have reported\nthat hyperfiltration can be measured in workers exposed to\nlead at substantially lower levels than those associated with\ndecrements in estimated GFR. Alterations in signal transduc-\ntion that involve renal pathways (eg, angiotensin and vaso-\npressin) have been reported in animal models and also need to\nbe investigated. Additionally, lead may increase cardiovas-\ncular risk via inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase,\nalthough the evidence for this mechanism in humans is\nmixed.20\u00ad22 Other biologically plausible mechanisms by\nwhich lead may increase cardiovascular risk include effects\non neuromuscular control of vascular tone and/or central\nnervous system neurohumoral regulation of vascular func-\ntion, sodium transport abnormalities, and alterations in cyto-\nsolic calcium regulation.23\u00ad26 Additional research is needed to\nestablish the mechanism responsible for lead-related mortal-\nThe findings from the present study need to be considered\nwithin the context of its limitations. Perhaps the most impor-\ntant limitation was the reliance on a single blood lead\nmeasurement to assess exposure. Blood lead, with a half-life\nof 30 days, reflects primarily recent external exposures,\nalthough it is also influenced by long-term exposures through\nefflux of lead from bone stores. Both blood lead, which\nreflects recent exposure, and bone lead, which reflects cumu-\nlative exposure, have been associated with blood pressure\nincreases.27\u00ad29 Thus, it is unclear whether the adverse health\neffects of lead observed here were associated with current or\ncumulative exposures. In addition, because of declining lead\nlevels in the decades before lead ascertainment in the present\nanalysis, it is unclear whether the observed increased risk in\nmortality was due to lead exposure at baseline or lead\nmobilization from the skeleton. In the latter scenario, blood\nresults of the present study emphasize the need for cumula-\ntive lead measurements, such as bone lead, which would\nprovide a more accurate characterization of the relationship\nbetween long-term lead exposure and mortality. Furthermore,\nblood lead levels decreased in the US population during the\nfollow-up period, from a geometric mean of 0.13 mol/L\nFigure 2. Multivariate adjusted relative\nhazards of all-cause and cardiovascular\nmortality. Hazard ratios were calculated\nfor a 3.4-fold increase in blood lead with\nlog\u00adblood lead as a continuous variable.\nThis increase corresponds to the differ-\ntiles of the blood lead distribution (0.24\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\ndecrease in blood lead observed at the population level\nimplies that the results of the present study are conservative\nand that the lead\u00admortality relationship may be stronger than\nreported. An additional limitation was the lack of active\nfollow-up of NHANES III study participants. Therefore,\nincident nonfatal events were not obtained. As a conse-\nquence, the present findings cannot be generalized to nonfatal\nevents. Although the reliability of mortality follow-up\nthrough the National Death Index is very high (98.5%), this\nmethod is based on death certificates, which may contain\ninaccurate information on causes of death. Follow-up was\ncensored at age 90 years because mortality was very high\nafter this age, and few participants contributed person-time\nexperience in this age category. However, all analyses were\nrepeated without censoring of participants aged 90 years,\nand the results were remarkably similar. Finally, we cannot\nrule out residual confounding by sociodemographic determi-\nnants of lead exposure. We note, however, that the associa-\ntion of lead with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality\npersisted after adjustment for race-ethnicity, household in-\ncome, education, and urban residence. In addition, the lead\u00ad\nmortality association was observed for cardiovascular dis-\neases but not for cancer, which makes it less likely that\nresidual confounding by sociodemographic factors could\nexplain our findings.\nDespite these limitations, the present study maintains\nseveral strengths. NHANES III data were collected by a\nrigorous study protocol with extensive quality control proce-\ndures and with technicians trained and certified in all data\ncollection procedures. The results are representative of the\nUS noninstitutionalized civilian population. To the best of our\nknowledge, the sample size of the NHANES III Mortality\nStudy makes it the largest prospective cohort study of lead\nexposure and mortality conducted to date. The large sample\nsize permitted the investigation of the effect of blood lead in\nimportant subgroups, after adjustment for important con-\nfounders and potential intermediates, and after exclusion of\npatients with a history of cardiovascular disease and cancer at\nbaseline.\nMost importantly, the present study for the first time\npermitted the investigation of the association between blood\nlead levels below 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL) and mortality end\npoints. The association detected provides new evidence of the\nadverse impact of lead at levels that are still considered by\nmany to be acceptable, particularly for adult exposures.30\nThis association may be surprising to some, but it is important\nto place it in an historical context. Current population blood\nlead levels are estimated to be substantially higher than blood\nlead levels in preindustrialized human societies.31 Although a\n10-fold decline in blood lead levels has occurred in the\nUnited States in recent decades, current levels remain orders\nof magnitude higher than in preindustrialized times. In the\npresent study data, the association of blood lead with cardio-\nvascular mortality was evident at levels as low as 0.10\nmol/L (2 g/dL). Because 38% of US adults had lead levels\npublic health implications of these findings are substantial.\nThe health effects of current lead levels on adult populations,\nhowever, are not viewed as a pressing public health concern.\nThe present study, in conjunction with previous data, indi-\ncates that this perception may be erroneous and that accept-\nable blood lead levels in adults need further investigation.\nThe results of the present study call for the inclusion of lead\nexposure at levels 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL) among adult-\nrelated cardiovascular risk factors.\nSources of Funding\nThis study was conducted through funding from National Institutes\nthe National Center for Research Resources.\nDisclosures\nNone.\nReferences\n1.

Lead levels in preindustrial humans. N Engl J Med.\nWe studied the association between blood lead levels and mortality over 12 years of follow-up in a representative sample\nof the US population. We found that blood lead levels as low as 0.10 mol/L (2 g/dL), currently considered safe, were\nassociated with an increased risk of overall mortality and an increased risk of mortality due to coronary heart disease and\nstroke. Blood lead levels were not associated with cancer mortality. Because 38% of US adults had lead levels 0.10\nmol/L (2 g/dL) in 1999 to 2002, the public health implications of these findings are substantial. The health effects of\ncurrent lead levels on adult populations, however, are not viewed as a pressing public health concern. The present study,\nin conjunction with previous data, indicates that this perception may not be justified and that the current regulations for\nacceptable blood lead levels in adults are now outdated and may need to be revised. Because of the limited ability the\npresent study had to evaluate the risks of lead exposure associated with blood lead levels below 0.10 mol/L (2 g/dL),\nthere is a need for future research to identify the level of lead exposure that is no longer associated with adverse health\noutcomes. Although markedly reduced, current blood lead levels may not be low enough; practicable and cost-effective\nmethods for reducing lead exposure in the general US population are needed. ?? ?? ?? ??\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\n"
