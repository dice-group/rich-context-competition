We are also thankful to our language and copy editor John Goodall. The views expressed in the paper are solely\nthose of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the Bundesbank, nor the Eurosystem.\nSince the mid-1990s, banking regulators globally have allowed banks the discretion to use\ntheir own models to assess risk and thus calculate capital needs. The financial crisis, however,\nhas triggered a fundamental debate among scholars and regulators about this flexibility given\nto banks to scale their regulatory capital (e.g., Haldane, 2013). Many observers distrust the\ncomplicated models that banks use, which they say tend to make assets look safer than they\nreally are. Therefore, recent initiatives by regulatory bodies are aiming for simpler rules\nwhich are harder to manipulate (BCBS, 2016; Coen, 2016) and closer to what is deemed op-\ntimal from a benevolent regulator's perspective (Glaeser and Shleifer, 2001). An important\nargument against new measures, though, is that simpler rules are less efficient with respect to\ncapital allocation and thus more stringent. As a result, banks would have to increase their cap-\nital or reduce lending with potential real effects on the economy (Dombrovskis, 2016).1\nTo\naddress malfunctions in an efficient manner but prevent over-regulation, it is crucial to under-\nstand how and why banks potentially use the discretion inherent in their models.\nRecent studies show that banks using the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach econo-\nmize on capital by systemically reporting lower risk within a specific asset category, e.g.,\ncredit risk in the banking book (Mariathasan and Merrouche, 2014; Plosser and Santos, 2014,\nrisk in the trading book (Begley, Purnanandam, and Zheng, 2016). We complement this litera-\nture by assessing different bank risk dimensions comprehensively and ask whether banks re-\nport lower risks in one asset category to cross-subsidize risks (and losses) in another asset cat-\negory. The idea being that, if banks can economize on capital by strategic risk-reporting in the\nbanking book, they could use the `freed capital' to cross-subsidize risk associated with assets\nin the trading book and thereby insulate their official capital adequacy ratio. In essence, banks\n1 Behn, Haselmann, and Wachtel (2016) and Jim\u00e9nez, Ongena, Peydr\u00f3, and Saurina (2017) (among many others) document\nhow capital regulation affects lending.\nwould be less capitalized than what official capital ratios suggest and thus create a more frag-\nile banking system. The implications of such a comprehensive risk management would be\nthreefold: first, banks would use the regulatory discretion to manage short-term adverse mar-\nket risk fluctuations. Second, banks would optimize risk and thus regulatory risk weights at an\naggregate overall risk level as opposed to an asset-specific risk level. Third, supervisors\nshould include a comprehensive view of the different bank risk dimensions. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study that examines the cross-subsidy incentivized risk reporting\nacross regulatory asset charges.\nTo examine this question, we use a unique, proprietary dataset from the Deutsche Bun-\ndesbank (the German central bank), which collects supervisory information on internal credit\nrisk ratings for the loan portfolio of all banks in Germany using the IRB approach (hereafter:\nIRB banks). In particular, the data comprises IRB banks' estimates of creditors' one-year\nprobability of default (PD) and the creditor-specific risk-weighted asset at the borrower-bank-\nrisk ratings for the loan portfolio of each IRB bank allows us to examine the differential PD\nreporting by banks and across borrowers. Notably, we also have access to quarterly superviso-\nry data on market risk-weighted assets for trading book assets (hereafter: mRWA or market\nRWA) for each IRB bank during each quarter (BCBS, 2013). This allows us to examine\nwhether IRB banks report credit risk ratings depending on their market risk exposure. Our ex-\nhaustive dataset is matched with comprehensive balance sheet information.\nThe testable hypothesis, which we study in this paper, is that IRB banks report lower cred-\nit risk for their loan portfolio when they have higher market risk exposure (as compared to\nbanks with lower market risk exposure). Our results suggest the existence of incentive spillo-\nvers across these two risk categories. On average, an IRB bank with a one-standard deviation\nhigher market RWA reports lower PDs by 0.03 percentage points, which is equivalent to a re-\nduction of risk weights by about 3.57 percentage points and thus economically significant.\nConditioning on the level of the regulatory Tier 1 capital ratio, we find that this effect is more\npronounced for banks with more binding capital constraints (lowest 25th percentile of Tier 1\nratio). These results are robust to an exhaustive set of various fixed effects and bank-level\ncontrols.\nTo tease out the potential channels behind this finding, we examine and discuss three mu-\ntually non-exclusive possibilities, all of which relate to the level of discretion inherent in the\nmodels used under the IRB approach. First, we find that our result only holds for banks using\nthe Advanced-IRB approach but not for banks that employ the Foundation-IRB approach.\nThese findings suggest that there is self-selection when banks decide which approach (A-IRB\nvs. F-IRB) they should choose. That is, especially those banks that tend to exploit the greater\ndegree of discretion may choose the A-IRB approach over F-IRB.\nSecond, we find that incentive spillovers across these different risk categories are weaker\nwhen market discipline is higher and stronger for less transparent borrowers with respect to\nfundamental information. Third, we find that more stringent regulatory supervision hampers\nthe use of IRB model discretion for some banks, but not for institutions with stricter capital\nconstraints. However, the latter finding might also be a result of the fading effect of the finan-\ncial crisis. Both interpretations nevertheless suggest a more comprehensive view of risk re-\nporting is required in future supervisory practice.\nWhile our results suggest the existence of incentive spillovers across different risk catego-\nries, they do not imply an abusive application of banks' own models to assess risk. Neither do\nthey indicate that banks manipulate their models after approval has been granted by the na-\ntional regulator. Rather, we view our findings to be within the scope of the discretion that the\nnational regulatory authorities allow to exist in the IRB model framework. This also includes\nbanks' choice to apply either a point-in-time or a through-the-cycle risk modelling approach.\nThese results contribute to the growing literature in banking that investigates the link be-\ntween risk reporting and bank capital under current internal ratings-based regulation (Mari-\nathasan and Merrouche, 2014; Plosser and Santos, 2014; Begley, Purnanandam, and Zheng,\nRezende, 2016; Berg and Koziol, 2017). While these studies focus solely on how banks report\nrisk in one asset category to economize on regulatory capital, our paper reveals two new di-\nmensions: first, we show that banks use their risk reporting as a device to manage risk across\ndifferent asset categories and, second, that banks optimize risk weights at the risk-\ncomprehensive level rather than at the specific-risk level. In this regard, our paper is also con-\nnected to current debates on banking (capital) regulation (e.g., see Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein,\n2013; Dombrovskis, 2016). Our findings suggest that regulators can curtail the documented\nstrategic risk reporting by taking a comprehensive view on the different bank risk dimension\nin the ongoing supervision.\nOur work also adds to the literature on risk-management practice in banking (e.g., see El-\nlul and Yerramilli, 2013), which examines the role of strong and independent risk manage-\nment for the resilience of banks' exposure to tail risk. Our findings highlight, that strategic\nrisk management can have severe consequences for the existence of an institution from a mi-\ncroprudential perspective. With incentive spillovers across different risk categories, banks re-\nduce or even isolate the otherwise adverse effect on their official capital ratio, making the in-\nstitution more prone to shocks, both with respect to the asset side (higher risk related to as-\nsets) and with respect to the liability side (less capitalized relative to the engaged risk). This is\na form of incentive risk reporting unintended by the regulator. In this respect, our paper also\nrelates to the literature on regulatory arbitrage (e.g., see Huizinga and Laeven 2012; Acharya,\nAt a broader level, our results also relate to the literature that examines the misreporting\nincentives in financial markets (e.g., Piskorski, Seru, and Witkin, 2015; and Griffin and\nMaturana, 2016) and the related role of incentives and information in the estimation of risk\nmeasures (Rajan, Seru, and Vig, 2010, and 2015). Our results highlight the importance of a\nregulatory design that elicits truthful disclosure of risk, which is a prerequisite step to the cur-\nrent discussion on the optimal level of regulatory capital banks need to hold. In this regard,\nour paper also contributes to the literature that examines the reliability and credibility of risk\nweights (e.g., Das and Sy, 2012; Le Lesl\u00e9 and Avramova, 2012, among others). Official capi-\ntal adequacy ratios must reflect the actual truthful risks in order for them to be a proper regu-\nlatory tool for both the microprudential and macroprudential policy.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we will discuss\nthe institutional details of current IRB-regulation. Section III presents our data set. Section IV\nshows our empirical strategy and presents our results. Section V concludes.\nThe current regulatory framework (Basel II and Basel III) relies on the concept of risk-\nsensitivity and links capital charges to the risk associated with the assets held. More precisely,\nminimum capital charges are determined on the basis of core capital as a fraction of the (un-\nweighted) sum of RWA across all sources of risk (total RWAs). On average, around 70% of\nbank's assets are allocated to lending and roughly 20% to securities investments (see Table 2).\nThis means that both, credit risk (i.e., credit RWA) and market risk (i.e., mRWA) account for\nthe largest part of the variation in bank's total RWA.\nThe regulator allows banks to use their own internal ratings-based (IRB) models to calcu-\nlate risk weights (as opposed to standard risk weights, see BCBS, 2006). Under IRB, banks\nassess the risk weights in their credit portfolio such that each individual borrower receives a\nborrower-specific risk weight. The estimation of the borrower-specific risk weight relies on\nthe bank's own borrower-specific estimated probability of default over the subsequent year.\nThat is, reported PDs for a given creditor assess the credit risk over a one-year horizon irre-\nspective of the loan-specific characteristics such as the actual maturity and the loss given de-\nfault. Further, even though internal credit risk models are used on a portfolio basis, borrower-\nspecific PD estimations are invariant to the bank's credit portfolio insofar that the capital re-\nquired for a given loan depends only on the risk of that loan but not on the portfolio it is add-\nThe assessment of risk weights for trading book assets is somewhat different. For internal\nmarket risk weighting, IRB banks use internal Value-at-Risk (VaR) models that are based on\ntheir own assumptions with respect to correlation between all trading assets; that is, in con-\ntrast to credit risk, for market risk the required capital for a given trading asset depends on the\nportfolio it is added to. Also, in calculating value-at-risk, IRB banks typically assume an in-\nstantaneous price shock equivalent to a 10-day movement in prices. But in principle, the ra-\ntionale remains the same insofar that a bank that uses the IRB approach can apply its own\njudgement on (i.e., use models to assess) how risky an investment is and thus on how much\ncapital needs to be held. That is, under the IRB approach banks' capital charges are endoge-\nnous to banks' self-assessment of risk.\nThe regulator understands that this endogeneity provides banks the discretion to scale\ntheir regulatory capital. But at the same time, the supervisor imposes certain rules to ensure\ncompliance with the regulatory framework. First, risk models under IRB have to be evaluated\nand certified by the respective national supervisor prior to its implementation. Before any\nbank is allowed to apply the IRB approach for regulatory purposes, it has to ensure that the\nspecific model has been used for internal risk management purposes for at least three years,\nsee (BCBS 2006). After the approval, banks validate their models on a regular frequency (in\nmost cases annually) and adjust them if their assessment is not consonant with realized and\nmaterialized risk (e.g., realized default rates on loans). Second, the regulator conducts a back-\ntesting approach to evaluate the accuracy of bank's self-assessed risks and imposes a penalty\n(e.g., higher capital requirements) on the institutions if their models prove to be inaccurate\nand imprecise, see Bundesbank (2004).That is, banks have generally the incentives to use and\nhold on to models that have passed the regulator's evaluation and validation check-up.\nIn Germany, IRB banks undertake the regulatory reporting on their credit portfolio as part\nof the quarterly credit register to the Deutsche Bundesbank, which (together with the German\nfederal financial supervisory authority `BaFin') is the micro and macro-prudential supervisor\nof the German banking system. We have access to this supervisory micro data on internal\ncredit risk measures at the borrower level for each IRB bank in Germany on a quarterly fre-\nquency from the beginning of 2008 (which is also the start of the IRB approach to capital reg-\nFor each borrower, the bank reports its estimation on the proba-\nbility of default (PD over the subsequent year). In addition, the bank also provides infor-\nmation on its borrower-specific credit RWA, which is used to compute the required level of\nregulatory capital the bank needs to hold for that specific borrower.3\nNote that the PD-\nreporting is at the borrower level as opposed to at the loan level.\nWe also obtain quarterly supervisory data on each bank's internal market risk weights at\nthe bank-time level. This data captures the market risk-weighted sum of trading book assets\n(mRWA) at the bank level during each quarter. We supplement this database on banks' inter-\nnal credit risk and market risk weights with confidential supervisory balance sheet statistics at\n2 We restrict our baseline regressions to the period of the financial crisis for two main reasons. First, banks' incentives to exploit\nthe discretion inherent to their models along the lines of our hypothesis should be more pronounced during periods of higher\nmarket risk. And second, it allows for complementary analysis vis-\u0155-vis previous studies that we mentioned in our Introduction.\n3 In our data set, there are 41,697 (out of 703,195) cases, where we have information on the borrower-specific PD but not on\nthe borrower-specific credit RWA.\nthe bank level. In particular, we collect quarterly balance sheet items such as bank total assets,\ninterbank borrowings, savings deposits, and total lending (both retail and wholesale) and su-\npervisory data on bank Tier 1 capital ratio, which are maintained by the Bundesbank.\nWe complement this rich dataset further with confidential supervisory data at the bank\nlevel, notably on losses and risks associated with trading activities and securities investments,\nand also the size of the investment portfolio. More precisely, we compute quarterly statistics\non bank's securities holdings as a fraction of total assets from the security register and collect\nconfidential supervisory annual information on total profits and net losses from trading from\nthe profit and loss statements, both of which are maintained by the Deutsche Bundesbank\n(e.g., Amann, Baltzer, and Schrape, 2012).\nOur complete dataset comprises credit ratings on a total of 269 banks, including both IRB\nand non-IRB banks. We prune the data as follows. We first restrict our analysis to IRB banks\nonly. Also, we exclude the top (and bottom) 5% largest (smallest) values of PD entries (i.e.\nPD values larger than 10% and equal to zero, respectively), to ensure that our results are not\ndriven by outliers. Further, we exclude banks that have less than 50 borrowers with at least\ntwo PD reporting values during our complete sample. Note, however, that our results are\ncompletely robust to both of these sample restrictions. For identification, we further restrict\nour sample to those borrowers that have at least two credit relationships with (and thus two\nreported PDs from) different banks at the same time. The resulting data set comprises 17,339\ndistinct borrowers and 38 IRB banks providing more than 45% of credit of the total German\nbanking system. Together, these banks' total assets account for half of total assets of all banks\nIn this section, we first discuss our identification strategy to examine banks' internal credit\nrisk reporting depending on the level of market risk exposure related to trading assets. Sec-\nond, we will present our results and, third, we will elaborate on various channels behind our\nfindings.\nOur testable hypothesis is that IRB banks with higher market risk exposure (as compared\nto banks with lower market risk exposure) will assign lower PDs (and thus also lower risk\nweights) to the same borrowers at the same time in their credit portfolio in order to cross-\nsubsidize the risk (or loss) of trading book assets. We examine this using the following econ-\nometric model4\n:\ni,j,t i,t 1 i,t 1 i,j j,t i,j,t\nPD mRWA 'controls\n \n          (1)\nwhere PD refers to the probability to default over the next year that bank `i' assigns to bor-\nrower 'j' during quarter `t'. `mRWA' measures bank `i's market risk exposure of its trading\nbook assets (BCBS, 2013). For identification, we include borrower*time fixed effects (\nj,t\n )\nto account for time-varying, unobserved borrower fundamentals (e.g., risk and growth oppor-\ntunities). Note that this identification strategy imposes that each borrower has at least two\ncredit relationships with different banks at the same time. This identification is crucial for us\nto examine the differential PD reporting depending on key bank characteristics. We also in-\nclude bank*borrower fixed effects (\ni, j\n ) to control for time-invariant, unobserved bank-\nborrower-specific characteristics such as geographical distance (Degryse and Ongena, 2005),\nrelationship lending (Petersen and Rajan, 1995), and reasons related to the regulatory frame-\nwork (Behn, Haselmann, and Vig, 2016). Note that the inclusion of bank*borrower fixed ef-\nfects at the same time controls for all observed and unobserved time-invariant bank-level het-\nerogeneity. Thus, we can compare the internal credit risk assigned to the same borrower at the\nsame time by different banks depending on their market risk exposure. `controls' is a vector\n4 Our results do not depend on this specification.

The fitted values of this regression, i.e.,\ncredit fitted\ni,j,t i,j,t\n(RWA / Loan ) , then capture the part of the observed credit risk weight that can be ex-\nplained by the reported PD, hence the PD-implied credit risk weight. credit\ni,j,t\nRW(PD) is computed\n5 For instance, we cannot control for the risk-taking behaviour of managers over time across banks; different managers may be\nwilling to take more risk for reasons such as higher risk tolerance or incentive contracts. One may argue that such managers\nmay end up being too aggressive in both trading book and lending book causing higher mRWA and lower PD. We do not con-\nsider this to be an issue in our analysis for the following reasons. First, it is not straightforward why an `aggressive' manager'\nshould primarily manifest in higher market risk exposure but not in higher credit risk exposure. Second, risk-taking in the lend-\ning book should be reflective in higher PDs. But as we will discuss below, the marginal effect of an incremental increase in\nPDs on risk weights are much less pronounced for higher levels of PDs. Third, it is not clear whether managers' risk-taking\nbehaviour is systematically correlated with bank's Tier 1 capital position. In fact, persistent risk-taking on the asset side should\nrather incentivize managers to operate with higher Tier 1 capital buffers to avoid scrutiny by regulators.\n6 We modelled the functional relationship between credit risk weights and PDs in several ways (e.g., using logs, polynomial of n-\nth order). Our results do not depend on the specification choice.\non the basis of the Basel formula (BCBS, 2005 and 2006) using the reported PD (see Appen-\ndix Figure A1). Our coefficient of interest, , in Equation (2) then measures the PD-elasticity\nand allows us to infer the economic magnitude and significance of our results from Equation\n(1). The explanatory variables and our fixed effects strategy are similar in both Equation (2)\nand Equation (1). We estimate our regressions using OLS and cluster standard errors at bank\nand borrower level. Our results are also robust to multi-way clustering of standard errors at\nbank, borrower and time level (not reported).\nWe start by taking a first look at the cross-sectional variation in PDs (around the median\nPD) for the same borrower at the same time during our sample period. In Figure 1, we can see\nthat PDs vary substantially and reach levels ranging from \u00ad 2.5 to +2.5 percentage points\naround the median PD. At the face of it, these numbers may seem small. But, for instance,\nMoody's ratings of one-year PDs are AAA (for PD=0%), AA (PD=0.01%), A (PD=0.02%),\nMoody's Analytics (2007). This suggests that the variation in PDs is economically meaning-\nYet, the interesting question, which will be at the centre of our analysis, is whether banks\nwith specific key characteristics are systematically associated with PDs (for the same borrow-\ner at the same time) at the lower tail of this PD distribution.\nTable 2 presents summary statistics on reported PDs and balance sheet variables of banks\nusing IRB approaches. We can see that the average creditor PD is 0.72%, which is equivalent\nto the Moody's rating bucket `Baa to Ba'. The average credit risk weight for a borrower is\n49% and the share of credit RWA accounts, on average, for 88.63% of total bank RWA. This\nhighlights the role of credit risk for total risk and thus for the level of regulatory capital. The\nshare of mRWA to total RWA amounts on average to 4.62%. The IRB banks' mRWA\n7 Note however that the variation in our PDs cannot be directly translated into changes across rating classes as this categorisa-\ntion is non-linear and would require a geometric mapping.\namounts to 1.81% of total assets, which is equivalent to 8.79% of total securities (i.e.,\n[mRWA/TA]/[Securities/TA], which corresponds to [1.81% ]/[20.57%]). Similar levels are\nreported in BCBS (2013). This highlights the role of credit RWA and mRWA for total RWA,\nand thus for the level of required capital.\nWe use Equation (1) as baseline and modify it based on the hypothesis we are testing. In\ncolumn 1 of Table 3, we start to examine the differential PD reporting for the same borrower\nat the same time at the borrower-bank-quarter level, depending on their level of market RWA\n(mRWA) and Tier 1 capital ratio during the previous quarter. There are two findings. First, a\nbank with a lower Tier 1 capital ratio reports significantly lower PDs for the same borrower at\nthe same time as compared to a bank with a higher Tier 1 capital ratio. In this regard, our find-\ning is in line with previous work (Plosser and Santos, 2014; Behn, Haselmann, and Vig, 2016;\nBerg and Koziol, 2017). And second, we can see that for the same borrower at the same time,\nIRB banks with higher mRWAs report lower PDs as compared to banks with lower mRWAs\nin the previous quarter. The magnitude of the different reporting is substantial. An IRB bank\nwith a one-standard deviation higher market RWA reports lower PDs by 0.03 percentage\npoints. This translates into a reduction of risk weights by about 3.57 percentage points.8\nIn\ncolumn 2, we add bank*borrower fixed effects and find similar coefficients as in column 1.\nNote that in both columns, we include bank*time controls (i.e., bank size, interbank borrow-\ning, deposits, ROE, profits from trading/total income, and overall size of the credit and securi-\nties portfolio), which we absorbed for consolidated representation reasons. In the appendix,\nwe further show that our main finding on incentive spillover is not a mere result of banks re-\nporting higher PDs in response to lower mRWAs, see Table A1. Also, the fact that we do not\nfind a significant (neither statistically nor economically) effect for periods of decreasing mar-\n8 In order to calculate the marginal effect of an increase in PDs we use the Basel formula as stated in BCBS (2006) and assume\nan LGD of 45% and a maturity of 2.5 years. The resulting average marginal effect across all borrowers is 127.254. We multi-\npercentage points. These assumptions are rather conservative as they rely on Basel (2006) parameters for senior corporate\ndebt such that our economic results represent a lower bound.\nket risk exposure suggests that our main finding is not a mechanical effect caused by the\nchoice of the bank's IRB model (i.e., point-in-time vs. through-the-cycle). Moreover, Table\nA2 shows that this behaviour is more pronounced during times of higher market risk (i.e.,\nwhen the VIX is particularly high).\nGiven these two independent set of results, one might be concerned with the question of\nhow much of these effects are essentially coming from the same channel and how much are\nactually independent effects. For example, economically it might be argued that banks which\nexperience a decline in Tier 1 capital due to losses in their trading book are more likely to re-\nport lower PDs for the same borrower at the same time. We examine this by using trading\nlosses as an instrument for Tier 1 capital in a first-stage regression, and then use the predicted\nvalue of Tier 1 capital from this regression in the second stage with PD as the dependent vari-\nable. The results of the second stage regression are presented in column 3. While the predicted\nTier 1 is not significant, neither statistically and nor economically, the coefficient of mRWA\nremains both quantitatively and qualitatively unchanged. This suggests that our results pre-\nsented in columns 1 and 2 rather point to two independent effects.\nIn addition to these individual effects, the relationship between the PD reporting and the\nmarket risk of the bank inherent to its trading book assets might depend on the ex-ante level\nof its Tier 1 capital ratio. The idea being that banks, for which the regulatory capital limits are\nmore binding, might report lower PDs in order to cross-subsidize the risk of their trading book\nassets as compared to other banks (i.e., less capital constrained banks). To examine this, in\ncolumns 4 and 5 we replicate our analysis of column 2 but condition on IRB banks with the\nlowest (bottom 25th percentile of Tier 1 capital ratio) and highest (top 25th percentile of Tier 1\ncapital ratio) ex-ante regulatory capital ratio, respectively. From column 4, we can see that\nIRB banks with more binding regulatory capital limits report lower PDs when they have high-\ner ex-ante market risk exposure. Economically, for an IRB bank with a one-standard deviation\nhigher share of mRWA, the bank reports lower PDs to an extent that corresponds to 24.56%\nof the total Tier 1 capital ratio.9\nWe find that the effects are not significant for high-Tier 1-\ncapital IRB banks (top 25th percentile), compare column 5. In fact, note that the estimated co-\nefficient of mRWA in the regressions for low-Tier 1 capital-ratio banks differs by a factor of\nmore than 7 as compared to the regressions for high-Tier 1 capital-ratio banks (compare e.g.,\ncolumn 4 and 5). In Table 4, we replicate the analysis of Table 3 for borrower-specific PD-\nimplied risk weights to examine the importance of our results. The columns 1 to 5 confirm the\ntwo results from Table 3: banks with higher market risk report lower credit risk weights and\nthe result is stronger for lower ex-ante capital banks. Economically, an IRB bank with a one-\nstandard-deviation higher market risk exposure reports lower PD-implied risk weights by 4.91\npercentage points when capital constraints are more binding (bottom 25th percentile Tier 1 ra-\ntio). These results suggest incentive risk reporting across different risk categories.\nOur robust result on incentive spillovers across different asset categories raises one im-\nportant question: what is the economic channel behind it? The answer to this question allows\nus to put our findings into perspective and thus draw the proper conclusions. In this section,\nwe will therefore discuss three different, mutually non-exclusive, possibilities and tease out\ntheir importance.\nUnder IRB, banks can choose between two approaches to determine capital charges, i.e.,\nthe `Foundation IRB' (F-IRB, hereafter) and the `Advanced IRB' (A-IRB, hereafter). Under\nboth approaches, banks use their own PD estimates (BCBS, 2006). But in contrast to F-IRB,\nunder A-IRB, banks provide also own estimates on other parameters such as the loss given\n9 This results from multiplying the standard deviation of mRWA/TA by the coefficient from column 4 of Table 3 times the average\nmarginal effect (assuming standard Basel values for LGD and maturity) as a fraction of the borrower specific credit risk weight.\ndefault (LGD), the exposure at default (EAD), and the effective maturity. Since banks may\nchoose between either one of these approaches, there could be a self-selection involved. That\nis, especially those banks may choose the A-IRB approach over F-IRB, which intend to ex-\nploit the greater discretion.\nWe examine this in Table 5 and replicate our estimation from Table 3 (and 4 for credit\nrisk weights) but restrict ourselves to banks that use the F-IRB and the A-IRB approach, re-\nspectively. In column 1, we can see that for banks that use the F-IRB approach the coefficient\non mRWA is not significant. Moreover, the magnitude of the estimated coefficient is substan-\ntially smaller. For banks using the A-IRB approach, however, the coefficient of mRWA is\nhighly significant, both statistically and economically. In fact, the estimated coefficient is\nconsiderably larger in absolute terms. The estimated coefficient suggests that under the A-IRB\napproach, a bank with a one-standard deviation higher market RWA reports lower PDs by\n0.05 percentage points, which translates into a reduction of risk weights by about 6.84 per-\ncentage points.\nColumns 3 and 4 show similar results for the credit risk weights. This result suggests that\nbanks are not engaging in outright manipulation of PD estimates. That is to say, if bank's ul-\ntimate goal was to manipulate their PD estimations, we should also (or especially) find IRB\nbanks to report lower PDs under F-IRB approach where (i) PDs are the only parameter that\ncan be estimated, and (ii) PDs could be used to over-compensate the rather conservative esti-\nmates of the regulator with respect to the LGD and the maturity. But instead, our results seem\nto highlight the role of the greater discretion inherent to the approved models that banks em-\nploy under the A-IRB approach, which banks seem to systematically exploit for incentive\nspillovers across different risk categories. Our results therefore suggest that there is a self-\nselection in the decision of which approach (A-IRB vs. F-IRB) to choose.\nThe behaviour of incentive risk reporting can also depend on the borrower type. For in-\nstance, one may argue that bank's discretion in assessing the PD is greater for borrowers from\nsectors that are less transparent with respect to fundamental information. The notion being\nthat, PD estimations might be more sensitive to the bank's own assessment when borrower\nfundamentals are less traceable. An alternative view could be that the bank's discretion de-\ncreases when transparency and thus market discipline is high. Large shareholders of listed\nfirms, for instance, might bring more market discipline on the bank as compared to firms that\nare not listed, thus limiting the discretion of a bank vis-\u0155-vis its credit risk assessment for that\nfirm. We elaborate on these two different economic forces in Table 6. In column 1 and 2 of\nTable 6 Panel A, we distinguish between listed and non-listed borrowers. We can see that the\nestimation coefficient in both columns is negative and significant. However, we can reject the\nnull hypothesis of parameter equality suggesting that incentive spillovers are larger for non-\nlisted borrowers (F-test provided in the lower panel of Table 6). In columns 3 and 4, we repli-\ncate the regression from column 2 but condition on borrowers from the MFI sector and from\nthe non-MFI sector, respectively. If opacity is also a driving force behind our results, we\nwould expect IRB banks to report especially lower PDs for borrowers from the non-listed\nnon-MFI sector (i.e., non-banks), which is very probably less transparent with respect to fun-\ndamental information as compared to borrowers from the not-listed MFI sector (i.e., banks).\nWe can see that the coefficient on mRWA is negative and significant for borrowers from both\nthe MFI and non-MFI sector, but statistically (weakly) larger for non-MFI borrowers as com-\npared to MFI creditors (null of parameter equality can be rejected at 10% level of signifi-\ncance). In columns 5 to 8, we examine the heterogeneity within the not-listed, non-MFI sector\nmore narrowly. We do not find significant effects for borrowers from the financial industry,\nwhile effects from the corporate and the real-estate sector are statistically highly significant.\nThe F-Test presented in the lower part of the table shows that the null of parameter equality\ncan be rejected at the 5% level of significance. In Panel B of Table 6, we show that these re-\nsults hold also for the PD-implied risk weight.\nOur results on listed vs. not-listed firms highlight the role of market discipline in limiting\nthe bank's discretion. Yet, we can see that banks do report lower PDs for borrowers from\nsegments that are less transparent with respect to fundamental information. Together, these\nfindings indicate that two forces are at play: opacity and market discipline.\nOur results presented above rely on a sample that spans the period of Basel II. In the peri-\nod after 2013 though, regulatory supervision has become more stringent as regards superviso-\nry assessments, stress tests, and the introduction of newer regulatory rules including several\nkey trading book measures. More precisely, the Basel Committee's phase-in period for higher\nand better quality capital requirements began from January 2013. Moreover, the Fundamental\nReview of the Trading Book, for instance, was meant to replace the crop of measures imple-\nmented through Basel 2.5 with a more coherent and consistent set of requirements, and to re-\nduce the variability in the capital numbers generated by banks for market risk. By the end of\n2013, the European Central Bank conducted the largest-ever supervisory comprehensive as-\nsessment including an EU-wide stress test exercise (e.g., Abbassi, Iyer, Peydr\u00f3, and Soto,\n2017). In November 2014, a new single supervisory authority (i.e., the Single supervisory\nmechanism, SSM) for the Eurozone was launched with the goal of supervising and monitor-\ning all banks in the euro area more narrowly. One may have the notion that before 2013, regu-\nlation was relatively lax as compared to the period thereafter. We examine the impact of the\nvariation in the regulatory supervision as of 2013 on incentive spillover across different cate-\ngories. To that aim, we have collected additional data and expand our sample to also cover the\nfor the full sample running from 2008 until 2016. The aim of this analysis is twofold. First, it\nwill allow us to examine whether our results are robust to the full sample, and second, wheth-\ner this behaviour is different depending on the period of more stringent regulatory supervision\nIn column 1 of Table 7, we can see that the coefficient on mRWA is still significant and\neconomically meaningful. We find that an IRB bank with a one-standard-deviation higher\nmarket risk exposure reports lower PD-implied risk weights by 0.02 percentage points, which\ntranslates into a reduction of risk weights by about 2.67 percentage points. The estimated co-\nefficient suggests that our finding on the incentive spillover across different categories is ro-\nbust to the extension of the sample. To examine whether there is a differential effect between\nthe two periods, i.e., before vs. after 2012, we interact our main variable mRWA/TA (and Tier\n1-ratio) with a factor variable that equals the value of one for all quarters from 2013:Q1 until\n2016:Q4, and zero otherwise. Interestingly, in column 2 of Table 7 we can see that this rela-\ntionship is positive (negative for Tier 1-ratio) and statistically significant during the period af-\nter 2012. The overall effect for the post-2013 period is then the sum of the estimated coeffi-\ncient on mRWA/TA and the interaction term, which together is statistically not different from\nzero. The respective F-test (not reported) cannot reject the null that (mRWA/TA) \u00ad\n(mRWA/TA*Basel III phase in) = 0 at any conventional significance level. This implies that\nour finding is particularly present during the period before 2013. Interestingly, we find similar\nresults also for the Tier 1-ratio. In column 3 and 4, we replicate our analysis but condition on\nIRB banks with the lowest (bottom 25th percentile of Tier 1 capital ratio) and highest (top 25th\npercentile of Tier 1 capital ratio) ex-ante regulatory capital ratio, respectively. We thus mimic\nour analysis from column 4 and 5 of Table 3. However, we find that during the post-2013 pe-\nriod our finding is still present for banks with more binding capital constraints. These findings\nsuggest that the increasing regulatory pressure as of 2013 might have hampered the use of\nIRB model discretion for some banks, but not for banks with more binding capital constraints.\nYet, an alternative interpretation could be that the weaker result observed during the post-\n2013 period relates to the fading effect of the financial crisis, suggesting that incentive spillo-\nvers of the kind we document in this paper should be more pronounced during periods of\nhigher market risk and more binding capital constraints, respectively. Common to both inter-\npretations though is that regulators and supervisors are advised to use a comprehensive view\non risk reporting in future supervisory practice.\nIn this paper, we examine whether banks that use the internal ratings-based approach to\ncapital regulation strategically report lower credit risks for their credit portfolio when they are\nmore exposed to market risk. We find that IRB banks report lower PDs when they have more\nrisk exposure in their trading book (as compared to banks with lower market risk). This result\nis especially strong for banks that face regulatory capital constraints. We find that this behav-\niour affects risk weights and thus the level of required capital to an economically meaningful\nextent. An IRB bank with a one-standard-deviation higher market risk exposure reports lower\ncredit risk weights by 4.91 percentage points for the same borrower at the same time. Given\nthat IRB banks are mostly larger banks in Germany, and their total asset size accounts for\n160% of German GDP (as at 2012), our results suggest a significant risk to financial stability.\nTo understand the economic channel behind these results, we relate the observed behav-\niour to the discretion inherent to the models that IRB banks use under the IRB approach. For\ninstance, we examine whether lower PDs are reported under both the A-IRB and F-IRB. We\nfind that our result only holds for banks using the Advanced-IRB approach but not for banks\nthat employ the Foundation-IRB approach, which suggest that there is a self-selection in the\ndecision of which approach (A-IRB vs. F-IRB) to choose. That is, especially those banks may\nchoose the A-IRB approach over F-IRB, which intend to exploit the greater discretion. Also,\nwe find that the systematic incentive spillover is weaker when market discipline is higher and\nstronger for non-transparent borrowers with respect to fundamental information. Further, we\nfind that more stringent regulatory supervision hampers the use of IRB model discretion for\nsome banks, but not for institutions with more binding capital constraints.\nOur findings have important policy implications. First, they show that banks use the dis-\ncretion inherent to their models to manage adverse fluctuations across different asset catego-\nries. Second, they reveal that banks optimize risk and thus regulatory risk weights at an ag-\ngregate overall-risk level as opposed to the asset-specific-risk level. Our results therefore sug-\ngest that regulators should continue fostering the comprehensive view on the different bank\nrisk dimensions in their ongoing supervisory task.\nREFERENCES\nAbbassi, P., Iyer, R., Peydr\u00f3, J.L., and P.E.
