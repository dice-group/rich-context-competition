Such questions lie at\nthe heart of applied sociology. In particular, estimates of the\nsize of hidden populations often hinge on data drawn from a\nsingle source, such as arrests or hospital admissions, whose\nrelationship to overall population levels remains largely un-\nknown, leaving both policy makers and researchers unsatisfied\nwith results. Recent modeling work not withstanding (Simeone\ncussion) this represents a less than ideal situation, a point aptly\nsummed up in the titled of a recent article: \"The numbers game:\nLet's all guess the size of the illegal drug industry!\" (Thoumi,\n2005). As noted by Thoumi, such problems are particularly true\nfor drug using populations, where limited data from disparate\nsources often indicates countervailing trends, yet population\nestimates and overall community dynamics continue to occupy\nimportant policy decisions. In these situations, research con-\nfronts hidden populations whose illegal behaviors invoke the\nneed for anonymous sampling, further exacerbating an already\ndifficult research scenario.\nNew York City methamphetamine users represent such a\npopulation. Indeed, meth-users in NYC have received little\nattention until recently when concern about growing levels of\nmethamphetamine use were associated HIV risk behaviors in\nthe MSM (men who have sex with men)/gay community\nhas actually been available in New York City for decades (Drug\nIntelligence Center (NDIC) 2008). Yet New York's metham-\nphetamine markets have remained mostly inaccessible to re-\nsearchers, and the small body of literature that is currently\navailable on methamphetamine use in New York City focuses\nmainly on use among MSM while offering little information\nabout market size, numbers of users, or distribution in general;\nnor about use outside of MSM communities, and what effect\nthis has on the total number of users in the area. Local data such\nthat the national estimate of methamphetamine-related emer-\ndeclines in those testing positive for methamphetamine upon\narrest, the NDIC (2008) notes that \"the number of ampheta-\nmine-related (including methamphetamine-related) admissions\nto publicly funded treatment facilities in the New York/New\nNetwork-Based Population Estimates\nEstimation techniques for hidden population sizes using so-\ncial network techniques have grown as sociological exposure to\nsocial network analysis has exploded over the last two decades.\nAmong the most popular of these techniques is Respondent\n*Corresponding author.\nDriven Sampling developed by sociologist Douglas Heckathorn\nJohnston et al., 2008). However, RDS does not present overall\npopulation sizes (rather, only population prevalences) and has\nrecently received some criticism for its base estimation proce-\ndures (see Gile et al., 2012 for a summary of those criticisms).\nHandcock and Giles' proposed replacement estimator (the \"se-\nquential sampling\" estimator, see Gile & Handcock, 2010)\nrelies, however, on an estimate of the total size of the hidden\npopulation--and thus reintroduces a variable that the original\nRDS estimators had sought to escape. Given the adoption of\nRDS estimation by the World Health Organization (for esti-\nmating national rates of HIV and AIDS) and UNAIDS, and\ngrowing interest in using network techniques in determining\noverall size estimations of hidden populations, in this paper we\npropose a method of network-based capture-recapture popula-\ntion estimation that involves only a single sampling round\n(rather than the two rounds implied by standard capture-re-\ncapture techniques) and which can be used to supplement\nRDS data collection or more conventional venue based ap-\nproaches.\nThe method proposed below is capable of producing total\npopulation estimates which can be used with the Gile and\nHandcock estimator, or as a means for supplementing the\noriginal RDS estimator with a total population estimate for the\ngroup in question. And perhaps most importantly, it does so\nwhile maintaining respondent anonymity, a crucial considera-\ntion when dealing with drug using and other illegal or highly\nstigmatized behaviors. This factor, taken together with the fact\nthat the recapture phase takes place simultaneous with the\noriginal capture phase of the sampling, and the easy fit of the\ntechnique with ordinary RDS methods, creates what we feel to\nbe an important new tool for applied sociological research. To\nshow an application of the technique in concrete terms, we\ndemonstrate the development of an estimate for the population\nof methamphetamine users in New York City.\nThis method contrasts with two other network-related at-\ntempts to estimate total population size: 1) network scale-up\nmethods and 2) other capture-recapture methods using multiple\nRDS samples. In the words of a recent summary, network\nscale-up methods (or NSUM) \"rests on the assumption that\npeople's social networks--the set of people whom you `know'\n--are, on average, representative of the general population in\nwhich you live and move\" (Bernard et al., 2010: p. ii12). In this\nprocedure, individual estimates of sub-populations are \"scaled\"\nto aggregate levels, and the estimates of many individuals are\ncombined. For example, if a respondent answers that he/she\nknows two pregnant women out of a total of 100 contacts, we\ncould estimate the number of pregnant women in his/her county\ncombining this estimate with the estimates drawn from many\nothers, more accurate figures can be obtained. NSUM advo-\ncates see this as a means for estimating the size of sub-popula-\ntions that may be known but difficult to enumerate. Still, sig-\nnificant problems arise for NSUM methods when trying to\nestimate rates of participation in activities that individuals\nmight try to keep secret even (or especially) from close associ-\nates (see Salganik et al., 2011). Such a situation, obviously,\ncould occur with any illegal or highly stigmatized activity, such\nas illegal drug use.\nA second popular method of estimation depends less on in-\nformation known to individuals and more on researchers ability\nto reach hidden populations repeatedly (by means, for example,\nsuch as successive waves of Respondent Driven Sampling).\nAccording to the logic of capture-recapture studies, successive\nsamples that discover a proportion of identical individuals can\nbe used to estimate the total population size by the well-known\nLincoln-Peterson formula (discussed below). Multiple resam-\npling increases the accuracy of these predictions. Where RDS\nhas proven capable of reaching large samples of hidden popula-\ntions, it would appear ideally suited to such tasks. Problems\narise, however, where initial sampling paths can be seen to\naffect subsequent referral paths, thus skewing the \"recapture\"\nprocess to those in the original sample (and resulting in an in-\naccurate recapture number, see Berchenko & Frost, 2011).\nGiven these issues, what seems needed is a process that is less\nsusceptible to discovery bias around stigmatized behaviors (a\nproblem for NSUM) and not dependent on resampling proce-\ndures that may be biased by initial sampling (as is the issue for\nRDS-based capture-recapture methods), and finally, one that is\ncapable of retaining respondent anonymity throughout the re-\nsearch process. Below we propose such a method.\nEstimating the Size of the NYC\nMethamphetamine Using Population\nIn an attempt to estimate the size of the New York City\nmethamphetamine using population, we have developed a net-\nwork-based variant of standard capture-recapture methods that\nis capable of estimating the total size of a hidden, networked\npopulation from a network sample of current users, even while\nmaintaining respondent anonymity. The proposed method re-\nquires sampling from each respondent's network connections,\nand matching these connections against both the other respon-\ndents in the sample and the list of their respective contacts.\nSuch methods are not particularly complex, and make use of\ncapture/recapture methods with a long history in both social\nand biological sciences. In current circumstances, however,\nconsiderable modifications are required, as network sampling in\nthe context of illicit and often socially stigmatized activity re-\nquires retaining anonymity of both research subjects and their\nnetwork connections. These concerns necessarily complicate\nthe matching of contacts assumed by the capture-recapture\nmethods. For this reason, a na\u00efve matching strategy of simply\nmatching the names of respondents and contacts across inter-\nviews is not possible. We address this challenge by a novel\nmeans of establishing network connections while maintaining\nthe anonymity of participants and their contacts which we refer\nto as the \"telefunken method\".\nThis process requires the recruitment of a sample pool of\nnetwork participants and the elicitation of a number of contacts\nfrom each. In addition to personal descriptives later used in the\nmatching process, each participant was asked for his/her own\n\"telefunken code\", derived from the last three digits of their\nown mobile phone number. To arrive at the code, each of the\nthree digits is encoded as being either even or odd, and low or\nhigh (with 4.5 being the threshold). Together with height, ap-\nproximate weight, hair color, eye color, gender, and race/eth-\nnicity, this produced a six bit code for each respondent that\nserved in matching the respondent to contacts reported by other\nstudy respondents1. Importantly, the telefunken encoding en-\nsures (and assures) that actual telephone numbers of respon-\ndents remain unknown to researchers throughout the study. As\nwill be seen below, a critical question raised by this method is\nthe estimation of error scores (in the event of false matches\nbetween individuals who by coincidence have the same code)\nand error estimation of the resulting population estimate. We\nnote that these questions would be greatly simplified by attain-\ning a code for more phone number digits. In our case, however,\npre-testing found that asking for more than 3 digits raised sus-\npicion among our research subjects and equally importantly,\nquestions about the assurance of anonymity by our Institutional\nReview Board. Given these concerns, a method capable of\nproducing and bounding an estimate within a range of confi-\ndence estimates seems particularly important.\nIn the current study, respondents were recruited using Re-\nspondent Driven Sampling (RDS), an established research\nmethod for anonymously recruiting hard-to-reach populations\nmethamphetamine user network. This process resulted in the\nrecruitment of 132 eligible participants, starting from (n = 37)\nRDS \"seeds\" reached using a Craigslist advertisement. Addi-\ntional (n = 95) respondents were obtained by referrals via the\nstandard RDS protocol. Respondent interviews included a\nnumber of use-related questions, and the appearance-based and\ndemographic information. Further, in addition to their own\npersonal information and telefunken code, each respondent was\nasked to select up to five methamphetamine-using contacts\nwhose phone number they currently had in their mobile phone's\ndirectory. This selection was carried out by choosing initial\nletters of last names from a randomized list of alphabet letters2.\nThe respondent was then questioned about the randomly se-\nlected contacts, in order to obtain data on the contacts' personal\ncharacteristics (approximate height, approximate weight, hair\ncolor, eye color, gender, and race/ethnicity) and telefunken code.\nFor purposes of the population estimate, project respondents\nwere treated as the \"capture\" population, while each of the\ncontacts provided during the interviews (\"reports\") was consid-\nered a \"recapture assay\". By finding the number of original\nrespondents discovered via recapture assays (as a proportion of\nthe total number of assays), researchers had a basis for esti-\nmateing the overall size of the population under consideration.\nAgain, among the main contribution of the proposed method is\nthat anonymity can be maintained throughout the process, with\npersonal descriptions and telefunken codes together forming the\nsole means of identification and matching.\nCapture-recapture methods have been used extensively in es-\ntimating population levels in biology and epidemiology, and\nmore recently, employed in conjunction with methods designed\nto sample hidden populations of people (Bouchard, 2007; Hope\nproaches is not normally the validity of the standard Lin-\ncoln-Peterson methodology or its appropriateness to the prob-\nlem, but rather the question of whether the original \"capture\" or\nsubsequent \"recapture\" techniques are, in fact, sufficiently ran-\ndom (see Berchenko & Frost, 2011 for review and discussion).\nThis issue is taken up in the discussion, below, but we note here\nthat one difference between past studies and the method de-\nscribed here is that this method does not depend on data from\noutside the study (such as arrest numbers or hospital admissions)\nto determine either the capture or recapture statistic. Both are\ndetermined simultaneously during the sampling/recruitment\nprocess. Whether this results in an advantage or disadvantage\nover capture-recapture methods dependent on external data\nsources likely depends on context. Regardless, in this sense the\nproposed strategy represents a significant departure from other\nuses of capture-recapture in drug use and other research.\nThe remainder of this paper details the steps involved in two\nseparate attempts to estimate the methamphetamine using\npopulation in New York City3. As will be seen below, an esti-\nmate from the joint population was required due to the small\nsample size of the research population. Even with this second\nstep, the range of estimates is still quite wide. One may con-\nclude from this fact that the current method leaves much to be\ndesired. The \"cup half full\" interpretation, however, is that the\ncurrent method is able to produce a statistically sound method\nfor population estimation of a hidden population from a rela-\ntively small sample, and to do so while maintaining anonymity.\nIt is this fact that, we feel, makes this method an important new\ntool in research on illegal activities where questions of ano-\nnymity and the protection of human subjects are paramount.\nBaseline Estimate\nThe population estimate (P) entails a capture/recapture form\nof estimation using the respondents (n = 132) to define the\ncapture population, and matches between the reports (s = 466)\nand the respondents to define the recaptured subset. Matches\nare defined by considering seven categorical variables: tele-\nfunken code, gender, race, height, weight, hair color, and eye\ncolor. A respondent from the original sample was said to\n\"match\" a report if the two agreed on all seven of these vari-\nables. With this definition, we found there were 11 matches\nmatches were used to define the recapture number (t = 11).\nNa\u00efve extrapolation from this capture/recapture paradigm using\nthe Lincoln-Peterson method yields:\nn s\nP\nt\n\nwhere P is the total estimated population, n is the size of the\ncapture population, t is the recapture number, and s is the num-\nber of recapture assays. Using 11 matches between 466 reports,\nand an initial sample of 132 respondents, yields a population\nestimate P = 5592. The sections that follow provide successive\nrefinements to this figure.\n3The choice of NYC was not arbitrary. We received a grant to do a popula-\ntion estimate of methamphetamine users in New York City (among other\nthings) from the US National Institute of Justice, and so the necessary data\nwas collected there. No similar data is available for a similar population in\nanother city for comparative purposes, nor are other formal estimates for\nthe size of the NYC meth using population available via other methods.\nThis significantly limits the comparability of the results and the opportuni-\nties for their verification by other means, though we hope this will be reme-\ndied in the future.\n4The details of the matching procedure, which utilized approximate match-\ning of height, weight, and other continuous variables, is described in the\nappendix of the original project report (Wendel et al., 2011).\n1For example, the telefunken code for any phone numbers which end in 123\n(or 343, or 301) is odd-even-odd-low-low-low, while for phone numbers\nending in 701 (or 523) the code is odd-even-odd-high-low-low. The name\n\"telefunken\" is borrowed from a Frank Zappa song (from the album Joe's\nGarage). It is intended to imply \"funky telephone\" code, as we felt like this\nwas a good description of the coding method used here.\n2Those respondents with five or fewer use-contacts in their mobile phone\ndirectory simply selected all of them without using the randomized alphabet\npage.\nFalse Matches\nThe matching technique maintains anonymity of both re-\nspondents and reports by considering general characteristics\nthat are shared by entire segments of the ambient population of\nmethamphetamine users, but the technique also introduces the\npossibility of \"false matches\" during the matching process. In\nparticular, a false match occurs whenever a report \"matches\" a\nrespondent based on agreement across all seven criteria, but\nwhen the report actually refers to someone outside of our sam-\nple. Indeed, because false matches are possible, we have possi-\nbly over-estimated the recapture number (t = 11), and hence the\nP = 5592 estimate should be taken as a conservative lower es-\ntimate of population size.\nTo further refine the population estimate, it is necessary to\nconsider the probability distribution governing the number of\nmatches (amongst the 11 telefunken matches observed) that are\nlikely to be \"false\".\nInitial Estimation via Marginals\nTo estimate the expected number of false matches E[F], we\nshall need to refer to the marginal sample distributions of each\ncategorical variable involved in the matching process (see Ta-\nble 1). We assume that the sample size is large enough so that\nits marginals approximate the population marginals. In addition,\nin this first attempt at refining the population estimate, we as-\nsume that the six categorical variables are independent. We\nbegin by way of illustrative example. Consider a categorical vari-\nable V, say Gender. The possible values assumed by V are known:\n \nMale, Female, Transgender\nx x x\n  \nand associated probabilities are computable from the marginals\nin Table 1:\nSuppose we choose two individuals at random from an infi-\nnite population satisfying the above marginal distribution for\nmale, the probability that both individuals in this pair will be\nlarly, the probability of the two individuals both being female is\nprobability of the individuals both being transgender is (2/132)2\nmatch across the Gender variable is then given by:\n     \n  \nRepeating this same calculation we can determine the prob-\nability of agreement between the two individuals for each of the\nother variables (race, gender, hair color, eye color, height and\nweight). The results are shown in Table 2. Now, assuming\nindependent sequential assignment of categorical variables, the\nprobability that two randomly chosen individuals will match on\nall six descriptive categorical variables is the product of the\nindividual probabilities listed in Table 2:\n      \nSince each telefunken code is 6 bits, there are 26 = 64 distinct\ncodes, and thus, the probability that two individuals will match\nby sheer chance, is given by:\nSample distributions by attribute values.\nAttribute\n(k)\nCategory (n=)\nBlack (65) Brown (21) Blonde (3) Grey/Salt and Pepper\nHeight (5)\nWeight (5)\nProbability of agreement between randomly selected sample members\nby attributes.\nAttribute Sum of the Squares of the Marginals\nProbability of\nAgreement\n \n    .\nFor any specific respondent then, the expected the number of\nreports (drawn from a population represented accurately by the\nsample itself) that would telefunken match by sheer chance is:\n \n \n    .\nThe expected total number of false matches over all (n = 132)\nrespondents can now be estimated using linearity of expecta-\ntion:\n \nF \n   \nThe number F' = 3.58 provides an initial estimate of E[F] \nF' which takes into account the marginal distributions of the\npopulation from which the sample is drawn (to the extent that\nthe marginals of the population conform to those of the sample).\nAdjusting the recapture number t' = t - F' to incorporate these\nBetter Estimate via the Joint\nThe previous estimate of false matches provided a first at-\ntempt at correcting for the fact that the number of matches gen-\nerally exceeds the true recapture set. Nonetheless, there are\nsome shortcomings to the false match estimation procedure\ndescribed above. In particular, the procedure outlined above\nassumed independent assignment of categorical variables,\nwhere in actuality our sample did not always reflect this as-\nsumption, since several variables were clearly not independent\n(e.g. height and weight). In more formal terms, the joint prob-\nability of randomly finding someone of African American eth-\nnicity with blond hair, for example, was not well-estimated by\nthe product of probabilities specified in the marginal distribu-\ntions of ethnicity and hair color. Indeed, the only property that\none could safely assume to be independent of all others is the\ntelefunken code.\nOne approach to the problem of non-independence would be\nto establish the relationships among the six attributes used in\nthe matching process. However, quantifying the dependencies\nbetween the six variables would be daunting. Instead, we chose\nto consider all six variables simultaneously using a single joint\ndistribution across all possible combinations of their values.\nSuch an approach presented its own difficulties, however. To\ndescribe these issues, it is helpful to define the notion of a class\nto be a six-tuple of attribute values (one value for each of the\nsix variables). Let C denote the set of distinct classes that might\nbe manifested by study respondents. Examining the categories\nlisted in Table 1, we see that:\nC       \nclasses were actually manifested by the (n = 132) sampled re-\nspondents. Thus, the sample provided very little information\nabout the relative likelihoods of classes under the joint distribu-\ntion, since the sample distribution over C was either 0 or 1/132\nacross almost all classes. The source of this difficulty was due\nto having too small a sample to effectively model the joint dis-\ntribution, and was this addressed by the best-case-available\nremedy of adding the (s = 466) reports to the (n = 132) sample\nto obtain a larger \"extended sample\" of 598 individuals. When\nthe joint distribution was estimated using this extended sample,\nit was found to manifest non-zero probabilities for 290 distinct\nclasses in C with broad variations in probability mass. For ex-\nample, two classes exhibiting non-zero probability were:\nHispanic, male, black hair, brown eyes, 5'4\"-5'8\",\nthese characteristics)\nand\nBlack, female, black hair, brown eyes, 5'7\"-5'11\",\ncharacteristics).\nRestated more formally, the joint distribution is defined over\nthe set of classes ci\nin C, and the joint probability of an indi-\nvidual belonging to class ci\n, denoted p(ci\n), can be estimated\nusing the proportion of individuals in the extended sample that\nwere found to belong to class ci\n. To the extent that the distribu-\ntion\n \n \ni i\np c c C\n\nreflects the characteristics of the ambient population, the prob-\nability that two individuals a and b, randomly chosen from an\ninfinite population, would be found to belong to a particular\nclass ci\nis:\ni i i\np c p c p c\n \nSince class membership is mutually exclusive, the probabil-\nity that a and b would belong to the same class (irrespective of\nwhich particular class), is given by:\n   \nProb class class\ni\nc C i\na b p\n\nIn the specific case of our data on New York City's\nmethamphetamine-using population, the expression in Equation\nprobability that a and b will share the same telefunken code\n(1/64), yields the probability that two randomly chosen indi-\nviduals will match by sheer chance:\n \n\nApplying linearity of expectation, each specific participant\nexpects:\n \n \n   \nreports (from among the 466) to match him/her by sheer chance.\nLinearity of expectation applied once more yields the total\nnumber of matches between the (n = 132) respondents and the\n(s = 466) reports that are attributable to sheer chance:\n \nF \n    \nThe number F provides a more refined estimate of E[F] \nF, since it takes into account the joint distribution of the am-\nbient population from which the sample was drawn (to the ex-\ntent that the distribution of attributes in the population con-\nforms to that of the extended sample). Adjusting the recapture\nnumber t = t - F to incorporate this more refined analysis of\nwhich we derive the revised population estimate of P =\nRange of Estimates\nDeveloping a range of plausible population estimates re-\nquires moving beyond the study of expected values (i.e. E[F] ),\nto acquire a deeper understanding of the probability distribution\ngoverning the number of false matches F. We begin by noting\nthat F represents the number of successes in a Bernoulli se-\npossible hits per throw--where the probability of success in\nany given trial is 9.7 \u00d7 10-5 (see Equation (3)). The standard\ndeviation of F is thus given by a well-known fact concerning\nBernoulli distributions:\n     \nstd F  \n      \nThis standard deviation can be used as a measure of the\nvariability of F.\nPopulation estimates based on the expected number of false\nmatches should be seen as the midpoint of a range of estimates.\nOur estimate F can be better adjusted to incorporate this vari-\nability\nE F F std F\n    \nfalse matches is:\n \nP    .\n \nP    .\nBy considering one standard deviation of the random vari-\nable F around its estimated mean, we obtain a range of popula-\nConfidence Intervals\nTo obtain confidence intervals for population estimates we\nuse the Chernoff bound for the upper and lower tail of the dis-\ntribution:\n   \n \n  \n \n\n.\ne\n\n \n \n  \n \n\n \n   \n \n  \n \n\ne\n\n\n \n \n  \n \n\n \n.\nUsing the previous F estimate of E[F], the upper and lower\nbounds corresponding to these two equations are listed in the\nTable 3.
