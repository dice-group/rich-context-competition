The study cohort\nSerf-reports of hospitalization for breast cancer were confirmed as accurate for 100% of cases where a hospital\nrecord was available. Self-report accuracy was also high for ischemic heart disease (84%), cataract (83%), and hip\nfracture (81 %); it was moderate for lung cancer (78%), prostate cancer (75%), gallbladder disease (74%), colon\ncancer (71%), and stroke (67%); but it was low for ulcers (54%) and colon polyps (32%). Some of the self-reports\nof ulcers (20%), hip fracture (9%), ischemic heart disease (7%), and stroke (7%) were found to reflect diagnoses of\nother conditions of anatomic proximity. Accuracy of self-reports improved with higher levels of education, but was\nnot generally related to age, gender, race, alcohol use, or smoking. The results suggest that self-reports of some\ndiseases can be taken as accurate, but self-reports of other conditions might require medical record verification in\nchronic disease; epidemiologic methods; hospital records; prospective studies; questionnaires;\nreproducibility of results\nEmploying self-reports of major illnesses and health\nevents is the most practical method of assessing dis-\nease status in large prospective studies. However, the\nquality and accuracy of self-reports may vary by type\nof illness (1, 2), age, education, time since diagnosis,\nand method of interviewing (3-6). For example, in a\nprospective study of elderly women, in self-reporting\nfractures, those participants who graduated from col-\nlege were more accurate than those with less education\n(4). The accuracy of self-reported age at menopause in\nthe Nurses' Health Study (3) was higher among nurses\nwho had undergone surgical menopause and lower\namong nurses with a relatively longer elapsed time\nfrom menopause.

We\nalso examined whether various respondent character-\nistics, such as age, race, gender, education, alcohol\nconsumption, and smoking status, might affect the\nvalidity of self-reports.\nStudy population\nThe First National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES I) was conducted by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics in collaboration with\nother US Public Health Service agencies from 1971 to\n1975. NHANES I was based on a representative sam-\npie of Americans aged 1-74 years. Four waves of\nwave of the First National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey Epidemiologic Followup Study\n(NHEFS). The design and the methods of NHEFS\nhave been published elsewhere (10). The follow-up\nincluded a personal interview of participants in which\nthey were asked whether they had ever had certain\ndiseases and whether they had been hospitalized for\nthese diseases subsequent to 1970. Interview data were\nwho were successfully traced from the NHANESI and\nwho were aged 25-74 years at baseline examination.\nWe excluded 1,697 individuals from our study for\nwhom information had been provided by a proxy\n(where the subject was deceased or incapacitated)\nbecause of differences in the accuracy of proxy pro-\nvided data compared with self-reports (4, 11). Thus,\nour final study cohort comprised 10,523 participants.\nInterview\nThe NHEFS investigators collected information on\nmore than 40 conditions (see Appendix); 11 of these\nconditions that we thought would represent a range of\ntypes of serious illnesses were chosen for analysis.\nThese conditions include ischemic heart disease (heart\nattack and angina), stroke (including small stroke\n(transient ischemic attack) and cerebrovascular acci-\ndent), gallbladder disease, ulcers of the stomach or\nduodenum, cataract, hip fracture, colon polyps, and\ncancers of the colon, breast, prostate, and lung.\nFor each disease, interviewers collected information\non the occurrence, the year it first occurred, whether\nthe subject had been hospitalized for that disease since\n1970, and the name of the facility where the subject\nwas hospitalized. Participants were asked: \"Did a doc-\ntor ever tell you that you had. . . ?\" If participants\nanswered \"yes\" they were then asked: \"In what year\nwere you first told that you had this condition?\" and,\n\"Since 1970, have you been hospitalized overnight for\nthis condition?\" Only those subjects who reported they\nwere first told about the condition by a doctor between\nported having one or more of the 11 study conditions,\none or more of these conditions during the relevant\ntime period.\nHospital records\nNHEFS researchers tried to obtain complete records\nfrom all hospitals and nursing homes reported by the\nparticipants. Each participant reporting admission to a\nhospital or nursing home was requested to sign a form\nauthorizing the health care facility to release the re-\nquired information. The facility staff were asked to\nabstract all discharge diagnoses and procedures onto a\nspecial form and to identify the principal diagnosis.\nUsually, the facility attached a copy of the hospital or\nnursing home discharge summary or the medical\nrecord face sheet to the abstract. Before entering the\ninformation into the NHEFS database, the abstract\nform was compared with the discharge summary or\nface sheet. Discrepancies between the diagnosis on the\nabstract form and the face sheet or discharge summary\nwere resolved in favor of the latter two documents.\nDiagnoses on each hospital or nursing home record\nwere coded using the International Classification of\nDiseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-\nCM) (12). As many as 10 diagnoses for each overnight\nstay from the abstract form, discharge summary, or\nface sheet were entered into the database. Records\nreported overnight stays because the participant re-\nfused to sign the consent form, the hospital refused or\nwas not able to respond, or the hospital had no record\nof a stay.\nData analysis\nWe compared the interview responses about hospi-\ntalization for the 11 self-reported conditions with all\nthe diagnoses provided by the health care facilities.\nEach self-report for which at least one hospital record\nwas available (n = 1,666) was categorized as a true\npositive or a false positive. We defined true positive as\nan exact match of the participant's self-reported hos-\npitalized condition with one of the available hospital\nor nursing home diagnoses, whereas we defined a\nself-report as false positive if the hospital or nursing\nhome diagnoses did not match the self-reported con-\ndition. We also did not accept diagnoses which were\nclosely related, primarily due to anatomic proximity,\nor which matched the self-report but were labeled as\n\"probable\" or \"possible\" on the hospital report. The\nAppendix table lists the ICD-9-CM codes correspond-\ning to the conditions we studied as well as the closely\nrelated diagnoses.\nThe true-positive rate measures the probability for a\nself-reported hospitalization diagnosis to be confirmed\nby hospital or nursing home records. The 95 percent\nconfidence interval for each true-positive rate was\ncalculated. Since the NHEFS requested information\nonly from those health care facilities named by indi-\nviduals reporting a hospitalization, we were unable to\nestimate the true-negative rate of self-reports (the\nprobability that a hospitalization for a condition was,\nValidity of Self-reported Hospitalization Diagnoses 971\nin fact, absent when the subject did not report the\nhospitalization).\nStratified analysis of true-positive rates for each\ncondition by gender and by levels of race, age, edu-\ncation, alcohol consumption, and smoking were cal-\nculated. Because of the small numbers, all four cancers\nwere combined into one cancer category for this anal-\nyears, or older than 64 years. Years of formal educa-\nmore than 12 years, and not ascertained. We catego-\nrized race as white, nonwhite, and not ascertained.\nAlcohol drinking during the past year at baseline was\nclassified as never drinking alcohol, drinking less than\none time per month, drinking one time per month to\nthree times per week, drinking more than three times\nper week, and not ascertained. We defined smoking at\nbaseline based on information from the NHANES I\ninterview supplemented by retrospective self-reports\nformer smoker, current smoker, and not ascertained\nThe Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic for general\nassociation (14-17) was used to assess differences in\nself-reported conditions and hospitalizations across\nstrata of age and across strata of gender, race, educa-\ntion, alcohol drinking, and smoking adjusting for age.\nBecause of the large sample size, p values of <0.001\nwere considered to be significant. Differences in the\ntrue-positive rates for each condition across strata of\nthe sociodemographic and behavior variables, adjust-\ning for each other, were estimated, considering p val-\nues of <0.05 to be significant.\nRESULTS\nThe larger proportion of the study participants who\nreported at least one condition were aged 65 years or\nolder and were white. The percentage of individuals\nreporting overnight stays in health care facilities dif-\nfered by age and years of formal education, but not\nby gender, race, alcohol consumption, or smoking\n(table 1).\nOlder participants, males, and former smokers\ntended to report ischemic heart disease, as well as\nhospitalization for that condition, more frequently.\nThe proportion of self-reports with increasing formal\nyears of education, and the proportion of self-reported\novernight stays in a facility, for ischemic heart disease\ndecreased across strata defined by years of formal\neducation (data not shown). A higher proportion of\nwomen than men reported that they had been diag-\nnosed with gallbladder disease and hip fracture. The\npercentage of self-reported ulcers, and hospitalization\nfor ulcers, were higher among current smokers than\nformer smokers and nonsmokers (data not shown).\nThe conditions reported most frequently were cata-\nracts, ischemic heart disease, gallbladder disease, and\nulcers of the stomach and duodenum (table 2). The\navailability of medical records ranged from 80 percent\n(prostate cancer) to 92 percent (stroke, ulcers, and\nbreast cancer). Cerebrovascular accident, hip fracture,\nand cancers were the least frequently reported condi-\ntions in the study population, but had the highest\nproportion of hospitalizations (greater than 90 per-\ncent). Three-fourths of the individuals reporting ische-\nmic heart disease or gallbladder disease reported they\nhad been hospitalized, whereas 59 percent reporting\ncolon polyps, 37 percent reporting ulcers, and just 31\npercent reporting cataracts reported a hospitalization\nfor these conditions.\nTrue-positive rates for self-reports of hospitalization\nbecause of a particular condition ranged from 32 per-\ncent for colon polyps to 100 percent for breast cancer\n(table 2). The true-positive rates for ischemic heart\ndisease, myocardial infarction, cataract, hip fracture,\nand breast cancer were all greater than 80 percent. A\nsmall proportion of self-reports (0-4 percent) were\nlabeled false positive because the diagnosis on the\nhospital or nursing home chart was expressed as\n\"probable\" or \"possible\". Nonmatching but closely\nrelated diagnoses accounted for 7 percent of self-\nreported hospitalizations for ischemic heart disease\nand stroke, for 20 percent of self-reported ulcers, and\nfor 29 percent of self-reported colon polyps. Between\nabout one-fourth and one-third of self-reported hospi-\ntalizations for colon polyps, colon cancer, gallbladder\ndisease, ulcers, prostate and lung cancer, and stroke\nwere defined as false positives because of unrelated\ndiagnoses. A comparable low proportion (9-13 per-\ncent) of unrelated diagnoses was observed for self-\nreported hospitalizations for ischemic heart disease,\nhip fracture, and cataract.\nThe percentage of true-positive self-reports of cer-\ntain diseases varied by gender, age, and race (table 3).\nSelf-reports by women of hospitalization for gallblad-\nder disease were more likely to be true positive than\nself-reports by men (77 percent versus 65 percent).\nTrue-positive rates for ischemic heart disease, stroke,\nand ulcers were higher in the older age ranges. Self-\nreports of colon polyps by nonwhite participants were\nmore likely to be true positive than those by whites (86\npercent versus 29 percent). Participants with more\nthan 12 years of formal education were more likely to\nhave a higher true-positive rate for colon polyps than\nparticipants with less than 12 years of formal educa-\ntion (45 percent versus 28 percent for participants with\nTABLE 1.

No significant differences in self-report accuracy\nfor any of the conditions analyzed were associated\nwith alcohol consumption or smoking.\nDISCUSSION\nAs we had expected, hospitalization rates varied\nsubstantially among the 11 conditions we selected for\nanalysis, as did the validity of the self-reports. Almost\nall individuals reporting hip fracture or cancer reported\nhospitalization, but hospitalization was reported by\nonly a small percentage of those reporting ulcers,\ncataracts, or colon polyps. The true-positive rate for\nself-reports of hospitalization for ischemic heart dis-\nease (heart attack and angina combined) in our study\nwas 84 percent. Looking at self-reported hospitaliza-\ntion for angina and for heart attack separately revealed\na high true-positive rate for self-reports of heart attack\nbut a low true-positive rate for angina. Other studies\n60-70 percent for myocardial infarction. Rosamond et\nal. (19) revealed 40 percent of false-positive self-\nreports of myocardial infarction being actually hospi-\ntaUzations for other heart disorders, primarily unstable\nangina. Heart attack in our study frequently was mis-\nreported as angina. Thirty-five percent of the false-\npositive self-reports of angina in fact were myocardial\ninfarction or ischemic heart conditions. Our high true-\npositive rate (81 percent) for hip fracture is consistent\nwith other studies: Paganini-Hill and Chao (5) re-\nported true-positive rates of 91 and 93 percent for\nself-reports of hip fracture in two follow-ups of the\nLeisure World Disease and Prevention Study. In a\nstudy of osteoporotic fractures among 9,704 nonblack\nwomen aged 65 years or older, Nevitt et al. (4) found\nthat 85 percent of self-reports of hip fracture were\nverified by radiologic reports.

However, the\ncolon cancer finding may actually be an overestimate,\nas we considered a diagnosis of cancer of the rectum\nas verification of colon cancer.

Participants in our study reported a hospitaliza-\ntion rate of only 37 percent for self-reported ulcers,\nand we confirmed just 54 percent of these hospitaliza-\ntions. Colon polyps also had a relatively low fre-\nquency of hospitalization (59 percent), and only 32\npercent of the self-reports of such hospitalizations\nwere confirmed. Thus, it appears that stomach and\nduodenal ulcers and colon polyps (at least those that\nresult in a hospitalization) are not accurately self-\nreported.\nAs have previous investigators (18, 19), we found\nthat a certain percentage of the false-positive self-\nreports of ischemic heart disease involved diagnoses\nof anatomic proximity such as acute pericarditis, myo-\ncarditis, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, diseases of the\npulmonary circulation, and hypertensive heart disease.\nA considerable number of false-positive reports of\ncolon polyps also involved closely related hospital\ndiagnoses such as malignant neoplasm of the colon or\nrectum. This confusion is obviously due to the word-\ning of the question: \"Have you ever been told by a\ndoctor that you had polyps or tumor of the colon?\"\nThis result illustrates how important it is to use unam-\nbiguous wording in inquiries. A considerable number\nof false-positive stomach or duodenal ulcer reports had\na closely related hospital diagnosis, all of them for\ngastritis or duodenitis. Our results may also indicate\nthat study participants might have focused only on part\nof the information provided or might have been given\nconfusing information about the exact nature of their\nconditions.\nVery few researchers (2, 4) have examined the in-\nfluence of sociodemographic or behavioral factors on\nthe accuracy of self-reports of illness. There were\nsome differences by gender, according to type of con-\ndition, in the true-positive rates of the present study,\nwith higher true-positive rates for self-reports given by\nwomen for hospitalization for gallbladder disease.\nFurthermore, the present study found higher true-\npositive rates for self-reports of ischemic heart dis-\nease, stroke, and ulcers given by participants aged 50\nyears and older. These differences might in large part\nbe due to a higher incidence of gallbladder disease\namong women and a higher incidence of ischemic\nheart disease, stroke, and ulcers among older age\ngroups. Madow (2), however, found that women were\nslightly more likely than men to give false-positive\nself-reports. The same study found no influence of\neducation. For participants of NHEFS with more than\n12 years of education, however, the true-positive rate\nwas higher for self-reports of hospitalization for colon\npolyps. Nevitt et al. (4) also observed a higher accu-\nracy of self-reports of hip fracture when participants\nwere more highly educated.\nOne of the strengths of this analysis is that the\nNHANES I participants were a nationally representa-\nresponse rate (91 percent of targeted NHANES I par-\nticipants were successfully traced). The structure of\nthe interview in the NHEFS reduced the likelihood of\nunderreporting hospitalizations; each participant who\nreported the occurrence of a disease was then asked\nValidity of Self-reported Hospitalization Diagnoses 975\nwhether he/she had been hospitalized for that condi-\ntion. Paganini-Hill and Chao (5) have pointed out that\nthe quality of reports of overnight stays in hospitals\nincreases when a generic question about hospitaliza-\ntions is followed by questions related to specific dis-\neases. Furthermore, we defined a confirmed self-report\nconservatively by excluding hospital diagnoses which\nwere labeled as \"possible\" or \"probable\". The validity\nof self-reports for conditions not always leading to\nhospitalization is an increasingly important area for\nresearchers, as many conditions are now being treated\nonly on an outpatient basis.\nOne of the strengths of our study was to examine the\naccuracy of a self-report. Because there was no way to\nscreen records systematically from all hospitals, we\ncould not examine the issue of false-negative serf-\nreports. Additionally, the true-positive rates in our\nstudy reflected only the findings of agreement with\nhospital records for cases in which a hospital record\nwas available. The results are valid for reports of\nsurvivors since proxy reports for deceased or disabled\nparticipants were excluded from the analysis.\nIn conclusion, we found self-reports of cancer of the\nbreast, hip fracture, cataract, ischemic heart disease,\nand heart attack, respectively, to be accurate more than\n80 percent of the time. True-positive rates were lower\nfor other conditions we examined, as low as 32 percent\nfor colon polyps. We conclude that investigators\nshould be aware that errors in the reporting of condi-\ntions can create considerably more misclassification if\noutcomes are based on self-reports only. Combining\nself-reports of certain conditions with verification\nagainst medical records will, therefore, be needed for\nmany outcomes in prospective cohort studies (21).\n"
