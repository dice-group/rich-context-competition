    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe objective of this article was to estimate the prevalence of Paget's disease of bone in the United States from a\nstatistically derived sample of the general population. Pelvic radiographs obtained in the First National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-I) were reviewed for the presence of Paget's disease. Age, sex,\nand geographic distribution of Paget's disease of the pelvic region were determined. The overall prevalence of\nPaget's disease in the United States was estimated. Pelvic Paget's disease is estimated to be present in 0.71 \n0.18% of the radiographs of the general population. The disease was higher in frequency in people who were in\nthe older decades of life with the highest prevalence of 2.32  0.54% in the 65- to 74-year-old people. There is a\nslight male predominance in the 45- to 74-year age group. The regional distribution suggests the highest\nprevalence was equal in white people and black people. An estimate of the overall prevalence of Paget's disease\nin the United States was at least 1% and perhaps as much as 2% of the general population with near equal sex\n",

The age range of the\npopulation examined was from 18 to 79 years. Of the\nhad radiographs of the pelvis performed. This information\nhas been used to estimate the prevalence of osteoarthritis of\nthe knees, hips, and sacroiliac joints and examination factors\nassociated with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip.(4\u00ad7)\nAlthough there was a review of the pelvic radiographs for\narthritis, the presence of Paget's disease of bone was not\nrecorded.(4) We reviewed radiographs of the pelvic region\nobtained at the time of the NHANES-I study in order to\nestimate the prevalence of Paget's disease in the United\nStates.\n1Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, Miami Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of Miami School\nof Medicine, Miami, Florida, U.S.A.\n2Department of Biostatistics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, U.S.A.\n3Departments of Medicine and Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A.\n4Department of Diagnostic Imaging, M.

Miss-\ning films were distributed randomly through the regional\nbatches. Radiographs were repackaged from storage at the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (Bethesda, MD, U.S.A.)\nand coded and grouped by geographic area of the country.\nThey were then shipped to the radiology department of the\nUniversity of Texas, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Hous-\nton, Texas with the coordination and cooperation of the\nNational Center for Health Statistics.\nPelvic radiographs were sequentially mounted on 2 multi-\nview X-ray view boxes, each containing 150 films. Readings\nof the radiographs were performed simultaneously by 2\nreaders (R.A. and W.M.) over a 3-day period. The film\nnumber and any positive findings were recorded in detail.\nAll positive X-rays were reviewed a second time by both\nreaders before removal of the films from the view boxes. A\nthird review was conducted at a later date by one of the\nreaders (W.M.). Interpretive discrepancies were discussed at\nthe end of each reading session and an adjudicated reading\nwas recorded.\nThe radiographs were reviewed for the presence of\nPaget's disease. It was hypothesized that there would be\napproximately 50 radiographs with Paget's disease. The\nfinding of Paget's disease on the pelvic radiograph was\nbased on the following characteristic radiographic appear-\n Expansion of bone size\n Thickened, disorganized trabeculae\n Thickened, expanded cortex\n Osteosclerosis\n Deformity\nThe ilia were examined for cortical and trabecular involve-\nment. The ileopectineal line was examined for thickening\nand sclerosis (``Brim sign''). The pubis was examined for\nenlargement, deformity, or coarse trabeculation. The pelvis\nwas examined for axial migration giving the pelvic brim a\ntriangular appearance or ``triradiate'' deformity with or\nwithout protrusio acetabuli. The proximal femora and sev-\neral lumbar vertebrae were variably included in the radio-\ngraphs. The presence of Paget's disease at these sites was\nrecorded similarly. Hence, distribution of disease (ilium,\nischium, pubis, sacrum, adjacent lumbar vertebrae, femoral\nheads, and proximal femoral shafts), degree of change (1\nto 4), type of change (i.e., sclerotic or lytic), and deformity\n(protrusio acetabuli, triangulation of the pelvic brim, and\nbowed femora) were recorded.\nWhen readings were completed, radiographs were repack-\naged and returned to the National Center for Health Statis-\ntics in Washington, D.C. The National Center for Health\nStatistics then supplied the conversion from the subject's\nradiographic numbers to their subject's unique identifier\nnumber for correlation with the data tapes.\nData from the readings of pelvic radiographs for Paget's\ndisease already entered by the readers were collated in a data\nfile by X-ray number. The readings were merged into a data\nfile containing the subject's unique identifier and any other\nrelevant information drawn from the data tapes. The preva-\nlence of Paget's disease of the pelvic region in the United\nStates was estimated using the complex sample weights\nprovided by the National Center for Health Statistics\n(Bethesda, MD, U.S.A.).(9)\nThe descriptive epidemiology estimated the prevalence of\nand geographic location with 95% confidence intervals from\nthe available data.\nAnalyses were conducted at Stanford University by one of\nthe investigators (B.A.D.) using published programs in the\nStatistical Analysis System (Version 6, SAS Institute, Cary,\nN.C., U.S.A.).\nRESULTS\nThirty-one radiographs showed Paget's disease of bone\n(Table 1). Pelvic Paget's disease was present in 27 (87%)\nradiographs. Of those without pelvic involvement, one had\nPaget's disease in the fourth lumbar vertebra and the\nproximal left femur, one had proximal left femoral involve-\nment, one had the fifth lumbar vertebra involved, and one\nhad the second lumbar vertebra involved. Radiographically,\nunilateral pelvic involvement was present in 12 of the 27\n(44%) of those with pelvic Paget's disease. All radiographic\nlesions were predominantly blastic in nature. The sacroiliac\nLumbar vertebrae\nPelvis\nIleum\nIschium\nIleopectineal Line\nPubis\nProtrusio 2\nProximal femur\njoints were fused in one and three had osteoarthritis of the\nhip adjacent to the Paget's disease.\nThe crude prevalence of Paget's disease on the radio-\nwomen affected for an adjusted prevalence rate of 1.16 \nto women, 1.2:1) (Table 2).

There were no cases of Paget's disease among the 38\npeople who were Asian or of other origin.\nThe prevalence of Paget's disease by age is shown in\nTable 2. Prevalence rates increased with age, peaking in\nthose over age 65 with an age-specific\u00adadjusted prevalence\nrate of 2.3%. Only one subject below the age 45 years had\nradiographic evidence of Paget's disease.\nThe region of the United States with the highest preva-\nlence of Paget's disease was the Northeast at 1.48% with the\nlowest prevalence in the South with a prevalence of 0.26%\n(Table 3).\nDISCUSSION\nBy examining the pelvic radiographs from the NHANES-I\nstudy, we are able to estimate the prevalence of Paget's\ngeneral population. The ratio of men to women was 1.2:1;\nthe prevalence in black people was the same as in white\npeople. In addition, Paget's disease was most common in the\nnortheastern United States and least common in the South.\nCases\nAge (years)\nAll subjects\nCrude prevalence (%)\n(CI)\nAdjusted prevalence (%)\n(CI)\nMen only\nCrude prevalence (%)\n(CI)\nAdjusted prevalence (%)\n(CI)\nWomen only\nCrude prevalence (%)\n(CI)\nAdjusted prevalence (%)\n(CI)\n*\n*\n*Mean (confidence limits).\nAdjusted Prevalence rates not calculated for groups with 0 cases reported.\nCases\nRegion\nNortheast South Midwest West\nThe prevalence increased with age with the highest preva-\nlence was in those over 65 years of age.\nThere have been no similar national studies on the\nprevalence of Paget's disease of bone.

Some small series place the\nfrequency of pelvic Paget's disease at 40\u00ad91% of patients\ndisease.(26) If one estimates the overall prevalence of Paget's\ndisease by extension from the frequency of pelvic involve-\nment according to this latter study and applies this to the\nresults from the NHANES-I the prevalence of Paget's\ndisease in the United States could be estimated to be 1.04%\nof the general population or approximately 2.5 million\npeople. A more liberal lower limit of pelvic frequency (i.e.,\npelvis involved in 40% of those with Paget's disease) would\nincrease the estimate of population prevalence to 1.98% of\nthe general population or approximately 5 million people.\nCooper estimated the prevalence in the United Kingdom to\nwas a very slight predominance of men in this popula-\nAs in all prior studies, we found an increasing prevalence\nof Paget's disease of bone in people in the older decades of\nlife. There are several potential interpretations of this data:\n(1) Paget's disease may not develop until an older age (this\ncould encompass both a genetic and an infectious etiology);\n(2) there may be a lag time in the development of disease, so\nit is only expressed in later life; (3) Paget's disease is\nprotective and those with Paget's disease live longer; and (4)\nthere may be a decreasing incidence of Paget's disease in the\ngeneral population. The latter is suggested by recent stud-\nThe regional distribution of Paget's disease found in this\nreview of the NHANES-I data reinforces the generally\naccepted clinical impression and results of regional hospital-\nbased studies that Paget's disease is most common in the\nnortheastern United States and uncommon in the southern\nUnited States.(19,20) The influence of race and ethnicity on\nthis regional distribution is unknown.\nMost studies have suggested a low prevalence of Paget's\ndisease in black people.(2,10) The finding of an equal\nprevalence in the NHANES-I data is unexplained. It is\npossible that prior studies were biased because of inadequate\nsampling of black people.\nLimitations of this study include the following: (1) 19.8%\nof the radiographs were not available for review and the\ninfluence on the data is unknown, (2) the true frequency of\npelvic regional involvement as a reflection of the presence of\nPaget's disease of bone is not known and a conservative\nestimate was used, (3) the cohort population was not fully\nexamined for Paget's disease because all bones of the\nskeleton were not examined radiographically or by radionu-\nclide bone scan, (4) the presence of pelvic Paget's disease is\nnot 100% detectable by radiographs, (5) extrapolation of the\nsmall numbers derived from NHANES-I to the entire\npopulation may not be accurate, and (6) there was no\nAuthor Ref. no.
