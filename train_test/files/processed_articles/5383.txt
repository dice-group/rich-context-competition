Africans go for beeping.\" The\narticle went on to reveal that on a daily basis, approximately\n130 million missed calls swarm the circuits of mobile phone\nservice providers in Africa.1 What is apparent is that a large\npercentage of these missed calls are intentional (Castells,\nFernandez-Ardevol, Linchuan Qiu, & Sey, 2006; Donner,\nalways imply a \"call me back\" action but is an exercise that\nhas been developed and perfected by users into an effective\nmeans of communication, with the added bonus of being\nabsolutely free of costs. These intentional missed calls are\nreferred to across Africa as buzzing, flashing, miskin, pitiful,\nmenacing, boom-call, fishing, bipage, beeping, missed call-\ning, and, although the term of reference to intentional missed\ncalling may differ from country to country, the action is the\nsame. In Uganda, the country under focus, the practice is\nreferred to as beeping, and this reference will be maintained\nfor the rest of this article.\nBeeping someone is an action that involves calling the\nother user's mobile phone and hanging up before they have\nan opportunity to pick up the call. The messages emitted\nthrough this action are usually prenegotiated between users\nprior to the action (Donner, 2007), such as \"I have arrived\nhome safely,\" or \"goodnight,\" or \"I'm thinking of you,\" \"I\nlove you,\" and even \"please call me back.\" The phone fea-\ntures such as the call log and phone book records enable the\nreceiver to discern who has \"called\" them. Beeping on the\npart of the service providers has created two (among others)\nglaring challenges that will be explored here. First, commu-\nnication through the mobile phone is supposed to earn the\nservice providers money whether it is a call or a text mes-\nsage. The general idea has been and continues to be that all\ncommunication through this technology is charged a fee. But\nhow and what constitutes as communication is a constant\npower play between the end user and the service provider\nbecause what producers offer does not always tie in with the\nconsumers' uses of a product2 (cf. Cockburn & Ormrod,\nPinch, 2003). The other challenge with beeping is that these\nmissed calls swarm the circuits, clogging up the communica-\ntion channels. Service providers across the continent have\nstepped up to respond to this challenge by creating \"call me\nback\" services that are circuited through different channels,\nand some of these have been limited to a specific number a\nday.3 Not every country though has managed to curb the\npractice, and an effort to discern why this practice persists\nhas instigated research interests that have produced varying\nreasons behind the practice.\nEven though Africa boasts the world's highest mobile tele-\nphony penetration figures in the world, some of the world's\npoorest are encountered in the same region (Coyle, 2005) and\n1Karlstad University, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nCarolineVictoria Wamala, Center for Gender Studies, Karlstad University,\nEmail: caroline.wamala@kau.se\nI Have to Give an \"I Can\" Attitude: Gender\nPatterns in Beeping Practices\nCarolineVictoria Wamala1\n Keywords\nmobile phone, ICT, beeping, gender, Uganda\n2 SAGE Open\nthe predominant reasoning behind beeping is that the eco-\nnomic situation for most Africans has pushed them to devise a\ncommunication practice through the technology that fits in\nthese debates, specifically highlighting gender performances\nthrough the practice of beeping. Instead of thinking of beeping\nas purely informed by economics, this article forges an under-\nstanding of how the identities constructed in relation to gender\nare aided by finances or lack of, and made visible, through\nbeeping practices. Thus, the economic argument put forth by\nsome of the previous work in beeping may not be the principal\nnegotiator of beeping practices, but rather gender.\nIn this article, beeping is contextualized as a relational prac-\ntice, a communicative exercise that is understood by individu-\nals who are engaged in some sort of relationship. The social\nrelationships alluded to here involve class negotiations, cul-\ntural negotiations, generational negotiations, intellectual nego-\ntiations, economic negotiations, as well as gender-based\nnegotiations; a cluster of categories that reveal beeping as a\npractice imbued with intersectional social orders. These are\nenacted on multiple levels simultaneously with an overall\nimpact on social exercises, existences, and expressions. I return\nto a theoretical outline for this article shortly but will at this\njuncture reemphasize that gender as a social category is the\nfocus for this article. Generational, kinship, or class forms of\nbeeping can be subjects for further research, not to mention the\nnotion of users being active agents in what a technology\nbecomes.\nTo understand who constitutes the 130 million daily\nmissed calls, this study analyses diverse gender-based nego-\ntiations that confront beeping practices. Mapping local, var-\nied expressions of masculinities and femininity at the\nintersection of beeping activities, the study offers some rec-\nommendations on how Information Communication\nTechnologies (ICT) in general can be useful signals of under-\nstanding sociological order.\nIn terms of organization, this article is structured as fol-\nlows. Immediately following this introduction are the objec-\ntives that informed this study. The reader is then introduced\nto the methods used before an outline of previous research\nrelated to beeping is provided. The cultural landscape within\nwhich beeping occurs receives mention within the theoreti-\ncal outline that is lodged within social constructivist\napproaches to gender and technology. Six empirical sections\nfollow the theoretical discussion, the first section details a\nquantitative side of the data that serve as a backdrop to the\nsubsequent qualitative analyses before rounding up the dis-\ncussion with some conclusions on who constitutes the daily\nObjective\nMy goal going into the field was to investigate to what level\nthe economic argument put forth by the literature on beeping\ninfluenced the practice. Having engaged in beeping exercises\nmyself, I knew there was more to the process than one's\nfinancial ability or lack thereof. I therefore sought to estab-\nlish, under what circumstances, how often, and to whom the\n130 million daily beeps were directed. Looking at my notes\nfrom the field, and the transcriptions from the recorded inter-\nviews, I noticed specific themes relating to expressions of\ngender, emerging in the data, many of which were aided by\nbut not altogether overridden by the respondent's socioeco-\nnomic status. The objective of this article based on these\nidentified themes, is to ascertain through the specific prac-\ntices of beeping, how gender relations have been affected by\nand have affected mobile phone use in Uganda. As more than\n70% of Uganda's population is below the age of 30,4 the\nstudy focus aimed at this segment of society can also estab-\nlish how modern technologies such as mobile phones have\ninfluenced or are being influenced by the gender structure\nin place.\nIn the field of ICT for development (ICT4D), there is the\nunderstanding that these technologies of which the mobile\nphone is a prominent member have ushered in an era of\nempowered development (Plant, 1998). Cyberfeminists view\nthe ICT era as \"providing the technological basis for a new\nform of society that is potentially liberating for women\"\ngrowing technology in ICT4D, studying the communication\npractices with the technology may help answer the question\nwhether ICTs are in fact liberating women in the developing\nregions. McGuigan (2005) asserts that \"[i]f you want to\nunderstand any kind of society you should look at how its\nmembers communicate with one another\" (p. 47; see also\nBray, 2007, p. 37). Symptomatic to these analyses are cyber-\na reembodiment of gender in the cyber realm as mentioned\nearlier. Wajcman's (2004) Techno feminism argues differ-\nently as she takes seriously the ways in which technologies\nare often framed to distance or subordinate women. Bending\ntoward this reasoning, this article approaches the beeping\npractice with critical interrogations toward how gender rela-\ntions are renegotiated, or even subverted through the use of\nthe mobile phone.\nIf 130 million beeps circulate the mobile communication\nchannels on a daily basis, to what extent can this figure be\ntranslated into empowered development? More specifically\nwho constitutes these beeps, how are the beeps informed,\nexecuted, and perceived? In the process of answering these\nquestions, this study draws on previous research that has\nidentified social, contextual rules to the practice that go\nbeyond cost-saving strategies (Donner, 2007). As such, if\nspecific rules pervade the practice, additional questions such\nas how these rules are conceptualized and maintained will\nhopefully be answered. On another register, because major-\nity of the accounts informing the gender and technology field\nare from Western experiences (see, Bray, 2007; Mellstr\u00f6m,\n2009), this article further contributes to the growing body of\nwork emanating from developing regions, especially the\nmeager contributions that come from the African continent.\nMethod\nLimiting the study to Uganda, located in East Africa, this\nresearch is a result of a year of ethnographic observations,\n23 conversational interviews, and a subsequent 53 qualita-\ntive interviews. The research group relating to beeping was\nfurther narrowed to young adults pursuing university educa-\ntion within close proximity to Uganda's capital city, Kampala\nbecause it is the young \"urban users\" who are \"generally\nsaid to be the early adapters of newer communication tech-\nthe practice of beeping is largely concentrated among uni-\nalthough the practice is known to also cut across generations\npopulation is below the age of 30 as mentioned earlier.\nI refer to the conversations from which some of the data\npresented henceforth were derived, as conversational inter-\nviews (see Dowson & McInerney, 2003) because all the\ninformants were made aware that the thoughts shared were\nbeing gathered as data for a scholarly article. These conver-\nsations took place at informal gatherings, in public transport,\nwith extended family members, with friends and acquain-\ntances with whom rapport had been established (Aull Davis,\nthese conversations, did not always provide an opportunity\nto digitally record the exchange because not only was the\nlocation inappropriate but the natural conversation flow\nwould have been disturbed if I had stopped to request for\npermission to record (for a discussion on this method, see\nFetterman, 1998). These conversations not only explained\nthe beeping behavior but also helped give cultural meaning\nto the practice (Fetterman, 1998). On the occasions when I\nhad the opportunity of discussing this research with the same\ninformants twice, I asked for permission to record the\nexchange. These discussions lasted anywhere between 30\nmin to 2 hr.\nBuilding on the observations and conversational inter-\nviews, I crafted a short questionnaire, which I personally\nadministered to willing participants. Administering the ques-\ntionnaire ensured clarity of the questions posed (Bryman &\nCramer, 2001); it also provided an opportunity to follow-up\non some responses with further questions (Nachmias &\nNachmias, 1996). Meeting these students was done either in\nthe libraries, outside their lecture halls, at the beginning or\nend of a lecture, or, as in one case, when I stationed myself\noutside a residence hall. The duration of the interviews with\nthe students ranged from 10 to 30 min. I took notes as the\nrespondent answered the questions, making sure to capture\nthe nuances raised from question to question. The option not\nto record these encounters allowed the students to talk freely\nat times even read through my notes and provide more infor-\nmation. Majority of the students alluded to owning Nokia\nphones and as additional material, I also read through 20\nNokia mobile phone manuals--found online--of the more\ninstructions on how to perform beeping.\nTo establish whether beeping was also prevalent among\nyoung working recent graduates, ages ranging from 23 to 28,\nseven willing respondents were also interviewed from an\nadvertising agency. These seven participants highlight an\ninteresting class dimension to the practice of beeping that is\nintersected with gender and social norms. A qualitative pre-\nsentation of data will be used although numerical mentions\nwill be made liberally throughout the text.\nEarlier Research\nCastells et al. (2006) present a global perspective on mobile\ncommunication in society and rely on the term \"mobile\nnetwork society\" to amplify social networks built on \"wire-\nless communication technology\" (Castells et al., 2006, p.\n6). Beeping receives mention as a last resort form of com-\nmunication for mobile subscribers that beep the friends and\nrelatives with the financial ability to return the call.\nEmphasis is also cast on the social rules to the practices,\nsuch as the social faux pas performed when a gentleman\nsuitor beeps his love interest, suggesting gender rules to the\nreview queries whether the desperate need to communicate\nby \"the urban poor,\" who use beeping, does actually make\nthem members of the information society. Mckemey et al.\n(2003) present a technical report that identifies patterns of\ntelephony use unique to the African region, such as beeping\nand the potentials of using these practices as advertising\ncampaigns to foster greater mobile phone use/integration.\nHorst and Miller (2006) in their anthropological study of\nthe cell phone in Jamaica, encounter the practice as a cost-\ntraces the practice across sub-Saharan Africa, and discovers\na social etiquette to the practice. These articles pay the most\nsocial attention to beeping, and Donner concludes in his\n2007 article that the practice is more than a \"cost-saving\npractice,\" and that it can be categorized into three major\nbeeps. He identifies a \"call me back beep,\" a \"prenegotiated\nbeep\" that involves prearranged messages such as \"when I\nbeep you I will have arrived at the agreed destination,\" and\n\"relational beeps,\" which he notes cut across friendships,\nand romantic relationships, which this current article\nfocuses on with an in-depth gender and technology analy-\nsis. Other sources that have informed this study include\nnews reports such as a BBC article by Borzello (2001),\ntitled \"Uganda's `beeping' nuisance.\" The article suggests\nan underlying financial impact to the practice, with the\nfinancially able users bearing the responsibility and cost of\n\"the call backs.\"\n4 SAGE Open\nMutual Shaping of Gender andTechnology\nBeeping in this article will benefit from the social construc-\ntivist framework in gender and technology studies that sees\n\"technology as both a source and a consequence of gender\nues to inform feminist approaches to the field of Science,\nTechnology Studies (STS), where it is suggested that science\nand technology do not \"evolve in a vacuum rather they par-\nticipate in the social world, being shaped by it and shaping\nseek to problematize the complex relationship women\nappear to have with technology as well as the obvious\ndominance of men in the field (Lagesen, 2008; Wajcman,\nrelations can be thought of as materialized in technology,\nand masculinity and femininity in turn acquire their meaning\nand character through their enrolment and embeddedness in\nyouth in Uganda, one can see this mutual shaping emerging\nin beeping practices. This co-construction of gender and\ntechnology erupts in beeping as the youth engage with the\nmobile phone in specific and structured ways.\nPerformances of masculinity and femininity (cf. Butler,\n1990, who looks upon gender as a performance) \"are prac-\ntices through which men and women engage in gender and\neffects of these practices [consequentially impact] practices\non bodily experience, personality and culture\" (Connell,\nhence the emphasis on pluralized masculinities and expres-\nsions of femininity, and are learned and expressed individu-\nally, communally, or even culturally. Analyzing the\ndominance or subordinances within and among masculini-\nties in particular, Connell (1987) notes a hegemonic form of\nmasculinity that negotiates power relations in lieu of women\nand other men. The role of provider over a woman is one of\nthe \"prevailing hegemonic masculine ideal\" 5 (Kiyimba,\np. 809) and is a characteristic particularly developed through\noral literature, language, music, dance, and folklore among\nUganda's youth. Not only do these media create \"near indel-\nible impressions in matters of social organisation, political\npower relations, resource management and sharing, and gen-\nder relations, these impressions in turn lay down rules of the\nfuture social behaviour and contact of the young people\"\nvisible in the games that young boys and girls engage in, the\nsame are held in check by peers, relatives, the community\n\"and recently through electronic mass media\" (Nannyonga-\nare constructed by and restricted by the local gender system\nand are groomed in opposition of each other, which helps\nestablish relations of codependency (cf. Nannyonga-\noften, why, and whom they beep, all the informants in this\nstudy alluded to being engaged in heterosexual relationships.\nAs such beeping as a practice fortifies these cultural con-\nstructs but the same practice also makes visible the iterative\nquality of these expressions as well as their fragility.\nForms of Beeping: Results\nThe implicit economic argument put forth by (Borzello,\nthe practice of beeping. The empirical data provided hence-\nforth are indicative of sociocultural practices among the\nyoung people, perhaps as a minion of economic inabilities.\nThat said, it was also evident that even financially able\nfemale respondents (e.g., the working advertising firm\nfemale respondents), still beep their boyfriends, with a non-\nchalance that suggests an expectant \"call me back\" situation\nin most cases. Far from being a representative sample of the\nyouth in Uganda, the subsequent numerical depictions are\nuseful for the ensuing qualitative analyses as they provide\ngeneral trends among the informants that provide the\nemphasis needed in detailing the qualitative data that follow\nthis section.\nFrom the 53 participants that informed this study, 46 of\nthem are university students. Of the 46 students, 26 are\nfemale students and 20 are male students. The questions\nlisted on the questionnaire first established if the respondent\nowned a mobile phone, after which demographic questions\nsuch as age, year of study, and name were also sought.\nThereafter, the respondents' phone billing plan was queried.\nThis question was essentially posed to establish if economic\nfactors motivated the practice of beeping. All 53 respondents\n(including the working respondents) are on the prepaid\nphone billing plan, the choice plan made for the economi-\ncally challenged who would want to monitor their expendi-\nture (Skuse & Cousins, 2008; Waverman, Meschi, & Fuss,\n2005). Further along the interview, the participants were\nasked to choose from a list of features available on their\nmobile phones, three of their favorite and most frequently\nused. Beeping is not a feature on any mobile phone, and\nscrutiny of the manuals sold with each mobile phone do not\nlist this practice as a feature or supply instructions on how to\ngo about the exercise.6 Nonetheless, beeping was included\n(deliberately to establish if it was considered important)\namong the list of features to choose from, and with the\nexception of 1 female university student, who questioned\nwhether beeping was a mobile phone feature, the rest of the\ninformants either scorned at the feature, or jovially pointed at\nit as one of their favorite mobile phone features.\nMore specifically, 11 of the 26 female university stu-\ndents selected beeping as one of their favorite features and\n8 men out of 20 male university students selected it. That\nthis nonfeature is one of the most favored offered by the\nmobile phone by 19 of the university student respondents is\nindicative of just how prevalent the practice is among this\ngroup of users. The respondents were also asked how often\nand with whom they engaged in the practice of beeping.\nAbout 50% (13) of the female university students beep on a\ndaily basis, and 35% (7) male university students beep on a\ndaily basis. From the same group of university respondents,\nit was also established that 21 (81%) of the female respon-\ndents beep their boyfriends, while 8 (40%) of the male\nrespondents alluded to beeping their girlfriends. With the 7\nrecently graduated respondents, all employed, the follow-\ning responses were recorded. Of 4 female respondents, 3\nchose beeping as one of their favorite mobile phone fea-\ntures, and 1 out of 3 male respondents selected beeping as\na phone feature they favored. Two of the girls from the\nadvertising agency claimed to beep on a regular basis, and\nwere quick to point out that the beeping was to specific\npeople such as to their boyfriend, or family or parents,\nnever their peers, because \"now that I am working I don't\nthink it is good. When I was in college, it was very under-\nstandable. I only beep [my friends] if there is a prearranged\nmessage\" (Daniella, 24, PR executive). None of the young\nworking males beeped their girlfriends or buddies. But they\ndid admit to beeping parents or older family members\nwhom they knew would be able to call them back.\nComments made especially by male respondents when\nasked if they beeped their girlfriends were noted. The\nstrong reactions toward beeping their partners were mostly\nexperienced from the male participants, while majority of\nfemale respondents almost seemed to consider the same\npractice as normal. To analyze these attitudes and further\ndeconstruct the data provided here, the subcategories\nenlisted below relate to a relational beeping analysis further\ncontextualized within the construction of gender in Uganda\nand among these participants.\nBeeping Performances\nTo untangle the structures that order beeping performances\nas shown in the previous section, the empirical presentation\nin this section is enveloped in discussions on masculinity,\nand how this enterprise is produced through beeping prac-\ntices. Seen as a process, masculinity is a relational concern\nwithin gender relations or as Connell (2005) puts it \"`[m]\nasculinity' does not exist except in contrast with `feminin-\ninto focus further makes visible other constructions of gen-\nder categories (Carrigan, Connell, & Lee, 1985; Donaldson,\n1993) that call various models of masculinity into play\nwithin beeping. The production of masculinity in beeping is\nassisted by class dynamics driven by economic resources as\nalluded to earlier. As the economic processes vary for infor-\nmants in this study, the forms of masculinity are plural in\ntheir production. The strong affiliation between economic\nresources and expressions of masculinity provides another\nexplanation for beeping. As a matter of course, Connell's\n(1987) concept of hegemonic masculinity is taken as a point\nof departure and is maintained as a central focus in the pro-\ncess of analyzing the order in beeping practices. Hegemonic\nmasculinity to recapitulate is when \"particular groups of\nmen\" validate, maintain, and defend their positions of power\nover women and other men (Carrigan et al., 1985; Connell,\ncalled into play through one's ability not to beep but also the\nability to respond to a beep.\nDuring one of my conversational interviews, I was made\nto realize how the relationship between masculinity and eco-\nnomic resources is the source of specific beeping practices:\nWhile I was at campus this was the case; a guy who is\ninterested in a girl, will want to show her that he is\ncapable of taking care of her. And guys like to show\noff, so the guy will start buying the girl airtime and he\ntells her that she should beep him, and he will call her\nback, and when her airtime runs out she must tell him,\nhe will load more on her phone. So the girl gets used\nto this airtime. (Salome, November 2008)\nThe specific gender relations constructed in the interac-\ntion described in this excerpt can be better understood when\nthe historicity of the gender order (cf. Donaldson, 1993) in\nUganda is considered. If parallels are drawn between the\nbreadwinning practice and the guy's ability to buy airtime,\nand respond to a girl's beep, hegemonic masculinity is con-\nditioned upon and modeled, toward the guy not beeping,\nsimultaneously encouraging his girlfriend to beep him. It is\nimperative for the guy in question to provide the call credit,\nwhich according to this excerpt must never be used to call\nthe credit provider. This pattern of masculinity, may not nec-\nessarily be oppressive to the girl in question, in fact \"some\nexpressions of the hegemonic pattern [may be] more familiar\nare actively engaged in its production. I discussed some of\nthe patterns emerging in my data with Salome, whose\ninsights were very useful in fleshing out the various reasons\nmany young men in my data consciously chose not to beep.\nResponsible Beeping\nI came across 20-year-old Richard early October 2008, on his\nway to the library, and he mentioned that even though he did\nnot have a girlfriend at present, he would never beep her\nbecause \"I have to show an `I can' attitude,\" and he followed\nthis comment with \"you know how it is for us guys.\" Richard\nspoke with hand gestures as he tried to get his opinion across.\nThe historicity of the gender order referred to earlier is par-\nticularly evident in Richard's reference to \"you know how it\nis for us guys.\" How society grooms and regulates gender\nrelations can be reflected on how Richard interprets and\nadheres to these regimes. I also realize that I cannot be\nabsolved of Richard's perception of me and the impact this\n6 SAGE Open\nmight have had on the interview. The \"I can\" attitude alluded\nto may have also been directed at me as a woman. Shortly\nafter meeting with Richard, I chanced upon 21-year-old\nMichael outside his residence hall. When asked who he prac-\nticed beeping with, his disapproval toward beeping his girl-\nfriend was visible in his facial expression before he stated, \"I\nwould rather send her a SMS, beeping is too `high school.'\nIt's for immature boys.\" Michael, however, talked about\nbeeping his parents claiming, \"Oh yes, there is always money\nthere.\" This was a clear theme among the informants.\nNamely, that the same young men do engage in the practice\nwith their family displaying that construction of a good son,\nin relation to the familial hierarchies of parents caring for and\nprotecting their children is unlikely to berate a beep from the\nson. Whereas the construction of a good boyfriend, within\nthis category of respondents may be contingent on being\nresponsive to a girlfriend's beep. Michael's reference to\n\"there is always money there,\" with regard to his parents\nsteers the discussion back to the economic resources that are\ncentral to Michael's beeping practices and depending on the\nsocial arrangements the same can both motivate and under-\nmine who Michael beeps or does not beep.\nOn another occasion, stationed a few meters away from a\nroadside phone kiosk on one of the University campuses, I\nhappened upon 21-year-old Steven. Steven was very chatty,\nand when asked who he beeps, his friends and his girlfriend\nwere not in this category. As a way of explanation to not\nbeeping his girlfriend, Steven supplied, \"beeping doesn't\nshow responsibility, I must show my girlfriend that I am\nresponsible!\" Steven gave some fascinating alternatives as\nopposed to beeping his girlfriend. We were standing a few\nmeters from a roadside phone kiosk as mentioned already,\nand he stressed that rather than beep his girlfriend he would\ncall her from the public phone, which he gestured toward.\nCall charges to mobile phones from one of these public\nphone booths are cheaper than direct mobile-to-mobile calls.\nThis practice has social connotations to the effect, that one\nwho calls another mobile phone from one of these phone\nbooths communicates their financial inability to communi-\ncate directly from a mobile phone particularly if the call\nrecipient is aware that the caller is in possession of a mobile\nphone. When Steven stressed that he would rather call from\nthese phone booths he demonstrated his abhorrence toward\nbeeping his girlfriend and also created hierarchies in com-\nmunication practices that are worth pursuing in further\nresearch.\nRonald, a 22-year-old, had just come out of a lecture on a\nTuesday afternoon when he agreed to an interview. We sat in\nthe empty lecture hall and soft-spoken Ronald quietly\nresponded to my questions with a conviction I had not seen\nwith some of the other male informants. Ronald disapproved\nof beeping in general but with specific reference to his girl-\nfriend he said, \"I have to show that I care about her.\" I asked\nas a follow-up if beeping the girlfriend was an indication that\nhe did not care for her, he simply nodded.\nBeeping Behaviors\nThe context and the environments in which I met these\ninformants further contributed to the material at least with\nregard to the expressions of masculinity. For example, John,\nan advertising agent, sat in an open office with several other\ncolleagues and this interview could be heard by all who were\npresent. When we reached the section in my question sheet\nthat asked about his beeping practices, 25-year-old John\nexclaimed \"I never beep my girlfriend, she is different.\" I\nasked him what was different about his girlfriend and he\nexplained while looking around at his female colleagues\n\"you know how girls are they expect you to call them.\" And\nto his credit, the female colleagues gestured and mentioned\nthat it was important that a boyfriend calls his girlfriend as\nopposed to beeping. Seated a couple of desks away from\nJohn was 27-year-old Ivan. Ivan was a jolly boisterous inter-\nviewee who may have also wanted to show off for his col-\nleagues in the same open office space as John. As he\nresponded to the questions, he encouraged the participation\nof his colleagues by challenging them with questions or\ncomments. Although Ivan did not mind his girlfriend beep-\ning him, he took issue with friends or colleagues beeping\nhim and when he mentioned this, one of his female col-\nleagues calmly mentioned that sometimes a call is unneces-\nsary when all you want to say is \"hi, I am thinking of you.\"\nTo this Ivan responded \"you might as well call me and blurt\nout the `hi' and then hang up, beeping is so unloving.\"\nThe environments were themselves highly gendered and\nproduce varied enactments of masculinities. Alternatively,\nthe context had an influence on or helped convey masculin-\nity. Ronald John and Ivan put forward the same argument but\nexpressed it differently. While John and Ivan fed off of their\ncolleagues, Ronald's quiet conviction if paralleled exempli-\nfied different expressions of masculinity, that are still \"cen-\ntrally connected with the institutions of male dominance\"\nare a critical aspect in the production of hegemonic mascu-\nlinity as long as they are the ones doing the beeping. For\nexample, the female respondents (students and employed),\nwho alluded to beeping their boyfriends, did not follow their\nresponse to this question with strong comments as noted\nabove. A case in point is 24-year-old advertising executive,\nDaniella, who mentioned that she does not beep as much\nnow that she is working, unless she is communicating a pre-\narranged message. Daniella and her female colleagues sug-\ngest here that as working women, they have to adhere to\nspecific codes of behavior such as only beeping when they\nhave to. The same informants claimed to beep their boy-\nfriends, however, with Daniella providing that \"he expects\nme to beep him\" (January 2009). Even though these ladies\nmay be in a position to afford to call their boyfriends, they do\nnot do so. As such when Wajcman (2010) talks about tech-\nnology being a source and a consequence of gender relations,\nthe performance of masculinity, emerging in this category of\ninformants emphasizes the hegemony of these men in rela-\ntion to women (Connell, 1987). Richard's comment about\nhaving an \"I can\" attitude, or Michael's comment about\nbeeping being an \"immature\" trait for men, along with\n\"beeping is so unloving,\" or \"I have to show that I care about\nher,\" are comments that demonstrate that if, as a man, you\nlove or care about your girl you cannot devalue what she\nmeans to you by beeping her (Chango, 2005) or risk the\nembarrassment of being labeled as \"cheap\" (Donner, 2007,\nEmphasis is made with words such as devalue and cheap,\nto highlight the socioeconomic implications of beeping at the\nsame time as I problematize the exclusive focus on economic\nresources in previous research by making visible the gender\nstructure that informs beeping. Put differently, the economic\nargument that feeds its way into specific sociotechnical prac-\ntices is part of \"large-scale social structures\" (Carrigan et al.,\nthis article argues that beyond the economic argument, the\nproduction of masculinity can be undermined or strength-\nened within specific conventions of gender practices. Each\nof the young men in this section have to show that they\n\"care\" about their girlfriends, and their inability to maintain\nthe relationship could be seen as a loss of their masculine\ninterview,\nI had a chat with this guy who was complaining that\nhis previous girlfriend who was from the [south] of\nUganda was fond of beeping him. He said, \"I used to\nbuy her the airtime and she would beep me only, never\ncalled, so I started wondering--if I am buying her the\nairtime, who is she calling with my money? After a\nwhile we broke up and I am now seeing this lady from\nthe [east] of Uganda, this lady is different, she will\neven go to the phone kiosks when she has no airtime,\nI don't understand, I have told her to beep me, but she\nalways calls, is she more desperate than girls coming\nfrom the [south] or what?\" (Mary, October 2008)\nSeveral issues are raised in this excerpt, and as mentioned\nearlier, the various attributes that negotiate beeping such as\nethnicity as inferred in this quote are topics for future\nresearch. But the idea promoted here illustrates the construc-\ntion and expression of masculinity, around notions of power.\nThis man, encourages his girlfriends to beep him and the girl\nwho fails to adhere to his ability of assuming the role of pro-\nvider, has him pondering whether or not she is desperate, a\ntrait he clearly finds disconcerting toward the performance\nof masculinity. There is a lot of showing off, of being finan-\ncially able, and for hegemonic masculinity to emerge suc-\ncessfully; women like Daniella have to be compliant in\n\"accommodating the interests and desires of men,\" a process\nthat Connell (1987) labels as \"emphasised femininity\" (p.\n183) meaning that the women are active participants in the\nprocess and production of hegemonic masculinity.\nExpressing Resistance\ngest that employees as well as students in this particular case\ncan beep their employers or lecturers, my data does not\nagree with this assessment. The students and the advertising\nagents provided very emphatic nos to this question. Both\nmale and female student respondents did not beep their lec-\nturers and the employed respondents did not beep their\nemployers, suggesting that social hierarchies can renegotiate\nthe gendering of technology and why a situated context-\nspecific analysis of sociotechnical practices is important.\nThinking back to Michael's comment when asked if he\nbeeps his parents, where he reveals \"oh yes, there is always\nmoney there,\" as opposed to him not beeping his lecturers or\ngirlfriend, one can conclude that masculinity is expressed,\nboth in situations of beeping and nonbeeping. Hence, within\nthe family discourse, constructions of masculinity are still\nprevalent where the construction of \"son\" builds upon cer-\ntain traits of masculinity at the same time as it dismisses oth-\ners. Similarly the construction of \"boyfriend\" rests upon and\nis reinforced by certain traits of masculinity--caring for your\nwoman--just as femininity when confronted by particular\nrankings in society, may not be an acceptable excuse for\nengaging with technology in specific ways.\nOther tensions were registered with some of the subverted\nbeeping performances as in the example of eight university\nmale students who alluded to beeping their girlfriends, while\nfive female university students did not beep their boyfriends.\nThese young women considered the whole practice unfair to\nthe recipient of the beep. Rebecca in particular was very\nvocal on her feelings toward the practice saying \"it's a moral\nissue I don't consider it proper, like I am detoothing him.\"\nDetoothing is a form of dependency literally meaning to ren-\nder someone toothless by deliberately enjoying financial\nfavors from them with no intention of returning the good-\nwill. Hence young ladies who succeed in having men lavish\nmoney on them without a capitulation on their part are said\nto detooth guys. I contend the same can happen the other\nway around or even within same gender relations. For\nRebecca, 22, a 3rd-year university student, she considers this\nreliance on a boyfriend to call her back as immoral and a\npractice only for the \"cheap\" girls.\nTo suggest that the forms of masculinities expressed\namong the category of men who beep as well as those who\nappear to have no qualms with receiving calls as opposed to\nbeeps from girlfriends like Rebecca are subordinated forms\nin relation to hegemonic masculinity would be a rather sim-\nple conclusion. Rather the power structures that demotivate\ncertain groups of men from beeping, and encourage others to\nbeep, may be different but it also shows that the differences\n8 SAGE Open\nare not just about power--or power may assume a different\ncharacter. Put differently, some of these masculinities resist\nthe established assumptions at the same time as they stabilize\nthe associated notions of power. The breadwinning position,\nshaped by social norms also shapes masculinity, and some of\nthese norms are made visible through the young men who\nexpress the provider role by responding to a beep. The empiri-\ncal material does not delve into how these groups of men\nnegotiate alternative forms of masculinities, but it shows that\nnot all men engage with technology in relation to conventional\ngender expressions, and certainly not women like Rebecca\neither for whom beeping the boyfriend may subjugate her\nboyfriend's masculinity rather than qualify it. I return to my\nconversation with Salome to help flesh out this section,\nThose guys who end up saying \"my girlfriend is\ndethoothing me,\" have brought that upon themselves,\nyou can't start buying airtime and change your mind\nalong the way, she is not dethoothing, she is doing as\nyou have showed her. (Salome, November 2008)\nIt would in fact appear that some men find the require-\nment to respond to a girlfriend's beep, disempowering espe-\ncially if they refer to the process as one that detooths them.\nEven if it is the men who encourage the beeping according to\nMary and Salome, the power structures that inform the exer-\ncise become subverted as women assume greater control and\npower over the process. The fragility and process-oriented\nquality in expressing masculinity, especially hegemonic\nmasculinity, is evident in the men who fail to control their\ngirlfriends beeping and as in the case of Mary's discussion\nalso the girlfriends calling patterns. The economic incentives\nthat appear to create the hegemonic pattern in beeping are\nnot ahistorical. Their construction would benefit from a\ndeeper examination of what practices sustain them (cf.\nnoteworthy that the five girls in this category do not engage\nin any form of beeping, and passionately dislike the practice.\nWhile on the flip side, the eight men who beep their girl-\nfriends--an interesting contrast to the women they are being\ncompared with in this category--noted how it was perfectly\nalright for their girlfriends to beep them, but they would also\ndo (did) the same.\nPeer Beeping Practices\nWithin the male homosocial/male\u00admale circles, an unspoken\ntension was communicated on beeping one's male friends.\nThe notion of responsibility discussed by the male respon-\ndents according to their reference of girlfriends was in this\ninstance put forward as a boyish trait that is not popular even\namong their male friendships. As Donaldson has it, \"[t]\nhrough hegemonic masculinity most men benefit from the\ncontrol of women. For a very few men, it delivers control of\npeers, as mentioned earlier, the gendered power relations\namong men (Connell, 2009) are amplified in relation to other\nmen and manifest among the informants in this study in how\nthey communicate through the mobile phone with each other.\nThe male respondents were emphatic when they mentioned\nthat beeping their friends almost always involved communi-\ncating a prenegotiated message, such as \"I have arrived at the\n`agreed meeting place.'\" The girls on the other hand did not\ncommunicate the same friction regarding beeping each other.\nBeeping fellow girlfriends, just to communicate a \"hello\"\nmessage was a common practice mentioned by the female\nrespondents. Some female respondents narrated the number\nof beeps required to communicate particular messages and\nthat it was commonplace to beep friends on a regular basis.\nAmong the male respondents, 78% (18) in total men-\ntioned beeping their friends, most of them following this\nwith a comment to the effect that a beep had to be agreed\nupon prior to its emission. Among the female respondents,\n83% (25) indulge in the practice liberally with fellow girl-\nfriends, without the same tension as communicated by the\nguys. One female respondent noted that some of her friends\ndid not appreciate being beeped so she did not beep them,\nbut those that did not mind she beeped them every once in a\nwhile to say \"hi.\" This demonstrates that the practice is not\nused within all female-to-female relationships, but it is more\nprevalent among this group than the male-to-male friend-\nships. This shows that even among their male-to-male social\nbonds, there is the unspoken responsibility of elaborating\nmasculinity. Because as Steven phrased it, \"beeping doesn't\nshow responsibility\"; a trait that men are taught very early on\nin their childhood. The girls on the other hand, are taught to\nemphasize their dependence, (Kiyimba, 2005; Nannyonga-\nTamusuza, 2005) and for them displaying these traits even\namong each other, may not always result in their femininity\nbeing compromised, to the level that masculinity is among\nConclusion\nIt is highly likely that beeping as a form of communication\nwill wane as other features are introduced on the mobile\nphone. The smartphone revolution has afforded many stu-\ndents and Uganda's youth in general with cheaper affordable\ncommunication features powered by Wi-Fi or mobile\nInternet bundles. With Wi-Fi services spread liberally at\nmany universities in Uganda, communication through these\nvarious applications can take place with little or no cost to\nthe student. But even though the mobile phone may continue\nto provide affordable means of communication, this article\nhas illustrated how to some extent expressions of gender are\nchanging with the advent of ICT, but to a greater degree, the\ngender order at play is reinforced as made visible through\nmobile phone communication practices.\nBeeping is ubiquitous within the Ugandan society\n(Borzello, 2001). The concept has been analyzed by\nresearchers with the conclusion that it is not only a nuisance\nbut is a practice deeply embedded in the socioeconomic sta-\ntus of Ugandans and Africans in general (Borzello, 2001).\nThe current article develops this analysis by emphasizing an\naspect of beeping that has received passing attention in the\npublished works that of beeping being primarily informed by\nor negotiated by gender. This article has not dismissed the\neconomic aspect put forth by previous research, but has\nsought to build on this enterprise by illustrating the con-\nscious efforts applied by mobile phone users, to convey their\ngender identities when they communicate through the mobile\nphone. For example, the pressure, perhaps even pleasure,\nand power that young men face when they receive a beep\nfrom a love interest requires a cultural performance of the\nlocal understanding of what it means to be a responsible\nman. One also has to understand that the girls' practice of\nbeeping does not preclude them as passive in the practice\nbecause their interactions with the mobile phone precipitates\nthe enactment of hegemonic masculinity as made clear by\nDaniella's confession. Some of these ideas substantiate the\nhegemony of some groups of men that can be paralleled to\nthe culturally idealized form of breadwinning, an enterprise\nthat is actively sought by most men. Under the umbrella of\nsocioeconomic processes, juggling the various positions of\nson, boyfriend, student, or employee, for the young men in\nthis study requires various expressions of masculinity in\nbeeping as regulated by the social arrangements. Not only\ndoes a mundane (in)significant practice such as beeping con-\ntribute to establishing these gendered norms, the practice\nthrough this technology also enables a glimpse of how gen-\nder is structured (Bray, 2007) in Ugandan society.\nCyberfeminists have alluded to a Cyberutopia that has the\npotential to redress inequalities in societies (Kirkup et al.,\nlion beeps is to consider the rapid uptake of the mobile phone\nby a region that has for the most part struggled to catch up\nwith the rest of world with regard to ICT uptake (Polikanov\n& Abramova, 2003). But looking at the technology, and the\nsocial and cognitive structures in place, the way technology\nis used depends on the subject, and making the kind of jump\nalluded to by the cyberfeminists of a more equal society\nthrough technology (especially if a hype is created around\nthe 130 million daily beeps), may in fact obscure more than\nilluminate interactions with ICT. Rather,\nboth technology and gender are products of a moving\nrelational process, emerging from collective and indi-\nvidual acts of interpretation. It follows from this that\ngendered conceptions of users are fluid, and that the\nsame artefact is subject to a variety of interpretations\nBray (2007) suggests that \"[t]echnical skills and domains\nof expertise shape [and are shaped by local] masculinities\nand femininities\" (p. 37).\nAs a social symbol of negotiating beeping practices, gen-\nder illustrates among this category of informants that the\nhegemonic masculine ideal of provider, prevails among\nmajority of the young men who ascribe to this role by con-\nsciously choosing not to beep. In the same vein, majority of\nthe young women practice beeping in line with local cultural\nemphasized femininity. These social signals are useful in\n\"charting the coproduction of global and local culture\"\nbalization. Masculinity and femininity expressions are tenu-\nous within gender relations. They are confronted by or\nintersect with other social attributes such as class, kinship,\ncultural norms, age to name a few, which create a situated\nexpression of the same, and beeping as a practice is particu-\nlarly indicative of this. The socioeconomic aspect of beeping\nwhen shown to interact with the gender reveals a practice\nthat extends beyond the economics of beeping. In principle,\nthe social relationship to the beep recipient negotiates this\npractice to a greater extent than the economic resources.\nAfrica's 130 million daily beeps are thus doing much more\nthan merely informing recipients of a missed call. They are\nreinforcing and sometimes negotiating relationships and\nhierarchies across the continent.\n"
