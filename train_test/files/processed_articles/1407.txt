There were very small differences among subgroups.

HbA1c\nis currently considered\nthe best index of metabolic control for di-\nabetic patients in clinical settings (1,2)\nand participants in epidemiological stud-\nies as well as a measure of risk for the\ndevelopment of micro- and macrovascu-\nlar complications (3,4). HbA1c\nconcentra-\ntion is also related to prevalent coronary\ndisease or carotid intimal thickening in\nnondiabetic individuals (5,6). It has been\nsuggested as a diagnostic and screening\ntool for diabetes in the general population\n(7\u00ad9). The use of this test and the distri-\nbution of HbA1c\nlevels are also being used\nincreasingly by quality assurance pro-\ngrams to assess the quality of diabetes care\nAlthough the normative distribution\nlevels has been described and\nstandardized for adults (11), normal\nranges for children have not been estab-\nlished. Diabetes in children and adoles-\ncents is on the rise, perhaps due to the\nincrease in type 2 diabetes (12) and pos-\nsibly type 1 diabetes (13). With the in-\ncrease in diabetes in children and the\naccompanying increased use of HbA1c\nconcentration as a glycemic indicator, it is\nimportant to develop reference levels and\nstandards for HbA1c\nfor this population.\nHere, we describe the distribution of\nlevels in a nationally representative\nsample of U.S. children, adolescents, and\nyoung adults aged 5\u00ad24 years. We also\nevaluate the effects of age, sex, ethnicity,\nsocioeconomic status (SES), parental his-\ntory of diabetes, overweight, and blood\nglucose on the distribution of HbA1c\n.\nMETHODS -- The Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\nto 1994 by the National Center for Health\nStatistics of the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention (CDC) to assess the\nhealth and nutritional status of the U.S.\npopulation (14). The NHANES III in-\ncluded a nationally representative proba-\nbility sample of the U.S. civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population, identi-\nfied through a complex multistage cluster\nsampling design, with oversampling of\nyoung people, non-Hispanic blacks, and\nMexican-Americans. During a household\ninterview, participants or a proxy respon-\ndent for children provided information\non participants' sociodemographics,\nhealth status, and family medical history.\nPhysicians and health care technicians\nconducted a standard examination on\nsampled subjects in a mobile examination\ncenter within 4 weeks of the household\ninterview.\n                                                \nFrom the 1Division of Diabetes Translation, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health\nPromotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia; and the 2National Center for\nHealth Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Jinan B.

We used education as a\nproxy for SES because unlike income\ndata, education data in NHANES III were\nrelatively complete. We also used the\npoverty income ratio so that we could an-\nalyze across the 6 years of the survey in a\ncomparable manner (14).\nFor this analysis, we defined race/\nethnicity as non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Mexican-American, and\nother race (including other Hispanics,\nAsians, and Native Americans). For the\ntotal U.S. estimates, all racial/ethnic\ngroups were combined. BMI was calcu-\nlated as weight in kilograms divided by\nheight in meters squared. BMI percentiles\nwere calculated on the basis of the CDC\ngrowth charts (15). We defined over-\nweight as the age- and sex-specific BMI\nexceeding the 95th percentile.\nwas measured on whole blood\nfrom participants 4 years of age with an\nion-exchange high-performance liquid\nchromatography (HPLC) method (Bio-\nRad Diamat HPLC; interassay coefficient\nof variation 2.0). Because the presence of\nvariant hemoglobins (hemoglobins C, D,\nF, and S) interfere with the HPLC\nmethod, NHANES III analysts used the\nstandardized affinity chromatographic\nmethod when these hemoglobins were\npresent. Both methods were standardized\nto the Diabetes Control and Complica-\ntions Trial reference method. Serum glu-\ncose levels of participants 12 years of\nage were measured as part of a standard\nbattery of biochemical assessments (Hita-\nchi Model 737 multichannel analyzer;\nBoehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN)\ndents aged 5\u00ad24 years who were inter-\ndid not have their HbA1c\nlevels measured.\nThere were no major differences in HbA1c\ncompletion rate by sex, overweight, or ed-\nucation level. The completion rate varied\nwith age (78% in the age group 5\u00ad9 years\nMexican-Americans, 89% among non-\nHispanic whites, and 86% among non-\nHispanic blacks; P  0.01). Pregnant\nwomen (n  185) and respondents who\nreported current treatment for diabetes\n(n  20) were excluded from analysis.\nStatistical analysis\nWe performed analyses for this study us-\ning SAS for data management and\nSUDAAN to account for unequal proba-\nbilities of selection, planned oversam-\npling, differential nonresponse, and the\npairwise comparisons to test for the sig-\nnificant mean differences in HbA1c\nlevels\namong different groups. We used multi-\nple linear regression models to describe\nthe relationship of HbA1c\nlevels with the\nfollowing independent variables: age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity, education level, and over-\nweight. Separate regression models were\nrun for each age group due to the consis-\ntent significant age and sex interaction.\nAdditional models that controlled for fast-\ning glucose levels included the 2,809 chil-\ndren and young adults 12 years of age\nwho had fasting glucose levels measured\nafter fasting for 8 h.\nadolescents, and young adults aged 5\u00ad24\nyears who were not treated for diabetes\nhad their HbA1c\nlevels measured.

More than 40% of non-Hispanic\nblacks and Mexican-Americans lived be-\nlow the poverty level compared with only\n15% of non-Hispanic whites. The preva-\nlence of overweight was higher among\nnon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-\nAmericans (15% for both) than among\nnon-Hispanic whites (10%).\nThe distribution of HbA1c\nlevels by\nrace/ethnicity is shown in Fig. 1.

We\nalso found consistent differences in\nlevels among the different racial/\nethnic groups studied, with non-Hispanic\nblacks having the highest levels, followed\nby Mexican-Americans and whites, and\nthese differences were not accounted for\nby other demographic or clinical factors.\nSuch differences in HbA1c\nlevels, which\nare modest and mostly within a normal\nrange, can be interpreted in several ways.\nOn one hand, such differences may reflect\nphysiological differences in HbA1c\nmetabo-\nlism that could be related to genetic or other\nfactors. HbA1c\nis actually influenced by\nboth the life span of the erythrocyte and its\nother hand, differences in HbA1c\nmay also\nreflecthigheraverageglycemiaoverthepre-\nceding 2\u00ad3 months (which may also be\nphysiological and within normal limits), or\nthe differences may reflect some level of rel-\native insulin resistance. Indeed, an elevated\nlevel has been associated with excess\nmortality risk in the general population\nIn this healthy U.S. population, non-\nHispanic black youths consistently had\nhigher HbA1c\nlevels than non-Hispanic\nwhite youths, even after data were ad-\njusted for age, sex, education, overweight,\nand fasting glucose level. Considering the\ndisproportionate rise in type 2 diabetes in\nminority children (23\u00ad27), these differ-\nences in HbA1c\nare noteworthy. We also\ndescribed significant differences in HbA1c\nlevels associated with age, sex, weight,\nand education. These differences were\nsignificant in some specific subgroups\nonly. The effects of age on HbA1c\nlevels in\nadults are controversial, as some studies\nshow age-related increases in HbA1c\nlev-\nels and others show little or no increase\n(28, 29). Differences in results among the\nstudies are likely related to differences in\nthe selection of study subjects. In most\nethnic and sex groups, we found mean\nlevels highest in the group aged\n10\u00ad14 years. This may reflect the demon-\nstrated transient increase in insulin resis-\ntance experienced at the onset of puberty\nand the return to near prepubertal insulin\nsensitivity level by the end of puberty\n(30). In NHANES III, low level of educa-\ntion was associated with high HbA1c\nlev-\nels in the overall population; however,\nwhen we fitted separated models by age-\ngroup, the association persisted only\nabsence of significant relationship in the\nyounger age groups may be because the\nlevel of education was that of the head of\nthe household, most likely a parent,\nwhereas in the oldest group, the educa-\ntion level was that of the youth.\nOur study has several strengths and\nlimitations. The NHANES III is a nation-\nally representative sample that over-\nsampled black and Mexican-American\nchildren, the two largest racial/ethnic mi-\nnority groups in the U.S. Some results\nshould, however, be interpreted with cau-\ntion. The exclusion of youth with diabetes\nwas based on participant response to a\nquestion about use of insulin or glucose\nregulators; however, the validity of data\nbased on responses to such questions is\nvery high. More importantly, the survey\ndid not have compatible physical activity\nquestions for youths aged 8\u00ad16 years,\nand physical activity is a major potential\nconfounder for insulin sensitivity and po-\ntentially for glucose and HbA1c\nlevels.\nThese factors may well play a role in the\nobserved ethnic differences as well as\nother differences in HbA1c\nlevels.\nIn conclusion, we have provided na-\ntional reference values for HbA1c\ndistribu-\ntion among individuals aged 5\u00ad24 years\nin the U.S. The physiopathological mean-\ning of differences in HbA1c\nlevels within a\nnormal range, however, is not estab-\nlished.
