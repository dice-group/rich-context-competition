CRELES has\na rich array of health indicators, including subjective\nhealth, functional disability, mental health, frailty, and an\narray of objectively measured health conditions from\nblood and urine samples, as well as mortality data. In ad-\ndition, CRELES collected data on various pathways\nthrough which these SES effects might be mediated as\nthey influence different types of health indicators. In this\narticle, we both document varying SES gradients across a\nwide range of well-defined health indicators and also esti-\nmate SES gradients in mediating behavior variables in\norder to elucidate what hypotheses may be most promis-\ning for further research.\nBackground\nAnalyses in developed countries have found SES and\nadult health to be significantly positively correlated--\nbetter health at higher SES (Seeman et al., 2008)--though\ngradients appear smaller at older ages than at earlier ages\n2007). In developing countries, there has been much less\nstudy of older adult health differentials, partly due to the\npaucity of appropriate data until recent years. Now avail-\nable surveys in elderly populations in Asia and Latin\nAmerica do indeed appear to also show substantially poorer\nself-assessed health among the low educated (Palloni &\nHowever, the SES gradient in less subjective indicators is\nmuch less consistent. In Asia, surveys such as in Taiwan\nhave found unclear relationships between SES and indica-\ntors of functional health, and SES differentials appear to\neven reverse for life-threatening measurements such as\nstroke, cancer, and diabetes (Zimmer et al., 2002). In contrast,\nLatin American surveys such as in Mexico find that the SES\ngradient persists for chronic conditions like diabetes, al-\nthough with less strength than that observed in self-assessed\nhealth indicators (Palloni & McEniry, 2004).

To determine socioeconomic status (SES) gradients in the different dimensions of health among elderly\nCosta Ricans. Hypothesis: SES disparities in adult health are minimal in Costa Rican society.\nMethods. Data from the Costa Rican Study on Longevity and Healthy Aging study: 8,000 elderly Costa Ricans to\ntions and biomarkers from anthropometry and blood and urine specimens.\nResults. The ultimate health indicator, mortality, as well as the metabolic syndrome, reveals that better educated and\nwealthier individuals are worse off. In contrast, quality of life\u00adrelated measures such as functional and cognitive dis-\nabilities, physical frailty, and depression all clearly worsen with lower SES. Overall self-reported health (SRH) also\nshows a strong positive SES gradient. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and cholesterol are not\nsignificantly related to SES, but hypertension and obesity are worse among high-SES individuals. Reflecting mixed SES\ngradients in behaviors, smoking and lack of exercise are more common among low SES, but high calorie diets are more\ncommon among high SES.\nConclusions. Negative modern behaviors among high-SES groups may be reversing cardiovascular risks across SES\ngroups, hence reversing mortality risks. But negative SES gradients in healthy years of life persist.\nKey Words: Aging--Biological markers--Costa Rica--Health--Mortality--Socioeconomic status.\nand LatinAmerican studies, socioeconomic differentials are\noften smaller than those observed in the high-income\ncountries.\nWhen studying mortality indicators, SES differentials for\nolder adults are again not well understood in developing\ncountries. A few recent studies have found that mortality by\ncardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes tends to be\nhigher in the more developed areas of Costa Rica (Rosero-\nRicans showed no significant differences in survival by SES\namong older people (Rosero-Bixby, Dow, & Lacle, 2005).\nAnother challenging result is the so called \"Hispanic Para-\ndox\"; that is, the lower mortality of elderly Hispanics com-\npared with the much more affluent White population in the\nUnited States (Elo, Turra, Kestenbaum, & Ferguson, 2004),\nwhich some argue may be partly due to cultural differences\nin health behaviors and psychosocial support. Hispanics also\nshow significantly smaller SES differentials in mortality\nthan Whites (Turra & Goldman, 2007). By contrast, Bangla-\ndesh data from a surveillance site shows the expected\npattern of higher adult mortality at lower education (Hurt,\nVarious hypotheses have been suggested to explain differ-\nent dimensions of the conflicting SES patterns in adult\nhealth. Some authors attribute to selection effects the weak-\nening of SES differentials by age: that is, mortality elimi-\nnates the frailest individuals at early ages in groups with\nlower SES (Crimmins, 2005). But selection effects cannot\neasily explain the contrasting relationships across different\ndomains of objective and subjectively reported health. These\npuzzles could be partly due to systematic biases by SES in\nsubjective self-reports, but they also may reflect true differ-\nences in SES gradients across different domains of health.\nFor example, it could be that low SES is associated with de-\nmanding physical labor across the life course that manifests\nin self-reported pain and mobility problems, whereas middle\nand higher income is associated with developed country life-\nstyles that elevate cardiovascular risks for mortality. Buffers\nto low SES may also operate differentially on different health\ndomains, with national health insurance enabling low SES to\nbuffer the ill effects of certain medically manageable cardio-\nvascular risk factors, but with fewer buffers potentially avail-\nable against the adverse effects of cumulative insults from\nlow social and occupational status.\nCosta Rica is well known as a country with outstanding\nhealth indicators. Its life expectancy at birth (78 years) is\nthe second highest in the Americas (Canada is first), higher\neven than in the United States (World Bank, 2006). Broad\nexplanations of Costa Rica's health achievements in the lit-\nerature include the orientation of the government toward\nequity and social development, with large social invest-\nments being possible in part due to the absence of military\nexpenditures, given that the 1949 constitution abolished the\narmed forces (Rosero-Bixby, 1991). Investments in educa-\ntion and the very high coverage of health insurance are of-\nten mentioned as key factors (Caldwell, 1986). The social\nsecurity system, which is funded from deductions from pay-\nrolls and from contributions by employers and the govern-\nment, is the provider of health insurance and health services\nwith an almost universal coverage, especially for the elderly\npopulation. All workers in the formal sector and many\nworkers in the informal sector contribute to the system and\nare entitled to health insurance that allows them and their\nfamilies to receive free health care services and free medi-\ncations at any hospital, clinic, or community health center.\nAdditionally, the government provides free health insurance\nto poor people. According to the 2000 census, health insur-\nance covers 82% of the population, including 9% destitute\nindividuals whose insurance is paid by the government\n(Rosero-Bixby, 2004a).These percentages are higher among\nthe elderly population. Provision of primary health care,\nparticularly to remote or poor populations, has had a quan-\ntifiable impact on death rates (Rosero-Bixby, 2004b).\nIn economic terms, Costa Rica does not differ from the\nLatin American average. According to the World Bank\npared with the $3,600 average for Latin America. However,\nin terms of equity in income distribution, social security\ncoverage, access to public health services and sanitation,\nlabor laws, and protection of the environment, Costa Rica\nranks among the highest in the continent. Costa Rica has a\nmixed economy with open markets and, at the same time,\ngovernment control of key areas such as health, education,\nbanking, energy, communications, and insurance (Mesa-\nLago, 2000). The Human Development Index of the United\nNations ranks Costa Rica 48th in the world and fourth in\nLatin America (after Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay).\nThis article follows a simple framework (Figure 1) to or-\nganize the different dimensions and indicators of health\n(Crimmins & Seeman, 2004). General health outcomes such\nas mortality and physical functioning are the end points of\nthe framework. Proximate determinants very close to these\noutcomes are specific biological risk factors, usually mea-\nsured by biomarkers such as blood pressure, obesity, and\nglucose levels. Then, one step back in the explanation hier-\narchy, there are health behaviors (diet, smoking, exercising)\nand health care services. This article analyzes the SES gra-\ndient for these three levels of health dimensions. Some de-\nmographic factors, such as age, sex, and marital status, are\nconsidered at the same hierarchical level and SES, and\ntherefore their confounding effects must be controlled for.\nObjective\nThe purpose of the article is to fill the breach in the litera-\nture regarding SES gradients in objectively measured adult\nhealth indicators in developing countries. Does the well-\ndocumented, strong connection of poor health and low SES\namong adults of rich countries and among children of\ndeveloping countries persist in hard data for adults in middle-\nincome countries like Costa Rica?\nThis analysis is of interest for multiple reasons. First,\nSES disparities in health outcomes are interesting in and of\nthemselves and have received a great deal of public atten-\ntion in other settings (such as in the United States or among\nchildren in Latin America). Yet they have rarely been docu-\nmented in Latin American adult populations, primarily due\nto lack of data, except on a few select indicators. A key con-\ntribution of this article is the availability in CRELES of a\nwide range of both subjective and objective health mea-\nsures, which we analyze within a uniform empirical frame-\nwork, creating an unparalleled opportunity in LatinAmerica\nto make SES gradient comparisons across them.\nSecond, the analysis is of interest because once we have\nestablished stylized facts about health disparities in this\npopulation, we can begin to evaluate existing hypotheses\nand generate new ones about the determinants of health pat-\nterns in this setting. There are many hypotheses about why\nhealth is typically worse in low SES populations. Similarly,\nmany hypotheses have been advanced about how a middle-\nincome country such as Costa Rica has been able to obtain\nexceptionally good population average health outcomes,\nsuch as higher life expectancy than the United States.\nThese generally relate to models of the social determi-\nnants of population health: health care access, health be-\nhaviors, environmental health exposures, psychosocial\nstressors (inequality), and the ability to buffer against nega-\ntive health shocks (social safety nets, social capital, and in-\nterpersonal ties). Although we do not formally test such\nhypotheses in this article, our analyses speak to the face va-\nlidity of how some of these may or may not operate in Costa\nRica. Because this is the first nationwide survey of adult\nhealth in Costa Rica, this article provides the first opportu-\nnity for beginning to evaluate such hypotheses.\nThe main hypothesis that we do test in this article is the\nprovocative proposition that there is no SES gradient in\nCosta Rican adult health. This hypothesis is based on prior\nfindings of no education or wealth gradients in Costa Rican\nmortality, from the only previous study on the subject, using\ndata from a single peri-urban community (Rosero-Bixby\net al., 2005). Observers have hypothesized that Costa Rica\nmay have little SES gradient due to factors such as universal\nhealth insurance (which has allowed low SES groups simi-\nlar access to care as high SES groups) in combination with\nCosta Rica perhaps being an unusually equitable society.\nFor these factors to have been instrumental in minimizing\nSES gradients, however, it should be the case that SES gra-\ndients would be minimal across a wide range of health indi-\ncators beyond just mortality--which is exactly what our\nanalyses test.\nData and Methods\nData for this analysis come from CRELES, an on-going\nlongitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of\nCosta Rica in the year 2000, with oversampling of the old-\nest old and with an in-depth, longitudinal survey in a sub-\nsample of about 3,000 of them. For this analysis, we use\nmortality data from the computer follow-up of the sample\nin the national death registry from September 2000 to\nSeptember 2006. The data on health (mostly prevalence of\nconditions) come from the first wave of interviews in the\nwas randomly selected from the 2000 census database after\nstratification by 5-year age groups. Sampling fractions\nfor those born before 1905. For the in-depth longitudinal\nsurvey, CRELES took from the mother sample a systematic\nsubsample of 60 \"health areas\" (out of 102 for the whole\ncountry). This subsample included originally more than\nThe subsample, which covers 59% of Costa Rican territory,\nyielded the following nonresponse rates: 19% of the indi-\nviduals were deceased by the contact date, 18% were not\nfound in the field, 2% moved to other addresses, 2% re-\njected the interview, and 2% remain as pending interviews\nafter several visits (likely rejections). The individuals we\nFigure 1. Framework for studying health indicators in three levels.\ndid not find in the field originated mostly in the vagueness\nof the census address (and the lack of an accurate address\nsystem in Costa Rica), as well as from address changes dur-\ning the approximately 5-year lag between the census and\nour visit. Thus, it would be unlikely that this group's SES\npatterns in health would be so different from the inter-\nviewed population so as to create significant selection ef-\nfects that bias the estimated health\u00adSES relationships.\nAmong those interviewed, 95% provided a blood sample,\n92% collected urine overnight, 91% had all anthropometric\nmeasures, and 24% required a proxy to answer the ques-\ntionnaire.\nAll the data and specimens in the subsample were col-\nlected at the participants' homes, usually in two visits. In\nthe first visit, participants provided informed consent and\nanswered a 90-min questionnaire (including some mobility\ntests and two blood pressure measures) as well as a 10-min\nfrequency of tracer food consumption questionnaire. In a\nsecond visit early the next day, fasting blood samples were\ncollected by venipuncture: one EDTA tube (for 3\u00ad4 ml of\nwhole blood) and two serum-separating tubes, with a clot\nrum). In this visit, the field team also picked up a cooler\ncontaining 12-h overnight urine and took the anthropomet-\nric measures. All field data were collected using Personal\nDigital Assistants, also known as palm computers, with\nsoftware applications developed by the Central American\nPopulation Center for this study.\nA field team of five interviewers, two phlebotomists, and\na supervisor collected the information and the blood and\nurine specimens using a continuous fieldwork design over a\nperiod of nearly 2 years. The field team received a 2-week\ntraining course that included standardized anthropometric\nmeasures. Several Costa Rican laboratories analyzed the\nblood and urine specimens, depending on the type of bio-\nmarker. All laboratories were certified by a national refer-\nence center of clinical chemistry, an agency under the\nMinistry of Health. In addition to the internal reliability\ntests that these laboratories must conduct as part of their\nquality control procedures, we conducted reliability analy-\nses in subsamples of 20\u00ad40 specimens that were reanalyzed\nfor each biomarker in a different laboratory. We report else-\nwhere the results of these reliability analyses, as well as\nsome adjustments introduced to standardize measures\nacross laboratories (M\u00e9ndez-Chac\u00f3n, Rosero-Bixby,\nFern\u00e1ndez-Rojas, & Barrantes-Jim\u00e9nez, 2007).\nWe identified deaths of the 8,000 individuals in the origi-\nnal sample by computer follow-up in the national death reg-\nidentification number (the c\u00e9dula) that all Costa Ricans\nhave. Prior research has indicated that the death registry is\nvalidate the registry quality, we were able to successfully\nmatch in the registry all of the several hundred deaths that\nwe identified while attempting to contact individuals in the\nfield for the household survey, thus finding no deaths miss-\ning from the registry.\nDependent Variables--Health Outcomes\nWe study three groups of dependent variables. All are\ncoded as 0, 1 dichotomous indicators, with 1 measuring un-\nfavorable conditions or events: (a) general health outcomes,\n(b) specific poor health conditions, including biomarkers,\nand (c) unhealthy lifestyles.\n1. Seven general health outcomes:\nDeath in the period September 2000 to Septem-\n\u00b7\nals. About 1,000 foreigners are excluded from the\noriginal mother sample of 9,000 because they do not\nhave the personal identification ID that allows the\ncomputer follow-up to establish death and its date.\nThe database was organized as a survival time file\nwith left and right censoring. Individuals were ob-\nserved 7 years or until death. The information on age\nis computed from the birth date in the birth record,\navoiding the possibility of age-exaggeration errors.\nOrdinal general SRH status. From the five possible\n\u00b7\nanswers, we took the two lowest (mala and regular)\nas defining poor SRH.\nFunctional disability when\n\u00b7 respondents have difficul-\nties doing 50% or more of 14 activities and instru-\nmental activities and instrumental activities of daily\nliving (activities of daily living (ADLs)/instrumental\nactivities of daily living (IADLs)), namely: walking\non the streets, climbing stairs, pushing objects, raising\nan arm, crossing the bedroom on your feet, bathing,\neating, going to bed, using the toilet, trimming toe\nnails, cooking, handling money, shopping, and taking\nmedicines. Even though many studies distinguish ba-\nsic, instrumental, and functional disabilities, we com-\nbine all these dimensions in a single indicator after\nchecking that the Cronbach's alpha of the scale was an\nexcellent .92 for the 14 items. This high alpha means\nthat the items were not really different dimensions of\ndisability. A person with basic disability (i.e., cannot\nuse the toilet) is very likely to also have functional and\ninstrumental disability (i.e., cannot cut toenails).\nPhysical frailty: respondents failing two or more\n\u00b7\nout of five physical tests--grip strength with a\ndynamometer, pulmonary peak flow, standing up\nfrom a chair several times, picking an object up\nfrom the floor, and standing and walking 3 m.\nCognitive disability\n\u00b7 according to the Folstein\n(Folstein & Folstein, 1975) Mini-Mental State\nExamination (MMSE) (Quiroga,Albala, & Klaasen,\n2004).

The scale from\nadding the 15 items had an acceptable Cronbach's\nGeriatric depression refers to individuals with nine\n\u00b7\nor more out of 15 Yesavage symptoms of depres-\nsion (Sheikh &Yesavage, 1986). It is not measured\nin participants who required a proxy (24%). The\nCronbach's alpha of the scale was .85.\nMetabolic syndrome,\n\u00b7 which is a combination of five\nhealth conditions (abdominal girth, diabetes, triglyc-\nerides, High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholester-\nol, and high blood pressure) that increase a respon-\ndent's risk for CVD as defined by the International\nDiabetes Federation (IDF, 2006). The syndrome is\npresent when individuals have high abdominal girth\nand at least two of the other four conditions.\n2. Specific biological risk factors (Table 2 shows the\ncutoff points to define \"at risk\"). Some of them are\ncomponents of the previous health outcomes.

Although there is\nsome degree of overlap for several of them, this large num-\nber reflects the multidimensional character of the health\nconcept and the complexities of measuring it. To facilitate\ninterpretation and comparisons of results among the differ-\nent outcomes, we opted for measuring them all with binary\nor dichotomous indicators of bad health. We recognize that\nthere is some loss of information from translating continu-\nous variables into dichotomous indicators. However, this\nloss is compensated by the gain in comparability and inter-\npretability as well as by the gain of avoiding the distorting\neffects from extreme outlier values. Where possible, we di-\nchotomized variables with cutoff values commonly used in\nclinical practice and the literature, including MMSE cogni-\ntive disability, Yesavage geriatric depression, triglycerides,\nCRP, obesity, abdominal obesity, and high- and low-calorie\ndiet. There are also several indicators that are naturally di-\nchotomous, including death, metabolic syndrome, diabetes,\nhigh blood pressure, smoking, lack of physical exercise, and\nflu vaccine. For the remaining 12 (out of 27) variables, our\nchoice of cutoff values was driven by the observation of\nnatural breaks in the distribution (SRH, functional disabil-\nity, frailty, grip strength, and carbohydrate and fat intake) or\nwas borrowed from the MacArthur study of healthy aging\nSES Variables\nWe examine the effect on health of three SES variables:\nplace of residence, education, and household wealth. All\nthree are categorized in three levels in order to ascertain the\ntwo sides of SES gradients: pertaining to a low-SES stratum\nor being a high-SES individual. For comparison purposes,\nthese three variables are considered constant over time, and\nwe are taking them as reported in the 2000 census, years\nprior to health measurement (note that mortality is studied\nsame in both data sets).\nlowlands, which include coastal regions at the Pacific\nOcean and Caribbean, as well as the northern plains\nbordering Nicaragua and the Southern region bordering\nPanama; (2) in the rest of the highlands at the Central\nValley, which includes some suburbs and satellite towns\nof San Jose; (3) in the more developed metropolitan\narea of San Jose, the capital city. Although \"place\" is\nnot an individual-level variable, there is a large litera-\nture considering the role of place in health disparities\n(e.g., Curtis and Rees-Jones, 1998). Our simple catego-\nrization distinguishing urban and these other settings is\nconsistent with a long literature that has documented\nrural\u00adurban differences in health in various settings.\n2. Educational attainment in three naturally defined\ngroups: (a) none, (b) elementary (one to six grades),\nand (c) some secondary (postelementary) school or\nhigher. The effects of education are some of the most\nstudied among SES variables, given that education is\neasy to measure, does not change in adult life, is easily\ncomparable, and has a number of socioeconomic influ-\nences related to factors such as empowerment, income\ngeneration, information gathering, and health-seeking\nbehavior (Elo & Preston, 1996; Hummer, Rogers, &\n3. Household wealth in three groups: poor, middle, and\nrich. It is based on a simple count of 14 goods and con-\nveniences in the household, ranging from no-dirt floors\nand having water connection and electricity to (at the\nhigh end) having a computer and a car. The wealth cat-\negories correspond to natural breaks in the distribution\nof the 0\u00ad14 count. Wealth is in essence income accu-\nmulation or permanent income and thus an indicator\nof economic well-being during long periods (Menchik,\nDemographic and Other Controls\nAs far as possible, we present all health results adjusted\nby three demographic variables: (a) age (single year), (b)\nsex, and (c) marital status (whether or not currently mar-\nried--including consensual unions). Age and marital status\nrefer to the situation at the interview in all prevalence\nanalyses. In the mortality analysis, age is time varying\n(each observation was split into single-age segments), and\nmarital status is in the census interview in the year 2000.\nWe also controlled in the regression models for the field\nworker who conducted the interview or took the anthropo-\nmetric measures or other exams to correct potential inter-\nviewer and measurement biases (all data were gathered by\nseven field workers over a period of 2 years). Although all\nfield workers received the same training, and visited the\nsame areas, and the work load was more or less randomly\ndistributed, it is always possible that idiosyncratic behavior\nof a specific field worker might introduce some measure-\nment bias. For example, female examiners may tend to\nmeasure significantly lower values of waist circumference\nin female participants. Controlling for field worker in the\nmultivariate analyses prevented the remote possibility that\nthese biases were also correlated to SES of participants and\nthus were confounders of the relationship between health\nand SES.\nStatistical Methods\nTo study mortality, we set the data as survival time\nmonths after the census interview to avoid likely biases in\ncase some hospitalized or very sick individuals were not\ninterviewed in the June census) and exit or right censoring\nat September 2007. We split observations into single-year\nsegments (approximately seven segments per individual).\nMortality rates were computed as the ratio of deaths to the\nexact count of person-years. We model some SES gradi-\nents in mortality with parametric hazard regression (streg\ncommand in Stata), assuming a Gompertz distribution\nWe used logistic regression models to estimate the SES\ngradients on health outcomes. The models control for de-\nmographic confounding effects as well as for the studied\nSES effects. To consider the possibility that age effects are\nnonlinear and differential by sex, we included in the models\na quadratic term for age and an interaction term for age and\nsex. To compare odds ratios across models, we reanalyzed\nmortality using a logistic model with the probability of dy-\ning in each age of the observation period as the dependent\nvariable. In this model, we used robust estimates that take\ninto account the lack of independence of age segments\nwithin each individual.\nThe standard errors in the logistic models were estimated\nconsidering the clustering effect of selecting whole health\nareas in the subsample. This relaxed the assumption of inde-\npendence among observations and required only that obser-\nvations be independent across clusters. In some analyses,\nwe assessed the significance of the joint effect of the three\nSES variables with a chi-square test of the improvement in\nthe log-likelihood ratio resulting from including SES in the\nregression model.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the sizes and the composition by SES and\ndemographic characteristics of the sample. The three cate-\ngories by place of residence are about the same size. In con-\ntrast, education and wealth define a middle group with about\ntwo thirds of the observations. The low-end and high-end\ngroups for these two variables comprise between 10% and\n25% of observations. The distribution by age reflects over-\nsampling of old-age groups by design. As usual in elderly\npopulations, there are more women than men. About 50%\nof the sample is married or in consensual union.\nSample size varies depending on the studied outcome\n(Table 2).

Comparing the two age groups provides an ini-\ntial snapshot of how indicators shift with age, although it\ndoes not allow us to separate out potential confounding\nfrom cohort-specific effects (e.g., younger cohorts adopting\nWestern lifestyles that influence their health) as well as se-\nlection effects (e.g., smokers may die at younger ages,\nwhich means that they are underrepresented at older ages).\nGiven that all are poor-health indicators, one would expect\nsubstantial increments with age (although evidence from\nother studies shows that some of these risk factors, such as\nobesity, cholesterol, and high blood pressure, may decline\nin late life as a result of other serious comorbidities). This is\nthe case for the mortality rate with a sixfold increase--the\nlargest in the table. Cognitive and functional disabilities\nshow a fivefold increment, with age being the closest to\nmortality. SRH and depression change little with age, and\nmetabolic syndrome actually moves in the opposite direc-\ntion from the expected age effect--declining (which is a\nhealth improvement) 20% for older people. Health condi-\ntions that do not worsen, and even improve, with aging in-\nclude the five components of metabolic syndrome: obesity,\ndiabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high\ntriglycerides. These age trends could be a reflection of im-\nproved CV health with aging within each individual. Or\nthey could simply come from changes in the composition of\nthe population with aging in a selection in frailty process\n(Vaupel, Manton, & Stallard, 1979) that eliminates the frail\nand sick at earlier ages. The remaining biomarkers in the\nsecond panel of Table 2 deteriorate (increase) with age, al-\nthough at rates substantially lower than mortality. Low crea-\ntinine clearance, a marker of kidney malfunction, and grip\nstrength are the only ones with a substantial aging increase\n(ratio higher than 2).\nMost behavioral or lifestyle indicators in the third panel\nof Table 2 improve (diminish) with age. Prevalence of\nsmoking and obesity are less than half after age 80 than in\nand high-carbohydrate diet by one third. The only behav-\nioral deteriorations in the table are the lack of exercise and\nan increase in the proportion of individuals with a hypocal-\noric diet (probably because of loss of appetite).\nTurning to the SES gradient issue, the exceptionally good\nhealth indicators of the Costa Rican population are by them-\nselves a challenge to the notion of an inevitable SES gradient.\nDeath rates of Costa Rican adults in the CRELES sample are\nlower than in the United States and not very different than in\nJapan, especially at higher ages (Figure 2), in spite of the sub-\nstantially lower SES of the Latin American population mea-\nsured by any traditional indicator such as education, income,\nor health expenditure. It is remarkable that a population with\na per capita income that is one fifth of the United States' and\nper capita health expenditures that are one tenth of the United\nStates' can have lower death rates than the United States. Life\nexpectancy at age 60 implicit in the mortality rates in Figure\nOften demographers have found that apparently low\nmortality at old ages in developing countries are solely an\nartifact of mismeasurement, particularly because of age ex-\naggeration in census data that inflates the denominator and\ndepletes the rates (Coale & Kisker, 1986; Preston, Elo, &\nStewart, 1999). In the Costa Rican sample, however, age\nerrors are very unlikely because we are using data on exact\nbirthdates as they appear in civil registration records and on\nthe universal identity card, the c\u00e9dula. The possibility that\nwe are finding low rates because of missing deaths in our\ncomputer follow-up is also remote because in the subsam-\nple of about 4,000 individuals CRELES visited, there was\nnot a single case of a deceased person that was not also re-\ncorded in the national death registry computer follow-up.\nFurthermore, two other studies of old age mortality in Costa\nRica have found similarly low rates (Rosero-Bixby, 2008;\nTable 1. Socioeconomic Status (SES) and Demographic Variables in\nthe Mortality Sample and Prevalence Subsample\nSES and Demographic\nVariables\nMortality\nSample\nPrevalence\nSubsample\nN % N %\nResidence\nEducation\nWealth\nDemographic controls\nAge (years)\nSex\nMarital status\nsubsample. Unweighted results.\nWithin Costa Rica, there is not a clear SES gradient in\nadult mortality or, if anything, the gradient is contrary to\nexpectations. Table 3 and Figure 3 show that in our sample,\nthere are slight increases in mortality with higher levels of\neducation and wealth, net of other influences, and the least\ndeveloped lowlands have lower mortality than the more de-\nveloped highlands. Only the more developed capital city\nbehaves according to expectations, showing lower mortal-\nity, although by a small margin.\nThese mortality gradients contrast dramatically with the ob-\nserved differentials by SRH in Table 3 and Figure 3. The afflu-\nent and those with high school education self-report 40% less\npoor health than the national population. The poor, those with\nno formal education, and those living in the lowlands report\n20% more poor health than the national average. This contra-\ndiction between mortality and SRH is the motivation for the\nadjective of \"surprising\" SES gradients in this article's title.\nIn four other health outcomes, SES effects are similar to\nthose observed for SRH (Table 3). High-SES individuals\nare less affected by functional, physical, and cognitive\ndisabilities, or by depression. However, metabolic syndrome\n(a multidimensional risk factor for CVD) behaves more\nlike mortality with no significant SES differentials. There\nare also peculiarities of metabolic syndrome variation with\nage (no gradient), sex (much lower in men), and conjugal\nstatus (higher among the married), but these are not the\nfocus of this article. Given the enormous importance of\nCVD in adult mortality (nearly half of old-age deaths are\nTable 2.

Age-specific death rates. Costa Rica sample, Japan, and United States.\ncardiovascular related in Costa Rica), this CVD risk factor\nhelps explain the observed lack of SES gradients in overall\nmortality.\nTo more finely explore the SES gradients in 20 interme-\ndiate health conditions, Table 4 summarizes the results ob-\ntained from a series of logistic regressions.With a regression\nmodel for each health condition, We first estimated the net\neffects of the three SES variables and whether there was a\nsignificant joint effect of including the three variables in\neach model. In one third of the health indicators in the table\n(6 out of 20), there are no significant joint SES effects. In\nthe rest, the SES gradient sometimes behaves as expected\nwith below-one odds ratio for the high-SES categories and\nabove one for the low SES. However, the reverse also is\npresent in several indicators, such as obesity and triglycer-\nides. To make things more complicated, there are several\ncases of a curvilinear SES gradient, in which the middle-\nSES group is the worse off. That is the case for triglycerides\nby wealth; cholesterol and abdominal girth by education;\nand DHEA-S, epinephrine, and norepinephrine by place of\nresidence.\nFigure 4 summarizes the large amount of information\npresented in Tables 3 and 4. With a logistic regression model\nfor each health condition, the net effect of the three high-\nSES characteristics (metro San Jose, high school education,\nand rich wealth). We then summarized the three odds ratios\nby computing the one that would correspond to an individ-\nual with simultaneously the three high-SES characteristics;\nthat is, by multiplication of the three odds ratios, and (ex-\ncept in six cases as described subsequently) we report this\nproduct in Figure 4. Given that this procedure presumes no\ninteractions among the three SES variables, we also tested\nmodels with the triple interaction of the three low-SES indi-\ncators and with the triple interaction of the three high-SES\nindicators (these extreme groups of all low SES and all high\nSES each represent only 4% of the sample). In the six (out\nof 54) regression models where these interactions proved\nsignificant, we instead report in Figure 4 an odds ratio that\nincludes this triple interaction, rather than the previously\ndescribed product of the odds ratios in the uninteracted\nmodel. In five of the six significant triple-interacted models,\nresults were insensitive to the choice of method. Figure 4\nshows these hypothetical odds ratios, sorted descending by\nthe low-SES effect, which conversely results in approxi-\nmately ascending sorting by the high-SES effects. Figures\nbelow 1 (dots at the left) denote good health; that is, the risk\nof suffering the condition is lower in the group with respect\nto the rest of the population.\nIf the SES gradient behaved as expected in Figure 4,\nthe high-SES triangles should line up at the left of the\nTable 3.

Re-\nality, as depicted by this Costa Rican sample, is far from\nthat expected gradient. There are three groups in our 27\nhealth indicators: (a) 11 health indicators with the ex-\npected gradient of better health at high SES, (b) 9 health\nconditions, including death, in which low-SES individu-\nals are better off, and (3) 7 indicators with no significant\nSES effects.\nThe expected SES gradient (Figure 4) occurs in five of\nour seven health outcomes (SRH; cognitive, functional,\nFigure 3.

The pattern of the flu vaccine (although mar-\nginally nonsignificant) is on line with earlier findings that the\nCosta Rican primary health care system equalizes access to\nhealth in all SES levels. It has been shown, for example, that\nthere is a lower coverage of immunization among children of\nmore affluent mothers (Chen-Mok et al., 2001). It is interest-\ning to note that in several CVD risk factors, the SES disad-\nvantagedgroupsdobetter,includingtriglycerides,cholesterol\nratio, high blood pressure, diabetes, and fatty diet, although\nsome of the effects are not significant.\nDiscussion\nRich data for elderly Costa Ricans from the CRELES\nproject, which include a 6-year follow-up of a sample of\nshow puzzling SES gradients in 26 health indicators. Disad-\nvantaged groups in terms of education, wealth, and resi-\ndence show steep health deficits in SRH as well as in\nindicators of functionality and physical and mental fitness.\nIn contrast, in the single most important health outcome,\nmortality, there are no significant SES differentials; on the\ncontrary, there are even hints that low-SES groups might be\nbetter off. Metabolic syndrome, a risk factor for CVD,\nshows a similar pattern as mortality.\nThe direct relationship between SES and mortality found\nin these data may occur only in the elderly population under\nstudy (60 years and over). The usual inverse relationship\nmay persist in younger ages, which were not included in the\nanalyzed sample.\nThis study intentionally considers a large number of\nhealth indicators to reflect the multidimensional character\nof the health concept. The results show that these multiple\ndimensions of health do not behave in a monolithic way.\nSES, and aging as well, generates very diverse responses in\ndifferent aspects of health. Cognitive impairment, for ex-\nample, is substantially higher at older age and low SES (al-\nthough the strong negative association with education may\nbe exaggerated by a cultural bias in the Mini Mental test).\nSimilarly, geriatric depression in our data is one of the most\nclear correlates with low SES, but it changes little with age\n(though the latter may be due to the large proportion of\nmissing responses among the oldest old needing a proxy in\nthe interview). Our stress-related biomarkers--epinephrine\nand norepinephrine--also show an advantage for the afflu-\nent and educated.\nRisk factors for CVD show more nuanced and mixed pat-\nterns by SES. These Costa Rican data show that socioeco-\nnomically disadvantaged populations have lower prevalence\nFigure 4.

SRH = self-rated health; CRP = C-reactive protein; DHEA-S = Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate\nof obesity, hypercholesterolemia, triglycerides, hyperten-\nsion, and hyperglycemia. The changing association between\nSES and CVD merits careful monitoring in countries like\nCosta Rica. DHEA-S, a hormone some consider a marker of\naging, also shows a more favorable situation in low-SES\nindividuals.\nBehavioral or lifestyle risk factors also show diver-\ngent patterns by SES. Smoking, sedentariness, and high-\ncarbohydrate diets are less prevalent among the better off.\nBut obesity, high fat, and high-calorie diets diminish con-\nsistently and substantially with SES. Interestingly, there\nare no negative SES gradients in our indicator of access to\npreventive care: having had the flu vaccine. This is an in-\ndication of an important attribute of the public primary\nhealth care system in Costa Rica--its coverage of the\nlower strata of society to equalize access to health care\nViewing the diet-related biomarkers in conjunction with\nthe dietary intake data, we can hypothesize that worse nu-\ntritional behaviors among higher SES groups may be play-\ning a significant role in driving the worse CVD risks, and\nhence higher mortality, among the higher SES. Moreover,\nthe low-calorie diet of low-SES individuals might be a\nprotective factor because it has been shown that dietary\ncaloric restriction slows ageing in other species (Roth et\nal., 2002). This raises the question of what the time path\nhas been and will be of SES gradients in nutritional be-\nhaviors. A substantial literature has documented the tran-\nsition of middle-income countries from positive\nSES\u00adobesity relationships to negative ones as countries\ndevelop (e.g., Monteiro, Moura, Conde, & Popkin, 2004);\nwhereas countries such as Mexico appear to have already\nmoved through this nutritional transition, Costa Rica ap-\npears to lag. It will be useful for future work to document\nthe history of this SES\u00adnutrition relationship in Costa\nRica, as well as to closely track its evolution, as this may\nhave major implications for whether Costa Rica's mortal-\nity gradient reverses in the future to the more usual nega-\ntive relationship with SES.\nFor the broader set of health indicators examined, how-\never, we do not know whether the findings in this article are\nunique to Costa Rica or whether they are common in other\nmiddle- and low-income countries. Reliable data to study\nSES gradients in adult mortality and in \"hard\" health indi-\ncators are rare. The more available \"soft\" data on SRH show\nthe steep SES gradient observed in this article. However,\nthis article shows that one cannot jump from there to con-\nclusions on other health outcomes. More research is clearly\nneeded in adult health outside the developed countries.\nCosta Rica is a special case of exceptional achievements\nin health and social development in spite of a weak econ-\nomy. Two decades ago it was included, along with Sri\nLanka, Kerala, China, and Cuba, among the world show-\ncases of \"good health at low cost\" (Halstead, Walsh, &\nWarren, 1985), and it has remained in that category. Some\nhave explained the country's longevity achievements with\nits investments in education and health insurance (Caldwell,\n1986). However, those can only be part of the explanation\nbecause even those with no education are doing fine in im-\nportant aspects of health, including health dimensions not\nclearly influenced by medical care access. It could even be\nthat if a poor or traditional society completes the first stage\nof the epidemiologic transition by controlling communicable\ndiseases, some traditional lifestyles can protect it from health\nproblems like obesity and take it to better general health in-\ndicators such as lower mortality. This evidence of success is\ntempered, however, by our strong evidence of a significant\nSES gradient in functional and mental health indicators, sug-\ngesting that disability-free life expectancy is indeed worse\namong more vulnerable adults even in Costa Rica.\nFunding\nThe CRELES project is a longitudinal study of the Universidad de Costa\nRica, carried on by the Centro Centroamericano de Poblaci\u00f3n in collabora-\ntion with the Instituto de Investigaciones en Salud, with the support of the\n"
