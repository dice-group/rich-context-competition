The mechanism(s) underlying the effects of APOE\non AD pathology remains unclear. In vivo, dendritic spine\ndensity is lower in APOE4-targeted replacement (APOE-TR)\nmice compared with APOE2- and APOE3-TR mice. To inves-\ntigate whether this apoE4-induced decrease in spine density\nresults from alterations in the formation or the loss of den-\ndritic spines, the effects of neuron age and apoE isoform on\nthe total number and subclasses of spines were examined\nin long-term wild-type neurons co-cultured with glia from\nAPOE2-, APOE3- and APOE4-TR mice. Dendritic spine density\nand maturation were evaluated by immunocytochemistry via\nthepresenceofdrebrin(anactin-bindingprotein)withGluN1\n(NMDA receptor subunit) and GluA2 (AMPA receptor subunit)\nclusters. ApoE isoform effects were analyzed via a method\npreviously established that identifies phases of spine forma-\nloss (DIV21\u00ad26). In the formation phase, apoE4 delayed total\nspine formation. During the maintenance phase, the density\nof GluN1 + GluA2 spines did not change with apoE2, while\nthe density of these spines decreased with apoE4 compared\nto apoE3, primarily due to the loss of GluA2 in spines. During\nthe loss phase, total spine density was lower in neurons with\napoE4 compared to apoE3. Thus, apoE4 delays total spine\nformation and may induce early synaptic dysfunction via\nimpaired regulation of GluA2 in spines.\nr r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email mladu@uic.edu).\nAbbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; AMPAR, -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ionic glutamate receptor; apoE, apolipoprotein E; APOE-TR,\nAPOE4-targeted replacement; DIV, day-in-vitro; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor; wt, wild-type.\nC 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY)\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n",

Within the brain, apoE is\nsynthesized primarily by glia, and secreted for subsequent\ninteractions with members of the apoE family of receptors\nexpressed by neurons and glia (Boyles et al., 1985; Pitas et al.,\nby the APOE gene with three common alleles in the human\npopulation: 2, 3 and 4. Compared to APOE3, inheritance\nof APOE4 increases risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 4- to\n15-fold depending on the presence of one or two alleles, and\nreduces the age of AD onset (Strittmatter and Roses, 1996). In\ncontrast, APOE2 reduces AD risk 2- and 4-fold (Corder et al.,\n1994). The specific mechanisms underlying APOE-dependent\nAD risk remain unclear.\nAD manifests as a loss of short-term memory, followed by\nloss of long-term memory and cognition. Evidence demon-\nstrates loss of hippocampal synapses as a major structural\ncorrelate of the cognitive dysfunctions in AD (Scheff et al.,\nneuron and synapse development, maintenance and repair\nE.

Initial in vitro anal-\nyses of apoE isoform effects on neurons show that apoE3\nenhances, while apoE4 inhibits or has no effect on, neurite\nextension during neuron development (Nathan et al., 1995;\nAPOE-targeted replacement (APOE-TR) mice (Sullivan et al.,\nwas lowest in APOE4-TR mice, compared with APOE2- and\nAPOE3-TR mice (Dumanis et al., 2009).

Ultimately, memory and cognitive\ndeficits result from synaptic dysfunction, which may be the\nresult of glutamate receptor-dependent alterations in spines,\nas spines that lack NMDAR or AMPAR exhibit impaired or loss\nof synaptic transmission (Ye et al., 2000). Interestingly, apoE\nisoforms have been shown to differentially affect NMDAR\nand AMPAR signaling and trafficking: in reelin-stimulated\ncultures, apoE4 inhibits NMDAR subunit phosphorylation\nand surface expression of AMPAR, compared with apoE2\nand apoE3 (Chen et al., 2010). Losses of NMDAR and AMPAR\nin cortical neurons with age have also been reported (Hof\net al., 2002), however, apoE isoform effects on NMDAR and\nAMPAR loss remain unknown.\nIn the current study, the effects of apoE isoform and\nneuron age on the density and composition of NMDAR and\nAMPAR on dendritic spines were examined in long-term wild-\ntype (wt) neurons co-cultured with glia from APOE-TR mice.\nThese effects were evaluated during phases of dendritic spine\nand loss (DIV21\u00ad26) as a continuum, using a method previ-\nously designed for this in vitro model (Nwabuisi-Heath et al.,\n2012). This neuron\u00adglia co-culture model was utilized to take\nadvantage of the natively regulated secretion of apoE by glia\nisolated from APOE2-, APOE3- and APOE4-TR mice. The cur-\nrent study demonstrates that apoE4 delayed spine forma-\ntion during neuron development, compared with apoE2 and\napoE3. With increasing neuron age, apoE4 induced a loss of\nmature spines compared to apoE2 and apoE3, primarily via\nthe loss of AMPAR from spines.\nPrimary neuron, glia, and neuron\u00adglia\nco-cultures\nAnimals were handled according to the Institutional Animal\nCare and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols at the University\nof Illinois at Chicago, and the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Primary\nneuron and glial cultures were prepared as previously de-\nscribed (Nwabuisi-Heath et al., 2012). Briefly, five to seven\nprimary neuron or glial culture, respectively. For co-culture,\nDIV5 neurons prepared from C57BL6 (Charles River, Jackson\nLabs) mouse embryos on 12 mm- or 15 mm-diameter cover-\nslips were transferred into six-well plates containing tertiary\nglial cells prepared from APOE2-, APOE3- or APOE4-TR mice.\nTwo or three coverslips were placed in each well with the neu-\nrons facing the glia.

Briefly, wide-field images of neurons were ac-\nquired using a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 fluorescence microscope\nequipped with a Zeiss AxioCam HRm camera and controlled\nwith Axiovision version 4.7 software. Images were captured\nwith a 63\u00d7 1.4 NA oil objective. Three to five positions per\ncoverslip were randomly selected and a 5\u00d76 mosaic of 63\u00d7\nlution. Each mosaic contained an average of 15\u00ad20 neurons.\nFor dendrite sampling, spiny neurons with discrete dendrites\nwere marked, as determined by immunoreactivity for MAP2\nand drebrin. All channels were then turned off except for\nMAP2 and DAPI for dendrite sampling. Dendrite segments\n20 m in length, from two to three dendrites per neuron,\nwere sampled 50 m away from the cell body. Distance and\nlength measurements were performed using the Axiovision\nsoftware measurement tool. Acquired 20 m dendrite images\nwere discarded in cases where two or more dendrites were\nin close proximity such that overlap of spines was suspected.\nImages of sampled dendrites were exported as tiff images for\nquantitative analysis.\nAs previously described (Nwabuisi-Heath et al., 2012),\ndrebrin, GluN1 and GluA2 cluster quantifications were per-\nformed with ImageJ NIH software using custom plugins. For\nco-localization analysis, juxtaposed (within 1 pixel distance)\nand overlapping clusters were measured as co-localized. All\nmeasurements were performed on a per 20 m dendrite ba-\nsis.

Triple and double co-localizations of GluN1 and\nGluA2 clusters with drebrin clusters (Figure 1) were used to\nidentify spine subtypes. Triply co-localized GluN1, GluA2 and\ndrebrin clusters (GluN1 + GluA2 + drebrin clusters) identified\nmature spines. Immature spine densities were determined\nby subtracting the density of GluN1 + GluA2 + drebrin clus-\nters from total drebrin clusters at each time point per iso-\nform.

On DIV14, spine density was signifi-\ncantly lower with apoE4, with no difference between apoE2\nand apoE3. Between DIV14 and DIV18, spine density increased\nin all three groups with no significant difference among the\napoE isoforms. The lower density of spines with apoE4 early in\ndevelopment (DIV14), and the subsequent increase to levels\ncomparable with apoE2 and apoE3 cultures (DIV18) suggest a\ndelay, rather than a reduction, in spine formation with apoE4.\nFrom DIV18 to DIV21, total spine densities were comparable\nwith apoE2, apoE3 and apoE4.

To determine if apoE isoform had\nspecific effects on subpopulations of spines defined by the\npresence of these two types of glutamate receptors, we first\nanalyzed the density of spines containing both the NMDAR\nsubunit GluN1 and the AMPAR subunit GluA2 (Figure 3A and\nTable 1). On DIV10, the density of spines containing both\nNMDAR and AMPAR (GluN1 + GluA2 positive) were com-\nparable in all apoE groups. On DIV14, while the density of\nGluN1 + GluA2 positive spines increased with all three apoE\nisoforms, apoE2 had a significantly greater effect than apoE3\nand apoE4. On DIV18, these GluN1 + GluA2 positive spines\nreached maximum density in all three isoforms with no dif-\nferences. Thus, despite the delayed increase in total spine\ndensity with apoE4 in the formation phase, the density of\napoE4 mature spines was comparable to apoE3, with apoE2\naccelerated.\n24 C 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nApoE isoform effects on dendritic spines\nTable 1 ApoE isoform and neuron age effects on spine subclasses\nValues shown are density per 20 m dendrite lengths, n equals average of 50 dendrite segments/isoform per time point.

Thus, by DIV21, the greatest\ndensity of GluN1 + GluA2-positive spines was with apoE2, an\nintermediate density with apoE3 and the lowest density with\napoE4. On DIV26, these GluN1 + GluA2-positive spines de-\ncreased in all three groups to levels where densities were com-\nparable between apoE2 and apoE4, and lowest with apoE3.\nBased on these data from DIV18\u00ad26, we conclude that apoE4\ninduces an early loss of functionally mature spines, compared\nwith apoE2 and apoE3.\nNext, we analyzed the effect of apoE isoform on imma-\nture spines, defined as spines that lack one or both of the\nglutamate receptor subunits, GluN1 or GluA2 (Figure 3B).\nOn DIV10, immature spine density was greatest with apoE2,\nand comparable between apoE3 and apoE4. On DIV14, the\nhighest spine density was with apoE3, with no significant\nincrease with apoE2 and apoE4. This is the time point\nwhere the greatest density of mature spine was with apoE2\n(Figure 3A). From DIV14 to DIV18, the density of immature\nspines increased with apoE2 and apoE4. On DIV21, further\nincreases in density were observed with apoE3 and apoE4,\nbut not with apoE2. At DIV26, immature spine densities\nplateaued for apoE2 and apoE3, but significantly decreased\nwith apoE4. The increase in the density of immature spines\nat the maintenance phase (DIV18\u00ad21) suggests that the\ndecrease in the density of mature spines may result from a\nloss of either GluN1 and/or GluA2.\nTo determine the effect of apoE isoform on immature\nspine subclasses, analysis was separated to reflect changes\nin the densities of spines that express only GluN1 (GluN1-\nonly), only GluA2 (GluA2-only), or neither GluN1 or GluA2\n(drebrin-only) (Figure 4 and Table 1). On DIV10, GluN1-only\nspine density was greater with apoE2, and no difference with\nspine density increased with apoE3, resulting in comparable\ndensities between apoE2 and apoE3 and lower with apoE4.\nBy DIV18, GluN1-only spines increased for all isoforms. In-\nterestingly, the maximal density of GluN1-only spines with\napoE4 was comparable to apoE2 and greater than apoE3.\nThese data further support accelerated and delayed forma-\ntion of new spines with apoE2 and apoE4, respectively. At the\nmaintenance phase (DIV18\u00ad21), GluN1-only spines increased\nwith apoE3 and apoE4, but not with apoE2; and significantly\ndecreased with apoE4 on DIV26.\nAnalysis of GluA2-only spines on DIV10 showed a compa-\nrable spine density across apoE isoform (Figure 4B). However,\non DIV14, the highest density was with apoE3. On DIV18, the\ndensity of GluA2-only spines was comparable between apoE2\nand apoE4, with a pronounced decrease with apoE3, perhaps\ndue to acquisition of GluN1 by GluA2-only spines to form\nmature GluN1 + GluA2-positive spines. On DIV21, a decrease\nin the density of GluA2-only spines was observed with apoE4,\nwhile no change was seen with apoE2 or apoE3. On DIV26,\nGluA2-only spines decreased with apoE2 and apoE3, and the\ndecrease with apoE4 on DIV21 continued.\nDrebrin-only spines were analyzed to examine changes\nin the density of spines not yet enriched with GluN1 or\nGluA2, or that may have lost their GluN1 and GluA2 (Fig-\nure 4C).

Significance differences defined as described for\ndensities with no significant difference between the isoforms.\nFrom DIV18 to DIV21, drebrin-only spines significantly in-\ncreased with apoE4. On DIV26, drebrin-only spines increased\nwith apoE2 and apoE3, but not apoE4. These data reveal a\nlater phase of spine development when a decrease in the\ndensity of GluN1 + GluA2-positive spines is accompanied by\nan increase in the densities of GluN1-only and drebrin-only\nspines and a decrease in GluA2-only spines. This suggests\nthat the loss of GluA2 precedes the GluN1 loss in spines. This\nGluA2 loss occurs earlier with apoE4 spines and may con-\ntribute to the early loss of mature GluN1 + GluA2-positive\nspines.\nDISCUSSION\nSeveral studies demonstrate that apoE isoform may differen-\ntially influence synapse density, structure and function, with\nnegative effects reported in the presence of apoE4 (Bour\nherein utilize a co-culture model with natively regulated se-\ncretion of human apoE by glia, the main endogenous source\nof apoE in the CNS. The simultaneous analysis of changes\nin dendritic spines and dendritic spine glutamate receptor\ncomposition demonstrate an apoE4-induced delay in spine\nformation in developing neurons, and with increasing time in\nculture, an early loss of mature spines, compared with apoE2\nand apoE3. Thus, these data provide evidence for a cellu-\nlar and molecular basis for age-dependent apoE4 effects on\nneuron function in vitro.\nAPOE4 is associated with poor memory and cognitive\nperformance and increased risk for AD in older individuals\n(usually after 50 years of age) (Deane et al., 2008; Caselli\net al., 2009). However, young APOE4 carriers exhibit en-\nhanced cognitive performance (Bachmeier et al., 2013), aca-\ndemic achievement (Hawkes et al., 2012) and a higher IQ\nindividuals also show brain oxygen utilization comparable\nto APOE2, and higher than APOE3 individuals (Trachtenberg\net al., 2012). Analysis of developing spine subtypes at max-\nimal spine density showed that with apoE4, the density of\nGluN1 + GluA2 dendritic spines was comparable to apoE3,\nbut the density of NMDAR-rich and AMPAR-poor (GluN1-\nonly) spines was greater with apoE4 than apoE3. These\nNMDAR-rich and AMPAR-poor spines in developing neurons\nare characteristic of immature spines that can undergo sta-\nbilization for memory formation and storage (Bourne and\nHarris, 2007). Thus, these differences in spine composition\nmay provide a structural and molecular basis for the ob-\nserved dichotomy of beneficial effects in young individuals\nwith APOE4 and the detrimental effects of APOE4 in older\nindividuals.\nThe slow development of dendritic spines observed with\napoE4 may also be important in the poor recovery from dam-\nage by other insults, such as traumatic brain injury (Teasdale\nisoform-specific effects on inflammation may also be af-\nfecting dendritic spines. Aging is associated with increased\npro-inflammatory signaling, which has been shown to induce\ninternalization or removal of AMPA receptors from synapses\n(Hara et al., 2012). Interestingly, in vivo lipopolysaccharide\n(LPS) endotoxin treatment in APOE-TR mice induces glial acti-\nvation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, accompanied\nby synaptic protein loss, with a greater response in APOE4-TR\nmice compared with APOE2- and APOE3-TR mice (Zhu et al.,\n2012). The role of apoE isoform-specific neuroinflammation\nin the observed early loss of AMPAR from spines is of future\ninterest.\n26 C 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nApoE isoform effects on dendritic spines\nThe observed negative effects of apoE4 and positive ef-\nfects of apoE2 on spines are consistent with their effects\non AD risk. With apoE4, maintenance of GluA2 at spines\nwas impaired, while the greatest density of GluA2-positive\nspines was observed with apoE2. Early loss of GluA2 from\nspines has several negative functional implications. Loss of\nAMPAR from spines may result in conversion of functional\nsynapses into silent, non-functional synapses (Lo and Erzu-\nrumlu, 2007). GluA2 also plays a critical role in maintaining\nthe biophysical properties of AMPAR, including reduction of\nAMPAR calcium permeability (Jonas et al., 1994; Geiger et al.,\nAMPAR can result in glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, long-\nterm depression and eventual loss of spines (Luthi et al., 1999;\nMary Jo LaDu, Evelyn Nwabuisi-Heath and Chunjiang Yu de-\nsigned the experiments.
