Conventional drug approaches have a low rate of success in alleviating those suffering\ninsomnia. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of acupuncture in the management of cancer-related\ninsomnia. Methods. A total of 12 databases were searched from their inception through January 2016 without language\nrestriction. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs were included if acupuncture was used as the sole\nintervention or as an adjunct to another standard treatment for any cancer-related insomnia. The data extraction and\nthe risk of bias assessments were performed by 2 independent reviewers. Results. Of the 90 studies screened, 6 RCTs\nwere included. The risk of bias was generally unclear or low. Three RCTs showed equivalent effects on the Pittsburgh\nSleep Quality Index and 2 RCTs showed the similar effects on response rate to those of conventional drugs at the end of\ntreatment. The other RCT showed acupuncture was better than hormone therapy in the numbers of hours slept each night\nand number of times woken up each night. The 3 weeks of follow-up in 2 RCTs showed superior effects of acupuncture\ncompared with conventional drugs, and a meta-analysis showed significant effects of acupuncture. Two RCTs tested the\neffects of acupuncture on cancer-related insomnia compared with sham acupuncture. One RCT showed favourable effects,\nwhile the other trial failed to do so. Conclusion. There is a low level of evidence that acupuncture may be superior to sham\nacupuncture, drugs or hormones therapy. However, the number of studies and effect size are small for clinical significance.\nFurther clinical trials are warranted.\n",

Approximately\n25% to 50% of patients with cancer-related insomnia are\ntreated with sedative-hypnotics drugs.6,7 However, cancer\npatients often face several problems and limitations from\nthe pharmacological treatments, including dizziness, resid-\nual daytime sedation, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and\nheadache.8,9 The use of complementary and alternative\nmedicine is common among cancer patients.10 In particular,\nclinical research has shown that acupuncture may provide\n1Clinical Research Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine,\nDaejeon, Republic of Korea\n2Division of Acupuncture & Moxibustion Medicine, Kyung Hee Korean\nMedicine Hospital, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea\n3Department of Nursing, Chodang University, Muan, Republic of Korea\nCorresponding Author:\nMyeong Soo Lee, Clinical Research Division, Korea Institute of Oriental\nof Korea.\nEmail: drmslee@gmail.com or mslee@kiom.re.kr\nAcupuncture for Managing\nCancer-Related Insomnia: A Systematic\nReview of Randomized Clinical Trials\nTae-Young Choi, PhD1, Jong In Kim, PhD, KMD2,\nHyun-Ja Lim, RN, PhD3, and Myeong Soo Lee, PhD1\n Keywords\nacupuncture, cancer, insomnia, sleep disturbance, systematic review\nclinical benefit in cancer patients compared with related\nsymptom control and supportive care.11 Acupuncture may\nhelp treat specific cancer-related symptoms, including pain,\ngastrointestinal side effects, hot flushes, fatigue, anxiety,\nThere are 3 systematic reviews related to the effects of\nacupuncture on insomnia.18-20 One review yielded mixed\nevidence,19 while the other Cochrane systematic review\nshowed that the acupuncture was not more effective than\nroutine care with noncancer-related insomnia patients.20 The\nthird review assessed the use of acupuncture in cancer care,\nincluding the treatment of insomnia.18 That review showed\nfavourable effects of acupuncture on sleep quality from 3\ntrials with a high risk of bias. However, that review included\nonly studies in English, one included trial was not relevant\nfor insomnia21 and the studies are outdated. There has been\nno current systematic review that evaluated the clinical evi-\ndence of acupuncture for cancer-related insomnia specifi-\ncally. The aims of this systematic review were to update,\ncomplete, and critically evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture\nin the management of cancer-related insomnia.\nMethods\nStudy Registration\nThe protocol for this systematic review was registered in\nthe Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews\nData Sources\nThe following databases were searched from inception\nthrough January 2016: PubMed, EMBASE, AMED, the\nCochrane Library, 7 Korean medical databases (Korean\nStudies Information, DBPIA, Oriental Medicine Advanced\nSearching Integrated System, Research Information Service\nSystem, KoreaMed, The Town Society of Science\nTechnology and the Korean National Assembly Library),\nand 1 Chinese medical database (China National Knowledge\nInfrastructure [CNKI]). The search terms included (acu-\npuncture OR electro-acupuncture OR meridian) AND (can-\ncer OR tumour OR neoplasms OR malignancy OR\ncarcinoma) AND (sleep disorder OR sleep disturbance OR\ninsomnia OR wakefulness OR waking) in Korean, Chinese,\nand English. In addition, the reference lists of all of the\nobtained studies were searched. Hard copies of all of the\narticles were obtained and read in full.\nTypes of Studies\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs were\nincluded in this systematic review. RCTs were included if\nacupuncture was used as the sole intervention or as an adjunct\nto another standard treatment for any cancer-related insomnia\nand if the control group received the same concomitant treat-\nments as the acupuncture group. We excluded case studies,\ncase series, qualitative studies, uncontrolled studies, and con-\ntrolled trials without randomization methods.\nTypes of Participants\nParticipants who were diagnosed with a sleep disorder due\nto interior-stirring by cancer regardless of gender and age\nwere included.\nTypes of Intervention\nWe included studies that evaluated any type of invasive acu-\npuncture. This included studies that used manual acupunc-\nture, electro-acupuncture and auricular (ear) acupuncture.\nTrials testing other forms acupuncture, such as acupressure,\ntranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, point injection,\nlaser irradiation, and cupping were excluded. Trials were\nincluded if acupuncture was used as the sole intervention or\nas an adjunct to another standard treatment for any insomnia\nin patients with cancer and if the control group received the\nsame concomitant treatments as the acupuncture group.\nTrials with designs that did not allow the effectiveness of\nacupuncture to be evaluated (eg, by using a treatment of\nunproven efficacy in the control group or by comparing 2\ndifferent forms of acupuncture) or included comparison\ntreatments/groups that were expected to have similar effects\nto acupuncture or herbal medicines were excluded.\nTypes of Outcomes\nPrimary Outcomes\n1. Response rate, defined as the proportion of partici-\npants who had significantly improved (judged by\nprimary studies' authors) based on parameters such\nas prolonged total sleep time, improved sleep effi-\nciency or sleep quality, or symptom relief by the pri-\nmary studies. These were subjective assessments of\noverall effectiveness and were reported by the par-\nticipants themselves.\n2. Scales or indices for sleep quality evaluation, for\nexample, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),\nInsomnia Severity Index (ISI), Athens Insomnia\nScale (ASI), were assessed.\n3. Sleep efficiency, which is the ratio of total sleep\ntime to time in bed, could be derived using either\nsubjective or objective approaches.\nSecondary Outcomes\n1. Sleep diary, measured by various subjective\napproaches. Sleep diary generally has several items\nfor reflecting a subjective assessment of each night's\nsleep, including time in bed at night, time woken up\nin the morning, number of hours slept during the\nnight, number of awakenings, and total time awake\nduring the night, total time spent in bed, sleep effi-\nciency, and sleep quality or satisfaction.\n2. Adverse effects, reported in the studies or measured\nusing validated scales.\nSelection of Studies and Data Extraction\nOne author searched the database and screened potentially\neligible studies after reading the title and abstract of the\nidentified studies. After the initial screening, which\nincluded checking titles and abstracts, a more thorough\ninvestigation was performed using the full-text of each\narticle. All articles were read by 2 independent reviewers\n(TYC and JIK) who extracted data according to pre-\ndefined criteria. Information such as the participants,\ninterventions, outcomes, and results were obtained from\neach study. For the extraction of intervention-related\ninformation, the revised STandards for Reporting\nInterventions in Clinical Trials ofAcupuncture (STRICTA)\nitems were used to describe the details of the acupuncture\ntreatments used in the study context.23\nRisk of Bias Assessment\nTwo authors (TYC and JIK) independently extracted the\ndata from the included trials. The Cochrane risk of bias\ntool was used to assess the internal validity of each\nstudy.24 The following characteristics were assessed: (1)\nWas the allocation sequence adequately generated? (2)\nWas the allocation adequately concealed? (3) Was knowl-\nedge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented\nduring the study? (4) Were incomplete outcome data\nadequately addressed? (5) Were the study reports free of\nthe suggestion of selective outcome reporting? (6) Was\nthe study free of other problems that could introduce a\nrisk of bias? This review used \"L,\" \"U,\" and \"H\" as keys\nfor these judgements, where \"Low\" (L) indicated a low\nrisk of bias, \"Unclear\" (U) indicated that the risk of bias\nwas uncertain, and \"High\" (H) indicated a high risk of\nbias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between\nall of the authors.\nData Analysis\nRelative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were\nassessed for the effect size of each included study. All\nstatistical analyses were conducted using the Cochrane\nCollaboration's software program, Review Manager\n(RevMan), Version 5.3.0 for Windows (Copenhagen, The\nNordic Cochrane Center). For studies with insufficient infor-\nmation, we contacted the primary authors to acquire and ver-\nify data when possible. Differences between the intervention\nand control groups were assessed. For dichotomous data, we\npresent the treatment effect as relative risk with 95% confi-\ndence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we used the mean\ndifference (MD) with 95% CIs to measure the treatment\neffect. In the case of outcome variables with different scales,\nwe used the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95%\nCIs. The chi-square test for heterogeneity and the I2 test were\nused to evaluate the heterogeneity of the included studies,\nwhere I2 values of 50% or more were considered to be indica-\ntors of a substantial level of heterogeneity.25 The missing data\nwere not imputed from the outcome measures. When possi-\nble, we assessed publication bias using a funnel plot.\nHowever, the small number of trials prevented the assess-\nment of publication bias.\nResults\nDescription of Studies\nOur searches generated 90 hits, and 6 RCTs met our inclu-\nsion criteria (Figure 1). The key data from all of the\npatients were included in the analyses. Sample sizes ranged\nand 1 trial was from the United States.27 The included\npatients had various types and stages of cancer. The acu-\npuncture style, number of sessions, and duration of treat-\nment varied across the included studies. Four of the trials\n(Baihui), HT7 (Shenmen), SP6 (Sanyinjiao), and PC6\n(Neiguan) (Table 2). The total number of treatment ses-\nsions ranged from 7 to 30. The backgrounds of the practi-\nmeasures included an increase in the PSQI and a reduction\nin symptoms (insomnia).\nRisk of Bias\nThe details of the risk of bias (ROB) assessment in 6 RCTs\nregard to adequate sequence generation, whereas 2 RCTs26,28\nROB with respect to allocation concealment using sealed\nenvelopes. All trials not reported outcome assessor blind-\ning. Only 2 RCTs26,27 compared acupuncture with sham\nacupuncture, and another 4 RCTs had a high ROB in par-\nticipant and personnel blinding because of the nature of the\ntreatment. All 6 RCTs had low ROBs with incomplete out-\ncome data. Only 1 trial27 had published protocols, and all\nexcept 1 RCT was rated unclear in selective reporting of\noutcomes. All trials reported the patients' baseline charac-\nteristics, and all of the RCTs had a low ROB based on other\nsources of bias.\nOutcomes Measurements\nAcupuncture Versus Sham Acupuncture.Two RCTs com-\npared the effects of acupuncture with sham acupuncture and\nno-treatment or a wait-list group in breast cancer patients\n(Table 3).26,27 One RCT that used a logbook for night sleep\ndisturbance26 showed favorable effects of acupuncture,\nwhereas the other RCT failed to show beneficial effects of\nelectro-acupuncture on sleep quality score based on PSQI.27\nAcupuncture Versus Conventional Drug.Three RCTs com-\npared the effects of acupuncture to those of conventional\ndrugs based on PSQI and response rate (Table 3).28-30 Three\nRCTs compared the effects of acupuncture on PSQI. One\nRCT showed favorable effects of acupuncture on PSQI\nafter 1 week of treatment (7 daily times) compared with\nconventional drugs,29 whereas the other study failed to do\nso.28 The meta-analysis showed no significant difference\nbetween acupuncture and drug therapy (n = 175, MD,\nneity (I2 = 73%, Figure 3A).

The totality of the\nevidence from acupuncture RCTs for managing cancer-\nrelated insomnia is mixed according to the type of cancer\nand the acupuncture and treatment regimens. Our review\nsuggested some possible positive or equivalent benefits of\nacupuncture compared with conventional drug therapy or\nhormone therapy. Compared with sham acupuncture, one\ntrial showed specific effects of acupuncture, whereas\nanother trial failed to do so. The level of evidence was low\nin general. Furthermore, the number of trials and total\nFigure 3.

AT: acupuncture; PSQI: Pittsburgh sleep\nquality index.\nsample size included in our analysis were not sufficient to\ndraw firm conclusions.\nOur review has several important limitations. First, our\nstudy cannot avoid publication bias or location bias. The\ndistorting effects of these biases on systematic reviews are\nwell documented.32,33 Second, we searched a large number\nof databases without publication language restrictions. We\nare confident that our search strategies located all relevant\ndata, although some degree of uncertainty remains. Half of\nthe included RCTs were from China, and the generalization\nof the results to other countries might be limited. Further\nlimitations include the paucity and the often suboptimal\nmethodological quality of the primary data. Finally, the\nnature of all reported outcome are subjective measures and\nthese prone to be potential bias of measurement. In total,\nthese facts considerably limit the conclusiveness of this sys-\ntematic review.\nCompared with a previous review,18 we identified 4 new\nRCTs26-29 and successfully updated the evidence. The previ-\nous review reported positive outcomes of included trials\nwith concern about a high risk of bias. The newly added\ntrials suggest more positive effects of acupuncture on can-\ncer-related insomnia than the previous review. The results\nof systematic review of acupuncture for cancer-related\ninsomnia are different from those of noncancer-related\ninsomnia. Two previous systematic reviews for noncancer-\nrelated insomnia showed mixed effects according to type of\nacupuncture and control groups, including high risk of bias\nstudies.19,20 Our review showed that the effects of acupunc-\nture are equivalent with conventional drugs at the end of\ntreatment, but superior effects at 3 weeks'follow-up in both\nPSQI and response rate.28,29 This might suggest that the\neffects of acupuncture are sustainable, while the effects of\nconventional drugs decline immediately after treatment.\nThen acupuncture could obtain a better outcome during\ntreatment follow-up than immediately after treatment com-\npared with conventional drug therapies.\nMost of the included studies had an unclear or low risk\nof bias across the domains. Two RCTs did not report the\nrandom sequence generation methods.26,30 Only 3 used\nblinding.26,27 Because of the nature of the intervention,\npractitioner blinding cannot be achieved. Trials with inad-\nequate blinding or inadequate allocation concealment may\nbe subject to selection bias and would therefore be likely\nto generate exaggerated treatment effects. Failure to fol-\nlow reporting guidelines, including the CONSORT\n(Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials)34 or\nSTRICTA guidelines23 prevented the reader from properly\nevaluating the trials. Collective efforts for increasing\nadherence to the CONSORT statement and STRICTA\nguidelines during the design, implementation, and report-\ning of clinical trials are needed to improve the complete-\nness of reporting in acupuncture RCTs.\nTwo sham acupuncture methods were used for testing\nthe efficacy of acupuncture for cancer-related insomnia,\nincluding superficial penetrating needles at nonacupuncture\npoints and nonpenetrating needles at nonacupuncture\npoints. One trial showed favorable effects of manual acu-\npuncture compared with penetrating needling at nonacu-\npuncture points for cancer-related insomnia,26 but another\ntrial failed to show superior effects of electro-acupuncture\ncompared with the use of nonpenetrating needles at nonacu-\npuncture points.27 This finding may suggest the possibility\nof noninertness of sham acupuncture, which is different\nfrom placebo effects of conventional drugs. However, the\nsuperiority of acupuncture compared with conventional\ndrugs allows the possible interpretation of specific effects\nof acupuncture for this condition.\nThere are several possible interpretations of the results\nof this systematic review. The treatment might not have\nbeen administered optimally in the included trials. The\nstudies may have been inadequately designed or the acu-\npuncture treatments might exhibit nonspecific effects. For\ninstance, the number of treatment sessions could have\nbeen too small to generate a significant effect, treatment\ncould have been suboptimal, or the protocol applied in the\nacupuncture group might not have been suitable for treat-\ning cancer-related insomnia. In the included trials, the\neffects were more positive in the trials with more frequent\ntreatment times (total or time duration).30 There was also\nthe possibility of revealing the effects of acupuncture in the\nfollow-up stages than in the final treatment.28,29 Both the\noptimum dose and the ideal time or type of acupuncture\nfor various cancer patients are currently unknown. No\nclinical trials investigating dosages and treatment regi-\nmens have yet been published.\nThere are also other issues regarding the use of acupunc-\nture for cancer-related insomnia that should be discussed\nfurther. Because cancer-related insomnia may develop in\nthe setting of a highly heterogeneous cancer with a different\netiology and severity, acupuncture is likely to have different\neffects on different subgroups of patients. Therefore, future\nclinical trials should be focused on a particular subgroup\nand should include a very large sample size to delineate the\neffects of acupuncture on patients with different cancer\ntypes. Some of the included RCTs showed equivalent or\nsuperior effects of acupuncture compared with conven-\ntional drugs or hormone therapy.28-31 The effect size of the\nincluded trials was not large enough to be clinically mean-\ningful. The treatment duration of the included trials might\nnot have been sufficiently long to demonstrate complete\neffects on sleep quality improvement because although acu-\npuncture is effective, the effects can be quite slow to\ndevelop. If the treatment period is sufficient, it is possible to\nobtain different results.\nAlthough acupuncture in general appears to be safe, one\nimportant question is the safety of acupuncture for cancer\npatients. Adverse events were noted in three of the included\ntrials but they were negligible compared with drug-related\nadverse events.26,29,31 Further studies (prospective and retro-\nspective) on the safety of acupuncture for cancer patients\nare required.\nOne could question the minimum clinical trial guide for\nfuture research in this area. Future acupuncture RCTs on\ncancer-related insomnia should adhere to accepted stan-\ndards of trial methodology. Trials should have sufficiently\nlarge study populations based on power calculations from\nappropriate pilot studies and should also perform the fol-\nlowing actions: consider the optimal doses, including inter-\nvention duration and frequency; describe all aspects of the\nmethodology in full detail to ensure reproducibility; use\nvalidated primary outcome measures, including subjective\nand objective outcome (actigraphy or polysomnography);\nand employ adequate statistical tests. Trials should also\nevaluate the quality of sleep and the effects on quality of life\nand should also report the number of participants who with-\ndraw from the intervention in each arm and their reasons for\ndoing so.\nIn conclusion, the current trials showed that acupuncture\nmay be superior to sham acupuncture, conventional drug\ntherapy and hormone therapy for the management of can-\ncer-related insomnia. However, the level of evidence is low,\nthe small effect size reduces clinical significance and the\nsmall number of rigorous studies prevents us from drawing\nfirm conclusions. Future well-conducted RCTs are needed\nto determine whether acupuncture can be a viable option for\nthe treatment of cancer-related insomnia.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nstudy was supported by a grant from the Korea Institute of Oriental\nReferences\n1.
