Strong as-\nsociations emerged between specific disorders and classes\nof medications with evidence for efficacy. Antidepres-\nsants were most frequently used among those with\nprimary mood disorders (14.1%); stimulant use was\nmost common among those with attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder (20.4%); and antipsychotic use was\ninfrequent and mostly seen among those with serious de-\nvelopmental disorders. Less than 2.5% of adolescents with-\nout a 12-month mental disorder had been prescribed psy-\nchotropic medications, and most had evidence of\npsychological distress or impairment reflected in a pre-\nvious mental disorder, subthreshold condition, or de-\nvelopmental disorder.

In the present study, we examine\nmedicationoveruse,definedasprescriptionstoyouthwith-\noutdisorders,andmisuse,definedasprescriptionstoyouth\nfor conditions for which they are not indicated. Even\nthough there is still insufficient evidence to establish clini-\ncal practice guidelines for all child and adolescent mental\ndisorders,21 a growing body of well-controlled clinical trial\ndata can be used to establish medication treatment guide-\nlines for several specific disorders including ADHD,15,22-25\nety,32,33 conduct disorder and other behavior disor-\nders,34,35 obsessive-compulsive disorder,36 and autism spec-\ntrum and developmental disorders.37\nThis article reports on patterns of psychotropic medi-\ncationuseamongyouthwithspecificmentaldisordersdur-\ning the past year in data from the National Comorbidity\nSurvey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), a nationally rep-\nresentative sample of US adolescents based on direct in-\nterviews. The aims of this study were to (1) present em-\npirical data on psychotropic medication use among youth\nwith specific mental disorders who received mental health\nservices; (2) assess the association between specific pri-\nmary disorders and the use of medications that are indi-\ncated for that disorder; and (3) examine sociodemo-\ngraphic and clinical correlates of specific classes of\nmedication among youth with specific mental disorders.\nThese results were used to examine the extent of medi-\ncation overuse and misuse in US adolescents.\nMETHODS\nThe NCS-A is a nationally representative survey of 10 123 ado-\nlescents aged 13 to 18 years in the continental United States con-\nground, measures, design, and clinical validity of the NCS-A are\ndescribed elsewhere.40,41 The survey was based on a dual-frame\ndesign that included a household sample (n=879 adolescents;\nrate 74.7%). Adolescents were directly interviewed by profes-\nsional interviewers coordinated by the Institute for Social Re-\nsearch at the University of Michigan. Parents (or surrogates) were\nmailed a self-administered questionnaire that included informa-\ntion on adolescent sociodemographic characteristics, develop-\nmental background, mental and physical health, and service use.\nThe parent self-administered questionnaire was completed by\n6483 parents, yielding an overall conditional response rate of\n83.3%. The recruitment and consent procedures were ap-\nproved by the human subjects committees of both Harvard Medi-\ncal School and the University of Michigan.\nMEASURES\nSociodemographic Characteristics\nThe sample was weighted to provide a nationally representa-\ntive sample of households and schools based on the most re-\ncent US census. Sociodemographic variables assessed in the\nNCS-A include respondent age in years, sex, race/ethnicity, par-\nent education, parental marital status, urbanicity, region, and\nfamily income. Approximately one-half of the sample was male\nwas predominantly non-Hispanic white (65.6%). A great ma-\njority (84.5%) of the adolescents had parents who had com-\npleted at least high school, and more than three-fourths (78.6%)\nof the sample lived with currently married or cohabiting par-\nents. A relatively small proportion (14.9%) of adolescents lived\nin rural areas, and 18.1% of adolescents lived in the Northeast\nin the West. The poverty index ratio was calculated as the ra-\ntio of family income divided by the poverty line based on fam-\nily size; 14.7% of the adolescents resided in poor families (1.5\ntimes poverty index ratio).\nDiagnostic Assessment\nAdolescents were administered a modified version of the World\nHealth Organization Composite International Diagnostic In-\nterview version 3.0, a fully structured interview administered\nby trained lay interviewers.41 Computerized algorithms were\ndeveloped to generate Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-\ntal Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) diagnoses. Major classes\nof past-year disorders assessed in the Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview included mood disorders, anxiety disor-\nders, eating disorders, behavior disorders, and substance use\ndisorders. Severity of disorders based on the presence of sub-\njective distress and impairment was also assessed. A parent com-\npleted a developmental and health history that included nu-\nmerous medical conditions, developmental disorders, and\nlearning disabilities, as well as the criteria for ADHD and be-\nhavior disorders. A hierarchical classification of disorders was\nalso established to characterize those youth with multiple dis-\norders.42 Adolescents with multiple disorders were assigned to\nthe highest-ordered diagnostic category (ie, primary disor-\nder). Adolescents were also asked about their parents' symp-\ntoms and treatment for mental disorders in a separate section\nof the interview. Diagnostic procedures are described in more\nMental Health Service Use\nA separate interview module was administered to both the ado-\nlescents and parents that collected information on service use\nfor emotional behavior disorders during the past 12 months.\nSpecific sectors included mental health specialty outpatient\n(community mental health center, partial hospitalization or day\ntreatment program, or drug or alcohol clinic) with a mental\nhealth professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker,\nor family counselor) or inpatient care visits (overnight hospi-\ntalization or emergency department visits), general medical vis-\nits (pediatrician or family physician), and services from other\nsectors (human services, school services, complementary and\nalternative medicine, and juvenile justice).\nPsychotropic Medication Use\nRespondents' past-year psychotropic medication use for be-\nhavioral or emotional problems was assessed at the direct in-\nterview through a list of 215 generic and proprietary names of\ncommonly used psychotropic medications. The specific names\nof medications were checked from the actual prescription bottles\nby the interviewer, when available. Psychotropic medications\nwere divided into broad classes (antidepressants, stimulants,\nanxiolytics, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics). Use of these\nmedications for nonpsychiatric indications was not included\nin these analyses.\n\u00a92013 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nThe data were weighted to adjust for the differential probability\nof selection of respondents within the school and household\nsamples, differential nonresponse, and residual differences be-\ntween the sample and the US population and the full NCS-A\nsample on the cross-classification of sociodemographic vari-\nables.40,41 Cross-tabulations were used to calculate the preva-\nlence of each of the major classes of psychotropic medications\namong adolescents with 12-month mental disorders, classes of\nmental disorder, the number of classes of disorder, suicidality,\nand a series of neurological or neurodevelopmental disorders.\nLogistic regression analyses were used to examine sociodemo-\ngraphic and clinical correlates of use of common classes of psy-\nchotropic drug within each disorder and disorder class. Models\nsimultaneously adjusted for adolescent demographics and par-\nent characteristics. Results were adjusted for design effects using\nthe Taylor series method in SUDAAN version 10 (RTI Interna-\ntional). Statistical significance was based on 2-sided design-\nbased tests evaluated at a .05 level of significance.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents the prevalence of psychotropic medi-\ncation use among youth with each of the DSM disor-\nTable 1.

A\ntotal of 24.9% of youth had received mental health ser-\nvices during the past 12 months, with significant vari-\nability by DSM disorders.9\nAmong those with any DSM-IV mental disorder, 14.2%\nreported that they had been treated with a psychotropic\nmedication. Adolescents with ADHD had the highest\nprevalence of medication use (31.0%) followed by those\nbehavior disorders (19.3%), substance use disorders\nof use of antipsychotic medications (1.0%), mood stabi-\nlizers (0.7%), and anxiolytics (1.3%) among those with\na mental disorder were very low. The highest rates of psy-\nchotropic medication use were observed among those with\na developmental disorder/autism (42.0%) or self-\nreported suicidality (27.1%). There was a direct in-\ncrease in the proportions of youth with medication use\nby the number of classes of disorders, with rates of 9.5%,\norders, respectively. Only 2.5% of adolescents without a\n12-month DSM-IV disorder had been prescribed psycho-\ntropic medications. Of these, 78% had evidence of psy-\nchological distress or impairment reflected in a lifetime\nhistory of mental disorders, subthreshold conditions, or\ndevelopmental disorders (data not shown). Not shown\nhere, 26.9% (SE = 0.8) of youth had also taken nonpsy-\nchotropic prescribed medications during the past 7 days.\nTable 2 presents the prevalence rates of past-year use\nof the 3 major classes of psychotropic medications among\nparticipants with primary diagnoses classified hierarchi-\ncally to control for comorbidity among the past-year dis-\norders reported in Table 1. Antidepressants were most\nfrequently used among those with a primary mood dis-\nlowed by those with a primary anxiety disorder (4.5%).\nOnly 1.3% of those with no 12-month DSM-IV disorder\nreported antidepressant use during the past year.\nStimulant use was most common among those with\nADHD (20.4%). A small proportion of youth with a be-\nhavior disorder without ADHD had received stimulants\n(6.6%), and only 0.8% of those without a DSM-IV disor-\nder reported stimulant use. Very small proportions of those\nwith DSM-IV disorders or other neuropsychiatric disor-\nders reported antipsychotic prescription use. Two per-\ncent of those with a developmental disorder or learning\ndisability, 1.7% of those with bipolar disorder, and 1.8%\nof those with a behavior disorder reported antipsychotic\nuse during the past 12 months. Only 0.1% of those with-\nout a disorder reported antipsychotic prescriptions.\nSociodemographic and clinical correlates of the major\nclasses of psychotropic medication use among youth with\nthe primary target disorders are presented in Table 3.\nWhen simultaneously controlling for adolescent and par-\nent demographic characteristics and number of classes\nof disorder, the rates of psychotropic medication use de-\ncreased with age among those with all 3 sets of indi-\ncated disorders, particularly for stimulants among those\nwith ADHD. Both groups of older adolescents had sig-\nnificantly lower rates of stimulant use than those in the\nearly adolescent age group (ages 13-14 years). There were\nsignificantly lower prevalence rates of psychotropic medi-\ncation use among ethnic minority youth than among white\nyouth with any of the 3 disorders and primary medica-\ntion classes. Similarly, ethnic minority youth with ADHD\ntended to use fewer stimulants than white youth with\nADHD. Antidepressant use among those with depres-\nsion was more common among females than males,\nwhereas males with ADHD were more likely to receive\nstimulants than females. Family income was inversely as-\nsociated with antidepressant use. Adolescents whose par-\nents had not completed high school reported more stimu-\nlant use than those with higher parental education levels.\nSeverity and suicidality were significantly associated\nwith greater rates of antidepressant medication use, and\nthose with more severe bipolar disorder or neurodevel-\nopmental disorders had greater rates of antipsychotic use.\nThe association between specific disorders and indi-\ncated classes of medication was significantly lower for\nthe general medical or other treatment sectors than the\nmental health specialty sector for all 3 classes of medi-\ncations. Approximately 25% of antidepressant prescrip-\ntions among youth with a major mood disorder oc-\ncurred in the mental health sector compared with 11.5%\nin general medicine and 0.3% in other sectors. Stimu-\nlants among those with ADHD were prescribed signifi-\ncantly more often by a mental health specialist (32.7%)\nthan by a clinician in the general medical sector (21.1%)\nor other treatment sectors (3.8%). Similarly, 4.5% of an-\ntipsychotic medications were prescribed to those with in-\ndicated conditions by a mental health specialist com-\nTable 2.

The results chal-\nlenge recent concerns over widespread overmedication\nand misuse of prescribed psychotropic medications in US\nadolescents.2-4 Therewasnocompellingevidenceforeither\nmisuse or overuse of psychotropic medications. Only\n14.2% of youth with a mental disorder during the past\nyear reported psychotropic use, and the majority who had\nbeen prescribed medications, particularly those who re-\nceived treatment in specialty mental health settings, had\na mental disorder with severe consequences and impair-\nment, functional impairment, suicidality, or associated\nbehavioral and developmental difficulties. When neu-\nrodevelopmental disorders, lifetime history, and sub-\nthreshold conditions are considered, there are few youths\nTable 3.

The match between specific disorders and indi-\ncated medications should also diminish criticism of medi-\ncation misuse.\nWe also found little evidence to support claims of prac-\ntitioner overuse of medications in US adolescents. The ma-\njority of the pharmacologically treated youth without a re-\ncent disorder had evidence of psychological distress or\nimpairment reflected in a previous mental disorder, sub-\nthreshold condition, or neurodevelopmental disorder. If\ndiagnostic information were available regarding schizo-\nphrenia and related psychotic disorders and obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, it is likely that an even smaller per-\ncentage of adolescents would be found to have no objective\nmental health need for psychotropic treatment.\nThe efficacy of antidepressants for adolescent major\ndepressive disorder is supported by both clinical trials\nandmeta-analyses.43 Depressedadolescentsaremorelikely\nto respond to an antidepressant medication than to cog-\nnitive behavioral therapy,44 the psychotherapy with the\nstrongest empirical evidence.45 Consistent with epide-\nmiological studies of major depressive disorder in adults,20\nhowever, only a small minority of adolescents with a de-\npressive disorder were treated with antidepressants. Treat-\nment with antidepressants was strongly related to the pres-\nence of serious signs of depression, such as suicidality,\nand severe impairment or distress. This suggests that an-\ntidepressant use tends to be concentrated among those\nyoung people with the greatest clinical need.\nAcross all of the disorders, ADHD was the condition\nmost likely to be treated with psychotropic medication,\nespecially stimulants. However, despite unequivocal ex-\nperimental evidence of efficacy,23 a substantial majority\nof adolescents with ADHD did not receive stimulants in\nthe past year. Even among those who were treated in the\nspecialty mental health sector, only about one-third of\nadolescents with ADHD received stimulants. Similar re-\nsults have been reported from research with youth un-\nSchool-based services play a large role in the delivery\nof mental health care to young people with ADHD.9,47 Be-\ncause symptoms of ADHD are often contextually driven\nand become particularly evident in high-demand set-\ntings, such as the classroom, teachers are well posi-\ntioned to assess treatment response.15 In the present study,\nhowever, adolescents with ADHD who received mental\nhealth care in schools or other settings outside of the spe-\ncialty and general medical sectors were significantly less\nlikely to receive stimulant medications. Inadequate men-\ntal health assessments, concerns over parental re-\nsponses to a referral for medication evaluation, and philo-\nsophical differences concerning the appropriate roles of\npsychosocial and pharmacological treatments may con-\ntribute to the low rate of stimulant use outside of the spe-\ncialty mental health and general medical sectors.\nTable 3.

Youth with neurodevelopmental\ndisorders and bipolar disorder had the highest rates of\nantipsychotic use, followed by a very small proportion\nof adolescents with ADHD or disruptive behavior\ndisorders. Clinical trials support a role for second-\ngeneration antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar\ndisorder in youths and irritability, including aggressive\nand self-injurious behavior, associated with autistic dis-\norder.28,48 Without information concerning schizophre-\nnia and related psychotic disorders and symptoms or\nthe clinical intent of the psychotropic prescribing, how-\never, it is difficult to evaluate the appropriateness of\nthese prescribing practices. Nevertheless, increasing\nrates of antipsychotic treatment of young people49 and\ncommon adverse metabolic effects50 contribute to con-\ncerns over antipsychotic prescribing patterns to young\nThis study advances knowledge on the patterns of psy-\nchotropic medication use in a nationally representative\nsample of adolescents with well-characterized DSM-IV\nmental disorders and clinical correlates. Previous esti-\nmates of psychotropic medication use from pharmacy and\ninsurancestatisticsarenotbasedonrepresentativesamples\nof the population nor do they include comprehensive as-\nsessment of current mental disorders. Limitations of the\npresent study include the lack of information on health\ninsurance that may influence treatment options and the\ntiming of the data collection that was completed in 2004\nthat may not represent current prescribing practices. How-\never, this concern is offset by the close approximation\nof the rates of antidepressant treatment52 and medica-\ntion use among those in treatment for ADHD16 in our\nstudy with those in a more recent national survey and\nthe finding from pharmacologic and services databases\nthat the use of most psychotropic medications peaked\naround the study period.53-55 Finally, because our study\nwas restricted to adolescents, we cannot address recent\nconcerns of psychotropic medication use among chil-\ndren under age 12 years.\nA substantial proportion of youth with mental disor-\nders receive services, although relatively few are treated\nin the specialty mental health service sector.9 The sig-\nnificant difference in appropriate medication use be-\ntween the mental health specialty and other treatment\nsectors suggests that mental disorders are underrecog-\nnized in the general medical sector and that appropriate\npsychotropic medications are underprescribed. Prob-\nlems with access to the specialty mental health sector pose\nan enduring challenge to program planners and policy\nmakers. Mental health care of young people within\nschools, juvenile justice, and primary care settings is of-\nten inaccessible, fragmented, and of uneven quality.56,57\nMany regions of the country have only limited access to\nchild and adolescent psychiatrists58,59 and few nonspe-\ncialists have sufficient knowledge and experience in the\nfull range of effective treatments. Progress in delivering\nevidence-based treatments to a larger share of adoles-\ncents with common mental disorders will likely require\ncoordinated interventions at the patient, parent, clini-\ncian, and health care system levels.\nCorrespondence: Kathleen R.
