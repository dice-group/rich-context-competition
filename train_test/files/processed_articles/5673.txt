In the\nUnited States, over 5000 new individuals begin misusing\nprescription opioids and more than 100 die from opioid-\nrelated overdose every day (Bohnert et al., 2011).\nFurthermore, drug overdose is now the leading cause of\ninjury deaths among US adults, with those resulting from\nopioid overdose exceeding the death rates from all other\nillicit drugs combined (Chen et al., 2014). The CDC has\ndeclared opioid abuse and diversion a public health crisis of\nepidemic proportions (CDC, 2011). There are many estab-\nlished definitions used to describe problematic opioid (and\nother substance) use including abuse, dependence, addic-\ntion, disorder, misuse, and non-medical or extra-medical\nuse. The authors refer to the National Institute on Drug\nAbuse (NIDA) definition when discussing opioid abuse in\nthis article. NIDA defines prescription opioid drug abuse as\nany \"non-medical use\" or use different than the exact regi-\nmen in which it was prescribed (e.g. in higher doses or\nincreased frequency, using opioid medications that were\nnot prescribed to you) or for reasons other than why it was\nprescribed (e.g. to get high, to self-medicate psychiatric\nsymptoms) (Alford and Livingston, 2013).\nIndividuals with chronic pain compose a large popula-\ntion at considerable risk of abusing prescription opioids\ngiven the likelihood that they would be prescribed this class\nof medication for pain management. More than 80\npercent\nof all physician consults in the United States are pain related,\nand nearly one-third of all Americans suffer from chronic\nSalovey, 1992). Data from the CDC suggest that\napproximately 40percent of the over 100million individuals\nDevelopment and preliminary validation\nof the Opioid Abuse Risk Screener\nPatricia Henrie-Barrus1,*, Lynnette A Averill2,3,*,\nRichard R Sudweeks4, Christopher L Averill2,3\nand Natalie Mota5\n Keywords\nopioid abuse, pain, risk stratification, scale, validation\n1The University of Utah, USA\n2Yale University, USA\n3VA Connecticut Healthcare System, USA\n4Brigham Young University, USA\n5The University of Winnipeg, Canada\n*Both the authors contributed equally for this article\nCorresponding author:\nLynnette A Averill, Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine,\nEmail: lynnette.averill@yale.edu\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nin the United States with chronic pain will actively seek\nmedical help for pain symptoms, and although prevalence\nrates may vary across population and clinic settings, as\nmany as 20percent of these people will become addicted to\nopioid analgesics during treatment (CDC, 2012a). Each\nyear, insurers pay more than 72.5\nbillion dollars to cover\ndirect healthcare costs necessitated by the abuse of prescrip-\nthis the estimated 53\nbillion in economic costs, the total\nannual societal burden is conservatively at US$125\nbillion\n(CDC, 2012b). These figures do not take into account the\nmany individual, interpersonal, and relational costs often\nassociated with prescription opioid abuse.\nIn an effort to mitigate the opioid crisis, the Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA) now mandates compliance to\nthe strict standards of their risk evaluation and mitigation\nstrategy (REMS) for opioid analgesics, which requires\ncomprehensive screening and documentation of assessment\n(U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 2012). The\nAmerican Pain Society (APS) and American Academy of\nPain Medicine (AAPM) have developed evidence-based\npractice guidelines for opioid therapy (Chou et al., 2009a,\nAPS/AAPM guidelines is for careful patient selection and\nrisk stratification (Chou et al., 2009b). These guidelines, as\nwell as those developed by the US Department of Veterans\nAffairs/Department of Defense (Department of Veterans\nAffairs and Department of Defense (VA/DoD), 2010) and\nby other countries, highlight the need for comprehensive\nscreening and suggest that proper patient selection can min-\nimize potential risks and increase potential benefits of opi-\noid analgesics in the treatment of chronic pain (Graziotti\nAppropriate and effective screening and risk stratifica-\ntion as part of a comprehensive evaluation can help to\nlower the rates of opioid abuse, overdose, and death by\nproviding useful risk information. This can further aid in\nreduced incidence of inaccurate or missed diagnoses, pro-\nvide evidence to support appropriate monitoring, and\nreduce rates of doctor shopping and diversion.\nComprehensive screening and risk stratification are asso-\nciated with decreased costs for patients, providers, and\ninsurers as those prescribing are able to make increasingly\nwell-informed decisions when treatment-planning regard-\ning what to prescribe and how to best monitor patients for\nsafety based on individual risk profiles.\nDespite FDA requirements, practice guidelines, and\nstaggering prevalence rates of abuse and overdose, many\npractitioners are not formally screening for risk, either at\nthe time of initial evaluation and prescribing nor at follow-\nup visits or are screening patients solely depending on\ntheir \"gut\" or instinct about risk level (Michna et al., 2007;\nWasan et al., 2005). In addition, it is suggested that many\nphysicians prescribing opioid pain medications have very\nlittle training in aberrant drug-related behavior and sub-\nstance abuse; thus, they may have limitations in their abil-\nity to effectively and accurately assess risk (Chou et al.,\net al., 2005). Research suggests even the best trained pre-\nscribers are not always successful in accurately screening\nfor risk (Wasan et al., 2005) and all too often patients are\nbeing prescribed opioids without their prescriber having a\nclear and well-informed idea of their level of risk of abuse\nfound that prescribers estimated only 13.9percent of their\npatients demonstrate aberrant behaviors (ABs), yet 50per-\ncent of those prescribed opioids had positive urine toxicol-\nogy screens for illicit drugs and 8.7percent had no opioids\nin their urine at all. There is a clear need for improved\nscreening that provides comprehensive and accurate evi-\ndence of opioid risk stratification, especially as many\ninsurance companies are recommending that risk assess-\nments be given to provide evidence for a coverage deter-\nmination of medical necessity for urine drug screening\nThere are several validated measures designed to assess\nrisk of misusing opioids including the Opioid Risk Tool\n(ORT; Webster and Webster, 2005), Attitudes and\nBehaviors Questionnaire (Passik et al., 2000), and the\nScreener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain\u00ad\nmeasures provide useful information and insights into\npotential risk of abuse, yet are relatively limited in scope\nregarding biopsychosocial risk including psychiatric vari-\nables and history of AB. Furthermore, there is concern that\nsome measures may overestimate risk (Moore et al., 2009)\nand although it is likely better to over-estimate rather than\nunder-estimate risk in these circumstances, this potential\noverestimation translates directly to the pain management\noptions an individual may be given and may limit opioid\nmedications that provide effective reductions in pain. Of\nimportant note, the authors do not believe that any assess-\nment measure should, in and of itself, be used to determine\npain management options or to deny opioid medications.\nRather risk assessments should be used in tandem with a\nclinical assessment, review of medical records, and other\navailable collateral information to develop a well-informed\nand comprehensive patient profile.\nStrong evidence connects a variety of psychiatric and\nbiopsychosocial variables to increase the risk of opioid\nabuse in individuals with chronic pain (Alford and\nments have been developed to adequately evaluate these\noften co-occurring and sometimes mutually exacerbating\nfactors. In order to address the limitations with current risk\nscreeners, the Opioid Abuse Risk Screener (OARS) was\nHenrie-Barrus et al. 3\ndeveloped as a comprehensive self-administered measure\nof opioid abuse that includes a wide range of critical ele-\nments noted in the literature to be relevant to opioid risk\n(e.g. depressive and anxiety symptoms, exposure to trauma/\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, history of\nabuse/neglect, history of substance abuse, tobacco use, and\nimpulsivity). As noted above, the OARS is not intended to\nassess and stratify risk of developing substance use disor-\nder based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders\u00adFifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria specifically, but\nrather to assess risk of opioid abuse more broadly including\nself-medication of psychiatric symptoms, diversion and\nother AB, and recreational use. These behaviors can, of\ncourse, lead to the development of a substance use disorder,\nas defined by the DSM-5, if left untreated.\nThe OARS is a brief, yet comprehensive screening\nmeasure grounded in the evidence regarding risk factors for\nopioid abuse that meets and surpasses clinical practice\nguidelines for effective risk stratification. This article\ndescribes the creation of the OARS in three steps: (1) the\ncreation, refinement, and preliminary modeling of the item\npool to an anonymous sample; (2) testing the refined items\nin a new sample, establishing preliminary concurrent valid-\nity by comparing the measure to a validated opioid risk\nmeasure; and (3) testing a revised item set and determining\nthe factor structure in a larger, clinical sample. Each step is\npresented followed by a brief discussion of areas for future\ndevelopment and research. All studies presented in this arti-\ncle were conducted with the approval of the University of\nUtah Institutional Review Board.\nMethods\nStudy 1: item development\nExpert consensus group.A group of clinical professionals\nexperienced in working with pain patients consulted with\nthe authors throughout item development and the other\nstages of study described in this article. The group com-\nprised eight psychologists, five physicians, two master-\nlevel mental health counselors, and two advance practice\nregistered nurse (APRN) practitioners.\nConstruct and item development. The authors first performed\na review of the pain and substance abuse literature, and\nexisting risk assessment measures, including the SOAPP-R\n2005). This review identified several prospective content\ndomains likely to increase the risk of opioid abuse (i.e. sub-\nstance use history, depression, and anxiety). These con-\nstructs were presented to the consensus group, which was\nasked to provide feedback on the clinical relevance of each\ndomain, and to identify any spurious or missing constructs.\nThe resulting domains are noted in Table 1.\nAn initial item pool was generated consisting of 230\nitems, positively oriented to one of the six accepted content\ndomains. Many redundant items were included to identify\nthe strongest items for each domain (i.e. \"I have abused\ndrugs or alcohol\" and \"My drug or alcohol use has caused\nme problems in the past\"). The consensus group, who\naccepted, rejected, or requested revisions to item content,\nthen iteratively refined the items, leaving a pool of 162\nitems deemed \"content valid.\" The group was also asked to\ntheoretically load each item onto the factor they perceived\nwas best being measured by the item. In all, 26 items that,\nby group consensus, could not be theoretically loaded onto\na single factor or were thought to load on multiple factors\nwere omitted. Additionally, five volunteer patients with\nyears; three males\nand two females) were asked to identify items that were\nunclear, confusing, or difficult to endorse. These 31 items\nwere removed, leaving 105 prospective items total.\nReducing the item count. Data were gathered from 142 fully\nanonymous volunteers at a pain clinic in Utah, and statisti-\ncal analyses were performed to reduce spurious and con-\nfounding items, and to add some additional evidence\nsupporting the content validity established by the consen-\nsus group. First, items were purged based on reliability and\ncorrected item-total correlation analyses. A confirmatory\nfactor analysis (CFA) was then conducted separately for\neach of the content domains, using the \"majority rules\"\nitem-to-factor assignments obtained from the consensus\ngroup. Since the items were rated on a 4-point Likert-type\nTable 1. CFA fit statistics by construct.\nConsensus defined construct  CFI RMSEA Chi-squarea df\nCFA: confirmatory factor analysis; CFI: confirmatory fit index; RMSEA: root mean square error of approximation; PTSD: post traumatic stress\ndisorder.\naValues estimated using weighted least squares means and variance (WLSMV) cannot be used for chi-square difference tests.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nscale, the default maximum likelihood (ML) estimator,\nwhich assumes continuous data conforming to a multivari-\nate normal distribution, could not be used (Brown, 2015;\nEdwards et al., 2012). Instead, categorical assumptions\nusing WLSMV adjusted estimation was applied as in\nMuthen (2009). Items with unacceptably high modification\nindices (MIs) or low loadings were removed and the CFA\nwas repeated. The results of the six, single factor, CFAs are\npresented alongside the representative content domains\nestablished by the consensus group in Table 1.\nThe results of these analyses were provided to the same\npanel of experts who recommended several revisions (e.g.\nword choice, number of items) and supported the notion\nthat the remaining items were still content valid to the\ndefined constructs. Minor wording revisions were made to\n6 items and 38 were omitted before continuing data collec-\ntion. Data for 61 items were then gathered from 289 fully\nanonymous volunteers at a multi-site pain clinic in Utah.\nPoorly functioning items were removed following classical\nitem analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA), from\nwhich evidence of either one or two factors was obtained.\nCFA was then conducted to test both the one-factor (1A)\nand the two-factor model (1B); the results of these analyses\nare presented in Table 2. Neither model yielded robust fit\nstatistics; however, with CFI\n=\nthe gold standard), the two-factor model (with emotional\nand psychological items loading on one factor, and behav-\nioral items loading on the other) emerged as the stronger of\nthe two. After removing items with high poor factor load-\nings or large correlated errors, 38 items were retained.\nStudy 2: preliminary modeling and validity\nParticipants.Data were gathered from a sample of 267\nadults who presented for consultation at one of several\noutpatient, community-based pain clinics in Utah, Idaho,\nand Nevada that included the OARS items in standard\npreliminary screening paperwork. In all, 249 patients\nwith no missing data were included in analysis, while 18\nincomplete records were omitted. The completing and\nnon-completing populations appear similar: 55 versus\npercent were\nunemployed, 63 versus 61percent were married or part-\npercent were White, and 50 versus\npercent reported currently taking opioid analgesics\nfor pain.\nMethods. As in Study 1, EFAand CFAwere each conducted\non the full sample, and WLSMV rather than ML estimation\nwas applied. EFA again showed strong support for one or\ntwo factors and identified six items that did not load\nstrongly on any factor or that loaded very strongly on mul-\ntiple factors. The consensus group reviewed these items\nand determined that they were either redundant or not criti-\ncal. A CFA was performed on 32 items, testing multiple\nalternate models of factor structure: a two-factor conge-\nneric model (2A) in which the items were specified to load\non two separate first-order factors; a one-factor model (2B);\nand a hierarchical model in which each of the two first-\norder factors in 2A were specified to load on an underlying\nsecond-order factor (2C).\nPreliminary evaluation of convergent and discriminant\nvalidity was performed on model 2A, which demonstrated\nthe best fit, using the recommendations of Fornell and\ncated by the degree to which the average of the squared\nloadings (R2) exceeds .50 for a given factor. Discriminant\nvalidity is evidenced when the average R2 for each factor\nexceeds the squared correlation between factors. A prelimi-\nnary test of concurrent validity was performed by comparing\nthe degree to which raw scores obtained from each of the\nfactors in model 2A were correlated with each other and\nwith raw scores from the SOAPP-R. Although the authors\nfeel the SOAPP-R is limited in biopsychosocial comprehen-\nsive assessment, this measure was selected as the comparator\ngiven its wide spread use as a measure of risk of opioid\nabuse and related ABs, and the scientific evidence support-\ning its validity and reliability.\nTable 2.

Based on\nitem content, the authors and the consensus group labeled\nthe factors \"emotional lability\" (EL) and \"AB.\" Table 3\ncompares the standardized factor loadings and R2 values for\neach item in models 2A and 2B. All items had acceptable\nfactor loadings, and 28 items had strong loadings (>7.0).\nAB factors, respectively. The overall fit of this model (and\nothers) is summarized in Table 2. Acceptable fit is indicated\nalthough RMSEA appears to be undesirably high (.128)\nbased on the range of .05\u00ad.08 suggested by Browne et al.\n(1993). All parameter estimates were significant, and MI\n>10.0 were limited to four potential cross-loadings between\nA relatively high association between factors was\nobserved. The correlation between the two factors in 2A\nwas estimated to be .765. Squaring the correlation indicates\nthat 58percent of the variance in one of these two factors\nis explained by variability in the other factor. Finally,\nCronbach's alpha () was found to be .932 for factor EL\nand .895 for factor AB.

Comparing the item-by-item\nloadings in Table 3 reveals that each item has a lower loading\non model 2B than 2A, smaller R2 values, higher chi-square (a\nmeasure of misfit), lower CFI and TLI, and higher RMSEA.\nThe one-factor model does not fit the data better than 2A.\nTable 3.

Given the degree of corre-\nlation between factors in 2A, it was reasonable to determine\nwhether a hierarchical model specifying a single second-\norder factor would account for the estimated correlation\nbetween two first-order factors. However, 2C was unidenti-\nfied unless the loadings of each of the two first-order fac-\ntors were constrained to be equal. Under this constraint,\nthe fit statistics were identical to those of model 2A--see\nModel 2C will not be presented in further detail.\nPreliminary evidence of concurrent validity. The correla-\ntion between the raw scores of the model 2A EL and AB\nscales was .615 while the correlation of the SOAPP-R to\nues and interpreting the resultant coefficients of determi-\nnation indicate that 40.3percent of the variance in the EL\nfactor and 34.9percent of the AB factor are shared with or\nexplained by the variance in the SOAPP-R. It is important\nto note that the factors of model 2A were not hypothesized\nto correlate perfectly with the SOAPP-R as the OARS\nassesses a broader range of psychiatric variables as well\nas AB and impulsivity. Both measures are designed to\nassess a person's risk of opioid abuse, but by evaluating\nsomewhat different constructs. For this reason, it is rea-\nsonable to expect the variability that is shared between\nthe SOAPP-R and the EL or AB factor to be less than the\nunshared variability. The percentages reported above pro-\nvide nascent evidence that the OARS two-factor model\nmeasures something similar to the SOAPP-R while also\nexhibiting distinguishing characteristics that imply the\nOARS is not identical to the SOAPP-R.\nStudy 3: factor structure replication\nFollowing Study 2, the authors again consulted with the\nconsensus group to discuss results and review items for\ncontent validity after the iterative reduction in item count.\nThe group recommended revisions to the traumatic stress\nitems due to concern about assessing general stress (i.e. in\nStudy 1: \"I sometimes have upsetting dreams about events\nfrom my past\") rather than traumatic stress (i.e. revised in\nStudy 2: \"I have nightmares about a past traumatic event\").\nItems were also added at the request of the consensus\ngroup to address suicidal ideation (i.e. \"I have been think-\ning about ending my life\") and impulsivity (i.e. \"I do\nthings without thinking about the consequences\" and \"I\ndo not plan activities carefully\").\nParticipants.Data were gathered from a sample of 1821\nadults who presented for consultation at one of the 14 out-\npatient community-based pain clinics in various locations\nthroughout the United States. Patients were randomly\nstratified by pain clinic. The authors received only\ncompleted records and do not have information about the\npopulation that may not have completed the assessment.\npercent of subjects were female,\npercent were male, and .5\npercent identified as nei-\nther male nor female. Patients ranged from 18 to 87years\ncent of the patients were unemployed, 40.4percent were\npercent reported participating in sub-\nstance abuse treatment in the past.\nMethods.To avoid capitalizing on chance patterns in the\ndata, EFA was conducted on a different sample than the\nCFA as encouraged by Floyd and Widaman (1995) and\nHenson and Roberts (2006). An EFA, as described in Study\n1 and Study 2, was conducted on sample S1.\nA CFA was conducted on sample S2 to test several mod-\nels that may explain the results of the EFA: model 3A com-\nprised of five first-order factors, models 3B and 3C\nrepresenting the inter-correlations among the five first-order\nfactors using one and two second-order factors, respectively,\nand model 3D, a bifactor model including a general factor\nthat directly influences each of the 28 items as well as\ndomain-specific \"group factors\" that each account for addi-\ntional common variance shared by a cluster of similar items.\nBecause models 3A, 3B, and 3C are nested within the\nbifactor model (3D), the adjusted chi-square difference test\nwas used to formally test each of the three models one at a\ntime against the bifactor solution (Muthen, 2009). Finally, as\nCronbach's alpha is not appropriate for estimating the relia-\nbility of scores based on a higher-order or bifactor model\n(H\n), and omegasubscale\n(S\net al., 2006). Correcting for the multidimensionality in the\ngeneral factor of a bifactor model, H\nindicates the propor-\ntion of the total variance due solely to the general factor\nuse S\nto estimate the internal consistency reliability of each\nspecific factor in a bifactor model independently of all the\nFinally, the explained common variance (ECV) ratio was\nused to quantify the degree of unidimensionality in bifactor\nResults.Contrary to previous results, the parallel analysis\nand eigenvalues strongly supported five or six factors. How-\never, the sixth factor comprises solely of redundant test items\nadded to this latest round of data collection, and these items\nloaded nearly as strongly on one factor in the five-factor\nmodel. The resulting factors were generally aligned with the\noriginal target constructs (depression, anxiety, traumatic\nstress, substance use history, and behavioral risk factors).\nModels 3A: five first-order factors. Model 3A (comprises\nfive first-order factors) allowed the correlations between the\nHenrie-Barrus et al. 7\nfive factors to be freely estimated, but it did not allow for any\ncorrelated residuals. Good relative model-data fit (CFI=.959\nand TLI\n=\n.954) and reasonably good absolute model-data\nfit (RMSEA=.070 and weighted root mean square residual\nWRMR\nThe factors are all positively correlated with the correlations\nModels 3B and 3C: five first-order factors loading on one (3B)\nor two (3C) second-order factors.The results summarized\nFigure 1.

Similarly, reasonably good absolute model-data\nModel 3D: bifactor model with a general factor and five\ndomain-specific factors.The value of H\nthat approximately 89\npercent of the variance in the total\nscores computed from the 28 items is due to the general\nfactor. The values of S\nthe five specific factors have a value less than .230. These\nfindings indicate that the proportion of the variance con-\ntributed by each of the specific factors themselves is rela-\ntively small. The sum of the squared standardized loadings\non the general factor is 12.421, and the sum of the squared\nstandardized loadings on the five domain-specific factors is\nEstimated factor loadings obtained from the bifactor model\nfor the general factor and each of the domain-specific fac-\ntors are reported in Table 5. All of the unstandardized factor\nloadings were statistically significant.\nPreliminary suggestions for scoring. Given that the bifactor\nmodel fits the data better than the other tested models, and\nthe fact that the general factor tends to be dominant relative\nto the specific factors, a single, composite score should be\nreported for each examinee, comprised of the unit-weighted\nsum of responses to all 28 items. If the response anchors are\ncoded 0\u00ad3, the range of possible scores will be 0\u00ad84. The\nscore obtained by an individual respondent can be inter-\npreted as a measure of his or her risk of opioid abuse; the\nhigher the score, the greater the risk. However, it is impor-\ntant to note that until further study compares these 28 items\nto other measures (both behavioral, as in the SOAPP-R,\nand biological, as in urine drug tests), this assumption will\nnot be confirmed. After controlling for the general factor,\nthe loadings on the specific factors are generally small.\nConsequently, the omega values for the specific factors are\ngenerally low as shown in Table 6. Therefore, the items do\nnot provide sufficient information to strongly support the\nreporting of sub-scores for each specific factor. Future data\ncollection and analysis will refine scoring algorithms.\nDiscussion\nEffective and predictive risk stratification screening is vital\nfor anyone being considered for opioid pain management\ngiven the significant abuse liability and related negative\nconsequences, up to and including opioid-related overdose\nand death. Although there are validated measures currently\navailable, which do provide useful information and demon-\nstrate predictive validity (e.g. Butler et al., 2009), they do\nnot deliver a comprehensive assessment of multiple biopsy-\nchosocial risk factors of opioid abuse. The OARS was\ndeveloped in response to the need for careful and compre-\nhensive assessment for opioid risk stratification and was\ncreated based on constructs shown in the literature to be\nmost relevant to substance abuse broadly, and opioid abuse\nspecifically.\nThe models\nAn iterative process has arrived at a measure consisting of\n28 items. Since the 28 items were intended to assess differ-\nent facets of a single over-arching construct (the constructs\nrelated to risk of opioid abuse initially derived), these mod-\nerate-to-high correlations in 3Aare not surprising. However,\nthe size of these between-factor correlations indicates the\npossibility that a hierarchical model would account for\nthese relationships among the factors and better fit the data.\nNext, we explored models that provided a different way\nto explain the inter-correlations among the five first-order\nfactors, with one (3B) or two (3C) second-order factors.\nThe second-order factor is assumed to directly influence\ntwo or more first-order factors, but have no influence on the\nitems specifically. It is assumed that the influence of the\nsecond-order factors on the various items is mediated\nthrough the first-order factors.\nInitial development procedures of the OARS demon-\nstrate preliminary, yet promising internal validity of a\nbifactor model (3D). As above, the value of H\nwas just\npercent indicating that vast majority of variance\nin the total scores computed from the 28 items is due to the\ngeneral factor. Reise (2012) indicates that \"Generally\nspeaking, the higher the ECV, the `stronger' the general\nfactor relative to the group (i.e. specific) factors and thus,\nthe more confidence a researcher has in applying a unidi-\nmensional measurement model to multidimensional data\"\nHigher CFI/TLI and lower RMSEA/WRMR for the\nbifactor relative to the other models support the inference\nthat the bifactor model is a better fit for the data than the\nother three models. These results (presented in Table 7)\nindicate that the bifactor solution produces a statistically\nsignificant decrement in the chi-square measure of misfit\ncompared to each of the other three models. In other words,\neach of the three rival models fits significantly worse than\nthe bifactor model.\nTable 4.

Yet\ndespite that increased granularity, the higher level function-\ning of these constructs has remained relatively stable\nthroughout all three studies presented above with EB andAB\ncontinuing to emerge as strong conceptual frameworks upon\nwhich to base an understanding of risk of opioid abuse.\n10 Health Psychology Open \nMany of the factors that contribute to opioid risk overlap\nwith one another outside of the context of this specific instru-\nment (i.e. psychiatric conditions such as depression and\nPTSD are highly comorbid with substance use disorders), so\ninter-correlated factors and high cross-loadings are not sur-\nprising. Construct-relevant multidimensionality (Morin\net al., 2015) may explain this result as well as the similarities\nobserved between models 2A and 3B. The risk factors for\nopioid abuse do not occur in a vacuum and are not unitary\nconstructs, but are a collection of highly correlated, highly\ncomorbid, and often mutually exacerbating symptoms that\ncontribute to opioid risk (Morin et al., 2015).\nLimitations\nThis work has some limitations that must be addressed.\nAlthough the final sample size is large, the majority of\npatients used for this validation study presented for care at\noutpatient community pain clinics across Utah, Idaho, and\nNevada. It will be valuable to seek a more diverse sample\nin terms of pain populations as well as geographical loca-\ntion to improve generalizability of results. Additionally,\nthis study only evaluates an adult population. Given the\nprevalence rates of opioid abuse among teens, it will be\nimportant to evaluate the OARS' effectiveness at determin-\ning risk in a younger population.\nUnfortunately, information about the race, marital sta-\ntus, and current use of opioid analgesics for pain were not\navailable to the authors for Study 3. Additionally, it is not\nknown how many subjects did not complete the OARS as a\npart of Study 3, because the investigators were only pro-\nvided with data from subjects who completed the full\nassessment and there may be unique characteristics about\nthe population who did not complete the measure. Finally,\nthe investigators were not able to obtain additional meas-\nures in Study 3, as in Study 2, so it is neither possible to\nevaluate convergent validity from the data in Study 3, nor\nto evaluate the generalizability of the preliminary evidence\nof validity in Study 2 to the results of Study 3. However,\npreliminary convergent validity with the SOAPP-R was\nestablished using an earlier iteration of the OARS. These\ndeterminations of criterion and predictive validity will need\nto be firmly established in future research.\nTo further provide support of the instruments validity,\nit will be helpful to compare patient responses on similar\nconstructs across measures and to engage in a more con-\ntrolled study, perhaps including the results of a structured\ninterview and other assessment further exploring personal\nand familial psychiatric and substance abuse history,\ncomorbid medical conditions, history of ABs including\nlegal involvement, coping skills for managing both physi-\ncal and emotional pain and distress, and so on.\nOngoing and future research endeavors will elicit evi-\ndence of convergent and predictive validity, and will\ninclude analysis of specificity and sensitivity when com-\nparing OARS results to biological factors like urine drug\ntests, to reports from the Department of Professional\nLicensing (DOPL) Controlled Substance Database, and to\nother measures including but not limited to the SOAPP-R.\nFuture research should continue to evaluate the external\nvalidity of this instrument, comparing it to other relevant\ndata types (e.g. self- and clinician-administered mood and\nsymptom scales) and other measures of abuse risk level.\nAdditionally, the OARS will be evaluated for use with\nother pain populations (e.g. acute pain, geriatric popula-\ntions, etc.). Given the many reasons people may seek pre-\nscription opioids and may be motivated to exaggerate or\notherwise misreport their symptoms and experiences, it\nwill be valuable to develop a brief malingering, desirability,\nand consistency-in-reporting add-on component to help\nidentify potential drug-seeking individuals and non-illicit\ninadequate reporting by patients. Finally, it will be impor-\ntant to examine the utility of the OARS across treatment as\na safety and compliance monitoring measure. It may be\nuseful to adapt the measure to be more appropriate as an\neffective measure for monitoring.\nAppropriate and effective risk screening can help to\nlower the rates of opioid abuse, overdose, and death, reduce\nincidence of inaccurate or missed diagnoses, and doctor\nshopping, and decrease costs for patients, providers, and\ninsurers by providing additional information concerning\npatient's backgrounds and potential risk factors (Chou\nprehensive measure to assess a variety of elements shown\nby the literature to be predictive of increased risk of abuse,\nand meets a demand for effective risk stratification in the\nface of the significant public health crisis that is prescrip-\ntion opioid. The OARS is a promising tool in opioid risk\nmanagement that could be used to improve patient out-\ncomes and reduce risk of opioid abuse.\nTable 7.
