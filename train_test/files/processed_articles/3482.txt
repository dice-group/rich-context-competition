For example, 200 ng of enkeph-\nalin injected into the rat cerebral ven-\ntricle showed obvious analgesic effects.21\nEOPs are also associated with learning\nand memory, cardiovascular activity, repro-\nduction, the endocrine system and\nIt is well recognized that the intense pain\nassociated with surgical operations can acti-\nvate the pre-EOP genes that encode for the\npre-EOPs.24 In our opinion, the expression\nof the pre-EOP genes may reflect the par-\nticular type of anaesthesia in use during\nsurgery.24 Our previous research demon-\nstrated that some pre-EOP genes were\nhighly expressed in patients undergoing\nsurgery with the use of intravenous and\ninhalational general anaesthesia, suggesting\nthat these surgical patients were still exposed\nto pain and stress whilst being anaesthe-\ntized.24 This finding could be explained by\nthe fact that somatosensory pain is still\nbeing successfully conducted to the central\nnervous system. It is well known that epi-\ndural anaesthesia can block the transmission\nof all somatosensory pain impulses towards\nthe central nerve system, thus ensuring pain\nrelief during surgery. In order to investigate\nwhether patients are truly pain free under\ngeneral anaesthesia with epidural block, this\ncurrent study investigated the changes in the\nplasma concentrations of three EOPs and\nthe mRNA levels of two pre-EOP genes in\nperipheral blood lymphocytes during\nsurgery.\nPatients and methods\nPatient population\nThis prospective study enrolled consecutive\npatients scheduled to undergo pectoral\nor abdominal surgery in the Department\nof Anaesthesiology, Cancer Hospital,\nShanghai Medical College, Fudan\nUniversity, Shanghai, China between\npatients were American Society of\nAnesthesiologists Physical Status Classifica-\ntion System 1\u00ad2.25 All patients were inter-\nviewed before enrolment to ensure that they\nwere not experiencing any cancer pain prior\nto their operation.\nEthics approval was provided by the\nEthics Committee of Fudan University\n(clinical trial registration number: 0331-\nCollege, Fudan University) and written\ninformed consent was obtained from all\nstudy participants.\nAnaesthesiology methods\nFollowing epidural acupuncture, 10 ml of\n0.5% bupivicaine was injected into the\ncavity. With the epidural anaesthesia at full\neffect, a GrasebyTM 3500 syringe anaesthesia\npump (Smiths Medical, Ashford, UK) for\ntarget controlled infusion (TCI) and a\nHXD-I series block-type multifunctional\nmonitor (Huaxiang, Heilongjiang, China)\nto record the bispectral index (BIS) and\nmean arterial pressure (MAP) were\ninstalled. The feedback stopping indices of\npropofol TCI were set at BIS <50 and\nMAP <70 mmHg. The following drugs\nwere injected intravenously for tracheal\n4 mg/ml propofol TCI, 2\u00ad3 mg/kg fentanyl\nand 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium. Anaesthesia was\nTCI. Arterial blood (4 ml) was collected\nfrom each patient at the surgical time\n80 min, and 0.3 M disodium ethylenediami-\nnetetra-acetic acid (80 ml) was added to each\nsample to provide anticoagulation.\nAprotinin (2000 U; Livzon Pharmaceutical\nGroup, Zhuhai, China) was added to the\nblood samples to prevent protein degrad-\nation and the plasma was processed imme-\nZhaodi Biotechnology, Shanghai, China).\nPeripheral blood lymphocytes were sepa-\nrated from 2.5 ml arterial blood drawn at the\nsurgical time points of 0 and 80 min. The\nsample of arterial blood was mixed with\ndisodium ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid\n(80 ml), 5 ml of lymphocyte separating\nmedium (Lymphocyte Separation Medium;\nBiomars, Beijing, China) and 0.9% w/v\nsodium chloride (2.5 ml), then centrifuged\nusing an L-500 centrifuge (Shanghai Zhaodi\nBiotechnology). The purified lymphocytes\nwere mixed with 1 ml of TRIzol\u00d5 reagent\n(Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) to\nextract total RNA following the manufac-\nturers' instructions, and then the samples\nwere stored at \u00c070C until further analysis.\nAll the patients were asked if they had\nexperienced any pain or sensorium during\nsurgery or if they did so shortly after\npalinaesthesia (i.e. waking up from\nanaesthesia).\nRadioimmunoassay and RT\u00adPCR analysis\nThe plasma concentrations of b-endorphin,\nleucine-enkephalin and dynorphin A were\nmeasured using commercially available\nradioimmunoassay kits following the manu-\nfacturers' instructions (The Second Military\nMedical University, Shanghai, China).\nReverse transcription\u00adpolymerase chain\nreaction (RT\u00adPCR) was used to measure the\nlevels of PPD and PPE mRNA in peripheral\nblood lymphocytes. Total RNA was\nextracted from peripheral blood lympho-\ncytes that were separated from 2.5 ml of\narterial blood as described above and\nreverse transcribed to cDNA using an RT\u00ad\nPCR kit (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) accord-\ning to the manufacturer's instructions. The\nPCR primers were prepared by one of the\nauthors (Z.-Y.C.) in the Department of\nAnaesthesiology, Cancer Hospital,\nShanghai Medical College, Fudan\nUniversity, Shanghai, China using Primer\nPremier 5 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto,\nCA, USA). The PCR primer sequences for\nTTCAGC-30 (antisense); producing a PCR\namplification product of 627 base pairs (bp).\nThe PCR primer sequences for PPE were:\n(antisense); producing a PCR amplification\nproduct of 529 bp. The PCR primer\nsequences for the internal control b-actin\nGCTTGCTGATC-30 (antisense); producing\na PCR amplification product of 275 bp. The\nPCR was performed in a thermal cycler\n(Shanghai Naze Instrument, Shanghai,\nChina). The cycling programme involved\npreliminary denaturation at 94C for 2 min,\nfollowed by 35 cycles of denaturation at\na final elongation step at 68C for 7 min.\nThe PCR products were separated by\nelectrophoresis in 1% agarose gel, stained\nwith ethidium bromide and the density of\nthe bands was calculated using an\nImageMasterTM VDS-CL system (Amer-\nsham Pharmacia Biotech, Little\nChalfont, UK).\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 16.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. All data are presented as\nmean \u00c6 SD. The data collected at all of the\nsurgical time points after 0 min were com-\npared with the baseline data at 0 min using\nanalysis of variance or Student's t-test. A\nP-value <0.05 was considered to be statis-\ntically significant.\nResults\nFifteen patients (13 male and 2 female) with\n(range 38\u00ad56 years) participated in this\nstudy. The BIS was controlled at near 50\nduring surgery in all patients. None of the\npatients complained of pain or sensorium\nduring surgery or shortly after palinaesthe-\nsia. The changes in the plasma concentra-\ntions of b-endorphin, leucine-enkephalin\nand dynorphin A during surgery are pre-\nsented in Table 1. The plasma concentra-\ntions of b-endorphin were significantly\nlower at all time-points compared with the\nbaseline value at 0 min (P < 0.05 for all\ncomparisons). The plasma concentrations\nof leucine-enkephalin and dynorphin A were\ncompared with the baseline value at 0 min\n(P < 0.05 for all comparisons).\nFrom the results of RT\u00adPCR, the PPD/b-\nactin ratio decreased significantly at 80 min\ncompared with the ratio at 0 min (P < 0.05),\nwhile the PPE/b-actin ratio showed no\nsignificant change (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nIn recent years, controlling and monitoring\nthe depth of general anaesthesia has become\nan important area of research.26 A number\nTable 1.

No pain or sensorium were\nreported to have been experienced during\nthe operation and following palinaesthesia\nin all patients in this current study. The\nplasma concentrations of b-endorphin, leu-\ncine-enkephalin and dynorphin A were\neither significantly lower or showed no\nsignificant change from the baseline values\nduring surgery, which explains why the\npatients reported experiencing no pain or\nsensorium during surgery.\nIn the current study, the PPD/b-actin\nmRNA ratio decreased significantly at\n80 min compared with the baseline ratio at\n0 min, while the PPE/b-actin mRNA ratio\nshowed no significant change. These current\nfindings suggest that the expression of these\ntwo pre-EOP genes was not increased during\nsurgery performed under intravenous gen-\neral anaesthesia and an epidural block.\nWhen the current results are compared\nwith those of our previous research,24\nwhich showed a higher level of expression\nof pre-EOP genes in peripheral blood\nlymphocytes and a significant increase in\nthe plasma concentrations of b-endorphin,\nleucine-enkephalin and dynorphin A during\nsurgery performed under intravenous and\ninhalational general anaesthesia, they sug-\ngest that the patients in the current study\nwere truly pain free when operated upon\nunder general anaesthesia administered with\nan epidural block.\nThe active area of general anaesthetics\nruns from the peripheral nerve terminal to\nthe cerebral cortex, where neurons are\ndensely packed. The centre of the nocicep-\ntive reflex arc can be the neurons in the\nspinal cord or other areas of the central\nnerve system containing different types of\nTable 2.

It is well known that various types\nof neurons respond differently to anaes-\nthetics. When a patient undergoes intraven-\nous and inhalational general anaesthesia,\nthe somatosensory impulses of pain, tem-\nperature and touch can still be successfully\nconducted towards the cortex. Surgical pro-\ncedures can produce somatosensory\nimpulses that stimulate the reticular forma-\ntion of the central nervous system.\nTherefore, the electroencephalographic indi-\nces and depth of general anaesthesia can be\nunstable, as indicated by the fact that the\nBIS changes markedly when the skin is cut,\nwhich might explain why there is no one\nindex that perfectly reflects the depth of\ngeneral anaesthesia.24\nFor the patient who is operated upon\nunder intravenous general anaesthesia com-\nbined with an epidural block, no somato-\nsensory pain impulses are conducted\ntowards the brain during surgery because\nthe active area of local anaesthetics is the\nspinal nerve root. As a consequence, the\nelectroencephalographic indices would be\nstable so that the depth of anaesthesia\ncould be readily controlled, as demonstrated\nin the current study.\nThis current study had a number of\nlimitations. First, the half-life of EOPs in\nplasma is not very long because they are\nshort peptides, so it might be more physio-\nlogically correct to measure the change in\ntheir concentrations in the cerebrospinal\nfluid. Secondly, the expression of the pre-\nEOP genes in the brain might better reflect\nthe changes in response to surgery and type\nof anaesthesia. This current study was\nlimited to the use of peripheral blood\nlymphocytes from arterial blood. Future\nresearch will focus on the expression of\npre-EOP genes in the brain during surgery\nperformed using different types of anaesthe-\nsia in animal models.\nIn conclusion, this current study demon-\nstrated that the plasma concentrations\nof three endogenous opioid peptides,\nb-endorphin, leucine-enkephalin and dynor-\nphin A, in patients during scheduled pec-\ntoral or abdominal surgery were either\nsignificantly lower or remained unchanged\ncompared with baseline. In addition, the\nrelative level of PPD mRNA was signifi-\ncantly lower at 80 min compared with base-\nline, while the relative level of PPE mRNA\nshowed no significant change during sur-\ngery. Taken together, these findings suggest\nthat the patients in this current study were\ntruly pain free when operated upon under\ngeneral anaesthesia administered with an\nepidural block.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
