One pole of this force, according to Kerr, dictates a\nnatural emergence of individuality and emotional separate-\nness, whereas the other keeps family members operating in\nreaction to one another. The birth of a child is typically seen\nas the latter of the two opposing forces, as it exemplifies\nintense and intimate physical and emotional involvement by\nthe mother to ensure the very survival of the infant. This\nseems to be an important evolutionary process and is univer-\nsally obvious in mammalian relationships (Kerr, 1988).\nIn the study of family relationships, however, it is vital to\nconsider the interaction of these forces and to recognize that\nthe mother\u00adchild connectedness is not only symbiotic but\nalso represents the beginnings of the reciprocity that is a\ncharacteristic of familial interactions (Parker, 1995).\nAccording to Love (1990), the mother as well as the child\nthrives on the physical contact, intimacy, and unconditional\nlove that is reminiscent of parent\u00adinfant interactions. Love\nfurther described the mother\u00adinfant relationship as an emo-\ntional attachment that often requires offsetting forces to keep\nit within healthy bounds. It is precisely this emotional fusion,\nor at least the potential for it, that parents are charged with\nresolving by engaging in behaviors that are designed to pro-\nmote and permit the emergence of individuality and healthy\nemotional development (Kerr, 1988). In other words, it is the\nresponsibility of the parent to provide the child the \"secure\nbase from which the child can venture forth into the wider\nworld and return to as a safe haven of reassurance\"\nIt is not the goal of this contribution to promote total\nemotional separateness from one's family of origin as a\nmental health standard. Disengagement, according to\nWilliams and Hiebert (2001), is the polar opposite of the\nsubject of this contribution. While enmeshment can pose\ndebilitating challenges to a child's emotional and social\ndevelopment, disengagement, too, it seems, can be just as\ndevastating. For family systems, as well as other mental\nhealth practitioners, it is common knowledge that either\nextreme (disengagement or enmeshment) would be counter-\nproductive to adaptive emotional functioning (Barbarin &\nHiebert, 2001). Rather, family systems researchers, theorists,\nwriters, and practitioners generally view interdependence and\nreciprocity within family systems to be a healthy mechanism\nfor promoting personal growth (Bradshaw, 1989; Forward,\nAn important task of parenting, then, is one of striking a\nhealthy balance between attachment to the child and separat-\ning in a way that encourages and supports the child's develop-\nment of autonomy.\nWithin each of the three subsystems of the family intro-\nduced by Minuchin (1974), healthy interactions are marked\nby interdependence and mutual give and take. Although the\nspousal-, parental-, and sibling subsystems operate as dis-\ntinct units within the system, Minuchin also purported that\nhealthy interactions and boundaries between and among\nsubsystems contribute to adaptive development of the fam-\nily unit. The spousal subsystem, for example, is a unit con-\ntained within itself, but yet that functions also as a parental\nsubsystem. Strength in one subsystem may be related to\nstrength in other subsystems within the family. Conversely,\nit seems, breaches in one subsystem are intimately related to\nboundary violations in other subsystems.

Most practitioners, theorists, and instructors of family\nsystems theory concur that healthy interactions between par-\nents and their children can be defined in fairly broad terms.\nNo definition, however, can reasonably preclude parents'\nbasic responsibility for the provision of food, clothing, and\nshelter. Even then, the responsibility of parents for their chil-\ndren's emotional development extends broadly to such areas\nas parental assignment of age-appropriate privileges and\nresponsibilities, encouragement of children's independence,\nestablishment of clear guidelines and rules, and the appropri-\nate exchange of physical affection (Barbarin & Tirado, 1985;\nBowen (1978) introduced the concept of self-differentiation\nas a vital component in children's emotional and social\ngrowth and in their development of independence. Differ-\nentiation, in Bowen's conceptualization, is an evolving\nprocess that requires effort on the part of the child. More\nimportantly, according to Bowen, self-differentiation of the\nchild is mostly a product of the parent's active efforts to\npromote the development of an autonomous identity. Bowen\ntermed this process individuation, and charges parents with\nbeing the primary catalysts for its development. The parent,\naccording to Bowenian notion, is charged with the develop-\nment of the child's differentiation by not only supporting the\nchild's effort but also by actively creating and encouraging\nopportunities for increasing degrees of emotional separation.\nThe well-differentiated person, according to Knudson-Martin\n(1994), is inner directed, autonomous, and can function sepa-\nrately within relationships. Knudson-Martin (1994) described\nthis person as \"a solid self . . . made up of firmly held convic-\ntions and beliefs which are formed slowly and can be changed\nonly from within the self\" (p. 38). The aforementioned polar\nforces of attachment and separateness, as proposed by Kerr\n(1988), seem to be the catalyst for the evolution of differen-\ntiation in the family system (Theriault, 1997). Theorists pro-\npose that at least one characteristic of differentiation is the\nperson who can successfully separate from his parents while\nstill maintaining attachment bonds with them (Anderson &\ndescribed the experience of differentiated people as an inher-\nent freedom to think and feel independently of their families\nwithout feeling a sense of betrayal.\nDifferentiation levels in families are often manifested in\nthe family members' interactional patterns. How and to what\ndegree family members engage with one another provide\nclues to the provision and maintenance of interpersonal\nspace within the family unit? Interpersonal space, in turn,\nserves as indication of the family's level of tolerance for\nindividuality (Anderson & Sabatelli, 1992; Manzi, Vignoles,\nEnmeshment\nBarber and Buehler (1996) defined enmeshment as \"family\npatterns that facilitate psychological and emotional fusion\namong family members, potentially inhibiting the individu-\nation process and the development and maintenance\nof psychosocial maturity\" (p. 433). Barber and Buehler\ncontended, further, that enmeshment is a culprit in chil-\ndren's stifled development of skills to deal adequately with\ncommon social stressors. Enmeshed families are character-\nized by levels of emotional closeness that are often seen as\nconstraining. These families use manipulation, usually in\nthe form of overly excessive, but superficial expressions of\nlove and unity to demand loyalty from their members.\nConflicts are blanketed under the guise of solidarity\nand great effort is expended in maintaining the status\nquo. Members of enmeshed families typically describe their\nfamilies as conflict free, while at the same time, these very\nunits are characterized by high demands for conformity\nEnmeshed families depend on each other excessively.\nParadoxically, members of these families tend to have a\nlimited sense of their own identity, and therefore make deci-\nsions based on emotions, and as a reaction to the perceived\nwishes of other members of the system (Kinnier, Brigman,\nSo profound is the impact of enmeshment on families that\nresearchers have determined there to be relationships\nbetween these unhealthy familial interactions and physiolog-\nical functioning. Mengel, Davis, Abell, and Baker (1991)\nnoted previous findings of an increased probability of low\nbirth weight among infants born into families who fit the\ncharacterization of being enmeshed. This same team of\nresearchers also discovered a positive correlation between\nmaternal blood pressure and family enmeshment. According\nto Mengel et al. (1991), the stress produced by the intensive\nstifling of autonomy in enmeshed family systems serves to\nexact adverse physiological consequences on expectant\nmothers. These women tend to have elevated blood pressure\nduring the gestational period. With controlled health factors,\npregnant women from enmeshed systems tend to show at\nleast an average increase of 3 mmHg in systolic blood pres-\nsure, as compared with a control group. Other physiological\nimplications of family enmeshment include findings of the\neffectiveness of structural therapy as a tool in facilitating\ngreater management of diabetes in adolescents. These kinds\nof physiological responses, as said by Mengel et al. (1991),\nare likely the products of delayed conflict resolution and\npoor or maladaptive family coping options.\nIt is only prudent that a word of caution be interjected\nhere. Some may argue, and reasonably so, that family sup-\nport and togetherness is associated with positive outcomes\nin times of distress. Moreover, family support seems crucial\nin propelling people forward in their personal and profes-\nsional lives. More than a decade ago, Barber and Buehler\n(1996) sought to clarify those family factors that support\nHann-Morrison 3\nindividuation from those that stifle emotional development.\nCohesion and enmeshment, the researchers assert, are not\nlinear, but, more importantly, are conceptually different\nnotions. Barber and Buehler clearly deciphered between\nenmeshment and its relative cohesion. Although enmesh-\nment is rooted in manipulation and control, they say,\ncohesion is a positive trait that is an example of supportive\nfamily interactions. Cohesion, according to Barber and\nBuehler (1996), is defined as \"shared affection, support,\nhelpfulness, and caring among family members\" (p. 433).\nManzi et al. (2006) added to this definition the notion of\ntolerance of intimacy as a vital component in understand-\ning cohesion, as opposed to enmeshment. Like their fellow\nresearchers 10 years earlier, Manzi et al. confirmed that\nfamily cohesion and family enmeshment are two separate\nand distinct constructs. Like Barber and Buehler, Manzi\net al. found that cohesion was related to positive behavioral\noutcomes and psychological well-being among adoles-\ncents. Furthermore, Manzi et al. were able to consistently\ndemonstrate the existence of a positive correlation between\nfamily cohesion and positive adolescent behavioral\noutcomes across cultural lines. Both research teams found\nan inverse relationship between enmeshment and positive\nbehavioral outcomes and psychological well-being.\nThe enmeshed system may be summarized, then, as having\nboth internal and external boundary management problems.\nIn enmeshed systems, internal boundaries that define inter-\npersonal familial relationships are weak, whereas boundar-\nies to the world outside of the system are rigid (Manzi\nMaternal Enmeshment\nAlthough we have given discussion to enmeshed systems,\nwe will now consider the issue of the enmeshed relationship\nbetween a parent and a particular child. We will refer to the\nvictim of maternal enmeshment as the \"chosen child,\" to\nborrow a concept provided by Love (1990, p. 8). Parental\nenmeshment not only hinders but also prevents differentia-\ntion of the child, resulting in a dance of circular immaturity\nand reactivity between the parent and child (Minuchin,\nparent as one who blurs familial boundaries and engages in\nhovering behaviors. These parents, they contend, are overly\naccessible to their children and they simply \"do too much\"\nresult, they add, is a loss of autonomy by the child.\nThese children, then, according to Bevcar and Bevcar\n(1996), tend to rely on their parents instead of on their own\ncapabilities. They develop a fear of experimentation, a fear\nof failure, and a fear of success. Grotevant and Cooper\n(1986) provided evidence that diffusion of family boundaries\nwas highly correlated with lowered tendency toward explor-\natory behaviors by adolescents, whereas Gavazzi (1993)\nshowed that adolescents from systems where mothers are\ndeemed to be enmeshed not only show difficulties in format-\nting identity but they also have difficulties in participating in\ninterdependent peer relationships. Gavazzi (1993) con-\ntended, further, that these children tend to view themselves\nas forever in need of other people's assistance and will con-\ntinue to call on family members for help in decision\nmaking.\nAs indicated in previous sections of this contribution, par-\nenting offers some rewards that are not only gratifying for the\nchild but for the mother as well. Some of the parental benefits\nrequire the presence of offsetting forces if adaptive boundar-\nies between parent and child are to develop and be maintained\n(Love, 1990). In this author's more than 10 years of clinical\nexperience, often is the case when, despite the existence of\nother relationship obligations, a mother may stretch the limits\nof parenting far beyond what is healthy. In such cases, these\nrelationships are laden with boundary violations and breaches\nof familial subsystems. A case synopsis might serve to illus-\ntrate the nature of maternal enmeshment:\nWhile delivering Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST) in\nthe home of a former client, the case of maternal\nenmeshment was blaringly evident. The 8-week inten-\nsive in-home service delivery model afforded this\nprovider an in-depth look at the true workings of this\nparticular family system. While the entire system pre-\nsented with overt characteristics of enmeshment\n(seven of nine adult male children between the ages of\n34 and 49 had never been married, and paid daily vis-\nits to the family matriarch; the mother prepared daily\nmeals and provided laundry services for the seven\nunmarried adult males), the relationship between the\n74-year old mother and one son (then age 39) was\nparticularly disturbing. Clearly this son had been des-\nignated the \"chosen child.\" Other members of the\nfamily were clear in their description of this son as the\nmother's favorite. While this son was now an adult,\nhis history revealed more than 20 years of adulthood\nwith at least nine consecutive romantic relationships\nof short duration. The \"chosen child\" in this case,\nalong with the mother in this system, described their\nrelationship as one of \"friends.\" This family expressed\nno disease in volunteering that the mother took the\nliberty of interceding on her son's behalf to secure a\ndate for her 37-year-old son. The target of the son's\naffection denied the man a date, so the mother called\nto find out why the woman had not wanted to go out\nwith her son. Neither the son, nor the mother found\nanything inappropriate about this, or other similar\nincidents. Interestingly, or rather, expectedly, the rela-\ntionship between the father and mother in this family\nwas severely compromised. The father presented as a\npowerful figure, answering questions for the wife and\nother family members. In the father's presence\nthe mother was quiet and conceding. Whenever the\n4 SAGE Open\n\"chosen child\" son would enter the room, however,\nthe father would exit. This was a noticeable pattern\nover the course of the therapy. In her son's presence\nthe mother clearly became more comfortable. Her\nfacial expressions changed, as did her demeanor and\nher willingness to engage. In the son's presence, the\nmother smiled frequently, responded to questions, and\neven volunteered information.\nAlthough this particular case seems to be an \"over-the-\ntop\" illustration of maternal enmeshment, it clearly demon-\nstrates the magnitude of the ill effects of emotionally\nincestuous relationships. Love (1990) defined emotional\nincest between a mother and son as maternal enmeshment\nwith a child to the degree that the child's sense of self is so\nlimited and his need for connection with his mother is so\ngreat that the child is powerless over the relationship. In\nsuch a relationship, according to Love, the mother keeps her\nson dependent on her while paradoxically, using him to\nfulfill her own emotional needs. Bradshaw (1989) termed\nthis unhealthy bond spousification of the child, and charac-\nterized it as a blatant violation of the intimacy taboo between\nparent and child. The mother, in this and related cases, is\npreying on the child's admiration and unconditional love to\nmeet a need for which children are inadequately equipped--\nmarital partnership. Adult partnering requires and is contin-\ngent on partners' readiness to actively engage in processes\nsuch as intimacy formation, companionship, problem solv-\ning, ego fulfillment, and ego release. These are all tasks,\naccording to Forward (1989), that require at least adult lev-\nels of emotional and psychological development.\nMuch like the case summary noted above, the \"chosen\nchild\" only notices the exclusivity of his relationship with\nand his access to his mother. He enjoys the attention he\nreceives in the form of shared confidences, extra privileges,\npraise, and affection. The emotionally incestuous relation-\nship results in its victim \"mama's boy\" (Love, 1990, p. 8)\nhaving limited age-appropriate interactions with his siblings\nor other peers. Consequently, he also has limited opportuni-\nties to practice being a child. This gross lack of appropriate\npeer group experiences perpetuates the child's already\narrested social development. Ultimately, this child will stag-\nnate in his emotional, as well as his social, development and\nwill tend to function primarily in reaction to others.\nAlthough we recognize that the challenges inherent in the\nemotional incest victim's adult life affects his ability to\nengage on an emotional level, there is yet another component\nof this person's adult relationship that may also suffer.\nAdams's (2011) insights into the depths of such a pathologi-\ncal bond speak to the emotional unavailability of emotional\nincest victims in their adult sexual relationships. One may be\ninclined to ask, in all sincerity, how it is that emotional incest\ngets in the way of its victim's adulthood sexual expressions.\nBecause victims of emotional incest carry their intense needs\ninto their adult relationships, according to Adams, it is not\nuncommon that they marry their emotionally abusive par-\nents. It stands to reason, then, that these adults (both the vic-\ntim and his like-minded spouse) are ill equipped for healthy\nadult relationships in several life domains. Their emotional\nintimacy with their spouses will be compromised, as will be\ntheir ability for healthy sexual expression.\nAccording to Adams (2011), the emotional incest victim's\nadult sexual relationship is commonly marked by lack of pas-\nsion at one end of the spectrum or volatility at the other.\nUltimately, what is notably consistent in the sexual expres-\nsion of the maternally enmeshed adult male is the need for\nescape, rather than connection (Adams & Morgan, 2007).\nAdams and Morgan (2007) explained that the maternally\nenmeshed adult male struggles to remain loyal to the role to\nwhich he has been assigned by his mother. This role, mind\nyou, is not one of a fully individuated adult who is aware of,\nand can fully express a range of feelings. This definition\nascribed by the abuser is one whereby the victim is constantly\nin need of someone else's opinion to determine his own\nworth. Erotic engagement for this person, then, lacks the\ndepth of give-and-take reminiscent of healthy exchange, and\nis, rather, more like a performance for which he is to be rated.\nMaternal FactorsThat Contribute to\nEnmeshment\nMost practitioners would agree to our human need for com-\npanionship. Bradshaw (1989) described our partnering in\nadulthood as the system's need for a (good) marriage.\nHaving someone with whom to share intimacies (emotion-\nally as well as physically) is a need that seems to transcends\nspecies, even. Jane Goodall's famous research on chimpan-\nzee's, for example, left little doubt in our minds regarding\nthe stark similarities between humans and simians in our\nattachments to our children. \"Flo,\" the maternal figure in\none of Goodall's research units, demonstrated variable\ndegrees of attachment with her own (chimpanzee) children,\nmuch like would be seen in human maternal relationships.\nInterestingly, Flo developed an unhealthy attachment with\none of her male children, Flint. A catalyst for this enmeshed\nrelationship, it seems, may have been Flo's own compro-\nmised functioning secondary to the loss of another of her\nFlo's resolve to impose the \"opposing force\" (Kerr, 1988)\nthat encourages independence in children may have been\nweakened by her grief. While Flint's demands for his moth-\ner's attention may have been manageable under not so\nstressful circumstances, in the face of grief, however, these\nsame demands may have become overwhelming for the\nmother. However, Johnson contended, allowing Flint to con-\ntinue to be dependent undoubtedly provided Flo opportuni-\nties to \"mother\" the lost child. In other words, Flint became\na substitute for the lost child.\nAlthough maternity is seen as a compassionate endeavor,\nwe tend to equate it with a certain level of gentility; benign,\nHann-Morrison 5\nand certainly absent of the malice one associates with such\nterms as incest. Who among us, one may then ask, would\ninflict such an injustice on her own child? Research shows\nthat the mother who spousifies her son is not necessarily an\nthat enmeshed mothers usually do not know the difference\nbetween parenting and partnering. These women, they say,\nare not knowledgeable about the emotional needs of chil-\ndren. They all assert, further, though, that among the primary\nliabilities of enmeshed mothers are their lack of role models\nand their own unresolved emotional issues.\nAs inferred earlier in the contribution, the primary train-\ning ground for child rearing is one's own family of origin.\nThe behaviors of our parents and significant extended family\nmembers are usually our only lessons in mothering or father-\ning. Consequently, their parenting becomes our parenting.\nHabits, ideologies, and philosophies are then transmitted\ngenerationally. It is no wonder, then, that women who engage\nin emotionally incestuous relationships with their sons are\ngenerally, themselves, the products of dysfunctional fami-\nlies. Emotionally incestuous mothers are generally looking\nto their sons to fulfill a need that has gone unmet long before\nadulthood. Furthermore, they, too, are so stunted in their\nemotional development, that they feel compelled to seek out\nneed fulfillment in the most convenient manner, and from\nthe most convenient source, their children (Bradshaw, 1989).\nTheorists also point out the parenting fallacies portrayed\nby television families as contributing to the notion of wom-\nen's maternal responsibilities (Love, 1990; Manzi et al.,\n2006). June Cleaver, for example, seemed immersed in the\ngoings-on of Wally and The Beaver, while placing little\nemphasis on her own circle of friends or on her relationship\nwith her husband. Even more contemporary media portray-\nals of maternity offer up the continually self-sacrificing\ndivorced mom as the epitome of morally correct parenting.\nContemporary media provided us with such extreme cases\nof mothering as Marie Baron (\"Everybody Loves\nRaymond\"), as an indication of how not to mother. Even\nthe nonpractitioner could readily see the profound pathol-\nogy in this fictional family's reactions to one another and\nan over-the-top manipulating mother. The symptoms of\nmaternal enmeshment may not be so readily observable as\nwhat is noted in the Baron family.\nWhile 21st-century TV mothers Rosanne Connor and\nReba Hart hailed from opposite sides of the economic and\nsocial tracks, they both, like their predecessors, provided the\nworld with images of women so invested in their children's\nlives that they neglected their own needs. These kinds of\nmessages, say systems theorists and practitioners, impose\nexacting demands on mothers regarding what their primary\nresponsibilities should be. Such messages and messengers,\nof course, in conjunction with family members' modeling\nplace marriage and other significant relationships in a posi-\ntion secondary to that of mothering (Bradshaw, 1988a,\nWomen who are enmeshed with their sons were consis-\ntently found to lack self-definition as well as healthy adult\nenmeshed mother, say researchers (Gavazzi, Anderson, &\none whose relationships with other adults are either nonexis-\ntent or severely limited. She may be a single parent, they say,\nby divorce or by choice. She may also be married but to an\nLove (1990) noted that in the case of the married woman who\nis in an enmeshed relationship with her child, although her\nhusband may be physically present, he is not actively engaged\nin the role of a spouse, at least not at an emotional level. The\nvoid left by the physically or emotionally absent husband is\nthen expected to be filled by the son (Schwartzman, 2006).\nAlthough subsystems are independently functioning\nunits, the adaptive operations of the family system are con-\ntingent on the (adaptive) interdependence of each subsystem\nwith and among other subsystems (Minuchin, 1974). Each\nsubsystem has a role to fulfill in ensuring the continuation of\nthe system as a whole unit. Because of the dynamic relation-\nships between and among subsystems, breaches in the func-\ntioning of one subsystem will adversely affect the ability of\nthe other systems to function adaptively. A member in one\nsubsystem may blur boundaries, however, in encroaching on\nmembers of another subsystem to have his or her's needs\nmet. When a \"marriage\" does not exist in its traditional terms\nand between two adults, it is not uncommon for a wife whose\nemotional needs are not being met to encroach on an avail-\nable son to act in a spousal capacity (Dickstein, Seifer,Albus,\nAnother common liability noted in enmeshed mothers\ninvolve a spectrum of issues related to these women's own\nemotional or mental stability. Love (1990), Bradshaw\nbility and affective dysfunctioning to be characteristic of\nenmeshed mothers. Depression, they say, seems to be a\nmajor contributing factor in maternally enmeshed relation-\nships more often than not. The phenomena, they contend,\nseems to be more common in women with chronic depres-\nsion, and whose need for support may be overwhelming.\nDickstein et al. (2004) noted that families with depressed\nmothers are related to increased levels of impaired\nfunctioning. Mothers with depression, it seems, tend to rely\non their adolescents and adult children for support, and\ntend, further, to exhibit a broad array of dysfunctions in the\narea of affective functioning (Dickstein et al., 2004).\nDickstein et al. report, interestingly, that while depressed\nwomen with infants tend to be disengaged from their infant\nchildren, they tend, conversely, to attach intensely to their\nadolescent and adult children. As their children age, it\n6 SAGE Open\nseems, these women impose increasing demands on the\nchildren for intimacy and social support.\nThe Social Fallout\nAccording to Schwartzman (2006), compromises in the\ninteraction regulation between mothers and sons are more\ncommon than those between mothers and daughters. Lindsey,\nMacKinnon-Lewis, Campbell, Frabutt, and Lamb (2002)\noffered similar findings, noting that boys are more at risk for\nnegative effects of parenting on social outcomes. According\nto Schwartzman and Lindsey et al., while enmeshment by\nmothers may plague the mother\u00addaughter relationship, the\nmother\u00adson relationship seems to be more vulnerable to\nmaternal enmeshment.\nAs the \"chosen child\" (Love, 1990, p. 8), the boy who\nhas found himself in his mother's continual graces usually\nfinds the special privileges and extra attention he receives\nfrom his mother gratifying. The ultimate toll on the child,\nhowever, will be nothing less than life altering. Levying the\nadult responsibilities of emotional nurturance for one's par-\nent on the shoulders of a child compromises the child's\ndevelopment in several crucial domains. Love (1990) pur-\nported that as lofty a position as being the \"chosen child\"\nmay seem, the victim of maternal enmeshment is precisely\nthat--a victim. In exchange for his service to his mother,\nthis child actually relinquishes his entire life. According to\nAnderson and Sabatelli (1992), this child loses out on\nopportunities to interact socially with peers, and ultimately\nloses out on his childhood. This loss of childhood, they\noffer, has a downwardly spiraling effect. In addition to ren-\ndering the child unfit for adaptive peer interactions, the\nunhealthy mother\u00adson relationship also has the cumulative\neffect of decreased opportunities for adaptive adolescent\ninteractions, and therefore limited opportunities to practice\nassuming adult roles. Gavazzi et al. (1993) believed that\nbecause the chosen child misses out on the socialization\ninherent in peer contact, he consequently does not develop\nemotionally or socially. His repertoire of responses, they\ncontend, ends up being emotionally primitive and socially\nimmature for his age. The chosen child reacts to his mother\nand she reacts to him. The reaction becomes generalized to\nthe whole family, and this child becomes the crusader, so to\nspeak, for maintaining the status quo. This reactivity leads\nto deepening of the fusion between mother and son, as the\nchild is being programmed to have similar values and tastes\nas his mother.\nMost family systems theorists find that the chosen child is\nisolated in childhood, and continues to be isolated in his\nadult life. They find, further, that as an adult, this person's\ninteractions with peers continue to be limited. As a product\nof limited opportunities to interact with his peers, the chosen\nchild is rendered, in essence, grossly limited as an adult\nAccording to Love (1990), chosen child grows up being\nunsure of what is acceptable or peer appropriate behaviors\nand what isn't. In addition, as said by Love, as an adult, the\nvictim of maternal enmeshment tends to be perfectionistic,\nand has a compulsive need to succeed. He will overcompen-\nsate in his efforts to appear at least normal. According to\nLove and Schwartzman (2006), because the chosen child has\nbeen in the spotlight of his mother's life for most, if not all,\nof his own life, he believes himself to be superior. They both\ncontend that it is not uncommon for this person to develop\nnarcissistic traits, if not full-blown narcissism. This sense of\nsuperiority may manifest itself in extreme efforts at outdoing\npeers in his professional life. He wants to earn more money\nthan . . .; garner greater recognition than . . . .\nDespite his tendency to over function in his interpersonal\nrelationships, this will be one area where the \"chosen child\"\nwill probably experience the greatest frustration (Williams\n& Hiebert, 2001). Here, the narcissist becomes very\ndismissing of others' feelings and seek out interpersonal\nrelationships that serve his own needs for superiority.\nNeedless to say, men who have been enmeshed with their\nmothers find it difficult to sustain meaningful interpersonal\nrelationships with peers. Generally over a short period of\ntime, the relationships will fizzle out for at least one of two\ncommon reasons--The chosen child will find another target\nto support his sense of superiority; or the mate of the chosen\nchild will eventually come to recognize the futility of a rela-\ntionship in which her partner over functions to promote\nmaintenance of the status quo, as opposed to engaging in an\nadaptive exercise of emotional give and take that defines\nmarriage. Realistically, any effort at a healthy relationship\nwith the chosen child is doomed from the very start, as these\nmen fear intimacy and commitment (Forward, 1989; Love,\n(1995) relayed accounts of their own clients who have\nthemselves been their mothers' chosen children. The gen-\neral consensus, it seems, is that these men have a difficult\ntime understanding the concept of freedom within interper-\nsonal relationships. Reportedly, these men also tend to view\nclose relationships as invasive. These same authors purport\nthat the likelihood of marriage for the male chosen child is\nslim. Marriage quality, according to Dickstein et al. (2004),\nis intimately linked with the quality of functioning in other\naspects of life. It stands to reason, then, that the likelihood\nof a healthy, adaptive marriage for these men might be\nsomewhere close to nil. Although male victims of maternal\nenmeshment do marry, the results, reportedly, are usually\nThe life transition inherent in what we define marriage to\nbe would pose a significant threat to the chosen child's iden-\ntity. The maternally enmeshed son is likely to be challenged\nby a role that implies a degree of equality, and therefore a\nrenegotiation of his position in the family system\n(Schwartzman, 2006). As the chosen child is accustomed to\nHann-Morrison 7\nbeing the center of his mother's attention, and has very little,\nif any, experience with equality, he naturally assumes center\nstage in the marital relationship. Remember, he is a narcis-\nsist, and will not tolerate being upstaged. His choice for a\nspouse, likely, will be someone to whom he feels he is superior\nin the first place. This person will dominate the marital rela-\ntionship, and will adhere vehemently to the family mythology\nof his inherent loftiness. Furthermore, he will adamantly deny\nany dysfunction in himself personally or in his family system.\nShould the chosen child's spouse resist or in any way chal-\nlenge her husband's maladaptive level of functioning, the cho-\nsen child will usually pit his mother against his wife. This,\naccording to Bradshaw (1989), is yet another incident of\nimmature reactivity. As the ensuing drama between wife and\nmother unfolds, the wife typically becomes the outlaw, and a\ndivorce is the end product (Love, 1990).\nDespite the tendency for abject failure at interpersonal\nrelationships, there is evidence to suggest that even the\nmaternally enmeshed child may, with personal and commit-\nted effort on his part and support from significant agents of\nchange, develop and sustain adaptive adult interpersonal\nrelationships. Dickstein et al. (2004) offered, for example,\nthat the presence and active participation of a secure and\nadaptively functioning partner/spouse may serve to offset the\neffects of negative childhood relational experiences.\nTheTherapeutic Setting\nIn considering offering therapeutic intervention to emanci-\npate the maternally enmeshed man, one must understand\nthat the enmeshed relationship between mother and son is\nthe product of bilateral interactions of need. Schwartzman\ntheorist over the span of decades have recognized that the\nenmeshed relationship is a co-construction between both\nties, they offer, contribute to the relationship's continuation.\nAlthough one might subsume, then, that emancipation of\nthe chosen child from the maladaptive grips of his enmeshed\nmother requires both parties, the fact is that emancipation\nis rarely the goal of both parties involved in such a relation-\nship (Schwartzman, 2006). Schwartzman offer that gener-\nally it is the chosen child who seeks to heal the relationship\nbetween he and an overpowering mother. The catalyst for\nthe chosen child to seek assistance is usually chronic anxi-\nety, depression, and an undeniable pattern of unhealthy and\nemotionally unrewarding interpersonal relationships (Love,\nAlthough it is possible for the chosen child to be emanci-\npated from his enmeshed mother, or from the undifferenti-\nated ego mass that is his family, more often than not the only\nemancipation that occurs is the chosen child from a wife who\nhas grown weary of the family fusion. For the chosen child,\nemancipation requires great effort--often more effort than\nthis person is willing to invest, or can muster. Emancipation\nrequires "
