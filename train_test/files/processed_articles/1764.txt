NHANES\nHispanic population was oversampled.17 Participants were\ninterviewed in their homes and underwent a standardized\nphysical examination in a mobile examination center.\nThe survey protocol was approved by the National Centers\nfor Health Statistics Ethics Review Board, and each partici-\npant provided written informed consent. Full details of\nthe NHANES are available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/\nnhanes.htm.\nResponse variables\nTrained interviewers questioned participants about their\nweight control using a computer-assisted personal interview-\ning system. The first outcome of interest was the dichot-\nomous variable desire to weigh less. Participants were asked,\n`Would you like to weigh more, less, or stay about the same?'\nWe created a dichotomous variable to identify participants\nwho desired to weigh less by combining participants who\ndesired to weigh more or stay about the same. The second\noutcome of interest was the dichotomous variable pursuit of\nweight control, defined as either trying to lose weight\nor doing anything to keep from gaining weight during the\npast 12 months. Participants who were categorized as\npursuing weight control and were further asked to report\nall of the ways they tried to lose weight or keep from gaining\nweight. We categorized these weight control strategies as (1)\ndietary changes, (2) physical activity or (3) other.\nExplanatory variables\nWe considered as covariates factors that could potentially\ninfluence weight management behavior: gender, race/ethni-\ncity, age, measured body mass index (BMI) and waist\ncircumference (WC) categories, perceived weight status and\nself-report of having a diagnosis of overweight/obese status,\ndiabetes, hypercholesterolemia, myocardial infarction and\nhypertension by an HCP. During the physical examination,\nparticipant weight and height were measured using\nstandardized procedures. BMI was calculated as measured\nweight in kilograms divided by measured height in meters\nX30 kg m\u00c02 obese.19 WC was categorized as high risk for\nmen with measured WC 4102 cm and women with\nmeasured WC 488 cm and low risk otherwise.19 Participants\nwere asked about their perceived weight status using the\nquestion, `Do you consider yourself now to be overweight,\nunderweight, or about the right weight?' Participants\nreported a diagnosis of overweight/obese status, diabetes,\nhypercholesterolemia, myocardial infarction or hyperten-\nsion by an HCP.\nStatistical analysis\nWe limited the study sample to non-pregnant adults age\n18 years or older. Pregnancy was determined either by\nparticipant report of pregnancy or a positive urine test. All\nanalyses used appropriate weights for 6 years of data from\nusing SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA),\nunless otherwise noted.\nFirst, we examined the prevalence of overweight and\nobesity and the demographics of the study population. Next,\nwe examined the prevalence of desire to weigh less and\npursuit of weight control overall and by population\nsubgroups. Results for men and women were reported\nseparately to highlight possible differences in weight control\nattempts and perceived weight status. Prevalence estimates\nand standard errors were calculated using Proc Surveyfreq.\nWe compared perceived body weight status (underweight,\nthe right weight and overweight self-perception) with\nmeasured BMI and WC categories. The prevalence of\nindividuals who have been diagnosed as overweight/obese\nwas calculated in the sub-population of those who had\nreported seeing an HCP within the past 12 months.\nThe associations between desire to weigh less, pursuit of\nweight control and perceived weight status were examined\nusing multivariable logistic regression. In these models,\nwhich were stratified by sex, we simultaneously controlled\nfor age, race/ethnicity, measured BMI category and HCP\ndiagnosis of overweight/obesity, diabetes, high blood cho-\nlesterol, heart attack and high blood pressure. Odds ratios\n(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated\nusing Proc Surveylogistic.\nFinally, we examined weight control practices in the\nsubgroup of overweight or obese adults who reported having\nseen an HCP in the past year. Collection of weight control\nwe used appropriate weights for 4 years of data from\nThe prevalences of dietary and physical activity weight\nWeight control among US adults\nS Yaemsiri et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\ncontrol strategies were reported overall and by HCP diag-\nnosis of overweight/obese status.\nSensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate whether\nthe observed associations in the multivariable logistic\nmodels were sensitive to including education level and\nannual family income, or replacing BMI category with\nWC category (to avoid collinearity), but no substantial\ndifferences were found.\nResults\nThe study analysis included 16 720 non-pregnant adults age\n18 years and older. All analyses used sampling weights\nto obtain prevalence estimates for US adults. About half\nApproximately one-third of US adults were overweight\nA large proportion of US adults, 64.3%, reported having a\ndesire to lose weight. There was a higher prevalence of desire\nto lose weight among women than men (73.2% women,\n55.1% men, Table 1). A desire to weigh less was reported by\nthe majority of those who perceived themselves as over-\nan HCP diagnosis of overweight/obesity (93.9% women,\n91.4% men). The prevalence of desire to weigh less was\nhigher among non-Hispanic whites than other racial/ethnic\ngroups. Approximately one half (48.2%) of normal weight\nwomen desired to weigh less. Among men, the prevalence\nof desire to weigh less was higher in the all subgroups\nwith an HCP diagnosis of a comorbidity than those without\na diagnosis. However, among women, those with an HCP\ndiagnosis of heart attack had a lower prevalence of desire to\nweigh less.\nEven though 64.3% of US adults desired to weigh less, a\nlower proportion reported pursuing weight control (48.4%\nlower proportion reported trying to lose weight (37.0%\npattern for desire to lose weight, a greater proportion of\nwomen reported pursuing weight control than men. Large\nproportions of US adults with an HCP diagnosis of over-\nmen) pursued weight control. The prevalence of pursuit of\nweight control was greater among younger (o55 years) than\nolder (X55 years) women, but was similar between older and\nyounger men. Although prevalence of desire to weigh less\nincreased with BMI category, the prevalence of pursuit of\nweight control did not increase as substantially among\nhigher BMI categories. Less than half of men and women in\nthe normal weight BMI category or low-risk WC category\nreported pursuing weigh control. Similarly, less than half of\nmen with a diagnosis of high blood pressure, diabetes or\nheart attack pursued weight control.\nDiscrepancies exist between measured and perceived\nweight category among overweight men and women\n(Table 3). Almost one half (48.1%) of overweight men\nperceived themselves as having the right weight. One in\neight (13.0%) obese men perceived that they had the right\nweight and almost one in five (17.9%) normal weight men\nperceived themselves as underweight. Conversely, one\nquarter (23.4%) of normal weight women perceived them-\nselves as overweight. The sex differences in the validity of\nperceived body weight decreased when using WC categories,\nrather than BMI categories for measured weight categories.\nApproximately one in six men and women with high-risk\nWCs incorrectly perceive themselves to have about the\nright weight. One-third (32.3%) of low-risk women and\none-fourth of low-risk (25.5%) men perceive themselves to\nbe overweight.\nTable 1 Prevalence of desire to weigh less among US adults, NHANES\nDesired to weigh less, % (s.e.)\nAge\nRace/ethnicity\nBMI category\nWC category\nPerceived body weight\nHCP diagnosis versus no. diagnosis of c\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; HCP, health care professional; NHANES,\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; ref, reference; WC, waist\ncircumference. aEstimates are weighted row percents (s.e.).

Women with overweight self-perception had\nmen with overweight self-perception had 32 times higher\ncompared with those who perceived themselves as having\nthe right weight. A positive association was observed\nbetween overweight self-perception and pursuit of weight\nto weigh less and pursuit of weight control were associated\npositively with an HCP diagnosis of overweight/obesity and\nhigh blood cholesterol independent of weight category in\nmen and women. Increasing age was inversely associated\nwith desire to weigh less and pursuit of weight control\nin both men and women.\nInterestingly, a large proportion of overweight/obese\nindividuals were never diagnosed as overweight/obese\nby an HCP. Among individuals in the overweight BMI\ncategory, 69% of women and 78% of overweight men were\nnever diagnosed as overweight/obese by an HCP (Table 3).\nImportantly, 27% of obese women and 31% of obese men\nremain undiagnosed as overweight/obese. Almost half of\nthose in the high-risk WC category were never told they were\noverweight by an HCP.\nAlthough the majority of overweight or obese adults\npursued at least one weight management activity (73.5%\nwomen, 60.3% men, Table 5), fewer pursued both diet and\nobese individuals who were diagnosed as overweight/obese\nby an HCP had a higher prevalence of pursuing weight\ncontrol than those without a diagnosis. Similarly, among\noverweight men and women, those diagnosed as over-\nweight/obese by an HCP were more likely to diet, exercise\nor pursue both. However, about 18% of women and 26% of\nmen made aware of their overweight status by an HCP did\nnot use any weight control strategies.\nDiscussion\nIn a recent nationally representative survey, three in five US\nadults desired to weigh less and one in two pursued weight\ncontrol. We observed substantial discrepancies between\nmeasured and perceived weight status, particularly among\nmales and those in the overweight BMI category. Overweight\nperception and HCP diagnosis of overweight/obesity were\npositively associated with desire to lose weight and pursuit of\nweight control, independent of measured weight status.\nAmong overweight or obese individuals, those diagnosed\nas overweight/obese by an HCP were more likely to make\ndietary changes, exercise, or pursue both. However, the\nmajority of overweight individuals were never made aware of\ntheir overweight status by an HCP.\nthat the rate of increase has stabilized.20 The prevalence of\npursuit of weight control follows the obesity trend through\nthe mid-1990s. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor\nSurveillance System, the prevalence of attempted weight loss\nattributed this increasing trend to the increasing prevalence\nof obesity in the population.

Although the\nprevalence of obesity continued to increase slightly over\nthis time period, it seems the prevalence of desire to weigh\nless may have stabilized among men and decreased among\nwomen.\nTable 2 Prevalence of pursuit of weight control among US adults, NHANES\nPursuing weight control, % (s.e.)\nAge\nRace/ethnicity\nBMI category\nWC category\nPerceived body weight\nHCP diagnosis versus no. diagnosis of c\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; HCP, health care professional; NHANES,\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; ref, reference; WC, waist\ncircumference. aEstimates are weighted row percents (s.e.).

Among overweight US adults, 11%\nabout the right weight.23 These results suggest that that\nmisperceptions of weight status may be increasing. The high\nprevalence of overweight and obesity in the US may make\nthe condition appear `normal' as evident by an upward shift\nin desired weight among Americans.24\u00ad26 One study of\nweight perception in Great Britain also reported a marked\ndecline in sensitivity in an individual's overweight status.27\nTable 3 Validity of perceived body weight status and diagnosis of overweight/obese status as compared with measured body mass index and waist circumference\ncategories\nBMI categories BMI Perceived body weight status, % (s.e.)

On average, men tend to over-report their weight,\nexpressing a desire to report a higher body mass.28 Among\nwomen, societal pressures, such as advertisement and mass\nmedia, and cultural norms may contribute to pushing\nmisperception of body weight in the opposite direction as\nthat of men. Of note, use of BMI categories as the `gold\nstandard' with which to compare weight perception may\ncontribute to the idea that weight misperception occurs\npredominately among men.29 BMI standardizes body weight\naccording to height, but does not distinguish between lean\nand fat tissues or provide information on body fat\npatterning. Individuals with high muscle mass, particularly\nmen, may be misclassified as overweight using BMI\ncategories.30 In contrast to BMI, WC has sex-specific cut\npoints and is a measure of visceral adiposity. Both the gender\ndifferences and misperceptions were less pronounced in\nour examination of weight perception with respect to\nWC categories than with respect to BMI categories.\nStill, approximately one in six men and women with\nhigh-risk WC's perceived themselves to have the right\nweight. Body weight dissatisfaction is associated with greater\nintentions to change weight, physical activity or diet.24\nIncorrect perception of weight status is of concern, as our\nresults support the mounting evidence that indicates\noverweight self-perception is an important predictor of\nPositive associations between overweight self-perception\nand pursuit of weight control have been previously reported\nto examine the association independent of measured weight\nstatus.

The Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study was\nable to control for measured BMI. Investigators reported\nincreased odds of intending to change physical condition\nand diet among men and women who had body dissatisfac-\ntion in all measured BMI categories.24 However, this study\nwas conducted in a predominately white, middle-to-upper\nclass cohort that may not be generalizable to the US\npopulation. Overall, these studies contribute to the growing\nliterature on the positive association between overweight\nself-perception and pursuit of weight control and emphasize\nthe need to correct weight perception. The positive associa-\ntion between having a diagnosis of high blood cholesterol\nand pursuit of weight control may be due to the clearly\nrecommended lifestyle changes, including weight loss in\noverweight patients, for the treatment of high blood\nOpportunities to educate patients about weight mainte-\nnance in clinical settings remain insufficiently used.35\nDespite an increasing prevalence of obesity, the proportion\nof obese individuals who received advice to lose weight\nmany barriers to providing weight maintenance counseling,\nincluding a focus on treating acute illnesses rather than\nproviding preventive care, lack of time and inadequate\ntraining. However, obese individuals may be seeking direct\nand specific information from HCPs about weight control.37\nAmong older populations and those with comorbidities,\npoor health or a lack of time or energy may contribute to\nmaking weight loss seem unachievable. HCPs can counsel\npatients that even modest weight reductions of 5\u00ad10% may\nimprove blood pressure, serum lipid levels, glucose toler-\nance, and reduce incidence of diabetes and hypertension.4\nA multidisciplinary team consisting of a primary-care\nphysician, behavioral psychologist, registered dietitian\nand exercise psychologist may aid in the treatment of\nWeight control practices, % (s.e)a Overweight or obeseb Overweight or obese womenb Overweight or obese menb\nHCP diagnosisc HCP diagnosisc\nAbbreviations: HCP, health care professional; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. aEstimates are weighted column percentages (s.e.).\nbBody mass index X25 kg m\u00c02, based on measured height and weight. cHeath care professional diagnosis of overweight/obesity only among those who have seen a\ndoctor in the past year. *Pp0.05 for weight control practice among those with HCP diagnosis versus no HCP diagnosis.\nWeight control among US adults\nS Yaemsiri et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nobesity.38,39 Health professionals who wish to incorporate\nobesity counseling into their practice may find these\nNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Clinical Guide-\nlines recommend the combination of reduced calorie diet\nand increased physical activity to produce weight loss,\ndecrease abdominal fat and increase cardio\u00adrespiratory\nfitness.19 Our analysis showed that 460% of overweight or\nobese adults pursued at least one weight management\nstrategy, but o40% pursued both changes in diet and\nphysical activity. Similarly, Bish et al. reported that among\nindividuals trying to lose weight, fewer (13% women and\n16% men) combined reduced calories with at least 200 min\nper week of physical activity.42 In addition to correcting\nweight perception, HCPs have an opportunity to educate\noverweight or obese patents about healthy weight loss\nstrategies and normal weight patients about healthy weight\nmaintenance strategies. Other weight loss strategies exist,\nsuch as bariatric surgery or use of prescription drugs, but\nwere not examined in analysis as being a practical lifestyle\nchange regardless of weight status.\nA major strength of our study is the use of a nationally\nrepresentative sample rather than a sample of selected obese\npatients seeking medical care, which may not be general-\nizable to overweight individuals who are unaware of their\nweight status. In addition, use of standardized measurements\nof height, weight and WC provided reliable information\nabout a participant's measured weight status.\nThe limitations of this study were primarily in self-report\nof diagnosis of health outcomes and pursuit of weight\ncontrol. Self-reported diagnosis of overweight status may be\nsubject to recall bias if those who perceive themselves to\nbe overweight were more likely to report a diagnosis of\noverweight/obesity. It is possible that we overestimated the\neffect of overweight perception on pursuit of weight control\nif those in higher weight groups were also more likely to over\nreport weight control attempts. The cross-sectional study\ndesign of the NHANES did not allow us to examine if\noverweight perception was associated with successful weight\nloss. Use of BMI as a measure of the high risk form of obesity\nmay misclassify physically fit individuals with dense muscle\nmass as overweight. We addressed this limitation by\nadditionally using WC as a measure of obesity. Finally, the\nmajority of excess deaths due to overweight occur among\nindividuals o70 years of age.1 Weight loss counseling should\nbe approached with caution among those older than X70\nyears as this population may not benefit from weight loss or\nhave special dietary needs and physical limitations that may\nprevent vigorous physical activity or make weight loss\nIn conclusion, we report that overweight perception and\nHCP diagnosis of overweight/obesity were positively asso-\nciated with weight control attempts in US adults. A diagnosis\nof overweight/obesity may correct weight perception\nand provide motivation to adopt healthy weight control\npractices.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n"
