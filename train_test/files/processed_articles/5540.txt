As a result, 59 environmentally\nrelevant agents in the NTP toxicity database were assessed for their capacity to affect\nhormetic dose responses for growth as measured by change: in weight gain.

Recent publications have revealed that\nhormesis is highly generalizable according to agent, biological model, and endpoint\nsearch has indicated that hormetic effects may be seen in up to 40% of toxicological\nexperiments that satisfy a prioristudy design requirements (Calabrese and Baldwin,\n2001 b) and are more common than the traditional threshold model in a substan-\ntial direct comparison (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003). Because study designs that\ninclude a substantial number of dosages are more likely to have the opportunity to\nassess hormetic phenomena, it is suggested that the dose-range-finding studies of\nthe National Toxicology Program (NTP) may offer potential to explore honnetic re-\nsponses because these experiments typically contain a current control and five doses.\nConsequently, this paper evaluates the occurrence ofhonnetic dose responses within\nthe NTP database for dose-range-finding experiments.\nDatabase Selection\nThe NTP toxicity database is a highly systematic and substantial government-\nmandated toxicological program.

The capacity for an experiment to demonstrate hormesis was assessed by\ncomparing the summation ofpointvalues to point ranges establishedfor six evidence\ncategories: high, moderate-high, moderate, low-moderate, low, and no-low.\nTable 2.

The honnetic observations in these NTP\nrange-finding studies demonstrate the significance of study design features in the\nE.J. Calabrese and L. A. Baldwin\nassessment ofpossible hormetic dose-response relationships. In the present case, the\ndose-range-finding studies of the NTP typically employed five dosages along with a\nconcurrent control. The dosage selection was also focused on trying to estimate the\nhighest dosages that could be administered over a normal experimental lifetime.\nThese two factors [i.e., number of dosages, and their intention to discern a possible\ndosage that would approximate a chronic no adverse effect level (NOAEL)] en-\nhanced the chances of observing hormetic dose response. The additional dosages\nare critical to demonstrate a dose-response pattern consistent with the hormetic\nmodel. The attempt to identify a quasi NOAEL is also important because it provides\nan opportunity to denote the dose-response transition from a hormetic response,\njust below the NOAEL, and the traditional toxic response as the NOAEL is exceeded.\nWhile the dose-range studies of the NTP offered the aforementioned study de-\nsign advantages, it also had important limitations especially with respect to endpoint\nselection. Because the mice and rats were very young and the studies were of limited\nduration (2-13 weeks), disease incidences were not expected to increase and typically\ndid not occur, thereby precluding a \"ide range of toxicological endpoint compar-\nisons. Nonetheless, during this developmental period there are notable changes in\ngrowth patterns as reflected in changes in body-weight gain. The body-weight-gain\npattern is also one that represents an integration of overall developmental progress\nand offers important insight for biomedical and toxicological interpretation.\nThe quantitative features of the hormetic dose-response patterns were similar to\nthose reported in previously published studies for various biological models, end-\npoints, and other chronic agents. This was the case for both the magnitude of the\nstimulation and the stimulatory range.\nThe findings revealed that honnetic responses were more common in mice, es-\npecially in males, than in rats. While there is no explanation to yet account for these\nobservations it may have both biological as well as study design considerations.\nDespite the large number of examples of hormetic dose-response relationships\npresented and the relatively strong NTP study designs assessed in the present paper, it\nis important to emphasize that the magnitude of the honnetic stimulation is modest.\nThis places special need on not only the quality of the study design but also the need\n[or replication of findings, a feature generally absent in the NTP bioassay database.\nSuch lack of replication limits confidence in the observed findings and the hormetic\ninterpretation.\nFinally, the observation that the enhanced weight gain at low dosages was not\naccounted for by an increased consumption of feed is intriguing (Figs. 3A-H). Al-\nthough of a preliminary nature, it suggests that at the low dosages where hormetic\nresponses were observed there may have been an enhanced efficiency in the utiliza-\ntion of consumed nutrients. The issue of growth stimulation by low doses of other\nand diethylstilbestrol (DES) (Nicol and Ware, 1960) has long been recognized. Al-\nthough their dose-response features are similar to the findings of the present study,\nHormesis at the National Toxicology Program\nno clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have been\nclarified.\nREFERENCES\nCalabrese, EJ, and Baldwin, L (1997).
