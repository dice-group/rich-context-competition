Datasets included National Health\nInterview Survey (NHIS): 1997\u00ad2003, the first National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey, Alameda County\nHealth Study (ACHS), Tecumseh Community Health Study (TCHS), and Women's Health Initiative (WHI). The women\n(220,370 in total) were aged 18 years or older and had reported their headache or migraine status.\nResults: Using nonlinear regression techniques and models adjusted for age, race, and smoking, we found that\nincreased BMI was generally associated with increased likelihood of headache or severe headache among women.\nA BMI of ~20 was associated with the lowest risk of headache. Relative to a BMI of 20, mild obesity (BMI of 30) was\nassociated with roughly a 35% increase in the odds for experiencing headache whereas severe obesity (BMI of\n40) was associated with roughly an 80% increase in odds. Results were essentially unchanged when models were\nfurther adjusted for socioeconomic variables, alcohol consumption, and hypertension. Being diagnosed with migraine\nshowed no association with BMI.\nDiscussion: Among US women, a BMI of ~20 (about the 5th percentile) was associated with the lowest likelihood\nof headache. Consistently across studies, obese women had significantly increased risk for headache. By contrast,\nthe risk for diagnosed migraine headache per se was not obviously related to BMI. The direction of causation and\nmechanisms of action remain to be determined.\nIntroduction\nVarious forms of headache (e.g., chronic daily headache,\ntension-type headache, migraine headache) are disabling\nconditions (1\u00ad3) that, compared to other common pain con-\nditions, produce the greatest loss of productive time in the US\nworkforce (2). Because the prevalence of the different forms\nof headache varies widely in published studies (e.g., 1.3\u00ad86%\nfor tension-type headache (1)) it is difficult both to derive a\ndefinitive estimate and to assess whether the headache preva-\nlence has changed over time (4,5). Headache has been shown\nto be associated with breathing disorders, caffeine consump-\ntion, alcohol consumption, hypertension, anxiety, and depres-\nsive disorders (6). Emerging evidence from case\u00adcontrol (6,7)\nand observational studies (8\u00ad10) suggests that increased BMI\n(kg/m2) might be a risk factor for headache.\nIn this study we estimate the association between BMI\nand headache among adult women using data from several\nlarge publicly available epidemiologic datasets. We restricted\nour analyses to women because it has been established that\nheadache prevalence is much higher among women (3), and\npreliminary unpublished data suggested that obesity's associa-\ntion with headache varied substantially depending on gender.\nThis is consistent with the different associations observed for\nmen and women between obesity and a variety of health issues\n(11\u00ad14). Rather than analyzing a single dataset and issuing the\nnear ubiquitous call for replication in the discussion, to evalu-\nate the reproducibility of results and show how results might\nchange as a function of study-related factors, we opted to ana-\nlyze multiple data sets using identical statistical procedures.\nThis allowed us to derive estimates of the magnitude of the\nBMI-headache association across all publicly available epide-\nmiologic datasets meeting a set of inclusion criteria.\nMethods and procedures\nInclusion criteria for datasets\nTo rigorously evaluate the association between BMI and head-\nache among women, we used cross-sectional epidemiologic datasets\nthat met the following requirements: (i) they must be large enough\n1Section on Statistical Genetics and Clinical Nutrition Research Center, Department of Biostatistics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA;\n2Department of Epidemiology and Clinical Investigation Sciences, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, USA; 3Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine,\nJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; 4Department of Biostatistics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama,\nUSA.

The search among these resources\nyielded 11 datasets that met the criteria for inclusion in our analyses.\nOverview of datasets used\nWe briefly describe here and in Table 1 the characteristics of the 11\ndatasets used in our analysis.\nThe Alameda County Health Study (ACHS) followed adults\nselected in 1965 to represent the non-institutionalized population of\nAlameda County California (15). Data collected included self-reported\n\ndemographic information, as well as physical, cognitive, psychological,\nand social functioning.\nThe Tecumseh Community Health Study (TCHS), initiated in 1959,\ninvestigates health and disease determinants in the rural community of\nTecumseh, Michigan. Participants completed extensive questionnaires\nand medical examinations (16).\nin 1969, is a continuing nationwide survey of the US civilian non-\n\ninstitutionalized population conducted in households on a yearly basis\n(17). A probability sample of households is interviewed each year.\nDetailed information on the health of each living member of the sample\nhousehold is obtained.\nTheFirstNationalHealthandNutritionExaminationSurvey(NHANES\nindividuals aged 1\u00ad74 years.

BMI (kg/m2) was the predictor variable of primary interest\nand was calculated from either measured or self-reported (NHIS only)\nweight and height. Self-reported weight has been shown to correlate\nvery highly with measured weight (20). BMI is largely independent of\nheight (r  -0.03), strongly related to weight (r  0.86), and reasonably\ncorrelated with body fatness (21).\nOutcomes variables. The datasets varied somewhat with regard to\nhow headache was assessed (see Table 2). We recoded and dichoto-\nmized headache outcomes so that 0 = absence of an indicator of severe\nor frequent headache or migraine versus 1 = presence of an indicator of\nsevere or frequent headache or migraine.\nCovariates. Data on age, race, and smoking status were included in\nthe primary analyses (i.e., the primary models) as covariates. We also\nincluded socioeconomic status variables (income, education, and\nemployment status), alcohol consumption, and hypertension as covari-\nates in our secondary analyses (i.e., the extended models).\nMissing data. Missing data were handled using list-wise deletion (22)\nbecause more complex missing data management procedures would\nimpose a significantly greater computational demand on an already\ncomputationally demanding set of analyses. Furthermore, the complex\nsampling designs of datasets, most notably the NHIS, would create\nadditional statistical issues related to imputation. Although there was\nno reason to hypothesize that \"missingness\" was systematically related\nto the study variables, we noted two datasets in which some study vari-\nables were missing information in at least 5% of records. In these data-\nsets, we fitted logistic regression models for each variable that had such\n\"missingness\" (>5%) to test for a relationship between missingness,\ncoded as a binary dependent variable and the other study variables as\npossible predictors.\nStatistical analysis\nTraditionally, analyses of the association between BMI and dichoto-\nmous outcomes such as mortality or the presence/absence of a given\nmedical condition have been estimated by treating BMI as either a\ncontinuous or categorical variable (23). Each approach has advan-\ntages and \ndisadvantages. Advantages of treating BMI as a continuous\n\nvariable include the fact that it does not degrade the data, tends to\npreserve power, and does not impose arbitrary cutoff points. Rather,\nTable 1Description of epidemiologic datasets used\nStudy Composition of sample\nDates of\nstudy\nFemale\n(%)\nAge at entry\n(years)\nWeight and\nheight\nWhite\n(%)\nNational Health Interview\nContinuous nationwide household survey of\nthe civilian non-institutionalized US population\nWomen's Health Initiative\nObservational Study (WHI)\nWomen ineligible for clinical trial components\nenrolled from 40 US centers\nNational Health and\nNutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES I)\nCollects information about the health and\nlifestyle of a nationally representative sample of\nthe civilian non-institutionalized US population\nAlameda County Health\nStudy (ACHS)\nTecumseh County Health\nStudy (TCHS)\narticles\nepidemiology\none can adjust for curvature in data via the incorporation of polyno-\nmials of BMI into the model. The major advantage of treating BMI\nas a categorical variable, with the categories chosen a priori, is the\n(seeming) ease of communication of the results and the allowance for\nmarked nonlinearity that may not be easily captured by polynomials.\nThe nonlinear regression we used offers an alternative that captures\nthe advantages of treating BMI as both a continuous and categorical\nvariable (24). Specifically, we applied piecewise linear free knot spline\nlogistic regression models that do not assume a linear relationship\nbetween BMI and headache and allow for fitting \"breakpoints\" in\nthe logit function at so-called knots that may be interpreted to define\ncategories (24). Thus, these data-driven models can take into account\npotential nonlinearity by determining BMI categories for contiguous\nBMI groupings of individuals with like patterns of risk while, at the\nsame time, allowing individuals with different BMI in a category to\nhave different levels of risk estimated as a function of their BMI. In\nbrief, we fitted nonlinear models to each dataset, used a parametric\nbootstrap procedure to select the optimal spline model for BMI, and\nthen used a non-parametric bootstrap procedure to calculate accurate\ns.e. estimates and confidence intervals that adjusted for complex sam-\nple design features. More details on the nonlinear statistical modeling\nare contained in Supplementary Data 1.\nTwo analyses were conducted on each dataset: primary and secondary.\nIn the primary analyses, we adjusted for age, race, and smoking status.\nIn secondary analyses, we assessed an extended model that adjusted\nfor the aforementioned covariates as well as socioeconomic variables,\nalcohol consumption, and hypertension. For the purposes of compar-\ning models within each dataset, the number of knot parameters fitted\nin the extended model was fixed at the number of knots found in the\nprimary model.\nWe excluded BMI values <14 and >90 to avoid possible outlier\neffects and data recording errors. After exclusions, a total of 220,370\nrespondents from the 11 datasets were available for statistical \nanalyses.\nResults were presented as parameter estimates with bootstrapped s.e.\nintervals. We also plotted odds ratios (ORs) for\ngraphically demonstrating the shapes of relationships we found and\ncalculated ORs and confidence intervals at selected BMI values (i.e.,\nof the 11 datasets. Supplementary Data 2 provides the details for cal-\nculating ORs from our results.\nResults\nTable 3 and Figure 1 present the piecewise logistic regression\nresults for the primary model (i.e., adjusted for age, race, and\nsmoking) for each of the 11 datasets. Increased BMI was gen-\nerally associated with increased risk for headache or severe\nheadache among women. Moreover, results from the NHIS\n\"breakpoints\" (knots) in the logit function around a BMI of\n20 suggesting that the relationship between increased BMI and\nthe risk of headache may change significantly at this point. As\nshown in Figure 1, our models often predicted that a BMI of\n~20 was associated with the lowest risk for severe and/or fre-\nquent headaches. The NHIS 1997 data also produced a sec-\nond knot at a BMI of ~35. At this point, the increased risk for\nheadache with increased BMI significantly decelerated sug-\ngesting that people with a BMI >35 may share the same level\nof headache risk with respect to BMI. The risk associated with\ndiagnosed migraine headache (as assessed in the WHI) or with\ntaking medication for headache (as assessed in NHANES I)\nwere not significantly related to BMI.\nTable 4 and Figure 1 present the results for the extended\nmodels (i.e., the primary models extended to include socio-\neconomic status variables, alcohol consumption, and hyper-\ntension as covariates). As can be seen, these estimates were\nTable 2The coding of headache among the 11 datasets\nDataset Question Response options\nNational Health Interview Survey\n\"During the PAST THREE MONTHS, did you\nhave ... severe headache or migraine?\"\nYes\nNo\nRefused\nNot ascertained\nDon't know\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES I)\n\"During the past 6 months have you used any\nmedicine, drugs or pills for headache?\"\nCoded and analyzed in two ways:\n(no = 0; occasionally and regularly = 1)\n(no and occasionally = 0; regularly = 1)\nRegularly\nOccasionally\nNo\nBlank\nWomen's Health Initiative (WHI) \"Has a doctor told you that you have any of the\nfollowing conditions?\"\nMigraine headache\nAlameda County Health Study (ACHS) \"Have you had frequent headaches during the\nYes\nNo\nNo answer\nTecumseh Community Health Study (TCHS) (If gets headaches) do they bother you just a little\nor quite a bit?\n(0,1,2 coded as absence of headache and\n0.

We chose a BMI of 20 as the reference level because\nit was the most common nadir (i.e., the value most often asso-\nciated with the lowest probability of reporting headache)\nacross the datasets, thus making the computed ORs >1 in most\ncases. This allowed us to present results on a consistent scale\nfor visually comparing ORs across the datasets we examined.\nTable 3Piecewise logistic regression primary model\nresultsa\nStudy\nSample\nsize\nParameter\nestimate s.e.\n(bootstrapped)\n BMI slope\n (low)b\n BMI slope\n (mid)b\n BMI slope\n (high)b\n BMI slope\n (low)\n Knot\n BMI slope\n (high)\n BMI slope\n (low)\n Knot\n BMI slope\n (high)\nACHS\n BMI slope\n (low)\n Knot\n BMI slope\n (high)\nWHI\naAdjusted for age, race, and smoking status; bBMI was divided into 1, 2, or 3\ncontiguous segments (depending on the number of knots in the model--0, 1, or\n2, respectively) and will have an estimate of the linear rate of change in log odds\nof headache per segment: low, mid, high; cKnots were entered into the model\nand retained only if they contributed significantly to model fit at significance level\n0.05; d100% white; eEmployment status for men only and not adjusted for smok-\ning as nearly 60% of records are missing that data.\nTable 4Piecewise logistic regression extended model\nresultsa\nStudy\nSample\nsize\nParameter\nestimate s.e.\n(bootstrapped)\n BMI Slope\n (low)b\n BMI Slope\n (mid)b\n BMI Slope\n (high)b\n BMI Slope\n (low)\n Knot\n BMI Slope\n (high)\n BMI Slope\n (low)\n Knot\n BMI Slope\n (high)\nACHS\n BMI Slope\n (low)\n Knot\n BMI Slope\n (high)\nWHI\nNHANES I, First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; NHIS,\nNational Health Interview Survey; TCHS, Tecumseh Community Health Study;\nWHI, Women's Health Initiative.\naAdjusted for age, race, smoking status, alcohol consumption, hypertension,\nand SES variables; bBMI was divided into 1, 2, or 3 contiguous segments\n(depending on the number of knots in the model--0, 1, or 2, respectively) and will\nhave an estimate of the linear rate of change in log odds of headache per seg-\nment: low, mid, high; cExtended models were fit with the same number of knots\nas the primary model; d100% whites; eEmployment status for men only and not\nadjusted for smoking as ~60% of records are missing that data.\narticles\nepidemiology\nYou can see that among women with BMI >20 the ORs were\nmostly statistically significant and exhibited a similar increas-\ning pattern in headache risk across 9 of our 11 datasets. For\nexample, among the NHIS results: as compared to a BMI of\n20, we estimated that mild obesity (BMI of 30) was associ-\nated with an increase in the odds of reporting the presence\nof headache ranging from 31 to 65%, whereas severe obesity\n(BMI of 40) was associated with an increase in the odds that\nWe found that only NHANES I and TCHS had variables\nthat were missing information from at least 5% of records.\nSmoking information was available in only ~40% of the\nNHANES I women participants and was removed from\nthe analyses presented here. Analyses including smokers in\nNHANES I produced the same nonsignificant results (data\nnot shown). The missing data regarding smoking was asso-\nciated with decreased BMI, decreased age, income below\n$20,000, not being a current drinker, and hypertension.\nHypertension was missing in 23% of women in NHANES I\nand this \"missingness\" was associated with taking headache\nmedication, increased age, being white, having attended\ngraduate school, earning over $20,000, having ever been an\nalcohol drinker, and increased BMI (data not shown). In\nthe TCHS data, missing information on income (22%) was\nassociated with increased age; missing information on hyper-\ndecreased BMI; and missing information on BMI (5%) was\nassociated with having headaches (data not shown).\nTable 5Odds ratiosa and 95% confidence intervals across selected BMI values for the primary and extended models\nBMI (kg/m2)\nPrimary model\nExtended model\nACHS, Alameda County Health Study; NHANES I, First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; NHIS, National Health Interview Survey; TCHS, Tecumseh\nCommunity Health Study; WHI, Women's Health Initiative.\naCompared to the BMI reference level of 20.\nOdds ratio\nBMI\nTCHS\nLegend:\nAdjusted for age,\nrace, smoking\nFurther adjusted\nfor SES, alcohol\nconsumption, and\nhypertension\nFigure 1 Odds ratios for headaches in women by BMI (reference BMI = 20).\narticles\nepidemiology\nDiscussion\nIn this set of analyses of 11 different, large datasets collectively\nBMI was generally associated with significantly increased risk\nof headache, but not diagnosed migraines. We note that our\nresults across all datasets, with the exceptions of WHI (diag-\nnosed migraines) and NHANES I (taking headache medica-\ntion), suggested that, as compared to a BMI of 20, mild obesity\n(BMI of 30) was associated with an ~35% increase in the odds\nof reporting headache whereas severe obesity (BMI of 40) was\nassociated with an ~80% increase in the odds of reporting\nheadache. Across the databases, a BMI of ~20 was commonly\nassociated with the lowest risk for headache. These results were\nnot materially altered when socioeconomic variables, alcohol\nconsumption, and hypertension were also included in the\nmodel.\nWith regard to migraine headache, the results from our\nprimary model of the WHI data, the only dataset that explic-\nitly assessed migraine headache diagnosis, suggested that\nBMI may not be associated with migraine, but our extended\nmodel revealed a slight negative association. It is noteworthy\nthat many people with migraines go undiagnosed. Therefore,\nthe relationship between BMI and diagnosed migraines is not\nlikely to reflect the BMI relationship with all migraines (both\ndiagnosed and undiagnosed). Our main conclusion that BMI\nwas associated with an increased likelihood of headaches is\nbased on the following logic: (i) the WHI analysis showed no\npositive correlation between BMI and diagnosed migraines,\nand this is a finding of consequence because of the large WHI\nsample; (ii) the NHIS analyses showed a positive association\nbetween BMI and \"headaches or migraines\"; (iii) the ACHS\nand TCHS showed a positive association between BMI and\n\"headaches\" which were probably interpreted by most partici-\npants to include migraines; (iv) finding (i) suggested that there\nwas no association between BMI and diagnosed migraines in\nour NHIS, ACHS and TCHS analyses; and (v) so we concluded\nthat the findings in NHIS, ACHS and TCHS suggest that BMI\nwas associated with non-migraine headaches and possibly\nundiagnosed migraine.\nMost of the databases we analyzed individually provided\nample statistical power to detect the estimated effect sizes we\nobserved. That, along with the consistency of the results, obvi-\nated the need to conduct a formal meta-analysis. Our find-\nings clarify and accord with previous studies. Specifically,\nafter adjusting for age, gender, race, and education, Scher and\ncolleagues (6) found that obesity was associated with preva-\nlent chronic daily headache (OR = 1.34). Similarly, Ohayon\n(10) and colleagues found that overweight/obese (BMI > 27)\nrespondents were more likely to report morning headache\nthan were adults with BMIs 20\u00ad25 and among a sample of\nthat obese persons were more likely to report headache (OR =\n1.47). Also, consistent with our primary model \nanalysis of\nWHI data, Bigal and colleagues (8) using data from over\n30,000 participants, found that BMI was not associated with\nmigraine prevalence.\nInterestingly, we observed some evidence in four datasets\nmay be associated with increased risk for headache. These\nresults suggest that increased BMI may be associated with\ndecreased risk of headache among the category of women with\na BMI <20 and increased risk of headache among those with a\nBMI >20. This finding should be interpreted with caution since\nthe association was statistically significant at the 0.05 level only\nsince only ~5% of all study participants had BMI values <20, we\nmay have lacked sufficient power to reliably detect the elevated\nrisk levels estimated to be associated with low BMI across stud-\nies. To our knowledge, low BMI, in the absence of major illness\n(e.g., cancer), has not been previously associated with reports\nof headache. Nonetheless, this finding merits further investiga-\ntion before definitive conclusions can be drawn.\nNine out of the eleven datasets we examined had no study\nvariables missing >3% data, so any resulting effects from miss-\ningness were likely to be minimal in these cases. In NHANES I\nand TCHS where we saw higher levels of missing data for some\nvariables it was less clear what, if any, effects missing values\nmight have had on our results. Interestingly, in TCHS, those\nreporting headache were ~80% more likely to be missing BMI\ndata than those not reporting headache, but we cannot know\nhow this would influence the significant linear relationship we\ndetected between BMI and headache. Considering the results\navailable from the more complete datasets (i.e., NHIS 1997\u00ad\n2003 and ACHS) and the similarity of those results to those\nfrom TCHS, missingness may not have significantly affected\nthe TCHS results.\nThe mechanisms that might be responsible for the obesity\u00ad\nheadache association are unclear. However, obesity is asso-\nciated with the metabolic syndrome, a pro-inflammatory,\npro-thrombotic state that may contribute to headache devel-\nopment and progression (25,26). Headache is also related to\nsleep apnea, a condition highly associated with obesity (27).\nHypertension is also associated with headache (28) and obesity\nis a major risk factor for hypertension (29). Moreover, head-\nache is one of the side effects of many medications, including\nsibutramine, a medication to treat obesity (30). Each of these\noffers a hypothesis meriting further study.\nThis study has limitations. First, the headache-related ques-\ntions in the datasets differed, in some cases substantially. For\nexample, the WHI headache question focused on migraine\nheadache and asked, \"Has a doctor told you that you have\n\"migraine\"?\" By contrast, the NHANES headache question\ndid not ask whether the respondent suffered from head-\nache but, rather, whether they used medication for headache\n(\"During the past 6 months have you used any medicine,\ndrugs or pills for headache?\"). Although we coded the head-\nache variables in the datasets to create uniformity in out-\ncome variables (see Table 2), these two datasets (WHI and\nNHANES I) which asked about headache in a way related to\ndiagnosis or treatment are the only two that did not detect\nclear and statistically \nsignificant associations. The assess-\nment of headache in the other datasets focused primarily on\narticles\nepidemiology\nthe presence/frequency/severity of headaches. Second, we\nonly considered cross-\nsectional datasets as they were more\nwidely available and different statistical methodology would\nbe required to analyze longitudinal data. Hence, our analy-\nses were restricted to headache or migraine status concur-\nrent with BMI status. We did not look at data on subjects\nwho were free of headache at baseline, that were followed\nprospectively to see if BMI or changes in BMI would predict\nheadache or migraine occurrence over time. Follow-up data\nwere available in only the two smallest studies (ACHS and\nTCHS). In the future, we recommend analyzing any available\nlongitudinal data on headache and BMI by using nonlinear\nmethodology, similar to that which we have applied to these\ncross-sectional databases.\nIn conclusion, the results of estimating the association\nbetween BMI and headache in large, nationally representative\nsamples of women indicated that obese women have signifi-\ncantly higher risk for headache. Further research is warranted\nto study the direction and mechanisms of causation as well as\nto investigate the possible BMI\u00adheadache relationship among\nmen. The possibility that weight loss may alleviate severe or\nchronic headache problems among obese people also warrants\ninvestigation.\n"
