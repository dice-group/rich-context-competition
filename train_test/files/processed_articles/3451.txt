    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: the objective of this article is to evaluate the role of siRNA-silenced TRPC6 on podocyte autophagy and\napoptosis induced by AngII.\nMethods: mouse podocyte cell lines were cultured in vitro. The apoptosis rates of each group were detected using\nflow cytometry. The expression of LC3-II protein and changes in distribution were detected by confocal laser, and the\nwestern blot protocol was employed for detection of protein expression of LC3-II.\nResults: AngII-injured podocyte had a significant increase in apoptosis, while silencing TRPC6 could decrease the\napoptosis induced by AngII. Autophagy remarkably increased after AngII injury. While silencing TRPC6 stabilized the\nautophagy expression, AngII could activate the autophagy of podocyte. Autophagy-associated protein LC3-II expression\nincreased after AngII injury. The LC3-II mRNA and the protein level could be down regulated by 3-MA. The silencing of\nTRPC6 could stabilize the autophagy expression.\nConclusion: the data suggest that AngII can lead to podocyte injury. Autophagy may have beneficial effects in preventing\nthe progression of proteinuria. This study provides some new clues for further exploring the occurrence of podocyte\ninjury and the development mechanism of proteinuria.\n",

TRPC6 was a newly found virulence gene which\ncaused familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\n(FSGS). The product of this gene is a non-selective cation\nchannel protein which is located in podocyte. The dys-\nfunction of the podocyte structure and the function is\nessential for glomerular kidney diseases. TRPC6 plays a\nvery important role in maintaining the structure and func-\ntion of podocyte according to recent research. As the\nresearch of autophagy increases, new knowledge on the\nrole of autophagy in podocyte impairment and proteinuria\ngenesis has been partially revealed; the autophagy regula-\ntion could be a new mechanism for proteinuria prevention\nand treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of\nTRPC6-silenced by siRNA on the podocyte autophagy\ninduced by AngII. The molecular mechanism of this pro-\ncess was elucidated from the autophagy view.\nThe effects of siRNA-silenced TRPC6\non podocyte autophagy and apoptosis\ninduced by AngII\nYu Shengyou and Yu Li\n Keywords\nPodocyte, TRPC6, AngII, autophagy, apoptosis\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, affiliate\nto Guangzhou Medical University, China\nCorresponding author:\nYu Li, Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou First People's Hospital,\naffiliate to Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong, 510180,\nChina.\nOriginal Article\nMaterial and methods\nPodocyte culture\nVitro immortalized mouse podocyte cell lines (MPC5)\nwere authorized for the US Mundel Professor, Professor of\nPediatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Ding Jie\ndonation. Under the license conditions, podocyte recovery\nwas at 33\u00b0C, contained 10 U/mL recombinant mouse\n-interferon (PEPRO Tech Company), and used a RPMI\n(Gibco company) culture proliferated. Then, it was inocu-\nlated into collagen coated I (BD Biosciences Inc.) flasks or\nsix-well plates; 12 induced differentiations of the cells\nwere cultured for 14 days at a mature podocyte at 37\u00b0C so\nthey could be used for the experiments. All experiments\nwere repeated three times.\nPodocyte transfection\nTRPC6 siRNAdouble strands were synthesized by Shanghai\nJima Biotech and Engineering Co. Sequences were as fol-\nlows: plussense:ATTGATCCTGGATCTAGAGTG and anti\nsense:ATTGATCCTGGATCTAGAGTG. Transfection was\nconducted by oligofectamine equipment (Invitrogen). The\nculture medium was changed to a common RPMI 1640\nmedium after a transfection of approximately 6 h and cells\nwere incubated at 33\u00b0C. siRNA transfection was monitored\nunder a fluorescence microscope after 24 h and the effi-\nciency was detected by flow cytometry. WB was taken out\nto measure TRPC6 protein expression 48 h after transfec-\ntion. All cell groups in the experiments were designed with\nthree replicates.\nWestern blotting\nCells in the 25 cm2 culture bottle were first washed twice\nby a pre-cooled PBS buffer, then they were incubated with\ng/ml aprotinin, 1 g/ml leupeptin, 1 g/ml pepstatin) for\nsupernatant was taken for total protein determination by\nBCA method. The equivalent of 75 g total protein was\nloaded for SDS PAGE and transferred to PVDF mem-\nbrane. WB was then carried out using GAPDH as the inte-\nrior reference. Quantitative analysis was done by Image J\nsoftware and each independent experiment was repeated\nthree times.\nLaser scanning confocal microscopy\nmeasurement\nFITC and TRITC fluorescence was monitored under laser\nscanning confocal microscopy (Olympus). Eye lens that\nwere 10x and 60x (immersion objective) objective lens\nwere used. Operations were carried out in a single blind\nsituation where the operator did not know the detail of the\nsample grouping. Photography was taken with a SHARP-\n2000 and all experiments had three replicates.\nFCM detection of podocyte apoptosis\nAccording to the equipment operation instructions, cell\ncycle was synchronized for 24 h first. Nearly confluent\ncells were then grouped. Cells (5\u00d7105/ml) were collected\nand suspended with 200 \u00b5l of binding buffer, and then 10\n\u00b5l of Annexin-v-FITC and 5 \u00b5l of PI were added for a 15\nmin light cycle avoiding incubation at room tempera-\nture. After incubation, 300 \u00b5l of binding buffer was\nadded for FCM detection; the experiment had three\nreplicates.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed by SPSS16.0 statistics software.\nData were shown as mean \u00b1 SD. A t-test with p-value\nsmaller than 0.05 was applied for differentiation with sta-\ntistical significance.\nResults\nThe optimization of podocyte transfection\nPodocyte was transfected by GFP labeled NC-siRNA;\ncells with green fluorescence were counted under a fluo-\nrescence inverted microscope. The transfection efficiency\nwas calculated by dividing the total cells in the same field\nof view (Figure 1(a) and (b)). Flow cytometry and the\nwestern blot protocol were also employed for detection of\nthe transfection efficiency (Figure 1(c) and (d)).\nPodocyte apoptosis monitored by FCM\nThe podocyte apoptosis ratio of the control group was 2.36\n\u00b1 0.50%, while podocyte apoptosis was significantly\npared to the control group (p < 0.05). Mock vector trans-\nfection did not affect the apoptosis compared to the control\ngroup (p > 0.05). TRPC6-silenced podocyte had an apop-\ntosis ratio of 4.33 \u00b1 0.45% which was not statistically sig-\nnificant to the control group (p > 0.05). When\nTRPC6-silenced podocyte was treated with AngII, apopto-\nsis was significantly decreased compared to the control\nAutophagy detected by TEM\nThe ultrastructure showed that little autophagy expressed\nin podocyte. The structure and distribution of organelles,\nFigure 1.

AngII-impaired podocyte showed ultrastructural\nchanges and the autophagy increased significantly. A\ngreat quantity of independent double membrane struc-\ntures emerged, gradually extended, and bent. These\nincluded autophagosomes containing cytoplasm, lyso-\nsome, and other organelles. It is significantly different\nfrom the control group (p < 0.01) (Figure 3). While\nTRPC6-silenced podocyte was not sensitive to AngII, the\nautophagy was significantly lower than the AngII-treated\nDetection of expression of autophagy-\nassociated protein LC3-II by western blotting\nLC3-II expression in normal podocyte (control group) was\nvery low as the immunoblotting band was slender. The\nsame results were observed in the 3-MA treated group.\nWhen podocyte was impaired by AngII, the LC3-II expres-\nsion increased remarkably compared to the control group (p\n< 0.01). TPRC6-silenced podocyte hardly changed the\nLC3-II level after AngII treatment; the same situation was\nobserved in the 3-MA inhibited group. The expression\ndifference was statistically significant compared to the con-\nLC3-II expression after TRPC6 silencing\ndetection by laser confocal microscope\nThe expression of LC3-II was fairly weak in normal podo-\ncyte under a confocal microscope, while the AngII-injured\npodocyte had a remarkable increase in LC3-II expression\ncompared to the control group (p < 0.01). When TRPC6\nwas silenced by siRNA, the expression of LC3-II became\nstable and statistically significant to the control group (p <\nDiscussion\nAutophagy is a lysosom-dependent degradation pathway\nwidely existing within eukaryotic cells as a self-protection\nmechanism in response to pessimal stimulation, and the\nfunction of autophagy is not only involved in surrounding\nand isolating the damaged organelles, but more important\nin transporting the surrounded materials to lysosomes for\ndegradation and producing amino acids, ATP, and other\nsubstances to maintain the energy metabolism cycle of the\nbody.7 Research demonstrated that a mouse lacking in\nautophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) in podocyte cells would\nbe more susceptible to glomerular diseases, and the\ndecrease of autophagy within podocyte cells would delay\nFigure 2.

TRPC6 was a\nnewly discovered virulence gene which caused familial\nFSGS. It is a non-selective cation channel protein which is\nspecifically located in glomerular podocyte. The dysfunc-\ntion of the podocyte structure and the function is essential\nfor glomerular kidney diseases. TRPC6 played a very\nimportant role in maintaining the structure and function of\npodocyte according to recent research.8, 9\nResearch has shown that cis-platinum can cause apopto-\nsis and necrosis of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEC) and\nthat it was a dose and time dependent course. The cell death\npattern differed when time and concentration were var-\ninjured by hypoxia, the level of autophagy increased and\nfinally caused cell apoptosis. Their research also suggested\nthat autophagy had a protective effect on RTEC apoptosis.\nPallet et al.14 found that ciclosporin could impair RTEC\nthrough ER stress and autophagy had a protection. Yang et\nal.15 found in the model of RTEC impaired by cis-platinum\nthat LC3, Beclin1, and Atg5 were all increased when the\nFigure 3.

Autophagy inhibitor and autophagy\ngene Beclin1,Atg5-silenced could accelerate the activity of\ncaspases and RTEC apoptosis. Conversely, improving the\nlevel of autophagy could inhibit RTEC apoptosis which\nsuggested that autophagy could protect against poisoned\nkidney injury. Periyasamy-Thandavan et al.16 found that an\nanti-apoptosis protein such as Bcl-2 could inhibit autophagy\nin a cis-platinum interfered mouse kidney. The same effect\nwas found with 3-MA. Lau17 observed that cis-platinum\ncould induce RTEC necrosis with engorged kytoplasm and\ncause the membrane integrity to disappear. Man Jiang et\nal.13 elucidated that 3-MA or Beclin-1, Atg5-silenced could\ninduce the hypoxia impairment of podocyte leading to cell\napoptosis. The research suggested that autophagy had a\nprotective role in kidney ischemic and hypoxia injury.\nSuzuki et al.18 studied the autophagy during human kidney\ntransplant and rat testes ischemia-reperfusion. The\nautophagy-associated protein LC-3 expression increased.\nThus, ischemia could induce autophagy and reperfusion\ncould accelerate autophagysome formulation. Matsui\nFigure 4.

(a) Confocal images of LC3-II expression in different groups and (b) the bar chart of LC3-II expression.\net al.19 found that autophagy mainly functioned as a protec-\ntive factor during kidney ischemia when reperfusion was\ncarrying on. Chien et al.20 found that the transfection of the\nBcl-xL gene could remarkably relieve RTEC autophagy\nand improve kidney failure in the ischemia-reperfusion\nmouse model. Sato et al.21 defined two types of autophagy\nin the nephronia pathological section under TEM: Type I\nand Type II autophagysome. The study of IgA nephronia\npatients found eight cases of Type I autophagysome. Of\nthese cases, 37.5% were FSGS for the first time patho-\nlogic diagnosis. The other eight cases were Type II\nautophagysome, of which 87.5% were FSGS for the first\ntime pathologic diagnosis. The research suggested that the\ntype of autophagysome was closely related to the progno-\nsis. However, there were few reports about podocyte-\nassociated molecules in autophagy.\nTRPC6 was recently found as a virulence gene causing\nfamilial FSGS.22,23 It is a six-transmembrane protein of\nwhich the cation channel was formed by the fifth and sixth\ntransmembrane domains, while the NTD and CTD were\nlocated intracellularly. The TRPC family can be divided\ninto four subgroups: TRPC1, TRPC2, TRPC4/5, and\nstitutively formed the functional channel.24 TRPC6 had a\nlow expression in rat glomcrulus and both the resistance\nvessel and arteria renalis expressed. TRPC6 expression in\npodocyte in the rat neohridial tissue.25, 26 The endothelial\ncell also had weak expression. Immune-gold labeling\nshowed that TRPC6 was located in the podocyte primary\nand secondary foot process, and mainly distributed near\nthe SD molecules. TRCP6, together with SD molecules\nsuch as podocin and nephrin, composed the signaling com-\nplex to maintain the structural and functional integrity of\nthe foot process and SD molecules. TRPC6 played an\nimportant role in maintaining the glomerular filtration bar-\nrier. Moller et al.27 showed that TRPC6 mRNA was\nremarkably lower in minimal lesion and MGN patients\nthan in healthy adults. Reiser et al.28 transfected podocyte\nwith GFP-labeled TRPC6. These suggested that TRPC6\nplayed a very important role in proteinuria genesis and\ndevelopment.\nOur study showed that AngII-injured podocyte had a\nsignificant apoptosis increase, while the silencing of\nTRPC6 could decrease the apoptosis induced by AngII.\nAutophagy in normal podocyte was weak, but it remark-\nably increased after AngII injury. While the silencing of\nTRPC6 stabilized the autophagy expression even when\nfaced with AngII injury, it suggested that the silencing of\nTRPC6 could inhibit the podocyte apoptosis when injured\nby AngII. AngII could activate the autophagy of the podo-\ncyte. Autophagy-associated protein LC3-II expression\nincreased after AngII injury. The LC3-II mRNA and pro-\ntein level could be down regulated by 3-MA. The silenc-\ning of TRPC6 could stabilize the autophagy expression.\nIn short, the silencing of TRPC6 could inhibit the\nautophagy abnormal expression caused by AngII impair-\nment and thus protect the autophagy and inhibit podocyte\napoptosis to safeguard the podocyte.\nConclusions\nTRPC6 participated in the molecular biological mecha-\nnism of podocyte autophagy induced by AngII. Autophagy\nplayed a very important role in podocyte impairment\nrepair. Autophagy regulation is a complicated process\nwhich involved multiple mechanisms. Our study eluci-\ndated the podocyte impairment protection from the\nautophagy point of view which provided new insight and\ntheory basis for kidney disease prevention and cure.\n"
