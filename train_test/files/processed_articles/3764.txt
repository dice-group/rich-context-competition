Encouraged by shrinking public sector budgets and the introduction\nof so-called `austerity measures' following the 2008 global financial crisis, as well as the\nrevision of official performance measures (discussed in more detail below), there is evi-\ndence of practice innovations that have outstripped the pace of policy change (see, for\nexample, Bateman, 2014). Significant among these, and the focus of this article, are the\nvarious pre-statutory schemes set up by police forces and youth justice services to `divert'\nyoung people accused of first or minor offences from prosecution, and from FTE statistics\nThe examination of these diversion schemes is a growing area of interest, politically\njustice practitioners and documentary research conducted as part of a broader research\nproject exploring policy implementation in youth justice, we consider such initiatives in\ntwo locations in England. We explore managerial claims that the new diversionary focus\nrepresents a `sea change' in practice, but argue for a more nuanced assessment. We sug-\ngest that current practices reflect the continued influence of New Labour reforms, particu-\nlarly in relation to standardization of practice, actuarial risk assessment and a commitment\nto welfare-oriented early intervention. This leads us to argue that a `new interventionist\ndiversion' is observable, which differs in important aspects from the non-interventionist\nunderstandings of `diversion' prominent during earlier historical periods \u00ad notably in\nIn noting ambiguity in the meanings of and rationales for diversion, and the ways in\nwhich this label has been applied to highly varied diversionary practices, our argument\nreflects claims recently made by Richards (2014) about diversion in the context of\nAustralian youth justice. The empirical findings presented here indicate, however, that the\nconceptual project she recommends of detangling the domains of `primary crime preven-\ntion'(which we refer to as universal support services), `early intervention'and `diversion'\nis beset with difficulties \u00ad at least within the studied jurisdiction. Our research suggests\nthe notion that `diversion from crime' depends on intervention through which crimino-\ngenic risk factors can be mitigated (for example, Farrington, 2000) is now broadly\naccepted by practitioners as well as policy makers. Thus, intervention without criminali-\nzation in the form of a criminal record was judged to be both necessary and helpful by\nmany of our participants, especially in the context of reduced investment in universal\nchild and family support services in England as in other neo-liberal societies (Connolly\nand Morris, 2012), the removal of `ring-fenced'funding for youth justice prevention work\nin the context of reduced Youth Offending Team (YOT) budgets (House of Commons,\n2013)2 and raised thresholds and an increased early years focus within specialist child\nprotection (Allen, 2011; Carlile, 2014). We would therefore argue, reflecting comments\nmade about `risk'and `need'in early intervention services (see for example, Smith, 2005),\nthat rethinking the role of `diversion' in youth justice has ramifications well beyond the\nyouth justice `system' in so far as this is equated with the work carried out by youth\noffending teams. Varied local practices and the diversity of service structures within which\nYOTs now sit (Fielder et al., 2008), heralds considerable challenges for researchers\nattempting to assess what forms of `system contact' help and hinder, or indeed how forms\nof `prevention', `early intervention' and `diversion' are developing within any given local\nauthority area in England, let alone the jurisdiction as a whole.\nDiverse Meanings of Diversion\nThe drive to divert young people from aspects of formal criminal justice processes has a\nlong history. The Children's Act 1908 established separate juvenile courts to divert young\npeople from the adult court process in recognition of the different needs of child and adult\noffenders and the responsibility of the state to consider the welfare of young people com-\ning before the courts (Arthur, 2010). A more radical conception of `diversion' emerged in\nthe United States in the mid-20th century in the context of new sociological theories \u00ad\nnamely `labelling theory' \u00ad which emphasized the stigmatizing consequences of applying\ndeviant or criminal labels that cast deviants as `outsiders' (Becker, 1963; Lemert, 1967).\nThis was believed to promote self-identification with the applied label and forms of dis-\ncrimination, which together serve to `amplify' deviance. When applied to criminal justice\npractice, this way of understanding crime and criminalization logically promotes strate-\ngies that minimize labelling \u00ad in other words, non-intervention (Schur, 1973) or minimum\npossible intervention and the reduction of contact with formal criminal justice systems.\nCritical criminologists and campaigning organizations in England and Wales have also\nemphasized that most youth crime is relatively minor and that the majority of children\nwill `grow out' of crime (for example, National Association for Youth Justice, 2013;\nRutherford, 1986, 1992). This observation, bolstered by empirical research suggesting\ncontact with formal criminal justice systems inhibits this process (Kemp et al., 2002;\nMcAra and McVie, 2007), also lends support to noninterventionist approaches. The recent\nIndependent Parliamentarians'Inquiry into the Operation and Effectiveness of the Youth\nCourt headed by Lord Carlile found that there was `wide support for high levels of diver-\nsion among inquiry respondents' (Carlile, 2014: ix), in part due to this body of evidence.\nWhat this means in practice can be complex. Cressey and McDermott (1974: 3) dis-\ncussed the difficulties in securing a single and clear definition of `diversion' in their\nresearch on diversionary programmes in the United States. They identified several central\nproblematic areas including: contested and contradictory definitions of diversion, defini-\ntions of `system contact' and definitions of formal/informal provision. Similar concerns\nhave recently been explored by Richards (2014: 122) who asks four interrelated questions\nto tease out these issues:\n... what young people are to be diverted from and to; whether young people are to be `diverted'\nfrom the criminal justice system or offending; whether young people are to be `diverted' from\ncriminal justice processes or outcomes; and whether diversion should be considered distinct\nfrom crime prevention and early intervention.\nWe would suggest that at least five understandings of diversion can now be identified\nwithin academic and policy discourse: i) `diversion from prosecution/court'; ii) `diversion\nfrom custody'; iii) `diversion from the youth justice system'; iv) `diversion into alterna-\ntive services'; v) `diversion from crime'. Each of these meanings addresses Cressey and\nMcDermott's (1974) and Richard's (2014) questions in different ways and has its own\nhistory in relation to youth justice in England and Wales. Some are also ambiguous: as we\ndiscuss below, the notion of diverting from the `youth justice system', in particular,\ndepends on where the boundaries of `youth justice work' are drawn. Of particular rele-\nvance to current practice is the shift in political rhetoric and policy from `diversion-from-\nprosecution', associated in England and Wales with the promotion of youth cautioning\nassociated the more interventionist youth justice strategies identifiable from the mid-\n1990s (Audit Commission, 1996) and central to the policies introduced by the New Labour\nGovernment from 1997 (Home Office, 1997). We then go on to ask to what extent, and\nwith what implications, this has since been reversed by practitioners.\nFrom `Diversion-from-Prosecution' to `Diversion-from-Crime'\nThe principles of minimal or non-intervention were most visibly enacted in juvenile\njustice practice in England during the 1980s and early-1990s. This period saw a sig-\nnificant reduction in the numbers of young people convicted and imprisoned under an\nostensibly punitive Conservative government publicly committed to the pursuit of `law\nand order' (Allen, 1991). While acknowledging the role of demographic changes (the\noverall juvenile population fell by 9 per cent over this period), critical criminologists\n1986; 1992) have tended to attribute these reductions to the dual practices of diversion-\nfrom-prosecution, facilitated by official endorsements of informal police cautioning\n(Home Office, 1985; 1990), and bifurcation (i.e. the tendency to impose the most seri-\nous sanctions only for the most serious offences, which in practice amounts to\n`diversion-from-custody').\nAlthough by 1990 a Home Office circular was able to claim `widespread agreement\nthat the courts should only be used as a last resort'(Home Office, 1990: 3), this consensus\nwas relatively short-lived. The policy became subject to critique on the grounds of `inef-\nfectiveness', particularly in relation to practices of repeat cautioning and the use of less\n`tough' disposals such as warnings, and `inconsistencies' in terms of application (Audit\nCommission, 1996). Although disputed, such critiques became central to the reformulated\n(New) Labour Party's attempts to claim greater political authority on the issue of criminal\ndirection of policy in England and Wales was therefore tending towards ever earlier inter-\nvention into young people's lives under the guise of `diversion from crime'.\nFollowing their election in 1997, the New Labour government radically and rapidly\noverhauled juvenile justice with the Crime and Disorder Act (CDA) 1998. Juvenile\nJustice Departments were replaced by Youth Offending Teams under the management\nof a new Youth Justice Board. Practice was closely regulated and structured by a new\nsystem of national standards, targets and key performance indicators, data recording,\nmanagement and reporting requirements, standardized risk assessment documentation\nand procedures and nationally disseminated guidance and training on `effective prac-\ntice' (Muncie, 1999; Pitts, 2001b). So significant were these changes, and such was the\ndepth of the new focus on standardization, that policy makers and youth justice scholars\nbegan to treat the CDA 1998 as the start of an entirely new era \u00ad the start of the `new\nSignificant too was the emphasis on `preventing offending', which the CDA 1998\nintroduced as a new `principal aim' of the youth justice system. Based upon the correla-\ntion of `risk factors' and (future) criminal behaviour, derived in turn from longitudinal\nstudies such as the Cambridge Study of Delinquent Development (Farrington, 2000; West\nand Farrington, 1973), what became known as the `Risk Factor Prevention Paradigm'\n(RFPP) provided theoretical support for the increasingly interventionist youth justice\ndeveloped by New Labour. Here, prevention was understood to depend upon drawing\nyoung people into services in which risk factors could be addressed \u00ad diverting them from\ncrime by addressing welfare needs, albeit within or close to the youth justice system.\nIdentifying young people `at risk' and drawing them into voluntary services such as\nYouth Inclusion Projects (YIPs)3 and Youth Inclusion and Support Panels (YISPs)4 was\npresented as a way to prevent crime, but also, in so doing, prevent the criminalization\nof young people. Thus, `diversion' became equated with `diversion-from-crime', which\nin fact implied `early intervention', whereas `diversion from the system' meant `system\ncontact' of another form (system contact following offending). As Jack Straw, then\nJustice Secretary, suggested when introducing the Youth Crime Action Plan 2008 (HM\nOne aim of the new Action Plan is to divert young people away from crime, so that they are not\nunnecessarily drawn into the criminal justice system (cited in Home Office, 2008).\nClearly, this brief overview of policy change is schematic and reductive. We do not intend\nto imply that the history of diversionary practices in youth justice form a simple linear\nprogression, nor that practice innovation is driven only by policy change. Indeed, as we\ngo on to argue, such a position would offer little chance of accurately capturing current\ndevelopments.\nThe Current Context: Diverse Practices of Diversion\nThere seems to be an emerging consensus that the dramatic reduction in FTE numbers\nwith which we opened the paper has not been driven by an explicit redirection of national\n2014). Commentators point to concurrent local responses to revised performance indicators\n\u00ad particularly the Youth Crime Action Plan 2008 pledge to reduce the numbers of young\npeople entering the youth justice system and the removal of the controversial police\n`offences brought to justice' target \u00ad but also the strict budgetary constraints occasioned\nby the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent `austerity measures'. As in the 1980s, the\nprospect of reducing costs at a time when local authority budgets have been significantly,\nalthough unevenly, reduced (Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute, 2014), and\nthe removal of some performance management and reporting requirements promoting\nstandardization (see Ministry of Justice and Youth Justice Board, 2013a; Youth Justice\nBoard, 2011; and Bateman, 2014 for discussion) mean that there are clear financial\nincentives for local authorities to innovate to prevent young people being drawn into\ncriminal justice services.\nThe Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (LASPO) Act 2012 made\nlegislative provision for the increasingly flexible system proposed by the Green Paper\n`Breaking the Cycle' (Ministry of Justice 2010) by replacing the `two strike' Reprimand\nand Final Warning system with the more flexible Youth Caution and Youth Conditional\nCaution. Both statutory out-of-court disposals, Youth Cautions do not automatically\ninvolve intervention programmes (although the police must inform the YOT if given)\nwhereas Youth Conditional Cautions do carry compliance conditions although these\nshould only be punitive when rehabilitative and reparative conditions `are not suitable or\nsufficient to address the offending' (Ministry of Justice and Youth Justice Board, 2013b:\n8). Most significantly, in specific circumstances the new process allows for repeat cau-\ntioning, as was the case pre-1997, thereby aiming to prevent the unnecessary escalation of\nyoung people into the court system which characterized the Reprimand and Final Warning\nsystem. LASPO also clarified available police responses to young people's lawbreaking,\nincluding the kinds of informal non-statutory `community resolutions' that many areas\nhad already implemented (Bateman, 2014).\nMinistry of Justice pilots have explored three overlapping models of these non-statu-\ntory responses: Triage (Home Office, 2012),Youth Justice Liaison and Diversion Schemes\n(Haines et al., 2012) and the Youth Restorative Disposal (Youth Justice Board, 2011). A\nrecent survey of diversion schemes in 71 YOTs found that more than half had dedicated\npreventions-type teams or dedicated workers dealing with diversion (New Economics\nFoundation, 2014), most commonly Youth Justice Liaison and Diversion (YJLD) and\nTriage schemes. The YJLD schemes developed from the recommendations of the Bradley\nReport (Department of Health, 2009) and aim to respond, at the point of contact (usually\na police custody suite), to mental health issues which are disproportionately experienced\nby young people in trouble with the law. They aim to `divert' affected young people:\neither from the criminal justice system to health and social care services or to youth justice\nservices `better equipped to meet their health, emotional well-being and welfare needs'\n(Haines et al., 2012: 8). The government has proposed a national roll-out ofYJLD schemes\nTriage services also place YOT staff in custody suites to work with the police and\nCrown Prosecution Service in determining the disposal most suited to the alleged offence,\ntheir history of service contact and assessed risk (Home Office, 2012). This can involve\ndiverting minor cases (level one), offering supportive interventions for young people kept\nwithin the system, sometimes with the involvement of parents and carers (level two) and,\nin a few pilot areas, supporting but also fast-tracking young people identified as `serious'\nand `prolific' offenders (level three). The Youth Restorative Disposal (YRD), meanwhile,\nis aimed at providing first-time entrants with a `supportive' intervention based on restora-\ntive justice principles. This entails a young person admitting guilt, taking responsibility\nfor their actions and apologizing to the offended party. YRDs are a police-led interven-\ntion, and while the majority of YOTs receive YRD referrals from the police, an evaluation\nof YRD schemes found that YOT involvement varies across areas. The evaluation found\nthat YOT responses were commonly preceded by a risk assessment, with levels and types\nof work depending on identified risks (Youth Justice Board, 2011). This `work' might\ninvolve implementing a plan with the young person to address their behaviour and prevent\nfuture offending (Ministry of Justice, 2011), a process decided at a local level but which\ncan include workshops with other young people, victims or families, reparative work, or\n`offending behaviour programmes'. We explore these models in more detail in relation to\nour research findings below.\nMethodology\nWe draw on findings from a study funded by the Economic and Social Research Council\npolicy in England through an examination of practitioner sense-making. The research\ncomprised a study of youth offending services at two case study sites (`Site A' and `Site\nB'), with the primary data collection undertaken between December 2012 and September\n2013. Briefly, Site A had a traditional Youth Offending Team made up of seconded proba-\ntion officers and social workers. Site B had subsumed the YOT into a broader `young\npeople's service' (YPS) including other agencies such as youth work and Connexions.\nPractices of `diversion' were not a focus of the original research but emerged as a key\ntheme in interviews across the sites. There was no sampling in either location: where pos-\nsible all youth justice professionals and their managers were interviewed. The data collec-\ntion involved initial focus groups with practitioners at each site (n = 44), followed by the\nmain body of data collection which comprised in-depth qualitative interviews with 71\npractitioners (Site A = 31, Site B = 40) ranging from the Heads of Service at each site\nthrough to officers, workers and performance managers.\nThe New Disposal and New Intervention\nIn the context of increased local decision-making and in response to new national FTE\ntargets each site had developed their own pre-statutory diversion scheme. The Site A\nscheme, referred to henceforth as the `New Disposal'(ND), was developed by the YOT in\nconjunction with the local police. It was similar to a first step in Triage, a `one chance'\nbefore the invocation of formal Caution or Youth Conditional Caution for young people\nwho had come to the attention of the police for the first time and had made an admission\nof guilt. The ND involved an ASSET-style assessment focused on identifying the welfare\nneeds of the young person (this also triggered a number of other assessments and risk\nmanagement plans when deemed necessary). Following the initial assessment, the actual\n`work'for the young person was likely to be a programme of activities to address `offend-\ning behaviour' (in areas such as victim awareness, consequences of offending and work\nwith families) and any other `need' the assessment had highlighted. Whilst most NDs\nwere completed, non-compliance with the ND would ultimately revert back to the police\nand the young person could instead be given a formal caution.\nThe disposal developed by Site B - the `New Intervention' (NI) - was similarly a non-\nstatutory pre-caution measure and had also originally been developed in partnership with\nthe local police. However, in practice the two schemes looked very different. The NI was\nmore akin to the Youth Justice Board's `Youth Restorative Disposal' model than Triage,\nand was considered in all cases where the young person admitted guilt for a non-indictable\noffence (not just for a first offence). All referrals came from the police but, following a\ndecision-making panel made up of police and YPS representatives, NIs could be adminis-\ntered by the police or by YPS practitioners. While the Site A disposal was based largely\non welfarist principles (i.e. the assumption that addressing welfare needs would reduce\noffending), the NI was based also on restorative justice values (i.e. the recognition of\nharm to the victim of the offence was considered as central to the success of an individual\nintervention). Most of the official discourse about the NI focused on the victim rather than\nthe offender (Site B considered themselves highly restorative in general practice) and in\ntheory the involvement of the victim had to be agreed for the intervention to go ahead,\nalthough at least one practitioner discussed a case where the victim did not want the NI\nbut it was carried out nonetheless. Each NI was made up of an agreed contract with the\nyoung person regarding appropriate reparation for their offence, either to the victim or\ncommunity. Where there was no identifiable victim (such as drug possession) the young\nperson would be expected to undertake other activities to `make amends' for their offend-\ning, for example speaking with parents about their offence. Many young people were also\nexpected to undertake activities such as victim awareness or offending behaviour pro-\ngrammes in conjunction with their reparation or as part of the restorative process.\nWhereas Site A's decision-making approach to diversion was offence-focused, Site B\npractice was flexible in deciding whether an NI was appropriate, taking a more offender-\nfocused approach in considering broader factors including the young person's offending\nhistory, their social circumstances and other factors. This meant that in practice the\ncohorts of young people holding NDs and NIs at the respective sites was very different\n\u00ad young people could hold more than one NI at a time (and/or at the same time as a\nformal order) if deemed appropriate, and could be not only first time offenders but also\nmore serious offenders who may have already been in court or custody. Both sites\nundertook welfare and risk assessments at the outset of the diversion and where appro-\npriate included a welfare component to the measure. Site A in particular, across both\nmanagement and practitioners, widely believed that pre-court work including the New\nDisposal was a way in which to get young people and their families `the help that they\nneeded' (Site A Report), highlighting the blurring of the conceptual boundaries between\n`diversion' and `intervention'.\nA `Sea Change' in Practice?\nOur findings illustrate that national policy encouraging diversion via the new out of court\nframework (Ministry of Justice and Youth Justice Board, 2013b) can be `understood as\nformalizing changes that had already occurred organically' (Bateman, 2014: 419). Both\nNew Interventions and New Disposals were presented, by managers and practitioners, as\na necessary response to a challenging new economic climate and as an `opportunity' to\nundertake more diversionary work which saved money compared to statutory measures.\nManagers at both sites viewed the diversion schemes as a `new' way to deal with young\npeople's offending:\nWe've been phenomenally successful in diverting young people from the criminal justice\nsystem, and they're not coming back - they're not reoffending. (Site A)\nThere has been a sea-change in the way young people are dealt with by the criminal justice\nsystemin[SiteB]...diversionandrestorativeresponsesandnotcriminalisingkidsunnecessarily,\nand getting them out of the system rather than bringing them into the system. (Site B)\nThe local practices developed at both sites were presented by managers as significant\n`innovations', which had pre-empted the publication of the Out-of-Court Disposals\nNational Framework (Ministry of Justice and Youth Justice Board, 2013b). A small num-\nber of practitioners were aware of similar innovations occurring elsewhere but most con-\nsidered their local approach to be unique or knew little of other YOTs' working practices.\nManagers at Site B stated that the NI was developed for a number of reasons including: as\na quick and effective response for the victims, to reduce costs and to lower FTEs (Site B\nFactsheet), but also within a broader context of preventing the criminalization of young\npeople. Alternatively, Site A's rationale in setting up the ND was primarily described as\nFTE reduction and better outcomes for young people through early intervention (Site A\nEffective Practice Report). Although there were similarities and differences in these two\ndiversion schemes occurring at various stages in the process (the officially stated ration-\nale, the decision-makers and decision-making processes, thresholds for decisions, the\nnumber of interventions, the nature of intervention work, and the standardization of work\nwithin service), nonetheless both sites shared a `new' commitment (made possible by\nbudget restrictions and loosening of central government control) to `diversion from pros-\necution' and `diversion into alternative services' (the 1980s model). And yet they were\nalso committed to `diversion from crime' involving forms of work similar to the risk-\nfocused `early intervention' discussed above (the New Labour model). Whether and to\nwhat extent these services amounted to `diversion from the youth justice system'was also\nopen to question at both sites, as we discuss below. Together, we argue, this indicates that\nwe were witnessing a distinct form of `interventionist diversion' that differed from (at\nleast some of) the models previously observable in England and Wales and from the forms\nof early intervention which had preceded it.\nDiversion, but Not as We Know It?\nAs the previous summaries make clear, we observed diverse practices at both our research\nsites and consequently we became interested in understanding the extent to which these\nwere novel practices. The New Intervention and New Disposal both clearly differed from\nthe forms of early intervention targeting young people `at risk of offending' which Youth\nOffending Services were encouraged to develop under the New Labour Government\n(Youth Justice Board, 2006), crucially because they require a young person to have bro-\nken the law and admit guilt. And yet, similar forms of pre-court `intervention' were also\nin operation during the period in which informal forms of `diversion-from-prosecution'\nEngland and Wales reported some form of `caution-plus' scheme to Home Office\nresearchers (Evans and Wilkinson, 1990), involving a formal caution accompanied by a\ntype of intervention. This can be seen as a clear precursor of current interventionist diver-\nsionary approaches: it involved a supportive intervention, the involvement of multi-\nagency panels in determining the use and nature of the disposal, and some complexity\naround compulsion in relation to the `offer' (Evans and Ellis, 1997). Davis et al. (1989:\n232) in their evaluation of the Northamptonshire Bureau also differentiated between the\nvarieties `diversion-from-prosecution' schemes on offer in the 1980s:\n... the Bureau offers `traditional' or `true' diversion (no further treatment, no service, no\nfollow-up) rather than `new' diversion, which requires the young person to undergo some kind\nof rehabilitative programme.\nThese studies suggest there are continuities in practice from juvenile justice practice pre-\n1998, both in models of `diversion' that also involved an `intervention' and in terms of a\nhighly diverse and locally innovative practice context. Nonetheless, we would argue that\nwhat we observed is still something `new' (see also Smith, 2014) due to the continued\ninfluence of New Labour reforms. We discuss three specific aspects of this influence\nbelow: 1) embedded managerialism and `function creep'; 2) the continued influence of\n`risk-thinking' and `risk assessment'; and 3) practitioner commitment to (early) interven-\ntion as a preventative measure, i.e. the continued elision between `diversion-from crime'\nand `diversion from the system'.\nThe Continued Impact of New Labour Reforms on Diversion\nEmbedded managerialism and `function creep'\nThe positions that practitioners in our research took about the appropriate balance between\nintervention and diversion were neither unanimous nor straightforward, but it is clear that\nmany made a distinction between formal involvement in the youth justice system (and the\nassociated criminal record) and informal alternative interventions. We observed, however,\nthat `informal', i.e. out-of-court, diversion schemes shared some features of `formal' sys-\ntem contact. This included at one site recording the intervention on the Police National\nComputer, which could potentially result in Disclosure and Barring Service disclosure\n(see also Carlile, 2014), and also similarities in the actual intervention work carried out.\nAt one of our research sites, informal disposals could be granted after a formal disposal\n(which is permitted by section 138 of LASPO 2012). This meant in practice that young\npeople could be required to complete work simultaneously on a statutory and non-\nstatutory basis, usually with the same case manager responsible for ensuring completion\nin both cases. Some youth justice practitioners, although generally not those with a back-\nground in voluntary participation services, told us they found it challenging to engage\nsome young people without the threat of breach. Whilst they aimed to prevent the case\ngoing back to court, some tried to reproduce the more familiar power dynamic by empha-\nsizing the contingency of the `out-of-court' disposal:\nWith the New Interventions actually it's not just a carrot, there is a stick as well. `Do what you\nsaid you were going to do or you still go to court'. (Site B)\nWe also found evidence that there appeared to be some `sharing' of materials with statu-\ntorily ordered programmes and a continuity of practice across the different interventions,\nboth formal and voluntary:\nI just treat it the same because in my world they would have been on a referral order probably\nyears ago... it's the same intervention it's just called a different thing. I'm probably doing\nexactly what I would do if they were on a referral order but just without a panel meeting so I'd\ngo and meet [them].... I do my assessment and I go back to the office and write it all up and I\ndiscuss with him what I think would be a good way forward, we agree, he's going to do 4\nsessions on X, Y or Z, he does those 4 sessions. (Site B)\nThis transfer of practice seems unremarkable in professional contexts where the perfor-\nmance management techniques which pre-existed but were increasingly standardized by\nthe CDA 1998 (Pitts, 2001b) shape the current working lives \u00ad and in some cases, the\nentire professional experience \u00ad of practitioners to such a significant degree. We found\nmost practitioners spent a substantial proportion of their time completing standardized\ndocumentation or in front of a computer screen (reportedly averaging between 50 and 80\nper cent of their working week at both sites) and most were unable to envisage a world in\nwhich practice could take place without this paperwork (see Phoenix, forthcoming for\nfuller discussion):\nPeople write too much which is why they spend too long in front of computers. [...] They feel\nsafer, if we've written it all down then if you've written down every bit of information you feel\nlike you haven't missed anything and that no one will come and criticise you for not doing that\nbut in the process you haven't necessarily weighed what is important information. (Site B)\nWe found that, despite the removal of some national requirements, our studied services\nwere still recording and reporting on many aspects of practice for local management\nteams and other political actors within local authorities. Some practitioners felt that the\npressure to adhere to managerialist targets and `tick boxes' had increased rather than\ndecreased in recent years:\nThe world is now is that ... from a managing point of view, there is a great pressure to ensure\nthat there's [a] tick box element to it. I'm continuously as a manager sending emails saying `I\nneed this information, have you got this information?', there's a lot of duplication. (Site B)\nI think the paperwork has to be done and that's an element of the job that I don't always agree\nwith. I think sometimes we do things for the sake of doing it rather than for it to be of purpose,\nyou know for it to have ticked a box. (Site A)\nWe suggest that this embedding of managerialist techniques of performance management\nhave caused elements of `function creep', which challenge claims of an absolute sea\nchange in practice. We loosely borrow this term from surveillance studies concerned with\nthe spread of technologies designed for use in one domain, to other not originally intended\nfunctions (Winner, 1977). Some practitioners felt it was beneficial to adapt existing,\nalready `approved'ways of working with statutory cases to the new non statutory context.\nWe suggest that this blurs distinctions between `formal' and `informal' system contact,\nwhile retaining the distinction between criminalization (i.e. a criminal record) and its\navoidance which was at the centre of practitioner support for the new `diversionary'\ninterventions.\nThe continued influence of `risk-thinking' and `risk assessment'\nSimilarities in `formal and `informal' work were similarly evident in the use of risk-based\nassessments which draw upon the formal ASSET framework for these new forms of pre-\nstatutory work.\nFor any other case apart from a statutory court case we have a one sheet assessment. Basically\nit's a shortened form of an ASSET...but instead of the 12 ASSET sections you've got two or\nthree of the sections put into different categories so it's shorter. (Site B)\nThis is perhaps unsurprising given the extent to which `risk thinking' has become embed-\nded in youth justice work (for example, Baker, 2012; Case and Haines, 2009; Kemshall,\n2008). We found some evidence too of defensive practice cultures, especially within our\nintegrated service, as youth justice practitioners responded to a shrinking workload and\nfears of de-professionalization (see also Coyles, 2014).\nWe've got practitioners... many of whom are greatly experienced who are now doing things far\nless often than they used to do... writing pre-sentence reports for example. If you're writing one\n3 or 4 times a month it's probably keeping your skill level up. If you're only doing it once every\n2 or 3 months I think things are going to be forgotten and the kind of sharpness of them is lost\nand quality deteriorates. People are less content than they were and I think we will, over time,\nlose the expertise that we have because either they're not practising the skills that they've got or\nbecause they have gone off to other Local Authorities who can offer them more of what they\nwant to do... that's the downside of it. (Site B)\nIt seemed that the categories and scoring of `risk' underpinning ASSET had not only\nbecome important aspects of the reasoning process, but proficient risk-based assessment\nwas now part of the professional expertise which some youth justice workers were keen\nto defend.\nPractitioner commitment to (early) intervention as a preventative measure\nAssessments of the new practices were mixed, but at both sites, we found that many\npractitioners were concerned that the New Disposal and New Intervention were being\nused inconsistently or disproportionally. Some were in favour of heavier and earlier\nintervention:\nI think, if I compare how we work now to how we worked in the YISP when it was ...`at risk of\noffending', reprimand, final warning. If a young person came through on a reprimand they\ndidn't even get referred to the Youth Offending Service, until they received a final warning\n...[with a] reprimand they could go to the police station, sign this, don't get into trouble no\nmore. No intervention, walk away and nine times out of ten we're going to see that young\nperson back. Whereas now every young person that goes to the police station and is arrested and\ncharged for an offence is referred to the Youth Offending Service. So that very start, that early\nstage, they've been interviewed, they've had the photos took, they're referred to the youth, it's\nthe whole impact of it all. (Site A)\nI know they're meant to be soft touch which is the point of them but there's not a lot of change\nthat you can implement within that short period of time unless you are very very good or very\nvery lucky I think. (Site B)\nEchoing the welfarist justifications of `early intervention' (e.g. France and Utting, 2005),\npractitioners were concerned about the erosion of broader universal provision and felt\nthey were supporting, not punishing those with whom they worked, particularly in light of\nthe removal of the dedicated funding for YOT prevention work.\nI mean some of the families we're getting on the New Disposal have been crying out for services\nand they just haven't been delivered and this is the first time they're getting them from ourselves.\nNow I would love a world where they did get them delivered and they did have all that and they\ndidn't need to go into criminal justice services and kids were kept out of it, but it doesn't exist,\nand whilst we've got the situation we've got I'm happy for us to do it in the right way. (Site A)\nThe new approaches to `diversion'that we observed were therefore both `interventionist',\nsince they draw young people into structured programmes believed to bring behavioural\nchange, the nature of which is shaped by the assessment of risk, and `new', since they\nshare features with both pre-1998 `diversion'and post-1998 `early intervention'. We have\nshown how practitioners identified benefits associated with both `diversion' (especially\nthe avoidance of criminalization for minor or first time offences) and early intervention\n(especially the chance to offer welfare-focused support). Although we have insufficient\nspace to analyse them here, the concerns raised by practitioners were similarly hybrid.\nDespite these similarities, the `New Disposal' and `New Intervention' were very different\nto one another, particularly in respect of repeated use and use with young people previ-\nously sentenced at court (see also Smith, 2014 for an extended comparison of current\nservices). The teams we studied also sat within very different surrounding service struc-\ntures, which meant `pre-court' work was delivered by a dedicated team at one site, but by\nworkers also dealing with young people formally involved with the service at the second.\nBoth these observations \u00ad the emergence of a `new interventionist diversion' and the very\ndifferent forms this is taking in different local authority areas \u00ad raise important but very\nchallenging questions about what helps or hinders in terms of `system contact', which we\nreflect on further below.\nConclusion and Future Research Directions\nNewly developed diversionary approaches were represented as a `sea change' in prac-\ntice by some participants in our study. This article makes a case for a more complex\nreading, which reflects multiple understandings of diversion and its relation to other\nyouth justice priorities, particularly the prevention of crime. We have suggested that the\nmodels of pre-court work we observed do not represent an absolute break from the\n`new' youth justice established by the CDA 1998, since the elision between `diversion\nfrom the youth justice system' and `diversion from crime' that characterized New\nLabour's youth justice continues to shape some aspects of this work. Indeed, our par-\nticipants described an `interventionist diversion', where young people were `diverted\nfrom prosecution' and `into alternative services' which, though voluntary, closely\nresembled other formal interventions. Similarly, while some aspects of this work clearly\necho older forms of `diversion' - the embedding of the `risk factor prevention para-\ndigm' and the exportation of existing practice challenge easy comparisons with the past\n\u00ad it is not possible to understand current trends as simply the `rebirth' of the 1980s\n`orthodoxy' in youth justice practice (Bateman, 2012).\nOur research suggests that, while criminal justice agencies are responding to the same\nnational drivers of revised performance indicators and budgetary constraints following\nthe financial crisis of 2008 and the introduction of so-called `austerity' measures, the\nremoval of many of the mechanisms for standardized youth justice practice by the\nCoalition Government and broader diversification in local authority service structures\n(e.g. Fielder et al., 2008) have brought considerable local variation. Recent policy devel-\nopments in this area seem unlikely to reverse these practice trends. Sections 133-8 of\nLASPO specify the conditions for out-of-court disposals, but there is little detail about\nintervention requirements. Guidance recently issued on the new pre-court sentencing\nframework (Ministry of Justice and Youth Justice Board, 2013b) is non-statutory, and\nagain offers very little that is prescriptive in relation to the substance of intervention, par-\nticularly in terms of the pre-caution or `community resolution' work discussed above.\nThis diversity of practice has far-reaching consequences for youth justice scholarship. In\nthis area at least, the assumption that policy represents practice, while always reductive\n(Fergusson, 2007), is now unsound, while the assumption that findings can be easily\ntransferred even between local authority areas is questionable.\nAsnotedattheoutset,wesupportearlierresearch(forexample,CresseyandMcDermott,\n1974) and, more recently, Richards (2014) in highlighting the need to distinguish between\n`diverse diversions'. We are uncertain, however, that the conceptual disambiguation\nRichards (2014) recommends will significantly advance older debates about the appropri-\nate balance between `intervention' and `diversion' in youth justice without clear under-\nstanding of the specific relevant services in any given context. Unpicking the conditions\nunder which the lessons of the past can help understand the present is, we would argue,\nfirst an empirical task. Outcomes \u00ad both in terms of FTE statistics and long-term out-\ncomes for young people \u00ad will depend not only on the specific `diversionary' practices\nadopted in any given area but also, at least for vulnerable young people, on the broader\nnetwork of support services that sit outside the youth justice system and the connections\nbetween them. If researchers in England are able to exploit the current diversity of service\nprovision to arrive at more nuanced definitions of `system contact', as well as how this is\nexperienced by young people in trouble with the law, we may gain clearer understandings\nof when it helps or hinders. A focus, therefore, on youth justice processes rather than\noutcomes may provide transferable if not representative research findings, help unpick\nthe extent to which existing assumptions about `diversion' held by practitioners,\ncriminologists and policy makers apply to the current youth justice landscape, and forge\na new terrain of debate.\n"
