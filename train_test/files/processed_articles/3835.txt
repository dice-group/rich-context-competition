Other\nstudies since this time reveal barriers to desistance, such as substance misuse (McSweeny,\n2010), lack of housing (Edgar et al., 2012), difficulties in finding employment (Hlavka\net al., 2015) and the individual's lack of motivation or their inability to achieve status or\nSheffield desistance study also exposes the adverse impact of financial hardship and the\nattraction of further offending for those trying to stop (Bottoms and Shapland, 2011). The\ndesistance model arising from this research includes the meeting of obstacles, but holds\nthat, in the absence of a relapse, the desister will find reinforcers and go on to establish a\ncrime-free identity as a non-offender (Bottoms and Shapland, 2011: 70). This article on\nthe other hand, demonstrates how some desisters refrain from offending for long periods\nbut are not in a position to establish a new identity. The Sheffield study found a desistance\nstrategy among its participants of avoiding situations in which offending might happen,\nwhich the authors call `diachronic self-control' (Shapland and Bottoms, 2011: 274) and\nlargely see as adaptive (but see Bottoms, 2013, on self-binding). The studies discussed\nhere provide a crucial insight into how excessive diachronic control can lead to a restricted\nand impoverished existence.\nAlthough as discussed the challenges to desistance are acknowledged in the literature,\nthe maintenance of desistance is generally portrayed as a straightforwardly positive out-\ncome, both for the desister and for the wider community (Barry, 2010; Jamieson et al.,\nthis is not the reality for all those who are, in fact, desisting from crime. Instead, the\nexperience of `going straight' can be painful and lead to limited lives. In order to explain\nwhy some people suffer the `pains of desistance' identified, we introduce new subtleties\nof meaning in the desistance journey and the spheres in which desistance needs to be\nmaintained and supported in order to achieve the positive destinations described in the\nliterature. We draw on the findings of two qualitative studies with desisters in very dif-\nferent circumstances (young people with a short criminal career and men on licence after\na long period of incarceration), which show that these two groups of participants suffered\nvery similar pains of desistance.\nIt may be that research findings of desistance leading to redemption or `moral heroism'\n(Maruna, 2001: 95) are largely a product of retrospective studies, where people who have\nlong since desisted (and identify as such) are interviewed (Healy, 2010). For example,\nAresti et al. (2010) concentrated their research on men who were either studying at uni-\nversity level or had secured a conventional career. This focus meant that the likelihood\nthat such outcomes are (very) unusual after significant criminal involvement is not\naddressed. Similarly, Maruna explicitly acknowledges that his research excluded many\nex-offenders, as he only recruited those who either identified themselves as `successfully\nMaruna (2001: 44) notes, this means that those in between were not included in the\nresearch, despite the relative rarity of the desister and persister characteristics he describes.\nSome research studies have examined (in passing) what the experience of desistance\nis like for those who are less `successful' than Maruna's and Aresti's interviewees, but\nwho still seem to be managing to stay away from crime. In French research,\nmost desisters were found to live a `normal' life, concentrating on themselves and their\nfamilies, rather than trying to contribute to society at large (Herzog-Evans, 2011). Healy\n(2010) also found little evidence of generativity in a sample of desisters. However, these\ndesisters, while far from `moral heroes' still appeared content with their lot. Other\nresearch participants' experiences were closer to the ones we report here \u00ad with real pain\ninherent in the maintenance of desistance. Some of Appleton's (2010: 117) lifers on\nlicence had had to settle for `a menial and lonely existence' in which there were `many\ndesperate and monotonous periods'. Calverley's (2013) black and dual heritage desisters\nalso struggled, with peers still involved in criminal activity and families of origin and\nformation often dispersed, they tended to isolate themselves in order to maintain their\ndesistance. While there is evidence, then, that the journey of desistance is not necessarily\na pleasant one, little in-depth analysis has focused on the pains of desistance, their causes\nand likely outcomes. These are the issues this article aims to start to address.\nIn order to elucidate how different aspects of desistance cause different pains the con-\ncepts of `primary', `secondary' and `tertiary' desistance are drawn upon. Maruna and\nFarrall (2004) developed the concepts of primary and secondary desistance to mirror\nthose of primary and secondary deviance; primary desistance refers to a period of non-\noffending, and secondary desistance to a change in self-identity where the person no\nlonger thinks of themselves as an offender. The term tertiary desistance is now being used\nby McNeill (2016) to highlight another aspect necessary for long-term change: the recog-\nnition by others that one has changed and the development of a sense of belonging. If we\naccept that how we act depends on how we see ourselves, and that this depends, in turn,\non how we see ourselves reflected in the eyes of others (Weaver, 2013), which in turn\ndepends on how we act, then these terms delineate desistance in different spheres (the\nworld outside, within ourselves and in relation to others) rather than at different times.\nThis extends the analysis and understanding of deviation and desistance to be more than\na linear process. For this reason, we propose using the terms `act-desistance' for non-\noffending, `identity desistance' for the internalization of a non-offending identity and\n`relational desistance'for recognition of change by others. We argue that this terminology\ndescribes and differentiates between the different aspects of desistance better than `pri-\nmary', `secondary' and `tertiary' desistance, as it does not suggest sequencing in time or\nimportance.\nThis article furthermore distinguishes between different levels of relational desist-\nance, where the micro-level relates to the individual's immediate social setting, the\nmeso-level to their wider community and the macro-level to society as a whole. For\nexample, while employers are situated on the meso-level, the prevalent way in which\ncriminal records are dealt with in recruitment decisions would be on the macro-level.\nThose we interviewed were sometimes met with a measure of relational desistance on the\nmicro-level, but when relational desistance was not forthcoming at the meso- and/or\nmacro-level this undermined their act- and identity desistance and thereby threatened\nprogress. It is important to note here that act- and identity desistance are, while depend-\nent on others, something the individual can achieve. Relational desistance, on the other\nhand, is within the control of others. For example, it is up to the mother whether she will\naccept her son has changed, as it is up to the employer and society at large. However, the\ngreater the individual's social and bridging capital (Putnam, 2000), the greater the\nlikelihood that act- and identity desistance will be recognized and supported, especially\non the meso-level. Therefore, individuals can take steps towards relational desistance by\nextending and drawing on their formal and informal connections (Weaver, 2015), but this\narticle argues that, given the pains of desistance, our interviewees struggled to do so.\nResearch and Methodology\nThis article is based on two qualitative studies. Discussed first are the results from\nSchinkel's narrative cross-sectional study of 27 long-term prisoners at different\nstages of their sentence, conducted in 2009\u00ad2010. The discussion here focuses on the\ninterviews with nine men who were on licence after serving a long-term prison sen-\ntence. Many of these men had long histories of offending (for more information see\nSchinkel, 2014), with the youngest three in their late 20s, and the majority in their\nThe second research project, carried out by Nugent in 2012\u00ad2014, consisted of inter-\nviews with young people who could be defined as being in the transition to adulthood.\nDiscussed here are the findings from the interviews with five young people who had\noffended (four males and one female), aged between 16 and 21. All had received many\nyears of support from a third sector organization (Includem) and at the first interview\nwere about to end their contact with the service because they felt they were now in a\nstable position. All five were in the process of beginning act-desistance after a short\ncareer in offending. An attempt was made to interview each participant four times over a\nfieldwork period of 15 months, spaced at the two month, six months and 12 month fol-\nlow-up stage. In total, 15 interviews took place with this group and four followed up in\nthe final stage.\nIn both these research projects, narrative interviews were understood as being (more\nor less loosely) based on past happenings and pointing to future outcomes (Bell, 2002).\nHaving an inherently temporal thread, narratives were treated as `interpretive devices,\nthrough which people represent themselves, both to themselves and to others' (Lawler,\n2002: 242). As a consequence, narratives are influenced by the encounter in which they\nare told, with the audience and its reaction to what is said especially important\n(Pasupathi and Rich, 2005). As both projects were carried out by female researchers\nwho were ostensibly not involved in offending themselves, there may have been some\npressure on the interviewees to distance themselves from their past behaviour (see also\nAs both studies are based on fairly small samples, no attempts are made to identify\nhow common or typical these desistance narratives are among the larger populations\nfrom which our participants were drawn (young people with a short offending career and\nmen on licence after long-term imprisonment). Instead, we focus on theoretical generali-\nzation (Lewis and Ritchie, 2003): using our findings to identify concepts in these narra-\ntives to allow us to make connections that may apply beyond the immediate research\nsetting. The commonalities in the findings of the two different projects are at least sug-\ngestive that the pains of desistance we identify may be commonly experienced by differ-\nent groups of people trying to desist: by young people with limited offending careers and\nby older men convicted of much more serious (and usually numerous) crimes.\nDesistance after Long-Term Imprisonment\nThe men on licence after long-term imprisonment experienced three main (but intercon-\nnected) pains of desistance: isolation and loneliness; goal failure; and, increasingly, a\nlack of hope. As these men had been imprisoned long-term, it is difficult at times to dis-\ntinguish between the pains of desistance and the effects of institutionalization or their\nlife-long history of deprivation, which produced their own pains, as well as exacerbating\nthe pains of desistance.\nPain of isolation\nIsolation and loneliness were described by six out of the nine men. First of all, their\nattempt to avoid offending meant that they tended to isolate themselves. There were\nseveral reasons for this (more carefully elaborated in Schinkel, 2014). Needing to stay\naway from former friends (and enemies) who were still involved in offending, in\norder not to get pulled back into such behaviours, was one factor. Second, a history\nwith individual police officers (who might want to `get them one more time') coupled\nwith being on licence (and thus subject to immediate recall to custody) meant that\nthey felt much more vulnerable to criminal justice interference than others. The need\nto stay away from temptations, provocations and risk, combined with the effects of\ninstitutionalization, meant that they often just stayed in their accommodation, in\neffect reproducing some elements of their imprisonment: `[i]f I get a couple ah' drinks\nin me I go aff ma heid in two minutes. So (.) I find mysel' tae be confined to the hoose\na lot this time' (Jack).\nFor some, this new-found introversion also meant that they did not recognize them-\nselves, that they had lost their sense of self and personal identity. For almost all, there\nwas a sense of displacement, a sense that they were living a life with which they were\nunfamiliar:\nI've tried tae just thingmy away fae all that. It isnae an easy thing tae dae because my life, I'd\nbeen that used tae and, I could probably live my life back then wi my eyes shut, cause I knew\neverything and everything was just second nature to me. But trying tae come away fae that [...]\n(Lino)\nBefore the attempt to desist most had had fuller lives \u00ad full of associates, substance\nabuse, offending and excitement; not necessarily full of positive things, but full none-\ntheless. While in prison, many had become used to their lives in there, now sometimes\nlooked upon with nostalgia, so that institutionalization again interacted with the need\nto desist, to bring about a sense of displacement. Furthermore, as is evident from the\nabove, the men did not feel they had much control over their new, relatively barren,\nlives. The findings here suggest that in cases where diachronic self-control is made\nnecessary by external circumstance (see also below) and not combined with more\nactive forms of control, such as changing one's behavioural patterns and resisting\nopportunities to offend, it is not experienced as agentic and can lead to isolation and\nhopelessness.\nPain of goal failure\nThis lack of control was also a feature of another pain of desistance: the pain of goal\nfailure. For most of the men, their identity was in a liminal state \u00ad they were no\nlonger prisoners, but had not yet fully served their sentence, or achieved a new iden-\ntity. Some were able to draw upon identities that had preceded or followed their\nimprisonment, such as the identity of father or partner, but most (also) wanted to\nachieve other goals, usually employment, which would allow them to be the men\nthey wanted to become (see also Schinkel, 2014). Here, their wish to achieve identity\ndesistance conflicted with their criminal record and their previous experiences of\ndeprivation (which had left most with no qualifications or work experience) to pro-\nduce the pain of goal failure: since leaving prison (which for many was years in the\npast) most had not been able to take any meaningful steps towards their desired\nidentity:\nI was just away for another job interview there, two weeks ago, eehm, wi my wee brother, he\ngot the job, I got knocked back because of my conviction. That's what I found for the whole two\nyears, two and a half years, I don't really know if I'm ever going to get the chance to move on.\n(Andy, emphasis added)\nImportantly, their criminal record (and for some, being known in their neighbourhood)\nimpeded their progress through the effect it had on relational desistance. Many of these\nmen had achieved a measure of success on the micro-level of this sphere of desistance;\nthey had family members or a partner who believed in them and who provided much\nneeded support:\nI've been oot for a year / a year an a half it will be, and it's the longest I've ever been oot. The\nlongest I'd been oot before that was six month, that was the longest, so I've (.) quadrupled that,\nknow what I mean, really [...]. I think it's the girlfriend, know, keeping a (.) level heid on us an\nstuff like that know, but I think it's her basically, it's doon tae her, you know, tryin' for a family\nan stuff. (Smitty)\nBut because of their self-isolation, for most of the men contact with the meso-level of\ntheir communities was limited. Ironically, for many their main point of contact with the\nworld beyond their own home and family was their criminal justice social workers.\nWhile these were officially charged with the task of monitoring them, as representatives\nof the criminal justice system, and therefore had to deem the men as not yet having\ndesisted, in most of the men's experience their criminal justice social worker was a\nsource of hope and motivation:\nBut I'm grateful enough tae have [name of social worker] there and [name] there, [...] they help\nme aboot a good 98 per cent anyway [laughing], you know what I mean, I wouldnae be able tae\ndae it withoot them. (Jack)\nUnfortunately, while social workers had been mostly successful in tackling micro-level\nproblems for the men (e.g. housing, finances, health) they had been unable over the often\nquite extended time of the licence to provide enduring links to the meso- and macro-\nlevel, especially in relation to employment:\nI realize like [name of social worker]'s good. But he's no really/ he's no really got the powers\nthere tae change it or anything for me, tae help me really. He's helped me wi' small things like\nwhen I first came out [...] so I could get money and things like that. But now when it's getting\ntae the nitty gritty, my licence is going to end, I've got no job, it's looking like I'm no going to\nbe able to get a job, even though I've got quite a bit of a qualifications now, that's nae use tae\nme as well, so I'm kinda worried aboot it. (Andy)\nWithout any brokerage or leverage from others, when the men applied for jobs they were\nconfronted with a lack of relational desistance on the macro-level \u00ad being forced to dis-\nclose their records meant that they were unsuccessful in reaching their goals of gainful\nemployment, because society at large saw them as (potential) offenders rather than\ndesisters, and rejected them as such: `[y]ou've got the disclosure, it's/ as soon as people\nknow that you've been in so long and they don't want tae gi you a chance, so that's the\nhardest bit, for me anyway, I feel, getting employment' (Tim). This, in turn, could have\nramifications for their micro-level relationships, as some of their partners found it diffi-\ncult to accept the lack of progress.\nPain of hopelessness\nThe final pain of desistance was a product of the first two pains: not feeling able to fully\ntake part in life or to move towards their goals meant that many of the men were slowly\ngiving up hope for anything other than a life of merely existing. This hopelessness in turn\nundermined any zeal or motivation they might have had to achieve their original goals,\nleading to helplessness and apathy for many. They were losing sight of the happy endings\nthey had wished for themselves:\nI would love to have kids, I would love to be married, have a full time job, settle doon, you\nknow just have money, to have an easy life, a good life, you know [...] But to be honest I don't\nthink I'm gonnae get any legitimate work, not for a while anyway [...] Eeehm, just with my\ncriminal record, there's that many people looking for work just now that haven't got a criminal\nrecord. (Mohammed)\nIt is of interest that the three men on licence who did not describe isolating them-\nselves, and seemed to suffer less from the pains of desistance had other projects to occupy\nthemselves. Mark and Smitty were still learning to live without alcohol and drugs, while\nStephen was caring for his ill wife:\nTo come outside and actually test myself in my own wee flat, get up in the morning and actually\nface a day withoot a drink, you know what I mean, myself it's great, and naebody else tae depend\non, [...] I'm quite happy. I've no got much, I've no got much at all but I'm quite happy. (Mark)\nMark, Smitty and Stephen had something that provided their lives with a sense of pro-\ngress, and were not, at the moment, aspiring to goals that proved impossible for them to\nachieve. They did not face the frustration experienced by the other men, because they\nwere happy to (perhaps temporarily) confine their lives to the micro-level. The others\nwanted to link into the meso- and macro-levels, but because of their lack of goal achieve-\nment on these levels, were starting to withdraw more and more:\nI wasted all that time in prison and when you're in prison you want to get out so badly, but then\nwhen you're out you think `what's the point?'. That's what it was like and then I thought `do\nyou know something, there's that much I'm no doing, I mean I could be going paintballing,\nswimming, fishing, I could be going abroad, I could be doing this when I'm/ I'm not, I'm just\ndoing nothing basically, I'm just no living my life'. (Mohammed)\nIt is difficult to assess what the long-term outcomes for these men will be. Mark, Smitty\nand Stephen might eventually want to broaden their horizons, and either achieve their\ngoals or become as frustrated and hopeless as the others. Equally, they might just find\npeace within the micro-level world they live in. The others, confronted regularly with the\ndifficulty (or impossibility?) of living a fuller life, might well keep withdrawing to lessen\nthe frustration, and eventually accept their lessened and limited lives. Or, if they are\nlucky, their circumstances might change, they might achieve some goals, and start to\nprogress towards true relational and identity desistance. This is unlikely to happen for\nmany though, without significant changes in policy, the way in which offences are dis-\nclosed and perceptions of ex-prisoners in society. In the face of the strain created by their\ninability to achieve their aspirations, they might also return to `innovation' (Merton,\nDesistance after a Relatively Short `Criminal Career'\nAt the time of the first interview the ages of the desisting young people ranged from 16\nto 21. They had started offending around 13, with their offences increasing in serious-\nness, until between 15 and 20 years old. In the initial interviews they revealed conven-\ntional hopes of wanting to get a job, have their own place, meeting someone and `settling\nEmbarking on act-desistance was seen as the first step towards having a better future.\nPain of isolation\nThey had all been in gangs and spoke about this as though they had been part of a family,\nnot just in terms of loyalty (Warr, 2002), but also in terms of the emotional connections\nestablished, opportunity to share concerns, get advice, be vulnerable and achieve a sense\nof belonging. This emphasis on friendship is similar to past research with female gang\nmembers (Batchelor, 2009), pointing towards a more nuanced understanding of gang\nactivity for both genders: `We could be really close and if I had any problems I would say\nit to my pals [...] it is not as if they are bad boys, because they aren't' (John).\nIn the first interviews all participants had recently `knifed off' (Maruna and Roy,\n2007) from `territorial gangs' (Pickering et al., 2012). They found this painful but nec-\nessary in order to stop offending (Farrall, 2014). They had made a conscious decision\nto do so (Barry, 2006), and were proud of the strength they had shown in doing this.\nHowever, moving away from these peer groups in an attempt to achieve act-desistance\nmeant that they experienced the pains of isolation. With few new relationships taking\nthe place of the ones they were forced to end, like the men on licence the young people\ndescribed spending their time by staying mainly indoors. They did not experience the\nsame levels of surveillance from the state as the men on licence (or face the same con-\nsequences for any incident), but suffered similar loneliness. Tony admitted that he was\nscared of being `out', saying that `everyone where I stay is either involved in the gang\nor the gang goes after them'. While not unjustified in this view, it was apparent that as\nhe became more secluded his fears became more entrenched, reaffirming the link\nbetween isolation and fear (Gadd and Jefferson, 2007). By the final interview, he\nseemed to be wary of everyone:\nI want to have a life that I don't have to watch all the time over my shoulder. I want to be able\nto walk about freely. Basically, be able to walk to the shop without looking over my back and\nall that stuff.\nThe other young people also admitted to being fearful and `looking over their shoulders';\ntheir locality had been transformed from a place of sociability and fun, mixed in with fear\n(McVie, 2010), to a place only of fear of the potential risk of reprisal. Desistance research\nhighlights the importance of spatial dynamics (Farrall, 2014) \u00ad these young people\nviewed the spaces in which they lived as increasingly threatening, which they `coped'\nwith through self-isolation.\nThe transition to adulthood is recognized as a time when social networks usually\nexpand (Cotterell, 2007). For this group though, their networks continually shrank, exac-\nerbating the pain of isolation. Family connections were tenuous and particularly rare for\nthe young men, as their family had given up on them when they had been offending.\nNotably, three of them made no attempts to re-establish those relationships:\nI used to have contact with my dad, but now I don't bother with that, he keeps to himself and I\ndo the same, I don't try to put myself out there, I would be embarrassed if he didn't want to\nknow. (Mark)\nIn contrast, the young woman, Amy, worked hard to repair connections with her family,\nwho acknowledged that she had turned her life around. Therefore her act-desistance had\nbeen accompanied by relational desistance at the micro-level. Her family's changed view\nof her had a significant impact in helping her to see herself as someone who could have\na better life, thereby supporting her identity desistance: `I feel like I have been more\nwanted since I did a big massive change. I think that I needed to change to prove to\nmyself as well as everyone else' (Amy). This supports the finding in previous research\nthat women may be more `relational'in their attempts to move towards desistance (Barry,\n2006, 2010). However, crucially the young men interviewed did not avoid their families\nbecause they did not want to reconnect with them, but because they were fearful of rejec-\ntion. By the final interviews, Kevin described having no support at all in life and three\nothers were entirely reliant on their girlfriend for company and to act as a motivator to\nmaintain their desistance. Their access to relational desistance (even on the micro-level)\ntherefore was extremely limited.\nInterviewer: And what are the things that help you to stay away from offending?\nTony: Just Amanda that is all.1\nAlthough there is increasing evidence of the positive influence a girlfriend can have on\nhelping the desistance process (Bottoms and Shapland, 2014; Laub and Sampson, 2003),\nthere is less research on the effect that this may have on the person in question (Halsey\nand Deegan, 2015). Only one girlfriend agreed to be interviewed, which revealed the\npressure she felt from being the single stable focal point to promote change, raising ques-\ntions about sustainability of such support. This also means that the micro-level relational\ndesistance relied on by the men on licence who only had their partner to support them\nmight be less reliable than it appeared in the interviews.\nPain of goal failure\nLike the men on licence, the young men struggled to attain a new identity and therefore\nsuffered the pain of goal failure. The transition to adulthood is defined as a liminal stage\nin life where identity is still being shaped and formed (Barry, 2006; Turner, 1964). This\ngroup moved from being clearly defined as `offenders' to being unsure of who they\nwanted to or could be. Both Tony and Kevin highlighted the detrimental impact of hav-\ning a lack of access to `acting out' an alternative identity. Kevin missed the status that\ncrime had given him and had been unable to recreate a pro-social identity of any similar\nstanding, a barrier to desistance reflected in other research (Healy, 2010). Tony had not\nre-offended and thus had been successful in act-desistance, but without a job had not\nachieved identity desistance and was just living day to day, merely existing.\nIn past research with women offenders, the role of `mother' has been identified as a\ncrucial script to retain or build upon aiding desistance (Rumgay, 2004). This has been\nconfirmed by more recent research by Sharpe (2015), but this also found that the\nstigma of past offending undermined identity desistance and those interviewed reported\nfeeling judged as maternally deficient, even after they had not offended in a long time.\nAs pointed out, being a mother ought not to be the only `alternative' available for\nwomen (Weaver and McNeill, 2007). In this research, David and John were becoming\nfathers, a role that they felt defined them positively and was a major `turning point' in\nhow they regarded themselves and how they were regarded by others (Giordano et al.,\n2002). However, this new identity did not suffice, as both also wanted to get a job.\nEmployment has been shown to be a means of doing masculinity and of achieving a\nsense of pride and fulfilment post desistance (Uggen, 2000; Weaver, 2015). Like the\nwomen in Sharpe's study, these men had precarious identities and their identity desist-\nance remained fragile.\nAchieving the goal of employment was as difficult for the young men as for the men\non licence, with traditional paths to adulthood, such as from school to work which were\nreadily available in the 1950s and 1960s in these areas no longer accessible in the same\nway (Coles, 1997). Like the men on licence, the young people found themselves at the\nvery bottom of the employment ladder; on the outskirts of the `the precariat': those who\nface uncertainty, instability and lack occupational identity (Standing, 2011: 8). The situ-\nation they faced as a consequence exacerbated the pain of goal failure. They felt that the\ncourses they were forced to take as a condition of receiving Job Seeker'sAllowance were\nmeaningless, realizing that these did not lead to employment. Given that some had\nalready completed the same courses previously, the requirement to attend them again\nmade them feel like their time was unimportant. The significant challenges of surviving\non benefits similarly contributed to the pain of goal failure:\nI just want to get a job and get a life. I don't want to live off the brew and get stoned and getting\nin trouble with the police and end up in jail, I am trying to dodge all that. (Tony)\nWith fatherhood the only alternative identity to which the young men in this research\nhad access, it is clear that both men and women are held back by limited opportunities\nand a lack of social and bridging capital to establish pro-social identities. Unlike past\nresearch with young people in the transition to adulthood who were optimistic about the\nfuture (Arnett, 2006), these young people felt `stuck' (Pickering et al., 2012).\nPain of hopelessness\nLike the men on licence, the young men were increasingly losing hope due to their lone-\nliness and goal failure as shown by the following interview excerpt:\nInterviewer:\nLast time I spoke to you, you said that getting a job was a certainty. Do\nyou still feel that way?\nDavid:\nI don't know, I just have to take every day as it comes and see how it\ngoes.\nWhile Standing (2011) emphasizes the potential danger in the anger generated by the\ndisappointment or `strain' faced by the `precariat', these young people had simply a loss\nof hope. By the final interviews three of the four men had generally given up on getting\na job. The new identity offered to John and David by fatherhood provided some hope, but\nit did not fulfil their own goals, notably employment. Whereas John dealt with this by\naccepting his situation and thus limiting his ambitions, David continued to be frustrated.\nHis hope had become a source of pain.\nThe possible and dire consequences of growing hopelessness as a result of isolation\nand goal failure were illustrated clearly by Kevin. He struggled to name anyone he could\nrely on after he had left Includem. He tried desperately to make something of himself and\nto prove to his family that he was worthy of a second chance. However, unable to get a\njob and being repeatedly confronted with his lack of education and prospects, his attempts\nat act-desistance in a relational vacuum, eventually became too much for too little, and\nhe cracked. By the final interview he had re-offended and had committed his most seri-\nous offence to date. His exasperation with his mere existence was exposed as he said the\nnight of the offence he had had enough and went `looking for a fight'and took his chance\nwhen he got it.\nInterviewer: Is there anything you fear losing if you went to prison?\nKevin: Nothing.\nInterviewer: Nothing?\nKevin: Nothing.\nConversely, despite the posited limited availability of scripts other than motherhood to\ndesisting women, Amy was forging ahead in discovering a new identity (Maruna, 2001),\nillustrating how the achievement of early goals and recognition by others can sustain\ndesistance. By the final interview, because of the self-belief built as the result of reconnect-\ning with her family and significant support from the Includem worker, she was seriously\nconsidering going to college. Through help with access to funding and making the option\naccessible, her worker acted as what Nugent (under review) defines as a `meso-broker',\nsupporting Amy to reach beyond the micro-level to begin to create a realistic blueprint on\nwhich a new `possible self' could be operationalized (Paternoster and Bushway, 2009).\nThrough being accepted as a student on the meso-level of relational desistance, it seemed\nlikely that Amy would be able to further consolidate her identity desistance.\nThe above discussion shows that hope is fragile and requires markers, events and\nother people for it to be built, maintained and sustained. In the face of a lack of relational\ndesistance and limited opportunities to achieve identity desistance, it is not surprising\nthat hope is rapidly lost.\nDiscussion\nDespite the two groups of interviewees discussed in this article being very different in\nterms of their `criminal career' and stage of life, the similarities in their attempts to\ndesist and the pains endured are striking. These studies show that maintaining act-\ndesistance can lead to the pain of isolation, while the need to achieve identity desist-\nance in the face of a lack of relational desistance or social capital leads to the pain of\ngoal failure. Although similar in terms of the pains they suffered, the two groups of\ninterviewees faced different barriers contributing to these pains. For example, while\nthe young people spoke in-depth about the way in which spatial dynamics contributed\nto their isolation, the self-isolation of the men on licence was a result of institutionali-\nzation and a sense of surveillance as well as the desire to achieve act-desistance.\nUnderpinning these pains of desistance and largely left unacknowledged in this article,\nis the context of inequality, structural limitations and poverty in which the participants\nThe research offers a valuable insight into the interdependence of act-desistance, iden-\ntity desistance and relational desistance; without each of these in place `success' will\nremain limited or fragile. The interviewees'main action in establishing act-desistance was\nto `knife off' relationships with their peers, offending opportunities and their anti-social\npast (Maruna and Roy, 2007; Weaver and McNeill, 2014). The inability to connect to pro-\nsocial networks or new activities meant that most experienced the pain of isolation; in this\nway `knifing off' contained an element of self-harm for these people, and one that may\nhave serious repercussions. Loneliness can lead to a downward spiral of decreasing self-\nesteem and self-confidence, and has been causally linked to serious mental health prob-\nWhile some of the men on licence were met with relational desistance on the\nmicro-level, thus having some support for their identity of non-offender, for others\nthis level of relational desistance was absent or fragile. With the exception of one\nyoung woman, no one had encountered relational desistance on the meso- or macro-\nlevel, which was experienced as painful by those who needed such connections to\nachieve their goals, notably employment. In the face of this inability and that of being\nrecognized as non-offenders by the world at large, most participants were stuck in a\nliminal position: neither offenders nor those who have `made good'. Achieving an\nalternative pro-social identity was difficult, with fatherhood, caring for a loved one or\nbeing in recovery from drug- or alcohol addiction the few accessible options. Most\nwere focused on gaining employment and failure to achieve this meant that identity\ndesistance remained out of reach.\nBoth studies highlight the importance of hope, reaffirming the conclusions of past\nings presented here it is clear that enduring failure and a lack of recognition from others\nthat one has changed undermine hope. Without hope, not only does sustained desistance\nbecome less probable, but life becomes less fulfilling (Burns, 2012).\nUnfortunately, the studies discussed did not include long-term follow-up inter-\nviews, but Kevin's return to prison shows that act-desistance sometimes does not sur-\nvive a lack of identity and relational desistance. While the men on licence were\nsustaining act-desistance, the fact that many of them had been released for years and\nnot managed to achieve lives that they felt were meaningful shows that long periods of\nlives may be blighted by the pains of desistance. Overall, this article shows that desist-\nance for some is not just a `process' but rather more like an endurance test with little\nto no reward for their efforts. As a society we should question whether mere act-desist-\nance is really sufficient for our purposes (as it seems to be) or whether we want more\nthan empty, limited lives for people who are making the considerable effort to desist\nfrom crime. If so, we need to do more to those who are trying to help themselves, to\nnot just `go straight' but to `go somewhere new'.\nWays Forward?\nThis article suggests that one of the ways in which identity desistance should be sup-\nported is through connections beyond the micro-level. Halsey and Deegan (2015) simi-\nlarly found that any move from a spoiled to a legitimate identity ideally should reach\nbeyond the family sphere. McNeill (2006) has also argued that the odds of sustained\ndesistance improve when ex-offenders develop social links with people in different\nsocial hierarchies because it enables them to access wider social resources. Getting jobs,\ntaking up new hobbies and being exposed to new experiences assist desisters in `moving\non'and building a new life, rather than merely existing (Healy, 2010; Laub and Sampson,\n2003; Weaver, 2013). Such experiences also mean that the `new'identity is acted out and\naffirmed by a wider audience and identity desistance consolidated at a deeper level. To\nachieve this, desisters need access to social and bridging capital (Putnam, 2000), to move\nbeyond the micro-level which can be provided by meso-brokers helping individuals to\nfind in-routes and pathways to break through to the meso-level.\nHowever, the suggestions above place all the responsibility for breaking through to\nthe meso-level with the ex-offender and those close to them. In order to make access to\nthe meso-level and beyond available to all desisters (e.g. access to employment and\nactive citizenship), a cognitive transformation about `ex-offenders' is required within\nsociety. Reformation of the Rehabilitation of the Offenders Act 1974 would be one step\nforward, so that where appropriate, those who have offended and fulfilled their sentence\ncan actually move on with their lives and are no longer second class citizens in the job\nmarket.2 Beyond this, there is strong evidence from countries such as Finland that a\nchange of mindset in society led by those in power is possible and can have lasting\nEmployers also have a role to play and arguably some have already been exercising their\nown form of leadership and autonomy on the meso-level. The company Timpson actively\nrecruits from prisons so that those coming out have support, and a job and direct access to\nthe meso-level. Furthermore, organizations like Recruit with Conviction are encouraging\nmore employers to do the same (as well as trying to create a societal change on the macro-\nlevel in how ex-offenders are perceived and treated). This is an example of those from above\nreaching down to those below to give them a step up, thereby acting as meso-brokers.\nTo tackle the pain of isolation and the lack of micro-level relational desistance in\nthe current context of social inequality and injustice, sharing the difficult journey of\ndesistance might be another way forward. If desisters connect with others who have\nthe same hopes and ambitions, and who have to overcome the same obstacles, the\npain of isolation will be lessened and identity desistance may be better sustained.\nThe idea of `mutual aid' or co-desistance is fairly new, and undoubtedly will have\nopponents who deem it a risk. However, it can and has been successful (Nugent,\nporting each other, desisters might play a valuable role in helping each other towards\na new identity.\nThis article has brought together two studies of desistance: one with young people\nwho had a relatively short career in offending and one with older men who were on\nlicence after long-term imprisonment. The narrative methods adopted allowed for a valu-\nable in-depth examination of the challenges and pains of desistance endured, with most\nparticipants becoming increasingly isolated, lonely, lacking in hope and losing sight of a\nhappy ending. Indeed, it is almost difficult to rationalize participants'continued attempts\nat `making good' in the absence of any rewards. We hope that this article will open up\ndialogue about the destinations we want for those who are travelling the road of desist-\nance, and how these can best be supported.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/\nor publication of this article: Briege Nugent's work was supported by the Economic Social\nResearch Council [grant number ES/J500136/1].
