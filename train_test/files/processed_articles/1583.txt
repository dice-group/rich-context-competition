We divided the race-county combinations of the US population\ninto eight distinct groups, referred to as the ``eight Americas,'' to explore the causes of the\ndisparities that can inform specific public health intervention policies and programs.\nMethods and Findings\nThe eight Americas were defined based on race, location of the county of residence,\npopulation density, race-specific county-level per capita income, and cumulative homicide rate.\nData sources for population and mortality figures were the Bureau of the Census and the\nNational Center for Health Statistics. We estimated life expectancy, the risk of mortality from\nspecific diseases, health insurance, and health-care utilization for the eight Americas. The life\nexpectancy gap between the 3.4 million high-risk urban black males and the 5.6 million Asian\nfemales was 20.7 y in 2001. Within the sexes, the life expectancy gap between the best-off and\nthe worst-off groups was 15.4 y for males (Asians versus high-risk urban blacks) and 12.8 y for\nfemales (Asians versus low-income southern rural blacks). Mortality disparities among the eight\nAmericas were largest for young (15\u00ad44 y) and middle-aged (45\u00ad59 y) adults, especially for\nmen. The disparities were caused primarily by a number of chronic diseases and injuries with\nwell-established risk factors. Between 1982 and 2001, the ordering of life expectancy among\nthe eight Americas and the absolute difference between the advantaged and disadvantaged\ngroups remained largely unchanged. Self-reported health plan coverage was lowest for\nwestern Native Americans and low-income southern rural blacks. Crude self-reported health-\ncare utilization, however, was slightly higher for the more disadvantaged populations.\nConclusions\nDisparities in mortality across the eight Americas, each consisting of millions or tens of\nmillions of Americans, are enormous by all international standards. The observed disparities in\nlife expectancy cannot be explained by race, income, or basic health-care access and utilization\nalone. Because policies aimed at reducing fundamental socioeconomic inequalities are\ncurrently practically absent in the US, health disparities will have to be at least partly addressed\nthrough public health strategies that reduce risk factors for chronic diseases and injuries.\nThe Editors' Summary of this article follows the references.\nIntroduction\nHealth disparities in the United States have been the\nsubject of extensive critical scrutiny and analysis. Multiple\ninvestigations have documented the consistent gap in all\nmeasures of mortality by race, particularly between black and\nwhite Americans [1\u00ad5]. Researchers have also drawn attention\nto substantial disparities in mortality and functional health\nstatus nationally and within race groups in relation to\nincome, social class, education, and community character-\nistics [6\u00ad16]. Inequalities in insurance coverage, health-care\naccess and utilization, and more recently in quality of care\nhave also been investigated [17\u00ad22]. The Department of\nHealth and Human Services has launched its Initiative to\nEliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health, with\nprograms focused on a number of diseases including\ncardiovascular disease, HIV, and diabetes.\nfor Asian females to 68.7 for black males, a gap of 18 y.\nAnalysis of life expectancy by county of residence and by the\ncombination of race and county of residence (referred to as\n``race-county'' in this paper) demonstrates even larger\ndisparities [23]. County-level analysis of mortality for 1997\u00ad\n2001 (pooled over 5 y to increase sample size) demonstrates a\n22.5-y gap in life expectancy between males in southwest\nSouth Dakota and females in Stearns County, Minnesota (see\nDataset S1 for life expectancy by county). When race-county\ncombinations are considered, life expectancy disparities are\ndramatically larger. For example, Native American males in\nthe cluster of Bennet, Jackson, Mellette, Shannon, Todd, and\nWashabaugh Counties in South Dakota had a life expectancy\nCounty, New Jersey, with a life expectancy of 91 y, a gap of 33\ny (see also Figure 1). Mortality inequalities in subgroups\nwithin race-counties, such as those defined based on socio-\neconomic status (SES), may be even larger. Because of small\nsample size and the absence of individual-level linked data\nneeded to study race-county-SES combinations, it is currently\nnot possible to study mortality patterns within race groups in\nsmall geographic areas, or even states. The largest measurable\ngaps observed in the US to-date are those revealed by\nexamining the inequalities across race-county groups.\nFormulating effective policies and programs to ameliorate\nhealth inequalities requires an understanding of the interre-\nlated causes of mortality disparities, specific interventions to\nmitigate these causes, and intervention delivery mechanisms\n[24,25]. Efforts to characterize the contributions of specific\ndiseases and injuries, risk factors such as tobacco, alcohol, or\nobesity, access to effective health care, and the broader\nsocioeconomic determinants of health and disease are\nseverely hampered by data limitations: the analysis of\nmortality by age and disease for specific race-counties is\naffected by the small numbers of deaths, such that even\npooling data for 10 y or more does not provide sufficient\nperson-years of observation to draw stable and robust\nconclusions for some diseases, especially by age. Data on risk\nfactor exposure and health-care access and utilization are\neven more limited, as there are almost no sources of\ninformation on these variables by race and county.\nIn order to investigate the causes of the observed race-\ncounty mortality disparities, within the limitations posed by\nsample size, we have divided US race-counties into eight\nsubgroups based on a number of sociodemographic and\ngeographical variables, referred to as the ``eight Americas''. In\naddition to examining the role of specific diseases in age-\nspecific and all-age mortality disparities, the eight Americas\nanalysis identifies distinct subgroups, based on a small number\nof sociodemographic and geographical indicators, towards\nwhom public health and medical interventions may be\ntargeted. We emphasize that the grouping of US race-counties\ninto the eight Americas in our analysis is not the only division\nthat could be used for understanding the large mortality\ninequalities across racecounties. This grouping however\nreveals important variations in total as well as age-, sex-, and\ndisease-specific mortality that call for further investigation of\ncauses and potential interventions.\nMethods\nDefinition of the Eight Americas\nWe estimated life expectancy for eight subgroups of the US\npopulation, which we refer to as the ``eight Americas.'' The\nbuilding blocks for the eight Americas were a combination of\nrace and county of residence. The race-county units were\ncombined based on a number of socioeconomic and geo-\ngraphical indicators, including the location of the county of\nresidence, population density, race-specific county-level per\ncapita income, and cumulative homicide rate (Table 1; Figure 2).\nmerged county units. There were two reasons for forming\nmerged county units. (1) To avoid very small county\npopulations and numbers of deaths, smaller counties were\nmerged with adjacent counties to form units with total\nMerged county units were also formed where necessary to\naccount for changes in county status and county lines, such as\nformations of new counties and incorporation of independent\ncities (which are officially equivalent to counties) into\nsurrounding counties. The result was a consistent set of\n2,072 individual or merged county units that represent the\nsame physical land areas from 1980 through the present. We\nthen divided the entire US population (the race-county units)\ninto eight distinct subgroups, the eight Americas, based on the\nlocation of the county of residence, population density, per\ncapita income of the county of residence in 1990, and\nto reduce sensitivity to outlier years) (Table 1; Figure 2). We\nused a population density of greater than 100 persons/km2 to\ndistinguish urban from rural areas. Low-income race-county\ncombinations were defined as those below the national median\nof race-specific county-level per capita income. Cumulative\nhomicide rate was used as an indicator of deterioration of\nsocial institutions and neighborhood cohesion. These factors\nhave been found to adversely affect health outcomes above\nand beyond individual characteristics [26,27]. High-risk urban\nareas were defined as those where the cumulative probability\nof homicide death between the ages of 15 and 74 exceeded the\n95th percentile of all US counties, or 1.1%.\nData Sources for Population, Mortality, and\nSociodemographic Indicators\nBureau of the Census population estimates and National\nCenter for Health Statistics bridged-race population esti-\nMortality Disparities in the US\ncensual figures, assuming a constant growth rate. For 1990\u00ad\n2001, we used the bridged-race population estimates, released\nby the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), to be\nconsistent with race categories used in mortality registration\nManagement and Budget definition of the four race groups\n(Asians, blacks, Native Americans, and whites), which has\nbeen preserved in the bridged and censual population\nestimates. Race-specific county income was from the 1990\nNCHS mortality statistics. All deaths occurring in the US\nare reported to the NCHS, with causes of deaths coded to\nfollow the International Classification of Disease system.\nNCHS data also include county of residence (matched to the\nUS census), race, sex, and age. Public-use mortality files,\navailable through the NCHS [30] or the National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, do not provide county identifiers for\nobtained county identifiers for all deaths for years 1982\nthrough 2001 through a special request to the NCHS. County\nidentifiers for years after 2002 were not provided to us\nbecause of changes in NCHS policy. NCHS race categories\nwere collapsed into the four Office of Management and\nBudget categories. A very small proportion (,0.001%) of all\ndeaths were classified as ``other race.'' We assumed these\ndeaths to be among Asians, the group with the best mortality\nexperience, in order not to overestimate disparities.\nDespite the fact that we used the NCHS bridged-race\npopulation estimates, which are estimated for consistency of\nrace definitions with those in death certificates and mortality\nstatistics, there may be differential under- or overestimation\nof race-specific population and mortality. This can occur\nbecause race is recorded by individuals or their families in the\nFigure 1.

This differential\nrecording system is a potential source of bias in life\nexpectancy, especially for the smaller race groups: Native\nAmericans and Asians [1,31]. The bias for Native Americans\nobserved in national data is unlikely to affect our estimates\nbecause the grouping used in the eight Americas distin-\nguishes those Native Americans who primarily live on or near\nreservations (America 5), and are hence less likely to be\nundercounted, from the remaining Native Americans, who\nare included in America 3. For Asians, this source of bias was\naddressed by adjusting population and mortality for differ-\nential underestimation using the National Mortality Follow-\nback Survey [1,31]. Following Hahn and Eberhardt [1], age-\nand sex-specific correction factors were applied to popula-\ntion and mortality figures for Asians (America 1), with the\nexcess mortality or population coming from Middle America\n(America 3), the group to which Asians are most likely to be\nmisclassified.\nData Sources on Health Plan Coverage and Health-Care\nUtilization\nData on health plan coverage and health-care utilization\nwere from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\n(BRFSS). The BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional telephone\nsurvey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention and state health departments. The BRFSS uses a\nmultistage cluster design based on random-digit dialing to\nselect a representative sample from each state's noninstitu-\ntionalized civilian residents aged 18 y and older, and is\ndescribed in detail elsewhere [32,33] and in online documen-\ntation (http://www.cdc.gov/brfss). The BRFSS questionnaire\nprimarily focuses on personal risk behaviors and exposures,\nbut also includes questions on health plan coverage and\naveraged to reduce sensitivity to interannual fluctuations.\nCounties were matched to the appropriate America using the\nstandardized Federal Information Processing Standards\n(FIPS) county codes. Counties with unidentifiable codes\n(,1% of all counties) were excluded from the analysis. The\nBRFSS survey instrument on health-care access asks about\nhealth-care coverage status including health insurance,\nprepaid plans such as HMOs, and government programs\nsuch as Medicare or Medicaid. The BRFSS also asks about\ntime since the last routine checkup. BRFSS data from the\nvariable was not included in the 2003 BRFSS).\nData for International Comparisons\nData on life expectancy and probabilities of death (all-\ncause and disease-specific) for international comparisons\nwere from the Global Burden of Disease databases, main-\ntained by the World Health Organization [34,35].\nAnalysis Methods\nPeriod all-cause and cause-eliminated life expectancies and\nprobabilities of death were calculated using standard demo-\ngraphic life-table techniques [36].\nResults\nDefinitions of the Eight Americas\nTable 1 summarizes the characteristics of the eight\nAmericas (see also Figures S1 and S2). America 1 consists of\nAsians, excluding those living in counties where Pacific\nIslanders make up more than 40% of the total Asian\npopulation. Asians in the latter group of counties were\nincluded in America 3. The 10.1 million Asians in America 1\nTable 1.

America 2 consists of northland\n(Minnesota, the Dakotas, Iowa, Montana, and Nebraska)\nlow-income rural white populations, with income and\neducation below the national average. America 3 is Middle\nAmerica, the large fraction of the US population that has\nslightly above-average per capita income and education. This\ngroup largely consists of white Americans (98% of America\n3), but also includes small numbers of Asians and Native\nAmericans living in counties that are not included in\nAmericas 1 and 5. America 4 consists of low-income white\npopulations in Appalachia and the Mississippi Valley, 30% of\nwhom have not completed high school. America 5 is made up\nof Native Americans living in the West, excluding the West\nCoast. The majority of this group lives on or near\nreservations, mostly in the Four Corners region (where the\nborders of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet)\nor the Dakotas. America 7 comprises low-income rural blacks\nin the Mississippi Valley and the Deep South. America 8\nincludes blacks living in high-risk urban environments.\nAmerica 6 represents the rest of black America, living mostly\nin urban or semi-urban counties.\nMortality Experiences of the Eight Americas\nFigure 3 summarizes the mortality experiences for the\nage groups and diseases in Figure 4A for 2001.

Therefore, although many second-\ngeneration (US-born) Asians have entered the adult cohorts,\nthe sustained gap between America 1 and other groups has\nnot narrowed over the last 20 y (see also Singh and Miller [4]).\nThe gap between the life expectancy of the 3.4 million\nblack males in high-risk urban areas in America 8 and the life\nexpectancy for the 5.5 million Asian females in America 1 in\noff and the worst-off groups was 15.4 y for males (Asians\nversus blacks in high-risk urban areas) and 12.8 y for females\n(Asians versus low-income southern rural blacks). These gaps\nare 2.4 and 2.8 times those between white and black life\nexpectancies for the nation as a whole for males and females,\nbetween Americas 1 and 8 for males widened significantly,\nmostly because of higher HIV and homicide death rates.\nExcluding this period, the gap in male life expectancy\nbetween Americas 1 and 8 increased by half a year between\nwhen there was an unexplained decline in life expectancy of\nAsian females, the gap in female life expectancy between\nAmericas 1 and 8 declined by 2.5 y; the gap in life expectancy\nbetween Asian females and low-income southern rural black\nThe 12.8-y gap in life expectancy between females in\nAmericas 1 and 7 is approximately the same as the gap\nbetween Japan, with the highest national life expectancy for\n[34]. Asian females in the US have a life expectancy that is 3 y\nhigher than that of females in Japan [34]. For males, the 15.4-y\ngap in life expectancy between Asians (America 1) and high-\nrisk urban blacks (America 8) is the same as between Iceland,\nand Sao Tome, Belarus, and Uzbekistan [34]. In other words,\nmillions of Americans, distinctly identified by their socio-\ndemographic characteristics and place of residence, have life\nexpectancies that are similar to some low-income developing\ncountries (see also Figure 4B).\nThe eight Americas classification reveals that within the\nwhite population there is a wide variation in health\nexperience that cannot be explained by differences in average\nincome: low-income white rural populations in Minnesota, the\nDakotas, Iowa, Montana, and Nebraska (America 2), with a life\nrespectively, have a substantial advantage over the rest of\nwhite America, despite a large income disadvantage. Low-\nincome whites in Appalachia and the Mississippi Valley\n(America 4), with an average income level similar to that of\nAmerica 2, have a life expectancy equal to those of Mexico and\nPanama. The life expectancy gap between whites in America 2\nrespectively, comparable to the 6.4- and 4.6-y gaps between\nwhites and blacks as a whole. The gap between whites in\nwhen it was 3.0 and 2.4 y for males and females respectively;\nBecause America 3 is the largest subgroup of the US\npopulation, we investigated the potential role of sociodemo-\ngraphic and geographical predictors used to define the eight\nAmericas in morality patterns within America 3. County-level\nexpectancy for whites in America 3 (98% of America 3 are\nwhites) was 77.1 y, with a standard deviation of 1.7 y. The\ncorrelation coefficient between county-level life expectancy\nranged from 76.7 to 78.3 y in the quartiles of county-level per\ncapita income; it ranged from 77.0 to 78.6 y in quartiles of\ncounty-level education (based on proportion who have\ncompleted high school). The highest county-level education\nquartile consistently had the highest life expectancy over\ntime, but there was no consistent education gradient for the\nother three quartiles. There was also no obvious geographical\npattern in mortality in America 3 (Figure 1). For example, life\nexpectancy for counties east and west of the Mississippi River\nAlthough at the national level Native Americans seemingly\nhad a life expectancy equal to or higher than whites, Native\nAmericans living in the West, mostly on or near reservations\n(America 5) and with the lowest per capita income of all the\neight Americas had a major mortality disadvantage. Life\nexpectancies for America 5 were 5.9 and 4.3 y lower than\nMiddle America (America 3) for males and females, respec-\ntively, in 2001. Cause-of-death analysis for America 5\ndemonstrates that this Native American population has very\nhigh rates of mortality from alcohol-related causes such as\nroad traffic accidents and cirrhosis of the liver, as well as\ndiabetes (Figure 4A). Across the three black Americas (black\nMiddle America, southern low-income rural, and high-risk\nurban), the gap in life expectancy in 2001 was 1 y for females\nand nearly 3 y for males. The male gap was as wide as 4 y in\nthe mid-1990s, with the subsequent decline mostly due to\nreduction in HIV/AIDS mortality.\nAge and Disease Patterns of Mortality in the Eight\nAmericas\nFigure 4 shows mortality risk in four age groups (0\u00ad4, 15\u00ad\ncompares Americas 1 and 8 with countries and regions at a\nrange of mortality levels including Japan, the United King-\ndom, the Russian Federation, and the high-mortality coun-\ntries of sub-Saharan Africa.

This pattern is partly because of the\ngenerally higher mortality in this age group and possibly also\nbecause of cohort effects.\nThe mortality disparities in the eight Americas are largest\nIn these age groups, blacks living in high-risk urban areas\n(America 8) have mortality risks more similar to ones in the\nRussian Federation and sub-Saharan Africa, which are\nsubstantially higher than those in America 1, Japan, or the\nhigh-risk urban areas (America 8) were, respectively, 3.8 and\n3.4 times as likely as those in America 1 to die before the age\nage of 45. The disparity in young and middle-aged adult\nmortality between America 8 and America 1 has increased\nmen and women, respectively. The excess young and middle-\naged mortality persists after removing the effects of HIV and\nhomicide (Figure 5B). Rather, the major mortality gradients\nin these age groups are observed for injuries, cardiovascular\ndiseases, and other noncommunicable causes such as liver\ncirrhosis and diabetes (Figure 4A). Injuries are especially\nimportant for the observed mortality gradients between the\nHealth-Care Access and Utilization\nFigure 6A shows self-reported health plan coverage in the\neight Americas.

For both\nmales and females, the rates of routine checkup are slightly\nhigher in Americas 6, 7, and 8, the groups with mortality\ndisadvantage.\nDiscussion\nThe eight Americas in this paper consist of distinct\nsubgroups of the US population defined based on a small\nnumber of sociodemographic and geographical indicators\nincluding race, the location of the county of residence,\npopulation density, race-specific county-level per capita\nincome, and cumulative homicide rate. Put in a global\ncontext, the disparities in mortality experiences among the\neight Americas, each consisting of millions or tens of millions\nof Americans, are enormous. The eight Americas analysis\nindicates that ten million Americans with the best health have\nachieved one of the highest levels of life expectancy on\nrecord, 3 y better than Japan for females and 4 y better than\nIceland for males. At the same time, tens of millions of\nAmericans are experiencing levels of health that are more\ntypical of middle-income or low-income developing coun-\ntries. These poor levels of health occur in areas throughout\nthe country. The health disparities among the eight Americas\ncannot be explained by single causes of death such as\nhomicide or HIV. Nor are the largest sources of disparity in\nchildren and the elderly. The mortality disparities are most\nconcentrated in young and middle-aged males and females,\nand are a result of a number of chronic diseases and injuries\nwith well-established risk factors.\nTrends in life expectancy show that neither the relative\nordering nor the absolute levels of life expectancy disparities\nbetween America 8 and the remaining groups widened\nsignificantly for males, mostly because of HIV and homicide\nrates. In this overall picture of stable disparities, there have\nbeen specific groups whose mortality has worsened. For\nexample, the life expectancy of low-income white females in\nAppalachia and the Mississippi Valley declined between 1982\nThe most important limitation of the data used for our\nanalysis is that reported race in the census, used for\npopulation estimates, may be different from race in mortality\nstatistics, where race may be reported by the family, the\ncertifying physician, or the funeral director [1,31]. Sensitivity\nto differential race reporting would be largest for those\ngroups with small population and a relatively large propor-\ntion of mixed-race individuals, mainly the Native Americans\nand Asians [1,31]. In these groups, it is more likely for race to\nbe reported as Native American or Asian in the census than it\nis in the death certificate; hence, the differential under-\nestimation of deaths and population results in bias in the\nform of a net underestimation of mortality [1,31]. The\nmortality and population for Asians were corrected for\ndifferential underestimation, using the National Mortality\nFollowback Survey [1,31] (Correction using the National\nLongitudinal Mortality Study would have given virtually\nidentical estimates: 12% underreporting of mortality in the\nNational Mortality Followback Survey versus 13% in the\nNational Longitudinal Mortality Study [31]). For Native\nAmericans, misreporting race on death certificates is most\nimportant where mixed races exist and Native Americans\nform a small proportion of the population (e.g., in Califor-\nnia). The grouping used in the eight Americas distinguished\nbetween those Native Americans who primarily live on or\nnear reservations (America 5) and the remaining Native\nAmericans (included in America 3), and is therefore robust to\nthis error because living on or near reservations increases the\nlikelihood of correct race recording on death certificates. Any\nresidual bias would be in the form of net underestimation of\nmortality as described above and as observed nationally for\nNative Americans [31]. Mortality underestimation would in\nturn imply that life expectancy is even lower in America 5, and\nhence further magnify the findings of the above analysis on\nmortality disadvantage in America 5.\nA secondary source of bias for Asians may be back-\nmigration of first-generation immigrants, who return to their\nhome countries due to illness. This would lead to an\nunderreporting of deaths for Asians, and overestimation of\nlife expectancy in America 1. To examine the effect of this\nsource of bias, we repeated the analysis restricting the sample\nto US-born Asians. Excluding the two states (Alaska and\nHawaii) whose Asian population is entirely in America 3 (and\nnot in America 1), US-born Asian females and males had life\nexpectancies at birth that were, respectively, 5.1 and 1.6 y\nhigher than those for combined US-born and foreign-born\nAsians together, consistent with previous findings on immi-\ngrant populations [4]. Lower mortality in US-born Asians\nconfirms that the patterns in Figures 3\u00ad5 are not a result of\nunrecorded mortality due to return migration among Asian\nFigure 6. Health Plan Coverage and Health Service Utilization in the Eight Americas\nMortality Disparities in the US\npopulations; rather, they represent a real mortality advantage\nin America 1.\nThe findings on persistent health disparities in the eight\nAmericas raise the question of why, as a society, we have\nfailed to narrow health gaps between distinct and large\nsubgroups of the US population. Opportunities and inter-\nventions to reduce health inequalities include (1) reducing\nsocioeconomic inequalities, which are the distal causes of\nhealth inequalities, (2) increasing financial access to health\ncare by decreasing the number of Americans without health\nplan coverage, (3) removing physical, behavioral, and cultural\nbarriers to health care, (4) reducing disparities in the quality\nof care, (5) designing public health strategies and interven-\ntions to reduce health risks at the level of communities (e.g.,\nchanges in urban/neighborhood design to facilitate physical\nactivity and reduce obesity), and (6) designing public health\nstrategies to reduce health risks that target individuals or\npopulation subgroups that are not necessarily in the same\ncommunity (e.g., tobacco taxation or pharmacological inter-\nventions for blood pressure and cholesterol).\nImportant research in the past few decades has illustrated\nthe critical role of individual and community-level socio-\neconomic factors, be it in absolute or relative terms, in health\nis currently the case in the US) systematic policies for\nreducing socioeconomic inequalities, public health and\nhealth care provide instruments for addressing inequalities\nin health outcomes. Much of the health policy agenda in the\nUS is currently focused on health insurance coverage for the\nnearly 44 million Americans (15% of the population) who\nlack health insurance [39,40]. Although increasing insurance\ncoverage and access to care would most likely contribute to\nnarrowing disparities across the eight Americas, the available\ndata (Figure 6) suggest that the variation in health plan\ncoverage across the eight Americas is small relative to the\nvery large gradient in health outcomes. It is likely that\nexpanding insurance coverage alone would still leave huge\ndisparities in young and middle-aged adults. A shortcoming\nof the BRFSS data on health insurance and health-care\nutilization, however, is that they do not provide any insight\ninto the likely contribution of variation in quality of care to\nthe disparities across the eight Americas.\nThe diseases with the largest contribution to mortality\ndisparities across the eight Americas are chronic diseases and\ninjuries with well-established risk factors, including alcohol\nuse, tobacco smoking, overweight and obesity, and elevated\nblood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose. These risk factors\nare also the leading cause of burden of disease in the nation\nas a whole (Figure 7). An important question, therefore, is the\ndistributions of exposure to these risks in the eight Americas,\nand the fraction of disease-specific and all-cause mortality\nattributable to their hazardous effects. This is particularly\nrelevant for combinations of risk factors that together\naccount for large proportions of many chronic diseases\n[41,42]. Definite estimates of the contributions of risk factors\nto health inequalities require analyses for race-county\ncombinations, which are not readily possible using currently\navailable data: among data sources on risk factors, the BRFSS\nallows subnational analysis but relies on self-reported\nexposure. Although self-reported exposure is the common\nmetric for risks such as tobacco smoking and alcohol use, it is\nsubject to bias for overweight and obesity and for elevated\nblood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose because of individual\nreporting behavior and because individuals may not be aware\nof their blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose status. The\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provides\nmeasurements of this latter group of risks, but does not\ninclude sufficient geographical detail for analysis at the\ncounty or even state level [25]. Methods for combining the\ntwo data sources to obtain estimates for population sub-\ngroups based on race and place of residence are required [43].\nIf analysis of risk factors illustrates that a substantial\nproportion of disparities among the eight Americas are\nattributable to risk factor exposure, risk factor interventions\nshould be investigated as tools for reducing health inequal-\nities, in the same way that they have been used for achieving\naggregate national health benefits. The interventions will\nlikely include both population-wide measures (e.g., tobacco\ntaxation, drinking-and-driving countermeasures, and inter-\nventions to reduce public and domestic alcohol-induced\nviolence) and personal interventions (e.g., pharmacological\ninterventions for blood pressure and cholesterol).\nThe traditional emphasis of the US health system has been\non children and the elderly, as, for example, illustrated by the\nlow levels of resources devoted to injury prevention and\ntobacco control compared with immunization [44]. This\nemphasis may have partly contributed to substantially lower\ndisparities in these age groups relative to young and middle-\naged adults. On the other hand, the emphasis on children and\nthe elderly has treated many of the diseases that are\nimportant contributors to young and middle-aged adult\nhealth disparities, and their risk factors, as either the\nresponsibilities of individuals (alcohol, tobacco, obesity, and\ndietary determinants of blood pressure and cholesterol, like\nsalt) or in the domain of clinical care (blood pressure and\ncholesterol). A number of important steps are needed to\nbroaden the current perspective. First, there is a need to use\nsystematic epidemiological and economic analyses to identify\neffective and cost-effective health interventions--whether\ntargeting populations or individuals--that would make the\nFigure 7. Burden of Disease Attributable to the Ten Leading Risk Factors\nin the very-low-mortality countries of the Region of Americas\nThe estimates refer to the Global Burden of Disease epidemiological\nregion that includes Canada, Cuba, and the US [45]; more than 85% of this\nregion's population live in the US and most data sources apply to the US.\nMortality Disparities in the US\nbiggest difference to those with the worst health. Given the\ndistinct epidemiological, geographical, and sociodemo-\ngraphic profiles of the eight Americas, the leading inter-\nventions may be different for each, although some common\ncore strategies may exist (e.g., common core cardiovascular\ndisease prevention strategies). Second, monitoring systems\nshould be developed by the states and territories to provide\nlocal but benchmarked information on the fraction of the\npopulation in each community who would benefit from these\ninterventions and are receiving them. Third, information on\nthe delivery of these interventions for different communities\nshould be publicly reported. It is when the public, community\nand professional groups, media, and politicians focus\nattention on what is being achieved, and why efforts are\nworking in some places and not others, that the culture of\naccountability for health outcomes will be strengthened.\nSupporting Information\nDataset S1.
