    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackgroud: Bone mineral density (BMD) is a marker of long-term estrogen exposure. BMD\nmeasurement has been used in this context to investigate the association of estrogen with breast\ncancer risk in three cohorts. In order to assess further BMD as a predictor of estrogen related\ncancer risk, the association of BMD with colorectal and corpus uteri cancer was investigated in the\nNHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS) cohort along with breast cancer and prostate\ncancer.\nMethods: Participants were members of the NHEFS cohort who had BMD measurement in 1974\u00ad\n1975. Age, race, and BMI adjusted rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for\nincidence of cancers of the corpus uterus, breast, colorectum, prostate, and of osteoporosis and\nhip fracture related to baseline BMD.\nResults: Data were available for 6046 individuals. One hundred cases of breast cancer, 94 prostate\nosteoporosis were reported between 1974 and 1993. Hip fracture and osteoporosis were both\nsignificantly inversely associated with BMD. Uterine cancer was positively associated (p = 0.005,\ntest for linear trend) and colorectal cancer negatively associated (p = 0.03) with BMD. No\nassociation was found between elevated BMD and incidence of breast cancer (p = 0.74) or prostate\ncancer (p = 0.37) in the overall cohort, although a weak association was seen between BMD and\nsubsequent breast cancer incidence when BMD was measured in post-menopausal women (p =\nConclusion: The findings related to cancers of the uterus and colorectum as well as the weak\nassociation of BMD with breast cancer strengthen the use of BMD as a marker of estrogen\nexposure and cancer risk.\n\u00a9 2002 Nelson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

All of these reports\nwere regarded as significant because estrogen has been\nthought to increase breast cancer risk [4] and BMD may be\na more accurate measure of long term estrogen exposure\nthan recall of hormone supplementation, measurements\nof endogenous estrogen, parity, or obesity [5,6].\nIn the light of strong associations previously noted be-\ntween estrogens and corpus uteri cancer, BMD should pre-\ndict the occurrence of endometrial cancer [4], though this\nhas not yet been directly assessed. BMD also reflects expo-\nsure to calcium and to physical activity as well as foods af-\nfecting calcium absorption and deposition [7\u00ad9]. All of\nthese factors, including estrogen, are thought to diminish\nthe risk of colorectal cancer [10,11]. On the other hand in-\ncreased calcium intake has been associated with increased\nrisk of prostate cancer [12,13]. Because of the intimate as-\nsociation of BMD with to all of these exposure variables,\nBMD needs to be examined in relation to each of these\ncancers. In this report we use the NHANES I Epidemiolog-\nical Followup Study to pursue four hypotheses relating\nBMD to cancer: that BMD will correlate directly with sub-\nsequent breast, uterus, and prostate cancer incidence, and\nthat BMD will correlate inversely with subsequent color-\nectal cancer incidence.\nMethods\nThe First National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey (NHANES I) collected data from a national probabil-\nity sample of the United States civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population between the ages of one\nand seventy-four years [14]. The initial survey took place\nnutrition in NHANES I, a subset sample of persons age\n25\u00ad74 received a more detailed health examination\nthrough October 1975. This additional exam included a\nhand/wrist x-ray. This was successfully completed in 6,\n413 subjects. Each x-ray was a posterior/anterior view of\nthe left hand and wrist taken by direct exposure using 10\n\u00b4 12 Eastman Industrial Type AA \"Ready Pak\" film. The\nprescribed radiography technique called for a focus to\nfilm distance of 36 inches with the focal spot centered on\nthe midpoint of the third metacarpal. These hand/wrist x-\nrays were originally evaluated for BMD by photo densit-\nometry measurements of the phalanx V-2 and the radius.\nBMD was determined from the radiography using a refer-\nence wedge. The hand/wrist x-rays have since been reread\nfor bone density using a technique called Osteo Gram Ra-\ndiographic Absorptiometry (RA) by Compu-Med Incor-\nporated. BMD could not be calculated using this method\nproper exposure, poor picture quality, damaged or miss-\ning film. Records for the 6, 260 cases that have been reread\nare contained in the Public Use File (Radiography Absorp-\ntiometry Bone Density). Additional data on RA can be\nfound in an introduction to that public use file. RA has\nbeen found to have an excellent precision (CV of 0.6%)\nand accuracy and to correlate well with other accepted\nmethods of bone densitometry.\nData on disease incidence were obtained on the individu-\nals from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Studies\n(NHEFS), which was conducted in four waves of data col-\nlection through 1993. Data collected included in depth\ninterviews with subjects or their proxies, hospital records,\nincluding pathology reports, and collection of death cer-\ntificates for deceased subjects. Tracing is complete for 90%\nThose with at least one follow-up record in NHEFS were\nincluded in the analysis, resulting in a final sample size of\ncodes (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revi-\nsion) from death certificates and hospital record diagnos-\ntic codes in NHEFS mortality and health care facility stay\ndata bases, respectively. They were: uterine cancer (179,\nPerson-years of follow-up were computed for each cohort\nas the amount of time since the NHANES I examination\nto the date of the first of the following events: date of ICD-\n9 disease code of interest from the health care facility stay\nfiles, date of death from the NHEFS mortality file, or the\nlast day of contact from the 1992 NHEFS vital status file.\nThus, subjects were right-censored at either death or last\ndate of follow-up. For persons with more than one hospi-\ntal admission listing a particular disease outcome of inter-\nest, the date of the earliest admission for that disease was\nused. Person-years of follow-up were calculated separately\nfor each disease outcome. Cohorts who reported at base-\nline a history of hip fracture were excluded from the hip\nfracture analysis (30 women and 27 men) for a total sam-\nple size of 5989, and those who reported a prior malig-\nnant tumor or growth were excluded from the cancer\nanalyses (120 women and 49 men) for total sample sizes\nfor the breast and uterine cancer analyses, and 2769 men\nfor the prostate cancer analysis.\nCohorts were divided into 4 groups according to their RA\nestablished by Compu-Med). Chi square tests for trend\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nand linear regression analysis using a single variable for\nRA-BMD group were used to evaluate the relationship of\nBMD to BMI, gender, age and ethnicity, as appropriate.\nFor each diagnosis of interest, incidence rates were calcu-\nlated for each BMD group by dividing the number of cases\nof disease by the number of person-years of follow-up.\nCox proportional-hazards models were fitted for disease\noutcomes with BMD groups using the PHREG procedure\nfrom the SAS System for Windows Version 8.01. Covari-\nates in the analysis were age at NHANES I examination\n(BMI; weight in kg/height in m2) at NHANES I examina-\nsus other). Analyses of colorectal cancer, hip fractures and\nosteoporosis outcomes were adjusted for gender. Similar\nmodels, replacing the 3 indicator variables for RA BMD\nwith a single variable for RA BMD group, were tested to\ndetermine the significance of the trend in risk of disease.\nFor the analysis including only women older than 55\nyears, the cohort was divided into 4 groups according to\nBMD quartile. The association of BMD quartile with\nbreast cancer in women older than 55 was tested using\nCox proportional hazards models as described above. Co-\nvariates included in the model were indicator variables for\nquartile of age, quartile of BMI, and race (Caucasian ver-\nsus other). Since we would expect that age would be expo-\nnentially related to cancer, and for breast and uterine\ncancer the slope of the exponential line would change af-\nter menopause, the use of age categories did not constrain\nage to be linearly related to the outcome.\nResults\nThe BMD sample of NHANES I included 6, 046 individu-\nals who had bone density read by RA and follow-up data\nrican Americans, and 52 individuals of Hispanic origin.\nage at the time of bone density reading was slightly less\nthan 50 years.

After age, race and BMI adjustment there was a\nsignificant (p = 0.005) trend to increasing risk with in-\ncreasing BMD.\nA trend was not seen between BMD and the subsequent\nincidence of breast cancer in the overall cohort (Table 4: p\n= 0.74). However, in women who were over the age of 55\nTable 2: Bone mineral density and subsequent incidence of osteoporosis and hip fracture in men and women\nNumber in Cohort Number of Cases Incidence Rate\nyears)\nAge, Gender, Race &\nBMI Adjusted Rate\np-value for rate ratio\nHip Fractures\nOsteoporosis\nBMI; Body Mass Index.

A total of 43 breast can-\ncers developed in this latter, older group.\nThere was an inverse association of BMD with colorectal\ncancer after adjustment for age, race, BMI, and gender that\nwas statistically significance (p = 0.03: Table 5).\nProstate cancer risk was not significantly associated with\nincreasing levels of BMD (p = 0.37), although there were\ndiminished risks in upper quartiles of BMD, which was in\nthe opposite direction of our hypothesis (Table 6).\nDiscussion\nHip fracture and osteoporosis\nAs in the Framingham cohort, the choice of bone for BMD\nmeasurement in NHANES I was the metacarpal [2].

Because we assumed that\nthe most direct consequences of diminished BMD would\nbe osteoporosis and hip fracture, associations of BMD\nwith hip fracture and the development of osteoporosis\nwere investigated in order to establish the validity of this\nBMD measurement in this cohort. As anticipated, in the\nNHEFS, diminished BMD is significantly associated with\nthe development of osteoporosis and hip fracture (Table\nUterine cancer\nThis is the first report that examines the relationship of\nBMD to uterine cancer. Because the association of estro-\ngen exposure and uterine cancer development is far less\ncontroversial than estrogen and breast cancer risk [4], the\nveracity of BMD as a measure of estrogen exposure is sup-\nported by the significant positive association of BMD with\nuterine cancer incidence (Table 3).\nBreast cancer\nAlthough no association between BMD and subsequent\nbreast cancer incidence was found for all women in the\ncohort, a weak but significant association was seen in\nthose over 55 years of age at the time of BMD measure-\nment, i.e. post menopause. The total number of breast\ncancer cases is comparable to the three studies discussed\nbelow, as is the size of the cohort. However, the three pre-\nvious studies all recruited peri- and post-menopausal\nwomen [1\u00ad3], an age group that comprised just less than\nhalf the women in the NHANES I BMD cohort. The\nNHANES I female BMD cohort size and number of breast\ncancer cases in this post-menopausal subgroup are there-\nfore smaller than the other studies. Nevertheless, there is\na significant, though unstable trend towards increasing\nbreast cancer risk with rising BMD in those women re-\ncruited to NHANES I older than 55 years (Table 4).\nThe relationship of estrogen exposure to subsequent\nbreast cancer risk has been the subject of much debate and\ninvestigation [4]. The debate is all the more significant be-\ncause of estrogen's possible role in the prevention of cor-\nonary heart disease mortality, hip fracture and\nosteoporosis [5]. Three studies were greeted with great en-\nthusiasm because they added a new perspective to the de-\nbate, correlating BMD with breast cancer risk. In so doing\nthey seemed to confirm that estrogen exposure over a long\nperiod of time increased the risk of breast cancer [1\u00ad3],\n(Table 7). In the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, 6, 854\nwomen greater than 65 years old had their BMD measured\nand were followed-up for an average of 3.2 years. Ninety-\nseven women developed breast cancer [1]. The incidence\nyears in the lowest quartile of bone mineral density to\njusted rate ratios for breast cancer from the lowest to the\ntively. However, the effect was found to be far greater in\nwomen with a positive family history of breast cancer in\nthe Framingham report. Among those without a family\nhistory of breast cancer, the risk was not significantly in-\nIn the Fracture Intervention Trial, 8203 postmenopausal\nwomen between 54 and 80 years of age were enrolled in a\ntherapeutic trial related to fracture prevention [3]. With a\nmaximum of five years of follow-up, a total of 158 women\nwere found to have breast cancer, 131 of which received\nthe diagnosis more than six months after enrollment, and\n102 of which were invasive cancers. Treatment (alendro-\nTable 6: Bone mineral density and subsequent incidence of prostate cancer\nNumber in\nCohort\nNumber of Cases Incidence Rate\nyears)\nAge, Race & BMI\nAdjusted Rate\np-value for rate\nratio\nProstate; Men\nTest for Linear Trend P = 0.37\nBMI; Body Mass Index. RA BMD; Bone Mineral Density by Radioabsorbimetry\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nnate for osteoporosis) in the randomized trial did not al-\nter breast cancer risk. Age adjusted risk increased with\nincreasing quartiles of BMD, though marginal statistical\nsignificance was achieved for invasive cancer only in the\nhighest versus lowest BMD quartiles (OR = 1.8; 95% CI =\n1.0\u00ad3.2). Unlike Framingham, family history of breast\ncancer did not alter the results related to BMD. Calcium\nand vitamin D ingestion were found to be associated with\ndiminished breast cancer risk. This might imply that the\nestrogen effect on breast cancer risk, as manifested in\nBMD, could have been diminished by increasing exposure\nto calcium and vitamin D.\nAn indirect method has been employed to assess the rela-\ntionship of estrogen exposure to breast cancer risk\nthrough bone density assessment: the association of oste-\noporotic fracture to the prior or subsequent diagnosis of\nbreast and uterine cancer (Table 7). One recent large case/\ncontrol study presents compelling evidence for dimin-\nished risk of previous recent fracture in women with both\nbreast and uterine cancer [19]. Four earlier reports of frac-\nture and breast cancer were evenly divided in their results,\nthough the negative studies included fracture after the di-\nand found to be positively associated with fracture in two.\nColorectal cancer\nThe results of these analyses show a protective trend of\nBMD for colorectal cancer that is statistically significant\n(Table 5). Estrogen is thought to diminish risk for color-\nectal cancer, though there has been variation in findings\nconcerning which subsite within the colorectum is pro-\ntected by estrogen exposure. Other factors related to BMD\nare also thought to effect colorectal cancer risk, positively\n(age, body mass index, smoking) or negatively (calcium,\nestrogen, physical activity) [9,10]. Of these, the most\nwidely investigated has been calcium. Twenty-four analyt-\nic studies of calcium in cohort and case/control designs\nhave been reported. Only ten of these have shown a sig-\nnificant decrease in colon cancer risk associated with cal-\ncium intake. In addition, there have been 8 studies of\nvitamin D intake, only 3 of which have shown decreased\ncolorectal cancer risk related to increased vitamin D [25].\nThe reason for these inconsistent results relating to calci-\num may be that calcium nutriture is difficult to measure.\nBioavailability of calcium is related to the intake of other\nnutrients, which include dietary fiber (phytate), phos-\nphate, alcohol, and tea (tannins). Each can alter colorectal\ncancer risk. Therefore, serum calcium levels and dietary in-\ntake do not necessarily reflect endogenous content. As\nwith iron, endogenous calcium stores may be the more\nTable 7: Bone mineral density and breast cancer risk\nCohort; Size BMD Measure Cases Significant Association\nBreast\nUterus Also\nAssessed?\nSignificant Association\nUterus\nHip, Calcaneus\nonly\nYes; 29 cases Yes; Positive\nto cancer diagnosis\nSweden 9673 Breast Cancers Hip Fracture after\nbreast cancer diag-\nnosis\nSweden 677 Forearm Fractures Forearm fracture 11 cases Breast\nCancer\nYes; Inverse@ Yes; 5 cases Yes; Inverse@\nRochester, MN Case/Control 235\nBreast Cancers\nOsteoporotic\nFracture before &\nafter cancer diag-\nnosis\nNo No\nUS Multistate Tumor Registry;\nPast Fracture\nbefore cancer diag-\nnosis\nor = 5 years prior\nto Breast Cancer\nDiagnosis\nYes; Inverse@ Yes; 35 Frac-\ntures\nYes; Inverse@\nSOF; Study of Osteoporotic Fractures FIT; Fracture Intervention Trial DEXA; Dual Energy X-ray Absorbimetry RA; Radioabsorbimitry RG; Radio-\ngramimetry *; The strongest association was in those women with positive family histories for breast cancer. @; A significant inverse association in\nthe fracture trials is equivalent to a positive association in BMD trials.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nsignificant effector of risk than dietary calcium intake\n[26]. In the case of calcium, the measure of endogenous\nstores is BMD.\nThe investigation of BMD and colorectal cancer risk,\ntherefore, provides a new perspective in the analysis of cal-\ncium and colorectal cancer risk, and in addition provides\ninformation on two other factors for colorectal cancer that\nare thought to diminish risk: physical activity and estro-\ngen [10]. This is the first such report analyzing this associ-\nation.\nProstatic cancer\nReported herein is the first study to obtain BMD measure-\nment prior to the diagnosis of prostate cancer, and no as-\nsociation was found (Table 6). Calcium ingestion has also\nbeen associated with increased risk of prostate cancer\n[10,11]. The only study to look at BMD and prostate can-\ncer risk was a case/control design. It showed no associa-\ntion, although cases already had prostate cancer when\nBMD was measured and controls were patients with other\nurologic diseases or presenting for prostate cancer screen-\nBMD and estrogen\nBMD is affected by many factors other than estrogen, in-\ncluding principally age, calcium, body mass index, ciga-\nrette smoking, physical activity, and prior bone injury. As\nsuch it is a non-specific indicator of risk. BMD was also\nmeasured in NHANES I at a time when post-menopausal\nuse of estrogen was rare. Its increasing use in recent dec-\nades may have altered the subsequent risk of cancer in\nthese women. Nevertheless, the results seen in opposite\ndirections in uterus and colorectum suggest that estrogen\nexposure at least up to the point at which BMD was meas-\nured was a significant mediator of risk for cancer in\nNHANES I. The weakly positive results for breast cancer in\ncombination with previously published reports suggest\nthat, unlike the other endpoints reported herein, BMD as\na predictor of breast cancer risk is only of use when meas-\nured after menopause.\nConclusions\nIn summary, this NHANES I cohort follow-up is the first\nreport of analyses of BMD and subsequent risk for cancer\nof the colorectum and uterus, the fourth for breast cancer\nrisk and the second for prostate cancer. A strong positive\nassociation was seen between BMD and corpus uteri can-\ncer, and a significant trend towards decreasing colorectal\ncancer risk with increasing BMD. There is an insignificant\ndecline in risk for prostate cancer with increasing BMD, a\ndirection opposite of our initial hypothesis. A weak rela-\ntionship could be detected between breast cancer and\nBMD only when BMD was measured after menopause.\nSignificant inverse associations were found between\nBMD, osteoporosis and hip fracture.\nCompeting interests\nNone declared\nAuthor's Contributions\nR.
