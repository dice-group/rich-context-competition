In\noverweight [3]. Of these, 500 million adult men and women were\nobese. Statistics suggest significant variations in the prevalence of\nobesity across the globe. The prevalence of obesity ranges from\nbelow 5% in China, Japan and African countries to over 75% in\nObesity is known to affect the overall health of a population.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), overweight\nand obesity are the fifth leading risk for global deaths [3]. Obesity\nis also found to be associated with a number of non-communicable\ndiseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, muscu-\nloskeletal disorders and some forms of cancers [3]. Statistics\nindicate that 44% of the diabetes burden, 23% of the heart disease\nburden and between 7% and 41% of certain cancer burdens can\nbe attributed to overweight and obesity [3].\nBRICS is an international association of emerging national\neconomies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The\nmember countries represent a mix of economies with developing\ncountries like Brazil, India, China and South Africa and a\ndeveloped country like Russia. The share of China, India, Russia\nand South Africa together in the total world population is\napproximately 40%. In terms of population aged 18 years or older,\nthese comprise 41% of the world's population [6]. These countries\nare at different stages of demographic and epidemiological\ntransition. Like in many developed countries, obesity is emerging\nas an important public health problem in BRICS. Economic\nburden of obesity related NCDs in BRICS is considerable.\nAccording to the WHO Report (2005), annual losses in national\nincome from heart disease, stroke and diabetes are estimated at\n$18 billion in China, $11 billion in Russia, $9 billion in India and\n$3 billion in Brazil [7]. Furthermore, China is expected to lose\n$558 billion over the next 10 years in foregone national income\ndue to heart disease, stroke, and diabetes alone. India and Russia\nare expected to cross $200 billion & $300 billion respectively in the\nsame period [7]. In addition, NCDs and injuries account for an\nestimated 62% of the total age standardized burden of forgone\nDisability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in India [8].\nSeveral environmental as well as socio-economic and demo-\ngraphic factors are associated with increased risk of overweight\nand obesity. Age, gender, socio-economic condition, and urban-\nrural residence are associated with overweight and obesity [9\u00ad11].\nOverweight/obesity are found to be associated with increasing age\nand female gender [9\u00ad11]. The other factors that are associated\nTable 1.

The evidence on\nassociation between such factors and obesity in BRICS countries\nprimarily comes from small-scale studies. Moreover, the spread of\nthese risk factors in BRICS countries is relatively less known. In\naddition, we do not know if all of these factors increase the risk of\noverweight and obesity in different settings.\nObesity is known to contribute to a variety of health conditions.\nStudies have shown a significant association between obesity and\nmajor health risks such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high\ncholesterol levels, asthma and arthritis [16,17]. To our knowledge,\nthere is only one study that has examined the linkage between\nobesity and hypertension in four of the five BRICS countries [18].\nWe came across two studies from India [19,20], four studies from\nChina [21\u00ad24], one study from South Africa [25], and two studies\nfrom Russia [26,27] that have examined the association between\nobesity and hypertension/heart disease and have found a\nsignificant positive association between them. With reference to\nstudies on obesity and diabetes, we came across three studies only\nstroke was examined in a study conducted in China [21], which\nreported that the obese were more likely to suffer from stroke than\nnormal respondents. Likewise, the association between obesity and\narthritis was examined only in a study conducted in rural Russia\n[26]. It is important to note that, except for Basu & Millett (2013)\nlisted above were either based on small-scale datasets (and hence\nare not representative at the national level) or referred to specific\npopulation subgroups. Also, we did not come across any large\nscale study that examined the association between obesity and\ndepression in these countries.\nIn view of the issues discussed earlier, the aim of our study is to\nexamine the extent of overweight and obesity in four of the five\nBRICS countries, namely India, China, South Africa, and Russia.\nAnother aim of the study is to identify the most important factors\nassociated with the increased risk of overweight and obesity in\neach of these countries. In addition, we examine the association\nbetween obesity and selected morbidities \u00ad hypertension, diabetes,\nangina, stroke, arthritis, and depression. Our study is likely to\nprovide more robust and comparable evidence on the association\nbetween obesity and selected morbidities in these countries.\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nThe study is based on a secondary data set with no identifiable\ninformation on the survey participants. This dataset is available in\nthe public domain for research use and hence no formal approval\nfrom the institutional review board is required. So, no ethics\nstatement is required for this work. The data can be freely accessed\nfrom the WHO website http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/systems/\nsurveydata/index.php/catalog.\nData\nThe present study uses data from the Study on Global Ageing\nand Adult Health (SAGE) surveys implemented by WHO in six\ncountries \u00adChina, India, Ghana, Mexico, Russia and South Africa\nadults, 18 years and older. A multistage stratified clustered sample\ndesign was used uniformly in all the countries included in the\nSAGE. SAGE collected information about self\u00adreported morbid-\nities and health conditions based on interview and health\nFigure 1.

Brazil could\nnot be included in our analysis because the SAGE survey was not\nin Russia [28]. Adults for whom weight and height measurements\nwere not available were excluded from the analysis. Hence, the\nVariables\nIn this study, body mass index (BMI) is taken as an indicator of\nobesity, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of\nheight in meters. Measured weight and height are used to calculate\nBMI. Respondents are classified as Underweight (BMI ,18.5),\nThe inclusion of morbidities in our analysis is based on two\ncriteria \u00ad first, the morbidities must be influenced by obesity; and\nsecond, information on the morbidities was collected by the SAGE\nsurvey. Accordingly, we included hypertension, diabetes, angina,\nstroke, arthritis, and depression in our analysis. The SAGE survey\ncollected three readings each of systolic and diastolic measures of\nblood pressure. Any respondent whose systolic measure was 140 or\nmore or whose diastolic measure was 90 or more was coded as\n`suffering from hypertension'. In addition, any respondent who\nreported as ever been diagnosed with hypertension was also coded\nas `suffering from hypertension'. The rest were coded as `not\nsuffering from hypertension'. These cut-offs for hypertension have\nbeen recommended and used in a number of studies\nFor the remaining five morbidities, we used self-reports to code\nrespondents as those having or not having morbidities. The\nfollowing questions were used to address the remaining five\nmorbidities:\n1. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes (high blood\nsugar)? (Yes, No)\n2. Have you ever been diagnosed with angina or angina pectoris\n(a heart disease)? (Yes, No)\n3. Have you ever been told by a health professional that you have\nhad a stroke? (Yes, No)\n4. Have you ever been diagnosed with/told you have arthritis (or\nby other names rheumatism or osteoarthritis)? (Yes, No)\n5. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression? (Yes, No)\nAll the morbidities were coded into dummy variables. For\nexample, those reporting `yes' to diabetes were coded as `1' and\nothers were coded as `0'.\nSince BMI and selected morbidities are known to be affected by\nother risk factors, several individual and lifestyle factors have been\nincluded in the analysis. The variables included in the analysis are:\nage, gender, schooling, wealth quintiles, place of residence, current\nsmoking status, current alcohol use, and engaged in work that\ninvolves physical activity. The wealth quintiles, which are already\ncomputed in the SAGE, were generated through a principal\ncomponents analysis conducted on a set of variables based on the\nWe identified respondents engaged in work that involved\nphysical activity using the following two questions:\n1.

(Yes, No)\nRespondents who reported `yes' to any of the two questions\nwere coded as `1' and the rest were coded as `0'.\nTwo community level variables - percentage of educated\nrespondents in each community and average monthly household\nexpenditure per community - were also included in the analysis.\nStatistical Analysis\nBivariate and multivariate analyses have been used to fulfill the\nobjectives of the paper. Since BMI had four categories (under-\nweight, normal, overweight and obese), we used multinomial\nlogistic regression analysis to examine the factors associated with\noverweight and obesity. As the selected morbidities were coded as\ndummy variables, two level random intercept logit models with\nrespondents (level 1) nested within communities (level 2) were\nfitted to examine the association of obesity with selected\nmorbidities. Appropriate sampling weights were used to control\nfor the complex survey design of the SAGE. Sampling weights are\ngiven in the SAGE dataset (See the SAGE reports for details of\nsampling weight). The analysis presented in the paper was\nResults\nThe percentage distribution of sample by selected characteristics\nis shown in Table 1. Among the four countries analyzed, smoking\nwas highest in India (42%) and lowest in Russia (27%). In\ncomparison, drinking alcohol was highest in Russia (41%) and\nlowest in India (7%). More than three-fourths of the respondents\nin India and Russia reported that they were engaged in work that\ninvolved physical activity. Engagement in work that involved\nphysical activity was reported least in South Africa (52%). Only\n24% of the respondents from India and South Africa were 50\nyears or older. This compares with 36% in China and 40% in\nRussia. Higher education was more common in the Russian\nsample; about 86% of the respondents reported that they had high\nschool education or more. This percentage was 24% in India, 27%\nin China and 28% in South Africa. Rural-urban residence varied\nconsiderably across the countries. The percent urban ranged\nbetween as low as 31% in the Indian sample to as high as 73% in\nthe Russian sample.\nThe prevalence of overweight and obesity in the four countries\nis shown in Figure 1. The percentage of respondents who were\noverweight ranged between as low as 9% in India and as high as\n36% in Russia. Similarly, the percentage of respondents who were\nobese ranged between 3% in India and 35% in South Africa.\nNearly 5% and 22% of the respondents in China and Russia\nrespectively, were obese.\nIn multinomial logistic regression, age was associated with\noverweight and obesity in India, China and Russia (Table 2). 50\nTable 3.

Likewise, 50 years or older respondents were 1.5\u00ad3.7\ntimes as likely as respondents below 50 years of age to be obese\nthan being normal. Gender was statistically associated with\noverweight and obesity in India and South Africa. In Russia and\nChina, gender was only associated with obesity. Females, when\ncompared to males, were more likely to be overweight or obese\nthan normal in India and South Africa. In Russia and China,\nfemales, when compared to males, were more likely to be obese\nthan normal. Wealth was statistically associated with overweight in\nIndia and China. However, wealth was not associated with obesity\nin any of the countries. Similarly, no association was found\nbetween educational level and overweight/obesity.\nSmoking was also associated with both overweight and obesity\nin China, South Africa and Russia (Table 2). Smokers were less\nlikely than non-smokers to be either overweight (odds ratio: 0.58\u00ad\nalcohol was associated with overweight and obesity in China and\nSouth Africa. While engaging in work that involved physical\nactivity was associated with both overweight and obesity in China,\nit was associated only with obesity in South Africa.

Obese respondents\nwere 1.4\u00ad2.5 times as likely as normal respondents to report\narthritis in these countries. Likewise, obese respondents were 1.9\u00ad\n3.5 times as likely as normal respondents to have hypertension.\nSimilarly, obese respondents were 2.1\u00ad3.0 times more likely to\nreport diabetes than the normal respondents. Obese were also\nmore likely to report angina than normal respondents. In India,\nobesity was only associated with hypertension and diabetes \u00ad obese\nrespondents were significantly more likely than the normal\nrespondents to have hypertension or diabetes. Obesity was not\nassociated with either stroke or depression in any of the selected\ncountries.\nLike obesity, overweight was also associated with hypertension\nand diabetes in all the four selected countries. Overweight\nrespondents were 1.5\u00ad2.1 times more likely than normal\nrespondents to report hypertension. Likewise, overweight respon-\ndents were 1.5\u00ad1.9 times more likely than normal respondents to\nreport diabetes. The association between overweight and arthritis\nwas significant in India, China and South Africa (odds ratio: 1.5,\n1.2 and 1.5 in India, China and South Africa respectively). Around\n0.2% - 42% of residual variation in the chances of suffering from\nselected morbidities in selected countries was attributable to\ndifferences in the community characteristics.\nDiscussion\nOverweight and obesity varied considerably across four of the\nfive BRICS countries included in the analysis. The percentage\noverweight ranged between as low as 9% in India to as high as\n37% in Russia. The percentage of obese ranged between as low as\n3% in India to as high as 35% in South Africa. The prevalence of\nselected morbidities also varied considerably across the four\ncountries. The prevalence of hypertension, angina, stroke and\ndiabetes were considerably higher in Russia compared to the other\nthree countries included in the analysis. To account for the\ndifferences in the age-structure of the sampled respondents in four\ncountries, we also estimated age-standardized prevalence for\nselected morbidities in each country. The age-standardized rates\nalso suggested a considerably high burden of hypertension, angina,\nstroke and diabetes in Russia compared to the other three\ncountries (results not shown).\nOverweight/obesity was found to be associated with hyperten-\nsion and diabetes in all the four countries. Our findings confirm\nthe findings of the three small-scale studies conducted on a similar\nlikely to report arthritis in China, South Africa and Russia. In\ncontrast to our findings, Kalichman et al. (2006) found no\nassociation between obesity and arthritis in rural Russia [26].\nAngina was also more likely to be reported by obese respondents\nin China, South Africa and Russia. Unlike earlier studies, stroke\nwas not associated with overweight/obesity in our study. The\nrelationship between overweight/obesity and stroke might get\naffected by the way in which information was collected about\nstroke in the SAGE. The question on stroke in the SAGE did not\ndistinguish between ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. A\nrecent meta-analysis of prospective studies found increased risk of\nischemic stroke in both overweight and obese individuals [36].\nHemorrhagic stroke however was not related to overweight/\nobesity. Depression was also not associated with overweight/\nobesity in our study.\nOne of the strengths of the SAGE survey is that it also allows for\nestimation of symptom based prevalence of selected morbidities\nsuch as angina, arthritis and depression. To examine whether the\nassociation between overweight/obesity and these morbidities is\nrobust, we also estimated binary logistic regressions using symptom\nbased prevalence as the dependent variable. The associations of\noverweight/obesity with arthritis and depression were similar to\nthose obtained in self-reported prevalence. When we used the\nsymptom based prevalence of angina, the association between\noverweight/obesity and angina became statistically significant\neven in India (results not shown). In India, the relationship\nbetween overweight/obesity and angina, in self-reported diagnosis,\nmight get affected by the biases related to health system access.\nSelf-reported diagnoses could reflect systematic over or under\nreporting of NCDs due to biases related to health system access\nThe strengths and limitations of our study must be noted. One\nof the strengths of our study is the use of a large-scale population\nbased dataset for examining the consequences of overweight/\nobesity in four of the five BRICS countries. Our study, perhaps for\nthe first time, has provided robust and comparable evidence on the\nassociation between overweight/obesity and selected morbidities\nin BRICS countries. The large sample sizes allowed us to control\nfor a number of pertinent covariates in the multivariate statistical\nmodels. The limitations of our study are that our study only\nestablishes an association between overweight/obesity and selected\nmorbidities and does not provide any evidence for causality.\nSecond, the choice of control variables was limited to only those\nvariables that were available for each of the four countries\nconsidered in the analysis.\nTo conclude, overweight/obesity was found to be an important\nrisk factor for hypertension, angina, diabetes and arthritis. It is\nthus important that public health programs focus their attention\ntowards the growing epidemic of obesity before it reaches alarming\nlevels. Interestingly, obesity is preventable [2]. Obesity prevention\npolicies should focus on facilitating key behaviors like choosing\nhealthier food, limiting unhealthy food, increasing physical\nactivity, improving sleep, reducing stress, etc. (http://www.hsph.\nharvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-prevention). To\nachieve these, action is needed at multiple levels \u00ad from\ngovernments and industries, communities and neighborhoods,\nschools and workplaces, and individual and families [38\u00ad40]. For\nexample, to curb consumption of sugary drinks, governments\ncould levy heavy taxes. A recent Indian study has shown that\nsustained high tax rates on sugar-sweetened beverages could\nmitigate rising obesity and type-2 diabetes [18]. Schools can\nincrease the recess time and promote dietary education and\nphysical activity. Although evidence on how to prevent obesity is\ngrowing, there is a dearth of obesity prevention studies in low- and\nmiddle-income countries [41]. Hence future studies must examine\nthe impact of obesity prevention strategies in low- and middle-\nincome countries.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: A. Shukla A.
