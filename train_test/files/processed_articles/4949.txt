To this end, visual system\nprocesses information in a hierarchical way; first it extracts local orientations, then it\nintegrates the local orientations into intermediate representations of contour, and finally it\nforms global shape percepts (Loffler, 2008). The intermediate representation of contour\nwould include concavity, convexity, corner angle, curvature, and so forth. Although it is\nobvious that the physical shape is determined by combination of the local orientations,\nperceptual shape is susceptible to several factors. Accordingly, as visual illusions\ndemonstrate, percepts are not necessarily veridical. For example, the cafe\n\u00b4 wall illusion\n(Pierce, 1898) demonstrates that parallel horizontal lines are perceived as different angles\nto each other.\nHere, we report a novel illusion\u00ad\u00adcurvature blindness illusion\u00ad\u00adthat will provide novel\nimplications for contour perception, in particular, for the underlying mechanisms of curve\nand corner perception. Figure 1 demonstrates this illusion. One must see the pairs of wavy\nlines (i.e., gentle curves) and pairs of zigzag lines (i.e., obtuse corners) on the gray\nbackground. Physically, however, all lines are wavy lines with an identical shape; there is\nno triangular wave and hence there is no corner. One would find that all the lines on the white\nand black background are wavy. As the effect magnitudes are quite strong, unless one\nCorresponding author:\nKohske Takahashi, School of Psychology, Chukyo University 101-2, Yagoto Honmachi, Showa-ku, Nagoya-Shi, Japan.\nEmail: takahashi.kohske@gmail.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sage-\npub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\ni-Perception\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ipe\ncarefully stares at the region that looks like a corner, it is hard to find that all lines are\nphysically wavy. Despite the simplicity and effect magnitudes, to the best of our knowledge,\nno one has reported about this phenomenon.\nPsychophysical, physiological, and computational studies have excessively investigated\nthe underlying visual process of curve and corner perception (Loffler, 2008). The basic idea\nis a hierarchal process, that is, the outputs from local and neighboring orientation filters in\nV1 are integrated at the later stages, V2, V3, or V4, and the curvature or angle information\nare extracted as intermediate representations of contours (Dumoulin & Hess, 2007; Ito &\nThe end-stopped cells would also play a role in detecting relatively high curvature\naddressed how the visual system discriminates different curvatures, detects a low curvature\nfrom a straight line, discriminates different corner angles, or detects obtuse angles from a\nstraight line; thus, the perception of curve and corner have been studied in a different\ncontext.\nAccordingly, little is known regarding how the visual system discriminates a curve from a\ncorner and how these two percepts are related to each other (Ito, 2012, may be one\nexception). As the curvature blindness illusion demonstrates that the low curvatures are\nperceptually replaced by the obtuse corners, it postulates that the underlying mechanisms\nof curve and corner perception could not be independent, but rather would interfere or\ncompete with each other. Therefore, disentangling this illusion should provide a unified\nview of curve and corner perception and also extend the current understandings of\ncontour perception.\nIn the present study, we conducted three experiments to explore the determining factors\nand mechanisms underlying curvature blindness. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of the\nposition of color change. Experiment 2 investigated the effects of background luminance.\nFigure 1. Example of the curvature blindness illusion. Physically, all lines are identical sine wave. However,\none would see obtuse corners rather than gentle curves for some sine waves on the gray background.\n2 i-Perception\nFinally, Experiment 3 investigated which of the two plays a crucial role: color change or line\ndiscontinuity.\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 1 investigated the effects of the strength of the curvature or angle of wavy and\nzigzag lines as well as how sensitive to the difference in the position of color change. These\ninvestigations would reveal the basic characteristics of the illusion in terms of the spatial\nconfiguration.\nMethods\nEight nai\u00a8ve university students participated as paid volunteers after giving written informed\nconsent. All of the participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. The study\nwas approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Tokyo and conducted in\naccordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThe experiment was conducted in a quiet and dimmed room. The visual stimuli were\nat a viewing distance of 57 cm. The stimulus presentation and response acquisition were\nThe visual stimulus was a triangle wave (zigzag line) or a sinusoidal wave (wavy line)\npresented on a grey background (18.1 cd/m2), as shown in Figure 2. The wavelength of the\ntwo curvature or angle strengths. The range on the vertical axis was 10 pixel (0.39) and 20 pixel\n(0.78) for low and high curvature, respectively; hence, the corner angle was right (90) and\nobtuse (126.9) for the high and low curvature or angle, respectively. The line was painted\nalternately with black (0.38 cd/m2) and white (98.0 cd/m2) with an alternation frequency of p.\nThe offset of alternation was manipulated from 0 to 0.5p with 0.1p intervals. The offset 0.5p\n(e.g., third from top row in Figure 2) indicates that the line color changes in the middle of two\nturning points, while the offset 0p (e.g., top row in Figure 2) indicates that the line color\nchanges at the turning point. In addition, the line painted with white was also presented\n(bottom row in Figure 2).\nThe participant began a trial by pressing a spacebar. A visual stimulus was presented for\none frame (13.3 ms) after 500 ms blank screen. The participant's task was to indicate whether\nthe line was zigzag or wavy by pressing the corresponding key (F or J). After six practical\ntrials, each condition was presented 16 times in a pseudorandom sequence, leading to 448\ntrials in total (2 shape \u00c2 2 angle \u00c2 7 offset \u00c2 16 repetition).\nResults\nFigure 3 shows the results of Experiment 1. A three-way repeated measures ANOVA (with\nHuynh\u00adFeldt correction) of shape, angle, and offset revealed the significant three-way\np\n\u00bc 0.78. Thus, as shown in Figure 3, the effects of\noffset differed among the conditions. The effect was significant for the low-curvature wavy\np\n\u00bc 0.87. A paired comparison (corrected by\nRyans method) revealed that the accuracy of 0p condition was lower than the other\nconditions as well as that of 0.1p condition was lower than the other (except for 0p)\nconditions. On the other hand, the effects of offset were not significant in the other\np\nTakahashi 3\nWe also tested that the accuracy rate was biased to the illusory perception. Consistent with\nour observation, the results demonstrated that the wavy line with low curvature was\nmisperceived as a zigzag line when the color changed at the turning point (offset \u00bc 0p).\nwhich indicates that the participants exactly ``see'' an illusory zigzag line against a physically\nwavy line, rather than have an impaired percepts of the line shape.\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 2 investigated the effects of the luminance contrast of the line color and the\neffects of background luminance.

The methods were identical with Experiment 1, except for the following.\nFigure 4 shows some examples of the visual stimuli. In Experiment 2, only the low\ncurvature or angle stimuli were presented. The offset of the color change was either 0.0,\n0.17, 0.33, 0.50p, or no color change (white line). The background was either black (pixel\n98.0 cd/m2). The luminance contrast of the line color was also manipulated. The contrast\nwas either strong (75% of the maximum contrast, pixel value was 32 and 224, and luminance\ntimes in a pseudorandom sequence, leading to 480 trials in total (2 shape \u00c2 3 background \u00c2\n2 contrast \u00c2 5 offset \u00c2 8 repetition).\nResults\nFigure 5 shows the results of Experiment 2.

The effects of offset were significant in the all gray background conditions and\nwhite background conditions with the high contrast, Fs(4, 28) > 3.88, ps < .05, Zp\nThe significant bias from the wavy to zigzag line was observed at the offset 0p in both strong\nbackground. No other condition showed significant bias. These results showed that the\ncurvature blindness illusion takes place only when the background is gray. In this\ncondition, the luminance contrast polarity of the wavy line was reversed against the\nbackground at the turning point. We also found that the contrast strength of black and\nwhite on the line has little effects. The detection of a zigzag line was difficult when the\ncolor changed around the middle of the turning point (offset \u00bc 0.33p, 0.50p).\nExperiment 3\nAssuming the shadowing by a single light source, the change in luminance at the corner gives the\nimpression of the change of surface orientation. Indeed, we can see depth for the patterns with\noffset 0p in Figures 2 and 4. Given the potential involvement of the depth perception, it would be\nreasonable that the surface is straight rather than curved since the luminance is constant along the\nsegmented regions of lines. In other words, if a surface is curved, the shadowing will make a\ngradual change of luminance. Therefore, it is possible to argue that the curvature blindness\nillusion would arise from the inference of surface orientation from the depth percepts and\nshadowing. To test this possibility, in Experiment 3, we made the pattern wherein the contrast\nCont./BG Offset Curve (wavy) Obtuse (zigzag)\nHigh /\nBlack\nHigh /\nBlack\nHigh / Gray 0\nLow / Gray 0\nHigh /\nWhite\nHigh /\nWhite\nFigure 4.

If the depth\npercepts are crucial, this pattern should not induce the curvature blindness illusion.\nMethods\nEight nai\u00a8ve university students different from those in Experiments 1 and 2 were recruited.\nThe methods were identical with Experiment 1 except for the following. Figure 1 shows some\nexamples of the visual stimuli. In Experiment 3, only the low curvature or angle stimuli were\npresented. We presented the black or white alternation conditions and the black segment\nconditions (Figure 1, second and third from bottom). The alternation condition was identical\nwith Experiment 1. In the segment condition, black segments were placed on a white line\ninstead of alternating white and black color.

No other condition showed significant bias.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe present study reported and explored a novel illusion wherein a wavy line is perceived as a\nzigzag line (Figure 1). The following were the identified prerequisites for this illusion to occur.\nFirst, the luminance contrast polarity of the wavy line needs to be reversed against the\nbackground at the turning points (Experiment 2). Second, the polarity can be reversed\nbefore and after the turning point or only at the turning point. In both cases, the illusion\nis efficiently induced (Experiment 3). Thus, the depth percepts would not be a crucial factor\nfor this illusion. Third, the curve needs to be somewhat gentle; the right angle is too steep for\nthe illusion to occur (Experiment 1).\nThis illusion has two implications. First, the percepts of a gentle curve (wavy line) are\nimpaired by discontinuity of contrast polarity at the turning point, while the percepts of an\nobtuse corner are not; this implies that the mechanisms of the gentle curve and obtuse corner\ndetection are separable in terms of contrast polarity. Second, the illusory percepts of an\nobtuse corner (zigzag line) appears and replaces the gentle curve, which indicates the\nimbalanced competition between these two percepts.\nSome models propose that the end-stop cells play a role in curvature detection (Dobbins\nFigure 6. Results of Experiment 3. Error bars indicate 95% confidential intervals. See Figure 3 for more\ndetails.\n8 i-Perception\ncurvature. Experiment 1 revealed that the high curvature is not impaired by the discontinuity\nof contrast polarity. Therefore, the curvature detection mechanism including end-stop cells\nare not susceptive to the discontinuity of contrast polarity and not relevant to the curvature\nblindness illusion.\nThe models of low-curvature detection presume combination of the outputs from\nRichards, 1989). Although these models did not consider the contrast polarity of the\norientation cells, other psychophysical studies demonstrated that the mechanisms of\ncurvature detection are selective to the luminance contrast polarity (Bell, Gheorghiu, Hess,\n& Kingdom, 2011; Gheorghiu & Kingdom, 2006). The present study also implies that the low\ncurvature detector would combine the local and neighboring orientation filters in a selective\nway depending on the contrast polarity of orientation filters. Taken together, the local\norientation filters need to have the same contrast polarity to be combined to construct the\nlow-curvature representation; otherwise, the low curvature is hardly detected.\nThe failure of the detection of the low curvature might be related to the impaired curvature\ndetection by line segmentation (Watt, 1984, 1985). In a series of psychophysical studies, Watt\nand his colleagues demonstrated that the segmentation of a curved line by line intersections\n(Watt, 1985) or gaps (Watt, 1984) elevated the curvature detection threshold. In the present\nstudy, the change of luminance contrast resulted in the percepts of segmentation, which\nwould disrupt the curvature detection. Note that, since the illusory effect was absent for\nthe segmented lines in the high-curvature condition (Experiment 1) and in the white and\nblack background condition (Experiment 2), the line segmentation might be necessary\ncondition yet would not be sufficient condition.\nThe perception of obtuse corner was not impaired by the discontinuity of contrast polarity\nat the corner. Like a detection of curvature, the detection of corner is also modeled as the\ncombination of orientation filters (Ito & Komatsu, 2004; Snippe & Koenderink, 1994).\nUnlike the low-curvature detector, however, the obtuse corner detector would combine the\nlocal orientation filters regardless of their contrast polarity.\nThus, even though low-curvature detection and obtuse corner detection would be achieved\nby combining the local and neighboring orientation filters, the visual system seems to have\nseparable integration processes, intermediate representations, and detectors for low curvature\nand obtuse corner.\nThe illusion demonstrates that one exactly ``sees'' an illusory zigzag pattern against a\nphysically wavy pattern. Even if the curvature and corner are detected in a separate\nprocess, impairment of the percepts of low curvature does not necessarily mean that the\npercepts of obtuse corner will appear. Then, how can the physically wavy lines be replaced\nby the perceptually zigzag lines? Here, we speculate the relation between the low-curvature\ndetector and the obtuse corner detector.\nThe first assumption is that the visual input of low curvature would satisfy the requirement to\ntrigger the obtuse corner detector, since there are surely two different orientations before and\nafter the turning point of the low curvature. The second assumption is that the low-curvature\ndetector combines the outputs from the local orientation filters with the same luminance\ncontrast polarity, whereas the obtuse corner detector does not care of the contrast polarity of\nlocal orientation filters. The first assumption would be supported by the physiological studies\nthat identified some cells responding both curves and angles (Hegde\nnormal condition, however, we do not perceive an obtuse corner against a low curvature. This is\nbecause a low curvature detector, which was also triggered by the input of the low curvature,\ninterferes with the output of the obtuse corner detector. Thus, the percepts of low curvature\n``win'' there. On the other hand, in the curvature blindness illusion, the visual inputs of low\nTakahashi 9\ncurvature do not activate the low curvature detector because of the inverted contrast polarity\nacross local orientation filters. However, the obtuse corner detectors still respond to the low-\ncurvature inputs because the contrast polarity does not matter (second assumption). Then, there\nis no interference from the obtuse corner detector; thus, even if the input is a wavy line, the\npercepts of zigzag corner ``win'' without fighting.\nThis account of unbalanced competition would be consistent with a previous study on\nshape adaptation (Ito, 2012). This study demonstrated that the adaptation to a circle (i.e.,\nlow curvature) induces the afterimage of a hexagon (i.e., obtuse corner). They also reported\nthat one (including me) notices that a circle deforms to a polygon during simple observation.\nThese results indicate that the low-curvature detector and obtuse corner detector compete to\neach other. Furthermore, while some people reported that the adaptation to a hexagon\ninduces the afterimage of a circle, the transformation from a circle to a hexagon seems to\nbe more effective than the transformation in the opposite direction. These results also indicate\nthat the rivalry between the low-curvature detector and obtuse corner detector are not\nbalanced but that the corner detector is dominant. Taken together, it seems to be a robust\neffect that the percepts of obtuse corner appears when the percepts of low curvature are\nimpaired by fatigue due to adaptation (Ito, 2012) or reversal of contrast polarity (curvature\nblindness illusion). Further investigation on the interaction between different detectors\u00ad\u00ad\nrivalry, imbalance, and dominance\u00ad\u00adwould be a promising way to draw a whole picture of\ncontour and shape perception.\nFinally, not directly related to the curvature blindness illusion, we note the puzzling effects\nof the obtuse corner detection. When the contrast polarity was reversed around the middle of\ntwo corners (offset \u00bc 0.33p and 0.5p), the corner detection was impaired in all experiments.\nIndeed, this pattern (see Figure 4, right column, row 4) gives an impression that the angle is\nless steep. See also the bottom-right (a white zigzag) and one above it (black segment on a\nwhite zigzag) in Figure 2. While there is no difference at the corner, the corner of the former\npattern is easy to detect while the corner of the latter is rather difficult (Experiment 3,\nFigure 6). The reason is open, but global shape perception might have influenced the local\nobtuse angle detection (Kennedy, Orbach, & Loffler, 2006, 2008). Another interesting\nobservation is that the perceived frequency of the waves is increased when the contrast\npolarity changes at the middle of two turning points (Figures 2 and 4, offset \u00bc 0.5p\nconditions). Further investigation of these unexpected effects will allow us to extend the\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of corner detection.\n"
