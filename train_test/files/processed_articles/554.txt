Despite a\nburgeoning literature documenting the collateral consequences of incarceration for family\nlife, as well as evidence that the deleterious consequences of incarceration for maternal and\nchild well-being stem from resultant relationship dissolution, much less is known about the\ndirect link between incarceration and relationship dissolution. I consider this association\nwith data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal survey\nuniquely positioned to understand the consequences of incarceration for family life. Results\nshow that paternal incarceration is associated with relatively immediate relationship dissolu-\ntion among parents, the association is concentrated among parents living together prior to\nincarceration, and is explained by both incarceration duration and changes in relationship\nquality. And, for couples that survive this initial period, incarceration is inconsequential for\nrelationship dissolution. Taken together, these findings link the literature on the collateral\nconsequences of mass incarceration with the literature on demographic changes in family\nlife, and, given the well-known deleterious consequences of parental relationship dissolution\nfor children, have important implications for intergenerational inequality.\n",

Demographic changes\nin family life--including the postponing of marriage and the increasing number of short-term cohabit-\ning unions--mean that considerable numbers of adults experience the dissolution of romantic relation-\nships (Cherlin 2010). The consequences of relationship dissolution for adults are profound, as\ndissolution and the often resultant instability impedes parenting practices (Beck et al. 2010; Tach,\nThis article was supported by grant number AE00102 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the\nAssistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), which was awarded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration (SAMHSA).

Some scholars have suggested that aspects of\nfamily instability, including relationship dissolution, may increase income inequality and contribute to\nthe intergenerational transmission of poverty (McLanahan and Percheski 2008).\nAnother recent demographic change in the United States--the rapid and dramatic rise in\nincarceration--may contribute to relationship dissolution (Wakefield and Uggen 2010). About 2.3\nmillion U.S. residents (1 in 134 individuals) are incarcerated in prisons or jails, and even larger num-\nbers of individuals have been recently released back to their families and communities (Glaze 2011).\nThere are compelling reasons to believe that incarceration, most often experienced by poorly edu-\ncated minority men, is consequential for relationship dissolution (Wilson 1987). Indeed, most of\nthese marginal men--prior to confinement, while behind bars, and after release--are connected to\nfamilies as romantic partners and fathers (Mumola 2000).\nIncarceration, which often involves an involuntary removal of men from families, places men in a\nstate of liminality (Turner 1969), where they are simultaneously members of families and isolated\nfrom these families, and are, by and large, unable to perform their roles as romantic partners and fa-\nthers. Maintaining contact with incarcerated partners is difficult and costly and, upon release, men\nface a host of consequences including stigma and discrimination (Braman 2004), difficulty finding\nemployment (Pager 2003; Western 2006), and increased physical and mental health problems\n(Schnittker and John 2007; Turney, Wildeman, and Schnittker 2012), all of which make reintegration\ninto family life difficult.\nDespite escalating attention to the collateral consequences of incarceration on family life more\nSchnittker, and Turney 2012), and a vast literature documenting how marriage leads to desistance\nfrom crime (e.g., King, Massoglia, and MacMillan 2007; Sampson and Laub 1993), much less re-\nsearch examines the consequences of incarceration for the dissolution of marital, cohabiting, and\nnon-residential romantic relationships (though, for research on divorce, see Apel et al. 2010; Lopoo\nespecially important oversight given that many of the deleterious consequences of incarceration on\nfamily life result from relationship dissolution (e.g., Schwartz-Soicher, Geller, and Garfinkel 2011;\nTuranovic, Rodriguez, and Pratt 2012; Turney and Wildeman 2013). Given the considerable number\nof families affected by incarceration, the unequal distribution of incarceration across the population,\nand the consequences of family instability for the intergenerational transmission of inequality, it is es-\nsential to understand how the penal system--and the resultant liminality--triggers a renegotiation of\nfamily life.\nTherefore, in this article, I use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longi-\ntudinal survey of parents who share children, to consider three research questions that extend our\nknowledge about the collateral consequences of incarceration for relationship dissolution. First, how\nis paternal incarceration associated with relationship dissolution among couples that share children?\nSecond, does this association vary by parents' relationship status when their child was born? Third, to\nwhat extent do post-incarceration changes in family life (including relationship quality, economic\nwell-being, and physical and mental health) explain the association between incarceration and rela-\ntionship dissolution? The focus on relationship dissolution among incarcerated fathers--as opposed\nto all incarcerated men--is important given the negative consequences of dissolution for child well-\nbeing.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Liminal Status of Incarcerated Men\nThe historically novel rise in incarceration, mostly resulting from increased harsh sentencing policies\nfor nonviolent offenses, has had profound implications for the lives of American men (Wildeman and\nWestern 2010). Incarceration, especially for poorly educated minority men, has become a normative\nlife course period and a rite of passage that forcefully removes these men from mainstream society\n(Pettit and Western 2004). Incarcerated men experience a liminal stage that likely complicates the\nmaintenance of romantic relationships. Liminality, which was initially developed to describe a stage\nin the ritual process (e.g., religious rituals, coming-of-age rituals) but has since been applied to other\ndomains, refers to individuals who are \"neither here nor there; they are betwixt and between the posi-\ntions assigned and arrayed by law, custom, convention, and ceremony\" (Turner 1969:95). Liminality,\naccording to Victor Turner (1969), begins when individuals are removed and isolated from society,\nand ends with individuals reintegrating back into normal life and assuming their former roles. During\nthe liminal stage, individuals' roles become increasingly ambiguous, with their rights and obligations\nunclearly defined and aspects of their future uncertain (Turner 1969; for more recent applications of\nliminality, see Menji\nare often sequestered. In such a conception, incarceration is liminality, par excellence.\nTurner's (1969) conception of liminality did not include predictions about the consequences of\nliminality and, therefore, it does not provide testable hypotheses about the association between incar-\nceration and relationship dissolution. It is merely a framework for understanding the carceral period.\nFor incarcerated men, their role in family life, in particular, becomes suspended between what they\nleft behind and an unknown future. Despite the commonality of romantic relationships among incar-\ncerated men (Mumola 2000), as well as some women's commitment to maintaining relationships\nwith incarcerated partners (Comfort 2008), sustaining a relationship while one partner is behind bars\nis complicated. Incarcerated individuals are essentially held captive and, as such, have limited, regu-\nlated, and institutionalized contact with romantic partners (Sykes [1958] 2007).\nMechanisms Linking Incarceration and Relationship Dissolution\nThe duration of incarceration may be one reason why relationships dissolve as a result of incarcera-\ntion; longer incarceration stints are associated with a greater likelihood of dissolution (Massoglia\net al. 2011). But there are at least three additional plausible intervening mechanisms that may explain\nthe association between incarceration and relationship dissolution: changes in relationship quality,\nchanges in economic well-being, and changes in physical and mental health resulting from the incar-\nceration experience.\nFor one, the association between incarceration and relationship dissolution may operate through\nchanges in relationship quality. Prisons are often located far from inmates' communities, which can\nmake visits time-consuming and expensive (Mumola 2000). The often inflexible visiting schedules\nand the expense of making long-distance calls from prisons complicates relationship maintenance\n(Braman 2004; Comfort 2008). The physical separation of partners may create deficits in emotional\ninteractions or increased household labor for the partner left behind (for an excellent discussion of\nthis, see Massoglia et al. 2011). Although men often return to their pre-incarceration families and\ncommunities after release, the isolating and regimented prison experience may alter their personalities\nin ways that make maintaining romantic relationships difficult. Even among couples with high-quality\nrelationships prior to incarceration, the time spent apart may lead to poor communication, decreased\nSiennick et al. 2014; Turney 2015). Ethnographic work shows that the incarceration experience may\n1. Individuals in a liminal state are eventually reintegrated into society (Turner 1969). Therefore, individuals incarcerated for life\nwithout possibility of parole would not be considered in a liminal state.\nencourage men to engage in violent behavior (Nurse 2002) and that recently released men withdraw\nfrom their families to avoid interactions with the police (Goffman 2009). Romantic partners who ex-\nperience a precipitous drop in relationship quality are likely to dissolve their union (Booth and\nIn addition, incarceration may diminish economic well-being--among both the incarcerated and\ntheir romantic partners--and, therefore, initiate relationship dissolution. Incarcerated men have few\nopportunities to earn income and, upon release, their criminal record makes obtaining employment\ndifficult (Pager 2003). Further, women attached to incarcerated men may have increased parenting\nand household responsibilities that force them to leave the paid labor force and impede their ability\nto maintain the family's economic standard of living (Arditti, Lambert-Shute, and Joest 2003).\nIndeed, perhaps because most men economically contribute to family life prior to incarceration, re-\nsearch shows that incarceration reduces family income, intensifies material hardship, and increases re-\nliance on some forms of public assistance (Geller et al. 2011; Schwartz-Soicher et al. 2011; Sugie\n2012). Incarceration also creates challenges for mothers living in public housing, as incarcerated men\nare often not allowed to return to these dwellings (Venkatesh 2002). The stress associated with eco-\nnomic insecurity may create family conflict and lead to dissolution (McLanahan 2009).\nFinally, the association between incarceration and relationship dissolution may work through\nchanges in physical and mental health patterns among both partners. Stress theory suggests that in-\ncarceration is a stressful event associated with deleterious health consequences both throughout con-\nfinement and after release (Pearlin 1989; Turney et al. 2012) and, indeed, empirical research\ndocuments these consequences (Schnitter and John 2007). But the health consequences of incarcera-\ntion may extend beyond the offender (Lee and Wildeman 2013). Qualitative research documents the\nincarceration of a romantic partner is accompanied with anxiety, uncertainty, and loneliness (Daniel\npersist after release, as women worry about their partners violating parole (Goffman 2009) and their\nchildren's adjustment to their father's return (Turnaovic et al. 2012). Given that physical and mental\nhealth are linked to union dissolution (Wade and Pevalin 2004), post-incarceration changes in health\nmay explain the relationship between incarceration and relationship dissolution.\nExisting Evidence on the Consequences of Incarceration for Relationship Dissolution\nWhat does existing literature say about the consequences of incarceration for relationship dissolution\nin the United States? By and large, quantitative research suggests that incarceration is negatively asso-\nciated with marital dissolution. For example, data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth\n1979 (NLSY79), a longitudinal study uniquely positioned to study the consequences of incarceration,\nfinds that incarcerated men have a higher probability of divorce or separation than their non-incarcer-\nated counterparts (Lopoo and Western 2005; also see Apel et al. 2010 for an examination of the asso-\nciation between incarceration and divorce in The Netherlands). Other research shows this\nassociation between incarceration and divorce increases as incarceration duration increases\nLopoo, and McLanahan 2004). Although very little research considers the mechanisms linking incar-\nceration to divorce, recent research finds that relationship problems--especially low marital love and\nextramarital sex--are intervening processes linking incarceration to divorce (Siennick et al. 2014).\nThough quantitative research finds that incarceration unequivocally destroys marital relationships,\nqualitative research, which most often but not exclusively examines non-marital relationships, docu-\nments a more complicated and nuanced portrait of family life during and after a partner's incarcera-\ntion. These qualitative portraits show that relationship stability and instability result from a complex\ninterplay of both men's and women's reactions to the incarceration. Some men, for example, use in-\ncarceration as a time to reflect on their familial roles. Their liminal status may lead to internal confu-\nsion, but often times men return to families ready to reprise their roles as romantic partners and\nfathers (Edin, Nelson, and Paranal 2004; Roy and Dyson 2005). Qualitative research shows that\nwomen's perspectives are equally nuanced. Some women are committed to maintaining relationships\nwith incarcerated partners (Comfort 2008), yet others use the incarceration as an excuse to hasten an\nVariation by Relationship Status\nThe association between incarceration and relationship dissolution may vary by relationship type,\nand research has yet to examine this possibility.2 There are three possibilities for this variation. One\npossibility is that incarceration is more consequential for marital or cohabiting unions. The high bar\nassociated with marital unions among low-income individuals may mean that relationship difficulties\nmay be more strongly felt (Tach and Edin 2013; also see Edin and Kefalas 2005). Relatedly, couples\nin residential unions have more advantages than their counterparts in non-residential unions, and\nthese compositional differences may mean that selectivity into incarceration may be less consequen-\ntial for those in residential unions. Another possibility is that incarceration is more consequential for\nnon-residential unions, as these relationships are weaker and more prone to disruption (Tach and\nEdin 2013). A final possibility is that incarceration equally disrupts marital, cohabiting, and non-resi-\ndential romantic relationships. Many features of incarceration--including the removal of men from\nfamilies and communities and the liminality associated with incarceration--may be difficult for all\ntypes of couples. Similarly, the mechanisms linking incarceration to relationship dissolution--changes\nin relationship quality, changes in economic well-being, and changes in physical and mental health--\nmay equally affect marital, cohabiting, and non-residential romantic relationships.\nThreats to Causal Inference\nTaken together, theory and existing evidence provide strong support that paternal incarceration in-\ncreases the likelihood of relationship dissolution. But another possibility is that any observed associa-\ntion between incarceration and relationship dissolution reflects formidable selection forces.\nIncarceration is unequally distributed across the population, with individuals experiencing incarcera-\ntion (or the incarceration of a romantic partner) being more disadvantaged than their counterparts.\nThere are a number of men's and women's characteristics that might render the relationship between\nincarceration and relationship dissolution spurious. These include demographic characteristics such\nas race/ethnicity, nativity, childhood family structure, and religiosity (e.g., Amato 2000; Wakefield\nand Uggen 2010); relationship characteristics such as duration, quality, and co-parenting (e.g., Brown\nand Booth 1996; Tach and Edin 2013); socioeconomic characteristics such as education, income,\nand residence in public housing (e.g., Amato 2000; Wakefield and Uggen 2010; Wildeman et al.\n2012); and behavioral characteristics such as depression, substance abuse, impulsivity, and prior incar-\nContributions of This Research\nThere are several opportunities to advance research on the consequences of incarceration for rela-\ntionship dissolution. Importantly, though qualitative research considers the consequences of incarcer-\nation for both married and unmarried couples, little research systematically examines how\nincarceration affects relationship dissolution among married, cohabiting, and non-residential romantic\npartners. The nearly exclusive focus on divorce--as opposed to relationship dissolution more\nbroadly--is often necessary given data constraints, but unfortunate given that the majority of pris-\noners are in non-marital romantic relationships and that many of these relationships involve children\n2. Indeed, demographic changes in the United States mean that children are increasingly growing up in diverse family structures.\nNon-marital childbearing has risen steadily in recent years, and children born to unmarried parents now account for 41 percent\nof all births in the United States, including 72 percent of births to African Americans and 53 percent of births to Hispanics\n(Hamilton et al. 2014). About half of unmarried parents are cohabiting when their child is born (Martinez, Daniels, and\nThere are additional ways to extend the literature on incarceration and family instability in the\nUnited States, all of which I address in this article. First, little research adjudicates between the direct\nand indirect association between incarceration and relationship dissolution. There is evidence that in-\ncarceration duration explains the association between incarceration and divorce (Massoglia et al.\n2011), but this research does not consider the more proximal family processes that may underlie this\nrelationship (such as changes in relationship quality, economic well-being, or physical and mental\nhealth; though see Siennick et al. 2014). Additionally, the most comprehensive studies of incarcera-\ntion and dissolution in the United States use data from the NLSY79 (Lopoo and Western 2005;\nMassoglia et al. 2011), which only captures incarceration lasting at least one year (though, for re-\nsearch on relatively short incarceration spells, see Siennick et al. 2014). Understanding whether and\nhow short-lived jail incarceration, in addition to long-term prison incarceration, affects family life is\nimportant because cycling through jail is more commonly experienced than long-term prison spells\n(e.g., Minton 2012:4) and it is plausible that short-term incarceration is a sufficiently weak treatment\nthat it is not associated with relationship dissolution.\nData Source\nData come from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing survey, a longitudinal study of 4,898 new\n30- to 40-minute interview at the hospital after their child was born and fathers were interviewed as\nsoon as possible after the birth (often in the hospital). Mothers and fathers were interviewed by tele-\nphone when their children were approximately one, three, five, and nine years old. Of mothers who\nresponded to the baseline interview, 89 percent, 86 percent, 85 percent, and 76 percent completed\nthe one-, three-, five-, and nine-year surveys, respectively. About 78 percent, 69 percent, 67 percent,\n64 percent, and 59 percent of fathers completed the baseline, one-, three-, five-, and nine-year\nsurveys.\nThese data are ideal for considering the consequences of incarceration for relationship dissolution\namong parents. First, they comprise a large number of incarcerated men who, prior to incarceration,\nare in marital, cohabiting, and non-residential romantic relationships with mothers of their children.\nThe demographic characteristics of these incarcerated fathers are comparable to those of men with\nyoung children in local jails, state prisons, and federal prisons (Turney and Wildeman 2013:957).\nSecond, these data include an array of information about both partners, making it possible to rigor-\nously adjust for preexisting differences between couples that have and have not experienced incarcera-\ntion. This includes characteristics strongly associated with selection into incarceration (e.g., substance\nabuse, domestic violence, impulsivity, prior incarceration) and characteristics strongly associated with\nrelationship dissolution (e.g., relationship duration, relationship commitment). Given that both part-\nners' characteristics independently predict relationship dissolution (Tach and Edin 2013), not adjust-\ning for both mothers' and fathers' characteristics could result in omitted variable bias (Western and\nMuller 2013). Finally, the longitudinal data allow for a careful consideration of time ordering to en-\nsure incarceration precedes relationship dissolution.\nMeasures\nRelationship Dissolution\nThe dependent variables include two dummy variables: (1) immediate dissolution, measured be-\ntween the three- and five-year surveys; and (2) delayed dissolution, measured between the five- and\nnine-year surveys. Relationship dissolution is measured when the mother reports being in a marital,\ncohabiting, or non-residential romantic relationship with the focal child's father at the three-year sur-\nvey and subsequently reports being in no relationship with the father at the five- or nine-year surveys,\nrespectively. These measures come from mothers' reports of relationship status with the father, op-\nposed to fathers' reports of relationship status, as mothers have lower attrition rates.3\nOf the currently incarcerated (see below), 23.6 percent are married, 27.8 percent are in a cohabit-\ning relationship, and 48.6 percent are in a non-residential romantic relationship (compared to 57.0\npercent, 34.4 percent, and 8.6 percent of not currently incarcerated fathers, respectively). This, of\ncourse, raises the question: How can one be in a cohabiting relationship with a father who is incarcer-\nated? Indeed, the measurement of cohabitation can be quite ambiguous (e.g., Nepomnyaschy and\nTeitler 2013; Waller and Jones 2014). One of two things is likely going on. First, it is important to\nnote that mothers are considered to be cohabiting if they report living with the father \"all or most\" of\nthe time and, accordingly, it is possible that a mother living with the father prior to his incarceration\nconsiders herself living with the father most of the time. Second, it is possible that, when asked this\nquestion, mothers reference their living situation prior to incarceration, perhaps because they expect\nthe father to move back in after his incarceration stint ends (see, especially, Comfort 2008).\nFurthermore, for mothers who were cohabiting with the father prior to his incarceration but do not\nreport they are cohabiting with the father when he is incarcerated, there is no reason to expect them\nto report not being in a (non-residential) romantic relationship. The data do not allow me to test\nthis possibility, but qualitative research convincingly shows that unmarried women are in relation-\nships with incarcerated men and consider themselves to be involved with these men (see, especially,\nIncarceration\nThe primary explanatory variable is paternal incarceration, measured at the three-year survey. Fathers\nare considered incarcerated if (1) the father is interviewed in prison or jail at the three-year survey or\n(2) the father did not participate in the three-year survey but the mother reports he is in prison or\njail. The reliance on both parents' reports of incarceration is consistent with other research showing\nthe effectiveness of this approach (Geller et al. 2012).\nMeasuring incarceration at the three-year survey, as opposed to a more expansive indicator captur-\ning incarceration between survey waves, is necessary for establishing appropriate time ordering be-\ntween incarceration and relationship dissolution. Though it is possible to construct a measure that\ncaptures incarceration between the three- and five-year surveys, it is impossible to determine if incar-\nceration preceded or followed relationship dissolution (and theory suggests either is possible).4\nAdditionally, though measuring incarceration between the one- and three-year surveys would ensure\nappropriate time ordering, it is not possible to precisely measure incarceration during this time pe-\nriod. Only first-time incarceration is captured between the one- and three-year surveys, which means\nthat the comparison group would include fathers not incarcerated during this time period and fathers\nwho experienced a second or higher order incarceration during this time period. The data do include\nmeasures of current paternal incarceration at the baseline and one-year surveys, but I focus on incar-\nceration at the three-year survey because this is the only wave where enough fathers are incarcerated\nto conduct meaningful analyses. Importantly, though the measure of current incarceration necessi-\ntates a relatively small number of incarcerated men, descriptive statistics comparing currently and re-\ncently incarcerated men (defined as men incarcerated after the three-year survey and up to and\nincluding the five-year survey, a common way of operationalizing fathers' incarceration with these\n3. The majority of parents agree about their relationship status. At the five-year survey, for example, 96 percent of mothers and fa-\nthers agree on marriage reports and 92 percent agree on cohabitation reports. At the nine-year survey, this was true of 97 percent\nand 96 percent of mothers and fathers, respectively. Some of the small number of disagreements may result from time differences\nbetween the mothers' and fathers' interviews (Knab and McLanahan 2006). Supplemental analyses adjusted for this time differ-\nence but they did not substantively alter the results and, therefore, are not included in the final analyses.\n4. Only nine observations in the analytic sample have non-missing data on the date of incarceration entry and the date of relation-\nship dissolution (between the three- and five-year surveys), making it impossible to ascertain appropriate time ordering.\nstantively significant differences between these two groups (see Appendix Table A1).\nThe incarceration measure is advantageous because it relies on both parents' reports, is measured\nprior to relationship dissolution, and captures both jail and prison spells. The measure is limited,\nthough, because it does not take into account incarceration duration and offense type. Mothers were\nasked questions about fathers' incarceration duration and offense type. But these questions contain\ntoo much missing data--in the analytic sample, 45 percent of incarcerated fathers are missing data\nabout incarceration duration and 32 percent are missing data about offense type--to conduct mean-\ningful analyses. As previous research documents that both duration (Massoglia et al. 2011) and of-\nfense type (Apel et al. 2010) influence dissolution, I address the implications of this limitation in the\ndiscussion section.\nAdditional Covariates\nGiven that selection into incarceration is a key threat to causal inference, the multivariate analyses ad-\njust for a host of demographic, relationship, economic, and behavioral characteristics that may alter\nthe association between incarceration and relationship dissolution. Importantly, unless otherwise\nnoted, all variables are measured at the baseline or one-year surveys and, thus, prior to the measure\nof incarceration. To begin with, demographic factors include the following: mother's race (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic other race); a dummy variable indicating\nthe mother and father are a mixed-race couple; dummy variables indicating mother's and father's im-\nmigrant status; continuous variables measuring mother's and father's age; dummy variables indicating\nmother's and father's family structure at age 15; and mother's frequency of attendance at religious ser-\nvices (weekly, occasionally, never).\nAdditionally, analyses adjust for relationship characteristics prior to incarceration. Dummy vari-\nables indicate the couple's relationship status at the focal child's birth (married, cohabiting, non-resi-\ndential romantic relationship, separated). Continuous variables indicate relationship duration\n(measured by mothers' reports of how long the couple knew each other before she became pregnant\nwith the focal child) and the mother's and father's reports of overall relationship quality (1 \u00bc poor to\n5 \u00bc excellent). Mother's reports of father's shared responsibility in parenting averages responses to\nhow often the father does the following (1 \u00bc never to 4 \u00bc often): (1) looks after child when you need\nto do things; (2) runs errands like picking things up from the store; (3) fixes things around the\nhome, paints, or helps make it look nicer in other ways; and (4) takes the child places he/she needs\nto go such as to daycare or the doctor (a \u00bc .73). Mother's reports of father's cooperation in parenting\naverages the following (1 \u00bc never to 4 \u00bc always): (1) when father is with child, he acts like the kind\nof parent you want for your child; (2) you can trust father to take good care of child; (3) father re-\nspects the schedules and rules you make for child; (4) father supports you in the way you want to\nraise child; (5) you and father talk about problems that come up with raising child; and (6) you can\ncount on father for help when you need someone to look after child for a few hours (a \u00bc .84).\nDummy variables indicate the couple has additional children together, the mother has children with a\ndifferent partner, and the father has children with a different partner. Following prior research (Tach\nand Edin 2013), relationship commitment is measured as a sum of mother's baseline reports of the\nfollowing: (1) father provided financial support during pregnancy; (2) the child will have father's last\nname; and (3) the father visited the mother in the hospital (range: 0 to 3). Mother's pro-marriage at-\ntitudes averages the following (1 \u00bc strongly disagree to 4 \u00bc strongly agree): (1) the main advantage of\nmarriage is that it gives financial security; (2) there are more advantages to being single than to being\nmarried (reverse coded); (3) a mother living alone can bring up her child as well as a married couple\n(reverse coded); (4) it is better for a couple to get married than to just live together; (5) it is better\nfor children if their parents are married; and (6) living together is just the same as being married (re-\nverse coded) (a \u00bc .58). Mother's traditional attitudes is an average of the following (1 \u00bc strongly dis-\nagree to 4 \u00bc strongly agree): (1) the important decisions in the family should be made by the man of\nthe house and (2) it is much better for everyone if the man earns the main living and the woman\ntakes care of the home and family (a \u00bc .59). Mother's gender distrust is an average of the following\n(1 \u00bc strongly disagree to 4 \u00bc strongly agree): (1) in a dating relationship, a man is largely out to take\nadvantage of a woman and (2) men cannot be trusted to be faithful (a \u00bc .62).\nMother's and father's economic characteristics, all measured prior to incarceration, include educa-\ntion, employment, income-to-poverty ratio, welfare receipt, and residence in public housing.\nEducational attainment is measured with a series of dummy variables (less than high school, high\nschool diploma or GED, post-secondary education). Dummy variables indicate the mother and father\nworked in the last week. The income-to-poverty ratio, based on reports of household size and com-\nposition, is the ratio of the total household income to the official poverty thresholds established by\nthe U.S. Census Bureau. A dummy variable indicates the mother received Temporary Assistance for\nNeedy Families (TANF) in the past year.\nFinally, analyses adjust for mother's and father's physical and mental health prior to incarceration.\nMother's and father's major depression is measured by responses to the Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF) Version 1.0 (Kessler et al. 1998). Parenting stress is\nmeasured by averaging the following responses (1 \u00bc strongly disagree to 4 \u00bc strongly agree): (1) being\na parent is harder than I thought it would be; (2) I feel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent;\n(3) taking care of my children is much more work than pleasure; (4) I often feel tired, worn out, or\nexhausted from raising a family (a \u00bc .60 for mothers, a \u00bc .58 for fathers). Dummy variables indicate\nthe mother and father report fair or poor health. Dummy variables indicate heavy drinking (the\nmother or father reports having four or more drinks in one sitting) and illicit drug use in the past\nmonth. Domestic violence is a dummy variable indicating the mother reported the father hit, slapped,\nor kicked her. Father's impulsivity is an average of the following (1 \u00bc strongly disagree to 4 \u00bc strongly\nagree): (1) I will often say whatever comes into my head without thinking first; (2) often, I don't\nspend enough time thinking over a situation before I act; (3) I often say and do things without con-\nsidering the consequences; (4) I often get into trouble because I don't think before I act; (5) many\ntimes, the plans I make don't work out because I haven't gone over them carefully enough in ad-\nvance; (6) I often make up my mind without taking the time to consider the situation from all angles\n(a \u00bc .84). A dummy variable indicates the father was ever incarcerated at or prior to the one-year sur-\nvey (including prior to baseline).5\nMechanisms\nIn some analyses, I examine four sets of mechanisms that may explain the relationship between incar-\nceration and relationship dissolution: (1) extended incarceration, a dummy variable indicating the fa-\nther was incarcerated at the five-year survey; (2) relationship quality after incarceration entry,\nmeasured by mother and father overall relationship quality, father shared responsibility in parenting,\nfather cooperation in parenting, and reports of domestic violence at the three-year survey; (3) eco-\nnomic well-being after incarceration entry, measured by mother and father employment and income-\nto-poverty ratio at the three-year survey; and (4) health after incarceration entry, measured by\nmother and father depression, mother and father fair or poor health, and father heavy drinking and il-\nlicit drug use at the three-year survey.\nAnalytic Sample\nThe primary analytic sample comprises 2,201 observations. I first deleted the 2,488 observations in\nwhich the mother did not report being in a relationship with the focal child's father at the three-year\n5. Ideally, I would measure prior incarceration by considering a father as being previously incarcerated if he experienced any incar-\nceration through the three-year survey (but was not incarcerated at the three-year survey). However, measuring prior incarcera-\ntion in this manner would mean that all previously incarcerated men are coded as not currently incarcerated. This lack of\nvariation makes it impossible to match on previous incarceration and, therefore, I consider prior incarceration through the one-\nyear survey.\nsurvey, as these observations are not at risk of relationship dissolution. I then deleted the additional\n209 observations in which the mother did not complete the five-year survey.6 Importantly, it is proba-\nble this analytic sample excludes men incarcerated at the three-year survey who already experienced\ndissolution prior to the three-year survey (but after their incarceration). Given that it is likely that the\nproportion of incarcerated men whose relationships dissolved exceeds the proportion of non-incar-\ncerated men whose relationships dissolved, estimates should be considered conservative consequences\nof incarceration. This analytic sample also excludes couples that already dissolved their union and,\ntherefore, is selective of more advantaged and stable couples, again suggesting conservative estimates.\nThe vast majority of variables are missing data for fewer than 2 percent of observations.\nExceptions include several variables that come from fathers' interviews (father's reports of relation-\nship quality [missing 25 percent of observations], father's parenting stress [24 percent], and father's\nimpulsivity [24 percent]), as attrition was higher among fathers than mothers (though, when fathers\ndid not participate and when possible, I use mothers' reports of fathers' information (e.g., father's\nrace/ethnicity, father's education). I preserve missing values with multiple imputation, producing 25\nimputed data sets and averaging results across data sets.\nAnalytic Strategy\nThe analytic strategy contains three stages. In the first analytic stage (Tables 2, 3, and 4), propensity\nscore models estimate the consequences of incarceration for immediate relationship dissolution (be-\ntween the three- and five-year surveys) and delayed relationship dissolution (between the five- and\nnine-year surveys, conditional on not experiencing immediate relationship dissolution). Propensity\nscore matching is one way to diminish concerns about observed heterogeneity between groups, and,\nindeed, there are important pre-incarceration differences between couples that do and do not experi-\nence paternal incarceration. Propensity score matching is also useful given the relatively small number\nof men incarcerated at the three-year survey. This method approximates an experimental design by\nusing observed variables to comprise a treatment group (incarcerated fathers) and a control group\n(not incarcerated fathers) that have a similar distribution of covariates (and vary only by incarcera-\ntion). However, propensity score matching is limited because it cannot account for unobserved charac-\nteristics of individuals, a point I return to in the discussion.\nA logistic regression model generates a propensity score, which signifies the probability of incar-\nceration, as a function of 50 pre-incarceration covariates for each observation in each of the 25 im-\nputed data sets. I match observations on propensity scores, restrict the analyses to regions of\ncommon support, check the balance of the covariates to ensure that the treatment and control groups\nhave similar values on observed covariates (Morgan and Harding 2006), and estimate relationship\ndissolution as a function of incarceration. The analyses presented use kernel matching (treatment\nN \u00bc 69, control N \u00bc 2,124), comparing each treatment observation with all control observations that\nare weighted according to their distance from treatment cases (bandwidth \u00bc .006; ker-\nnel \u00bc epanechnikov), though supplemental analyses using alternative matching strategies (e.g., near-\nest neighbor with five neighbors, nearest neighbor with ten neighbors, radius) produce similar\nestimates. I average logistic regression results estimating relationship dissolution across the 25 im-\nputed data sets.\nIn additional analyses, I take three steps to consider the robustness of the findings. First, because\nthere may be subtle differences between the treatment and control groups after matching, I conduct\ndoubly robust propensity score analyses by further adjusting for all covariates (Schafer and Kang\n2008). Second, I minimize (though do not eliminate) unobserved heterogeneity by restricting the\nsample to a potentially more appropriate comparison group, observations where the father\n6. Fathers did not have to be interviewed at the five-year survey to be included in the analytic sample. Also, the analytic sample\nused to estimate relationship dissolution between the five- and nine-year surveys is smaller (n \u00bc 1,770) because it excludes par-\nents who did not participate in the nine-year survey.\nexperienced previous incarceration (LaLonde 1986). Third, I estimate Mantel-Haenszel bounds to\nevaluate how sensitive the propensity score results are to such unmeasured characteristics (Becker\nand Caliendo 2007). The Mantel-Haenszel bounds quantify how large unobserved factors would\nhave to be to render the association between incarceration and relationship dissolution statistically\ninsignificant.\nIn the second analytic stage (Table 5), propensity score models estimate the association between\nincarceration and relationship dissolution for two subgroups: couples living together at baseline and\ncouples not living together at baseline. I consider variation by relationship status at baseline because\nit is an important predictor of both union formation and dissolution (Carlson, McLanahan, and\nEngland 2008; Tach and Edin 2013) and to ensure that I am measuring relationship status prior to in-\ncarceration. There are a small number of fathers incarcerated at the baseline survey. In the analyses\npresented, these fathers are considered to be not living together at baseline; however, supplemental\nanalyses that instead consider them to be living together at baseline produce substantively similar\nresults.\nIn the final analytic stage (Table 6), I adjudicate between the direct and indirect association be-\ntween incarceration and dissolution by considering four sets of mechanisms that may explain the as-\nsociation between incarceration and relationship dissolution: extended incarceration, relationship\nquality after incarceration entry, economic well-being after incarceration entry, and physical and men-\ntal health after incarceration entry. Logistic regression models estimate relationship dissolution as a\nfunction of the mechanisms, controlling for the treatment and the propensity for the treatment (Kirk\nand Sampson 2013). Model 1 presents the baseline estimate for the association between incarceration\nand relationship dissolution. Model 2 includes an indicator of extended incarceration. Model 3 in-\ncludes relationship quality, Model 4 includes economic characteristics, and Model 5 includes physical\nand mental health.7 Model 6 adjusts for all possible mechanisms. I compare Model 1 to Models 2, 3,\n4, 5, and 6 to examine what percentage of the association between incarceration and relationship dis-\nsolution can be explained by these mechanisms. Because comparing coefficients across logistic regres-\nsion models is not recommended (Mood 2010), I also estimate linear probability models and\ncompare the results from the logistic and linear probability models. Further, I conduct formal Sobel-\nGoodman tests of mediation. The Sobel-Goodman tests the following: (1) the relationship between\nincarceration and each proposed mediator; (2) the relationship between each proposed mediator and\nrelationship dissolution; (3) the relationship between incarceration and relationship dissolution with-\nout the mediator; and (4) the relationship between incarceration and relationship dissolution without\nthe mediator (and the difference in the relationship with and without the mediator) (Baron and\nSample Description\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics of all variables. In the analytic sample, which includes parents in\na relationship when their children are three years old, almost two-fifths of relationships dissolved be-\ntween the three- and nine-year surveys. About 21 percent of relationships dissolved within two years\n(between the three- and five-year surveys), and an additional 16 percent dissolved between the five-\nand nine-year surveys. With respect to the key explanatory variable, about 3 percent of fathers are in-\ncarcerated at the three-year survey.\nWith respect to demographic characteristics, more than one-quarter (28 percent) of the mothers\nare non-Hispanic white, nearly two-fifths (38 percent) are non-Hispanic black, and nearly one-third\n7. Father's and, especially, mother's repartnering may be another relationship characteristic that links incarceration to relationship\ndissolution. Unfortunately, it is impossible to establish time ordering between repartnering and dissolution and, as such, I cannot\nconsider this mechanism in my analyses.\n8. These tests were performed with the sgmediation command in Stata. However, because this command does not handle binary\noutcomes or multiply imputed data, I conducted the analyses with linear probability models and one imputed data set.\nTable 1.

About 13 percent of couples are mixed-race couples. One-fifth of respon-\ndents (20 percent of mothers and 21 percent of fathers) are foreign born. Mothers and fathers were,\non average, 26 and 29 years old when the focal child was born, respectively. Nearly two-fifths (39 per-\ncent) of couples were married, two-fifths (41 percent) were cohabiting, and one-fifth (18 percent)\nwere in a non-residential romantic relationship at the birth. More than two-fifths (45 percent) of par-\nents have an additional child together, though many parents (30 percent of mothers and 28 percent\nof fathers) have children with other partners. More than half (52 percent) of mothers and nearly\nthree-fifths (58 percent) of fathers did not have education beyond a high school diploma or GED.\nMore than one-fifth (21 percent) of fathers were incarcerated prior to the three-year survey.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive Differences in Relationship Dissolution by Incarceration\nDescriptive statistics, presented in Figure 1, show dramatic differences in relationship dissolution by\nfathers' incarceration. For example, nearly three-fifths (58 percent) of incarcerated fathers, compared\nto just one-fifth (20 percent) of not incarcerated fathers, experienced relatively immediate relation-\nship dissolution (i.e., dissolution that occurred between the three- and five-year surveys). Further, af-\nter restricting the sample to couples that did not experience immediate dissolution, there are large\ndescriptive differences in delayed relationship dissolution (i.e., dissolution that occurred between the\nfive- and nine-year surveys). About 54 percent of incarcerated fathers and 20 percent of not incarcer-\nated fathers experienced dissolution.\nPropensity Score Models Estimating Relationship Dissolution\nPre- and Post-Match Differences\nThe first step of propensity score matching involves generating propensity scores of incarceration as\na function of the covariates in Table 1. These analyses, not presented but available upon request, are\nconsistent with expectations. For example, non-Hispanic black mothers, compared to non-Hispanic\nwhite mothers, have about 2.78 times the odds of sharing a child with an incarcerated father.\nEmployed fathers have a lower likelihood of incarceration than their non-employed counterparts, and\nfathers' reports of relationship quality are negatively correlated with incarceration. This model fits the\ndata well, explaining about two-fifths (41 percent) of the variance in incarceration.\nNext, I present descriptive differences between the treatment and control groups, both prior to\nmatching and after matching. The first three columns of Table 2 show that, as expected, there are\nsubstantial descriptive differences between couples that did and did not experience the fathers'\nincarceration. For example, incarcerated fathers and their partners are more likely to be racial/ethnic\nminorities, have lower educational attainment, lower income-to-poverty ratios, and more multi-\npartnered fertility. Incarcerated fathers also have more impulsive behaviors and are more likely to\nhave been previously incarcerated. The remaining columns in Table 2 present descriptive differences\nbetween the treatment and control group after matching. These columns show that, after matching,\nthe differences between the treatment and control group are small and, across all imputed data sets,\nstatistically insignificant.\nEstimating Relationship Dissolution\nTable 3 presents estimates from propensity score matching that document differences in relationship\ndissolution by incarceration. The unmatched estimates show that incarceration is associated with a\nples who remain together through the five-year survey, a greater likelihood of delayed dissolution\nthe unmatched differences, the link between paternal incarceration and immediate relationship\ndissolution remains robust. Incarcerated fathers, compared to their counterparts, have more than two\ntimes the odds of experiencing immediate relationship dissolution (b \u00bc .820, OR \u00bc 2.27, p < .01).\nHowever, the matched estimates show no differences in delayed dissolution between incarcerated\nand not incarcerated men, suggesting that, when partners manage to survive the initial period, incar-\nceration has no lasting consequences for dissolution.9\nTable 3 also presents results from two strategies used to consider the robustness of the findings.\nThe first strategy, the estimation of doubly robust propensity scores, further adjusts for all covariates\nincluded in the matching equation. These findings, which are consistent with the results that do not\nadjust for these covariates, show that incarceration is associated with a greater likelihood of immediate\nThe second strategy compares incarcerated men to a potentially more appropriate comparison group,\nmen who experienced prior incarceration but were not currently incarcerated.

Given the propensity score matching results show incarceration is only\nsignificantly associated with immediate relationship dissolution, I restrict this table to that outcome.\nThese findings show that any unobserved characteristics not included in the propensity score would\nImmediate relationship\ndissolution\nDelayed relationship\ndissolution\nPercent\nTiming of Dissolution\nIncarcerated\nNot incarcerated\nFigure 1. Relationship Dissolution, by Father Incarceration\nNotes: Immediate relationship dissolution refers to dissolution between the three- and five-year surveys.\nDelayed relationship dissolution refers to dissolution between the five- and nine-year surveys and is restricted\nto couples that did not experience immediate relationship dissolution.\n9. Readers should exercise caution when interpreting these results, as the null findings may result from the small number of cases\nin the treatment group instead of a lack of differences between the two groups, and future research with a larger sample should\ninvestigate this possibility. I conducted two robustness checks (not presented but available upon request). First, I restricted the\nsample estimating immediate relationship dissolution to the smaller sample used to estimate delayed relationship dissolution\n(which is smaller because of higher attrition at the nine-year survey than the five-year survey). Results are consistent, suggesting\nthe differential findings for immediate and delayed dissolution do not result from different samples. Second, given the relatively\nfrequent relationship churning among couples in the Fragile Families data, I considered a more stringent measure of relation-\nship dissolution, considering couples to have dissolved their union if the mother reported not being in a relationship with the\nfather at the five- and nine-year surveys. Indeed, a nontrivial number of couples (16 percent) reported dissolution at the five-\nyear survey and a romantic relationship with the father at the nine-year survey. Results are even larger in magnitude when using\nthis more stringent dependent variable.\n10. In estimates of delayed relationship dissolution, too few incarcerated men experienced previous incarceration to make meaning-\nful comparisons.\nTable 2.

Thus, although it is possible that unob-\nserved characteristics could render the relationship between incarceration and relationship dissolution\nstatistically insignificant, these unobserved selection forces would need to be substantial.\nIncarceration and Relationship Dissolution, by Relationship Status\nIn Table 5, I consider the possibility that the association between incarceration and relationship dis-\nsolution varies by relationship status prior to incarceration. Given that results for the full sample\nshow no association between incarceration and delayed relationship dissolution, I only consider im-\nmediate relationship dissolution here. The first row considers the association between incarceration\nand relationship dissolution among couples living together at baseline. The findings are consistent\nwith results for the full sample, with the matched estimates showing that incarceration is associated\nwith a greater likelihood of dissolution within two years (b \u00bc 1.603, OR \u00bc 4.97, p < .001). The sec-\nond set of models considers the association between incarceration and dissolution among couples\nnot living together at baseline, and the matched estimates show no association between incarceration\nand relationship dissolution (b \u00bc .126, OR \u00bc 1.13, n.s.). Tests for differences across the two groups\n(Paternoster et al. 1998) show the differences are statistically significant (z \u00bc 2.378), suggesting that\nresults are concentrated among co-residential couples.11 See Figure 2 for predicted probabilities of re-\nlationship dissolution by residential status prior to incarceration.\nMechanisms Underlying the Association between Incarceration and Relationship Dissolution\nThe association between incarceration and relationship dissolution may result directly from incarcera-\ntion or may result from a number of pathways, and I consider these possibilities in Table 6. The base-\nline estimate, a logistic regression model estimating relationship dissolution as a function of\nincarceration and the propensity for incarceration, is presented in Model 1. In Model 2, I adjust for\nextended incarceration, a dummy variable indicating that the father is incarcerated at the five-year\nTable 3.

These results, especially, should be interpreted with caution, as fathers incarcerated at the\nthree- and five-year surveys were not necessarily continuously incarcerated and dissolution could\nhave preceded incarceration.\nThe next three models consider relationship quality, economic well-being, and health as mecha-\nnisms. In Model 3, which adjusts for post-incarceration and pre-dissolution relationship quality, the\nassociation between paternal incarceration is reduced by 61 percent and to statistical insignificance.\nTable 4.

The model that includes all potential mechanisms, Model 6, shows no\nstatistically significant association between incarceration and relationship dissolution. In fact, in this\nmodel even extended incarceration is not significantly associated with relationship dissolution.12\nResidential Non-Residential\nIncarcerated\nNot incarcerated\nFigure 2.

Given the perils of comparing coefficients across logistic regression models (Mood 2010), I conducted auxiliary linear probabil-\nity models estimating relationship dissolution as a function of incarceration and the mechanisms. These linear probability mod-\nels produced results consistent with those from the logistic regression models. Extended incarceration, relationship quality,\neconomic well-being, and health explain, respectively, 42 percent, 75 percent, 1 percent, and 13 percent of the association be-\ntween paternal incarceration and relationship dissolution. Furthermore, the salience of relationship quality--and, in particular,\nshared responsibility in parenting and co-parenting--as a mediator is confirmed with formal Sobel-Goodman tests of\nmediation.\nTable 6.

But despite this burgeoning literature, and despite the fact that much research on the dele-\nterious consequences of incarceration for women and children suggest these associations operate\nthrough relationship dissolution (e.g., Geller et al. 2012; Schwartz-Soicher et al. 2011; Turney and\nWildeman 2013; Wildeman et al. 2012), little research considers how the liminal carceral period af-\nfects relationship dissolution among parents with young children. This is an important oversight\ngiven the large number of already disadvantaged children affected by both incarceration and the dis-\nsolution of parental relationships.\nIn this article, I use longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a data\nsource distinctively positioned to examine the collateral consequences of incarceration for relation-\nship dissolution. The results yield three main conclusions. Perhaps most consequentially, results\nshow that among couples with children, incarceration leads to a greater likelihood of relatively imme-\ndiate relationship dissolution (dissolution that occurs between the three- and five-year surveys). The\nfindings are consistent across a variety of specifications, all of which match incarcerated fathers to\ntheir non-incarcerated counterparts. Importantly, given that couples dissolving their union before their\nchild was three years old are excluded from the analytic sample, these results are almost certainly con-\nservative. Though I consider dissolution to be an undesirable outcome, primarily because of its harm-\nful consequences for children, it is also possible that incarceration has positive, liberating\nconsequences for women. Incarceration provides women with the freedom to reorganize family life\nto exclude their incarcerated partner, perhaps paradoxically given the lack of freedom afforded to in-\ncarcerated and recently released men.\nSecond, I find that incarceration is associated with dissolution among couples living together prior\nto incarceration but not among non-residential couples. Considering this variation by residential sta-\ntus is important, as it bridges the quantitative research on the association between incarceration and\nand the qualitative literature on mostly unmarried couples (Edin et al. 2004; Nurse 2002; Waller and\nan array of challenges to maintaining relationships (Tach and Edin 2010) and, accordingly, incarcera-\ntion is not independently associated with the dissolution of these relationships. Importantly, by show-\ning that incarceration is consequential for both marital and cohabiting unions, these results also\nsuggest that previous quantitative research, which has nearly exclusively considered marital dissolu-\ntion, may underestimate the consequences of incarceration for family life.\nThird, I find that two plausible mechanisms--including extended incarceration and relationship\nquality (especially mothers' relationship quality)--explain a rather substantial portion of the associa-\ntion between incarceration and relationship dissolution. The findings about extended incarceration\nare consistent with other research (Massoglia et al. 2011). And the findings about relationship quality\nare consistent with other research finding that relationship problems (especially low marital love and\nextra-marital sex) are important intervening mechanisms linking incarceration to divorce (Siennick\net al. 2014). Importantly, though, fathers' shared responsibility in parenting and cooperation in par-\nenting are the most substantial intervening mechanisms. The fact that these parenting behaviors are\nso important is broadly consistent with qualitative research on incarceration (Braman 2004), research\nsuggesting incarceration destroys co-parental relationships (Turney and Wildeman 2013), and re-\nsearch on the \"package deal\" of marriage and parenthood (Tach et al. 2010).\nTaken together, these findings make several important theoretical and empirical contributions.\nTheoretically, I draw on the work of Turner (1969), who first put forth the idea of liminality\n(primarily to describe rites of passage), to suggest that incarceration embodies a liminal experience.\nIncarcerated men are \"betwixt and between\" (Turner 1969:95). They are currently separated and iso-\nlated from their families. But, at the same time, they are members of families and eventually will be\nreintegrated into society and at least some of their family roles. Unfortunately, these data are not de-\nsigned to test the concept of liminality and, accordingly, this is merely a framework for understanding\nthe conditions of incarcerated men as family members. Future research, especially qualitative research\nthat may be especially suited to examine this (e.g., Menjivar 2006), should conceptualize and measure\nthe liminality experienced by the incarcerated, test hypotheses about the consequences of liminality\nfor family life, and compare and contrast consider additional types of liminal states (e.g., undocu-\nmented immigrants, military personnel).\nEmpirically, these findings advance our knowledge about incarceration and relationship dissolu-\ntion in several ways. First, I consider dissolution among married, cohabiting, and non-residential ro-\nmantic couples. The consideration of multiple relationship types is important because the modal\nprisoner is in a romantic relationship but not a marital one. This is also important because\nchildren--especially children in disadvantaged communities where incarceration is common--are\nincreasingly born to unmarried parents and experience deleterious outcomes when these unions\ndissolve. I also consider both short-term jail spells, the most common type of incarceration, and long-\nterm prison spells, although future data collection efforts should distinguish between jail and prison\nexperiences.\nThere are additional contributions of this research. I consider the family-level mechanisms linking\nincarceration to relationship dissolution and adjust for characteristics of both partners, thereby as-\nsuaging some threats to causal inference. Also, the longitudinal data allows for a consideration of\nboth immediate and delayed relationship dissolution. This distinction is important, as findings show\nthat relationships surviving the initial post-incarceration period suffer no deleterious consequences, at\nleast with respect to dissolution, consistent with qualitative research showing that some relationships\nthrive during incarceration (Comfort 2008). Finally, I consider men with children, an especially im-\nportant demographic group given the consequences of father absence for child well-being (Sigle-\nLimitations\nThough these data provide an exceptional opportunity to examine the consequences of incarceration\nfor family life, and are commonly used to answer such questions, there are several data limitations,\nmany of which have already been discussed. First, these observational data, coupled with the non-\nrandom selection of individuals into incarceration, preclude causal conclusions. Although I take great\nstrides to reduce unobserved heterogeneity--via propensity score matching, further adjusting for\nobserved covariates, restricting the sample to fathers at risk of incarceration, and considering how\nlarge unobserved factors would have to be to render the association spurious--the analyses do not\nrule out all possible unobserved heterogeneity, and future research should strive to employ creative\nresearch designs situated in a counterfactual, or causal, framework.\nAdditionally, the incarceration measure is limited. It is possible that incarceration lasting one\nmonth is likely differentially associated with relationship dissolution than incarceration lasting one\nyear, and prison incarceration and jail incarceration may differentially affect relationship dissolution.\nSimilarly, the association between incarceration and relationship dissolution may vary by the father's\ndistance from home or the frequency of mother's visits. These data provide inadequate opportunities\nto consider such nuances. The data also do not include the precise timing of relationship dissolution,\nand is instead limited to broad time periods (between the three- and five-year surveys and between\n13. Importantly, results would likely be even stronger if I were to consider both men with and without children, as research sug-\ngests that the association between incarceration and relationship dissolution is stronger for men without children (Apel et al.\nthe five-and nine-year surveys). Future quantitative research should collect data at more regular inter-\nvals (e.g., weekly, monthly) to both more precisely identify the timing of dissolution and further un-\nravel the familial and decision-making processes leading to dissolution. Future qualitative research\nshould investigate how incarcerated men and their partners define and describe their relationships, as\ncohabitation can be difficult to measure and the survey data shown here suggest that women report\nliving together with men who are incarcerated (Knab and McLanahan 2006).\nFinally, a consideration of time ordering (e.g., ensuring incarceration precedes dissolution) neces-\nsitates an examination of current incarceration--as opposed to incarceration that occurred in the re-\ncent past--and, as such, the number of incarcerated fathers is small (even though the full Fragile\nFamilies sample includes a relatively large number of incarcerated men). This is especially true be-\ncause the sample is further limited by fathers at risk of relationship dissolution (those in a romantic\nrelationship at the three-year survey). However, descriptive analyses show few differences between\ncurrently incarcerated men and recently incarcerated men and the careful consideration of time or-\ndering is necessary to most rigorously estimate the relationship between incarceration and dissolu-\ntion. The relatively small number of incarcerated men plagues most existing research on incarceration\nand relationship dissolution (e.g., Massoglia et al. 2011; Siennick et al. 2014) and researchers should\nconsider designing a longitudinal survey of incarcerated men and their family members.\nConclusions\nThis article documents that paternal incarceration is associated with relatively immediate relationship\ndissolution among parents and that this association is explained by both extended incarceration and\npost-incarceration changes in relationship quality. Broadly, these findings add to a rapidly growing lit-\nerature on the consequences of paternal incarceration for family life and family inequality. Similar to\nthe recent demographic changes that have transformed family life--such as trends in non-marital\nchildbearing--incarceration rates have increased rapidly over the past four decades. Incarcerated indi-\nviduals, though, do not exist in isolation. Instead, while incarcerated, they experience a period of limi-\nnality where they are both connected to and disconnected from families. By documenting how and\nunder what conditions the collateral consequences of incarceration extend beyond the offender, and\nspill over to the families of offenders, this research highlights the considerable influence and unin-\ntended consequences of the penal system.\nAPPENDIX\nTable A1.
