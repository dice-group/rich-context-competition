This trend is thought to reflect the fact that people tend\nto be emotionally closer with friends and romantic partners than kin. However, as the cost of\naltruism increases, altruistic preference shifts to kin. The present study highlights this\nphenomenon by examining altruism between siblings, romantic partners, romantic partners who\nhave biological children together, and romantic partners who have adopted children together.\nParticipants (n = 203) completed a questionnaire about altruism in low-, medium-, and high-cost\nsituations. Participants gave more low-cost help to their romantic partners (regardless of whether\nthey had a child together) than their siblings. More medium-cost help was given to romantic\npartners who had a child (biological and adopted) than siblings and romantic partners without\nchildren. In the high-cost condition, the estimated altruistic tendencies were stronger toward\nsiblings and romantic partners who have a biological child than toward romantic partners with no\nchildren and partners with adopted children. Participants also believed they were more altruistic\nthan their siblings and romantic partners.\n",

This\naltruistic behavior preserves the same gene in other individuals when the altruistic agent extends\naid to kin members \u00ad the individuals who are most likely to carry a copy of the same altruism\ngene. This concept is nicely illustrated by Hamilton's rule (c < br), which indicates that an\naltruist will perform an altruistic act when the biological cost (c) is less than the product of the\nreproductive benefits (b) and the genetic relatedness (r) shared between the altruist and recipient.\nAltruism between romantic partners\nStudies following Hamilton's work have shown that individuals indicate greater altruistic\nintentions toward close kin than non-kin or more distantly related kin in hypothetical life\nthreatening situations (Burnstein, Crandall, and Kitayama, 1994; Fitzgerald and Colarelli, 2009;\n2008). More clearly, the amount of aid one is willing to offer diminishes with a reduction in\ngenetic relatedness. In addition, studies have also shown that kin members who are biologically\nunlikely to reproduce \u00ad thereby inhibiting the replication of the altruism gene \u00ad are less likely to\nreceive aid from kin members as opposed to their reproductively sound counterparts (Burnstein\nOther research into inclusive fitness theory has found that emotional closeness between\naltruist and recipient mediates the relationship between genetic relation and altruism\nmore likely to help friends (who tend to share high levels of emotional closeness) than genetic\nrelatives (e.g., siblings and cousins) when the cost of helping was low. In addition, further\nresearch found that people share higher levels of emotional closeness with their romantic\npartners than with their friends, and people were more likely to help their romantic partners than\ntheir friends regardless of the cost of altruism (Stewart-Williams, 2008). Interestingly though,\nStewart-Williams (2008) also found that people were emotionally closer with their romantic\npartners and friends than their siblings; however, when the cost of altruism was life-threatening,\nparticipants were more likely to help their siblings than their partners and friends \u00ad indicating\nthat genetic relatedness (i.e., the possibility of the recipient carrying the gene responsible for\nnepotistic altruism) is the most salient when the cost of altruism becomes life-threatening.\nGiven what we know about inclusive fitness theory, it is not surprising to find that people\nare more likely to help kin over non-kin in life-or-death situations. Nevertheless, the influence\nthat emotional closeness has on altruism cannot be ignored. The present study aims to examine\nthe effects of emotional closeness and genetic consequences by studying altruism between\nromantic partners who have biological children together. Romantic partners can share greater\nlevels of emotional closeness than siblings, cousins, and friends (Stewart-Williams, 2008), but\nthose with biological children have a common genetic interest (i.e., this offspring would have a\n50% (r = .5) chance of carrying each of its parents' nepotistic altruism alleles), so it is possible\nthat romantic partners who have a biological child together will be more likely to help each other\nin life-threatening situations than romantic partners who do not have a biological child together.\nBy the same logic, romantic partners who have a biological child together may also be more\nlikely to help each other in these situations than partners who have an adopted child together \u00ad\nseeing as how partners with adopted children (and no biological children) do not have the\ncommon genetic interest. Also, the influences from this shared genetic interest may be similar to\nthe influence from direct genetic relatedness (e.g., the drive one has to save a sibling \u00ad someone\nto whom the altruist is directly related). Thus, the present study is comparing the altruistic\ntendencies between romantic partners who have a biological child together, partners who have an\nadopted child together, partners who do not have children together, and siblings.\nDirect and Indirect Kinship Cues\nAs the literature has shown, altruistic tendencies toward one's kin can increase one's\noverall inclusive fitness, but how does one discriminate his/her kin from non-kin? Research on\nkin recognition has revealed several different types of cues that animals use to differentiate their\nkin from non-kin, as well as their genetically close kin from more distantly related kin (See Park,\nAltruism between romantic partners\nSchaller, and Van Vugt (2008) for a full review). These kinship cues may be presented through\nphenotypic matching (e.g., having similar facial features or body odors) which reflect a direct\ngenetic relationship between kin members (Apicella and Marlowe, 2004; Hauber and Sherman,\n2001; Lundstr\u00f6m, Boyle, Zatore, and Jones-Gotman, 2009; Platek, Burch, Panyavin, Wasserman,\nOther more indirect cues may also be used to detect kin. For instance, co-residence and\nclose spatial proximity have been shown to facilitate altruistic behavior (Anderson, Kaplan, and\nLancaster, 1999; Bressan, Colarelli, and Cavalieri, 2009) and decrease the likelihood of sexual\nbehavior between unrelated individuals (indicating the activation of an incest avoidance\nmechanism) (Walter and Buyske, 2003; Wolf, 1970). Although these indirect kinship cues may\nserve as successful kin recognition mechanisms, they are more subject to error and have little\nimpact when direct kinship cues are present (Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2007).\nUltimately, kin recognition is an extremely complex process comprised of several mechanisms.\nAs Park, Schaller, and Van Vugt (2008) wrote, \"this is because the evolution of increasingly\ncomplex psychological mechanisms has generally occurred by adding to \u00ad rather than replacing\n\u00ad existing mechanisms\" (p. 216).\nKinship cues, regardless of whether or not they are direct, facilitate higher levels of\naltruistic behavior (Webster, 2008). Yet it must be noted that this is not a direct causal\nrelationship \u00ad other factors can influence altruistic tendencies as well, such as psychological\naspects like emotional closeness (Korchmaros and Kenny, 2001; 2006). Although emotional\ncloseness may not be a kinship cue in and of itself, genetic relatedness is associated with feelings\nof emotional closeness (Korchmaros and Kenny, 2001) \u00ad indicating the complexity of kin\nrecognition and its role in generating nepotistic altruism.\nBoth genetic relatedness and emotional closeness influence altruism; however, these are\nfacilitators operating on two different levels of explanation. Genetic relatedness \u00ad represented by\ndirect kinship cues \u00ad operates at the ultimate level. Nepotistic altruism has been positively\nselected because it promotes the successful reproduction of the altruism allele. Emotional\ncloseness, on the other hand, is a proximate factor \u00ad helping people that one is emotionally close\nwith may not increase the probability of passing on the altruism allele (especially if the\nemotionally close people are unrelated), but other benefits can accrue from helping emotionally\nclose others (e.g., reciprocation, social acceptance, etc.).\nThis intricate relationship leads to a series of factors that may influence altruistic\nbehavior between kin and non-kin based on the presentation of direct and indirect kinship cues.\nFor instance, when examining the altruistic behavior between romantic partners with biological\nchildren, we cannot know if people's altruistic decision-making is being influenced by the\nbiological relationship to the child (showing that the child is presenting a direct kinship cue) or if\nthe presence of a child is merely acting as an indirect kinship cue \u00ad which can be prone to error.\nA potential altruist may view his/her romantic partner differently if they have a biological child\nas opposed to romantic partners who have a non-biological child (i.e., an adopted child). The\nbiological child may present direct kinship cues to his/her parents, causing these romantic\npartners to view each other as sharing the same vested genetic interests. This view may facilitate\na greater likelihood of altruism than romantic partners who do not have a child or have a child\nthat does not present direct kinship cues (i.e., an adopted child).\nIn order to tease out this possibility, the present study has focused on comparing\nhypothetical altruistic tendencies between romantic partners with no children, romantic partners\nwith biological children, and romantic partners who have adopted children but no biological\nAltruism between romantic partners\nchildren. Such a comparison should reveal whether it is the biological relationship to the child or\nmerely the presence of a child in general that influences altruism between partners. Thus, the\npresent study is also examining hypothetical altruistic tendencies between romantic partners who\nhave adopted a child (but do not have any biological children) and comparing them to the altruistic\ntendencies between siblings, romantic partners with no children, and romantic partners with\nbiological children.\nThe Effects of Paternity Uncertainty\nMothers invest much time and resources in their offspring, especially during the gestation\nperiod. Mothers also have complete maternal certainty. Thus, research has shown that mothers are\nmore likely than fathers to tend to the needs of their offspring, and have a greater interest in the\noffspring during the child's development (Babchuck, Hames, and Thompson, 1985; Taylor et al.,\n2000). Although not directly pertinent to the present study, one can see that if fathers are less likely\nthan mothers to expend resources to be altruistic toward their offspring, it would be reasonable to\nassume that fathers would also be less likely to expend resources (and their safety) to be altruistic\ntoward their offspring's mother as well.\nThere have also been several studies that have found that paternity uncertainty decreases the\nlikelihood of hypothetical altruistic intentions in many types of family members, including parents,\ncousins, aunts and uncles, and grandparents (Bishop, Meyer, Schmidt, and Gray, 2009; Daly and\nBuss, 2007); so it would seem as though females would be more likely than males to be altruistic\ntoward their partners with whom they share a biological child. Rescuing one's partner helps to ensure\nthat one's offspring will be cared for in the near future; however, because males face paternity\nuncertainty, they may be less likely to risk their lives to help someone with whom they may not share\na common genetic interest. In the case of adoptive parents \u00ad where both the mother and father\ncertainly know the child is not biologically theirs \u00ad paternity uncertainty should not produce a sex\ndifference in altruistic tendencies. Although adoptive parents may be less likely to help their\nromantic partners than biological parents in life-threatening scenarios, there should not be any\nsignificant difference in altruistic tendencies between adoptive parents.\nChanges in Perspective\nMany previous altruism studies have suffered from potential social desirability biases.\nFor instance, some studies have found inflated altruism ratings when asking people about their\nlikelihood of saving someone in a life-or-death situation (Fitzgerald and Colarelli, 2009; Stewart-\nWilliams, 2008). In other words, when a researcher asks a participant to indicate how willing\nthey believe they would be to risk their lives to help someone, the participant cannot give a 100%\naccurate response. Altruism research is asking about some high-stress situations (e.g., running\ninto a burning house to save a loved one), and it is quite improbable that one can give an accurate\nprediction of their behavior in non-existent high-stress situations, especially when they are\nsimply circling a number on a pencil-and-paper scale. It is also possible that people are much\nless heroic than they believe themselves to be.\nBecause it is highly impractical and unethical to place people in harm's way merely to\ninvestigate their altruistic behavior, the questionnaire method has served as a substitute \u00ad and a\nfairly accurate one (Stewart-Williams, 2007). However, the social desirability bias can influence\nalmost any explicit questionnaire study. Therefore, the present study has decided to examine this\nbias as its own variable. The questionnaire used in this study contains altruism items used in\ncountless previous studies (Burnstein et al., 1994; Cunningham, 1986; Essock-Vitale and\nAltruism between romantic partners\nbut not only have we presented these altruism items, we have also presented them with the\nperspective reversed. In other words, the eight items asking each participant about their altruistic\ntendencies toward their sibling or romantic partner are accompanied by a second set of these\neight items that ask each participant about their sibling's or partner's altruistic tendencies toward\nthe participant. It is possible that these reversed perspective items will fall subject to social\ndesirability bias as well, especially since previous research has found that people perceive\nthemselves as more ethical than others (Alicke, Klotz, Yurak, and Vredenburg, 1995; Hoorens,\n1993). Kruger (2003) used reverse perspective items and found that these were the strongest\npredictors of altruistic intentions. That data, combined with previous research associated with\nthe social desirability bias, leads us to hypothesize that perceived altruistic intentions by oneself\nwill be greater than the perceived altruistic intentions of others.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and Design\nParticipants consisted of 164 undergraduate and graduate students (59 male and 105\nfemale) at Central Michigan University (which consisted of all groups except for the adoptive\nwere biological parents. The average number of biological children was M = 2.5 (SD = .99). The\nadoptive parents were characterized as having adopted at least one child and not having any\nbiological children. The average number of adopted children was M = 2.4 (SD = .98). The\naverage age of the sample was M = 25.5 years (SD = 5.2). The average length of relationship was\nM = 3.1 years (SD = 1.3) for romantic partners with no children, M = 6.6 years (SD = 3.4) for\nromantic partners with biological children, and M = 9.6 years (SD = 2.8) for romantic partners\nwith adopted children.\nThe student participants were recruited online from a pool of undergraduate and graduate\npsychology students. The adoptive parents were recruited online from a listserv of adoptive\nparents registered with an adoption support website. Prior to recruiting from this website, the\nadministrator had given the experimenters permission to collect data from its members.\nThe study design consisted of a 4 (relationship category: partners with no children,\npartners with biological children, partners with adopted children, and siblings) x 3 (cost of\naltruism: low-, medium-, and high-cost) x 2 (sex of the participant) x 2 (sex of the target) x 2\n(perspective) mixed-design. Cost of altruism and perspective were within-subject variables while\nrelationship category, sex of the participant, and sex of the target were between-subject variables.\nStimulus Materials and Measures\nIn order to follow previous altruism research procedures, the items used in the present\nstudy mimic those that were used in Stewart-Williams's (2008) study on altruism between\nromantic partners, which was also derived from previous research (Burnstein et al., 1994;\n2003). There were three emotional closeness items and eight altruism items total. The three\nemotional closeness items stemmed from the two-item Subjective Closeness Index (SCI)\n(Berscheid, Snyder, and Omoto, 1989) and the one-item Inclusion of Other in Self Scale (IOS)\n(Aron, Aron, and Smollan, 1992). Responses for these items were recorded on a 7-point Likert-\ntype scale. The items yielded a high level of internal consistency ( = .88) and were therefore\naggregated to form the emotional closeness variable.\nAltruism between romantic partners\nThe questionnaire continued with two questions regarding how much low-cost help (e.g.,\nemotional support: advice, comfort when feeling sad) the participants had given the specific\nperson in the past 2 months. These items produced a high level of internal consistency ( = .84)\nand were aggregated to form the low-cost altruism variable. The next three questions pertained to\nthe amount of medium-cost help (e.g., errands, shopping, household chores) given in the past 2\nmonths, which also yielded high internal consistency ( = .86) and were averaged to create the\nmedium-cost altruism variable. Responses were recorded on a 9-point Likert-type scale (1 =\nnever and 9 = often). The final two items referred to hypothetical scenarios, asking the\nparticipants how willing they would be to help the specific person in life-or-death situations\n(e.g., donating a kidney, rescuing them from a burning house). Their responses were recorded on\na 9-point Likert-type scale (1 = not at all willing and 9 = extremely willing). These items\nproduced a reliable level of internal consistency ( = .75) and were averaged to create the high-\ncost altruism variable. All of the altruism questions were presented randomly in the\nquestionnaire.\nThe eight altruism items were also given within each questionnaire but with the\nperspective reversed. Each low- and medium-cost altruism question asked the participants how\noften their sibling or partner had helped them over the past two months while the high-cost\naltruism questions asked the participants to indicate how willing they believed their sibling or\nromantic partner would be to perform the life-threatening altruistic acts. These items also\nproduced high levels of internal consistency ( = .84 for low-cost,  = .83 for medium-cost, and\n = .79 for high-cost) and so were aggregated accordingly to produce the low-cost, medium-cost,\nand high-cost reversed perspective altruism variables. Responses were recorded on 9-point\nLikert-type scales in the same format as described above. These reversed perspective questions\nwere randomly presented throughout the questionnaire as well.\nThe questionnaire was created electronically using the website Survey Monkey\n(www.surveymonkey.com).\nProcedure\nAn electronic link to the questionnaire was e-mailed to participants after they had signed\nup for participation in the study online. Upon clicking the link, participants were directed to the\nquestionnaire. The first page of the questionnaire consisted of a consent form which disclosed\nthe purpose and content of the study. The participants had to click on a button which stated they\nread the consent form and agreed to participate in the study. After clicking the "
