However, it is unknown whether patients with dia-\nbetes have also experienced a decline in heart disease mortality.\nObjective To compare adults with diabetes with those without diabetes for time trends\nin mortality from all causes, heart disease, and ischemic heart disease.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Representative cohorts of subjects with and\nwithout diabetes were derived from the First National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ncohorts were followed up prospectively for mortality for an average of 8 to 9 years.\nMain Outcome Measure Changes in mortality rates per 1000 person-years for all\ncauses, heart disease, and ischemic heart disease for the 1982-1984 cohort compared\nResults For the 2 periods, nondiabetic men experienced a 36.4% decline in age-\nadjusted heart disease mortality compared with a 13.1% decline for diabetic men. Age-\nadjusted heart disease mortality declined 27% in nondiabetic women but increased\n23% in diabetic women. These patterns were also found for all-cause mortality and\nischemic heart disease mortality.\nConclusions The decline in heart disease mortality in the general US population has\nbeen attributed to reduction in cardiovascular risk factors and improvement in treat-\nment of heart disease. The smaller declines in mortality for diabetic subjects in the pres-\nent study indicate that these changes may have been less effective for people with\ndiabetes, particularly women.\nfined as not having diabetes.

The lower de-\nclinesforsubjectswithdiabetesoccurred\nfor all causes of death, heart disease, and\nischemic heart disease. However, confi-\ndence limits around the mortality rate\nchanges for subjects with diabetes were\nlarge and the magnitude of the changes\ncould not be determined precisely. In\ncontrast, there were large and statisti-\ncally significant declines in mortality for\nadultswithoutdiabetes,whichmirrorthe\nchanges in the general US population\nfound in other studies.1-4\nThe decline in coronary heart dis-\nease mortality in the US population has\nbeen attributed to improvement in risk\nfactors for heart disease and improve-\nment in medical treatment of patients\nhave resulted in decreased incidence of\nheart disease and increased survival of\npatients.Basedonthesestudies,thereare\nseveralpossiblereasonsthatsmallermor-\ntality declines among adults with diabe-\ntes compared with adults without dia-\nbetes may have occurred. First, risk\nfactors for mortality, particularly heart\ndisease risk factors, may have de-\ncreased less over time in those with dia-\nbetes. Second, the incidence of coro-\nnary heart disease, including the\nincidence of recurrent myocardial in-\nfarction, may have decreased less in\nFigure 4.

Although NHANES I and\nNHEFS do not have data to assess these\nfactors, there are extant cohort studies\nthat include subjects with diabetes that\ncould be investigated.\nTwo other recent studies examined\ntime trends in mortality for people with\ndiabetes.InRochester,Minn,10-yearsur-\nvival of patients with type 2 diabetes in\nMinnesota white population was stud-\nied.18 Formenwithdiabetes,survivalrela-\ntive to men without diabetes was simi-\ntheauthorsconcludedthattheimproved\nsurvivalexperiencedbythegeneralMin-\nnesotamalepopulationwasalsoexperi-\nencedbymenwithdiabetes.Theseresults\ndifferfromourfindingsthatmenwithdia-\nbetesinarepresentativesampleoftheUS\npopulationexperiencedlessreductionin\nall-causemortalitythanmenwithoutdia-\nbetes.ForwomenwithdiabetesinRoch-\nester, relative survival was lower for the\nplyingthatmortalityratesforwomenwith\ndiabetesinRochesterdecreasedlessthan\ntheratesforwomenwithoutdiabetes.Our\ndata indicate the same trend.\nThe other study of time trends in\ndiabetes mortality compared age-\nadjusted mortality rates in the Pima In-\njects both with and without diabetes ex-\nperienced small, nonsignificant de-\nclines in all-cause mortality; for women,\nsubjects both with and without diabe-\ntesexperiencedsmall,nonsignificantin-\ncreases in all-cause mortality.\nIn our study, there may have been\nwe could not measure that may have\naccounted for the lower declines in\nmortality for subjects with diabetes\ncompared with subjects without dia-\nbetes. In addition, the completeness\nand accuracy of listing of heart disease\nand ischemic heart disease on the\ndeath certificate may have changed\nduring the 2 cohort periods. However,\nthe fact that the percentage changes\nfrom cohort 1 to cohort 2 were similar\nwhen multiple causes of death were\nanalyzed indicates that this may not\nbe a major reason for the lower de-\nclines in mortality for those with dia-\nbetes. Coding of the underlying cause\nof death was not a factor because the\nsame procedure to select the underly-\ning cause of death was used for all\ndeaths in the study.\nOur study could not precisely dif-\nferentiate the types of diabetes, but\nthe adult age of the NHANES I cohort\nand the high proportion of type 2 dia-\nbetes in the US population with diabe-\ntes indicate that the results reflect\nmortality in type 2 patients.

Many changes\nhave caused the declines in death rates\nin the general US population. These\nchanges appear to have been less fa-\nvorable or less effective for people with\ndiabetes, particularly for women. With\nthe increasing prevalence of diabetes in\nthe United States22 and the smaller de-\ncline in mortality for these individu-\nals, we anticipate that diabetes may\nbecome an increasingly important fac-\ntor for heart disease mortality in the\nUnited States.\nREFERENCES\n1.
