While effective treat-\nments exist, little is known about the quality of care for\nthese disorders nationally. We estimated the rate of ap-\npropriate treatment among the US population with these\ndisorders, and the effect of insurance, provider type, and\nindividual characteristics on receipt of appropriate care.\nMethods: Data are from a cross-sectional telephone sur-\nsample. Respondents consisted of 1636 adults with a prob-\nable 12-month depressive or anxiety disorder as deter-\nmined by brief diagnostic interview. Appropriate treat-\nment was defined as present if the respondent had used\nmedication or counseling that was consistent with treat-\nment guidelines.\nResults: During a 1-year period, 83% of adults with a\nprobable depressive or anxiety disorder saw a health care\n30% received some appropriate treatment (95% CI,\n28%-33%). Most visited primary care providers only. Ap-\npropriate care was received by 19% in this group (95%\ntreatment was less likely for men and those who were\nblack, less educated, or younger than 30 or older than\nno effect on receipt of appropriate care.\nConclusions: It is possible to evaluate mental health care\nquality on a national basis. Most adults with a probable\ndepressive or anxiety disorder do not receive appropri-\nate care for their disorder. While this holds across di-\nverse groups, appropriate care is less common in cer-\ntain demographic subgroups.\ndisorders are common\nand have a substantial im-\npact on functioning and\nquality of life. National\ntreatment guidelines for major depres-\nsion document that effective treatments in-\nclude antidepressant medications and cog-\nnitive-behavioral and interpersonal\npsychotherapies.1-5 Research also sup-\nports the efficacy of these treatments for\ndysthymia, although the literature is less\nwell developed.5-9 In panic disorder, treat-\nment guidelines strongly support the ef-\nficacy of cognitive-behavioral psychothera-\npies, some antidepressant medications, and\nbenzodiazepines.10,11 In generalized anxi-\nety disorder (GAD), effective treatments\ninclude antidepressant medications, bu-\nspirone, benzodiazepines, cognitive-\nbehavioral psychotherapies, and prob-\nably relaxation and unstructured therapy\nments are effective, patients frequently do\nnot receive them.16 However, there have\nbeen few national studies of the quality of\nmental health care. Researchers have suc-\ncessfully characterized national quality of\ncare for a variety of medical disorders,17\nand it is important to know whether simi-\nlar research in psychiatry can provide data\nto inform policy nationally. While the ex-\nisting literature suggests that quality of care\nfor common psychiatric disorders is mod-\nerate to poor across different types of treat-\nment settings, national data are limited and\nnot clinically detailed, and it is unclear\nwhich populations are at greatest risk for\nnot receiving appropriate care.\nThe National Comorbidity Survey\n(NCS) surveyed a household probability\nsample of persons between ages 14 and 55\nyears, and found that 27.7% of those with\nmajor depression and 26.0% of those with\ndysthymia reported receiving outpatient\npanic disorder and 31.8% with GAD re-\nported receiving such services.

For example, a study of primary care prac-\njor depression received antidepressant medication during\na 6-month period,16 and studies in a variety of other health\ncare organizations have produced similar results.21-24 The\nrate of appropriate treatment for persons with anxiety dis-\nordermayalsobelow,buttherearefewpractice-basedstud-\nies. Even in mental health specialty settings, effective treat-\nments for anxiety disorders may be underutilized.25-28\nResearchers have found lower rates of mental health\ntreatment utilization in men,29 ethnic minorities,30 and\nindividuals with lower socioeconomic status.31 Also, black,\nyoung adult, and elderly individuals have been found to\nbe less likely to visit mental health specialists,32 and this\nmay affect which treatments are received.33 With regard\nto insurance, the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study\nfound that access to care was better under Medicaid than\nfor the uninsured or those with private insurance,34 and\nthe Medical Outcomes Study found that some aspects of\ntreatment were worse in prepaid care.16 However, these\nresults were based on coverage in the 1980s and few re-\ncent studies have identified predictors of receiving ap-\npropriate care among persons at risk for common psy-\nchiatric disorders.\nThis is a study of access to appropriate care among\na representative household sample of adults in the United\nStates who had a symptomatic depressive or anxiety dis-\ncus is on individuals with probable major depression, dys-\nthymia, panic disorder, and GAD. We examine whether\nthese individuals visit a health care provider, whether\nthose visiting a provider receive appropriate treatment,\nSAMPLE\nThe sample is from HealthCare for Communities (HCC),\nwhich is part of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's\nHealth Tracking Initiative.

The CTS was a nationally representative study\nof the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population during\npling strategy in HCC was designed to improve our ability\nto study people with low income and people with psychi-\natric disorders. This was done by oversampling individu-\nals with the following characteristics: family income be-\nlow $20000, high psychological distress (measured using\n2 items from the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey37), or\nany mental health specialty visit during the prior year. Of\nreinterviewed, for a response rate of 64%. Informed con-\nsent was obtained verbally before the interview. In analy-\nses, we weighted the data to be representative of the popu-\nlation of the United States by using CTS data to adjust for\nprobability of selection, unit nonresponse, and nontele-\nphone households.\nMEASURES\nData are from the HCC survey, with the exception of some\ninsurance information and demographics from the CTS sur-\nvey. Major depression, dysthymia, and GAD during the past\nyear and lifetime mania were assessed using short-form ver-\nsions of the Composite International Diagnostic Inter-\nview (CIDI),38 and are based on DSM-III-R criteria.39 Kessler\nand colleagues38 reported that the sensitivity and specific-\nity of CIDI short-form relative to full CIDI diagnosis is\nexcellent, with concordance ranging from 90% to 100%.\nProbable panic disorder was assessed using screening items\nfrom the CIDI,40 supplemented by additional items from\nthe full battery that were modified for this study. To re-\nduce potential false-positives on this instrument, for panic\nwe required limitation in social or role functioning using\n2 items from the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey and 3\nitems from the Sickness Impact Profile.41 Substance abuse\nwas assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identifica-\ntion Test42 and items adapted from the CIDI. Chronic psy-\nchosis was assessed by asking respondents whether they\nhad ever been told they had schizophrenia or schizoaffec-\ntive disorder, or been hospitalized because of psychotic\nsymptoms. Two hundred forty respondents met criteria for\nchronic psychosis or mania and were excluded from our\nanalyses. Respondents were also asked whether, during the\npast year, they had a need for emotional or mental health\nhelp, and whether they had any of the following severe life\ndifficulties: witnessing an assault, losing custody of chil-\ndren, or being homeless, sexually assaulted, incarcerated,\nor on parole or probation.\nUse of health services during the prior 12 months\nwas identified by self-report. Primary care provider (PCP)\nvisits included visits, for any reason, to a primary care\nphysician, family physician, general internist, nurse, phy-\nsician assistant, or chiropractor. Mental health specialist\nvisits included visits to a psychiatrist, psychologist, social\nworker, psychiatric nurse, or counselor, for \"emotional or\nmental health problems.\" Respondents provided daily\ndosage and duration of use for medications taken \"at least\nseveral times a week for a month or more,\" and reported\non the number of counseling sessions with specialists.\nCounseling from PCPs was identified by asking whether\nthe health care visit included at least 5 minutes of coun-\nseling regarding an \"emotional, mental health, alcohol or\ndrug problem.\"\nAppropriate care for depressive and anxiety disor-\nders was assessed for respondents with a probable disor-\nder, and was defined as use of either appropriate psycho-\ntropic medication or appropriate counseling during the prior\n\u00a92001 American Medical Association.

There were 139 respondents with panic disorder\nalone, 146 with GAD alone, and 29 with both anxiety dis-\norders. In total, 1636 respondents met criteria for 1 or\nmore depressive or anxiety disorders, and Table 1 pre-\nsents the characteristics of these individuals. Compared\nwith other persons, individuals with a depressive or anxi-\nety disorder were significantly more likely to be female,\nunmarried, unemployed, and to have problems with drugs\nor alcohol (P.0001, for each comparison). They also\nhad significantly fewer years of education, lower family\nincome, more life difficulties and chronic medical dis-\norders, and were more likely to have no medical insur-\nance (P.0001 for each comparison). While respon-\ndents provided information on medical insurance, they\nwere often unaware of their specific mental health ben-\nefits, and hence this could not be assessed.\nDuring a 1-year period, 80.8% of individuals with a prob-\nable anxiety or depressive disorder saw a PCP. While\n19.4% had seen a mental health specialist, only 1.9% saw\na specialist without seeing a PCP. Primary care provider\ncontact was most common with the anxiety disorders,\nand specialist contact was most common when both anxi-\nety and depressive disorders were present (Table 2). Al-\nthough provider visits were common, receipt of mental\nhealth treatment was not. Among individuals with a prob-\nable disorder, 25.6% received some antidepressant or anx-\niolytic medication, and 20.6% received appropriate medi-\nreceived appropriate counseling. In all, 30.4% received\nyear. Appropriate psychotropic medication was defined\nas a medication that was efficacious for the individual's\ndisorder and used at a dosage exceeding the minimum\nrecommended dosage for an adequate duration. Specifi-\ncally, for major depressive and dysthymic disorder (with\nor without anxiety), we used the lower end of the thera-\npeutic dosage range for each antidepressant medication\nfrom the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research\nGuideline for Depression in Primary Care, updated for\nnewer medications,1 and required 2 or more months of\nuse during the prior 12 months. Examples of minimum\ndosages are 10 mg per day for fluoxetine and 75 mg per\nday for desipramine. For panic disorder (with or without\nGAD), appropriateness criteria were based on proposed\nguidelines for general practitioners.10 Medication was\nappropriate if it included at least 2 months of an antide-\npressant medication (other than bupropion) at a possi-\nbly adequate dosage, or a benzodiazepine. For GAD,\nmedication was considered appropriate if it included at\nleast 2 months of an antidepressant medication at an\nadequate dosage, buspirone, or a benzodiazepine. For\nrespondents with multiple disorders, appropriateness\nwas evaluated for their most \"significant\" clinical disor-\nder, based on the following hierarchy (from 1 to 4, in\norder of consideration by PCP): major depression (1),\ndysthymia (2), panic disorder (3), and GAD (4). To\nillustrate the rationale behind this hierarchy, an indi-\nvidual with comorbid major depression and panic disor-\nder has appropriate treatment for both disorders if he or\nshe has any appropriate treatment for depression (eg, an\nantidepressant); however, certain treatments for panic\ndisorder (eg, a benzodiazepine alone without counsel-\ning) would not be sufficient.\nAppropriate counseling was defined as at least 4 vis-\nits with a mental health specialist or 4 visits with a PCP\nthat included counseling for mental health problems. A very\nsimilar counseling definition was used in the Medical Out-\ncomes Study, which found that appropriate counseling or\nmedication use was associated with improved 2-year func-\ntional outcomes in depression.43\nEstimateswerecalculatedusingSUDAANsoftware,44 andtake\ninto account the complex survey design and survey cluster-\ning.

Dependent variables were dichoto-\nmous, and indicated the presence of at least 1 service or ap-\npropriate care. Independent variables were the same in each\nmodel, and included age, sex, ethnic group, marital status,\nyears of education, income, number of chronic medical dis-\norders, and presence of a severe life difficulty or alcohol or\nother drug problem. Primary medical insurance was en-\ntered into the models as one of the following: private health\nmaintenance organization, other private insurance, Medi-\ncare, Medicaid, uninsured, or other/unknown. Physical and\nmental health functioning scores from the 12-Item Short-\nForm Health Survey were included in the models to control\nfor severity of illness. We calculated standardized predic-\ntions for variables in the models by computing the average\npredicted probabilities of obtaining quality care, controlling\nfor other covariates, within sample subgroups of interest.\nWe examined the sensitivity of our approach to changes\nin the methods used to identify appropriate treatment. To\ndo this, we developed alternative regression models that\nhad the same independent and dependent variables, but ex-\namined a somewhat different population. First, since our\nmain method could have included respondents with mild\nillnesses, we restricted the population identified as having\na disorder to individuals with a limitation in social or role\nfunctioning (as defined above). Second, since our main\nmethod may have missed individuals who did not meet re-\nquirements for illness during the past year because of suc-\ncessful treatment, we expanded the population identified\nas having a disorder to include all individuals taking anti-\ndepressant medication.\n\u00a92001 American Medical Association.

On\nthe other hand, receipt of appropriate care was strongly\ninfluenced by demographic factors and not by presence\nor type of insurance. As shown in Table 3, receipt of ap-\npropriate care was affected by the same factors in people\nwho had seen a provider as in the general population.\nSpecifically, the odds of receiving appropriate care var-\nied significantly by sex, ethnicity, age, and years of edu-\ncation, but not by income or insurance. The standard-\nized prediction of appropriate care was 33% for women,\nfor blacks. In terms of age, older and younger people were\nboth less likely to receive appropriate care.

When care is examined, the rate of access\nto appropriate treatment for depressive and anxiety dis-\norders is quite low, under 35% for the US adult popula-\ntion with a disorder, although closer to 50% for those with\nboth types of disorder.

Most\nhad been seen in primary care settings, making these\npromising locations for identifying individuals who could\nbenefit from treatment. While the chances of appropri-\nate care are much higher for individuals who have men-\ntal health specialist contact, these are probably individu-\nals who are more accepting of psychiatric diagnosis and\ntreatment. We found that persons not receiving appro-\npriate care were much less likely to think they needed\ntreatment for an emotional problem. Primary care pro-\nviders carry the burden of recognizing cases among pa-\ntients not presenting for psychological treatment, a task\nthat mental health specialists may not have to face.\nThe policy significance of our findings is enhanced\nby identification of individuals at highest risk for not re-\nceiving appropriate care for a depressive or anxiety dis-\norder. A large amount of the literature suggests that the\neffect of insurance on quality is inconsistent.46 We found\nthat insurance had a significant effect on whether an ill\nindividual would see a provider, but no effect on whether\nappropriate care would be received. In part, this may have\noccurred because most visits were in primary care, where\nthe rate of appropriate treatment was low. We were un-\nable to evaluate generosity of specific coverage for men-\ntal health services because people were too uncertain about\nthis aspect of their insurance. This is an important area\nfor further study. In any case, our findings suggest that\nquality problems exist across insurance types and the un-\ninsured. This is consistent with previous studies sug-\ngesting that simply providing insurance is unlikely to sub-\nstantially improve rates of appropriate care in people with\nmental health disorders.47 Rather, quality improvement\nprograms may need to be implemented within various\ntypes of insurance programs and in the public sector to\nenhance awareness and utilization of appropriate treat-\nment options.\nUnlike insurance, demographic factors had little ef-\nfect on whether an individual would see a provider, but\na large effect on whether appropriate care would be re-\nceived. For instance, despite the fact that blacks are as\nlikely as whites to see a provider, they are significantly\nless likely to receive appropriate care. This ethnic dis-\nparity in quality of care is similar to findings for a vari-\nety of other medical conditions.48 Overall, groups at very\nhigh risk include men, blacks, older adults, young adults,\nand people with less than a high school education. Our\nfindings are consistent with numerous studies showing\nthat women are much more likely than men to use out-\npatient mental health services.29 We also find that lower\nsocioeconomic status is strongly associated with not re-\nTable 3.

Our findings emphasize the sa-\nlience of the surgeon general's current efforts to redress\ndifferences in quality of care for major disease condi-\ntions based on socioeconomic or ethnic status differ-\nences, and suggest that major psychiatric conditions\nshould be considered for such an effort.\nAn encouraging finding was that when an antide-\npressant or anxiolytic medication is used, it is often used\nat a dosage and duration that may be effective. This sug-\ngests that the main problem is identifying those in need,\noffering them appropriate care, and helping them ac-\ncept this care. This represents a change from the 1980s,\nand may be because of the widespread availability of se-\nlective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications that are\nrelatively easy to use at an effective dosage. Indeed, we\nfound that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors now\naccount for 56% of all antidepressant medications used\nfor depression and anxiety, and are usually prescribed\nat an adequate dosage. For counseling, there was a greater\ndifference between using any counseling and receiving\nappropriate care, with less than half of those with any\ncounseling receiving at least 4 sessions. With benefits de-\nclining and behavioral managed care becoming more\nprevalent, it may be more difficult to obtain more than a\nfew visits, or there may be other barriers such as pa-\ntients not perceiving a need for ongoing counseling or\nexperiencing financial barriers, such as copayments.\nOne limitation of this study is that we used a brief di-\nagnosticscreeninginstrumenttoidentifypeoplewithaprob-\nable disorder. Indeed, brief measures are required when\nimplementingqualityassessmentinlargenationalsamples.\nA recent study compared a similar brief diagnostic assess-\nment with a structured, clinical assessment, and found that\nthe brief assessment was highly specific, though not very\nsensitive.49 Therefore, one would expect that most of the\npeople we identified had, in fact, a depressive or anxiety\ndisorder. Also, to examine the sensitivity of our approach\nto variation in severity of illness, we reran the model pre-\ndicting appropriate care after confining the population to\nthose with a functional limitation (n=1201). In the popu-\nlation with a depressive or anxiety disorder plus a func-\ntionallimitation,thepositivepredictivevalueofourscreen-\ners should be even higher (and need for treatment quite\ncertain).Theonlysubstantivedifferencebetweenthismodel\nand the main model was that that having a chronic medi-\ncal disorder was more strongly associated with receiving\nappropriate care. Finally, the Partners in Care Study50 ex-\namined persons who met screening criteria for probable\ndepressivedisorderbutdidnothavecurrentdisorderbased\non full diagnostic assessment, and found that their out-\ncomes improved with a quality improvement program.\nThus, rates of treatment among a broader at-risk sample\nare meaningful to practice policy.\nOur use of a cross-sectional strategy to select indi-\nviduals with a disorder means that we cannot distin-\nguish chronic refractory illness from incident condi-\ntions, or identify people who were successfully treated\nmore than a year before the interview, and had no symp-\ntoms for the past year because of continued treatment.\nTo examine the effect that this may have had, we ran sen-\nsitivity analyses in a population that in included people\nwith a depressive or anxiety disorder plus people who\nhad no disorder but were using antidepressant medica-\ntion. Using this alternative approach, the rate of appro-\ntors of appropriate care did not change.\nIt is noteworthy that we found low rates of appro-\npriate care, even though we used a generous definition\nof appropriate counseling, requiring only 4 professional\nvisits and only 5 minutes of discussion in a primary care\nvisit. We were unable to measure the content of coun-\nseling visits or to reliably identify specific forms of ef-\nfective treatments. Indeed, a criterion standard for de-\nfining effective counseling in the context of usual practice\ndoes not exist. Also, our reliance on self-report of ser-\nvice use could have led to underreporting or misreport-\ning of medication usage or counseling. However, our\nmodel was robust to variation in our assumptions, and\nour major findings were determined mostly by the pres-\nence of any potentially effective treatment. Also, the\nmethod we used to measure appropriateness is very simi-\nlar to that used in the Medical Outcomes Study,16,43 which\ndemonstrated that this definition of treatment appropri-\nateness affects outcomes.\nAnother potential limitation of this study is that the\naccuracy of the results may have been affected by the re-\nsponse rate, which is compounded by the initial re-\nsponse rate in CTS. We adjusted our findings statisti-\ncally for response using detailed CTS information on\nnonrespondents. While we cannot know the extent to\nwhich this adjustment was successful, features of our find-\nings are consistent with prior research. Compared with\nNCS, we found similar prevalence estimates for disor-\nders, similar rates of treatment utilization in anxiety, and\nmodestly higher rates of treatment utilization in depres-\nsion. In primary care, we found rates of mental health\ntreatment use that are similar to those reported by the\nMedical Outcomes Study using 1980s data.\nMany factors can contribute to why people who need\ncare do not receive it.51 These include, for instance, per-\nceived need, willingness to accept care, insurance cover-\nage, detection by providers, and knowledge and beliefs of\nproviders regarding effective treatment. Findings from this\nstudy support efforts to improve care through either pub-\nlic education or quality improvement interventions. Re-\ncent research suggests that while a majority of the public\nidentifies major depression as a mental illness, psychiatric\ndisorders continue to be strongly stigmatized.52 We found\nthat people not receiving appropriate care were much less\nlikely to have had their mental health problems evalu-\nated, and much less likely to believe they needed mental\nhealth treatment. Public and patient education efforts are\nneeded to increase the extent to which people value treat-\nment for common psychiatric disorders and demand ap-\npropriate care. Quality improvement efforts should focus\non strategies that bring effective treatments to people--\nwhether through improving practice infrastructure, en-\nhancing benefit design, or implementing outreach pro-\ngrams. Clinical research has made substantial progress in\nestablishing efficacious treatments, and progress must now\nproceed on dissemination to the public, especially for vul-\nnerable subpopulations.\n\u00a92001 American Medical Association.
