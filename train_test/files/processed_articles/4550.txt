Here we found that renin deficiency led to\ndecreased expression of sodium-hydrogen antiporter (NHE3), the Na+/H+ exchanger involved in Na+ absorption in the\nproximal tubules, but did not affect the expression of Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC2), the main transporter in the\nloop of Henle. In the distal nephron, the expression of sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) was lower in Ren-/- rats.\nSingle-channel patch clamp analysis detected decreased ENaC activity in Ren-/- rats which was mediated via changes in\nthe channel open probability.\nConclusion: These data illustrate that renin deficiency leads to significant dysregulation of ion transporters.\n",

Dahl salt-sensitive\n(SS) SS/JrHsdMcwi rats are extensively used to study the\nrole of salt consumption in the development of hyperten-\nsion. These rats, when kept on a high salt diet, exhibit\nremarkable phenotypic traits similar to those seen in the\nhypertensive African American population, including low\nrenin, salt-sensitivity, hyperinsulinemia, and early end\nstage renal disease.1\u00ad3\nPrevious studies have shown that introgression of chro-\nmosome 13 (Chr 13) from the Brown Norway (BN) rat into\nthe SS genetic background attenuates the development of\nhypertension in an SS-13BN consomic strain. While Chr 13\ncontains the renin gene, further studies, which narrowed the\nprotective loci in the SS-13BN rats against salt-sensitivity,\ndid not identify the renin gene in these regions.4\u00ad6 However,\na number of other studies demonstrated that genetic modi-\nfication of the renin locus does affect blood pressure.7\u00ad10\nRenal sodium transport in\nrenin-deficient\nDahl salt-sensitive rats\nTengis S Pavlov1*, Vladislav Levchenko1*, Daria V Ilatovskaya1,\nCarol Moreno1,3 and Alexander Staruschenko1,2\n Keywords\nRenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sodium-hydrogen antiporter, sodium chloride cotransporter, Na-K-Cl\ncotransporter, epithelial sodium channel, aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron\n1Department of Physiology, Medical College of Wisconsin, USA\n2Cardiovascular Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, USA\n3Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases, MedImmune, Cambridge, UK\n*These authors contributed equally.\nCorresponding author:\nAlexander Staruschenko, Department of Physiology, Medical College of\nEmail: staruschenko@mcw.edu\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nPreviously, we generated a renin knockout (Ren-/-) in the\nSS rat using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) designed to tar-\nget the renin gene.11 These rats have undetectable plasma\nrenin activity, underdeveloped kidneys as well as signifi-\ncantly lower mean arterial pressure than their Ren+/+ litter-\nmates. There was also evidence of decreased renal function,\nreflected by polyuria, reduced creatinine excretion and cre-\natinine clearance in Ren-/- rats.11\nRegulation of sodium balance by the kidney is the key\nfactor responsible for long-term blood pressure control.\nDahl SS rats demonstrate an impaired sodium excretion\nresponse to increases in renal perfusion pressure. This pre-\ndisposes them to developing hypertension when chal-\nlenged with a high salt diet.12 In the present study we\ndescribe the effects of renin deficiency on several key\nsodium transporters in various nephron segments.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals\nZFN-mediated renin gene knockout (Ren-/-) rats and their\nwild-type (Ren+/+) littermates were created11 and housed at\nthe Medical College of Wisconsin, and all work was con-\nducted under protocols approved by the Institutional\nAnimal Care and Use Committee. Male rats were fed 0.4%\nUSA). At the age of eight weeks, the rats were anesthe-\ntized with isoflurane, blood samples were collected from\nthe descending aorta, and the kidneys were flushed with\nphosphate buffer and used for further analysis.13\nPlasma aldosterone and corticosterone levels\nmin), and then plasma was analyzed with the Aldosterone\nand Corticosterone Active RIA kits (MP Biomedicals,\nOrangeburg, New York, USA).\nPatch-clamp analysis\nPatch-clamp electrophysiology was used to assess ENaC\nactivity in isolated, split-open rat connecting tubule/cor-\ntical collecting duct (CNT/CCD) segment. CNT/CCDs\nwere isolated from Ren-/- and Ren+/+ rats as described\npreviously.14,15 Kidneys were cut into thin slices (<1 mm)\nand then placed into ice-cold physiologic saline solution\n(pH 7.4). CNT/CCD regions were mechanically isolated\nfrom these slices under a stereomicroscope by micro-\ndissection with forceps. The tubules were split open with\nsharpened micropipettes controlled with micromanipula-\ntors to gain access to the apical membrane. Single-\nchannel recordings were acquired with Axopatch 200B or\n700B amplifiers (Mol. Devices, Sunnyvale, California,\nUSA) interfaced via a Digidata 1440A to a personal\ncomputers (PC) running the pClamp 10.2 suite software\n(Mol. Devices) and subsequently analyzed with Clampex\n10.2. Currents were filtered with an eight-pole, low pass\nBessel filter LPF-8 (Warner Inst., Hamden, Connecticut,\nUSA) at 0.3 kHz. A typical bath solution was used (in\nThe pipette solution for the cell attached configuration\n, the product of the number of channels and the\nopen probability (Po\n) were used to measure the channel\nactivity within a patch. When multiple channel events\nwere observed in a patch, the total number of functional\nchannels (N) in the patch was determined.\nWestern blot analysis\nKidney total lysate was prepared as described previously.15\nBriefly, kidneys were cut in 1\u00ad2 mm slices under a stere-\nomicroscope. Kidney cross-sections (~50 mg) were diced\ninto small pieces with a razor blade. Samples were pulse\nprotease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) for 10 s and spin cleared\njected to PAGE, subsequently transferred onto a nitrocel-\nlulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts,\nUSA), probed with antibodies, and visualized by enhanced\nchemiluminescence (Fisher Sci #32106). The visualization\nand densitometric analysis was done on the ChemiDoc\nXRS+ System with Image Lab Software containing a band\nsaturation control. Densities were normalized to the cor-\nresponding -actin intensities and then relative values\nwere averaged in groups. Primary antibodies for sodium-\nhydrogen antiporter (NHE3), -, - and -ENaC (SPC-\nwere from StressMarq Biosciences Inc. (Victoria, British\nColumbia, Canada);16 antibodies for sodium chloride\ncotransporter (NCC) were kindly provided by David H\nEllison (Oregon Health & Science University, Portland),17,18\nand Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) by Pablo Ortiz\nHistological and immunohistochemical analysis\nExtracted kidneys were placed into a neutral buffered 10%\nformalin solution. The kidney sections were cut at 4 m\nslices, dried, and deparaffinized for subsequent streptavi-\ndin-biotin immunohistochemistry. After deparaffinization,\nthe slides were treated with a citrate buffer pH6 for a total\nof 35 min. The slides were blocked with a peroxidase\nblock (DAKO, Carpinteria, California, USA),Avidin Block\n(Vector Labs, Burlingame, California, USA), Biotin Block\n(Vector Labs), and serum-free Protein Block (DAKO). For\nmorphological analysis, the tissue was stained with hema-\ntoxylin-eosin. For immunohistochemical staining, tissue\nsections were incubated for 30 min with anti-,  or -ENaC\nPavlov et al. 3\nantibodies. Secondary detection was performed with goat\nanti-rabbit biotinylated immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Biocare,\nConcord, California, USA) followed by streptavidin conju-\ngated with horseradish peroxidase (Biocare) and visualized\nwith diaminobenzadine (DAKO).\nStatistical analysis\nAll summarized data are reported as mean\u00b1standard error\nof the mean (SEM). Data are compared using one-way\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey correction and\np<0.05 is considered significant.\nResults\nKidney morphology, plasma aldosterone,\ncorticosterone, and electrolyte levels\nRen-/- rats were previously reported to differ from their\nRen+/+ littermates by having significantly lower body\nweights and kidney underdevelopment marked by dis-\nplaced medulla, incomplete formation of the medullary\nrays, and occurrence of large central lesions.11 Figures 1(a)\nand (b) confirm the presence of structural abnormalities in\nRen-/- kidneys, significant thinning of the medullar layer,\nand massive areas of undifferentiated tissue in the cortex.\nThe low-renin plasma activity and angiotensin I levels\nreported earlier11 are in accordance with our evaluation of\nthe plasma aldosterone concentration, which was found to\nbe significantly lower in Ren-/- rats (Figure 1(c)). Plasma\ncorticosterone level did not differ significantly between\nthe groups (Figure 1(d)).\nWestern blot analysis of renal sodium\ntransporters\nAbsolute sodium excretion and plasma Na+ concentration\nin Ren-/- rats did not differ from their Ren+/+ littermates.11\nHowever, the mutant animals demonstrated substantial\npolyuria (especially when considering their low weight).\nSeveral Na+ transporters expressed in the nephron\nmediate sodium absorption in the kidney: NHE3 and\nsodium-glucose transport protein (SGLT) in the proximal\ntubules, NKCC2 in the loop of Henle, NCC in the distal\nconvoluted tubules and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)\nin the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron, including late\npart of DCT, CNT and CCD.21 Figure 2 demonstrates\nWestern blot analysis of several of these transporters in the\nRen-/- rats and their wild type littermates. NHE3 expres-\nsion was lower in the Ren-/- group (Figure 2(a)) whereas\nthe expression of NKCC2 was not altered (Figure 2(b)).\nWe tested the consequences of renin deficiency on abun-\ndance of the thiazide-sensitive NaCl co-transporter, NCC,\nand found significantly lower expression of NCC in the\nmutant animals (Figure 2(c)).\nENaC abundance and activity measurements\nNormally, cortical ENaC performs only ~5% of sodium\nreabsorption. However, this widely regulated channel is\ninvolved in the fine tuning of sodium transport in the kid-\nney and is a key element in the antinatriuretic response to\naldosterone.16,22 Surprisingly, Western blot (Figure 3) and\nimmunohistochemical (Figure 4) analyses revealed that the\nexpression of all three ENaC subunits did not differ between\nFigure 1.

The only difference we noted was that expres-\nsion of a ~90 kDa band of -ENaC was significantly lower\nin Ren-/- animals (band 1; Figure 3). It should be noted,\nhowever, that we did not analyze the cleaved forms of -\nand -ENaC subunits, which play critical roles in the activ-\nity of the channel.23 To further test whether renin deficiency\naffects functions of ENaC, we performed single channel\nanalysis using the cell-attached configuration of the patch-\nclamp method. Figure 5(a) demonstrates representative\ncurrent traces recorded from the apical membranes of CCDs\nisolated from Ren+/+ and Ren-/- rats. We found that mutant\nrats exhibited significantly lower total ENaC activity (NPo\n)\ncompared to Ren+/+ littermates. The average number of\nchannels observed in each experiment (N) did not signifi-\ncantly vary between groups, but the lower NPo\nin the Ren-/-\nanimals was caused by changes in the open probability of\nindividual channels (Po\n) (Figure 5(b)). Therefore, these\ndata allow us to conclude that absence of renin decreases\nthe activity of ENaC by alteration of gating properties but\nnot expression of the channel.\nDiscussion\nThe role of the RAAS components in the management of\nsodium reabsorption and excretion is still not fully under-\nstood. SS rats are a low renin strain, and high salt con-\nsumption decreases plasma renin activity even further,24\u00ad26\nyet SS hypertension is accompanied with activation of the\nmized SS rats do not develop hypertension on a high salt\ndiet, whereas exogenous aldosterone supplement reverses\nthis phenomenon.28 Renin knockout failed to concentrate\nurine and have lower plasma angiotensin I11 and aldoster-\none levels. Angiotensin II and aldosterone were described\nas positive regulators of several channels and transporters\nOur goal was to investigate functions of major sodium\ntransport proteins along the nephron in the condition of\nrenin deficiency and the lack of aldosterone in the system.\nWe found that NKCC2 abundance did not change in mutant\ncompared to wild type animals whereas the other tested\nsodium transporters exhibited reduced functions. Thus,\nNHE3 abundance as well as NCC expression was lower\nin the mutant animals. RAAS is a potent regulator of\nsodium reabsorption in the distal segments of the nephron.\nAldosterone stimulates thiazide-sensitive sodium reab-\nsorption, an effect accompanied with an increase in\nNCC abundance.32\u00ad34 It was previously reported that salt\nrestriction leads to increased plasma renin activity, aldos-\nterone levels, and NCC abundance.35 Angiotensin II posi-\ntive regulation of NCC functions was also described.36\u00ad39\nFigure 2.

We did not find significant differences in\nENaC abundance between the groups, but Western blot-\nting revealed diminished presence of a ~90 kDa form\n-ENaC subunit in the Ren-/- rats. Previously Ergonul and\ncolleagues demonstrated that maturation of ENaC was\naccompanied with glycosylation of the -subunit, which\nmight play a role in current conditions.40 We further utilized\nthe patch-clamp approach to perform a functional assay and\nfound that ENaC activity in the Ren-/- isolated CCDs was\nlower due to decreased open probability of the channel.\nRecent studies also identified that kidney-specific min-\neralocorticoid receptor (MR) knockout mice exhibited salt\nwasting, low BP, and hyperkalemia.18 It was reported that\nknockout of MR in the kidney resulted in deficient apical\norientation and cleavage of ENaC. NCC and pNCC abun-\ndances were also substantially reduced in the kidney-\nspecific MR-/- mice. Plasma K+ was elevated in the MR-/-\nmice. The authors concluded that the effects on NCC were\nsecondary to the changes in plasma K+ since dietary K+\nrestriction of kidney-specific MR-/- mice maintained the\nabundance of pNCC at a level similar to or greater than\ncontrol.18 This mechanism may be important in the Ren-/-\nrats since it was previously shown that serum potassium\nwas significantly increased in Ren-/- rats.41 The authors\nalso demonstrated in vitro that the corticosterone basal lev-\nels and production by zona reticularis/fasciculata cells in\nresponse to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was\nunaffected in the Ren-/- rat compared with the Ren+/+ con-\ntrols. Our in vivo experiments accordingly revealed equal\nplasma levels of corticosterone in Ren-/- and Ren+/+ litter-\nmates. We assume that the Ren-/- strain of Dahl SS rats can\nbe considered a model of isolated hypoaldosteronism but\nfurther studies are needed to test this hypothesis.\nThe Ren-/- rat strain is a very exciting model which\ndelineates the role of local intrarenal processes when sys-\ntemic RAAS activity is low. For instance, recent studies\nusing this model defined basal and cAMP-stimulated\naldosterone production in the zona glomerulosa cells.41\nFurther characterization of sodium balance in these ani-\nmals is required as we hypothesize that low systemic\nRAAS activity is the cause of very low blood pressure\n"
