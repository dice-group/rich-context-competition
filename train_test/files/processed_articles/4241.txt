Locally advanced or\nstage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is\nthe most advanced stage at which cure may be\nachieved. Whether the disease is treated by sur-\ngery or chemoradiotherapy is determined based\non tumor pathology and the presence of tumor\nextension and lymph node invasion. For patients\nwith resectable NSCLC, randomized trials have\nshown that treating the disease with the combina-\ntion of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy\nand surgery improves survival compared with sur-\ngery alone.1\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy can theoretically\nreduce tumor volumes and control micrometa-\nstatic diffusion, which may eventually improve\ntumor resectability.\nLung cancers are supplied primarily by the bron-\nchial artery,2 as well as by the subclavian artery.\nCompared with conventional intravenous chemo-\ntherapy, bronchial arterial infusion (BAI) chemo-\ntherapy increases the local concentrations of\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy by bronchial\narterial infusion in patients with\nunresectable stage III squamous cell lung\ncancer\nJun Zhu, Hai-ping Zhang, Sen Jiang and Jian Ni\n Keywords: bronchial arterial infusion, chemotherapy, neoadjuvant, squamous cell carcinoma,\nunresectable\nCorrespondence to:\nJian Ni\nDepartment of Oncology,\nShanghai Pulmonary\nHospital, Tongji University\nSchool of Medicine,\nJun Zhu\nHai-ping Zhang\nDepartment of Oncology,\nShanghai Pulmonary\nHospital, Tongji University\nSchool of Medicine,\nSen Jiang\nDepartment of Radiology,\nShanghai Pulmonary\nHospital, Tongji University\nSchool of Medicine,\nShanghai, China.\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 11(8)\n302 journals.sagepub.com/home/tar\nchemotherapeutic agents by delivering these\ndrugs directly into lung cancer tissues via the\nbronchial artery, making maximum reductions in\ntumor size possible and thus increasing the treat-\nment options available for patients with NSCLC.\nIn this study, we administered neoadjuvant BAI\nchemotherapy to stage III lung squamous cell car-\ncinoma (SCC) patients whose tumors were\ndeemed unresectable by their surgeons before\ntreatment and investigated whether these patients'\ntumors were resectable after BAI. Treatment side\neffects, survival, and the patients' quality of life\nwere also assessed.\nMaterials and methods\nPatient population\nA total of 39 patients with unresectable stage III\nSCC who may have been able to undergo radical\nresection after two cycles of BAI chemotherapy\nand who were treated in Shanghai Pulmonary\nHospital, Tongji University School of Medicine\nenrolled in this study. This study was approved\nby the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Pulmonary\nHospital, Tongji University School of Medicine\nhad signed informed consent (informed consent\nof study FK1210). All the patients underwent\nthoracic computed tomography angiography\n(CTA) prior to beginning chemotherapy. The\npatients also underwent additional routine pre-\ntreatment evaluations such as abdominal ultra-\nsonography or computed tomography (CT),\nbrain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or head\nCT, cardiopulmonary function testing and whole-\nbody radionuclide bone scans. The patients were\nstaged in accordance with the seventh edition of\nthe TNM classification system.\nThe following patients were included in the\nstudy: patients who were treatment na\u00efve; patients\nwith an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group\nPerformance Status (ECOG PS) score 0\u00ad2;\npatients with an ability to tolerate BAI chemo-\ntherapy; patients with pathologically or cytologi-\ncally confirmed stage IIIa or IIIb SCC; patients\ndeemed to have unresectable disease at the time\nof diagnosis because their tumor exhibited bulky\nlymph nodes on the ipsilateral side of the medi-\nastinum (N2) disease (as determined by endo-\nbronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial\nneedle aspiration biopsy, n = 3; or by CT, in\nwhich the tumor was found to have a short-axis\ndiameter >1.5 cm, n = 1) or vital organ invasion;\npatients with normal blood test results, as well as\npatients with normal liver and kidney function,\nnormal ECG results, and normal blood gas analy-\nsis results; patients with measurable solid lung\nlesion(s) (as demonstrated by lung radiographic\nimaging) that could be used to assess treatment\nefficacy; and patients expected to survive more\nthan 6 months.\nA total of 39 patients were enrolled in this study\n(sample size justification: because this was a ret-\nrospective study, the sample size was based on the\nnumber of incoming patients that met the inclu-\nsion criteria. As it took longer to identify patients\nwho met the eligibility requirements, 39 patients\nenrolled in this study). Three of them were\nexcluded because of pre-existing heart disease or\nan inability to complete chemotherapy. Thus, 36\npatients were eligible for the study, whose popu-\nlation comprised one female and 35 males with\npatients had stage IIIa disease, and 11 patients\nhad stage IIIb disease (Table 1).\nTreatment regimen\nThe chemotherapy treatment regimen, which\nconsisted of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP), was\nadministered in accordance with the following\nand intravenous infusion on day 8) and cisplatin\n(75 mg/m2 BAI on day 1 and intravenous infusion\non day 2) every 3 weeks. Each patient was sched-\nuled to receive two cycles of BAI chemotherapy,\nafter which treatment efficacy was evaluated to\ndetermine whether the patient should undergo\nsurgery or continue receiving chemotherapy or\nradiotherapy.\nBAI chemotherapy was administered under local\nanesthesia. Femoral artery catheterization was\nperformed using a modified Seldinger percutane-\nous technique. After successful selective bronchial\nartery intubation and bronchial arteriography, the\nchemotherapy drugs were slowly injected.\nFollow up\nTreatment-related side effects and ECOG PS\nscores were recorded during chemotherapy. After\ntwo cycles of chemotherapy, chest CT, brain MRI,\nJ Zhu, H-p Zhang et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 303\nan isotope bone scan and an abdominal ultrasound\nwere performed, and treatment efficacy was\ndefined based patient responsiveness and disease\nstatus according to the Response Evaluation\nCriteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) scale, which is\ncategorized as follows: complete response (CR):\ndisappearance of all target lesions, any pathological\nlymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must\nhave reduction in short axis to <10 mm; partial\nresponse (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum\nof diameters of target lesions, taking as reference\nthe baseline sum diameters; stable disease (SD):\nneither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor\nsufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease\n(PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diame-\nters while on study; and PD: at least a 20% increase\nin the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as\nreference the smallest sum on study (this includes\nthe baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In\naddition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum\nmust also demonstrate an absolute increase of at\nleast 5 mm (note: the appearance of one or more\nnew lesions is also considered progression). Based\non patient outcomes, the downstage rate, surgery\nrate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall\nsurvival (OS), and ECOG PS were determined,\nand treatment toxicity was documented.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used for the baseline\nclinical characteristics. Enumeration data were\ndescribed by percentage or rate. OS was defined\nfrom the day of diagnosis to the day of death\nfrom any cause, and PFS was defined from the\nday of diagnosis to the day of progression or\ndeath. Kaplan\u00adMeier estimates were used to\nobtain the median survival time and the corre-\nsponding 95% confidence interval (CI). All sta-\ntistical analyses were conducted using SPSS\nsoftware for Windows (version 21.0, SPSS Inc.,\nUnited States of America).\nResults\nBronchial arterial infusion response rate and\ntreatment follow up\nA total of 36 patients were enrolled in this study.\nThe post-BAI chemotherapy response evaluation\nTable 1.

Three patients (8.3%) displayed PD\n(with local progression). The response rate was\n72.2%. BAI chemotherapy attenuated vascular\ninvasion, shrank lymph nodes and resulted in\neight patients' (22.2%) diseases being down-\nstaged. Sixteen (44.4%) patients were down-\nstaged with respect to their T stage, and five\n(13.9%) patients were downstaged with respect\nto their N stage.

In contrast, one (2.8%) patient displayed\nworsening symptoms. These results demonstrate\nthat BAI chemotherapy significantly improved\npatient quality of life.\nSafety\nIn general, the toxicity and side effects of BAI\nchemotherapy were mild (Table 4), and no grade\nIV toxic effects were observed. The most com-\nmon side effects were grade I leukopenia (6/36,\none patient experienced grade III leukopenia,\nneutropenia, and nausea. The overall incidence\nof side effects was low, and BAI chemotherapy\nwas well tolerated. Neither BAI-related bleeding\nepisodes or deaths nor BAI-related paraplegia\nwas noted.\nDiscussion\nBecause metastasis of adenocarcinomas is more\ncommon,3 subsequent treatments using small\nmolecular-targeted drugs could be implemented,4\nand the drug for SCC was less and the drug for\nSCC was less than for adenocarcinoma; in this\nTable 2.

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy could\nbe used in stage III lung cancer, but in the Arrieta\net al.5 study, only 21.1% of the patients under-\nwent surgery after concurrent chemoradiother-\napy. Considering which treatment caused\nradioactive pneumonia and mortality, we chose\nthe BAI as a preoperative induction method,\nanticipating the increased probability of surgery.\nThe regimen consisting of GP is a standard com-\nbination used for the treatment of SCC6,7 and\nhas a longer PFS than other cytotoxic platinum\nregimens. Thus, we used GP as the BAI chemo-\ntherapy regimen in this study.\nBAI chemotherapy significantly prolonged PFS\nand OS in patients with stage III lung SCC. An\nOS of at least 25 months is clinically significant.\nPless et al.8 showed that the PFS was 11.6\nmonths, and the OS was 26.2 months in patients\nwith stage IIIa lung cancer (no patients with\nstage IIIb lung cancer were enrolled in the study)\nafter neoadjuvant chemotherapy, results similar\nto those of our study.\nof a clinical trial which compared concurrent\nchemoradiotherapy with chemotherapy along\nbefore surgery in patients with pathologically con-\nfirmed N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer)\ndisplayed a 21% of downstage rate in cases in\nwhich induction chemotherapy was administered\nto NSCLC patients with N2 invasion. In our\nstudy, the downstage rate was 22.2% after two\ncycles of BAI chemotherapy. Specifically, 16\n(44.4%) patients were downstaged with respect\nto their T stage and five (13.9%) patients were\ndownstaged with respect to their N stage. Thus,\nto have unresectable or marginally resectable dis-\nease underwent complete resections. The surgery\nrate in our study was 52.8%, a rate much higher\nthan those of other neoadjuvant treatment stud-\nies. At the end of the 5-year follow-up period, 11\npatients had SD, and 13 patients were alive. In\nKocher et al.'s study,10 the surgery rate was 34%\nfor patients with unresectable stage IIIa and IIIb\nlung cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy\nand radiotherapy. Notably, BAI chemotherapy\nresulted in more T-stage downstaging than\nN-stage downstaging, suggesting that T4 disease\nwith tumor extension into vital organs or blood\nvessel involvement may be an indication for neo-\nadjuvant BAI chemotherapy.\nTable 4. Toxicity in all patients (n = 36).\nToxicities Number of patients\nTherapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 11(8)\n308 journals.sagepub.com/home/tar\nPless et al.11 showed that radiotherapy did not\nenhance the benefits of induction chemotherapy\nfollowed by surgery, so we did not use BAI chem-\notherapy followed by radiotherapy in our study.\nDuring chemotherapy with BAI, blood vessels\nsupplying the tumor must be precisely located,12\nas blood vessel location is a prerequisite for effec-\ntive BAI treatment. Nakanishi13 conducted a\nstudy involving patients with stage III\u00adIV NSCLC\nwho were unable to tolerate conventional chemo-\ntherapy. Those authors found the PFS was 6.5\nmonths and the OS was 17.4 months after BAI\nchemotherapy. Those survival times were shorter\nthan the PFS and OS of our study because that\nstudy enrolled patients with stage IV disease. Our\nstudy demonstrated that all the patients who dis-\nplayed significantly prolonged OS were those who\nwere referred for surgery after BAI and those who\nunderwent radical tumor resection, indicating that\nsurgery played a vital role in extending OS. Hence,\nwe believe that an important consideration with\nrespect to BAI chemotherapy is whether the ther-\napy will improve a patient's chances of being able\nto undergo surgery. We advise against administer-\ning simple BAI chemotherapy in patients with\nstage IV lung cancer because tumor shrinkage\nalone had little effect on survival in these patients.\nWang et al.14 showed that BAI plus hyperfraction-\nated radiotherapy was effective for the treatment\nof advanced cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy after\nsurgery is effective, but radiotherapy does not\nincrease the efficacy of this treatment.15\nAmong patients who underwent BAI chemother-\napy, their quality of life was improved and 58.3%\nof patients showed improvement in their ECOG\nPS score, a change related to significant tumor\nshrinkage. Symptoms induced by local tumor\ncompression and other systemic symptoms\n(including symptoms induced by tumor-related\nsuperior vena cava, recurrent laryngeal nerve, tra-\nchea, and heart compression) also subsequently\nimproved. BAI chemotherapy even showed effi-\ncacy in the treatment of metastatic lung tumors.16\nHowever, as is the case with other types of chemo-\ntherapy, BAI chemotherapy also resulted in wors-\nening symptoms in some patients (2.8%), although\nsymptom worsening associated with BAI occurred\nless often than symptom worsening associated\nwith conventional intravenous chemotherapy.\nBAI chemotherapy was well tolerated. None of the\npatients in this study required suspensions or\ndelays of their BAI chemotherapy because of treat-\nment side effects, and no grade IV toxicity was\nobserved. These findings are probably attributable\nto the fact that the local concentrations of chemo-\ntherapy drugs, that is, the concentrations of chem-\notherapy drugs in the tumor, were high, which\nresulted in reduced systemic concentrations of the\ndrugs. Nakanishi et al.17 also showed that patients\nwith advanced NSCLC who were unable to toler-\nate intravenous chemotherapy may tolerate BAI\nchemotherapy. Furthermore, advances in surgical\ntechniques have reduced the incidence of surgical\ncomplications after BAI chemotherapy. No BAI-\nrelated side effects were noted in this study. All\npatients underwent CTA before beginning BAI to\nensure that they experienced the best possible\ntreatment outcome. Paraplegia is considered a\nsevere side effect of BAI. However, because much\nattention was devoted to the position of the cathe-\nter, there were no cases of paraplegia in our study.\nTherefore, adequate preoperative preparation and\nexperienced operators can improve the efficacy\nand safety of the BAI procedure. If other cancer\ncenters also have much experience of chemother-\napy, and interventional departments employ oper-\nators who are experienced with selective bronchial\nartery intubation and bronchial arteriography,\nthen BAI can be performed reliably.\nThis study revealed that BAI chemotherapy sig-\nnificantly increased the surgery rate, prolonged\nPFS and OS, and improved quality of life in\npatients with unresectable stage III lung SCC\ncompared with intravenous neoadjuvant chemo-\ntherapy in the same group of patients. BAI\nresulted in more T-stage downstaging than\nN-stage downstaging, suggesting that we must\nchoose more suitable patients when considering\nBAI chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment.\nHowever, further research is needed to investi-\ngate whether BAI chemotherapy is as effective as\nneoadjuvant therapy with respect to NSCLC\ntreatment. The role of radiotherapy in neoadju-\nvant therapy is still unclear. NSCLC patients can\nusually tolerate the toxicity of BAI combined with\nother treatments, such as radiotherapy.18 The\neffect of the combination of radiotherapy and\nBAI chemotherapy must also be studied further.\nIn addition, the sample size in our study was\nsmall, in part because BAI chemotherapy requires\na specific route of administration and is more\nexpensive than conventional intravenous chemo-\ntherapy. Studies with a larger sample size and\nlonger follow-up period are needed for the per-\nformance of a better efficacy evaluation and to\nJ Zhu, H-p Zhang et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 309\ndetermine the survival benefits offered by BAI\nchemotherapy.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Shanghai\nMunicipal Science and Technology Commission\nConflict of interest statement\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nReferences\n1.
