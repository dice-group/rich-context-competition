Sherman1\n Keywords\nsituations, Fundamental Motives Framework, scale validation\nIntroduction\nEvery day people find themselves in a number of different\ncontexts or situations, which provide both opportunities and\nobstacles or affordances (Gibson, 1979; McArthur & Baron,\ngoals. For example, spending an evening at a bar can provide\nan opportunity to relax, to spend time with one's romantic\npartner, and to enjoy oneself. The situation can also include\nobstacles to achieving those goals in the form of another bar\npatron flirting with your romantic partner. Despite decades of\nresearch purporting the power of the situation as a determinant\nresearch identifying the psychological properties of situations\nor HEXACO models of personality psychology, there is no\nconsensus as to a common set of characteristics (i.e., a taxon-\nomy) that researchers can and should use to measure the wide\nvariety of situations humans encounter (Hogan, 2009; Reis,\nThis is not to suggest that researchers have not tried to\nremedy this issue. Several efforts have been made to identify\nsituation taxonomies using empirical approaches (Rauthmann\nMiller, 2006). The application of the lexical hypothesis, the\nnotion that meaningful differences will be encoded in lan-\nguage, to situations has been met with mixed results. In an\nearly study, Van Heck (1984) searched Dutch dictionaries for\nwords relevant to situational features. A subsequent cluster\nanalysis suggested 10 types of situations such as ``intimacy,''\n``recreation,'' and ``interpersonal conflict'' (Van Heck, 1984).\nMore recently, Edwards and Templeton (2005) asked univer-\nsity students to rate a set of dictionary words that completed the\nphrases, ``That situation was ____.'' and ``That was a ____\nsituation.'' Their factor analysis revealed four types of situa-\ntions--positivity, negativity, goal achievement, and socializa-\ntion (Edwards & Templeton, 2005). Yet another lexically\noriented approach used Chinese idioms as a basis for a situation\n1 Department of Psychology, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA\n2 Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa\nCity, IA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nNicolas A.

Interestingly, a cluster analysis\nof these idioms revealed two dimensions of situations as initi-\nating or constraining goals (Yang et al., 2006), aligning with\nthe notion of situations as affordances for goal achievement.\nIndeed, this same group of researchers later suggested that\nsituations be conceptualized in terms of the goals a person is\nattempting to achieve (Yang, Read, & Miller, 2009).\nAn alternative empirical approach for conceptualizing\nsituations is to consider what basic situational features allow\nfor the expression of personality characteristics. One such\nmeasure, the Riverside Situational Q-sort (RSQ; Sherman\nalong these lines. Most recently, Rauthmann and colleagues\n(2014) factor analyzed the RSQ across several diverse sam-\nples (e.g., community members and different cultures) and\nidentified eight dimensions of situations, provisionally\nnamed DIAMONDS. These include, duty (whether a task\nneeds to be accomplished), mating (the presence of potential\nromantic partners), and sociality (the potential to commu-\nnicate with others and/or to form close relationships) to\nname a few.\nTheoretically Derived Situation Taxonomies\nAs an alternative to such empirical efforts to identify and quan-\ntify meaningful features of situations, one might begin with a\ntheory that offers a set of specific predictions about how situa-\ntions may be related to individual's cognitions, emotions,\nand behavior. Perhaps the most prominent example to date\nusing this approach is the Atlas Of Interpersonal Situations\n(H. Kelley et al., 2003). This taxonomy uses six dimensions\nidentified by interdependence theory (H. H. Kelley & Thibaut,\nmon situations encountered in ordinary social life'' (Reis, 2008,\np. 317). The situation taxonomy provided by interdepen-\ndence theory is grounded in social exchange theories and,\nas such, is useful for understanding behavior in social\nexchange situations. The Fundamental Motive Framework\n(Kenrick, Griskevicius, Neuberg, & Schaller, 2010), on the\nother hand, offers a more distal perspective--grounded in\nhuman evolution--that is useful for explaining behavior\noriented toward goals relevant to recurrent adaptive problems.\nThus, a situation taxonomy grounded in the fundamental\nmotives framework ought to be useful for understanding beha-\nvior in situations that promote or prevent the achievement of\ngoals with relevance for fitness.\nA Taxonomy of Situations Based on Evolutionary Theory\nOver our species' history, humans have faced a number of\nrecurrent adaptive problems, including avoiding disease, pro-\ntecting oneself, forming groups and allies, gaining status,\nattracting and retaining mates, and caring for one's kin. These\nare adaptive problems in the sense that people who caught\ndiseases were grievously injured, did not form successful alli-\nances with others, were of low status, failed to mate, lost their\nmate, or did not invest in kin, were at a fitness disadvantage\nrelative to others who more successfully navigated these obsta-\ncles, and thus were less likely to pass on their genes. Kenrick\nKenrick, Griskevicius, et al., 2010; Kenrick, Neuberg, Griske-\nvicius, Becker, & Schaller, 2010) posit that these recurrent\nadaptive problems shaped human motivation, and the ensuing\nmotives are therefore fundamental. In other words, people\nhave at least seven core social motivations or goals: self-\nprotection, disease avoidance, affiliation,1 status, mate seek-\ning, mate retention, and kin care. Indeed, it has been argued\nthat such adaptive problems ``define situations'' (Buss, 2009,\np. 241). Because these goals are shaped to help an individual\naddress the recurrent adaptive problems of social life, it stands\nto reason that modern humans bring this psychological\nendowment to the perception and navigation of social situa-\ntions today.\nSituational Affordances for Adaptive\nProblems\nA number of laboratory experiments have shown that (some-\ntimes subtle) situation changes (or manipulations) to temporar-\nily activate each of the fundamental motives lead to\npredictable, motive-consistent, changes in thought and beha-\nvior (e.g., Griskevicius et al., 2009; Griskevicius, Tybur, &\nRouby, & Miller, 2007). However, no concise instrument pre-\nsently exists that can measure situational affordances for these\nseven goals in everyday situations.\nResearchers have attempted to use existing situation mea-\nsures to tap the fundamental motives in situations. A recent\nstudy demonstrated that the RSQ can be used to indirectly\nassess the extent to which situations are relevant to the funda-\nmental motives (Morse, Neel, Todd, & Funder, In press). How-\never, their results indicated that the RSQ may lack content\ncoverage in the domains of disease avoidance (i.e., only a\nsingle item seems relevant at face value) and kin care (i.e.,\nno items in the RSQ refer to helping one's family members).\nThis is perhaps unsurprising because the RSQ was not designed\nto measure the presence of pathogens or to distinguish between\nwho (specifically) is receiving help. Furthermore, the full RSQ\nwhich may not be feasible to administer in many research\nendeavors.\nIf researchers seek to quantify the motive-relevant affor-\ndances of situations and thus bring the study of these situations\nto life domains beyond the laboratory, a concise and easily\nadministered measure provides an essential tool. The present\nresearch is designed to fill this void through the development of\nthe Situational Affordances for Adaptive Problems (SAAP). In\nthis article, we discuss the development of the SAAP in both a\ncommunity (Study 1) and a college sample (Study 2), in addi-\ntion to psychometric properties such as reliability (Study 3);\ndiscriminant validity (Study 4); and convergent, incremental,\nand predictive validity (Studies 3 and 4).\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nStudy 1: Item Creation and Scale\nDevelopment\nPurpose\nStudy 1 was designed to accomplish two goals. First, it was our\nintent to create a pool of items that could ostensibly measure the\ncharacteristics of situations that might promote or prevent\nachievement of the seven goals just mentioned. We used\nKenrick and colleagues' (2003) operational definitions of the\nseven goals as a guide in generating items for the SAAP. We\nalso considered prior research, which indicates that several of the\ngoals contain lower order subfactors (Neel, Kenrick, White, &\nNeuberg, In press). To guide participants to rate their immediate\ncontext, and not perform a global assessment of their general\ndaily life, item phrases were written with the stem ``In this\nsituation . . . '' (e.g., ``In this situation . . . .sharing with others\nis important''). After refining and rewording, our initial measure\nconsisted of 85 items (available in Supplemental materials).\nBecause the item content of this measure intentionally\nincluded semantic similarity and because of a desire to develop\na shorter measure of these seven broad constructs, our second\ngoal was to empirically reduce the initial 85-item set to a\n28-item version, with 4 items for each construct. We chose\n4 items in an effort to balance adequate internal consistency,\nscale length, and goal affordance content coverage. To do so,\nwe asked an adult Internet sample to recall and describe a recent\nsituation they experienced and then to rate that situation using\nthe initial 85-item measure. A number of exploratory factor\nanalyses were then used to identify the best 4 items per motive\nthat could comprise a reduced 28-item version of our measure.\nParticipants\nSample size selection. Ineachofthestudies,weaimedtogatherdata\nfrom N \u00bc 200 participants because this provides a 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) for a Fisher's transformed r of approximately +.14,\nwhich is an acceptable level of precision in our view. Past experi-\nence with these populations suggests a 10% exclusion rate,2 thus\nwe gathered data from 220 participants in each study.\nTwo hundred and twenty participants were recruited from\nAmazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT). Twenty-one participants\nwere excluded prior to analyses because they wrote descrip-\ntions that included more than one situation (e.g., ``I was doing\nmy daily running outside and followed it up with a quick\nshower and then went to bed.''). The final sample comprised\nThe ethnic breakdown for the sample was 80% Caucasian, 6%\nAfrican American, 5.5% Asian, 5.5% Hispanic/Latino/Latina,\nand 3% Other. Participants were compensated US$0.50 for\ncompleting the study. The study was approved by the institu-\ntional review board (IRB) at Florida Atlantic University.\nMeasures and Procedure\nParticipants responded to the posting of a human intelligence\ntask (HIT) on the AMT website, which was only viewable to\nindividuals with an IP address in the United States (for a\nfurther explanation of AMT for psychological research, see\nBuhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011).3 After completing a\nbrief demographics questionnaire, participants were instructed\nto recall a situation they experienced the previous day at the\nsame time they were taking the survey (24-hr prior). Partici-\npants were prompted to recall specific details of the situation\nwith the following instructions: ``Please include: (1) what you\nwere doing, (2) where you were, and (3) who was with you.''\nThe instructions requested participants recall only one situation.\nTo that end, we provided a hypothetical response (``I got home\nfrom school, went shopping with my mom, and then had\ndinner'') and provided instructions to write only about one thing\nthey were doing (``I was shopping at the mall with my mom'').\nWe also instructed participants that if they were sleeping at the\nindicated time, they should write down what they were doing\nright before they went to sleep or right after they woke up.\nParticipants rated their situation on the 85-item version of\nthe SAAP using a 5-point Likert-type scale to rate each item\nfrom 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Items were\npresented in a random order for each participant.\nAnalytic Strategies\nAs mentioned previously, the aim of one study was to reduce\nthe 85 items to a 28-item measure (4 per construct) that both\nrepresented the content of the seven goals' affordances and\nyielded reliable composite scores. In doing so, we employed\nthree different analytic strategies.\nOne-factor solutions. One method of identifying items with the\nbest 4 items for each goal was to calculate the first unrotated\nprincipal component for each subset of items intended to pro-\nmote or prevent the same goals. Based on the resulting unrotated\npattern matrix, we selected the four highest loading items. This\nstrategy maximizes internal consistency (i.e., coefficient a), so\nlong as the items consist of one construct, while potentially\nsacrificing breadth in item content (e.g., a bloated specific).\nFour-factor solutions. To identify items that could best maximize\ncontent breadth, we again grouped the items by goal, but this\ntime extracted four principal components using a varimax rota-\ntion and retained the highest loading item from each compo-\nnent. This strategy resulted in the lowest possible reliability, so\nlong as the items consist of one construct, while maximizing\nitem content coverage.\nPart-whole solutions. Using the part-whole function available in\nthe ``multicon'' package (Sherman, 2015) in R (R Development\nCore Team, 2015), we computed all of the possible 4-item\ncombinations for each subset of items, created their respective\ncomposites, and correlated them with the full-scale total score\nusing all of the items (i.e., all possible part-whole correlations).\nWe then selected the 4-item combination that correlated the\nhighest with the full scale. This approach was designed to\nidentify the 4 items that could best represent the full scale,\nwithout particularly focusing on reliability or content coverage.\nBrown et al. 3\nResults\nThe 4-item sets, coefficient a, and correlation with the entire\nscale for these three analytic strategies are available in the\nSupplemental materials. We first evaluated the 4-item sets for\neach situation domain based on their internal consistency and\ncorrelation with the total scale. We dropped the four-factor\nsolutions from consideration because they did not appreciably\nincrease content coverage. Additionally, although we had\nwritten items to measure subfacets of the affiliation and\nmate-seeking constructs (e.g., Neel et al., In press), exploratory\nfactor analyses demonstrated that these items cross loaded on\nmore than one factor. These items were subsequently dropped\nfrom further consideration.\nBecause the one-factor solutions produced sets of items that\ncovered nonoverlapping content, we used these solutions for all\nseven motives. The resulting 28-item measure is presented in\nthe Appendix. Table 1 presents the intercorrelations, reliabil-\nities, means, and standard deviations (SDs) for each of the\nrespective composites for the final measure. The means for\nmales and females for each factor did not vary in a consistent\npattern (in this sample and in the subsequent samples) and are\nthus not considered further. To explore the adequacy of our\n28-item set, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis using\nthe ``Lavaan'' package (Rosseel, 2012) in R with full informa-\ntion maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation.4 Three fit indices\nwere calculated to evaluate our model fit: root mean square\nerror of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI),\nand the Tucker\u00adLewis index (TLI). All three indicated ade-\nfit indices should only be considered descriptive as this model\nfit was based on the results of exploratory procedures on the\nsame data set. Thus, we attempted to confirm this factor struc-\nture in Study 2.\nStudy 2: Confirming Factor Structure\nPurpose\nFollowing the exploratory analyses of the Study 1, we sought to\nobtain an additional sample to confirm the factor structure of\nthe SAAP. Additionally, to examine convergent validity of the\nSAAP, participants completed a measure of the psychological\nproperties of situations, the RSQ (Wagerman & Funder, 2009).\nHowever, to save room and reduce overlap with results from a\nlater study examining convergent validity (Study 3), we do not\nreport convergent correlations with the RSQ here (also avail-\nable in Supplemental materials).\nParticipants\nTwo hundred undergraduate participants from Florida Atlantic\nUniversity were recruited through fliers posted in the psychol-\nogy department. Eleven participants were excluded from anal-\nyses: 10 participants wrote descriptions that included more than\n1 situation. One participant completed the study twice, and his\nor her additional data were not included in the final analyses.\nTwenty-five participants were missing data on some measures.\nTherefore, the sample sizes vary depending on the specific\nanalysis. The final sample comprises 119 females, 69 males,\nand 1 who did not indicate. The mean age was 18.74 years\n(SD \u00bc 1.88), with an ethnicity breakdown of 51% Caucasian,\nOther, 3% Asian, and 1% no response. Participants were com-\npensated with partial course credit. The study was approved by\nthe Institutional Review Board at Florida Atlantic University.\nMeasures\nSAAP. The 85-item version of the SAAP administered to parti-\ncipants in Study 1 was used in this study. As in Study 1, parti-\ncipants used a 5-point Likert-type scale to rate each item from\n1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Items were pre-\nsented in a random order for each participant.\nProcedure\nParticipants came to the lab and completed all parts of the study\nusing computerized survey software. The procedure for the first\npart of Study 1 parallels that of the Pilot Study. Namely, after\ncompleting a demographics questionnaire, participants were\nasked to recall a situation they experienced the previous day\nat the same time they were taking the survey (24 hr prior).\nTable 1.

Because many of the latent\nfactors are correlated to some degree (e.g., mate seeking and\nmate retention) and there is no theoretical rationale suggesting\nthey should be orthogonal, we allowed all of the latent factors\nto covary in our model. We again calculated the RMSEA, CFI,\nand TLI fit indices to evaluate model fit. All three indicated\nDiscussion\nThe goal of Study 2 was to confirm the factor structure of the\nmeasure identified in Study 1. Using three different fit indices,\nwe found that the factor structure fits adequately in a less\nheterogeneous sample (e.g., young university students). While\nthe obtained internal consistencies for the seven factors were\nalso adequate, coefficient a is not always the best indicator of\nreliability (McCrae, Kurtz, Yamagata, & Terracciano, 2011).\nStudy 3 was designed to examine other psychometric proper-\nties such as test\u00adretest stabilities, convergent, incremental, and\npredictive validity.\nStudy 3: Examining Test\u00adRetest Reliability\nand Convergent Validity\nPurpose\nThe objective of Study 3 was three-fold. First, both Study 1 and\nStudy 2 showed that the internal consistencies of the seven-\nfactor composites were acceptable. However, a more relevant\nindicator of reliability is the stability of scores obtained from\nratings separated by time (McCrae et al., 2011). This study\nexamines the test\u00adretest reliabilities of the SAAP over the\ncourse of approximately 1 week. Second, this study evaluates\nthe convergent validity of the SAAP with another measure of\nsituations, the S8* (Rauthmann & Sherman, In press). The S8*\nis an optimized measure of the aforementioned DIAMONDS\nsituation characteristics recovered from the RSQ by Rauth-\nmann and colleagues (2014). Finally, this study examines the\nconvergent and incremental predictive validity of the SAAP in\npredicting behaviors related to the seven goal-affordance\nmotives.\nParticipants\nTime 1 Sample. Two hundred and twenty participants were\nrecruited from AMT. Twenty-three participants were excluded\nprior to analyses: 15 participants who did not pass the survey's\nvalidity checks6 (e.g., marking 5 to an item that asked partici-\npants to mark 1) were excluded. Five participants wrote\ndescriptions that included more than one situation, and one\nparticipant completed the S8* but not the SAAP. Furthermore,\nthe random time selection software malfunctioned for two par-\nticipants. Because participants were given the option to not\nrespond to any particular survey item, sample sizes vary\ndepending on the specific analysis. The final sample comprised\nCaucasian, 10% Asian, 9% African American, 5% Hispanic/\nLatino/Latina, and 3% Other. Participants were compensated\nUS$0.75 for completing the first part of the study. The study\nwas approved by the Institutional Review Board at Florida\nAtlantic University.\nTime 2 Sample. All two hundred and twenty participants in the\nTime 1 sample were invited to participate in the Time 2 sample.\nOf these, 188 (85%) completed the second part of the study.\nTwenty-two participants were excluded prior to analyses:\n15 participants who did not pass the survey's validity checks\n(at both Time 1 and Time 2) were excluded and four partici-\npants wrote descriptions at Time 1 that included more than one\nsituation. The two participants for whom the random time\nselection software malfunctioned and one who did not com-\nplete the SAAP at Time 1 were also excluded from these anal-\nyses. In line with the survey procedures at Time 1, participants\nwere given the option to not respond to any particular survey\nitem, thus sample sizes vary depending on the specific analysis.\nThe final sample for Time 2 (i.e., participants that had valid\ndata for both time points) comprised 79 males and 87 females.\nbreakdown for the sample was 73% Caucasian, 8% African\nAmerican, 5% Hispanic/Latino/Latina, 10% Asian, and 4%\nOther. Participants were compensated an additional US$0.75\nfor completing the second part of the study.\nMeasures\nS8*. The S8* (Rauthmann & Sherman, In press) is an optimized\n24-item measure of the psychological properties of situations\nrepresented by the ``Situational Eight'' DIAMONDS (see\nRauthmann et al., 2014). Sample items include ``A job needs\nto be done,'' ``It is possible to deceive someone,'' and ``Close\npersonal relationships are important or can develop.''\nBrown et al. 5\nParticipants used a 7-point Likert-type scale to rate each item\nfrom 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\nBehavior Checklist. To examine the predictive validity of the\nSAAP, we generated a list of behaviors thought to be relevant\nto each of the respective SAAP domains (see Table 2 for the\n56 items). For example, self-protection behaviors included\nitems such as, ``I defended myself,'' ``I protected myself from\nphysical danger,'' and ``I felt concerned for my physical\nsafety.'' Participants indicated using a yes/no format whether\nthey did or did not engage in each of the 56 behaviors. The\nitems were presented in a random order.\nProcedure\nTime 1. As in Study 1, participants responded to the posting of a\nHIT on the AMT website, which was only viewable to individ-\nuals with an IP address in the United States. The procedures for\nthis study were similar to that of Study 2, with only two mod-\nifications. First, participants in this study indicated when they\nwent to bed and when they woke up on the prior day. Then,\nspecially designed software calculated the hours that the parti-\ncipant was awake the prior day and randomly selected one time\ninterval. All times were in 15-min intervals (e.g., 9:15 a.m.,\n9:30 a.m., and 9:45 a.m.). Participants were prompted to recall\ntheir situation at this randomly selected time with modified\ninstructions, specifically, ``Please include: (1) where did it\ntake place? (2) who was with you? (3) what were you doing?\n(4) what was happening? what took place?'' Participants were\nprovided with the same instructions regarding reporting only\none situation (see Study 2 Method). Participants rated their\nsituation using the 28-item SAAP identified in Study 1 and\nconfirmed in Study 2 in addition to the S8*.\nTime 2. Participants were e-mailed approximately 1 week after\ntheir participation in Time 1 and invited to participate in the\nsecond part of the study. An average of 8.51 days (SD \u00bc 1.03)\nelapsed between Time 1 and Time 2 participation. After return-\ning to the survey website, participants were presented with the\nsame situation they wrote during Time 1 and again asked to rate\nthat same situation using the SAAP. It is essential that partici-\npants rated the same situation they rated the prior week so that\ntest\u00adretest reliability could be examined. Participants also indi-\ncated whether they engaged in any behaviors related to the\nseven goals with the behavior checklist.\nResults\nTest\u00adRetest Reliabilities\nTo address our first objective, evaluating the test\u00adretest reli-\nabilities of the SAAP, we first created composites of the\nparticipants' Time 1 and Time 2 scale ratings, respectively.\nThe internal consistencies ranged from .78 (disease avoidance\nat Time 1) to .97 (mate retention at Time 2). Next, we corre-\nlated the Time 1 and Time 2 scale scores. The descriptive\nstatistics are presented in Table 3. The test\u00adretest reliabilities\nTable 3). Overall, these test\u00adretest reliabilities are quite good,\nespecially considering the brevity (4 items) of the measures.7\nConvergent and Discriminant Validity\nTo address our second objective, evaluating the convergent and\ndiscriminant validity of the SAAP, we compared its validities\nto those from ratings of the S8*. To reiterate, the S8* is an\noptimized measure of the ``Situation Eight'' DIAMONDS,\nwhich is an empirically derived taxonomy of situations that\ntaps eight major psychological characteristics of situations\nsuch as duty, mating, and sociality. Participants' composite\nscores on the DIAMONDS were correlated with the SAAP\nscores from Time 1. These correlations appear in Table 4.\nAlthough the SAAP correlated modestly with many of the\nDIAMONDS scales, there were, unsurprisingly, stronger asso-\nciations between scales that shared overlapping content (e.g.,\nmate seeking of the SAAP and the mating dimension of DIA-\nMONDS). However, it is of note that there were weaker asso-\nciations between kin care and all of the DIAMONDS factors.\nThis is ostensibly due to the fact that the DIAMONDS taxon-\nomy of situations does not measure goals or psychological\ncharacteristics of situations that involve taking care of one's\nfamily.\nPredictive and Incremental Validity\nFinally, to address our objective of examining the predictive\nvalidity of the SAAP over an existing measure of situations, we\nfirst correlated participants' Time 2 SAAP scores with the\n56 goal-related behaviors, see Table 2. In general, participants\nengaged in behaviors that were consistent with their perception\nof the goals operating within the situation. For example, parti-\ncipants who scored high on the SAAP mate-seeking scale\ntended to endorse items such as, ``I pursued a romantic\nor sexual opportunity'' (r \u00bc .48), ``I flirted with someone''\n(r \u00bc .52), and ``I felt attracted to someone'' (r \u00bc .46).\nNext, to demonstrate the incremental validity of the SAAP,\nwe conducted hierarchical linear regressions. In the first step,\nwe predicted each individual behavior checklist item from each\nof the Time 2 DIAMONDS scores. We also made a note of the\noverall model fit (R) for each regression. Next, as a mid-step,\nwe calculated semipartial correlations (see Table 5) to estimate\nthe degree to which the SAAP scales are uniquely related to the\nbehaviors after controlling for the DIAMONDS and the other\nSAAP dimensions. Finally, as the second step in the hierarch-\nical regression, we added both the SAAP and the DIAMONDS\nas predictors of each behavior. We retained the model fit\n(R) for each of these models and calculated the change in\nmodel fit (reported as R in Table 5). As evidenced by the\nmultiple-R changes in Table 5, the SAAP is still able to\npredict the goal-relevant behaviors even controlling for the\nDIAMONDS. This is particularly evident for SAAP\ndomains such as kin care, which is not well captured by the\nDIAMONDS taxonomy.\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nTable 2. Means and Correlations Between Behavior Checklist and Time 2 SAAP (Study 3).\nDomain/Item Mean SP DA AF ST MS MR KC\nSelf-protection\nDisease avoidance\nAffiliation\nStatus\nMate seeking\nMate retention\n(continued)\nBrown et al. 7\nDiscussion\nStudy 3 demonstrated both test\u00adretest stability, convergent, and\nincremental validity of the SAAP. First, when two SAAP ratings\nof the same situation were obtained across approximately a\nweek, scores were moderately stable. Second, while the SAAP\ncorrelated with many of the DIAMONDS scales, one SAAP\ndomain--kin care--was only modestly associated. This is\nunsurprising primarily because the DIAMONDS taxonomy is\nderived from a situation taxonomy (the RSQ) that was not devel-\noped to measure these situation characteristics. Thus, although\nthe Situational Eight DIAMONDS (and its predecessor, the\nRSQ) may serve as a proxy for some of the SAAP domains\n(e.g., Morse et al., In press), it is evident that some content\ncoverage is lacking from a fundamental motives perspective.\nStudy 4: Convergent and Discriminant\nValidity\nPurpose\nStudy 3 provided initial evidence for convergent and incre-\nmental validity of the SAAP. The purpose of Study 4 was to\nprovide further evidence of convergent and discriminant\nvalidity of the SAAP using stimuli designed to prime the\nseven fundamental motives. Prior research has used short\nstories (approximately 600 words in length) specifically\ndesigned to prime a fundamental motive of interest (e.g.,\net al., 2007). For example, Griskevicius and colleagues\n(2009) primed mate seeking with a short story about encoun-\ntering and spending time with an attractive member of the\nopposite sex. Thus, when asked to rate a situation reflected\nin the priming story, raters should be especially sensitive to\nthe items relevant to that fundamental domain. For example,\nparticipants should rate the SAAP mate seeking items high,\nand all other items low, for the mate seeking story from Gris-\nkevicius and colleagues' (2009) experiment.\nProcedure and Materials\nTen naive research assistants8 (6 males and 4 females), unac-\nquainted with the purpose of the present study, were instructed\nto read short stories designed to prime one of the seven funda-\nmental motives, respectively.9 To reiterate, the short stories\nrated employed here have been used in prior experimental\nresearch (e.g., Griskevicius et al., 2009). The research assis-\ntants then rated the short story using the 28-item SAAP using a\n5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to\n5 (strongly agree). This procedure was repeated for each of the\nstories.\nResults\nTo examine whether the SAAP is sensitive to these experimen-\ntal primes, we aggregated the ratings across research assistants\n(after first forming composites for each rater). Figure 1 visually\ndisplays the means for each motive priming story. The standard\nerrors for these means were small, which indicates that the\nmeans are quite stable.10\nTable 2.

Indeed, the aggregate SAAP scores indicate\nthat raters consistently judged the stories as eliciting the primed\nmotive well over the midpoint of the scale. Similarly, these\nratings provide evidence of discriminant validity of the SAAP.\nWhen raters rated a situation within one specific priming sti-\nmulus, they did not rate other unrelated motives as being rel-\nevant.11 For example, when kin care was primed, no other\nmotive was rated higher than 2.5. This is important because\nit suggests that the SAAP factors can accurately assess each\nrespective fundamental motive.\nDiscussion\nStudy 4 provided evidence of convergent and discriminant\nvalidity of the 28-item SAAP using stimuli designed to prime\nthe fundamental motives. Most importantly, this measure\nappears to capture situational characteristics that might induce\nthe fundamental motives theorized by Kenrick and colleagues\n(2003; Kenrick, Neuberg, Griskevicius, Becker, & Schaller,\n2010). Because the SAAP is designed to measure evolutiona-\nrily important goals of situations, it is essential to demonstrate\nthat the SAAP can capture the situation characteristics that\nmight make these motives salient and indeed they do. Study\n4 also provides evidence for the discriminant validity of the\nSAAP in that raters indicated low situational affordances for\nmotives that were not primed.\nGeneral Discussion\nHuman behavior is sensitive to moment-to-moment circum-\nstances (i.e., situations). Decades of research have been\ndevoted to the task of identifying the essential psychological\ncharacteristics of situations (e.g., Block & Block, 1981;\nrevive situation research (e.g., Reis, 2008), and the develop-\nment of new instruments for measuring the psychologically\nimportant characteristics of situations (e.g., Rauthmann &\nSherman, In press; Sherman et al., 2010), more work needs\nto be done in this arena to better identify the most basic features\nWhile a small, but growing, body of research has focused on\nempirical routes for deriving the basic features of situations\net al., 2006), little research on situations has been guided by\ntheory (cf. H. Kelley et al., 2003). Using evolutionary psychol-\nNeuberg, Griskevicius, Becker, & Schaller, 2010), the present\nstudies provide a substantial contribution to the literature on\nsituations by developing a theoretically guided measure of situa-\ntions, the SAAP. This is a crucial endeavor for several reasons.\nFirst, this research advances our knowledge of situations\nfrom an evolutionary perspective. Using the Fundamental\nMotives Framework, the SAAP offers a means of measuring\nsituational characteristics that facilitate or threaten adaptively\nrelevant social goals. The second is more pragmatic. When\nsomeone is being physically attacked, nearly everyone would\nagree--the law included--that it is reasonable to defend one-\nself by any means necessary. What is unacceptable, however, is\naggression that results in the death of an innocent person when\nno imminent threat existed. Are some people more prone to\nperceive situations as necessitating more self-protection than\nthey actually warrant? Additional studies could investigate this\npossibility by designing paradigms that require participants to\nrate ambiguous situations using the SAAP. Thus, the SAAP\nmay be helpful in elucidating stable differences in construal\nof situations (cf. Serfass & Sherman, 2013). The third reason\nfor development of the SAAP is that it allows us to test pre-\ndictions derived from an evolutionary perspective in real-world\nsituations. Much of the research stemming from the fundamen-\ntal motives framework has thus far been limited to laboratory\nexperiments. Understanding how actual situations experienced\nin real life impact thought, behavior, and emotion requires\ntools for assessing and quantifying the characteristics of such\nsituations. The SAAP allows one to measure day-to-day or\nmoment-to-moment changes in situations' perceived relevance\nto adaptively relevant social problems.\nTable 5.

Indeed,\nthe scale means were often below 3 (i.e., the scale midpoint),\nalthough, in most instances, the means for the subscales never\nfell below 2 (with the exception of mate seeking in Studies 1\nand 3). However, the low means do not, and did not in this\ncase, preclude (a) meaningful variance in the scales and (b)\nassociations with theoretically relevant behaviors. This is\nmost evidenced in Study 3, where all scales of the SAAP\nshowed strong associations with relevant outcomes. Further-\nmore, just because a kind of situation (e.g., self-protection) is\nrare does not mean that it would not have a substantial impact\non an organism's fitness or require precise attunement and\ncoordination of the organism's response. Indeed, people\nlikely possess mechanisms for responding to particular adap-\ntive problems that, while only deployed in rare circumstances,\nare nonetheless consequential for fitness (e.g., encountering\ndangerous conspecifics). These points notwithstanding, we\ncaution readers from interpreting the means for the scale\nreported here as population norms for these scales and rec-\nommend that local norms be used until such population norms\nmay be established.\nReaders may likewise be concerned that the correlations\namong these subscales are moderately high. For example,\nacross the three studies, mate seeking and mate retention as\nwell as status and affiliation were strongly related to each other.\nHowever, the fundamental motives framework (Kenrick et al.,\n2003; Kenrick, Neuberg, Griskevicius, Becker, & Schaller,\n2010) does not posit that these motives are orthogonal. More\nimportantly, when all of the SAAP scales were simultane-\nously allowed to predict outcomes (see Study 3), they still\nprovided predictive validity in a theoretically meaningful\nfashion. Thus, although the scales of the SAAP are correlated\nwith each other, they are clearly not so highly correlated as to\nbe considered identical.\nBecause situations cannot rate themselves (Rauthmann,\nSherman, & Funder, In press), there may also be concern that\nratings of situations on the SAAP items assess an individuals'\npersonality as much as their perception of the situational char-\nacteristics. Of course, self-reports of situations are colored by\nan individual's unique perception, or construal, of the situation\n(Rauthmann, Sherman, Nave, & Funder, In press; Serfass &\nthe empirical evidence to date indicates that people readily\nagree about what situations are like and the amount of construal\nin a single situation rating is quite small (Rauthmann, 2012;\nWe also note that, across these three studies, there were no\nconsistent gender differences in the means for each factor of\nthe SAAP. For example, based on traditional gender roles\nregarding women caring for children, it might be expected\nthat women would be more likely than men to perceive that\ntheir kin needing help. Indeed, we did find mean-level dif-\nferences in the experience of kin care for men and women,\nbut this difference was of moderate size and was not statis-\ntically significant. The lack of consistent differences across\nthe seven factors might be due to a methodological limitation\n(e.g., only 69 men vs. 119 women in Study 2). Alternatively,\nas an anonymous reviewer noted, it is possible that men and\nwomen share many of the same adaptive problems measured\nat this level. Future research should continue to explore these\npossibilities.\nFinally, this initial sample was North American. It will be\nimportant to extend this examination of adaptively relevant\nsituations to a more culturally and ecologically diverse sample.\nIndeed, tools such as the SAAP may help us to understand the\nextent to which people in different cultures encounter different\nadaptively relevant social situations and to examine those eco-\nlogical factors that may account for differences between and\nwithin populations in the prevalence and construal of these\nsituations. Nonetheless, the SAAP is designed to measure\naffordances for adaptive problems facing all humans and, as\nsuch, we suspect that non-North American populations should\nhave similar factor structures and properties. Finally, the sam-\nple for two of the studies (Studies 1 and 3) were recruited\nonline using AMT. Although the population of participants\non AMT is typically considered quite diverse in terms of demo-\ngraphic variables (e.g., age, gender, and ethnicity), there may\nsomething unique about the kinds of situations experienced by\na ``worker'' on AMT. Thus, the results obtained here may not\ngeneralize to participants recruited in an ``offline'' setting.\nBased on prior studies comparing Internet and college samples,\nwe suspect that this is somewhat unlikely (see Gosling, Vazire,\nFuture Directions\nThe primary goals of the studies presented here were to con-\ntribute to the development of the SAAP and validate its psy-\nchometric properties. Future studies should integrate the SAAP\ninto novel research paradigms inside and outside the labora-\ntory. As we have seen, evolutionary psychologists are already\npriming these fundamental motives in lab experiments (e.g.,\nnow employ a reliable and validated measure rather than rely-\ning on ad hoc manipulation checks to ensure successful\npriming.\nExtending beyond laboratory experiments, the SAAP pro-\nvides a tool for measuring situationally influenced goal activa-\ntion in vivo. For example, experience-sampling studies can\nemploy the SAAP to understand how momentary shifts in\nsituational affordances lead to changes in goal strivings (e.g.,\nbehavior). Further, such changes in behavior can then be linked\nto changes in life outcomes at the level of single individuals\n(e.g., how do situational opportunities or threats to goal\nachievement relate to smoking behavior?) and organizations\n(e.g., how do organizational dress code policies affect per-\nceived at-work affordances for mate seeking and what is their\nimpact on workplace productivity?).\n12 Evolutionary Psychology\nConclusion\nSituations importantly influence the way people think, feel, and\nbehave. Yet only a small body of research attempts to quantify\nthe psychologically important features of situations. This arti-\ncle contributes to this growing literature by providing an instru-\nment for assessing situational characteristics that may elicit\nseven fundamentally important human motives. With such a\ntool in hand, future research can focus on understanding how\nsituations influence human motivation and ultimately,\nbehavior.\nAppendix\nSituational Affordances for Adaptive Problems\nPlease rate each item using the following scale:\n(1) Strongly disagree,\n(2) Somewhat disagree,\n(3) Neither agree nor disagree,\n(4) Somewhat agree, and\n(5) Strongly agree.\nIn this situation . . .\n(1) . . . it is important to cooperate with others.\n(2) . . . getting along with others is important.\n(3) . . . sharing with others is important.\n(4) . . . there is an opportunity to maintain friendships.\n(5) . . . it is important to gain respect from others.\n(6) . . . there is an opportunity to earn others' respect.\n(7) . . . status is important.\n(8) . . . maintaining status and/or respect from others is\nimportant.\n(9) . . .
