Findings from the WHO multi-country study\non women's health and domestic violence revealed that\nrienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate part-\nner at least once in their lifetime (Garcia-Moreno, Jansen,\nEllsberg, Heise, & Watts, 2006). A review of data from\nDemographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 10\ncountries also revealed that the lifetime prevalence of physi-\ncal or sexual violence among currently married or cohabiting\nKishor, & Ansara, 2008). Findings from some studies con-\nducted in Nigeria similarly indicate that IPV is common\namong women. For example, Mapayi, Makanjuola, Fatusi,\naged 18 to 37 years attending the antenatal clinic and welfare\nunits of a primary health center in Ile-Ife, South-West\nNigeria, had experienced IPV in the 12-month period pre-\nceding their survey (Mapayi et al., 2011). Balogun, Owoaje,\nand Fawole (2012) reported a lifetime IPV prevalence of up\nNigeria. The discrepancies in prevalence rates across studies\nhave been attributed to factors such as differences in method-\nology, definitions of violence, study population as well as\nwillingness of study participants to disclose this information\nespecially if privacy is not ascertained during the data collec-\ntion process (Krug, Mercy, Dahlberg, & Zwi, 2002).\nGenerally also, reporting of IPV is still a problem in many\nIPV can take many forms such as physical violence, sex-\nual abuse, and psychological abuse (Heise & Garcia-Moreno,\n1University of Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nAdesola Oluwafunmilola Olumide, Institute of Child Health, College of\nMedicine, University of Ibadan/University College Hospital, Oyo State,\nNigeria.\nEmail: daisyolu@yahoo.co.uk\nPrevalence and Predictors of Intimate\nPartner Violence Among Female\nYouth in an Urban Low-Income\nNeighborhood in Ibadan, South-West\nNigeria\nKehinde Abisoye Onanubi1, Adesola Oluwafunmilola Olumide1,\nand Eme T. Owoaje1\n Keywords\nintimate partner violence, violence, young female, female youth\n2 SAGE Open\nhave been associated with IPV and these include physical\ninjuries (Antai, 2011; Esere, Idowu, Durosaro, & Omotosho,\nCortens et al., 2013), and sexual and reproductive health\nproblems such as unintended pregnancy, nonuse of condoms,\nsexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS (Decker\nadverse pregnancy outcome (Silverman et al., 2007).\nViolence within an intimate relationship is not restricted\nto adults but is similarly pervasive among young people\n(Bruce, 2011; St\u00f6ckl, March, Pallitto, & Garcia-Moreno,\n2014). Although, males also experience violence from their\nintimate partners, females are more likely to be victims and\nto suffer from the attendant effects of IPV (Gass, Stein,\nKrug et al., 2002). A number of studies have also docu-\nmented that young age is associated with being a victim of\nMapayi et al., 2011). Findings from studies among young\nfemales have documented IPV rates as high as 66%. For\nexample, St\u00f6ckl et al. (2014), in their analysis of IPV\namong adolescents and young women aged 15 to 24 years\nin nine countries, found a lifetime prevalence of IPV that\namong adolescents residing in vulnerable urban communi-\nties in five global cities, revealed that among ever-partnered\nwomen, past-year IPV prevalence ranged from 10.2% to\n36.6%. Young females who experience IPV are exposed to\nsimilar consequences as older adult women; however, an\nadditional challenge for them is the fact that experiencing\nIPV during this stage in their development is an established\nrisk factor for violence within future intimate relationships\nthe \"longitudinal associations between teen dating violence\nvictimization and adverse health outcomes,\" demonstrated\nthat teenage respondents who experienced teen dating vio-\nlence had a higher incidence of various adverse health out-\ncomes such as substance abuse, suicidal ideation, and IPV\nvictimization. These highlight the immediate and long-term\nnegative consequences of IPV on young females. In addi-\ntion, young females residing in low-income settings within\ncities are at increased risk of violence and several other\nnegative health outcomes (United Nations Children's Fund,\nThe Ecological Model for Understanding IPV\nThis article utilized the ecological model to explore the fac-\ntors that predispose female youth, that is, females aged 15 to\n24 years (United Nations Department of Economic and\nSocial Affairs [UNDESA]) to IPV victimization. According\nto the WHO World Report on violence and health, the eco-\nlogical model \"explores the relationship between individual\nand contextual factors and considers violence as the product\nof multiple levels of influence on behavior\" (Krug et al.,\n2002). The ecological model has been utilized by various\nresearchers to explain the factors influencing violence which\noperate at individual, relationship, community, and societal\nIndividual factors are personal factors within the indi-\nvidual that increase the likelihood of being a victim or a\nperpetrator of violence. Examples of these include female\ngender, age, low level of education, substance abuse, previ-\nous experience to violence, and so on. Female youth resid-\ning within low-income communities are more likely to have\nlow levels of education, be unemployed or engaged in\nmenial jobs, and have a history of witnessing parental vio-\nlence compared with their counterparts residing in higher\nWithin the ecological model, relationship-level factors are\nthose which involve close social interactions between the\nindividual and people in his or her family or immediate\nenvironment and the influence of these relationships on\nviolence perpetration or victimization. Relationship-level\nfactors predisposing female youth in low-income commu-\nnities to IPV include discord within their intimate relation-\nships, being in relationships with men who have lower\nlevels of education, are unemployed, have multiple part-\nners, exhibit controlling behavior, use substances, and who\nexperienced violence when growing up (Krug et al., 2002;\nUthman, Lawoko, & Moradi, 2010). Community-level fac-\ntors refer to the community contexts, for example, neigh-\nborhoods, workplaces, and schools within which social\nrelationships are domiciled. Within the community, factors\nsuch as low levels of education among the community\nmembers, high levels of poverty and unemployment, and\nlow socioeconomic status of women influence the rates of\nIPV (Heise & Garcia-Moreno, 2002; United Nations\nChildren's Fund, 2012). The societal level includes factors\nwithin the society at large such as institutional, community,\nand public policies and laws that regulate or support healthy\nactions and practices. Other societal-level factors promot-\ning IPV within low-income communities include weak\nlegal sanctions against IPV, sociocultural values and norms\nthat view IPV as acceptable, and norms that associate man-\nhood with dominance and aggression (Heise & Garcia-\nSteckler, & Glanz, 1988; U.S. Department of Health and\nFigure 1. Ecological model for understanding violence.\nSource. Krug, Mercy, Dahlberg, and Zwi (2002).\nOnanubi et al. 3\nHuman Services, 2005). The ecological model when\napplied to violence is also useful in the development of\ninterventions that target key actors or institutions at the dif-\nferent levels of influence.\nIn spite of the fact that young females are at higher risk for\nIPV compared with their older counterparts, there is a pau-\ncity of published research on IPV among them (Russell et al.,\n2014) especially in developing countries like Nigeria.\nFurthermore, available studies among this vulnerable cate-\ngory of women are usually school-based (Russell et al.,\nhealth-facility based (Mapayi et al., 2011). These would miss\nout on a significant proportion of females residing in these\npoor communities, because many of them already have lim-\nited access to amenities such as education and health care\n(United Nations Children's Fund, 2012). The focus of this\narticle was therefore to determine the prevalence and predic-\ntors of IPV among female youth aged 15 to 24 years residing\nin Idikan community, a densely populated, low-income\nurban community in Ibadan North-West Local Government\nArea (LGA), Oyo state, Nigeria. Our findings would add to\nthe existing body of knowledge on IPV among female youth\nin developing countries like Nigeria and also provide data\nrequired to develop interventions targeting this category of\nfemales. Data for this article were from a larger cross-sec-\ntional study on IPV among women of reproductive age in\nmarried/current relationships residing in a low-income com-\nmunity (Idikan) in southwestern Nigeria.\nMethod\nThis was a cross-sectional community-based study and we\nanalyzed data for young women aged 15 to 24 years residing\nin Idikan community, Oyo state, Nigeria.\nStudy Area\nIdikan community is an inner core community in Ibadan\nNorth\u00adWest LGA, Oyo state, Nigeria (Lawoyin et al., 2004).\nIt is a densely populated area comprising mainly of people of\nYoruba ethnicity. Most families are polygamous with large\nfamily sizes comprising grandfathers, uncles and aunts, and\ngrandchildren residing in smaller apartments or rooms all\nlocated within the family compound (also called \"agbole\").\nThere are established health facilities within the community\nproviding primary care and referral services (Osamor &\nStudy Participants\nThe study participants comprised female youth (aged 15-24\nyears) in current relationships. The definition of youth used\nin this article is in line with the United Nations's definition\nwhich specifies that a youth is an individual aged 15 to 24\nyears of age (UNDESA).\nSampling Technique\nRespondents were selected using a cluster sampling tech-\nnique. The Idikan community is located within the inner core\nof the Ibadan North-West LGA. The community is composed\nof smaller units--compounds--and within each compound\nare two or more houses. Two or more extended families\nreside in each house. A major road runs through the commu-\nnity and divides it into two approximately equal and largely\nhomogeneous neighborhoods. For this study, one half of the\ncommunity was selected by balloting. All the houses within\nthe selected neighborhood were visited and every eligible\nwoman residing in these houses who provided informed con-\nsent was interviewed (Owoaje & OlaOlorun, 2012).\nInstrument and Data Collection\nData were collected over a period of 4 months. The informa-\ntion was obtained from the respondents using questions from\nthe WHO Multi-Country Study on Women's Health and Life\nEvents questionnaire (version 9.9) used for the WHO Multi-\nCountry Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence\nfurther informed by the safety recommendations for con-\nducting research in domestic violence outlined in the WHO\nmanual: \"WHO Multicountry Study on Women's Health and\nDomestic Violence Against Women\" (WHO, 2005) and in\nthe WHO and PATHS manual on \"Researching Violence\nAgainst Women: A Practical Guide for Researchers and\nActivists\" (Ellsberg & Heise, 2005). The Department of\nCommunity Medicine runs a community clinic within the\nIdikan community and the clinic home visitors assisted the\nresearch team with community entry and navigating within\nthe community. On arrival in the family compound, the\nresearch staff introduced themselves to the household head\nor other adult in the household, and explained that the study\nwas about women's health issues. As suggested in the WHO\nguidelines, the research staff did not mention that questions\non violence would be asked. Within each household, all\nwomen aged 15 to 45 years who were married or had been in\nan intimate relationship were approached to participate in the\nstudy. Each eligible respondent suggested a convenient and\nprivate location within the household/family compound\nwhere the questionnaires could be administered without\ninterruption by her partner/husband or other family mem-\nbers. This was often on the porch, in the sitting room, or on\nthe corridor or in a section within the family compound were\nthe respondent could be free to answer the questions. The\ninterviewers had been trained to change the topic or discon-\ntinue the interview if other people came into the room,\napproached the section of the home environment where the\ninterview was being conducted, or if they had a sense that the\nrespondent's privacy might be breached. A few women\nrequested to have the interviews in their workplaces which\nwere not very far from their homes for better privacy.\n4 SAGE Open\nInformation obtained included respondents' sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics, sexual history, experience of vio-\nlence as a child, and history of physical and sexual violence\nexperienced within 12 months of the study. Information on\nselected partner characteristics was also obtained. The\nresponse rate for the larger study among the 15- to 45-year-\nold married or ever-partnered women was approximately\n98.6%. The current article is based on information obtained\nfrom the female youth aged 15 to 24 years.\nMeasures\nOutcome variable\nExperience of IPV victimization within 12 months of the\nstudy.Experience of at least one form of violence (physi-\ncal or sexual) from an intimate partner at least once in the\n12-month preceding the study.\nInformation on physical IPV victimization was obtained\nby asking respondents if their current husband/partner or any\nother partner had done any of the following to them within\n12 months prior to the study: slapped or thrown something at\nrespondent that could hurt the respondent; pushed or shoved\nrespondent or pulled respondent's hair; hit respondent with\nfist or something else that could hurt her; kicked, dragged, or\nbeaten respondent up; choked or burned respondent on pur-\npose; or threatened to use or actually used a gun, knife, or\nweapon against respondent.\nFor sexual IPV, respondents were asked if their current\nhusband/partner or any other partner had ever done any of\nthe following to them within 12 months prior to the study:\nphysically forced respondent to have sexual intercourse\nwhen she did not want to, or forced respondent to do some-\nthing sexual that they found degrading/humiliating.\nRespondents were also asked if they had sexual intercourse\nwhen they did not want to with their current husband/partner\nor any other partner because they were afraid of what he\nmight do.\nExplanatory/independent variables. Our choice of explanatory\nvariables was guided by the ecological model and informa-\ntion from previous literature which had identified some fac-\ntors associated with IPV among women (Abramsky et al.,\ntors at the individual and relationship levels of the ecological\nmodel. Individual-level factors studied were as follows:\n1. Sociodemographic characteristics: respondent's age,\ncurrent relationship status (i.e., if respondent was\ncurrently married or in an intimate relationship),\nhighest level of education, and occupation;\n2. Sexual history: age at first sexual intercourse, num-\nber of sexual partners ever had, circumstances sur-\nrounding first sexual intercourse (consensual or\nforced);\n3. History of violence: experience/witness of childhood\nviolence by respondent;\n4. Experience of violence by the respondent's mother.\nRelationship-level factors: These were limited to selected\npartner characteristics and included the following:\n1. Partners' sociodemographic characteristics such as\nage, education, employment status, type of work;\n2. Relationship of partner to respondent (spouse or\npartner);\n3. Type of marriage (monogamous or polygamous\nmarriage);\n4. History of partner witnessing violence as a child\n(whether or not his father used to beat up his mother);\n5. History of partner being involved in physical fights;\nand\n6. Use of alcohol by intimate partner\nAnalysis\nData were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 software. The\nassociations between the outcome variable (IPV in the last\n12 months) and the selected characteristics were first\nexplored using bivariate analysis (chi-square test). Following\nthe bivariate analysis, individual and partner variables that\nwere associated with experience of IPV within 12 months of\nthe study at p < .1 were entered into the multiple logistic\nregression model (using a stepwise approach) to determine\nfactors predicting IPV among the female youth.\nEthical approval for the study was obtained from the Oyo\nState Ministry of Health Ethical Review Committee. The\ntrained research staff obtained verbal informed consent from\nall respondents and they were informed that they were free to\nrefuse to participate and would not suffer any consequences\nif they chose not to participate. The research staff adminis-\ntered the questionnaires to the respondents, and confidential-\nity was maintained.\nResults\nRespondents' Characteristics\nyears were interviewed. More than two thirds of them,\nrently working (Table 1). More than three quarters (76.2%)\nof the females had sexual debut when they were aged 15 to\n19 years, 87.9% had ever had at most one to two sexual part-\nners;78.2% stated that their first sexual intercourse was con-\nsensual while, 9.7% said it was forced (Table 1).

About a quarter of the female youth who had their\nfirst sexual intercourse when they were aged 15 to 19 years\nhad experienced IPV compared with their counterparts who\nhad their first sexual intercourse when they were aged 11 to\nsurrounding sexual debut was significantly associated with\nIPV victimization as 37.9% of respondents who reported that\ntheir first sexual experience was forced had experienced IPV\nin the 12 months preceding the survey compared with 27.8%\nwho said their first sexual intercourse was coerced and 17.6%\nwho said their first sex was consensual (p = .021; Table 4).\nPartner-related factors associated with experience of IPV in the\nlast 12 months. Findings on the association between partner\ncharacteristics and experience of IPV in the last 12 months\nare presented in Table 5. A higher proportion of female youth\nwhose partners were engaged in unskilled/manual employ-\nexperienced IPV in the last 12 months (p = .031). None of the\ntwo female youth whose partners were in professional occu-\npations had experienced IPV. A significantly higher propor-\ntion of female youth (25.7%) who reported that their partners'\nfathers beat their mothers experienced IPV compared with\nthose whose partners'fathers never beat their mothers (8.3%;\np = .001). Approximately 35% of female youth whose part-\nners had been involved in a physical fight compared with\nthose whose partners had never been involved in a fight\nPredictors of IPV in the last 12 months\nIndividual-level factors predicting IPV victimization in the\nlast 12 months were age at first experience of sexual inter-\ncourse and circumstances surrounding sexual debut (i.e.,\nwhether first sexual intercourse was consensual, coerced, or\nforced) Table 6. Respondents who had their first sexual expe-\nrience when they were aged 15 to 19 years had a significantly\nhigher odds of IPV victimization compared with those aged\nexperience of sexual intercourse was nonconsensual (coerced\nor forced) were greater than 4 times more likely to have\nexperienced IPV compared with those whose first sexual\nexperience was consensual.\nPartner factors that were significant predictors of IPV vic-\ntimization in the last 12 months were partners' involvement\nin a physical fight and history of partner's father beating his\nmother. Respondents who reported that their partners had\nbeen involved in physical fights were greater than 2.5 times\nmore likely to have experienced IPV than their counterparts\nwhose partners had not been involved in physical fights (OR\ndents who stated that partners' fathers used to beat their\nmothers were also more likely to have experienced IPV in\nthe last 12 months compared with their counterparts whose\npartners' fathers did not beat up their mothers (OR = 41.82;\nDiscussion\nThis study assessed the prevalence and predictors of IPV\namong female youth from a low-income urban community.\nPrevalence of IPV\nOur findings revealed that many female youth in the study\narea were experiencing IPVas more than a fifth (21%) reported\n12-month experience of IPV. This is comparable with findings\nfrom some other studies; for instance, O'Donnell, Agronick,\nlence of IPV of 29% among economically disadvantaged\nyoung adult women aged 22 to 25 years in New York. Some\nother researchers have reported higher prevalence rates of IPV\namong young females; for instance, Russell et al. (2014)\nreported a 3-month prevalence of 39% among in-school girls\nin the eighth grade in Cape town, South Africa. On the whole,\nour findings confirm the wide range in IPV prevalence often\nreported within and between countries. This wide variation\nwas also highlighted in the WHO multi-country study on IPV\namong adolescents and young women aged 15 to 24 years\nwhich reported a lifetime prevalence of IPV that ranged from\nIn the current study, we found 12-month prevalence rates\nof physical and sexual IPV of 14.4% and 9.1%, respectively.\nOnanubi et al. 7\nThese are higher than corresponding values reported by\nUmana, Fawole, and Adeoye (2014) who found lifetime\nprevalence of physical and sexual IPV of 7.9% and 6.6%,\nrespectively, among postgraduate students (aged < 20 and 35\nyears) in Ibadan. Our higher prevalence rates could be\nbecause, compared with the sample studied by Umana et al.,\nour respondents were slightly younger overall, had lower\nlevels of education, and resided in vulnerable communities.\nThese characteristics (younger age and low levels of educa-\ntion) have been identified as factors that confer increased\nPredictors of 12-Month IPV Victimization\nOur study revealed a number of individual and partner-related\nfactors that were associated with 12-month IPV. Individual\nfactors associated with IPV (after logistic regression analysis)\nwere (a) age at first sexual intercourse (those who had first\nsexual intercourse when they were 15 to 19 years old com-\npared with those aged 11 to 14 years at first sex and (b) cir-\ncumstances surrounding sexual debut--Young women who\nreported that their first sexual experience was not consensual\nor forced were more likely to have experienced IPV.

(2014) similarly found that a history of nonconsensual\nsexual debut was significantly associated with IPV victimiza-\ntion. The incident of forced or unwanted sexual debut might\nhave occurred within the 12-month period under investiga-\ntion and could thus explain this finding. Another possible\nexplanation could be that the female had remained in this abu-\nsive relationship and the violence had continued.\nPartner-related factors significantly associated with\n12-month IPV were history of partner being involved in a\nfight and partner's father beating his mother. Other studies\nhave similarly reported that women whose partners have a\nhistory of being involved in aggressive behavior including\nphysical fights were more likely to be victims of IPV.\nO'Donnell et al. (2009), in their longitudinal study on IPV\namong economically disadvantaged young adult women,\nfound that those who had a history of aggressive behavior in\ntheir middle school years were likely to perpetrate IPV as\nyoung adults. Female youth in our study who reported that\ntheir partner's father used to beat his mother were more likely\nto report a history of IPV than their counterparts who did not\nhave a similar history. Findings from existing literature have\ndocumented that a positive history of IPV between partner's\nparents is an established risk for women to experience vio-\nlence from their partners (Hindin et al., 2008). This phenom-\nenon has been referred to as \"inter-generational cycling of\nviolence,\" described as the effect of witnessing violence in\nthe family as a child (Seedat, Van Niekerk, Jewkes, Suffla, &\nRatele, 2009). Possible reasons which have been adduced for\nthis include the fact that men who witnessed their fathers\nbeating up their mothers might have grown up with the\nimpression that this behavior is part of a relationship/marital\nrole that gives a man the right to abuse his partner as a means\nof correction or discipline (Umana et al., 2014). Hence these\nmen behave in a similar manner toward their own partners/\nspouses. Children who grow up witnessing violence within\nthe family may also be wrongly socialized to thinking that\nthis is a normal \"disciplinary measure.\" This finding high-\nlights the need to target individuals who report a history of\nviolence between their parents with appropriate interventions\nso that these affected children do not grow up to continue the\ncycle of violence within their own homes. In addition, some\ncultures in Africa support beating of wives as an \"appropriate\ndisciplinary measure\" (Uthman et al., 2010). This fuels IPV;\nhence, urgent steps need to be taken to discourage this view.\nOnanubi et al. 9\nConclusion\nOur findings confirm that IPV is a problem among female\nyouth residing in low-income communities. Past experi-\nence of violence was a major factor associated with IPV\namong our study population as the female youth who\nreported a history of IPV between their own or their part-\nners' parents and a history of their partners being involved\nin physical fights were at higher risk of being victims of\nIPV victimization. These findings highlight the urgent need\nfor comprehensive intervention programs to target vulner-\nable females as well as men within our study area. It is\nimportant to invest in primary prevention intervention\nefforts to prevent IPV among female youth in our study\narea. Our findings supported \"inter-generational cycling of\nviolence.\" We thus recommend that, psychological inter-\nventions that target women and men with a history of IPV\nin their parents could be useful in reducing the prevalence\nof IPV in our study area.\nLimitations\nOur study has a few limitations. First, we obtained self-\nreported history of IPV, and the prevalence could be lower\nthan expected as a result of information and recall bias.\nSome of the respondents could have withheld information\nregarding their personal experiences due to a general culture\nof silence regarding IPV in our society. We however tried to\nminimize this by encouraging the respondents to be open\nabout their experiences and emphasizing that the informa-\ntion they provided would be useful in advocating for appro-\npriate interventions. We made efforts to reduce recall bias\nby obtaining information on past-year experience of IPV in\naddition to a history of any past experience of IPV. Finally,\nour study was cross-sectional in nature; hence, we report on\nfactors associated with IPV and these do not imply a causal\nrelationship. However, these factors are consistent with\nresults from other studies. Our findings thus contribute to\nthe existing body of knowledge on IPV among female youth\nin socially disadvantaged communities and would be useful\nin developing interventions to target them.\nImplications of Study Findings\nOur findings emphasize the need for existing interventions\nto reach young females in disadvantaged neighborhoods to\nreduce the occurrence of IPV among them. One of the ways\nto reach these women could be through routine screening\nfor violence at any point when they encounter a health\nprofessional.\nTable 6.
