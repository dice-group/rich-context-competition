Although\nthere remains some debate as to the exact parameters of the\nassociation, much of the empirical literature demonstrates\nthat structural characteristics and the social processes at\nwork in disadvantaged neighborhoods moderate the influ-\nence of impulsivity on criminal behavior (c.f. Vazsonyi\neffects, sometimes referred to as evidence of \"contextual\nmoderation\", are often attributed to neighborhood features\nproviding greater access to criminogenic opportunities or\ngreater exposure to socialization processes promoting vio-\nlence over normative behaviors.\nTwo observations complicate the results presented in\nprior research. First, a sizable body of literature suggests\nthat indicators of neighborhood deprivation are associated\nwith youth offending; adolescents who reside in econom-\nically deprived neighborhoods typically exhibit higher\nlevels of problem behaviors than adolescents from more\naffluent neighborhoods (see Kubrin and Weitzer 2003;\nSampson 2002 for reviews). Second, emerging research\nsuggests that the social processes in disadvantaged neigh-\nborhoods may contribute to the development of undesirable\net al. 2005). From this vantage point, economic deprivation,\nlimited informal control, and socialization processes pro-\nmoting crime and delinquency may place youth from dis-\nadvantaged neighborhoods at a higher risk of developing,\nfor instance, impulsive tendencies. As a result, these youth\ntypically exhibit higher levels of delinquency and higher\nlevels of impulsivity than those from more affluent com-\nmunities. It remains unclear whether evidence of contextual\nmoderation uncovered in prior research reflects a \"true\"\nneighborhood effect or developmental processes that give\nrise to compositional differences in both impulsivity and\ndelinquency across neighborhoods. In other words, whether\nimpulsive youth are more likely to offend when they live in\nimpoverished areas, or whether youth who live in impo-\nverished areas are more likely to display impulsive and\naggressive tendencies. As is argued below, disentangling\ncontextual influences from developmental processes is cri-\ntical to understanding the complex role that neighborhoods\nplay in adolescent behavior.\nThe present article attempts to bridge this gap in the\nliterature in several key regards. The analyses begin by\nexamining the relationship between impulsivity and violent\nbehavior among a nationally representative sample of\nAmerican adolescents. Census data are linked to the resi-\ndential tracts of survey respondents to examine whether and\nhow indicators of neighborhood disadvantage moderate the\nrelationship between impulsivity and self-reported violence.\nFinally, a neighborhood-based, group decomposition fra-\nmework is used to partition the moderating effect of\nneighborhood context into its constituent parts. This tech-\nnique assumes that developmental and contextual factors\nlead to unique data generating processes that differentially\naffect the estimation of contextual moderation. While the\ndiscussion is framed around recent research on impulsivity\nand neighborhood disadvantage, these techniques can be\napplied to a broad range of topics linking individuals to\nbroader ecological contexts. And, although the procedures\npresented here have been used in most social science dis-\nciplines, with a few exceptions, they have yet to be\nembraced in person-context research.\nPerson-context research assumes that behavioral risk\nfactors are more strongly associated with criminal behavior\nin particular social contexts (for a comprehensive overview\nsee Messner and Zimmerman 2012). An appreciable portion\nof this research has focused on identifying neighborhood-\nlevel mechanisms that either mitigate or exacerbate the\nassociation between impulsivity and delinquency (see\nVaughan 2017 for a comprehensive review). The over-\nwhelming focus on impulsivity, or low self-control, is likely\nattributed to the fact it is one of the most robust and well-\nstudied dispositional correlates of delinquency (Gottfredson\nhave reported the effect of impulsivity on offending to be\nstrongest among adolescents living in economically dis-\nadvantaged neighborhoods and neighborhoods character-\nized by low levels of adult supervision (Jones and Lynam\nOther studies have uncovered the opposite--that the effect\nof impulsivity is stronger in relatively affluent neighbor-\nhoods with high levels of collective efficacy (Fine et al.\nat least two studies have failed to detect any evidence of\ncontextual moderation (Vazsonyi et al. 2006; Zimmerman\nWhile research in this vein has produced somewhat\nequivocal findings, each of these studies is grounded within\na similar theoretical framework and each points to similar\nmechanisms purported to underlie the stronger effect of\nimpulsivity on delinquency in certain neighborhoods--\nnamely, the differential distribution of contextual risk-\nfactors. For instance, Lynam and colleagues (2000) draw\nfrom routine activities theory (Cohen and Felson 1979;\nthat the lack of informal social control in disadvantaged\nneighborhoods provides greater opportunity for impulsive\nindividuals to engage in rule violating behavior. Zimmer-\nman (2010), on the other hand, argues that disadvantaged\nneighborhoods present a variety of risk-factors for delin-\nquency that suppress the influence of dispositional risk\nfactors. When these external factors are removed, the\nassociation between impulsivity and delinquency emerges\nmore clearly. In this case, contextual risk-factors in the most\ndisadvantaged areas may push all youth to engage in\ncriminal conduct. In relatively low-risk contexts, youth with\nthe strongest internal controls may benefit the most from the\nresources available to them (see also, Fine et al. 2016;\ndraw from Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990) and argue that\nopportunities for crime are ubiquitous, thus explaining the\nlack of moderation uncovered in their analysis.\nFigure 1 presents a theoretical diagram outlining the\nhypothesized moderating relationship of neighborhood dis-\nadvantage on the association between impulsivity and\ndelinquency typically explored in person-context research.\nPath A represents the direct effect of impulsivity on\noffending, and Path B represents the moderating role of\nneighborhood disadvantage. The dotted line differentiates\nprocesses hypothesized to occur at the individual level from\nthose at the neighborhood level--in this case, path A reflects\nan individual-level relationship, while path B reflects the\nmoderating role of neighborhood-level processes.\nDrawing from the neighborhood effects literature, an\nalternative explanation for a stronger effect of impulsivity,\nor dispositional risk factors more generally, in economically\ndeprived neighborhoods can be attributed to the fact that\nhigh-risk individuals are often overrepresented in high-risk\nenvironments. In traditional thinking on selection effects,\nthis means that people with particular background char-\nacteristics differentially select certain types of neighbor-\nhoods; for instance, poor people may be more likely to live\nin economically deprived neighborhoods as housing prices\nare lower (van Ham and Manley 2012; van Ham et al.\n2012). However, much of the person-context literature\nfocuses on adolescents and it bears to reason that the non-\nrandom distribution of children and adolescents across\nneighborhoods overwhelmingly reflects the decisions of\nparents. While it is unlikely that impulsive youth choose to\nlive in neighborhoods with high levels of socioeconomic\ndisadvantage, as it is their parents who make residential\ndecisions, it is not unreasonable to assume that family and\nbroader community characteristics associated with neigh-\nborhood disadvantage contribute to the greater likelihood\nthat these children develop impulsive traits.\nBuilding from Wikstrom and Sampson (2003), commu-\nnity context may contribute to adolescent behavior through\ntwo complimentary processes: (1) neighborhoods can affect\nthe presence of situational opportunities in which crime is\nconsidered a reasonable option and (2) neighborhoods,\nthrough both direct and indirect means, can influence the\ndevelopment of criminal predispositions, such as low self-\ncontrol or impulsivity. In regards to the former (presence of\nsituational opportunities), neighborhood disadvantage may\ndiminish informal social control and provide greater\nopportunity for adolescents to engage in unstructured\nactivities with their peers, away from adult chaperones--\nprime conditions for delinquency (Bernasco et al. 2013;\nstr\u00f6m and Butterworth 2006). In this sense, neighborhoods\ncan be seen as having a direct influence on individual\nbehavior--sometimes referred to as a \"neighborhood\" or\n\"contextual\" effect.\nIn regards to the latter (development of criminal disposi-\ntions), neighborhoods can be thought of as a collective form\nof socialization, whereby the shared monitoring and super-\nvision of youth behavior within the larger community fra-\nmework helps shape healthy child development (Leventhal\nShaw and McKay 1942). Disadvantaged neighborhoods,\ncharacterized by low levels of cohesion and limited com-\nmunication among neighbors, may be less adept at creating\nself-control in children. Moreover, families living in eco-\nnomically deprived communities may face a number of dis-\nadvantages, such as single-earner families, unemployment,\nand poverty, which detract from their ability to adequately\nsocialize their children. Coupled with the absence of com-\nmunity resources to alleviate the burden, children growing up\nin these areas may experience inconsistent supervision,\ninconsistent rule enforcement, and inconsistent discipline\nwhen they misbehave. As a result of both community and\nfamily socialization practices, children may not develop the\nsame executive functions (e.g., the ability to delay gratifica-\ntion) as children from more affluent communities (Hart et al.\n2008). Indeed, several studies have reported an inverse\nrelationship between neighborhood disadvantage and levels\nof self-control, in some cases rivaling the effects of family\nGibson et al. 2010). In this sense, neighborhood disadvantage\nFig. 1 Hypothesized moderation association neighborhood dis-\nadvantage on impulsivity-delinquency. a Direct effects of impulsivity\non delinquency. b Moderation effect of disadvantage on the\nimpulsivity-delinquency association\nmay contribute to the development of criminogenic traits like\nimpulsivity. It bears to reason that these developmental\nprocesses will be stratified by place, leading to a greater\nconcentration of impulsive adolescents in certain areas than\nothers. These differences are likely to be differentially dis-\ntributed across levels of socioeconomic disadvantage, such\nthat the most high-risk youth are disproportionately clustered\ninto the most high-risk environments.\nFigure 2 presents an expanded theoretical model of the\nmoderating role of neighborhood disadvantage on the asso-\nciation between impulsivity and delinquency, incorporating\nthe role of developmental and contextual influences. In this\nfigure, Path C represents the direct effect of neighborhood-\nlevel disadvantage on offending. This pathway is assumed in\nmost person-context research and can be directly assessed\nthrough the main effect of neighborhood disadvantage in\nstandard regression models. Path D reflects the develop-\nmental processes that may lead to higher levels of impulsivity\namong adolescents who grow up in disadvantaged commu-\nnities. Unlike the direct effect of neighborhood disadvantage,\nthis pathway is rarely considered and its influence cannot be\ngleaned from a standard regression model. Thus, to truly\nunderstand the moderating role of neighborhood context on\nthe association between impulsivity and offending,\nresearchers need not only examine paths A and B, but also\nneed to carefully consider the role of C and D.\nCurrent Study\nThe purpose of the current study is to examine the more\nnuanced model of impulsivity, neighborhood disadvantage,\nand self-reported violence presented in Fig. 2 among a\nnationally representative sample of American adolescents.\nDrawing from the theoretical processes highlighted in Fig. 2,\nthe analyses begin by examining the independent associations\nbetween impulsivity and neighborhood disadvantage on self-\nreported violence. We hypothesize that impulsivity\n(Hypothesis 1) and neighborhood disadvantage (Hypothesis\n2) will be positively associated with self-reported violence.\nThe analyses next assess whether the relationship between\nimpulsivity and self-reported violence is contingent on levels\nof neighborhood disadvantage. Consistent with the work of\nVogel (2016) using the same data, we anticipate that neigh-\nborhood disadvantage will strengthen the relationship\nbetween impulsivity and violence, implying a positive inter-\naction effect (Hypothesis 3). The final set of analyses examine\nwhether differences in average levels of violence and impul-\nsivity across communities can help explain variation in the\neffect of impulsivity on violence across neighborhoods with\nvarying levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. While it is\nmore difficult to anticipate the exact nature of the mechanisms\ndriving the hypothesized interaction, the theoretical processes\npresented in Fig. 2 portend that average levels of both vio-\nlence and impulsivity will be higher in disadvantaged com-\nmunities. These compositional differences should then\npartially explain the moderating effect of neighborhood dis-\nadvantage on the association between neighborhood dis-\nadvantage and self-reported violence (Hypothesis 4).\nMethods\nData\nData for the analyses were drawn from the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add\nHealth), a nationally representative survey of adolescents\nand followed through early adulthood (with data collection\nongoing). The original survey design included a sample of\n80 high schools and 52 middle schools from the United\nStates with an unequal probability of selection, ensuring\nrepresentativeness with respect to region of country, urba-\nnicity, school size, school type, and ethnicity. In the first\nphase of data collection, a brief questionnaire was admi-\nnistered to all youth enrolled in grades 7\u00ad12 in each of the\n132 schools with no make-up given for absent students. The\nin-school survey covered topics such as socio-demographic\ncharacteristics, risk behaviors, future expectations, health\nstatus, perceived school climate, and household structure. In\naddition to these data, school administrators provided\ninformation on characteristics such as graduation rate,\nretention rate, and class size.\nFrom the initial in-school survey, over 20,000 students\nwere selected to participate in the first wave of the long-\nitudinal follow-up study. The Wave I data included 39 self-\nreport questionnaires on topics covering general health,\nromantic relationships and contraception, employment and\nincome, as well as personality characteristics and delinquent\nbehavior. Additionally, respondents' home addresses were\nFig. 2 Hypothesized direct and moderation effects of neighborhood\ndisadvantage on impulsivity, delinquency, and the relationship\nbetween impulsivity and delinquency. a Direct effects of impulsivity\non delinquency. b Moderation effect of disadvantage on the\nimpulsivity-delinquency association. c Direct effect of neighborhood\ndisadvantage on delinquency. d Direct effect neighborhood dis-\nadvantage on impulsivity\ngeocoded, and geographic information from the 1990 cen-\nsus is available at the block group, tract, and county level\nrespondents who were still in high school were asked to\ncomplete a second wave of questionnaires. These data\nincluded information from roughly 14,000 respondents\n(excluding those who were high school seniors in Wave I).\nThe present analysis draws on a sample of 12,935 respon-\ndents who participated in the first two waves of the survey,\nViolence\nViolence, the primary dependent variable, is a count-based\nmeasure of the number of the following acts the respondent\nin which the respondent engaged during the 12 months prior\nto the Wave 2 interview: (1) injuring someone badly enough\nto need medical attention, (2) shooting or stabbing some-\none, (3) using or threatening to use a weapon to get\nsomething from someone (4) participating in a group fight,\n(5) using a weapon in a fight, (6) pulling a knife or gun on\nsomeone, (7) getting into a serious physical fight. The scale\nwas constructed by first dichotomizing each of these seven\nitems, then summing across items to generate count-based\nmeasure that captures the variety of violent offenses\nendorsed by Add Health respondents (alpha = 0.93).\nImpulsivity\nImpulsivity is measured by the extent to which respondents\nagreed with the following statement: when making decisions,\nyou usually go with your \"gut feeling\" without thinking too\nmuch about the consequences of each alternative. Responses\nto this item are arranged along a five item Likert scale ran-\nging from strongly disagree (low impulsivity) to strongly\nagree (high impulsivity). This item closely resembles (a lack\nof) premeditation, one of the four key facets of impulsivity\nNeighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage\nNeighborhood disadvantage is measured as a standardized\nindex of the percent of a respondents neighborhood\nreceiving welfare, the percent living at or below poverty, the\npercent unemployed, and percent of female headed house-\nholds (alpha = 0.923).

The regression equation takes on the basic form:2\n1 Unfortunately the Add Health study does not include a compre-\nhensive psychometric inventory and therefore we are limited in our\nability to use a comprehensive measure of impulsivity. We should note\nthat this item closely parallels a lack of premeditation, or an inability to\nthink through the consequences of ones' action, which has been\nestablished as a robust correlate of criminal offending (e.g., Gott-\nfredson and Hirschi 1990). As a sensitivity analysis, we also re-\nestimated our models with alterative measures of impulsivity used in\nMcGloin and O'Neill Shermer 2009). The results of these supple-\nmental models are available upon request from the corresponding\nauthor.\n2 Some studies employ multilevel or hierarchical linear models\n(HLMs) to partition the variance in the dependent variable between\nindividuals and neighborhoods. Unlike the methods presented here,\nHLM models require (1) nested data--that is, respondents clearly\nsituated within broader neighborhood units, (2) a large number of\nneighborhoods, and a (3) large number of respondents in each\nneighborhood. Few extant data sources meet this requirement. More-\nover, the models require that variance can be specified on both L1 and\nL2, which is not possible with count or categorical models--those\nmost commonly employed in criminological research (Sweeten 2012).\nThus, the strategy presented here is an alternative to the HLM fra-\nmework when these computational requirements cannot be met.\nWhere Y refers to a scale of delinquency, b1\nrefers to the\nslope of impulsivity (denoted by Path A in Fig. 2), b2\nrefers\nis the slope of neighborhood disadvantage (Path C), and b3\nis the product term for the neighborhood disadvantage *\nimpulsivity (Path B). A significant coefficient for b3\nis\nusually considered sufficient evidence of contextual mod-\neration, and is often interpreted as the expected change in\nthe slope of b2\nacross levels of neighborhood disadvantage\n--in other words, how neighborhood context mitigates or\nexacerbates the effect of impulsivity on offending.\nThis interpretation is problematic, as the interaction term,\nin part, reflects compositional differences in impulsivity\nacross neighborhoods (due to relationship D in Fig. 2). For\nthe reasons outlined above, we might expect average levels\nof both impulsivity and violence to be higher among youth\nresiding in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods.\nThis suggests that Y and X1\nwill increase with neighbor-\nhood disadvantage. In the traditional regression framework,\nthese higher averages can generate a statistically significant\ncoefficient for b3\nwithout any true difference in the slope of\nacross neighborhoods. Thus, to sufficiently make claims\nabout contextual moderation, we need to rule out the pos-\nsibility that the observed coefficient is not driven by higher\naverages levels of impulsivity and delinquency alone (as\ndemarcated in paths C and D in Fig. 2).\nThe issue of developmental vs. contextual effects can be\nviewed as a special version of a more general problem\nidentified in the social science literature: identifying the\nextent to which differences in rates across groups reflects\ndifferences in group composition. While these techniques\nhave been utilized in other disciplines, they have yet to be\nemployed in person-context research. Oaxaca (1973) and\nBlinder (1973) independently proposed a relatively\nstraightforward means to address this problem, as it applied\nto gender differences in earnings. The same basic approach\nalso applies here. In the standard framework, group-based\ndifferences can be attributed to two factors--differences in\nlevels and differences in slopes. In the earnings nomen-\nclature, this means that a difference in income between\nmales and females could reflect, in part, higher average\neducation among males (levels) and the portion that cannot\nbe explained by educational differences (e.g., the unex-\nplained portion) would then be attributed to a true interac-\ntion effect.3 In the case of neighborhood context and\nimpulsivity, the differences in levels can be viewed as\nanalogous to the differential distribution of individual risk-\nfactors across neighborhoods (Paths C and D), while the\n\"unexplained\" part of the interaction could be interpreted as\n\"neighborhood moderation\" (Path B).\nIn its simplest application, the decomposition involves a\nfour-step process. In the first step, we followed prior\nresearch in this area (e.g. Farrington and Loeber 2000; Fine\nneighborhood disadvantage index at the 75th percentile to\ncreate a dichotomy differentiating \"disadvantaged\" neigh-\nborhoods from all other neighborhoods. Second, differences\nin average levels of impulsivity and offending were asses-\nsed by comparing means across neighborhood groupings.\nThird, two separate regression equations were estimated,\none for respondents living in disadvantaged neighborhoods,\nand the second for respondents living in all other neigh-\nborhoods such that:\n^\nyH\n\u00bc aH\n\u00fe bHXH\nand\n^\nyL\n\u00bc aL\n\u00fe bLXL\nIn these equations y is the predicted level of self-reported\nviolence, a is the regression constant, X is the mean level of\nimpulsivity, and b is the regression coefficient. The sub-\nscript H refers to respondents living in neighborhoods with\nhigh levels of disadvantage and L refers to respondents\nliving in neighborhoods with low levels of disadvantage.\nSimilar to Eq. 1, contextual moderation can be assessed by\ncomparing bH\nand bL\n, in this case, the Clogg Test for the\nequality of coefficients can be used to assess statistical\nsignificance (Paternoster et al. 1998).4 The difference in\naverage levels of self-reported delinquency can then be\nexpressed as the difference in predicted levels of delin-\nquency between Eqs. 2 and 3:\n^\nyH\n\u00c0 ^\nyL\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc aH\n\u00fe bHxH\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00c0 aL\n\u00fe bLxL\nWhich can be expanded into the Blinder (1973) and\n^\nyH\n\u00c0 ^\nyL\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc bH xH\n\u00c0 xL\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe xL bH\n\u00c0 bL\nIn this equation (y\nH\n\u00ady\nL\n) is the expected difference in\nself-reported violence between adolescents living in dis-\nadvantaged and non-disadvantaged neighborhoods.\nbH\n(xH\n\u00adxL\n) represents the portion of the difference in vio-\nlence across neighborhoods that can be attributed to com-\npositional differences--in this case, higher average levels of\nimpulsivity in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The final\ncomponent, xL\n(bH\n\u00adbL\n), is the \"unexplained\" part of the\ninteraction effect, in this case, the portion of the interaction\nthat can be attributed to a stronger effect of impulsivity on\nviolence in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\n3 Notably, similar strategies have also been applied in the crimin-\nological literature to examine differences in offending between males\nand females (e.g., Botchkovar and Broidy 2013; Botchkovar et al.\n-bL\n)/(seH\nThe two component model can be expanded slightly\nsuch that:\n^\nyH\n\u00c0 ^\nyL\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc bL xH\n\u00c0 xL\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe xL bH\n\u00c0 bL\n\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00fe bH\n\u00c0 bL\n\u00f0 \u00de xH\n\u00c0 xL\n\u00f0 \u00de\nIn this case, the difference in violence across neighbor-\nhoods is decomposed into three components, the difference\nin mean levels of impulsivity [bL\n(xH\n\u00adxL\n)], the difference in\ncoefficients [xL\n(bH\n\u00adbL\n)], and a third component that\naccounts for the part of the difference that can be attributed\nto the interaction between levels and coefficients [(bH\n\u00adbL\n)\n(xH\n\u00adxL\n)] (Daymont and Andrisani 1984). This third com-\nponent, as discussed in greater detail below, overcomes\nscaling issues in X.\nFinally, the equations presented in Eqs. 5 and 6 can be\nexpanded slightly to determine the extent to which to which\ndifferences in Y (violence), in addition to differences in x\n(impulsivity), affect the observed interaction. This yields a\nfour component solution initially proposed by Jones and\n^\nyH\n\u00c0 ^\nyL\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc aH\n\u00c0 aL\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe bL xH\n\u00c0 xL\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe xL bH\n\u00c0 bL\n\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00fe bH\n\u00c0 bL\n\u00f0 \u00de xH\n\u00c0 xL\n\u00f0 \u00de\nHere [(aH\n\u00adaL\n)] is the difference in the adjusted intercepts\nof the two groups or the proportion of the observed inter-\naction that can be attributed to variation in mean levels of\nviolence (Y) across neighborhoods. [bL\n(xH\n\u00adxL\n)] is the\ncomponent attributed to differences in levels of impulsivity,\nor how the impact of impulsivity on violence for someone\nliving in a high disadvantage neighborhood would change if\nthey were living in a low disadvantage neighborhood.\nxL\n(bH\n\u00adbL\n) is the difference in the effect on impulsivity on\nviolence across neighborhoods and [(bH\n\u00adbL\n) (xH\n\u00adxL\n)] is the\nresidual component interpreted as the difference in the\ninteraction between mean levels of impulsivity and coeffi-\ncients across neighborhoods.5,6 Examining each of these\ncomponents as a proportion of the raw difference in pre-\ndicted levels of violence, (y\nH\n-y\nL\n), provides a means to\nquantify the contribution of compositional differences in\nviolence and impulsivity to the observed moderating effect\nof neighborhood disadvantage on the association between\nthe two. Thus, the third component provides the estimate of\nneighborhood moderation (Path B in Fig. 2) and the first\nand second components provide the estimates of develop-\nmental processes that give rise to compositional differences\nacross neighborhoods (paths C and D).\nResults\nMain Results\nTable 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the variables\nincluded in the analysis. The analytic sample was\nHispanic, and 8% non-Hispanic other race. The average age\nwas 15.3 years, and 55% of respondents reported living\nwith both biological parents. Respondents reported an\naverage level of impulsivity of 3.02 on a five-point scale.\nTable 2 presents the results from a regression model in\nwhich self-reported violence was regressed on the control\nvariables, impulsivity, neighborhood disadvantage, and the\ninteraction of impulsivity*neighborhood disadvantage.\nConsistent with some prior research (e.g., Jones and Lynam\nimpulsivity was associated with higher levels of offending,\nand neighborhood disadvantage moderated this association,\nsuch that effect of impulsivity on offending was amplified at\nhigher levels of neighborhood disadvantage. This provides\nconfirmation Hypotheses 1 and 3.\nTable 3 presents the results of the regression models\nestimated separately for respondents living in neighbor-\nhoods at the top-quartile of socioeconomic disadvantage\nand respondents living in all other neighborhoods. Con-\nsistent with the models presented in Table 2, the effect of\nimpulsivity on self-reported violence is stronger among\nMean (Prop) SD Min Max\n5 This example applies to a regression model in which neighborhood\ndisadvantage is collapsed into a dichotomy. The same general fra-\nmework can be applied to ordinal or continuous measures of neigh-\nborhood disadvantage. This extension would require expanding the\nnumber of regression equations to equal the number of categories, K,\nof the neighborhood measure. The decomposition could then be\nreplicated by comparing Y and X for each of the possible pairwise\ncomparisons, selecting the neighborhood with the highest level of\ndisadvantage as the referent.\n6 The decomposition presented here assumes the parameter estimates\nare generated from an OLS regression. This approach has also been\nregression, and counterfactual models (Machado and Mata 2005).\nBauer and Sinning (2008) provide a generalized decomposition for\nnon-linear models with discrete and limited dependent variables. The\nNLDECOMPOSE routine in Stata can handle these more complex\nrespondents living in disadvantaged neighborhoods relative\nto those living in more affluent neighborhoods (relationship\nB in Fig. 2; [Z = 1.92; one-tailed test]). Predicted levels of\nself-reported violence in disadvantaged and non-\ndisadvantaged neighborhoods were next generated by sub-\nstituting the mean level of impulsivity into Eqs. 2 and 3,\nrespectively. This yields the constituent terms for Eq. 7. For\ninstance, the mean level of impulsivity in disadvantaged\nneighborhoods was 3.09; substituting this value into the\nregression equation (holding the other covariates constant)\nprovides a y of 1.689 [y = a + bx]. Table 4 presents the\nsummary statistics from these subsequent regressions.\nThe results of the decomposition analysis indicate that\nroughly 81% of the observed interaction between impul-\nsivity and neighborhood disadvantage can be attributed to\ndifferences in the slope of impulsivity across neighborhoods\n(Table 5). Compositional differences in self-reported vio-\nlence (14%--Path C in Fig. 2) and impulsivity (2%--Path\nD in Fig. 2) make up the remainder of the observed inter-\naction. Collectively, these findings suggest that much of the\nobserved interaction can be attributed to contextual mod-\neration--that is, that the effect of impulsivity on violence is\nstronger in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbor-\nhoods. However, a non-trivial proportion, just under 16%,\ncan be attributed to the differential concentration of high-\nrisk (i.e., violent and impulsive) adolescents in dis-\nadvantaged neighborhoods.\nSensitivity Analyses\nWhile consistent with much prior research (e.g., Farrington\nand necessary for the decomposition procedure, the decision\nto dichotomize the measure of neighborhood disadvantage\nat the 75th percentile may be viewed as somewhat arbitrary.\nAs sensitivity analyses, the regression models and corre-\nsponding decomposition analyses were re-estimated by\nshifting the designation of `disadvantaged neighborhoods' to\nthe 90 percentile. The results of these supplemental analyses\ncan be found in Tables 6 and 7. Although the parameter\nestimates and corresponding components vary from those\nTable 2 Regression of self-reported violence on impulsivity,\nneighborhood disadvantage, and interaction (N = 12,935)\n se  se\nTable 3 Regression of self-reported violence on impulsivity across\nDisadvantaged tracts Non-disadvantaged\ntracts\n se  se\nTable 4 Summary statistics of\nimpulsivity and violence across\nneighborhood type\nDisadvantaged tracts Non-disadvantaged tracts Difference\nTable 5 Decomposition of difference in impulsivity--violence\nassociation across neighborhood type\nComponent Raw Percent\nTotal difference (y\nH\n\u00ady\nL\nPortion explained by differences\nin mean violence\n(aH\n\u00adaL\nPortion explained by differences\nin mean impulsivity\nbL\n(xH\n\u00adxL\nPortion explained by differences\nin impulsivity slope\nxL\n(bH\n\u00adbL\nResidual difference (bH\n\u00adbL\n)\n(xH\n\u00adxL\n)\npresented in the preceding tables, the general conclusions\nremain the same. The majority of the interaction between\nimpulsivity and violence can be attributed to a true differ-\nence in slopes; however, an appreciable portion of the\ninteraction can be attributed to higher levels of impulsivity\nand violence among adolescents residing in the most dis-\nadvantaged areas. Thus, the cut-point at which neighbor-\nhoods were deemed \"disadvantaged\" had little substantive\nbearing on the results presented here.\nDiscussion\nOver the past several decades, scholars have become\nincreasingly attuned to the importance of social context in\nthe etiology of adolescent development and behavior. This\nresearch has highlighted how chacteristics of schools and\nneighborhoods contribute to, for instance, educational\nrelationship conflict (Foshee et al. 2013), mental health\n(Nair et al. 2013), and prosocial adjustment (Riina et al.\n2013). A parallel body of literature has emphasized how\nsocial and spatial environments condition the relationships\nbetween individual risk-factors and adolescent behavior\ndemonstrates that adolescent behavior cannot be attributed\nto dispositional or contextual factors alone. Instead, beha-\nviors such as drug use, violence, and delinquency are best\nunderstood through the confluence of individual and\nenvironmental risk-factors. While recent research in this\nvein continues to underscore the intricate linkages between\nindividual and contextual risk-factors and their attendant\nconsequences for adolescent behavior (e.g., Chen and\nZimmerman and Farrell 2017), comparatively fewer studies\nhave focused on the more complex pathways through which\nthese processes operate. The present study attempted to\nbridge this gap in the literature by examining the relation-\nship between impulsivity (a dispositional risk-factor) and\nviolence among respondents living in neighborhoods char-\nacterized by varying degree of socioeconomic disadvantage\n(a contextual risk-factor). While some prior research in this\narea indicates the association between impulsivity and\noffending to be strongest in economically deprived com-\nsider the more nuanced processes driving these differences.\nDrawing from the work of Wikstrom and Sampson\n(2003), neighborhoods can be thought of as both (1) devel-\nopmental contexts that influence the formation impulsive and\nviolent tendencies and (2) social contexts which provide the\nopportunity for impulsivity to manifest in violent behavior.\nIn this sense, the stronger association between impulsivity\nand violence in disadvantaged neighborhoods can be attrib-\nuted to either the higher levels of violence and impulsivity\namong youth who reside in economically disadvantaged\nareas (a compositional effect) or the stronger effect on\nimpulsivity on violence in these areas (a contextual effect). In\nan effort to disentangle these complimentary processes, this\narticle applied a neighborhood-based, group decomposition.\nThe results of the regression models indicate that impulsivity\nwas positively associated with self-reported violence and that\nthis association was strongest among youth residing in the\nmost socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. The\nresults of the decomposition reveal that much of the stronger\neffect of impulsivity on violence in disadvantaged neigh-\nborhoods could be attributed to contextual processes. In other\nwords, there is something unique about socioeconomically\ndisadvantaged neighborhoods that increased the effect of\nimpulsivity on violence. However, a nontrivial portion of the\ninteraction could be attributed to higher levels of impulsivity\nand self-reported violence among youth residing in dis-\nadvantaged areas, suggesting the moderating relationship\nuncovered in prior research reflects more than an abundance\nof opportunities for impulsive youth to offend in socio-\neconomically disadvantaged areas. Instead, there is strong\nevidence that both compositional and contextual processes\nare at play. In this sense, the present article provides a more\nnuanced framework for understanding the complex rela-\ntionships between individual risk-factors and neighborhood\nfeatures on adolescent development and behavior.\nThe decomposition techniques presented here provide a\nrelatively intuitive means to bolster claims about the\ndevelopmental and contextual underpinnings often assumed\nin person-context models of behavior. As such, we encou-\nrage researchers to consider such techniques in their own\nwork. Insofar as there is apriori reason to assume compo-\nsitional differences between groups, it would be useful to\ndemonstrate the extent to which these differences drive\ninteraction effects. We caution researchers from concluding\nthey have uncovered evidence of contextual moderation\nwhen compositional differences account for the majority of\nthe observed difference across groups. However, we also\nencourage researchers to present results in which compo-\nsitional factors are primarily responsible for these differ-\nences, as the mechanisms driving compositional effects are\nmeaningful in and of themselves.\nThe techniques presented here are not limited to studies\nexamining the moderating role of neighborhood context on\nthe association between impulsivity and violence; rather,\nthey are a useful resource for researchers interested in the-\noretical models of behavior combining individual and\ncontextual factors more generally. These techniques could\nbe used to examine, for instance, the contribution of student\ncomposition to differences in victimization experiences, or\nto partition gene X environment interactions into\ncompositional and environmental components. These tech-\nniques can be applied to most analyses examining interac-\ntion effects in which developmental processes generate\nmeaningful compositional differences across groups.\nIt is important to note that such decomposition proce-\ndures reflect an exercise in variance partitioning. While\nthese analyses provide some insight into the structure of the\ninteraction effects, they do little to expound the causal\nprocesses underlying the stronger effect of impulsivity on\nviolence in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Thus, these\nprocedures allow us to conclude with relative certainty that\nthe tract-level interactions are not statistical artifacts; how-\never, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be\ndetermined. Likewise, we do not present this approach as an\nalternative to correcting regression models for endogeneity.\nResearchers who want to remove the confounding effects of\ncomposition remain well-served to employ standard coun-\nterfactual models, such as fixed-effects regressions, pro-\npensity score models, or instrumental variable approaches.\nWe would be remiss not to reiterate several key limita-\ntions of the findings reported here. The most glaring lim-\nitation is our operationalization and measurement of\nimpulsivity as a single item, rather than a more compre-\nhensive inventory that more fully captures into the multi-\nfaceted nature of the construct. As noted, the Add Health\nstudy was not designed to measure complex psychological\ntraits. As a result, we were limited in the variables at our\ndisposal. The assorted issues with measuring multifactorial\nconstructs with national survey data are well-documented in\nthe empirical literature (e.g., Wolfe and Hoffmann 2016).\nThe use of imprecise measures from questionnaires that\nwere not designed capture these traits pose a limitation to\nany study drawing from nationally representative survey\ndata. As such, we would strongly encourage future\nresearchers to replicate the results here with a more com-\nprehensive psychometric measure of impulsivity that more\nclosely captures each of its constituent dimensions (e.g.,\nrisk seeking, urgency, lack of perseverance).\nThe limitations of decomposition techniques have been\nwell documented in the econometric literature (e.g., Jones\ndiscussion here. First, the results of these procedures are\ncontingent on the category chosen as the referent. In the\napplication presented here, disadvantaged neighborhoods.\nThe choice of the reference group will alter the decom-\nposition procedure, as the choice of the base category will\naffect the estimation of the coefficients in the regression\nequation (and, as a result, the relative contribution of each\ncomponent to the overall difference). Second, in the stan-\ndard 2-component decomposition, the interpretation of the\nunexplained portion (e.g., the difference in slopes) is sen-\nsitive to scaling decisions and this component only has a\nmeaningful interpretation for variables which have a\nnatural zero point (Jones and Kelley 1984). This issue,\nhowever, is resolved in the three--and four--component\ndecompositions. Third, the procedure presented here\nassumed a binary moderator, in this case comparing dis-\nadvantaged and non-disadvantaged neighborhoods. Of\ncourse, collapsing continuous variables into dichotomies\ntruncates meaningful variation in neighborhood dis-\nadvantage. To address this issue, researchers could employ\nthe same framework and decompose the differences at\nvarious points of the neighborhood disadvantage index\n(e.g., one and two standard deviations above/below the\nmean). Fourth, the decomposition utilizes point estimates,\nthus ignoring the standard error of the coefficients.\nAlthough a bit beyond the purview of the present analysis, a\nhandful of scholars have proposed ways to incorporate\nstandard errors into the traditional decomposition frame-\nwork (e.g., Lin 2007). Finally, and perhaps most impor-\ntantly, the decomposition does not provide leverage to\ndetermine what is driving the difference in slopes, only the\nextent to which mean levels of X and Y contribute to the\nobserved interaction.\nConclusion\nThe results presented in this study underscore the complex\npathways through which individual and contextual factors\noperate to influence adolescent behavior. This study\ndemonstrated the extent to which variation in the associa-\ntion between impulsivity and delinquency across neigh-\nborhoods can be attributed to (1) differences in mean-levels\nof impulsivity and violence and (2) differences in coeffi-\ncients across neighborhoods. The decomposition method\nshowed that the differential effect of impulsivity on vio-\nlence can be attributed to both developmental processes that\nlead to the greater concentration of violent and impulsive\nadolescents in economically deprived neighborhoods as\nwell as the greater likelihood of impulsive adolescents\nengaging in violence when they reside in economically\ndisadvantaged communities. We encourage future\nresearchers to consider the nuanced role of developmental\nand contextual processes that link individual risk-factors to\nbroader contextual influences. To this end, the neighbor-\nhood-based, group decomposition presented here is a useful\nheuristic tool for researchers interested in the direct and\nmoderating effects of contextual influences on adolescent\nbehavior. While the approach is commonplace in other\nsocial science disciplines, the decomposition framework is\nrarely utilized in person-context research. Unlike many of\nthe methods du jour, this technique is relatively intuitive,\ncomputationally straightforward, and does not necessitate\ncomplex modeling strategies. In regards to the person-\ncontext literature in particular, we encourage researchers to\nsimultaneously consider developmental and contextual\ninfluences in theoretical models linking individual behavior\nto broader social ecologies, and caution readers against\nplacing too much stock in one mechanism without con-\nsidering the contribution of the other. The decomposition\nframework provides a useful means to this goal.\n"
