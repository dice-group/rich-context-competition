As the ABR has widespread clinical use, we evaluated the ability of this\nelectrophysiological method to characterize the threshold of tissue ID in rats by examining the relationship between markers\nof tissue ID and severity of ABR latency defects. To generate various levels of ID, female Long-Evans rats were exposed to\ndiets containing sufficient, borderline, or deficient iron (Fe) concentrations throughout gestation and offspring lifetime. We\nmeasured hematological indices of whole body iron stores in dams and offspring to assess the degree of ID. Progression of\nAN ID in the offspring was measured as ferritin protein levels at different times during postnatal development to complement\nABR functional measurements. The severity of ABR deficits correlated with the level of Fe restriction in each diet. The\nsufficient Fe diet did not induce AN ID and consequently did not show an impaired ABR latency response. The borderline Fe\ndiet, which depleted AN Fe stores but did not cause systemic anemia resulted in significantly increased ABR latency isolated\nto Peak I.The low Fe diet, which induced anemia and growth retardation, significantly increased ABR latencies of Peaks I to IV.\nOur findings indicate that changes in the ABR could be related to various degrees of ID experienced throughout\ndevelopment.\n",

Greminger1 and Margot Mayer-Pro\n Keywords\niron deficiency threshold, iron-deficient diet, auditory brainstem response, auditory nerve, ferritin\nIntroduction\nIron deficiency (ID) is the most common micronutrient\ndeficiency in the world and is especially prevalent during\nearly brain development, particularly as daily iron\nrequirements triple by the third trimester (World Health\nOrganization, 2001). Iron serves many functions in the\nbody both systemically, as well as on a tissue specific\nlevel. In the central nervous system (CNS), iron is an\nessential cofactor for many enzymes including those\ninvolved in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter synthe-\nsis, and the process of myelination (Conrad et al., 2000;\nTherefore, the impact of ID during vulnerable periods of\nneurodevelopment can be significant, and early gesta-\ntional ID has been associated with abnormalities in neur-\nonal development in both children and animals (Felt and\n1Department of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester,\nRochester, NY, USA\n2Department of Biomedical Genetics, University of Rochester, Rochester,\nCorresponding Author:\nMargot Mayer-Pro\n\u00a8schel, University of Rochester, 601 Elwood Avenue, Box\nEmail: Margot_Mayer-Proschel@urmc.rochester.edu\nASN Neuro\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nasn.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission\nprovided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\nSimilar to other nutritional deficiencies, ID occurs as a\nspectrum beginning with tissue iron store depletion and,\nif unsupplemented, progressing to impaired erythropoi-\n2013). All stages of maternal ID have been associated\nwith adverse effects on the offspring, but only the most\nsevere stage of ID can be reliably diagnosed via maternal\nblood or cord blood samples (Scholl and Reilly, 2000;\net al., 2010). Marginal maternal iron intake leads to low\nfetal Fe levels in CNS tissue but is below the threshold of\ngenerating anemia. This stage of marginal ID is clinically\ndifficult to diagnose and remains for the most part unde-\ntected. This is of great concern as infants born with\nsuboptimal iron stores may be at a greater risk of\nimpaired neural maturation. Therefore, there is a para-\nmount need for diagnostic neurofunctional screening that\ncould identify low CNS iron stores, despite normal sys-\ntemic clinical endpoints.\nGlobal behavioral tests often shed little information\non the specific abnormalities produced by developmental\ninsults. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a non-\ninvasive technique that provides objective measurement\nof auditory thresholds and neuronal transmission speed\nalong the auditory pathway from the end-organ to the\nbrainstem and higher auditory cortex (Jougleux et al.,\n2011). Signal processing begins in the cochlea, which\nfunctionality can be determined by the distortion-product\notoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) amplitudes. Changes in\nDPOAEs indicate damage to outer or inner hair cells,\nwhich are responsible for loss of auditory thresholds. In\nthe absence of haircell damage, signal processing and\nconduction velocity are mainly dependent on axon diam-\neter, myelination, and synapse integrity of the auditory\ncontrast to techniques that measure overall developmen-\ntal delays, which could be the result of multiple factors,\nthe ABR is advantageous because it provides localized\nfunctional measures at multiple synapse levels along the\nCNS pathway (Moore, 1987; Angulo-Kinzler et al.,\n2002). The series of nuclei involved in AN transmission\nare represented by the number and amplitude of individ-\nual wave components that vary by age and species (Jerger\net al., 1991). Peak I (PI) represents the activity of the AN\nnerve, whereas Peaks III to V are associated with higher\nauditory CNS centers such as the inferior colliculi (PIII)\nand auditory brainstem (PV) (Moore, 1987). Absolute\nlatency of these waves or peaks can be measured, as\nwell as the interpeak intervals, which are used to calculate\nthe speed of transmission (Warren, 1989).\nWhile the ABR is employed as a diagnostic tool for\nspeech and language learning deficits (Coenraad et al.,\n2011), its value to determine impairments associated\nwith ID in humans remains unclear. Some studies have\nfound significant changes in the ABR response in ID\nBerglund et al., 2011). The discrepancies are likely due to\ndifferences in severity or duration of ID in the cohorts\nexamined. Support for this comes from various animal\nstudies where we and others have found that both severe\nas well as marginal ID affect the ABR response and that\nthe impairment was greater when the ID occurs at the\nonset of pregnancy and thus affects the early states of\nLee et al., 2012). As these studies employed different\nanimal strains and different feeding paradigms that lead\nto various degree of ID, it remains difficult to draw firm\nconclusions about the degree of ID and the resulting\nimpact on the ABR.\nThe goals of this study presented here were twofold:\n(a) we wanted to determine the threshold of ID during\ngestation and postnatal development that would be\nsevere enough to induce CNS tissue ID but would not\nresult in systemic anemia in the offspring, and (b) we\naimed to evaluate whether the various degrees of ID\nestablished in the offspring would have a corresponding\nimpact on their ABR profiles.\nTo achieve this, we employed an animal model in\nwhich we could keep the time of exposure constant but\nwere able to manipulate the degree of ID. We found\nthat functional responses to the variable iron diets cor-\nrelated well with both the absolute concentration of\niron in the diet and the molecular indicators of tissue\nID. We also found that ABR profiling was a sensitive\ntool to detect possible brain maturation impairments in\nthe offspring even if a clinical state of ID anemia was\nnot indicated.\nMaterials and Methods\nAnimal Handling and Diets\nFemale Long-Evans rats (8 weeks) from Charles River\nLaboratories, (Wilmington, MA) were pair housed in\nplastic filter-top cages on corn-cob bedding\n(Pur-o'Cel, Maumee, OH) under humidity and tem-\nperature controlled conditions (12 hr light/dark cycle).\nAnimals were housed in a facility accredited by the\nAssociation for Assessment and Accreditation of\nLaboratory Animal Care with all protocols approved\nby the University Committee on Animal Resources at\nthe University of Rochester. For enrichment, females\n2 ASN Neuro\nand their offspring were given cotton square nestlets\nwith every cage change throughout the study. Starting\n2 weeks prior to breeding and continuing throughout\ngestation and lactation, females were fed ad libitum an\niron-sufficient (IS) diet containing 240 mg Fe/g diet\nor one of three iron-deficient diets (IDDs) containing\nLaboratories, see Supplemental Material Table S1).\nAt 11 weeks of age, females were bred to age-matched\nLong-Evans males, and the presence of vaginal plugs\nwas considered indicative of pregnancy and considered\ngestational day (GD) 1. Weight was recorded on GD1\nand measured as a percentage of GD1 weight gain at\nAt delivery, litter size was recorded and offspring\nPups were weaned at P21 and provided lifetime ad lib-\nitum access to the same respective diet as their dam\nuntil sacrifice. Offspring of dams fed the IS diet or\nID diet (6, 20, or 30 mg Fe/g) are designated as the\nIS group (total of 8 litters) or IDD group (total of\nrespectively. Analyses were performed on offspring of\nmixed sex, with equal numbers of each sex used per\nendpoint, where possible.\nHematological Analysis\nDams at GD15 were lightly anesthetized with isofluor-\nane and restrained while blood ($100 mL) was extracted\nfrom the jugular vein into EDTA coated tubes.\nOffspring were asphyxiated with carbon dioxide\n), and whole trunk blood was collected after\ncoated microtubes. Hematocrit (HCT) and hemoglobin\n(HGB) were analyzed according to the manufacture's\nguidelines (Heska\u00d5, Loveland, CO) with experimental\ncontrols used for reference values.\nWestern Blot Analysis\nFor tissue harvest, animals were asphyxiated with CO2\n, at\nseparated from the tympanic bulla and otic capsule.\nBoth cochlea from each animal were combined and mech-\nanically lysed in two volumes of XDP lysis buffer and one\nvolume of 0.5 mm glass beads (Next Advance, Averill\nPark, NY). Lysates were centrifuged, and the protein,\nwhich represents at that stage mainly the AN, was\nseparated and stored at \u00c080C until analyses. Protein\nconcentration was determined using the DCTM Protein\nAssay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and samples\n(35 mg) were resolved on 4% to 12% bis-tris NuPage\ngels (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Membranes were\ndilution) for 16 hr at 4C (Cell Signaling Technology\n#3998, Danvers, MA). Immunoreactive proteins were\nquantified by densitometry using ImageJ software\n(NIH, Bethesda, MD). Samples were normalized to\nb-Actin as a loading control and displayed as a ratio\nto age-matched IS control tissue. Different tissue sam-\nples were used for each diet group for each replicate\nWestern blot comparison.\nAuditory Brainstem Response\nTesting of the ABR was performed on P40 offspring of\neach diet. This age was chosen as our previous rodent\nmodels of moderate ID showed a significant decrease in\nneuronal conduction velocity specifically at this age (Lee\net al., 2012). Offspring were lightly sedated using a keta-\nmine (6 mg/kg BW)/xylazine (0.5 mg/kg BW) mix for a\nperiod of $1 hr. Thermal regulation of body temperature\nwas achieved using a heating pad during testing sessions.\nABR waveforms were evoked with trapezoidal wave pure\ntone pips at 30 cycles per second, delivered at frequencies\nof 8, 16, and 32 kHz (optimal hearing range in rats;\nthrough high-frequency transducers at a distance of\n5 cm at a perpendicular angle to the left pinna.\nSubdermal needle electrodes (Platinum 10 mm, 30 gauge\nmonopolar; Grass Technologies, Middleton, WI) were\ninserted at the cranial vertex, and in the muscle posterior\nto the left pinna, with a ground electrode placed in the\ngluteus maximus muscle. Responses from the left ear\naveraged using the SmartEP data-acquisition software\n(Intelligent Hearing Systems, Miami, FL). In total,\n1,024 responses were averaged (with alternating stimulus\npolarity) using an ``artifact reject'' that discards\nresponses when peak-to-peak amplitude exceeds 15 mV\nas previously described (Jones et al., 2006). Left ear-\nonly recordings were chosen for this study, as multiple\nprevious experiments showed no evidence of unilateral\neffects due to ID on ABR responses (unpublished\nobservation).\nStatistical Analyses\nData were appropriately transformed if analysis indi-\ncated significant deviation from normality or equal\nvariance. Statistical analysis of endpoints was done\nusing one-way (within age or diet) or two-way analysis\nof variance (Age \u00c2 Diet or Diet \u00c2 Frequency) where\nappropriate and, in the presence of significant main\neffects or interactions (p < .05), post hoc tests (Holm-\nSidak) were used to determine the nature of the effect.\nMultiple comparisons between diets in post hoc tests\nwere limited to comparison to IS controls within age\nor frequency.\nGreminger and Mayer-Pro\nResults\nDietary Iron Availability Only Mildly Affects the\nPregnant Dam\nWe found no significant effect of any diet on gestational\nweight gain or HGB concentrations 1 week before\ndelivery (Table 1). There were no significant differences\nin the amount of diet consumed, and administration of\nthe purified diets resulted in a gestational average daily\n30, 20, and 6 mg Fe/g diets, respectively. However, the\n6 mg Fe/g IDD significantly reduced HCT by approxi-\nmately 14% in the IDD-6 dams relative to all the other\ngroups (p < .05). The pregnancy outcome was not\naffected by any of the diets with respect to litter size,\ngestational length, or gender distribution.\nThere was, however, a significant difference in off-\nspring postnatal mortality, the 6 mg Fe/g IDD compared\nwith all other groups (p < .05), with almost 50% of off-\nspring expiring before the conclusion of the study at P40.\nWeight Gain and Hematological Outcomes in the\nOffspring Are More Sensitive to Changes in Dietary\nIron Concentrations Than in Dams\npregnancy, weaning, and early postnatal growth leads to\n(main effect of age p < .001). We found a significant diet\nby age interaction (p < .001), indicating that the impact of\nage on postnatal weight is dependent on the diet group.\nIn contrast, if the diet contained only 6 mg Fe/g, the off-\nspring showed significant growth retardation that wor-\nsened with age. Surviving pups showed 20% to 70%\nreduction in body weight relative to the IS control\ngroup from P14 to P40, respectively (Figure 1(a)).\nBoth HCT and HGB values significantly increased\nwith age in the 240 mg Fe/g control diet (main effect of\nobserve a treatment-related effect on HCT and HGB\nlevels at P14 and P21 with respect to the intermediate\ndiets (30 and 20 mg Fe/g diet; Figure 1(b) and (c)).\nHowever, these decreases were both mild and transient\nas they completely recovered by P40, relative to IS off-\nspring. This compensation occurred despite remaining on\nthe same respective deficient diets during this time.\nIn line with the dramatic lack of weight gain and\nincreased offspring mortality, the 6 mg Fe/g IDD dis-\nplayed progressive decreases in both HCT and HGB\nto P40, indicating severe anemia (Figure 1(b) and (c)).\nTissue Ferritin Levels Correlate Well but\nNot Precisely With Hematological Iron\nAvailability Indicators\nTo determine whether the easy to obtain and generally\nused HCT and HGB provide a useful correlate for CNS\ntissue iron stores, particularly with respect to ABR meas-\nurements, we quantified tissue ferritin levels in the ANs of\nthe offspring in each dietary group. As shown in\nFigure 2(a), tissue ferritin levels in the ANs were not\nTable 1. Maternal and Birth Outcomes in Dams Fed the IS or ID Diets.\nDiet\nDam weight gain, %\nGender distribution, n\nNote.

There was also a significant diet by age inter-\naction (p < .001), and the AN displayed a nearly 90% loss\nof ferritin protein expression by P40 (Figure 2(c)).\nFigure 2.

This age was\nchosen as our previous rodent models of moderate ID\nshowed a significant decrease in neuronal conduction vel-\nocity specifically at this age (Lee et al., 2012). As shown in\nFigure 3, iron depletion in the AN was accompanied by\nsignificantly increased absolute latency of Peak I (PI)\ncompared with the iron-normal AN. We observed a\ndiet by frequency interaction (p < .001) indicating that\nthe effect of diet on Peak I latency is frequency-\ndependent.\nThe 30 mg Fe/g IDD that did not reduce AN ferritin\nlevels also was not associated with any significant latency\nchanges in any peaks measured (Figure 3(b), Table 2).\nOffspring in the 20 mg Fe/g IDD group displayed sig-\nnificant latency defects in a frequency specific manner.\nSpecifically, PI latency was increased by 5% to 10% at\n8 kHz and 16 kHz compared with both the IS group and\nthe 30 mg Fe/g IDD group. In this group, the latency\ndefects were restricted to Peak I, except for Peak V at 8\nand 32 kHz (which were slightly [7\u00ad8%] increased) but\ndid not result in increased PV to PI interpeak latencies\n(Table 2) because of the proportional increase in PI\nlatency (Figure 3(b)).\nOffspring in the 6 mg Fe/g diet group displayed signifi-\ncantly increased PI latency by 15% to 27% at all three\nstimulus frequencies compared with all other groups\n(p < .05) (Figure 3(b)). In addition to the anemia induced\nby the 6 mg Fe/g IDD, the absolute latencies of Peaks II to\nV were significantly increased by 18% to 36% depending\non the peak and stimulus frequency. The 6 mg Fe/g IDD\nalso significantly increased the interpeak latency of PII to\nI, indicating some disruption in the myelination status of\nthe AN, as well as increased PV to I latencies indicating\nan overall defect in brainstem maturation (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nAlthough ID is a persistent public health problem and its\nimpact on the developing CNS has been acknowledged,\nthe lack of insight into the time period during which the\nfetus was exposed to ID makes it challenging to predict or\ndiagnose the severity of CNS maturation defects\n(Idjradinata and Pollitt, 1993; Lozoff and Georgieff,\nor cord blood hematological parameters give an indica-\ntion of the acute status of iron availability in blood but\nare not useful to determine the time of onset of ID or the\nCNS tissue iron levels. The analysis of the ABR profile\nhas been used as a surrogate functional readout that is\nintended to report the maturation state of the brain;\nhowever, conflicting results in the context of ID have\nraised questions as to the strength of influence that ID\nimparts on the ABR response. A partial answer to this\nquestion is provided by our previous study (Mihaila\net al., 2011), where we show in rats that if exposure to\nID occurs during the later stages of pregnancy, the ABR\nremains normal in the offspring, even if the offspring is\nhighly anemic and displays a low birth weight. In con-\ntrast, the ABR was significantly affected if the ID\nFigure 3. Peak 1 neuronal conduction velocity by ABR analysis in\nP40 offspring fed variable IDDs.

As that study was designed to induce anemia in all\noffspring, it was impossible to clearly separate the impact\nof iron depletion from the impact of acute anemia, a\nquestion we approached in our previous study by Lee\net al (2012). There we showed in a different rat strain\nthat lifetime exposure to marginal ID was associated\nwith morphological and functional defects of the AN\nand results in impaired ABR responses specifically in\nthe absolute latency of Peak I. The limitation of this\nstudy was, however, that we only induced a very mild\nnon anemic ID in the offspring.\nAs our two previous studies and additional published\nreports from others are not directly comparable due to\ndifferent rat strains and diets, the goal of the present\nstudy was hence to determine whether the ABR could\nbe utilized to detect the threshold of tissue ID in offspring\nexposed to lifetime ID ranging from mild to severe. This\nstudy revealed several novel findings: (a) ABR latency is\nimpaired by mild ID that is initiated early in pregnancy\nand sustained during development even at levels that\nnever reach a state of clinical ID anemia in the offspring.\n(b) The severity of biochemical responses to progressive\niron restriction does not appear to follow a linear rela-\ntionship and may indicate a dietary threshold for induc-\ntion of anemia. (c) The profile of ABR latency defects\nresulting from moderate AN tissue ID is localized pri-\nmarily to Peak I, in contrast to the broad multipeak\nlatency defects generated by acute anemia occurring\nduring this window of vulnerability. Taken together,\nthese data might be relevant to humans in that they sug-\ngest that ABR latency defects in infants may indicate\nexposure to maternal ID that is initiated during the\nearly stages of gestation and sustained during develop-\nment. Perhaps even more important, the data also indi-\ncate that the absence of anemia in infants might not\npredict the absence of ID-induced maturation defects.\nA novel aspect of our study is the systematic analysis\nof the biochemical progression of ID in an ABR relevant\ntissue. As the AN is too small to conduct mass spectros-\ncopy for elementary Fe content, we used tissue ferritin as\na surrogate marker for iron homeostasis. Several studies\nsupport that ferritin levels are a sensitive and specific\nmarker of CNS iron homeostasis, and reliably decrease\nto facilitate the release of available cellular Fe stores (Han\nhematological parameters and AN tissue iron status\nrevealed some unexpected results. We were surprised by\nthe disconnection between HCT, HGB, and tissue ferritin\nlevels in the 30 mg Fe/g IDD; during the typical progres-\nsion of ID toward persistent anemia, tissue ferritin levels\nare usually depleted prior to any observed changes in\nTable 2.

This disconnect might suggest that these\nslight hematological changes were not related to\ndecreased iron availability but were a result of a slight\ndelay in blood volume expansion to accompany the sig-\nnificant growth spurts that occur in weanling rats during\nthis time (Eisen, 1976). This possibility is consistent with\nthe observation that the decreases in HCT and HGB were\nmild and transient with a complete recovery by P40 with-\nout any supplementation and that no statistically signifi-\ncant differences were observed in postnatal growth\nbetween the two midlevel ID and the IS diet group.\nThe 20 mg Fe/g iron diet had an identical hemato-\nlogical profile as the 30 mg Fe/g but produced significantly\nlower ferritin levels in the AN. This might suggest that\nthe threshold for maintaining iron saturation of the AN\nlies below 30 ppm dietary Fe and represents a tissue\nspecific iron requirement. We have previously shown\nthat ID affects the CNS in a highly region specific\nmanner with some regions displaying far less sensitivity\nto iron depletion than others (Greminger et al., 2014).\nInterestingly, the ferritin levels remained constant over\ntime despite a continuous 20 mg Fe/g iron diet, suggesting\nthat the AN ferritin levels are relatively resilient to iron\ndepletion.\nIn light of the ferritin profile in the 6 mg Fe/g, it seems\nthat the threshold between AN tissue ID and anemia lies\nbetween 20 and 6 mg Fe/g dietary iron. It needs to be\nstressed that results of the 6 mg Fe/g diet may actually\nunderestimate the effect of anemia on the ABR in the\nLong-Evans rat strain, as approximately 50% of the off-\nspring in this diet group did not survive to the testing age,\nremoving the most severely affected rats from our ana-\nlysis and likely attenuating the latency defect. A limita-\ntion of our study here is that we focused on the most\nfrequently used HCT and HGB values to relate the per-\nipheral state of ID to the iron status in the AN. We can\nthus not exclude the possibility that serum ferritin or\ntransferrin levels would have provided a better peripheral\nsurrogate measurement for AN maturation defects than\nHCT and HGB. While outside the scope of this study, it\nwill be important in future studies to examine suitable\nsurrogate measurement that more reliably predict CNS\ntissue iron levels.\nOur result on the impact of various levels of ID on the\nABR response also raises the question of the underlying\n``anatomical locus'' of pathology that results in impaired\nABR responses. While the ABR profiles allow exclusion\nof cochlea defects on the level of haircell function, we\ncannot deduct from our study which anatomical defect\ncontributed to the Peak I latency impairments in the bor-\nderline versus severe ID diet. On the basis of our previous\nthat the underlying pathology in the borderline diet is due\nto a defect in axon maturation with no impairment in\nmyelination. In contrast, the underlying pathology for\nPeak I latency in the more severe anemia inducing diet\nmight contain an additional component of defective\nmyelination.\nIn summary, our study suggests that lifetime exposure\nto ID results in impaired ABR. The severity of the ABR\nimpairment seems to reflect the severity of the ID, which\nin our study ranged from borderline ID to systemic\nanemia. The impact of even mild ID on the ABR is of\nparticular clinical concern as mild ID without reaching\nstages of anemia might go undetected. As the CNS tissue\nID in infants is difficult to deduct and commonly used\nhematological parameters do not reliably reflect CNS\niron levels, we suggest that ABR analysis might be a\nuseful tool to retrospectively determine whether an\ninfant might have been exposed to ID during gestation\neven if no signs of maternal of infant anemia can be\nestablished.\nSummary\nIron deficiency significantly impacts neuronal function in\nthe absence of persistent anemia.
