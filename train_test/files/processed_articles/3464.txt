    "abstract": "Abstract\n``Big Data'' in health and medicine in the 21st century differs from ``Big Data'' used in health and medicine in the 1700s\nand 1800s. However, the old data sets share one key component: large numbers. The term ``Big Data'' is not synonymous\nwith large numbers. Large numbers are a key component of Big Data in health and medicine, both for understanding the\nfull range of how a disease presents in a human for diagnosis, and for understanding if one treatment of a disease is better\nthan another treatment or better than just leaving the patient on his or her own without therapy. In this paper, we\nexamine the first considerations of Big Data in medicine in Paris in the early 1800s when urologic surgeon Jean Civiale\ncollected the first large numbers. Civiale collected the large numbers to defend the efficacy of his urologic instrument,\nthe lithotrite, and the surgical procedure he developed, lithotrity, for the removal of bladder stones compared with\nearlier, more invasive surgical approaches. We examine how large numbers were adjudicated in social decision-making in\nthe Acade\n\u00b4mie des sciences, Paris, when a dispute arose among French urologic surgeons about the importance of large\nnumbers in surgical science. After Civiale's successful defense of his instrument and procedure in Paris, we examine how\nhis approach to Big Data (large numbers) impacted data collection by George Buchanan in his use of the procedure at the\nRoyal Hospital Infirmary in Glasgow.\n",

In 1755,\nThomas Simpson commented on the need for large\nnumbers in astronomical observations:\nIt is well known that the method practiced by astron-\nomers, to diminish the errors arising from the imper-\nfections of instruments, and of the organs of sense, by\ntaking the mean of several observations, has not been\nso generally received, but that some persons of note\nhave publicly maintained, that one single observation,\ntaken with due care, was as much to be relied on, as the\nmean of a great number.\nSimpson (1755) further argued that ``the more obser-\nvations of experiments there are made, the less will the\nconclusion be liable to err, provided they admit of\nbeing repeated under the same circumstances.''\nIn 1837, Simeon Denis Poisson, also an astronomer\nbut foremost a statistician interested in applying prob-\nabilistic models to data outside of astronomy, developed\nhis law of large numbers and encouraged surgeons of his\nday to study large numbers of patients. This was neces-\nsary in probability and statistics, as Simpson (1755)\nnotes, ``. . . to diminish the error arising from the imper-\nfections of instruments, and of the organs of sense.'' We\nare interested in the examination of the first large data\nsets used in surgery and of how the Acade\n\u00b4 mie des\nsciences used ``Big Data'' in France in the 1800s.\nSurgeons have a long history of accumulation of\nsurvival versus mortality data in the use of new surgical\ninstruments and procedures for operations. This is par-\nticularly true in the military, as many new instruments\nand procedures are invented and used for the first time\nin wartime (Vekerdy, 2005), for example, involving bal-\nlistic trauma to the abdomen (Mahoney et al., 2005)\nand temporary vascular shunts in damage control in\nwartime vascular injury (Britt et al., 2002).\nParis, developed and maintained one of the largest\ndata sets on a particular instrument (the lithotrite)\nand procedure (lithotrity) during peacetime. Early\ninstruments for the removal of small stones from the\nbladder through the urethra included the urethra-for-\nceps of Sir Astley Cooper and Sir Benjamin Brodie\n(Hawkins, 1864). Civiale studied under Dupuytren\nand won prizes from the Acade\n\u00b4 mie des sciences in\notrity procedure (Haydn, 1841). Lithotrity involved\n``bruising,'' ``crushing,'' or otherwise fragmenting a\nbladder stone for removal through the urethra without\ncutting through the bladder wall. The uniqueness of the\nlithotrity procedure was its less invasive nature in\nremoving stones from the bladder compared with lith-\notomy (cutting through the bladder wall) (Herr, 2009;\nCiviale's data set\nAs a surgeon with a new surgical instrument and a new\nprocedure, Civiale kept track of his urologic cases that\ndistinguished his instrument and procedure from his\npredecessors and contemporaries. This approach was\na necessity in Paris in the early 1800s, as the\nAcade\n\u00b4 mie des sciences had a strong role as an adjudi-\ncator of disputes among physicians and surgeons\nregarding the assessment of newly developed surgical\ninstruments and procedures aimed at replacing older\ninstruments and procedures for the same or similar\nsurgical problem.\nIn its role as an adjudicator of disputes among phys-\nicians and surgeons, the Acade\n\u00b4 mie des sciences served\nan early regulatory function in French society by bring-\ning the typical ``physician versus physician'' and\n``surgeon versus surgeon'' disputes before experts com-\nmissioned by the academy. In the case of the Civiale\ninstrument, the lithotrite, and his procedure, lithotrity,\nCiviale had what were then considered to be large num-\nbers at hand to defend his procedure. The Acade\n\u00b4 mie\ndes sciences selected experts to evaluate Civiale's pro-\ncedure, including those from the field involved in the\ndispute and Poisson, the main statistical expert of\nthe time.\nPoisson, although first interested in the develop-\nment, refinement, and application of mathematical\nmodels to the prediction of the orbits of the planets,\nalso recognized that these mathematical models could\nbe used in other realms of government in a variety of\nways. Yet, Civiale's numbers in terms of his own per-\nsonal data, supported by data from urologists across\nEurope, demonstrated that his less invasive procedure,\nlithotrity, had a much lower relative risk of the patient\ndying than lithotomy in all its forms, including the\nMarian operation, the Allarton operation, and others\nJacobson's and Heurteloup's instruments to break\ndown the stone were replacing Civiale's method of per-\nforating (drilling) of the stone in the bladder. Also, the\noperations and the instruments themselves were becom-\ning more simplified and lithotrity was replacing the ear-\nlier complicated apparatuses. At the time, problem\npatients were men with prostatic hypertrophy that\nwould either have retained fragments of the stone in\nthe bladder or have fragments lodged in the prostatic\nportion of the urethra.\nParisian urological surgeons disparaged Civiale's\ninstrument and procedure and took their case to the\nAcade\n\u00b4 mie des sciences for adjudication and evaluation\nthat lithotrity (with an instrument inserted into the\nbladder) was replacing lithotomy (the cutting of the\nbladder for stone removal in a surgical operation)\n2 Big Data & Society\nthroughout Europe, although at the time, the authors\ndid not know if the lithotrite and its procedure, lithot-\nrity, admitted to such a universal application as its\nadvocates pronounced. Civiale's data set provided the\ndata the l'Acade\n\u00b4 mie des Sciences needed to vindicate\nhis lithotrite and lithotrity as a less morbid treatment\nfor bladder stones.\nUrologist discussions of survival\nIn 1862, the British Medical Journal published a report\nfrom a hospital gazette showing that Civiale's data\nand quality of life. In terms of survival, the following\nwas noted about Civiale's cases:\nand 5 females. Of these, lithotrity has been performed\non 88; of whom, 3 have died, 79 have recovered; and in\n6 functional disturbances remain--independent, how-\never, both of the stone and of the operation.\nLithotomy has been performed on 17 patients; of\nwhom 8 are cured, 2 have fistulae remaining, and\n7 have died. The remaining 15 patients have not been\noperated on; 6 have died, and 9 are still alive.\nHowever, not only were Civiale's own patients\nincluded as data points to support his procedure,\nbut his lithotrity procedure had also gained widespread\nsupport from urologists over Europe who were collect-\ning data on their patients. Civiale added these sets to\nhis own data in his report to the Academie des\nsciences. Belinaye (1837) notes that with lithotomy,\npatients died.\nGlasgow urologist's commentary on\nCiviale's data set and Buchanan's\ndata set in Glasgow\nGeorge Buchanan (1868), a surgeon and lecturer on\nClinical Surgery at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, gives an\ninsight into how data from one country become incor-\nporated into surgical practice in the 1800s. Buchanan\nnotes that the lithotrity procedure was not used exten-\nsively in Glasgow for the following reasons: cost of the\ninstrument; and once a lithotrite had been donated, the\nsurgeon's lack of experience and a lack of understand-\ning of which patients would most benefit from lithotrity\nover lithotomy. Buchanan then notes that once an\nexpert surgeon demonstrated the use of the lithotrite\nand the procedure, its use increased. For Buchanan,\nthe additional reason why data are not accumulated\nin large data sets is that no qualified person was willing\nto take the time to put the data together in a data set\nfor analysis and interpretation.\nIn his 1868 paper, Buchanan also described the\nproblems in patient selection for lithotrity in terms of\ncharacteristics of stone (size, difficulty in crushing, and\nthe shape of the resultant fragments to be removed\nfrom the bladder through the urethra with the litho-\ntrite); the characteristics of the patient and his anatomy\n(degree of debility, presence of stricture, presence of an\nenlarged prostate, atony of the bladder, and chronic\ncystitis); and the general health and age of the patient.\nGiven the importance of patient characteristics in deter-\nmining patient risk, Buchanan further notes the follow-\ning about the relative mortality of the two surgical\nprocedures (surgery versus lithotrity): ``It is almost\nimpossible to come to anything like an accurate result\n[of the chance of the patient's survival] by taking num-\nbers only; still, by taking a very extensive survey, an\napproximation to truth may be made.'' In a pamphlet\npublished in 1880, Buchanan notes that mortality with\nthe performance of lithotrity in his hands was ``1 death\nin 7\u00bd cases for all ages, and 1 in 16\u00bd in children under\n15 years.'' But Buchanan did not list the total number\nof procedures he had personally performed in patients\nwith bladder stones.\nCiviale's procedure and his supporting\nnumerical data as reviewed by the\nAcade\n\u00b4mie des sciences\nIn terms of Civiale's patient numbers, 5443 patients\nunderwent surgery for removal of the bladder\nstone(s), and 245 patients underwent Civiale's lithotrity\nprocedure. The Acade\n\u00b4 mie des sciences commissioned\nPoisson et al. (1835) to evaluate Civiale's data.\nTro\ntype of presentation of data by a surgeon to an\naugust body of experts--Poisson, an expert statistician;\nDulong, a physician-chemist; Larrey, a great military\nsurgeon who was Napoleon's surgeon; and Double, a\nrepresentative of the medical establishment--was a\nunique form of peer review for Civiale's era. These\nevaluators noted that these numbers were ``all supplied\nby the practice of the greatest surgeons alive.''\nPhysicians in Civiale's era considered the set of 5443\u00fe\npatient cases a large number. Even though the reported\nnumbers were large, derived from experts across\nEurope, and considered even today as ``hard data''\n(survival and mortality data (Boivin, 2014)), the\nAcade\n\u00b4 mie des sciences subjected Civiale's data to rigor-\nous review.\nPoisson et al. (1835) noted that these comparative\ncalculations were not made on very accurate bases\n(retrospective review of reported cases); therefore,\nthey could not take the place of science. In addition, the\nexpert reports lacked details of how the expert urolo-\ngists carried out the assessments. Thus, for the\nAcade\n\u00b4 mie des sciences, these reports fell short of the\ngoal of determining the numerical proportions of mor-\ntality after incision with any degree of accuracy. Yet,\nthe commission commended Civiale for recognizing\nboth the importance of large numbers and many of\nthe problems interpreting large numbers, especially\nwhen those large numbers involved a compilation of\ndata sets from different urologic surgeons. The\nAcade\n\u00b4 mie des sciences concluded that Civiale's work\ncomparing surgical approaches (surgery versus lithot-\nrity) was moving in the right direction. In the commis-\nsion's report on Civiale's data, Civiale was encouraged\n``to pursue his statistical research to increase the\nvolume of data, and to provide more circumstantial\ndetail to make it more conclusive. . .''\nDifferent views on importance of\nCiviale's data: Surgeon versus historian\nversus statistician\nAs noted by Buchanan, surgeons of Civiale's day were\nalready interested in both mortality data and other\ndata, such as the demographics of the patient that\nmade a procedure like lithotrity more or less suitable\nto be undertaken. From a historian's perspective,\nTro\n\u00a8 hler (2001) argues that Civiale's report on his litho-\ntrite and lithotrity procedure presented to the\nAcade\n\u00b4 mie des sciences in 1835 was part of a formal\nevaluation of Civiale's numbers. This evaluation by\nurologic surgeons and Poisson, as a participant evalu-\nator, needs to be viewed in ``the context of a contest in\ncontemporary French medical literature about the\napplicability of `statistics' to `medicine''' (Tro\n\u00a8 hler,\n2001). However, Civiale's numbers on the relative mor-\ntality of his lithotrity procedure versus lithotomy (cyst-\notomy) were so good from a mortality reduction\nstandpoint that expert urologists throughout Europe\nadopted the lithotrity procedure in their own practice\nand continued with the procedure based on their own\nclinical experience with both lithotomy and lithotrity.\nCiviale's data set on bladder stone removal was the\nmost extensive of its day, and his less invasive proced-\nure of lithotrity and his instrument (which other urolo-\ngists in France and around Europe used quickly and\nimproved upon readily) continued to develop over time.\nEven Civiale started using Heurteloup's instruments in\nhis lithotrity practice.\nSummary and conclusions\nCiviale had the large numbers necessary for statistical\nanalysis, yet the success of his lithotrity procedure was\nits reduced invasiveness over lithotomy as recognizable\nwithout the need for a statistic. Buchanan, a professor\nof surgery, was interested in clarifying how deaths\ncould be misattributed in such large data sets.\nUrologic surgeons showed strong understanding of\nhow numbers could be used in comparing surgical pro-\ncedures on key parameters like age and death,\nwell ahead of physicians comparing treatments in the\nmedical domain.\nThe impetus for consideration of large numbers in\nhealth and medical decision-making in the 1800s rested\non surgeons' collections of survival and mortality data\non the new instruments they developed and the new\nprocedures they invented. Internal medicine physicians\nand psychiatrists lagged behind in this era of large num-\nbers but caught up, as France's adoption of hospital-\nbased care allowed not only postmortem examination\nbut also the in-hospital recording of patients' histories,\nsymptoms, signs, and physical examination findings\nbefore they died and went to postmortem examination.\nRobert Koch did not discover the tuberculosis bacil-\nlus until the end of the 1800s, and it was a while before\nphysicians recognized this bacillus as one cause of many\ncases of phthisis that had ravaged Europe and the rest\nof the world through preceding generations. In health\nand medicine, for physicians other than surgeons, the\nimportance of large numbers only started to be appre-\nciated in the 1800s, even though mathematicians saw\ntheir need in society much earlier. But even the statis-\nticians of the day, like Poisson, saw the application of\nstatistics, not so much in health and medicine, but more\nso in prediction in the courts and the law. Thus, the\nappreciation of large numbers in internal medicine and\npsychiatry would be further delayed. Physicians need\nlarge numbers as a key component of Big Data for\ntwo purposes: to understand the full range of the\nways a disease may present in a human and to compare\none treatment of a disease against another treatment in\npatients.\nToday, the term ``lithotripsy'' (synonymous with\nlithotrity in Civiale's day) dominates the urologic\nresearch literature and urologists are crushing concre-\nments in the urinary tract through lithotripsy (rather\nthan surgery). Instead of a lithotrite, urologists study-\ning various crushing procedures for stones in the urin-\nary system are comparing instruments like the holmium\nlaser versus the ultrasound probe. For example,\nJako\nwho underwent endoscopic lithotripsy. Of these, 98\nwere treated with a holmium laser and 66 with an ultra-\nsound probe. Before surgery, all patients underwent\nurological ultrasound and radiological imaging to\nlocalize the stone, and the effectiveness was measured\nusing radiological and renal ultrasound imaging. An\neffective state was reached if the stone was invisible\n4 Big Data & Society\nby radiograph and ultrasound imaging after the\nprocedure.\nLaser lithotripsy was 100% effective in the bladder\nin the ureters. Using an ultrasound probe, the proced-\nlaser lithotripsy, two of the patients were found to have\ninflammatory changes of the ureter which necessitated\nundergoing open surgery. A third patient sustained a\nperforation of the ureter with laser lithotripsy. The\nauthors concluded the following: ``The results prove\nthat laser lithotripsy is a method of high effectiveness\nwith a low risk of complication. It might surpass sono-\ntrode and become its alternative. Both methods have\nboth advantages and disadvantages.''\nToday, regional studies are being conducted to iden-\ntify and explain inconsistencies to formulate best prac-\ntice patterns for use in clinical urology across regions of\na country or across countries. Brown et al. (2014) con-\nducted one such study in the United States to evaluate\nsuch regional differences in shockwave lithotripsy. The\nresearchers examined a prospectively maintained data-\nbase retrospectively and evaluated regional differences\nacross four distinct American geographic regions invol-\nving 2240 procedures. The authors found regional dif-\nferences in all parameters. In their conclusions, the\nresearchers state: ``Inconsistencies in regional adapta-\ntion of best practices may identify opportunities for\nfurther education.''\nThe most notable differences in the reporting of pro-\ncedures of the urologic sciences today compared with\nthe urologic sciences of the 1800s are the safety of\npatients and study participants and the care with\nwhich data is analyzed statistically. Two factors medi-\nate the need for large numbers in research studies in\nurology today: the primary factor is the need to protect\nstudy participants by not exposing them to unnecessary\nrisks (Mazur, 2007), and the second factor is the need to\nstudy a large enough group of patients to yield statis-\ntically significant results.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe author declares that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\nBelinaye HG (1837) Compendium of Lithotripsy.
