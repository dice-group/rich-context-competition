    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nGenes responsible for generating circadian oscillations are\nexpressed in a variety of brain regions not typically\nassociated with circadian timing. The functions of this clock\ngene expression are largely unknown, and in the present\nstudy we sought to explore the role of the Per2 (Period 2)\ngene in hippocampal physiology and learned behaviour. We\nfound that PER2 protein is highly expressed in hippocampal\npyramidal cell layers and that the expression of both\nprotein and mRNA varies with a circadian rhythm. The\npeaks of these rhythms occur in the late night or early\nmorning and are almost 180\u00b0 out-of-phase with the\nexpression rhythms measured from the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus of the same animals. The rhythms in Per2\nexpression are autonomous as they are present in isolated\nhippocampal slices maintained in culture. Physiologically,\nPer2-mutant mice exhibit abnormal long-term potentia-\ntion. The underlying mechanism is suggested by the finding\nthat levels of phosphorylated cAMP-response-element-\nbinding protein, but not phosphorylated extracellular-\nsignal-regulated kinase, are reduced in hippocampal tissue\nfrom mutant mice. Finally, Per2-mutant mice exhibit\ndeficits in the recall of trace, but not cued, fear\nconditioning. Taken together, these results provide evid-\nence that hippocampal cells contain an autonomous\ncircadian clock. Furthermore, the clock gene Per2 may play\na role in the regulation of long-term potentiation and in\nthe recall of some forms of learned behaviour.\n",

These types of observations suggest that\nthere may be a fundamental interaction between learning\nand memory processes and the circadian system.\nIn mammals, neurons responsible for the generation and\nco-ordination of circadian rhythms are located in the SCN\n(suprachiasmatic nucleus) in the hypothalamus. These cells\npossess anatomical, physiological and molecular specializa-\ntions that allow them to perform these functions. At the\nmolecular level, a set of interacting transcriptional/trans-\nlational feedback loops are responsible for the generation of\nthese circadian oscillations (Reppert and Weaver, 2002; Ko\nand Takahashi, 2006). One of the key genes involved in this\nmolecular timing system is the Period2 gene (Per2).\nMutations in Per2 shorten the fundamental frequency of\ncircadian oscillations and cause the eventual loss of\nXu et al., 2007). In humans, mutations in hPer2 (human Per2)\nare associated with alterations in the timing of the sleep/\nPrevious evidence demonstrates that clock genes, including\nPer2, are widely expressed in peripheral organs as well as in\nmammals, these circadian-related genes are found in brain\nregions critical to learned behaviours including the hip-\nand the ventral tegmental area (McClung et al., 2005). The\nfunctions served by these genes outside of the SCN are just\nbeginning to be examined. Therefore, in the present study, we\nstarted with the careful description of the circadian\nregulation of levels of Per2 mRNA and protein in the\nhippocampus and SCN of the same animals. We then used an\noptical reporter of PER expression in order to determine\nwhether the circadian rhythm could be measured in the\nisolated hippocampus. Finally, the presence of Per2 in the\nhippocampus, and the rich literature implicating this\nstructure in learned behaviours (Squire, 1992), led us to\ncarry out a set of experiments designed to explore the role of\nPer2 in hippocampal physiology and learned behaviour.\nAnimals\nIn all studies, we followed guidelines from the National\nInstitutes of Health, and regulations for animal use prescribed\nby the UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) Division of\nLaboratory Animals or the Committee on Animal Care and Use\nat The Scripps Research Institute. For the gene expression\nstudies, we obtained C57 Bl/6 mice from breeding colonies at\nUCLA. Animals in the day group were placed in chambers\nAnimals in the night group were placed in a reversed LD\n(light/dark) cycle where lights were on at 22:00 hours and off\nat 10:00 hours. These mice are placed in this reversed LD cycle\nupon weaning at 14\u00ad21 days of age and were then\nmaintained on this LD cycle until they were used in the\nexperiments at 4\u00ad6 months of age. For analysis of locomotor\nactivity patterns, male mice were housed individually and\ntheir wheel-running activity recorded as revolutions per 3\nmin intervals. The running wheels and data acquisition\nsystems were obtained from the Mini Mitter Company. The\nand then placed into constant darkness (termed DD) for 2\nweeks prior to assessing their free-running activity pattern.\nAll handling of animals was carried out either in the light\nportion of the LD cycle or in DD with the aid of an IR viewer\n(Night Optics).\nMale Per2-mutant (Zheng et al., 1999) and age-matched\nWT (wild-type) mice were obtained from Jackson\nLaboratories. The mice were genotyped at Jackson\nLaboratories prior to shipment to UCLA. The Per2-mutant\nmice contain a point mutation (G-to-T transversion) in the\nPer2 gene that leads to the generation of PER2 protein\ncontaining an 87-amino-acid deletion. These mice were\nbackcrossed for 5\u00ad6 generations into the C57 line and thus\nmutant mice can be found at http://www.informatics.jax.org.\nAnimals in the day group were placed in chambers where\nin the night group were placed in a reversed LD cycle where\nwere allowed to entrain to the LD cycle for at least 2 months\nprior to experimentation. For analysis of locomotor activity\npatterns, male mice were housed individually and their\nwheel-running activity recorded as revolutions per 3 min\nintervals. The running wheels and data acquisition systems\nwere obtained from the Mini Mitter Company.\nFor bioluminescence imaging experiments, we used both\nPer2::LUC and Per2::LUC-SV40 mice. In these knockin mice,\nthe endogenous Per2 gene is replaced by a fusion of Per2 and\nthe firefly luciferase gene (luc+), such that an Per2::LUC\nfusion protein is expressed, reflecting both transcriptional\nand post-transcriptional regulation of the Per2 locus (Yoo et\nidentical, except that the targeting construct for the\nPer2::LUC-SV40 strain contains an SV40 polyadenylation site\nafter luciferase, resulting in ,30% brighter luminescence in\ncultured cells (DK Welsh, unpublished data).\nIHC (immunohistochemistry)\nMice were anaesthetized and perfused with PBS followed by\n4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS.

Sections were then washed again in\nPBS (three times), dipped in 10% normal goat serum in PBS\nfor 2 h, and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit\nanti-PER2 antiserum (Alpha Diagnostics) in PBS at 4\u00b0C\novernight. Sections were washed in PBS (three times), then\nincubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody at\n(three times) and dipped in AB solution (Vector Labortories)\nfor 1 h, washed again in PBS, then placed in filtered 0.05%\n. After sufficient colour reaction (2\u00ad3 min),\nsections were washed with PBS and mounted on slides\nimmediately. Sections were then dried overnight, washed\nwith water for 10 min, dehydrated with ascending concen-\ntrations of ethanol, and cover-slipped. Images were captured\nwith Axio Vision camera systems (Carl Zeiss). Blocking\nexperiments, performed by adding the PER2 peptide (1 mg/\nsolution, prevented PER2 staining. A fixed brain from a Per2-\nnull mouse (Per2KO#6128) was provided by Dr David Weaver\n(University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA,\nU.S.A.).\nWe defined the hippocampus [CA1 (where CA is cornu\nammonis), CA2, CA3, DG (dentate gyrus)] and SCN by using\nCresyl-Violet-stained mouse brains as a reference. For each\nmouse, images were captured from each of these three\nregions using a SPOT camera system (Diagnostic Instruments).\nThree tissue sections from each region (CA1, CA2, CA3 and\nDG) were chosen at random and images taken. The\nrepresentative sections were obtained from at least three\nanimals. All immunopositive cells within the hippocampus\nand SCN of these regions were counted manually at\nimmunopositive cells within the grid were counted equally\nwithout regard to the intensity of the staining. Counts were\nperformed by two observers blinded to the treatment\nprotocol and the results were averaged.\nFor fluorescence IHC, mice were anaesthetized and\nperfused with PBS followed by 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde\nin PBS. Brains were dissected, post-fixed at 4\u00b0C overnight, and\ncryoprotected in 20% sucrose in PBS. Fluorescence IHC was\nperformed simultaneously on free-floating 20-mm cryostat\ncoronal brain sections of mice. Sections were washed for 10\nmin with PBS. Sections were dipped in 3% normal goat serum\nwith an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised\nwith a solution of Triton X-100/PBS with 3% normal goat\nserum. Sections were incubated with the primary antibody for\n72 h at 4\u00b0C. Sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated for 2 h\nwith an Alexa FluorH 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen),\nserum. Next, sections were washed with PBS and incubated\nPBS. After incubation, sections were rinsed in PBS and\nimmediately mounted on slides. Sections were then dried and\ncoverslipped. Then, sections were imaged on the Zeiss\nMETA laser-scanning confocal microscope system.\nWestern blot analysis\nWhole hippocampus was flash frozen in 500 ml of ice-cold\nsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.01%\nTriton X-100 and 4 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate]. The\nhomogenization buffer also contained cocktails of protease\ninhibitors (Protease Inhibitors Complete; Roche Molecular\nBiochemicals) and protein phosphatase inhibitors (Protein\nPhosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail I and II; Sigma\u00adAldrich). The\ntissue was homogenized with an ultrasonic cell disruptor\n(three times for 5 s each). Immediately after homogenization,\naliquots were removed for protein analysis, and equal\namounts of denaturing protein loading buffer [0.5 M Tris/\nmercaptoethanol and Bromophenol Blue] were added. These\nhomogenates were kept on ice for ,45 min while protein\nconcentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad Protein\nAssay Kit. Homogenates containing 20\u00ad30 mg of protein each\nwere electrophoresed on SDS/PAGE (15% gels), transferred on\nto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with various\nDiagnostics), tubulin, p-ERK (phosphorylated extracellular-\nsignal-regulated kinase), total ERK, p-CREB (phosphorylated\ncAMP-response-element-binding protein) and total CREB (all\nfrom Millipore). The membranes were incubated with HRP\n(horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-\nrabbit secondary IgG (1:1000), and protein signals were\nvisualized by chemiluminescence (Immun-Star HRP detection\nkit; Bio-Rad). A phosphorimager was used for quantification,\nand day/night comparisons were analysed simultaneously,\nusing identical settings. Protein bands were boxed, and the\nintegrated intensity of all the pixels within that band was\ncalculated above object average background levels of a box of\nthe same size. Percentage changes attributable to temporal\nvariation were calculated relative to the absorbance of the\ncorresponding untreated protein bands within a single\nexperiment, and Student's t tests were used to assess\nstatistical significance. To quantify changes in p-ERK\ncompared with total ERK or p-CREB compared with total\nCREB protein expression, protein from the same hippocampal\nsamples were run simultaneously and probed with either p-\nERK or total ERK and p-CREB or total CREB. To control for\npotential variations in loading, the absorbance of bands for\neach protein of interest were first normalized to the\nabsorbance values obtained for tubulin loading control bands\nin each lane. Tubulin absorbance values did not vary as a\nfunction of time when mice were held in an LD cycle [ZT\nPer2 in the hippocampus: expression and function\nE 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nvalues were then expressed as a percentage of the levels seen\nin control (day) samples or as a ratio of phospho/total ERK or\nCREB protein expression.\nISH (in situ hybridization)\nA plasmid (pCRII; Invitrogen) containing the cDNA for Per2\nprovided by Dr David Weaver (University of Massachusetts\nMedical School, Worcester, MA, U.S.A.) and insert identity was\nconfirmed by sequencing using the M13R primer. To generate\nantisense and sense templates for ISH, plasmids were\nlinearized overnight, phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol\nprecipitated and resuspended in DEPC (diethyl pyrocarbo-\nnate)-treated water.

To further reduce non-specific hybridization, the\nslides were washed twice in 26SSC at 37\u00b0C, and for 1 h in\nethanol containing 0.3 M ammonium acetate and exposed\nto Kodak Biomax MR film (Kodak) along with a 14C slide\nstandard (American Radiolabeled Chemicals). Following the\ninitial exposure, the slides were emulsion-dipped (NTB;\nKodak), dried and stored in a desiccated, lightproof\ncontainer for 14 days. Emulsion-dipped sections were\ndeveloped in D19 developer (Kodak), fixed (Fixer; Kodak),\nand then counterstained with 0.04% Thionin dye to serve as\na reference. Densitometric analysis of hybridization intens-\nity was performed as described using NIH (National\nInstitutes of Health) image software (Shearman et al.,\nBrain slice culture\nHippocampal and cerebellar slices were obtained from 4- to\n5-day-old mice in a colony maintained on an LD cycle (12 h/\nperformed at mid-day, during the light portion of the LD\ncycle. Hippocampi were separated manually from 400 mm\ncoronal brain slices, including a small portion of cingulate\ncortex. Slices were cultured in Hepes-buffered, air-equili-\nbrated DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GIBCO\n,\nluciferin (BioSynth). Each brain slice was cultured on a\nMillicell-CM membrane insert (Fisher PICMORG50), and\nplaced in a 35-mm culture dish containing 1 ml of medium.\nThe dish was covered by a 40-mm circular coverslip (Erie\nScientific), sealed in place with vacuum grease to prevent\nevaporation.\nMeasurement of bioluminescence\nTo monitor circadian rhythms of bioluminescence, we placed\nthe dishes in a luminometer (Actimetrics) which fitted inside\na standard tissue culture incubator kept at 36\u00b0C, 0% CO2\n.\nLuminescence from each dish was measured by a photo-\nmultiplier tube for ,70 s at intervals of 10 min. For imaging\nof bioluminescence, one dish was sealed and placed on the\nstage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70).

Data were logged to Microsoft Excel for further\nprocessing and plotting. Luminescence intensity values were\nconverted into photons/min based on the rated quantum\nefficiency and gain of the camera.\nLuminescence time series were imported into Lumicycle\nAnalysis (Actimetrics) for rhythm analysis. In some experi-\nments we observed high initial transients of luminescence,\nand therefore we excluded the first 12 h of data from rhythm\nanalysis. A linear baseline (polynomial order51) was\nsubtracted from the data, and the subtracted data were then\nfitted to a sine wave with exponentially decaying amplitude\n(Welsh et al., 2004). Period was defined as the period of the\nbest-fit sine wave.\nField potential electrophysiology\nMethods were as previously described (Chaudhury et al.,\ninterface chamber (Fine Science Tools) and continuously\nsuperfused with oxygenated ACSF (artificial cerebrospinal\nfluid; 30\u00b0C) at 1\u00ad3 ml/min. A bipolar stimulating electrode\nwas placed in the stratum radiatum in the CA1 region of the\nhippocampus to stimulate presynaptic fibres arising from the\nCA3 pyramidal cells. The fEPSPs (field excitatory post-\npulses) were recorded in stratum radiatum of the CA1\n(dendritic) using low-resistance glass microelectrodes (5\u00ad15\nMV, filled with ACSF). Responses were filtered at 5 kHz and\ndigitized (15\u00ad25 kHz) using data acquisition and analysis\nprograms (pClamp9, Axon Instruments). Prior to beginning\neach experiment, we determined the maximal field potential\n(fEPSP) amplitude that could be evoked in each slice by\ngradually increasing the stimulation intensity until the\namplitude reached a saturating level. Next, the stimulation\nintensities that elicited field potentials with 25%, 50% and\n75% of maximal amplitude were determined and the half-\nmaximum stimulus strength was selected for recording field\npotentials every 60 s. Typically, stable baseline measurements\nwere obtained at approx. 30\u00ad45 min after placing hippo-\ncampal slices in the interface chamber. At this point post-\nsynaptic responses were recorded for at least 10 min prior to\nthe induction of LTP (long-term potentiation). To induce LTP,\na tetanizing stimulus of three high-frequency (100 Hz; 1 s\nduration; 3 min interpulse intervals) pulses was used.\nFollowing tetanus, pre-synaptic stimulation was once again\ndelivered every 60 s and the subsequent potentiated post-\nsynaptic responses were recorded for an additional 1 h. In\norder to determine evoked fEPSP, usually 1 ms of the initial\nslope of the baseline and post-tetanus responses was\nmeasured. Typically the onset of responses was approx. 2\u00ad4\nms following a negative DC stimulation. Analysis of the input/\noutput data involved measuring the initial slope of each\nresponse following a stimulation of known amplitude ranging\nfrom 0\u00ad100 mA. For LTP experiments post-tetanic responses\nwere normalized to baseline. For analysis of LTP experiments,\npost-tetanic responses were normalized to baseline as is\nstandard in this field. Possible differences in LTP were\nassessed using a repeated measures ANOVA followed by\npost-hoc pair-wise comparison with Tukey's t test. The a level\nfor all analyses was set at 0.05. In addition, the post-tetanus\nmin) and pair-wise comparisons made using Tukey's t test.\nValues were considered significantly different if P,0.05.

The chamber used for training for\nacquisition of trace-fear conditioning was a 26 cm623\ncm617 cm clear Plexiglass box with a metal grid floor for\nfoot shock delivery (Lafayette Instruments). The chamber for\nscoring of auditory cued fear was a rectangular box 50\nMcCormick vanilla extract (,0.5 ml) was painted on to one\nof the walls of the novel chamber. A computer interfaced to a\nshock stimulator and speaker delivered the auditory stimulus\n[CS (conditioned stimulus)] and shock [US (unconditioned\nstimulus)]. The auditory stimulus (tone) was generated by a\nspeaker producing white noise at 80 dB. The footshock was a\n0.5 mA AC current for 2 s. All fear-conditioning procedures\nwere carried out using ABET software (Lafayette Instruments).\nOn the training day, each subject was placed into the\nconditioning chamber and presented with two CS (white\nnoise)\u00adUS (foot shock) pairings. Each pairing was preceded\nand followed by a 2 min exploration period. For the trace-fear\nconditioning, the CS\u00adUS pairings were comprised of 30 s of\nwhite noise (CS), a 2.5 s trace interval, and a 2 s foot shock.\nFor the cued-fear conditioning, the CS\u00adUS pairings were\ncomprised of 30 s of white noise (CS) and a 2 s foot shock\nwithout the delay. The experimenter observed the mice every\n8 s during the 2 min before the first CS\u00adUS pairing and the 2\nmin after the last CS\u00adUS pairing for the presence or absence\nof freezing behaviour (absence of movement). To test short-\nterm fear recall, mice were tested at 2 h post-training. To test\nlonger-term recall, 24 h after training, subjects were\nindividually removed from their home cages (ZT 6 or ZT 18)\nand taken to a different room for the cued-fear test. This\nprocess was repeated daily for 7 days. Each subject was placed\nin the rectangular box for a total of 8 min. The first 2 min\nconsisted of baseline exploration in the absence of the CS\n(pre-cue period). During the next 6 min, the CS tone\npreviously used in training was presented (cue period).\nAfter the termination of the CS, the subject was allowed to\nexplore the novel context for an additional 60 s (post-cue\nperiod).

IHC was\nperformed in parallel on sections of the hippocampus and SCN\nfrom the same animals. The PER2 immunoreactivity was\nevident throughout the hippocampus, with expression largely\nlocalized to the pyramidal cell body layers of the CA1, CA2, CA3\nand DG (Figure 1A). The mean number of immunopositive\nneurons per hippocampal section varied with the time of day\n(Figure 1B), with peak counts found between ZT 22 and 4,\nwhereas low counts were measured between ZT 10 and 14. For\nexample, in the CA1 regions, we found 32\u00a12 (mean\u00a1S.E.M.,\nn53) immunopositive cells during the peak of expression and\ndifferences (Kruskal\u00adWallis ANOVA, P,0.01) were found in\nCA1, CA2, CA3 and DG, with the latter structure showing the\nlowest amplitude differences. In the SCN, the rhythms in PER2\nimmunoreactivity was robust, as expected (Figure 1C). Our IHC\nprotocol did not detect any positive staining in tissue from a\nPer2-null mutant mouse (Figure 1A). Other control experi-\nments in which the primary antibody was not added or the\nprimary antibody was pre-absorbed with a PER2 peptide did\nnot exhibit any positive staining (Supplementary Figure S1 at\nAnalysis with confocal microscopy indicates that the PER2\nimmunoreactivity is found in the nucleus as well as the\ncytoplasm of hippocampal cells (Supplementary Figure S2 at\nFigure 1 PER2 is rhythmically expressed in the mouse hippocampus\nSections of the brains containing the hippocampus and SCN were stained for PER2 expression using IHC. (A) IHC expression was\nlargely localized to the hippocampal regions known as CA1, CA2, CA3 and DG. The patterns of staining varied as a function of time of\nday, and examples of immunoreactivity in the peak (ZT 2) and trough (ZT 14) of the daily rhythm are shown. The weak, poorly\nlocalized staining at ZT 14 is likely to still represent positive immunolabelling. Keeping the IHC conditions constant, there was no\npositive immunoreactivity in the hippocampus of a Per2-null mutant.

These slice cultures were prepared from knockin\nmice in which the endogenous Per2 gene is replaced by a\nfusion of Per2 and the firefly luciferase gene (luc+), such that\nan Per2::LUC fusion protein is expressed, reflecting both\ntranscriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the\nPer2 locus (Yoo et al., 2004). Hippocampal slices produced\nclear circadian rhythms of PER2::LUC bioluminescence when\nFigure 4A). These rhythms peaked at ,ZT 20, i.e. ,4 h before\nlight onset in the LD cycle to which the mice had been\nentrained. This is somewhat earlier than indicated by Western\nblot analysis, consistent with the short effective half-life of\nPER2::LUC bioluminescence resulting from substrate inhibi-\ntion of the luciferase enzyme. The rhythms gradually declined\nin amplitude over several days in culture, but amplitude could\nbe restored by a medium change (results not shown), as\nreported previously for other brain regions (Abe et al., 2002).\nCerebellar slices, although producing similar mean levels of\nPER2::LUC bioluminescence, were non-rhythmic (n54; results\nnot shown).

We were\nable to discriminate a few single cells near the border of CA1\nand CA3, and observed circadian rhythms of different phases\n(Figure 4B). These results raise the possibility that autonom-\nous circadian clocks operate within the hippocampus.\nPer2-mutant mice exhibit deficits in\nhippocampal LTP\nTo determine whether Per2 may play a role in regulating\nsynaptic physiology, we examined LTP in Per2-mutant mice\n(see Supplementary Figure S3 at http://www.asnneuro.org/\nregulator, we first sought to determine the effect of\nmutations in this gene on strong LTP. This type of synaptic\nplasticity is long-lasting and has been shown to be dependent\nupon protein synthesis (Impey et al., 1996; Bekinschtein et al.,\n2007). For these experiments, we stimulated the SC (Schaffer\ncollaterals) and measured the evoked fEPSPs in the CA1\ndendritic region of hippocampal slices prepared from WT and\nPer2-mutant mice. After establishing a stable baseline, LTP was\ninduced by the delivery of three bursts of high-frequency\nintervals), after which evoked responses were recorded for 60\nmin. These experiments were carried out in the presence of 100\nmM PTX (continuous bath application) to remove any\ncontribution from GABAA\nreceptors. Using the strong tetanizing\nprotocol, the fEPSP slope of WT mice was increased to\nmin and 60 min after tetanus (n56). In contrast, the LTP traces\nfrom Per2-mutant animals showed a reduced magnitude of LTP\n(Figure 5A). The Per2-mutant mice exhibited an average fEPSP\nof the fEPSP slopes was significantly smaller than for WT when\nalso examined the impact of the loss of Per2 on the magnitude\nduration; Figure 5B). This weak protocol produces a synaptic\npotentiation that is shorter and not dependent upon protein\nsynthesis (Frey et al., 1993). There was no significant difference\nbetween LTP recorded from WT and Per2-mutant animals [WT,\nThus the impact of a mutation in Per2 was selective for the\nsynaptic potentiation evoked by the strong LTP protocol.\nPrevious work indicates that Per2 may be involved in\nregulating the amount of vesicular glutamate transporter 1\n(Yelamanchili et al., 2006) and could alter LTP indirectly\nthrough an inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission\nwithin the hippocampus. To test this possibility, we carried\nout experiments designed to determine whether there was a\ndifference in baseline-evoked fEPSP in hippocampal slices\nprepared from WT or Per2-mutant mice. For these experi-\nments, we varied the stimulus intensity and recorded the\nresulting slope to characterize the IO (input/output) rela-\ntionship for these evoked responses. A change in the gain of\nIO curve would indicate a change in sensitivity of the neuron\nto the excitatory input. No differences were found in the IO\ncurves measured for the fEPSP of the two genotypes\n(Table 1). Other electrophysiological parameters of the\nevoked responses were found not to vary significantly\nbetween the WT and mutant mice (Table 1).

To control for\npotential variations in loading, the absorbance units of bands\nfor each protein of interest were first normalized to the\nabsorbance values obtained for tubulin loading control bands\nin each lane. Normalized absorbance values were then\nexpressed as a percentage of the levels seen in WT samples\nor as a ratio of phosphorylated protein/total protein. We\nfound that the ratio of p-CREB/total CREB expression was\nsignificantly decreased in the mutant mice under baseline\nP,0.05]. This effect was selective for the CREB pathway in\nthat the ratio of phosphorylated to total ERK (p-ERK/total\nERK) in mutant mice was comparable with controls [WT,\ndecrease in CREB phosphorylation was also regionally\nselective as there were no significant changes in the p-\ncant changes in the p-CREB/total CREB ratio in the whole\nreduced in the hippocampus of Per2-mutant mice.\nPer2-mutant mice exhibit deficits in the recall of\ntrace-fear conditioning\nTo determine whether Per2 has a functional role in learning\nand memory, we tested Per2-mutant mice for deficits in the\nacquisition and recall of trace-fear conditioning. Mice were\ntrained during the day (ZT 6) or night (ZT 18) to associate an\ninitially neutral tone (CS) to a biologically relevant event, a\nfoot shock (US). A brief temporal interval or `trace' of 2.5 s\nwas placed between the tone (80 dB; 2.8 kHz) and the onset\nof the foot shock (0.5 mA; 2 s). This trace increases the\nhippocampal-dependence of the behavioural response\nfear was measured as inactivity or `freezing' after the\nstimulus. Freezing is a typical defensive response displayed\nby rodents following exposure to aversive stimuli. Once the\nassociation between the CS and US was acquired, Per2-\nmutant and C57 mice were tested once a day (ZT 6 or 18) for\nrecall, for a total of 7 days.\nWe found that Per2-mutant mice did not show deficits in\ntheir ability to acquire trace-fear learning. For example, freezing\nafter the last CS\u00adUS pairing was 52\u00a16% (n58) in the mutant\nmice compared with 50\u00a17% (n58) in WT controls. In addition,\nthe short-term ability of the Per2-mutant mice to recall the\ntrace-fear conditioning at 2 h post-training was not signifi-\ncantly different from WT controls. At 2 h post-training, Per2-\nmutant mice showed 8.8\u00a12% freezing behaviour compared\nwith 9.6\u00a12% freezing in controls (P.0.05; results not shown).\nHowever, the ability of the Per2-mutant mice to recall the fear\nconditioning at 24 h to 7 days post-training was severely\ncompromised (Figure 7A). In Per2-mutant mice trained and\ntested for recall during the day (ZT 6), recall of fear conditioning\nwas significantly decreased by the first day of testing, with\nWT animals (n58; P,0.05). By day 7 post-training, mutant mice\nexhibited freezing behaviour 4\u00a12% of the time, whereas WT\nmice exhibited freezing behaviour 20\u00a15% of the time (n56;\nP,0.05). We also examined the recall of fear conditioning in\nmice trained and tested during the night (ZT 18).

This raises the possibility that the shorter endogenous\nperiod of the mutant mice could contribute to the deficits in\nrecall, because of a greater mismatch with the 24 h period of\nthe LD cycle. We examined this possibility by holding both WT\nwhich more closely approximates the endogenous free-\nrunning period of the mutant mice. We found that Per2-\nmutant mice did not show deficits in their ability to acquire\ntrace-fear learning. For example, freezing after the last CS\u00ad\nUS pairing was 24\u00a17% (n58) in the mutant mice compared\nwith 25\u00a13% (n58) in WT controls. However, the recall of\nthe Per2-mutant mice was still significantly lower than\ncontrols (Figure 7D). Overall, our results demonstrate that the\nPer2-mutant mice exhibited deficits in the recall, but not the\nacquisition, of trace-fear conditioning.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of the present study demonstrate that the\nprincipal pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal complex\nexpress Per2 mRNA and protein. This expression is rhythmic,\nand the time of peak expression is out-of-phase with that in\nthe SCN. With these data, the hippocampus joins a growing\nlist of brain regions in which rhythms of Per expression have\nbeen described. This group includes other brain regions\ninvolved in behavioural plasticity, including the amygdala and\nthe DG (Lamont et al., 2005). This extra-SCN expression raises\nthe possibility that a variety of brain regions may be able to\ngenerate circadian oscillations. It is also possible that so-\ncalled `clock genes' such as Per2 may play functional roles as\ntranscriptional regulators independent of circadian function.\nIn this regard, the finding that Per2 expression is rhythmic\nwhen the hippocampus is isolated from the SCN in culture is\nan important observation. This finding demonstrates that the\nhippocampus is indeed capable of generating independent\ncircadian oscillations. Our results raise the possibility that\ncell-autonomous circadian clocks operate in several sub-\nregions within the hippocampus, but that cells desynchronize\nin the absence of the SCN (Welsh et al., 2004). In mammals,\nneurons in the hippocampus (the present study), olfactory\nbrain regions (Abe et al., 2002) have now been shown to\ngenerate independent oscillations in circadian gene express-\nion.\nIn the present study, we carefully describe the phase\nrelationship between Per2 expression in the hippocampus and\nSCN. We found them to be in anti-phase with each other, i.e.\nFigure 7 Per2-mutant mice exhibit severe deficits in the recall of trace-\nfear conditioning\n(A) Levels of trace-fear conditioning recall in Per2-mutant mice tested at 24\nh intervals post-training during the day (ZT 6) show severe deficits in their\nability to recall learning.

The hippocampus is one of the\nbrain regions strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of\nmood disorders (Drevets et al., 2008). The `social zeitgeber\ntheory' of depression postulates that life stresses can produce\na misalignment of the phase relationship between the central\nclock and the environment and that this misalignment could\nhave a negative impact on nervous system function and\n2007). The results of the present study highlight the\nimportance of coupling between circadian oscillators within\nthe nervous system. The fact that both the hippocampus and\nthe SCN have distinct clockwork mechanisms raise the\npossibility that desynchronization between cell populations\nwithin the nervous system may contribute to mood disorders.\nThis pool of data contributes to the view that the circadian\nsystem is comprised of multiple oscillatory components, with\nthe role of the SCN being a master timer synchronizing these\ndisparate cell populations (Stratmann and Schibler, 2006; Liu\net al., 2007). With this new view of clock genes and circadian\norganization, it becomes critical to determine the tissue-\nspecific function of these genes. Logically, local rhythms in\nclock gene expression could serve to control the temporal\nprogramme of gene expression and physiology specific to the\nhippocampus, as recently demonstrated in the liver\n(Kornmann et al., 2007). However, unfortunately, we still do\nnot know much about the functional significance of clock\ngene expression outside of the SCN.\nWe first examined the function of the clock gene Per2 in\nthe hippocampus using a physiological analysis. Synapses\nwithin the hippocampus undergo history-dependent changes\nin the strength of synaptic transmission. This synaptic\nplasticity is widely studied as a possible cellular mechanism\nof behavioural plasticity including learning and memory\n(Morris et al., 1990). While recognizing that there are\nadvantages to conditional- or regional-specific mutations;\nas a first step, we examined LTP in a line of mice containing a\nmutation that renders the PER2 protein non-functional\n(Zheng et al., 1999). We found that Per2-mutants exhibit\nreduced magnitude of LTP as measured at the SC/CA1\nsynaptic connection. Basic excitatory synaptic transmission at\nthe SC/CA1 synapse was not altered in the mutant mice. We\nfound that the Per2-mutant mice exhibited altered levels of\np-CREB, but not p-ERK. The levels of total CREB were not\nimpacted by deficiencies in Per2; only the activated state of\nthis signalling pathway was affected, as measured by\nphosphorylation. This biochemical consequence of a mutation\nin Per2 was regionally specific, as the deficit was not seen in\nSCN tissue. There is abundant evidence that CREB or CREB-\nbinding proteins play a role in some forms of LTP and long-\nWood et al., 2006). Our results raise the possibility that Per2-\nrelated deficits in intracellular signalling pathways may be an\nimportant part of the observed deficits in LTP. Interestingly,\nrecent work indicates that the levels of cAMP and MAPK\n(mitogen-activated protein kinase) activity in the hippocam-\npus exhibit circadian oscillations (Eckel-Mahan et al., 2008).\nPrevious work in Aplysia implicates the circadian gating of\nthe MAPK pathway as the mechanistic control point for\ncircadian regulation of sensitization (Lyons et al., 2006).\nRegardless of the mechanism, these are the first results\nsuggesting a link between the expression of clock genes and\nLTP. This link will need to be further pursued with other types\nof transgenic models and experimental approaches.\nGiven the deficits that we observed in synaptic plasticity\nand CREB phosphorylation, we wanted to test the perform-\nance of the Per2-mutant mice on learned behavioural tasks.\nTrace-fear conditioning is a simple, easy to learn task with\nwell-defined circuitry that includes the hippocampus (Maren\nthe Per2-mutant mice exhibited profound deficits in the\nlonger-term recall, but not in the acquisition or short-term\nrecall, of trace-fear conditioning. The Per2-mutant mice did\nnot alter performance in the acquisition or recall of cued-fear\nconditioning (Zueger et al., 2006). Previous work suggests\nthat trace-fear conditioning requires an intact medial pre-\nfrontal cortex and hippocampus, whereas cued-fear con-\nPoulos, 2005). The difference in the impact of the loss of\nfunctional PER2 on trace- compared with cued-fear con-\nditioning is at least consistent with the possibility that the\ndysfunction in hippocampal physiology and intracellular\nsignalling described above may underlie the deficits in recall.\nHowever, PER2 is a transcriptional regulator that is expressed\nin a number of brain regions and the present results do not\nallow us to specify the anatomical site responsible for the\nimpact of the loss of Per2 on trace-fear conditioning. Our\nbehavioural results do provide a clear demonstration that a\nmutation in a circadian-related gene selectively influences\nthe recall of some, but not all, forms of learned behaviour.\nThe deficits in the recall of trace-fear conditioning were\nstill observed when mice were placed on a short T-cycle to\ncontrol for the impact of the shorter period of the mutant\nmice. In previous work, humans placed on a 24.6 T-cycle\nwho were unable to synchronize to this LD cycle exhibited\ndeficits in a variety of learning and vigilance tasks (Wright\net al., 2006). The experimental design of the present study\ndid not directly seek to determine whether poorly\nsynchronized mice also show deficits in performance.\nHowever, it is worth noting that the freezing after training\nfor both WT and Per2-mutants was notably lower when the\nmice were held on the T523 LD cycle. Future studies will\nneed to specifically test the hypothesis that proper\nalignment between the LD cycle and the circadian system\nimpacts learning and memory tasks.\nOur findings complement earlier work reporting that\nmPer1-deficient mice exhibit deficits in place preference\nconditioning (Abarca et al., 2002), whereas Clock-mutant\nLM-C Wang and others\n150 E 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nmice exhibit a stronger preference for cocaine (McClung et\nal., 2005). Also, deficits in cued- and contextual-fear\nconditioning have been described in NPAS2 (neuronal PAS\ndomain protein 2)-deficient mice (Garcia et al., 2000). In\nDrosophila, Per-null mutations disrupted long-term mem-\nory for courtship behaviour (Sakai et al., 2004). These\ndeficits were rescued by the induction of a Per transgene,\nwhereas the overexpression of Per enhanced long-term\nmemory formation. The loss of other circadian genes (Clock,\nTimeless and Cycle) did not influence learned behaviour in\nflies, suggesting a special role for the Per gene. Taken\ntogether, these results establish a link between genes\ninvolved in the generation of circadian oscillations and the\nrecall of learned behaviour. We suggest that the rhythmic\nexpression of clock genes in brain regions outside of the\nSCN may be part of the mechanism by which the circadian\nsystem imposes a temporal order on cognitive functions in\nmammals.\n"
