This study\nevaluated the distribution of dental plaque and gingivitis scores within the dental arches after\nprophylaxis.\nMethods: Adult subjects from the Dharwad, India area representing the general population who\nprovided written informed consent were scheduled for screening. Healthy subjects over the age of\n18 years, not currently requiring any medical or dental care, and presenting with a complement of\nat least 20 natural teeth were recruited for this parallel design study. Enrolled subjects (n \u00bc 41)\nunderwent oral examinations for dental plaque (PI) and gingivitis (GI) using the Turesky\nmodification of the Quigley-Hein and the Lo\n\u00a8e-Silness Index, respectively, at the baseline visit,\nfollowed by a whole mouth dental prophylaxis. Subjects were given fluoride toothpaste for twice\ndaily oral hygiene for the next 30 days. Subjects were recalled on days 15 and 30 for PI and GI\nexaminations identical to baseline.\nResults: Analyses indicated that mean scores for PI and GI on either arch and the whole mouth\nwere higher than 2 and 1, respectively, during all examinations. Anterior surfaces consistently\nexhibited lower PI scores than posterior regions of either arch, or the entire dentition. Regional GI\ndifferences within the dentition were similar to PI scores, with lower scores on anterior than\nposterior teeth. Prophylaxis reduced both the frequency and mean scores of both PI and GI,\nirrespective of arch, with lower scores observed on anterior than posterior regions during all\nrecall visits. Molar and lingual regions consistently exhibited higher PI and GI scores compared with\nanterior surfaces. At all examinations, mean scores for both plaque and gingivitis were higher on\napproximal vestibular than mid-vestibular surfaces.\nConclusions: Differences observed in PI and GI within the dentition have several practical\nimplications: (a) there are advantages of whole mouth assessments for oral health (b) a need for\noral hygiene formulations to reduce the larger deposits of dental plaque in the posterior region and\nresultant gingival inflammation, and (c) a requirement for ongoing oral hygiene education.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/imr\n1Colgate-Palmolive Technology Center, Piscataway, NJ,\nUSA\n2Department of Community Dentistry, SDM College of\nDental Sciences, Dharwad, India\nCorresponding author:\nPrem K.

Prasad2\n Keywords\nArches, dental plaque, dentition, fluoride, gingivitis, prophylaxis, toothbrushing\nBackground\nEndogenous organisms of the human mouth\nreadily colonize exposed surfaces of the den-\ntition to form dental plaque, a natural\nmicrobial biofilm.1\u00ad3 Clinical studies in con-\njunction with microbiological analyses\nhave evaluated the role of dental plaque\nin the initiation and progression of gingival\ninflammation and other oral diseases.2 These\nassessments have been instrumental in iden-\ntifying the organisms associated with caries,\ngingivitis and periodontal disease.3,4 Based\non the available evidence, current practices\ntypically emphasize optimal plaque control\nfor maintaining oral health.1,4 Home-use\nplaque control measures comprise the most\ncommon means for routine plaque control.\nBenefits of plaque control include an oppor-\ntunity to maintain a functional dentition and\nprevent the onset and progression of dental\ndiseases. In addition, plaque control has\nseveral aesthetic benefits, including dental\nappearance and fresh breath.1\nRecognition of the integral role of den-\ntal plaque in the progression of oral\ndiseases has led to evaluations of dental\nplaque accumulations within the dentition.1\u00ad5\nA number of studies have examined\nplaque accumulation within the dentition.\nTaken together, these reports indicate that\nmost individuals have a repeatable pattern\nof plaque accumulation within the denti-\ntion5 with some areas tending to harbor\nlow or high amounts of plaque. Additional\nresearch has elaborated on the influences\nof other factors, including diet,6 local\noxygen tension,7 salivary factors8 and\ntooth position,9 all of which influence\ndental plaque accumulation. Other\nvariables influencing plaque accumulation\ninclude habits and oral hygiene practices.10\nAlthough previous studies have examined\nthe prevalence of plaque on the dentition, to\nour knowledge there have been no investiga-\ntions of the distribution of dental plaque and\ngingivitis within the dental arches. The cur-\nrent study focused on evaluation of individual\nplaque scores and gingivitis frequencies\nwithin each arch, as well as providing discus-\nsion of previously published results.11\nDeterminations of plaque and gingival\nscores in these distinct regions may have\npractical implications for the field, such as\noral health examination practices or in clinical\nevaluations of specific treatments.12\nMaterials and methods\nSubjects\nThis single site clinical study was con-\nducted after the clinical protocol and\ninformed consent forms were reviewed\nand approved by the institutional ethical\nreview board at SDM College of Dental\nSciences and Hospital, Dharwad, India.\nAdult subjects (18\u00ad70 years of age) from\nthe local area who called the dental clinic\nin response to word-of-mouth and adver-\ntisement campaigns were scheduled for a\npre-screening visit. During the pre-screen-\ning visit, study details were explained to\nprospective subjects. Subjects who pro-\nvided voluntary written informed consent,\nindicated availability during the study dur-\nation and were able to comply with study\nprocedures were scheduled for a screening\nvisit that included an oral examination by\na dentist. Enrolment criteria included avail-\nability for the entire duration of the study,\ngood oral and systemic health with no\nsigns of neglect. Exclusion criteria included\ncognitive disorders or chronic medical\nconditions, systemic conditions of the\nheart, kidneys, liver, or infectious diseases,\nincluding AIDS. Other exclusion criteria\nincluded self-reported pregnancy or lacta-\ntion, drug or alcohol addition, and subjects\nwith crowns, veneers, dentures or other\nchronic conditions including caries, peri-\nodontal disease or on prescription\nmedications.\nStudy procedures\nEnrolled subjects were scheduled for a\nbaseline visit that included a whole\nmouth examination for dental plaque and\ngingivitis that excluded the third molars (as\ndescribed in section below). A dentist\nprovided each subject with a whole\nmouth prophylaxis followed by a disclos-\ning episode to ensure removal of all dental\nplaque. Subjects were provided with a\ncommercially available fluoride toothpaste\n(Colgate Dental Cream, Great Regular\nFlavor, New York, NY) and a soft-bristled\ntoothbrush and instructed to brush twice\ndaily. Following enrolment, subjects were\ninstructed not to alter their daily diet or\nother habits, but were instructed to dis-\ncontinue the use of all other dentifrices,\nmouthwashes, chewing gum and other oral\nhygiene formulations for the study dur-\nation. Subjects were recalled after 15 and\n30 days of dentifrice use for clinical assess-\nments that were identical to those during\nthe baseline visit. Study personnel con-\nducted follow-up telephone calls for sub-\njects approximately every 10 days over the\nstudy duration. Follow-up over study dur-\nation was designed to address study-related\nquestions and reinforce the subjects' adher-\nence to study procedures and schedules.\nAll subjects completed the study without\nadverse events.\nClinical scoring procedures\nClinical examinations for dental plaque and\ngingivitis were conducted under constant\nlighting conditions and included assessments\nfor dental plaque and gingivitis using the\nTuresky Modification of the Quigley-Hein\n\u00a8 e-Silness [LS]14 indi-\nces, respectively. Sites examined for dental\nplaque (PI) were also examined for gingivitis\n(GI) with gingivitis assessments preceding the\ndental plaque examination. One clinical\nexaminer conducted all examinations for\nthis study. PI and GI scores from each\ntooth were recorded in appropriate forms\nand subsequently compiled in Microsoft\nExcel for statistical analysis.\nStatistical methods\nSample size determinations were based on an\nstandard deviation (SD) for the response\nmeasure with a significance level of a \u00bc 0.05\nat an 80% level of power. Sample size\ncalculations utilized historical data from\nprevious studies to detect differences in\nclinical scores of 0.5 or less. Clinical scores\nfor dental plaque and gingivitis from the\nentire mouth were compiled and analysed\nseparately. Initial analyses included descrip-\ntive statistics for whole mouth scores from\neach plaque and gingivitis examination\nalong with frequency distributions for each\nscore. Additionally, plaque and gingival\nscores from the facial surfaces of the anterior\n31) at each assessment were compiled for\nfrequency distributions. Clinical scores were\naveraged by subjects in a two-way analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) including subjects and\ntime (baseline, day 15 and day 30) as main\neffects. Statistically significant effects\n(p < 0.05) were further analysed using post-\nhoc Tukey's multiple comparison tests for\npairwise differences among time points.\nPaired t-tests compared results between dif-\nferent regions of the dentition at each assess-\nment. Analyses were conducted using Minitab\n(Minitab Inc., State College PA), and statis-\ntical significance was determined with a 95%\nconfidence interval and p-value less than 0.05.\nResults\nFrequency distribution of PI scores\non the upper and lower arches\nfemales; age range 19\u00ad44 years) representing\n6,756 surfaces examined at each clinical\nexamination and their corresponding\narches subsequently during the day 15 and\n30 assessments are shown in Graph 1. On a\npercentage basis, surfaces with plaque scores\nof 2 and 3 were the most frequent, while\nthose with scores of 0 and 5 were the least\nfrequent. At each evaluation, less than 13%\nof the sites reported a plaque score of 4. A\nscore of 5 was observed in approximately\n4% of the surfaces at baseline, while less\nthan 2% of the surfaces exhibited a score of\n5 in evaluations following prophylaxis.\nComparison of mean PI scores on\nanterior and posterior surfaces\nfrom either arch\nTable 1 shows the least squares mean scores\nfor plaque on the anterior and posterior\nsurfaces from each arch. Plaque scores\nwere 2 or more at each evaluation, irrespect-\nive of arch. ANOVA revealed significant\nreductions from baseline to day 15 eva-\nluations for the lower anterior and upper\nposterior surfaces of both arches (p < 0.05),\nreflecting the effects of prophylaxis.\nIrrespective of location, day 30 plaque\nscores corresponded with baseline scores.\nStatistical comparisons of mean differ-\nences in plaque between the anterior and\nposterior regions of each arch over the study\nperiod are shown in Table 2. Regardless of\narch, significantly higher mean PI scores\nwere observed among posterior surfaces\ncompared with anterior regions (p < 0.003).\nProphylaxis reduced plaque scores from\nbaseline to the first recall visit but demon-\nstrated consistent increases from the first to\nthe second recall visit. Mean scores from the\nsecond recall visit were similar to those\nobserved at baseline.\nPlaque scores within each region\nof the dentition\nMean plaque scores within each region of\nthe dentition are shown in Table 3.

Gingival scores of 1 and 2\nwere most common at the baseline evalu-\nation. On a percentage basis, a gingival score\nof 2 was more frequent on the posterior\nsurfaces of the lower arch than on the upper\narch at baseline. A gingival score of 3 was\nfewer than 1.5% of the surfaces were devoid\nof gingivitis. Prophylaxis reduced the number\nof surfaces reporting gingival scores of 2 and 3\nwith a concomitant increase in the number of\nsites reporting scores of 0 and 1. We observed\nreductions in gingival scores of surfaces in the\ntwo recall visits, with a score of 1 found at\nmore than 69% of the sites, constituting the\nmost frequent observation.

Whereas\nnatural methods of oral hygiene continue to\nbe utilized in different regions of the world,\nthe use of a toothbrush and toothpaste\nrepresents a common approach.12 While all\nAmericans claim to own a toothbrush, and\nbrush their teeth routinely, it is clear that\nmost individuals fail to perform adequate\noral hygiene on a routine basis. Studies\nafter a brushing episode, and the effects of\nplaque are represented in the widespread\nprevalence of common oral diseases, includ-\ning caries, gingivitis and periodontal\nThe current study focused on a compari-\nson of dental plaque and gingivitis within\nthe dental arches. We evaluated subjects\nusing two widely utilized clinical indices for\ndental plaque and gingivitis. These indices\nrepresent the ``gold-standard'' evaluation\nmethods, and are commonly utilized to\nassess oral health and the effects of oral\nhygiene formulations.13\u00ad20 Several advan-\ntages of these methods include their relative\nease, history of use, and the large number of\nclinical investigators possessing practical\nexperience with these methods.\nSeveral steps were included in the study\ndesign to maintain generalizability of the\ncurrent results. Clinical procedures and\nassessments were standardized for this\ninvestigation, and a calibrated clinical exam-\niner with greater than 90% reliability for\neach clinical index conducted all examin-\nations under constant lighting conditions.\nThe clinical indices were used to examine six\nsurfaces of all teeth, providing a compre-\nhensive assessment of dental plaque and\ngingivitis in all examinations. Prospective\nsubjects were screened for general health\nparameters and oral health. Adults from the\ngeneral population in good health, with at\nleast 20 natural teeth and no crowns or\ndentures, and currently not undergoing\nmedical or dental treatments were enrolled.\nThese design features were included to\nreduce physiological factors that influence\nthe oral parameters, including dental plaque\nand gingivitis, that were the primary focus\nof this investigation. Several additional fea-\ntures were included in the study design to\nmaintain the overall generalizability of the\nstudy. Subjects were not instructed to alter\ntheir diet or habits, to reduce the influence of\nthese variables on the parameters we eval-\nuated.21 A new toothbrush and a commer-\ncially available fluoride toothpaste were\nissued to all subjects for standardized oral\nhygiene during the study. Subjects were\nFigure 1. Frequency distribution for plaque scores on each arch and all surfaces over the study duration.\ninstructed to brush their teeth as per their\nusual techniques. Evaluation of 41 subjects\nresulted in the evaluation of 6,756 sites for\ndental plaque and gingivitis at each exam-\nfor each clinical index were compiled, com-\nprising a substantial data set for statistical\nanalysis.\nThe most frequent plaque and gingival\nscores on either arch were 2, 3 and 1, 2\nrespectively. All remaining scores were\nobserved on a smaller number of surfaces.\nIrrespective of arch, anterior surfaces\ndemonstrated lower frequencies than pos-\nterior regions in all evaluations. Analyses of\nmean scores for both plaque and gingivitis\non the anterior and posterior surfaces of\neither arch correspond to their respective\nfrequency distributions, with significantly\nlower scores on anterior surfaces than pos-\nterior regions. For both clinical parameters,\nlower scores were consistently observed on\nanterior regions compared with the corres-\nponding posterior sites. These results are\nin accord with previous studies examining\nthe efficacy of oral hygiene, demonstrating\nthat many more anterior surfaces were\nfree of plaque than posterior regions.10,22\nCorrespondingly, results from epidemio-\nlogical studies indicate that posterior sites\nare prone to gingival inflammation and\nperiodontal disease.10 While the current\nresults are in congruence with previous\nreports in the literature, they are in contrast\nwith assessments of oral health provided by\nanalyses of selected regions, such as the\nanterior teeth.23 Thus, analyses of anterior\nsurfaces appear to provide partial assess-\nments of oral hygiene based on the consist-\nently higher accumulations of dental plaque\nand resultant gingival inflammation in the\nposterior regions, irrespective of arch.\nAnatomical and physiological features\nare likely contribute to the consistent abun-\ndance of dental plaque and corresponding\ngingival scores in molar and lingual regions.\nThese surfaces are reported to consistently\nexhibit the largest amounts of plaque, and\ncorrespond to lower plaque removal from\nthese regions10,22 and higher susceptibility to\ngingivitis10 in adults. Similar observations\nhave been reported among teenagers24 and\nafter professional tooth cleaning.19 These\nclinical observations have been substantiated\nby recent microbiological investigations\nreporting greater amounts of microbial\nDNA on posterior teeth.9\nMid-vestibular regions consistently\nexhibited significantly lower scores than\napproximal vestibular surfaces. These obser-\nvations are relevant for oral health examin-\nations in several ways. For example, while\nFigure 2. Frequency distribution for gingival scores on each arch and all surfaces over the study duration.\ncommon indices remain the most wide-\nspread means of assessing oral health,\nsome reports have highlighted specific defi-\nciencies in these methods.25 Approaches that\nattempt to improve on these methods\ninclude planimetric methods26 and other\ntechniques for examining dental plaque\non anterior teeth using digital plaque ima-\nging.23 The current results demonstrate\nspecific differences between and within\nthe dentition for dental plaque and gin-\ngivitis. Additionally, the current results\nrevealed that plaque levels on the facial\nsurfaces of anterior teeth did not match the\nlevels in approximal vestibular regions.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that\nanterior teeth are an insufficient substitute\nfor accurately evaluating whole mouth\nplaque and gingivitis status.\nThe effect of prophylaxis was evident on\nall surfaces showing reductions in plaque\nand gingival scores from the baseline to the\nfirst recall visit. All surfaces exhibited\nincreases in plaque scores from the first\nto the second recall visit, with no signifi-\ncant differences observed between the base-\nline and the second recall visit. In contrast,\ngingival scores maintained their broad\nreductions from the first to the second\nrecall visit at the conclusion of the study.\nThese results are in accord with those of a\nprevious investigation examining the effects\nof prophylaxis on dental plaque and bleed-\ning on probing (BOP) amongst a sample of\nstudy, significantly lower plaque levels were\nobserved 15 days after prophylaxis along\nwith reductions in BOP, however, both\nplaque and BOP levels demonstrated\nincreases from day 15 to day 30. Subjects\nenrolled in this investigation were older than\n18 years, and of mixed gender. Plaque scores\non day 30 returned to baseline levels.\nHowever, gingival scores maintained broad\nreductions, revealing a divergence between\nthese parameters. Taken together, these\nobservations corroborate previous studies\nand expand on the available literature,\ndemonstrating consistently lower PI and\nGI scores on anterior surfaces compared\nwith posterior regions.\nConclusions\nWe found that PI and GI scores were lower\non anterior teeth compared with posterior\nregions, irrespective of arch, in all evalu-\nations over the study period. While dental\nprophylaxis reduced dental plaque and gin-\nevaluations, posterior surfaces consistently\nregistered higher scores than anterior\nregions. In addition to providing a reference\npoint for the distribution of plaque and\ngingival inflammation on the dental arches,\nthe current findings have practical relevance\nfor oral hygiene, including the development\nof preventative programs that seek to reduce\nthe incidence of common oral diseases.\nCorrespondingly, an accurate assessment\nof oral health requires the incorporation of\nthese regional differences in whole mouth\nexaminations.\nAuthors' contributions\nAll authors contributed extensively to the work\npresented in this paper.
