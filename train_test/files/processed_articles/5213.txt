    "abstract": "Abstract\nPeople differ in the belief that their intuitions produce good decision outcomes. In the present research, we sought to test the\nvalidity of these beliefs by comparing individuals' self-reports with measures of actual intuition performance in a standard implicit\nlearning task, exposing participants to seemingly random letter strings (Studies 1a\u00adb) and social media profile pictures (Study 2)\nthat conformed to an underlying rule or grammar. A meta-analysis synthesizing the present data (N \u00bc 400) and secondary data by\nPretz, Totz, and Kaufman found that people's enduring beliefs in their intuitions were not reflective of actual performance in the\nimplicit learning task. Meanwhile, task-specific confidence in intuition bore no sizable relation with implicit learning performance,\nbut the observed data favoured neither the null hypothesis nor the alternative hypothesis. Together, the present findings suggest\nthat people's ability to judge the veracity of their intuitions may be limited.\n",
    "reduced_content": "Article\nCan People Judge the Veracity\nof Their Intuitions?\nStefan Leach1 and Mario Weick1\n Keywords\nintuition, implicit learning, metacognition, meta-analysis\nThe British TV series Luther centers on DCI John Luther, a\ntroubled detective working in a serious crime unit, who thanks\nto his superior intuition prowess, solves difficult cases, often\nfinding himself operating at the fringes of the law (or beyond).\nLuther's defiance and brute confidence is a defining feature of\nthe character, but his religious reliance on instincts is reminis-\ncent of many detective stories. For viewers or readers of such\nstories, it seems plausible enough that some individuals\nendowed with superior instincts know to trust their intuitions,\nperhaps encouraged by the steady recurrence of confirmatory\noutcomes--murderers getting caught and cases getting solved.\nHowever, moving beyond the realm of fiction and super\ninstincts, the question arises whether in the absence of perfor-\nmance feedback individuals have the introspective insight to\njudge how good their intuitions are. In other words, do individ-\nuals' metacognitive representations of intuition performance--\nhow much certainty and confidence individuals express in their\nintuitions--predict actual performance outcomes? The present\nresearch addresses this question focusing on implicit learning\nperformance.\nDual process models presume that automatic processes give\nrise to intuitive hunches or gut feelings (Chaiken & Trope,\nFrankish, 2009). Quick, intuitive judgments are often con-\ntrasted with slow, elaborate processes, with the latter producing\nsuperior performance outcomes (e.g., Brewer, 1988; Devine,\nunder imperfect conditions that favor intuitive processes (see\nGigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996), people can lack the ability to\nadequately scrutinize their judgments (Fiedler, 2000; see also\nNisbett & Wilson, 1977). Thus, individuals may lack an under-\nstanding of the, perhaps limited, veracity of intuitions (see\nHowever, some researchers have argued that people's intui-\ntive capabilities are often misrepresented in the literature and\nless erroneous than one might assume (Bowers, Regehr,\nBalthazard, & Parker, 1990). For example, studies on impres-\nsion formation show that people's impressions of others are\noften surprisingly accurate when formed on the basis of rela-\ntively sparse information (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1992). There\nis also evidence that individuals can monitor their performance\nand correct for biases. For example, when asked to judge\nwhether a coin is biased in favor of heads or tails, people focus\non the proportion of heads in the sample and then correct for the\noverall sample size (Slovic & Lichtenstein, 1971; Tversky &\nKahneman, 1974). Other work demonstrates that people can\nreadily adjust inferences drawn from intuitive feelings through\nassociative learning (Unkelbach, 2007) or logic (Winkielman,\nPeople are relatively apt at extracting information from their\ngut feelings (e.g., Kelley & Jacoby, 1990), including\n1 School of Psychology, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nMario Weick, School of Psychology, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent CT2\nEmail: m.weick@kent.ac.uk\nSocial Psychological and\nPersonality Science\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/spp\ninformation on the goodness or fit of mental processes (Whit-\ntlesea & Dorken, 1997). People can also readily express their\npreference for, and endorsement of, intuitions in self-report\n1999). One finding that emerges from studies using these mea-\nsures is that people who consider themselves to be more intui-\ntive (as opposed to rational) also tend to believe that their\nintuitions lead to good decision outcomes and have predictive\nvalidity (Pacini & Epstein, 1999). However, thus far the valid-\nity of these claims has mainly been examined in tasks geared\ntoward producing biases or erroneous decisions (Epstein\n2002). Arguably, such tasks are ill-suited to validate individu-\nals' explicit beliefs of intuition performance.\nSome clues as to the link between individuals' explicit\nbeliefs and actual intuition performance may derive from work\non the feeling of knowing, first studied in the context of\nMetcalfe (1986) found that individuals were unable to judge\ntheir ability to solve \"insight\" problems in the future. Metcalfe\nreasoned these results could be due to the fact that the tasks at\nhand required sudden illumination, and it may be particularly\ndifficult for individuals to predict Eureka-type phenomena.\nImplicit learning tasks may provide a better outlet to probe\nindividuals' intuition performance and associated beliefs. In an\nimplicit learning task, participants witness systematic associa-\ntions between stimuli, often under disguise, and participants'\nknowledge of the associative pattern is tested at a later stage.\nThe tasks are designed so as to render the extraction of patterns\nor rules very difficult and too burdensome for slow, conscious\nprocesses. Knowledge of the rules is therefore assumed to be\nacquired implicitly (via System 1, see Kahneman, 2003), and\nintuitions are thought to give individuals \"vague feelings\" of\nficial grammar (AG) task (Reber, 1967), a standard implicit\nlearning task that involves learning rules related to nonsensical\nletter strings, Dienes and colleagues demonstrated that individ-\nuals can judge their own test performance ex post facto\n(Dienes, Altmann, Kwan, & Goode, 1995; Dienes & Seth,\n2010). This suggests that individuals may be able to judge the\nveracity of their intuitions (i.e., whether their feelings translate\ninto correct answers). For example, stronger or more concrete\nfeelings may give individuals greater confidence that their\nintuitions are correct.\nHowever, responses in the AG task are not solely based on\nintuitions and instead derive from a mix of implicit and explicit\nknowledge (see Dienes, Broadbent, & Berry, 1991). Thus,\nexplicit knowledge of some of the letter strings, but not feelings\nassociated with implicit processes, may have underpinned indi-\nviduals' performance judgments. Furthermore, evidence for\nsuccessful implicit learning can also be found even when indi-\nviduals are tossing a mental coin (Dienes & Seth, 2010), pre-\nsumably oblivious to the veracity of their intuitions. This\nsuggests some dissociation between individuals' metacognitive\nrepresentations and intuition performance. In addition, asking\nparticipants to judge the correctness of their answers in an\nimplicit learning task only provides an indirect measure of indi-\nviduals' explicit beliefs about their intuition performance. In\nparticular, people's mental representations of task performance\nmay not encompass any \"intuition\" concepts.\nPretz, Totz, and Kaufman (2010) administered the AG task\nand a probabilistic serial reaction time task (Schvaneveldt &\nGomez, 1998)--the two paradigms of choice to study implicit\nlearning (Shanks, 2005)--to a sample of participants who also\ncompleted the rational\u00adexperiential inventory measuring indi-\nvidual differences in the (self-proclaimed) propensity to trust\none's intuition (see Pacini & Epstein, 1999). The authors found\nthat individuals who expressed greater trust in their\nintuitions did not perform any better in the implicit learning\ntasks, rCombined\n.31].1 This casts some doubt on people's ability to judge how\ngood their intuitions are. However, the absence of an associa-\ntion in a single sample (Nadj\n\u00bc 100) is not sufficient to establish\na null effect. Relatedly, the CI for the population parameter\nencompasses a wide range of values, calling for further studies.\nThe Present Research\nIn the current research, we sought to shed light on the question\nwhether metacognitive representations of intuition perfor-\nmance--how much certainty and confidence individuals express\nin their intuitions--predict actual performance outcomes in an\nimplicit learning task. We extend previous work in at least three\nways. First, previous studies focused on implicit learning of non-\nsensical stimuli (e.g., letter strings). People seem to be more\ninsightful, however, when relying on intuitions in social domains\n(e.g., Ambady & Rosenthal, 1992). Consequently, in the present\nresearch, we probed the validity of individuals' beliefs regarding\ntheir intuition performance in tasks involving nonsocial (Studies\n1a\u00adb) and social stimuli (Study 2), thus providing a stronger test\nof the validity of individuals' beliefs.\nSecond, we employed both generalized trait measures and\ntask-specific state measures of how much faith individuals\nplaced in their intuitions. This is a critical addition because\nthe absence of an association between individuals' beliefs and\nactual performance can be readily attributed to a lack of spe-\ncificity in the trait measures employed to predict performance\nsought to overcome this limitation by probing individuals'\nconfidence in their intuitions vis-a\n`-vis the specific task at\nhand. In addition, in order to obtain a more complete picture\nof participants' performance and corresponding mental repre-\nsentations, we included auxiliary self-report measures\n(detailed below) to help elucidate participants' involvement\nwith, and approach to, the task.\nFinally, we extend the body of evidence currently available\nby carrying out a meta-analytic synthesis of all primary and\nsecondary data to provide more precise estimates of the popu-\nlation parameters. Where applicable, we supplement our anal-\nysis with Bayes factor (BF01\nFollowing Rouder and Morey (2012), our null hypothesis cor-\nresponds to a nil point (r \u00bc 0) and the alternative hypothesis to\na full range of positive and negative effects that follow a Cau-\nchy distribution (see also Rouder, Speckman, Sun, Morey, &\nfor all nonsignificant effects\n(yielded using a frequentist approach) to specify the chances that\nthe observed data occurred under the null hypothesis rather than\nthe alternative hypothesis; values larger than 3 provide evidence\nin favor of the null hypothesis (e.g., Dienes, 2014). Note that a\ndecision to favor the null hypothesis implies that a nil effect pro-\nvidesa better approximationthanthealternative hypothesis,but it\nshould not be taken as evidence that an effect is strictly zero in the\npopulation, which is implausible (Cohen, 1994). Also note that\nrelative to a null hypothesis with an interval around zero, a null\nhypothesis with a nil point favors the alternative hypothesis and\nis therefore a more conservative approach to provide evidence for\ninvariance (see Morey & Rouder, 2011; see also Lakens, in press,\nfor a frequentist approach).\nMethod\nParticipants\nOne hundred and one students participated in Study 1a (87\nfemale; MAge\nmembers of the public in Study 2 (170 female; MAge\n\u00bc 9.36). We only considered responses from participants\nwho completed all sessions and all parts of the study (see Proce-\ndure). Students (nTotal\n\u00bc 325) were recruited from a British Uni-\nversity and took part in exchange for course credits. Members of\nthe public (nTotal\n\u00bc 75) were recruited from the United States\nand the United kingdom via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)\nand took part for a monetary incentive. The sample sizes of the\nindividual studies provided 80% power at a \u00bc .05 to detect\neffects ranging from |r| \u00bc .19 (Study 2) to |r| \u00bc .31 (Study 1b).\nProcedure and Materials\nStudies 1a and 1b were conducted longitudinally in two consec-\nutive sessions. At Time 1, participants completed the individual\ndifference measures online. The implicit learning task was\nadministered at Time 2 and carried out online (Study 1a) or\nin the laboratory under the supervision of an experimenter\n(Study 1b). Time 1 and Time 2 took place at least 1 day apart.\nStudy 2 was conducted online within the same session, and the\nindividual difference measures preceded the implicit learning\ntask. Table S1 in the Supplementary Material provides an over-\nview of all key variations between Studies 1a\u00adb and 2.\nSelf-reported intuition. All three studies contained the English\nversion of the Preference for Intuition Scale (Betsch, 2008), a\n9-item questionnaire that measures endorsement of intuitive\nreasoning (e.g., \"With most decisions, it makes sense to com-\npletely rely on your feelings\"). Participants indicated their\nanswers on a 7-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to\n7 (strongly agree). In addition, participants in Study 1b com-\npleted the Faith in Intuition Scale (Epstein et al., 1996), a\n12-item measure of preference for intuitive thought and\nbehavior (e.g., \"I believe in trusting my hunches\"). Participants\nresponded on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (completely false)\nto 5 (completely true). Finally, participants in Study 2 com-\npleted the experiential inventory (Pacini & Epstein, 1999), a\n20-item measure of the extent to which individuals engage\nin, and excel at, experiential thinking (e.g., \"I like to rely on\nmy intuitive impressions\"; \"I hardly ever go wrong when I lis-\nten to my deepest gut feelings to find an answer\"). Participants\nresponded to all items on a 5-point scale from 1 (definitely not\ntrue of myself) to 5 (definitely true of myself).\nImplicit AG learning task. Participants in Studies 1a and 1b com-\npleted a standard version of the AG learning task described in\nAbrams and Reber (1988) as a measure of implicit learning per-\nformance. The task involved learning associations between\n(nonsensical) letter strings that followed a rule or \"grammar.\"\nParticipants in Study 2 completed a new, adapted version of the\ntask that required participants to learn associations between\nprofile pictures that are commonly used in online social media.\nThe same finite-state grammar was used to dictate the order of\nthe letter strings and the profile pictures (see Figure 1). In other\nwords, the two versions of the AG learning task were almost\nidentical, except that one version employed nonsocial stimuli\n(letter strings) and another version employed social stimuli\n(profile pictures). Performance was measured by the total num-\nber of correct responses, bound at 0 (minimum) and 46 (max-\nimum), with scores above 23 indicating above-chance\nperformance. A more detailed description of the task can be\nfound in the Supplementary Material.\nTask-related self-report measures. After the implicit learning\ntask, participants' beliefs were probed with regard to (a) their\nconfidence in their intuitions (e.g., \"To what extent did your\ngut feeling give you certainty in your answers?\"), (b) their\nself-assessed performance (e.g., \"How correct do you think are\nyour answers?\"), (c) their use of intuition as a basis for their\ndecisions (e.g., \"To what extent did you rely on your gut feel-\nings to decide whether a string [Online Chat post] was gramma-\ntically correct or incorrect?\"), and (d) the perceived benefits of\nfurther information about the underlying grammatical rule\n(e.g., \"To what extent would reading further information on the\nrules that governed the order of posts been beneficial to per-\nform well on the task?\"). All constructs were measured with\n2 items, except for the confidence in intuition measure in Study\n2, where a third item was added as a safeguard to avoid a\n(hypothetical) situation where this key measure had low relia-\nbility. In addition, some minor changes were made to the word-\ning of other auxiliary measures that yielded low reliability in\nStudy 1b (see Supplementary Material--Data Preparation). In\nStudy 1a, participants also indicated how much effort they\ninvested in the learning task (\"How much effort did you invest\nthroughout the questionnaire to provide correct answers?\"; sin-\ngle item measure). A similar, 2-item measure was used in Study\n2 (\"How much effort did you invest in the Online Chat task?\";\n\"How much did you try to perform well in the Online Chat\ntask?\"). Study 1b was conducted in a controlled laboratory\n42 Social Psychological and Personality Science 9(1)\nenvironment, which enabled us to use the amount of time par-\nticipants spent on the practice and test phase of the AG task as\nan objective indicator of effort. All self-report responses were\nmade on 9-point scales (see Supplementary Material).\nResults\nIn our presentation of the results below, we take a cumulative\napproach (see Cumming, 2014) and use meta-analytic proce-\ndures to identify trends that generalize across studies, drawing\non both primary (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2) and secondary (Pretz,\nTotz, & Kaufman, 2010) data wherever applicable. Since some\nvariations in population parameters are to be expected between\nthe different versions of the AG learning task (nonsocial vs.\nsocial) and the different modes of assessment (laboratory vs.\nonline; longitudinal vs. single session), we employ random-\neffects meta-analysis models to derive the estimates of central\ntendencies (see Higgins & Green, 2011, Chapter 9).\nData Preparation\nA description of the data preparation is provided in the Supple-\nmentary Material. Tables 1\u00ad3 display the reliabilities, descrip-\ntive statistics, and single-order correlations for all measures.\nCIs are provided in Tables S1\u00adS3.\nImplicit Learning Performance\nOverall performance in the AG learning task was above chance\nlevel in all studies, suggesting that participants learned the\nFigure 1.

This also held when restricting the samples\nto participants drawn from the same population, Zs ! 3.96,\nps < .001. As can be seen in Tables 1\u00ad3, implicit learning per-\nformance shared no sizable relationship with subjective (Stud-\nies 1a and 2) and objective (Study 1b) effort, suggesting that\nmore deliberative approaches to the task were not beneficial,\nTable 1.

As shown in Figure 2, across studies we found\nlittle evidence that dispositional trust in intuition translated into\nsuperior learning performance. A meta-analysis of all primary\n(Studies 1a\u00adb and 2) and secondary (Pretz et al., 2010) data indi-\ncates that there was no sizable association between dispositional\nintuition endorsement (i.e., Preference for Intuition, Faith in\nIntuition, Experiential Inventory) and implicit learning perfor-\nmance, rCombined\n\u00bc 6.02. Interestingly, the more participants\nplaced trust in their intuitions, the worse they performed in the\nnonsocial version of the AG learning task (Studies 1a\u00adb),\nrCombined\n\u00bc 2. Meanwhile, performance in the social version of the AG\nlearning task (Study 2) bore no sizable relation with intuition\nendorsement, rCombined\n\u00bc 6.55. These variations between studies (i.e., Studies\n1a\u00adb vs. Study 2) employing different versions of the same\nAG learning task (i.e., social vs. nonsocial) were significant, Z\nSelf-assessed performance correlated with actual performance\non the AG learning task, rCombined\n.33], Q \u00bc 2.17, df \u00bc 2, replicating Dienes and colleagues' find-\nHowever, as shown in Figure 3, there was no evidence that task-\nspecific confidence in intuition was related to actual performance\nacross studies, rCombined\nis below 3, suggesting that\nthere is insufficient evidence to favor the null hypothesis over the\nalternative hypothesis. Consequently, we must entertain the pos-\nsibility that confidence in one's intuitions vis-a\n`-vis the specific\ntask provides an indication of actual intuition performance. How-\never, as shown by the CI (r \u00bc .09 [\u00c0.07, .24]), in a given sample,\nthe predictive validity can be expected to be low (r % .10) and is\nunlikely to exceed r % .25. We will return to the implications of\nthis finding in the Discussion.\nExploratory analyses. We conducted a series of exploratory anal-\nyses in the hope to shed some further light onto the lack of an\nassociation between people's beliefs about their intuitions and\nactual intuition performance. First, as indicated earlier, partici-\npants' judgments of how well they did on the task may reflect,\nat least in part, participants' explicit knowledge related to the\nconscious acquisition of some underlying rules, which\naccounts for some (but not all) of the variation in performance\nin the AG task. Consequently, controlling for participants' self-\nassessed performance statistically could be a way to discern\nvariations in task performance that can be attributed to implicit\nprocesses. With this in mind, we regressed the AG learning task\nscores on the measures of dispositional intuition endorsement\nas well as participants' self-assessed performance ratings. We\nconducted three separate ordinary least squares (OLS) regres-\nsions, one for each study (Study 1a, Study 1b, and Study 2), and\nthen meta-analyzed the resulting semipartial correlation coeffi-\ncients. In addition, we repeated the same procedure,\nFigure 2. Forest plot and random effects meta-analysis of the correlations between dispositional intuition endorsement and implicit learning\nperformance. Observations denote pairwise comparisons. N is adjusted by dividing the number of participants in a given study by the number of\nmeasures included in the meta-analysis that were administered to the same group of participants (see Higgins & Green, 2011, Chapter 16).\nFigure 3.

We conducted three OLS regressions, one\nfor each study, and then meta-analyzed the resulting partial\ncorrelation coefficients.3 Neither dispositional nor task-\nspecific manifestations of intuition confidence bore a\nsignificant relation with performance on the AG learning task;\ndispositional: prCombined\n\u00bc 1.89; task-specific: prCombined\nHowever, once again, the existence of a small positive\nassociation between task-specific confidence in intuition and\nintuition performance could not be ruled out.\nWe also sought to rule out that nongrammatical stimuli misled\nparticipants' intuitive judgments by examining participants' per-\nformance on trials involving grammatical stimuli only. Zero-\norder correlations revealed that correct responses on grammatical\ntrials were neither related to dispositional intuition endorsement\n(i.e., Preference for Intuition, Faith in Intuition, Experiential\nInventory), rCombined\n\u00bc 3.51, nor to task-specific confidence in\nintuition, rCombined\n\u00bc 1.89, although the latter measure provided\ninsufficient evidence to favor the null hypothesis.\nDiscussion\nThe current research examined how people's beliefs about their\nintuitions--how certain and confident people are in their intui-\ntions--relate to actual intuition performance in a standard\nimplicit learning task. To this end, we exposed participants to\nseemingly random letter strings (Studies 1a\u00adb) or social media\nprofile pictures (Study 2) that conformed to an underlying rule\nor grammar. Participants' incidental learning of the rule was\nthen probed in a subsequent test phase. Pooling data from three\nnew studies (N \u00bc 400) and, where applicable, previously\npublished work (Pretz et al., 2010), we found that people's\nenduring beliefs in their intuitions were a poor guide to actual\nperformance. In particular, people who were dispositionally\ninclined to place greater trust in their intuitions did not perform\nany better in the test phase of the implicit learning task than\npeople who did not place such great trust in their intuitions.\nFurther analyses suggested that this result cannot be attributed\nto variations in explicit knowledge nor to the fact that partici-\npants were misled by nongrammatical/rule-nonconforming sti-\nmuli, nor to differences in (subjective and objective) effort.\nIt may not come as a complete surprise that measures that\ntap into general dispositions fail to predict performance on a\nspecific task (cf. Ajzen & Fishbein, 1973; Pachur & Spaar,\n2015). To address the issue of domain-specificity, we also\nassessed task-specific confidence in intuition--a state mea-\nsure of how confident and certain participants were in their\nintuitions during the test phase of the implicit learning tasks.\nThe measure was administered after the implicit learning\ntasks, thus ensuring a high degree of familiarity with the task.\nIn spite of these \"favorable\" conditions, pooled across studies\ntask-specific confidence in intuition did not predict actual\nintuition performance. We also used statistical techniques to\nseparate the unique contributions of general and task-\nspecific beliefs in intuition to task performance. Once again,\nno reliable associations were found. However, using a Baye-\nsian approach to test for invariance (Rouder & Morey, 2012),\nwe could not affirm the null hypothesis.\nIt remains possible, and perhaps the most likely scenario, that\nindividuals' confidence in their intuitions vis-a\n`-vis a task at hand\nprovides some indication of actual learning performance. How-\never, as outlined above in a given sample, the predictive validity\ncan be expected to be low (r % .10) and is unlikely to exceed r %\n.25. A relatively weak relationship with actual performance\nimplies that individuals' task-specific beliefs in their intuitions\ncan be frequently misleading. This can be illustrated with\nRosenthal and Rubin's (1982) binomial effect size display:\nAssuming, for the sake of illustration, a dichotomous outcome\nin the implicit learning task (correct judgments vs. incorrect\njudgments) and a clear separation of participants into those with\nhigh and low confidence, the difference in success between peo-\nple with high and low confidence in a given sample is unlikely to\nexceed 25% (and equally likely to be zero). Put differently, 1 of\nthe 4 times individuals with high confidence in their intuitions\nmay perform better than individuals with low confidence in their\nintuitions. Conversely, 3 of the 4 times high (vs. low) confidence\nmay not provide an indication of better performance (correct vs.\nincorrect). Note that these figures illustrate a \"best-case\" sce-\nnario; in a given sample, we would expect the difference\nbetween people with high and low confidence to be *10%,\nwhich would imply that 9 of the 10 times high (vs. low) confi-\ndence does not translate into superior performance.\nLimitations\nThe present findings are limited to implicit learning of novel\nstimuli and should not be generalized to other facets of\n46 Social Psychological and Personality Science 9(1)\nintuition, such as the intuitive decision-making of experts (e.g.,\ntions to recognition, invoking memory-based processes of\nmatching and information retrieval. In contrast, the present\nwork placed an emphasis on information acquisition. It is inter-\nesting to note, however, that studies on expert intuitions often\narrive at similar conclusions as the present research (cf.\nEinhorn & Hogarth, 1978). Reviewing research on expert\nintuitions, Kahneman and Klein (2009) concluded that\nsubjective confidence provides an \"unreliable indication of the\nvalidity of intuitive judgments and decisions\" (p. 524).\nOn a related note, it is possible that individuals can calibrate\ntheir mental representations of intuition performance through\nfeedback, and this may contribute to align individuals' beliefs\nwith actual performance. However, external feedback can also\nexacerbate biases and foster overconfidence and false beliefs\nare needed to gain a fuller and more complete understanding\nif and under what conditions individuals are able to judge the\nveracity of their intuitions.\nConclusions\nPeople readily express their preference for, and endorsement\nof, intuitions in self-report measures (Betsch, 2008; Epstein\nperceive themselves to be intuitive (as opposed to rational), the\nmore they tend to believe that their intuitions have predictive\nvalidity and lead to good decision outcomes (Pacini & Epstein,\n1999).

Furthermore,\nwhile confidence in one's intuitions vis-a\n`-vis a particular task\nat hand may bear some relation to actual intuition performance,\nthe predictive validity is likely low and may lead to frequent\nmisjudgments.\nAuthors' Note\nBoth authors contributed equally to the article.\n"
