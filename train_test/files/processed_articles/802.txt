    "reduced_content": "More than half of employers use outside consultants when designing health\nbenefits, but this practice does not result in a different type of benefit\npackage.\nby M. Susan Marquis and Stephen H. Long\nMany specialists help employers\nto design health insurance plans,\nbut little is known about the\nnumber and characteristics of employers na-\ntionwide that depend on these specialists to\nhelp them make decisions. Moreover, we\nknow little about the relationship between\nuse of these specialists and the resulting char-\nacteristics of health benefits plans.\nJon Christianson, in his case studies of em-\nployers' role in twelve community health sys-\ntems, offers some hypotheses about the use of\noutside advisers.1 He found that it was com-\nmon for small employers to use \"intermediar-\nies\" in dealings with health plans, whereas\nmost large employers did not appear to use\nthem. In some communities purchasing coali-\ntions, often sponsored by chambers of com-\nmerce, served small businesses, while in other\ncommunities insurance brokers served the\nsmall-employer market. This suggests that\npurchasing coalitions and brokers may serve\nas substitutes in helping small employers to\nmake decisions about health benefits. Regard-\nless of the type of intermediary they used, em-\nployers saw the intermediary's role as helping\nto locate low-cost insurance. Extrapolating\nfrom this observation, we might expect that\nother factors that lower the price or reduce\nprice variation in insurance--such as states'\nsmall-group rating reforms--would reduce\nemployers' need for outside advisers.\nThe work of Deborah Garnick and col-\nleagues on insurance agents in New Jersey,\nwhile primarily focused on the individual\nmarket, also offers some hypotheses about\noutside advisers.2 They cite a national trend of\ndecline in the use of agents, resulting from the\ngrowth in availability of managed care to\nsmall employers and the fact that health\nmaintenance organizations (HMOs) do not\nuse agents as frequently as indemnity insurers\ndo. They also discuss the potential interaction\nof insurance market reform and the use of\nagents in the individual market. The stan-\ndardized benefit packages, rating reforms,\nand improved consumer information that are\noften a part of insurance market reform\nshould mean that consumers (and, analo-\ngously, employers in the small-group market)\nwill have less need for agents and brokers to\nprovide information and advice. Yet despite\nthe strict reforms in New Jersey's individual\nmarket, 71 percent of new policyholders in the\nindividual market used an insurance agent.\nMight we expect a similar result in the small-\ngroup market?\nThis paper takes advantage of a new na-\ntional survey of employers to address these\nissues.\n\u00a92000Project HOPE\u00adThe People-to-PeopleHealth Foundation,\nThe authors are senior economists at RAND, in Washington, D.C.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 0\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The sample\nwas concentrated in the sixty\ncommunities followed by the\nRWJF Community Tracking\nStudy and in twelve states\nhaving significant small-group\ninsurance reforms.3 Within\ngeographic units the samples\nwere further allocated to strata\ndefined by the number of\nworkers at the establishment.\nThe sample establishments\nwere weighted for these analy-\nses to represent all private em-\nployment establishments in the continental\nUnited States that have at least one employee\nand that offer insurance.\nData were collected by computer-assisted\ntelephone interviews averaging thirty min-\nutes each. The interview was conducted with\nthe person or persons in each establishment\nmost knowledgeable about health benefits\nand firm and worker characteristics. The re-\nsponse rate was 60 percent.\nn Outside consultants. A number of spe-\ncialized concepts and definitions are used in\nthis work. We asked all employers that offer\ninsurance, \"Are the decisions regarding your\nhealth insurance benefits based on input pri-\nmarily from internal staff, primarily outside\nconsultants, or both?\" We then classified em-\nployers as basing decisions on input from in-\nternal staff only or on input from external\nconsultants, the latter including businesses\nusing primarily outsiders and those using\nboth internal and external parties. When ex-\nternal consultants were used, we further clas-\nsified employers by the type of outsider used:\ninsurance agent or broker, third-party admin-\nistrator (TPA), or professional benefits con-\nsultant. We emphasize that the focus of these\nquestions was on substantive decision mak-\ning about the design of benefits. An employer\nmight answer \"internal staff only\" but use an\ninsurance agent or broker to arrange for the\npurchase of a health plan.\nAlthough the sample and analysis unit is\nthe establishment--a physical location of\nbusiness--for many analyses we categorized\nestablishments according to the size of the\nfirm, which includes employees at all loca-\ntions nationwide. Insurance\ndecisions typically are made at\na regional or national level for\nfirms with several estab-\nlishments.\nn Employer character-\nistics. We classified employers\nas self-insured if they offer at\nleast one self-insured plan,\nbased on the respondent's as-\nsessment.4 Several other classi-\nfications were based on the re-\nspondent's self-assessment,\nincluding participation in a pooled purchas-\ning arrangement and whether a plan is an\nEmployers are classified as \"offering a\nchoice of plans\" if they offer two or more\nplans, whether of the same or a different type\nand whether through the same or different\ncarriers. We grouped employers as \"carving\nout\" special benefits--specifically, mental\nhealth or prescription drugs--if they offer a\nseparate single-service plan for these benefits\nor if they separately contract for these benefits\nwith specialized providers as part of their\nself-insured plan. Employers offering a choice\nof plans were classified as \"incorporating\nmanaged competition incentives\" if they pay\nthe same dollar amount for single coverage\nunder each plan, with the employee paying\nthe full difference between the total premium\nand the employer amount. This provides em-\nployees with an incentive to choose lower-\nprice plans.\nn Quality. We also report whether em-\nployers shop for quality in the plans they\nchoose to offer and whether employees are\n\"There is no sys-\ntematic relation-\nship between the\nuse of external\nconsultants and\nemployers' plan\ncosts.\"\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 9 , N u m b e r 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The sur-\nvey collected these data only for firms having\n500 or more employees nationwide. For the\nlatter variable the respondents were further\nrestricted to firms offering a choice of plans.\nThe specific types of information considered\nfor these variables are enrollee satisfaction\nratings and plan performance measures.\nn Premium levels. We measured both\nthe current health insurance premium level\nand the change since the past year. The cur-\nrent premium level is based on plan-specific\ndata, reported separately for single and family\nrates. Some employers offer coverage for spe-\ncial services, such as dental care or prescrip-\ntion drugs, in plans that are separate from the\ngeneral medical plan. We constructed premi-\nums for the package of benefits offered by\nadding together the premiums paid for the\ngeneral medical plan and the plans covering\nspecial services.6 We adjusted the reported\npremiums to control for differences in the\nquantity of coverage provided by different es-\ntablishments--that is, we report a \"quantity-\nadjusted\" premium.7 The measure of change\nsince the past year is based on an estab-\nlishment-level question about change in total\nhealth insurance cost per enrollee since the\nprevious year.\nn State small-group reform. Finally, we\nclassified establishments by the degree of\nsmall-group reform in their state, measured as\nthe interaction of whether all insurance prod-\nucts must be guarantee issued and how\ntightly premium rates are regulated, if at all.\nWe define three classes: high (all products are\nguaranteed issue, and rates cannot be based\non health status, as well as limited or no age\nvariation), medium (all products are guaran-\nteed issue, and rates cannot be based on\nhealth status, but no or limited restriction on\nage variation), or low (everything less restric-\ntive or no restrictions).8\nWe explore the relationship between\nwhether external consultants participated in\nemployers' decision making and the charac-\nteristics of the health insurance plans offered\nby employers. We caution that even if an as-\nsociation is found, the direction of causation\nis not clear. On the one hand, any difference\nmight be the result of the advice offered by the\nexternal consultant. On the other hand, it\ncould just as easily reflect the fact that em-\nployers that are inclined to choose a particular\nplan feature will seek the advice of outsiders\nwith expertise to help them to achieve their\ngoal.\nResults\nFifty-four percent of all employers nation-\nwide use external consultants to help make\ndecisions about health benefits (Exhibit 1).\nEmployers' reliance on outside experts in-\ncreases with firm size. While fewer than half\nof employers with fewer than twenty-five em-\nployees rely on input from external sources,\nnearly two-thirds of those with 500 or more\nemployees involve consultants in their deci-\nsion-making process.\nn Determinants of consultant type.\nAmong employers depending on external con-\nsultants, both the type of specialist and\nwhether more than one type is used vary with\nfirm size (Exhibit 1). Small employers (fewer\nthan 100 employees) generally use only one\ntype of outside adviser, and this consultant is\nnearly always an insurance agent or broker.\nEven when more than one type is consulted,\nan agent or broker is generally involved in the\nemployees) also show considerable reliance\non agents and brokers, but they are more\nlikely to call on others in addition. TPAs are\nmore likely to be used by self-insured employ-\ners. Large employers (500 workers or more)\nshow a greater tendency to rely on benefits\nconsultants to help with health insurance de-\ncisions, both exclusively and in combination\nwith others.\nIt may seem surprising that fewer than half\nof all small businesses report using an agent or\nbroker to design their benefit plan. However,\nemployers' responses to this survey may not\nreflect whether insurance was purchased\nthrough an agent--an insured health plan\ntypically can only be obtained from a licensed\nagent. Rather, the results likely indicate em-\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 0\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

However, only among large employ-\ners was there evidence that external sources\nwere used more frequently if a recent change\nhad been made in the benefit package. Among\ncent that had changed their offerings in the\npast year used consultants, in contrast to 61\npercent of other large employers.\nWe also looked for evidence that partici-\npation in purchasing alliances or other forms\nof pooled purchasing might substitute as a\nsource of information, and thus employers us-\ning these purchasing mechanisms would be\nless likely to report using agents, brokers, or\nother third parties in designing their benefit\nplans. However, those in purchasing alliances\nor other purchasing pools were as likely as\nemployers not participating in pools were to\nreport using external sources (not shown).\nn Plan characteristics and use of con-\nsultants. We found little association between\nplan characteristics and the participation of\nexternal consultants in the decision-making\nprocess (Exhibit 2).9 Contrary to the notion\nthat growth of managed care obviates the need\nfor agents and brokers, we found essentially\nthe same rate of offering an HMO among em-\nployers that use internal staff only as among\nthose that use outside consultants in three of\nfour size groups.\nEmployers using external consultants are\nsomewhat more likely to offer a choice of\nplans. On the other hand, the association with\ncarving out a special benefit, incorporating\nmanaged competition incentives, and using\nquality measurement is either inconsistent\nacross the size groups or is not in the ex-\npected direction. There is no systematic rela-\ntionship between the use of external consult-\nants and employers' plan costs, whether\nmeasured by current premiums or change\nover the past year.\nn Effect of small-group reforms. In\nstates with the strongest small-group insur-\nance reforms there is somewhat less use of\nconsultants by small businesses than in states\nwith medium or low reforms (Exhibit 3). This\nis not a reflection of the general patterns in\nthese groups of states, as indicated by the esti-\nmates for larger businesses. Nonetheless, out-\nsiders are still used by more than 40 percent of\nemployers in these states.

In fact, the use of outside\nconsultants is more prominent among large\nbusinesses than small ones, in contrast to re-\nports from studies of selected communities.\nContrary to our expectations, there is not\nnearly as much difference in the charac-\nteristics of health benefits between employers\nthat use internal staff only and those that use\nexternal consultants. That is, their involve-\nment does not seem to make a difference, at\nleast in the observable characteristics we\nmeasured. However, there may be more subtle\ndifferences that we could not observe. Appar-\nently, the majority of employers would rather\npay outside consultants to acquire informa-\ntion and design plans than to use internal re-\nsources for this process, even though resul-\ntant plan designs do not differ.\nPercentage Of Employers Using External Consultants, By Extent Of Small-Group\nLow\nMedium\nHigh\nSOURCE: 1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance Survey.\nNOTES: Medium reform if guaranteed issue of all plans and moderate rate regulation (FL, KY, NH, OR, VT, WA).
