Trying to lose weight was a negative predictor (P < 0.05) of EI=BEE, intake of energy, and energy density, but\nnot micronutrient intake. Higher mean serum ascorbate, vitamin E, lutein=zeaxanthin, and other carotenoids (men only)\nconcentrations were associated with trying to lose weight (P < 0.05) in both men and women. Few adverse BMI-trying to lose\nweight interaction effects were noted.\nConclusions: There was little evidence of increased nutritional risk in those reportedly trying to lose weight irrespective of\nweight status.\nKeywords: weight loss; dieting; junk food intake; low-nutrient-density foods; dietary patterns; serum vitamins; serum\ncarotenoids; serum lipids; NHANES III\nIntroduction\nIncreasing prevalence of obesity is a global public health\nproblem, and weight control is recommended to alleviate\nthe health risks associated with adiposity (WHO, 2000;\nNational Institutes of Health, 1998). Not surprisingly, there-\nfore, a large proportion of overweight individuals report\nattempting weight loss in national surveys (Serdula et al,\n1999). However, a substantial number of non-overweight\nindividuals also report attempts at weight control\nsubjects classified as non-overweight were attempting weight\ncontrol, as were about 60% of moderately or very overweight\nsubjects in a recently reported study (Neumark-Sztainer\net al, 2000). The NIH Technology Assessment Conference\nPanel (1992) identified the need for understanding the\n*Correspondence: AK Kant, Department of Family, Nutrition, and Exercise\nSciences, Remsen Hall, Room 306E, Queens College of the City University\nE-mail: ashima_kant@qc.edu\nwww.nature.com/ejcn\nwww.nature.com/ejcn\nconsequences of attempting weight loss in individuals who\nare not overweight. It has been suggested that the perception\nof dieting behaviors and consequently nutrient intake of\ndieters may differ by weight status (Neumark-Sztainer et al,\n1997). However, remarkably little is known about the effect\nof interaction of relative body weight and attempting weight\ncontrol on food and nutrient profiles. It is hypothesized that\nnutritional risk profile of non-overweight respondents\nattempting weight control may differ from those of over-\nweight respondents attempting weight control.\nExamination of dietary and nutrient intake in relation to\nbody weight and weight control efforts is complicated by the\nacknowledged problem of dietary misreporting resulting in\nbiased estimates of self-reported intakes of energy and foods\nconsidered nutritional undesirables (Lissner et al, 2000).\nTherefore, it is important to include possible biomarkers of\ndietary exposure to validate self-reported intakes when\nexamining nutritional health in relation to body weight\nand weight control behaviors. The purpose of this study\nwas to examine, in a nationally representative sample of\nUS adults, the relation of body mass index and attempting to\nlose weight with: (1) macro- and micronutrient intake;\n(2) intake of low-nutrient-density foods; and (3) serum bio-\nmarkers of dietary exposure and cardiovascular disease risk.\nMethods\nThis study used data from the third National Health and\nThe NHANES III is a multistage stratified probability sample\nof the non-institutionalized, civilian US population, aged 2\nmonths and over (National Center for Health Statistics, 1994).\nThe survey was conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS), and included administration of a question-\nnaire at home and a full medical exam along with a battery of\ntests in a special mobile examination center (MEC). Demo-\ngraphic and medical history information was obtained during\nthe household interview. The MEC exam included a physical\nand dental exam, dietary interview, body measurements and\ncollection of blood and urine samples. Body weight, height\nand circumference at various body sites were measured using\nstandardized procedures in the MEC. During the MEC exam\nrespondents were asked a global question related to weight\ncontrol, `Are you currently trying to lose weight'?\nDietary assessment method\nA 24 h dietary recall was collected by a trained dietary inter-\nviewer in a MEC interview using an automated, micro-\ncomputer-based interview and coding system (National\nCenter for Health Statistics, 1994). The type and amount of\nfoods consumed were recalled using aids such as abstract food\nmodels, special charts, measuring cups and rulers to help in\nquantifying the amounts consumed. Special probes were used\nto help recall commonly forgotten items such as condiments,\naccompaniments, fast foods and alcoholic beverages.\nAnalytic sample\nAll adults aged 20 y and over were eligible for inclusion\n(n \u00bc 17 030) in this study. A complete and reliable dietary\nrecall (as determined by NCHS) was not available for 1051\nrespondents, leaving 15 979 eligible for inclusion. We further\nexcluded respondents stating that food intake on recalled\nday was `much less' or `much more' than usual (n \u00bc 2245),\nwomen who were pregnant (n \u00bc 282) or nursing (n \u00bc 91),\nthose missing information on body weight (n \u00bc 33) or\nheight (n \u00bc 16), and those missing information on whether\ntrying to lose weight at the time of the survey (n \u00bc 305).\nSome respondents were in more than one exclusion cate-\ngory. The final analytic sample comprised 13 095 respon-\nAssessment of intake of low-nutrient-density foods\nBecause of the prevailing hypothesis about misreporting of\nnutritional undesirables in relation to body weight, it\nwas especially interesting to examine the intake of low-\nnutrient-density foods. To determine the intake of low-\nnutrient-density foods, it was necessary to identify foods\nbelonging to this category from those reported in the 24 h\ndietary recall. As a first step, the 4265 foods reported by adult\nsurvey respondents were classified as belonging to one or\nmore of the five major food groups (dairy, fruit, grain, meat\nand vegetable) or the low-nutrient-density foods group using\nmethods we have described previously (Kant et al, 1991;\nKant, 2000). Briefly, the assignment of foods into the various\ngroups was dependent on their nutrient content and uses in\nthe diet. The dairy group included milk, yogurt, cheese and\nbuttermilk but excluded butter, cream cheese and dairy\ndesserts. The fruit group included all fresh, frozen, dried\nand canned fruits and fruit juices but excluded fruit drinks.\nThe grain group included all breads, cereals, pastas and rice,\nbut excluded pastries. The meat group included meat, poul-\ntry, fish, eggs and meat alternates such as dried beans, nuts\nand seeds. The vegetable group included all raw or cooked\nfresh, frozen and canned vegetables and juices. Mixed dishes\ncontaining foods from several groups were grouped into all\nthe relevant groups. Foods excluded from these major food\ngroups were grouped into the low-nutrient-density foods\ngroup. The low-nutrient-density foods were further placed\ninto four subgroups as follows: (1) visible fat -- butter, oil,\ndressings, gravies, etc.; (2) sweeteners -- sugar, syrup, candy,\ncarbonated and non-carbonated sweetened drinks, etc.; (3)\nbaked and dairy desserts -- cookies, cakes, pies, pastries, ice\ncream, puddings, cheese cakes, etc.; and (4) salted snacks --\npotato, corn, tortilla chips, etc.\nThe NHANES III nutrient database for individual foods,\nwhich is derived from the US Department of Agriculture's\nSurvey Nutrient Data base (National Center for Health\nStatistics, 1997), was used to determine energy and nutrient\ncontent of all foods. The nutrients examined included:\nvitamins A, E, B6\n, folate and C, and the minerals iron and\ncalcium. The intake of each nutrient was compared with the\nBMI\u00adtrying to lose weight and nutritional profiles\nAK Kant\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nrespective age \u00ad sex-specific standard available. The standards\nused were 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for\nprotein, and Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for vitamins A,\nfolate, iron, and calcium (Food and Nutrition Board,\nAs an estimate of dietary misreporting, a ratio of reported\nenergy intake (EI) to energy expenditure for basal needs\n(BEE) was computed. BEE was estimated using age \u00ad sex \u00ad\nweight specific equations according to Schofield (1985).\nData on serum concentrations of vitamin C, folate, car-\notenoids and lipid were obtained from the NCHS public\nrelease compact disc (National Center for Health Statistics,\nanalytes and their associated errors have been described in\nNCHS publications (National Center for Health Statistics,\na-carotene, b-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin, lutein=zeaxanthin\nand lycopene -- were chosen because the dietary intake of\nthese nutrients is believed to be a determinant of serum\nconcentration of the respective nutrient and thus can serve\nas biomarker of dietary exposure (Food and Nutrition Board,\none reason for advocating weight loss is to improve serum\nlipid profiles (National Institutes of Health, 1998).\nStatistical analyses\nThe mean daily energy, percent energy from macronutrients,\npercentage energy from low-nutrient-density food groups\n(separately and combined), mean percentage of the popula-\ntion meeting the RDA or DRI of selected nutrients, mean\nserum concentration of selected vitamers and analytes,\nadjusted for multiple covariates, were obtained by weighted\ntertiles of BMI and response to question about whether trying\nto lose weight at the time of the survey, separately for men\nand women. All covariates for inclusion in the various multi-\nple regression models were decided a priori based on known\nrelationships of dietary, socio-demographic, lifestyle and\nbiological variables. The estimates of nutrient and food\ngroup intake were adjusted for age (continuous), race (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American,\nother), education (continuous), smoking status (never,\nformer, current), and level of weekly recreational physical\nactivity (none, 1 \u00ad 2 times=week, > 2 times=week), whether\nchanged diet for medical reasons in the past 12 months (yes,\nno), self-reported history of diabetes, hypertension or heart\ndisease (yes, no). The estimates of mean serum analyte con-\ncentrations were adjusted for age (continuous), race (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,\nother), hours of fasting before phlebotomy, supplement use\nin the last 24 h before phlebotomy (yes, no, unknown),\nsupplement use in the past month (yes, no), whether chan-\nged diet for medical reasons in the past 12 months (yes, no),\nself-reported history of diabetes, hypertension or heart dis-\nease (yes, no), dietary intake of folate, vitamin C, vitamin E\nand carotenoids for serum folate, vitamin C, vitamin E and\ncarotenoids (all continuous), respectively, smoking status\n(vitamin C and carotenoids), and alcohol intake (HDL-cho-\nlesterol only), serum triglycerides and cholesterol (carote-\nnoids and serum vitamin E). The procedure used to obtain\ncovariate-adjusted estimates and standard errors from survey\ndata is based on Taylor linearization methods according to\nGraubard and Korn (1999). All statistical analyses were per-\nformed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., 2000), and software\ndesigned for analysis of survey data (SUDAAN; Shah et al,\n1997). This software generates variance estimates that are\ncorrected for multi-stage stratified probability design of com-\nplex surveys. Sample weights provided by the NCHS to\ncorrect for differential probabilities of selection, non-cover-\nage, and non-response were used in all analyses to obtain\npoint estimates (National Center for Health Statistics, 1994).\nThe independent association of BMI, and attempting\nweight loss or the interaction of BMI with attempting\nweight loss, with intake of foods, nutrients and serum\nanalytes was examined using regression procedures to\nadjust for multiple covariates mentioned above. Linear\nregression procedures were used when the outcome variables\nwere continuous (eg dietary nutrient intake, or serum nutri-\nent concentration). For categorical outcomes such as\nwhether or not standard of a nutrient intake was met, we\nused logistic regression procedures. In these regression\nmodels, BMI was entered as a continuous variable and\nattempting to lose weight as a categorical (yes, no) variable,\nalong with a BMI \u00ad trying to lose weight interaction term. If\nthe interaction term was non-significant (P ! 0.05), regres-\nsion models were run again after excluding the interaction\nterm from the model.\nResults\nSociodemographic profile\nTable 1 lists the percentage of the population in categories of\nvarious sociodemographic variables by tertiles of BMI, by\nresponse to question about whether trying to lose weight at\nthe time of the survey. Approximately 34% of the population\nanswered yes to trying to lose weight. A higher proportion of\n50 y olds, and women in each tertile of BMI were trying to\nlose weight at the time of survey. The proportion of non-\nwhites, those with < 12 y of education, and no regular\nweekly physical activity increased with increasing BMI. A\nsmaller proportion of those answering yes to trying to lose\nweight reported no regular weekly physical activity. In each\nBMI tertile, a higher proportion of those trying to lose\nweight had never smoked. The proportion reporting vita-\nmin=mineral supplement use in the past month decreased\nwith increasing BMI, but within each tertile of BMI, a higher\nproportion of those attempting weight loss reported supple-\nment use. The proportion with self-reported health as excel-\nlent or very good decreased with increasing BMI, which was\nconsistent with increase in self-reported history of diabetes,\nhypertension, or heart disease with increasing BMI.

If the interaction was not significant, separate models after excluding the interaction\nterm were run to determine the main effect of BMI and trying to lose weight now status.\nBMI\u00adtrying to lose weight and nutritional profiles\nAK Kant\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nDiscussion\nThe interaction effects of BMI and trying to lose weight were\ngenerally small, with a slightly higher proportion of men\ntrying to lose weight at higher BMI reporting all five food\ngroups but a lower mean percentage of energy from low-\nnutrient-density foods. To my knowledge, other studies\nwhere food and nutrient intake profiles of those attempting\nweight loss in relation to body weight have been examined\nare not available for comparison. Energy intake is the only\nvariable for which a weight status \u00ad trying to lose weight\ninteraction has been reported previously. Neumark-Sztainer\nreported no differences in the energy intake reported by\nnon-overweight current dieters vs non-dieters, but energy\nintake of overweight current dieters was lower than that of\nnon-dieters (Neumark-Sztainer et al, 1997). Such a finding\nsuggests that weight status modified the relation of energy\nintake with dieting status. This interaction was not observed\nin the present study. Notably, however the question used to\nelicit weight loss behavior as well as the method of dietary\nassessment differed in the two studies.\nThe observations of lower reported energy intake, energy\ndensity, and EI=BEE ratio in those trying to lose weight are\nconsistent with the expected changes in food selection with\nweight loss attempts (Andersson et al, 2000). However, the\nextent to which these results reflect reporting bias vs actual\ndietary behaviors cannot be ascertained without independent\nvalidation of dietary intakes. With the exception of an\nincreased risk of not meeting the weight-based protein stan-\ndard (0.8g=kg body weight), attempting weight loss was not\nassociated with a significantly increased risk of inadequate\nintake of the nutrients examined despite lower energy intake\n(except vitamin E in women and iron in men at higher BMI). A\ntrend for a lower proportion of those attempting weight loss\nmeeting the calcium standard was noted but did not reach\nstatistical significance. Ritt et al (1979) also identified iron and\ncalcium as nutrients at risk in diets used for weight control.\nMore recently, vitamin E, calcium, iron and zinc were identi-\nfied as nutrients that were consumed at lower levels from a\nwell-planned, energy-restricted diet (Benzera et al, 2001). Con-\nversely, Neumark-Sztainer et al (1996) reported higher intakes\nof many micronutrients estimated from a 60-item food fre-\nquency questionnaire in adult dieters relative to non-dieters.\nThere are few published reports where changes in serum\nvitamer status of subjects trying to control weight have been\ninvestigated to enable comparison with results of the present\nstudy. Notably, trying to lose weight was a positive indepen-\ndent predictor of serum ascorbate, vitamin E and most\ncarotenoids in both men and women trying to lose weight,\nwhich supports the notion of better dietary selections with\nattempting weight loss. Also, at higher BMI, there was a\nsuggestion of improvement in serum lipid profiles in men\ntrying to lose weight.\nAlthough BMI was not a significant predictor of total\nenergy intake, it was a strong inverse predictor of EI=BEE\nindependent of trying to lose weight status, confirming\nthat energy reporting relative to requirement for basal\nexpenditure was lower at higher BMI (Lissner et al, 2000).\nBMI was not an independent predictor of percentage of\nenergy intake from all low-nutrient-density foods combined\nor most low-nutrient-density subgroups in women; in men\nlow-nutrient-density food reporting showed an interaction of\nBMI with trying to lose weight (Table 3). These results do not\nsupport the suggestion that BMI, especially in women, was\nassociated with differential reporting of nutritionally unde-\nsirable low-nutrient-density foods as a proportion of the total\nenergy intake. These results differ from other reports where\nBMI was an independent negative predictor of intake of\nsugar, fat or other low-nutrient-density foods (Slattery et al,\nsistent with other reports, in the present study, BMI was an\nindependent positive predictor of percentage of energy from\ntotal fat, but negative predictor of percentage of energy from\nIncreased prevalence of low serum folate in overweight\nrelative to non-overweight subjects and the negative asso-\nciation of BMI with plasma ascorbate and b-carotene noted\nin this study has been previously reported (Hotzel 1986;\nrelation of serum vitamin E and BMI are inconsistent. While\nthe findings of Moor de Burgos et al (1992) are in accord with\nour results, Wallstrom et al (2001) reported a positive\nassociation of cholesterol adjusted BMI with serum toco-\npherol in men and no relation in women. Little has been\npublished on possible explanations for the BMI effect on\ncirculating vitamers and carotenoids. Putative reasons may\ninclude increased utilization, dilution, redistribution, or\ntissue sequestration of these nutrients (Hebert et al, 1994).\nRecent data on vitamin D metabolism in association with\nadiposity suggest that tissue sequestration of fat soluble\nanalytes may partially explain lower circulating levels\nThe strengths of this study include a large, nationally\nrepresentative sample of US adults for whom information\non most major confounders of BMI \u00ad diet association, along\nwith objective markers of nutrient intake, was available.\nLimitations that warrant a cautious interpretation of results\nof this study include the following. The estimates of food\nand nutrient intake for men in the first tertile of BMI who\nanswered yes to attempting weight loss may be somewhat\nunreliable due to small numbers. The question `Are you\ncurrently trying to lose weight?' does not specifically probe\nhow the weight loss is being attempted or the duration or\nefficacy of these attempts. A positive response to the\nquestion probably includes individuals using non-dietary\nstrategies which will probably attenuate the relation of this\nvariable with dietary and biochemical outcomes. Although it\nis notable that consistent with expectation, energy intake\nand energy density in those attempting weight loss was\nlower. Also, in a recent survey, over 90% of those reporting\nattempts at weight control included dietary strategies\nBMI\u00adtrying to lose weight and nutritional profiles\nAK Kant\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\n(Serdula et al, 1999). It is also possible that some individuals,\nespecially at higher BMI, replied affirmatively to trying to\nlose weight due to their perception of it being the expected\nor desired response. Thus it is likely that the reliability of this\nresponse for classifying individuals as whether or not weight\nloss was being attempted differs by BMI status. One can\nnevertheless argue that a positive response to this question\nmay at least be an indicator for concern about body weight,\nwhich may in turn relate to dietary behaviors as is evident\nfrom the data presented.\nAll methods of dietary assessment, including the 24 h\nrecall used in NHANES III, have several inherent measure-\nrecall are generally reliable for assessing groups, but not\nindividuals. Accordingly, in the present analyses, the\nconclusions are limited to groups. Nevertheless, because\nthe estimates presented are not adjusted for within-subject\nvariability in reported food intake, measurement error may\nhave contributed to the inability to find significant\ndifferences. The results presented in Table 4 warrant cautious\ninterpretation as prevalence of inadequacy of micronutrients\nfrom a single dietary measurement tends to be over-\nestimated. Thus, it is preferable to interpret this table as\nindicating trends rather than prevalence estimates. In the\npresent study, dietary ascorbate, folate, vitamin E and\ncarotenoid intake was a significant independent predictor of\nserum concentration of the respective nutrients, providing\nan independent validation of the estimated dietary intake.\nThese results suggest that for most examined food,\nnutrient, and biomarker outcomes nutritional health was\nnot compromised in those reportedly trying to lose weight\nirrespective of weight status. On the average, reporting of\nlower intake of energy, and energy density in those\nconcerned about their weight was not associated with lower\nmicronutrient intake irrespective of the degree of adiposity,\nsuggesting a more judicious pattern of food selection. If the\ndifferences in dietary behaviors of those concerned about\nbody weight are not largely due to reporting bias, these\nbehaviors may help in decreasing the risk of subsequent\nmajor weight gain in groups of varying BMI. To my know-\nledge, no prospective studies of such groups have been pub-\nlished. These results provide little evidence for discouraging\nattempts to lose weight on nutritional grounds. However, this\nstudy did not focus on psychological or other physical con-\nsequences, if any, of adopting reported dietary behaviors by\nthose concerned about body weight. Further work is needed\non evaluation of nutritional status using biomarkers in rela-\ntion to BMI, changes in biomarkers and variation in nutri-\ntional risk due to different strategies for weight management\nand repeated attempts at weight control.\n"
