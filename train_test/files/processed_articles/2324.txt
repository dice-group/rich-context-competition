The objective of this study was to assess changes\nin the annual rate of referrals to other physicians from\nphysician office visits in the United States from 1999 to\nMethods: We analyzed nationally representative cross-\nsections of ambulatory patient visits in the United States,\nbulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Am-\nmeasures were survey-weighted estimates of the total\nnumber and percentage of visits resulting in a referral to\nanother physician across several patient and physician\ncharacteristics.\nbulatory visit to a physician resulted in a referral to an-\na 94% increase. The absolute number of visits resulting\nin a physician referral increased 159% nationally during\nthis time, from 41 million to 105 million. This trend was\nconsistent across all subgroups examined, except for\nslower growth among physicians with ownership stakes\nin their practice (P=.02) or those with the majority of\nincome from managed care contracts (P=.007). Changes\nin referral rates varied according to the principal symp-\ntoms accounting for patients' visits, with significant in-\ncreases noted for visits to primary care physicians from\npatients with cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, orthope-\ndic, dermatologic, and ear/nose/throat symptoms.\nConclusions: The percentage and absolute number of\nambulatory visits resulting in a referral in the United States\nnecessary to understand the contribution of rising refer-\nral rates to costs of care.\nto refer a patient to an-\nother physician is an im-\nportant determinant of\nhealth care quality and\nspending.1-5 Patients who are referred to\nspecialists tend to incur greater health care\nspending compared with those who re-\nmain within primary care, even after ad-\njusting for health status.5 Although ap-\npropriate specialist referrals improve\nquality, overuse of referrals could in-\ncrease use of health care services without\nbenefit.4 Referrals and the associated coor-\ndinationofcareforreferredpatientsarealso\nimportant components of primary care.6\nDespite the central role of referrals in\nhealth care systems, relatively little re-\nsearch has examined the epidemiologic\ncharacteristics of physician referrals na-\ntionally. The existing literature7-10 (com-\nprehensively reviewed by Mehrotra et al10)\nsuggests that referral rates across physi-\ncians vary substantially. Although clear\nbenchmarks are lacking, it is likely that\nboth overuse and underuse are preva-\nlent.10 National trends of physician refer-\nral rates in the United States have not been\nthe importance of physician referrals and\nchanges in medical practice and knowl-\nedge during the ensuing period, it is im-\nportant to understand how referral pat-\nterns have changed nationally since that\ntime. In addition, with the adoption of bud-\ngeted payment arrangements as envi-\nsioned with accountable care organiza-\ntions, referrals will likely become a more\nimportant focus of both policymakers and\nmanagers in their attempts to control\nhealth care spending and maintain refer-\nrals within organizations.\nIn this study, we examined ambulatory\ntional Ambulatory Medical Care Survey\nFor editorial comment\nAuthor Affil\nDepartment\nPolicy, Harv\n(Drs Barnett\nMr Song), D\nInternal Med\nof Medicine\nWomen's Ho\nand Division\nand General\nDepartment\nIsrael Deaco\nCenter (Dr L\nMassachuset\nAging and H\nNational Bu\nResearch, Ca\nMassachuset\nAuthor Affiliations:\nDepartment of Health Care\nPolicy, Harvard Medical School\n(Drs Barnett and Landon and\nMr Song), Division of General\nInternal Medicine, Department\nof Medicine, Brigham and\nWomen's Hospital (Dr Barnett),\nand Division of Primary Care\nand General Internal Medicine,\nDepartment of Medicine, Beth\nIsrael Deaconess Medical\nCenter (Dr Landon), Boston,\nMassachusetts; and Program in\nAging and Health Economics,\nNational Bureau of Economic\nResearch, Cambridge,\nMassachusetts (Mr Song).\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.

We focused on the period of continuous data from\nresentative of outpatient physician visits nationally. Documen-\ntation of survey methods are available at the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS) Web site.14 The Harvard Medical School\nCommittee on Human Studies determined that this study was\nexempt from review.\nBoth NAMCS and NHAMCS use a multistage probability sample\ndesign to obtain nationally representative samples of ambula-\ntory patient visits in the United States.15,16 In the first stage of\nsampling, 112 primary sampling units were selected among those\nused in the National Health Interview Survey. For the second\nstage, physician practices or hospitals were chosen within these\nprimary sampling units. Finally, physicians or clinics sampled\na subset of visits in their practices during a predefined period.\nIn NAMCS, individual physicians sampled a percentage of vis-\nits during a 1-week period; in NHAMCS, outpatient clinics\nsampled visits during a 4-week period.\nThis design enables calculation of national-level estimates\nand associated standard errors using survey weights provided\nData for each visit were collected using a standardized form com-\npleted during each visit. Variables included patient demo-\ngraphic information (age, sex, insurance type, and race), as well\nas clinical details, such as the patient's reason for the visit, phy-\nsician diagnosis, and visit disposition. The primary outcome\nin this study was any visit disposition of a referral to another\nphysician. This measure was shown in one study12 to correlate\nwith independent observation of physician visits with high speci-\nficity and moderate sensitivity and thus most likely underes-\ntimates the number of referrals. We also defined a self-referral\nTable 1.

Item-level nonresponse was gen-\nerally less than 5% across all survey items.\nWe analyzed referral rates by patient characteristics, physician\ncharacteristics, and visit setting. Variables analyzed included age\nblack, and other by patient report), insurance (private, Medi-\ncare, Medicaid, and other/uninsured [included worker's com-\npensation,self-pay,charity,other,andunknowninsurance]),and\nUS region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). In 2005, the\nsurveyitemforpatientinsurancetypechangedfroma\"markone\"\nform of payment to \"mark all that apply,\" potentially affecting\nany analysis of trends that rely on patient insurance type during\nthis period. In addition, in the NHAMCS data, the referral dis-\nposition survey item (our main outcome) changed from \"re-\nferred to other physician/clinic\" to \"referred to other physician\"\nin 2001. Physician characteristics included whether physicians\npracticed in a solo setting, owned their practice in part or in full,\nmade consults with patients by e-mail or telephone (first col-\nlected in 2001), had any form of electronic medical record, and\nreceived more than 50% of their income from managed care con-\ntracts or Medicaid (first collected in 2003).\nTo analyze referral rates by physician specialty, we re-\nstricted our analyses to survey data from NAMCS because phy-\nsician specialty is not available in NHAMCS. We grouped spe-\ncialties into 2 broad categories: primary care, which included\nphysicians in general and family practice, internal medicine,\nand pediatrics without subspecialty, and specialist, which in-\ncluded all other physicians (including obstetrics and gynecol-\nogy, which is grouped as primary care in NAMCS).\nTo explore the possibility that changes in referral rates were\ndisproportionately due to patients with particular diseases or\nsymptoms, we examined how often PCPs or specialists re-\nferred patients with particular symptoms in the first 4 years\nriod covered in our sample, using the first listed, or most im-\nportant, reason for visit given by patients. We limited these analy-\nses to the 46.5% of visits for which the primary reason for visit\ninvolved a symptom (eg, chest pain, but not general medical\nexamination or coronary atherosclerosis). Using the reason for\nvisit coding system developed by the NCHS,17 we categorized\nall coded symptoms into 12 organ-based categories (details in\nthe eAppendix; http://www.archinternmed.com).\nWe calculated weighted numbers of visits, referral rates, and\ntheir standard errors, taking account of the multistage probabil-\nity design as suggested by NCHS using the survey (version 3.22)\nused US Census data provided in the NAMCS documentation\nto calculate visits per 1000 persons. As NCHS recommends, we\ndid not include estimates with a relative standard error (defined\nas the standard error divided by the estimate) of greater than or\nequal to 30% or sample sizes of 30 or fewer visits, as these val-\nues are considered unreliable by NCHS standards.\nWe tested for trends across time using survey-weighted lo-\ngistic regression by estimating the P value of the coefficient for\nyear as an explanatory variable for the outcome of physician\nreferral disposition across the relevant subgroup. Trend tests\nated for the difference between trends for physician character-\nistics using analysis of covariance, including an interaction term\nwith year. We evaluated the difference in referral rates by symp-\na survey-weighted 2 test. All statistical tests were 2-tailed, with\nP.05 considered significant.\nRESULTS\nity that a physician visit resulted in a referral to another\nphysician (referral rate) increased from 4.8% to 9.3%\nriod, the total number of ambulatory visits in the United\nbined with a national trend of increasing numbers of am-\nbulatory visits, this led to a 159% increase in the na-\ntional absolute number of visits resulting in a physician\nReferral rates for Medicare patients more than doubled\ncrease in the number of visits annually, resulted in an\nincrease of more than 350% in the number of visits re-\nsulting in a referral for Medicare beneficiaries.\nThe increase in referral rates was significant for both\noffice-based physicians and outpatient department\u00ad\nbased physician practices.

These trends are consis-\ntent across primary care and specialist physicians as well\nas office-based and outpatient department\u00adbased physi-\ncians. The increase in referral rates does not appear to\nbe predominantly driven by a particular patient demo-\ngraphic creating more demand for referrals. This evolu-\ntion in care patterns may be playing a role in the rising\ntrajectory of health care spending in the United States\nbecause referrals to specialists may lead to increased use\nof higher-cost services.\nOne potentially contradictory finding is that, despite\nthe marked increase in the referral rate, the proportion of\nall ambulatory visits to specialists has remained stable at\napproximately 50%. This can be explained in a few ways:\nfirst, because specialists refer to PCPs,20 referrals do not\nalwaysimplyanewspecialistvisit;second,self-referralrates\ndecreased by about 19 million, which could explain up\nSymptom Category\nVisits Resulting in Referral, % (SE)\nTop 3 Most Frequently Referred\nSymptoms (RFV Code)c\nShoulder pain, ache, soreness, discomfort (1940.1)\nAbbreviations: NOS, not otherwise specified; RFV, reason for visit; URI, upper respiratory infection.\naOnly visits from patients aged 18 years or older to primary care physicians are included.

An-\nother contributing factor is that only about half of refer-\nrals result in a completed appointment.21,22\nThere are several explanations for the increase in rates\nof referrals. One possibility is that care is becoming in-\ncreasingly complex, thereby requiring ever more care by\nspecialized physicians.23,24 We find some evidence to sup-\nport this hypothesis in Table 3, which shows that PCPs\nbecame more likely to refer patients with certain chief\nconcerns but not others across the interval from 1999-\ncant changes for patients with cardiovascular or derma-\ntologic symptoms but not in areas that are more\ncomfortably within the scope of primary care, such as gen-\neral/viral symptoms. Specialist physicians saw no signifi-\ncant change in referral rates in these areas. Likewise, chief\nconcerns outside the traditional spectrum of primary care,\nsuch as ocular or gynecologic/breast symptoms, had a con-\nsistently high likelihood of referral from PCPs but had\nno significant change in referral rate. This suggests that\nsome areas, such as cardiovascular and ear/nose/throat\nsymptoms, may be increasingly outside the expertise or\nclinical portfolio of PCPs to manage alone. Other areas,\nsuch as gastrointestinal and orthopedic symptoms, had\nconsistently increasing referral rates for PCPs and spe-\ncialists, which may reflect increasing influence of those\nspecialties in health care markets.\nA related hypothesis is that physicians are increas-\ningly faced with more to do during the typical visit de-\nspite no meaningful change in appointment duration in\n2 decades.25 Patients require more medications and more\nSymptom Category\nVisits Resulting in Referral, Mean (SE), %\nTop 3 Most Frequently Referred\nSymptoms (RFV Code)c\nLow back pain, ache, soreness, discomfort (1910.1)\nOther symptoms/problems related to psychological\nAbbreviations: NOS, not otherwise specified; RFV, reason for visit; URI, upper respiratory infection.\naOnly visits from patients aged 18 years or older to specialist physicians are included.

As a result,\nalthough visit time has remained stable, physicians, and\nin particular PCPs, may not have enough time to ad-\ndress each patient issue, resulting in increased rates of\nreferrals. Finally, increasing numbers of specialists and\navailability of specialist physicians may influence refer-\nral rates.27 This may help explain why hospital-based phy-\nsicians in closer proximity to specialists in the hospital\nsetting have referral rates close to double those of office-\nbased physicians.\nWe also found that physicians who had an owner-\nship stake in their practice had lower increases in refer-\nral rates compared with their nonowner colleagues, which\nmight reflect a financial incentive for these physicians to\nkeep patients' care within their practice. Supporting the\npotential influence of economic incentives on referral\nrates, physicians with more than 50% of their income from\nmanaged care contracts also had slower growth in refer-\nral rates. Another notable result is that patients in the 3-\ncompared with those older than 65 years, although this\nhad a lower referral rate than did younger adults in 1999\nand 2009, which may reflect that the former group had\ngenerally already developed relationships with provid-\ners at an earlier age for their chronic illnesses.\nIt is unclear whether the trends that we observed re-\nflect a change in the appropriateness of referrals. This is\nthe result, in part, of the fact that little guidance exists\non how to optimally define the appropriate use of refer-\nrals. A recent review10 of the literature concluded that ap-\npropriateness of referrals has yet to be studied effec-\ntively. The complexity of referral appropriateness is\ncompounded by the multiple roles that specialists can play\nin the care of a patient, ranging from consultative to pro-\ncedural to comanaging a complex condition.6\nThis study is subject to several limitations. First, we\nrelied on the accuracy of reporting in the NAMCS and\nNHAMCS instruments to measure referrals, which has\nbeen shown in one study12 to have high specificity but\nonly moderate sensitivity. The survey question for this\nfield also changed in 2001 for NHAMCS, from \"referred\nto physician/clinic\" to \"referred to physician.\" We would\nexpect this wording change to narrow the potential range\nof reasons to check this category and bias our findings\ntoward the null. Thus, the referral rates in this study are,\nif anything, likely underestimating national rates. Sec-\nond, we had no information on why a referral was made\nor to whom it was made. This is particularly relevant for\nthe results in Tables 3 and 4, where we relied on the as-\nsumption of a relationship between a patient's primary\nreason for visit and the reason for referral. We believe\nthat, on average, it is clinically reasonable to assume that\na referral has a high likelihood of relating to the primary\nreason that brought a patient to visit the physician, but\nthis may not always be the case. Another limitation of\nthis study is that the response rate to NAMCS has fluc-\nWe believe that this is not likely to explain much of the\nchange seen, especially given that the response rate for\nalso a possibility that our findings were affected by the\nchanging demographic characteristics of the popula-\ntion. Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey\ngraphic composition by insurance status and income of\nAmericans reporting that they had 1 or more office vis-\nits to a physician in the past year were stable (authors'\nanalysis, data from http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/). Fi-\nnally, we relied on the accuracy of the sampling strategy\nof NAMCS and NHAMCS to produce nationally repre-\nsentative estimates.\nIn conclusion, we found that referrals in the United\nStates from PCPs to specialists grew rapidly from 1999\nto 2009, with potential implications for health care spend-\ning. As federal and state policymakers consider policies\nfor reforming the health care system, developing meth-\nods to measure referral appropriateness and using these\nto promote appropriate referrals may be an important\nstrategy for controlling growth in health care spending.\nCorrespondence: Bruce E.
