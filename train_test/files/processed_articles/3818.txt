This article examines\nthe English spelling system against the backdrop of Educated Nigerian English and the concept of nativization, stressing the\nneed for reform or nativized spelling in Nigerian English. Questionnaires, library research, and the Internet were used to\ngather data for this study. The qualitative approach has been adopted in the main for the interpretation of data. The educated\nNigerians studied admit that the English spelling system is in part so confusing that they misspell words at times. Therefore,\nthey support the reform or nativization of English spelling. Consequently, this article presents and illustrates proposed\nreformed spelling by deleting redundant letters, unnecessary clusters of letters, dropping useless silent letters, regularizing\ndigraph, and spelling compound words in one form only. These changes will enhance spelling skills, teaching, reading, and\nwriting in English as a Second Language.\n",

The selection of these universities was informed by\ntheir strategic locations across Nigeria and the fact that they\nuse a Nigerian Federal Government policy called \"Quota\nSystem,\" or \"Federal Character,\" to admit students from\n\"catchment areas\" and all the regions of Nigeria.\nSubjects aged between 19 and 70 years were tested from\nprofessors, lecturers, and final year students of English and\nLiterature, Linguistics, and Communication Departments\nwho were considered, or should be, models of English use\nand usage in Nigeria. The questionnaire was an adaptation or\nspelling reforms. Ten thousand of the questionnaire sheets\nwere collated and analyzed for compound word spelling. The\nresult is presented in a table in simple percentile count with\nannotations. Some other parameters used were observed cur-\nrency, ubiquity, and acceptability of the examples docu-\nmented here among educated Nigerians.\nTherefore, the article basically adopted both the qualita-\ntive and, to some extent, the quantitative methods. The quali-\ntative approach supports the use of the researcher's sensitivity\nand keen attention to linguistic details, which determines\nhow the researcher interprets his or her data. In this regard,\nkeen attention was paid to the corpus of data generated on\nspelling in particular and the English spelling system as well\nas the structures of words in general. Conclusion and recom-\nmendations were drawn from the responses collated and\nobserved trends.\nHistory of English in Relation to Spelling\nLittle drops of spelling at different times and from different\nsources made the present mighty and confusing ocean of\nEnglish spelling system. Etymologically, the words English\nand England derive from Anglo, Angles, or the Anglos, a\ngroup of Germanic invaders of the British Isle who spoke a\nProto-Germanic language called Old English from 500 to\ning Old and Middle English periods were in a flux until the\npublication of Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English\nLanguage in 1755, which subsequently established relative\nstability in the spelling and meanings of words. However, the\nlanguage is still unstable; for even in Modern English, which\nstarted in the 15th century, there are different varieties of\nsuccessive ages. The socio-political events and conquests of\neach period heavily influenced the features of its English.\nThe Anglo-Saxon, Danish Invasions, and particularly the\nNorman Conquest in 1066, left their linguistic imprints in the\nEnglish that we use now. The Normans were Vikings in the\nFrench Coast who invaded the English Isle, led by William\nthe Conqueror, the Duke of Normandy. There language and\nculture were French. They overwhelmed England militarily,\npolitically, culturally, and linguistically. Of all the invasions\nof England, the Norman Conquest influenced the English\nlanguage more than any other (Jowitt, 2009; Kpolugbo,\nFrench words that are still used today. Coming with these\nwords were new meanings, spellings, and pronunciations.\nBrook (1958) said that the Norman Conquest introduced\n\"drastic modification of English spelling to make it conform\nto the practice of French scribes\" (p. 50), a view also shared\nTracing the origin of writing system, Bloomfield (1934)\nstated that \"learned scribes\" did \"invent pseudo-archaic\nspelling\" from \"antiquated\" spelling rules:\nThe words debt, doubt, subtle contained no [b]- in Old French,\nwhence English received them, and were written both in French\nand in English as dette, doute, sutil; the present-day spellings\nwith b were invented by scribes who knew the far-off Latin\nantecedents of the French words, debitum, dubito, subtilis. (p.\nKimball (n.d.) is likewise of the view that present-day\nspellings do not really reflect the history of how the words\nhave always been spelt:\nWe can't change spellings because the current forms reflect their\nhistories . . . ? The \"s\" in \"island\" was not in the original spelling,\nbut was inserted later--and thus is etymologically incorrect. The\n\"b\" in \"crumb\" and \"thumb\" were intentionally added a few\ncenturies ago as silent letters. So was the \"g\" in \"foreign\" and\n\"sovereign\" (those two words are completely unrelated to\n\"reign\"), the \"h\" in \"ghost,\" and the \"p\" in \"ptarmigan.\" The \"h\"\nand the \"y\" in \"rhyme,\" and the use of \"ch\" in \"ache\" are\nsimilarly spurious (one could make a case for the \"c\" in \"ache\"\nhaving a historic basis, but the use of the \"h\" after it is purely\nspurious). \"Iland,\" \"crum,\" \"thum,\" \"forein,\" \"soverein,\"\n\"gost,\" \"tarmigan,\" \"rime,\" and \"ake\" are spellings that more\nclosely show the true origins of those words, while the current\nforms that \"look right\" are not really showing the correct history.\nIn addition, other factors like the Renaissance, the Great\nVowel Shift, the coming of the printing press to England in\n1476 by William Caxton, technology, the Industrial\nRevolution, imperialism, and so on, introduced many words\nand strange spellings into the English language (Crystal,\n2005). The Great Vowel Shift, for instance, which took place\nin the end of Middle English, witnessed a set of significant\nvowel changes and additions. These changes led to major\ndifferences between the spelling of Modern English and its\npronunciation at present (Udofot, 2010). The present spell-\nings of a number of words reflect the pronunciations of the\nwords in Old and Middle English. The Great Vowel Shift\ncreated many phonological rules and caused differences\nEkundayo 3\nbetween the articulation of some Modern English words and\ntheir spellings (Akmajian, Demers, Farmer, & Harnish,\n2006). With the emergence of the Internet, computer and cell\nphones, and the enormous global reliance on them, new\nspellings of words have emerged and gradually invaded the\nterritory of formal writing in standard spellings in world\nEnglishes, NE inclusive. For example, some SMS and email\nwriters now find it convenient to spell \"you\" as \"u,\" \"night'\nas \"nait\" or \"nite,\" \"cook\" as \"kuk,\" and so on.\nNativization of English in Nigeria\nThe reality has been acknowledged that when a language\nleaves its native land for a foreign land, it is bound to undergo\nmany sociolinguistic changes and manipulations (Ahwefeada\nnow universally used in linguistics to denote the indigeniza-\ntion of language in a nonnative, second language setting\nmeans,\nAcculturation or adaptability to new environment; it also\nconnotes naturalization, which is the term used when a person\ntakes up the citizenship of another country where he or she is\ndomiciled. Nativization is therefore a term now commonly used\namong sociolinguists for describing the indigenization of\nEnglish in a second language environment. (p. 98)\n\"Nativisation is a common feature of all institutionalized\nsecond language varieties of English\" (Igboanusi, 2005, p.\nNigeria goes beyond the transfer of Nigerian language fea-\ntures into English. It also includes the creative use of English,\n\"including the evolution of distinctly Nigerian usages, atti-\ntudes and pragmatic use of the language\" (p. 11).\n\"Indigenization,\" \"domestication,\" \"naturalization,\" \"accul-\nturation,\" and \"Nigerianisation\" are also used to denote\nnativization of English in Nigeria. In relation to the spelling\nreform suggested here, a more proper term may be\nNigerianization or spelling innovation as the proposed\nchanges in spelling involve the manipulation, deletion, addi-\ntion, and reorganization of English rules and symbols.\nNigerian English Varieties\nThree major typologies are usually used for the categoriza-\ntion of NE varieties; namely, regions, formal education, and\nsociolinguistics. In terms of regions, there exist different\nvarieties of English in Nigeria: Hausa, Yoruba, Ibo, Efik,\nUrhobo, and so on. Each regional variety has its linguistic\nvariations, on the one hand, and similarities to the others, on\nthe other hand. Phonological features differentiate regional\nvarieties. With formal education, a number of classifications\nhave been made. Prominent among them are Brosnahan's\nI, II, III, and IV and Adesanoye's (1973) written Varieties I,\nII, and III (Sunday, 2008). Banjo's taxonomy, which is the\nmost popular, uses grammatical features and educational lev-\nels to classify NE. Variety I is the lowest, which reflects vul-\ngar errors of grammar and broken structures often used by\nprimary school pupils and those with half-baked formal edu-\ncation. Variety II is an improvement on Variety I. This is the\nvariety that secondary school students and school certificate\nholders use. Variety III is higher standard spoken by highly\neducated Nigerians, graduates, teachers, lecturers, and so on.\nHe proposes this model for NE. Finally, Variety IV is native\nEnglish standard which few Nigerians who were born in\nnative English-speaking countries or have a parent of English\norigin have acquired as their first language or \"half mother\ntongue,\" so to speak (Banjo, 1996). But Variety IV is often\nregarded as too foreign.\nOn the sociolinguistic plane, three levels or lects are often\ndepicted: basilect, mesolect, and acrolect (Igene, 1992;\nOgbulogo, 2005). The educated Variety III of Banjo, which\nis also acrolect on the sociolinguistic pyramid, is often rec-\nommended or preferred as Nigerian standard. Spelling errors\nare regular features of all the varieties and lects, particularly\nthe lower varieties, for errors of spelling are reduced in\nacrolect and the Variety III of Banjo, Odumuh, and\nAdesanoye, which is ENE.\nNE is being nativized in three major perspectives, which\nare creative, contextual/situational, and linguistic. Many cre-\native attempts necessitated by the desire to or exigency of\nconveying new concepts and meanings have produced varia-\ntions which distinguish NE varieties. A few examples are\n\"felabration,\" a creative coinage for the annual celebration of\nFela Anikulapokuti, the legendary Nigerian musician who\ndied in 1997; \"aristo babe\" used to denote a girl who dates\nwealthy older men for money; \"federal character\" and \"zon-\ning,\" which denote government and political party policy of\nsharing national positions and resources equally to all feder-\nating units and rotating leadership among Nigerian geo-\npolitical zones.\nFurthermore, the Nigerian peculiar socio-cultural envi-\nronment has conditioned the use of some English words and\nexpressions in certain ways. Many indigenous Nigerian lan-\nguage words have been borrowed into English, just as some\nEnglish words and phrases are carefully selected and bonded\nto convey Nigerian concepts; for example, \"guguru,\"\n\"akara,\" \"second burial ceremony,\" \"fellow-in-law,\" and so\non, and many other examples annotated in a paper devoted to\nLinguistic nativization is the highest of the three afore-\nmentioned nativization dimensions; for all the features and\ndimensions of nativization are expressed linguistically.\nGenerally, linguistic nativization occurs at all the levels of\nlinguistic organization and also involves the sociolinguistic\nhabit of language transfer and interference. Linguistic\ndomestication equally includes \"intralingual interference\nfeatures\" (Richards, 1984, p. 6) or \"the overgeneralization of\n4 SAGE Open\nlinguistic rules and semantic features\" (Selinker, 1984, p.\nfor example in ENE, the use of \"trickish\" for \"tricky\"; \"cal-\nculative\" for \"calculating,\" \"upliftment\" for \"uplift,\" \"disvir-\ngin\" for \"deflower\" \"convocate\" for \"convoke,\" and so on.\nIn orthography, however, NE has resisted nativization or\nNigerianization. The orthography of NE seems not to brook\nsecond language learner variations, for all cases of difference\nin spelling are treated strictly as errors. Yet, many cases of\nmisspelling abound in NE. The logical question, therefore, is\nwhy are unconscious variations of spelling regarded as errors\nwhile some variations at the other levels are accepted as\nemerging NE. Current efforts at indigenizing English ought\nto be extended to the orthographic level of linguistic organi-\nzation, particularly the spelling system, a preoccupation of\nthis article. Indigenization spelling is another term for spell-\ning reform, an idea or proposal that many linguists support\nand oppose.\nCriticisms of English Spelling\nComplaints about English spelling system have been with us\nsince the Middle English period. \"In 1151, John Hart com-\nplained of the `vices' of English writing, which cause it to be\nFerdinand de Saussure (1966) called the English spelling\nsystem \"an edifice of confusion,\" \"inconsistencies,\" and\nEnglish writing system is conservative and some word spell-\ning archaic and so ingrained that people are reluctant to\nreform them. \"Sounds which existed when our spelling\nbecame habitual, but have since been lost by linguistic\nchange, are still represented in our writing by silent letters, as\nalso stated that \"English spelling is so preposterously unsys-\ntematic that some sort of reform is undoubtedly necessary in\nthe interest of the whole world\" (p. 48). Many years after\nFirth's statement, Jowitt (2008) reechoed his advice by\nobserving that the vocabulary of English \"is vast and con-\nstantly expanding, but its grammar contains many anomalies\nand its spelling is notoriously irregular. Perhaps one day the\ninternational community will insist on its reform.\" (p. 1). In\nthe same vein, Bezrukova (2003) decried English spelling\nthus:\nEnglish spelling is so hopeless at representing phonemes that a\nreform based on virtually any accent would be an improvement\nfor everyone elsewhere. For instance, words like psychology are\npronounced by no one as/psychology/. If we were to spell the\n<ps> as <s> and <ch> as <k>, we could get/sykology/, which is\ncloser to everyone's pronunciation. Then there are words with\n<ph> like photograph where everyone says /f/. (p. 1 )\nYule (1991b) also held this view. In a second language\nsituation, like Nigeria, English spelling system is a serious\nchallenge to writing, reading, teaching, and learning. Some\nstudies have shown how differences in pronunciation and\nspelling wrongly influence each other: Nigerians pronounce\nsome words as spelt and spell them as pronounced. This\nhabit often leads to misspelling and mispronunciation\nSpelling errors that writers often commit are categorized\ninto four types. These are (a) addition of letters, for example,\nharrassment for harassment; (b) deletion of letters such as\nembarasment for embarrassment; (c) replacement or substi-\ntution as in using the affix -ant for -ent, for example, super-\nintendant for superintendent; and (d) reversing the order of\nspelling, for example, feaces for faeces (Crystal, 2005,\np. 213). A fifth type common in ESL is the mixture of the\nfour types; for instance, this one taken from a student script:\nbuorgioesie for bourgeoisie.\nAs there are many inconsistencies in the English spelling\nsystem, which constrain writers to commit the above-\nmentioned categories of misspelling at all levels, many lin-\nguists have made a clarion call for the reform of the English\nspelling system, thereby generating arguments for and against\nthe call. Spelling reform is often suggested in two ways: a\nstandardized, regular use of the existing letters of the alphabet\nand a more radical reform like the one of new and additional\nThe Arguments Against Spelling Reform\nEven though many people agree that spelling reform is desir-\nable, it has been argued that it will cause orthographic confu-\nsion in teaching and learning, discontinuity and conflict\nbetween new and old spellings, and the massive new printing\nof old works to reflect new spellings. It has been argued that\nrigorous and effective teaching and drills in spelling can\neliminate or minimize confusion (Chomsky & Halle, 1968).\nChomsky and Halle (1968) traced failure in spelling to the\nfact that English spelling system is taught as a faulty phone-\nmic representation instead of as a mixed level system (Baker,\nIn addition to these challenges are people's attitude to\nnew concepts and innovations. Many people are so conserva-\ntive that once they are used to a particular way of doing\nthings, they vigorously resist any attempt to introduce a new\nway. This is why people resist or argue against spelling\nreform.\nWhen the art of writing becomes well established in a\ncommunity, not only the spellings of words but even lexical\nand grammatical forms become conventional for written\nrecords. This conservatism, as time goes on, works in another\nway: The conventions of writing remain unaltered even\nthough the speech-forms have undergone linguistic change\nAnother aspect of attitude is lack of unanimity among the\nexponents and prospective beneficiaries of spelling reform.\nThe questions invariably are (a) Whose model should be\nEkundayo 5\nused? (b) which type of reform ought to be carried out, a\nradical one or a regularized type? and (c) which processes\nand procedures should be adopted? Furthermore, attitudes\nresulting from people's accent may lead to the tendency of\ngenerating different spellings to reflect different accents.\nArguments for Spelling Reform\nOn the other side, many socio-educational, economic, and\nsociolinguistic merits are often given to strengthen the argu-\nments for spelling reform. One of them is that spelling reform\nwill make spelling easier for both children and adults.\nReformed and regularized spelling will help slow learners to\nlearn faster. Regularized spellings which eliminate redun-\ndant letters and superfluous sound clusters will certainly\nsave the time of writing both manually and mechanically. By\nextension, the cost of typing, stationery, and logistics will\nalso be drastically reduced. Above all, for the second lan-\nguage users of this study, spelling reform will be of huge\nbenefit to reading, writing, as well as teaching and learning\nreading and spelling.\nThe arguments of discontinuity between old and new\nspellings, which a reformed spelling system will engender,\nconservatism and having to embark on the printing of old\nbooks to reflect new spellings and attitudes are not water-\ntight. Sometimes in life, discontinuity between the old and\nthe new is inevitable. In the case of spelling reform, there\nneed not be discontinuity, as feared by critics, because many\ncases of differences of spelling abound in Middle and\nModern English, which we recognize. They do not truncate\nlearning; for example, in King James Bible English, say, do,\nrun, and so on are spelt as sayeth, doeth, and runneth. We do\nrecognize them as Elizabethan or King James English\nspellings.\nAlso, spending huge resources to reprint old books as a\nresult of reformed spellings would be absolutely unnecessary\nbecause we do not have to reprint old books to reflect new\nspellings. New editions of old books will have to do that. The\ntransition from the old to the new spelling system will auto-\nmatically become part of the knowledge that we transmit to\nthe next generation. Confusion should not arise from this. All\nconsidered, even at present, people learn and use all different\ntypes of spellings: normal spellings with the letters of the\nalphabet, shorthand, technographic (as in computer and spe-\ncial fields) and cryptographic spellings, as in secret intelli-\ngence organizations and cults. In usage, writers are able to\nseparate these various spelling systems. So, a reform of the\nsmall part of confused spellings in English cannot generate\nconfusion or necessitate the reprinting of old books.\nA widely cited figure is that English is about 75% regular. On\nthe other hand, the 400 or so irregular spellings are largely\namong the most frequently used words in the language, and this\npromotes a strong impression of irregularity. (p. 214)\nWell, if the 400 most regularly used English words are\nirregularly spelt, they must logically create a huge picture of\na confused spelling system, which ought to be reformed to\nincrease the percentage of regularity from 75% to 100% or\nOn conservatism, the point must be made that people have\nalways been conservative. Conservatism is part of human\nnature. However, a new concept or innovation that has inher-\nent values for the general good of all and the spirit of learn-\ning must be pursued and realized with greater tenacity. The\nfact that many reform attempts have been made in the past\nwith some results shows that spelling reform is worthwhile\nand portends great hopes for future reform attempts.\nAs for the argument of not teaching orthography as \"a\nmixed level system\" but as \"a faulty phonemic representa-\ntion,\" it should be borne in mind that no amount of effective\nteaching of orthography can erase the obvious mismatch\nbetween phonemic representation and spellings. Indeed, a\nnumber of studies have shown that teaching reading and\nwriting and reading generally by adults and children will be\nments over the last 150 years have shown that English-\nspeaking children could learn to read more easily in reformed\nspelling than in traditional orthography\" (p. 168). Besides,\nYule (1991b) has asked a pertinent question in this regard,\nwhich she has also answered confidently: \"Does the nature\nof English spelling handicap learners of literacy more than\nother writing systems trouble their novices? The obvious\nanswer to me, from observation and experience, is yes.\"\nSome Major Attempted and Suggested Reforms\nFollowing are some spelling reform attempts and sugges-\ntions since the 16th century:\n1569: John Hart wrote Orthographie, a book on English\nspelling.\n1580: The publication of A Book at Large for the\nAmendment of English Orthographie by William\nBullokar.\n1621: Logonomia Anglican on orthography by Dr.\nAlexandra Gill, headmaster of St Paul's School,\nLondon.\n1634: English Grammar by Charles Butler's, containing\nthe examination of syntax and orthography.\nThese individual efforts proposed radical reforms of the\nEnglish spelling system. However, some other works pro-\nposed conservative or mild reform based on the extant\nsystem:\n1662: In the Neoclassical period, James Howell in his\nbook Grammar suggested minor changes, such as\nlogique to logic, warre to war, sinne to sin, toune to\n6 SAGE Open\ntown, and so on; interestingly, some of his suggested\nspellings were adopted and are still being used today.\n1755: The publication of A Dictionary of the English\nLanguage by Samuel Johnson, an epochal intellectual\nwork in the Age of Sensibility and Standardization,\nwhich regularized and preserved the spellings and\nmeanings of English words that are still current.\n1806: Witnessed a major effort by Noah Webster: the\npublication of A Comprehensive Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language, which has an essay on spelling\nreform and rules.\n1828: Another landmark effort by Webster: An American\nDictionary of the English Language with American\nspellings.\n1837: Isaac Pitman's Phonetic Shorthand, which intro-\nduced a new system of symbols and spelling still stud-\nied and used in secretarial courses and writing\nminutes.\n1848:Alexandra John Ellis's A Plea for Phonetic Spelling,\nwhich suggested radical changes and the harmoniza-\ntion of spelling and phonetics.\n1870: The Philological Societies of Great Britain and\nAmerica examined the challenge of the English spell-\ning system.\n1876, August: International Convention for the\nAmendment of English Orthography was held in\nPhiladelphia. Thereafter, America Philological Society\ntook a list of 12 reformed spellings for immediate use:\nare- ar, give- giv, have- hav, live- liv, though- tho,\nthrough- thru.\nCoincidently, this is the way a variety of Nigerian written\ncommunication writes these words, that is, SMS: text\nmessages.\n1884: The publication of the augmented Roman alphabet\n1876: The Spelling Reform Association (SRA) was\nfounded in the United States.\n1906: Simplified Spelling Board (SSB) was constituted in\nthe United States.\nTheodore Roosevelt, the then U.S. president, instructed\nthe \"Government Printing Office\" to start using the reformed\nspellings by SSB. However, the U.S. Congress stopped the\nchanges. Yet, some of the changed spellings survived: anae-\nmia/an\u00e6mia to anemia, mould to mold, catalogue to catalog,\nand so on.\n1908: Simplified Spelling Society (SBB) formed in\nBritain.\n1920: SSB published A Handbook of Simplified Spelling,\ncontaining some spelling reform rules. The Board\nencouraged writers to use the new spellings. But SBB\ncould not stand the test of time.\n1949: The SBB published New Spelling and presented it\nas a bill to the British Parliament. The bill nearly suc-\nceeded: 84 members of Parliament voted for it whereas\n87 voted against it. So, it was rejected.\n1953: The new Spelling Bill was re-presented to the\nBritish Parliament and it scaled through the first read-\ning, but it was again withdrawn as a result of opposi-\ntion from the Ministry of Education (Crystal, 2005, pp.\n1969: Harry Lindgren's proposed Spelling Reform (SR1)\nsucceeded inAustralia. It was adopted by theAustralian\nGovernment and widely used by Australians. The\nreform eliminated redundant letters in some words.\nFriend became frend, health became helth, early\nbecame erly, and so on. However, it was not sustained\nbecause the succeeding government after its adoption\nwas not favorably disposed to Lindgren's SR1.\nety.org/bulletins/aextra1.php).\nThere are many other individuals and institutional\nattempts and proposals on spelling reforms at different times.\nThe few efforts that succeeded, like Harry Lindgren's SR1\nand the American experience, clearly indicate that English\nspellings can be regularized. American spelling reform,\nregularized the spellings of many words and discarded some\nredundant letters and silent sound; for example, <-our> is\nspelt <-or> as in labour for labor, <ph> is spelt <f> as in\nsulfur for sulphur, <-ae-> is spelt <e> as encyclopedia for\nencyclopaedia, silent <-ue> at the end of a word after a con-\nsonant is dropped as in catalog for catalogue, and so on.\nAlso, SMS text message and email variety of written English\nis proving convincingly that spelling can be reformed in\nsome ways.\nNE and Spelling Variations\nThe general consensus among Nigerian linguists at present is\nthat NE does exist and flourish. There are expressions one\nhears everywhere that one goes and at all levels that are\nproudly NE:\nThere is absolutely no doubt that Nigerian English does exhibit\nthe characteristics demanded by Kachru, NE has come of age\nand its recognition as an international variety is a foregone\nconclusion. What is left is a detailed description of its features\nand a clear statements [sic] from norm setters that due recognition\nbe given to it. This will eliminate the self-consciousness that\naccompanies usage that has a distinctive Nigerian flavour.\nIt should be added that the detailed description of its fea-\ntures must include variations of spelling in ENE; for\nEkundayo 7\nexample, many educated Nigerians spell accommodation as\naccomodation or acomodation, pronunciation as pronounci-\nation, embarrassment as embarasment, embarassment, and\nso on. There are many others that can be treated as variations\nof spelling because Nigerians have extenuating sociolinguis-\ntic backdrops for these spellings. Acomodation, for instance,\neliminates redundant letters and saves time. Pronounciation\nreflects the correct spelling of its stem, which is pronounce.\nThe Great Spelling \"Shift\": Who Bells the Spelling\nCat and How?\nThere ought to be a Great Spelling Shift. If the English spell-\ning system is a wild cat that intimidates and confuses chil-\ndren and writers, then we have to bell it. But who bells the\ncat in Nigerian and other Englishes and how? Belling the cat\nthrough spelling reform is not impossible or as difficult as\nsome people think. The challenges in this regard are adamant\nconservatism and the lack of the educational and political\nwill to do it. Once norm setters are determined to pursue it to\nits desired conclusion, it would be achieved. The near suc-\nshould be an impetus and the three procedures for spelling\nreform in the bill could yet be adopted. There were three\nstages in the said bill:\nFirst, reformed spelling system was to be introduced into\nprimary school curriculum and be taught for 5 years, after\nwhich the teaching of old spelling would stop. Second, in the\nfollowing 5 years, new spellings would be introduced man-\ndatorily into the media, films, and public announcement.\nThird, new spellings would be compulsory after 10 years in\npublic documents, literatures, and copy right materials. For\nour purpose, these procedures can be adopted and\nNigerianized for NE in the following ways:\nThe Nigerian Academy of Letters (NAL), Nigeria English\nStudies Association (NESA), Linguistic Association of\nNigeria (LAN), and English Learning and Teaching\nAssociation of Nigeria (ELTAN), among other professional\nbodies, should spearhead the campaign for spelling reform.\nThe campaign and the entire processes should be funded by\nthe Federal Government of Nigeria through the Ministry of\nEducation with which NESA should work as partners for\neducational advancement. Where the Federal Government is\nunwilling, NAL and NESA could undertake the project and\nsource for funding from the Nigerian public and willing indi-\nviduals. The team of scholars on the International Corpus of\nEnglish (ICE) NE Codification Project should make it part of\ntheir terms of reference to look into the nativization or the\nreform of spelling in NE. NESA should sensitize and liaise\nwith other sister professional bodies like the Literary Society\nof Nigeria (LSN), National Association of Teachers and\nResearchers in English as a Second Language (NATRESL),\nNigeriaMedicalAssociation(NMA),NigeriaBarAssociation\n(NBA), Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Nigerian Union\nof Teachers (NUT), among others. Once the criteria, rules,\nand aspects of the reform have been determined, they should\nbe introduced to the curricula of schools at all levels and\nshould be seriously taught and publicized.\nThe print and electronic media, Nigerian \"Home Video,\"\nalso known as Nollywood, should be used to heavily publi-\ncize the new spellings of the words affected; for example,\nnewspaper editorials and headlines should be written in\nreformed spelling. In no time, the reform will sink into the\nminds of NE writers. Luckily enough, the English spelling\nsystem is already reforming itself in the new variety of email\nand cell phone (textese and emailese) where all redundant\nletters and unnecessary repetitions of letters are completely\neliminated without compromising meanings. Spelling reform\ncan draw some examples from Nigerian SMS and email\nvarieties.\nIs Spelling Reform Indeed Necessary?\nThis article shows that educated Nigerians agree that English\nspelling system is confusing and irregular and therefore\nshould be reformed. In addition toAmerican spelling alterna-\ntives, English spelling system should be reformed to elimi-\nnate redundant letters, unnecessary repetition of letters and\nclusters, regularize digraph, and to spell compound words in\none way only.\nAnalysis\nOne thousand questionnaires were administered in the\nUniversity of Benin in 2011. Fifty copies of the question-\nnaire were shared to lecturers in English and Literature,\nLinguistics, Foreign Languages and International Studies,\nand Diplomacy Departments of the University of Benin,\nBenin City, Nigeria. The remainders were administered to\nEnglish and Literature students 100 to 400 levels, University\nreturned their questionnaires admitted that the English spell-\ning system is in part confusing and therefore clearly sug-\ngested spelling reform. They also prefer the American\nspelling system which is simpler than British spelling in\nsome words and proposed that in addition to American spell-\ning, further reform should be embarked on in NE. Following\nare some of the American spellings which respondents\nprefer:\nDeletion of Redundant Consonants and Vowels\nBritish American\n-our: labour, saviour, favour labor, savior, favor\n-ae: faeces, caesarian feces, cesarian\n-ue: catalogue, analogue catalog, analog\n-ise: organize, realize organize, realize\n-ll-: shrivelled, travelling shrivel, travel\n-re: centre, spectre, metre center, specter, meter\n-mme: programme program\n-hy: rhyme rime\n-que: cheque check, etc\n8 SAGE Open\nWith the use of computer and ease of spelling these words,\nmany educated Nigerians now mix-up these American spell-\nings with British spellings, which are taught to them\nregularly.\nElimination of Redundant and Unnecessary\nLetters in English Spelling\nAll letters and combination of letters that are of no morpho-\nlogical and semantic significance should be deleted, as done\nin textese. Any silent letter that is not relevant in distinguish-\ning forms, synonyms, homophones, and showing nuances of\nsimilar forms and derivatives, should be dropped, for exam-\nple, know contains two silent letters, but the silent letters may\nnot be dropped because their presence distinguishes know\nfrom no and now. However, in knowledge, the <w>, <d>\nand the last <e> can be dropped to have knoleg/knolej, which\nis easier to spell. The last <e> in complete and rage are silent\nand so could be dropped. But a critical look will discover that\nthe <e> of rage performs an orthographic function because if\nthe <e> is dropped, rage will become rag. The same thing\ncannot be said of the last <e> in complete, which can be done\naway with. Other examples are given below:\nIf the deletion of a seemingly redundant letter or group of\nletters make the resultant word appear like another, thereby\ncreating confusion, then the letters should be retained; for\nexample, deleting the redundant -r- in these words will create\nconfusion: art, dart, tar, cart. Similarly, the underlined silent\nletters in the following words are functional, as they distin-\nguish them from close homophones: whole, where, whose,\nwrite, sow, knight, lamb, and so on.\nUnnecessary Repetition of Letters\nRepetition of letters and consonant clusters also make\nEnglish spelling confusing. Therefore, all repetitions and\nclusters that are not affixes but mere repetitions just for the\nsake of spelling should be deleted. Care should be taken to\ndifferentiate between functional repetition and useless repe-\ntition. For example, unnecessary and tunnel have double\n<n>, respectively. While the double <nn> in unnecessary is\nas a result of the addition of the prefix un- to necessary, and\nso functional, the <nn> in tunnel is mere repetition.Therefore,\none can be dropped to have tunel. Following are more\nexamples:\nRedundant letters Current\nspelling\nProposed spelling\n-a- Michael Maikel\n caesarian section cesarian section\n head hed\n-b- debt det\n subtle sutle/sutil\n plumber, etc. plumer\n thumb thum\n-c- muscles musles\n scissors sisors\n-d- Wednesday Wensday\n-e- deplete deplet\n replete replete\n move mov\n-g- foreign forein\n sovereign sovrein\n gnash nash\n campaign campain\n champagne champane\n-h- ghost gost\n ghoulish gulish\n-gh/ou- through thru\n thorough thoro\n neighbour, etc. neibor\nie/ei believe beliv\n forfeit forfit\n receipt recit\n-k- knickers nickers\n Knock nok\n kneel, etc. neel\n-n- solemn solem\n condemn condem\n contemn contem\n-o- could cud/kud\n should shud\n would wud\n-p- psychology sykology/saikologi\n Psalm salm\n-ue- colleague koleeg\n harangue harang\n-w- whore hore\n whooping wooping\n borrow boro\n tomorrow tomoro\nRepetition Current\nspelling\nProposed spelling\n-bb- bubble buble\n-cc- accumulate acumulate\n accommodate acomodate\n accuse acuse\n-dd- cuddle cudle\n address adres\n-ff- ruffle rufle\n-gg- struggle strugle\n-ll- parallel paralel\n millennium milenium\n-mm- mommy momy\n tummy tumy\n accommodate acomodate\n-nn- funny funy\n beginning begining\noea/oeia plateau platou\nEkundayo 9\nRepeated vowels are not as problematic as consonant\nclusters. That is why they are not well represented here\nbecause double vowels can be pronounced as one long vowel\nor diphthong, for example, food, soup, soap, but double con-\nsonants have only a short pronunciation.\nRegularization of Monograph and Digraph\nA digraph is a combination of two or more different letters\npronounced as one phoneme. In spelling, a digraph comes as\ntwo or more letters combined, but in transcription, the two\nletters are represented by a phonetic symbol and pronounced\nas a phoneme; for example, <ph> and <ch>, which are pro-\nnounced as /f/, /k/, /t/ or //, respectively. Digraph can be\nregularized to simplify spelling:\nFinally, in this subsection, there are monographs and a par-\ntial vowel which create problems for educated Nigerians.\nThese are letter <x> and the partial vowel /j/. Letter <x> is\noften realized in two phonemes during articulation, and the\npartial vowel /j/ is often absent in spelling. These two are of a\nkind because the former <x> has a phoneme absent in spelling\nbut present in pronunciation and the latter /j/ too is sometimes\nabsent in spelling but there in pronunciation. Nigerians do take\nthe -x- for a phoneme and articulate it accordingly and where\n/j/ should be pronounced, it is usually not pronounced because\nof its absence in spelling. Therefore, the monograph <x>\nshould be regularized to the two letters it represents during\nspelling so that readers are in no doubt about its correct pro-\nnunciation. The implication is that the letter <x>, apart from\njust appearing in spelling and in the alphabet, is basically use-\nless for articulation for most educated Nigerians:\nSimilarly, the phoneme /j/ should be represented in the\nspelling of words in NE. The letter <i> or <y> can be used to\nreflect it, depending on how it can blend well\nmorpho-phonemically:\nNow, we look at complication in the spelling of com-\npound and reduplicated words.\nCompound Word Spelling\nA compound word is a combination of two base forms or two\nwords functioning as one entity with a meaning. Although\nwe have two or more words in a compound formation, the\ntwo words together denote one thing, idea or concept.\nReduplication is the repetition of similar sound and spelling\nbut not different bases; for example, hocus-pocus, hanky-\npanky. There are three ways of writing compound words,\nwhich create confusion for writers: combined or solid form\n(as in breakfast), separated or open form (e.g., cassava\nflower), and hyphenated form (e.g., brother-in-law). Because\ncompound words and their origins are very many, writers do\nnot often know during writing which is which. So, the three\nrules of writing them are generally mixed up.\n bureau buro\n bourgeoisie bujwazi\n bougainvillaea bugainvilea\n diarrhoea diaria/diorea\n connoisseur conosur\n onomatopoeia onomatopia\n-pp- pepper peper\n handicapped handicaped\n-rr- referred refered\n embarrass embaras\n tomorrow tomoro\n catarrh cata\n-ss- harass haras\n blossom blosom\n assembly asembly\n-tt- rattle ratle\n battle batle\n settlement setlement\n-zz- dazzle dazle\nDigraph Current spelling Proposed spelling\n-ch- All <ch> digraph pronounced as /k/ should be\nregularized to letter <k>\n Christ Krist\n Chemistry Kemistry\n-ck- shackles shakles\n tackle takle\n attack atak\n-gh- cough cof/kof\n tough tof\n rough rof\n-ph- shepherd sheferd\n loophole loofol\n phosphorous fosforos\n morpho-phonemics morfo-fonemics\nsch- scheme sceme/skeem\n schedule shedul/skedul\n festschrift feshrift\n Schweppes Shweps\n-x- example egzample\n exaggerate egzagerate\n excel eksel\n excuse eskiuz\n/j/ union yunion\n student stiudent\n university yuniversity\n duty diuty\n eulogy yulogy\n impugn impiun\nTable 1.

SBE = Standard British English; ENE = Educated Nigerian English.\nTable 1. (continued)\nIn a questionnaire administered to 25,000 educated\nNigerians who were mainly lecturers and final year students\nin English and Literature, Linguistics, and International\nStudies and Diplomacy, Mass Communication and Theatre\nArts Department, all the responses collated and analyzed\n(10,000 in all) admitted misspelling some words and mixing\nup the 3 ways in which compound words are spelt.\nFurthermore, the 22 compound words dictated for them to\nspell were spelt indiscriminately in any of the three above-\ngiven ways. Table 1 (S/No. 1) shows how the 22 compound\nwords dictated were spelt. (A) is SBE.\nThe table shows a clear preference for the combined and\nhyphenated compound words in ENE.Asked to state how best\nthey think compound words should be written to avoid confu-\nsion, the respondents suggested one-way rule only. Five thou-\nsand eight hundred (58%) suggested the hyphenated type,\nsidered, it makes no difference to meaning and it scarcely\naffects pronunciation if a compound word is written in any of\nthe three forms. Quirk, Greebaum, Leech, and Svatvik (1985)\nhave also acknowledged the inconsistencies that characterize\nwriting compound words. At times, a compound formation is\nacceptably written in the three ways possible; for example, \"a\nflower pot, a flower-pot, a flowerpot.\" Furthermore, they\nobserve that hyphenation is more common in BrE than in\nAmE, that in AmE, compound words tend to be written more\nin combined form (Greebaum, Leech, and Svatvik, 1985, p.\n1569). The implication is that the writing of compound words\nlacks consistency and uniformity in the two most popular\nEnglish models of the world. Therefore, the suggestion of our\nrespondents presented below should be adopted. Either A or B\n(as shown below) can be adopted for writing all compound\nwords in all contexts, instead of the three ways in which they\ncan occur, which confuse even the most conscious of writers:\nConclusion\nThis article deals with the perennial challenge of the\nconfusing English spelling system and the necessity of\nspelling reform. It was found that even the most versatile\nand seemingly perfect of scholars do misspell words or\nget confused about the correct spelling of a word when\nwriting. They inevitably consult a dictionary, if it is\navailable, or use a synonym, or ignorantly misspell the\nword. All considered, misspelling does not alter meaning\nbut only shows that the writer does not know the correct\nspelling of the word. Although this is the case, variations\nof spelling are regarded by educated Nigerians as clear\nerrors that must be penalized and discouraged. Despite\nconcerted efforts to SBE-fy spellings in NE, educated\nNigerians who keep misspelling some words agree that\nspelling reform is expedient. To this end, different sug-\ngested spellings have been made here. Reform should\nformulate rules for deleting redundant letters, unneces-\nsary sound clusters, regularizing digraph, and spelling\ncompound words in one way only, as illustrated in this\narticle. The kind of reform proposed here will enhance\nspelling skills and accuracy, reading, and writing, and\nwill relate written English very closely with\npronunciation.\nBrotherinlaw or brother-in-law\nCommanderinchief or commander-in-chief\nCassavaflower or cassava-flower\nStonehearted or stone-hearted\nSergeantatarm or sergeant-at-arm\nHeadofstate or head-of-state\nAppendix\nDepartment of English and Literature\nFaculty of Arts\nUniversity of Benin\nBenin City, Edo State\nQuestionnaire on a Research on English Spelling System and the Need for Reform in Educated Nigerian\nEnglish (ENE)\nDear respondent,\nI would like you to try and imagine that you have been employed as an arbitrator for a government-sponsored committee for\nthe reform of English spellings.
