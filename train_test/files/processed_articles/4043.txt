    "abstract": "Abstract\nDuring the last 30 years, significant debate has taken place regarding multilevel research. However, the extent to which\nmultilevel research is overtly practiced remains to be examined. This article analyzes 10 years of organizational research\nwithin a multilevel framework (from 2001 to 2011). The goals of this article are (a) to understand what has been done,\nduring this decade, in the field of organizational multilevel research and (b) to suggest new arenas of research for the next\ndecade. A total of 132 articles were selected for analysis through ISI Web of Knowledge. Through a broad-based literature\nreview, results suggest that there is equilibrium between the amount of empirical and conceptual papers regarding multilevel\nresearch, with most studies addressing the cross-level dynamics between teams and individuals. In addition, this study also\nfound that the time still has little presence in organizational multilevel research. Implications, limitations, and future directions\nare addressed in the end.\n",

That is, between\nlayers (such as divisions, departments, teams, and individu-\nals) there is often some degree of interdependence that leads\nto bottom-up and top-down influence mechanisms. Teams\nand organizations are contexts for the development of indi-\nvidual cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors (top-down effects;\nKozlowski & Klein, 2000). Conversely, individual cogni-\ntions, attitudes, and behaviors can also influence the func-\ntioning and outcomes of teams and organizations (bottom-up\neffects; Arrow, McGrath, & Berdahl, 2000). One example is\nwhen the rewards system of one organization may influence\nemployees' intention to quit and the existence or absence of\nextra role behaviors. At the same time, many studies have\nshowed the importance of bottom-up emergent processes\nthat yield higher level phenomena (Bashshur, Hern\u00e1ndez, &\nQuinteiro, Curral, Passos, & Lewis, in press). For example,\nthe affectivity of individual employees may influence their\nteam's interactions and outcomes (Costa, Passos, & Bakker,\n2012). Several authors agree that organizations must be\nunderstood as multilevel systems, meaning that adopting a\nmultilevel perspective is fundamental to understand real-\nworld phenomena (Kozlowski & Klein, 2000). However,\nwhether this agreement is reflected in practicing multilevel\nresearch seems to be less clear. In fact, how much is known\nabout the quantity and quality of multilevel research done in\nthe last decade? The aim of this study is to compare what has\nbeen proposed theoretically, concerning the importance of\nmultilevel research, with what has really been empirically\nstudied and published. First, this article outlines a review of\nthe multilevel theory, followed by what has been theoreti-\ncally \"put forward\" by researchers. Second, this article pres-\nents what has really been \"practiced\" based on the results of\nin business and management journals. Finally, some barriers\nand challenges to true multilevel research are suggested.\nThis study contributes to multilevel research as it describes\nthe last 10 years of research. It quantitatively depicts the type\nof articles being written, and where we can find the majority\nof the publications on empirical and conceptual work related\nto multilevel thinking.\n1Instituto Universit\u00e1rio de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), Lisboa, Portugal\nCorresponding Author:\nPatr\u00edcia Lopes Costa, Instituto Universit\u00e1rio de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), Av.\ndas For\u00e7as Armadas, Edif\u00edcio ISCTE, CIS-IUL, 1649-026 Lisboa, Portugal.\nEmail: patricia_costa@iscte.pt\nMultilevel Research in the Field of\nOrganizational Behavior: An Empirical\nLook at 10 Years of Theory and Research\nPatr\u00edcia Lopes Costa1, Ana Margarida Gra\u00e7a1,\nPedro Marques-Quinteiro1, Catarina Marques Santos1,\nAnt\u00f3nio Caetano1, and Ana Margarida Passos1\n Keywords\nmultilevel, cross-level, organizational systems, business, management, social sciences\n2 SAGE Open\nMultilevel Research: Aligned Theory,\nMeasurement, and Analysis\nthree fundamental aspects to multilevel research that must be\naligned, to avoid level-related confusions or errors: the level\nof theory, the level of measurement, and the level of\nanalysis.\nLevel of theory refers to the focal level: the entity about\nwhich the researcher draws conclusions (individuals, sub-\nunits, firms, etc.) and to which generalizations they are\ndesigned to apply. Although it apparently seems easy, estab-\nlishing the boundaries dividing one entity from another\n(what defines a team, when its members belong to more than\none team, for example), and defining when one moves from\none level of analysis to another (from teams to organiza-\ntions, as an example) must be done quite carefully. The same\nconsiderations should be applied when examining mixed\nteams, or individuals who belong to different projects in dis-\ntinct organizations, as it makes it difficult to understand\ntheir membership and their contribution to higher levels.\nAnother important aspect at this level is to actually explicit\nthe multilevel theory, which means to outline how phenom-\nena at different levels are linked. These links may be top-\ndown or bottom-up. Top-down mechanisms express the\ninfluence of higher level contextual factors on lower levels\nof the organization. For example, the culture of an organiza-\ntion influences the more or less formal patterns of interaction\nbetween individuals. Bottom-up mechanisms explain how\nlower level dynamics shape the emergence of higher level\nphenomena, which are unique, and cannot be reduced to their\nlower level elements (Dansereau, Alutto, & Yammerino,\n1984). In fact, there are team processes that necessarily\nimply the interaction and coordination between team mem-\nbers and cannot be reduced to their individual perceptions.\nOne example is team reflexivity, which has demonstrated to\nyield team effectiveness (Gra\u00e7a & Passos, 2012; Schippers,\nDen Hartog, Koopman, & Van Knippenberg, 2008).\nConceptually, these two mechanisms are both equally impor-\ntant. However, empirical research has focused more on\ndownward (contextual) processes rather than upward (emer-\ngent) processes, suggesting that the larger context is more\nlikely to influence lower level variables than the opposite.\nNonetheless, some researchers have highlighted the impor-\ntance of upward influences and claimed that empirical stud-\nies should also emphasize them (Chen, Kanfer, DeShon,\nMathieu, & Kozlowski, 2009; Morgeson & Hofmann,\n1999). This trend finds support in other research areas such\nas social networks and complex adaptive systems because\nthese offer methodological tools to observe and analyze\nbottom-up effects in social structures. One example is a\nrecent study on the dynamics of financial stability showing\nthat market crashes can only be avoided when banks accept\nthe loss of gains and behave in a resilient way. That is to say\nthat when banks decide to lower their risk, the financial\nnetwork will grow and the probability of a financial crisis\nThe level of measurement refers to the entities from\nwhich data are drawn and should reflect the theory level.\nThe level of theory and the level of measurement should\ntherefore be aligned to avoid possible misunderstandings\nand erroneous conclusions. When studying organizational\nclimate, one must gather data at the organizational level\nwhereas addressing individual-level motivation, research-\ners should gather data from individuals. In an area of\nresearch where individuals are often the main sources of\ninformation, researchers must justify why the process\nof data collection used is suitable for their particular\nresearch purposes. When the level of measurement is lower\nthan the level of analysis, it is crucial to have a good justi-\nfication for aggregating the data preceded by a theoretical\nrationale that explains how the higher level phenomenon\ncomes into existence. Chan (1998) proposed a typology of\ncomposition models (see Table 1) that may guide research-\ners when working on theory building, data gathering, and\nthe measurement instruments used. This typology, like\nothers (Chen, Mathieu, & Bliese, 2004, for example),\nrequires that researchers \"have a theory about how data\ncollected at one level of analysis should be combined to\nrepresent constructs at a higher level of analysis\" (Mathieu\ndescribe how lower level data may be aggregated to repre-\nsent higher level phenomena or constructs.\nAdding to Chan's (1998) composition models, Kozlowski\nand Klein (2000) suggested another form of emergence,\nwhich they named \"compilation models.\" On one hand,\ncomposition models reflect an equal contribution of each\nlower level entity to the higher level. For example, an orga-\nnization's service climate is theoretically a reflection of the\nmembers of the organizations' shared perceptions of the\nextent to which organizational policies reward and encour-\nage customer service (Schneider & Bowen, 1985). On the\nother hand, compilation models suggest that higher level\nphenomena may be more complex combinations of lower\nlevel contributions. Team performance, for example, is a\ncomplex function of specific individual contributions that\nare not the same from individual to individual: Some indi-\nviduals may contribute more to team performance than oth-\ners.Although this form of emergence (compilation) underlies\nmany concepts, it is not widely recognized by researchers\nFinally, theory and measurement levels should also be\naligned with the level of analysis, that is, the level at which\ndata are analyzed to test hypotheses. Statistically, several\nmeasures have been created to assess within-group agree-\nment and justify data aggregation to the higher level, such\nas the within-group agreement index (R\nwg(j)\n; James,\ncoefficient (ICC; Bliese, 2000), and the average dispersion\nindex (ADI; Burke & Dunlap, 2002). However, the level of\nLopes Costa et al. 3\nanalysis goes beyond aggregation issues. In the 1980s, sev-\neral techniques and methods for analyzing multilevel data\nemerged, such asANCOVA(Mossholder & Bedeian, 1983);\ncontextual analysis (Firebaugh, 1979); WABA (Within and\nBetween Analysis; Dansereau et al., 1984); CLOP (cross-\nlevel operator; James, Demaree, & Hater, 1980); random-\ncoefficient modeling (RCM) with HLM (hierarchical linear\nmodeling; Burstein, Linn, & Capell, 1978); and there have\nbeen other more recent advances, such as the development\nof the Nonlinear and Linear Mixed Effects program for\nS-PLUS and R programs (Pinheiro & Bates, 2000).\nMoreover, Albright and Marinova (2010) have recently\npresented a brief review on how to estimate multilevel\nmodels using SPSS, Stata, SAS, and R, thus making impor-\ntant contributions to the advances of multilevel research.\nMplus has also proved to be a valuable tool for analyzing\nmultilevel data (Muth\u00e9n & Asparouhov, 2011), especially\nfor longitudinal designs. According to Kozlowski and Klein\n(2000), there is no single \"best\" technique. Researchers\nshould base their choices on the \"consistency between the\ntype of constructs, the sampling and the data, and the\nresearch question; and on the assumptions, strengths, and\nlimitations of the analytic technique\" (Kozlowski & Klein,\nmultilevel, as well as interesting developments in the statis-\ntical procedures and software available. Nonetheless, how\ndo researchers integrate these developments in their\nresearch? How are multilevel theory and practice reflected\nin recent peer-reviewed publications?\nMultilevel Thinking in Theory and Research\nMultilevel research has long caught researchers' attention, at\nleast in a theoretical sense. Recently, Rousseau (2011) sum-\nmarized some developments that have occurred for micro-\nand macrobridging, and highlighted that multilevel research\nis being (successfully) done. Rousseau structured her argu-\nmentation by presenting some evidence. First, the existence\nof an organizational mode of thinking, introduced as a natu-\nral feature of organizational researchers and as a distinctive\ncompetence of organizational science. Due to its inherent\ninterdisciplinary aspects (e.g., psychology, sociology, and\neconomics), organizational science fosters a multilevel per-\nspective. Other evidence is the use of multilevel or cross-\nlevel heuristics by researchers, like the rule of thumb of\nalways considering one level up and one level below the\nfocal construct the researcher is studying, and partitioning\nvariance. Third, the development of multilevel concepts, like\n\"emergence\" or \"embeddedness,\" guides researchers in their\nmultilevel theory and research. Also, the use of cross-level\ninterventions is another evidence that proves that multilevel\nthinking is \"inherent in the working lives of many organiza-\ntional scientists\" (Rousseau, 2011, p. 1). In a study by Hitt,\nBeamish, Jackson, and Mathieu (2007), the multilevel per-\nspective was identified in approximately 25% of the articles\npublished in the Academy of Management Journal and in\n50% in the case of the Academy of Management Review, in a\n12-month period. Thus, it appears that multilevel research is\nbeing done and developed.\nTable 1.

This is preceded\nby a dispersion composition. The process technique consists in finding\nthe right parameters to pass to higher levels, yet there is no empirical\nalgorithm to do this.\n4 SAGE Open\nIn addition to Rousseau's contribution, we would like to\nemphasize that there is further proof that shows the rele-\nvance and interest concerning multilevel thinking. Many\nresearchers are conscious of the importance and practical\nappliance of multilevel thinking. The sharing that stems\nfrom multidisciplinary teams embedded in research depart-\nments and the discussion of knowledge that each team\nmember can offer about distinctive and specific areas of\nexpertise may lead to an effective multilevel thinking and\nto an integrative organizational science. In addition,\nincreasingly more people combine different areas in their\ncurricula. For instance, they have a degree in a specific area\n(e.g., psychology), and do their PhD and their research or\nwork in another area (e.g., management). Thus, these peo-\nple are likely to have more knowledge and broader skills to\nthink, to analyze, and to understand organizational phe-\nnomena at different levels and from different perspectives.\nMoreover, in spite of acting and promoting change in only\none area, they have the skills needed to act and promote\nchange in different ones. More evidence of multilevel\nthinking and research is the development of multilevel\nresearch methods and statistical procedures, such as the\nones mentioned above. These developments have led many\nuniversities to provide summer schools dedicated to multi-\nlevel statistical procedures. This shows that universities\nhave made the more advanced organizational research\nmethods available to students to allow them to develop\ntheir ability to analyze and to make interventions within a\nhierarchical system of organizations, groups, and individu-\nals (for instance, Multilevel Modeling with R for Beginners\nat INGRoup Conference, 2012). What is more, several\nbooks on the importance and practice of multilevel have\nbeen published in the last decade (Klein & Kozlowski,\n2000, for a reference). There are also articles and journal\nissues specifically dedicated to multilevel (Journal of\nManagement--Special issue: Bridging micro and macrodo-\nmains, as an example). These publications discuss the\nrecent advances in multilevel theory and research, and rep-\nresent the effort of the experts (on management, human\nresources, social capital, workplace demography, etc.) to\ncomprehend multilevel issues. Ultimately, their work\nencourages and stimulates researchers to make their contri-\nbutions, thus multilevel progresses more and more.\nFinally, the theoretical and methodological advances that\nhave been mentioned so far allow us to say that the current\nreflections about research contexts (i.e., micro, macro), and\nchange (i.e., time), as key variables to understand a whole\nsystem, express researchers' concern to embrace this\napproach. This means that because time is present in all con-\ntexts--for some authors time is a component or a dimension\nthe functioning of teams and organizations is dynamic, it is\nessential to consider time to understand the micro and mac-\nrocontexts. Even with all the considerations and advances\nconcerning multilevel thinking, Kozlowski and Klein (2000),\nassumed that the influence of multilevel was \"merely meta-\nphorical\" (p. 1). After 12 years, multilevel is widely known\nand valued by organizational researchers, but can we say that\nit is no longer a metaphor? Are the core problems of organi-\nzational dynamics really explained according to the multi-\nlevel research as has been done? To what extent did multilevel\nresearch add something to the understanding of these prob-\nlems? Moreover, to what extent did multilevel research\nchanged the management practices in organizations? At last,\nis there any further potential for developing multilevel think-\ning in research and practice?\nSome Barriers to Multilevel Thinking\nOne of the foundations of multilevel thinking was the idea\nthat micro phenomena are embedded in macrocontexts and\nthat macrophenomena can emerge due to the interaction and\ndynamics of lower level elements (Kozlowski & Klein,\n2000). Yet, organizational researchers are likely to highlight\neither a micro- or a macroperspective. Although an organi-\nzation is an integrative system, organizational science has\nbeen having difficulties in integrating theories that explain\nphenomena at the individual and group level of analysis\n(e.g., goal-setting theory) with theories that explain phe-\nnomena at the organizational level of analysis (such as the\nresource-based view of the firm). Roberts, Hulin, and\nRousseau (1978), referred to the need for an integrative\neffort of different disciplines in organizational science. The\nmultilevel paradigm was born when a meso approach high-\nlighted the fact that any phenomenon of interest was influ-\nenced by factors situated above and below that phenomenon.\nNowadays, researchers are still trying to make an effort to\nbridge the micro-macro divide, as shown in some special\nissues of the Academy of Management Journal (Hitt et al.,\n2007), the Journal of Organizational Behavior (Griffin,\n2007), and the Journal of Management (Aguinis, Boyd,\nPierce, & Short, 2011). One of the reasons for multilevel\nthinking and research not being developed in organizational\nscience may be due to this micro-/macrobridging that is still\na challenge to researchers (Rousseau, 2011). First, it is a\ncognitive challenge as people need to reflect on a large\namount of information when considering complex phenom-\nena. It is also a social dilemma, because people wonder why\nthey should invest their effort in studying complex models\nof multilevel research instead of focusing on specific topics\nthat they can develop in depth. Finally, multilevel research\nmay be a political process when some levels are viewed as\nmore important than others. However, in accordance with\nMolloy, Ployhart, and Wright (2011), there is not just one\ndivide between micro- and macroresearch, but there are\nindeed two different divides. The authors define \"divide\" as\na conceptual and methodological separation in the literature\nwithin specific areas. These separations reflect a different\nfocus on the vast economic and social systems where indi-\nviduals and organizations are embedded. The first divide\nLopes Costa et al. 5\nidentified by Molloy et al. (2011) is called a \"system level\ndivide.\" Within organizational science, researchers from\ndifferent subdomains (organizational behavior, strategy,\nentrepreneurship, human resources management, to name a\nfew) have historically focused their attention differently on\none of three system levels: individuals and groups, organi-\nzations, and economic and social systems. As a conse-\nquence, depending on the level of the system that researchers\nare paying attention to, the operationalization of the micro-\nand macroconcepts themselves is different. For example,\nwithin the subdomain of the management of human\nresources, macrolevel refers to organizations, broadly\ndefined, and micro levels refer to individuals, dyads, or\ngroups. In the subdomain of strategy, however, micro refers\nto firms and corporations, whereas macro means industries,\nregional clusters, strategic groups, and so on. This makes it\nvery difficult to merge or to bridge the different areas of\nmultilevel literature and is related to the problem of defining\nthe focal unit, as mentioned before: If the bridge were based\non micro-/macrooperationalization, individuals and organi-\nzations would be put in the same basket.\nThe second divide is called \"disciplinary divide.\" Molloy\net al. (2011) defined the \"trinity\" of disciplines within orga-\nnizational research: economics, sociology, and psychology.\nEach discipline has its own theoretical approaches (how\nphenomena are viewed and conceptualized), specific meth-\nodologies (how phenomena are examined and measured),\nand particular assumptions. Indeed, there is not a shared\nepistemology within organizational science, and this leads\nto differences in the way important phenomena are viewed,\nconceptualized, examined, and measured. Even when the\nmethodological procedures are similar, researchers from\ndifferent domains use different symbols. Thus, this differ-\nence creates a communicative boundary between micro- and\nmacroresearchers that leads to confusion and misinterpreta-\ntion (Aguinis et al., 2011). For example, the concept of\nhuman capital in psychology is linked to individual differ-\nences in cognitive ability and to diverse psychological pro-\ncesses such as learning. For an economist, it is mostly an\ninvestment decision and for a sociologist it has to do with\nsomeone's career history and structural prominence of prior\nemployees. For Aguinis et al. (2011), the specialization\ndomains of researchers enhance these divides: Some are\nmicro, such as organizational behavior and management of\nhuman resources, while others are macro, such as business\npolicy and strategy, and organization and management\ntheory.\nJournals may also be divided by micro (e.g., Journal of\nApplied Psychology) and macro (e.g., Strategic Management\nJournal) levels. This division is reflected in the articles'\ncharacteristics, such as their length, acceptance rates, and the\nnumber of coauthors per article. Hitt et al. (2007) showed\nthat despite some journals publishing micro- and macrostud-\nies, the integration of these perspectives is a challenge that\nneeds to be met for a greater acceptance of the concept of\n\"multilevel.\" Moreover, different researchers perceive the\nsame journal as contrary to their position. Microresearchers\nperceive a journal as a macrojournal while macroresearchers\nperceive the same journal as a microjournal (Aguinis et al.,\n2011).Also, the membership of the Academy of Management\ndistinguishes members between micro- and macroclusters.\nAs a consequence, few members belong to micro- and mac-\nrojournals simultaneously (Aguinis et al., 2011). Considering\nthe evidence for the flourishing of multilevel thinking and its\nobservable obstacles, is \"multilevel\" just a keyword that is in\nfashion or does it really reflect multilevel thinking, theoriz-\ning, measuring, and analyzing?\nTo illustrate \"what is really practiced\" in the domain of mul-\ntilevel research, we conducted a literature review to analyze\nwhether researchers are really doing multilevel research and\nwhether empirical studies or theoretical proposals are, in fact,\nmultilevel--or whether they only intend to be multilevel.\nMethod\nSample and Procedure for Data Analysis\nThe literature review we performed was broad-based, but not\na systematic one (we excluded proceedings and unpublished\nworks and we analyzed the abstracts). We conducted the\nsearch on the \"ISI Web of Knowledge\" dataset, restricted the\nsearch to the \"Business\" and \"Management\" web of science\ncategories, and limited the search to a 10-year period: from\n\"title.\" With these criteria we obtained 141 articles. After\nreading the abstracts of all articles, nine articles were\nexcluded because they were not related to multilevel defini-\ntion (two examples are Frykfors & Jonsson, 2010 and Xiao,\narticles to analyze. Each article was classified based on its\nabstract. In a first step, the abstracts were equally divided\namong the raters and were classified individually. The\nabstracts were then subjected to a second blind analysis to\ncheck whether there was agreement on the classification.\nWhen there was no agreement among the raters, the abstracts\nwere read and discussed in team meetings until all the authors\nreached an agreement.\nFirst, articles were classified as conceptual or empirical.\nWithin conceptual papers, each article could be classified as\n\"theoretical\" (a new model and/or propositions about spe-\ncific topics), or as \"research methods\" (methodological\ndevelopments, discussions about current and new methodol-\nogies, and their application in specific settings). Empirical\npapers were classified either as \"single-level,\" \"cross-level,\"\nor \"homologous multilevel,\" according to Kozlowski and\nKlein's (2000) proposal.1 We added a new possibility of clas-\nsification a posteriori that emerged from the data analysis:\nWhen the researchers considered time as a level of analysis,\nwe classified those empirical research articles as \"time\" (see\n6 SAGE Open\nResults\nThe results show that 43% of the abstracts correspond to\nempirical cross-level studies (see Figure 1). A relevant per-\ncentage of abstracts correspond to conceptual papers (40%):\ntheoretical articles (23%) or conceptual research methods\n(17%) about multilevel. Only 4% correspond to a homolo-\ngous multilevel model.\nLevels of Analysis\nTo deepen our understanding about what is really practiced by\nresearchers, we performed another analysis: We enumerated\nwhich levels of analysis (individual, team, organizational, and\nindustrial) were included in the empirical studies. Regarding\nthe empirical single-level articles (n = 15), the majority (67%)\nwere studies that analyzed the individual level, and 13% con-\nsidered the team level; the remaining 20% analyzed other lev-\nels. In homologous multilevel studies (n = 5), we found that\nthree studies included all levels: individual, team, and organi-\nzational levels. One focused on Multilevel Confirmatory\nFactor Analysis, studying individual and team levels and the\nother one analyzed individual and organizational levels. All\nstudies that addressed time (n = 2) examined the individual\nlevel. Within the empirical cross-level articles (n = 57), the\nmajority (47%) were studies that analyzed individual and team\nlevels. A percentage of 19% studied individual and organiza-\ntional levels and 7% referred to variables at team and organi-\nzational levels. In a lower quantity, organizational and country\nlevels were studied in 5% of the papers and 3% focused on\norganizational and industrial levels.\nJournals, Citations, and Years\nWe also considered the journals in which articles were pub-\nlished, the number of times cited on the Web of Science, and\nthe year of publication. Sixteen articles were published in\nOrganizational Research Methods (Impact Factor\n=\n4.295), as well as in Small Group Research (IF\nSeveral journals only published one article between 2001\nand 2011 (e.g., Human Relations, Human Resource\nManagement Review, Journal of Business and Psychology).\nA closer look at the results clarifies what is happening in\nmultilevel research. Figure 2 depicts the Journals with the\nmost \"multilevel\" articles and the types of articles published,\naccording to our classification.\nConsidering the journals with the highest number of publi-\ncations (n = 69), 33 were conceptual articles (16 theoretical\nand 17 on research methods). Only four reflected homolo-\ngous multilevel empirical research (with one being a\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis), with the majority (27) pre-\nsenting cross-level studies. Finally, five articles had single-\nlevel empirical analysis, despite the word \"multilevel\" in the\ntitle. The 132 \"multilevel\" articles were cited, on average, 19\ntimes (SD = 28.90); however, 17 articles have not been cited\nyet. Five articles (Aguilera, Rupp, Williams, & Ganapathi,\ntimes. These five most cited articles were published in jour-\nnals that are in the \"top 3\" of the management ranking (on\nthe Web of Science): Academy of Management Review, the\nfirst one in the ranking (IF\n2007), the Academy of Management Journal, the second\nTaggar, 2002), and the Mis Quarterly, the third in the\nTable 2.

Within the most cited \"multilevel\" articles, two\nhad a conceptual nature and the remaining three presented\ncross-level empirical research. None reflected empirical\nresearch using a homologous multilevel model. The two most\ncited \"cross-level\" articles were, indeed, cross-level studies.\nIn 2001, the year Kozlowski and Klein's book was pub-\nlished, three \"multilevel\" articles appeared on the Web of\nwas the most productive year for \"multilevel\" as 30 articles\nwere published (see Figure 3).\nDiscussion\nMultilevel research seems to be equally preached and prac-\nticed. Indeed, there are almost as many conceptual papers\n(i.e., theoretical and research methods) as empirical cross-\nlevel ones, reflecting the large number of theoretical propos-\nals that are \"preached.\" Researchers believe it is important to\ndevelop multilevel research, and tend to theorize about it.\nEmpirically, researchers mainly conduct investigations that\nanalyze the relationship between variables at different levels\nof analysis--cross-level models--and mainly study top-\ndown influences between teams and individuals. Research\nusing homologous multilevel models is scarce. Finally, the\nleast practiced multilevel methodologies seem to be consid-\nering time as a variable and multilevel confirmatory factor\nanalysis. Authors might choose other techniques rather than\nmultilevel modeling to access changes over time (e.g.,\ngrowth modeling, repeated measures).\nBiology suggests that facultative mutualism between spe-\ncies occurs when two individuals interact with each other for\nmutual benefit, with no real need to do so (Odum, 1971). Our\nfindings lead us to propose that a similar effect is happening\nwith multilevel theory and cross-level empirical research.\nHowever, the growth of multilevel research is mainly due to\nempirical studies with cross-level models. Therefore, multi-\nlevel \"grows\" in publications and in public recognition with\nthe development of cross-level studies. On the other hand,\ncross-level research benefits multilevel thinking, as it must\nrely on models that consider relationships between two or\nmore levels. In fact, it seems that researchers have been using\nthe concepts of multilevel and cross-level almost as if they\nare completely interchangeable. However, for the sake of\nconceptual rigor, researchers must be more cautious with the\nuse of the words multilevel and cross-level. Indeed, a multi-\nlevel study can be more than a cross-level study and cross-\nlevel models are by no means the only true multilevel ones\n(an alternative example is multilevel homologous models).\nThe number of so-called \"multilevel\" papers that focus\nsolely on one level of analysis suggests that there is still\nsome confusion regarding the difference between multilevel\nthinking (considering influences from upper and lower lev-\nels theoretically) and multilevel research (actually modeling\nthe relationships between variables at different levels of\nanalysis and measuring and statistically analyzing them\naccordingly). Multilevel thinking is not absent within the\nacademic community. What is, perhaps, lacking is the oper-\nationalization of that multilevel thinking in more research\nthat actually converts an encompassing vision of organiza-\ntions in empirical studies. Aguinis et al. (2011) argued that\nthere is also a science-practice divide. In accordance with\nthe authors, the practitioners are interested in solving prob-\nlems from all levels of analysis and sometimes researchers\nexplore only one level. When this occurs, practitioners\nbelieve that the research produced is not relevant and cannot\nhelp them. To contribute not only to the understanding of\nFigure 2.

Temporal evolution of the number of \"multilevel\"\narticles published in the last decade.\n8 SAGE Open\norganizational variables and their statistical relationships,\nconducting multilevel research would help bridge the gap\nbetween the science and the practitioner's communities.\nLooking at the organizational reality from a practitioner's\nviewpoint, with the typology of multilevel models in mind\n(Kozlowski & Klein, 2000), one can ask what would be\nmore important: Knowing if the effect of one variable on\nanother means the same thing across levels of analysis or\nunderstanding the effect of an important organizational,\nindustrial, or company-level variable on a team or individ-\nual-level variable? According to the research being done,\nresearchers apparently consider that the latter is more rele-\nvant. Yet, the few numbers of studies may be a consequence\nof the complexity in doing so.\nConsidering the amount of \"multilevel\" studies carried\nout in the last decade (n = 132) in the business and manage-\nment areas, we can assume that, despite multilevel research\nbeing advocated by many researchers, it is not yet a very\ncommon practice. Even influential business and manage-\nment journals are not explicitly asking for multilevel contri-\nbutions. When we analyze journals' aims and scope, we can\nseethatsomeimportantjournalsinBusinessandManagement\n(such as the Journal of Management, the Academy of\nManagement Review, the Journal of Business Economics\nand Management) do not clearly mention that they intend to\npublish multilevel contributions. Other journals refer to lev-\nels of analysis, mentioning that they are \"not tied to any par-\nticular discipline, level of analysis, or national context\"\n(Academy of Management Journal); that they publish\nresearch about psychological phenomena that can be \"at one\nor multiple levels--individuals, groups, organizations, or\ncultures\" (Journal of Applied Psychology); or that \"The jour-\nnal will focus on research and theory in all topics associated\nwith organizational behavior within and across individual,\ngroup and organizational levels of analysis\" (Journal of\nOrganizational Behavior). Nonetheless, the majority of mul-\ntilevel articles are published in these top journals. It seems\nthat journals with a history of having high-quality research\nstandards are more open to complex studies.\nIn spite of the fact that a strong movement toward the\ndevelopment of multilevel theories and knowledge exists,\nmuch is yet to be done and various problems still have to be\nsolved before multilevel can progress. In the following sec-\ntion, we outline some ideas that we hope may contribute for\nthe substantiation of multilevel studies.\nRoadmap to a Meso Paradigm--Many\nChallenges, Some Possible Answers\nMathieu and Chen (2011) argued that despite the multilevel\nparadigm being alive and well, it is also faced with some\nchallenges. However, these can represent opportunities for\nthe field to continue to evolve, if properly addressed. There\nis still much room for enhancing the possibilities of develop-\ning and conducting serious and valid studies with a more\nintegrated approach. Some authors (House, Rousseau, &\nThomas-Hunt, 1995) refer to this integrated science of orga-\nnizations with the term meso, implying that organizational\nscience is simultaneously macro and micro. As previously\nstated by other authors, we believe that the solution may\nindeed lie in meso thinking. Once we start assuming that\ncompanies and organizational systems are complex systems,\nconstantly changing and interacting with outside systems\n(e.g., the market) and inside systems (e.g., departments), it\nbecomes clear that a useful way for us to research in a multi-\nlevel scenario is to think and to do meso.\nLevel of theory.One first challenge concerns the existing\nmodels about organizational theory. Some authors have\nalready identified aspects that may contribute to closing the\ngap between micro and macro and between the science-prac-\nmended that researchers focus on the real-world phenomena\nfaced by practitioners, integrating their knowledge and pro-\nmoting/facilitating multilevel thinking in organizational pro-\nfessionals.As those who are in the field do not analyze reality\nby thinking abstractly about levels or disciplines, they are\nlikely to be able to describe important multilevel phenomena\nthat researchers, embedded in their own disciplines and lev-\nels, may not be able to conceive. However, as most world-\nwide leaders and managers have not been trained to think\n\"multilevel,\" they lack the awareness that several variables\nat different levels may establish interactions that will lead to\nnew arrangements of systems, and influence organizational\ndynamics. Academia should also provide students (future\nprofessionals and researchers) with the appropriate mind-set\nto think (with theories) and act \"multilevel\" (with tools and\nstatistical analysis).\nLevel of measurement.The measurement processes/tech-\nniques/instruments present another considerable challenge\nfor \"multilevel\": there are no clear guidelines about the steps\nnecessary to validate the transition of a construct that exists\nat one level of analysis to another level of analysis. More-\nover, even when there is an attempt to do it, researchers tend\nto aggregate individual answers at higher levels. However,\nthere are concepts that only make sense at the individual\nlevel, and the way they are measured at the individual level\ndoes not reflect the higher level. Studying a higher level con-\nstruct is not just a question of methodology or data analysis,\nbut is essentially a theoretical one. Collective constructs that\nare driven from individual level must have a solid theoretical\nbase that supports their existence.\nLevel of analysis.Multilevel theories and methods assume\nthat units are perfectly nested within higher levels, but this\nsituation is not always true, considering the complexities of\nmost organizational contexts. Thus, analytic techniques\nshould consider the nonindependence of nesting arrange-\nments, namely network approaches and qualitative data for\nLopes Costa et al. 9\nfurther generating appropriate quantitative data. There are\nalso important limitations in software development and an\nabsence of mathematical principals and mature software\ninstruments. Indeed, there are still current software limita-\ntions in making the model specification of some conceptual\nmultilevel models and common metrics for model assess-\nment. As multilevel analysis is complex and highly sensi-\ntive to internal and external variation and until the\ndevelopment or integration (from other sciences) of new\nmathematical procedures is possible, statistical procedure\nmay be a limitation itself for effective multilevel analysis,\nmaking it very difficult for multilevel theory and methodol-\nogy to progress.\nThe time variable.Finally, multilevel temporal issues\nchallenge researchers to model nested and longitudinal rela-\ntionships. This becomes more important as some units may\nchange their higher level membership over time. So, future\nmultilevel research should also address temporal elements.\nAccording to Rousseau (2011), simulations are extremely\nuseful to study effects over time, as they reduce the typi-\ncal complications associated with longitudinal designs and\nare being successfully adopted by some authors (Mathieu &\nSchulze, 2006; Santos & Passos, in press).\nOnce Multilevel, Always Multilevel?\nOne important final consideration is necessary. Despite the\nimportance and the advantages of multilevel thinking, we\nshould not be carried away by its enthusiastic developments\nand assume that we should always conduct multilevel\nresearch. In fact, in some situations, multilevel is not at all\nsuitable. As Simon (1973) stated, even in real-world organi-\nzations, what happens at lower levels (like departments) is\noften ignored by the higher levels (e.g., CEO), except on\nsome occasions (for instance, when the department misses a\ndeadline or goes over the stipulated budget). In this sense, in\nsome situations, researchers would benefit by focusing their\nstudy on parts of the organization instead of the whole.\nMathieu and Chen (2011) have also explored this issue and\nwondered whether all research has to be multilevel. In accor-\ndance with the authors, it is valuable to adopt a bracketing\nstrategy, meaning to include constructs of one level lower\nand one level higher in the conceptual and empirical analy-\nsis. So, researchers should justify why they selected specific\nvariables from one level and why they excluded others.\nIn short, researchers not only have to worry about how to\ndo multilevel research (and deal with the associated prob-\nlems) but also about when to (or not to) do it. Before con-\nducting a multilevel study, researchers need to take some\naspects into account. First, they should only conduct a multi-\nlevel study when it will make a significant contribution\nwithin a given theoretical field. Moreover, researchers should\nonly conduct a multilevel analysis when theory supports the\nmultilevel relationship. If theory does not support it, they\nshould change the variables, hypotheses, or redo the litera-\nture review. Finally, the researchers need to analyze whether\nthere is appropriate theoretical work, methodological proce-\ndures, and instruments to conduct a multilevel analysis, and,\nonly after that, proceed with their work. Otherwise, instead\nof contributing to accurate and useful knowledge, unregu-\nlated and ill-conceived multilevel practices will lead to inac-\ncurate theory building.\nConclusion\nThe present study was conducted using a limited time range\nand \"Management\" web of science categories. Therefore, the\nresults must be interpreted considering these limitations and\nmay not be generalized to other knowledge areas. Moreover,\nwe limited the keyword search to the article's title and ana-\nlyzed only the abstracts, not the full text, which may have led\nto missing some relevant information.\nHowever, within our research criteria, it is clear that now-\nintroduction, no one can say that \"multilevel\" is not alive and\nwell: Multilevel issues are definitely experiencing an inter-\nesting moment, as the attention in this kind of methodology\nseems to be growing. Many researchers are committed to\nexploring the potential of multilevel research, as well as its\nlimitations and weaknesses, or simply reinforcing its prac-\ntice. However, it is assumed that there are some problems\nand challenges to be solved and some bridges to build to\nachieve an effective multilevel theory and practice. Our anal-\nysis demonstrates that researchers recognize the importance\nof multilevel research, but articles on conceptual models are\nalmost as numerous as empirical ones. Moreover, the major-\nity of the empirical papers focus on one specific type of mul-\ntilevel model--cross-level models--but more research is\nstill to be done in other kinds of multilevel models.\nNevertheless, more problematic is the existence of single-\nlevel research under the definition of \"multilevel.\"\nIf we want to intervene and apply our conceptual models\nto real organizations, that are concrete multilevel systems, it\nwill require more than small fragments of problems/phenom-\nena. We need research that focuses on the dynamics between\nlevels of observation and that unfold over time to understand\nhow the different subsystems within organizations interact\nand evolve.\n"
