Human sperm competition most\ncommonly occurs in the context of female infidelity (Shackelford and Pound, 2006; Smith,\n1984). When a woman pursues extra-pair copulations, her regular partner is at risk for\ncuckoldry--the unwitting investment of resources into offspring to whom he is genetically\nunrelated. The reproductive costs of female infidelity may have caused the evolution of\nIs cunnilingus-assisted orgasm a male sperm-retention strategy?\nmale adaptations designed to thwart or counter the costs of infidelity (Shackelford and\nMen use various cues to estimate the risk of their partner's infidelity (and thus\nsperm competition). Men who spend a greater proportion of time apart from their partner\nsince the couple's last copulation experience a greater risk of sperm competition because\ntheir partner has more opportunities to surreptitiously copulate with other men (Baker and\nBellis, 1993a; McKibbin, Bates, Shackelford, Hafen, and LaMunyon, 2010; Pham and\nShackelford, in press; Shackelford, Goetz, McKibbin, and Starratt, 2007; Shackelford et al.,\n2002). Women also may present a recurrent risk of sperm competition for their partner;\nmen mated to women who have a history of infidelity or who possess personality traits\npredictive of infidelity are at greater recurrent risk of sperm competition (Goetz et al.,\n2005; McKibbin et al., 2010). Men mated to more attractive women also are at greater\nrecurrent risk of sperm competition because rival men more frequently approach, and\nsuccessfully lure away, more attractive women (Goetz et al., 2005; Schmitt and Buss,\nMen adjust their behaviors and physiology to minimize the risk of cuckoldry. Men\nat greater risk of sperm competition ejaculate a greater number of sperm at the couple's\nnext copulation (Baker and Bellis, 1993a), report greater interest in copulating with their\npartner (Pham and Shackelford, in press; Shackelford et al., 2002, 2007; Starratt,\nMcKibbin, and Shackelford, 2013), perform deeper and more vigorous copulatory thrusts\nthat may function to displace rival semen (Gallup et al., 2003; Goetz et al., 2005), and are\nmore likely to sexually coerce their partner (Goetz and Shackelford, 2006). Furthermore,\nmen perform more frequently mate retention behaviors--behaviors designed to decrease\nthe risk of their partner's infidelity--when she is ovulating than when she is not ovulating\n(Gangestad, Thornhill, and Garver, 2002; Haselton and Gangestad, 2006; Pillsworth and\nHaselton, 2006). These behaviors appear to be anti-cuckoldry tactics.\nSperm retention and oral sex\nFemale orgasm may play an important role in sperm competition. Female orgasm\nmay promote conception via uterine contractions, which pull sperm further into the\nreproductive tract (Fox, Wolff, and Baker, 1970; Wildt, Kissler, Licht, and Becker, 1998;\nZervomanolakis et al., 2007, 2009), thereby reducing the distance sperm need to travel to\nreach the ova. Some evidence indicates that women retain more sperm when they\nexperience an orgasm temporally near their partner's ejaculation (Baker and Bellis, 1993b),\nand men at greater risk of sperm competition report greater interest in their partner's\norgasm (McKibbin et al., 2010). Men perform various behaviors to facilitate their partner's\norgasm, including vaginal penetration, cunnilingus, and manual vaginal or clitoral\nstimulation, and the induction method may affect the degree to which sperm is retained\nAdditionally, women are more likely to experience a copulatory orgasm when receiving\ncunnilingus than if they do not receive cunnilingus (Richters, de Visser, Rissel, and Smith,\n2006) and men at greater risk of sperm competition report greater interest in, and spend\nmore time performing, cunnilingus on their partner (Pham and Shackelford, 2013a). These\nresults are consistent with a sperm retention explanation for cunnilingus, which proposes\nIs cunnilingus-assisted orgasm a male sperm-retention strategy?\nthat men's interest in, and time spent performing, cunnilingus reflects their motivation to\npromote the occurrence of their partner's orgasm, thereby facilitating retention of the most\nrecently deposited sperm.\nIn this study, we test this sperm-retention hypothesis of cunnilingus. Here, we\nrestrict our sample to men who performed cunnilingus on their partner at the couple's most\nrecent sexual encounter. We predict that, among men who perform cunnilingus on their\npartner, those at greater recurrent risk of sperm competition will be more likely to report\nthat their partner achieved orgasm (Prediction 1). Moreover, previous research indicates\nthat sperm retention increases as the time between a man's ejaculation and his partner's\norgasm decreases, and that the greatest sperm retention occurs when a woman achieves\norgasm one minute before and up to 45 minutes after her partner ejaculates into her vagina\n(Baker and Bellis, 1993b; Thornhill, Gangestad, and Comer, 1995). We therefore predict\nthat, among men whose partner achieves cunnilingus-assisted orgasm, female orgasm will\noccur during the brief time period during which it might function to retain sperm\n(Prediction 2). Because men's relationship satisfaction and the length of their relationship\nare correlated with their interest in their partner's orgasm (McKibbin et al., 2010) and with\nthe performance and frequency of cunnilingus (Kaestle and Halpern, 2007; Santilla et al.,\n2008), we control statistically for these potential confounds.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nWe recruited by word-of-mouth 243 men from universities and the community\n(United States: n = 190; Germany: n = 53) who were at least 18 years of age, and who were\nin a committed, heterosexual, sexual relationship lasting at least one year. Based on\ninformal discussions with the participants, we estimate that 75% of the participants lived\ntogether and 50% were legally married. All participants reported having had sex with their\npartner at least once in the past week. The mean participant age was 25.5 years (SD = 8.2)\nMaterials and procedures\nParticipants reported their age and the length of their current relationship on a\nquestionnaire. Following Goetz et al. (2005), participants answered four questions about\nthe attractiveness of their partner on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 9\n(Extremely): How (1) physically attractive and (2) sexually attractive do you find your\npartner? How (3) physically attractive and (4) sexually attractive do other men find your\npartner? Participants also answered questions about their most recent sexual encounter with\ntheir partner, including whether they performed oral sex on her (Definitely did / Definitely\ndid not / Can't remember) and whether their partner achieved orgasm as a consequence of\noral sex (Definitely did / Definitely did not / I'm not sure). Participants reported the timing\nof their ejaculation relative to their partner's orgasm in minutes, and whether their\nejaculation occurred before, during, or after their partner's orgasm. Finally, participants\nreported their (1) sexual, (2) emotional, and (3) overall satisfaction with their partner, and\n(4) their commitment to their partner, on a 10-point Likert-type scale (0 = Not at all, 9 =\nIs cunnilingus-assisted orgasm a male sperm-retention strategy?\nExtremely). Participants were asked to place the completed questionnaire in an envelope\nthat they then sealed and returned to the experimenter.\nInitial processing of data\nFollowing previous research (Goetz et al., 2005; Pham and Shackelford, 2013a), we\nconstructed a recurrent risk of sperm competition measure ( = .84) from the mean of four\nvariables: how sexually and physically attractive the participant views his partner, and how\nsexually and physically attractive the participant believes other men view his partner. We\nconstructed a relationship satisfaction measure ( = .85) from the mean of four variables:\nsexual, emotional, and overall satisfaction with partner, and commitment to partner. We\nexcluded from analyses data from men who reported not remembering or who were\nuncertain of whether their partner achieved a cunnilingus-assisted orgasm (n = 29).\nFollowing these exclusion criteria, data reported by 214 men remained.\nResults\nTo test Prediction 1, we used hierarchical logistic regression to predict the\noccurrence of cunnilingus-assisted orgasm from recurrent risk of sperm competition,\ncontrolling statistically for men's relationship satisfaction and the length of the relationship.\nIn the first step, we entered recurrent risk of sperm competition into the model, which was\n(Nagelkerke R2) of the variance, and correctly classified 60.7% of the cases (see Table 1).\nTable 1. Logistic regression analysis predicting the occurrence of partner orgasm from the\nrecurrent risk of sperm competition\nPredictors B S.E. Wald Odds Ratio\nNext, we entered relationship length and men's relationship satisfaction into the\nregression model. The full model containing all predictors was statistically significant, 2\nvariance, and correctly classified 62.1% of the cases. Consistent with Prediction 1,\nrecurrent risk of sperm competition significantly predicted the occurrence of partner\norgasm, controlling for relationship length and men's relationship satisfaction (see Table\nIs cunnilingus-assisted orgasm a male sperm-retention strategy?\nTable 2.

Wald Odds Ratio\nFigure 1 displays the timing of men's ejaculation relative to their partner's\ncunnilingus-induced orgasm. To test Prediction 2, we conducted a binomial test (50% test\nproportion) to assess whether, among men whose partner achieved cunnilingus-assisted\norgasm and who ejaculated during penile-vaginal intercourse, female orgasm occurred in\nthe time period during which it might function to retain sperm--one minute before and up\n2 was not supported: 42 of 102 men (41%) reported ejaculating within the greater retention\nFigure 1. Frequency distribution of the amount of time between the participant's\nejaculation and his partner's cunnilingus-assisted orgasm\nIs cunnilingus-assisted orgasm a male sperm-retention strategy?\nDiscussion\nThe results of the current study are not consistent with the hypothesis that\ncunnilingus is designed to promote sperm retention. Men at greater recurrent risk of sperm\ncompetition are more likely to perform cunnilingus on their partner until she achieves\norgasm; however, ejaculation usually does not occur in the brief time period during which\norgasm might function to retain sperm.\nFemale orgasm may be designed to increase relationship satisfaction (Pair-Bond\nHypothesis), to encourage subsequent copulations (Promoting Future Copulations\nHypothesis), to retain preferentially the sperm of men with higher genetic quality (Sire\nChoice Hypothesis), to promote fertilization (for a critical review, see Levin, 2011), or\nfemale orgasm may be a non-functional byproduct of male orgasm (reviewed in Puts,\nDawood, and Welling, 2012). The results of the current research provide support for the\nPair-Bond Hypothesis and the Promotion of Future Copulations Hypothesis. The Pair-Bond\nHypothesis states that female orgasm functions to strengthen the emotional bond between\npartners, and the Promoting Future Copulations Hypothesis states that female orgasm\nfunctions to reward sexual behaviors, thereby promoting future sexual encounters with a\nparticular man. These two hypotheses are consistent with the broader hypothesis that men\npromote their partner's orgasm to minimize the risk of her infidelity because women who\nexperience stronger feelings of intimacy and who are more satisfied with their partner are\nless likely to commit infidelity (Buss and Shackelford, 1997). However, one hypothesis\nalone may not best explain the function of female orgasm (e.g., McKibbin et al., 2010, who\ndocumented that men's risk of sperm competition moderates the association between men's\nrelationship satisfaction and their interest in their partner's orgasm). Given the ongoing\ndebate regarding the function of female orgasm (reviewed in Puts et al., 2012), future\nresearch should continue to investigate the several proposed functions of female orgasm\nand, in particular, should attempt to replicate the research of Baker and Bellis (1993b),\nwhich relied on a relatively small sample to document that female orgasm may increase\nsperm retention.\nPham and Shackelford (2013a) identified three evolutionary functions of\ncunnilingus. Men may perform oral sex on their partner to detect her sexual infidelity by\nsmelling and tasting other men's semen near or within her vagina (Infidelity Detection\nHypothesis; Thornhill, 2006), to facilitate their partner's orgasm and consequent sperm\nretention, or to minimize the risk of their partner's infidelity by increasing her relationship\nsatisfaction (Mate Retention Hypothesis). The results of the current study appear to support\nthe Mate Retention Hypothesis, which is consistent with previous research documenting\nthat men who report greater interest in, and spend more time performing, cunnilingus on\ntheir partner also perform more frequently mate retention behaviors (Pham and\nMen may not be accurate in determining if or when their partner experiences\norgasm. We attempted to address this limitation by excluding from analyses reports from\nmen who were uncertain or who could not remember if their partner had an orgasm.\nHowever, the current study investigates men's sperm competition psychology. Men's anti-\ncuckoldry behaviors (e.g., performing oral sex on their partner until she achieves orgasm,\nIs cunnilingus-assisted orgasm a male sperm-retention strategy?\nejaculating into their partner's vagina temporally near her orgasm) depend on men's\nperception of the risk of their partner's infidelity. Men's perception of the occurrence of\ntheir partner's orgasm is arguably a more appropriate assessment when investigating their\nsperm competition psychology. Future research could nevertheless benefit from securing\ndirectly women's reports of their own orgasm.\nA substantial minority of women cannot achieve orgasm, and research has\nidentified several health factors that adversely affect a woman's capacity to achieve orgasm\n(Lightner, 2002). We secured men's perceptions of their partner's sexual and physical\nattractiveness as proxies for the recurrent risk of sperm competition. These assessments, in\nturn, might provide indirect assessments of women's health (Weeden and Sabini, 2005),\nbut many health conditions may not manifest in women's attractiveness (Weeden and\nSabini, 2005). However, evidence suggests that the vast majority of women are capable of\nexperiencing orgasm (Lloyd, 2005), and that social factors may better predict female\norgasm than sexual health (Marshall, 1971). Nevertheless, future research on female\norgasm could benefit from securing data on the health status of women to control for this\npotential confound.\nThe current research assessed men's risk of their partner's infidelity from their\npartner's attractiveness. Previous research documented that men attend simultaneously to\nmultiple cues to partner infidelity (McKibbin, Starratt, Shackelford, and Goetz, 2011; Pham\nand Shackelford, in press). Future research investigating the function of cunnilingus in\ncontexts of partner infidelity would benefit from using combinations of partner infidelity\ncues, including men's partner's attractiveness (Goetz et al., 2005), her history of infidelity\n(McKibbin et al., 2010), her current conception risk (Gangestad et al., 2002; Haselton and\nGangestad, 2006; Pillsworth and Haselton, 2006), and the time she spends with male\nfriends (Pham and Shackelford, in press).\nIn conclusion, an evolutionary perspective can generate testable hypotheses\nregarding the function of behaviors and underlying mechanisms. In the current research, we\nexplored and tested the functions of cunnilingus and female orgasm. The results of the\ncurrent research suggest that cunnilingus and female orgasm may be best explained as\nelements of a broader male mate retention strategy, but also that a single hypothesis alone\nmay not provide a complete explanation.\nReferences\nBaker, R.
