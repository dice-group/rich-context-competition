The former line of inquiry emphasizes the\nimplications of the timing of residential independence for socioeconomic attainment\nand an overall healthy and successful progression through life course stages (Aassve,\nThe latter, a more recent development, investigates residential mobility outside of the\nparental home as an important contributor to the reproduction of socioeconomic\ninequality during the transition to adulthood (Sharkey 2012; Swisher, Kuhl, and Chavez\n2013). Both literatures tend to emphasize individual moves or transitions (e.g., between\ntwo neighborhoods) and whether those moves are advantageous or disadvantageous to\nyoung adults' long-term socioeconomic attainment.\nWhat remains unclear is the role of frequency of residential mobility in\nreproducing socioeconomic inequality. Frequent residential mobility during the\ntransition to adulthood is often assumed in the life course literature to be a normative\nconsequence of educational, career, and romantic exploration (Arnett 2000; Jang and\non housing instability has found that frequent residential mobility is a phenomenon\namong individuals with low socioeconomic status (Astone and McLanahan 1994;\nBurgard, Seefeldt, and Zelner 2012) that is associated with negative outcomes in the\nrealms of education, employment, food security, and health (Boynton-Jarrett, Hair, and\ndifferent assumptions about who moves during the transition to adulthood and how\nthese moves are associated with trajectories of status attainment.\nTherefore, the present study asks: Does high residential mobility play a role in the\nreproduction of socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood? I assess\nthis question using two criteria: selection and lack of moderation. Young adults with\nlow socioeconomic status (SES) must be sorted into trajectories of rapid residential\nmobility (selection) and differences across residential trajectories cannot simply be a\nsymptom of differences in educational, occupational, and romantic careers (lack of\nmoderation).\nI use two and a half years of monthly move data for a random, population-based\nsample of 868 18- and 19-year-old women in a Michigan county from the Relationship\nDynamics and Social Life (RDSL) Study. RDSL represents an improvement over\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 171\nprevious longitudinal data sets in capturing residential mobility in that monthly data\ncollection promotes greater accuracy among my key subpopulation of interest: those\nexperiencing housing instability. The high level of detail in the residential data allows\nme to combine number and timing of moves in the form of residential trajectories.\nTrajectories are more nuanced than traditional measures of high residential mobility,\nsuch as a threshold number of moves per time period (e.g., three moves per year or\nthree moves per three years) (Cutuli et al. 2013; Pavao et al. 2007). Given that the\ntransition to adulthood is the period of the life course with the highest rates of\nresidential mobility (Arnett 2000), measures that incorporate more detail are crucial in\norder to better distinguish between normative and potentially disadvantageous moving\nbehaviors. The high level of detail in RDSL, leveraged using trajectory methods, yields\nnew insight into the relationship between residential mobility and stratification during\nthe transition to adulthood and provides evidence for considering residential mobility as\nan independent form of inequality that is irreducible to other life events.\n2. Background\nThe transition to adulthood is a distinct life course stage when frequent residential\nmobility is normative (Arnett 2000). Young adults, typically defined as aged 18\u00ad25,\nexperience frequent change as they explore occupations, romantic interests, and\nworldviews. Entrances into and exits from schools, jobs, and cohabiting relationships\noften are accompanied by moves. As a result, mobility peaks during young adulthood\nand declines thereafter: 33% of 18\u00ad25-year-olds have moved at least once in the past\nPerceptions of how residential mobility varies by SES during the transition to\nadulthood differ in the transition to adulthood literature compared to the housing\nliterature. Some in the transition to adulthood tradition may assume that higher\nresidential mobility is a function of college attendance (Lei and South 2016), especially\ngiven the expansion of access to postsecondary education over the past 20 years\n(National Center for Education Statistics 2015). Moves may therefore be associated\nwith upwardly mobile or neutral life events \u00ad such as entering school, summer break,\ngraduation, and career acquisition \u00ad among individuals with high SES. However, only\n43% of young adults enroll in a postsecondary program (Snyder and Dillow 2015), and\nonly 52% of those students move out of the parental home to attend college (Bozick\nClark: Residential mobility and socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood\n172 http://www.demographic-research.org\n2007). This leaves a significant number of moves during young adulthood unaccounted\nfor.\nIn contrast, researchers in the housing instability tradition assume that most high\nresidential mobility is a form of housing instability (Cutuli et al. 2013; Pavao et al.\n2007). Housing instability can be conceptualized broadly as a period of financial\ndistress accompanied by tenuous housing and/or residential mobility. If unchecked,\nhousing instability can eventually lead to homelessness (Desmond 2016). In this\nframework, frequent moving may be a phenomenon among low-SES young adults who\nlack the resources to maintain their housing when faced with job loss, relationship\ninstability, or start-and-stop schooling (Curtis et al. 2013). The ability of young adults\nto support an independent household may be dependent on multiple interrelated factors,\nincluding their own financial resources, the availability of family support, and\nhousehold size (i.e., having to support additional people in the form of a partner and/or\n2.2 Lack of moderation\nIf rapid movers have low SES, they should experience more life events reflective of\neducational, occupational, and romantic instability. Low-SES young adults are less\nlikely to pursue postsecondary education (Bozick and DeLuca 2011). However, if they\ndo, they are more likely to delay enrollment (Bozick and DeLuca 2005) and experience\ninterrupted enrollment (Goldrick-Rab 2006). While college students and college\ngraduates are exploring potential career paths, their less-advantaged peers experience\n\"fragmented transitions into work\" (Shanahan 2000). High school graduates face either\nprolonged periods of unemployment or a `career' consisting of a series of low-paid,\nhigh-turnover jobs (Rosenbaum 2001). Low-income young adults are also more likely\nto experience cycles of relationship dissolution and reconciliation (Halpern-Meekin et\nal. 2013). Low-SES young women are much more likely to become single or cohabiting\nmothers during the transition to adulthood than their high-SES counterparts, who are\nmore likely to delay family formation to complete their postsecondary education and\nestablish a career (Amato et al. 2008). It is possible, then, that these stratified\nexperiences yield more frequent moves for young adults with low SES (Warner and\nSharp 2016), perhaps in ways that reify or exacerbate inequality in other areas of life.\nHowever, differences in residential trajectories may not simply be a symptom of\ndifferences in educational, occupational, and romantic careers. If moves are associated\nwith life events there are two factors that can explain greater residential mobility in\nsome groups of movers but not others: differences in exposure and differences in\nsensitivity. Either more frequent movers are exposed to more life events, necessitating\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 173\nmore frequent moving, or they are more sensitive to these events, resulting in a greater\nlikelihood of moving when they happen, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. For\nexample, more frequent movers may move from job to job or experience intermittent\nschool enrollment with periods of working in-between, necessitating more moves.\nAlternately, even when faced with the same life event, low-SES individuals are more\nlikely to experience a move, whether involuntarily (e.g., because they have no financial\nbuffer to pay rent during unemployment) or voluntarily (e.g., because an increase in\nincome facilitates a move out of a temporary and undesirable living situation). Most\nlikely, both greater exposure and greater sensitivity explain differences in moving\nbehavior. This is consistent with the assumptions of the housing instability literature,\naccording to which housing instability is the result of both financial shocks (e.g., job\nloss, medical emergency) and the absence of resources to weather those shocks (Curtis\n3. Data and methods\n3.1 Relationship Dynamics and Social Life Study\nI use data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) Study, a\nlongitudinal survey based on a random, population-based sample of 1,003 18- and 19-\nyear-old women in a Michigan county. Respondents were drawn from state driver's\nlicense and ID card records. After a face-to-face baseline interview conducted between\nhalf years via a secure website or phone. Of the women located, 93% participated in the\nbaseline interview, and more than 72% of women interviewed at baseline remained in\nthe study for at least 18 months. This analysis uses a sample of 868 respondents who\nremained in the study for at least two months, the minimum amount of time necessary\nto encounter the residential change question at least twice.\nRDSL provides unique insight into the residential trajectories of young women for\nmultiple reasons. First, monthly measures of mobility for a large, population-\nrepresentative sample yield the most accurate picture of residential mobility patterns to\ndate. Second, although RDSL data is drawn from a tight cohort in only one county, this\nensures that the respondents face the same housing and employment markets,\neducational opportunities, and any other time-varying and geographic factors that\ninfluence residential mobility. Third, analyzing young women separately from young\nmen eliminates the need to disentangle gendered family formation (Meier and Allen\nClark: Residential mobility and socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood\n174 http://www.demographic-research.org\nexperiences of housing instability and homelessness (Desmond 2012; US Department\nof Housing and Urban Development 2014). And finally, while RDSL does not capture\nall of the transition to adulthood, which traditionally comprises ages 18\u00ad25, it does\ncapture the period with the most heterogeneity, mobility, and participation in activity\ntypical for that stage of the life course (Arnett 2000). The age range of RDSL\nrespondents enables me to capture in great detail the residential trajectories of those\nwho leave home early and struggle in establishing stable households.\nRDSL samples are from a narrow geographic area. However, this level of detailed\nmobility data, reported in monthly intervals, is not available in national data sets.\nAlthough the National Survey of Families and Households \u00ad which is frequently used\nto investigate home-leaving and returns to the parental home (Aquilino 1991;\nand Lacy 1997) \u00ad includes an event history calendar, respondents are asked to recall\nmultiple years of housing history at a time. This traditional panel structure likely yields\nan undercount of moves in my key subpopulation of interest, rapid movers, especially if\nthey go through periods of couch surfing or other forms of housing instability where\nexact dates and number of residences may be difficult to recall years later. Given that\nyoung adulthood is marked by a great deal of change in multiple areas of life, with\nsignificant consequences for future status attainment, more intensive data collection is\nnecessary to accurately capture residential mobility and its interrelationships with\nromantic, employment, and academic changes.\nAlthough RDSL's sample generalizes to a single county in Michigan, the\nrespondents are roughly comparable to the US population of 18- and 19-year-old\nCommunity Survey (ACS) 3-year Estimates (calculations available from the author\nupon request). Less than half of both samples are employed, approximately one-third\nmove over the course of the year, over two-thirds still live with family, and hardly any\nare married. Since RDSL respondents had to already be 18 when they were sampled, by\nthe time they were interviewed 18-year-olds tended to be older within their 18th year of\nage (i.e., exact age within 18-year-olds was skewed older). When both the RDSL and\nACS samples are limited to 19-year-olds, RDSL respondents have a uniform exact age\ndistribution (age in days unavailable in ACS PUMS) and comparable enrollment in\nboth high school (8% vs. 7% respectively) and postsecondary school (63% vs. 60%) to\nACS respondents.\nThe main difference between the RDSL sample and young women nationally is\nracial and ethnic composition. Twice as many RDSL respondents are black or African\nAmerican (34% vs. 17%) and less than half as many are Hispanic (8% vs. 19%). As\nsuch, the following analyses are not representative of the residential trajectories of\nyoung Latinas nationally.\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 175\nResidential mobility is measured based on addresses provided as contact information,\nwhich respondents were asked to update monthly. Addresses are geocoded. Any change\nin geocode is captured in a time-varying binary move variable. This binary variable is\nused to construct a variable representing cumulative number of moves outside of the\nfamily home: Respondents start with a value of zero or one (for respondents who had\nalready moved out of the family home by baseline, 24%), with one added at each\ninterview reporting a move. Attributing a move at baseline for early home-leavers\nreduces the impact of unobserved heterogeneity based on left-censoring of home-\nleaving trajectories, although I cannot deduce the number of moves outside of the\nfamily home that occurred before baseline. This cumulative variable assumes that\nrespondents do not return to the family home. Supplemental analyses after the main\nresults will address boomeranging, or returns to the family home after the initial home-\nleaving move. The cumulative move variable is used to identify groups of respondents\nwith similar residential trajectories using group-based trajectory analysis, as discussed\nfurther below. This categorical variable is the measure I ultimately use in my analyses\nto identify sorting into residential trajectory groups and differences in exposure as\nopposed to sensitivity to life events across groups.\nThe 868 respondents in this analysis experienced a total of 1,038 moves during the\nstudy. Over the course of the study 43% of respondents never moved, 26% moved\nonce, 15% moved twice, 8% moved three times, and 8% moved four or more times\n(with a maximum of eight moves).\nEach move is coded for context. Specifically, the moves are coded for relationship,\nemployment, and academic changes that occurred concurrently with the move.\nRelationship changes were measured weekly, residential mobility was measured\nmonthly, and academic and employment changes were measured quarterly. The data\ndoes not include when the events occurred in relation to each other.\nA single move could be associated with multiple events in other life domains (see\nTable A-1 in the Appendix for details). Relationship events \u00ad entering cohabitation,\nexiting cohabitation, intimate partner violence, and pregnancy or giving birth \u00ad are not\nmutually exclusive. For example, a woman could both enter cohabitation and become\npregnant. In contrast, employment changes \u00ad (1) entering a job or changing part-time to\nfull-time and (2) leaving a job or changing full-time to part-time \u00ad are mutually\nexclusive. Academic events include starting school, summer break, transferring to a\nschool granting a higher degree (e.g., from a two-year college to a four-year college),\ntransferring to a school granting a lower degree (e.g., from a four-year college to a two-\nyear college), graduating school, and quitting school. These events are mutually\nClark: Residential mobility and socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood\n176 http://www.demographic-research.org\nexclusive. There were 14% of moves that could not be linked with a relationship,\nemployment, or academic event.\n3.2.2 Baseline characteristics\nChildhood and baseline transition to adulthood characteristics predict residential\ntrajectory group membership during the study. These predictors are organized into five\ngroups: childhood background and race, family support, financial resources, education\nand employment, and family formation.\nChildhood background and race are captured by four dichotomous variables, coded\nto one for each of the following conditions: The respondent identifies as black or\nAfrican American, the respondent's mother's educational attainment is less than a high\nschool diploma or equivalent, the respondent did not grow up with two biological\nparents or a biological parent and a step-parent, and the respondent's family ever\nreceived public assistance during the respondent's childhood.\nFamily support is measured by whether the respondent received financial support\nfrom her family at baseline and by whether the respondent was very or extremely close\nto her mother or father during childhood.\nThe respondent's financial resources at baseline are captured by two measures.\nThe first is a binary variable indicating whether the respondent had just enough or not\nenough money for monthly expenses (as opposed to having some money left over at the\nend of the month). The second is a binary variable indicating whether the respondent\nwas a recipient of some form of public assistance.\nThe respondent's employment at baseline is represented by a dichotomous variable\nindicating whether the respondent was employed at all. The respondent's educational\nenrollment at baseline is captured by a categorical variable with three categories: not\nenrolled (the reference category), enrolled in high school, and enrolled in postsecondary\nschool.\nThe respondent's family formation behavior at baseline is measured by whether\nthe respondent was married, engaged, or cohabiting and whether she had ever\nexperienced a live birth.\n3.3 Group-based trajectory analysis\nHousing instability is often operationalized as a dichotomous variable using a threshold\nnumber of moves over a given time period because most measures of housing\ninstability are retrospective over many years. Conceptually, however, housing\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 177\ninstability is better reflected by differences in rate of moves across members of a\npopulation. For example, some individuals with a high number of moves may move so\nrapidly that the constant struggle to maintain stable housing is consuming all of their\ntime and resources, while other individuals with a high number of moves may relocate\nat regular intervals consistent with normative institutional constraints, such as academic\nyears.\nTherefore, I construct a categorical measure of residential mobility based on rate\nof moving via slopes of trajectories. This measurement strategy is made possible by the\ndetailed monthly move data available in RDSL. Trajectories allow moves to be nested\nwithin women and contextualized with regards to when they occur in women's lives\nand when they occur in relation to each other, consistent with a life course perspective.\nSpecifically, using age-graded trajectories distinguishes between leaving home and\nsubsequently moving at different ages, which is crucial given that even a one- or two-\nyear difference in timing during the transition to adulthood can be substantively\nmeaningful (e.g., the difference between leaving the parental home after high school or\nafter completing an associate's degree).\nI use group-based trajectory analysis (GBTA) as opposed to an alternative such as\ngrowth curve modeling (GCM) because a method that yields a single population\naverage trajectory fundamentally fails to distinguish between movers and nonmovers.\nFurthermore, housing stable movers and housing unstable movers likely experience\ndifferent trajectories. GBTA assumes that latent statistical processes generate distinct\ngroups with respect to some variable that changes over time or with age (Nagin 2005;\nassuming that the population varies normally around some mean population trajectory\n(as with GCM), GBTA assumes that a latent variable divides the population into\nsubpopulations, each with its own mean trajectory. Because the variable dividing the\npopulation into distinct patterns of behavior is unobserved, group membership must be\ninferred from the mix of trajectories based on the trajectories' shape. GBTA can\nsimultaneously estimate the predicted trajectory of each group, the percent of the\nsampled population in each group, and a respondent's probability of group membership\n(i.e., posterior probabilities). I use these posterior probabilities to sort respondents into\ntrajectory groups to generate further descriptive statistics, run a series of nested models\npredicting group membership, and conduct a decomposition analysis, described below.\nThe traditional GBTA model assumes that attrition is independent of trajectory\ngroup membership. However, nonrandom attrition may impact estimates of trajectory\ngroup size, particularly when trajectories are initially not well separated and become\nmore distinct over time, as is the case here. Haviland, Jones, and Nagin (2011)\ndeveloped an extension of GBTA for correcting estimates of trajectory group size for\nnonrandom attrition, which I incorporated as a sensitivity analysis using the traj\nClark: Residential mobility and socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood\n178 http://www.demographic-research.org\ncommand in Stata. I ran the final model testing for constant attrition and attrition as a\nfunction of previous residential mobility. Estimates for group size were stable.\nTherefore, I present the final model without adjusting for attrition.\nDecomposition is closely related to standardization (Das Gupta 1993). Both techniques\ndisentangle differences in subpopulation composition (e.g., age structure) from\ndifferences in subpopulation-specific conditional probabilities (e.g., age-specific death\nrates) which combine to yield differences in overall rates (e.g., crude death rate) across\npopulations. However, while standardization holds composition constant to examine\ndifferences in conditional probabilities, decomposition determines the percent of the\ndifference in overall rates attributable to differences in composition and the percent\nattributable to differences in conditional probabilities.\nIn this case, differences across mover groups in rates of experiencing move types\nare attributable to both compositional differences in experiencing a given life event and\ndifferences in conditional probabilities of moving given the life event. More\nsubstantively, compositional differences can be considered differences in exposure to\nlife events and differences in conditional probability can be considered differences in\nsensitivity to moving in response to life events. For example, if some groups are more\nlikely to move while entering school, this can be a result of their greater propensity to\nenter school, their higher probability of moving when they enter school, or both.\nBroadly, the decomposition method used here can be summarized as follows (Preston,\nDifference in rate of move type = difference in exposure to life event (weighted\nby average sensitivity to life event) + difference in sensitivity to life event\n(weighted by average exposure to life event).\nThe decomposition will show whether rapid movers move more frequently than\nother movers because they are exposed to more life events that prompt moves, because\nthey are simply more sensitive to moving when faced with a life event, or both. I\nbootstrap standard errors to test whether exposure effects and sensitivity effects are\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 179\n4. Results\nThe final GBTA model contains three linear residential trajectory groups. These groups\ncomprise a categorical measure of residential mobility used in the following sections to\nidentify socioeconomic selection into trajectory groups and differences in exposure and\nsensitivity to life events across trajectory groups. The Bayesian information criterion\n(BIC) improved with the addition of further trajectory groups up to a total of five (the\nthe four-group model, estimates of group size were highly sensitive to the addition of\ncovariates when multinomial logits predicting group membership were estimated\nsimultaneously with the trajectories (e.g., the estimated size of the smallest group in the\nfour-group model ranged from 5% to 13% of the population). This suggests that\nresidential trajectories across groups were no longer distinct, such that baseline\ncharacteristics significantly influenced trajectory group membership for individuals\nwhose residential trajectories resembled the average of two adjacent groups. This left\ngroup membership highly dependent on the selection of covariates. The final model\nuses three groups so that residential trajectory groups are empirically distinct.\nFigure 1 displays the results of the GBTA model identifying three distinct\nresidential trajectory groups in this population of young women: rare movers, gradual\nmovers, and rapid movers. The figure depicts estimated trajectories for each trajectory\ngroup, the 95% pointwise confidence intervals on the estimated trajectories, and the\nobserved group means for each trajectory. The legend includes the estimated percent of\nthe population in each group. These population estimates are generated by the GBTA\nmodel. In contrast, Figure 2 presents sample means calculated by assigning each RDSL\nrespondent to a trajectory group using posterior probabilities generated by the GBTA\nmodel. Figure 2 shows the distribution of moves occurring during the study within each\ntrajectory group. Note that women who had already left the family home by baseline\n(24% of the sample) are categorized as movers due to their early home-leaving, even if\nthey do not move during the observation period.\nClark: Residential mobility and socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood\n180 http://www.demographic-research.org\nFigure 1: Estimated residential trajectory groups in RDSL, by estimated\npercent of population\nNotes: The solid lines represent estimated trajectories.

Women in this trajectory group will henceforth\nbe called rare movers. All rare movers were living with family at baseline (descriptive\nstatistics for living with family at baseline available upon request). Most (87% of rare\nmovers) do not move over the course of the study, and a small fraction (12%) move\nonce toward the end of the study out of the family home (an additional 1% move twice\ntoward the end of the study; descriptive statistics for timing of moves available upon\nrequest). The rare movers have a very stable residential trajectory characterized by\nresidence in the parental home for most if not all of the study period.\nThe second largest residential trajectory group (35% of the population) is\ncharacterized by gradual residential change. Women in this trajectory group will\nhenceforth be called gradual movers. Most gradual movers lived in the family home at\nbaseline (76% of gradual movers) and move once (49%) or twice (24%) over two and a\nhalf years, with moves spaced about one year apart. This level of mobility is consistent\nwith young women gradually gaining independence and/or coordinating their housing\nwith the academic calendar.\nThe final residential trajectory group (24% of the population) is characterized by\nrapid residential change. Women in this trajectory group will henceforth be called rapid\nmovers. Most rapid movers had moved out of the family home by baseline (65% of\nrapid movers) and experience moves in rapid succession, with around half (51%)\nmoving three or more times over the course of the study. This mobility pattern is\npotentially unstable, contingent on other characteristics of the respondents and their\nmoves.\nTable 1 presents the results of two series of nested logistic regressions of baseline\ncharacteristics that predict membership in residential trajectory groups. The first series\n(Models 1\u00ad5) predicts whether respondents were movers (i.e., rapid or gradual movers\nvs. rare movers). The second series (Models 6-10) limits the sample to movers and\npredicts whether respondents were rapid movers (vs. gradual movers). To shed light on\nmediated (indirect) effects between low socioeconomic status and patterns of residential\nmobility, Models 1 and 6 begin with indicators of childhood background and race,\nwhich I interpret as exogenous. In the following models, I introduce blocks of variables\ncorresponding to different dimensions of the transition to adulthood: family support,\nfinancial resources, education and employment, and family formation.\nClark: Residential mobility and socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood\n182 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 1: Logistic regressions predicting trajectory group membership:\nMovers (vs. rare movers) and rapid movers (vs. gradual movers)\nMovers (vs. rare movers) Rapid movers (vs. gradual movers)\nChildhood background and race\nChildhood public\nassistance\nDid not grow up in two-parent\nhousehold\nMother's education less\nthan high school\nFamily support\nVery or extremely close to\nclosest parent\nFinancial resources\nJust enough/not enough\nmoney for expenses\nEducation and employment\nEnrolled in postsecondary\nschool\nFamily formation\nMarried, engaged, or\ncohabiting\nNotes: Standard errors are shown in parentheses.  p < .10, * p < .05, ** p < .01.\nIn the full sample, growing up in a household that received public assistance or\nwas not headed by two parents is significantly associated with residential mobility\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 183\n(Model 1). The effect of childhood poverty is fully mediated by financial resources\navailable to the respondent at baseline: Movers are less likely to receive financial\nsupport from family (Model 2) and more likely to have difficulty paying for their\nexpenses and to receive public assistance (Model 3). The effect of growing up without\ntwo parents is partially but not fully mediated by these indicators of financial resources.\nHigh school enrollment predicts membership in the rare-mover group (Model 4) and\nbeing in a serious relationship (married, engaged, or cohabiting) is associated with\nresidential mobility (Model 5). However, neither of these variables significantly\nmediates the effects of childhood background. Notably, enrollment in postsecondary\nschool does not significantly predict residential mobility (Model 4).\nAmong movers, growing up in a household that received public assistance is\nassociated with rapid moving (Model 6). The effect of childhood poverty is fully\nmediated by financial resources: Rapid moving is associated with lack of financial\nsupport from family (Model 7) and public assistance receipt at baseline (Model 8).\nOnce again, enrollment in postsecondary school does not significantly predict\nresidential trajectory group membership (Model 9). However, the effect of all SES\nindicators is fully mediated through relationship status (Model 10).

RDSL did not measure household structure at every\nweekly interview, but rather at two points: baseline and an optional supplement one\nyear into the study. I constructed a summary variable counting the number of moves to\na known family residence. Some 15% of gradual movers and one-fifth (21%) of rapid\nmovers moved once to a family residence. Twelve respondents in the entire sample\nmoved twice to a family residence, eight of whom experienced four or move moves.\nTherefore, the vast majority of high mobility is not a function of young adults\nboomeranging back to stable family residences. While some respondents may be\nmembers of households that are housing unstable, this also cannot account for most\nresidential mobility.\n5. Discussion\nThis study sought to determine whether residential mobility plays a role in the\nreproduction of socioeconomic inequality during the transition to adulthood based on\nthe presence of socioeconomically stratified selection and absence of moderation by\ndifferential experiences of life events. Using two and a half years of monthly mobility\ndata for a population-representative sample of young women in a county in Michigan, I\nfound that movers are young women who experienced poverty as children and have\naccess to limited financial resources as young adults. Rapid movers have even lower\nSES than gradual movers, but the effect of SES for rapid movers is entirely mediated by\nrelationship status. In other words, rapid movers are having accelerated transitions to\nadulthood that they cannot financially support. Second, I found that rapid movers and\ngradual movers mostly experience the same educational, employment, and romantic\nchanges. Rapid movers do not move more frequently because they experience more life\nevents that prompt moves. Rather, rapid movers are more sensitive to moving in the\nface of life changes.\nThese findings speak to an underlying assumption in the home-leaving literature\nthat early home-leaving is disadvantageous \u00ad unless the destination is a college\ndormitory \u00ad because young adults leave home before they are prepared to support\nindependent households. Previous research has found that early home-leaving is\npredicted by poverty, not growing up with two biological parents, and early family\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 187\naftermath or consequences of early home-leaving (for an exception, see White and Lacy\n1997). The results of this study are consistent with previous findings in the home-\nleaving literature and begin to confirm the disadvantages associated with early home-\nleaving. For rapid movers, who overwhelmingly leave the family home before age 18\nor 19, early home-leaving is part of an accelerated and underfunded transition to\nadulthood. Rapid movers then experience greater residential mobility, which is not\ncompensated for by accompanying upwardly mobile life events.\nThese results are much more consistent with a housing instability perspective on\nhigh residential mobility than a socioeconomically upwardly mobile college student\ntrajectory. Low-SES individuals do not rely on their parents for housing and often have\nalready entered serious relationships. With greater financial responsibilities and fewer\nresources, they are less able to weather shocks (i.e., maintain stable housing when faced\nwith relationship and employment changes), although for the most part they are no\nmore likely to experience these life events.\nThe RDSL data set provides unprecedented detail on the residential trajectories of\nyoung women. However, I acknowledge some limitations. Significant findings in the\ndecomposition analysis with regards to relationship and pregnancy changes but not\nacademic changes could be a result of greater precision in that data. Weekly\nrelationship and pregnancy changes are linked to monthly moves, as opposed to\nquarterly academic changes. However, this is unlikely for two reasons. First, most\nacademic changes occur at regular, infrequent intervals (i.e., at the beginning or end of\nacademic terms). Therefore, weekly detail is unnecessary. Furthermore, unlike exiting\nor entering cohabitation, the change in academic status does not necessarily occur\nsimultaneously with the move. Moving may be anticipatory (e.g., before the school year\nbegins) or reactionary (e.g., after graduation). Second, employment changes are\nmeasured just as infrequently but yielded significant results, suggesting that the\nprecision of the education data did not interfere with the significance of findings.\nAlthough the data collection site was chosen to be representative of young women\nin the United States in many ways, there are very few Latinas in the sample. Available\nstatistics suggest that Latin Americans may be less likely to be homeless and more\nlikely to be housing unstable (Conroy and Heer 2003), suggesting that they have\ndifferent housing options and constraints compared to non-Hispanics. The findings\nfrom this analysis cannot be generalized to Latinas.\nAs demographers begin to uncover the ways in which housing can function as a\nmechanism for the reproduction of poverty in adulthood (Desmond 2012; Desmond and\nShollenberger 2015), researchers should further explore the role of residential\ntrajectories in contributing to stratified transition to adulthood experiences. More data\ncollection is needed at the national level to uncover trends in residential mobility\nClark: Residential mobility and socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood\n188 http://www.demographic-research.org\namong Latinas and young men. Young men likely experience different residential\nmobility patterns than young women due to gendered family formation (Meier and\nexperiences of housing instability and homelessness (Desmond 2012; US Department\nFuture research should also capture the entire transition to adulthood. Data\ncollection for RDSL ended when respondents were 22. This right-censoring is most\nsignificant for the rare-mover group, most of whom remained in the family home at\ntheir last observation. Likely, many members of this group exit the family home by age\n25, with some young women experiencing high residential mobility. It is unclear\nwhether housing instability is substantively different for individuals who are able to\ndelay home-leaving \u00ad for example, because they have different relationships with their\nfamilies \u00ad or if these individuals resemble the rapid group but simply exit home later.\nResearchers should also disentangle the causal relationship between residential\nmobility and associated life events. For rapid movers, housing instability may represent\neither a mechanism that can partially account for well-documented educational and\noccupational struggles or a significant and previously unmeasured outcome of this\n`churning' and `floundering' for low-SES young adults. Data sets with self-reported\nreasons for move or voluntariness of move would be particularly well suited to this\nanalysis. Such research would help determine whether direct housing interventions or\nimprovements in educational and employment access and security would better address\nthe cycle of instability experienced by young adults.\n6.
