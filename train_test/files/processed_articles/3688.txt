    "abstract": "Abstract\nTo efficiently interact with the external environment, our nervous system combines information\narising from different sensory modalities. Recent evidence suggests that cross-modal interactions\ncan be automatic and even unconscious, reflecting the ecological relevance of cross-modal\nprocessing. Here, we use continuous flash suppression (CFS) to directly investigate whether\nhaptic signals can interact with visual signals outside of visual awareness. We measured\nsuppression durations of visual gratings rendered invisible by CFS either during visual\nstimulation alone or during visuo-haptic stimulation. We found that active exploration of a\nhaptic grating congruent in orientation with the suppressed visual grating reduced suppression\ndurations both compared with visual-only stimulation and to incongruent visuo-haptic stimulation.\nWe also found that the facilitatory effect of touch on visual suppression disappeared when the\nvisual and haptic gratings were mismatched in either spatial frequency or orientation. Together,\nthese results demonstrate that congruent touch can accelerate the rise to consciousness of a\nsuppressed visual stimulus and that this unconscious cross-modal interaction depends on visuo-\nhaptic congruency. Furthermore, since CFS suppression is thought to occur early in visual cortical\nprocessing, our data reinforce the evidence suggesting that visuo-haptic interactions can occur at\nthe earliest stages of cortical processing.\n",

While multisensory\nintegration--the merging the information from different modalities in a single percept --is\nnot mandatory (Ernst & Banks, 2002; Hillis, Ernst, Banks, & Landy, 2002) and relies on\nattention (van Ee, van Boxtel, Parker, & Alais, 2009) and awareness (for a review on\nmultimodal awareness, see Deroy, Chen, & Spence, 2014), cross-modal interactions might\nbe more automatic. Cross-modal interactions occur when a signal from one sensory modality\nis modulated by a signal from another modality. Growing evidence suggests that cross-modal\ninteractions between vision and other modalities can occur outside of visual awareness, such\nas when a visual stimulus presented to one eye undergoes a temporary suppression due to a\nconflicting image presented to the other eye (reviewed in Deroy et al., 2016; Faivre, Salomon,\n& Blanke, 2015). Studying such ``unconscious'' cross-modal interactions is important for\nunderstanding both cross-modal processing and human awareness. Regarding cross-modal\nprocessing, unconscious unisensory processing (e.g., visual) is limited mainly to the earliest\nstages of sensory processing (e.g., the primary visual cortex, Sterzer, Stein, Ludwig,\nRothkirch, & Hesselmann, 2014). Thus, any demonstration of cross-modal interactions\noccurring outside of unisensory awareness would imply that primary sensory cortices\nshould not be considered as uniquely unisensory but rather as areas that receive inputs\nfrom other sensory modalities. As for models of human awareness, cross-modal\ninteractions outside of unisensory awareness have important theoretical implications\nbecause it would challenge the proposal that cross-modal binding requires conscious\nprocessing of the unisensory stimuli (Baars, 2002).\nTwo psychophysical paradigms are particularly efficient in inducing interocular\nsuppression: binocular rivalry, and its variant continuous flash suppression (CFS).\nBinocular rivalry occurs when unrelated images are presented at the same time onto\nhomologous portions of the two retinae. The conflicting dichoptic stimulation prevents\nbinocular integration and triggers competing interocular inhibition processes, resulting in\nalternating suppression of each eye and thus fluctuations in visual perception between the\ntwo monocular images (Alais & Blake, 2005; Blake & Logothetis, 2002). CFS occurs when\none eye is presented with a static visual stimulus, while the other one is presented with a\ndynamic mask in which random high-contrast patterns (known as ``mondrians'') are flashed\nsequentially, typically at a frequency of 10 Hz (Tsuchiya and Koch, 2005). Dynamic patterns\nare known to predominate during binocular rivalry and CFS exploits this characteristic using\nflickering Mondrians to produce strong suppressive power and consequently long-lasting\nperiods of suppression compared with binocular rivalry (Tsuchiya, Koch, Gilroy, & Blake,\n2006). An advantage of CFS is that while suppression epochs in binocular rivalry are highly\nvariable in duration and the dominant percept at onset is unpredictable, CFS allows a more\npredictable suppression: if no transients occur in the eye presented with the static image, the\ndynamic mask will immediately suppress the other stimulus for several seconds.\nEvidence from several recent studies has shown that during either binocular rivalry or\nCFS, non-visual sensory modalities (e.g., auditory; Conrad, Bartels, Kleiner, & Noppeney,\nvestibular; Salomon, Kaliuzhna, Herbelin, & Blanke, 2015, and bodily; Saletu, Anderer,\nKinsperger, Gru\n\u00a8 nberger, & Sieghart, 1988, signals) are able to interact with the suppressed\nvisual stimulus (reviewed in Deroy et al., 2016). In particular, it has been shown that during\nbinocular rivalry, unambiguous haptic stimulation promotes dominance of the congruent\nvisual stimulus independently of awareness: touch prolongs dominance durations of the\ncongruent visual stimulus and is also able to rescue it from suppression, making it visible\n(Lunghi et al., 2010). This cross-modal interaction is highly specific and relies on the objective\ncongruency in spatial frequency (Lunghi et al., 2010), orientation (Lunghi & Alais, 2013), and\nspatial proximity (Lunghi & Morrone, 2013) between the visual image and the tactile\nstimulus. A study investigating the effect of touch on the strength of binocular rivalry\nsuppression using visual and tactile gratings showed that congruent haptic stimulation\ninteracted with binocular rivalry mainly by preventing the congruent visual stimulus from\nbecoming deeply suppressed (Lunghi & Alais, 2015). While this suggests the cross-modal\ninteraction involves strengthening the congruent visual stimulus, a complementary possibility\nyet to be investigated is that the tactile stimulus may also suppress the incongruent visual\nstimulus. Even though these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, binocular rivalry\nparadigms (unlike CFS) cannot disentangle their relative contribution to the observed effect.\nUnderstanding this is particularly important for assessing whether the integration between\nvisual and haptic signals occurs at the conscious level (through the suppression of the\nincongruent dominant stimulus) or unconscious level (through the enhancement of the\nsuppressed congruent visual signal).\nHere, we investigate whether haptic stimulation can interact with a visual grating stimulus\nrendered invisible by CFS. Using a tactile grating stimulus, we will test whether the\ninteraction with the suppressed visual grating is tuned for matching spatial frequency and\norientation. On the basis of the results obtained in binocular rivalry paradigms, we anticipate\nthat haptic gratings, when congruent with orientation and spatial frequency of the visual\ngrating, will decrease the suppression duration of the visual grating.\nMaterials and Methods\nSubjects\nA total of 14 subjects (3 females, average age \u00c6 SD: 25.9 \u00c6 3.5 years), including two authors\nof this study (C. L., and L. L.), participated in the experiment. All subjects had normal or\ncorrected-to-normal vision, no strong eye preference (measured as eye-predominance in\nbinocular rivalry), normal stereoacuity (Frisby Stereotest, Sasieni, 1978) and were right-\nhanded. Except the two authors, all subjects were nai\u00a8ve to the purposes of the experiment.\nEthic Statement\nThe experimental protocol was approved by the Tuscany regional ethics committee of the\nAzienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Meyer and was performed in accordance with the\nDeclaration of Helsinki. All participants gave written informed consent.\nApparatus and Stimuli\nThe experiment took place in a quiet room in total darkness to remove any spatial frame of\nreference. The visual stimuli were developed in Matlab (version 7.11.0, The MathWorks Inc.,\nNatick, MA) using Psychtoolbox-3 (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997) running on a PC. The stimuli\nconsisted of red or blue dynamic maskers (``Mondrians,'' Hesselmann & Malach, 2011) and\nred or blue target gratings. The stimuli were presented dichoptically through anaglyph red and\nblue goggles, superimposed with the grating in the center of the Mondrian, and were presented\non a uniform black background (luminance: 0.17 cd/m2) in central vision, surrounded by a\nLunghi et al. 3\nFigure 1. Experimental paradigm. (a) Diagram of a visual trial: 500 ms after the onset of the cue (letter ``V''),\nthe visual stimuli appeared. The contrast of the target grating was ramped from 0 to 10%, 20%, or 40% to\navoid any transient that could break CFS. When the grating emerged from interocular suppression, observers\nreported its orientation (tilted left or tilted right) by pressing the appropriate mouse button. (b) Diagram of a\nvisuo-haptic trial: same as (a), except that after the presentation of the cue observers were instructed to\nreach the haptic grating with their right index finger and explore it until the visual grating became visible. The\nvisual stimuli appeared 500 ms after the onset of touch. On each trial, the orientation of the haptic grating\nwas varied and could be either congruent or incongruent with the orientation of the visual target grating.\nwhite smoothed circle (see Figure 1). The target stimulus was one of two orthogonal sinusoidal\ngratings (orientation: \u00c645, diameter: 3). In separate blocks, gratings having different\ncontrasts (10%, 20%, or 40% of the maximum contrast) and spatial frequencies (2 or 3\ncycles/degree) were used as target stimuli. Peak luminance of the red stimulus was matched\nto the peak luminance of the blue one (1.7 cd/m2). A set of 50 independent Mondrian-like\nmasks were pregenerated and served as suppressors. These were presented to one eye at a rate\nof 10 Hz, meaning that the suppressor was refreshed with an independently drawn suppressor\nfrom the set of Mondrians every 100 ms. Mondrian masks were generated by randomly\npositioning 64 minimum, maximum, and medium luminance red or blue circles of different\nsize (ranging from 0.12 to 0.54). For an example of the visual stimuli used in the experiment,\nsee Figure 1. The visual stimuli in each eye contained a small (0.2) white fixation square in\ntheir center and were presented on a 24-inch LCD display (Acer LCD GD245HQ) positioned\nhorizontally and mounted 35 cm above a mirror, so that the visual stimulus could be projected\nexactly over the location of the haptic stimulus. Observers viewed the stimuli reflected in the\nmirror, at a distance of 35 cm from the observers' eyes.\nPlaced 35 cm under the mirror, the haptic stimulus consisted of a 3D-printed sinusoidal\ngrating (diameter 3 cm, 2 cycles/cm of spatial frequency). The grating was mounted on a\nservomotor which could rotate the grating arbitrarily to any given orientation. We recorded\nthe temporal dynamics of the movements of the observers' fingers on the haptic grating using\nan LED and a photoresistor which were placed laterally to the 3D grating. When the\nobserver's finger reached the grating, the light beam from the LED to the photoresistor\nwas interrupted, signaling the onset of touch. The servomotor, LED, and photoresistor\nwere controlled by an Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller (D'Ausilio, 2012) interfaced with\nMatlab using the Arduino IO Package (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/\nfileexchange/32374-legacy-matlab-and-simulink-support-for-arduino).\nExperimental Procedure\nFive different conditions were tested. Three experimental conditions tested visual target\ncontrasts of 10%, 20%, and 40%. These conditions contained three types of trials:\ncongruent touch, incongruent touch, and no touch. In all experimental conditions, the\ntactile and visual gratings matched in spatial frequency, but congruent (parallel) and\nincongruent (orthogonal) orientations were both compared against no-touch trials. For the\ncurrent experiment, we define visual and haptic stimuli as being ``congruent'' when their\nobjective features are compatible (e.g., the visual and haptic stimuli have the same size,\norientation, and spatial frequency), so that the visuo-haptic information can be interpreted\nas arising from the same object. There were also two control conditions tested at 20% visual\ntarget contrast, comparing visuo-haptic stimuli mismatched in orientation (same spatial\nfrequency as vision, 2 cycles/cm, but the haptic gratings were rotated 15 away from\nparallel and orthogonal to the visual orientation) and visuo-haptic stimuli mismatched in\nspatial frequency (haptic gratings were perfectly parallel or orthogonal to the visual grating\nbut incongruent trials used haptic gratings with 3 cycles/cm instead of 2 cycles/cm).\nAll conditions were tested in separate blocks, and the experimental procedure was the\nsame in all conditions. Each observer participated in two experimental sessions for each of\nthe five conditions. Each session consisted of 54 trials, so that each participant performed a\ntotal of 540 trials, divided into 10 experimental sessions. At the beginning of each trial, a cue\nletter (``V'' or ``T'') presented for 500 ms indicated to the observer, whether it was a visual\n(``V'') or touch (``T'') trial. In visual trials (Figure 1(a)), the dichoptic CFS stimuli (a grating\ntarget to one eye and a dynamic Mondrian masker to the other) appeared 500 ms after the\nLunghi et al. 5\nonset of the cue. To ensure invisibility of the target grating, its contrast was ramped from 0 to\nthe condition's maximum contrast (10%, 20%, or 40%) over a period of 1.5 sec following an\non-ramp with a half-Gaussian profile.\nThe observer's task was to report the orientation of the visual grating (left or right, pressing\nthe corresponding mouse button) as soon as it broke through CFS suppression and became\nvisible. The observer's button-press determined the end of the trial. The touch trials (Figure\n1(b)) were similar to the visual trials except that after the cue presentation, observers were\ninstructed to reach for the haptic grating with their right index finger and explore it performing\nlateral scanning movements until the visual target grating became visible. On each trial, the\nhaptic grating could be either congruent (parallel) with the visual target stimulus, or\nincongruent (orthogonal) with it. In touch trials, the visual stimuli appeared 500 ms after\nthe onset of touch, as signaled by the photoresistor and LED combination. Both visual and\ntouch trials were intermingled during each experimental session so that for each block similar\nnumbers of visual, touch-congruent, and touch-incongruent trials were tested. The orientation\nof the target grating and the color (and therefore eye) associated with each visual stimulus (red\nor blue) was randomized on each trial.\nExclusion of Subjects\nA total of 2 of 14 subjects were excluded from the analyses because of poor accuracy (<75%\ncorrect responses) in the grating orientation discrimination task, indicating that these subjects\nwere non-reliable.\nAnalyses\nSuppression times were computed for each stimulation type (visual, visuo-haptic congruent,\nvisuo-haptic incongruent) and each experimental condition as the mean time elapsed between\nthe visual stimulus presentation and the reported visibility of the grating. Trials in which\nobservers reported the wrong visual grating orientation were discarded from the analyses.\nOutlier durations were discarded from the analyses, with outliers defined as suppression\ndurations greater than \u00c63 SD from the average duration for each subject (15% of trials,\non average). Accuracy in the visual task was computed as the percentage of correct responses.\nSuppression durations and accuracy for the different types of stimulation and each condition\nwere compared across subjects using repeated-measures ANOVAs and two-tailed paired-\nsamples t tests. The Bonferroni-Holm correction for multiple comparisons was applied to\nthe t tests comparing different conditions.\nResults\nMain Experiment\nWe investigated the effect of haptic stimulation on interocular suppression times combining\nCFS, in which dynamic Mondrian maskers presented to one eye suppress a visual grating (the\ntarget stimulus) in the other, with active exploration of a haptic grating congruent or\nincongruent in orientation with the visual grating (see Figure 1).

In different blocks, visual stimuli having three\n(touch stimulation: no touch [visual-only], visuo-haptic congruent and incongruent)\nrepeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of the contrast factor,\nthe linear decrease in suppression time with increasing contrast (Figure 2).\nSuppression times also varied as a function of touch stimulation (Figure 3). Suppression\ndurations were significantly shorter for congruent visuo-haptic stimulation (mean duration\na \u00bc 0.025, p \u00bc .022). There was no significant difference between no-touch and incongruent\nvisuo-haptic stimulation (p > .05).

However, the effect was not significant for target stimulus\ncontrast of 40% (\u00c06%, one-sample t test, H0\nControl Experiments\nControl experiments investigated whether the facilitatory effect of congruent haptic\nstimulation on visual suppression duration was selective for orientation and spatial\nfrequency. We tested the effect of introducing a visuo-haptic mismatch between the\ngratings in either orientation (Figure 5(a): spatial frequency was matched, but \u00fe15 was\nadded to the haptic gratings for both parallel and orthogonal conditions) or spatial\nfrequency (Figure 5(b): parallel and orthogonal haptic gratings were as for the\nexperimental condition, but haptic frequency was increased to 3 cycles/cm, vs. 2 cycles/cm\nfor vision). The visual grating contrast was fixed at 20%. Whether the haptic grating\nmismatched with vision in orientation (Figure 5(a)) or in spatial frequency (Figure 5(b)),\nsuppression durations were very similar. In both experiments, neither of the touch conditions\n(congruent vs. incongruent) differed from each other or from the no-touch condition (all\nps > .41). This indicates that the effect of congruent touch on reducing CFS suppression\ndurations is selective for both orientation and spatial frequency.\nFigure 5. Control experiments: visuo-haptic orientation and spatial frequency mismatch. Average\nsuppression durations measured in two control experiments in which a mismatch in either visuo-haptic\norientation (a) or spatial frequency (b) was introduced. In both experiments, suppression durations measured\neither during congruent (red bars) or incongruent (blue bars) visuo-haptic stimulation did not differ from\ndurations measured during visual only stimulation (no touch, grey bars). The symbols represent individual\nsubjects' suppression times across conditions.\nLunghi et al. 9\nDiscussion\nWe have demonstrated that haptic stimulation is able to boost a congruent, suppressed visual\nstimulus into visual awareness. Exploring a haptic stimulus matching in orientation and\nspatial frequency with a visual stimulus rendered invisible by CFS shortened visual\nsuppression duration. A number of recent studies have shown that signals in various non-\nvisual sensory modalities can modulate the visibility of a visual stimulus during CFS. For\nexample, visual suppression durations have been shown to be slightly shorter (in the range of\n12\u00ad200 ms) when paired with congruent acoustic (Aller, Giani, Conrad, Watanabe, &\nsignals. A limitation of these studies, however, is that they only compared suppression\ndurations for congruent cross-modal stimuli with suppression durations for incongruent\ncross-modal stimuli. While these congruency effects suffice to reveal cross-modal\ninteractions, the absence of a visual-only baseline makes it impossible to determine\nwhether the cross-modal effects arise from a facilitation due to congruent cross-modal\nstimulation, or rather from a masking effect of the incongruent cross-modal stimulation.\nHere, we have demonstrated for the first time that cross-modal stimulation can actually\nspeed the access of the suppressed visual stimulus to consciousness, relative to a visual-\nonly condition. Our results show a robust decrease of CFS suppression durations during\ncongruent visuo-haptic stimulation both compared with visual-only stimulation (\u00c0640 ms)\nand to incongruent visuo-haptic stimulation (\u00c01008 ms), indicating unambiguously that\ncongruent touch accelerates the rise of the suppressed image to visual awareness.\nOur results are in line with accumulating recent evidence in binocular rivalry showing that\ntouch can interact with a congruent visual stimulus when it is suppressed and shorten its\n2013; Lunghi et al., 2014). Here, using CFS, we provide an even stronger demonstration that\ncongruent haptic and visual signals can interact outside of visual awareness. This is due to that\nfact that the initial period of perceptual suppression in CFS is complete: the dynamic mask\ntotally suppresses the visual target stimulus, so that the observer cannot know the orientation\nor spatial frequency of the suppressed grating. During binocular rivalry, by contrast, visual\nperception oscillates between the two monocular images (e.g., orthogonal gratings), so that\neven though one stimulus may be clearly dominant at a given moment (and thus the other\nsuppressed), the observer has some cognitive knowledge about the features of the suppressed\nvisual stimulus and has likely seen it in the previous rivalry phase. This knowledge of the\nsuppressed stimulus' properties could potentially contribute to the congruency effect of\ncross-modal stimulation in binocular rivalry. By replicating the effects using CFS, we rule\nout the possibility that they are entirely mediated by response bias or shifts in cross-modal\nattention. This is also corroborated by the strict selectivity of the effect that we found for\nmatched visuo-haptic orientations and spatial frequencies. In fact, it has been previously\nreported (Lunghi & Alais, 2013) that when engaged in a visual task, observers cannot\nconsciously recognize a visuo-haptic orientation mismatch of 15 (that in our experiment\ndisrupts the cross-modal interaction). This further supports the evidence that the facilitatory\neffect of touch that we found is not attributable to a high-level semantic priming effect or\ncategorical decision of the observer.\nAnother strength of the CFS paradigm for demonstrating cross-modal interactions is that\nthe target grating rivals with an unrelated dynamic Mondrian mask. In the binocular rivalry\nstudies mentioned earlier, visual competition is often created by dichoptically presenting\northogonal gratings, so that the suppression of the visual grating congruent with the\nhaptic orientation corresponds to the dominance phase of the visual grating incongruent with\nthe haptic orientation. This makes it difficult to completely exclude the possibility that the shorter\nsuppression durations observed during congruent visuo-haptic stimulation are in fact due to a\nconcomitant inhibitory effect of touch on the dominant incongruent visual grating and thereby\nreducing its dominance duration. In CFS, however, the visual grating congruent in orientation\nwith the haptic one is suppressed by a dynamic Mondrian mask that is completely unrelated to\nthe visual target stimulus. Therefore, we can conclude with confidence that the facilitatory effect\nof congruent cross-modal stimulation is due to touch strongly boosting the strength of the\nsuppressed visual signal. Indeed, based on previous measures of the strength of CFS\nsuppression, the boost in strength of the suppressed visual image by the congruent tactile\ngrating must be considerable because contrast sensitivity during CFS is reduced enormously,\nabout a 20-fold decrease relative to monocular viewing (Tsuchiya et al., 2006). The vigorous\neffect of congruent haptic stimulation on suppressed visual stimuli indicates that signals arising\nfrom different sensory modalities can enhance visual awareness. This suggests that unisensory\nawareness is not encapsulated for each modality, but rather that human awareness should be\nconsidered as a multisensory phenomenon, in which conscious perception in one sensory\nmodality (e.g., touch) can enhance awareness in a different one (e.g., vision). This cross-modal\nboost of visual awareness relies on congruency between the stimuli in the different modalities\n(Deroy et al., 2016), whereas it is not observed for newly learnt cross-modal associations (Faivre,\nAnother interesting aspect of these data is the evidence for stimulus selectivity in the cross-\nmodal interaction. Our control experiments showed that the effect of touch on CFS disappeared\nwhen we introduced a small mismatch in visuo-haptic orientation (\u00fe15) and a small difference\n(less than one octave) in visuo-haptic spatial frequency. This indicates that the interaction\nbetween touch and vision is specific and tightly tuned for these two basic visual features, a\nresult that is in line with previous visuo-haptic studies of binocular rivalry (Lunghi & Alais,\ncontrast discrimination (van der Groen, van der Burg, Lunghi, & Alais, 2013). It is well known\nthat such a tight selectivity both for orientation and spatial frequency is a unique property of\nneurons in the primary visual cortex (Hubel, Wiesel, & Stryker, 1977; Maffei & Fiorentini, 1973).\nIn the present experiment, the position of the hand was vertically aligned with the haptic stimulus,\nin order to allow a body-referred reference frame for the tactile orientation processing, and a clear\nconsistencywiththevisualreferenceframe.Itishoweverpossiblethatshiftingthehapticreference\nframe by changing the position of the hand to an unnatural one might lead to different results.\nTogether with evidence showing that CFS occurs early in the visual system, so that neural\nactivity (BOLD) of visual stimuli suppressed by CFS is reduced already in the primary visual\ncortex (Yuval-Greenberg & Heeger, 2013), our results strongly suggest that haptic signals can\ninteract with visual signals already at the earliest stages of visual processing in a stimulus-\nselective manner.\n"
