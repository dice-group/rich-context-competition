The long-term interactions between HIV infection, treatment, and CMD remain to be\nelucidated in the African population. The HAALSI cohort was established to investigate the impact of these\ninteractions on CMD morbidity and mortality among middle-aged and older adults.\nMethods: We recruited randomly selected adults aged 40 or older residing in the rural Agincourt sub-district in\nMpumalanga Province. In-person interviews were conducted to collect baseline household and socioeconomic\ndata, self-reported health, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP),\nHbA1c, HIV-status, and point-of-care glucose and lipid levels.\nResults: Five thousand fifty nine persons (46.4% male) were enrolled with a mean age of 61.7 \u00b1 13.06 years. Waist-\noverweight or obese. Blood pressure was similar for men and women with a combined hypertension prevalence of\n58.4% and statistically significant increases were observed with increasing age. High total cholesterol prevalence in\nwomen was twice that observed for men (8.5 vs. 4.1%). The prevalence of self-reported CMD conditions was higher\namong women, except for myocardial infarction, and women had a statistically significantly higher prevalence of\nangina (10.82 vs. 6.97%) using Rose Criteria. The HIV- persons were significantly more likely to have hypertension,\ndiabetes, or be overweight or obese than HIV+ persons. Approximately 56% of the cohort had at least 2 measured\nor self-reported clinical co-morbidities, with HIV+ persons having a consistently lower prevalence of co-morbidities\ncompared to those without HIV. Absolute 10-year risk cardiovascular risk scores ranged from 7.7\u00ad9.7% for women\nand from 12.5\u00ad15.3% for men, depending on the risk score equations used.\n(Continued on next page)\n* Correspondence: tgaziano@partners.org\n1Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Brigham & Women's Hospital, 75\n2Center for Health Decision Science, Harvard T.H.

As a result, chronic diseases,\nincluding cardiometabolic diseases (CMD), have become\na major burden of disease and related mortality in low-\nresource settings, including sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)\ndisease mortality increased steadily [3] in adults 50 years\nand above, due largely to an increase in a number of risk\nfactors such as hypertension, increased smoking preva-\nlence, dietary changes and obesity [5]. These risks factors\nhave been followed by increases in symptomatic cardio-\nvascular conditions such as stroke, ischemic heart dis-\nease and diabetes, for which health policymakers have\nyet to evolve an effective response.\nThese trends are prominent despite the pervasive ef-\nfects of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired im-\nmune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Further, it is\nincreasingly recognized that human populations in sub-\nSaharan Africa, but especially in South Africa, in spite of\na previous profound drop in life expectancy, are now\naging rapidly. This demographic transition is the result of\nfalling mortality rates, due in part to widespread uptake of\nanti-retroviral therapy (ART), coupled with marked de-\ncreases in fertility in recent decades [1, 6, 7]. National\nleaders, health and social systems, and the accompanying\npolicy processes--still contending with an \"unfinished\nagenda\" of widespread infection and excess maternal,\ninfant and childhood illness--are poorly prepared for\nthe scale and speed of the demographic change that\nis underway [8].\nThe transition is complex, with a non-linear trajectory,\nreflected in the `collision' between non-communicable\nand infectious disease [9]. Widespread uptake of ART\nfor HIV has led to a profound improvement in mortality\ntrends at all ages [10]. While ART extends the lifespan of\npeople living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), it does not come\nwithout costs. Compared to PLWHA who were not on\nART, those on ART have been shown to have an increased\nprevalence of dyslipidemia [6, 11, 12]. Biomarkers for in-\nflammation, e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP), have also been\nidentified as potential useful markers for assessing in-\ncreased risk of CMD in HIV-infected persons, though the\nevidence is mixed [7, 13\u00ad15]. The long-term effect of the\ncomplex interaction between epidemic infectious disease\nand CMD in these environments is simply not known and\nwill require prospective follow-up of population-based co-\nhorts to answer this question.\nThe shifting factors that have led to the increase in\nCMD in South Africa are certainly exerting pressure to\nact, but public sector policymakers and programmers\nface a critical barrier: a lack of population-based data\nwith which to understand the multiple effects and deter-\nminants of the ongoing transition, specifically with regard\nto CMD. In 2015 as part of the Health and Aging in\nAfrica: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community\n(HAALSI) in South Africa, we completed the baseline\nwave of data collection in a cohort of 5,059 men and\nwomen 40 years of age drawn from the Agincourt Health\nand socio-Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) which\ncovers the Agincourt sub-district of Mpumalanga Province\nin a border region of rural South Africa adjacent to south-\nern Mozambique [16]. The overall objective of HAALSI\nwith regard to CMD is to understand the major forces\nshaping the trajectory of the prevalence, incidence, and risk\nfactors of CMD in this cohort of 5,059 individuals. In this\nparticular study, we sought to assess the prevalence of\nCMD risk factors and symptomatic CMDs and to measure\nthe 10-year CMD risk in a large rural South African popu-\nlation. Second, we sought to compare these variables across\ngenders and HIV status.\nMethods\nThe HAALSI study is based in the Agincourt HDSS site,\na sub-district of rural Mpumalanga Province comprising\nupdate, conducted by experienced local field staff, pro-\nvides up-to-date denominator data on the full population\nwith systematic recording of all vital events (deaths, births,\nin- / out-migrations).\nEligibility\nwho had permanently resided in the Agincourt sub-\ndistrict of Mpumalanga Province for at least one year\nprior to the 2013 census update, were eligible.\nSampling and sample size\nA total of 6,281 persons were selected for recruitment. To\nmaximize the linkages with previous HIV and NCD studies\nin Agincourt, those who participated in earlier studies and\nmet the eligibility criteria were selected with 100 percent\nprobability. The remainder of the sample was selected ran-\ndomly from the 2013 census HDSS database, stratifying on\nsex in order to achieve equal numbers of women and men.\nRecruitment\nPrior to the survey, the HAALSI study was introduced to\ncommunity members across the study villages, and dis-\ncussed in-depth with a representative Community Advisory\nGroup. This facilitated community review of study objec-\ntives and contributed to the effective response achieved.\nThe entire population identifies itself as \"African\".\nlected individuals were visited at home by a supervised\nlocal field worker who briefly described the study in the\nlocal language (Shangaan), and requested permission to\nexplain the relevant informed consent forms. A signed\nconsent form was obtained from those who agreed to\nparticipate. Field workers also signed and dated the in-\nformed consent form.\nData collection\nInterviews lasting 2\u00ad3 hours were conducted at partici-\npants' households. The visit included a questionnaire in\ntwo parts: household and socioeconomic data then indi-\nvidual interview data, which included anthropometric,\nphysical and cognitive function assessments plus blood\nsample collection in the form of a capillary blood sample\nor \"dried blood spots\" (DBS). Data were captured on\nlaptop computers using a Computer Assisted Personal\nInterview (CAPI) program. All self-reported conditions\nwere captured using the question \"Have you ever been\ntold by a doctor, nurse, or other healthcare worker that\nyou have (condition)?\" Physical data collected included\nblood pressure (Omron M6W\u00ae automated cuff), weight\n(Genesis Growth Management Electronic Scale\u00ae); height\nusing a height sensor with infrared measurement; waist\nand hip circumferences with a flexible tape measure\n(SECA\u00ae). The DBS were analyzed for high-sensitivity\nC-reactive protein (hsCRP), HIV-status, viral load, nu-\ncleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors among the\nHIV+ (1\u00ad3 drops), and presence of the anti-retroviral\ndrugs (ART) emtricitabine or lamivudine for persons\nwith a positive HIV antibody test. The Division of\nClinical Pharmacology Laboratory at the University of\nCape Town (UCT), South Africa performed the test-\ning for the presence of ART. Additional blood sam-\nples were used in point-of-care machines to measure\nglucose (Caresens\u00a9 N Monitor), and individual lipid levels\n(Cardiochek\u00a9 PA Silver version. Three blood pressure\nreadings (systolic and diastolic) were obtained with 2 mi-\nnutes between each reading.\nAssessment of CVD risk factors and HIV status and\ndiagnosis of CMDs\nAge stratification follows the South African National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES)\ncategorization [17].

The mean blood pressure was calculated using the\naverage between the second and third readings [20].\nHypertension was defined as a mean systolic blood pres-\nsure 140 mmHg or mean diastolic blood pressure \n90 mmHg or controlled blood pressure with self-reported\nuse of taking hypertensive medication [21]. Diabetes was\ndefined as a self-reported history, or a fasting blood glu-\ncose level (FBG)  7.0 mmol/L, or a random blood glucose\nlevel (RBG)  11.1 mmol/L or reported use of medication\n[22]. A FBG required no caloric intake for at least 8 hours\nprior to the collection of the blood sample. Dyslipidemia\nwas defined as a self-reported history, or measured total\ncholesterol level  6.21 mmol/L, or low-density lipoprotein\n(LDL) > 4.1 mmol/L, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) <\nThe hsCRP was categorized as low (<1 mg/L), inter-\nlute risk of suffering a cardiac-related event or death\n(CVD risk) over ten years following the baseline inter-\nview was calculated using Pooled Risk Score Equations\n(ASCVD) [27] and Framingham Score [28], while risk of\nCVD death was calculated using the Harvard Risk Score\n[29]. These three risk scores use different combinations\nof age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure,\nreported diabetes, and either cholesterol values or\nbody-mass index to predict risk. Angina was defined\nas self-report, or using a validated subset of questions\nfrom the Rose Angina Questionnaire relating to chest\npain, exertion, and symptom resolution [30\u00ad32]. Self-\nreported current medication use for hypertension, dia-\nbetes, and dyslipidemia was also obtained during the\ninterview. For prevalence of HIV we used the blood\nresults from a protocol of sequential assays. Specific-\nally, the Vironostika Uniform 11 (Biomeriuex, France)\nscreening assay was used to detect the presence of\nthe virus; and in samples that tested positive, the\nRoche Elecys (USA) assay (confirmatory) was used to\ndetermine the viral load on DBS. Contradictory re-\nsults were resolved using the Siemens Centaur XP\n(USA) immunoassay, in accordance with World Health\nOrganization (WHO) guidelines [33, 34]. HIV+ persons\nwho tested positive for the presence of ART medica-\ntions were deemed compliant with ARV treatment.\nAll analyses were conducted using SAS \u00ae V9.4 and\nSTATA \u00ae V14 software.\nResults\nGeneral population\nOut of the 5,890 persons identified for recruitment who\nagreed to be interviewed, 7.3% refused to participate,\n6.0% could not be located, and 0.8% were unable to par-\nticipate.

Over\na period of ten years, the Harvard Risk Score predicted a\nmean absolute risk of cardiovascular death at 11.3% for\nthe entire cohort, while the Framingham score predicted\na 12.2% risk for CMD and related mortality, compared\nto a risk of 9.9% for CMD and related mortality using\nthe ASCVD risk score\nHIV status\nEvaluation of CMD risk factors by HIV status revealed\nan increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

Additionally, HIV+ males had a significantly\nhigher prevalence of underweight (p = 0.007) compared to\ntheir HIV- counterparts (Table 6) and higher hsCRP levels\nthose without HIV-infection had consistently higher pro-\nportions of multiple CMD co-morbidities, compared to\nTable 2 Prevalence (%) of risk factors, by sex and age group\nALL Male Female\nTotal\nMale\ntrend (Male)\nTotal\nFemale\n(Female)\np-value\n(Overall Men\nvs women)\nReports diabetes\nmedication use\nHigh Total Cholesterol \nHypertriglyceridemia >\nObese Grade II:\nhsCRP Risk Category [25]\naSystolic Blood Pressure  140 mmHg or Diastolic Blood Pressure  90 mmHg or Self-reported use of medication.\nbSelf-report or Random Blood Glucose (RBG)  11.1 mmol/L or Self-reported use of medication.\ncTotal cholesterol  6.21 mmol/L or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) > 4.1 mmol/L or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) < 1.19 mmol/L or Triglycerides > 2.25 mmol/L or\nSelf-reported use of medication (n = 8).\n*Statistically significant at  = 0.05\ntheir HIV+ counterparts. For example, nearly 35% of HIV+\npersons had 2 or more conditions compared to nearly\n51% among HIV- persons (Table 7). Women also had a\nconsistently higher prevalence than men across all cat-\negories, regardless of HIV-infection status (Table 7). When\nincluding HIV-infection as a co-morbid condition, overall,\nCMD conditions (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia,\nof multiple co-morbidities also generally increased with\nage, as expected (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nOur baseline findings from the HAALSI study indicate\nthat CMD risk is high in this rural, middle-aged and\nolder South African cohort and indeed, when coupled\nwith the high prevalence of HIV, it is evident the popula-\ntion is experiencing a complex epidemiologic transition\ncharacterized, in part, by an intense and interacting\ndouble burden of cardiometabolic and infectious disease.\nThe cohort is at increased risk for CMD based on the\ndistribution of traditional risk factors some of which fall\nat, or beyond, the upper limit for the rural or provincial\nprevalence reported for the province in a nationally rep-\nresentative sample [17]. Approximately 80% of both men\nand women had hsCRP levels in the intermediate to high\nrange which likely reflects elevated systemic inflammation\n(Table 2). While this could involve a number of factors,\nthe high level of overweight and obesity recorded suggests\nthat body fat distribution may be a key influence. The in-\ncrease in hsCRP needs further evaluation to assess the\nmagnitude of risk and to determine if it serves as a greater\nThe prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and obesity\nare greater among women than men, however women\nhad lower rates of low HDL-levels and smoking. The\ngreater obesity in women is consistent with other studies\nin South Africa and the region [17, 36]. Smoking rates\noverall are relatively low and men report current smok-\ning at almost 23 times the rate of women. Despite this\ndisparity between genders, smoking is likely under re-\nported for both groups as the SANHANES Study reports\ning daily. While the overall lipid profiles for the cohort\nwere comparable to participants in the SANHANES\nStudy [17], men and women in HAALSI had higher\nHDL levels than those measured for SANHANES partici-\npants older than 35. Still, the increased risk of CVD due\nto abnormal HDL levels continues to be of concern in this\npredominantly Black population since the SANHANES\nsample measured the highest levels of abnormal HDL in\nrural populations, with 1 out of 2 black men and women\naged 15\u00ad65 having this risk factor. The WHR of women\nin our cohort was also higher (0.89 vs. 0.85), as it was for\nAdditionally, the burden of HIV-infection adds to the\nprevalence of those with significant and multiple co-\nmorbidities, corroborating findings from a previous study\nin the Agincourt population where more than 50% had at\nleast one chronic condition (CVD or HIV). In that study,\nCMD risk factors increased with age except for low levels\nof HDL [14]. The biggest drivers of CMD in the present\ncohort are abdominal obesity and hypertension, and also\ndyslipidemia and smoking for men.

In this cohort we observed\nthat the dyslipidemia prevalence is similar amongst HIV+\nand HIV- persons, which is likely due to the higher preva-\nlence of obesity in the former population.\nThe prevalence of hypertension in the overall cohort is\nat the high end of the observed range in the SANHANES\nsample which may be explained, at least in part, by the\nhigh obesity levels. The impact of HIV-infection on the\noverall prevalence however has competing influences.\nHIV+ status has been associated with lower BMI in many\nTable 5 10-year CVD risk score comparisons by sex and age groupa\nAge Number (N) Harvard Risk Score [29] (%) Pooled Cohort Risk Equations\nWOMEN\nMEN\nTOTAL\nTable 6 Prevalence (%) of risk factors by HIV status\nMale Female\np-value HIV-\np-value\nNote: HIV status is defined as self-report or positive on assay analysis.\naHypertension defined as SBP > 140 mmHg or DBP > 90 mmHg or Reports currents use of anti-hypertensive medication;\nbDiabetes defined as Self-Report or Fasting Blood Glucose >7.0 mmol/L or Random Blood Glucose > 11.1 mmol/L;\ncDyslipidemia defined as elevated total cholesterol (>6.21 mmol/L) or high LDL (>4.1 mmol/L) or Low HDL (<1.19 mmol/L) or Hypertriglyceridemia (>2.25 mmol/L);\n* Statistically significant at  = 0.05\nAfrican populations [38], which can lower blood pressure.\nIn contrast high levels of inflammation in the general\nageing population has been shown to be associated with\nincreases in blood pressure [39]. It is unclear what the\ncontribution of elevated hsCRP is towards developing\nhypertension in this HIV+ population with varying levels\nof ART. The overall risk of future co-morbid and fatal\nevents appears to be considerable in this population.\nFollow-up mortality and cause-of-death data on cohort\nparticipants, derived from the HDSS, will allow us to de-\nfine more sharply the upcoming CMD burden and associ-\nated mortality expected in this cohort and, indeed,\nthroughout much of rural South Africa where a similar\nrisk and morbidity profile pertains [17].\nThis initial study serves as a valuable assessment of\nCMD conditions in this rural aging population where\nthe prevalence of many of the conditions was found to\nbe quite high. More importantly, it sets up a baseline to\ncompare in the ensuing planned longitudinal follow-up.\nIn the follow-up study, we will be able to evaluate the\nrate of change of the CMD conditions in this population.\nWhile the younger age of the HIV+ cohort may explain\nsome of the lower prevalence of CMD conditions, other\nfactors such as increasing use of ART may change this.\nWe also will be able to assess the impact of treatment of\nHIV-infection on the change in prevalence of CMD\nconditions, and improved or diminished access to\ncare. Further we plan to specifically focus on the im-\npact of inflammatory markers on the progression of\nvascular disease. Finally, we will be able to look at\nthe impact of changes in migratory status on health\nand health system seeking behaviors. Further analyses\nwill include evaluating electrocardiograms and echo-\ncardiograms to see if there is confirmatory evidence\nof underreporting of CMD conditions.\nStrengths\nEarlier findings show that temporary (largely labor) mi-\ngrants returning to Agincourt after periods in towns carry\na higher risk of death from noncommunicable diseases\n(NCDs), thus identifying the internal migrants as a risk\ngroup warranting further investigation [40, 41]. A major\nstrength of this study is that the Agincourt HDSS is well\nprepared to undertake follow-up of residents in the\ncatchment area of the study, and also to track in-\nternal migrants who move temporarily or permanently\nout of the sub-district. The large sample size, the\nwide range of cardiovascular disease-related variables\ncollected, and the collection of biological samples are\nall added strengths.\nLimitations\nThis data has limitations associated with all cross-sectional\nassessments, limiting the extent to which causal inferences\ncan be made. The use of point-of-care (POC) testing for\nlipid and glucose levels is also a potential limitation, when\ncompared to measurements obtained through conven-\ntional laboratory testing. However, the machines used to\nobtain POC testing have been validated against current\nConclusions\nThis cohort is experiencing an increased risk of CMD with\nage, as expected. Further, it appears that the HIV+ popula-\ntion has many of the chronic CMD risk factors to contend\nwith as well. With the increase in co-morbidities associ-\nated with HIV-infection, their longer-term impact on\nscreening, prevention, and treatment of CMD needs to be\nbetter understood. Indeed, the health system challenges\nposed by the evolving chronic disease trajectories are pro-\nfound with little precedent elsewhere.\nThe establishment of the HAALSI cohort is timely in\norder to assess the evolution of long-term CMD risks in\na rural population that is living longer with HIV (and is\nthus exposed to prolonged antiretroviral therapy); and to\ninform the many parts of South and sub-Saharan Africa\nconfronting similar realities.
