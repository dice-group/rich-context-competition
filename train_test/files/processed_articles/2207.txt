In an era of increasing health\ncare costs [1], chronic disease stands out as a major\ncontributor [2] with alcohol and drug use disorders\nplaying an exacerbating role [3-5]. To improve popula-\ntion health and reduce U.S. health care costs, particular\nattention must be paid to the role of chronic diseases,\nincluding medical, psychiatric, and substance use\ndisorders.\nSubstance use disorders (SUDs) are prevalent in about\n9% of the U.S. population, but only 10% of those indivi-\nduals access addiction treatment [6]. Although medical\nneeds were not explicitly mentioned in this household\n* Correspondence: reif@brandeis.edu\n1Institute for Behavioral Health, Heller School for Social Policy and\nManagement, Brandeis University, 415 South Street, MS035, Waltham, MA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nReif et al.

Interference from pressing medical condi-\ntions may thus contribute to perceived unimportance of\naddiction treatment among the 94% of people [6]\ndeemed in need but who reported they did not need it.\nTo enhance care of both chronic medical diseases and\naddiction, it is important to better understand their\nrelationships.\nMore than 40% of the U.S. population is estimated to\nhave at least one chronic medical disease [2,7], with pre-\nvalence higher for women and increasing dramatically\nwith age [7]. Chronic medical disease is related to 70%\nof all U.S. deaths [2], and accounts for more than 75%\nof health care costs [2] and high out of pocket health\ncare spending [7]. Diabetes, hypertension, and high cho-\nlesterol comprise nearly a third of all chronic conditions\n[7], and just seven conditions account for about one-\nfourth of annual outpatient visits and hospital discharges\nChronic disease may have unexpected consequences\non healthcare utilization, potentially reducing treatment\nof unrelated disorders, perhaps due to less time avail-\nable, complexity of navigating multiple problems at\nonce, or a preference to focus on the most troublesome\nproblem [9]. In practice, however, perhaps due to more\nfrequent interaction with medical providers, mental dis-\norders are more often detected among patients with\nchronic medical diseases than among other patients\n[10]. Physician awareness of a substance abuse problem\nalso is more likely when the person has episodic or\nchronic medical illness, however SUDs remain undiag-\nnosed by primary care physicians in nearly half of\npatients seeking addiction treatment [11].\nIt is well documented that SUDs cause or exacerbate\ncertain medical conditions and increase their costs\n[3,12-16]. Incidence for many chronic medical diseases,\nincluding hypertension, diabetes, asthma, chronic liver\ndisease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),\npain, and stroke is elevated, and for some disorders\nmore than doubled, among people with SUDs [17-20].\nMany more conditions are worsened by, have their man-\nagement impaired by, or are attributable to SUDs [21].\nChronic conditions are prevalent even in younger indivi-\nduals with SUDs [22]. These findings highlight the\nimportance of medical management as an essential ele-\nment of addiction treatment [23] particularly in early\nSeveral examples of this complex interplay are\nreported in the literature. Alcohol use disorders\nincreased medical illness complexity in a primary care\npopulation, even after controlling for medical morbidity,\ninitial primary care utilization, and current medical care\nutilization [25]. Alcohol use disorders also were related\nto inconsistent attendance and less complex services for\nthe chronic medical disease, suggesting that medical\ncare may be less accessible for the comorbid population,\nwho may require an increased focus on the complexities\nof care [26]. Among patients receiving diabetes care in\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, those who also had\nSUDs or mental illness had more diabetes complications\n[27]. Although SUDs have been linked to higher utiliza-\ntion of primary, specialty, and emergency medical ser-\nvices [25], there are few studies of how presence of\ncomplex medical disorders affects addiction treatment\nutilization.\nChronic medical diseases require regular and longitu-\ndinal care and self-management for effective treatment\n[28-30]. When chronic diseases include SUDs, care and\ntreatment of both the medical and addiction disorders\nmay affect access to care and the ability to focus on\nboth conditions. An integrated approach could lead to\neffective treatment for all conditions [29], yet little is\nknown about how chronic medical disease affects addic-\ntion treatment utilization. Chronic disease could cause\nfunctional limitations that interfere with an individual's\nability to access addiction treatment, or alternatively\ncould increase interaction with the health care system\nand perhaps addiction treatment. Involvement in addic-\ntion treatment could lead to linkage with medical care\nand effective attention to a chronic medical problem.\nThe objective of this paper is to evaluate the association\nbetween the presence of chronic medical disease and\nrecent addiction treatment utilization among adults with\nsubstance dependence.\nMethods\nData Source and Sample\nData are from baseline interviews with 563 alcohol and/\nor drug-dependent adults enrolled in the AHEAD\n(Addiction Health Evaluation And Disease management)\nstudy, a randomized controlled trial testing the effective-\nness of a chronic disease management program for sub-\nstance dependence in primary care.\nStudy recruitment occurred from a free-standing inpa-\ntient detoxification unit (74% of enrolled subjects), pri-\nmary care clinics and the emergency department in the\nurban medical center where the study was located (10%)\nand the community by advertising on buses and in\nnewspapers (16%); subjects were recruited between Sep-\nAdults were eligible if they had (1) a diagnosis of cur-\nrent alcohol or drug dependence as assessed by the\nComposite International Diagnostic Interview Short\nForm (CIDI-SF) [31]; (2) past 30 day drug use or heavy\nalcohol use (defined as 4 standard drinks for women,\nReif et al.

Subjects were excluded if they could not provide\ncontact information for tracking purposes; were not flu-\nent in English or Spanish; had specific plans to leave the\narea that would preclude in-person research assess-\nments; were pregnant; or had a Mini-Mental State\nTrained research associates administered the standar-\ndized baseline research assessment and assured confi-\ndentiality. Data collected include sociodemographics,\nsubstance use and related problems, anxiety, depression,\nhealth questions, and medical and addiction service use.\nSubjects were compensated for their study participation\nafter completing baseline study procedures.\nThe Institutional Review Board approved the study.\nAdditional privacy protection was secured by a Certifi-\ncate of Confidentiality issued by the Department of\nHealth and Human Services.\nChronic Disease and Other Medical Condition Measures\nSubjects were asked if a doctor had ever told them they\nhad any of a series of medical conditions. A number of\nthese conditions were included on a chronic disease\ncomorbidity questionnaire validated by Katz et al. [33],\nwhich is a self-report version of the medical record-\nbased Charlson Comorbidity Index [34]. The Katz ques-\ntionnaire includes myocardial infarction, congestive\nheart failure, peripheral vascular, stroke or other cere-\nbrovascular disease, COPD, ulcer disease, diabetes,\nrenal, connective tissue disease, and other conditions\n(dementia, liver disease, leukemia, lymphoma, cancer,\nAIDS). Scoring replicates the Charlson Comorbidity\nIndex, which empirically weighted severity by disease (e.\ng., cerebrovascular = 1, moderate or severe renal disease\n= 2, AIDS or metastatic solid tumor = 6), based on 1-\nyear adjusted relative risk for mortality [34]. The comor-\nbidity score is the weighted sum of the specified\nconditions.\nThe main independent variable, chronic disease status,\nis a 3-category variable which classified comorbidity\nscores as: none; only one condition of lowest severity\n(Katz = 1); or, more than one condition of lowest sever-\nity or one or more condition(s) of higher severity (Katz\n> 1). Asthma was considered in separate secondary ana-\nlyses, as an example of a specific symptomatic condition,\nselected due to its high prevalence in the sample; it is\nalso included in the Katz questionnaire, as part of\nCOPD, with a weight of 1. Asthma is a common comor-\nbidity among urban young to middle-age adults, reflect-\ning the age range common for addiction, whereas other\ncommon chronic diseases such as heart disease are less\ncommon in young populations. Two other common\nchronic conditions in this population, hepatitis and\nhypertension, were prevalent but are often asymptomatic\nto the patient, and thus were not evaluated in the cur-\nrent analyses.\nAdditional secondary independent variables were used\nto evaluate whether broader health status significantly\npredicted addiction treatment utilization: the single item\nself-report health status from the SF-12 [35] (excellent/\nvery good/good, fair/poor) and physical health-related\nfunctioning and quality of life as determined by the SF-\nscale).\nAddiction Treatment Utilization Measures\nThe primary outcome was any addiction treatment\nbased on self-report, defined as any treatment for addic-\ntion (excluding detoxification) in the 3 months prior to\nstudy enrollment in any of the following: residential pro-\ngram for alcohol or drug treatment; outpatient full-day/\npartial hospital program; outpatient with a psychiatrist,\nother doctor, or other healthcare professional (e.g.,\ncounselor); or by taking medication to prevent drinking\nor drug use. Two secondary outcomes were the counts\nof outpatient addiction treatment days (at a full-day/par-\ntial hospital or with a psychiatrist, other doctor, or other\nhealthcare professional including counselors) and nights\nin a residential program for alcohol or other drug treat-\nment in the prior 3 months based on self-report at the\nbaseline assessment. These measures were adapted from\nthe COMBINE study Form 90 [36]. Self-report is known\nto be a reliable way of obtaining treatment utilization\ninformation among people with substance use disorders\nCovariates\nDemographic variables included age, gender, and race/\nethnicity. Current type of substance dependence is a 3-\ncategory variable indicating either alcohol dependence\nwith heavy alcohol use in the past 30 days, any drug\ndependence with drug use in the past 30 days, or both.\nAlcohol and drug dependence were determined using\nthe CIDI-SF alcohol and drug modules [31]; heavy alco-\nhol use in the past month was indicated by 4 or more\ndrinks per day or 15 or more drinks per average week\nfor women, and 5 or more drinks per day or 22 or more\ndrinks per week for men. The regression models\nincluded other variables that may affect addiction treat-\nment utilization: recruitment from a detoxification pro-\ngram (versus from medical care or the community),\ncriminal justice involvement (any arrest, probation, par-\nole, pretrial release, diversion program or incarceration\nin the past 3 months), homeless (any time living in a\nshelter or on the streets in the past 3 months),\nReif et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2011, 6:28\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/6/1/28\nunemployed (usual pattern past 3 months), having\nhealth insurance (including Medicaid), current smoker,\nand anxiety in the past week (Beck Anxiety Index [39]\nhigher).\nStatistical Methods\nSecondary data analysis of the AHEAD study baseline\ndata was conducted. Descriptive statistics were obtained\nand Spearman correlations were used to evaluate poten-\ntial collinearity between independent variables and cov-\nariates. No pair of variables included in the same\nregression model was highly correlated (r > 0.40). Multi-\nvariate regression models were used to evaluate the\neffect of presence of chronic disease on addiction treat-\nment utilization, adjusting for covariates defined above.\nThe primary outcome of any addiction treatment was\nmodeled using logistic regression, with odds ratios and\n95% confidence intervals calculated. The distributions\nfor outpatient addiction treatment days and residential\nnights, which are count variables, were skewed with\nmany zeros and long tails, thus models assuming nor-\nmality were inappropriate and overdispersed Poisson\nregression models were used [40]. The Pearson chi-\nsquare correction was used to account for overdisper-\nsion. The magnitudes of association between measures\nof chronic disease and utilization were quantified for the\nPoisson models using incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with\n95% confidence intervals. IRR is interpreted as the ratio\nof the number of outpatient days (or residential nights)\nfor the exposed group of interest (e.g., any chronic dis-\nease) versus the reference group (no chronic disease).\nThe null value of no association for the IRR is equal to\n1. An IRR >1 indicates that chronic disease is associated\nwith more treatment utilization.\nMultivariate models were fit separately for each\ndependent variable (any addiction treatment, outpatient\ndays, and residential nights) and for each key indepen-\ndent variable (chronic disease, asthma, health status, and\nPCS). The primary analyses using the Katz score\nincluded 498 subjects with complete data on outcomes,\nthe main independent variable, and covariates; second-\nary models included the same 498 subjects. Power cal-\nculations assumed that 27% of subjects without chronic\ndisease utilized addiction treatment (based on the\nobserved data), giving our study approximately 80%\npower to detect an odds ratio as small as 1.9 for those\nwith one chronic disease of lowest severity and an odds\nratio as small as 2.1 for those with one chronic disease\nof higher severity or multiple chronic diseases. Thus,\npower was sufficient for effects that were clinically\nmeaningful. All analyses were conducted using two-\nsided tests and a significance level of 0.05, using SAS\nsoftware (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nResults\nBaseline Characteristics\neligible, and 563 subjects were enrolled. Enrolled sub-\njects were similar to unenrolled subjects in terms of\ngender, age and race/ethnicity.

Nor was addic-\ntion treatment associated with asthma or physical func-\ntion and quality of life. These findings held for any\naddiction treatment and for quantity of treatment ser-\nvices received. Only perceived health status, which is a\nsubjective measure, was associated with less addiction\ntreatment utilization. It is encouraging to note that\nchronic disease itself may not be a barrier to addiction\ntreatment.\nOn the other hand, it also appears that chronic medi-\ncal disease did not increase addiction treatment partici-\npation in this cohort. People with chronic disease are\noften connected to the medical treatment system, but\nthe acute focus of episodic care may not extend to pro-\nviding assistance or motivation for these patients to\naccess addiction treatment. This may be a missed\nopportunity for medical providers to encourage their\npatients to seek addiction treatment given that the self-\nreported perception of health status was frequently only\nfair or poor. The lack of a significant positive association\nbetween chronic disease and addiction treatment utiliza-\ntion suggests that facilitated access to addiction care is\nnot routinely occurring. Such \"reachable moments\" [41]\nfor the individual with both chronic disease and addic-\ntion are perhaps most likely when formalized linkages\nbetween primary care and addiction treatment exist or if\nthe primary care doctor is willing to address addiction\nwith the patient [18,42]. One way to increase these\nreachable moments is to encourage screening, brief\nintervention, and referral to treatment approaches in the\nprimary care setting. Opportunities for referral to addic-\ntion treatment should increase as the number of medical\nvisits increases. An integrated, longitudinal approach to\nmanaging both chronic medical disease and substance\nIt is worthwhile to note that no chronic diseases were\nreported by two thirds of this sample of substance\ndependent individuals, somewhat better than an esti-\nmate of 53% with no chronic conditions in a compar-\nable population 10 years earlier [22]. The lower estimate\nhere may be due to recruitment beyond detoxification\nsettings; subjects recruited from the community may be\nless medically ill than those in detoxification facilities.\nMost of the chronic diseases noted here had prevalence\nwithin the range of national and state estimates [45,46].\nThe asthma prevalence here appears slightly higher than\nthe state average, but this likely reflects the higher rates\noften found in inner city and African-American popula-\ntions [47] and the high prevalence of current smoking\nin this sample. The below average Physical Comorbidity\nScore in this population is comparable to similar popu-\nAlthough we did not detect an association between\nchronic medical variables and treatment utilization,\nseveral other variables were significantly related to treat-\nment utilization, including several sociodemographic\nvariables. Health insurance was positively associated\nwith any addiction treatment utilization, demonstrating\nan expected increase in access to treatment, but did not\nreach significance for the count variables. Recruitment\nfrom detoxification was negatively associated with out-\npatient days, highlighting the severity of addiction treat-\nment needs for this group, and the expected lack of\ntreatment preceding detoxification entry. Psychiatric\ncomorbidity (e.g., anxiety) was positively associated with\naddiction treatment utilization reflecting other findings\nin the literature [49], although this past-week measure\nwas collected for most individuals soon after detoxifica-\ntion, so may reflect short-term anxiety symptoms rather\nthan a chronic disorder.\nThe lack of findings concerning our primary hypoth-\nesis may simply be the reflection of a complex relation-\nship between chronic disease and addiction, with many\ncompeting forces. Several opposing effects from chronic\ndisease may have occurred, which could collectively\nshow little or no effect on addiction treatment utiliza-\ntion. First, individuals with chronic disease may be func-\ntionally less able to access and participate in addiction\ntreatment, reducing the likelihood of treatment utiliza-\ntion. If physical function were an important barrier, we\nshould have seen some effect from the PCS, which did\nnot occur, but it might be important to consider specific\nfunctional limitations. By considering asthma separately,\nthus removing the variability across conditions, we\nmight have highlighted the functional effects, but that\nalso did not occur. It is also possible that the severity of\naddiction, as indicated by most individuals in the sample\nrecruited from detoxification, overshadowed any func-\ntional limitations as they sought treatment; a desire to\nfocus on the most pressing problem has been high-\nlighted in some literature [9]. Second, for a variety of\nreasons, addiction treatment facilities may be less likely\nto accept individuals with medical conditions, who may\nrequire medications or have more acute medical needs.\nThis study could not address that question. Third,\nchronic disease may interfere with the quality of treat-\nment participation; number of visits could be construed\nas a proxy for this, but if chronic disease affects self-\ncare management this issue may go beyond what could\nbe considered here. Fourth, 3 months is a relatively\nshort time period, so may have masked any differences\nthat would appear with longer history of treatment utili-\nzation. However, the focus here is on relative differences\nin utilization, so the 3 month period should have been\nsufficient to compare groups. Fifth, and alternatively,\nindividuals with chronic disease may be more likely to\naccess treatment due to their likely existing linkages\nwith the healthcare system. A study of women with\nReif et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2011, 6:28\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/6/1/28\ntrauma and mental or substance use disorders found\nthat greater disability was associated with more outpati-\nent counseling, but not residential, group counseling or\npeer treatment [50]. While referral from the healthcare\nsystem is not a common pathway to addiction treatment\n[51] the finding that physicians are more likely to know\nabout substance abuse if the patient has an episodic or\nchronic medical condition [11] suggests that this path-\nway may be more likely for these patients.\nThe characteristics of the study sample may have tem-\npered the potential relationships between chronic dis-\nease and addiction treatment utilization. In a relatively\nyoung sample such as this, chronic disease is less likely,\nand related problems are likely to be less severe than in\nan older population. However, addiction itself may\nincrease such problems even in a young sample [22].\nThe subjects in this study are largely reflective of indivi-\nduals in addiction treatment, and these results should\napply to similar cohorts. Relatively few individuals in\nthis sample had severe chronic disease or multiple con-\nditions, thus findings may be different in an analysis of\nonly individuals with chronic disease. The implications\nof recruiting much of the sample during a detoxification\nstay should be considered, where individuals entering\ndetoxification may be unlikely to have been in addiction\ntreatment during a period of substance use severe\nenough to warrant detoxification. These findings also\nrepresent a sample from a single site, so may be less\ngeneralizable than recruitment from multiple sites.\nA limitation is that the study may have been inade-\nquately powered to detect differences of the observed\nmagnitude. Power calculations estimated 80% power to\ndetect an odds ratio as small as 2.1 for those with higher\nseverity chronic disease, thus it is likely that the study\nwas not adequately powered to detect the small\nobserved magnitude of association of 1.3 (for higher\nseverity). However, since the observed degree of associa-\ntion may still be clinically meaningful, the possibility\nthat individuals with higher comorbidity are more likely\nto utilize addiction treatment should be further studied\nin a larger sample to see if a small but clinically impor-\ntant effect is detectable. But the effect of greater con-\ncern, interference with receiving addiction treatment\ndue to a chronic disease, is unlikely based on our find-\nings. Last, the current analysis relied on retrospective\ndata from a sample of individuals, most of whom had\nrecently completed detoxification. A prospective or qua-\nlitative study would be better able to track the likely\ncausal issues related to chronic disease and addiction\ntreatment access.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the role\nof chronic disease in addiction treatment utilization.\nCurrent household studies on barriers to addiction\ntreatment, such as SAMHSA's National Survey on Drug\nUse and Health (NSDUH), do not consider medical\ncomorbidities, so are unable to shed light on these\nunderlying questions. Further research in this area is\nwarranted to better understand these complex issues.\nThe individuals in this study were, by definition, willing\nto receive health care. Other populations may differ.\nAlso, samples with a large number of individuals with\nchronic disease would allow a focus on more specific\nchronic diseases, such as diabetes or heart disease, and\nwould allow a better consideration of other psychiatric\ncomorbidity. In the meantime, we highlight the conclu-\nsion from these data that chronic disease is not a signifi-\ncant barrier to addiction treatment utilization. While we\nfound no significant association between chronic medi-\ncal disease and addiction treatment utilization, these\nissues are complicated and we suggest prospective and\nqualitative studies to further explore these complexities.\n"
