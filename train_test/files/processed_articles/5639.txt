    "abstract": "Abstract\nHumans perceive shape in two-dimensional shaded images, and turning such an image upside down\ncan result in inversion of the relief of this image. Previous research indicates that this inversion is\ncaused by assumptions related to overhead illumination, global convexity and viewpoint above the\nsurface. In our article, we describe the inverted waves effect, in which turning an image of waves\nupside down changes its relief and also its perceived material properties.\n",

For example, when circular patches\ncontaining a shading gradient, such as that in Figure 1(a), are viewed, the observer perceives\nthe surrounding patches as convex bulges and the central patch as a concave indentation. If\nthe image is turned upside down, as in Figure 1(b), the three-dimensional (3D) interpretation\nof the image changes: the concave areas become convex, and the convex areas become\nconcave. This is a well-known effect (Brewster, 1826; Rittenhouse, 1786; von Fieandt,\n1949) that is related to the visual system's assumption that the light source is above the\nSuch assumptions about the light source are also made when viewing more complex\ngrayscale images such as in Figure 1(c) and (d). Turning Figure 1(c) upside down, as\nshown in Figure 1(d), results in a perception where the convex and concave parts of the\nimage change. However, Reichel and Todd (1990) showed that shading is not necessary for\nthe inversion effect. For example, when Figure 1(e) is turned upside down, as shown in\nFigure 1(f), the image relief changes. The change occurs because the visual system makes\nthe assumption that the image is being viewed from overhead, which means that we perceive\nimages as being backwardly slanted away from us. Because of this, we assume that depth\nincreases with height in the visual field (Reichel and Todd, 1990). Further assumptions were\nCorresponding author:\nJukka Ha\n\u00a8kkinen, Institute of Behavioural Sciences, PO Box 9, 00014 University of Helsinki, Finland.\nEmail: jukka.hakkinen@helsinki.fi\ni-Perception\nipe.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (http://www.\nus.sagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\nFigure 1.

This effect was later confirmed with\nphotorealistic images by Liu and Todd (2004).\nRelated to the previous depth inversion phenomena, in this study, we observed an image\nfor which inversion causes a change not only in the relief but also in the perceived material\nproperties of the image. Figure 2(a) shows a grayscale photograph of waves. When the image\nis turned upside down, in Figure 2(b), the 3D properties of the image change. In other words,\nthe convex parts of the image become concave, and the concave parts become convex.\nInterestingly, the material properties of the surface also change, as the upside-down waves\nnow appear to be completely different. Observations within our research group suggested\nthat some people perceived the inverted image as a rocky surface, whereas others observed it\nas a microscopic image of human tissue. This effect can also be produced by turning one's\nhead upside down, as in other similar demonstrations. To explore the differences between\ninterpretations of upright and inverted images, we conducted an experiment in which\nobservers were asked to describe both images.\nThe experiment was conducted with 67 observers (51 females and 16 males) who were\nstudents at the Institute of Behavioural Sciences, University of Helsinki. The stimuli were\ndisplayed on an Eizo ColorEdge CG241W display with a resolution of 1920 pixels in width\nand 1200 pixels in height. A separate, smaller display was on the table, and it was used for\nshowing the text box used for answering. The viewing distance was 80 cm, and the size of the\nimages was 9.6 \u00c2 7.4 of visual angle. Observers viewed the two images in a randomized\norder and answered the question ``What does this image depict?'' by writing a free answer\nwith a computer keyboard. The presentation time was not limited.\nThe results show that inverting the image changed the viewers' interpretation of the\nsurface material. The leftmost blue bar in Figure 3 shows that all participants recognized\nthe upright image as water. In contrast, there was more variation in the descriptions of the\ninverted image, as shown by the rightmost bars in Figure 3. Most of the participants\n(frequency (f) \u00bc 37 of 67) described the image as a solid material such as rock (f \u00bc 28) or\nas a microscopic image of human tissue (f \u00bc 8). Several participants described the surface as\nwater (f \u00bc 26), but most of these (f \u00bc 19 of 26) described it as rapids, not as waves. There were\nFigure 2. (a) A photograph of waves. (b) Turning the photograph upside down changes both the 3D\nstructure of the scene and the interpretation of its material properties. The upside-down version of the image\nis most commonly described as a ``rocky surface'' or a ``microscopic image of human tissue.''\nHa\n\u00a8kkinen and Gro\nalso four participants who said that the surface could be either water or a solid surface. These\nfour answers were omitted from further analysis.\nMost likely, a number of variables affected the result. First, in one-half of the experimental\ncases, the participants observed the waves image first. This initial exposure might have\nprimed them to interpret the inverted image as water. Second, the foam at the top left part\nof Figure 2(a) is a cue for water that stays invariant in the inverted image (bottom left area of\nFigure 2(b)). Using a stimulus without this additional cue might reduce the number of people\nFigure 3. Frequency of answers belonging to the water or solid categories. Blue bars indicate the frequency\nof water category answers, and black bars indicate the frequency of solid category answers. The leftmost bars\nshow the results for the upright image, and the rightmost bars show the results for the inverted image. The\nnumbers above the bars indicate the frequency of answers. Note that in the inverted image condition, four\nanswers have been removed because the participants indicated both categories.\nFigure 4. (a) A photograph of waves. (b) Turning this photograph upside down does not change the 3D\ninterpretation or the interpretation of the surface material. (Images are in the public domain.)\nwho interpret the inverted image as water. Third, the method of giving free answers increased\nthe variability in the results. The effect needs to be quantified with a more exact methodology.\nThis phenomenon, which we call the inverted waves effect, is probably related to the visual\ncharacteristics of fluids. Paulun, Kawabe, Nishida, & Fleming (2015) noticed that the\nperceived viscosity of fluids varies systematically with the 2D shape statistics of images.\nTheir experimental stimuli consisted of computer simulations of fluid pouring from a\nsource into a reservoir, so the stimulus properties were different from our wave images,\nwhich are interpreted as having specific visual structures (Kung & Richards, 1988). It\nwould be interesting to further investigate what these visual properties are and how they\nare used for fluid categorization in images with waves. We noted that the effect is difficult to\nreproduce with wave images found from Internet searches. An example of this is shown in\nFigure 4(a), which does not change its material properties when turned upside down, as\nshown in Figure 4(b). This suggests that there are specific conditions for the effect, and\nthese need to be defined in further research.\n"
