    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is linked to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)\nand Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2\n) signaling pathways. During\nbrain ischemia/reperfusion, EGFR could be transactivated, which stimulates these intracellular signaling cascades that either\nprotect cells or potentiate cell injury. In the present study, we investigated the activation of EGFR, PI3K/AKT, and Raf/MAPK/\nduring ischemia or reperfusion of the brain using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model. We found that EGFR\nwas phosphorylated and transactivated during both ischemia and reperfusion periods. During ischemia, the activity of PI3K/\nAKT pathway was significantly increased, as judged from the strong phosphorylation of AKT; this activation was suppressed\nby the inhibitors of EGFR and Zn-dependent metalloproteinase. Ischemia, however, did not induce ERK1/2\nphosphorylation,\nwhich was dependent on reperfusion. Coimmunoprecipitation of Son of sevenless 1 (SOS1) with EGFR showed increased\nassociation between the receptor and SOS1 in ischemia, indicating the inhibitory node downstream of SOS1. The inhibitory\nphosphorylation site of Raf-1 at Ser259, but not its stimulatory phosphorylation site at Ser338, was phosphorylated during\nischemia. Furthermore, ischemia prompted the interaction between Raf-1 and AKT, while both the inhibitors of PI3K and\nAKT not only abolished AKT phosphorylation but also restored ERK1/2\nphosphorylation. All these findings suggest that Raf/\nsignal pathway is inhibited by AKT via direct phosphorylation and inhibition at Raf-1 node during ischemia.\nDuring reperfusion, we observed a significant increase of ERK1/2\nphosphorylation but no change in AKT phosphorylation.\nInhibitors of reactive oxygen species and phosphatase and tensin homolog restored AKT phosphorylation but abolished\nphosphorylation, suggesting that the reactive oxygen species-dependent increase in phosphatase and tensin homolog\nactivity in reperfusion period relieves ERK1/2\nfrom inhibition of AKT.\n",

There\nare three Raf isoforms, Raf-1/c-Raf, B-Raf, and A-Raf\n(for review, see Matallanas et al., 2011), of which Raf-1\nhas been extensively studied. Raf-1 has several phosphor-\nylation sites, among which phosphorylation of Ser338 is\nrequired for Raf-1 activation (Mercer and Pritchard,\nbits the MAPK/ERK1/2\net al., 2008). PI3K is a lipid protein kinase functionally\npositioned downstream of Ras. Once activated, PI3K\nconverts membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-\nbisphosphate into phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trispho-\nsphate. This latter anchors AKT to the plasma membrane\nand allows its phosphorylation.\nIn addition to direct stimulation by EGF family mem-\nbers, the EGFR transactivation is operative under vari-\nous conditions. In the process of transactivation, an\nincrease in intracellular Ca2\u00fe concentration ([Ca2\u00fe]i\n)\nor Gq\nprotein-\nor by other stimuli leads to Zn2\u00fe-dependent metallopro-\nteinase-catalyzed shedding of a growth factor of the\nEGFR family (Cai et al., 2011). This agonist stimulates\nEGFRs on the same cell or its neighbor(s) and activates\ntwo major intracellular signaling cascades represented by\nand PI3K/AKT pathways (Gu et al.,\n2007). Cardioprotection of EGFR transactivation has\nbeen extensively studied in ischemic preconditioning by\nexposing the heart to brief cycles of ischemia and reper-\nis also involved in reperfusion-induced arrhythmias (Feng\net al., 2012). In the brain in vivo, hypoxia caused nitric\noxide (NO)-mediated increase of EGFR phosphorylation\nand its activity in cerebral cortex of newborn piglets\n(Mishra et al., 2010). In middle cerebral artery occlusion\n(MCAO) model, EGFR phosphorylation was found in\nthe cortex boundary zone at 3, 7, and 14 days after 1-hr\ntransient ischemia (Yang et al., 2011). Inhibition of\nEGFR with the neutralizing antibody C225 reduced\ninfarct volume and attenuated reactive astrogliosis in\nMCAO model (Yang et al., 2011). The PI3K/AKT path-\nway is believed to mediate cell protection (Murphy and\nSteenbergen, 2008), whereas the functions of MAPK/\npathway are more complex. Transient, moderate\nERK phosphorylation mediates cell protection, for exam-\nple, during ischemic precondition (Murphy and\nSteenbergen, 2008), whereas sustained, extensive ERK\nphosphorylation may induce cell injury (Martin and\nPognonec, 2010). Cell damage in ischemia occurs because\nof ATP depletion that leads to a loss of cellular ionic\nhomeostasis and membrane depolarization, which, in\nturn, increases intracellular Ca2\u00fe concentration and\nmitochondrial depolarization, decreases intracellular\npH, and triggers massive release of glutamate. In clinical\nsettings, only a small part of patients experience complete\nreperfusion, with majority having either partial reperfu-\nsion or no reperfusion at all (see Zhao et al., 2007, and\nreferences thereby). During reperfusion, cells experience\nextensive oxidative damage because restoration of oxygen\nresults in generation of large amount of reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS; Murphy and Steenbergen, 2008). Further\nunderstanding of signaling pathways during ischemia/\nreperfusion could provide detailed information about\nmechanisms underlying cell protection or cell injury.\nConceptually, the PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2\nrepresent two parallel signal pathways. Interactions\nbetween PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2\npathways\nmay occur at several different stages and could be either\npositive or negative. In preliminary experiments, we\nfound that ERK activity was dependent on reperfusion.\nWe hypothesized that the PI3K/AKT signal pathway is\ninvolved in the regulation of ERK activity during ische-\nmia or reperfusion. Therefore, in the following study, we\ninvestigated the activation of EGFR and its two intracel-\nlular signal pathways, MAPK/ERK1/2\nand PI3K/AKT\nduring ischemia or reperfusion in MCAO model.\nMethods and Materials\nAnimals\nwere housed in cages on a 12-hr light/dark cycle in a\ntemperature-controlled (23C\u00ad25C) colony room with\nfree access to food and water. All experiments were car-\nried out in accordance with the USA National Institute of\nHealth Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory\nAnimals, and all experimental protocols were approved\nby the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of\nChina Medical University.\nMiddle Cerebral Artery Occlusion\nFocal brain ischemia was induced unilaterally by occlu-\nsion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCAO) as pre-\nviously described (Longa et al., 1989). Briefly, rats were\nanesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg,\ni.p.), and the right common and external carotid arteries\nwere exposed. A 30-mm segment of 4-0 ethilon monofila-\nment (Ethilon; Johnson & Johnson, Woluwe, Belgium)\nwas gently inserted from the external carotid artery into\nthe internal carotid artery lumen and advanced toward\nthe origin of the middle cerebral artery until a slight\nresistance was felt. The filament had been coated with\npolylysine, and its tip rounded by heating. The rats\nwere killed after 2 hr of MCAO with/without 0.5, 1, or\n2 hr of reperfusion.\n2 ASN Neuro\nIntraventricular injection was performed according to\nthe rat brain atlas by Paxinos and Watson (2007). Rats\nwere anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/\nkg, i.p.) and were placed in the stereotaxic frame. Midline\nincision was made to see the bregma suture. The surgical\nsite was cleaned, and the holes were made by an electric\ndental drill at the right ventricle at 1.0 mm posterior\nto bregma, 1.5 mm lateral from midline. Stainless\nsteel microinjector was stereotaxically implanted\ninto the hole at 4.0 mm vertically from the skull\nsurface. The microinjector was left in place for 10 min\nto minimize backflow and then removed. The\ndrugs were gently injected intraventricularly, dissolved\nin 4 or 5 ll physiological saline, at the following concen-\ntrations: 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-\ndiamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio] butadi-\nand bisperoxovanadium (BPV), 10 lM. The drugs were\ninjected into the right lateral ventricle 15 min before\nMCAO or 15 min before reperfusion. With a brain\nweight in the rat of 1 to 2 g, the intracerebral concentra-\ntions are probably at least 100 times smaller.\nBrain Section\nAt the end of experiment, each brain was quickly\nremoved and collected. Brain sectioning was accom-\nplished according to the protocol previously reported\nby Ashwal et al. (1998). Briefly, the brains were sectioned\ninto three parts, the first part begun in 3 mm from the\nanterior tip of the frontal lobe. The second part (4 mm\nthick) was used for the measurement. Regions from the\nright and left hemispheres of the second part that corres-\nponded to the ischemic core and penumbra were dis-\nsected. A longitudinal cut (from top to bottom) was\nmade approximately 2 mm from the midline through\neach hemisphere. Then, a transverse diagonal cut was\nmade at approximately the 2 o'clock position to separate\nthe core (i.e., striatum and overlying cortex) from the\npenumbra (adjacent cortex). Thereafter, tissues were\nhomogenized in lysis buffer containing protease inhibi-\ntors (10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethyl\nsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) and\nwere collected and stored at \u00c040C.\nCoimmunoprecipitation of EGFR and SOS1, and\nRaf-1 and Phospho-Akt\nThe brains were homogenized with EBC buffer (50 mM\nphenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM sodium ortho-\n4C. Supernatants were collected and stored at \u00c040C.\nThe coimmunoprecipitation was performed with anti-\nEGFR antibody or with anti-Raf-1 antibody and protein\nagarose bead. The nitrocellulose membranes were incu-\nbated with the anti-SOS1 antibody or anti-EGFR\nanti-phospho-Akt (p-AKT) antibody or anti-AKT anti-\nWestern Blotting for Phosphorylated ERK and\nThe protein content was determined in the homogenates\nby the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976), using bovine\nserum albumin as the standard. Samples 80 lg of protein\nwere applied on the slab gel of 10% polyacrylamide.\nAfter transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the samples\nwere blocked by 5% skimmed milk powder in TBS-T\n1 hr. The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with\nthe first antibody, specific to phosphorylated ERK\n2 hr at room temperature. After washing, specific binding\nwas detected by goat-anti-mouse or goat-anti-rabbit\nhorseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody\nwas visualized by ECL detection reagents. Digital\nimages obtained using Gel-Imaging System (Tanon\n4200, Shanghai, China). Optical density for each band\nwas assessed using the Window Alpha-Ease TM FC 32-\nbit software.\nChemicals\nchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).

ECL\ndetection reagents were purchased from Amersham\nBiosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK).\nStatistics\nThe differences between individual groups were analyzed\nby one-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least\nsignificant difference test. The comparisons were made\nbetween the core region on the lesion side with the\nsame region on the contralateral side, and the penumbra\non lesion side with the corresponding region on the\ncontralateral side, to identify the significance related to\nischemia/reperfusion. The level of significance was set at\nResults\n, and AKT Activation During Ischemia\nFirst, we investigated EGFR status by quantifying its\nphosphorylation by immunoprecipitation and specific\nantibodies. EGFR was precipitated with a specific anti-\nbody. Western blot showed an increase of EGFR activity\nduring ischemia that was confirmed by an antibody spe-\ncific to tyrosine phosphorylation sites in both core and\npenumbra in ischemic hemisphere (Figure 1(a)). With\nsite-specific antibodies, phosphorylation of Y1173,\n(Figure 1(b)). The greatest stimulation was observed\nphosphorylated in both contralateral and ischemia\nhemispheres.\nNext, we analyzed ERK1/2\nand AKT phosphorylation\nby Western blot. There was no significant difference in\nphosphorylation neither in the core nor in the\npenumbra areas between ischemic and contralateral\nhemispheres after 2 hr of ischemia (Figure 1(c)). In con-\ntrast, AKT phosphorylation was significantly increased in\nboth core and penumbra regions of ischemic hemisphere\n(Figure 1(d)). To identify the role for EGFR transactiva-\nan inhibitor of Zn2\u00fe-dependent metalloproteinase and\ntherefore the subsequent shedding of growth factor(s)\nwere injected intraventricularly before ischemia. Both\ndrugs abolished phosphorylation of AKT (Figure 2(a)\nand (b)), indicating the involvement of EGFR activity\nand shedding of growth factor(s). In the presence\nphosphorylation, suggesting that ERK1/2\nphosphorylation during ischemia is suppressed by activa-\ntion of EGFR and its downstream signals (Figure 2(c)\nand (d)). Obviously, this ERK1/2\nphosphorylation\nis not mediated by EGFR because it is increased\nbut not inhibited in the presence of AG1478 and\nSOS1 and Raf-1 Activation During Ischemia\nSubsequently, we examined the interactions between\nSOS1 and EGFR. Coimmunoprecipitation of SOS1\nwith EGFR antibody showed a significant increase of\nbinding of SOS1 to EGFR after 2-hr ischemia in both\ncore and penumbra areas in ischemic hemisphere as\nexpected (Figure 3(a)), indicating that ischemia has a\nstimulatory (rather than inhibitory) effect on the inter-\naction and SOS1 activity and that ischemia interferes\nphosphorylation at a site downstream of\nSOS1. Taking in account high levels of AKT activity\nduring ischemia and its inhibitory effect on Raf-1\n(Zimmermann and Moelling, 1999; Moelling et al.,\n2002), we further analyzed the phosphorylation of inhibi-\nsite of Raf-1 by Western blot. Two hr of ischemia\nenhanced Raf-1 Ser259 phosphorylation significantly\nbut had no effect on Raf-1 Ser338 (Figure 3(b)), suggest-\ning that a decrease of Raf-1 activity is likely to be\nresponsible for the ischemia-induced MAPK/ERK1/2\ninactivation.\nCrosstalk Between PI3K/AKT and Raf-1 During\nIschemia\nTo monitor interactions between p-AKT and Raf-1, we\nperformed coimmunoprecipitation of p-AKT with a spe-\ncific antibody to Raf-1.

Both\nand p-ERK2\nare significantly lower in the\ncore and penumbra on lesion side than on the contra-\nlateral side as expected, while no effect on AKT phos-\nphorylation was observed (Figure 8(a) and (b)),\nindicating that MAPK/ERK1/2\nhas no inhibitory\neffect on PI3K/AKT signal pathway during reperfu-\nsion. In Figure 8(b), p-AKT is significantly higher\nin the core than penumbra in both contralateral and\nischemic sides. However, there is no difference\nbetween the cores in contralateral and ischemic\nsides, suggesting the high p-AKT in core is not related\nto ischemia. Finally, we injected catalase, an\nenzyme degrading hydrogen peroxide and hence\ncounteraction effects of ROS after 2-hr ischemia but\nbefore 1-hr reperfusion. Injection of catalase abol-\nished stimulation of ERK1/2\nphosphorylation\n(Figure 9(a)), and restored AKT phosphorylation\n(Figure 9(b)). BPV, an inhibitor of phosphatase and\ntensin homolog (PTEN) had similar effect (Figure 9(c)\nand (d)).\nDiscussion\nExperiments on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion model\ndemonstrated that ERK phosphorylation depends on\nreperfusion (Omura et al., 1999), but the underlying mech-\nanism remains unknown. Even less is known about the\neffects of ischemia/reperfusion in the brain. In the present\narticle, we performed systematic analysis of EGFR and its\ntwo signal pathways Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2\nand PI3K/AKT\nduring ischemia and reperfusion using rat MCAO model.\nWe have investigated (a) the EGFR transactivation and\nthe activations of PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2\nsignal pathways during ischemia, (b) the interaction\nbetween PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2\nsignal path-\nways during ischemia, (c) the EGFR transactivation and\nthe activations of PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2\nsignal pathways during reperfusion, and (d) the interaction\nof PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2\nsignal pathways\nduring reperfusion.\nFirst, we found that there was no increase of ERK1/2\nphosphorylation during ischemia, but phosphorylation\nsignificantly increased in reperfusion. This is similar to\nmyocardial ischemia/reperfusion model (Omura et al.,\n1999). Phosphorylation of AKT was significantly\nenhanced during ischemia, and it was inhibited by both\ntor of Zn2\u00fe-dependent metalloproteinase, indicating an\nFigure 5.

The inhibitory effect of PI3K/AKT on\npathway was further confirmed by\ninhibitor of PI3K and triciribine hydrate (TCN), an inhibi-\ntor of AKT. All these suggest an inhibitory effect of PI3K/\nAKT on Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2\npathway during ischemic\nperiod. Similar inhibition has beenreported for other tissues\nand cells,suchasAKT-inducedphosphorylation of Raf-1 at\nSer259 by insulin-like growth factor 1 in MCF-7, a human\nbreast cancer cell line (Zimmermann and Moelling, 1999;\nMoelling et al., 2002) and by platelet-derived growth\nfactor in vascular smooth muscle cells (Reusch et al.,\nphosphor-\nylation in human myotubes (Rommel et al., 1999), that\neffect possibly not being mediated by the direct phosphor-\nThird, we found no increase of AKT phosphorylation\nin reperfusion period. However, ERK phosphorylation\nwas significantly enhanced during reperfusion, and it\nwas inhibited by both AG 1478, an inhibitor of EGFR\nmetalloproteinase, indicating an involvement of EGFR\ntransactivation. The sites of EGFR phosphorylation\nwere the same as ischemic period. As has been reported\npreviously, permanent increase of EGFR and ERK activ-\nity during reperfusion and inhibition of EGFR and ERK\nactivity have protective effect (Martin and Pognonec,\nFourth, we investigated whether PI3K/AKT pathway is\ninhibited by Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2\npathway during reperfu-\nsion. Our data indicate that it is not the case because inhib-\nition of MAPK and ERK1/2\ndoes not reinstate AKT\nphosphorylation. However, inhibition of catalase activity\nnot only abolishes ERK phosphorylation but also restores\nAKT phosphorylation. This indicates that both ERK1/2\nstimulation and AKT inhibition during reperfusion are\nmediated by ROS. ROS-induced EGFR transactivation\nhas been repeatedly reported (Frank and Eguchi, 2003;\net al., 2013). More interesting, ROS stimulates PTEN, a\nnegative regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling (Hlobilkova\n\u00b4\net al., 2003) during reperfusion that in turn releases Raf-\nMAPK/ERK from inhibitory effect of AKT. This finding\nhas no effect on AKT phosphorylation during reperfusion. Two hr of focal ischemia was followed by 1-hr\nreperfusion.

Although AKT played a\nprotective role, the activation of AKT would not occur\nuntil 1 day after preconditioning and 12 hr after precon-\nditioning combined with ischemia in CA1 region of\nhippocampus (Yano et al., 2001). However, in another\nstudy, 3.5 min of ischemia induced increase of AKT phos-\nphorylation transiently in 10 to 60 min after reperfusion\n(Namura et al., 2000). These findings suggest that (a)\nthere is a transient increase of AKT activity after precon-\nditioning, at the early stage of ischemia (1\u00ad2 hr), and after\nseveral hrs of reperfusion; (b) increase of AKT activity\nmay have protective effects during ischemia and reperfu-\nsion periods; and (c) preconditioning-induced AKT phos-\nphorylation may be not related to the protective effect in\nlethal ischemia, that occurs several days later.\nIn summary, negative crosstalk exists between Raf/\nand PI3K/AKT signal pathways during\nbrain ischemia/reperfusion. Our study provides the infor-\nmation about the underlying mechanisms of this inter-\naction, that is, during ischemia, AKT phosphorylates\nRaf-1 at its inhibitory phosphorylation site and decreases\nactivity; during reperfusion, ROS\nstimulates PTEN that erases the inhibition of AKT on\nsignaling (Figure 10). PI3K/AKT\nsignaling pathway contributes to cell protection in differ-\nent cells, tissues, and animal models, including focal\nischemia and ischemic postconditioning (see Zhao\net al., 2013, and references thereby). Nevertheless, the\nfunction of Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2\nsignaling may depend\non the type of the cells, the time and extent of ERK\nactivation, and the kind of stimulation/insult. ERK phos-\nphorylation mediated by preconditioning (Kovalska\net al., 2014) and by numbers of neuroprotective com-\npounds, such as dexmedetomidine, an a2\n-adrenergic\ndamage in brain ischemia. However, inhibition of ERK\nphosphorylation by administration of MAPK inhibitor\nprior to ischemia (in both global brain ischemia and\nMCAO model) decreased cell injury, infarct volume,\nand neurological deficit (Kindy, 1993; Wang et al.,\n~ eda et al., 2009). Therefore, the understand-\ning of crosstalk between Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2\nAKT signal pathways during brain ischemia/reperfusion\nmay eventually lead to the development of new thera-\npeutic strategy for the disease. Our findings suggest that\nROS removes inhibition of AKT on ERK activity during\nreperfusion. The strong stimulation of ERK activity plays\na key role in reperfusion-induced cell damage. Inhibitors\nof ROS, PTEN, EGFR, and ERK may have therapeutic\npotential in clinic for brain ischemia.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China.
