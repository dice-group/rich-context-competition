Homeostasis model assessment was used to quantify\ninsulin resistance and -cell function. A reference population\nwas derived from the National Health and Nutrition Exami-\nsistance, insulin secretion, bioavailable testosterone, and\nbody mass index all exhibited significant pairwise correla-\ntions. Multiple regression analysis clarified the phenotypic\nrelationships, demonstrating that insulin resistance and bio-\navailable testosterone were independent predictors of -cell\nfunction; -cell function and obesity were independent pre-\ndictors of insulin resistance; and -cell function was an inde-\npendent predictor of bioavailable testosterone. Of note, com-\nparison with normal women from NHANES revealed a\nsignificantly stronger relationship between -cell function\nand insulin resistance in PCOS, raising the possibility of an\nintrinsic defect in -cell function whereby increasing insulin\nresistance leads to a greater insulin response in PCOS than\nnormal. The altered relationship of -cell function and insulin\nresistance coupled with the fact that -cell function, not in-\nsulin resistance, was a predictor of hyperandrogenemia sug-\ngests that -cell dysfunction may be a key pathogenic deter-\n4\u00ad7% of women of reproductive age, making it the\nmost common endocrine disorder in women (1, 2). For many\nyears, obesity has been an important feature of the syndrome.\nMore recently, investigators recognized insulin resistance,\ncentral component of PCOS, possibly playing an underlying\npathogenic role (6). PCOS, in turn, may confer a risk of\ninsulin resistance in addition to that caused by obesity (7, 8).\nHowever, it is not clear whether insulin resistance itself or the\nresultant compensatory hyperinsulinemia leads to the hor-\nmonal abnormalities in PCOS. Of the handful of studies that\naddress insulin secretion in PCOS, some describe increased\ninsulin secretion (9\u00ad16), although others suggest decreased\nFor these reasons we sought to better understand the role\nof pancreatic insulin secretion in PCOS, in particular to place\nit in the context of insulin resistance, hyperandrogenemia,\nand obesity. To achieve this goal, we analyzed a cohort of\nPCOS patients who had undergone detailed characterization\nof these phenotypes and compared it with a matched normal\npopulation. Simple correlation and multiple regression anal-\nyses were used to describe the relationships among these\ntraits. We found an altered relationship between -cell func-\ntion and insulin resistance in PCOS compared with normal\nwomen.\nSubjects and Methods\nWe conducted an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective\nchart review of patients presenting to S.G.K.'s university-based (David\nGeffen School of Medicine at UCLA) reproductive endocrinology clinic\nwith chief complaints of hirsutism, alopecia, acne, or weight gain. Cri-\nteria defining PCOS were those of the 1990 National Institute of Child\nHealth and Human Development Consensus Conference (20), namely\nthat there was evidence of hyperandrogenism and oligo-ovulation with\nexclusion of other disorders known to result in a hyperandrogenic\nsyndrome, such as Cushing's disease or congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\nHyperandrogenism was either clinical in the form of hirsutism, acne, or\nalopecia, or biochemical in the form of an elevated serum androgen level.\nClinical assessment was made by the same physician in all cases. Oligo-\novulation was considered to be present if the patient gave a history of\na reduced frequency of menses (missed periods or secondary amenor-\nrhea) or if anovulation was demonstrated by luteal phase progesterone\nmeasurement.\nExclusion criteria included a hyperandrogenic disorder other than\nPCOS, such as Cushing's syndrome, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, or hy-\nperandrogenic insulin resistance acanthosis nigricans syndrome. 21-\nHydroxylase deficiency presenting as adult-onset (nonclassical) adrenal\nhyperplasia was diagnosed using standard criteria (21, 22). Also ex-\ncluded were patients who at presentation were receiving medications\nthat could alter the endocrine and metabolic parameters under inves-\ntigation, because we wanted to characterize PCOS as it affects women\nbefore treatment. Such medications included oral contraceptives, met-\nformin, glucocorticoids, and dexamethasone. Patients were also ex-\ncluded if they had impaired fasting glucose, diabetes mellitus, anorexia\nnervosa, hypopituitarism, prolactinoma, or active thyroid disease, with\nthe latter assessed by prolactin and TSH measurements. Hypopituitar-\nism was excluded biochemically when a suggestive history or physical\nexam findings were present.

A clinic nurse obtained\nthe weight, height, and blood pressure of each subject. Age was deter-\nmined at time of presentation. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as\nkg/m2. All 60 had a morning fasting glucose, insulin, and total and\nbioavailable [non-sex-hormone-binding globulin (non-SHBG)-bound]\ntestosterone, as previously described (23). The laboratory performing\nthe blood tests (Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, for hor-\nmonal measurements) provided normal values; all other tests were done\nat the University of California, Los Angeles, Clinical Laboratory.\nThe homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to calculate\nindices of insulin resistance and insulin secretion for each patient (24,\n25). The computer-based HOMA calculator (available at www.dtu.ox.\nac.uk/homa) uses fasting glucose and insulin to generate the index of\ninsulin resistance, HOMA-IR, and the index of -cell function, HOMA-\n%B.

Subjects from NHANES III\nwho had glucose and insulin levels obtained after at least 8 h fasting were\nselected to match the age, BMI, and racial/ethnic distribution of the\nPCOS group. Thus, the groups were comparable in age (NHANES mean\nkg/m2). Both populations had equal proportions of Caucasian subjects\n(64%), Mexican-Americans (11%), African-Americans (9%), and other\nethnic groups (16%). We excluded participants who were using insulin\nor who had a fasting glucose greater than 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/liter)\nor a glycosylated hemoglobin greater than 6% to remove individuals\nwith glucose intolerance or diabetes, yielding 486 subjects for analysis.\nThe methods used for glucose, insulin, and lipid levels are detailed in\nthe NHANES report (27).\nStatistical analysis\nParameters that had a skewed distribution (weight, BMI, insulin,\nHOMA-IR, HOMA-%B, and total and bioavailable testosterone values)\nwere log transformed for all analyses to reduce skewness. Henceforth\nreference to these variables will always mean their log-transformed\nvalues. Student's t test was used to compare means between PCOS and\nNHANES. A P value  0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nSimple correlation analyses were carried out comparing all possible\npairwise combinations of the variables HOMA-%B, HOMA-IR, age,\nBMI, bioavailable testosterone, and total testosterone for both the PCOS\nand NHANES populations (testosterone was not measured in\nNHANES). A large sample test (28) was used to compare corresponding\ncorrelation coefficients between the two populations. In the PCOS\ngroup, multiple regression analysis was conducted 1) with HOMA-IR,\nage, BMI, and bioavailable testosterone as independent variables and\nHOMA-%B as the dependent variable; 2) with HOMA-%B, age, BMI,\nand bioavailable testosterone as independent variables and HOMA-IR\nas the dependent variable; and 3) with HOMA-IR, HOMA-%B, age, and\nBMI as independent variables and bioavailable testosterone as the de-\npendent variable. Analyses were conducted using Statview 5.01 and SAS\nsoftware (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nResults\nPhenotypic correlations in PCOS\nThe phenotypic correlations among insulin resistance,\n-cell function, testosterone levels, age, and BMI, assessed by\npairwise correlations, are displayed in Table 1.

To illustrate the differential relation-\nship of HOMA-%B and HOMA-IR, Fig. 1 presents overlaid\nregression plots for HOMA-%B vs. HOMA-IR for PCOS and\nNHANES. These plots depict the effect of incremental in-\ncreases in HOMA-IR on HOMA-%B. The greater effect of\nHOMA-IR on HOMA-%B in PCOS is reflected in the steeper\nslope of the regression line for PCOS (Fig. 1), indicating that\na given increase in HOMA-IR results in a larger increment in\nHOMA-%B in women with PCOS than in those without.\nDiscussion\nThis study aimed to characterize the most important in-\ndependent determinants of -cell function, insulin resis-\ntance, and hyperandrogenemia in PCOS. Although all pair-\nwise correlations of HOMA-%B, HOMA-IR, and bioavailable\ntestosterone were statistically significant, multiple regres-\nsion analyses allowed identification of the most significant\npredictors of each trait. Our study was unique in that we\ncompared inter-trait correlations between PCOS and normal\nwomen, not simply mean values. This approach demon-\nstrated a disproportionate elevation of -cell function com-\npared with insulin resistance in PCOS compared with nor-\nmal women, a dramatic finding given that the two groups\nhad similar mean values of these insulin-related traits.\nThe use of women from NHANES provided a very large\nnormal control group; even if 5% of this population had\nPCOS it would not have altered the results. In fact, the pres-\nence of PCOS in the NHANES population would tend to\nhinder detection of differences in a comparison of our PCOS\npatients with NHANES. Direct comparison of mean trait\nvalues, as in Table 3, must be interpreted with some caution\nbecause the glucose and insulin determinations were made\nin different laboratories.\nThe unsuspected importance of -cell function\nIn PCOS and normal women, the most significant predic-\ntor of -cell function was insulin resistance. This is consistent\nwith the concept of compensatory insulin hypersecretion in\nresponse to insulin resistance. Compensatory hyperinsulin-\nemia serves to maintain normal plasma glucose levels in the\nface of insulin resistance. Because the patients were selected\nto have normal fasting glucose levels (range, 69\u00ad105 mg/dl\nor 3.8\u00ad5.8 mmol/liter), they had adequate -cell function.\nThe most insulin-resistant patients with PCOS in this study\nhad -cells secreting insulin at very high levels. These pa-\ntients may be at increased risk of -cell exhaustion and de-\nvelopment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (29).\nTABLE 2.

Several studies demonstrated increased\ninsulin secretion in PCOS compared with normal (9\u00ad16),\nalthough other studies demonstrated decreased insulin se-\ncretion in PCOS (17\u00ad19). Different results have been observed\ndepending on whether insulin secretion was assessed in the\nbasal vs. postabsorptive state (30). Another possible con-\nfounding factor is that many studies quantified insulin se-\ncretion without accounting for the prevailing level of insulin\nresistance; this is essential to accurate interpretation of in-\ndices of -cell function because insulin secretion and insulin\nsensitivity have been shown to have a hyperbolic relation-\nship (31). Insulin secretion may be adjusted for insulin re-\nsistance using statistical means or by employing the dispo-\nsition index, the product of an index of insulin secretion with\nan index of insulin sensitivity. Nevertheless, even among\ncareful studies making this adjustment, conflicting results\nregarding insulin secretion in PCOS are found in the liter-\nature (14, 18, 32). We avoided this problem by examining the\nrelationship between insulin secretion and insulin resistance,\nrather than comparing mean values. Although we did not\nfind BMI to be an independent predictor of -cell function,\nothers have observed differences in -cell function between\nlean and obese women with PCOS, with increased insulin\nsecretion in lean PCOS and decreased insulin secretion in\nobese PCOS (32). Insulin secretion tends to be decreased in\nwomen with PCOS and impaired glucose tolerance; a study\nof obese, insulin-resistant adolescents with PCOS found that\nthose with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes had im-\npaired -cell response to the same degree of insulin resis-\ntance as the normoglycemic patients (17). In a separate study,\nnormal glucose-tolerant women with PCOS had increased\ninsulin secretion, whereas those with impaired glucose tol-\nerance had decreased insulin secretion (14). Similarly,\nwomen with polycystic ovaries and a history of gestational\ndiabetes have impaired -cell function (33, 34). Thus, the\nheterogeneity observed in -cell function in PCOS may re-\nflect its assessment at different stages of the disorder, with\nincreased -cell function in lean subjects with normal glucose\ntolerance and decreased -cell function in obese subjects who\nhave mild (manifesting during pregnancy as gestational di-\nabetes) or overt impairment in glucose tolerance.\nA key finding in this study was the altered relationship of\n-cell function and insulin resistance in PCOS in comparison\nwith normal women. The correlation coefficients relating\nHOMA-%B to HOMA-IR were higher in PCOS, indicating a\ngreater degree of compensatory insulin secretion for a given\nincrement in insulin resistance. The basis of this difference is\nunknown. Perhaps in PCOS there is a genetic variant in the\npancreatic -cell that leads to insulin hypersecretion. In fact,\nin studies of families of women with PCOS, insulin secretion\nlevels, quantified directly by the frequently sampled iv glu-\ncose tolerance test, showed significant heritability, suggest-\ning a genetic component to -cell function in PCOS (35).\nHigher proinsulin levels in women with PCOS compared\nwith normal have been observed, supporting the hypothesis\nof altered -cell function in PCOS (36). Another study ob-\nserved that weight loss in a group of women with PCOS led\nto normalization of insulin resistance but did not alter insulin\nhypersecretion, suggesting that the latter is a primary, in-\ntrinsic factor in PCOS (16). Given that HOMA-%B was a\nsignificant predictor of bioavailable testosterone in PCOS, it\nis possible that the tendency to insulin hypersecretion leads\nto elevated levels of insulin that then contribute to hyperan-\ndrogenemia. Indeed, much experimental evidence exists to\nsuggest that insulin has the ability to stimulate ovarian tes-\ntosterone production (37\u00ad39). Whether increased insulin se-\ncretion stimulates adrenal androgen hypersecretion is more\ncontroversial; however, one study of PCOS women found\nthat during an insulin infusion, adrenal -5 androgen output\nwas exaggerated compared with saline infusion, suggesting\nthat hyperinsulinemia potentiated the adrenocortical re-\nsponse to ACTH (40).\nThe place of insulin resistance\nWe used HOMA-IR to quantify insulin resistance because\nthis tool has been shown to be a reliable reflection of insulin\nresistance with a good correlation (r  0.6\u00ad0.88) with the\neuglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp study (24, 26,\n41). A recent report showed HOMA-IR to have a better cor-\nrelation with clamp results than even indices derived from\noral glucose tolerance tests (42). In women with PCOS and\nin normal women, HOMA-%B and BMI were significant\ncorrelates of HOMA-IR. Whether the insulin resistance often\nobserved in PCOS is because of obesity or an effect of PCOS\nFIG. 1. Regression plot of HOMA-IR on HOMA-%B. The plot is an\noverlay of the simple regression plots for PCOS and for NHANES.\nTABLE 4. Correlation among phenotypes in normal women\nCorrelation coefficients (R) are above the diagonal; P values for\neach pairwise correlation are below the diagonal. Significant corre-\nlation coefficients are indicated in bold.\nitself is controversial. Some studies showed similar insulin\nresistance in weight-matched PCOS and control subjects (19,\n43), whereas others demonstrated increased insulin resis-\ntance in PCOS compared with weight-matched controls (3,\n30, 44). What is widely accepted is that women with both\nPCOS and obesity have the highest risk for insulin resistance.\nIn multiple regression analysis in PCOS, BMI was signif-\nicantly related to HOMA-IR but not to HOMA-%B. This is in\nagreement with a study wherein weight loss normalized\ninsulin resistance in women with PCOS but did not reduce\ntheir increased insulin secretion (16). In another study of lean\nand obese women with PCOS, insulin resistance was most\nprominent in the obese subjects, whereas insulin hyperse-\ncretion was found in all hyperinsulinemic PCOS patients,\nregardless of obesity (10). This again highlights the potential\nimportance of pancreatic -cell function in the pathophysi-\nology of PCOS. If a tendency to insulin hypersecretion is a\nprimary characteristic of PCOS, insulin resistance may yet\nhave importance as a physiological stressor that, by increas-\ning the body's need for insulin, causes the insulin secretory\nabnormality to become manifest. This is suggested by the\ngreater slope of the HOMA-%B vs. HOMA-IR line in PCOS\nvs. normal (Fig. 1).\nThe role of androgens: bioavailable testosterone\nSome studies suggest that insulin resistance/hyperinsu-\nothers suggest the reverse (46, 47). The current study found\na significant correlation between insulin resistance and hy-\nperandrogenemia; however, in multiple regression analysis,\nthe relationship between these traits was insignificant. On\nthe other hand, a robust relationship was found between\n-cell function and bioavailable testosterone. As discussed\nabove, this raises the possibility that insulin hypersecretion\ncauses hypersecretion of androgens. Conversely, elevated\nandrogen levels may influence -cell function, leading to\ninsulin hypersecretion. Consistent with this possibility, a\nstudy demonstrating increased insulin secretion in PCOS\ncompared with normal found no difference after adjusting\nfor free androgen index (14). Another alternative is that a\ncommon cellular defect leads to both insulin hypersecretion\nand androgen hypersecretion. Our results demonstrate a\nsignificant correlation between HOMA-%B and bioavailable\ntestosterone but do not allow conclusions on causation. What\ncan be inferred is that the correlation of insulin resistance and\nhyperandrogenemia often observed in PCOS is likely medi-\nated via compensatory insulin hypersecretion.\nBioavailable (non-SHBG-bound) testosterone exhibited\nsignificant pairwise correlations with BMI and with HOMA-\n%B. Although both obesity and hyperinsulinemia may con-\ntribute to decreased levels of SHBG, resulting in higher bio-\navailable testosterone, multiple regression analysis showed\nthat -cell function had the most direct effect on hyperan-\ndrogenemia. It has been suggested that hyperinsulinemia\nmay mediate the decrease in SHBG seen with increasing\nadiposity (48). Thus, insulin suppression of hepatic synthesis\nof SHBG (49) may contribute to the correlation of -cell\nfunction and bioavailable testosterone, in addition to a pos-\nsible effect of insulin on ovarian steroidogenesis (37\u00ad39). The\nfact that total testosterone exhibited no significant inter-trait\ncorrelations demonstrates the importance of low SHBG in the\nhyperandrogenemia of PCOS.\nImplications\nInsulin resistance is clearly found in many subjects with\nPCOS and may contribute to increased risk of the metabolic\nsyndrome, development of type 2 diabetes, and cardiovas-\ncular disease (6). However, this study demonstrates the\nunder-recognized importance of -cell function in PCOS.\n-Cell function, not insulin resistance, was an important\ncorrelate of bioavailable testosterone levels. Women with\nPCOS demonstrated an altered relationship between insulin\nresistance and insulin secretion, consistent with an intrinsic\n-cell defect wherein insulin resistance leads to an excessive\namount of compensatory insulin secretion, with attendant\nconsequences on androgen production and SHBG levels.\nInsulin hypersecretion may also help to explain the intense\nhunger experienced by PCOS patients and their ability to\ngain large amounts of weight in a short period of time.\nPossibly this insulin hypersecretion was evolutionarily ad-\nvantageous in times of nutritional deprivation. More re-\nsearch, both at the clinical and cellular levels, is needed to\nbetter understand the importance of insulin secretion in\nPCOS. If -cell function is indeed a central pathogenic defect\nin PCOS, therapies that directly modulate insulin secretion\nmay achieve greater success than insulin-sensitizing thera-\npies commonly used today.\n"
