To examine racial-ethnic differences in the allocation of financial transfers to parents, children, and others by\nmiddle-aged couples.\nMethods. Multinomial specification of alternative recipients of financial transfers, using data from the 1992 Health and\nRetirement Survey.\nResults. Transfer patterns are sensitive to parental health and wealth, to children being young or in school, as well as to the\ndonors' health and wealth. Controlling for these and other factors, including family size and structure, Blacks and Whites are\nthe most likely, and Hispanics the least likely, tofinanciallyhelp their parents compared to assisting offspring. Black couples\nare the most likely to sacrifice their own consumption to assist parents financially.\nDiscussion. Future research on transfers should attempt to capture unmeasured noneconomic sources of variation proxied\nby the race-ethnicity indicator.\nRACIAL differences in demographic behaviors across suc-\n. cessive generations of family accumulate to produce sub-\nsequent variations in family structure. On average, Blacks and\nHispanics have larger extended families than Whites at middle\nage because of the formers' higher fertility, shorter mean length\nof generation, and lower age at first union (NCHS, 1993). There\nare no differences across racial-ethnic groups in the proportions\nwith offspring at middle age, but Whites are more likely to have\nsurviving parents. Data from the 1992 Health and Retirement\nSurvey indicate that among non-institutionalized persons aged\nchildren and parents, compared to 67% ofWhites.\nDespite racial-ethnic differences in family size and the distri-\nbution of needs and resources, most prior studies of racial-ethnic\ndifferences in transfer behaviors have focused on time transfers,\nusually to elderly parents or to children (McGarry & Schoeni,\nously. Lower levels of health (Markides, Radkin, Angel, &\n(Smith, 1995) suggest that there is a greater density of needs\nacross the generations of Black and Hispanic families but\nsmaller pools of wealth within a generation. Silverstein and\nWaite (1993) show, for example, that Blacks are generally more\ninvolved in family support networks, exchanging affective, in-\nstrumental, and hands-on care with elderly parents at higher\nrates than Whites. Although financial transfers may substitute\nfor in-kind transfers, low aggregate levels of wealth among\nBlacks and Hispanics (Smith, 1995) may deterfinancialgiving\nacross generations of the extended family. Nonetheless, the ex-\ntent of financial needs within the kin group may increase the\nlikelihood of Blacks and Hispanics providing financial assis-\ntance, even if the absolute amounts are small.\nAt all ages and across various populations, resources over-\nwhelminglyflowfrom parents to offspring (Lee, 1997; McGarry\n& Schoeni, 1995), although the type of assistance parents pro-\nvide varies with age of donor. Researchers have examined trans-\nfers from parents to children separately from flows in the other\ndirection (McGarry & Schoeni, 1995). Thus, we know little\nabout the potential trade-offs, the constraints, or the process by\nwhich middle-aged persons decide to allocate inter-vivos re-\nsources between elderly parents and their children, or racial and\nethnic differences in how couples balance claims from their chil-\ndren against those from parents. This article examines how mid-\ndle-aged couples allocate their household financial resources\namong competing claims from their parents and offspring and\nemphasizes racial-ethnic differences in these behaviors. For this\npurpose, we define three categories based on self-reports of sur-\nvey respondents from the 1992 Health and Retirement Study:\nHispanic, (non-Hispanic) White, and (non-Hispanic) Black.\nSocial science research based on categories defined by race or\nethnicity can be misleading because discrete groupings mask a\nhost of socioeconomic and cultural factors, with each category\nrepresenting a heterogeneous subgroup within the population\ndent reports of race and ethnicity lack a clear genetic basis, they\nconvey important aspects of self-identity and social orientation\nin an increasingly diverse population. We incorporate in our\nmodels a range of socioeconomic indicators and measures of\npotential sources of cultural diversity. In addition, we include the\nrace-ethnicity category as a proxy for unobserved differences in\nresources and preferences for assisting family members.\nConceptual Framework and Hypotheses\nIntergenerational transfer systems are complex, involving\nflows in two directions at a point in time, in at least three cur-\nrencies (space, time, and money) across three or more genera-\ntions. This article is a building block toward implementing such\nan approach, and addresses the issue of multiple generations\ncompeting for scarcefinancialresources. We examine the mid-\ndle-aged generation in its donor role, with their children and\nparents as potential recipients, in the currency of money. The\nstrategy can be partly justified because individuals aged 51 to\n61 represent the majority of givers among the generations, and\nonly a small proportion of this age group receive assistance\nFrom the perspective of middle-aged adults, the well-being\nof parents and children is desirable and contributions of re-\nsources may be needed in order to secure it. These resources\nmay be investments in human capital for future pay-off (Pollak,\n1995), from which the donor may or may not benefit directly,\nor repayment for previous services or favors received (Stark,\n1995). At any given time, middle-aged individuals may derive\nsatisfaction from the welfare of their parents and their children,\nbut also from assisting other potential recipients (e.g., other rel-\natives, friends, religious or charitable organizations) and their\nown consumption.\nThe model includes only the needs and constraints that can be\nobserved in a cross-section of middle-aged individuals at risk of\nbalancing needs of parents and offspring. The model assumes\nthat financial transfers respond to short-term needs and con-\nstraints. From the perspective of the middle-aged adult, transfers\nof a scarce resource will be made to one generation instead of\nanother if this option yields greater returns in terms of satisfac-\ntion. The behavior of the middle-aged generation is governed by\nthe preferences towards the welfare of all potential recipients,\nbut is constrained by their ability to provide transfers and the rel-\native need of the potential recipients. For example, a financial\ntransfer to a recipient who is impoverished or suffered an eco-\nnomic shock, such as the loss of a job, is likely to result in a\nlarger welfare gain for the recipient than a transfer when an oth-\nerwise comparable recipient has higher levels of wealth. A fi-\nnancial transfer when the donor is poor results in a larger loss\nfor the donor than a transfer when the donor is relatively well-\noff. Finally, holding all else constant, a donor will allocate re-\nsources to their own consumption, non-relatives, or charities if\nsuch giving conveys higher levels of satisfaction for the donor,\nperhaps because of public recognition, status, or the gratitude of\nothers. Thus the transfer behavior depends on attributes of both\nthe donor and thepotential recipients, and factors measuring the\nrelative preferences of the donor. The factors measuring the rela-\ntive preferences of donors are those capturing cultural beliefs,\nreligious attachment, strength of kin ties, and kin obligation.\nDrawing on earlier work of Behrman, Pollak, and Taubman\n(1995), we hypothesize that middle-aged donors will favor their\nchildren over their parents in allocating financial assistance\n(DaVanzo & Goldscheider, 1990; Hogan, Eggebeen, & Clogg,\nhigher responsibility towards the immediate welfare of their\nchildren rather than their parents. Parents have a responsibility\nto children from birth; at least in part this obligation carries the\nforce of law as well as norms. In contrast, the private social\ncontract governing the obligation of adult children to parents is\nand generally unenforceable.\nWe hypothesize also that the gap between the propensities to\nassist children and parents will be smaller for Blacks and\nHispanics than for Whites because of unmeasured factors af-\nfecting transfer behaviors that correlate with racial and ethnic\nidentity. Regardless of wealth, minority families may have\nstronger kin ties because of a history of exclusion from the\ndominant culture and its social institutions (see Silverstein &\nWaite, 1993, and references therein). The culture of family re-\nliance may have its origins in labor market experiences (often\ncharacterized by marginal employment, low wages, and spells\nof unemployment) that reduce eligibility for private pension\nplans, and limit access to institutional mechanisms, such as\ncredit, to meet consumption needs in middle and late life\n(O'Rand, 1996). Enhanced dependence on family networks\nmay be reinforced across generations, so that regardless of so-\ncioeconomic status or intergenerational social mobility, middle-\naged Blacks and Hispanics may be more likely than Whites to\nassist parents relative to children.\nIn addition, we expect that the relative differences in the odds\nof assisting parents versus children will be smaller for\nHispanics than Whites, in part because of their histories of mi-\ngration. Language barriers or fear of interacting with formal\nmarkets in a new country, may yield a fairly sequestered sub-\nculture (Currie, 1996). For migrants from Mexico and other\nCentral American countries, there is no tradition of relying on\neither government assistance or private lending institutions,\neven for long-term borrowing such as home mortgages. If the\nparents of Hispanics reside outside the United States, the finan-\ncial transfers from adult children may be part of the unwritten\nremittance contract (Lozano-Ascencio, 1993). Thus the unique\nHispanic experience in the United States may produce a culture\nin which family support towards elderly parents is expected.\nIn summary, this article tests the following hypotheses: (1)\nmiddle-aged couples will favor their children over their parents\nin allocatingfinancialassistance, regardless of race or ethnicity;\nand (2) holding all else constant, the gap between the propen-\nsity to assist parents and children will be smaller for both\nHispanics and Blacks than for Whites.\nMETHODS\nData\nThe data for the analysis are from Wave 1 (1992) of the\nHealth and Retirement Study (HRS). This survey collects de-\ntailed information from non-institutionalized persons born be-\n& Suzman, 1995). The HRS design provides for oversamples\nOur main objective is to examine the giving behavior of re-\nspondents towards their parents in contrast to their children, and\nthe trade-offs made to accommodate both generations of the\nfamily. We ask howfinancialresources are allocated among the\nset of potential recipients: children, parents, religious or charity\norganizations, or others. Charities and others are included as po-\ntential recipients to exhaust the transfer options a donor con-\nfronts. Our analysis sample includes only HRS respondents who\nreport themselves to be married or partnered (i.e., couples) with\nat least one child and one living parent of either spouse/partner.\nAbout 71% of couples in the HRS meet these criteria. We treat\nthe couple as the unit of analysis because we view the couple as\najoint production unit who jointly determine consumption, sav-\nings, and contributions to the welfare of their kin. Our results\ncan be generalized only to middle-aged couples (married or part-\nnered) with at least one child and parent, although the odds of\nbeing part of a couple varies across racial-ethnic groups. Among\nHRS-1 households, Blacks are appreciably less likely to have a\nspouse or partner (49%) than Hispanics (67%) or Whites (75%).\nAmong the subset who have both living parents and children,\nBlacks are less likely to be part of a couple (69%) compared\nWe treat the set of children as a potential transfer unit and the\nset of parents as a unit (i.e., we make no distinction between bi-\nological and stepchildren or parents of one spouse or the other).\nWe further limit our sample to couples in which at least one of\nthe spouses is Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, or non-Hispanic\nBlack; we exclude 44 couples who identify themselves as be-\nlonging to other race-ethnic groups. If the race-ethnicity of the\nwoman differs from that declared by her male partner, we clas-\nsify the couple as being of mixed race-ethnicity. Of the 3,185\ncouples who meet these criteria, 52 additional couples were ex-\ncluded because of missing data, resulting in a final analysis\nBlack, 7% Hispanic, and 7% of mixed race or ethnicity. Among\nHispanic couples, at least one of the spouses is of Mexican ori-\ngin or background in 70% of the cases.\nMEASURES\nWe derive five mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories\nto construct our dependent variable of transfer behaviors.\nCouples were classified in terms of whether they provide finan-\ncial help to anyone, and if so, by type of recipient. This classifi-\ncation yields afive-foldtypology of financial transfer options:\nassisting children but not parents; parents but not children; chil-\ndren and parents; religious or charity organizations, or others,\nbut not children or parents; and a residual category of assisting\nno one. For simplicity, we refer to these categories as giving fi-\nnancial assistance to \"children-only,\" \"parents-only,\" \"both chil-\ndren and parents,\" \"charity,\" and \"no one.\" We interpret this last\ncategory as the donor's propensity to allocate resources to their\nown consumption, either current or future (savings).\nCouples were asked if they gave financial help to parents or\nchildren of either spouse totaling $500 or more in the previous\n12 months, excluding shared housing and food. Financial assis-\ntance to elderly parents includes unrestricted cash transfers,\nhelp with paying bills, and assistance to cover specific costs\nsuch as those for nursing care, medical or insurance expenses,\nor rent. Financial assistance to children refers tofinancialassis-\ntance of $500 or more in the past 12 months, and it includes un-\nrestricted cash transfers, help paying bills, or expenses such as\ninsurance, schooling, or housing expenses. Religious or charita-\nble contributions refer to donations of money, property, or pos-\nsessions valued at $500 or more in the previous year. In addi-\ntion, couples were asked if they gave any money in 1991 toward\nthe support of anyone who was not living with the couple.\nA disproportionately high percentage of donor couples assisting\nonly children are White, but Whites represent a low proportion\namong those helping only their parents. We use household weights\nto estimate the distribution of donor couples in each category of re-\ncipient (not shown). Among those assisting children only, 86.5%\nare White, whereas 4.1 % are Black and 2.7% Hispanic. Among\nthose favoring only their parents, however, 61.6% are White, com-\nThe explanatory variables include indicators of the couple's\nrelative preferences, the couple's ability to provide transfers,\nand the potential claims of their children and parents. A detailed\nlist of variables and their definition is provided in Table 1. Our\nmeasures for the ability of the couple to providefinancialtrans-\nfers include the total net worth of the couple, entered in loga-\nrithmic form with a linear spline (knot at zero). Hence the\nmodel has two terms to capture the effect of the natural log of\nnet worth. We include whether one of the spouses has a major\nchronic disease (cancer, heart disease, and/or stroke) that may\nerode theirfinancialwell-being either because of current medi-\ncal expenditures or concern for the survivor's estate. We also in-\nclude a measure of whether either spouse thought it unlikely to\nsurvive after age 75. This subjective probability (Hurd &\nMcGarry, 1995) measure is intended to capture the extent to\nwhich the expected length of life affects the propensity to pro-\nvide transfers. If donors expect to survive a relatively short time,\nthey may be more generous, although concerns for the welfare\nof the surviving spouse may mitigate against this effect. We\nalso include measures of the education of each spouse, which\ncaptures not only the aggregate human capital of the couple,\nbut may determine strong preferences for investing in human\ncapital of offspring. These measures also may capture the long-\nterm effect of education on cumulative wealth of the couple.\nAs attributes of the children we include five variables: the\nnumber of children aged 18 and older who may have situational\nneeds (e.g., not working), the number of dependent children\n(under 18 and coresident), the number of children older than 18\nin school, the number of children older than 18 who do not own\na home, and the total number of all children. As attributes of the\nparents we include measures of the size of the pool of potential\nparental recipients. Other variables indicate whether a wife's or\na husband's parent(s) is frail. Parental frailty is expected to\nprompt financial help from middle-aged couples because out-\nof-pocket medical expenses are often substantial, even for costs\npartly covered by Medicare (Moon & Malva, 1995).\nOne of the critical explanatory variables in our model is\nparental wealth. This variable captures the ability of the parents\nto meet their own consumption, including health care needs.\nHRS respondents did not directly estimate parental wealth. We\nimpute this for cases in which the parent(s) reside in the United\nStates, and construct separate (imputed) measures of the net\nworth of the wife's parents and the husband's parents. The im-\nputation equations were estimated using an auxiliary data set,\nuse detailed information on AHEAD cohorts, who are quite lit-\nerally the parental generation of the HRS cohort, to emulate the\ndistribution of wealth among the parents of age-eligible HRS re-\nspondents, and to construct an appropriate shadow sample from\nwhich we impute the wealth of the actual parents of the HRS\ncouples. Dummy variables indicate quartiles of parental wealth.\nWe estimate the model of financial transfers using five sets of\nimputed parental wealth values, and obtain final estimates cor-\nrected for imputation, using the techniques described by Rubin\ntion procedure are available from the authors.\nAn important attribute of the children and parents is whether\nthese kin receive public transfers such as welfare payments, sup-\nplemental security income, or unemployment benefits. Such data\nwere not obtained in the HRS but to take this into account, we use\nproxy measures of the wealth of the potential recipients. For par-\nents, we impute the parental wealth directly. For children, we use\nmeasures that capture their relative deprivation, such as lack of\nTable 1.

In\norder to avoid endogeneity with the outcome variable (monetary\ntransfers), other transfer currencies, other types of transfers (pub-\nlic), and proximity to kin are not included as right-hand side vari-\nables. This approach essentially defines a reduced-form approach.\nAmong the covariates tapping cultural differences, the model\nincludes measures of the nativity of each spouse, time since im-\nmigration for foreign-born respondents, familiarity with English,\nreligiosity; and whether the couple lives outside an urban area as\nwell as self-reported race-ethnicity. Holding all else constant, we\nwould expect that foreign-born persons, more recent immigrants,\nand those not fluent in English would be more inclined to pro-\nvide financial assistance to kin of any kind, even at the expense\nof own consumption. Similarly, those with strong religious tradi-\ntions have stronger norms of familial altruism, independent of\ntheir capacity to give or the perceived needs of their relatives. We\nalso include a measure of whether either spouse has received a\nsubstantial financial gift ($ 10,000 or more) in the past, to capture\na sense of reciprocity or tradition of giving within the family\n(Stark, 1995). In addition to the socioeconomic indicators and\nmeasures of cultural diversity, the model includes the race-ethnic-\nity categories as proxy for unobserved factors, as well as interac-\ntions of race-ethnicity with total number of children.\nAnalysis\nThe dependent variable represents a set of mutually exclu-\nsive choices of recipients that are unordered. We estimate the\nmodel using a multinomial logit specification, and use a\nHausman test to evaluate the assumption of independence of ir-\nrelevant alternatives (IIA) following Greene (1993). We fail to\nreject the equality between the coefficients of the full model\nand the coefficients of the models excluding each alternative (p\nvalues of 1.0). Thus, we find evidence that the IIA assumption\nis appropriate for our data, and use the multinomial coefficients\nto calculate the relative risk ratio (RRR) of outcome m with re-\nspect to outcome n for Blacks versus Whites and Hispanics ver-\nsus Whites, holding all else constant. For example, the RRR for\nBlacks relative to Whites, conditional on the vector of explana-\ntory variables X, is given by the expression:\n~ CXp >\nOdds(m/n)(X,Blacks)\nOdds(m/n)(X, Whites) ~_CXp >TM [\n- e X P \\Pblack, mM)\nTesting the null hypothesis that the RRR's equal unity allows\nus to address the question of whether the differences in the odds\nof outcome m, say giving only to parents, relative to the odds of\noutcome n, say giving only to children, is statistically signifi-\ncant between any two groups, say between Blacks and Whites.\nThe RRR has the advantage that it does not depend on the spe-\ncific values of the explanatory variables, and is insensitive to\nthe absolute magnitude of the estimated probability of choosing\nany alternative (Long, 1997). Comparisons across racial-ethnic\ngroups using the RRR's allow us to contrast the probability of\none outcome over another rather than variation in the probabil-\nity of a single outcome across groups.\nRESULTS\nFinancial Assistance to Children and Parents\nTable 2 shows the structure of intergenerational families in\nwhich the middle-aged married or partnered couple have at\nleast one child and one or more surviving parents. There are\ndistinct racial-ethnic differences in the size and composition of\nthe pool of kin with potential claims on the resources of mid-\ndle-aged donors. Hispanics have more offspring, on average,\nthan comparably aged Black and White couples. About two out\nof five Hispanic couples, for example, have five or more chil-\ndren, compared to 35% of Blacks and only 21% of middle-aged\nWhite couples. White and Hispanic couples are more likely\nthan comparable Black couples to have living parents on both\nsides of the family (36% of Whites and Hispanics compared to\n29% of Blacks). Overall, middle-aged Hispanic couples are\nmore likely to be sandwiched between large families of procre-\nation (three or more children) and origin of both the husband\nand Blacks, respectively).\nTable 1, discussed previously, also shows the distribution of\nattributes of sampled couples and their offspring and living par-\nents by race-ethnicity. There is greater diversity and concentra-\ntion of need in Hispanic families than within Black and White\nfamilies. Hispanics and Blacks (22% and 32%, respectively)\nare more likely than Whites (13%) to have at least one child\nyounger than age 18 who is presumably dependent on the refer-\nence generation. Hispanics also are more likely to have at least\none child aged 18 or older still in school, and at least one parent\nwho requires personal care or supervision.\nThe resource base of middle-aged Blacks and Hispanics is\nmore constrained and their health, poorer on average, than that\nof White couples. Hispanics have much lower levels of educa-\ntion than Blacks or Whites, and their median net worth of cou-\nples with both children and surviving parents is appreciably\nfor Black couples). Non-Hispanic couples, however, are more\nlikely to report that one or another spouse/partner is chronically\nTable 2.

Even in comparison to contributions to\ncharities, financial assistance to parents is rare. For the total\nsample of couples (not shown), nearly two fifths gave financial\nassistance only to their children, and one fifth make financial\ncontributions to only charity. About 30% provide assistance to\nno one; 4.5% make financial transfers only to parents and an-\nother 8% help both children and parents.\nThere are important racial differences in transfer patterns as\nwell. White couples are more likely to report giving assistance\nonly to children (42%) than Blacks or Hispanics (29% and 21%,\nrespectively). Whites, however, are less likely (3%) to assist only\ntheir parents than either Blacks (6%) or Hispanics (12%),\nwhereas Hispanics are less likely to contribute to charity (12%),\ncompared to Whites (20%) and Blacks (24%). Consistent with\nracial-ethnic differences in wealth, Whites report overall larger\ngifts among those who madefinancialtransfers exceeding $500.\nAmong couples who gave assistance to a particular type of re-\ncipient, the largest gifts benefit children, whereas contributions\nto charity and to parents are roughly of similar magnitude.\nWhites gave a median annual transfer to children of $3,000 com-\npared to $1,500 for Blacks and Hispanics. Help to parents has a\nfor Hispanics. Gifts to religious organizations, charities, or oth-\nBlacks, and $660 for Hispanics.\nThese descriptive data suggest distinct racial-ethnic differ-\nences in four aspects of financial giving. First, the sheer num-\nbers of living children and parents indicate potentially greater\npressure on the resources of middle-aged Black and Hispanic\ncouples than those of Whites. Second, children and parents of\nHispanics and Blacks are more disadvantaged in socioeco-\nnomic resources and health status than Whites, suggesting more\npotential claims on thefinancialresources of middle-aged cou-\nples. Third, potential donor couples who are Hispanic and\nBlack have fewer socioeconomic resources than Whites, sug-\ngesting that minority couples are less able to respond to de-\nmands on their resources from children and parents. Fourth, the\nobserved (unadjusted) allocation of assistance from middle-\naged couples varies across the three racial-ethnic groups.\nWhites are the most likely to assist only their children;\nHispanics, the most likely to assist only their parents and the\nleast likely to contribute to charities.\nMultivariate Models ofAssistance\nThe multinomial logit coefficients are presented in Table 3\nfor the five-outcomes model and are discussed briefly to con-\nserve space. The table presents the estimates averaged over the\nfive multiple imputes of parental wealth, and the significance\nreported corresponds to the average coefficient. Overall, the\nmultivariate results indicate that the socioeconomic covariates\nas well as those capturing cultural differences are important for\nexplaining the allocation of financial transfers by middle-aged\ncouples. Assistance to parents is highly responsive to parental\nwealth and health and negatively related to children being\nyoung or in school. The odds of assisting only parents relative\nto helping only children increase if the wife's parent(s) is frail.\nThe odds decline significantly if the husband's parents are\nwealthy, if the couple has adult children in school, and if the\ncouple received a largefinancialgift in the past.\nAssisting parents and children is negatively associated with\nparental wealth, positively with parental frailty and the donors'\nwealth, and with variables capturing cultural differences. The\nodds of assisting bothparents and children compared to finan-\ncially assisting only children increase when the wife's or the\nhusband's parent(s) is sick, at higher levels of wealth of the\ncouple, and if the wife is foreign-born. The odds decline, how-\never, if the husband's or wife's parent(s) is wealthy, or if the\nmiddle-aged couple previously received a largefinancialgift.\nGiving to charity or religious organizations by middle-aged\ncouples is influenced by cultural factors, including religiosity\nand English languagefluency,and whether children have com-\npeting claims. The couples' propensity to provide for their own\nconsumption rather than financially assist children varies with\noffspring needs, own wealth, parental wealth, and cultural fac-\ntors. The odds of financially helping no one rather than assist-\ning children decrease with wealth of the couple but increase if\nno adult children are in school, among other factors.\nThe multivariate results also show that, holding all else con-\nstant--including other cultural covariates--the allocation of fi-\nnancial transfers is associated with race and ethnicity. We use\nthe multinomial estimates to derive relative risk ratios (RRR)\nfor Blacks compared to Whites, and Hispanics compared to\nWhites (Long, 1997). The RRR's are presented in Table 4, in\nwhich the odds of giving only to children is fixed at 1.00, al-\nthough any category could have been chosen as the reference\nwithout changing the substantive conclusions. The RRR be-\ntween any other two alternatives can be obtained from those\nshown in Table 4. The relative risk of assisting only parents\nover helping no one, for example, is 2.71 times greater for\nThe first row of Table 4 indicates that, in relative terms,\nBlacks are more likely than Whites to give only to children.\nThe odds of assisting both children and parents (0.96), charities\n(0.84), or no one (0.58), relative to assisting only children are\nsignificantly lower for Blacks than they are for Whites.

Adjusting\nfor all other factors, including education and wealth, Blacks are\nmore likely than Whites to allocate resources to their parents\nrather than their own consumption. Both Blacks and Whites,\nhowever, favor giving only to children or parents equally in rel-\native terms: the odds ratio of assisting children over parents is\nsimilar for both groups.\nThe second row of Table 4 shows Hispanic-White contrasts\nin the relative risk of choosing other types of transfer options\ncompared with assisting only children, holding all else con-\nstant. Relative to White couples, Hispanics have only two thirds\n(.65) the odds of preferring their parents over their own chil-\ndren. Hispanics are no more likely than Whites to prefer chari-\ntable giving or own consumption over assisting their children.\nHispanics, however, are less likely than Whites to provide for\ntheir parents at the expense of their own consumption.\nWe hypothesized previously that all race-ethnic groups favor\ntransfers to their children over their parents. Although the unad-\njusted probabilities are consistent with this prediction, a more\ncomplex picture emerges after controlling for donor and poten-\ntial recipient traits.

Significance of the difference between two race-ethnic groups:\nchildren and parents directly affect the patterns of transfers. We\nalso hypothesized that Hispanics and Blacks are more likely to\nmake transfers to their parents than Whites. Our findings sup-\nport this hypothesis only with respect to Blacks; Hispanics are\nless likely to favor their parents than are Whites.\nDISCUSSION\nThis article examines differences across racial-ethnic groups in\nhow middle-aged couples allocate financial resources among\ncompeting claims from younger and older kin. Behavioral differ-\nences are revealed which yield valuable insights into the culture of\ngiving in three-generation families and racial-ethnic differences\ntherein. Our analyses indicate that children are favored as recipi-\nents of financial assistance but that circumstances in which both\nchildren and elderly parents compete for financial resources di-\nrectly affect inter-vivos giving among middle-aged couples. Our\nfindings also indicate that patterns of financial assistance to kin re-\nflect both socioeconomic conditions within a family and cultural\ndifferences: the unadjusted differences across racial-ethnic groups\nare markedly different from those revealed by the adjusted analy-\nsis. Most notably, the unadjusted analysis indicates mat Hispanic\ndonors are more likely than other ethnic or racial groups to assist\nonly parents, whereas holding all else constant, Hispanic donors\nare the least likely to assist parents in comparison to Blacks or\nWhites. Multivariate controls include wealth of both potential re-\ncipients and donors, as well as indicators of the donors' accultura-\ntion and differential filial or religious obligations. After controlling\nfor these and other factors, racial/ethnic self-identity is still signifi-\ncant in explainingfinancialtransfer behaviors. We interpret this to\nmean that there are unmeasured sources of variation, correlated\nwith racial-ethnic self-identity, which explain differences in ob-\nserved transfer behaviors. Furthermore, our results suggest that\nthere are three distinct patterns of giving represented by the three\nracial-ethnic groups we consider. Although Blacks and Hispanics\nshare many socioeconomic disadvantages, middle-aged couples\nin these two groups have distinct patterns of allocating financial\nassistance to family and others.\nIn balancing the demands of children and parents, we find\nthat Black middle-aged couples are more likely than Whites to\nassist only their children or only their parents rather than con-\ntribute to their own consumption. Hispanics more than Whites\nfavor their own consumption over helping only their parents.\nThese results suggest that among the three racial-ethnic groups\nwe have considered, Blacks and Whites are the most likely--\nand Hispanics the least likely--to financially favor assisting\ntheir parents compared with assisting their children. In addition,\nBlacks are the most likely to sacrifice their own consumption to\nfinancially help parents, and Hispanics, the least likely. Shifts in\nthe generational distribution of demands because of market\nforces (e.g., increased rates of unemployment) or public policy\ninitiatives (e.g., decreasing Social Security benefits for elderly\nparents) may reduce savings and/or consumption by middle-\naged couples. Black families would be more likely to feel such\neffects, all else being equal.\nLimitations of the study need to be considered. The HRS\nbaseline used a $500 threshold to identify households that made\nnon-trivial annual financial transfers. McGarry and Schoeni\n(1995) have examined possible biases associated with this cen-\nsor. They argue that respondents may inflate their actual trans-\nfers to children largely because of the perceived social desir-\nability of giving to offspring. Transfers to parents would be less\naffected by respondent overstatement. Poor families also may\nbe underrepresented in studies of transfer behaviors because of\nthe relatively high threshold. If correct, these arguments would\nimply that the estimated probability of giving to children would\noverstate the \"true\" probability in the current sample of couples\nwith children and parents. Estimated probabilities of assisting\nparents would be largely unaffected. The primary implications\nof McGarry and Schoeni's (1995) arguments would center on\nthe racial-ethnic contrasts between giving to offspring relative\nto giving to parents. This contrast was not significant in the\nBlack-White comparison, but significant for Hispanic versus\nWhite (Table 4) but not in the direction McGarry and Schoeni's\nanalysis would suggest.\nIt is possible that among Hispanics the patterns of assisting\nparents reflect the distance--physical or cultural--separating\nmiddle-aged couples from their parents. It is also possible that\ncloser family ties among Hispanics are manifest through time-\ntransfers or coresidence rather thanfinancialtransfers. Middle-\naged couples in our sample, however, do not seem to substitute\nhours of parent care for financial transfers. Among couples in\nwhich at least one parent is frail, the percentage providing hours\nof care is higher among those who also provide financial help\n(28%) than among those who do not give financial assistance\n(10.3%). In addition, coresidence with parents is extremely\nrare; only 2.8% of couples live with a parent of either spouse.\nAnother limitation of our analysis on giving behavior is that\nthe results apply only to middle-aged couples; there are racial-\nethnic differences in the propensity to be legally married or part-\nnered. Black respondents are less likely to be part of a couple\nthan Hispanics orWhites. These self-selected subsets of individ-\nuals have higher socioeconomic profiles than the overall Black\npopulation. Our results indicate mat this middle-aged group of\nBlack couples protect their kin rather than their own consump-\ntion. For all middle-aged couples an unanswered question is\nhow their own post-retirement wealth will be affected by the fi-\nnancial pressures from younger and older kin in middle age.\nControlling for socioeconomic factors (such as wealth, edu-\ncation, family size, and structure), health, and cultural factors\n(such as religion, nativity, language), the discrete demographic\ncharacterization of race-ethnicity retains statistical significance\nin a model of family allocation across generational lines. To in-\nform the sources of these racial-ethnic differences, further re-\nsearch needs to refine measurement of the factors that we in-\ncluded in our model, and make explicit those that are\nunmeasured. In addition to identifying unmeasured factors prox-\nied by the race-ethnicity categories, which can be as amorphous\nas a \"culture of giving\" crossing generational lines, or as specific\nas restricted access to health care services, future research on\nprivate inter-vivos transfers should aim to incorporate better\nmeasures of the availability of public transfers among potential\nrecipients. We were able to partially take the latter into account\nby including a proxy for the recipient's wealth, but this approach\nspecifies neither eligibility for nor receipt of public benefits.\n"
