Much of this research has taken the form of population-level research\ncomparing men's attitudes and behavior around romantic partnering between areas with\ndiffering sex ratios. This research has demonstrated that men's partner selectivity increases\nwhen the proportion of women in the population increases (Abramitzky, Delavande, and\nVasconcelos, 2010). This selectivity has been operationalized in diverse ways. Research\ncomparing regions in China with varied sex ratios has demonstrated that when available\nfemale partners are relatively more abundant, men are less likely to engage commercial sex\nworkers, although they are likely to engage in more and more frequent sexual encounters\noutside of marriage (South and Trent, 2010); avoiding partnering that includes an explicit\nfinancial cost constitutes greater selectivity. Other research indicates that when available\nPartner selectivity and the media\nfemale partners are relatively scarce, men are more likely to marry young, presumably\nmotivated to secure an available partner against relatively less certain future mating\nopportunities (Kruger and Schlemmer, 2009); men are less likely to avoid partners who\ninsist on marriage, indicating relatively lower selectivity. This also results in women\nmarrying younger in populations characterized by sex ratios that skew male (Kruger,\nAlthough such studies document important and clear patterns, experimental\nexploration may provide added insight. Recent research, for example, examined women's\npreferences for facial symmetry in men after viewing images of crowds in which sex ratios\nvaried, revealing that women became more selective in their preferences when they\nperceived an abundance of men (Watkins, et al., 2012). The present study seeks to extend\nexperimental exploration of the impact of sex ratios in two ways: first, it examines the\nimpact on men, and second, it examines the effects of sex ratios in media narratives rather\nthan either real populations or still images.\nPartner selectivity can refer to choosing or avoiding partners based on any desirable\nor undesirable trait or series of traits. Some research has documented selective preferences\norganized around social status or resources\nThis preference for greater physical beauty in mating partners is likely derived from\nlinks between physical beauty and reproductive fitness and the reproductive potential of\noffspring. Some aspects of physical beauty are readily understood to be linked to such\nfitness; low waist-to-hip ratio in women has been linked both to physical ability to\nprocreate and to greater perceived attractiveness by members of the opposite sex (Singh,\n1993). Physical beauty may also signal overall fitness and reproductive potential (Etcoff,\n2000). Even if it does not signal broader reproductive fitness, inasmuch as attractive\nindividuals attract more partners or resources, attractiveness confers an evolutionary\nadvantage by increasing likely reproductive success for the attractive individual as well as\ntheir progeny (see Fisher, 1930). The use of physical beauty as a signal for other desirable\ntraits is also widespread; attractive individuals are consistently perceived to be more\ncapable, skilled, intelligent, and socially adept than are less attractive individuals (Asch,\nInasmuch as sex ratio influences partner selectivity, that selectivity is likely to manifest as\ndifferential selectivity based on physical attractiveness.\n(see Pollett and Nettle, 2008), but for both men\nand women, selectivity frequently refers to the requirements or expectations of physical\nattractiveness for potential partners. Among men, the physical attractiveness of a potential\nromantic or sexual partner is a key determinant of interest in that partner; more physically\nattractive individuals are more appealing as romantic and sexual partners (Kurzban and\napplied to physical appearance, means that more selective men set a higher standard of\nphysical attractiveness for potential partners (Back et al., 2011; Buston and Emlen, 2003).\nThe theory of biological markets offers insight into how considerations of sex ratio\ninfluence romantic and sexual partnering. Market theory states that partner choice in\nmating, as in other reciprocal or mutual relationships, is strongly governed by\nconsiderations of supply and demand (Noe and Hammerstein, 1994). The law of supply and\ndemand states that where demand remains static, as the supply of a good increases, the\nPartner selectivity and the media\nvalue of that good declines. Thus, a surplus of available partners of one sort results in\ngreater potential selectivity among complementary partners as the value of each is\nsomewhat diminished. In the present case of men's selectivity regarding physical\nappearance in sexual and romantic relationships, this principle of supply and demand\nwould be expected to result in men's standards of attractiveness increasing as sex ratios\nbecome more skewed in men's favor (i.e., more women than men).\nGiven that time and resources that can be devoted to seeking, securing, and\nsupporting a partner are finite, to optimize reproductive success, m\nAlthough past research has generally focused on sex ratios in populations, there is\nreason to believe that mediated depictions of skewed sex ratios may also influence partner\nselection. Mediated images and narratives depicting skewed sex ratios have, for example,\nbeen shown to influence women's partner selectivity and trait preferences (Taylor, 2011;\nWatkins et al., 2012). The impact on men is less clear; exploring the same is the object of\nthe present study. Representations suggesting the scarcity or abundance of potential\npartners for men are common in popular media. Romantic comedies, for example, use the\n`love triangle' as a staple plot device. Male characters sometimes compete over a single\npotential female partner (e.g., Win a Date with Tad Hamilton, Bridget Jones's Diary),\nsuggesting partner scarcity for men in the audience. Other media depict women competing\nover a single potential male partner (e.g., My Best Friend's Wedding, The Wedding\nPlanner), suggesting partner abundance for men in the audience. Inasmuch as media\ncontent has been found to influence perceptions of social reality (Aubrey and Taylor, 2009;\nit was hypothesized that exposure to media messages about partner scarcity or abundance\nwould influence men's partner selectivity. Specifically, it was hypothesized that men\nexposed to messages depicting a scarcity of romantic partners would be relatively less\nselective regarding potential romantic and sexual partners, whereas those exposed to\nmessages depicting an abundance of romantic partners would be relatively more selective.\nen would be expected to\nhave evolved a tendency to seek the highest-value partner possible. An environment\ncharacterized by abundant partners would mean a greater supply, facilitating greater\npotential selectivity. Men who respond to such situations by applying greater selectivity\nwould tend to secure more attractive partners and produce, on average, more attractive and\nhealthier offspring, improving reproductive fitness. On the other hand, an environment\ncharacterized by scarce partners would mean a diminished supply, suggesting diminished\nselectivity. Men who respond to such situations by being less selective would have a\ngreater likelihood of securing a mate and passing on their genes, at least relative to men\nwho, in the same circumstances, maintained a higher degree of selectivity. Indeed, research\nhas documented that in environments with skewed sex ratios, those in the scarce sex are\nmore selective when choosing partners (Abramitzky et al., 2010; Kruger and Schlemmer,\n2009; South and Trent, 2010), and recent experimental research has shown that perceived\nsex ratios shape that selectivity (Watkins et al., 2012).\nAnother aspect of partner selection likely to function in tandem with selectivity is\nromantic confidence. Romantic confidence (RC) is defined as the perception of one's own\nworth as a romantic or sexual partner as well as expectations of others' estimation of that\nworth. RC is, therefore, the degree to which one is assured one can attract desirable\nPartner selectivity and the media\nromantic or sexual partners (Aubrey and Taylor, 2009). Evidence suggests that RC\ninfluences the nature of romantic and sexual relationships that men pursue (Penke, Todd,\nLenton, and Fasolo, 2007). For example, in one study, men who perceived themselves as\nhaving higher value as romantic partners were more likely to exhibit a preference for short-\nterm partnering strategies, especially with relatively more physically attractive partners,\nthan were men with less self-perceived mate value (Landolt, Lalumiere, and Quinsey,\nRC may also be sensitive to partner scarcity or abundance. Relatively more\nabundant partnering opportunities would be expected to increase RC as men recognized\ntheir increased value in the romantic-partner marketplace. Conversely, as partners become\nscarce, men would realize that their value was diminished and experience less RC.\nInasmuch as RC shapes mating behavior, having RC that is responsive to partner scarcity\nor abundance would confer a reproductive advantage over nonresponsive RC as men\nresponded more quickly or effectively to changing sex ratios. Past research has found that\nmen's RC is influenced by cues pertaining to mate availability; in one study, men who saw\nimages of highly attractive women experienced diminished RC (Aubrey and Taylor, 2009).\nIt was therefore hypothesized that men exposed to messages depicting a scarcity of\nromantic partners would exhibit relatively lower RC, whereas men exposed to messages\ndepicting an abundance of romantic partners would exhibit relatively greater RC.\nAnother outcome likely related to both perceptions of partner scarcity or abundance\nand RC is self-perceived attractiveness. Physical attractiveness has been shown to be linked\nto partner selectivity among women (Little and Mannion, 2006) and more physically\nattractive men tend to exhibit greater selectivity in choosing romantic partners (Back et al.,\n2011; Buston and Emlen, 2003). Men who perceive themselves as relatively less attractive\nhave also been found to be more likely to consider less attractive women as potential\nromantic and sexual partners (Stroebe, Insko, Thompson, and Layton, 1971). This pattern\ntends to result in assortative mating, as most dating and married couples are roughly\ncomparable in their degree of attractiveness (Buss and Barnes, 1986; Watson et al., 2004).\nFurthermore, past research has found that exposure to select types of media content result\nin both diminished RC and negative body image in men (Aubrey and Taylor, 2009) and\ndiminished partner selectivity and negative self-assessments of attractiveness in women\n(Little and Mannion, 2006). Self-perceived attractiveness may contribute to the arrival at\nthe optimal or appropriate degree of selectivity for reproduction; knowing one's value in\nthe biological marketplace allows one to respond to market conditions, as it were, more\nappropriately. Men exposed to messages depicting a scarcity of romantic partners were\ntherefore expected to perceive themselves as relatively less physically attractive, whereas\nmen exposed to messages depicting an abundance of romantic partners were expected to\nperceive themselves as relatively more physically attractive.\nImportantly, other factors are likely to moderate the impact of perceived partner\nscarcity or abundance on partner selectivity and RC. Past research has demonstrated, for\nexample, that various traits identified with masculinity such as height (Buunk, Park,\nZurriaga, Klavina, and Massar, 2008), 2D:4D digit ratio (Park, Wieling, Buunk, and\nMassar, 2008), and social dominance (Watkins, Jones, and DeBruine, 2010) are associated\nwith decreased sensitivity to mate competition cues in the environment. Similar traits may\nPartner selectivity and the media\nmake men less likely to respond to sex ratio cues, or to respond in a different manner. Such\nvariation in responsiveness is, essentially, adaptive; men high in social dominance may be\nable to secure more desirable partners under diverse circumstances, even in relatively\npartner-scarce environments.\nOne trait that has been linked to a range of outcomes related to sex and partnering is\nendorsement of traditional masculinity ideology (TMI). TMI involves a constellation of\nbeliefs about male gender roles, including expectations for male dominance, strength,\ncompetence, and sexual assertiveness. Endorsement of TMI has been found to be\nassociated with a greater number of sexual partners (Pleck, Sonenstein, and Ku, 1993), less\nemotionally intimate relationships (Pleck et al., 1993), lower quality relationships (Tager\nand Good, 2005; Wade and Donis, 2007), negative attitudes towards condom use (Noar and\nMorokoff, 2002; Pleck et al., 1993), and attitudes more accepting of aggression against\none's romantic or sexual partner (Fitzpatrick, Salgado, Suvak, King, and King, 2004). Each\nof these seems to reflect an expectation of partner abundance. It is therefore possible that\nsuch expectations may moderate the impact of exposure to media messages regarding\npartner abundance or scarcity. A question was therefore posed as to how endorsement of\nTMI would influence the impact of partner abundance or scarcity messages on partner\nselectivity, RC, and self-perceived attractiveness.\nTo test these hypotheses and explore this research question, the following\nexperiment was conducted.\nMaterials and Methods\nSample\nParticipants were 121 male college undergraduates who participated in exchange for\na small amount of extra credit in introductory communication courses. Mean age of\nProcedure\nParticipants were recruited for a study of `reactions to media content.' After\narriving at the study site, participants read and signed an informed consent form and were\nthen presented with a short questionnaire. After completing measures of demographics,\nmedia preferences, and media use, participants were told that they would watch a pair of\nshort media presentations to which they would be asked to respond. A video presentation\nwas then shown on a large-screen television. After each, participants were asked to respond\nto the media content, indicating their familiarity with the program or film and the degree to\nwhich they perceived it as interesting, engaging, and enjoyable. Participants were then\ngiven an additional questionnaire and told that it would allow greater insight into their\nreaction to the media content. This second questionnaire, in addition to filler items,\nincluded measures of romantic confidence, romantic selectivity, and self-reported physical\nattractiveness. After completing all measures, participants were debriefed, thanked, and\ndismissed.\nResearch protocols and materials were approved by the Institutional Review Board\nof the author's university before data collection began.\nPartner selectivity and the media\nStimuli\nStimuli were narratives from a British soap opera East Enders. This source was\nchosen for the development of the experimental stimuli because it was assumed that U.S.\nparticipants would be unfamiliar with the story, the characters, and even the actors, thus\nreducing the likelihood that other associations or prior knowledge would confound the\neffects of either stimulus. Two 10-minute narratives were used. Participants in the partner\nscarcity condition viewed a story of two male characters pursuing the same woman; one is\na co-worker, the other her boyfriend. The two men are shown flirting with her, vying for\nher affection, and engaging in some minor deception and violence to one-up one another.\nParticipants in the partner abundant condition watched a story of two women arguing over\none man, each vowing loyalty to and love for that one man. One woman was his estranged\nwife for whom he seems to still have feelings, the other his current romantic and sexual\npartner. Participants in the control condition watched narratives with no romantic or sexual\nrelationship content; specifically, they watched a movie trailer for a nature documentary\nand a cartoon featuring an androgynous squirrel obsessing over an acorn.\nPre-testing with participants drawn from the same population as the study sample\nfound the soap opera narratives in the two experimental conditions to be comparable in the\nMeasures\nRelationship status was measured as participants were asked to indicate the level of\ncommitment in their current romantic relationship, from 0 (single, not involved\nromantically with anyone) to 6 (married). An option to indicate `other' was also available,\nbut unused by any participant. Most participants reported being either not dating anyone (n\nseriously dating one person exclusively (n = 36, 29.8%) or cohabiting or being engaged or\nmarried to a single partner (n = 16, 13.2%). For purposes of analyses, individuals in\ncommitted, long-term relationships (e.g., dating exclusively and seriously or more serious)\nwere analyzed as one group, individuals in casual or no relationship as another.\nEndorsement of TMI was measured using the male role attitudes scale (Pleck,\nSonenstein, and Ku, 1993). This instrument consists of 8 statements regarding masculine\nroles (e.g., \"Men are always ready for sex,\" \"A guy will lose respect if he talks about his\nproblems,\" and \"It bothers me when a guy acts like a girl\"). Participants responded to each\non a 4-item scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Responses from all 8\nitems were averaged to form a single measure of TMI (M = 2.54, SD = .52,  = .74). For\npurposes of analysis, this was dichotomized using a median split, resulting in a group\nrelatively low in endorsement of TMI and a group relatively high in the same.\nSelectivity in romantic and sexual partners was measured as participants were asked\nto set a minimum standard of attractiveness for such partners. Specifically, participants\nwere asked to indicate, using a 10-point scale, the \"lowest degree of attractiveness\nacceptable for a woman\" for her to be considered for a dating relationship (M = 6.51, SD =\nRomantic confidence was measured in a manner similar to that employed by\nPartner selectivity and the media\nAubrey and Taylor (2009) and Hirt, Zillmann, Erickson, and Kennedy (1992). Participants\nwere presented with images of four attractive, young, adult women and asked to anticipate\nthe pictured individual's response to three social overtures. Specifically, they were asked to\nestimate the likelihood that each woman would talk with them if they approached her after\na class, the likelihood that she would let them buy her a drink at a bar if they asked, and the\nlikelihood that she would go on a date (i.e., dinner and a movie) if asked. Responses were\nmade on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all likely) to 5 (extremely likely). The 12 items were\naveraged, resulting in a measure of romantic confidence (M = 3.29, SD = .81,  = .93).\nSelf-perceived attractiveness was measured with a single item in which participants\nwere asked to rate their own attractiveness on a 10-point scale, with higher scores reflecting\ngreater attractiveness (M = 7.31, SD = 1.24). Past research has demonstrated the validity of\nsimilar 10-point ratings of physical attractiveness (Lee, Loewenstein, Ariely, Hong, and\nResults\nA mixed-factor MANOVA was employed to explore the impact of partner scarcity\nand abundance messages on partner selectivity. Between-subjects factors were\nexperimental condition (control vs. scarce partners vs. abundant partners) and endorsement\nof TMI (low vs. high). The within-subjects factor was relationship type for the partner for\nwhich a standard was indicated (date vs. marry vs. have sex with). Relationship status was\nemployed as a covariate.\nIn this analysis, the test of within-subjects effects indicated a main effect for\nmultiple comparisons with the Bonferroni correction, indicated that this reflected\nsignificantly lower standards of attractiveness for a sex partner (M = 6.12, SD = 1.54) than\n1.41). Participants were also significantly less selective regarding a dating partner than a\nmarriage partner. There was no significant interaction between the within-subjects factor\nand experimental condition, F (4, 228) = 1.18, p = .32 or between the within-subjects factor\nExamining between-subjects effects, a main effect for endorsement of TMI was\nobserved, F (1, 114) = 4.89, p < .05, reflective of relatively greater selectivity among men\nrespectively). Although there was no main effect of experimental condition on selectivity,\nthe interaction between condition and endorsement of TMI was significant, F (2, 114) =\n11.55, p < .001. Planned post-hoc comparisons within each TMI group indicated that,\namong men who endorsed lower levels of TMI, participants in both the partner scarce\nexhibited significantly less selectivity than participants in the control condition (M = 7.22,\nSD = .122). Among participants higher in endorsement of TMI, those in the abundant\npartner condition (M = 7.57, SD = 1.24) exhibited greater selectivity than those in the\nscarce partner condition (M = 6.47, SD = 1.23), though neither differed significantly from\nPartner selectivity and the media\nANOVA was employed to examine effects of experimental manipulation on RC\nand self-perceived attractiveness. In each case, factors were experimental condition (control\nvs. scarce partners vs. abundant partners) and endorsement of TMI (low vs. high).\nRelationship status was employed as a covariate.\nA main effect of experimental condition on RC was observed, F (2, 114) = 5.19, p <\n.01. Planned post-hoc comparisons with the Bonferroni correction indicated that\nparticipants in both the scarce-partner condition (M = 3.06, SD = .83) and the abundant-\npartner condition (M = 3.24, SD = .82) exhibited significantly less romantic confidence\nthan participants in the control condition (M = 3.60, SD = .78). The difference between the\nscarce- and abundant-partner conditions was not statistically significant. The interaction\nbetween experimental condition and endorsement of TMI approached, but did not achieve,\nA main effect of experimental condition on self-assessments of attractiveness was\nalso observed, F (2, 114) = 3.38, p < .05. Participants in the scarce partner condition (M =\n7.01, SD = 1.16) viewed themselves as significantly less attractive than participants in the\ncontrol condition (M = 7.67, SD = 1.14), with the abundant partner resulting in self-\nassessments significantly different from both (M = 7.35, SD = 1.15). This main effect was\nqualified, however, by a significant interaction between experimental condition and\neach TMI group indicated that among men with lower endorsement of TMI, participants in\nthe abundant partner condition (M = 6.54, SD = 1.13) viewed themselves as significantly\nless attractive than participants in the control condition (M = 7.67, SD = 1.16), with the\nscarce partner resulting in self-assessments significantly different from both (M = 7.06, SD\n= 1.08). Among participants high in endorsement of TMI, however, participants in the\nabundant partner condition viewed themselves as significantly more attractive (M = 8.17,\nSD = 1.16) than participants in the scarce partner condition (M = 6.97, SD = 1.16), though\nneither differed significantly from the control participants (M = 7.48, SD = 1.14).\nMediation analysis was conducted to explore a possible meditational role of self-\nassessed attractiveness and RC on partner selectivity. The bootstrapping technique\nadvocated by Preacher and Hayes (2004) was employed.\nIn order to account for the moderating role of TMI, two separate mediation analyses\nwere conducted, one for low-TMI participants and one for high-TMI participants. In each\ncase, experimental condition was recoded employing `effect coding,' so that the abundance\ncondition was coded `1,' the partner scarce condition `-1,' and the control condition `0'.\nBoth RC and self-assessed attractiveness were entered as potential mediators, partner\nselectivity as the dependent variable, and relationship status as a covariate. 1000 bootstrap\nsamples were employed for each analysis. Bias-corrected confidence intervals for the\nindirect effect of condition on selectivity through each proposed mediator were calculated\nfor each; where the confidence interval does not include zero, the indirect effect is\nsignificant and the overall relationship is mediated by the proposed mediator.\nFor participants high in TMI, self-assessed attractiveness partially mediated the\neffect of experimental condition on partner selectivity (95% CI: .10, .58); RC did not (95%\nCI: -.11, .14). For participants low in TMI, neither self-assessed attractiveness (95% CI: -\nPartner selectivity and the media\nselectivity.\nDiscussion\nIn a laboratory experiment, viewing media representations of partner scarcity and\nabundance in the form of soap opera narratives was shown to influence the partner\nselectivity, RC, and self-assessed physical attractiveness of male undergraduates. This was\nmoderated by endorsement of traditional masculine ideology.\nRomantic confidence was observed to be influenced by viewing representations of\npartner scarcity and abundance. Consistent with expectations, men who viewed a soap\nopera narrative that emphasized the scarcity of available, appropriate female romantic\npartners by depicting male competition over a single prospective mate exhibited less\nromantic confidence than men who watched no romantic narrative. Contrary to\nexpectations, however, watching a narrative that inverted the pattern, showing female\ncompetition over a single prospective male partner, also resulted in relatively lower\nromantic confidence. One possible explanation lies in the nature of both narratives. Each\nnarrative, for example, dealt with complex, difficult romantic relationships. Men viewing\neither presentation might have been reminded of the difficulties of such relationships and\ntherefore lost confidence in their ability to successfully conduct them. In some ways, this\nechoes the findings of Taylor (2011), who observed a general effect of romantic narratives\non women's partner preferences that was, for some outcomes, independent of the sex ratios\nof the characters in those narratives. In this case, watching romantic soap opera narratives\naffects men's romantic confidence, generally reducing that confidence.\nAlternately, affect may play a role. Past research has documented a link between\naffect and self-views (Daskalou and Syngollitou, 2007; Ebbeck, Watkins, Concepcion,\nCardinal, and Hammermeister, 2009). Diminished romantic confidence may be associated\nwith less positive or more negative affect; this change in affective state may then result in\nlower self-assessment. Future research of the impact of romantic portrayals on self-\nassessments of attractiveness might benefit from measuring affect.\nThe impact of experimental condition on both partner selectivity and self-assessed\nphysical attractiveness were more complex, as each was dependent on endorsement of\nTMI. Among participants high in TMI endorsement, H1 was supported (i.e., watching the\nnarrative depicting women competing over the same man's romantic and sexual attention\nresulted in greater selectivity as participants set a higher threshold of attractiveness for\npotential romantic and sexual partners relative to the participants who watched the partner\nscarcity narrative). In contrast to what was observed among men high in TMI endorsement,\namong men low in endorsement of TMI, watching either romantic narrative resulted in\nlower partner selectivity.\nThe moderating role of TMI was also observed in the effects of experimental\ncondition on self-assessments of physical attractiveness. This interaction echoed the pattern\nobserved for RC. Among participants low in endorsement of TMI, men who viewed the\npartner abundant narrative assessed themselves as less attractive than men with comparable\nendorsement of TMI who watched no such narrative. Among participants higher in TMI,\nviewing the abundance narrative resulted in higher self-assessed attractiveness relative to\nPartner selectivity and the media\nwatching the scarcity narrative. Importantly, this is the first time sex ratio has been linked\nto self-assessed physical attractiveness in men.\nIn the case of both partner selectivity and self-perceived attractiveness, then, men\nhigh in TMI responded in ways consistent with the hypotheses derived from population-\nlevel studies of sex ratio and partner choice. Men low in TMI, however, demonstrated\neffects in the opposite direction, with reduced selectivity and self-perceived attractiveness\nin response to depictions of abundant partners. Several possible explanations must be\nconsidered. First, for men low in endorsement of TMI, this may reflect increased salience\nof romantic relationships in general--the narrative's emphasis on them and their difficulty\nmakes them more salient, more important, and therefore more relevant. Such salience may\ncontribute to reduced selectivity and self-perceived attractiveness in a number of ways.\nFirst, the increased perceived importance of romantic relationships may result in a\ncommensurate increase in the perceived importance of securing such a relationship, which\nbecomes more likely if standards for potential partners are lowered. Second, this added\nsalience of romantic relationships in the context of reduced RC may result in a\ngeneralization of the diminished RC to the self in general, resulting in a diminished sense\nof self-worth, including physical attractiveness, and a commensurate diminishment of\nstandards for one's partner.\nAn additional explanation may be found in the particular character of the content\nand its intersection with elements of TMI. The important trait of each narrative for the sake\nof the stated hypotheses was the depiction of scenarios in which multiple members of one\nsex were available as romantic and sexual partners for a member of the opposite sex.\nHowever, in doing so, the narratives also each depicted an established romantic couple\n(engaged and married, respectively) and a potential outside romantic or sexual potential\npartner. This may have caused infidelity and mate competition, rather than sex ratio, to\nbecome more salient for some participants. Patterns of sexual relationships for men high in\nendorsement of TMI, such as a greater number of lifetime sexual partners, less emotionally\nintimate relationships (Pleck, Sonenstein, and Ku, 1993), and a tendency to value physical\nappearance more heavily in potential partners (Sibley and Overall, 2011), may suggest a\ndistinct response to thoughts of mate competition. The individual high in TMI may think of\nmate competition scenarios as opportunities for successful competition or extra-partner\ncoupling rather than indications that relationships are difficult. Past research on partner\ncompetition has found that men often respond to mate competition scenarios in which\nmultiple men compete over a single female with elevated attention and arousal (Pound,\nMediation analysis indicated that the effects of exposure to partner abundance and\nscarcity narratives on partner selectivity was at least partially mediated by self-perceived\nattractiveness, at least for men high in endorsement of TMI. One possible explanation is\nthat, for more dominant men, self-perceived attractiveness functions as a mechanism to\nincrease selectivity. As these men see women competing over scarce male partners, their\nassessment of their own attractiveness and value increases, which in turn contributes to\nhigher selectivity. It is also possible that social comparison plays a role, and that seeing\nmultiple men competing over a single woman provides salient models for upward\ncomparison, resulting in a diminished sense of one's attractiveness and, therefore,\nPartner selectivity and the media\nselectivity regarding partners.\nEvolutionary psychology has offered explanations as to why partnering strategies\nincluding selectivity should be expected to vary with partner scarcity or availability (see\nBuss and Barnes, 1986). This responsive selectivity has, indeed, been observed in various\npopulations (Abramitzky et al., 2010; South and Trent, 2010). The present study suggests\nthat, at least for some, these shifts can be elicited by mediated representations of scarcity or\nabundance as well as real-world shifts in partner availability. Importantly, however, this\nvariation in selectivity only conformed to patterns outlined in the research literature among\nmen who scored relatively high in endorsement of TMI. Furthermore, at least one\nphenomenon was closely related to partner selectivity, namely RC, and did not conform to\nthis pattern at all; partner abundance produced the same response as partner scarcity.\nAlthough media content apparently functions as an environmental cue for evolved\nbehavioral shifts in some cases, the nature of what is cued apparently varies across\nindividuals. This may reflect the naturally occurring variation of preferred reproductive and\npartnering strategies between individuals (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000); indeed, TMI\nendorsement may be associated with one strategy more than another.\nAnother implication of these findings is that research on media influences on men's\nbody image should investigate a broader range of content types. Much of the research on\nmen's body image has focused on muscular-ideal images such as those found in muscle\nmagazines (Jonason, Krcmar, and Sohn, 2009) or video games (Harrison and Bond, 2007).\nSeveral studies have also investigated the impact of sexualized images of women (Aubrey\nand Taylor, 2009), which images are generally directed at male audiences. Although the\npresent study looks at self-assessment of attractiveness generally rather than body-image\nspecifically, it is likely that self-assessment of body composition or shape as well as related\ncognitions and emotions is part of that assessment. After all, although the genres of media\nprogramming likely to have the most salient romantic narratives, including partner scarcity\nor abundance narratives, may be directed towards principally female audiences, men watch\nand enjoy romantic comedies and soap operas (Harris, Hoekstra, Scott, Sanborn, and\nOverall, these findings echo past research in showing that media content can\ninfluence men's romantic confidence, generally by hampering that confidence.\nFurthermore, they suggest that men with different perspectives on traditional masculine\nideology are influenced differently by romantic narratives in terms of romantic confidence\nand related constructs.\nReferences\nAbramitzky, R., Delavande, A., and Vasconcelos, L.
