Croft, PhD\nBackground and Purpose--Although diabetes mellitus (DM) is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the\neffect of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) on the risk remains unclear. We determined whether IGT was associated with an\nincreased likelihood for stroke and myocardial infarction in a nationally representative sample of US adults.\nMethods--We evaluated the association between IGT (defined as a fasting glucose level of 140 mg/dL and a plasma\nglucose level of between 140 and 200 mg/dL 2 hours after administration of 75 grams of an oral glucose load) and DM\n(defined as the current use of insulin or an oral hypoglycemic medication, a fasting plasma glucose level of 140\nmg/dL, or a plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL 2 hours after administration of an oral glucose load) with a\nself-reported physician diagnosis of stroke and myocardial infarction in 6547 adults aged 40 to 74 years participating\nin the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to\ninvestigate these relationships.\nResults--IGT and DM were observed in 1494 and 1532 adults, respectively. After adjustment for differences in age,\ngender, race/ethnicity, education, hypertension, cholesterol, body mass index, and cigarette smoking, IGT was not\nassociated with stroke (odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5 to 1.6) or myocardial infarction (OR, 1.1;\nConclusions--In contrast to DM, IGT was not associated with an increased likelihood of prevalent nonfatal stroke or\nKey Words: diabetes mellitus  glucose tolerance  myocardial infarction  stroke\nAn association between asymptomatic hyperglycemia and\nCVD was suggested in 1979 in a series of papers by the\nInternational Collaborative Group, including a collective\nanalysis of 15 studies, that examined the relationship between\nIGT and CVD.1,2 More recently, it has been hypothesized that\nhyperglycemia below the level characteristic of DM may also\nbe associated with an increased risk of CVD.3 However, most\nof the studies describing an association between IGT and\nCVD were performed in populations of European origin in\nwhich CVD was found to be more prevalent in subjects with\nIGT than in normoglycemic controls.3 Controversy exists\nregarding whether the relationship between IGT and CVD is\ncausal or results from common antecedents.3 Because the\nprevalence of IGT and the rate of progression to DM varies\nwidely among populations,4 we performed this study to\nanalyze the independent association between IGT and nonfa-\ntal stroke and myocardial infarction in a nationally represen-\ntative sample of US adults.\nSubjects and Methods\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1988\nand 1994 to estimate the prevalence of common chronic conditions\nand associated risk factors among a nationally representative sample\nof the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population.5 NHANES III\nincluded a household interview; a medical examination at a mobile\nexamination center; and phlebotomy to measure a number of\nhematologic factors, including glucose and cholesterol. The study\nin the NHANES III survey at the mobile examination center.\nNHANES III participants who were examined at the mobile\nexamination center and who were not current users of insulin or oral\nhypoglycemic medications underwent a 2-hour, 75-g oral glucose\ntolerance test. Examinees provided a fasting glucose blood specimen\nand then were administered an oral glucose challenge (Dextol-75)\ncontaining the equivalent of 75 g of glucose. A second specimen was\ndrawn 2 hours after the first.\nParticipants were judged to have DM if they were current users of\ninsulin or oral hypoglycemic medication, if they had a fasting plasma\nglucose concentration 140 mg/dL, or if they had a plasma glu-\ncose 200 mg/dL 2 hours after administration of the 75-gram glucose\nchallenge.6,7 Participants were defined as having IGT if they had a\nfasting blood glucose 140 mg/dL and a plasma glucose between 140\nand 200 mg/dL 2 hours after administration of the oral glucose\nchallenge. Normal glucose tolerance (NGT) was defined as a fasting and\n2- hour-postchallenge glucose value  140 mg/dL.\nDuring the household interview participants were asked whether\nthey had ever been told by a physician that they had suffered a stroke\nFrom the Cardiovascular Health Branch, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Atlanta, Ga (W.H.G., J.B.C.), and the Division of Neurosciences Critical Care, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Md (A.I.Q.).\nCorrespondence to Wayne H.

Potential confounders in the\nassociation between IGT and stroke and myocardial infarction\nincluded age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, hypertension, cho-\nlesterol, body mass index (weight [kg]/height [m2]), and cigarette\nsmoking. Subjects were judged to be hypertensive if they were\ncurrent users of antihypertensive medication or if they had an\naverage blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg. This\naverage blood pressure was based on 3 blood pressure determina-\ntions obtained during the medical examination.\nt tests and 2 tests were used to compare groups defined by\nglucose tolerance. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were\nused to determine whether the likelihood of myocardial infarction or\nstroke differed by glucose tolerance. The logistic regression model\nadjusted for the following CVD risk factors: age, gender, race/\nethnicity, education, hypertension, cholesterol, body mass index, and\nsmoking status. To take into account the complex sampling design in\nthe NHANES III survey, SUDAAN8 was used to obtain standard\nerrors for the prevalence estimates and ORs.\nResults\nunderwent the oral glucose tolerance test. A total of 1494\npersons had IGT and 1532 had DM. Compared with persons\nwith NGT, those with IGT or DM were older and had fewer\nyears of education; had higher mean body mass index,\ncholesterol, and serum glucose values; and were more likely\nto be hypertensive (Table 1). The IGT and DM groups were\nless likely to be current smokers, while the NGT group was\nmore likely to include men. The racial/ethnic composition of\npersons with IGT was similar to that for persons with NGT;\nby contrast, there was a higher proportion of Hispanics\namong the DM group than the NGT group.\nThe unadjusted prevalence of nonfatal stroke was higher\namong the IGT and DM groups than the NGT group (Table\n2). However, the age-adjusted likelihood of stroke was\nsimilar for the IGT and the NGT groups (OR, 0.9; 95% CI,\n0.5 to 1.7). By contrast, persons with DM had a significantly\ngreater likelihood of nonfatal stroke than did persons with\nCVD risk factors did not substantially alter the risk estimates.\nThe prevalence of nonfatal myocardial infarction was also\nhigher among the IGT and DM groups than the NGT group\n(Table 3). However, the age-adjusted likelihood of myocar-\ndial infarction for persons with IGT (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7 to\n1.6) was similar to that for persons with NGT. In contrast,\npersons with DM had a significantly greater likelihood of\nmyocardial infarction than did persons with NGT (OR, 2.0;\nadjusting for CVD risk factors.\nDiscussion\nSince the introduction of IGT as a diagnostic category, there\nhas been considerable interest in the possibility that IGT\nmight be associated with an increased risk of CVD, similar to\nthe relationship between diabetes mellitus and CVD. This\nstudy in a nationally representative sample of US adults was\nunable to demonstrate any association between IGT and\nnonfatal stroke and myocardial infarction after the adjustment\nfor age and CVD risk factors.\nA number of studies have investigated the incidence and\nprevalence of CVD in subjects with IGT.9\u00ad13 All of these\nstudies used a standardized glucose tolerance test to evaluate\nhyperglycemic status, maintain uniform criteria, and avoid\nSelected Abbreviations and Acronyms\nCI  confidence interval\nCVD  cardiovascular disease\nDM  diabetes mellitus\nIGT  impaired glucose tolerance\nNGT  normal glucose tolerance\nNHANES III  Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey\nOR  odds ratio\nTABLE 1.

Although\nthere are multiple studies of European origin,9,11\u00ad14 relatively\nfew studies have been conducted in the United States.10 A\ncross-sectional study in Gothenburg found that only hyper-\ntension and heart failure were significantly associated with\nIGT; angina pectoris and stroke were not associated with\nIGT.9 A Colorado study found an increased prevalence of\ncoronary heart disease in non-Hispanic white persons with\nIGT but no association in persons of Hispanic origin.10 The\nParis Prospective Study evaluated glucose tolerance among\ndisease.11 After 11 years of follow-up, persons with IGT at\nbaseline evaluation had approximately twice the risk of CVD\nmortality as did those with NGT. The Whitehall study, which\nalso found that subjects with IGT had approximately twice\nthe risk of CVD mortality as those with NGT.12 However,\nbecause 2% to 16% of persons with IGT progress into overt\nDM annually,14,15 the increased risk for CVD noted in\nprospective studies, especially those of long duration, is\nlikely to be confounded by the undocumented development of\nDM during follow-up. This finding is supported by results\nfrom a Finnish study of elderly men aged 65 to 84 years,\nwhich reported no excess risk for CVD mortality in persons\nwith IGT during a 5-year follow-up.13 In addition to study\nduration, another potential explanation for the lack of an\nassociation between IGT and CVD may be subject age. Our\nstudy population included elderly persons, a subgroup in\nwhich two other Finnish studies also failed to demonstrate\nany association between IGT and CVD.13,16\nThe present study reported a higher prevalence of hyper-\ntension and a higher mean cholesterol level in those with IGT\ncompared with those who had NGT. These findings are\nconsistent with previous studies that have demonstrated an\nincreased frequency of CVD risk factors in persons with\nIGT.17,18 The increased prevalence of CVD risk factors among\npersons with IGT may have confounded the association\nbetween IGT and CVD reported in other studies. This finding\nis further supported by our observation\u00adbefore the adjust-\nment for age and CVD risk factors\u00adof an increased preva-\nlence of both stroke and myocardial infarction in persons with\nIGT. This association disappeared after we adjusted for the\nconfounding of age and other CVD risk factors.\nThis report is subject to a number of potential limitations.\nThe definition of stroke and myocardial infarction used in the\nNHANES III survey was based on a self-reported physician\ndiagnosis. O'Mahony et al19 validated the accuracy of assess-\ning lifetime history of stroke in a random sample of 2000\npersons aged 45 years and older using a mailed questionnaire.\nIn that study, the accuracy of the participants' self-reports of\nstroke was confirmed by a review of their medical records.\nThe sensitivity of the question was 95%, and the specificity\nspecificities (94% to 99%) have been reported for estimations\nof prevalent myocardial infarction.20,21 The questions on\nmyocardial infarction and stroke in the NHANES III survey\nmay in fact be more specific because not only was a physician\ndiagnosis inquired, but the information was acquired during a\npersonal interview rather than a mailed survey. Finally, the\nmethodology used in this study did not permit us to evaluate\nthe likelihood for fatal stroke and myocardial infarction. Fatal\nstrokes and myocardial infarctions represent less than one\nthird of all cardiovascular disease events.22\u00ad25 The exclusion\nof fatal events may have reduced our ability to detect\nsignificant differences; it is possible that IGT could be\nassociated with only fatal cardiovascular disease events.\nHowever, previous studies have failed to demonstrate an\nassociation between diabetes mellitus and fatal stroke.26\u00ad27\nIn conclusion, we were unable to demonstrate any associ-\nation between IGT and either prevalent stroke or myocardial\ninfarction in a nationally representative sample of US adults\nalthough the relationship between DM and cardiovascular\ndisease was clearly demonstrable. Previous studies reporting\nsuch a relationship may not have fully taken into account\nmany of the cardiovascular disease risk factors that may have\nconfounded this association.\nReferences\n1.
