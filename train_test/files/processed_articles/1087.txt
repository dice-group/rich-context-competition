This issue brings\ntogether a collection of articles representing recent developments in spatial analysis\nsoftware for the social sciences. The articles were selected from those presented at\ntwo recent conferences on spatial information science. The first was a specialist\nmeeting on ``Spatial Software Tools Development,`` sponsored by the U.S. Center\nfor Spatial Integrated Social Science and held in May 2002 in Santa Barbara, Cal-\nifornia.1 The second gathering was a symposium on ``Spatial Information Science\nfor Human and Social Science,'' held at the University of Tokyo in January 2004.\nThe two meetings covered a wide range of issues from tool development and\ndesign to user communities and applications. They brought together a productive\nmix of software developers, empirical researchers, and private and public sector\nentities to take stock of the state of the science regarding tools for spatial data\nanalysis. What emerged from these meetings was a sense of a vibrant field con-\ntributing to tools being increasingly applied in research across the social sciences.\nGiven these developments, we thought it was timely to bring together a represent-\native selection of articles that highlight some of the key issues and developments in\nthis rapidly evolving field.\nThe first article, by Anselin, Syabri, and Kho provides an overview of GeoDa, a\nfree program supporting interactive exploratory spatial data analysis. GeoDa is tar-\ngeted at the non-GIS (geographical information systems) user and is designed to\nrequire as little as possible in terms of other software packages. Its goal is to provide\nanalysts with a user-friendly, but powerful, integrated package that supports all\nphases of an empirical spatial data analysis, from mapping and geovisualization to\nspatial autocorrelation analysis, multivariate exploratory data analysis, and finally\nconfirmatory spatial regression analysis. Although the implementation described in\nthis article is a closed-source package, an ongoing research effort is porting the\ncode to an open-source toolkit and making the package available to multiple plat-\nforms (Windows, MacOS X, and Linux/Unix).\nCorrespondence: Dr. Sergio Rey, Department of Geography, San Diego State University,\ne-mail: serge@rohan.sdsu.edu\nIn the second article, Roger Bivand provides an overview of recent work im-\nplementing functions for spatial statistical analysis in the open-source R language\nenvironment. Bivand draws on lessons learned from the R project about how to\ncombine both substantive expertise and infrastructure support to achieve critical\nmass and mutually beneficial knowledge and tool exchange. The article describes\nhow the R project functions in general, and outlines the main packages in the\nproject designed for the analysis of spatial data. The spatial analytical capabilities of\nthe spdep package are then illustrated using data on sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS) in North Carolina. Future opportunities for advancing spatial data analysis\nin R are also outlined.\nNed Levine's article, about the CrimeStat spatial statistics program, presents a\ndescription of the main components of the program and outlines its potential use\nboth in crime-related research as well as in fields such as geography, epidemiology,\nforestry science, botany, and geology. CrimeStat is a stand-alone Windows pro-\ngram for the analysis of the spatial pattern of crimes and is designed to interface\nwith most desktop GIS programs. The interface is carried out through using graph-\nical objects produced by CrimeStat, which are linked to packages such as ArcView,\nArcGis, and MapInfo. Levine describes a number of examples involving spa-\ntial autocorrelation, hot-spot detection, spatial interpolation, and journey-to-crime\nanalysis, which illustrate the statistical and visualization capabilities of the\npackage.\nWhile the first three articles in the issue primarily deal with area and point data,\nthe article by Okabe, Okunuki, and Shiode outlines a GIS-based toolbox for network\ndata, SANET (Spatial Analysis on a NETwork). This software is designed to deal with\ntwo classes of network phenomena, those that occur on a network (e.g., traffic\naccidents) and those that occur in proximity to, but not on, a network (e.g., restau-\nrants in an urban area which may have entrances on multiple streets). Due to\ncomputational complexity, network data are often modeled using planar spatial\nmethods, yet such an approach is likely to lead to false conclusions given the non-\nplanar nature of network data. The authors argue that to properly analyze network\nphenomena, user-friendly tools for network spatial analysis must be available.\nSANET consists of two components, one implementing a suite of 12 different net-\nwork analysis modules and the second providing a SANET\u00adArcView interface using a\nloose-coupling model.\nThe fourth article, by Sergio Rey and Mark Janikas, introduces the package\nSTARS, Space-Time Analysis of Regional Systems. STARS is an open-source pack-\nage designed for the dynamic exploration of areal data measured over multiple time\nperiods. Written in the Python object-oriented scripting language, STARS combines\na number of new statistical methods for exploration of spatial dynamics together\nwith a set of interactive geovisualization and statistical graphics. STARS provides\nboth a user-friendly graphical user interface as well as the option of employing the\ncommand line interface for interactive scripting and customization. A selection of\nthe core functions of STARS is illustrated using data on U.S. income dynamics.\nGeographical Analysis\nHanan Samet and Robert Webber report on a three-dimensional visualization\nextension to the SAND spatial database system. SAND denotes Spatial and Non-\nspatial Data and emphasizes a tight coupling of spatial and nonspatial data repre-\nsentation and queries. This coupling relies on quadtree-style indexing strategies and\noriginally focused on two-dimensional spatial objects, such as county boundaries\nand river systems. The extension presented here focuses on the incorporation of a\nthird dimension through a new object type, the isosurface. This results in a powerful\ntechnique for performing clustering and windowing.\nIn the final contribution, Ningchuan Xiao and Marc Armstrong report on the\npackage ChoroWare, which adopts a multiobjective approach to the construction\nof choropleth map class intervals. ChoroWare implements a specialized island\nmodel which is a genetic algorithm that evaluates the ``fitness'' of each classifica-\ntion scheme against four different objective functions. Each classification (individ-\nual) is assigned a fitness value according to its nondomination against other\nclassifications. Classifications with high fitness values are then selected to produce\nthe next generation of solutions, which are modified by a crossover (migration\nacross the islands) model.\nThe appearance of these and other spatial analysis tools is arguably in response\nto earlier calls by GIScience researchers for the development of new software\net al. 1992). We view those initial calls as representing a first phase of research\nin the evolution of spatial data analysis software. Originally, the focus was largely\non conceptual issues and general discussions of required functionality. A second\nstage in this evolution was characterized by intensive tool development, imple-\nmentation, and initial dissemination efforts (Anselin 2000; Goodchild et al. 2000).\nAt present, we see the early signs that the field has entered a third phase of evo-\nlution, in which refined development is being driven and informed by interaction\nwith wider scientific communities that eagerly adopt the tools.\nIn this third phase, we view the growing popularity of spatial analysis tools\nas a reflection of several emerging themes in contemporary research. The first is\nthat researchers are engaging in more hands-on programming as part of their\nempirical analyses. In part, this is required by the increasingly complex nature of\nthe research questions of interest, because existing commercial off-the-shelf\npackages often lack the required analytical functions. The second theme pertains\nto the recent rise in popularity of higher level scripting languages, such as Python,\nTCL, and Ruby. These languages have flattened the scientific computing learning\ncurve. Because of their accessibility, these languages are experiencing increased\nmindshare, which in turn, leads to thicker and wider scientific user communities\nand further advances in computationally based tools for spatial social science\nresearch.\nWe hope that by bringing together the current collection of articles readers will\ngain increased familiarity with the related projects. This should enhance the po-\ntential for applying the tools in their own research programs and the possibility of\nAdvances in Software for Spatial Analysis\nSergio J. Rey and Luc Anselin\nengaging with further development of these and new packages, ultimately leading\nto improved environments for geographical analysis.\n"
