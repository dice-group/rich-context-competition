However, this phenomenon, known as the placebo effect, does not usually cure the disease, but\nrather can provide symptomatic relief: It may soothe symptoms such as pain, swelling, or nausea that constitute part of an immune\nresponse. The function of this mechanism remains unclear. This article puts forward the Signaling Theory of Symptoms (STS) as a\npossible explanation. According to STS, discernible aspects of an immune response, such as pain, swelling, or nausea, not only\nserve a defensive and healing function but also a signaling function: symptoms signal the need for care and treatment to potential\nhelpers. Once help and treatment are granted, the signaling function is fulfilled and the symptoms diminish. This mechanism may\nhave been a significant advantage in preindustrial environments, when sufferers depended on extensive social support and per-\nsonal treatment. Nowadays, from the point of view of modern materialist medicine, the mobilization of social support no longer\nseems so crucial, and thus the placebo effect has been assigned a somewhat mysterious quality.\n",

Originally, the term ``placebo effect'' or ``placebo\nresponse'' stood for an improvement of the patient's clinical\nstate caused by a physiologically inert treatment (Benedetti,\n2014). However, it is not the inert treatment itself, but rather\nthe meaning that it has for the patient, which causes the effect\nterm placebo effect does not refer exclusively to allegedly inert\ntreatments, such as sugar pills or saline injections, but also\nincludes other psychosocial aspects of the medical environ-\nment, such as care and a positive doctor\u00adpatient relationship\nSchapira, Kossowsky, & Riess, 2014). New terms such as\n``meaning response,'' ``contextual healing,'' ``belief effect,''\nand ``interpersonal healing'' have been introduced to capture\nthis broadened understanding of the placebo effect (Chiappedi,\nman & Jonas, 2002). However, even if the placebo effect can be\npowerful, its scope is limited. For example, placebo treatment\nmay reduce cancer-induced pain, but it cannot cure cancer\nitself (Benedetti, 2014). Most of the time, placebo treatment\ndoes not cure the disease, but it reduces the symptoms (Miller\nlimited to certain conditions such as pain, swelling, depression,\nand irritable bowel syndrome (Evans, 2005; Howick et al.,\nthese conditions are aspects of an immune reaction or are at\nleast closely related to it (Dantzer, O'Connor, Freund, Johnson,\n\u00a8 hman &\nSimr\u00b4\nen, 2010).

This theory\nassumes that easily discernible features of an immune reaction,\nnamely symptoms such as fever, swelling, apathy, obvious\nsigns of pain, and so on, not only serve defense and healing\npurposes but also signal the need for help and treatment to\npotential helpers. The stronger the symptoms, the higher their\nsignaling efficacy. Therefore, symptoms are exaggerated to\nheighten the likelihood of mobilizing help and treatment. Once\nhelp and treatment are received, this signaling function is ful-\nfilled and the symptoms can diminish.\nFirst, I will give an overview of previous evolutionary the-\nories on the subject in order to provide a basic framework and\ndraw attention to the open questions. In the following sections,\nthe adaptive problem of infection and injury will be discussed\nas well as the probable adaptive solutions to this problem,\nnamely the immune system and the help and treatment by\nothers. Against this background, STS will be introduced and\ndeveloped. A further section will assemble empirical evidence\nsupporting STS, and testable hypotheses will be derived.\nFinally, the article will be summarized and some implications\nwill be elucidated.\nTheoretical Background\nPlacebo research is rather interested in the proximate mechan-\nism of the placebo effect, specifically in how it is mediated\nphysiologically (Benedetti, 2013). However, research in this\nfield has yet to answer questions concerning the function which\nthis mechanism fulfills and, hence, why such a mechanism\nAccording to the pain researcher Patrick Wall (1999), pain\nis not only an alarm system that informs the sufferer of tissue\ndamage, but it also motivates appropriate action. Pain can\nexpress the need to withdraw from a harmful situation (e.g., a\nhot stove), the need to adopt a relieving posture, or the need to\nseek help and treatment. The mere act of providing help and\ntreatment fulfills the need and allows the pain to fade. Wall's\nconception suits the evolutionary perspective well, since he\nregards pain as having the function of motivating appropriate\naction in case of sickness or injury. According to this theory,\nthe placebo effect can be seen as one small aspect of this\nadaptation, ``[ . . . ] the placebo is not a stimulus but an appro-\nphysiological ineffectiveness of the placebo treatment, believes\nthat appropriate action has been taken, and thus that the need\nstate has been fulfilled, hence the pain diminishes. However,\nWall's theory remains restricted to pain and placebo analgesia.\n2012; Trimmer, Marshall, Fromhage, McNamara, & Houston,\n2013) puts forward the theory of the ``health management sys-\ntem'' or ``health governor.'' Self-healing and defense should not\nbe an automatic reaction to infection and injury. Rather, they\nshould be employed selectively after a cost\u00adbenefit analysis:\nPain and swelling of the broken ankle should be postponed when\na person is in immediate danger from the proverbial lion. Fight-\ning the flu should be postponed when there are immediate\noptions for procreation. Moreover, a lack of food and bodily\nenergy reserves might not allow for a full immune response.\nThus, the regulation of self-healing should be based on a calcu-\nlation of costs, opportunity costs, and potential benefits. This\ncalculation is based on the individual's subjective judgment of\nenvironmental conditions, that is, in the terminology of placebo\nresearch, on expectations. According to Humphrey, the placebo\ntreatment modifies this cost\u00adbenefit analysis--it gives the\nimpression that it will assist the immune system and in this way,\nit improves the prospects of a rapid recovery. The ``health gov-\nernor'' assumes that the circumstances have changed for the\nbetter and allows a full immune response.\nEvans (2003) disagrees with Humphrey's thesis, claiming\nthat the placebo effect is not concerned with enhancing immune\nactivity but rather with suppressing it. Evans observes that the\nplacebo-responsive conditions, such as pain, depression, and\nirritable bowel syndrome have something in common: They are\neach symptoms of an acute-phase response or at least closely\nrelated to it. Evans regards the placebo effect as a special case of\nthe broad phenomenon of immune conditioning. He refers to\nevidence from the respective field, suggesting that immune reac-\ntions are up or down regulated, depending on environmental\nfactors and previous experience. However, Evans finds more\nempirical evidence for conditioned immune suppression than for\nconditioned immune enhancement. Therefore, he suggests that\nimmune conditioning might have evolved as a ``[ . . . ] protec-\ntive mechanism, to save the immune system from unnecessary\nexpenditure, and not as a general-purpose learning mechanism to\nenable the immune system to respond in any way to any psy-\nAccording to Evans, one opportunity to save resources would\noccur when effective treatment and care provided by others\ncontribute to a task that the immune system would otherwise\nperform alone. If extensive care and effective medicine have\nexisted long enough, the selective pressure to save resources\ncould have shaped a mechanism like the placebo effect. Still,\nEvans' theory does not explain what he also tried to claim,\nnamely why the placebo effect is restricted to symptoms of the\nacute-phase response. Evans speculates that in some situations,\nit might be adaptive to suppress the acute-phase response in\norder to allow an earlier onset of the adaptive immune response.\nHowever, he does not elaborate on this further.\nPrevious evolutionary theory provides foundations as well\nas open questions for further theoretical development. Wall's\ntheory gives a convincing explanation of pain, but not of other\nplacebo-responsive conditions. Humphrey's theory applies to\nall placebo-responsive conditions, but it does not agree well\nwith empirical findings. Finally, Evans' theory applies to all\nplacebo-responsive conditions and is supported by empirical\nevidence, but it does not answer the question of why the pla-\ncebo effect is restricted to certain symptoms.\nThe present article will attempt to fill these gaps. Further, it\nwill try to broaden the focus, so that it not only regards the\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nsufferer who is helped and treated but also others who decide\neither to help and treat the sufferer or to refrain from doing so.\nSpecifically, it explains the placebo effect as part of an adaptive\nsignaling mechanism.\nJust like other theories in evolutionary medicine, STS is\nbased on the assumption that humans are not adapted to their\nmodern environments, but rather to the hunter-gatherer envi-\nronment, the so-called environment of evolutionary adapted-\nunderstand the regulation of the immune system, and thus the\nplacebo effect, it is necessary to identify how the adaptive\nproblems of illness and injury were solved during human evo-\nlution, especially in hunter-gatherer environments.\nThe Environment of Evolutionary\nAdaptedness\nThe risk of injury and infection has been a crucial adaptive\nproblem throughout evolutionary history, and the immune sys-\ntem developed as its adaptive answer (Nesse & Williams, 1995).\nHowever, an immune reaction also has substantial costs. On the\none hand, there are direct costs, such as higher energy consump-\ntion or potential tissue damage due to high fever (Bonneaud\n2012). On the other hand, there are opportunity costs. Immune\nsystem activation is associated with so-called sickness behavior\nsuch as sleepiness, apathy, and social withdrawal, reflecting a\nmotivational shift away from social, sexual, and aggressive\nbehavior that allows maximization of immune activity (Aubert,\nin priorities, sick animals miss out on opportunities for mating,\nbonding, and fighting for places in dominance hierarchies. Fur-\nther, avoidant behavior of conspecifics may contribute to these\nsocial costs (Avitsur, Cohen, & Yirmiya, 1997). In certain situa-\ntions, opportunity costs are so high that the immune response is\nsuppressed in order to enable normal behavior (Aubert, Goodall,\nLopes, Adelman, Wingfield, & Bentley, 2012; Owen-Ashley\n& Wingfield, 2006). For example, male zebra finches whose\nimmune systems were artificially provoked, display symptoms\nof illness when they are housed in a single cage, but when housed\nin a group cage, they do not display these symptoms (Lopes\net al., 2012). More specifically, when sick male zebra finches\nare in the presence of a female zebra finch, their symptoms\nvanish, presumably to enable mating (Lopes et al., 2013).\nHowever, in some species the opportunity costs of an\nimmune system are partly compensated by support of conspe-\ncifics. For example, house sparrows breed in couples and feed\noffspring together. When the female shows symptoms of sick-\nness, the male sparrow collects more food to compensate for\nmarizes a series of observational studies about animals helping\nsick conspecifics. Female chimpanzees reduced their travel\nspeed to let a sick group member keep pace. They also took\ncare of the sick mother's son while she was sleeping. In a group\nof wild mongooses, an injured group member was extensively\ngroomed and even provided with food. While provision of food\nto sick group members is observed only in some nonhuman\nanimals, mutual support in case of sickness or injury is a crucial\npart of life in human hunter-gatherer societies and, moreover,\nsome have conjectured that this social support is one of the\nreasons for human longevity (Gurven, Stieglitz, Hooper,\nIn contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, injuries and sick-\nnesses that temporarily keep a group member from gathering\nand hunting are common (Gurven, Allen-Arave, Hill, &\n2000). However, the resulting temporary inability to join hunt-\ning or foraging does not result in the starvation of the sick\npersons, since their absence from foraging is buffered by the\ngroup. Sick and injured group members are provided with food\n2000), notably, without the possibility of direct reciprocity\nfrom the sick person (Sugiyama, 2004; Sugiyama & Chacon,\nfood might be explained through delayed reciprocity or\nimproved reputation on the part of the donor (Hawkes, 1991;\n1996). Thus, helping can be an honest signal of mate quality\nSylwester & Roberts, 2013). Helping can also signal indispen-\nsability and act as ``insurance'' against the helpers themselves\nbecoming sick or injured (Gurven et al., 2000; Jaeggi &\nmembers who distributed more food when in a healthy con-\ndition receive more support when they are sick (Gurven et al.,\nFurther, humans have probably had knowledge of simple\nmedical treatments since the time of homo neanderthalensis.\nThere is a wide range of effective herbal medicines and it is\npossible that some of these might have been in use in ancient\nhunter-gatherer societies (Halberstein, 2005). Flowers found in a\nNeanderthal grave have remarkable medical efficacy and might\nhave been chosen as a funerary object on this basis (Lietava,\n1992). The use of red ochre is well-documented among Nean-\nderthals across Europe (Roebroeks et al., 2012). Besides for per-\nsonaldecorationandcave paintings,redochreisusedformedical\npurposes by modern hunter-gatherers and this might also have\nbeen the case for Neanderthals (Roebroeks et al., 2012; Velo,\n1984). The iron salts in red ochre are antiseptic, can arrest bleed-\ning, and promote the healing of wounds (Velo, 1984).\nFurther treatments are imaginable, since symptoms have\nclear demand characteristics: a feverish head demands cooling\nand a shivering body warmth. Cooling a feverish head could\nprotect the brain from overheating, despite a high fever in the\nrest of the body. Shivering serves the function of creating heat,\nand warming may contribute to this adaptive reaction. So, in\nhumans, the opportunity costs, as well as the direct costs of an\nSteinkopf 3\nimmune response, are partly compensated by social support\nand treatment.\nStill, it is important to note that some kinds of help and\ntreatment can be counterproductive. For example, consuming\niron-rich food counteracts the body's strategy of sequestrating\niron to limit bacterial growth (Nesse & Williams, 1995; Wein-\nberg, 1984). Similarly, certain lipoproteins serve, on the one\nhand, for the transport of lipids in the blood and, on the other\nhand, aid the functioning of the immune system (Adamo, Bar-\ntlett, Le, Spencer, & Sullivan, 2010; Steiner & Romanovsky,\n2007). Thus, a low intake of fat could assist the immune sys-\ntem, whereas high fat consumption could counteract proper\nimmune functioning (Adamo et al., 2010). Also, soothing\nsymptoms such as fever may relieve suffering but at the same\ntime may undermine the immune reaction (Nesse & Williams,\n1995). This problem of counterproductive treatment might be\npartly solved by the sufferer's feelings toward the help that is\ngranted, for example disgust toward fatty or iron-rich food.\nSymptoms as Cues\nProviding support for sick or injured group members requires\nothers to detect them. Therefore, the seemingly trivial question\narises of how sickness and injury are detected. Some injuries\ncan be perceived directly either visually (e.g., blood loss) or\nhaptically (e.g., the unusual mobility of broken bones). Infec-\ntions, however, can only be directly perceived through modern\nmeans: Microscopes make bacteria visible, and antibody tests\nprovide evidence for the presence of certain viruses. Without\nthese modern means, humans have had to rely and still rely on\nsymptoms to detect sickness in people. Accordingly, what we\nperceive as a sickness in everyday life is not the presence of an\ninfection itself but the easily discernible symptoms, such as\npain, fever, cough, sneezing, shivering, loss of appetite, and\nso on. Notably, these symptoms are not caused by the infection\nitself but are part of the body's response to the infection. This\nimmune reaction obviously functions as a defense against the\ninfection, as in the example of fever, which creates an uncom-\nfortable situation for pathogens, or coughing and sneezing,\nwhich expels them. However, as elucidated above, some\naspects of this immune reaction are discernible to other group\nmembers: They provide cues which render the sickness percep-\ntible. In other words, an immune reaction not only fulfills the\nfunction of a defense against infections but also, as a bypro-\nduct, produces discernible symptoms that inform other group\nmembers about the need for help and treatment. Along the\nsame lines, Thornhill and Thornhill (1989) suggest that psy-\nchological pain has a dual function. On the one hand, psycho-\nlogical pain drives the individual's attention to the source of\npain, motivates introspective analysis and, in this way, might\nlead to a solution. On the other hand, psychological pain serves\nas a social display of need. Also, Wall regards pain as a need\nstate that drives the sufferer's attention to a possible solution.\nAt the same time, without elaborating on it, Wall makes it clear\nthat pain has two sides: ``private pain and public display''\nCues Becoming Signals\nOnce the tendency to help the sick appeared in evolutionary\nhistory, discernible symptoms of an immune reaction no longer\nhad only a defensive function but also happened to act as cues\nfor potential helpers to discover sick individuals. It might be\nreasonable to assume that individuals differed in their symptom\nstructure, for example, the peak of their fever, the expression of\ntheir pain, the intensity of coughing and sneezing, and so on. As\nindividual immune systems differ in their defensive effective-\nness, the discernible symptom structure of immune reactions\nmight also differ in their effectiveness as cues. Some individ-\nuals might have had a symptom structure that mobilized sup-\nport more effectively, while others had symptoms that were\nless effective in mobilizing help. The former had an evolution-\nary advantage over the latter since, as described above, mobi-\nlizing help is crucial for survival. This would result in a\nselection pressure for more effective cues. Thus, the immune\nsystem, alongside its defensive function, was also selected for a\nsymptom structure that most effectively elicits support from the\ngroup. According to the terminology of Williams (1966) and\nGould and Vrba (1982), the discernible symptoms of an\nimmune reaction form part of the immune system, that is, a\ncomplex set of adaptations for the function of defense, but the\ndiscernible symptoms are also an exaptation with the effect of\nmobilizing help. Thus, there is a second selection pressure for\nbetter cues of sickness, which causes the symptoms to turn into\na secondary adaptation for this function. However, the initial\ndefense function persists, making the discernible symptoms an\nadaptation which serves two ultimate functions: defense and\nproviding cues. The symptoms are now also signals, since they\nare shaped by evolution for a communicative purpose.\nPresumably, stronger symptoms provide more convincing\nsignals than weaker symptoms. Thus, higher fever, stronger\nappearance of pain, louder sneezing and coughing, worse ane-\nmia, more obvious nausea, and so on should mobilize the most\nsocial support. The symptom strength optimal for mobilizing\nhelp is probably higher than the optimal symptom strength for\ndefense. Thus, symptoms should be exaggerated above the\nlevel that is optimal for defense to improve the chances of\nreceiving social support. Similarly, Trivers (1974) suggests that\ncrying by young infants is not only a cue for need but an\nexaggerated signal to extract more resources from the parents\nthan they would otherwise give. However, in some severe dis-\neases, optimal symptom strength might be so high that exag-\ngeration is neither necessary nor feasible.\nIn summary, I suggest that discernible symptoms serve two\nfunctions: defense and signaling the need for help. The two\nfunctions result in a trade-off. Optimal signaling means subopti-\nmal defense, while optimal defense means suboptimal signaling.\nIn general, trade-offs are a common reason for the imperfections\nWilliams & Nesse, 1991). The double function of discernible\nsymptoms is based on an evolutionary path dependency: a con-\nstraint in the terminology of evolutionary medicine (Nesse,\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nCostly, and Thus, Honest Signals\nGenerous social support usually entails the problem of free\nriders, which, within the scope of this article, refers to people\nfaking sickness. However, the symptom signals are quite dif-\nficult to fake, since they are highly costly for the sender. First,\ndiscernible symptoms like fever are costly in terms of energy\n(Benhariz, Goulet, Salas, Colomb, & Ricour, 1997; Kluger,\nbecome more costly the more exaggerated they become. Sec-\nond, the symptoms not only harm the pathogens but also the\nLikewise, they do more harm the more they are exaggerated.\nThird, being sick has opportunity costs which arise from typical\nsickness behavior: fatigue, lack of sexual interest, and loss of\nrefrains from social activities that might provide a pay-off in\nterms of reputation, rank, or mating opportunities. In short,\ntransmitting convincing signals of sickness is highly costly and\nlikely only pays off for those who are really in need of help, not\nfor those who only aim to take time off on full board.\nThese costs also limit the exaggeration of the symptoms for\nthe sake of signaling. This can be illustrated by an imaginary\nhunter-gatherer band that features several sick members at the\nsame time. In this case, the sick individuals compete for the\nhelp of others. Other factors being constant (like the respective\nsick individual's reputation or importance within the group),\nthe sick individual will probably receive more support the nee-\ndier they appear to be, that is, the stronger the symptoms they\ndisplay. However, other factors being constant (like the energy\nreserves of the respective sick individual), the sick individuals\nshould only invest as much in the signaling as the hoped-for\nhelp is worth. Thus, again, even exaggerated symptoms are a\nreliable signal for the need for help. Costly signals are honest\nCost and Benefits of Helping\nFor the sufferer, sending convincing signals of sickness is\nhighly costly. And for potential helpers, altruistic behavior is\ncostly in terms of the time and resources it takes to feed and\ntreat the sick and to absolve the sick of other duties. Further-\nmore, contact with individuals who carry parasites bears the\nrisk of contagion. In fact, close contact with sick conspecifics,\nas compared to contact with, for example sick animals or rotten\nfood, is especially risky, because parasites are adapted to par-\nThere is a great deal of research on adaptations to the risk of\ncontagion, among them the tendency to avoid sick conspeci-\nfics. This body of research predominantly deals with the emo-\ntion of disgust within the theoretical framework of the\nbehavioral immune system (Curtis, Aunger, & Rabie, 2004;\nCurtis, de Barra, & Aunger, 2011; Oaten, Stevenson, & Case,\nDeScioli, 2013). This behavioral immune system is so sensitive\nthat it not only reacts to contagious conspecifics but also to\nnoncontagious deviations from the norm, such as facial disfig-\nurements, overweightness, old age, and physical disabilities\n(Duncan & Schaller, 2009; Lieberman, Tybur, & Latner,\nHowever, there are some factors that mitigate the drive to\navoid sick conspecifics. First, disgust and avoidance are\nweaker when considering familiar people and in-group mem-\nbers, as compared to out-group members and strangers (Case,\nChang, & Zhou, 2013). This makes sense from the standpoint\nof pathogen avoidance, since strangers are more likely to carry\nnovel pathogens for which the immune system is not yet pre-\nStevenson & Repacholi, 2005). Second, the fast automatic\nreaction of avoidance can be overridden by a slow, controlled,\nand rule-based process that takes into account social norms and\nPryor, Reeder, Yeadon, & Hesson-McInnis, 2004; Stone &\nPotton, 2014). One of these social norms might be to help sick\ngroup members (Schaller, 2011). Also, helping the sick might\nbe rewarded with especially high social prestige (Schaller,\n2011). In fact, helping the sick greatly improves reputation,\nas reflected in the especially high reputation of members of\nthe medical professions. Rankings of occupational prestige in\nthe United States show physicians ranking first and nurses fifth,\nwhile similarly, in Germany, physicians rank first and nurses\nsecond (Institut fu\n\u00a8r Demoskopie Allensbach, 2013; Pollack,\nFurthermore, a sick group member could put pressure on\nother group members who are dependent. Sharing a similar\nbasis, the ``social navigation hypothesis'' (Watson & Andrews,\nharming behavior in depression from drug abuse to suicide\nattempts. In interdependent relationships, like the family or a\nforaging group, harming oneself also imposes costs on others:\nOther people who usually depend on or cooperate with the\ndepressed individual are left to their own devices when the\nself-harmer is injured or dead. In this way, self-harming beha-\nvior on the part of the depressed individual can put pressure on\nfamily or group members to help.\nSimilarly, exaggerated symptoms may also mobilize help by\nputting pressure on potential helpers. Exaggerated symptoms\nmay not only be costly to the bearer but they may also impose\ncosts on others who depend on the well-being of the sufferer.\nOverly exaggerated symptoms are a kind of self-harming beha-\nvior that might serve an extortive function to elicit social sup-\nport from dependent others.\nThe Regulation of Signaling Symptoms\nOne of the primary functions of the immune response, and also\nits discernible symptoms, is fighting pathogens. When the\ninfection is eliminated, this defensive function is fulfilled and\nSteinkopf 5\nthe immune reaction can thus diminish. The same should be\ntrue for the hypothesized secondary function, the signaling\nfunction of symptoms. Signaling symptoms have high costs\nin terms of energy and create the risk of tissue damage. There-\nfore, the signaling symptoms should not be continued longer\nthan necessary. As soon as the status of sickness is acknowl-\nedged by the group, once support and treatment is granted, the\nsignaling function is fulfilled and the immune reaction can\ndiminish. As described above, Wall (1999) claims that the mere\nact of giving help and treatment fulfills the need and allows the\npain to fade. From the perspective of STS, the same might be\ntrue for any other discernible symptom.\nBut how does an individual judge (consciously or uncon-\nsciously) whether it has been supported and treated properly\nand, in this way, whether the signaling function of the immune\nsystem has been fulfilled? Medical research provides informa-\ntion about the state of the art of treatment for the respective\ndisease and thus makes clear which kind of treatment the sick\nperson should be satisfied with. However, the human body has\nnot yet adapted to modern circumstances, but rather to the\nenvironment of evolutionary adaptedness (Nesse & Williams,\nof the signaling symptoms may therefore still be largely cali-\nbrated for a Stone Age environment.\nIt is not known exactly how medical treatment was in the\nPaleolithic age, but two self-evident assumptions can be made.\nFirst, there was no machinery, so any kind of treatment was\ndone by people and always involved social contact with famil-\niar group members. Second, just like any other part of culture,\nmedication and rituals of treatment probably changed over time\nand differed between groups. The human need for help and\ntreatment in case of sickness should be shaped accordingly.\nAs there was no effective treatment without extensive personal\ncare, humans should have a universal need for personal care in\ncase of sickness. As medication and rituals of treatment dif-\nfered between times and groups, humans should have a variable\nneed for medication and treatment that is shaped by their\nrespective medical culture. The regulation of signaling symp-\ntoms should be calibrated accordingly. On the one hand, there\nshould be a general response to social support. On the other\nhand, there should be a rather open response, based on the\nbeliefs of effectiveness of the sick person, shaped by the\nrespective cultural environment.\nEmpirical Support for the STS\nThe STS assumes that discernible symptoms of an immune\nreaction serve a second function alongside defense and healing:\nnamely, signaling the need for help and treatment. Discernible\nsymptoms, such as swelling, apathy, loss of appetite, and the\nobvious distress of pain, signal to others the need for support\nand treatment. These symptoms are exaggerated to enhance the\nsignaling efficacy and, in turn, to more reliably mobilize social\nsupport and treatment. Once social support and treatment are\ngranted, the signaling function is fulfilled and the signaling\nsymptoms may decline. However, this need for help and\ntreatment is shaped by the selective pressures of the environ-\nment of evolutionary adaptedness. First, due to a lack of med-\nical machinery, any treatment had to be performed by people,\nand sufferers were thus selected for the demand for personal\nhelp by actual humans. Second, medical cultures differed\nbetween tribes and changed over time, so humans were selected\nfor flexible treatment demands depending on the respective\nmedical culture.\nPrecisely these two factors--a general response to social\nsupport and an open response based on individual beliefs of\neffectiveness--can be found in empirical studies of the placebo\neffect. Two factors trigger the placebo effect: on the one hand,\nMiller et al., 2009) and, on the other, the patient's expectation\nof amelioration (Benedetti et al., 2003; Stewart-Williams &\nFor example, an early study on the placebo effect used an\nultrasound device designed to reduce swellings caused by\ndental treatment (Hashish, Hai, Harvey, Feinmann, & Harris,\n1988). The subjects were treated with the device, and the\nswelling was reduced, even when the device was turned\noff--a placebo effect. The placebo effect, however, was\nfound only when an experimenter administered the device\nto the patient. It did not work when the subject used it alone.\nThis finding points to the significance of social support for the\nplacebo effect. From the point of view of STS, the excessive\nswelling was a signaling symptom that had fulfilled its func-\ntion once someone helped the sufferer. The function was not\nfulfilled when the sufferer administered the treatment alone,\nin which case the excessive swelling prevailed. In a much\nmore recent study, intranasal administration of oxytocin has\nbeen shown to increase the analgesic effect of a placebo oint-\nment applied to the forearm (Kessner, Sprenger, Wrobel,\nWiech, & Bingel, 2013). Oxytocin increases trust (Kosfeld,\nHeinrichs, Zak, Fischbacher, & Fehr, 2005), and in this case it\nprobably raised the subject's trust in the doctor applying the\nplacebo ointment (Kessner et al., 2013). In the view of STS,\nsignaling symptoms should continue as long as the sufferer\ndistrusts the potential helper's intentions. By raising trust, oxy-\ntocin may change the appraisal of the situation in such a way\nthat the signaling functions seem to be fulfilled. Similarly, the\nfacial expression of potential helpers might also change the\nappraisal of the situation. Presenting facial expressions to the\nsubject alters the magnitude of the placebo effect in placebo\nanalgesia (Valentini, Martini, Lee, Aglioti, & Iannetti, 2014). A\nsad face enhances the placebo effect when compared to a neu-\ntral face, but a happy face enhances the placebo effect even\nmore. This makes sense in view of STS, since a sad face indi-\ncates that a potential helper empathizes with the sufferer, which\ncan be seen as a precondition of helping. A happy face can be\nseen as an indicator that help is very likely.\nHelping included physical contact in the environment of\nevolutionary adaptedness (EEA). In contemporary medicine,\ntreatments rarely include touching as part of the treatment\nitself. However, even the slight physical contact typical of\nmedical settings can soothe pain (Fishman, Turkheimer, &\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nDegood, 1995). Still, there seems to be a demand for treatments\nwhich involve greater physical contact: Many alternative and\ncomplementary treatments feature ``light touch \u00fe a healing\nple, involves significant physical contact and causes a strong\ntive of STS, these treatments satisfy the patient's general need\nfor helping through physical contact. Once this need is ful-\nfilled, the signaling symptoms can diminish. These examples\nshow that the humane aspects of medicine are crucial for\npatients' well-being. This observation does not fit with con-\ntemporary approaches to medicine, which are entirely materi-\nalist, but it fits perfectly well with STS.\nThe STS further suggests that there is a flexible component\nof immune regulation that adapts to developments and cultural\ndifferences. Patients can learn which treatment is effective and\nthen develop a placebo effect according to this belief. Accord-\ningly, the advertising of a drug--a kind of manipulative teach-\ning--enhances the drug's placebo effect (Kamenica, Naclerio,\n& Malani, 2013). Similarly, a patient can learn that a treatment\nis effective from a doctor who is convinced of its effectiveness\nand, in this way, can exhibit a placebo effect (Gracely, Dubner,\nDeeter, & Wolskee, 1985). From the perspective of STS, the\nadvertisements or the authority of the doctor teaches the patient\nwhich treatment is effective and, therefore, the signaling symp-\ntoms diminish once the patient receives the respective treat-\nment. The patients can also learn from their own experiences:\nClassical conditioning is one of the main mechanisms of the\nplacebo effect (Benedetti et al., 2003; Stewart-Williams &\nPodd, 2004). Furthermore, culture influences the placebo\neffect: For 30 years, the placebo effect of antidepressant med-\nication has increased while the treatment effect remained the\nsame (Undurraga & Baldessarini, 2012; Walsh, Seidman,\nSysko, & Gould, 2002). This can be interpreted as an effect\nof learning on a large scale. Slowly, antidepressants have\nbecome a part of popular medical culture and it has become\na standard means of treating depressed moods (Kirsch, 2011;\nMoerman, 2013). From the point of view of STS, patients have\nlearned that antidepressants are an appropriate treatment, and\nthus signaling symptoms are regulated accordingly. Taken\ntogether, these examples show that people can learn the mean-\ning, the significance and, in this way, the expectation of med-\nical treatments through advertisement, authorities, and their\nown experiences. The placebo effect, and hence the regulation\nof signaling symptoms, adapts to the current medical culture\nthrough these mechanisms, as reflected in the growing placebo\neffect of antidepressants.\nThis section has shown that STS fits well with the empirical\nfindings of placebo research. In a modern medical environment\nthat owes its advances to a materialist way of thinking, it seems\npuzzling that patients should respond to treatments that do not\nhave direct physiological effects. However, from the perspec-\ntive of the STS, the much-discussed but nevertheless poorly\nunderstood placebo effect is an adaptation to a medical envi-\nronment where the social component was much more important\nfor adequate treatment.\nPredictions and Testable Hypotheses\nThe STS assumes that discernible symptoms not only serve\ndefense and healing purposes but also the signaling of a need\nfor help and treatment. Accordingly, signaling makes sense\nwhen there are recipients of the signals. Therefore, STS pre-\ndicts that the exaggeration of the immune reaction should\nrather take place in the presence of potential helpers.\nHypothesis 1: Patients should show stronger symptoms in a\nsocial environment as compared to in isolation.\nThe hypothesized exaggeration of symptoms within a social\nenvironment depends on the behavior of the people who are\npresent. The symptoms should only be exaggerated as long as\nthe other people are passive and do not demonstrate acknowl-\nedgment of the status of the sick individual. Once they\nacknowledge the status and start helping, the signaling symp-\ntoms have fulfilled their function and may diminish.\nHypothesis 2: When other people acknowledge the status of\nthe sick individual and start helping, then the symptoms\nshould diminish.\nWhen there is only one sick individual, it is sufficient to\nconvince the helpers of the sickness status. However, when\nthere are more sick individuals and helpers are scarce, compe-\ntition among the sick individuals would emerge for the support\nof potential helpers, thus symptoms should be even stronger.\nHypothesis 3: The more sick individuals compete for help\nand the more scarce potential helpers are, the stronger the\nexpression of symptoms of sick individuals should be.\nHowever, the idea that symptoms serve as signals applies\nonly to discernible symptoms. It does not make sense to exag-\ngerate aspects of the immune response that potential helpers do\nnot notice. Fever, anemia, cough, and sneezing are easily dis-\ncernible, while the concentration of antibodies is not.\nHypothesis 4: The aforementioned hypotheses (Hypotheses\n1\u00ad3) should only be valid for easily discernible symptoms\nbut not for indiscernible aspects of the immune reaction.\nWhen testing this last hypothesis, the fact that different\naspects of the immune system are closely interrelated must\nbe taken into account. Different symptoms and sickness beha-\nviors, such as fever, swelling, and pain, loss of appetite, loss of\nsexual interest, and apathy, usually come together and they are\nof course highly correlated with the high cytokine levels that\nare causing them. For example, there is a reliable placebo effect\nfor the treatment of stomach ulcers, which would seem to con-\ntradict STS. However, stomach ulcers are an inflammatory\ndisease and, therefore, include other discernible symptoms\nsuch as nausea, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. Similarly,\ndepression is hypothesized to be an inflammatory disease,\nthough in this case the cardinal signs of inflammation such as\nswelling, redness, and heat are not visible. Nevertheless,\nSteinkopf 7\nsickness behaviors, such as apathy, tiredness, and loss of sexual\ninterest, are very well discernible. So, it might be difficult to\nseparate the discernible from the undiscernible aspects of the\nimmune response.\nFurther, symptoms suitable for signaling should not only be\ndiscernible, they should also cause the least disgust and avoid-\nance in potential helpers. Natural selection should have favored\nthose symptoms for signaling that most reliably motivated oth-\ners to help, and at the same time prevented disgust that could\ncounteract this motivation.\nHypothesis 5: The placebo effect should rather be found in\nsymptoms that do not elicit disgust in potential helpers.\nThis hypothesis has the same difficulties as the previous\none, as different symptoms that elicit more or less disgust are\ncorrelated. Also, there is no research that compares the degree\nof disgust that different symptoms elicit. Still, the theory of the\nbehavioral immune systems suggests that disgust should be\nstrongest when infection is most likely. So, symptoms of pain\nand depression should be suitable signals. Accordingly, these\nare also the symptoms that show the most reliable placebo\neffects. Following the assumption further, coughing and sneez-\ning should be less suitable signs, as they bear the risk of droplet\ninfection. Still, coughing and sneezing can be viable signals as\nlong as they are only used when the potential helper is distant,\nbut suppressed when the helper comes closer. Conversely,\nfever would be a better signal when potential helpers are close,\nbecause fever is not recognizable from afar and it does not raise\nthe risk of infection. Following this line of thought, the previ-\nous hypothesis can be further specified.\nHypothesis 6a: When helpers are distant, the sufferer\nshould have strong symptoms that are recognizable from\nfar, such as noises like sneezing, coughing, and cries of pain.\nHypothesis 6b: When helpers are close, the sufferer should\nnot have symptoms that raise the risk of infection of poten-\ntial helpers, such as coughing and sneezing. Instead, the\nsufferer should have strong symptoms, such as fever, that\nare recognizable from close proximity and that do not raise\nthe risk of infection.\nFinally, STS has comparative implications. Signaling need\nfor care makes only sense in species where care for the sick can\nbe found. Notably, this hypothesis is not about the presence of a\nplacebo effect in these species as the placebo effect found in\nanimals is usually based on classical conditioning.\nHypothesis 7: Signaling symptoms should only be found in\nspecies, where care of the sick can be found.\nAccordingly, the most complex regulation patterns of symp-\ntoms of sickness can be found in highly social species (Hen-\nnessy, Deak, & Schiml, 2014). However, as mentioned above,\nthe evidence of care for sick conspecifics in species other than\nhumans is scarce. Therefore, the hypothesis might be limited to\nthe comparison of humans with other species. The idea of\nHypothesis 7 could apply to further species when it is translated\nfrom a comparative into a developmental hypothesis. Maternal\ncare is much more common in nonhuman species than care for\nthe sick is. Therefore, young animals could have signaling\nsymptoms to extract more maternal care.\nHypothesis 8: In species that show maternal care, but not\ncare for sick adults, signaling symptoms should be found in\nyoung animals but not in adults.\nConclusion\nAccording to the STS, the human immune system is adapted to\nPaleolithic times, when medical care consisted of different\nkinds of social support and when, in case of illness, it was\ncrucial to mobilize this help. Thus, openly discernible aspects\nof an immune reaction's symptoms have not only been natu-\nrally selected for defense but also for their signaling effective-\nness. They are exaggerated to mobilize help. Exaggerated\nsymptoms are trustworthy because they are costly. Further-\nmore, some exaggerated symptoms can be interpreted as a\nself-harming behavior on the part of the sufferer, which may\nextort help from interdependent group members. When support\nand treatment are granted, the function of the signal is fulfilled,\nand the immune reaction can decrease to the intensity level that\nis optimal for defense.\nSTS serves as a theoretical explanation of the placebo effect.\nPlacebo treatment, a good patient\u00adphysician relationship, as\nwell as treatments from complementary and alternative medi-\ncine might be effective by granting the social support sick\nhumans are selected to demand. Still, STS does not compete\nwith other evolutionary theories of the placebo effect, such as\nHumphrey's model of the ``health governor.'' The two theories\nare not mutually exclusive, but complementary, since the term\nplacebo effect probably subsumes numerous different mechan-\nisms (Benedetti, Carlino, & Pollo, 2010).\nThe STS points to the importance of social support for\nsoothing signaling symptoms and, in this way, promoting\nwell-being and health. In contemporary society, social interac-\ntion is an increasingly less important aspect of medical exam-\nination and treatment. Certainly, modern medicine can\nascertain and treat the material causes of illnesses more effec-\ntively than ever before, but at the same time, it no longer fulfills\nthe social needs of patients (Hart & Dieppe, 1996). According\nto STS, however, these social needs are a crucial part of the\nregulation of the immune system. Just as symptoms persist\nwhen their material cause is not treated, symptoms might also\npersist when the cause is treated but the evolutionarily shaped\nneed for help and interpersonal treatment is left unsatisfied.\nThe assumptions of the STS could also be developed into an\nexplanation of chronic symptoms that do not seem to have a\nreal material cause, such as chronic pain or irritable bowel\nsyndrome. A hypothetical example for the development of irri-\ntable bowel syndrome from the perspective of STS could be the\nfollowing: Due to a false alarm of the immune system, a person\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\ndevelops symptoms of abdominal pain and discomfort. The\nperson's spouse does not take the complaints seriously, and the\ndoctor rejects the person's worries about the abdominal pain, a\nsecond doctor does the same, and so does a third. In fact, the\ndoctors are right in their diagnoses but they do not satisfy the\npatient's social need. With each doctor the symptoms worsen,\nbecause the signal strength does not seem to suffice to convince\npotential helpers. The person becomes accustomed to the per-\nsistently unsatisfied social need and, hence, might end up\ndeveloping chronic symptoms, even though a simple acknowl-\nedgment and social support might have soothed symptoms at\nthe outset. In the end, the person is treated by a spiritual healer,\nwho takes every complaint seriously, if only to earn money\nfrom the patient. Here, the person's symptoms are finally\nacknowledged and treated interpersonally. Finally, the signal-\ning function is fulfilled and the symptoms soothed.\nCertainly, it is no solution to shut down medical labs and\nswitch off medical devices to compensate for this social deficit.\nNonetheless, the STS suggests that social support and a good\ndoctor\u00adpatient relationship is an important supplement for\ntreatment in the paradigm of western medicine. This position\nis nothing new, and in fact it is quite common sense. Empiri-\ncally, it is based on overwhelming evidence (Benedetti, 2013;\nHart & Dieppe, 1996). Theoretically, however, it has received\nlittle support outside of humane arguments. The STS shows\nthat these ``soft factors'' are crucial for some conditions, rather\nthan just decorative accessory of the materialist approach. By\nconnecting these ``soft factors'' to evolutionary medicine, STS\nprovides the opportunity to argue for them from a more solid\nscientific foundation.\n"
