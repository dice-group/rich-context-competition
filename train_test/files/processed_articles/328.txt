The dependent variable ranged\nfrom +1 to -1 and measured satisfaction and dissatisfaction with career. Forty-two specialties were\nanalyzed with survey-adjusted linear regressions\nResults: After adjusting for physician, practice, and community characteristics, the following\nspecialties had significantly higher satisfaction levels than family medicine: pediatric emergency\nmedicine (regression coefficient = 0.349); geriatric medicine (0.323); other pediatric subspecialties\n(0.270); neonatal/prenatal medicine (0.266); internal medicine and pediatrics (combined practice)\nfollowing specialties had significantly lower satisfaction levels than family medicine: neurological\ngynecology (-0.188). We also found satisfaction was significantly and positively related to income\nand employment in a medical school but negatively associated with more than 50 work-hours per-\nweek, being a full-owner of the practice, greater reliance on managed care revenue, and\nuncontrollable lifestyle. We observed no statistically significant gender differences and no\ndifferences between African-Americans and whites.\nConclusion: Career satisfaction varied across specialties. A number of stakeholders will likely be\ninterested in these findings including physicians in specialties that rank high and low and students\ncontemplating specialty. Our findings regarding \"less satisfied\" specialties should elicit concern from\nresidency directors and policy makers since they appear to be in critical areas of medicine.\nBackground\nThe medical literature is replete with generalizations\nabout morale within individual medical specialties.\nInternists are \"unhappy\" and \"turning some students\naway from general internal medicine[1].\" \"Cardiology is\nperceived as very demanding in terms of work hours[2].\"\nSurgeons are more negatively impacted by \"physical\nexhaustion\" and conflicts between professional and per-\n\u00a9 2009 Leigh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nsonal life[3]. Obstetricians and gynecologists may be \"at\nrisk of burnout[4].\" Geriatricians \"have the highest job\nsatisfaction of any subspecialty[5].\" Stress among psychi-\natrists dissuades \"medical students from choosing psychi-\natry[6].\" Yet these broad assessments are seldom made in\ncomparison to other specialties. Apart from our earlier\nstudy, we are aware of no other to compare specialties\nwith a nationally representative sample[7]. But this previ-\nwithin specialties may have changed[8]. According to a\nwidely cited study, physicians today want more control of\nlifestyle[8].\nSatisfaction is important. Physician satisfaction has been\nfound to strongly correlate with patient satisfaction[9]\nand desirable patient outcomes[10]. A balance in the spe-\ncialty mix of physicians is necessary to maintain a high\nquality of medical care for all Americans[11]. Current dis-\nsatisfaction may lead to future declines in numbers of\nphysicians within specialties. Dissatisfied physicians may\nbe more likely to unionize[12], to strike[13], to experi-\nence medical problems themselves[14] and to exit medi-\ncine altogether[15]. Finally, dissatisfaction may increase\nrates of medical errors, thus jeopardizing patient\nThis study will update our earlier study with more recent\ndata. Comparative data may help medical school faculty\nand residency directors to provide medical students with\nappropriate career counseling, enable medical group\nmanagers and policy makers to anticipate workforce\ntrends, and provide practicing physicians with interesting\ninformation that could potentially influence career and\nretirement decisions.\nMethods\nData\nCommunity Tracking Physician Study (CTS)[17,18]. The\nsurvey is a representative sample of physicians, not\nemployed by the federal government, who resided in the\ncontinental United States and who provided direct patient\ncare at least 20 hours per week. The survey followed a\ncomplex design with a nationally representative sample of\n60 communities selected with probability proportional to\nsize (based on estimated population size in July, 1992)\nfrom strata defined by geographical region, community\nsize and whether the community is metropolitan or non-\nmetropolitan. These sites were selected in Round 1 of the\nCTS and have been used in Rounds 1-4 for second-stage\nsampling of physicians in the so-called site sample. For rea-\nsons of economy, an independent national supplemental\nsample was not drawn in Round 4, as was done in each of\nthe three previous rounds. At the second stage of sampling\nin Round 4, an unequal probability sample of physicians\nwas drawn from within each of the 60 sites from strata\nand sampling classes defined by cross-classifying physi-\ncians in the American Medical Association and American\nOsteopathic Association master files. This classification\nwas carried out according to primary care status and the\nphysician's status and disposition relative to the survey\nframe and selected sample for the previous round (2000-\nvey rounds, some hospital-based specialists such as radi-\nologists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists as well as all\nresidents and fellows were excluded, while primary care\nphysicians and responders to previous survey rounds were\nwere not available, but CTS administrators maintain that\nthe data are representative[17,18]. The CTS data are pub-\nlicly available from the Inter-University Consortium for\nPolitical and Social Research at the University of Michi-\ngan.\nThe CTS dataset included information on a total of 6,628\nvalid (non-missing) answers for the satisfaction question\nand for all of the control variables used in the multiple\nregression model, a restriction that slightly reduced our\nDependent Variables\nThe dependent variable was created from answers to this\nquestion: \"Thinking very generally about your satisfaction\nwith your overall career in medicine, would you say that\nyou are currently... very satisfied, somewhat satisfied,\nsomewhat dissatisfied, very dissatisfied, neither satisfied\nor dissatisfied, don't know, refused.\" We coded our satis-\nfaction-dissatisfaction variable as follows: equal to one if\nthe physician stated \"very satisfied\"; equal to zero for\n\"somewhat satisfied\" or \"neither\"; and equal to negative\none for either \"somewhat dissatisfied\" or \"very dissatis-\nfied.\" \"Somewhat dissatisfied\" was combined with \"very\ndissatisfied\" to increase power since only 4% stated they\nwere \"very dissatisfied.\" \"Somewhat satisfied\" was com-\nbined with \"neither\" to increase power in the middle\nvalue, 0, of our satisfaction score (1 to -1) variable. \"Don't\nknow\" and \"refused\" responses were excluded. Roughly\neither \"somewhat satisfied\" or \"neither\" (0); and 14.4%\nwere \"somewhat\" or \"very\" dissatisfied (-1).\nSpecialty Variables\nPhysician specialty codes classified physicians according\nto the specialty or subspecialty they reported spending the\nmost time weekly. To enhance the integrity of findings, we\ncombined specialty classifications with fewer than 20\nrespondents into related specialty classifications to\nachieve a minimum of 20 respondents in each of the\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nresulting 42 specialty classifications in the present analy-\nsis. We also created a three-level lifestyle controllability\nfactor, based upon the Dorsey et al[8] study by grouping\nspecialties. \"Controllable\" specialties included dermatol-\nogy, emergency medicine, neurology, ophthalmology,\notolaryngology, and child, adolescent, and adult psychia-\ntry. \"Uncontrollable\" specialties included family practice,\ngeneral practice, internal medicine, internal medicine and\npediatrics (combined), obstetrics and gynecology, ortho-\npedic surgery, pediatrics, general surgery, and urology.\n\"Neither controllable nor uncontrollable\" included the\nremaining 26 specialties in our sample. The CTS did not\nhave data on some specialties mentioned by Dorsey et al8\nincluding anesthesiology, pathology, and diagnostic radi-\nology.\nControl Variables\nWe selected control variables based on literature review\nand the Eisenberg Model[19,20]. Variables were classified\nas physician characteristics, community factors, and prac-\ntice factors, similar to the previous paper[7].\nPhysician characteristics included age, gender, race,\nwhether board certified, and whether graduated from for-\n(roughly 9%) and residence in nine regions of the country\n(see Table 1). States were grouped within regions that\nwere defined in the previous study[7].\nPractice factors included: income, practice ownership, cur-\nrent employment in a medical school, weekly work hours,\nand experience with managed care.

Second, family\npractice percentages for our satisfaction score (0.23) was\nclose to the mean for all specialties (0.28).\nResults\nTables 1 and 2 present relative frequencies and mean sat-\nisfaction scores for each of the control variables as well as\nthe \"lifestyle controllability\" variable.

In addition to the steady\n(non-erratic) hours, encounters with inspirational sen-\niors, and enduring relationships this specialty is enjoying\nincreasing demand as baby boomers retire[23]. Geriatri-\ncians were also high on the list that did not adjust for any\ncovariates (ranked second in Table 3). But caution should\nbe exercised in interpreting these findings.

A literature search and\ndiscussions with local experts did not reveal any obvious\nreasons why changes in satisfaction would have occurred\nThe low career satisfaction for neurological surgery and\nobstetrics and gynecology specialists may have several\ncauses: irregular hours, medical malpractice lawsuits; loss\nof autonomy; and secular decline in pay compared to\nother specialties[4,29,30]. This low career satisfaction\nmight also be explained by the high expectations these\nphysicians had when they entered these \"top tier\" special-\nties versus the current realities of practice. When career\nexpectations are not met, when workers feel cheated, evi-\ndence of career dissatisfaction is widespread within most\njobs, not just medical ones[31]. Interestingly, these results\nmight generalize to other countries. Lambert et al[32] find\nevidence that younger physicians in England reject surgi-\ncal specialties and obstetrics and gynecology for reasons\nrelating to \"quality of life\" and work hours.\nOur results on career satisfaction suggest some effect of\nlifestyle, especially \"uncontrollable\" lifestyle. (Bottom of\nTable 2 and entire Table 6). If the CTS had information on\nthree key \"controllable\" specialties ---anesthesiology,\ndiagnostic radiology, and pathology---- our multiple\nregression results for the \"controllable \" specialties may\nhave been stronger. It is worth noting that two of the\n\"uncontrollable\" specialties, pediatrics and internal med-\nicine and pediatrics (combined), rank very high on the\nsatisfaction scale in Tables 2 and 3. Nevertheless, overall,\nour results parallel those observed among medical stu-\ndents, for whom lifestyle controllability outranked\nincome as an influence on career choice[8]..\nThe lack of statistical significance for age 75+ might be\ndue to the small \"n\" within that age bracket(1.7% of sam-\nple). The positive and statistically significant results on\nthe remaining age categories and relatively large coeffi-\ncients in the lowest and highest ranges suggested a U-\nthe highest levels of satisfaction. This might be due to the\nidealism of youth and the fact that most physicians in\nretirement age who choose not to retire must enjoy what\nthey do.\nOur statistically insignificant results on gender reflect the\nambiguity in the literature. McMurray et al[33] find\nwomen more dissatisfied than men. Keeton et al[29], on\nthe other hand, find among physicians practicing obstet-\nrics and gynecology, females are more satisfied than\nmales.\nWe found statistically insignificant results for non-His-\npanic African-Americans. The social science literature on\nmany other jobs, however, finds African-Americans more\ndissatisfied with their jobs[34]. It could be that the medi-\ncal profession may be one of the first to achieve racial par-\nity for career satisfaction.\nhours-per-week) were strongly and positively associated\nWork hours appeared to have become an even more\nare becoming increasingly concerned with work-life bal-\nindicate that graduation from a foreign medical school\nwas a statistically significant predictor of lower satisfac-\ntion. It may be that the shortage of American physicians\nhas resulted in better career opportunities for interna-\ntinued to be strongly and positively associated with satis-\nfaction. Income, in fact, appeared to be among the most\nThis is consistent with economics literature suggesting\nthat income is the most important predictor for most\njobs[31]. This is also one of the reasons we reported rank-\nings unadjusted for any covariates in Table 3.\nThe finding that physicians currently employed in medi-\ncal schools was unexpected. It could be due to the intrinsic\nrewards of intellectual stimulation, collaborative research,\nand creative expression associated with academic life[37].\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nfindings also indicate a difference for percent of revenue\nfrom managed care. Whereas managed care may be hav-\ning a waning influence on the public, it may continue to\nexert influence on physicians[38].\nImplications\nAs indicated in the earlier study,7 these results might be\nuseful to medical students contemplating specialty\nchoice. Presumably, medical students might select a spe-\ncialty with high rather than low satisfaction, other things\nequal.. Specialty societies may also have interest in the\nresults since they are concerned about the well-being of\ncurrent members and the impression new medical stu-\ndents have of their specialty.\nA free market for physicians would operate to improve the\nlowest ranking specialties since employers and payers\nwould be forced to improve working conditions or wages\nto continue to attract high-quality personnel. But free\nmarket forces are weak in the regulated physician market.\nMedical group directors, HMO managers, insurance and\nMedicare executives, policy makers, and residency direc-\ntors, may want to take direct action to improve career sat-\nisfaction among specialties that have especially low\nscores. Given the strong and consistent relations among\nincome and work hours on the one hand and satisfaction,\npolicy suggestions might include raising payments or\nreducing work hours for certain specialties. More research\nis needed to elucidate the reasons for low satisfaction\nwithin particular specialties in order to develop policy\nsolutions.\nThese results may have implications for the future mix of\nspecialists There may be fewer medical students entering\nobstetrics and gynecology or neurological surgery. Given\nthe critical nature of these specialties, there may also be\nimplications for public health.\nLimitations\nFirst, the data are self-reported. However, only the physi-\ncian knows his or her level of satisfaction. Secondly, even\ndata in earlier survey rounds--with roughly 29% of these\nrespondents providing data in all three earlier rounds--we\ndid not perform a longitudinal data analysis on the subset\nof respondents who participated in earlier rounds, opting\nsample that provides the most contemporary and straight-\nforward look at the broadest range of specialties. It is dif-\nficult to assign causal relations using cross-sectional data.\nBut many of the results are consistent with causal relations\nasserted by other researchers. For example, Clark and\nOswald[31] assert that high income improves satisfaction\nand Becker et al[4] assert that changes in the past 20 years\nhave resulted in growing numbers of dissatisfied obstet-\nrics and gynecology physicians. Third, whereas the\nresponse rates may differ across specialties, the CTS\nadministrators believe these data are representative of\nAnother limitation is our use of a single dependent varia-\nble that ranged from +1 to -1. This variable was not nor-\nmally distributed and linear regression might result in\npredicted values outside the +1 and -1 range. However,\nthe validity of our regression-based inferences using this\ndependent variable ultimately rests on the approximate\nnormality of our regression coefficients. Although the\nquality of this approximation can only be assured by the\nCentral Limit Theorem asymptotically, (i.e. for arbitrarily\nlarge sample sizes), we have followed standard practices\nto promote acceptably accurate approximations[39]. In\nparticular, our scoring of the response variable increased\nthe symmetry of its distribution and we purposely\nrestricted the categorical independent variables in our\nanalyses to those with moderately large number of\nrespondents in each category. A separate problem is that\nour dependent variable measured satisfaction and dissat-\nisfaction along the same scale. It could be that satisfaction\nand dissatisfaction are different concepts and require dif-\nferent survey questions for measurement. Alternatively, if\ncould be that this scaling masks the importance of inde-\npendent variables that have strong but offsetting effects on\nboth satisfaction and dissatisfaction\nA final limitation involves some specialties with few\nincumbents. These include pediatric emergency medicine\n(n = 29), other medical subspecialties (n = 20), thoracic\nsurgery (n = 21), critical care internal medicine (n = 29),\nhematology and oncology (n = 23), and neurological sur-\ngery (n = 24). Caution should be exercised when interpret-\ning results for these specialties.\nWe are nevertheless confident in the overall results for sev-\neral reasons. First, the CTS data are reliable, highly\nregarded, and used in numerous studies[15,17]. Second, a\nnumber of specialties, e.g. pediatrics and obstetrics and\ngynecology, are well-known for their satisfaction and dis-\nsatisfaction and our results coincide with these wide-\nspread beliefs. Finally, results on many covariates\n(income, hours, managed care) are consistent with other\nConclusion\nCareer satisfaction varies by specialty. It is important for\nresidency directors, policy makers, physicians and medi-\ncal students to understand these inter-specialty differences\nas they make personal, professional, and policy choices.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nDT carried out all statistical analyses, contributed ideas to\nmodeling, interpreted findings, prepared draft paragraphs\nin the Methods section, reviewed and made suggestions\nfor entire manuscript.
