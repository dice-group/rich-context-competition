Up-to-date information about\nLHDs is important to organizations like NACCHO,\nwhich support and represent LHDs, and to public\nhealth practitioners and policymakers at the state and\nfederal levels. Data and information from the Profile\nstudy are used in many ways beyond serving as the\nnation's surveillance system for LHDs. The LHDs use\nthe information to benchmark themselves nationally\nand against LHDs that are similar to their own. As\none LHD leader said, \"We can compare things like our\nrange of services with the national average and our ca-\npacity and funding. We continually compare ourselves\nto other departments in our state, [to] other metro areas,\nand to other large LHDs in the data set.\"\nThe Profile data are one of the most important and\nfrequently used data sets in the field of public health\nsystems and services research. The Profile studies' na-\ntional reach, wide range of topics, and high response\nrates (recent Profile has achieved response rates of 80%\nor higher) contribute to the value of these data for re-\nsearch. In addition, the inclusion of many questions in\nmultiple Profile questionnaires supports longitudinal\nanalyses.

In addition to\nthe core topics included in each Profile study, the 2010\nquestionnaire included modules (asked of nationally\nrepresentative stratified random samples of approxi-\nmately 625 LHDs) with questions on quality improve-\nment, accreditation preparation, emergency prepared-\nness, information technology, practice-based research,\naccess to health care services, and public health and the\nlaw. The paragraphs below summarize a few findings\nLHD accreditation\nThe Public Health Accreditation Board launched a vol-\nuntary national accreditation program for state, local,\ntribal, and territorial public health agencies in Septem-\nabout intent to seek voluntary national accreditation\nsuggest a high level of interest among LHDs in the\nnational accreditation program. Sixteen percent of re-\nspondents strongly agreed and 34% agreed that their\nLHD would seek national accreditation. Furthermore,\n8% of LHDs strongly agreed and 21% agreed that their\nLHD would seek national accreditation within the first\n2 years of the program.\nThe Public Health Accreditation Board has estab-\nlished certain prerequisites for LHDs that wish to apply\nfor national accreditation, including completing a com-\nmunity health assessment, community health improve-\nment plan, and agency-wide strategic plan within the\npast 5 years. Data from the 2010 Profile study suggest\nthat only 20% of LHDs have met all 3 of these prerequi-\nsites, and there is little difference in completion of the\n3 prerequisites based on interest in seeking accredita-\ntion. These findings suggest that, although a relatively\nlarge number of LHDs are interested in seeking na-\ntional accreditation, many of them have not completed\nall of the assessment and planning activities required\nfor accreditation. These assessment and planning activ-\nities are time- and resource-intensive and require spe-\ncific skill sets. Many LHDs, particularly those that have\nexperienced funding and staff reductions, may be chal-\nlenged to marshal the resources required to complete\nthe accreditation prerequisites.\nAging of the LHD workforce\nThe aging of the US workforce is well documented.\n65 years and older increased 101%, compared with a\nmuch smaller increase of 59% for total employment\n(aged 16 years and older).1 Several Profile studies have\ncollected data on age of LHD top executives, and these\ndata confirm that their age distribution is shifting up-\nward.

In the current\neconomic climate, funds to support LHD staff train-\ning are limited, and many employees have taken on\nadditional responsibilities in response to staffing cuts.\nThis scarcity in both time and money presents great\nchallenges to workforce development at a critical time.\nA wave of top executive retirements also has the po-\ntential to accelerate the trends of shared resources (eg,\none top executive serving multiple LHDs) and agency\nconsolidation, especially in a time of budget cuts. In\nseveral states where jurisdiction consolidation has oc-\ncurred during the past decade (eg, Connecticut, New\nJersey, Ohio), retirement of the top executive has been\ncited as a factor that facilitated these \"mergers.\" Shar-\ning the costly resource of a top executive, via either\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The\nmedian amount of LHD revenue for EP activities (from\n$2 per capita, a small proportion of overall LHD fund-\ning.

Eighty-four percent of LHDs\nreceived preparedness funding from this source, and\n59% of LHDs relied exclusively on federal funding\nto carry out their preparedness activities. Data from\nthe 2010 Profile demonstrate that LHDs rely heavily\non both their own non-EP staff and volunteers to re-\nspond to all-hazards events. On average, LHDs used\nup to 70% of staff not otherwise dedicated to EP when\nresponding to the H1N1 influenza outbreak and 30%\nof staff when responding to a natural disaster. Conse-\nquently, staff cuts have reduced many LHDs' capacity\nto respond to emergencies. Nearly all LHDs engage vol-\nunteers for EP, most frequently from Medical Reserve\nCorps units, Community Emergency Response Teams,\nand the American Red Cross. The median number of\nple for LHDs serving jurisdictions with populations of\nThe importance of LHDs' role in EP underscores the\nneed for a robust preparedness and response plan and\na trained workforce. Proper training of volunteers and\nnon-EP staff is important to ensure the quality of LHDs'\nresponse to emergencies.\nAccess to health care services\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n(PPACA) of 2010 has reinvigorated the health care de-\nlivery and policy focus on prevention and health pro-\nmotion rather than on sick care.3 This development will\nlikely increase LHDs' existing interest in disease pre-\nvention through improved access to primary care in\ntheir communities. By ensuring timely and affordable\naccess to primary care, LHDs can play a major role in\npreventing unnecessary suffering, death, and hospital-\nization costs.\nThe Profile study results show that, although LHDs\nare already involved in promoting access to care, their\nrole can be expanded. During the 12 months prior to\nthe 2010 survey, most LHDs actively promoted access\nto medical, dental, and behavioral health care services\nwithin their jurisdictions. Nearly two-thirds were in-\nvolved in assessing gaps in access to 1 or more health\ncare services. The same proportion implemented some\nstrategies to increase accessibility of services. Two in 3\nLHDs also implemented strategies to target the health\ncare needs of underserved populations. Nearly half of\nthe LHDs directly provided clinical care services to ad-\ndress the needs of underserved populations.\nImprovement in public health capacity is one of the\ncentral canons of the PPACA. The PPACA includes ini-\ntiatives that focus on removing barriers to accessing\nclinical preventative services and developing healthier\ncommunities. The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention has already announced grants for state health\ndepartments, large LHDs, and community-based or-\nganizations to improve health in their communities.3,4\nThe LHDs should prepare to seize these opportuni-\nties, which are intended to promote the goals that\nare also central to their mission--creating healthier\ncommunities.\n Accessing Profile Information and Data\nInformation from the Profile studies is available in\nmany formats, most of which can be accessed online at\nwww.naccho.org/profile. Reports that detail the Pro-\nfile studies' findings are available for all Profile studies\nexcept the 1996 Profile. Additional products that exam-\nine some issues in greater detail (eg, LHD workforce)\nare available for the more recent Profile studies.
