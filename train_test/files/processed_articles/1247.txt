We investigated the\nassociation of social activity with late-life physical func-\ntioning, cognitive functioning, and depression\nsymptomatology using data from 1112 pairs of like-sex\ntwins who participated in the Longitudinal Study of\nAging Danish Twins. Consistent with previous\nresearch, we found that social activity was significantly\ncorrelated with overall level of physical functioning,\ncognitive functioning, and depression symptomatol-\nogy. We also found that social activity was significantly\nand moderately heritable (estimate of .36), raising the\npossibility that its association with late-life functioning\nmight reflect selection processes. Further, social activ-\nity did not predict change in functioning and in\nmonozygotic twin pairs discordant on level of social\nactivity, the more socially active twin was not less sus-\nceptible to age decreases in physical and cognitive\nfunctioning and increases in depression symptomatol-\nogy than the less socially active twin. These results are\ninterpreted in the context of the additional finding that\nnonshared environmental factors, although apparently\nnot social activity, are the predominant determinant of\nchanges in late-life functioning.\nThe hypothesis that an active lifestyle is essential to\nliving a happy, healthy and long life is the basis for\npublic health recommendations (National Institute\nof Health [NIH], 1996), and is captured by the\npopular maxim, `Use it or lose it'. Nonetheless,\nalthough an active and engaged lifestyle undoubt-\nedly contributes to physical, psychological and\ncognitive health in late life, it has been difficult for\nresearchers to precisely quantify and characterize\nthe nature of this contribution. Several factors have\ncontributed to the difficulty of unambiguously\nidentifying the effect of an active lifestyle. The\nassociation between activity and functioning, rather\nthan reflecting a direct causal influence, may owe\nto their common correlation with other lifestyle\nand medical risk factors. Individuals who are active\nare also likely to not smoke, not be obese, be highly\neducated, and have good access to health care\nStatistical adjustment for confounded effects is a\ncommon, and we believe legitimate, approach to\ntrying to isolate the effect of a variable of interest\n(e.g., estimating the association of physical activity\nand late-life health controlling statistically for the\ncorrelation of both with other lifestyle factors like\nsmoking and weight). Nonetheless, statistical\ncontrol alone cannot entirely resolve the issue of\ncausal ambiguity since a residual association could\nalways be accounted for by some unmeasured\ncovariate.\nA related, and we believe more significant, issue\nis what has been termed the `selection problem' --\nthe possibility that the association between activity\nand indicators of late-life functioning reflect the\nlifestyle selections of genetically healthier individuals\nwith an inherited disposition for high cognitive func-\ntioning may be more likely to engage in intellectual\npursuits than individuals without this inherited advan-\ntage simply because their genetic constitution makes\nthese activities easier and more enjoyable to engage in.\nThe selection problem, which is characterized as a\ngene\u00adenvironment correlation by behavioral geneti-\ncists, raises the possibility that the association of\nlifestyle factors with late-life functioning may reflect\nthe causal influence of the latter on the former\nrather than the converse.\nExperimental interventions are the most direct way\nof resolving the contribution of lifestyle factors to late-\nlife functioning. Nonetheless, the effects of short-term\nbut intense lifestyle changes may not adequately capture\nthe long-term impact of lifestyle factors that play out\nover the course of many years rather than just several\nweeks. Alternatively, investigators have used prospective\nlongitudinal studies in an attempt to resolve causal\nambiguity.

Crowe et al. (2003)\nprovide an illustration of the use of co-twin controls to\naddress the selection problem. Replicating previous\nresearch, these investigators found that individuals who\ndevelop Alzheimer's disease (AD) were less likely than\ncontrols to have had an active lifestyle 20 years prior to\ntheir clinical evaluation. But does the lower rate of activ-\nity seen in individuals who develop AD reflect a direct\ncausal influence of leisure activity on risk of AD, or\nmight reduced activity be an early consequence of the\ncognitive deficiencies experienced by individuals who\ndevelop AD, due perhaps to reduced cognitive reserve\nthat reduced activity differentiates cases from controls\nwithin twin pairs discordant for developing AD, Crowe\net al. (2003) were able to conclude that genetic selection\neffects could not account entirely for the observed associ-\nation of activity with AD.\nThe present study uses the co-twin control method to\ninvestigate the relationship of social activity with three\ndomains of late-life functioning: physical functioning,\ncognitive functioning, and depression symptomatology.\nWe make use of a large sample of over 1000 pairs of like-\nsex twin participants in the Longitudinal Study of Aging\nDanish Twins (LSADT; Christensen et al., 1999) to\naddress the following questions:\n1. What is the nature of late-life age changes in physi-\ncal functioning, cognitive functioning, depression\nsymptomatology, and social activity?\n2. To what extent do genetic and environmental\nfactors contribute to initial status and change in\nphysical functioning, cognitive functioning, and\ndepression symptomatology?\n3. How are the genetic and environmental contribu-\ntions to initial status and change in physical\nfunctioning, cognitive functioning, and depression\nsymptomatology related to social activity?\n4. In monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs selected to be dis-\ncordant for social activity, does the more active twin\nshow higher levels and reduced change in physical\nfunctioning, cognitive functioning, and depression\nsymptomatology relative to the less active twin?\nMethod\nSample\nThe sample is taken from participants in the LSADT, a\ncohort sequential study of elderly Danish twins.\nLSADT began in 1995 with an assessment of all\nMatt McGue and Kaare Christensen\nmembers of like-sex twin pairs born in Denmark before\nlowed at 2-year intervals. Figure 1 gives a schematic\nrepresentation of the number of participants across the\nmultiple waves of participation. Table 1 gives some\nbasic demographic characteristics of the sample. A total\nof 4731 twins have completed an intake LSADT assess-\nment. Twins were recruited to participate regardless of\nwhether their co-twin was alive. Consequently, many of\nthe participants in LSADT are `singleton twins'; the full\nsample includes only 1152 pairs in which both\nmembers completed an intake assessment. As can be\nseen, rate of participation has been excellent over the\nmultiple waves of LSADT, with participation rates gen-\nerally falling between 70% and 80%. A detailed\ndescription of the LSADT sample as well as an analysis\nof nonparticipants can be found in Christensen et al.\nThe sample for the current study is based on like-\nsex twins pairs in which both members participated in\nLSADT. Among the 1152 participating pairs, zygosity\ncould not be determined for 19 pairs and 21 pairs were\ndropped because they were opposite-sex dizygotic twin\npairs, a small number of which had been sampled in\nmonozygotic male (MZM), 246 dizygotic male (DZM),\nfemale (DZF).\nParticipants were usually assessed in their homes by\none of approximately 100 interviewers. The interview-\ners were employed by the Danish National Institute of\nSocial Research, which has extensive experience in\n1990). Interviewers completed a detailed training\nprogram 2 months prior to each survey initiation and\nwere closely monitored during the survey period. Many\nof the interviewers participated in multiple LSADT\nwaves. To minimize bias, the two members of a twin\npair were always assessed by different interviewers.\nInterviews typically lasted approximately 75 minutes\nand included assessment of demographic background,\nmedical and physical health, depression symptomatol-\nogy and cognitive testing.\nMeasures\nThe current study uses standard measures of physical,\ncognitive and emotional functioning that have been\nused in several previous LSADT studies as well as a\nmeasure of social activity, which is introduced in the\npresent study.\nPhysical functioning. Our self-reported assessment of\nphysical functioning is based on an adaptation of an\ninstrument that was developed and previously validated\nin Denmark (Avlund et al., 1995) and has been admin-\nistered essentially unchanged throughout LSADT. Here\nwe use the Strength scale, which consists of 11 items\n(e.g., walk up two flights of stairs) each responded to\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The Strength\nscale is the average of the 11 individual responses. The\nStrength scale has high internal consistency and reliabil-\nity (> .90) and is relatively stable (two-year stability is\ngenerally .60 or greater).\nCognitive functioning. The cognitive battery includes\nthe Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et\nal., 1975), and five brief cognitive tests selected to be\nsensitive to age-related changes (McGue & Christensen,\n2001). The MMSE is a standard neurological screen\nthat is especially effective for screening at the low end\nof cognitive functioning. In our sample, the MMSE is\nboth internally consistent (.75) and temporally stable\n(2-year stability r = .64). The brief cognitive tests\ninclude a verbal fluency task (categories, the number of\nanimals named in 1 minute), forward and backward\ndigit span, and immediate and delayed recall of a 12-\nitem list. The five individual cognitive measures are\nIntake assessment\nLSADT\nParticipation in the multiple waves of the LSADT.

Our assessment of\ndepression symptomatology is based on an adaptation of\nthe depression section of the Cambridge Mental\nDisorders of the Elderly Examination (CAMDEX; Roth\net al., 1986). The Depression scale used here is a com-\nposite of responses to 17 depression items and is\ndescribed more fully in McGue and Christensen (1997).\nThe scale has high internal consistency reliability (.83)\nand is moderately stable over a two-year period (.64).\nSocial activity. The Social Activity scale is based on six\nitems that assess the frequency with which the individual\nis engaged with others (e.g., how often do you leave\nyour home, how often do you go to a party) and mental\npursuits (e.g., how often to you engage in a hobby).\nEach item is rated on a 1 (Never) to 4 (5\u00ad7 days a week)\nscale. The composite scale is moderately internally con-\nsistent (.51) but quite stable over a 2-year interval (r =\n.88). Because the Social Activity scale was not adminis-\ntered in LSADT until 1997, all analyses reported on here\nare based on the 1997 and subsequent assessments.\nAnalysis\nFour different types of analyses were undertaken to\ninvestigate the relationship of social activity with\nlate-life functioning. First, growth curve models were\nfit to each of the four outcome variables as well as\nSocial Activity. These analyses were undertaken using\nSAS Proc Mixed to account for the clustered structure\nof the data. The growth curve analyses allowed us to\ndescribe how each of the variables we are investigating\nwas associated with age and thus provided a founda-\ntion for all subsequent analyses.\nSecond, biometric growth curve models were fit to\neach of the four outcome variables, Strength,\nDepression, MMSE, and the Cognitive Composite,\nusing the methods described by Neale and McArdle\n(2000). In the biometric growth curve model, a\nschematic representation of which is given in Figure 2,\nthe variance of an observed score at any wave is\nmodeled as a function of an overall level effect (L), a\nrate-of-change or slope effect (S), and wave-specific\nresidual effects. Using standard biometric assump-\ntions, the slope, level and residual effects can be\nfurthered decomposed into additive genetic (A),\nshared environmental (C) and nonshared environmen-\ntal (E) components. Although in principle we could\nmodel biometric contributions to quadratic and higher\norder moments of change given that we had up to five\nwaves of data, we elected to include only a linear term\nbecause only a small proportion of our sample had\nthree or four data points and it is difficult to reliably\nassess individual differences in higher order moments\nwith this number of observations (Bryk &\nMatt McGue and Kaare Christensen\nAL\nCL\nEL\nES\nCS\nAS\naL\ncL eL\neS\ncS aS\nr\nE\nr\nA\nr\nC\nThe biometric growth curve model. For ease of presentation, the model depicts phenotypic assessments (Pi) on up to four waves of assessment\n(i = 1, 4) rather than the full six waves in LSADT. Underlying the individual phenotypic scores at each wave is an initial value or level (L) effect, a\nlinear rate-of-change or slope (S) effect, and wave-specific residual effects. L, S and the residuals are each in turn decomposed into underlying\nadditive genetic (A), shared environmental (C), and nonshared environmental (E) effects.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

These models\nallowed us to investigate the correlation of initial level\nof Social Activity with initial level and change in each\nof the four outcomes, and to estimate the genetic and\nenvironmental contributions to these correlations.\nFinally as a supplement to the expanded biometric\ngrowth curve analyses, we identified a set of MZ twins\ndiscordant on initial level of Social Activity and investi-\ngated whether these twins also differed on initial level\nand change in each of the four outcomes.\nResults\nIndividual Growth Curve Analysis\nAn individual-level growth curve model was fit to\neach of the five variables using SAS Proc Mixed.\nIndependent variables included age, squared age, sex,\nand the interactions of sex with age and age squared.\nIn all cases the age main effect was statistically signifi-\ncant at p < .01, and the quadratic age effect was\nsignificant for all variables except Depression. The sex\nmain effect was significant for all variables except the\ntwo cognitive outcomes, MMSE and the Cognitive\nComposite, but none of the interactions of sex with\nage and squared age were statistically significant.\nFigure 3 gives the fitted group mean growth curves for\nfemales (Figure 3a) and males (Figure 3b). To facilitate\ninterpretation, each of the five variables was scaled to\nhave a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of\n10 (i.e., a T-score metric) in the overall sample. As is\nevident from the graphs, the average change in func-\ntioning over the age range spanned by LSADT\n(approximately age 70 to 100) is substantial for both\nStrength and MMSE (somewhat greater than a 3 SD\ndecline) and moderate for both the Cognitive\nComposite (a 2 SD decline) and Depression (a 1.5 SD\nincrease). Interestingly, Social Activity is also signifi-\ncantly, albeit more modestly, associated with age,\ndeclining by a little over 1 SD on average between age\nBiometric Growth Curve Analysis\nThe biometric growth curve model described by Neale\nand McArdle (2000) and depicted in Figure 2 was fit\nto each of the four outcome variables using the Mx\nsoftware system (Neale et al., 1999). To account for\nthe cohort-sequential nature of the LSADT design,\nwhich resulted in a varying number of observations on\nstudy participants, models were fit to the raw data\nunder the assumption that data were missing at\nrandom (Little & Rubin, 1989). Only the full growth\nmodel (i.e., A, C and E effects on level, slope and the\nresiduals) was fit for each variable. Submodels were\nnot fit because in this initial biometric analysis we\nwanted to assess the contribution of all potential\nAge\nT-Score\nStrength\nDepression\nMMSE\nCognitive\nActivity\na\nAge\nT-Score\nStrength\nDepression\nMMSE\nCognitive\nActivity\nb\nGroup average growth curves for females (a) and males (b).

Martin et al., 1978). As an alternative to\nformal hypothesis testing, we provide confidence inter-\nvals for the standardized variance component estimates\nin Table 2. For all four outcomes, the genetic contribu-\ntion to individual differences in initial value (i.e., the\nintercept) was moderate and statistically significant\n(i.e., as judged by the confidence interval not including\n0). Estimates of shared environmental effects on initial\nlevel of functioning were effectively zero for Strength\nand Depression but moderate and statistically signifi-\ncant for both of the cognitive measures. Nonshared\nenvironmental effects accounted for at least half of the\nvariance in initial level of functioning for all outcomes\nexcept the Cognitive Composite, where it accounted for\napproximately a third of the variance.\nThe pattern of standardized variance component\nestimates for the slope (change) scores is quite different\nfrom that for the intercept scores. Heritability estimates\nare uniformly small, and in only one case, for Strength,\nwas the estimate statistically significant. Similarly, there\nis little evidence for shared environmental contributions\nto change in functioning \u00ad none of the shared environ-\nmental variance estimates was statistically significant.\nThe major source of individual differences in change is\nnonshared environmental factors, which accounted for\nbetween 69% (Depression) and 82% (Strength) of the\nvariance in change.\nRelationship of Social Activity to Late-Life Functioning\nThe biometric growth model depicted in Figure 2 was\nexpanded to include intake Social Activity as a covari-\nate and refit to each of the four outcome variables. The\naim of these analyses was to estimate the contribution\nof Social Activity to both initial level and change in\neach of the four outcome variables and to determine the\nextent to which the association between Social Activity\nand late-life functioning was attributable to common\ngenetic and common environmental factors. Before\nfitting these models, the standard univariate ACE\nmodel was fit to the intake Social Activity scores. The\nstandardized variance component estimates (95% con-\nfidence intervals) from this model were: a2 = .36 (.21,\nthe shared environmental contribution to variance in\nSocial Activity was estimated to be 0.0, this parameter\nwas fixed to 0.0 when fitting the extended growth\nmodels. Shared environmental parameters were also\nfixed to 0.0 for Strength and Depression, since esti-\nmates of these parameters were near zero in the initial\ngrowth model analyses, but not fixed to 0.0 for MMSE\nand the Cognitive Composite, where the initial growth\ncurve analyses provided evidence for shared environ-\nmental effects.\nParameter estimates describing the association of\nSocial Activity with late-life functioning along with\ntheir associated confidence intervals are given in\nTable 3. At the phenotypic level, the correlation\nbetween activity and initial level of functioning was in\nevery case statistically significant. The magnitude of\nthis correlation in absolute value ranged from .21 for\nMMSE to .53 for Strength. Thus, individuals who were\nhighly engaged socially were physically and cognitively\nmore able and less likely to experience symptoms of\ndepression than individuals with low levels of social\nengagement. Social Activity was, however, only mod-\nestly associated with change in functioning. The\nphenotypic correlation between Social Activity and the\nslope was near-zero and nonsignificant for both of the\ncognitive measures, and modest (r = .18) but significant\nfor Strength. This correlation was also significant for\nthe Depression slope (r = .22), although in this case the\ndirection of correlation is counterintuitive, with rate of\nincrease in depression being greatest among the most\nsocially engaged individuals.\nAlso given in the table is the proportion of each phe-\nnotypic correlation attributable to genetic factors.

Genetic factors\naccounted for a majority of the correlation between\nSocial Activity and each of the intercepts and essentially\naccounted for the entire correlation between Social\nActivity and each of the slopes.\nCo-Twin Control Analysis of Social Activity\nOur final analysis involved a discordant MZ twin\nanalysis of the relationship between Social Activity\nand the four late-life functioning measures. Among the\n356 MZ twin pairs where both members had com-\npleted the Social Activity scale at intake, we identified\nthose whose Social Activity scores differed by at least\n1.5 SDs. While the decision to use a threshold of 1.5\nSDs is admittedly arbitrary, it did provide a large\nenough sample of discordant MZ twins (N = 70) to\nproduce statistically reliable results. The sample of dis-\ncordant MZ twins was 63% female and had an\naverage (SD) age of 75.7 (5.2) at the time they com-\npleted the Social Activity measure. For each of the\nfour outcomes, the discordant twin sample was ana-\nlyzed using individual growth curve analysis using SAS\nProc Mixed. In these analyses, the independent vari-\nables were sex, age, squared age, Social Activity level\n(i.e., the high vs. the low scoring twin) and the interac-\ntion of Social Activity with age.

We\ndiscuss the implications of these findings for under-\nstanding the nature of late-life functioning and the\ninfluence of social activity on that functioning.\nThe Nature of Late-Life Functioning in Physical and Cognitive\nFunctioning and Depression\nOur individual growth curve analyses confirm earlier\nresearch showing that on average physical functioning\n(Frederiksen et al., 2006) and cognitive functioning\n(Salthouse & Ferrer-Caja, 2003) decline while depres-\nsion symptomatology (Gatz & Hurwicz, 1990)\nincreases with age. Perhaps most notable in these\nanalyses is the magnitude of the age-related change,\nestimated to be approximately a 3 SD decline in physi-\ncal functioning, a 2 SD decline in cognitive\nfunctioning, and a 1.5 SD increase in depression\nThe biometric extension of the individual-growth\ncurve analyses allowed us to estimate genetic and envi-\nronmental contributions to late-life functioning and\nchange.

Nonetheless, the overall strength of\ngenetic contributions to individual differences in each\nof the three major domains of late-life functioning we\ninvestigated is at best moderate. Clearly environmen-\ntal factors play a very important role.\nThis conclusion gains further support from our\nbiometric analysis of change. In every case, the heri-\ntability of change in functioning (as reflected by the\nslope) was estimated to be small. The estimated heri-\ntability for the slope was .12 for MMSE, .18 for the\nCognitive Composite, and .06 for Depression, all non-\nsignificant values. Moreover, although the heritability\nfor change in Strength was statistically significant, the\nestimate (a2 = .14) was also modest. Our results are\nthus consistent with earlier studies (e.g., Christensen et\nnonshared environmental factors are the major con-\ntributors to linear change in late-life functioning.\nWorth noting is that in the biometric growth model\nmeasurement error, which typically is apportioned to\nthe estimate of nonshared environment, is included in\nthe residual terms. Consequently, our finding of strong\nnonshared environmental effects on the slope is not\nattributable to the unreliability of measurement.\nThe Role of Social Activity in Late-Life Functioning\nEpidemiologists have repeatedly shown that individu-\nals who are socially and intellectually engaged in late\nlife are more likely to be physically (Prohaska et al.,\net al., 2002) fit and are less susceptible to depression\n(Cacioppo et al., 2006) than those who experience rel-\natively low levels of social and intellectual stimulation.\nOur findings confirm the existence of these associa-\ntions. Our measure of Social Activity correlated\nsignificantly and moderately with all four of our out-\ncomes. Specifically, in growth curve analyses we found\nthat Social Activity correlated .53 with initial value for\nStrength, \u00ad.38 with initial Depression, .21 with initial\nMMSE, and .44 with initial Cognitive Composite.\nAlthough the association of social activity with late-\nlife functioning has often been interpreted to reflect a\ncausal influence of the former on the latter, selection\neffects cannot be ruled out. That is, it is possible that\nthe association arises because high functioning indi-\nviduals are more likely to be socially and intellectually\nactive in late life than low functioning individuals.\nOur finding that Social Activity is significantly and\nmoderately heritable (a2 = .36) supports the possibility\nof selection effects. Selection effects were further\nimplicated by our finding that the association of Social\nActivity with initial level of functioning was in every\ncase primarily genetically mediated. Specifically, the\nproportion of the phenotypic correlation between\nSocial Activity and initial level of functioning\nattributable to genetic effects ranged from .50 for\nStrength to .78 for the Cognitive Composite.\nTwo sets of analyses were undertaken in an attempt\nto rule out the possibility that selection effects could\naccount entirely for the association of Social Activity\nand late-life functioning in our sample. First, for each\noutcome we determined whether initial levels of Social\nActivity predicted change in functioning. The correla-\ntion between Social Activity and change in cognitive\nfunctioning was near-zero for both MMSE (r = .03) and\nthe Cognitive Composite (r = \u00ad.02). For Depression the\ncorrelation between Social Activity and change was\nopposite in sign to what would we expected (i.e., we\nfound greatest increases in depression among those\nwith highest initial levels of social activity), and conse-\nquently likely to be a statistical anomaly. Only for\nStrength did we find a significant association between\nSocial Activity and change, although even here the cor-\nrelation was only modest in magnitude (r = .18). Our\nlongitudinal analyses thus do not support a strong\ncausal contribution of Social Activity.\nOur co-twin control analysis also do not support\nthe existence of a strong causal influence of social\nactivity on late-life functioning. We identified 70 pairs\nof MZ twins whose Social Activity scores differed by\nat least 1.5 SDs. Consistent with our finding of signifi-\ncant correlations between Social Activity and initial\nlevels of functioning in the growth curve analyses, the\nmore socially active twin scored significantly higher in\nStrength and on the Cognitive Composite and signifi-\ncantly lower on Depression than the less socially\nactive twin. The difference for MMSE was in the same\ndirection but not statistically significant. Thus there\nare environmental contributions to the association\nbetween late-life functioning and social activity,\nalthough the existence of these common environmen-\ntal effects does not rule out selection processes. Most\ncritical is whether the discordant MZ twins differed in\nchange in functioning over time. In this regard our\nfindings are unambiguous -- we found no evidence\nthat the more socially active twin was less susceptible\nto age-related changes in physical functioning, cogni-\ntive functioning, and depression symptomatology than\nthe less socially active twin.\nOur failure to find evidence that social activity\ncontributes to change in late-life functioning is some-\nwhat surprising in light of findings from the biometric\ngrowth curve analyses. These analyses showed that\nnonshared environmental factors were the major\nsource of change in the outcomes we investigated, and\nreview of recent gerontological research would likely\nlead to the conclusion that social engagement is a\nprime candidate underlying that change. Moreover,\nunivariate analysis of our social activity measure\nrevealed that approximately two-thirds of the variance\nin this measure was associated with nonshared envi-\nronmental factors. Nonetheless, social activity\naccounted for little of the nonshared environmental\neffects on initial levels of functioning and essentially\nMatt McGue and Kaare Christensen\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

If not social activity, then what are the factors\nthat account for the substantial nonshared environ-\nmental influences our analyses imply exist? We favor\ntwo alternative hypotheses. First, individual differences\nin age-related change may be largely stochastic and\nidiosyncratic. In their review of the literature at earlier\ndevelopmental stages, Turkheimer and Waldron (2000)\nconcluded that there was little evidence that nonshared\nenvironmental influences on behavior were systematic,\na scenario characterized as `gloomy' since it implies that\nmajor environmental influences will not be identified\nbecause they do not exist (Plomin & Daniels, 1987).\nSecond, our failure may stem from the nature of our\nenvironmental assessment. Our social activity measure\nwas based on a single assessment in late life. An under-\nstanding of environmental contributions to late-life\nfunctioning may, however, require a broader develop-\nmental perspective. In particular, since the habits and\nattitudes established earlier in life may have profound\neffects on late-life functioning, we hypothesize that\nexperiences in mid-life may be more critical to under-\nstanding aging than those in late life. Although it\nprovides only weak support, our finding that social\nactivity effects are associated primarily with initial level\nof functioning is consistent with this hypothesis.\nLimitations\nThe results reported herein should be interpreted in\nthe context of three research limitations. First, our\nmeasure of Social Activity consists of only six items,\nand could not possibly therefore cover the full range\nof social and intellectual experience that exists in late\nlife. We also did not assess social support or positive\nsocial engagement, which may be key to understand-\ning social effects on late-life functioning. Better\nmeasures than ours could yield different results.\nNonetheless, it is perhaps worth noting that despite its\nlimitations our measure of social activity was signifi-\ncantly related to initial level of functioning in all the\ndomains investigated; it was just not associated with\nchange in either the growth curve or discordant twin\npair analyses. Second, our sample is based in\nDenmark, a small and relatively ethnically homoge-\nneous country. The nature of aging in a country like\nDenmark, where access to medical care is universal\nand poverty rates are low, may differ from that in\nother regions of the world. Third, the nature of social\nactivity may be different for twins than for nontwins\nbecause a twin has someone he or she has shared a\nlifetime with. While we acknowledge that twin\nresearch on social activity may not fully generalize to\nnontwins, we do note that there is no evidence that\ntwins age differently or have different mortality rates\nthan nontwins (Christensen et al., 1995). Finally, in\nour biometric growth curve analyses we defined the\nphenotypes by the wave of assessment (e.g., intake,\nfirst follow-up) rather than the age at assessment (e.g.,\nfunctioning at age 77, 79). The latter, age-basis\napproach, would have accounted for age differences\namong participants at any given assessment. Failure to\ntake age into account may have resulted in an overes-\ntimation of shared environmental effects (McGue &\nConclusion\nAnalysis of a large longitudinal sample of older\nDanish twins showed that while social activity was\nsignificantly associated with initial levels of physical\nfunctioning, cognitive functioning, and depression\nsymptomatology, it did not predict change in these\nvariables. Moreover, an analysis of MZ twins discor-\ndant for level of social activity found that the highly\nactive twin was not less susceptible to age-related\ndeclines in physical functioning and cognitive func-\ntioning and increases in depression symptomatology.\nConsequently, these analyses suggest that the associa-\ntion of social activity and late-life functioning largely\nreflect selection effects rather than true causation.\nNonetheless, the major contributor to change in late-\nlife functioning is nonshared environmental factors,\nthe specific nature of which remains to be determined.\n"
