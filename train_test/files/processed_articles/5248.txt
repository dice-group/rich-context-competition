    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: The use of early colonoscopy in the management of acute lower gastrointestinal\nbleeding (LGIB) is controversial, with disparate evidence. We aim to formally characterize the\nutility of early colonoscopy (within 24 h) in managing acute LGIB.\nDesign: A systematic literature search to August 2016 identified fully published and\nabstracts of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies assessing early\ncolonoscopy in acute LGIB. Single-arm studies were also included to define incidence.\nPrimary outcomes were overall rebleeding rates and time to rebleeding. Secondary\noutcomes included mortality, surgery, length of stay (LOS), definite cause of bleeding\nand adverse events (AEs). Odds ratios (OR) and weighted mean differences (WMD) were\ncalculated.\nResults: Of 897 citations, 10 single-arm, 9 observational studies, and 2 RCTS were included\n(25,781 patients). Rebleeding was no different between patients undergoing early colonoscopy\n-2.54 to -0.50 days). No other differences were noted between early and late colonoscopy. AEs\noccurred in 4.0%, (95% CI 2.9%; 5.4%) of early colonoscopies. Included studies were of low\nquality, with significant heterogeneity for some outcomes.\nConclusion: Early colonoscopy in acute LGIB does not decrease rebleeding, mortality or\nneed for surgery, but is associated with increased detection of definitive sources of bleeding,\nshorter LOS, with low complication incidence. However, the quality of evidence is low,\nhighlighting the need for additional high-level studies.\n",

Diagnostic approaches\ninclude endoscopy, radionuclide red blood\ncell scan, CT angiography and mesenteric\nangiography.1 Colonoscopy, with its high diag-\nnostic yield, is the initial procedure of choice for\nmost. However, it remains controversial whether\nearly colonoscopy \u00ad performed within 12\u00ad24 h\nof admission \u00ad provides any clinical benefits.\nFor example, a prospective, case historical con-\ntrol study of diverticular bleeding found early\ncolonoscopy decreased rebleeding and need\nfor surgery,2 whereas a randomized controlled\ntrial (RCT) of 100 patients found it only\nimproved diagnostic yield; a second RCT of 72\npatients demonstrated no differences in out-\ncomes between early and delayed colonoscopy.\nGuidelines by the American Society for\nGastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE),3 and the\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology (ACG)1\nrecommend early colonoscopy (within the ini-\ntial 24 h) in high-risk patients, with a low qual-\nity of evidence. Because existing studies are of\nsmall sample size and have come to varying con-\nclusions, we performed a systematic review and\nmeta-analysis to determine the impact of early\ncolonoscopy on clinical outcomes in acute\nMethods\nSearch strategy\nA comprehensive literature search was performed\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and\nISI Web of Knowledge databases with validated\nsearch terms specified for acute LGIB and endos-\ncopy (see Online Appendix 1). Abstracts pre-\nsented at major gastroenterology conferences in\nthe past 5 years were also hand-searched.\nAdditional relevant studies were identified from\ncross-referencing and hand-searches of references\nof the retrieved articles. All human adult studies\npublished in English were considered.\nStudy selection and patient population\nWe selected all randomized and observational\ncomparative studies that included early colonos-\ncopy in at least one group of patients presenting\nwith symptoms suggestive of acute LGIB. Single-\narm studies were identified to define clinical char-\nacteristics, incidence and overall outcomes;\ncomparative studies were used to identify relative\nharm or benefit attributable to early colonoscopy.\nEarly colonoscopy was defined as performed\nwithin 24 h of presentation for prospective obser-\nvational studies and RCTs.4 Because we antici-\npated definitions would vary among retrospective\ncohorts, we categorized such studies when at least\n75% of patients had undergone a colonoscopy\nwithin 24 h of presentation or if the mean (or\nmedian) time to colonoscopy was 24 h or less. We\nexcluded studies assessing pediatric patients, no\nacute LGIB, initial colonoscopy performed only\nafter 24 h, diagnostic testing only (such as radio-\nnuclide red blood cell scan or CT angiography)\nother than colonoscopy unless these represented\na control group. Care was taken to avoid double-\ncounting across studies.\nOutcome measures\nThe primary outcomes of the study were overall\nrebleeding rates and time to rebleeding, defined\nas time of rebleeding following presentation to\nhospital or admission. Secondary outcomes\nincluded mortality (related to LGIB and overall),\nsurgery, total duration of hospital LOS, identifi-\ncation of a definite cause of LGIB and adverse\nevents (AEs). Additional secondary outcomes\nincluded: length of ICU stay, blood transfusions\nI Roshan Afshar, MS Sadr et al\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3\nreceived, definite or probable cause of bleeding\n(including presence of endoscopic stigmata of\nrecent hemorrhage if the latter was not available)\nand the performance of endoscopic hemostasis.\nFinally, etiological endoscopic findings were\ndescribed for definite or probable causes of acute\nLGIB. The incidence was reported first for all\narms combined.\nValidity assessment and data abstraction\nTwo reviewers evaluated the eligibility of all identi-\nfied citations independently, with a third resolving\ndisagreements. Study quality was assessed using\nthe Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials,5\nand the Ottawa\u00adNewcastle criteria for observa-\ntional studies.6 The GRADE rating of evidence\ncharacterized the body of literature for each out-\ncome.7 Available demographic data were extracted,\nsuch as mean age, gender, hemodynamic instabil-\nity and use of antithrombotic therapies, as were\ninterventions for acute LGIB, and the correspond-\ning aforementioned patient outcomes.\nSources of possible clinical heterogeneity\nPossible clinical heterogeneity was evaluated by\nreviewing patient populations, nature of the inter-\nventions and definitions of outcomes across stud-\nies. Findings of heterogeneity were used to guide\nsubsequent subgroup analyses.\nSensitivity and subgroup analyses\nSensitivity analyses were planned according to\nthe varying control groups to which early colonos-\ncopy groups were compared, including elective or\ndelayed colonoscopy, no colonoscopy and other\ncomparators. Rebleeding definitions were\nexpected to vary between studies; therefore, addi-\ntional sensitivity analyses were performed based\non the availability of a clearly identified definition\nfor this outcome.\nBecause of the anticipated varied nature of\nreported approaches, definitions of outcomes and\nstudy designs are reported for all early colonos-\ncopy cohorts <24 h as well as <12 h to character-\nize overall incidence.\nAlthough RCTs were analyzed with controlled\nobservational studies for the main inferential\nanalyses, as the advantages of including obser-\nvational studies with randomized trials in a\nmeta-analysis could outweigh the disadvan-\ntages,8 RCTs were also analyzed separately.\nIn addition, we report on one very large study\nseparately.\nStatistical analysis and possible sources of\nstatistical heterogeneity\nDescriptive results were reported as proportions\nand 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and sum-\nmary statistics expressed as means and standard\ndeviations (SDs) for continuous variables and\nproportions for categorical variables. Effect size\nwas calculated with weighted mean differences\n(WMDs) for continuous variables; medians were\nused if means were not available, and SDs were\ncalculated or imputed when possible.10 Odds\nratios (ORs) were calculated for categorical vari-\nables. The Mantel\u00adHaenszel method for fixed\neffect models was applied to determine corre-\nsponding overall effect sizes and their CIs, except\nwhen statistical heterogeneity was noted, in which\ncase a random-effects model was used according\nto the DerSimonian and Laird method.11 WMDs\nwere handled as continuous variables using the\ninverse variance approach. The presence of het-\nerogeneity across studies was defined using a chi-\nsquare test of homogeneity with a 0.10 significance\nlevel.10 The Higgins I2 statistic12 was calculated to\nquantify the proportion of variation in treatment\neffects attributable to between-study heterogene-\nmoderate and high heterogeneity, respectively.\nFor all comparisons, publication bias was evalu-\nated using funnel plots as well as the Begg adjusted\nrank correlation13 and Egger regression asymme-\ntry tests14 if at least three citations were identified.\nIn order to ensure that zero-event trials did not\nsignificantly affect the heterogeneity or p values, a\ncontinuity correction was added to each trial with\nzero-events using the reciprocal of the opposite\ntreatment arm size.15 All statistical analyses were\ndone using Meta package in R version 2.13.0 (R\nFoundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,\nResults\nStudy selection and interventions\nStudy selection: we initially identified 897 cita-\ntions.

However,\nthe included studies were of low quality, with\nonly 2 small RCTs among the 21 included stud-\nies, and there existed significant heterogeneity\nfor some outcomes. Given the conflicting evi-\ndence in the literature, mostly from small or\nobservational studies, our results help to shed\nlight on the optimal management of patients\npresenting with acute LGIB. It was noted that\npatients receiving a colonoscopy within 12 h had\nhigher rates of mortality and surgery compared\nwith patients in all comparison groups. Patient\ninstability may explain the increase in the former\nas showed in upper GI bleeding; however, these\nobservations are based principally on observa-\nImportantly, recent society recommendations\nfavor early colonoscopy for patients with high-risk\nfeatures, rating quality of evidence as low and the\nstrength of recommendations as conditional,1\nindicating the need for additional research. These\nconclusions are supported by our findings that\nincluded additional data published since then.\nThe recommendation supporting early colonos-\ncopy is based on the belief that an early colonos-\ncopy approach identified more patients with a\ndefinitive cause of bleeding1 \u00ad a finding borne out\nin the current meta-analysis, bearing in mind the\ndifficulty in adjudicating such a subjective out-\ncome. This result was consistent whether group-\ning all studies, only prospective studies, and only\nthe two RCTs. The suggested inference is that\nthe detection of additional lesions allows more\nendoscopic therapy, which may result in decreased\nrebleeding. However, this benefit was not demon-\nstrated in our analysis.\nThe reason for improved detection of bleeding\nsources not resulting in an observed decrease in\nrebleeding rates is unclear, but may be related to\nmany factors, including clinical heterogeneity in\nstudy design, inclusion of older studies with lim-\nited options for hemostasis or adopted manage-\nment schemes, variability in endoscopic expertise\nimpacting both diagnosis and therapy, as well as\nmethodological considerations such as small\nsample sizes in high-quality studies. The short-\nened hospital stay noted may result from earlier\ndecision-making following a prompt endoscopic\ndiagnosis (finding a bleeding lesion or excluding\none). The data comparing 12\u00ad24 h are harder to\ninterpret because of widely varying study\nmethodologies.\nNot surprisingly, considering their low inci-\ndences and the paucity of patients included in\ncomparative trials, no significant differences\nwere noted in mortality or need for surgery\n(1.1%, and overall 6.8%, respectively), nor in\ndisease-related mortality (due to LGIB), with\nexisting limitations in such adjudication. Studies\nwere underpowered to show any difference in\nthese outcomes. Additionally, we found signifi-\ncant shortening in LOS attributable to early\nto -0.50 days), albeit only among the subgroup\nanalysis comparing early to later colonoscopy \u00ad\na benefit further justifying recent society\nrecommendations.1\nLarge cohort studies are probably more useful\nthan smaller comparative trials for characterizing\nboth feasibility and safety of an early colonos-\ncopy. We noted a low incidence of AEs among\npatients undergoing an intervention for acute\nLGIB. Early colonoscopy, in particular, was not\nassociated with increased AEs. However, the\nsource data were disparate in their categorization\nof AEs and difficult to amalgamate.\nOur systematic review includes an overall quan-\ntification of outcome rates considering observa-\ntional and interventional trials with and without\ncomparators, as well as a more traditional meta-\nanalysis of comparative trials comparing early\ncolonoscopy to controls, including targeted sub-\ngroup analyses. As a comparison, a recently\npublished meta-analysis addressing the role of\nearly colonoscopy noted increased endoscopic\ninterventions in the absence of increased diag-\nnostic yield and decreased duration of LOS and\ncosts attributable to early colonoscopy;37 the\nrest of the findings were qualitatively similar to\nour own. The difference in colonoscopic thera-\npies is hard to interpret in the face of control\ngroups that did not include colonoscopy, and in\nfact disappeared when limiting the analysis to\nthe control group also receiving a colonoscopy,\nbut after 24 h. Although adopting an overall\nsound methodological approach, this systematic\nreview performed subgroup analyses combining\nthe two RCTs with the controlled study by\nJensen and colleagues that was mistakenly con-\nsidered a prospective comparative cohort study\nI Roshan Afshar, MS Sadr et al\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 13\n(whereas it in fact included a historical control\ngroup), and the matched propensity analysis by\nNagata and colleagues, a statistical approach\nthat fails to obviate residual confounding in\ncontrast to randomized patient allocation. Both\nof these studies are thus at greater methodologi-\ncal risk of bias than RCTs, and their inclusion\ncan be questioned.\nAnother meta-analysis yielded similar results, but\nidentified only six studies.38 Furthermore, the\nauthors chose to exclude patients in whom cecal\nintubation could not be achieved \u00ad a decision that\nlimits the interpretation and generalizability of\nany endoscopic approach when managing patients\nwith acute LGIB. Indeed, adequacy of the prepa-\nration and feasibility of a complete colonoscopy\nare inherently critical components when assessing\nimpact on patient outcomes.\nThe main shortcoming of the current systematic\nreview relates somewhat to statistical and more\nimportantly to the clinical heterogeneity of exist-\ning literature with disparate studies exhibiting\nand methodological limitations. Other than two\nsmall RCTs, all other included studies were het-\nerogeneous observational studies with possibility\nof bias and confounding, lack of adequate/con-\nsistent control groups and varying timings of\ncolonoscopy, endoscopic treatments, patient\ninclusion criteria and definitions of outcomes.\nMoreover, there was a paucity of adequately con-\ntrolled studies. Additionally, there exist possible\nissues of generalizability as most of the cohort\nstudies, and both RCTs (published at least seven\nyears ago) enrolled patients who were predomi-\nnantly male and over 50, with a high proportion\nwith hemodynamic instability \u00ad ranging from\n29% to 76%. The increased representation of\nsuch sicker patients may not be representative in\nacute LGIB and may imply some selection, with\nthe need in such patients to exclude an upper GI\nsource of bleeding that can be found in up to\nonset of hematochezia originating from either the\ncolon or the rectum, but in our meta-analysis only\none study excluded small bowel bleeding,39 with\nonly one other specifying that small bowel was\ndiagnosed by capsule endoscopy or double-bal-\nloon endoscopy.29 In the RCT by Laine and col-\nleagues, selected patients went on to small bowel\ncontrast radiography after colonoscopy.27 As for\nthe choice of optimal endoscopic therapy, the\nheterogeneity in approaches for given lesions or\nlocations and the lack of patient-level information\nprevents any meaningful conclusions. The defini-\ntion and timing of rebleeding varied widely, fur-\nther limiting the validity of available summary\ndata, even across both RCTs.26,27 Finally, the\napproach to patients in the control groups also\nvaried widely, with included studies spanning 16\nyears, and a noticeable paucity of data assessing\nthe role of CT angiography and modern emboli-\nzation techniques.1\nSuch realizations do not detract from the impor-\ntance of this analysis and its dissemination in light\nof published recommendations so that clinicians\ncan understand the level of evidence and rationale\nfor contemporary guidelines. Just as importantly,\nhowever, we feel the aforementioned limitations in\nlevel of evidence should deter endoscopists from\nproceeding with a colonoscopy within the first 24 h\nfollowing admission if there remain issues of ade-\nquate stabilization, patient safety or feasibility con-\ncerns related to patient status and comorbidity,\navailability of resources and endoscopic expertise.\nConclusion\nEarly colonoscopy is feasible and safe in acute\nLGIB. Although it does not result in decreased\nrebleeding, mortality or need for surgery, an increase\nin the identification of bleeding sources and a\ndecrease in length of hospitalization were noted\nwith the performance of early colonoscopy. The\nquality of the evidence is limited by clinical and sta-\ntistical heterogeneity, and is further hampered by a\npaucity of controlled studies. Additional high-qual-\nity data are needed to better determine whether\ncolonoscopy performed within 24 h of admission\ncan improve clinical outcomes such as rebleeding.\nAuthors' contribution\nStudy concept and design: I.
