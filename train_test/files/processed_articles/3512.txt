Using cluster analysis, we identified three different kinds of help seekers among the participants. One of the\nclusters represented teacher candidates for whom help seeking was an important and adaptive self-regulatory strategy and\nessential to their successful academic performance. The other two clusters represented the group of teacher candidates\nwho had help-avoidance tendencies, but they were different in that for one group, seeking help implied inadequate use and\nmaladaptive self-regulatory strategies while for the other, coping and adaptive self-regulatory strategies were utilized to ask\nfor help when needed. The results revealed that students' tendencies for help seeking vary according to their teacher's self-\nefficacy beliefs, and use of self-regulatory strategies, such as delay of gratification. These findings suggested that help seeking\nis indeed a self-regulatory learning strategy used by learners to pursue valuable academic goals, and that differences do exist\nin approaches to help avoidance.\n",

Help seeking is an impor-\ntant self-regulatory learning strategy associated with moti-\nvation and academic achievement. Help seeking refers to\nstrategic self-regulatory behaviors that learners use to\nobtain information from formal and informal sources to\nadapt and acquire knowledge and skills (Hsu, 2005;\nand Usher (2013), self-regulated learning refers to \"the\nprocess whereby learners systematically organize and\ndirect their thoughts, feelings, and actions to attain their\ngoals\" (pp. 1-2). Seeking appropriate help when it is needed\nhas been considered to be a strong indicator of individual\ndifferences within human agency while pursuing goals. In\neducation, help seeking has been associated with motiva-\ntion, self-regulation, goal orientation, and self-efficacy\nwhile disregarding threat to self-esteem, tend to be highly\nsuccessful and adapt better to their environment than learn-\ners who avoid seeking help (Karabenick & Knapp, 1991).\nHelp seeking practices, motivational beliefs, and the use\nof learning strategies are important predictors of teacher can-\ndidate retention. There is growing support for requiring\nteacher candidates to take and pass state-level examinations\nto advance in their teacher candidacy. As a result, high stakes\ntesting has secured its place as a critical gate to teacher edu-\ncation and certification (Cochran-Smith & Zeichner, 2005).\nAs early as the sophomore year, an aspiring teacher can be\ndenied access to a teacher education program due to failure\nof a state exam, a restriction which limits access to the field\nfor many potential candidates (Hsu, 2005). In some states,\nteacher education programs base admission on whether\nteacher candidates can pass an examination, which measures\nthe basic skills acquired during high school. In New York\nState, the LiberalArts and Science Test (LAST) is the current\nassessment, while in 45 other states, the Praxis I is required\n(Mitchell, Robinson, Plake, & Knowles, 2001).\nWhile academic deficits are often addressed through\nremedial programs and workshops, teacher education pro-\ngrams would benefit from early awareness of self-regulatory\nbehaviors evidenced by incoming students.

It would be important to learn teacher candidates' ten-\ndencies to seek help whether it is to master test materials, to\nobtain instrumental benefits, or simply if they approach or\navoid seeking help when in need of assistance. If teacher\ncandidates have tendencies to avoid help seeking when suc-\ncessful performance is in jeopardy, it would be important to\nknow what they actually do to succeed in passing a signifi-\ncant state teaching examination. Specifically, it is essential to\nuncover whether, in spite of exhibiting help seeking avoid-\nance tendencies, teacher candidates eventually seek help to\nmaster the materials or to receive assistance only to obtain a\npassing score pass without mastering the content.\nConsequently, the aim of the study was to examine teacher\ncandidates' help seeking tendencies while preparing to take\nthe LAST. The social cognitive theory of self-regulation of\nlearning serves as the theoretical framework to delineate\nunderstanding the role of help seeking as an individual dif-\nference in academic achievement among teacher candidates.\nTheoretical Background\nHumans are distinctly able to engage in self-regulation of\ntheir actions, motivations, behaviors, and beliefs, and to iden-\ntify and use self-directed learning strategies while pursuing\nshort- and long-term goals (Bandura, 1997). Throughout his-\ntory and across cultures, self-regulation of behavior has been\nassumed to increase learning and performance (Zimmerman\n& Schunk, 2011). Recent research has provided strong sup-\nport for the importance of self-regulation as a catalyst for\nhuman agency and self-direction (Bembenutty, Cleary, &\nKitsantas, 2013). The development of self-regulation begins\nin the home with guidance and modeling from primary care-\ntakers, and from family and community members (Bandura,\n1997). The development of self-regulation continues with a\nparamount importance when children enter school. It is at this\ndevelopmental level that teachers have an important role to\nserve as mentors and models of self-regulation to scaffold\nlearners during challenging times when seeking help is\nSelf-regulation involves key meta-cognitive, motiva-\ntional, and behavioral subprocesses, such as time manage-\nment, organizing, rehearsing, and coding information,\nattending to and concentrating on instruction, establishing a\nproductive work environment, and using social sources\neffectively (Zimmerman, 1998). Students' academic effec-\ntiveness depends on their use of these self-regulatory pro-\ncesses and their motivational beliefs regarding the\neffectiveness of those processes. In school settings, help\nseeking is an important self-regulatory strategy (Karabenick,\nall self-regulatory approaches is a recursive feedback loop.\nThis feedback loop provides the learner with information\nabout his or her task performance that can be used to make\nadjustments (Zimmerman, 2008). This cyclical process\nenables self-regulated students to metacognitive monitor the\neffectiveness of their learning strategies and make adaptive\nchanges that lead to academic success.\nTo better understand the interrelation of these self-\nregulatory processes, Zimmerman (2000) proposed a model\ninvolving three cyclical phases, which includes help seeking\nin the performance phase. Help seeking was not viewed as a\nlack of self-regulation, but rather as a social strategy for\ngaining needed assistance from an appropriate source\n(Newman, 2008). According to Zimmerman, self-regulated\nlearning strategies are not limited to asocial forms of educa-\ntion but can include social forms of learning, such as seeking\nguidance from peers, coaches, and teachers.\nTheory and research have positioned help seeking as an\nimportant social self-regulatory strategy related to self-\nregulatory processes among teacher candidates (Bembenutty,\nmost important strategies that can contribute to university\nstudent success (Karabenick & Dembo, 2011). Unfortunately,\nstudents who are in most need of assistance are often the\nleast likely to seek it for a variety of reasons. This is espe-\ncially true of college students aspiring to be teachers, who\noften wait until it is too late to use available resources to pass\nstate certification exams (Tellez, 1992). When confronted\nwith the reality of high stakes testing, these students often\ngive up their dream to become teachers rather than admit\ntheir need for social support (Orlich & Gifford, 2006). This\ndecision has a significant impact on the number of teachers\nwho enter the classroom.\nAccording the Newman (2008), the self decides when it is\ntime for input from an outside source. This decision to act\nshows a willingness to depend on others. Socially, self-regu-\nlated students find selective help seeking to be a useful strat-\negy when they encounter obstacles in their learning process.\nStudents who are low in overall self-regulation are reluctant\nto ask for assistance. By contrast, students who are high in\nself-regulation take the initiative to do schoolwork without\nprompting and continue their efforts until a task is com-\npleted. When necessary, they will selectively and actively\nseek enough input to complete the task successfully. They\nshow initiative and persistence on learning tasks, confidence,\nand resourcefulness in overcoming problems, and are self-\nreactive to task performance outcomes (Zimmerman, 2008).\nAccording to Karabenick (2013), the history of help seek-\ning as a self-regulated strategy has four major developments.\nIn Phase 1, the contribution of Nelson-Le Gall and Nadler\nreflect the conception that help seeking was important to pro-\nvide assistance for learners to progress on their own while\npursuing academic tasks. Within Phase 2, Zimmerman\n(2008) provided empirical evidence that help seeking was a\nstrategy used by self-regulated learners. Through Phase 3,\nWhite and Bembenutty 3\nstudies assessing the person and contextual motivational\ninfluences under the achievement goal theory revealed that\nhelp seeking was associated with learner's classroom experi-\nNewman, 2008). During Phase 4, it was revealed that com-\nputer-mediated communications and intelligent learning sys-\ntems serve as important tools used by student to seek help.\nHelp seeking can be conceptualized as a process of sev-\neral stages during which learners set goals, make decisions,\nand adapt their approaches according to the cognitive, affec-\ntive-emotional, contextual, and social competencies and\nresources available to them (Karabenick & Berger, 2013;\nKarabenick & Dembo, 2011). According to Karabenick's\nmodel of help seeking (Karabenick & Berger, 2013;\nKarabenick & Dembo, 2011), students first determine\nwhether there is a problem (Stage 1) and whether help is\nneeded (Stage 2) before deciding whether to seek help (Stage\n3). If they make the decision to seek help, then they need to\ndetermine the type of help they will seek (Stage 4) and from\nwhom they will seek help (Stage 5). Once the potential\nsources of help are identified, which could be from a teacher,\na peer, or from a technology learning context, they solicit\nhelp (Stage 6) and obtain help (Stage 7) before processing\nthe help received (Stage 8). This progression does not neces-\nsarily occur in this particular order. At each of these stages,\nlearners engage in one or more self-regulatory processes. To\nillustrate, in Stage 1, learners set goals and objectives to\nmonitor performance. In Stage 2, they engage in task analy-\nsis while in Stage 4, learners need to decide on the type of\nhelp they will seek. In Stage 8, they engage in error\nanalysis.\nAt different developmental phases, specific types of\nhelp have been identified. Nelson-Le Gall (1985) is widely\ncredited with changing educators'perspective on help seek-\ning from an act which reflected immaturity, passivity, and\nincompetence to one of maturity, proactivity, and compe-\ntence. Building on foundational research by Fisher, Nadler,\nand DePaulo (1983), Nelson-Le Gall focused on the stu-\ndents' goals for seeking assistance, rather than the act itself.\nShe (Nelson-Le Gall, 1985) defined help seeking as a gen-\neral problem-solving strategy that allows learners to cope\nwith academic difficulties by gaining the assistance of oth-\ners. She drew a distinction between two forms of help seek-\ning, instrumental (adaptive) and executive (nonadaptive),\nbased on a learner's goals. Therefore, intentions often\ndetermine how and why learners ask for help. Adaptive\nhelp seeking occurs when the help requested is limited to\nthe amount and type of assistance needed for the student to\nsolve the problem independently. In contrast, executive\nhelp seeking occurs when the requested help intends for\nsomeone else to solve the problem. Avoidance of help seek-\ning focuses on situations when a student requires but\nchooses to not seek help. Perceived benefits of help seeking\nare students' beliefs about the positive outcomes of seeking\nhelp on a task.\nResearch conducted by Hwang and Vrongistinos (2002)\nindicated a strong relationship between frequent uses of self-\nregulated learning strategies and high academic performance\namong teacher candidates. This study found that future\nteachers varied in their use of strategies and that strategy use\ndistinguished high and low performing students.\nUnfortunately, not all teacher candidates have the opportu-\nnity to develop self-regulation, and as a result do not engage\nin productive work habits.\nResearch has shown help-avoidant college students are\nmore anxious and perform more poorly than adaptive help\nseekers. Students who feel threatened by adverse conse-\nquences of help seeking report across educational settings\nare classified as executive help seekers (Karabenick, 2003).\nKarabenick (2003) compared college students' help seeking\nbehavior with that of younger students. He measured strate-\ngic and nonstrategic help seeking behaviors in large college\nclasses where support services are not easily accessed. The\nresults of his study showed similarities in help seeking\nbehaviors of learners from K-12 when compared with col-\nlege students (Karabenick, 2003). Karabenick also assessed\ncollege students' levels of help seeking threat, their inten-\ntions to seek help, help seeking goals, preferred resources,\nclass-related motivation, and their use of learning strategies.\nUsing a cluster analysis, he found four clusters that could be\ndescribed as strategic-adaptive help seekers, formal help\nseekers, help seeking avoidant students, and expedient help\nseekers.\nRelationships also exist between help seeking and self-\nefficacy beliefs, self-regulation, intrinsic motivation, and\ndelay of gratification among teacher candidates (Bembenutty,\n2006). Self-efficacy for learning is individuals' beliefs about\ntheir capability of performing a particular task (Bandura,\n1997). Teachers'self-efficacy refers to teachers'beliefs about\nthe capability to have a positive effect on the learning of their\nstudents. Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk Hoy (2001)\nobserved, \"teachers' sense of efficacy is an idea that neither\nresearchers nor practitioners can afford to ignore\" (p. 803). A\nsense of efficacy can help teacher candidates' to sustain\nmotivation, engage in self-regulation, and sustain a mastery\ngoal orientation rather than an avoidance goal orientation.\nThus, it is expected that teacher candidates' self-efficacy\nbeliefs would be associated with their motivational beliefs\nand self-regulation of learning. Another important compo-\nnent of self-regulation is intrinsic motivation, which refers to\na learner's engagement and enjoyment in a task for the sake\nof learning (Sansone & Harackiewicz, 2000). Teacher candi-\ndates' are expected to display intrinsic interest in academic\ntasks associated with their teaching programs as they have\nwillingly chosen that path as their future career. Thus, it is\nexpected that intrinsic interest will be associated with teacher\ncandidates' goal orientations.\nAcademic delay of gratification is associated with the\nself-regulatory strategy of help seeking (Bembenutty &\n4 SAGE Open\ndefined academic delay of gratification as learners' inten-\ntions to postpone immediate available rewards to obtain\nlarger rewards temporally distant. Delay of gratification is\nimportant for self-regulation of learning because, for exam-\nple, alternatives to academic goals are attractive, in part,\nbecause they offer immediate gratification, in contrast to\nrewards for academic goals (e.g., grades, degrees) that are\ntemporally remote. Delay of gratification is associated with\nstudents' use of learning strategies such as help seeking\nBembenutty (2006) examined the associations between pre-\nservice teachers' help seeking tendencies, homework beliefs\nand behavior, and their willingness to engage in academic\ndelay of gratification. The results indicated that preservice\nteachers who have a positive attitude toward help seeking are\nthose who report high homework self-efficacy beliefs and\nhigh homework intrinsic interest. Teacher candidates with a\npositive attitude toward help seeking are those who reported\nhigh willingness to delay gratification.\nOver the last several years, research in help seeking\namong teacher candidates suggests that help seeking is an\nimportant self-regulatory strategy among teachers and\namong teacher candidates while studying to take important\nbehaviors of preservice teachers who were at risk of failure\nof state certification examinations. The participants were\npreservice teachers drawn from a small private college in\nNew York. The Preservice Teacher Help seeking Scale\n(PTHSS; White, 2011) was administered to preservice teach-\ners who were preparing for the first of three state certifica-\ntion exams.\nIn spite of the benefits of help seeking for learners, often,\nhelp seeking has been described as an uncomfortable and\nembarrassing act that requires a degree of courage (Flynn &\nthe instrumentality of help seeking, the costs cannot be mini-\nmized (DePaulo & Fisher, 1980; Karabenick & Knapp,\n1991). There exists a significant amount of research concern-\ning why students are reluctant to seek help, even when they\nrecognize it is needed and readily available (Newman, 2008).\nRyan and Pintrich (1997) investigated the role of motivation\nand attitudes in adolescents'help seeking in math class. They\nconcluded that students who were unsure of themselves--\ncognitively or socially--were more likely to feel threatened\nwhen asking their peers for help. Ryan, Gheen, and Midgley\n(1998) assessed the context of the classroom to investigate\nindividual and classroom influences on adolescents and\nreported the avoidance of help seeking. They found students\nwere able to improve help seeking behaviors when their\nteachers provided socioemotional nurturing. Thus, there is\nevidence of widespread help avoidance and help abuse\n(overuse of nonadaptive help) from students who need assis-\ntance the most (Aleven & Koedinger, 2000).\nPresent Study\nThis study assessed the different help seeking tendencies of\nteacher candidates enrolled. Of particular interest is teacher\ncandidates' use of avoidance, adaptive, and executive help\nseeking strategies to master the content of a state certifica-\ntion exam. Instructors' ratings of students' help seeking ten-\ndencies were also examined in the study. The following\nresearch questions guided the study:\nResearch Question 1: What are the associations between\nLAST scores, teacher self-efficacy beliefs, self-\nefficacy beliefs, delay of gratification, self-regulation,\nintrinsic motivation, and help seeking tendencies?\nResearch Question 2: What clusters, based on the under-\nlying structure of their help seeking preferences, could\ndifferentiate teacher candidates' help seeking tenden-\ncies and how are these clusters differentiated based on\nthe candidates' self-regulatory practices, motivational\nbeliefs, and academic performance?\nResearch Question 3: Will differences on pre-LAST\nscores, candidates' self-regulatory practices, motiva-\ntional beliefs, and academic performance, separately\naccount for unique variance on post-LAST scores?\nMethod\nParticipants and Procedure\nParticipants in the study were 86 teacher candidates drawn\nfrom a small private college in an urban setting (31 males\nand 55 females), which enroll predominantly minority stu-\ndents who were junior and senior intending to teach in ele-\nmentary schools. The college maintains a liberal admissions\npolicy, giving students from diverse populations an opportu-\nnity to enter higher education. Teacher candidates were\ninvited to participate in the study by an instructor. After sub-\nmitting signed informed consent forms, teacher candidates\nwere given a series of assessments to complete in the class-\nroom during LAST exam preparation.\nMeasures\nTeacher Candidates' Reported Help Seeking.This scale has\nfour subscales. Adaptive Help Seeking: Teacher candidates\nreported their adaptive help seeking from their instructors\n(an example item is, \"When I ask for help with assignments\npertaining to this class project, I prefer to be given hints or\nand from their peers (an example item is, \"When I ask a peer\nfor help with my work, I don't want my peer to give away the\nExecutive Help Seeking: Teacher candidates reported execu-\ntive help seeking tendencies from their instructors (an exam-\nple item is, \"When I ask the instructor for help with\nWhite and Bembenutty 5\nassignments pertaining to this class project, I prefer the\ninstructor do the work for me rather than explain to me how\n(an example item is, \"When I ask a peer for help with my\nwork, I don't want my peer to give away the whole answer,\"\nSeeking: Teacher candidates reported executive help seeking\ntendencies from their instructors (an example item is, \"If I\nneed help to solve a problem, I prefer to skip it rather than to\nPerceived Benefits of Help Seeking: Teacher candidates\nreported executive help seeking tendencies from their\ninstructors (an example item is, \"I like to ask for help about\nmy test preparation because it helps me understand the mate-\nInstructor's Rating of Teacher Candidates' Help seeking Strate-\ngies.

Items on this test were adapted from a\nstate standardized test for teacher candidates' licensure. The\nscores on a practice LAST were obtained at the first (M =\nsions of a series of workshops dedicated to prepare the can-\ndidates for the test.\nSelf-Efficacy for Learning.The Self-Efficacy for Learning\nScale (Bembenutty, 2010) was used to assess self-efficacy\nfor learning (an example item is, \"I am sure that I can learn\nSelf-Efficacy for Teaching.The Teachers' Sense of Efficacy\nScale (Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk Hoy, 2001) was used\nto assess teacher candidates' self-efficacy beliefs (an\nexample item is, \"How much can you do to get through to the\nIntrinsic Motivation for Learning.The Intrinsic Motivation\nScale (Bembenutty, 2010) was used to assess intrinsic moti-\nvation (an example item is, \"I enjoy studying for the LAST,\"\nSelf-Regulation for Learning.

Teacher candidates chose between an immediate\navailable reward and a reward that is temporarily distant\n(e.g., \"Going to a party now\" or \"Staying home to study for\na test tomorrow so I can get good grade\"; M = 3.25; SD = .54;\nHomework Distraction.Teacher candidates reported their\nlevel of distraction in preparation for the LAST test with two\nitems (an example item is, \"How many hours per week are\nyou spending watching television every day?\" M = 1.91; SD\nResults\nObjective 1: Intercorrelations Between the\nVariables\nTable 1 displays the correlations between the variables. As\nexpected, Pre-LAST and Post-LAST were highly correlated\n(r = .73). Teacher candidates' reported adaptive help seeking\nfrom instructors and peers were highly correlated (r = .81);\nthus, we merged both variables resulting in a single variable\nof adaptive help seeking. Executive help seeking from\ninstructors and peers were also highly correlated (r = .82);\nthus, we merged both variables to create a single index of\nexecutive help seeking. The instructors'rating of teacher can-\ndidates' adaptive help seeking and benefits were also highly\ncorrelated (r = .85). Thus, instructors' rating of benefits of\nhelp seeking was not used in further analysis. Similarly, the\ninstructors'rating of teacher candidates'avoidance and exec-\nutive help seeking were also highly correlated (r = .79).\nThus, instructors' rating of avoidance was not used in further\nanalysis.\nPre- and Post-LAST scores were significantly related (r\n= .73). Pre- and Post-LAST scores were inversely related\nto executive and avoidance help seeking, respectively.\nTeacher self-efficacy was positively related to teacher\nTable 1.

Academic delay of gratification was\npositively related to self-efficacy for learning (r = 28),\nteacher candidates adaptive (r = .23) and benefit from help\nseeking (r = .33), but inversely related to avoidance help\nseeking (r = -.28). Self-efficacy was positively related to\nintrinsic motivation (r = .45), self-regulation (r = .44), and\nbenefit for seeking help (r = .29).\nObjective 2: Cluster and Discriminant Analysis\nTo classify teacher candidates' based on their help seeking\ntendencies and follow the cluster analysis on help seeking by\nKarabenick (2003), four clusters were expected using the\nteacher candidates' four self-reported indexes of help seek-\ning. A K-means cluster analysis generated a noninterpretable\nfour-cluster solution; however, a three-cluster solution was\nhighly interpretable. This analysis produced an estimate of\nwithin-subjects similarity and dissimilarity according to the\nteacher candidates' reported help seeking strategies.\nCluster 1 (labeled avoidance-executive help seekers) con-\nsisted of teacher candidates with a moderate avoidance and\nexecutive help seeking tendencies. Cluster 2 (labeled adap-\ntive help seekers) consisted of teacher candidates with a high\nadaptive and benefits of help seeking tendencies but have\nlow executive and avoidance help seeking tendencies.\nCluster 3 (labeled avoidance-adaptive help seekers) con-\nsisted of teacher candidates moderate in avoidance and ben-\nefits, low in executive, but high in adaptive help seeking\n(which is confirmed with a MANOVA, see Table 2). Using\nWilks' statistic, there was a significant effect of cluster on\nteacher candidates' reported use of help seeking strategies, \np\nThe MANOVA was followed by a series of ANOVAs, one\nper dependent variable (see Table 3) and by the Benferroni's\nsignificant differences to test group comparisons. The\nMANOVA compared the differences among the clusters in\nteacher candidates' LAST performances, motivational\nbeliefs, self-regulation strategies, and teachers' rating of\ntheir help seeking strategies. An examination of mean differ-\nences among the clusters indicated that there were mean dif-\nferences among the three clusters on teacher self-efficacy.\nCluster 2 reported higher teacher self-efficacy beliefs than\nCluster 1, which suggests that teacher candidates who seek\nhelp for the sake of learning are also those who have higher\nteacher self-efficacy beliefs (see Figure 1).\nTeacher candidates (Cluster 3) who moderately avoid\nseeking help but engage in high adaptive help seeking\nreported higher willingness to delay gratification than the\nteacher candidates (Cluster 1) with moderate avoidance but\nwho do seek help primarily to just get answers. Teacher can-\ndidates with high preference for using adaptive help seeking\nstrategies (Clusters 2 and 3) reported higher self-efficacy for\nlearning and consider help seeking more beneficial than\navoidance-executive teacher candidates who seek help only\nto get answers (Cluster 1). Using Wilks' statistic, there was a\nsignificant effect of cluster on teacher candidates' reported\n\np\nTo confirm the cluster solutions, the MANOVA was fol-\nlowed up with discriminant analysis, which revealed two dis-\ncriminant functions. Overall, 96.5% of the teacher candidates\nwere correctly classified and the correlations between help\nseeking and the discriminant functions are consistent with\nthe MANOVA's findings (see Table 4). The discriminant\nfunctions plot is displayed in Figure 2.\nObjective 3: Regression Analysis Predicting Post-\nLAST Scores\nWe examined whether differences on variables assessed in\nthe study separately accounted for unique variance on post-\nLAST scores, even after controlling for the effects of each\nother using hierarchical regression (entered in four steps).\nGender was included in the analysis to control for its effects.\nTables 5 and 6 display the results of the final model with\nfour steps.

The final model accounted for 71% of the variance on\nthe outcome. The instructor's rating of the teacher candi-\ndates' use of help seeking strategies and all variations of\ninteraction terms were eliminated from the final model\nbecause they did not account for unique variance on post-\nLAST scores.\nDiscussion\nA major concern for those who instruct future teachers is\nwhether teacher candidates will develop the necessary self-\nregulatory skills during their training at a level which results\nin meeting individual states' requirements for certification.\nOne of those important self-regulatory skills is an ability to\nseek help when it is needed. The results of this study are\nconsistent with Karabenick's (2003) self-regulatory view of\nhelp seeking and the perspective that links strategic factors in\nself-regulated learning with help seeking. Help seeking is an\nadaptive strategy for coping with difficulty; however, teacher\ncandidates often refrain from asking for help to avoid the\nperception of weakness or incompetence.\nWhite and Bembenutty 9\nTable 4.

Mean differences of three-cluster solutions.\nIn this study, we identify three different kinds of help\nseekers among the participants. Each of the three groups is\nunique in the way it approaches help avoidance. Cluster 1\nrepresents the group of teacher candidates who have help-\navoidance tendencies and to whom seeking help implies\ninadequacy. Consistent with Karabenick's (2003) findings,\nthese teacher candidates would rather fail than be judged as\nless capable by instructors and peers; they engage in execu-\ntive rather than in adaptive help seeking. Cluster 2 represents\nteacher candidates for whom help seeking is an important\nand adaptive self-regulatory strategy and essential to their\nsuccessful academic performance. Cluster 3 represents the\ngroup of teacher candidates who have help seeking avoid-\nance tendencies, experience similar stress and anxiety\nregarding asking for help as their counterparts in Cluster 1,\nyet are able to use coping and adaptive strategies to ask for\nhelp when needed.\nRetention in teacher education programs is often threat-\nened by failure of the initial assessment of basic skills\noften attributed to poor high school preparation. To increase\nretention in teacher education programs, identifying\nTable 5.

The sample size is\nsmall and causation cannot be derived from this correlational\nstudy. Experimental research should be conducted in which\nthe different help seeking tendencies are controlled under\nrestricted settings to rule out potential factors unexamined in\nthis study such as the level of anxiety of the teacher candi-\ndates, classroom characteristics, and the dispositions of the\nteacher candidates and their instructors.\nImportant educational implications are derived from the\nresults of this study. Teacher education providers are chal-\nlenged to make significant adjustments to the way they pre-\npare teacher candidates for certification. New policies dictate\nthe way teachers are educated, evaluated, and trained before\nand after taking charge of a classroom. In addition, there are\nhigher expectations of the individual teacher candidate's\nWhite and Bembenutty 11\nimpact on student learning during the years of preparation\nand clinical training. The demands made on teacher candi-\ndates have escalated (Darling-Hammond & McLaughlin,\n2011); therefore, teacher preparation programs must find a\nway to assist those who might become overwhelmed with the\nprocess. Including training in self-regulatory strategies such\nas goal setting, help seeking, self-monitoring, and delaying\ngratification can provide teacher candidates with tools that\ncan improve performance and raise self-efficacy.\nTeacher candidates, who display patterns of help avoid-\nance that have been observed in children and traditional col-\nlege students, are at risk of dropping out of teacher education\nprograms. One can also suggest that candidates who do com-\nplete the program and display help-avoidance tendencies\nwill contribute to the costly high attrition rate of new teach-\ners. Although the number of teacher candidates in the cluster\nof avoidance-executive help seeking is limited, it is not with-\nout concern because some of these teacher candidates are\nmembers of the pool from which future teachers are drawn.\nThe \"help seeking dilemma\" is instilled in early socialization\npractices which reflect norms which are cultural and primar-\nilyWestern (Karabenick & Berger, 2013;Volet & Karabenick,\n2006). Educators who train teacher candidates to become\nsuccessful classroom teachers should work toward dispelling\nthe stigmas associated with help seeking at the earliest\nopportunity. Often, when a learner weighs the costs and ben-\nefits of seeking help, the consequences of revealing weak-\nness puts at risk the appearance of competence and can result\nin the choice to avoid any appearance of incompetence. In\nsome cases, delaying gratification can be linked to help\navoidance; the learner's desire to appear competent can be\nassociated with maintaining social status. In addition, the\nresults of the study should encourage teacher educators to\nmodel and promote the effective uses of the self-regulatory\nstrategy of seeking and obtaining assistance, specifically for\nstudents who could be isolated and persisting toward aca-\ndemic failure.\nCloser attention should be paid to the teacher candidates\nwho avoid asking for help as a means toward masking failure.\nWhen we examine motivational factors which result in avoid-\ning seeking help, consideration should be given to the signifi-\ncance of the social cost to the teacher candidates who admits\nto struggling with different aspects of their training. In this\nway, teacher preparation programs can identify those candi-\ndates who will struggle alone rather than join a study group,\nmeet with instructors, or take advantage of the resources read-\nily available to contribute to their success in the program.\nIn summary, this study supported the notion that learners'\nindividual differences for help seeking vary according to\ntheir goal orientations, self-efficacy beliefs, and use of self-\nregulatory strategies, such as their willingness to postpone\nimmediately available rewards to pursue long-term aca-\ndemic outcomes. These findings suggest that help seeking is\nindeed a self-regulatory learning strategy used by learners to\npursue important and valuable academic and social goals.\nFurthermore, consistent with the work of Mischel (1996),\nthese findings placed delay of gratification as an important\nindividual difference associated with academic achieve-\nment. Consistent with Bandura (1997), self-efficacy is\nrevealed in this study as having a direct association with\nacademic performance and as an important human agency\nfor seeking help. These findings call attention to the fact that\nwhen seeking help, learners have different goals. With\nregard to help seeking avoidance, all goals are not created\nequal. Some learners with help seeking avoidance tenden-\ncies choose to cope with a perceived threat to their self-\nesteem and anxiety by seeking help primarily to get answers\nwithout an understanding, whereas other teacher candidates\nchoose to seek help to get knowledge and skills.\nAppendix A\nSample Items Assessing Help Seeking (White,\nStudents' Reported Adaptive Help Seeking\nResponse format consisted of an 8-point Likert-type scale\n(1 = Not like me at all and 8 = Very much like me).\nStudents' Reported Adaptive Help Seeking from the\nInstructor (five items).\n\"When I ask instructors for help with something I don't\nunderstand (relating to my LAST preparation), I ask to have\nit explained to me rather than just give me the answer.\"\nStudents'Reported Adaptive Help Seeking from the Peers\n(five items).\n\"When I ask my peers for help with something I don't\nunderstand (relating to my LAST preparation), I ask to have\nit explained to me rather than just give me the answer.\"\nStudents' Reported Executive Help Seeking from the\nInstructor (five items).\n\"When I ask the instructor for help preparing for the\nLAST, I prefer the instructor do the work for me rather than\nexplain to me how to do it.\"\nStudents'Reported Executive Help Seeking from the Peers\n(five items).\n\"When I ask my peers for help preparing for the LAST, I\nprefer the instructor do the work for me rather than explain to\nme how to do it.\"\nStudents'Reported Avoidance Help Seeking (nine items).\n\"I don't ask for help in preparing for the LAST, even\nwhen the material is too hard to complete on my own.\"\nStudents' Reported Benefits of Help Seeking (seven\nitems).\n\"I like to ask for help about my LAST test preparation\nbecause it helps me understand the topic more completely.\"\nInstructor's Rating of the Students'Help Seeking\nResponse format consisted of an 8-point Likert-type scale\n(1 = Not like me at all and 8 = Very much like me).\nInstructor's Rating of the Students'Adaptive Help Seeking\n(five items).\n\"When the student is struggling with LAST-related mate-\nrial, he or she prefers to be given hints or clues rather than an\nanswer from the instructor.\"\nInstructor's Rating of the Students' Executive Help\nSeeking (five items).\n\"When this student requests help regarding LAST mate-\nrial, he or she prefers that the instructor does the work rather\nthan explain how to do it.\"\nInstructor's Rating of the Students' Avoidance Help\nSeeking (nine items).\n\"He or she does not ask for help with LAST subject mate-\nrials, even when the work is too hard to solve\nindependently.\"\nInstructor's Rating of the Students' Benefits of Help\nSeeking (seven items).\n\"This student benefits from seeking help with the difficult\nmaterial by showing improvement in comprehension of the\nmaterial.\"\nAppendix B\nMotivation and Self-Regulation Scales\nAcademic Delay of Gratification (10-item scale; Bembenutty\nResponse format consisted of a 4-point Likert-type scale\n(1 = Definitely choose A and 4 = Definitely choose B;\nA.
