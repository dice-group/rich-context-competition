Kizer, MD, MPH4\n Keywords\nquality of care, veterans, managed care, Medicare, dual use\nOriginal Research\nIntroduction\nMedicare Advantage (MA) plans and the Veterans Affairs (VA)\nhealth care system assess quality of care using, among other\nthings, standardized Healthcare Effectiveness Data and\nInformation Set (HEDIS) performance measures. Performance\ndata are publicly reported and influence health plan and pro-\nvider payments, so have material consequences. Little is known,\nhowever, about the relative accuracy of HEDIS data for persons\nreceiving care in more than one health care system.\nQuality of care performance data in the VA often exceeds\nthat reported from private health care settings generally, and\nMAplans specifically.1,2 The differences may partially result\nfrom dissimilar documentation of care in the data sources\nused for calculating performance rates. Private plans typi-\ncally generate performance data using insurance claims or\nabstracted charts, which may fail to capture the entirety of a\npatient's care compared with VA's comprehensive electronic\nhealth record (EHR).3-5 Furthermore, the VA by law cannot\nbill MA plans for services.6 Therefore, MA plans that rely\non claims to measure quality may have limited ability to\ntrack care processes that occur in the VA. We examined the\nagreement between MA and VA quality assessments for a\ngroup of dually enrolled Veterans. Our study tested the\nhypothesis that private health plans underreport quality of\ncare relative to fully integrated delivery systems utilizing a\ncomprehensive EHR.\n1Providence VA Medical Center, Providence, RI, USA\n2Brown University, Providence, RI, USA\n3The University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA\n4University of California, Davis, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAmal N. Trivedi, Providence VA Medical Center, 830 Chalkstone Avenue,\nEmail: amal_trivedi@brown.edu\nMethods\nWe identified dually enrolled individuals sampled for the\nsame MA HEDIS and VA External Peer Review Program\nWe compared performance rates reported by MA plans and\nVA and assessed agreement using McNemar test for mar-\nginal homogeneity. The unit of analysis was the patient. We\nalso conducted stratified analyses for individuals having at\nleast 10 MA outpatient encounters in the measurement year.\nResults\nThe number of individuals sampled for measurement by both\nsystems in the same year ranged from 249 (cholesterol con-\ntrol in coronary heart disease) to 600 (HbA1c testing in dia-\nbetes) (Table 1). Reported VA performance was significantly\nbetter than reported MA performance for all 12 measures,\nwith VA's performance advantage ranging from 9.8% (glyco-\n(blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg in diabetes). The overall\nderived from VAand MAaggregate data were 1.6% to 14.3%\nhigher than those reported by VA alone.\nIn sensitivity analyses limited to individuals having at\nleast 10 MA outpatient encounters, the VA reported better\nperformance than MA for 11 of the 12 measures (ranging\nfrom 9.9% to 35.9%), and overall agreement between VA\nand MA assessment improved only modestly (ranging from\nDiscussion\nThe VA classified significantly more patients as having met\noutpatient performance targets than did MA plans despite\nassessing the same individuals using identical measure\nspecifications. We observed similar degrees of disagreement\nfor both processes of care and intermediate outcomes.\nMA plans primarily use claims-based methods to assess\nprocess measures; intermediate outcome assessment typi-\ncally requires additional chart review. Pawlson and col-\nleagues noted that claims underreport quality relative to\napproaches using both claims and chart review.5 In addition,\nplans typically collect quality information from heteroge-\nneous providers in their networks. The VA's system-wide\nEHR may allow for more complete capture of quality infor-\nmation across multiple providers and settings.3,7 In addition,\nthe VA often includes clinical reminders for providers to\ndocument adherence to clinical performance metrics, even\nwhen care occurs in non-VA settings.8\nAmong persons enrolled in both systems, performance rates\nthat integrate information from both VA and MA sources were\nhigher than rates considering information from either system\nalone.Although we did not validate reported performance rates\nTable 1.

However, the VA may be positioned to report\nsubstantially better clinical performance because its documen-\ntation is more complete. Further studies should compare the\naccuracy of publicly reported quality data from insurers and\nintegrated delivery systems, particularly for individuals\nenrolled in multiple health systems.\nAuthor's Note\nThe contents of this article do not represent the views of the U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs or the United States Government.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nstudy was funded by the VA Health Services Research &\nDevelopment (HSR&D) Service.
