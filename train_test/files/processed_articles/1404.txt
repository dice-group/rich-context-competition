Davis3,4* and Wen You4\n3Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics and 4Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and\n Introduction\nThe Thrifty Food Plan (TFP)5 is a key component in determining\nthe amount of money available to participants in the Supple-\nmental Food Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly the Food\nStamp Program. As stated by the USDA, the TFP \"serves as a\nnational standard for a nutritious diet at a minimal cost\n[emphasis added] and is used as the basis for food stamp\nallotments\" (1). The TFP is essentially a nonlinear mathematical\nprogramming model that is used to provide a diet pattern\nrecommendation along with the associated monetary cost that\nmeets the \"national standard for a nutritious diet\" (1) for food\nprepared at home. Unfortunately, the TFP does not consider\nfood preparation time and therefore implicitly assumes time is\nan unlimited (free) resource. Of course time (labor) is not\nunlimited and is a crucial input in food production at home.\nThe typical SNAP family falls short of meeting the TFP\nnutritional guidelines even when the family typically has\nsufficient monetary resources to eat a healthful diet (i.e. to\nfollow the TFP recommendations) (2,3). The central question is:\nWhy? Though there are likely several reasons, we consider a\nbasic economic explanation. Introductory economics indicates\nthat in producing any type of output, such as a nutritious meal,\nindividuals will look for the least cost input combination to\nachieve that output (4). Ignoring an important input (such as\nlabor) in the cost comparison calculation will underestimate the\nreal cost of the inputs. The question we then seek to answer is:\nhow thrifty is the TFP once we include labor cost?\nRecent research has supported the fact that ignoring the labor\ncost will underestimate the total cost required to reach the TFP\nnutrition target (5,6). However, these studies did not directly\nanswer to what extent the labor cost will affect the effectiveness\nof the TFP. To directly answer that question, we used a basic\nlabor economics technique to value the labor in a home food\nproduction scenario that is required to reach the TFP nutrition\nand budget targets and calculate the total cost (inclusive of\nlabor) associated with the TFP. This TFP total cost is then\ncompared in several different ways with the total cost associated\nwith actual choices made by those families sharing the same\nprofiles as current SNAP participants. Once labor was included,\nwe found the TFP is not very thrifty. Consequently, considering\nthe total cost of food, it may not be too surprising that\nhouseholds fall short of the TFP guidelines even with \"ade-\nquate\" monetary resources.\nWith 2 main inputs (food and labor), the total cost of\nproducing a homemade meal for the entire household is the sum\nof food monetary costs (M) and labor time costs (T), or\nTC \u00bc M \u00fe T \u00bc pF\nF \u00fe pL\nL \u00bc M \u00fe pL\nwhere TC is the total cost of producing a homemade meal for the\nwhole household, pF\nis the price of food, F is the quantity of\nfood, pL\nis the price of labor in food production, and L is the\namount of labor time involved in food production. Because we\ngenerally observe the total food monetary expenditure (M) and\ncan find measurements for price of labor and time (pL\n, L), we\nwill use the last equality in Eq. 1 to perform the analysis.\n1 Supported by the Food and Nutrition Assistance Programs at the USDA (project\n2 Author disclosures: G.

First, evaluating Eq. 1 at the actual money\nand labor combinations (MActual\n, LActual\n) gives the actual total\ncost TCActual\n. Similarly, evaluating Eq. 1 at the money and labor\ncombination required to reach the TFP (MTFP\n) gives the\nTFP total cost TCTFP\n. Note Eq. 1 shows that there are numerous\npossible input combinations that could yield the same total cost,\nso just because a family is not following the TFP input levels (F\nor L) does not imply the household is spending more or less than\nthe total cost associated with the TFP.\nSecond, the cost shares for food and labor are: sF\nand sL\n= pL\nL 4 TC, respectively. Calculating input cost shares\nusing Eq. 1 will shed light on the distribution of the 2 input costs:\nif the TFP equivalent cost shares for labor is much larger than the\nactual choices made by the household (sL\nTFP . sL\nActual), it\nindicates that the TFP requirement is more labor intensive.\nIn addition, to measure the excess (deficit) a family is\nspending relative to that required by the TFP, one could take the\nratio of actual total cost to total cost associated with the TFP (i.e.\nTCActual\n). If this ratio is .1, then the household is\nspending more than enough to meet the TFP requirement of the\ntotal cost. Of course if one assumes there is no labor cost\ninvolved, this ratio reduces to the ratio of food expenditures\n(MActual\n) and this ratio could be very different from the\ntotal cost ratio if labor cost is sizable (i.e. the cost share of labor\nsL\nis large). This food expenditure ratio may be .1, indicating\nthe family is spending more than enough to meet the TFP,\nwhereas the total cost ratio could be ,1, indicating the family\nis not spending enough (i.e. MTFP\n, MActual\ndoes not imply\nTCTFP\n, TCActual\n).\nFinally, to answer a question such as: \"What is the maximum\nlabor time needed that will still make the TFP total cost thrifty\n(i.e. TCTFP\n# TCActual\n)?\" we use this inequality to determine the\nupper limit on labor time (L) required that would make the TFP\ntotal cost less than the actual total cost while keeping food\nexpenditure amount (M) unchanged. This upper limit on labor is\nLU\nTFP\n# (MActual\n)/pL\n+ LActual\n. A similar question can be\nanswered for the maximum food expenditure needed to satisfy\nthe same inequality (TCTFP\n# TCActual\n), holding the amount of\nlabor constant, and this upper money limit is MU\nTFP\n# MActual\n+\npL\n(LActual\n). The U superscript on both conditions\nindicates the upper bound. The summary of the metrics formula\ndiscussed in this section is provided (Table 1).\nTo calculate these various metrics requires household level\ndata on actual food expenditures (MActual\n) and labor time in\nfood production (LActual\n), TFP consistent food monetary expen-\nditures (MTFP\n), labor in food production (LTFP\n), and the price of\nlabor in food production (pL\n). We limited the analysis to single-\nheaded households, because these households comprise the\nmajority of SNAP participants (7). We mapped the data sources\nwith the components in the TC formula (Fig. 1). For calculating\nthe actual monetary and time amounts (MActual\n, LActual\ndatasets sampled from the same subset of the Current Popula-\ntion Survey (CPS) were linked by unique household identifiers:\nAmerican Time Use Survey (ATUS). Two published USDA\ndocuments were used for the amount of food expenditure and\ntime required to meet the TFP goals (MTFP\n). The amount of\nmoney associated with the TFP (MTFP\n) depends on the actual\nhousehold composition (e.g. household members and ages) and\nthe above merged data from FSS and ATUS provided sufficient\nhousehold composition information for us to assign the TFP\nfood monetary expenditure amounts to appropriate households.\nThe price of labor (pL\n) comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\n(BLS).\nThe actual food monetary expenditure and labor time\n(MActual\n, LActual\n) components were calculated from a data set\nmerging the FSS and the ATUS. Both FSS and ATUS are subsets\nof the CPS. The CPS is a monthly labor force survey of ;60,000\nhouseholds conducted by the Census Bureau for the BLS. Once\neach year, after answering the labor force questions from the\nCPS, the same households are asked a series of questions about\nfood security, food expenditures, and use of food and nutrition\nassistance programs and this information is the core content of\nthe FSS. The actual food monetary expenditures observed\n(MActual\n) are \"usual\" weekly household food expenditures\nreported in the FSS.\nThe actual labor time (LActual\n) comes from the ATUS. The\nATUS households are chosen from the CPS households that\ncompleted their 8th (final) interview. The ATUS contains\ndemographic, hourly wage rate, and time use information. The\nATUS collects individual time allocation data from a designated\nperson about his or her activities the previous day. The ATUS\nhouseholds are stratified by race, ethnicity, and the presence of\nchildren and are selected to ensure nationally representability.\nThe ATUS sample is randomized by day with 50% of the sample\nreporting weekday activities and 50% reporting Saturday and\nSunday activities. We considered 6 categories of time in ATUS\nthat contribute to household food production: Food and Drink\nRelated to Food and Drink Preparation, Clean-up, and Presen-\nThe TFP-required amounts on food monetary expenditure\nand time components in the TC formula (MActual\n, LActual\n) come\nfrom 2 USDA published documents (8,9).\nThe USDA food plan report provides weekly TFP food costs\nfor individuals by gender and age categories (8). Therefore, the\nTFP equivalent household food expenditures (MTFP\n) vary by\nhousehold compositions. The merged data from FSS and ATUS\ncontain information on age and gender for each household\nmember. This information enabled us to calculate the MTFP\nfor\neach household in our sample by summing the age-gender\u00ad\nspecific individual costs and then multiplying by a scale\nadjustment as described in the footnotes of the USDA report\ntables (8).\nAs indicated, the TFP does not take into account labor, so\nestimates of the amount of labor associated with the TFP (LTFP\n)\nare a little more tenuous. However, in 2000 the USDA Center for\nNutrition Policy and Promotion published Recipes and Tips for\nHealthy, Thrifty Meals (9). As stated in this USDA document,\nTABLE 1 Definitions for metrics\nMetric name Metric formula\nTFP total cost TCTFP\n+ pL\nLTFP\nFood expenditure share of TFP total cost sM\nLabor expenditure share of TFP total cost sL\nLTFP\nTFP upper food expenditure bound MU\nTFP\n< MActual\n+ pL\n(LActual\n)\nTFP upper time expenditure bound LU\nTFP\n< (MActual\n) / pL\n+ LActual\nActual total cost TCActual\n= MActual\n+ pL\nLActual\nFood expenditure share of actual total cost sM\nActual = MActual\n/ TCActual\nLabor expenditure share of actual total cost sL\nActual = pL\nLActual\n/ TCActual\nActual:TFP food expenditure ratio rM\n= MActual\nActual:TFP total cost ratio rTC\n= TCActual\nThe Thrifty Food Plan is not thrifty 855\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\n\"The menus presented here conform to the recommendations\ncontained in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the\nUSDA Food guide Pyramid\" (9). This USDA publication\ncontains 40 recipes and the associated amount of time needed\nfor food preparation and cooking, which were used to form the\nestimate of LTFP\n.\nThe last component in both the TFP and the actual\nmeasurements is the value of labor time in food production.\nThere are 2 ways in the labor economics literature to measure\nthe value of time: the opportunity cost approach and the market\nsubstitute approach (10). In this study, we used the market\nsubstitute approach, which values the household labor at the\nrate that the same activity could be purchased on the market.\nThe market substitute price (pL\n) we used is the median hourly\nwage rate from the 6-digit standard occupational classification\nfor private household cooks collected by the BLS for 2004\u00ad\nGronau (10) indicated, the market substitute approach tends to\nproduce a lower value of labor than the opportunity cost\napproach. This appears to be the case in this application as well.\nUsing the ATUS 2003 data within the opportunity cost of time\napproach, Davis and You (6) estimated the shadow value of food\nproduction time at ~$14.00/h for a similar population.\nThere are a few empirical implementation hurdles that must\nbe explained and confronted. First, food expenditures in FSS are\nreported on a weekly basis, but time expenditures in ATUS are\nreported on a daily basis. Because all days of the week are\nrepresented in the ATUS sampling process, we exploited this\ninformation and used a Horovitz-Thompson type estimator to\nestimate total weekly time for each individual (12). This\nHorovitz-Thompson type procedure uses the sample mean for\ndays of the week when the individual was not sampled coupled\nwith their reported time for the day they were sampled to\ngenerate a weekly time estimate. Because of the stratified\nsampling design, the final sampling weights will be used in all\ncalculations.\nSecond, a sample 2-wk meal plan for a family of 4 based on\nthese 40 recipes is given in the USDA Recipes and the mean\nweekly food preparation time in this plan is 16 h/d or 2.28 h/d\n(9). Obviously, other recipe combinations and therefore labor\nrequirements are possible from these 40 recipes. To gauge the\nsensitivity of the results, we cut this estimate in half and present\nthe results for 2 cases: LTFP\nThird, there are perhaps concerns about scale effects for the\nother inputs (MActual\n, TActual\n, and TTFP\n) similar to that for MTFP\n,\nwhere values are adjusted for family size. Scaling is as much an\nart as a science and specific values are difficult to justify. If the\ndata are already at the household level, such as actual food\nexpenditures (MActual\n), then no scaling is required. This leaves\nthe possible need to scale TActual\nand TTFP\n. As a reviewer points\nout, the time in food preparation is probably rather constant by\nfamily size. Furthermore, we worked with single-headed house-\nholds, so it would seem reasonable to assume this individual is\nthe main food preparer and the reported actual time (TActual\n) is\nthe household time. With respect to the TFP time estimate\n), although the time estimate may vary by family size, we\nbelieve there is more variation due to alternative combinations\nof recipes that could constitute a weekly meal plan. In either\ncase, this is another reason for conducting the sensitivity analysis\ndiscussed above.\nIn addition to limiting the analysis to single-headed house-\nhold, we trimmed the top 1% of observations from our data in\nterms of actual money expenditures and time expenditures to\nminimize the influence of outliers. There were then 6331\nhouseholds used in the final analysis.\nWe present the results of the analysis for the 2 levels of labor\nconsistent with the TFP (i.e. LTFP\n= 8) to gauge the\nsensitivity of the results (Table 2). All summary statistics used\nsampling weights inherent in the FSS-ATUS data. Regardless of\nthe value of LTFP\nused, the mean total cost (i.e. average across\ndifferent household compositions) associated with the TFP is\nhigher than the mean actual total cost. The mean total cost of\nhomemade meals is ;$20/wk more if the labor requirement to\nFIGURE 1 Data sources.\nTABLE 2 Weighted summary statistics for metrics1\nMetric\nMean SD 99% Percentile interval\nLTFP\n2 Values do not vary by LTFP\nso are the same across LTFP\nvalues.\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nmeet the TFP is 8 h/wk but is $100/wk more if this labor\nrequirement is 16 h/wk. Not too surprisingly, actual total cost\nhas a larger SD and a wider 99% percentile interval than the TFP\ntotal cost, which means actual consumer behaviors vary greatly\nfrom household to household. A comparison of the mean cost\nshares indicates that the TFP consistent input combination is\nmuch more labor intensive than the actual input combination\nthat households choose (i.e. sL\nTFP . sL\nActual), because we used the\nsame value of labor time in both components. In fact, the cost\nshares are almost exactly opposite between the TFP and actual\ntotal cost. Just averaging between the 2 labor requirement\nscenarios (i.e. LTFP\n= 8), the TFP cost share for food is\n;40% and for labor is ;60%; this labor cost share is consistent\nwith Davis and You's finding (6). In contrast, the actual cost\nshare for food is ;60% and ;40% for labor.\nThe mean actual-to-TFP food expenditure ratio indicates that\nif labor cost is completely ignored, then the mean household\nmore than adequately meets the TFP cost requirement. The\nmean household spends 34% more in actual spending compared\nwith what is required by the TFP. Alternatively, if labor cost is\nincluded, the actual-to-total cost ratio indicates that at the mean\nhouseholds spend 10% less than enough to meet the TFP cost\nrequirement, if the labor required in the TFP is 8 h/wk. If the\namount of labor required to meet the TFP is 16 h/wk, then at the\nmean households spend 40% less than enough to meet the TFP\ncost requirement. Of course, as is to be expected and as indicated\nby the SD and 99% percentile interval, there were households\nfor each measure that did spend enough resources to meet the\nTFP for the total cost ratio, but not at the mean.\nFinally, there is likely interest in what is the maximum food\nexpenditure (MU\nTFP\n) or labor (LU\nTFP\n) one could spend, holding\nthe other constant, that keeps the TFP total cost lower than the\nactual total cost (i.e. TCTFP\n# TCActual\n). If the labor requirement\nto meet the TFP is 8 h/wk, at the mean the upper bound on food\nexpenditures is $69.61, but if the labor requirement is increased\nto 16 h/wk then the mean upper bound must be a negative\n$14.58. This is to be expected, because as the labor cost\nincreases (with number of hours increasing), the food expendi-\ntures must decrease to hold total cost constant. The fact that this\nupper bound becomes negative reflects the importance of labor\ncost in the total cost calculations. The 99% percentile interval\nindicates this upper food expenditure has a rather wide range\nand reflects the fact that some households may be closer and\nsome farther away from the TFP labor requirement. Perhaps of\nmost interest for policy makers is the upper bound on labor\ninput required by TFP to make the TFP thrifty (i.e. TCTFP\n#\nTCActual\n). At the mean, this upper bound is 6.41 h/wk. This\nmeans that if policy makers want the input combination that is\ncost competitive with actual input allocations, the labor\nrequirement for the TFP can be no more than 6.41 h/wk. Note\nthis is over 2 h less than the lower estimate of 8 h/wk implied by\nDavis and You (6) and is over 10 h/wk less than that implied by\nthe sample weekly menus provided in the USDA document (9).\nThese sizable gaps indicate the need to consider time in\nintervention and food assistance program designs.\nThis analysis indicates that the TFP is not very thrifty once\nlabor cost is included. This fact provides a disincentive to adhere\nto the TFP and the accompanying food guidelines and helps\nexplain why many households do not come close to the dietary\nguidelines associated with the TFP. Just considering food\nexpenditures in isolation (i.e. ignoring labor cost) can give a\nvery distorted picture in terms of resources adequate to reach the\nTFP requirement. Though there is certainly some uncertainty\nwith respect to the amount of labor required to adhere to the\nTFP, the existing estimates indicate that the TFP requirement is\nvery labor intensive and this labor intensity is what drives the\nresults. Future work needs to obtain more precise estimates of\nthe actual labor amount needed to meet the TFP, but, as was\nshown, to make the total cost of the TFP competitive with\nactual total cost will require the labor associated with the TFP to\nbe no greater than ;6 h/wk. One simple and practical policy\nsolution is to develop more labor-efficient recipes that satisfy the\n"
