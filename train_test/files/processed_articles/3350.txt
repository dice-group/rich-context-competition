In Study 3, pairs\nof opposite-sex strangers (n \u00bc 102) interacted for 10\u00ad12 min. Males' humor production and females' responsive laughter were\nboth associated with females' dating interest. Both partners' dating interest was associated with simultaneous laughter.

Hall1\n Keywords\ncourtship, humor, sex differences, sexual selection\nIntroduction\nA good sense of humor is one of the most sought out character-\nistics in a romantic partner (Bressler, Martin, & Balshine, 2006).\nThere has been considerable debate about why and for whom\nBressler, Martin, and Balshine (2006) and Kaufman, Kozbelt,\nBromley, and Miller (2008) have suggested that humor is a\nsexually selected trait that is an honest signal of intelligence and\ncreativity, produced by males to be evaluated and appreciated by\nfemales. Therefore, humor production should be moderately\ncorrelated with creativity and intelligence (Miller, 2000), par-\nticularly verbal intelligence (Kaufman et al., 2008). Bressler\narguments by identifying two key sex differences: (i) females\nshould prefer males who produce humor more than males prefer\nfemales who produce humor and (ii) to accurately judge males'\nproductive ability and guard against deceit, females should pos-\nsess more acute humor comprehension skills. As for humor\nappreciation, Kaufman et al. (2008) propose that females who\nshow greater humor appreciation should be less preferred during\nmate selection because it is a sign of low mate quality (or des-\nperation). The present multistudy investigation utilizes three\nmeasures of humor (i.e., lens model, self-report, and observed)\nin three contexts (i.e., Facebook, self-reported courtship\nbehavior, and first-time interactions) to test Miller's (2000,\nSexual Selection\nDue to greater investment in procreation and parenting, the\nfemale sex limits mating opportunities in many species (Tri-\nvers, 1972). For human males, mating can result in reproduc-\ntion without further involvement in child rearing. Human\nfemale reproduction is substantially costlier due to the demands\nof pregnancy and weaning. This creates pressure for females to\nchoose a mate who will increase the likelihood of survival of\nthe offspring and will provide more paternal investment.\nTherefore, traits in males that are attractive to females are ones\nmost likely to meet those criteria.

Evidence show-\ning robust, or at least moderately sized, sex differences supports\ntheories of sexual selection (Kaufman et al., 2008).\nOne characteristic males might advertise and females might\nevaluateishumor production.Humor productionisdefined asthe\nability to produce humorous communication or actions, and/or to\nbe regarded by others as being witty, funny, or humorous (Thor-\nemphasizes the set of cognitive skills necessary to produce\nhumor,particularlycreativityandintelligence.Relyinguponsex-\nual signaling theory, Miller (2000) conceives of humor as a sexu-\nally selected fitness indicator of the underlying trait of\nintelligence. Fitness indicators should not be easily counterfeited\nand should bereliable indicatorsof the underlyingtrait (Kaufman\ntion to humor, humans prefer a partner with a sense of humor\nbecause it signifies good genes, particularly intelligence.\nThe relationship between intelligence/creativity and humor\nproduction is weak or mixed (Storey, 2003). Proponents of the\nhumor\u00adintelligence link (e.g., Kaufman et al., 2008) admit to\nlimited evidence of the association and note there is evidence to\nthe contrary. Kaufman et al. recommend that humor produc-\ntion, creativity, and intelligence should be ``modestly inter-\ncorrelated'' to support sexual selection claims and that humor\nproduction should be particularly associated with verbal intel-\nligence, more so than global intelligence (p. 253). For it to\nsignal underlying traits, however, others should also perceive\na relationship between humor and intelligence, yet this associ-\nation has also shown mixed support (e.g., Wilbur & Campbell,\n2011). In the context of courtship, humorous male suitors are\nconsidered less rather than more intelligent (Bressler & Bal-\nFyffe (2010) also found a negative relationship between per-\nceived humorousness and intelligence when females evaluate\nmales' pickup lines. Weisfeld et al. (2011) reported the asso-\nciation between partners' impressions of their spouses' sense of\nhumor and impressions of their spouses' intelligence in five\ncountries (i.e., United States, China, Russia, Turkey, and\nUnited Kingdom). Perceptions of intelligence were weakly\nrelated to perceptions of partner's sense of humor in three\ncountries and not associated for two others (i.e., Russia and\nTurkey). To further test Miller's argument regarding sexual\nselection and humor production in courtship:\nHypothesis 1a: Humor production will be associated with\nintelligence, particularly verbal intelligence.\nHypothesis 1b: Humor production will be perceived to be\nassociated with intelligence.\nThe sexual selection argument hinges on several key sex\ndifferences. Evidence in support of the sexual selection\nmechanism would occur when sex differences appear. The lack\nof difference would suggest that both males and females stand\nto gain similar advantages by possessing a trait. One important\nsex difference involves preference for humor production in a\npartner. According to theories of sexual selection, females\nshould prefer males who produce humor more than males pre-\nfer females who produce humor (Bressler et al., 2006; Wilbur\n& Campbell, 2011). There is some indirect evidence in support\nof this argument. In mixed sex social environments, male\nspeakers are more likely to elicit laughter from audiences, and\nfemales are more likely to laugh as audience members (Pro-\nvine, 1993). Analyses of laughter in naturally forming couples\nor groups found that while females laughed as much as males\noverall, females laughed more than males when paired with a\nmale stranger (Owren & Bachorowski, 2003) and with male\nfriends (Mehu & Dunbar, 2008). This was also found with deaf\nsigners who can see but not hear the vocal laughter of their\nconversational partners (Provine & Emmorey, 2006). Analyses\nof singles' ads found that males were more likely to offer\nhumor, and females were more likely to request a humorous\nmore, females evaluate humorous males as being a more desir-\nable relationship partner compared to males' evaluation of\nhumorous females (Bressler & Balshine, 2006; Bressler\nHypothesis 2a: Males will produce humor more than\nfemales.\nHypothesis 2b: Females will be more interested in humor-\nproducing males compared to males' interest in humor-\nproducing females.\nDistinctions between humor production, appreciation, and\ncomprehension are of particular importance when applying the\ntheory of sexual selection to humor in courtship. Humor com-\nprehension is the ability to ``get'' the joke, to see how it is\nfunny, or the ability to recognize if something is a joke (Carrell,\n1997). Humor appreciation is defined as someone who laughs a\nlot, laughs easily, and is a good audience; someone who is\nmirthful (Martin, 1998). When humor production is interpreted\nas a sign of underlying mate value, the distinction between\nhumor comprehension and appreciation becomes quite impor-\ntant. Due to disparities in investment in offspring, females\nshould exercise caution when evaluating males' advances.\nKaufman et al. (2008) argue that ``the optimal humor apprecia-\ntion system would comprehend many more attempts at humor\nthan it actually finds amusing--it should `get' many more\njokes than it genuinely laughs at . . . . Thus, humor appreciation\nmay be an important part of mate choice [by females], just as\nhumor production is an important part of courtship effort [by\nmales]'' (p. 242). Kaufman et al. argue that to accurately judge\nmales' production of humor, females should develop an acute\nability to comprehend humor or to discriminate between natu-\nrally funny or faked humor. Females' greater ability to judge\nthe humorousness of males' production is critical to Kaufman\net al.'s case of humor as a result of sexual selection. Females\nshould be more capable than males when comprehending\nhumor but not necessarily show their appreciation for males'\nhumor. Kaufman et al. (2008) argue that females who show too\nmuch appreciation should be regarded as a poor mate choice\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nbecause of their lack of discriminating ability between skillful\nand less skillful displays of humor. Therefore:\nHypothesis 3: Females should possess greater humor com-\nprehension than males.\nHypothesis 4a: Females will show more humor apprecia-\ntion than males.\nHypothesis 4b: Females who show more humor apprecia-\ntion will have lower mate value than females who show less\nhumor appreciation.\nMaterial and Method\nProcedure and Participants\nStudy 1 utilizes data gathered as part of a larger Brunswik (1956)\nlens model investigation of personality on Facebook published\nelsewhere (Hall, Pennington, & Lueders, 2014). One hundred\ntargetswererecruited througha combinationofstudentsata large\nMidwestern university who participated for partial course credit\n(n \u00bc 28) and a snowball sample of Facebook users (n \u00bc 72). The\n18\u00ad62), and female participants accounted for 57% of the sample.\nThe majority of target participants were White (88%), and other\nrace/ethnicities were represented as follows: 5% mixed race, 4%\nAsianAmerican,2% AfricanAmerican,and1% Latino/Hispanic.\nTarget participants allowed study coordinators to access and\ndownload their Facebook profiles. The eight most recent pro-\nfile pictures, all information available on the About page of the\nprofile, and any wall posts listed as ``recent'' by Facebook were\ndownloaded. The files were combined to form one pdf for each\ntarget. Targets' names were erased and replaced with `profile\nowner,' and any identifying information (i.e., contact informa-\ntion and email address) was removed.\nMeasures\nTargets completed an online survey regarding their humor\norientation (HO; Booth-Butterfield & Booth-Butterfield,\n1991; I regularly tell jokes when in groups; People usually laugh\nwhen I tell jokes or funny stories). This measure was reliable (a\n\u00bc .92). Participants also completed measures of extroversion (a\n\u00bc .88) and agreeableness (a \u00bc .80; John, Naumann, & Soto,\n2008). Five items drawn from John et al.'s measure of openness\nwere selected to measure intelligence/creativity (i.e., is original,\ncomes up with new ideas; is ingenious, a deep thinker; is inven-\ntive; is sophisticated in art, music, or literature; and has an active\nimagination). This measure was reliable (a \u00bc .78).\nTarget profiles were coded by up to four independent\ncoders. Coders were trained as a group, and the codebook was\nrefined. Reliability was measured using Krippendorf's a\nMACRO (Hayes & Krippendorf, 2007). Four user-generated\ncues were chosen as indicators of humor production: attempts\nat humor in photos (a \u00bc .60), attempts at humor in quotes in the\nAbout page (a \u00bc .76), attempts at humor in status updates (a \u00bc\n.35), and laughter (i.e., haha, LoL) in status updates (a \u00bc 1.00).\nA total of 35 observers, who were strangers to the targets,\nexamined target profiles and then estimated the HO and person-\nality of each target. HO estimates were presented in terms of how\nthe observer saw the target (i.e., ``This person regularly tells jokes\nwhen in groups''). Observers estimated target personality and\nintelligence/creativity using the same items as targets, only pre-\nsented in terms of how the observersaw the target. The evaluation\nof each target took between and 15 min, resulting in a total of\napproximately 12\u00ad16 hr per person. To prevent fatigue, observers\nsigned up for several time blocks, and after 10 targets were eval-\nuated,observers tooka 10-min break.Thirty observers completed\nall100targets,andfivedroppedoutforvaryingreasons(e.g.,time\nconflicts). Observers were paid US$75 upon completion. All\nstudyprocedureswereinstitutional reviewboard (IRB) approved.\nResults\nThe lens model technique enabled the possibility of measuring\nboth the associations among humor production (i.e., HO), intel-\nligence, and personality and the perceived associations among\nhumor production, intelligence, and personality. Bivariate corre-\nlations between profile owners' HO and intelligence were not\nsupported. The relationship between humor and extroversion\namong strangers' perceptions of profile owners' humor, intelli-\ngence, and personality were conducted. Results indicated that\nthe association between perceived HO and perceived intelli-\nHypothesis 1b was not supported. The relationship between per-\nceived HO and perceived extroversion was strong, r(99) \u00bc .73,\np < .001, and the relationship between perceived HO and per-\nceived agreeableness, r(99) \u00bc .18, p \u00bc .04, was significant.\nThree of the four content analyzed cues measuring humor pro-\nduction were positively associated with profile owners' self-\nreported HO (Table 1). Profile owner HO was associated with\nproducing humor in several places on a Facebook profile. Observ-\ners also believed that all the four cues were associated with target\nHO.InresponsetoHypothesis1b,estimatesoftargets'intelligence\nwere not related to humor production for three cues, and were\nnegatively associated with intelligence laughing in status updates\n(e.g., haha and LoL). The production of humor on Facebook pro-\nfiles was strongly associated with observers' estimates of extrover-\nsion for all the four humor production cues. A multivariate analysis\nof variance (MANOVA) tested predicted sex differences in humor\nproduction in target profiles (Hypothesis 2a), but no differences\nDiscussion\nResults demonstrate that targets' humor production was unre-\nlated to targets' self-reported intelligence (Hypothesis 1a) and\nunrelated to observers' perceptions of targets' intelligence\n(Hypothesis 1b). Although targets who produced more humor by\nself-report were indeed more likely to have humorous pictures,\nstatus updates, and quotes on their profile, these three character-\nistics were unrelated to observers' perceptions of target intelli-\ngence. Expressing laughter via status updates (e.g., haha and\nLoL) was negatively associated with perceptions of intelligence.\nExtroversion was moderately associated with targets' self-\nreported humor production and was strongly associated with\nobservers' perceptions of targets' humor production. Observers,\nwho were strangers to the targets, used all three cues of humor\nproduction when they estimated targets' humor and extroversion\nbut not when estimating intelligence. Although agreeableness\nwas associated with attempts at humor in Facebook profiles, it\nwas unassociated with targets' self-reported humor production\nand only weakly associated with observers' estimates of targets'\nhumor production. Finally, results did not support Hypothesis\n2a, which predicted sex differences in humor production.\nStudy 1 shows consistent support that humor production is\nassociated with and is perceived to be associated with extrover-\nsion, weakly associated with agreeableness, and unassociated\nwith intelligence. However, the intelligence measure in Study 1\nwas self-reported and stranger perceived rather than an exter-\nnal, objective measure of intelligence, particularly verbal intel-\nligence. Although social network sites (SNS) are an\nincreasingly common location for identifying romantic partners\n(i.e., 7% of Americans married in the last 10 years met via a\nSNS; Cacioppo, Cacioppo, Gonzaga, Ogburn, & VanderWeele,\n2013), Facebook is not explicitly a courtship context. Study 2\nuses more objective measures of intelligence and verbal ability\n(i.e., grade point average [GPA]; American College Test [ACT]\nscores) in relation to humor production, comprehension, and\nappreciation in courtship as well as self-reported mate value.\nMaterial and Method\nProcedure and Participants\nParticipants were recruited from introductory communication\ncourses at a large Midwestern university. Selecting from\nseveral study options, participants completed an online survey\ninstrument about ``humor in courtship'' in return for partial\ncourse credit. After consenting, participants completed mea-\nsures of humor, personality, mate value, scholastic achieve-\nment, and demographics. The procedure was IRB approved.\nTwo hundred eighty nine undergraduates aged 18\u00ad38 (M \u00bc\nwere White, 7% were Asian or Asian American, 6% were\nAfrican American, and 3% were Latino/Hispanic. The remain-\ning participants did not report race or ethnicity. All participants\nwere self-reported to be heterosexual.\nMeasures\nParticipants responded to all the questions in response to the\nfollowing prompt: ``For the following questions, consider how\nyou behave when you meet people you might be interested in.\nYou might be attracted to them or interested in developing a\nrelationship with them. For each question, try to think about how\nyou generally behave in that circumstance.'' All responses were\nmeasured on a 7-point Likert-type scale. To test hypotheses\nrelated to humor production, comprehension, and appreciation,\nthree existing humor inventories were consulted (i.e., Craik,\nreflect the conceptual definitions of each concept. In total, 61\nitems were included. To test the factor structure of these 61\nitems, exploratory factor analysis with principle factor analysis\nand promax rotation was conducted. Upon consulting the pattern\nmatrix and the elbow of the scree plot, the first four factors were\nselected for analysis. These four factors explained 53% of the\nHumor production was measured using 8 items from Thor-\nson and Powell's (1993) measure. Two factors of humor com-\nprehension emerged. Discerning humor comprehension was\nmeasured by 3 items reflecting understanding of a joke but a\nlack of outward response (i.e., ``I sometimes get the joke, but I\njust don't think it is funny''; ``I enjoy a good joke, but won't\nnecessarily laugh out loud''; ``I have a choosy sense of humor, I\nonly laugh when it is really funny''). This measure was com-\nposed of all new items. General humor comprehension was\nTable 1.

This\nmeasure was composed of 3 items drawn from Craik, Lampert,\nand Nelson (1996; e.g., ``Laughs at everything''; Laughs with-\nout discriminating between more or less clever remarks'') and 2\nnew items (i.e., ``I laugh at the weakest jokes''; ``I laugh easily,\nit doesn't really have to be funny'').\nAcademic achievement. Participants reported on four measures of\nacademic achievement: cumulative high school GPA (n \u00bc 289,\n.60). Those not reporting college GPA were first-semester\nfreshman, and 19% stated that they had not taken or could not\nremember their ACT scores. Extroversion and agreeableness\nwere measured using the Big Five scale (John et al., 2008).\nThe mate value measure required participants to self-report\nthe degree to which they possess qualities compared to others\nof their same sex (1 \u00bc I score much lower on this characteristic\nto 7 \u00bc I score much higher on this characteristic; Fletcher,\nSimpson, Thomas, & Giles, 1999). This measure of mate value\nhas five subdimensions: status (e.g., ``Has a nice house or\napartment''), warmth (e.g., ``A good listener in general''), vital-\nity (e.g., ``Sexy''), passionate in romantic relationships (e.g.,\n``Passionate in romantic relationships''), and committed in\nromantic relationships (e.g., ``Committed in romantic relation-\nships''). The original measure of passion in relationships\nincluded a single item regarding a sense of humor. This item\nwas removed so as not to conflate other humor measures with\nmate value (Table 2).\nResults\nTo text Hypothesis 1a, ordinary least square regression was\nconducted. Each humor construct was treated as a criterion\nvariable individually. Measures of intelligence, personality,\nand sex were treated as independent variables, and control\nvariables were age and race/ethnicity (White \u00bc 1). Humor\nproduction was positively associated with extroversion, B \u00bc\nunrelated to measures of intelligence and sex. Results do not\nsupport Hypothesis 1a or Hypothesis 2a.\nA discerning comprehension of humor was negatively\nligence and sex. General humor comprehension was associated\nunrelated to sex.

Humor appreciation was positively associated\ndo not support Hypothesis 4b, which anticipated a negative\nrelationship between humor appreciation and mate value in\nfemales.\nTable 2. Means, SD, Correlations, and Reliabilities (Study 2).\nNote. Males above the diagonal, females below the diagonal, and reliabilities on the diagonal.\nDiscussion\nNeither Hypothesis 1a nor Hypothesis 2a was supported:\nHumor production in a courtship context was unrelated to mea-\nsures of intelligence and verbal ability as measured by high\nschool and college GPA and ACT scores and showed no sex\ndifference. Factor analyses found that humor comprehension\nwas constituted by two separate factors. The first reflected an\nability to get the joke without laughing at it (i.e., being choosy),\nand the second was someone who generally gets the joke.\nNeither discerning humor comprehension nor general humor\ncomprehension showed sex differences, which did not support\nHypothesis 3. No sex differences were found in humor appre-\nciation, which did not support Hypothesis 4a. Finally, humor\nappreciation was explored in relation to mate value (Hypoth-\nesis 4b), but there was no evidence that humor appreciation was\nnegatively associated with self-perceived mate value. Rather, it\nwas positively associated with warmth and passion in a rela-\ntionship in females.\nAlthough Study 2 provided evidence supporting the rela-\ntionship between humor and extroversion and the absence of\na relationship between humor and intelligence, it was based\nupon self-reports of humor production, appreciation, and mate\nvalue. Self-reported measures of humor are weakly associated\nwith behavioral measures of joke production and laughter\n(Kohler & Ruch, 1996). Self-reported desirability is not a direct\nmeasure of mate value in a courtship-specific context. Study 3\nused observational data from recorded interactions of opposite-\nsex, heterosexual, and single strangers to further test\nhypotheses.\nMaterials and Method\nProcedure and Participants\nStudy 3 utilizes data from a study of nonverbal behavior pub-\npairs of single (i.e., not in a committed romantic relationship\nor a ``serious dating'' relationship), heterosexual students\nrecruited from introductory communication courses at a large\nMidwestern university. Participants received partial class credit\nfor participating in the study worth less than .5% of their final\ngrade. Procedures were IRB approved. Participants were pri-\nmarily White (78%), and other races/ethnicities were repre-\nsented: 7% Asian American, 7% Hispanic/Latino, 6%\nAfrican American, and 2% Native American. Mean age was\nInteraction Procedure\nOne male participant and one female participant were sched-\nuled to arrive at the interaction lab for the same 20-min time\nperiod. Upon arrival, participants were led to separate rooms\nand gave written consent to be audio- and video-recorded.\nWhen both participants had arrived, they were brought to the\nsame room and introduced. The interaction lab had two chairs\nfacing one another at a distance of approximately 3 feet. Two\ndigital, wall-mounted cameras recorded the interaction. After\nbeing introduced, the participants were read study instructions.\nThey were told the purpose of the study was to better under-\nstand how people form first impressions and that they would be\ninteracting for about 10 min. To help facilitate and standardize\nthe conversation, a set of prescreened question cards were pro-\nvided. Each participant chose 5 of the 10 cards and took turns\nasking each other the questions. Participants were instructed\nthat the goal of the interaction was to have a conversation, so\nthey did not need to ask all the questions on the cards. They\nwere encouraged to go on tangents and ask their own questions.\nParticipants were asked to keep talking until the researcher\nreturned.\nPostinteraction Procedure\nAfter at least 10 min but no more than 12 min had passed,\nparticipants were interrupted by the researcher and put in sep-\narate rooms. Without consulting each other, both completed a\npostinteraction questionnaire. Participants were asked if they\nhad met their interaction partner previously and none indicated\nthat they had. Dating interest was measured using 4 items. Two\nitems were adapted from Grammer and Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1990;\ni.e., ``I would go on a date with him/her,'' ``I would give my\nphone number to my partner if I were asked for it'') and 2 items\nwere created (i.e., ``I would like to meet this person again,'' ``I\nwould like to talk to this person again''). The measure was\nMeasures: Humor Production and Appreciation\nCoders were trained individually and as a group for 15 hr by\ncoding videos from pilot data to standardize codebook use.\nAfter training, coders independently coded the videos. Relia-\nbility was calculated using Hayes and Krippendorff's (2007) a\nMACRO. Behaviors were counted for each minute of the inter-\naction. Humor production was operationalized as attempts at\nhumor during the conversation (/ \u00bc .67). Type of humor was\nnot differentiated. Humor appreciation was measured in two\nways: laughter in response to humorous attempt (/ \u00bc .90;\nMehu & Dunbar, 2008) and simultaneous laughing (Grammer\nResults\nTo test Hypothesis 2a and Hypothesis 4a, two paired samples\nt-tests were conducted. Hypothesis 2a was not supported: males\nattempted more humor per minute, M \u00bc .20, SD \u00bc .20, than\nfemales, M \u00bc .14, SD \u00bc .17, but this difference was not sig-\nnificant, t \u00bc 1.77, p \u00bc .08. In support of Hypothesis 4a, females\nlaughed at more of males' humor attempts, M \u00bc .10, SD \u00bc .14,\nthan males laughed at females' humor attempts, M \u00bc .05,\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nWhen data are collected from conversational partners, par-\nticipants' responses are related (Kenny, Kashy, & Cook, 2006).\nOne partner's humor production and the other partner's laugh-\nter are dependent upon one another; they are nonindependent.\nAs recommended by Kenny et al. (2006) for distinguishable\ndyads, the Actor-Partner Independence Model (APIM) and\nstructural equation modeling were used to estimate one's own\nproduction and appreciation of humor with one's own dating\ninterest (actor effect) and with one's partner's dating interest\n2007). By correlating the error terms of the variables, the APIM\naccounts for shared variance of the dyad. The actor effects\ndemonstrate whether one's own humor production or apprecia-\ntion is associated with one's own dating interest. Partner effects\ntest whether one's own humor production or appreciation is\nassociated with partners' dating interest. Dyads were consid-\nered distinguishable by sex. As recommended by Kenny et al.\n(2006), when significant effects were identified for males or\nfemales, they were fixed to be equivalent. If model fit was\nunchanged, as determined by a w2 test, then paths were consid-\nered equivalent. If model fit worsened, paths were considered\ndistinct and sex differences were reported.\nHumor production was not associated with dating interest in\nappreciation showed different results. The number of humor\nattempts that a female laughed at was positively associated\nwith her dating interest in her male partner, b \u00bc .168, SE \u00bc\ndemonstrated a complementary pattern of results. Namely,\nhumor production by males was associated with females' dat-\nproduction by females was not associated with males' dating\nmales was unrelated to dating interest by females, b \u00bc \u00c0.011,\nSE \u00bc .123, p \u00bc .93. Humor appreciation by females was unre-\nlated to dating interest by males, b \u00bc \u00c0.007, SE \u00bc .111, p \u00bc\n.95. Finally, humor appreciation, measured through simulta-\nneous laughter, was positively associated with females' dating\nBecause female humor appreciation--through laughter--\nwas dependent upon the number of attempts at humor the\nmale made, one additional analysis was conducted. Female\nlaughter was divided by male humor production, creating a\nratio of male attempt-to-female laughs. This ratio was unas-\nsociated with male dating interest, b \u00bc .21, SE \u00bc .69, p \u00bc .36,\nFemale laughing at a higher or lower portion of humorous\nattempts (i.e., being less or more discriminating) was unre-\nlated to dating interest.\nDiscussion\nStudy 3 confirmed the results of Study 2 by demonstrating that\nthere was no sex difference in humor production (Hypothesis\n2a). However, there was evidence in support of Hypothesis 2b\nin that the more attempts at humor a male made and the more of\nthose attempts a female laughed at, the more interested in dat-\ning the female was. This relationship was not found for males.\nResults also supported Hypothesis 4a in that females showed\nmore humor appreciation (i.e., more laughs) than did males,\nconfirming other observational studies (Owren & Bachor-\nners laughed at the same time, both males and females were\nmore interested in dating one another (Grammer & Eibl-\nEibesfeldt, 1990). Results do not support Hypothesis 4b, which\npredicted that females who show more humor appreciation\nwould have lower mate value than females who show less\nhumor appreciation. When humor appreciation was measured\nby laughter in response to attempts at humor, results indicated\nthat males' dating interest in females was unrelated to females'\nhumor appreciation. Furthermore, the attempt to laugh ratio\ndemonstrated that a female having a more discriminating\nhumor appreciation was not considered more attractive by a\nmale nor was it indicative of her attraction to him.\nGeneral Discussion\nsuggest that humor production is an honest signal of underlying\ncreativity and intelligence. To effectively serve as such a sig-\nnal, humor production should moderately correlate with intel-\nligence and creativity, and this link should be found in others'\nperceptions of the humor producer. Study 1 found no evidence\nthat humor production (i.e., HO) showed any association with\nunderlying intelligence or perceived intelligence. Rather,\nhumorous behavior on Facebook was consistently perceived\nto be associated with profile owners' extroversion. This asso-\nciation was accurate: profile owners who scored higher on HO\nwere indeed more extraverted. Study 2 confirmed these results\nby demonstrating that self-reported humor production (Thorson\n& Powell, 1993) was associated with extroversion but not\nassociated with college or high school GPA, overall ACT\nscores, and verbal scores on the ACT. The lack of a humor\u00ad\nintelligence association supports past courtship research (e.g.,\nof the literature; humor production is not associated with intel-\nligence but is related to extroversion.\nThe sexual selection argument predicted sex differences in\nhumor production and humor appreciation in courtship con-\nsex difference in self-reported HO (i.e., the ability to create\nhumor) or the four indicators of humor production in users'\nFacebook profiles. Study 2 found no sex difference in humor\nproduction, humor appreciation, and two measures of humor\ncomprehension. Despite the argument that males should\npossess a more skillful ability to produce humor and females a\nmore skillful ability to comprehend humor, no such differences\nappeared in self-report measures.\nThe present investigation also explored associations among\nhumor production, humor appreciation, and mate value. Study\n2 failed to find the predicted negative relationship between\nhumor appreciation and mate value in females (Kaufman\net al., 2008). Rather it revealed a positive association with\nself-reported warmth and passion in a romantic relationship,\nwhich supports prior research that being responsive to humor is\na sign of warmth and relational connection (Li et al., 2009;\nOwren & Bachorowski, 2003). Females who were selective\nand choosey in humor comprehension were introverted and\ndisagreeable in personality, which suggests that humor com-\nprehension without appreciation (i.e., being very choosy) might\nadversely serve a female wishing to attract a partner. This\nevidence directly runs against the argument that a discerning\ncomprehension of humor would be to females' advantage in the\nmating market.\nStudy 3 found that males who produced more humor con-\nversed with females who were more interested in dating. Yet,\nthere was no support for the argument that females who showed\nmore humor appreciation would have lower mate value com-\npared to females who show less humor appreciation. Rather,\nmales' dating interest in females was unrelated to females'\nhumor appreciation. The portion of males' attempts at humor\nlaughed at by females was also unrelated to dating interest. It\nwas not the case that very selective (i.e., laugh at few or no\nattempts) or very appreciative females (i.e., laughed at all\nattempts) had higher or lower mate value from the perspective\nof males.\nAlternative Explanations\nTwo hypotheses were supported, but only in Study 3: females\nappreciated males' humor more than males appreciated\nfemales' humor, and females who appreciated males' attempts\nat humor were more interested in dating than males who appre-\nciated females' attempts at humor. All other hypotheses drawn\nfrom the humor production as intelligence argument were not\nsupported across all three studies. Are there alternative expla-\nnations of the results?\nConsistent with past reviews of research (e.g., Martin,\n1998), the present research suggests that humor production is\nstrongly associated with extroversion, and perceptually associ-\nated with extroversion and warmth. The production of humor\nmay not be a reliable indicator of intelligence, but it might be\nan indicator of these other desirable traits. Displaying social\nfacility and warmth through humor production may be a useful\nmating strategy because those traits are highly valued by both\nsexes (Kenrick, Groth, Trost, & Sadalla, 1993), particularly for\nlong-term relationships (Didonato, Bedminster, & Machel,\nThe present investigation failed to find sex differences in\nhumor production (Study 1\u00ad3), and only found a sex difference\nin humor appreciation in face-to-face interactions between\nopposite-sex, heterosexual strangers (Study 3). Consistent with\nfemales laughed at male speakers more than males laughed at\nfemale speakers. More laughter by females, however, does not\nappear to be a result of more humor production by males.\nCompared to producing humor, ``laughter is involuntary and\nhard to fake, providing an uncensored, honest account about\nwhat people really think about each other'' (Provine, 2012,\np. 55). A man might actively attempt to make a woman laugh\nnot because his humor is an honest signal of his intelligence,\nbut because her response is honest signal of her liking (see also\nLi et al., 2009). The sex difference in laughing in mixed sex\ninteractions may be a product of strategic attempts by a male to\nget a female to reveal the degree to which she is attracted or\ninterested. During courtship, females often evaluate the degree\nto which males are likeable, and males try to engender that\nlikeability through humorous banter or behavior, but not neces-\nsarily through making comments or telling stories that are\nobjectively funny (Provine, 1993). The results of the present\ninvestigation suggest that this strategy may indeed be quite\neffective--more humor production by males is associated with\nfemale partners' dating interest, and females' laughter in\nresponse to males' humor attempts is an indicator of females'\ndating interest.\nThe final explanation for the results of the present investi-\ngation treats sharing humor as valuable in its own right, not for\nwhat it signals or reveals. Mutual laughter was associated with\nboth male and female dating interest--although more strongly\nso for females--echoing the results of Grammer and Eibl-\nEibesfeldt (1990) who used a design similar to Study 3. A\ngeneral sense of humor (i.e., loves to laugh) is both offered\nby and requested in a romantic partner of both sexes (Wilbur\n& Campbell, 2011). In long-term romantic relationships, Hall's\n(2013) mediation analyses between humor style and relation-\nship satisfaction suggested that the primary value of humor in\nrelationships is its ability to share positive emotions or to\namuse oneself and one's partner through laughter and good\ncheer. Therefore, sharing humor may function in a manner very\nsimilar to having an agreeable and warm personality yielding a\nhigher probability of relationship success. Kenrick et al. (1993)\nargues that a tendency to choose partners who were ``easy to\nget along with, then, would have been adaptive to the extent\nthat it would have resulted in higher probabilities of pair per-\nthat humor ``is prized during mate selection and valued in\nromantic partners because a good sense of humor signals that\nfuture interactions with this person are likely to be easier and\nwill include more laughter and fun'' (p. 288). The present study\nfound that mutual laughter was particularly important for pre-\ndicting dating interest, which suggests that shared laughter\nmight be a pathway toward developing a more long-lasting\nrelationship.\nOne challenge to the present investigation is the lack of\nsufficient measurement of humor comprehension. Although\nStudy 2 explored sex differences in comprehension through\nself-report, Study 3 was unable to distinguish humor\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\nappreciation from humor comprehension through observation\nof behavior. Simply, people laugh at jokes they do not fully\ncomprehend and comprehend jokes they do not laugh at. There-\nfore, laughter, even in response to jokes, is not a clear indicator\nof true appreciation (i.e., it was really funny) or comprehension\n(i.e., I really got the joke). Instead, laughter--by speaker and\naudience alike--signals playfulness, a lack of seriousness, con-\nfirmation, or irony (Owren & Bachorowski, 2003; Storey,\n2003). It is even questionable whether individuals can distin-\nguish why they laugh when they do. Individuals are not able to\ncontrol true laughter; laughing takes much longer to produce\nthan a simulated ha-ha response, suggesting it is under weak\nThe present investigation suggests that sex differences in\nhumor appreciation are most likely to occur when measured\nby responsive laughing during face-to-face, opposite-sex inter-\nactions (Study 3), rather than by self-report (Study 2). Perhaps\nduring the first stages of courtship, attempts at humor by males\nand laughter by females are part of a culturally informed court-\nship script. Masculinity and femininity are associated with a\nhusbands-joke and wives-laugh sex difference in more tradi-\ntional marriages (Honeycutt & Brown, 1998). Humor produc-\ntion during courtship could be interpreted as a sign of\ndominance and laughter in response to a sign of submissiveness\nfor gender (i.e., masculinity/femininity) or gender ideology\n(e.g., ambivalent sexism) within individuals might better\naccount for this particular sex difference during courtship. In\nas much that some females prefer more masculine males and\nsome males prefer more feminine females, they may display\nand reinforce humor behaviors (i.e., production by males;\nlaughter by females) to fit those gender roles. Perhaps flirting\nby joking around by males is particularly attractive to tradi-\ntional females, and females serving as a responsive audience\nare most attractive to traditional males.\n"
