    "abstract": "Abstract: This theoretical article views children's risky play from an evolutionary\nperspective, addressing specific evolutionary functions and especially the anti-phobic\neffects of risky play. According to the non-associative theory, a contemporary approach to\nthe etiology of anxiety, children develop fears of certain stimuli (e.g., heights and\nstrangers) that protect them from situations they are not mature enough to cope with,\nnaturally through infancy. Risky play is a set of motivated behaviors that both provide the\nchild with an exhilarating positive emotion and expose the child to the stimuli they\npreviously have feared. As the child's coping skills improve, these situations and stimuli\nmay be mastered and no longer be feared. Thus fear caused by maturational and age\nrelevant natural inhibition is reduced as the child experiences a motivating thrilling\nactivation, while learning to master age adequate challenges. It is concluded that risky play\nmay have evolved due to this anti-phobic effect in normal child development, and it is\nsuggested that we may observe an increased neuroticism or psychopathology in society if\nchildren are hindered from partaking in age adequate risky play.\n",

Individual differences in\nrisk-taking among children (see, e.g., Morrongiello and Lasenby-Lessard, 2006;\nthis article. Rather, this article focuses on human universals in children's way of exploring\nchallenges in their play environment. Risky play will therefore be considered as part of\nchildren's normal development. This suggests that disturbances in the species' anticipated\nstimulation (i.e., the lack of risky play) may be part of the etiology of psychopathology.\nSpecifically, fear of real dangers as an evolutionary adapted non-associative process\n(Poulton and Menzies, 2002b) will be suggested as part of normal development. Risky\nplay, we will argue, is a part of the normal process that adapts the child to its current\nenvironment through first developing normal adaptive fear to initially protect the child\nagainst ecological risk factors, and thereafter risky play as a fear reducing behavior where\nthe child naturally performs exposure behavior (Allen and Rapee, 2005). This may be\nframed more cognitively: The child is motivated to conduct behavioral experiments\ninvestigating their environment \u00ad with a reduction of safety behavior (Wells, 1997). Both\nof these formulations mirror effective modern anxiety treatment (Allen and Rapee, 2005;\nWells, 1997). We will also address the evolutionary psychopathology perspective of\nmismatch (Nesse and Williams, 1995); i.e., where the modern environment does not\nchild does not receive the adequate stimulation by the environment through risky play, the\nfear will continue despite no longer being relevant (due to features of the ecology no longer\nconstituting a risk, and the child's improved competencies due to physical and\npsychological maturation) and may turn into an anxiety disorder: fear responses toward\nimagined or exaggerated threats and dangers that reduce the individual's ability to function\ndespite the individual having developed the abilities to handle these situations. This article\ndovetails with recent contributions to the field by Pellegrini, Dupuis and Smith (2007).\nWhile they consider safe skill acquisition while in an immature state in general, we\nconsider specifically how anxiety demotivates children from partaking in too risky\nbehaviors, while at the same time through thrilling play experiences motivates children to\ncontinuously challenge themselves and develop age relevant skill sets as they mature.\nChildren's Risky Play, Injuries and Hazards\nRisky play is thrilling and exciting forms of play that involve a risk of physical\ninjury. Risky play primarily takes place outdoors, often as challenging and adventurous\nphysical activities, children attempting something they have never done before, skirting the\nborderline of the feeling of being out of control (often because of height or speed) and\novercoming fear (Sandseter, 2009; Stephenson, 2003). Rather than the avoidance inducing\nemotion of fear, a more thrilling emotion is experienced. Most of the time risky play occurs\nin children's free play as opposed to play organized by adults (Sandseter, 2007a,c).\nIn modern western society there is a growing focus on the safety of children in all\nareas, including situations involving playing. An exaggerated safety focus of children's\nplay is problematic because while on the one hand children should avoid injuries, on the\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nother hand they might need challenges and varied stimulation to develop normally, both\nStephenson, 2003; Stutz, 1995). Children test possibilities and boundaries for action within\ntheir environment through play, most often without being aware that this is what they are\ndoing. Apter (2007) outlines the importance in which this may aid survival when, later in\nlife, watchful adults are no longer present. The rehearsal of handling real-life risky\nsituations through risky play is thus an important issue. Paradoxically, we posit that our\nfear of children being harmed by mostly harmless injuries may result in more fearful\nchildren and increased levels of psychopathology.\nStatistics of playground accidents from several countries show that most of the\ninjuries related to children's play are species normal and less severe \u00ad injuries that children\nthroughout evolutionary history have experienced without suffering any permanent harm,\nsuch as bruises, contusions, concussions and fractures \u00ad as results from falls or hits from\nswings, slides, climbing frames or other equipment (Ball, 2002; Bienefeld, Pickett, and\nCarr, 1996; Illingworth, Brennan, Jay, Al-Ravi, and Collick, 1975; Mack, Hudson, and\n1992), while the fatal playground injuries that result in death or severe invalidity are very\nal., 2001). Thus the injuries themselves rarely constitute trauma that might influence\nnormal development. While such may occur, and some children are more prone to such\nserious accidents and it is important to identify and prevent these children from harming\nthemselves our focus in this article is, as mentioned, on normal children and development.\nFurther reviews on children's accidents on playgrounds have found that the most\ncommon risk factors are not the characteristics of the equipment, but rather the children's\nbehavior and normal rashness, such as walking or turning summersaults on top of a\nclimbing frame, standing (or even standing on the shoulder of others) on the swing, or\npushing others off a slide or a swing (Ball, 2002; Coppens and Gentry, 1991; Illingworth et\nsafe the equipment, the children's need for excitement seems to make them use it\ndangerously.\nResearch has indicated a relationship between a child's willingness to take risks and\ntheir injury proneness (Matheny, 1987; Morrongiello, Ondejko, and Littlejohn, 2004; Potts,\nMartinez, and Dedmon, 1995). Studies identify a certain group of children who are high\nrisk takers (e.g., high on Extraversion and low on Inhibitory Control) and tend to\noverestimate their physical ability (Miller and Byrnes, 1997; Plumert, 1995; Plumert and\nSchwebel, 1997; Schwebel and Plumert, 1999), although the relationship between such\noverestimation and injury is somewhat inconsistent between studies (Plumert, 1995;\nSchwebel and Plumert, 1999). Studies have further found that a relatively small proportion\nof children tend to account for a large proportion of injuries, and that externalizing\nbehavioral problems such as aggression, over-/hyperactivity (ADHD) and opposition\ntowards parents seem to be important predictors for injuries in this group (Cataldo, Finney,\nOrdo\u00f1ana, Caspi, and Moffitt, 2008; Spinks, Nagle, Macpherson, Bain, and McClure,\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nResearch showing that overestimation of one's own ability is higher among 6 year\nolds than among 8 year olds who seem to have developed a better ability to make accurate\njudgments about risk situations. This suggests that children learn to judge risks through\nexperience with risky situations and by developing the cognitive skills necessary to make\nmore accurate judgments (Plumert, 1995; Plumert and Schwebel, 1997). Also, greater\namounts of direct experience with a risky situation itself is found to be associated with\nlower risk appraisals in the situation (DiLillo, Potts, and Himes, 1998), probably partly\nbecause experience leads to the ability to manage the risk (Adams, 2001) and develop a\nmore sound sense of the actual risk in the situation (Ball, 2002; Plumert, 1995). Other\nstudies have found that younger children (2nd graders) anticipated greater injury severity\nand more fear than older children (4th graders and 6th graders) in open-ended high-risk\nsituations (Peterson, Gillies, Cook, Schick, and Little, 1994). Similar results were found\nsuggest that this may be explained by children becoming desensitized to the possibility of\ninjuries by repeatedly experiencing near injury or minor injuries, while another explanation\nmay be that they become better at both assessing and managing the risk (Adams, 2001;\nBall, 2002; Plumert, 1995) \u00ad and, we claim, reduce their fear of these situations\nsimultaneously. Investigating risk taking along the continuum from young child to\nadolescence, Boyers' (2006) extensive review of research on the development of risk\ntaking showed that risk taking is likely to increase with age because of both child\ncharacteristics (e.g., cognitive development, emotional regulation and psychobiological\ndevelopment) and social characteristics (e.g., parents, peers, environment).\nWith age, play will change in quality \u00ad e.g., roughhousing turns more into real\nfights where the thrill of playing often will be replaced with more aggression and the\nactivity seems to be more focused on establishing more adult-like hierarchies (Pellegrini\nand Long, 2003; Smith, 2005). Further, for adolescent and young adult males the Young\nMale Syndrome (Wilson and Daly, 1985) kicks in \u00ad and one assumes that, due to sexual\nselection (both intra-sexual selection, competing with other males, and inter-sexual\nselection, attempting to catch the attention of females), males of these ages take hazardous\nrisks, resulting in hypophobia (Kennair, 2007; Marks and Nesse, 1994) and increased\nResearch on children's risk perception and injury proneness overall show that this is\na complex issue where several factors (e.g., developmental, personality, emotional, social,\nenvironmental, parental) contribute to explain why childhood injuries occur (Cataldo et al.,\nal., 2004; Ordo\u00f1ana et al., 2008; van Aken, Junger, Verhoeven, van Aken, and Dekovi,\ncharacteristics must be considered when studying child injuries, and that one also has to\ntake into consideration the child's age in terms of differences in parenting characteristics as\nthe child grows older (e.g., child characteristics becoming more influential as the parents\nStill, most of the studies mentioned do not distinguish between minor and severe\ninjuries but rather treat all injuries, mostly reported through parents' self-report measures,\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nas one. The most common way to distinguish minor and severe injuries in these studies (in\nthe few cases this is done) is to categorize injuries that need medical treatment as\nsevere/serious injuries, while home-treated injuries are minor injuries. Due to this a lot of\nnon-severe injuries (even medically treated) that will heal well and have no further impact\non the child's life are counted as severe. In this article, a starting point of our approach is\nthat minor injuries are a natural part of children's activity and development and should\ntherefore not be regulated out of children's everyday lives (Wyver et al., 2010). We believe\nthat it is the severe and lethal accidents that should be avoided.\nThis leads to the important issue of distinguishing between risks and hazards when\ndiscussing risks that children can face through their activities (Little, 2010). The term risk-\ntaking is usually interpreted negatively, seeing risk and hazard as synonymous (Lupton and\nTulloch, 2002). For instance, within the developmental psychology literature, risk-taking is\nusually defined as the engagement in behaviors that are associated with some probability of\nnegative outcomes (Boyer, 2006). However, most people meet situations that involve some\nelement of risk throughout their everyday lives. We need, through experience and learning,\nto be prepared to meet these risks and to manage them. In this view, risk can be defined not\nnecessarily as just negative, but as situations in which we are required to make choices\namong alternate courses of action where the outcome is unknown (Little, 2010). This\nmeans that risk is not necessarily a danger that needs to be avoided but rather something\nthat needs to be managed (Ball, Gill, and Spiegal, 2008). Greenfield (2003) argues that a\ndistinction should be drawn between hazard being something the child does not see, and\nrisk being uncertainty of outcome and requiring a child's choice whether to take the risk or\nnot. Adults should therefore try to eliminate hazards that children cannot see or manage\nwithout removing all risks, so that children are able to meet challenges and choose to take\nrisks in relatively safe play settings. This means finding the balance between those risks\nthat foster learning and the hazards that can result in serious injury (Little, 2010).\nIn this article the focus is, as mentioned, on normal children, and not on injury\nprone children or children with pathological proneness to injuries, nor the extremely shy\nand introverted children who actively avoid all risks, negative emotions, social situations\nand challenges. We also take a positive approach to risk, distinguishing between hazards as\nnegative and risks as positive and thrilling challenges (Little, 2010) that will improve\nchildren's risk management and risk perception (Adams, 2001; Ball, 2002; Sandseter,\nIt seems that a large proportion of normal children have an urge to explore their\nenvironment and to engage in risky forms of play where they can rehearse fighting skills,\nand test their physical strength and courage, even though it involves the possibility of\nStephenson, 2003). Could this be due to our evolved psychology? And in that case what is\nthe adaptive effect of seeking risky situations (albeit as noted, these situations are more\nthrilling than really dangerous)?\nThe Etiology of Anxiety and Phobias\nUntil recently, most have believed that anxiety disorders were acquired due to\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nnegative experiences with different stimuli (e.g., Rachman, 1977), i.e., combinations of\nclassical and operant conditioning (as in Mowrer's two-factor theory) and social cognitive\nlearning theory. This has been challenged by different studies by Poulton and colleagues.\nPoulton and Menzies (2002a, 2002b) suggest that anxiety appears as a normal part of the\nchild's maturation, and that anxiety vanishes again due to a natural interaction with the\nanxious stimulus as part of normal development. They argue for a non-associative theory of\nphobias and fear acquisition, suggesting that liability to fears and phobias are innate and\nevolutionarily arisen, as opposed to the conditioning perspective of phobias being elicited\nby experience and learning. This theory has strong support in research of several fears and\nphobias (e.g., heights, water, separation; Poulton, Davies, Menzies, Langley, and Silva,\n1998; Poulton, Menzies, Craske, Langley, and Silva, 1999; Poulton, Milne, Craske, and\nMenzies, 2001; Poulton, Waldie, Craske, Menzies, and McGee, 2000; Poulton, Waldie,\nMenzies, Craske, and Silva, 2001). Kendler, Myers and Prescott (2002) similarly found no\nsupport for the stress-diathesis model for phobias in a sample of twins. Rather, Kendler et\nal. interpret their findings as strong support of the non-associative theory of phobias and\nfear acquisition. Thus a contemporary approach to the etiology of anxiety disorders\nconsiders that they are due in large part to an interplay between genes and environment,\nand that they appear at a developmentally relevant age. Normal interaction with the\nrelevant environment may thereafter reduce anxiety. We suggest that normal interaction to\na large degree consists of risky play \u00ad which combines positive and activating emotions\n(e.g., thrilling sensations) with both a motivation to seek exposure and safety behavior\nreduction. Similarly, exposure therapy of anxiety patients attempts to create clinical\nsettings that simulate this natural anti-phobic behavior in order to habituate, but more\nimportantly provide the patient with a sense of coping. This also highlights what may be\nthe result of not having the opportunity to engage in risky play: The child may not\nexperience that he or she naturally can cope with the fear-inducing situations. And despite\nhaving matured mentally and physically enough to master the previously dangerous\nsituations, one may continue to be anxious. Continued anxiety hijacks the adaptive function\nof fear and causes non-adaptive avoidance of situations that were but no longer are\ndangerous for the individual due to maturation and increased skills.\nChildren's Play in an Evolutionary Context\nAccording to Pinker (1995) one of human children's evolved mental mechanisms is\nthe module to face danger, \"including the emotions of fear and caution, phobias for stimuli\nsuch as heights, confinement, risky social encounters, and venomous and predatory\nanimals, and a motive to learn the circumstances in which each is harmless\" (p. 420).\nWhile evolutionists in general have been accused of being biased, from a\ndevelopmental perspective, to focus on sexually reproductively mature adults \u00ad due to the\nultimate importance of reproduction to the process of evolution \u00ad evolutionary\ndevelopmental psychologists need to consider the age and context-specific evolutionary\nmechanisms behind development (Bjorklund and Ellis, 2005; Bjorklund and Pellegrini,\n2000; Blasi and Bjorklund, 2003). Children need to survive in order to reproduce. They\nalso have to develop to be able to reproduce. In order to do this they need to solve age\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nspecific adaptive tasks. There are therefore predictable mental adaptations associated with\nchildhood. These adaptations will increase the likelihood of solving survival tasks and tasks\ninvolving getting the necessary developmental stimulation, such as the sucking reflex in\nmammals (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2000), imitations and facial gestures by the infant as\nfacilitating mother \u00ad infant social interaction and communication (Bjorklund, 1987;\nBjorklund and Pellegrini, 2000), infants typical high pitched crying combined with gasping\nas an evolved mechanism to receive attention and care from their parents (Thompson,\npsychological mechanisms that enable children to learn language (easier than in older age)\nin order to communicate effectively (Pinker, 1995).\nBekoff and Byers (1981) state that play in general would have been eliminated, or\nnever would have evolved, unless it had beneficial results (functions) that outweighed its\ndisadvantages (costs). The ontogenetic adaptive function of play is that children may learn\nskills that are important for adulthood (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2000, 2002; Pellegrini and\nBjorklund, 2004; Pellegrini and Smith, 1998). Still, some of the presumably adaptive\ncharacteristics of infancy and childhood are not adaptations for later adulthood, but rather\nhave been selected to adapt individuals to their current environment. Play might therefore\nbe a specific adaptation relevant primarily to childhood (Pellegrini and Bjorklund, 2004;\nPellegrini and Smith, 1998) with both deferred and immediate benefits (Bekoff and Byers,\nand Pellegrini (2000), this view is consistent with the perspective that the functional\npressure of natural selection also exists during childhood.\nAccording to Bruner (1976), play provides a less risky situation than \"real life,\"\nthus minimizing the consequences of one's actions. Aldis (1975) and Smith (2005) argue\nthat play for practice initially evolved from immature agonistic behavior such as play\nfighting and pursuit-and-flight behavior, which had selective advantages for survival\nbecause individuals engaging in this play were more trained in survival behavior than were\nthose without such practice. Similarly, Sutton-Smith (1997) discusses that play in an\nevolutionary selective model creates uncertainties and risks that children rehearse when\nmanaging both fictive and real play situations.\nRisky Play and Hypophobia\nTwo opposing approaches to explaining risky play behavior would be a general\nimmaturity in considering dangers, or that the risk-taking behavior itself is sought out\nespecially and the risk is compensated by the stimulation it provides. The low level of\nactual harm \u00ad both in rough and tumble play and general risky play \u00ad suggests that the\nimmaturity explanation is not convincing. Rather, risky play seems to involve a certain\ndegree of hypophobia (Marks and Nesse, 1994) or a suspended fear of being hurt in\npotentially harmful situations. Many phenomena in the modern ecology are real hazards \u00ad\nthe large amounts of sugar, fat and salt, driving, unprotected intercourse, guns, medication,\nrazorblades, etc. are dangerous items that do not naturally elicit fear reactions; few people\nconsider the risk of driving along the highway. On the other hand, the very common\nphobias include fear of heights, water, the dark, and animals such as spiders, snakes,\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nrodents and birds. This suggests that hypophobia may be due to a mismatch between our\nspecies' ancestral environment (i.e., the environment our species evolved to be adapted to)\nand the modern environment (Nesse and Williams, 1995). If one calculated the risk of the\nmodern phenomena versus the more evolutionary relevant stimuli one will soon see that we\nare hypophobic of real risks, and hyperphobic of non-hazardous risks. Most cases of risky\nbehavior would elicit fear, which would reduce risky behavior. Therefore, the lack of\nadaptive fear in risky play warrants an explanation \u00ad preferably an evolutionary\nexplanation, as risky play provides an evolutionary paradox. Both the evolution and the\ndevelopment of fear and anxiety (Kennair, 2007; Marks and Nesse, 1994) may therefore be\nrelevant to an understanding of risky play.\nMental development might also influence the assessment of risk. Parenthood, or just\nbeing in a caretaker or caregiver role, may increase adaptive worry in order to keep\nchildren safe. Findings that, e.g., children are more at risk from injury through accidents\nwhen fathers rather than mothers are involved in taking care of them suggests that maybe\nmothers have specific care giving mechanisms involving adaptive worry (Schwebel and\nBrezausek, 2004). Regarding risk perception, it is also of interest to consider how more\nimpulsive children with ADHD seem to be more hypophobic of dangerous situations than\nchildren in general (Barkley, 2001; DiScala, Lescohier, Barthel, and Li, 1998; Gayton,\nBailey, Wagner, and Hardesty, 1986; Swensen et al., 2004), as well as the findings that\nchildren with a highly active and risk taking temperament engage in more risk taking\nbehavior and thus experience more unintentional injuries (Matheny, 1987; Plumert and\nSchwebel, 1997; Potts, Martinez, and Dedmon, 1995; Schwebel, Brezausek, and Belsky,\n2006; Schwebel and Plumert, 1999). However, one needs to differentiate between disturbed\nrisk taking behavior and normal risky play.\nIt is therefore important to understand that our evolved psychology perceives risk\ndifferently than an objective assessment of statistical risk. What is perceived as risky might\nnot necessarily be risky, while what actually is risky might not be perceived as risky. In\nnormal, evolutionarily relevant situations one may expect that the real risk is relatively\naccurately calculated. Despite parents or younger children being anxious, the maturing\nchild may alter their perception of the risk of specific stimuli. Thus the fact that children\nseem less fearful of typically fear-eliciting stimuli when engaged in risky play, and that the\nrisk seems to be manageable for them (i.e., injuries are rarely serious), suggests that a fear\nmodulating mechanism may be activated in this specific context. We believe this\nmodulating mechanism provides the child with emotions that motivate approach and\ninvestigation, i.e., the thrilling emotions involved in risky play (rather than fear that\nmotivates avoidance and safety behavior).\nPossible Functions of Six Categories of Risky Play\nOur hypothesis in this article is that the child, through play, reduces anxiety of\nsituations that used to be dangerous when the child was younger.\nA study aiming to categorize risky play through observations and interviews of\nchildren and staff in preschool suggested six categories of risky play (Sandseter, 2007a)\nthat were recently confirmed by additional video observations and interviews (Sandseter,\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\n2007b). The emerging categories are described in Table 1.\nTable 1. Categories and subcategories of risky play (revised from Sandseter, 2007a, 2007b)\nCategories Risk Sub-categories\nGreat heights Danger of injury from falling Climbing\nJumping from still or flexible\nsurfaces\nBalancing on high objects\nHanging/swinging at great heights\nHigh speed Uncontrolled speed and pace that can lead\nto collision with something (or someone)\nSwinging at high speed\nSliding and sledging at high speed\nRunning uncontrollably at high speed\nBicycling at high speed\nSkating and skiing at high speed\nDangerous tools Can lead to injuries and wounds Cutting tools: Knives, saws, axes\nStrangling tools: Ropes, etc.\nDangerous elements Where children can fall into or from\nsomething\nCliffs\nDeep water or icy water\nFire pits\nRough-and-tumble Where the children can harm each other Wrestling\nFencing with sticks, etc.\nPlay fighting\nDisappear/get lost Where the children can disappear from\nthe supervision of adults, get lost alone\nGo exploring alone\nPlaying alone in unfamiliar\nenvironments\nThese categories support previous research on children's play in general and risk-\neach type of risky play will be considered separately. Sandseter's (2007a) interviews\nrevealed that some of the categories were perceived risky by both children and staff (great\nheights, high speed and rough-and-tumble play), while others were unanimously perceived\nrisky only by the staff (dangerous tools and dangerous elements), and still others were\nperceived risky only by the children (danger of disappearing/getting lost). This is in accord\nwith the concepts of mismatch (Nesse and Williams, 1995) and hypophobia (Marks and\nNesse, 1994) as previously mentioned. The relative stability of our evolved psychology and\nthe rapid progress of socio-cultural development have led to the fact that not all dangerous\nitems or situations elicit fear or anxiety reactions (Kennair, 2007). In addition the\nperception of what is risky or not may be due to individual genetic differences and\nenvironments (Kendler et al., 2002) as well as experience and habituation (Poulton and\nMenzies, 2002a, 2002b). In the following, the categories of risky play perceived as risky\nand thrilling by the children will be addressed first, followed by the categories perceived as\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nrisky only by the staff (in this sense, caregivers). Each of the categories will be discussed in\nrelation to possible functions and anti-phobic effects.\nPlay with great heights\nThe most frequent form of risky play in great heights is climbing. Children climb on\nall climbable features, such as trees, playground climbers, big rocks, steep slopes, hillsides,\netc. Jumping down from high places, incidents of hanging or dangling from heights and\nbalancing close to drops are also common kinds of play with great heights (Sandseter,\nPossible functions. Benefits of this kind of play may be to get to know ones\necology, exploring the environment (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2002) and practicing and\nenhancing different motor/physical skills for developing muscle strength, endurance,\nskeletal quality, etc. (Bekoff and Byers, 1981; Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2000; Byers and\npractice and training might be relevant for the developing child. Play in great heights also\ninvolves training on perceptual competencies such as depth-, form-, shape-, size-, and\nmovement perception (Rakison, 2005), and general spatial-orientation abilities (Bjorklund\nand Pellegrini, 2002). These are important skills both for survival in childhood (i.e.,\nimmediate benefits) and for handling important adaptive tasks in adulthood (i.e., deferred\nbenefits).\nAlthough not describing in detail the behavior patterns of the play, many\nethnographic studies provide evidence for locomotor play such as chasing, running,\nclimbing, jumping down, sliding, swinging and different forms of acrobatics in a wide\nrange of hunting-and-gathering and agricultural village cultures throughout the world (see,\nFurther strengthening the evolutionary explanation, locomotor play similar to human\nlocomotor play is also found among non-human mammals (e.g., primates, carnivores) and\nan important aspect of this kind of play in both animal and human groups is seeking out\nthrills and slightly fearful situations related to height, speed, daring movements and\nunpredictable outcomes of the play.\nexpect the fear of heights to develop naturally. Contrary to earlier theories claiming that\nfear of heights was due to serious accidents, Poulton et al. (1998) found that children\nsustaining injury due to falls both before age 5 and between ages 5 and 9 did not have a\ngreater frequency of fear of heights at age 11 and height fear and phobia at age 18.\nInterestingly, injurious falls from heights between ages 5 and 9 were associated with the\nabsence of height fear at age 18, thus indicating an opposite direction than that predicted by\nconditioning, and providing strong support of a non-associative theory of fear acquisition in\nthe development of a fear of heights (Poulton et al., 1998). Those who have fear of heights\nat low age usually avoid heights, while those who have a low level of fear of heights are\nmore likely to engage in risky behavior near heights, thus experiencing more serious falls.\nRisky play with great heights will provide a desensitizing or habituating experience and\nmaturationally adequate mastery providing cognitive restructuring. This will result in less\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nfear of heights later in life.\nPlay with high speed\nSwinging with high speed, riding a bike at high speed, running at high and\nuncontrolled speed, or sliding down slides, hills, cliffs, etc. are common forms of this\ncategory of risky play. Sandseter (2007a, 2007b) discovered that children often increased\nthe risk of swinging by standing on the swing, swinging several children together or in\nother challenging ways, or in sliding down snowy slopes by throwing themselves on their\nstomachs head first, backwards, or several children in a row, etc.\nPossible functions. The most obvious evolutionary function of play in high speed is\nthe enhancement of perception \u00ad particularly depth \u00ad and movement perception, but also\nthe perception of size and shape (Rakison, 2005). Another obvious benefit of high speed\nactivities such as swinging and sliding is training on spatial-orientation abilities (Bjorklund\nand Pellegrini, 2002). Also, the more general physical and motor stimulation of play where\nchildren move around running, bicycling, walking up and sliding down hills or slides,\nenhances their physical fitness and motor competence (Bekoff and Byers, 1981; Bjorklund\nThe aforementioned documentation on locomotive play such as chasing, running,\nsliding and swinging found both in different human cultures across the world as well as in\n2005) applies to the evolutionary argument of the function of play with high speed.\nAnti-phobic effect. This kind of play might be motivated by mechanisms that were\nnecessary for our tree-dwelling ancestors to be motivated to swing from tree to tree. The\nresult of this behavior may be a greater chance of falling and hurting oneself, but at the\nsame time the behavior will decrease the chance of developing anxiety of heights and also\nfear of emotional activation in general.\nHigh speed was not a typical part of our hominin ancestors' ecology. There are\ntherefore no obvious hominin adaptations for high speed. Thus it seems more likely to be\nmore archaic or due to by-products of perceptual systems. Still, the anti-phobic effects of\nfeeling the thrill and excitement, as well as associating physiological activation with\npositive experiences and emotions, ought to be assessed in further research.\nRough-and-tumble play\nTypical activities in this category of risky play are fighting, fencing with\nsticks/branches, play wrestling and chasing (Blurton Jones, 1976; Humphreys and Smith,\nPossible functions. Rough-and-tumble play is the most common form of play in\nSmith, 1982), and it is also found, not only in Western industrialized cultures, but in a wide\nrange of other cultures such as hunting-and-gathering and agricultural village cultures all\nResearch on rough-and-tumble play in both animals (e.g., primates, carnivores) and\nhumans have also found that males engage more in play-fighting than females (Aldis, 1975;\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nroughness in the play seems to increase with age (Power, 2000). The findings that rough-\nand-tumble play such as play-fighting is common across cultures and animals similar to\nhumans support the suggestion that this kind of play is a result of an evolutionary adaptive\nprocess.\nRough-and-tumble play involves great physical and motor stimulation, and the\nfunctions, both deferred and immediate, of physical training through play activities is\naddressed above. Another possible immediate function of rough-and-tumble play is to\nenhance complex social competences such as affiliation with peers, social signaling, good\nmanaging and dominance skills within the peer group, bargaining, manipulating and\nredefining situations (Flinn and Ward, 2005; Humphreys and Smith, 1987; Pellegrini and\ntumble play also serves deferred benefits by enhancing survival and reproduction,\nparticularly for boys \u00ad who most often engage in this kind of play, of gaining competence\nin aggression, fighting, social competition and experience in dominant and subordinate\nroles. These are social competencies that are useful for adult life and evolved strategies for\nenhancing survival, as males have had to face competition, dangers and physical challenges\nas hunters (Jarvis, 2006). For kindergarten children there rarely is an aim to hurt the other\nand both parts partake in this as a playful activity (Humphreys and Smith, 1987). Still,\nresearch suggests that rough-and-tumble play in preschool- and primary school-aged\nchildren provides practice and hones skills for regulating aggressive behavior (Dodge,\nCoie, Pettit, and Price, 1990). Studies of peer perception found that non-aggressive\ncooperative children were liked by peers and that bullies were disliked by peers (Boulton\nboys may continue into adolescence (Broidy et al., 2003; Scholte, Engels, Overbeek,\nKemp, and Haselager, 2007). Not being able to regulate aggression and real hostile\nbehavior in rough play situations is therefore disadvantageous for the social development of\na child.\nIt is worth noting that dominance in rough-and-tumble play becomes even more\nobvious as one enters adolescence (Humphreys and Smith, 1987; Smith, 1997). As the\nboys, as is most often the case, move toward puberty the roughhousing becomes more\ncompetitive and the weaker fighter will be dominated by the stronger fighter. The\nroughhousing thus changes character and function and becomes more a hierarchy building\nactivity.\nRough-and-tumble play thus seems to have important functions, both immediate\nand deferred, for motor practice, social skills practice, aggression regulation and physical\nhealth.\nAnti-phobic effect. The anti-phobic effect of rough-and-tumble play is not very\nevident, and there is a lack of research looking into this issue. It might be that this is not a\nrelevant function of this kind of play. Still, a couple of researchers have outlined the\npossibility that rough-and-tumble play, particularly the kinds where the participants aim to\nscare each other by taking the role as monsters or other scary creatures, the kinds where\nwar-play is the essential focus, and the kinds including unpredictable and sudden\nmovements and high sounds, can be a form of play-fear reinforcement that can reduce\nanxiety by habituation in a pretend situation (Aldis, 1975; Power, 2000). One might\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nspeculate that social phobia and other forms of anxiety involving social hierarchy, physical\ncloseness and social evaluation (i.e., fear of people) might be reduced due to a\nnormalization of the intimacy and self-assertion involved in normal rough-and-tumble play.\nOrganized rough and tumble play, such as Judo practice, has been researched and some\nfindings suggest that children become less aggressive, less emotionally disturbed and less\nanxious through such practice (Gleser and Lison, 1992; Lamarre and Nosanchuck, 1999).\nPlay where the children can \"disappear\" / get lost\nBoth Sandseter (2007a) and Davidsson (2006) have found that children love to walk\noff alone and go exploring away from the eyes of adults. Children experience a feeling of\nrisk and danger of getting lost on occasions where they are given the opportunity to\n\"cruise\" on their own exploring unknown areas; still, they have an urge to do it (Sandseter,\nPossible functions. The urge to walk off alone in new and undiscovered\nenvironments without supervision from adults is children's way of exploring their world\nand becoming at home in it (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2002; Smith, 1998). Research has\nshown that exploration is an important part of children's play (Davidsson, 2006; Kaarby,\nengage more than girls in exploration, and also explore larger areas than girls, is related to\nwhat Bowlby called the environment of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA) where males were\nhunters and had to be able to safely move around in diverse and large areas away from\nhome. This is in accordance with the research of Silove, Manicavasagar, O'Connell and\nMorris-Yates (1995) arguing that a lower level of separation anxiety among boys than girls\nis due to the adaptive pressure for boys to learn hunting skills and the courage to venture\nfar from the home, and opposite for girls to learn skills for nurturing and creating safe\nenvironments for child-rearing. Enhancing perceptual competencies such as depth-, form-,\nshape-, size-, and movement perception is also a natural function of children's exploration\nStudying animal and human play, Aldis (1975) makes a distinction between serious\nexploration where the human/animal learns about their environment, and play which is just\nplayful activity. Aldis describes serious exploration with the example of a young rhesus\nmonkey that first independently leaves its mother to explore the immediate proximity, and\nat the first sign of danger will flee back to her. Then, over a period of time, the young\nrhesus monkey will gradually fan out from \"home base\" to explore more distant areas.\nAldis argues that through serious exploration, rather than play, animals learn what features\nof the environment lead to food, which lead to danger, and so on. Still, Aldis admits that it\nis difficult to differentiate between serious exploration and play, and that often a new and\nunknown environment or object is approached by serious exploration in the beginning and\nthen gradually explored further through play. In our opinion exploration performed in a\nplay \"atmosphere,\" such as pretend play, is a kind of exploratory play, teaching the players\nabout their environment though play situations.\nAnti-phobic effect. The fear of separation from caretakers is common in humans\n(Buss, 2004) \u00ad particularly for the female part of the human population (Silove et al.,\n1995).The urge among children for going exploring on their own is puzzling in this view.\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nIn our hominin ancestors' past, getting lost probably was a real danger, highlighting the\nadaptive function of initial separation anxiety in young children. Are these children less\nanxious than would have been adaptive for them in the past? In most western societies\nchildren sleep alone, which is both culturally and evolutionarily a novel situation. One\nmight speculate that this may create a larger degree of individuality and also a hypophobia\nof being alone. In any case, as the child matures, independence and investigation of the\nsurroundings is necessary \u00ad also in order to find food to feed themselves.\nIs separation anxiety an evolved non-associative fear that can benefit from\ndesensitization/habituating behavior? A study by Poulton et al. (2001) revealed that\nseparation anxiety was largely independent of associative factors, strongly supporting a\nnon-associative explanation. Interestingly the results showed that the amount of separation\nexperiences before age nine correlated negatively with the separation anxiety symptoms at\nage 18, suggesting an \"inoculation\" effect of early separation events. The results also\nindicated that planned separations can help children to learn not to fear separations. These\nresults support the assumption of children's voluntary separation from caretakers, by\nwandering off alone, as a mode of anti-phobic behavior. As in the case of anti-phobic\neffects of play in great heights (Poulton et al., 1998), one could expect that children with\nless fear of separation would be more willing to expose themselves to separation events\nthan children with a high fear of separation. Even so, when having the opportunity to\nvoluntarily plan and carry out a separation from their caretakers by exploring new and\nunknown areas, experiencing the thrill of the risk of being lost, children seem to\n\"inoculate\" themselves from the anxiety of separation.\nPlay with dangerous tools\nPlay with tools that are potentially dangerous included behaviors such as using a\nknife for whittling, a saw for cutting down branches, a hammer and nails for carpentering,\nand an axe for chopping wood (Sandseter, 2007a, 2007b). This is one of the categories that\nare risky from an adult point of view, while the children are more disposed to feel this is\nonly an exciting activity (Sandseter, 2007a). It is also worth noting that this behavior was\nmuch more typical among children, and not considered risky by adults only one or two\ngenerations ago.\nPossible functions. Play with dangerous tools can be regarded as a kind of object\nplay. The central point of object play is manipulation of objects in different ways, such as\nhitting and throwing them (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2002; Pellegrini and Bjorklund,\n2004). Pellegrini and Bjorklund (2004) argue that the large amount of time children spend\nin play and manipulation of objects is an indication of the importance and adaptive\nrelevance this has for competencies both in childhood and later in life. Also supporting the\nadaptive function, play with objects has been described in a wide variety of human cultures\nthroughout the world (Gosso et al., 2005; Smith, 2005). Object play is also observed in\nnon-human mammals and great apes (Bruner, 1976; Pellegrini and Bjorklund, 2004; Power,\nsome kinds of carnivores and to some extent among primates, although primates tend to be\nmore engaged in serious exploration and manipulation of objects. Still, Aldis' results show\nthat the serious exploration of objects often turned into play with objects when the primates\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nwere more familiar with the new object.\nPlay with objects is beneficial for individuals to learn properties of objects and their\nfunctions, and seems to be valuable in emergent tool use (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2002).\nThe fact that boys are more likely than girls to engage in object oriented play, and they do\nobject play more vigorously and physically while girls seem to engage in more solitary\nmanipulation of objects, suggests that this provides deferred benefits of important skill\nacquisition for the adult human where males would have to prepare for hunting and women\nAnti-phobic effect. Some forms of hypophobia (Marks and Nesse, 1994) will be due\nto a mismatch between our ancestors' environment that we are adapted to (Nesse and\nWilliams, 1995; Tooby and Cosmides, 1990) and the current environment. Many dangerous\ntools never existed in the past and we did not evolve natural fears of them. Even though\ntools such as knives and axes existed in earlier phases of human evolution (although less\nsharp), object play (including playing with dangerous tools) more likely is motivated by an\ninterest in tools and acquisition of tool handling skills than by anti-phobic effects. Future\nresearch into the differences between play involving modern tools and role-playing adult\nskill behavior might shed light into the different motivational mechanisms.\nPlay near dangerous elements\nPlay near dangerous elements in Sandseter's (2007a, 2007b) study included play on\ntop of high and steep cliffs, play near deep water by the seaside and tumultuous play near a\nburning fire pit. Like in the case of play with dangerous tools, this is a category that\nprimarily is regarded risky from an adult point of view, while some of the children thought\nthis was scary and others did not (Sandseter, 2007a).\nPossible functions. Similar to some of the other categories of risky play, one can\nassume that this kind of play serves a function of exploring the environment and becoming\nfamiliar with its possibilities and constraints. Still, research shows that some of the children\nare not very attentive to the fact that they are playing near a dangerous element, but rather\nare preoccupied in their activity, such as role play, play chasing and the like (Sandseter,\n2007b). The potential hazard is thus not always perceived by the children (Sandseter,\n2007a). The function of playing near dangerous elements may therefore be an indirect\nfunction, the dangerous element not being the essential part of the play itself, still having an\neffect on how children learn to handle different environmental features and elements such\nas water, steep and high cliffs, and fire. Children have been playing close to dangerous\necological features throughout our species' evolutionary history \u00ad so one would assume\nthat there has been selection to improve children's ability to be aware of real risks.\nAnti-phobic effect. If one assumes that fear of potentially dangerous elements,\nsimilar to fear of height (Poulton et al., 1998), are non-associative evolutionarily-relevant\nfears that arise naturally in young humans, the hypothesis of habituation through exposure\nto the stimuli and the falsification of exaggerated belief of hazards through behavioral\nexperiments would be reasonable also for fear of high and steep cliffs, water and fire. It is\npossible that the children who were not afraid of dangerous elements in Sandseter's (2007a,\n2007b) studies have had more anxiety reducing experiences than the ones that thought that\nplaying near dangerous elements was scary. We addressed the anti-phobic effect of\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nexperiencing injurious falls through exposing oneself to great heights above (Poulton et al.,\n1998). A study carried through by Poulton et al. (1999) found similar results on fear of\nwater. This study concluded that there was no relationship between water confidence and\nexperiencing water trauma before age nine and the symptoms of water fear at age 18. The\nauthors conclude (see also Poulton and Menzies, 2002a; Poulton and Menzies, 2002b) that\ntheir studies support a non-associative perspective arguing that the fear of water arises due\nto innate reasons. Thus, anxiety is due to maturation, rather than associative learning of\nanxiety (Rachman, 1977). Further, Poulton et al. (1999) conclude that anxiety is reduced\nover time with repeated exposure to the stimuli. Thus, play behavior near dangerous\nelements such as high cliffs, water and fire may be natural, anti-phobic behavior, while\npreventing this behavior may increase the risk of phobias and a lack of normal coping\nbehavior in heights, water or close to fire.\nSurvival Tasks, Functions and Sex-Differences\nOne would assume that all children would gain from enhancing physical, social and\nperceptual skills and being familiar and comfortable in their surrounding environment, as\nwell as acquiring good risk management skills and anti-phobic effects of stimulation. Still,\nresearch concludes on boys being far more represented than girls in the willingness to take\nrisks and engage in risky play (Cairns and Cairns, 1994; Ginsburg and Miller, 1982;\nphysical play and rough-and-tumble play (Blurton Jones, 1976; DiPietro, 1981; Eaton and\nindicate that boys have a higher injury liability than girls (Boles, Roberts, Brown, and\nCan this sex-difference be accounted for in an evolutionary perspective? Several authors\nPellegrini and Bjorklund, 2004; Smith, 1982) state that the documented sex-differences in\nplay styles is consistent with the adaptive problems males and females have had to\nencounter. Men have had to prove themselves as a strong, safe, protective and worthy\npartner for the females with whom he wanted to produce offspring (Ellis, 1992). This\nwould, in the past, imply the willingness to take great risks (Kruger and Nesse, 2004;\nWilson and Daly, 1985). This includes both travelling away from the home base for\nhunting and fighting wild animals, and protecting the partner and offspring from enemies\nand other \"hostile forces of nature.\" Women, on the other hand, would have to be more\ncautious to survive and secure reproductive success, and then serve as the primary\ncaregivers for their children staying at the home base performing gathering tasks. Sex-\ndifferences in the urge for risky play could possibly be viewed as an adaptation to enhance\ncompetencies important for survival in the history of evolution. Differences in fearfulness\nor anxiety, and the need to reduce both fear and anxiety more in males, may be part of this\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nGeneral Discussion\nAnxiety etiology has been based on, e.g., Mowrer's two-factor theory \u00ad including\nboth classical and operant conditioning (see also Rachman, 1977, for a conditioning\napproach). This is no longer considered a likely explanation. At least the associative\npathways might need to be expanded with non-associative models (Poulton and Menzies,\n2002a). The isomorphic principle of how pathogenesis and cure need to be similar\nprocesses has been typical within much psychotherapeutic theory \u00ad since the effective\ntreatment of anxiety has been learning theory-based, many have expected conditioning to\nbe the etiology of anxiety. At the same time researchers such as Poulton and Menzies\nsuggests that anxiety appears through largely maturational or dispositional mechanisms. On\nthe other hand, anxiety reduction seems to be due to coping and interaction with the\nnaturally fear-generating stimulus. The naturally developed fear seems to be alleviated\nthrough normal habituation or coping experiences, somehow. We suggest that risky play\nprovides the exact conditions that will be most curative of any anxiety, the exaggerated fear\nreactions to stimulus or situations that the child in reality is able to master. These are: the\nmotivation to seek out the stimulus (exposure/experience) and to learn how to master the\nstimuli while being motivated by a positive (thrilling) rather than aversive emotion\nresulting in coping/mastery experiences. Note that thrill reduction occurs after a period of\ncareful but thrill motivated negotiation of the threatening condition and the learning and\nmastery of the necessary skills involved. In other words, the child starts off with a natural\ninhibition toward situations that the child developmentally is not mature enough to cope\nwith, but this fear is reduced as the child develops mental and physical skills and exposes\nitself to the stimulus motivated by thrilling emotions, while learning how to master these\nchallenges.\nChildren do not consciously consider the immediate or deferred benefits of their\nplay while playing or while deciding what to play. Enjoyment or thrill of play is basically\nthe motivational basis for play among children (Smith, 1982), and children engage in risky\nthere is no contradiction between assuming that a child's personal reason for play is an\nintrinsic motivation to experience positive emotional stages such as arousal, excitement,\nfun, merriment, joy, ecstatic feelings, mastery and competence, and assuming that the\neffects of such play are useful for other kinds of adaptations such as enhancing survival and\nthe child's fitness. This corresponds to hominins procreating through history, not primarily\ndue to the conscious desire to have offspring, but due to sexual drives and the pleasures of\nsex.\nStill, several important questions remain unanswered: It is important not to\nprematurely conclude that risky play is due to specific adaptations or plays an adaptive role\nin normal development. Other explanations are possible: Are the motivational and\nperceptual mental systems that make children experience this form of stimulation activating\nand thrilling by-products (Gould and Lewontin, 1979; see also Buss, Haselton,\nShackelford, Bleske, and Wakefield, 1998; Kennair, 2002) of our mental mechanisms? Or\nmight they be remnants of systems that, e.g., made our tree dwelling ancestors feel\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nmotivated to climb and jump from branch to branch? Would this have consequences? And\nis it still a system that needs stimulating in order to ensure normal development?\nFew deprivation studies have been conducted to try to reveal the developmental\nimportance of different kinds of play. This has been more common in animal play literature\n(Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2002). Still, some studies of the effects of depriving children of\nlocomotor play have occurred. The results from these studies were consistent in showing\nthat deprivation led to increased levels of locomotor play when the opportunities for this\nkind of play were re-established (Byers and Walker, 1995; Pellegrini and Davis, 1993;\nPellegrini, Huberty, and Jones, 1995). Further research would be necessary to consider the\neffects of preventing risky play. If this indeed resulted in an increased tendency toward\nfearfulness or neuroticism this would provide further evidence of the fear reducing effect of\nrisky play.\nWe have been informed by a modular approach, and posited specific mechanisms\nfor specific types of risky play. One might object that a more domain general approach\nmight also be possible to explain such behavior. We do believe that heights, speed and play\nnear dangerous elements probably use many of the same mechanisms, and although there\nprobably are different mechanisms involved in rough and tumble play, probably there also\nare common processes such as the thrilling emotion. We do posit at that level that this\nprocess is rather general. Also there may be evolved individual differences (see Buss and\nHawley, 2011) that regulate this process at a general level, such as poor self-regulation and\ninhibitory abilities that both reflect general universal development of the prefrontal cortex\nas well as individual differences, as well as meta-cognitive processes involved in the\noverestimation of abilities to manage risky situations.\nConclusions\nThis article suggests that one of the most important aspects of risky play may be the\nanti-phobic effect of exposure to typical fear eliciting stimuli and contexts, in the\ncombination of positive emotion and relative safety and with autonomous coping behavior.\nAs such risky play mirrors effective cognitive behavioral therapy of anxiety (Allen and\nRapee, 2005). Current research on the etiology of anxiety suggests that anxieties develop\ndue to both genetic and environmental factors (Allen and Rapee, 2005). The specific genes\nhave not been identified, but neither are we aware of what environmental factors cause\nanxiety disorders (e.g. Kendler et al., 2002). It seems that the genetic factors cause\nindividual differences, and apart from the phobias most anxiety disorders do not seem\nfunctional from an evolutionary perspective (Kennair, 2007). The evidence that phobias\nseem to develop rather independently of learning experiences (these have at least been\ndifficult to document to date), does not mean that learning may not be a way of reducing or\neven curing anxiety. Actually graded exposure and learning to think less negative and more\nmastery oriented thoughts about the anxiety producing stimuli have shown to be the most\neffective treatment of child anxieties (Allen and Rapee, 2005). It is possible that risky play\nis a natural way of reducing many phobic reactions that are functional when the child has a\nlow level of mastery of the fear provoking conditions. Thus adaptive fear, necessary to\nkeep the child safe and alert and careful when learning to cope with potentially dangerous\nChildren's risky play from an evolutionary perspective\nsituations for young children, is countered by the positive emotions that are typical of the\nadaptively thrilling experience involved in moving the boundaries of what is safe and what\nis dangerous. Research has shown that anxious children may elicit overprotective behavior\nfrom others, such as parents and caretakers, and that this reinforces the child's perception\nof threat and decreases their perception of controlling the danger (Allen and Rapee, 2005).\nOverprotection might thus result in exaggerated levels of anxiety. Overprotection through\ngovernmental control of playgrounds and exaggerated fear of playground accidents might\nthus result in an increase of anxiety in society. We might need to provide more stimulating\nenvironments for children, rather than hamper their development.\nThis means that some forms of risky play may be developmentally adequate\nspecies-specific and universal anti-phobic processes. For other types of risky play, the\nmotivational systems may be more archaic systems or they may be due to by-products of\nour perceptual systems that provide a mixed activation that the children perceive as\nthrilling and hedonic. The different analyses of function give different testable hypotheses\nof the psychological mechanisms and motivational systems involved in the different types\nof play. From a modular approach one would not expect to find the same mechanisms\ninvolved in all different types of behavior.\nIf these ideas are correct, this might not only be about prevention or increasing\nanxiety at the population level, but also relevant for the improvement of treatment of young\nchildren with anxiety. Treatment might profit from having more than merely a habituation\nperspective; relaxation (e.g., \u00d6st, 1987) may counter anxiety, but it may be more important\n\u00ad at least for many young patients \u00ad to experience more thrilling and coping emotions. A\ntreatment program for young patients that uses thrilling emotions to cure anxiety and\ncompares it to current best practice cognitive behavioral treatment protocols would test this\ndirectly.\nFurther research into risky play is necessary. Risky behavior is a potential health\nhazard. At the same time, an understanding of why and when children will engage in risky\nbehavior is important \u00ad not least if such behavior in the long run is beneficial to their\nnormal development. It seems that risky behavior is maintained despite adults' attempts at\nmaking children's environments safer. From both a safety perspective as well as from a\nnormal psychological developmental perspective an understanding of the function of risky\nplay and the different psychological mechanisms and motivational systems involved are\nimportant to understand. This will be essential in the world wide discussion on demands for\nchildren's play safety, by a growing number of researchers regarded as drawing near\noverprotection, and the balance between such safety requirements and children's needs for\nopportunities to play freely in challenging, stimulating and developing environments. Even\nthough highly active and risk taking children experience more (albeit minor) injuries, this\narticle suggests that these children will benefit psychologically from natural adaptive fear\nalleviation and the anti-phobic effect of risky play.\n"
