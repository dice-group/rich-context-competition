Multiple regression\nanalysis was conducted on self-report data (based on a telephone interview) from a probability-based sample of US women aged 25\u00ad45\nyears. We compare women with infertility who have had a prior pregnancy (secondary infertility, n \u00bc 628) to women with infertility with\nno prior pregnancies (primary infertility, n \u00bc 399). We further distinguish between women with infertility who were actually `trying' to\nbecome pregnant (the infertile with intent) with those who met the medical definition of infertile but did not describe themselves as\ntrying to become pregnant (infertile without intent).\nresults: Both types of infertility (primary versus secondary) (b \u00bc 0.31*) and intentionality (infertile with and without intent) (b \u00bc 0.08*)\nare associated with FSD. These associations persist when we control for resource and demographic variables, life course variables, social\nsupport and social pressure variables. General distress does not vary by infertility type or intentionality.\nconclusions: Results reveal variation in women's recalled experiences of infertility and that FSD is more sensitive to effects of different\nexperiences than general distress. Women with primary infertility who were explicitly trying to become pregnant at the time of the infertility\nepisode stand out as a particularly distressed group. Caregivers should be aware that the emotional needs of women with primary infertility\nmay differ from those with secondary infertility.\nKey words: fertility-specific distress / infertility / pregnancy intentionality / population-based study / women\nIntroduction\nAlthough there are many studies of psychological distress among\nwomen with infertility (for reviews see Henning and Strauss, 2002;\nGreil et al., 2010), only a handful of studies have examined the\nrelationship between infertility and psychological distress among\nwomen who have not sought medical help for infertility. Furthermore,\nmany studies have treated women with infertility as a monolithic\ngroup, thus missing important distinctions among women with differ-\nent types of infertility (primary or secondary) or degree of `intention-\nality' at the time of the infertility episode (trying, or open to\nconception). We examine variations in fertility-specific distress (FSD)\nand general distress (CESD) by type of infertility in a nation-wide\nat least one episode of infertility within the past 10 years. We compare\nwomen with infertility who have had a prior pregnancy (secondary\ninfertility) to women with infertility with no prior pregnancies\n(primary infertility). In addition, we compare women who were actu-\nally `trying' to become pregnant at the time of their infertility episode\n(the infertile with intent) with those who met the medical definition of\ninfertility but were not explicitly trying to become pregnant (the infer-\ntile without intent). Because characteristics such as race, income,\naccess to private health insurance, importance of motherhood and\ntreatment-seeking differ by type of infertility, we explore whether con-\ntrolling for various characteristics explains the associations between\ntype of infertility, intentionality and distress. In addition, we assess\n An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 2010 annual meeting of the Population Association of America in Washington, DC.\n& The Author 2011.

Using this definition, the National Survey of Family Growth esti-\nmates that 7.4% of married US women were currently infertile in 2002\n(Chandra and Stephen, 2006). Tests of the hypothesis that infertility is a\nsource of psychological distress have typically used standardized\nmeasures normed on the general population to see if the infertile\nscore is different than the population at large or if they have higher\nscores than women in a non-infertile comparison group. Most studies\nemploying standardized measures of general psychological distress\nhave found that women with infertility score as more distressed than\npersons with no reported fertility problems on at least some subscales,\nbut less distressed than those with clinical mental illnesses (Greil, 1997;\nDrawing conclusions from research on infertility and distress is\nmade more difficult by several methodological limitations in prior\nstudies. First, women with infertility who serve as subjects for much\nresearch on infertility and psychological distress do not always rep-\nresent the full range of women who meet the criteria for infertility.\nUntil recently, most studies on the psychosocial consequences of\ninfertility were limited to clinic-based samples of women-seeking treat-\nment. In the USA, it is estimated that only half of couples with inferti-\nlity seek treatment (Chandra and Stephen, 2010). Therefore studies\nbased on clinic samples capture the experiences of only one-half of\nwomen with infertility. Because non-treatment seekers differ substan-\ntially from treatment seekers on race, socioeconomic status and other\ncharacteristics, this is a potentially serious omission (Greil et al., 2010).\nIn addition, the use of clinic samples confounds the consequences of\ntreatment seeking, treatment itself and fertility status. Evidence\nsuggests that the common characterization of infertile woman as\ntotally immersed in the process of trying to become pregnant\ndescribes only treatment seekers, and does not reflect the broader\nexperience of non-treatment seekers (Greil and McQuillan, 2004).\nFertility-specific distress\nA second reason for concern about findings regarding the psychologi-\ncal sequelae of infertility is the types of measures used to capture\npsychological distress. Conventional general measures of distress are\nunlikely to be sufficiently sensitive or specific to the problems of infer-\ntility to adequately reflect the experience of many women (Jacob et al.,\nhave strong correlations with standardized measures of distress, indi-\ncating the face validity of fertility-specific measures (Ulbrich et al.,\nnot permit comparison with control groups or population norms.\nThus, these measures are most useful for comparisons among\nwomen and couples with infertility.\nA third reason for concerns about findings in studies of the psycho-\nlogical consequences of infertility among women is the heterogeneity\namong women with infertility. For example, Wischmann et al. (2001)\nfound that most women and couples with infertility do not have\npsychopathology, but there are some who need psychological help.\nMuch of the research on variation in distress among women with\ninfertility has focused on differences in coping strategies and other\n2010). Much less research has looked at differences by type of inferti-\nlity or demographic, situational and attitudinal correlates of infertility\ndistress.\nVariables influencing distress among women\nwith infertility\nAmong women with infertility, several characteristics are associated\nwith differing levels of distress. FSD measures are particularly\nwell-suited for assessing variation among women with infertility,\nalthough few measures of FSD have been utilized for this purpose.\nGreil and McQuillan (2004) have divided women with infertility into\nthe `infertile with intent' (women who say they tried to conceive for\nat least 12 months without conception) and the `infertile without\nintent' (women who report having had unprotected intercourse\nwithout conception but who do not say that they were explicitly\ntrying to conceive at the time) and have found these two groups to\nbe different in striking ways. It is important to point out that this\n`intent' measure is not a measure of the general desire for a child\nbut rather a measure of planfulness. Many women in the USA say\nthat they are neither planning to become pregnant or planning not\nto become pregnant but rather are `okay either way' (McQuillan\net al., 2010). Many of these women may welcome a pregnancy\nwhen it occurs and many may become concerned about their fertility\nshould they fail to become pregnant over time. Intentionality with\nregard either to a particular pregnancy or pregnancy in general and\nwanting a(nother) child are two conceptually separate variables, and\nthe nature of their relationship to one another is an empirical question.\nAlthough infertile women without intent are less likely to pursue treat-\nment (Greil et al., 2009), some of them do seek treatment. Women\nwho are infertile with intent do not differ from the infertile without\nintent with regard to general distress, but they do score significantly\nhigher on FSD (Greil and McQuillan, 2010).\nMany people associate infertility with involuntary childlessness, but\nevidence suggests that the incidence of secondary infertility--`infertility\nis actually somewhat higher than the incidence of primary infertility\n(Chandra and Stephen, 2010). Older studies utilizing standardized\nmeasures of anxiety and stress have not found differences between\nlevels of distress among women with primary as opposed to second-\nbut newer studies have found that women with primary infertility\nexhibit higher levels of distress than women with secondary infertility\nOlder studies show that distress specific to infertility is higher\namong women with primary rather than secondary infertility\naccount for the many characteristics that may be associated with\ngeneral and FSD among women with infertility, we control for a\nnumber of characteristics in addition to the focal associations\nbetween type of infertility (primary or secondary) and intentionality\nwith regard to getting pregnant.\nStatement of the problem\nWe focus on two intersecting characteristics of infertility episodes to\nbetter understand the variance in distress levels among women\nmeeting the medical criteria for infertility, controlling for potentially\nconfounding characteristics. The National Survey of Fertility Barriers\n(NSFB) provides a way to assess several correlates of FSD and\ngeneral distress among a random sample of US women of reproduc-\ntive age. We therefore use these data to evaluate the following\nhypotheses about distress among women meeting the medical criteria\nfor infertility:\n(i) Intentionality should be associated with FSD. The infertile with\nintent should have higher levels of FSD than the infertile\nwithout intent even after other variables--including wanting a\nchild--are controlled. This relationship should persist when the\nsample is restricted only to women who have received\ntreatment.\n(ii) Type of infertility should be associated with FSD. Women who\nhave not had a pregnancy (i.e. the primary infertile) should\nexhibit higher FSD scores than women who have been pregnant\n(i.e. the secondary infertile) even after other variables are con-\ntrolled. This relationship should persist when the sample is\nrestricted only to women who have received treatment.\n(iii) General distress should be less sensitive to variations in the\nexperience of infertility. General distress should be unrelated to\neither intentionality or type of infertility.\n(iv) Age should be associated with FSD. Older women should be\nmore distressed than younger women.\n(v) Such fertility-related variables as family support and pressure,\nimportance of motherhood, and wanting more children should\nbe associated with FSD.\n(vi) General distress should be less sensitive to fertility-related vari-\nables and more related to demographic variables that are associ-\nated with general distress in general samples.\nMaterials and Methods\nSetting\nThis study was conducted in the USA, an economically and racially diverse\ncountry where costs for infertility are particularly high, where there is no\nuniversal health care, and where most states do not mandate that the\ncosts of infertility treatment be covered by insurance (Chambers et al.,\nSubjects\nyears in the USA. Some of their partners were also included but are not\npart of this analysis. This Random Digit Dialing (RDD) sample consists of a\nnationally representative sample, plus an over-sample of Census central\noffice codes with a high-minority population to ensure sufficient numbers of\nwomen for subgroup analyses. Our sample design included a prenotification\nletter with a $1 or $2 cash incentive for all telephone numbers with address\nmatches. The incentive was changed from $2 to $1 following an experimental\ncomparison built into a random sample segment that found little difference in\nresponse rate between the two amounts. Interviewing was conducted by the\nSurvey ResearchCenterat the Pennsylvania StateUniversityandthe Bureau of\nSociological Research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The same\ninterviewer training material and interviewer guides were used at both sites.\nMethodological information, including the methodology report, introductory\nletters, interview schedules, interviewer guides, data imputation procedures\nand a detailed description of the planned missing design can be accessed at:\nhttp://sodapop.pop.psu.edu/codebooks/nsfb/wave1/. The public-access\ndata files can be accessed at: http://sodapop.pop.psu.edu/\ndata-collections/nsfb. Screening questions were used to create additional\noversamples of women who had had an infertility episode, who had never\ngiven birth, who had miscarried in the past, and/or who would like to have\na baby in the future, and the study only selected 10% of women who reported\nhaving completed child bearing (the comparison group). We weight the data\ntoaccountforthedisproportionateprobabilitythatwomeninminoritygroups\nand/or women with past or potential fertility barriers were included in the\nsample. Interviews were designed to take 35 min and included detailed\nreproductive histories, demographic measures and attitudinal measures. A\n`planned missing' design was used to provide a way to incorporate more indi-\ncators of key concepts while minimizing respondent burden and keeping the\ninterview relatively short. The estimated response rate for the sample is\n53.0% for the screener,which istypicalfor RDD telephonesurveys conducted\nin recent years (McCarty et al., 2006). Extensive comparisons with Census\ndata indicate our weighted sample is representative of women aged 25\u00ad45\nyears in the USA.\nThe sample for the present analysis consists of 1027 women who\nreported an episode of infertility in the 10 years prior to the interview.\nAn `episode' of infertility is, for the purposes of this analysis, any period\nof 12 months or greater during which a women had regular intercourse\nand was either trying to conceive or `okay either way' about conception\nbut did not conceive. Women were considered to have had an episode\nof infertility if they answered yes to either of the following questions: (i)\n`Was there ever a time when you were trying to get pregnant but did\nnot conceive within 12 months?' or (ii) `Was there ever a time when\nyou regularly had sex without using birth control for a year or more\nwithout getting pregnant?' Only women who were not breastfeeding\nwere included. Of the women who reported an episode of infertility,\n59.4% had a subsequent live birth. In analyses not shown here, we\ndetermined that eliminating women who had a live birth after infertility\ndid not change the pattern of results, so we include them in the analysis\npresented here.\nMeasures\nFertility-specific distress\nOne dependent variable in this study is FSD. A number of fertility-specific\nmeasures have been developed (See especially Keye et al., 1984; Abbey\nstatus of a standard measure. The measures of Newton et al. (1999)\nand Schmidt (2006) have been used in several studies (see e.g. Benyamini\nsituations. A new measure, the Fertility Quality of Life Questionnaire (Fer-\ntiQoL), has recently been developed by Boivin et al. (2010) and tested for\nvalidity and reliability (Verhaak et al., 2010). This measure may well\nbecome a generally accepted measure of fertility distress, but it has not\nyet been used in many studies and was not available when we conducted\nour research. In addition, it was important for the purposes of the larger\nstudy to phrase questions in language general enough to apply to other fer-\ntility barriers in addition to infertility (such as pregnancy loss and situational\nfertility barriers). Finally, it was necessary to construct a short measure in\norder to ease respondent burden and allow time to ask all of the other\nquestions included in the survey. Thus, rather than use the longer scales\nthat have already been developed [e.g. 46-item scale proposed by\nVariation in distress among women with infertility 2103\nNewton et al. (1999)], the NSFB team created a 6-item scale comprised of\nquestions that draw on the Hjelmstedt et al.'s (1999) Infertility Reaction\nScale, qualitative research on infertile couples (e.g. Greil, 1991) and the\nclinical experience of members of the research team.\nRespondents who reported having tried unsuccessfully to become preg-\nnant for a period of at least 12 months were read the statement: `You\ntried for quite a while to get pregnant. Please tell me whether you had\nthese reactions when you didn't get pregnant'. Women who had a\nperiod of at least 12 months of regular intercourse but who did not say\nthat they were trying to become pregnant were read the statement:\n`You had several months of sex without using birth control without\ngetting pregnant. Please tell me whether you had these reactions when\nyou didn't get pregnant'. Both groups of women were then presented\nwith a series of items and asked whether they felt this way frequently,\noccasionally, seldom or never. The items were: I felt cheated by life; I\nfelt that I was being punished; I felt angry at God; I felt inadequate; I felt\nseriously depressed about it; I felt like a failure as a woman. The scale\nwas computed using the mean of available items, such that it ranges\nfrom 0 to 1. Because of the planned missing design, each respondent\nreceived two thirds of the items chosen at random. Almost all (96.7%)\nresponded to all items with which they were presented. Two of the\nitems, `I felt I was being punished' and `I felt angry at God', have religious\novertones; to ascertain whether religiosity may have influenced FSD scores\nwe conducted independent samples t-tests on these items and found that\nneither item was significantly associated with religiosity. In addition, the\ncorrelation between the FSD scale and religiosity is 0.025 and is not signifi-\ncant. Higher scores indicate greater distress. This scale has an a of 0.830\nfor the sample used in this analysis.\nGeneral distress (CESD-10)\nThe other dependent variable used in this study is general distress.\nGeneral distress is measured by the CESD-10 (Andresen et al., 1994), a\nshorter version of the well known 20-item Center for Epidemiological\nStudies Distress Scale (CES-D) (Radloff, 1977). The CES-D is not a diag-\nnostic instrument but was specifically developed for use in community\nsurveys. It is easy to administer, has been translated into Spanish, has\nexcellent measurement properties (a \u00bc 0.860 for this sample), and is\nappropriate for a study in which explanation, and not treatment, is the\ncentral focus (Hann et al., 1999). The CES-D does not distinguish well\nbetween depressive and anxious conditions and may over-identify\nThe CESD-10 has been shown to have adequate reliability and validity\nand to be equivalent to the longer version in predictive accuracy\nInfertility type\nThe two focal independent variables are infertility type and intentionality\nwith regard to pregnancy. Infertile respondents were classified as belong-\ning to one of two groups based on whether or not they had experienced\nprior pregnancies. The primary infertility group includes 399 (38.9%)\nrespondents who experienced a period of infertility before they had\nexperienced any pregnancies. The secondary infertility group consists of\n628 (61.1%) respondents who were pregnant at least once prior to an\ninfertility episode. The medical definition of primary infertility is infertility\nwith no prior pregnancies, but some researchers (e.g. Epstein and Rosen-\ninfertility in a woman who has not had previous children, even though\nshe may have had a prior pregnancy. In a preliminary analysis, we\ndivided women with infertility into three categories: women with no\nprior pregnancies; women with at least one prior pregnancy but no live\nbirths; and women who experienced an infertility episode but have had\nlive births prior to experiencing an infertility episode. This preliminary\nanalysis revealed that the 45 women with pregnancies but no live births\nwere significantly different on FSD from women with no prior pregnancies\nbut did not differ significantly from women with live births. In order to\nkeep the analysis as simple and clear as possible, we combined the\n`prior pregnancy but no live birth group' with the `live birth' group.\nThus, our working definitions of primary and secondary infertility match\nthe medical definitions of these terms. We regard women who have\nhad no prior pregnancies as having primary infertility and women with at\nleast one prior pregnancy as having secondary infertility.\nIntentionality\nOf the women who reported having an episode of unprotected regular\nintercourse of over 12 months, 57.7% described themselves as trying to\nbecome pregnant at the time of their infertility episode and were classified\nas infertile with intent. The remaining 42.3% did not report trying to\nbecome pregnant but said they were `okay either way' during their infer-\ntility episode and were classified as infertile without intently.\nResource and demographic variables\nWe controlled for variables which previous research suggested should be\nrelated to distress. These variables are summarized in Table I.\nMethod of analysis\nWe conducted two ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses for\nFSD. OLS regression is the appropriate technique where the dependent\nvariable is quantitative and continuous. In the first analysis we regressed\nFSD on all variables for the entire sample of women with infertility. In\nthe second analysis, we limited the sample to women who received\ntests or treatment for infertility in order to test whether similar results\nwould be obtained when the sample was limited to treatment seekers\nonly. Who to include as having received tests or treatment for infertility\nwas determined by looking at a series of questions about tests and treat-\nment as well as by examining detailed pregnancy histories. Anyone who\nreported receiving specific tests or treatment for infertility was included\nin the `tests and treatment-only' sample as well as in the full sample.\nWomen are included in the treatment sample if they have received any\ntests or treatment for infertility. Only a small minority of the women in\nthe treatment sample (17.6%) have received assisted reproduction treat-\nments. We repeated the same two analyses using CES-D as the depen-\ndent variable. In analyses not shown here, we added an interaction term\nfor infertility type by intentionality with regard to pregnancy. Because\nthe interaction was not significant in any of the analyses, we do not\nreport interaction effects in this article.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics\nTable II presents descriptive statistics for the independent variables\nacross the various infertility groups, showing differences among\nwomen with every possible combination of infertility type and intention-\nality. Table II provides several insights regarding intentionality and infer-\ntility type among women who meet the criteria for infertility. The most\ncommon image of women with infertility is that of a woman who sees\nherself as having explicitly tried to get pregnant and has never had a\nchild. Yet, this group makes up only 34.5% of all of the women who\nmeet the medical criteriafor infertility. Women with secondary infertility\nmake up 61.1% of women with infertility and are about equally divided\nbetween the infertile without intent (i.e. not explicitly trying to become\npregnant at the time of the infertility episode) (31.5%) and the infertile\nwith intent (29.6%). The remaining group (infertile without intent,\nprimary infertility) makes up only a small percentage of the women\nwho meet the criteria for infertility (4.4%).\nFSD varies by infertility group, but CESD-10 does not. FSD is highest\namong the women who have the situation most commonly thought of as\n`infertile': women with no pregnancies who were explicitly trying to con-\nceive at the time of the infertility episode (Mean FSD \u00bc 0.43). This is sig-\nnificantly higher than the mean for the infertile with intent women who\nhave had a pregnancy (Mean FSD \u00bc 0.37). Both of these means are sig-\nnificantly higher than the means for the infertile without intent (M \u00bc\n0.18 for infertile without intent, no prior pregnancy; M \u00bc 0.15 for infer-\ntile without intent, secondary infertility).\nThese patterns suggest that both infertility type and intentionality\nare associated with FSD. Yet it is also possible that characteristics of\nthe women in each of these groups could differ, and those differences,\nnot infertility type/intentionality could explain the differences in FSD.\nWe therefore examined the characteristics associated with infertility\ntype/intentionality. Only a few characteristics are consistent across\ngroups: religiosity, internal medical locus of control, ethical concerns\nabout infertility treatment, percentage Hispanic, percentage Asian\npercent in states with mandated insurance coverage, percentage\nwith their first infertility episode 0\u00ad5 years ago and percentage with\ntheir first infertility episode 6\u00ad10 years ago. As is evident in\nTable II, there are many differences in characteristics by infertility\ntype/intentionality group, but no simple overall pattern emerged.\n.............................................................................................................................................................................................\nTable I Control variables used in the analysis.\nName Description\nDemographic/resource variables\nRace/ethnicity Standard US Census wording.

Looking at those who are not in treatment\nallows us to (i) judge the generalizability of findings from clinic samples,\n(ii) begin to sort out the psychological effects of infertility from the\npsychological effects of infertility treatment and (iii) assess the\nunmet need for counseling services. In this article, we took advantage\nof a US population-based sample and compared results from a general\nsample to a sample restricted to those in treatment.\nWe hypothesized (Hypothesis i) that intentionality about pregnancy\nwould be associated with FSD. Specifically, we hypothesized that\nwomen who described themselves as trying to become pregnant at\nthe time of their infertility episode would have higher levels of FSD\nthan women who did not describe themselves as explicitly trying to\nbecome pregnant at the time of the infertility episode. This hypothesis\nwas supported. Our findings confirm other research we have done on\nintentionality with regard to becoming pregnant (Greil and McQuillan,\nwithout intent say they want more children even though they do\nnot describe themselves as trying to become pregnant at the time\nof the infertility episode. Thus, it is important not to confuse intention-\nality with regard to desire to become pregnant at a particular time\nwith wanting to have another child in general. Furthermore, even\nwhen we limit the sample to only those who have received tests or\ntreatment, the effect of intentionality remains. These results suggest\nthat determining intentionality at the time of an infertility episode\nshould be useful for counseling women with infertility. Further,\nhealth care providers must also be aware that even though their\npatients may report that they are not currently trying to get pregnant,\nthey may, in fact, meet criteria for infertility and want to have children.\nSome women simply do not identify with the idea of `trying' to con-\nceive (Greil and McQuillan, 2010). As most of these women desire\n(more) children, informing women about treatment options could\nbe beneficial for future treatment success.\nWe also hypothesized (Hypothesis ii) that women with primary\ninfertility would have higher levels of FSD than women with secondary\ninfertility. This hypothesis was also supported, confirming the findings\nof the few other--now dated--studies that have looked at the\nrelationship between FSD and type of infertility (Freeman et al.,\naware that the emotional needs of women with primary infertility\nmay differ from those of women with secondary infertility.\nIt is also clear that FSD proved to be much more sensitive to vari-\nations in distress among women with infertility than CESD-10\n(Hypothesis iii). We did not find significant relationships between\neither infertility type or intentionality with CESD-10, a measure of\ngeneral distress. In fact, we found very few relationships with\ngeneral distress other than resource and demographic variables. At\nfirst glance, the lack of findings with regard to a measure of general\ndistress may appear to contradict numerous reports that infertility is\nMonga et al., 2004), but it must be remembered that most of these\nstudies were not focused on variations among women with infertility\nbut comparisons to women without infertility. Our results suggest\nthat general measures of distress are useful for comparing women\nwith infertility to other populations, but fertility-specific measures\nare more appropriate for assessing variability in experiences among\nwomen who go through infertility (Jacob et al., 2007; Schmidt,\n2009). FSD measures should therefore be useful in clinical practice\nas a means of identifying women who are particularly distressed by\ninfertility. The recently developed FertiQoL (Boivin et al., 2010)\nshould be useful for this purpose. For those in need of a shorter\nmeasure, the FSD scale employed here shows promise as a short\nreliable measure for assessing variation in FSD. Future research\nshould explore the measurement properties of the FSD Scale as a\ndiagnostic tool.\nAs we hypothesized (Hypothesis iv), older women have higher FSD\nlevels than younger women. This finding is consistent with the experi-\nence of many caregivers of women and couples with infertility. As\nwomen sense that their `biological clocks' are running down, they\nare likely to experience fertility as even more urgent and unattainable,\nand therefore more distressing. Yet our finding conflicts with that of\nAbbey et al. (1992) who found no association between age and FSD\nin a sample of treatment seekers. This discrepancy could result from\nslightly different measures of FSD or from the difference in samples\n(clinic versus population).\nWe hypothesized (Hypothesis v) that fertility-related variables, such\nas family support and pressure, importance of motherhood and\nwanting more children, should be associated with FSD. As previous\n2007) has suggested, higher perceived social support is associated\nwith lower distress. Most of the `social pressure' variables did not\nhave significant associations with FSD. Encouragement by friends\nand family to seek treatment was not associated with FSD in the treat-\nment only sample but was associated with higher FSD in the full\nsample. We have not seen other reports that encouragement by\nfriends or family and partners is associated with higher FSD. This\nfinding suggests either that not all `support' from those in one's\nsocial network is positive support or that those who have higher\nFSD are more likely to elicit encouragement to seek medical treat-\nment. It is also likely that `encouragement' can seem like `pressure'\nto those who do not seek medical help. Understanding how social\nrelationships can minimize or enhance distress among women with\ninfertility is an important area for additional research. Additionally,\nwomen with infertility could benefit from counselors working to\nhelp with strategies for managing relationships. As we expected,\nwomen who attribute greater importance to motherhood and\nwomen who desire more children exhibit higher levels of FSD than\nwomen who place less importance on having children. This dovetails\nwith the finding of Abbey et al. (1992) that greater importance of chil-\ndren is associated with greater distress.\nBecause general distress is not specific to the fertility experience,\nwe hypothesized (Hypothesis vi) that general distress would be less\nsensitive to fertility-related variables and more sensitive to the stan-\ndard demographic variables that are associated with distress in\ngeneral population studies. This hypothesis is partially supported in\nthis study. Employment, education and having private health insurance\nare associated with lower general distress, although income is not. In\ngeneral, our analyses support the consistent finding that general\nVariation in distress among women with infertility 2109\ndistress levels are lower with higher socioeconomic status (Phelan\ncation or employment modified the association between infertility\nand general distress, their sample was much smaller than ours and\nthey were focused primarily on comparing women with infertility to\nwomen without infertility rather than variations among women with\ninfertility. Of the variables other than demographic and resource vari-\nables, only social support and religiosity were associated with\nCESD-10. Social support and religiosity were associated with well-\nthe other variables were associated with CESD-10 in anticipated\nways suggests that the null findings for the infertility-specific variables\nshould be valid.\nResearchers often emphasize statistically significant findings, but\nunexpected non-significant findings are also worth noting. Most infer-\ntility researchers know that women who identify as members of\nracial/ethnic minority groups are overrepresented among women\nwith infertility and underrepresented among women pursuing infertility\ntreatment compared with white women (Bitler and Schmidt, 2006;\nChandra and Stephen, 2010). That indicators of race/ethnicity are\nnot associated with FSD suggests that the reason for lower treatment\nrate is not because these groups are less distressed by infertility.\nTherefore, we interpret this pattern as suggesting a serious unmet\nneed for infertility services among women who are members of\nracial/ethnic minority groups.\nWe find no association between religiosity and FSD, similar to the\nfinding by Domar et al. (2005) who found that spiritual well-being was\nnot associated with FSD among women undergoing IVF. Mahajan et al.\n(2009) found that intrinsic religiosity was associated with adjustment\nto infertility, but our findings are not comparable because our religios-\nity measure did not distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic religios-\nity. Our finding that medical locus of control appears to conflict with\nthe finding by Koropatnick et al. (1993) that internal locus of control is\nassociated with higher infertility distress, but those authors used a\nmeasure of general locus of control and did not specifically measure\nmedical locus of control.\nIt is striking that many of the variables that differentiated the more\ndistressed from the less distressed have to do with the meaning of\ninfertility. It seems plausible that infertility should be more distressing\nfor women who have never achieved a pregnancy because the specter\nof involuntary childlessness should loom especially large for them. It\nalso seems plausible that infertility should be more distressing to\nwomen who see themselves as having tried to become pregnant.\nGreater intentionality should lead to greater distress when plans are\nnot realized. Alternatively, women who are distressed by not having\na child could come to consider themselves as `trying' rather than\nambivalent about becoming pregnant.\nWomen who are infertile with intent and have had no prior preg-\nnancies stand out as a particularly distressed group. Note also that\nwomen who place a higher value on motherhood have higher levels\nof FSD. This suggests that how one understands or frames infertility\nhas important implications for levels of distress. Our findings suggest\nthat therapy oriented toward empowering clients to reassess the\nmeaning of infertility in their lives is a productive approach to coping\nwith infertility. These results also suggest that perceived social\npressure from family and friends can be perceived as distressing\nrather than supportive. We agree with LeClair-Underberg (2008)\nthat empowering clients to tell friends and family what they need\nfrom them should be more helpful than being angry, or isolating them-\nselves from friends and family who seem insensitive.\nWe wish that we could establish causal order for several of the\nassociations identified in this study. For example, it is possible that per-\nceived pressure from family and friends leads to higher distress, but it\nis also possible that women who are more distressed seek more\nencouragement from others. Although it seems plausible that\nwomen who place a higher value on motherhood will be more dis-\ntressed when they are unable to achieve motherhood, it is also poss-\nible that higher levels of distress contribute to placing more value on\nmotherhood. Because we must rely here on cross-sectional data, the\ncausal ordering of these associations is difficult to assess. The problem\nis compounded because we asked women to recall events in the past.\nFor example, we cannot know if self-reported intentionality actually\npreceded behavior or whether it is a retrospective construction of\npast events. It is plausible that women with greater intentionality\nwith regard to becoming pregnant are likely to experience higher\nlevels of FSD; it is also possible, however, that those who experience\nmore distress from infertility are more likely, in retrospect, to charac-\nterize their episode as a time of explicit `trying'.\nAn additional shortcoming is that some concepts, such as FSD and\nCESD-10, were measured at the time of the interview whereas other\nvariables refer to the time of the infertility episode. The associations\nare thus likely to be weaker than if they had been measured during\nthe infertility episode. Although our analysis showed the same basic\nfindings for recent infertility episodes as for episodes occurring 6\u00ad\n10 years ago, it is likely that for some women these responses\nwould have been different at the time of the episode than at the\ntime of the interview.\nDespite these shortcomings, however, this study contributes to our\nunderstanding of the psychosocial impact of infertility by providing\ncompelling evidence that FSD differs for women with infertility\ndepending on their type of infertility and intentionality with regard\nto becoming pregnant. The use of a probability-based sample that\nincludes women who have not received tests or treatment represents\na major advance over most previous studies and lends our findings\ngreater generalizability.\nConclusion\nUtilizing a large population-based sample has allowed us to test a\nbroader range of psychosocial responses to infertility episodes than\nare usually found in fertility clinics, and it has enabled us to uncover\nthe importance of intentionality and infertility type as important pre-\ndictors of FSD. Infertility type and intentionality with regard to preg-\nnancy are both related to FSD, even after controlling for other\ncharacteristics of women that should also be associated with FSD.\nTherefore, we argue that it is important to know the characteristics\nof infertility episodes in order to understand why women vary in\ntheir experiences of infertility. A better comprehension of variation\nin the experience of infertility should help caregivers to better under-\nstand the needs of women with infertility, including those who are not\ncurrently seeking or receiving services. Understanding variation in\npsychological distress therefore calls for fertility-specific measures.\nWe hope our work will encourage more studies of women from non-\nclinic samples, greater use of fertility-specific measures and a contin-\nued exploration of variation in the psychological concomitants of infer-\ntility. We stress the benefits to women with infertility if counselors and\nphysicians recognize variation among women with infertility and the\nneed to understand what the experience means to women.\nAuthors' roles\nA.L.G. assisted in designing the research instrument, conducted the\nmultiple regression analysis and wrote the first draft of the manuscript.\nK.M.S. played a major role in preparing the data for analysis as well as\nin revising the manuscript.
