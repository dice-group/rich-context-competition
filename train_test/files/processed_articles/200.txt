Changes over time in\nthe prevalence of individual disability dimensions can be tracked to evaluate the rate of age-related losses of specific\nfunctions, 1982-1994. Seven dimensions described changes in the age dependence of 27 activities of daily living,\ninstrumental activities of daily living, and physical performance measures in community and institutional resident\nelderly individuals over the 12 year period. Adjusted for age, the healthiest dimension with the best physical func-\ntion experienced the largest increase in prevalence (3.3%) implying a decline in age-related disability. Disability\ndeclines were correlated with reductions in select health conditions (e.g., dementia and circulatory disease) over the\nstudy period.\nCHRONIC disability is a potentially important indicator\nof age-related biological changes in the U.S. elderly\npopulation because it reflects the intensity of functional\nloss in individuals. Though often associated with the pres-\nence of one, or more, chronic diseases, direct measure-\nments of chronic disability add information on disease pro-\ngression, severity, and interactions within individuals. For\nexample, it is currently possible to slow, but not eliminate,\nchronic degenerative processes like Parkinson's and\nAlzheimer's disease (AD). Research suggests that exoge-\nnous estrogen (1), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n(NSAID) (2), reductions of stroke risks (3), and possibly\nantioxidants (4) may further retard the rate of progression\nof AD. Other research focuses on curing or preventing\nchronic diseases whose courses can now be slowed (e.g.,\natherosclerosis; ischemic heart disease). In both situations,\nan accurate assessment of chronic disability dimensions is\ncrucial to measure progress in improving population health\nat specific ages and to quantify the benefits of new inter-\nventions for treatment of currently refractory conditions in\nthe U.S. population.\nChronic disability is also important because it is a risk\nfactor for other diseases -- many related to age specific\nphysiological changes [e.g., physical disability is a potent,\nshort, and long term risk factor for stroke (5-6), pulmonary\ndysfunction and susceptibility to infection (7), loss of car-\ndiac function (8), and peripheral vascular and muscle tone\nChronic disability thus represents both the causes and\neffects of age related physiological processes on an individ-\nual -- dimensions of which may be modified by interven-\ntions even in highly incapacitated, very elderly persons (e.g.,\nby nutritional and weight training interventions (10--12).\nThe effects of interventions on chronic disability preva-\nlence in the U.S. elderly population may only recently have\npassed threshholds of statistical detectability (relative to the\nbackground noise of short term health variation and mea-\nsurement error) necessary to provide sufficient statistical\nprecision to inform policy evaluations and forecasts (13,\nchanged when reviewing the Social Security program\nbecause U.S. life expectancy increased more than expected\nmortality data in those analyses and concluded, with the\nbenefit of recent data, that not only had disability declined\nchronic disease declines began much earlier. Mortality rates\nfor stroke, responsible for much chronic disability, were\nThe studies cited above describe changes in the preva-\nlence of disability categories, i.e., population groups defined\nby the presence or absence of the ability to perform specific\nactivities. This definition of disability prevalence is flawed if\n(0 the ability, or inability, to perform an activity is reported\nwith error (e.g., there may be differences between the defi-\nnition of disability assumed in framing survey questions and\nthe concept of disability held by survey respondents); (ii)\nthere is imprecision in modeling disability as a discrete cat-\negory due to significant individual variability in disability\nlevels within a category; and (Hi) there is information on\nmultiple dimensions of disability contained in the covari-\nances of the disability measures. A better description of\nchronic disability prevalence can be constructed using a\nmultivariate model to identify distinct dimensions of dis-\nability from which estimates of severity can be defined for\neach individual calculated from correlated disability traits.\nThe procedure used, the Grade of Membership (GoM)\nmodel (21), not only identifies disability dimensions from\nmeasures of whether a person can (or cannot) perform a\nnumber of specific activities, but it also generates, for each\nperson a \"score\" representing the intensity of a person's\ndisability on each dimension. The set of disability scores\ndefines the \"state\" of the individual at a point in time.\nChanges in scores describe the age trajectory of change on\neach disability dimension for an individual. The trajectory\nof the average score for each disability dimension repre-\nsents a continuously graded measure of change in the dis-\nability status of the population over time. Equations de-\nscribing temporal rates of change in the average scores for\neach disability dimension describe a \"multidimensional\"\nrate of aging for the population (21).\nOne may ask whether the population trajectories for the\ndisability dimensions reflect physiological aging changes\n-- or the effects of changes in the sociopsychological per-\nception of disability. Three arguments suggest the trajectory\nof the average scores on the disability dimensions repre-\nsent, at least in part, age-related changes in physiology.\n(0 The use of multiple disability dimensions provides a\nricher description than do age changes in mortality rates.\nSpecifically, the rate of aging across species is often exam-\nined by fitting a Gompertz function to age-specific mortal-\nity rates (22). This was done because it was argued that the\nage dependence of mortality reflected the age rate loss of\n\"vitality\" (the ability to maintain physiological homeosta-\nsis) in an organism (23). Since age-specific mortality rates\nwere easier to measure for multiple, large populations than\nmultiple physiological parameters, cross population com-\nparisons of aging rates were done using mortality data --\nand the fitted Gompertz functions used to make inferences\nabout population differences in the age changes of physio-\nlogical parameters defining vitality. Below we use more\ninformative data to infer the individual's age trajectory of\nphysiological changes, i.e., instead of only having the pop-\nulation age distribution of the catastrophic failure (i.e.,\ndeath) of an organism we have multiple measures of func-\ntional declines in an individual for a number of years prior\nto death.\n(ii) Prolonged exposure to social and environmental fac-\ntors will alter the physiological basis of disability trajecto-\nries at late ages (24). The loss of mobility (which reflects\nfeatures of the built environment, and patterns of social\ninteraction, as well as physical limitations) induces, over\ntime, changes in physiological parameters such as basal\nmetabolic efficiency [lean to fat body mass ratio; insulin-\nlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels (25); serum albumin\n(26)], immunological function [e.g., as mediated by IGF-1\n(27)], cardiopulmonary efficiency (8), and blood chemistry,\ne.g., serum fibrinogen, cholesterol (28-30). These measures\nmay be altered by socioenvironmental exposures -- but so\nare times to death (e.g., there is a 7.6 year difference in the\naverage age at death in U.S. females with >8 years of educa-\ntion vs those with <7 years (31). Thus, by assessing the\nintensity of impairment on multiple disability dimensions a\nmore precise evaluation of changes in the population rate of\nphysiological aging can be made than with mortality data\nalone. As with mortality data there may be cohort and\nperiod effects on the multidimensional trajectory of disabil-\nity (24). Nonetheless, if the functional decline of an individ-\nual is an age-related process, mortality data provide infor-\nmation on that process only at one point in time -- and at\none level of disability (i.e., total loss of function). Having\nassessments at multiple time points on multiple scaled\ndimensions of disability for a person before death provides\nfar more information to characterize and model that process.\n(Hi) Studies suggest that self ratings are more accurate\nand less biased than informant's ratings, with informants\ntending to over-estimate disability (32). If the relation is\nsubject to random noise (e.g., variation in how the individ-\nual's perception of disability relates to loss of function) then\na multivariate procedure can \"filter\" nonreproducible (across\nindividual) variation from stably correlated physical changes\nby isolating a \"small\" number of dimensions from a larger\nbattery of correlated disability measures, i.e., multivariate\nprocedures can be used to adjust for measurement effects.\nIn sum, the GoM (33) procedure uses data on the joint\ndependency of multiple, discrete measures, adjusted for\nmeasurement error, to identify disability dimensions. These\ndimensions predict age-related changes in mortality and\nmorbidity better than many physiological variables, i.e.,\nthey have good predictive validity (33). With the traits asso-\nciated with each disability dimension identified, intensity\nscores for each dimension can be calculated for each person\nin the sample. Changes in the distribution of scores de-\nscribe age and temporal changes in the multiple dimensions\nof disability in the U.S. elderly population. Evaluating\nchanges in disability using scores for each dimension re-\nduces measurement error effects, due to bias or subtle\nchanges in the meaning of specific disability measures (34).\nThe validity of these processes, and changes in the preva-\nlence of each dimension, may also be related to reports of\nchronic diseases (e.g., dementia and stroke) for further vali-\ndation. Changes in the population distribution of disability\ndimensions, consequently, may be useful in estimating cur-\nrent, and forecasting future, changes in U.S. health costs.\nGoM was applied to 27 function and physical perfor-\n1994 National Long Term Care Surveys (NLTCS) to deter-\nmine (0 the number of dimensions needed to describe dis-\nability over time (i.e., did \"new\" dimensions emerge 1982\nto 1994?); (ii) the content of the dimensions, described by\ntheir relation to the 27 measures; and (Hi) the predictive\nvalidity of the dimensions on health outcomes. We discuss\nthe implications of disability trends for dementia preva-\nDATA\n1994 NLTCS-national longitudinal surveys based on list\nsamples of U.S. Medicare enrollees aged 65+. In each sur-\nvey, persons are screened to determine if they had a\nchronic (i.e., lasted, or expected to last, 90+ days) impair-\nment of an activity of daily living (ADL; 35) or instrumen-\ntal activity of daily living (IADL; 36). If a person had no\nchronic disability he or she was not given a detailed instru-\nment, i.e., persons were not asked detailed questions about\nchronic disabilities they did not have. Those reporting at\nleast one chronic disability, or who were residents of insti-\ntutions providing long-term care, were given a detailed\nterview. The same screening procedures, field methods,\nand disability, physical performance, and health condition\nmeasures were used in all four NLTCSs to minimize\nconfounding of measurement error, bias, and disability\nchanges.\nimpaired in a prior NLTCS were re-interviewed to assess\npositive and negative changes in disability. In addition, in\nthose NLTCS, new samples of 5,000 persons who passed age\n65 between surveys were drawn from a national list of Medi-\ncare enrollees and screened for disability. Sampling persons\nwho passed age 65 between two surveys ensures that all four\nsurveys represented the U.S. population aged 65+.\nviews was conducted with nondisabled persons (i.e., per-\nsons not reporting disability on the screen). This was done\nto improve the description of the dimensions for nondis-\nabled persons. In three prior NLTCSs there were 2,432 per-\nsons not reporting any disability who completed detailed\ncommunity interviews. These represented persons who had\nbeen disabled at a prior survey (once screened in as dis-\nabled, a person was given a detailed interview in every sub-\nsequent survey until death), who had ceased to be disabled\nby the time the detailed interview was given, or who had\nreported minor disabilities on the screen that were not con-\nfirmed in the detailed interview (i.e., false positives). The\nscreen and detailed interviews were constructed so that\nthere would be a small false positive rate to minimize false\nnegative responses to the screen. These various factors gen-\nerated a nondisabled detailed interview group sufficiently\nlarge to estimate characteristics of nondisabled persons in\nabled community interview respondents were not statisti-\ncally different from the total nondisabled screen population\nin terms of (/) mortality rates, or (//) use of Medicare\nfunded health services. The 922 additional nondisabled per-\ncommunity detailed responders already in the 1994 sample\nas a result of the longitudinal follow-up process. Sample\nweights were adjusted in 1994 so that each sample compo-\nnent appropriately represented the corresponding popula-\ntion component.\nA supplementary sample of 540 persons aged 95+ was\nalso drawn in 1994. These persons were screened for dis-\nability. They only received a detailed interview if disabled\nor institutionalized. The supplement improved the precision\nof disability estimates for persons at extreme ages. The 95+\npopulation in 1994 was reweighted to reflect their popula-\ntion proportions.\nThe NLTCS samples, drawn from Medicare enrollment\nlists, had the same structure [e.g., location and identity of\nprimary sampling units (the specific geographic areas\nfrom which sample members are drawn)] and used the\nsame field methods to reduce artifactual changes in disabil-\nity. Over the 12 years spanned by the four surveys a total of\n35,848 distinct individuals were followed and, from linked\n1996. Since samples are randomly drawn from all individ-\nuals in Medicare files, persons in all types of institutional\nresidence are represented as well as community dwellers in\ninnovative residential structures such as continuing care re-\ntirement communities (38). The use of continuously up-\ndated Medicare files to track sample respondents between\nsurveys means follow-up on individuals was near 100% so\nthat bias due to the lack of follow-up of severely disabled or\nill persons is minimized. In the NLTCS, response rates are\n=95% (after adjusting for mortality attrition -- decedents\nalso have high service use prior to death).\nMETHODS\nGoM identifies K dimensions from J measurements\nmade on a sample of / (i = 1, 2, . . . , I) persons up to T\ntimes. The f measure has L3\nresponses. With these defini-\ntions, the model is,\nIn Eq. 1, y,y;(Os are binary (0,1) variables indicating if\nperson / had the /lh response to the jl h (j = 1, 2 , . . . , 27) vari-\nand 1994 NLTCS, respectively). The probability of a\nresponse is the sum of the product of gik\n(t), a score sum-\nming to 1.0 (and in the range 0 to 1.0) for each person i, at\ntime t, over the K dimensions, and \\kj\n,{t), a conditional\nprobability describing the content of a dimension as the\nprobability that the kh dimension manifests the /lh response\nfor the /h variable at time t. gik\n(t) indicates the degree of\nsimilarity of the traits observed for a person to the set of\ntraits defining the /c*h dimension. Because the distribution of\nindividual scores [g,*(0] comprises estimated parameters\ndistinct from those defining the dimensions, the scores \"fil-\nter\" individual response variation from the definition of the\ndimensions, i.e., Kkj\ni(t). Since the g,k\n(t) are not constrained\nover time they describe temporal changes, for persons inter-\nviewed more than once, on the K dimensions -- which are\nconstrained to have the same content every time.\nBoth sets of parameters are estimated by maximum like-\nlihood (39). The likelihood for the four surveys is,\nL=nnnn(ig*(t)-\\kJ\n(-)YJI'\\(K<<j). m\nIn Eq. 2, the set of scores [gik\n(t)s] for an individual can\nvary over time. \\kj\n,(-)s do not, i.e., they are forced to be\nequal over time so the content of each dimension is time\ninvariant. Thus, the interpretation of a numerical value of\ngik\n(t) does not change. Disability change for individual / is\nexamined by following the ^-element vectors of gik(t)s (33).\nBecause K is smaller than J (in our analysis, K = 6 and J =\n27), the model exploits the interrelation of measures to deal\nwith reporting error, i.e., the procedure extracts the infor-\nmation that is consistent across multiple measures. Thus,\nmeasurement error, either cross sectional or, because of\nthe time constraint, longitudinal, is \"filtered\" from the K\ndimensions.\nTo determine the number of dimensions necessary to\ndescribe significant variation in J measures, x2 approxima-\ntions to likelihood ratios for models with K and K + 1\ndimensions are calculated. When the x2 increase due to the\naddition of the K + 1 dimension is no longer significant\n(with / + Z (Lj-l) degrees of freedom) we know K dimen-\nsions best describe the information in the J variables, i.e.,\nconditional on gik\n(t) and \\y/(-) estimates, ymft) are in-\ndependent.\nThe use of K dimensions to describe disability changes\nhas other advantages. By projecting changes of the 27 mea-\nsures onto K dimensions, estimates of disability change are\nimproved. This could have been done by simply counting\nthe disabilities a person had at two points in time and exam-\nining changes in the count. However, if there are substan-\ntive differences between measures, examining changes in\nthe count of disability may be biased and, if there are sig-\nnificant correlations among the 27 measures, information in\nthose correlations is ignored and stochasticity overesti-\nmated. GoM jointly minimizes bias and errors in estimating\nstochasticity (21). This is important for forecasts, and for\nestimating, the prevalence of morbidity associated with\nfunctional loss.\nChange in the \"prevalence of disability\" is thus general-\nized to be change in the statistical moments of the K dimen-\nsional population distribution of the gik(t)s [i.e., the distribu-\ntion of the gik(t)s weighted by time specific sample weights,\nWt(t)]. The most basic analysis of prevalence change is to\ntrack the average of the sample weighted g.*(t)s over time.\nTo help interpret the K dimensions one can indepen-\ndently calculate A.*m\n/(-) values for M \"external\" variables (m\n= 1, . . . , M) with the gik(t)s calculated from 27 disability\nmeasures fixed. Since X.*;/(-)s defining the K dimensions are\ntemporally invariant this is equivalent to calculating X.\u00ab(-)s\nconditionally on the processes generating the gik(t)s. These\ndescribe prevalence changes across surveys of the mlh con-\ndition for a given time invariant disability dimension. To\nestimate period specific prevalences for the Xtm\n;()s, four\nsets of kkmi(t)s were estimated -- one for each time.\nRESULTS\nTwenty-seven measures were used to define six disability\ndimensions for 21,574 respondents to the detailed commu-\nnity interviews in the four NLTCS. The use of a seventh\ndimension to explain the 27 measures did not significantly\np \u00ab .001). Thus, six dimensions were sufficient to describe\nthe variation of the 27 disability measures of respondents to\nall four community surveys. The GoM analysis in which\nintensity scores were calculated was restricted to commu-\nnity residents.\nIn a separate analysis of the combined community and\ninstitutional respondents (N ~ 25,000), a seventh dimension\nwas identified that described institutional residents. The\ninstitutional population was distinct from the community\npopulation in the activities which they could not perform,\ni.e., for many disabilities there is little variation in the insti-\ntutional population. For analyses of the entire population\nwe added institutional residents (to the file containing com-\nmunity respondents) by defining a seventh dimension whose\nscore, representing institutional residence, was 0 or 1.0.\nThus, a separate, discrete (i.e., all gn\n(t) = 1 or 0) dimension\nwas defined for institutional residents.\nThe \\y/()s for the six dimensions calculated from pooled\ndata are in Table 1. X.y/()s represent the probability that a\nperson exactly like a dimension (i.e., gik\n27 traits. Whether a \\y;() is \"characteristic\" or \"not charac-\nteristic\" of a dimension is determined by comparing it to\nthe frequency of that trait in the total sample (40,41). In\nTable 1, 10.6% of the sample needed help with eating.. Only\ndimension 6 had that disability. The probability of an eating\nproblem for a person exactly like dimension 6, 80.8%, sug-\ngests that such a person has a 7.6 times greater risk (i.e.,\n(10.6%) of an eating problem in the total sample.\nThe first three dimensions in Table 1 are not associated\nwith any ADL or IADL impairment except heavy housework.\nImpairment on the seven physical functions increases across\nthese dimensions. The physical functions span a range of\ncapabilities, e.g., from stair climbing, which may not affect\nADLs or IADLs, to grasping an object -- which, if severe,\ncould affect ADL and IADLs. Dimension 4 had many IADLs\nimpaired -- but no ADLs. The IADLs for managing money,\ntaking medicine, and phoning are associated with dementia\nand stroke (42). (This is validated in Table 2.) Dimension 4\nshowed no problems with physical functions involving upper\nlimbs. There were limitations in climbing stairs, holding a\nheavy (10 lb.) package, and in vision -- sensory impairments\nincrease disability in both community and institutional popu-\nlations (43,44). Dimension 5 has a mix of ADL and IADL\nimpairments. These primarily involve mobility limitation as\nsuggested by the associated limitations on the physical func-\ntions. Dimension 6 is highly ADL- and IADL-impaired with\nlimitations on all physical functions and vision.\nThe content of the six dimensions can be explicated by\nexamining the probability that a person characterized by a\ndimension has one or more of M conditions. Conditions are\ndescribed in Table 2 and their X.y/()s presented. Because\nA.t/;(-)s are calculated in an independent likelihood calcula-\ntion, the dimensions defined by the 27 disability items do\nnot change.\nIn Table 2, to identify conditions characterizing a dimen-\nsion, we underlined the two highest probabilities for each\nported arthritis or joint problems. Dimension 3 has a 100%\nlikelihood of this condition; dimension 5, an 88.5% likeli-\nhood. Thus these two dimensions show a higher likelihood\nof arthritis and joint problems than a person selected at ran-\ndom from the pooled sample.\nThese conditions help identify physiological correlates of\nthe six dimensions in Table 1. The first never has a higher\nlikelihood of having a given condition than the average\nprobability of that problem occurring in the pooled sam-\nples, i.e., there are, on average, 45.7% fewer conditions\nthan for a person selected at random from the pooled sam-\nple. Thus, dimension 1 is healthier than average. Though\nthe probabilities of serious conditions are low (e.g., 0.4%\nfor dementia; 1.4% for heart attack, 1.6% for stroke) they\nare not zero. This is because the traits for this dimension\nare identified using all 28 conditions. Thus, the presence of\nTable 1.

Though\nrisks for many conditions are small, because dimension 1 is\nprevalent (see Table 5), the population burden of conditions\nassociated with this dimension is significant.\nDimension 2 has about the same chance as the pooled\nsample of having any condition. Dimension 3 shows higher\nthan average risks of cardio-pulmonary problems but few\nneurological problems. It is the youngest of the nondisabled\nyears for the first two). Thus, dimension 3 may have acute\ncare costs but be less likely than, say, dimensions 4 or 6 to\nhave formal, or informal, chronic care costs. Dimension 4,\nhas neurological disorders -- especially stroke and dementia.\nThis is consistent with its impairment on IADLs (phoning,\ntaking medicine, money management) associated with\ndementia. This dimension has the highest mean age (85.2\nyears). Dimension 5 has a mean age of 79.8 years and is\ncharacterized by fractures, joint problems, and paralysis. This\nis consistent with the three physical functions most often\nimpaired being related to mobility. Dimension 6 has neuro-\nlogical, cardiopulmonary, and multiple other conditions.\nUsing the information in Tables 1 and 2 the six dimen-\nsions can be characterized;\n1. Healthy, unimpaired;\n2. Not ADL/IADL impaired with some limitation of\nthree physical functions;\n3. Not ADL/IADL impaired, but young with some phys-\nical limitation due to cardiopulmonary problems;\n4. IADL impaired with cognitive limitations often due to\ndementia and stroke;\n5. Moderate ADL and IADL impairment -- often due to\nmusculoskeletal problems;\n6. Complexly impaired.\nAlso presented in Table 1 are the mean gik(t)s in the\nNLTCS detailed community interview sample. Because the\ngik(t)s sum to 1.0 for each person at each time, the average\nof the mean is fixed at 16.7%. The mean values range from\nsion 1), with a median of 15.9%. Thus, all six dimensions\nare well represented in the study sample. The mean gik\n(t)\nvalue may also be interpreted as a measure of the preva-\nlence of the kh dimension in the sample, i.e., the fraction of\nthe sample characterized by that dimension. To determine\nthe general population prevalences of the six dimensions,\nsample weights must be applied to the gik(t)s before averag-\ning (see below).\ncontent of the six dimensions changed over time because,\nthough pooled estimates of M/), by construction, describe\nthe characteristics of disabled persons averaged over time,\nlarge differences in the \\kji(-)s between surveys would imply\nchange in the disablement processes. If large differences\nexist, tests would be needed to discriminate (/) changes in\nthe disablement processes, from (ii) emergence of new, and\ndisappearance of old, disability dimensions. In the latter case\nchanges are described by changes in the gik\n(t) distribution.\nIn Table 3, we present A.*//()s and mean gik(t)s estimated\nwas no significant difference in disability from 1982 to\napart, and (///) pooling the two surveys doubles the number\nof respondents (N = 12,000; about half of the total commu-\nnity sample) with detailed interviews, increasing the preci-\nsion of the baseline parameters describing the six dimen-\nsions, which improves cross-temporal comparisons.\nDimension 1 is similar to the same dimension in Table 1\nwith no ADL or IADL impairments (except heavy house-\nwork) and few physical limitations. Dimension 2 has prob-\nlems only with heavy housework. As in Table 1, dimension\n2 is modestly more physically limited than dimension 1.\nDimension 3 has limited IADL impairments related to\nhave any IADLs impaired. Dimension 4 is similar to the\nsame dimension in Table 1, with one ADL (bathing) and\nmany IADLs impaired. There was little physical impair-\nment. Three IADLs related to dementia also characterize\nhave similar traits to the same dimensions in Table 1. Thus,\nthere is little change in the content of the dimensions over\ntime. Differences are attributable to the improved precision\nNLTCS community interview respondents. Less disabled\ndimensions are better defined by this addition because in the\nprevalences [i.e., mean gik\n(t)s] in Table 1 are 4% higher for\nditions are in Table 4.\nComparisons of Tables 2 and 4 show a 5% decline in the\nfewer conditions, i.e., their health burden declined. Dimen-\nsion 4 reported more (5.9%) medical conditions. Dimen-\nsion 5 reported 15.6% fewer conditions. Dimension 6 did\nnot change.\nThus, even without disability declines, the population\nmorbidity burden would decline. As in Table 2, dimension 1\nhas less than the average likelihood of having any condition.\nDimension 2 has moderate cardiopulmonary problems --\nwith a higher prevalence than in Table 2 -- consistent with\ncirculatory disease prevalence (and mortality) decline 1982-\n1994. Dimension 3 has cardiopulmonary problems similar to\ndimension 3 in Table 2 -- though more prevalent (e.g.,\nreduction of cardiopulmonary problems between the\nreporting a medical condition over all four surveys, i.e., a\ncounterpart in Table 2, has the second most stroke and\ndementia. Dimension 5 has the most hip and other fractures\nand paralysis. Dimension 6 has the most neurological disease\n(stroke, dementia, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, epilepsy,\nand Parkinson's disease), cancer, and atherosclerosis.\nThe health conditions characterizing the six dimensions\nmost evident, produced few changes in the relation of con-\nditions to dimensions. Changes are indicated by footnotes a\nand b in Table 2. In dimension 2, seven conditions were no\nlonger the first or second most prevalent condition in 1982-\n1994. One (cancer) increased. In dimension 3, three condi-\ntions (cerebral palsy, cancer, other fractures) declined. Di-\nmension 4 did not change. Dimensions 5 (+4) and 6 (+5)\nhad nine conditions increase in prevalence suggesting an\nincrease in the age at which conditions emerged (i.e., di-\nmensions 2 and 3, with nine conditions with declining prev-\nalence, are the two youngest; dimensions 5 and 6 with nine\nconditions increasing in prevalence are 5 years older, on\naverage, than dimensions 1 and 2).\nand 1994 population prevalences of disability, gik(t)s are\nmultiplied by adjusted sample weights for individuals\n[wi(t)] in each survey year to translate sample frequencies\nof traits into population frequencies. In addition, as de-\nscribed above, we added a seventh dimension, weighted to\nrepresent the institutional population in all four years, to\nrepresent the entire U.S. elderly population.\nIn Table 5 the largest change (unadjusted for age) is an\nincrease of 2.3% in the prevalence of Dimension 1. Dimen-\nsions 2 and 3 increased a net 0.44%. Thus, the nondisabled\nabled dimensions decreased in prevalence. Though corre-\nlated with age, conditioning on dimensions only partly\nadjusts for age.

In Table 6 we present \\w()s for dementia esti-\n(t)\nestimates for all four years. Dementia was defined by a per-\nson's inability to complete the SPMSQ (Short Portable\nMental Status Questionnaire) due to cognitive impairment\nand the need for a proxy respondent, due to cognitive im-\npairment, to complete the survey. Thus, dementia was\nbased on (i) the inability to respond to the interview and (//)\nobservations of both the interviewer and a proxy respondent\nabout the person's cognitive state. Dementia is thus perfor-\nmance based and severe -- not based on the self report of\ndementia which may produce downwardly biased rate esti-\nmates for persons with mild impairment. We present the\n1982 prevalence of dementia estimated by multiplying the\n\\*m\nprevalence of dementia standardized to the 1994 age distri-\nbution is also presented. The 1994 prevalence is calculated\ndirectly from \\w(1994) multiplied by the gik(t)s for persons\nDementia in the NLTCS represents severe impairment due\nto all types of dementia, e.g., multi-infarct dementia as well\nas AD.\nApplying population weighted mean gik(t)s for 1982 to\nthe \\im\n/(1982) for the seven dimensions, produces a demen-\nmillion persons had severe dementia in 1982.

The largest in-\ncrease, 3.3%, was for dimension 1 which had no ADL,\nIADL, or physical impairments -- and the fewest medical\nproblems. Increases in these dimensions suggest that age-\nrelated disability may be declining in the U.S. elderly popu-\nlation. This is consistent with Gompertz shape parameters,\nestimated from mortality for elderly U.S. cohorts, which\ncan be interpreted as biological rates of aging, declining\nChanges in the average disability dimension scores are con-\nsistent with those cohort results. However, being global\nmeasures of physical and cognitive function in elderly per-\nsons before death, disability scores may be interpreted as\nmore directly measuring changes in the biological rate of\naging -- or, as suggested above, in several dimensions of\nbiological aging.\nThese declines, being so rapid, could represent the inter-\naction of exogenous factors with biological aging rates.\nThere are several possible causes of such declines. One is\nthat as the educational status of the population aged 65+\nincreased, their ability to comply with the complexities of\nDimension\nSum of\nDisability\nSpecific\nPrevalences\nX,ra/\n1982 prevalence of dementia by disability profile after\ng* X w,(t)\\ (%)\nNumber of cases\n1982 prevalence of dementia by profile after\nstandardizing to the 1994 age distribution (%)\n1994 prevalence of dementia by disability profile after\nadjusting for g,,( 1994) multiplied by sample\nDifferences in dementia between that\nmedical care for chronic conditions, and the ability to mod-\nify behavioral risk factors, improved.

In addition, educa-\ntion and occupation are negatively correlated with AD risk\n-- through possibly different physiological mechanisms.\nSecond, improved medical technologies may reduce the\nrisk of chronically disabling diseases, and of chronic disabil-\nity causing other medical conditions, e.g., improvements,\nmanagement of cardiovascular disease in persons aged 80+.\nConditions with the fewest clinical advances to date are neu-\nrological conditions like AD. It was, therefore, interesting\ncould be due to increased education, better treatment of\nnon-AD dementias, or increased use of exogenous estrogens\nand NSAIDs since the mid-1980s -- as well as changes in\ncomorbidity (e.g., stroke).\nThird, improvements may result from better health care\ncoverage of the U.S. elderly population due to Medicare.\nThough Medicare (and Medicaid) started in 1965, it is plau-\nsible that there was a 15-20 year lag before improved cov-\nerage affected chronic disability prevalence in the elderly\npopulation because it takes time (/) for the U.S. health care\nsystem to adjust to Medicare; (if) after the Medicare pro-\ngram altered the U.S. health care system, before clinical\ninterventions delivered through that program altered\nchronic disease prevalence; and (Hi) for reductions in\nchronic disease prevalence to reduce chronic disability.\nFinally, disability declines may be due to cohort differ-\nences in the age related loss of functioning due to different\nearly life experiences. Evidence of cohort differences in the\nage trajectory of disability and mortality were found in the\ndeclines to 1994 is consistent with younger cohorts having\ndifferent age trajectories of functional loss and mortality\nrisk. It is also possible the effects of Medicare, and im-\nprovements in clinical interventions, were delayed until\nchanges in the educational and income status of the U.S.\nelderly population made them receptive to, and compliant\nwith, interventions.\nIt is likely that disability declines derive from all four\nsources -- with the relative contribution of the first three\nfactors changing over time with cohort factors being persis-\ntent. These results have practical, and scientific, implica-\ntions. Associated with declines in disability were declines\nin specific medical problems which could yield large cost\nsavings.\nTo explain dementia prevalence declines from 1982--\n1994 it is important that a significant portion of dementia is\nnot due to AD. Some causes of non-AD dementia are\nreversible or preventable, e.g., nutritional deficiencies, mul-\ntiple cerebral infarction, or psychiatric disorders. In addi-\ntion, education is correlated with AD incidence. Stern et al.\n(51) found persons with 8+ years of education had a 60%\nlower incidence of AD at age 80 (18%) than persons with\n<8 vears (32%). The effect was largest for cases with clear\nAD diagnoses. Occupation had a similar effect on AD inci-\ndence, though, because of differences in parietotemporal\nperfusion, possibly by different mechanisms. There was\nalso an interaction of \"high\" occupation (jobs involving\nmental functioning) and high education. At age 85, high\neducation reduced AD prevalence 51.7%, high occupation\n29.6%. Persons with high education and occupation had a\nThus, education and occupation's effects on AD are large\nenough to cause measurable declines in prevalence due to\nlarge increases in education in the elderly population from\nlated to nutritional and drug use trends. Antioxidants (e.g.,\nvitamin E) may reduce oxidative neurological damage asso-\nciated with AD pathology (4,53).

Finally, AD\nmanifestation may be related to the joint occurrence of\nstroke (3,55), early hypertension (56), or atherosclerosis\n(57). The three possible cofactors all declined from\naging, to the extent it is plausibly manifest in reduced mor-\ntality, morbidity, and disability, could have important impli-\ncations for U.S. health costs.\n"
