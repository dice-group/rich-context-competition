Many US states are legalizing marijuana for medical uses.\nObjective: To determine the prevalence of medical marijuana use and diversion among\npsychiatric inpatients in Colorado. Methods: Some 623 participants (54.6% male) responded to\nan anonymous 15-item discharge survey that assessed age, gender, marijuana use, possession\nof a medical marijuana card, diversion of medical marijuana, perceived substance use problems,\nand effects of marijuana use. Univariate statistics were used to characterize participants and\ntheir responses. Chi-square tests assessed factors associated with medical marijuana registra-\ntion. Results: Of the total number of respondents, 282 (47.6%) reported using marijuana in the\nlast 12 months and 60 (15.1%) reported having a marijuana card. In comparison to survey\nrespondents who denied having a medical marijuana card, those respondents with a medical\nmarijuana card were more likely to have initiated use before the age of 25, to be male, to have\nused marijuana in the last 12 months, and to have used at least 20 days in the past month. 133\n(24.1%) respondents reported that someone with a medical marijuana card had shared or sold\nmedical marijuana to them; 24 (41.4%) of respondents with a medical marijuana card reported\never having shared or sold their medical marijuana. Conclusion: Medical marijuana use is much\nmore prevalent among adults hospitalized with a psychiatric emergency than in the general\npopulation; diversion is common.

Colorado, where the medical use of\nmarijuana was permitted in 2000 and the recreational use was\npermitted in 2014, has the highest per-capita use of medical\nmarijuana in the United States (2); over 2% of the state's\npopulation is registered to use medical marijuana (3). To\nregister a patient to use medical marijuana, a Colorado\nphysician attests that a patient has one of eight qualifying\nconditions \u00ad cancer, cachexia, HIV/AIDS, glaucoma, epi-\nlepsy, muscle spasms, severe nausea, or severe pain. The\nregistry does not require the failure of other treatments, or an\nongoing patient-physician relationship, and has no exclusion\ncriteria or age requirements. The registry allows physicians to\nrecommend, although not prescribe, marijuana to people with\na ``chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition'' that\n``may be alleviated by the medical use of marijuana'' (4).\nPeople recommended to use medical marijuana by a physician\nare anonymously registered with the Colorado Department of\nPublic Health and the Environment (CDPHE). The CDPHE\npublishes aggregate demographics that show that the average\nage of registrants is 40 years, 69% of registrants are male, and\n94% of patients are registered under the ``severe pain''\ncondition (2).\nAt Denver Health, the city's academic safety-net health-\ncare system, it is our clinical impression that the use of\nmedical marijuana is prevalent among our patients. We have\ntreated many patients with adverse events temporarily\nassociated with medical marijuana use, especially psychiatric\nadverse events like suicide attempts (2). Marijuana is a\ncomplex psychoactive compound that has different effects\non a user based on dose, strain, and formulation of marijuana,\nas well as a user's previous exposure to marijuana. The chief\nAddress correspondence to Abraham M. Nussbaum, MD, Director, Adult\nInpatient Psychiatry Service, Denver Health, Assistant Professor of\nPsychiatry, University of Colorado School of Medicine, 777 Bannock\npsychoactive ingredient of marijuana, D-9-tetrahydrocanna-\nbinol, is a partial agonist at the brain's endocannabinoid CB1\nreceptors, receptors that assist in the regulation of appetite,\nmood, and motivation (5). Researchers are exploring the\npotential therapeutic benefits of the multiple components of\nmarijuana for conditions including neuropathic pain and\nspasms associated with multiple sclerosis (1). In addition, in\nsurveys of marijuana users in the United Kingdom (6) and\nCanada (7), many respondents have characterized the anxio-\nlytic and sedative properties of marijuana as salutary.\nAt the same time, marijuana use is associated with several\npsychiatric adverse events. The World Health Organization\nnames marijuana as the most commonly used illicit substance\nin the world (8). In the United States, approximately 6500\nindividuals begin using marijuana each day (9), and approxi-\nmately 10% of users develop a cannabis use disorder (10).\nAmong people admitted to substance treatment facilities in\nthe United States, 17.1% identify marijuana as their primary\nsubstance of abuse (11). In addition to its association with\nsubstance use disorders, the regular use of marijuana is\nassociated with the development of anxiety disorders (12),\ndepressive disorders (13), suicidality (14), and cognitive\ndecline (15) in several cohort studies and meta-analyses. The\nassociations between marijuana use and psychiatric disorders\nhave been extensively studied for psychotic disorders. In the\nresulting systematic reviews of epidemiologic and cohort\ndata, the use of marijuana is significantly associated with an\nincreased risk of developing schizophrenia at an earlier age\n(16), while other studies correlate marijuana use by persons\nwith schizophrenia with impaired performance on tests of\nattention and impulsivity (17).\nWhile the biological mechanisms for the effects of\nmarijuana are still being fully elucidated, the available\nliterature suggests several mechanisms for the varieties of\npsychopathology often experienced by persons on an inpatient\npsychiatry unit. For example, activation of the endocannabi-\nnoid system increases impulsivity and suicidality, so the use\nof marijuana, which supplies exogenous cannabinoids, may\nincrease impulsive acts and suicidal behavior, two common\nreasons for admission to a psychiatric facility (2). In animal\nmodels, marijuana use activates astroglial cannabinoid recep-\ntors in the hippocampus, which may explain the association\nin human marijuana users between bilateral volume reduction\nof the amygdala, hippocampus, and other brain structures\ninvolved in encoding memory (1); memory deficits are\nfeatures of many disorders experienced by patients admitted\nto psychiatric facilities. Similarly, other animal models\nassociate exogenous stimulation of the endocannabinoid\nsystem with impairment in GABA transmission, leading to\nenduring disinhibition in the prefrontal cortex (18).\nIt is less clear to what extent the use of marijuana is related\nto the utilization of psychiatric resources like hospitalization.\nA recent prospective cohort study found that 30% of adults\nadmitted for psychiatric hospitalization used marijuana in the\n30 days before hospitalization, but the study was conducted\nin a location where the recreational and medical use of\nmarijuana was illegal (19). To contextualize this finding, in\nthe 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which\nmeasures drug use in the general population, 6.6% of persons\nage 12 or older report marijuana use in the month (9).\nWhile these are separate studies with different methodologies,\nthe available evidence suggests that persons hospitalized for\npsychiatric treatment use marijuana at higher rates than the\ngeneral population.\nAt present, the currently published studies examining how\npersons with mental illness use medical marijuana have small\nsample sizes \u00ad a sample of 18 adults in California (20), and of\nthree studies were conducted after the legalization of the\nmedical marijuana \u00ad and were conducted with persons\nenrolled in substance treatment programs. Finally, the diver-\nsion of medical marijuana has been previously described only\nin the Arizona Youth Survey, which found that 11.6% of 8th\nthrough 12th grade marijuana users had obtained their\nmarijuana from someone with a medical marijuana card\n(23). While this survey showed that diversion of medical\nmarijuana is prevalent, it did not obtain characteristics of\nthose diverting medical marijuana, the survey was limited to\nadolescents, and it did not address persons hospitalized for\npsychiatric care.\nTo test our clinical impressions that medical marijuana use\nis prevalent among our patients and to begin to address the\nknown gaps in the literature \u00ad diversion by adults, use and\ndiversion by persons hospitalized for psychiatric care, and\nsmall sample sizes \u00ad we initiated this study to, first,\ncharacterize the prevalence of medical marijuana use, the\nsharing or selling of medical marijuana by people registered\nto use medical marijuana, and the use of other people's\nmedical marijuana among a sample of adults admitted to an\ninpatient psychiatric service. Second, to determine if medical\nmarijuana use, registration, or diversion correlates with a\nperson's age, gender, age of first marijuana use, self-\nperception of having a substance problem, past year marijuana\nuse, and frequency of marijuana use. Third, to redress the\nresearch gap about the use and diversion of medical marijuana\namong persons requiring psychiatric hospitalization, in an\ninitial effort to assess how the legalization of medical\nmarijuana alters the use of psychiatric services.\nSince the use of marijuana is associated with substance use\ndisorders and psychiatric disorders, we hypothesized, first,\nthat registration to use medical marijuana would be prevalent\namong our respondents. Furthermore, we hypothesized, based\non known patterns of marijuana use in Colorado, as reported\nby the CDPHE (2), and the associations between marijuana\nuse and substance use disorders (12\u00ad17), that respondents\nwho used and diverted medical marijuana would report more\nsubstance-related problems, earlier and more frequent use,\nand be more likely to be a man between the ages of 25 and 44,\nwhen compared to respondents who did not report the use and\ndiversion of medical marijuana.\nMethods\nSetting and participants\nDenver Health Medical Center provides psychiatric services\nthrough its ambulatory substance treatment facilities, psych-\niatry emergency service, and its inpatient units. Adults aged\n18 years and older can be admitted to the adult inpatient\npsychiatric service, which is divided into two units of equal\nsize. The west unit is for patients who require the availability\nof seclusion or restraint; the east unit is for less agitated\npatients. Patients often transfer to the east side before\ndischarge, so approximately twice as many people discharged\nfrom the unit's east side than from its west side during the\nstudy period. All patients discharged from the adult inpatient\neligible for this study. Participation was defined as willing-\nness to complete at least one item on the survey. Patients were\nexcluded if they were transferred to a correctional facility\nat discharge.\nQuestionnaire and survey process\nBefore the study began, the Colorado Multiple Institutional\nReview Board reviewed and approved the protocol and survey\ninstrument. As part of the unit's standard discharge process,\npatients meet with a staff nurse to review their continuing care\nplan. During the study period, the staff nurse asked each\npatient if he or she would participate in an anonymous survey\nassessing medical marijuana use and diversion. The ques-\ntionnaire was based on prior research evaluating medical\nmarijuana use and diversion among adolescents (21).\nParticipants were informed about the study in writing and\nverbally. To allay fears of surveillance, the survey was\nadministered on paper rather than on a computer. Out of\nconcern that a lengthy survey would have a low completion\nrate, we limited our survey to a single printed page and\nfocused our questions on a participant's use, diversion, and\nexperience with medical marijuana. Participants were\nreminded on the questionnaire itself that their participation\nwas voluntary, anonymous, and not a part of their medical\nrecord. Participants received no compensation. Participants\nand staff were instructed not to write participant names on the\nquestionnaire. If a person declined to answer the survey, the\nnurse was instructed to leave the survey blank, and no data\nwas gathered on persons who declined to participate. If a\nperson was willing to answer the survey, the person completed\nas much as they were willing to complete. If a person was\nunable to read, the discharging nurse read the survey to them.\nIf a person was unable to read English, the survey was read to\nthem with the assistance of a hospital interpreter or an\ninterpreter language line. The completed survey was placed\ninto a locked box mounted on the wall of each unit. The\nsurveys were removed and stored in a locked cabinet until the\nstudy ended.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the survey had a skip-pattern design\nwhere not all questions applied to every respondent, so we\nanticipated that each question would receive a different\nnumber of responses. Thus, our study results are reported\nbased on the number of respondents to each question, which\nleads to an uneven number of subjects in comparison groups.\nIf a participant denied having a medical marijuana card, any\nresponses about the reasons, use, and medical visits related to\nmedical marijuana were ignored.\nStatistical analyses\nUnivariate statistics, including frequencies, percentages,\nmedians, and interquartile ranges (IQR) were used to\ncharacterize the patients and their responses about medical\nmarijuana use. All continuous variables were non-normally\ndistributed based on the Anderson-Darling test (p50.01).\nPearson Chi-square tests were used to determine risk factors\nassociated with medical marijuana registrants. Cramer's V\nwas used to determine effect size. P values less than 0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant and all analyses were done\nusing SAS Software v9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).\nResults\nDuring the 13-month study period, a total of 1364 adults were\ndischarged from the psychiatric units. Thirteen patients were\nineligible for the study because they were discharged or\ntransferred to correctional care. The east unit discharged 916\n(32.2%). There were similar numbers of females and males\nof stay was 6 days on each unit (IQR 3\u00ad10 days for east unit,\n3\u00ad12 days for west unit). Age was similar in the two units\nApproximately half (53.9%) of the discharged patients\ninitially agreed to participate in the survey. Of these\nparticipants, 84.7% answered at least one question. Two-\nthirds of the respondents (n \u00bc 414, 66.5%) were from the east\nunit, but the participation rates for patients from the two units\nwere similar. Among surveys with at least one question\nanswered, the response rate on individual items ranged from\n82.2% for age to 11.8% for number of times seen by the doctor\nwho recommended marijuana. Based on the skip logic, 54.0%\nof respondents completed all appropriate questions with 62\nrespondents (8.4%) responding to all 15 items. Because of the\nskip logic, the resulting percentages are for varying number\nof respondents, so we report both the number and percentages\nof respondents.\nThe highest survey participation was among young to\nwere between 18 and 44 years. Of those who chose to\nmarijuana use in the past 12 months. Only 133 respondents\n(22.5%) indicated they had never tried marijuana. Marijuana\nuse was common in the 30 days before participation in the\nsurvey, as only 167 respondents (42%) indicated they had not\nindicated they had received medical marijuana that was\nintended for another person.\nSixty respondents (10%) reported having a medical\nmarijuana card. Of the remaining participants, 337 (56%)\nreplied that they did not have a medical marijuana card and\nwithout a medical marijuana card consist of both recreational\nmarijuana users and non-users. Correlates of medical mari-\njuana use were determined by the 397 total patients who\nresponded (Table 2). Males were significantly more likely to\nbe medical marijuana registrants (p \u00bc 0.04). Registrants and\nnon-registrants were of similar age and self-reported problem\nwith alcohol or drugs at similar rates. The age of first\nmarijuana use was significantly different between the cohorts\neven after accounting for those that had never used marijuana\n(p \u00bc 0.03). A larger percentage of registrants did not try\nmarijuana until 25 years old (13% vs. 4%). The use of\nmarijuana within the past year was significantly higher for\nregistrants compared to those who use it recreationally (97%\nsignificantly higher for medical marijuana registrants\n(p50.001), which is primarily due to the lack of use among\nmany non-registrants. After excluding those who did not use\nmarijuana, there was no significant difference in the number\nof days of marijuana use in the past month (p \u00bc 0.07). There\nwas no difference in the usage of medical marijuana that was\nintended for another person between the two cohorts.\nRespondents with a medical marijuana card were pleased\nwith its benefits, with 34 respondents (58.6%) describing\nmedical marijuana as ``very helpful'' and 18 respondents\n(31%) describing it as ``helpful''; only four respondents\n(6.9%) described it as ``very unhelpful'' (Table 3). 44\nrespondents (73.3%) reported that they had not experienced\nside-effects from medical marijuana. Only five patients\n(8.3%) had never tried marijuana before getting their medical\nmarijuana card.\nA total of 44 registrants (78.6%) indicated ``severe pain''\nas the reason that a doctor recommended medical marijuana\nto them. Other common reasons included muscle spasms\n(1.8%) was unsure why the doctor recommended medical\nmarijuana. Some 27 registrants (46.6%) reported spending at\nleast 25 minutes with a doctor during the visit when medical\nmarijuana was recommended. Only five registrants (8.3%)\nreported spending less than 10 minutes with the doctor.\nTwenty-four registrants (42.1%) reported only one visit with\nthe doctor who recommended marijuana, however six patients\nWe are asking people if and how they use marijuana.

Study questionnaire.\n(10.5%) reported at least six visits with the recommending\nphysician.\nDiscussion\nSummary of findings\nThe rate of registration for medical marijuana among our\nrespondents was seven-fold that of the state's general\npopulation. However, the age of registrants and the indication\nfor which they reported being registered roughly correspond\nto the demographics maintained by the state's registry (3).\nThis may suggest that a disproportionate percentage of the\npeople registered to use medical marijuana in Colorado have a\npsychiatric disorder and a history of alcohol- or drug-related\nproblems. Since the use of marijuana has been associated with\ndecline (15), and psychosis (16), medical marijuana systems\nlike Colorado's may be increasing the use of expensive and\nscarce mental health resources like psychiatric\nhospitalization.\nAlternately, the high prevalence of medical marijuana\nregistration may indicate salutary benefits for persons with\nmental illness. In the study, respondents with a medical\nmarijuana card reported good efficacy and excellent toler-\nability of medical marijuana. In addition, a majority of these\nrespondents, 70.7%, also reported spending at least 20\nminutes with the physician who recommended medical\nmarijuana. However, 66.7% of respondents with a medical\nmarijuana card also reported seeing the doctor only once or\ntwice, suggesting these relationships are not ongoing patient-\nTable 1.

The study suggests that many\nregistrants are pleased with the state's medical marijuana\nsystem. Among all respondents, the use of diverted medical\nmarijuana was quite common, with almost a quarter of\nrespondents reporting that someone with a medical marijuana\ncard had shared or sold marijuana to them. Young men with a\nhistory of problems with alcohol or drugs who did not have a\nmedical marijuana card were the most likely to report\nreceiving diverted medical marijuana.\nStudy limitations\nThe generalizability of these findings is limited by collection\nof data from a single site. The sample may skew to people\nwith lower socioeconomic status because of the hospital's\nsocial mission, but socioeconomic data of respondents were\nnot collected. Details about the legal status of the participants\nduring their hospitalization and the mental illness for which\nthey were treated are not available, though this informa-\ntion would help characterize persons using and diverting\nmedical marijuana. Without complete demographic data, it is\nimpossible to know how this study population compares to the\nlarger sample of medical marijuana registrants in the state, but\nthe available data suggests a concordance with what is known\nabout that sample. The study sample was clearly a clinical\nsample rather than a probability sample and does not\nrepresent the general population of Colorado. In addition,\nthis study relies on self-report, so it suffers from sampling\nbias, and thus represents a subset of psychiatric patients who\nwill voluntarily complete an anonymous discharge survey\nwithout compensation. Finally, the study instrument did not\ninclude psychometric data.\nIn general, our survey was limited by the difficulties of\nstudying the medical use of marijuana. Although permitted in\nColorado, the use and possession of marijuana remains a\nfederal crime. Given that we were surveying a vulnerable\npopulation, our survey was necessarily limited to preserve the\nanonymity of our participants. So we did not ask about\nsocioeconomic data or particular diagnoses that could, in\ncombination, compromise a participant's anonymity. While\nthe resulting survey instrument ably protects the anonymity of\nparticipants, it allows for no comparison between participants\nwho did and did not respond to their survey, as well as the\nintriguing relationships between marijuana use and particular\npsychiatric disorders like anxiety, depressive, neurocognitive,\nand psychotic disorders that are associated with marijuana\nuse. Instead, the survey was designed to ask different questions\nof groups with different exposure to marijuana, but its design\nappears to have ultimately reduced completion rates.\nImplications\nThis survey has the largest sample size of any study of\nmedical marijuana use and diversion among persons with\nmental illness and is the first study to assess the prevalence of\nuse and diversion of medical marijuana among adults\nadmitted to an inpatient psychiatry service. It finds that the\nuse of medical marijuana is much higher than in Colorado's\ngeneral population, so the study reminds policy-makers to\nconsider how the legalization of medical marijuana will affect\nmental health systems. Permitting the medical use of mari-\njuana may benefit a subset of patients, and in further studies,\nit would be interesting to ask respondents to characterize how\nmarijuana was helpful and how its benefits and tolerability\ncompare to other treatments they receive. For other patients,\nthe legalization of the medical use of marijuana may increase\nthe need for mental health and substance treatment. It would\nbe helpful, in further studies, to characterize these patients so\nthat policy-makers can determine how to spend medical\nmarijuana tax revenue earmarked for mental health and\nsubstance treatment. In Colorado, this revenue has exceeded\nexpectations and the recent legalization of the recreational use\nof marijuana may ultimately create an additional $100 million\nof tax revenue per year, a portion of which is expected to be\nspent on substance and mental health treatment (25). At\npresent, policy-makers have targeted prevention efforts and\nexclusion criteria at adolescents, because the harms of regular\nmarijuana use are most consistently associated with early and\npersistent use beginning in adolescence (26); this study offers\nsupport for such interventions because only 4% of respondents\nin our study initiated use of marijuana after the age of 25.\nHowever, this study suggests the need to better character-\nize who is harmed and who benefits from increased\naccess to medical marijuana so that public funds can we be\nwell-used.\nTable 3.

While our study sample has\nthe limitations described above, it also documents that at least\nsome persons registered to share medical marijuana are\nsharing or selling their medical marijuana with others. For\nclinicians interested in knowing if a patient is using medical\nmarijuana, it is insufficient to ask if they registered to use\nmedical marijuana; they should also inquire if someone else\nshares or sells medical marijuana to them.\nResearchers should continue to explore the associations\nbetween mental illness and cannabis use, as this study\ndemonstrates a higher use of medical marijuana among\npersons hospitalized with mental illness than in the general\npopulation. In future studies, it is critical to better characterize\nboth participants \u00ad especially with regards to their patterns of\nuse, socioeconomic status, and particular psychiatric dis-\norders \u00ad and the type of marijuana they use. Marijuana is a\ncomplex substance and in future studies, it is critical to assess\nthe amount, dose, duration, and strain of marijuana used by\nparticipants. In addition, researchers should explore whether\nor not the advertising of the medical marijuana industry\ntargets people with mental illnesses, as persons with mental\nillness have been historically targeted by the tobacco industry\n(27). In doing so, further studies could better characterize\nwhen (and how) the medical use of marijuana is harmful and\nhelpful, for persons with mental illnesses.\n"
