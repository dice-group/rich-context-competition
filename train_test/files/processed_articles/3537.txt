High tibial osteotomy (HTO) and knee joint distraction (KJD) are treatments to unload the osteoarthritic (OA)\njoint with proven success in postponing a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). While both treatments demonstrate joint repair,\nthere is limited information about the quality of the regenerated tissue. Therefore, the change in quality of the repaired\ncartilaginous tissue after KJD and HTO was studied using delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of\ncartilage (dGEMRIC). Design. Forty patients (20 KJD and 20 HTO), treated for medial tibiofemoral OA, were included in\nthis study. Radiographic outcomes, clinical characteristics, and cartilage quality were evaluated at baseline, and at 1- and\n2-year follow-up. Results. Two years after KJD treatment, clear clinical improvement was observed. Moreover, a statistically\nsignificant increased medial ( 0.99 mm), minimal ( 1.04 mm), and mean ( 0.68 mm) radiographic joint space width (JSW)\nwas demonstrated. Likewise, medial ( 1.03 mm), minimal ( 0.72 mm), and mean ( 0.46 mm) JSW were statistically\nsignificantly increased on radiographs after HTO. There was on average no statistically significant change in dGEMRIC\nindices over two years and no difference between treatments. Yet there seemed to be a clinically relevant, positive relation\nbetween increase in cartilage quality and patients' experienced clinical benefit. Conclusions. Treatment of knee OA by either\nHTO or KJD leads to clinical benefit, and an increase in cartilage thickness on weightbearing radiographs for over 2 years\nposttreatment. This cartilaginous tissue was on average not different from baseline, as determined by dGEMRIC, whereas\nchanges in quality at the individual level correlated with clinical benefit.\n",

Moreover, life expectancy is increasing, increasing\nthe risk for revision surgery later in life. Therefore, the need\narises for joint preserving strategies.5 Since structural tissue\ndamage is a probable cause for pain and functional limita-\ntion, joint preserving treatment focusses on tissue repair,\naccompanied by clinical benefit.\nHigh tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a well-known joint preserv-\ning procedure to treat unicompartmental knee OAby correct-\ning a deviated mechanical leg-axis, with that unloading the\n1Rheumatology & Clinical Immunology, UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, The\nNetherlands\n2Image Science Institute, UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands\n3ViaSana, Mill, The Netherlands\n4Sint Maartenskliniek, Woerden, The Netherlands\n5Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, The\nNetherlands\n6IJsselland Ziekenhuis, Capelle aan den IJssel, The Netherlands\n7Department of Orthopedics, Haaglanden Medical Centre, Den Haag,\nZuid-Holland, The Netherlands\nCorresponding Author:\nNick J.

KJD is performed by placing an external\nfixation device for 6 weeks, allowing for a renewal of the\njoint homeostasis, where anabolic activity takes over cata-\nbolic activity, providing a more healthy environment\nenabling tissue repair.12,13 Studies have demonstrated a pro-\ngressive decrease in pain, normalization of function, and a\nsustained increase in cartilage thickness as seen on weight-\nresonance imaging (MRI)14,18 evaluation showed cartilage\nrepair after KJD.As a surrogate marker for cartilage quality,\nbiochemical markers for collagen type-II turnover demon-\nstrated an increase of synthesis over release.18 In a prospec-\ntive open uncontrolled study, KJD proved to be successful\nin postponing TKA for at least 5 years in more than 75% of\nthe treated patients.19 Postponing a TKA over 10 years was\nreported to occur in two-third of patients treated with KJD\nbased on data of small groups.20\nHTO and KJD aim to permanently partially (HTO) or\ntemporarily completely (KJD) alleviate the biomechanical\nload on the affected cartilage. Moreover, both treatments\nresult in cartilaginous tissue repair and clinical benefit.\nTherefore, the effects of these treatments were directly com-\npared in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Recently, the\n1-year evaluation of this RCT was reported.21 All patient-\nreported outcome measures were improved after 1 year (P <\n0.02) as well as an increased joint space width (JSW) of the\ncontrast to the HTO group), the lateral compartment also\nshowed an increased JSW, resulting in a statistically signifi-\nFollowing reports of structural repair, the next step is to\nassess cartilage quality, preferably using noninvasive tech-\nniques. Quantitative MRI analysis, in the form of delayed\ngadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of carti-\nlage (dGEMRIC) relies on the relationship between the\nhighly negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and\nthe negatively charged MRI contrast agent gadolinium, pro-\nviding a measure of quality of the cartilaginous tissue, spe-\ncifically with regard to GAG content.22 In OA, the highly\nnegatively charged GAG are lost and when intravenously\ninjected, the MRI contrast agent gadolinium, reaches the\npatients' joints and penetrates the cartilage in an inverse\nproportional manner.22 The qualitative state of the cartilage\nis thereby represented as dGEMRIC indices; low dGEM-\nRIC indices represent low GAG content, namely degener-\nated cartilage, and high dGEMRIC indices higher GAG\ncontent, namely more healthy cartilage.23\nAlthough cartilaginous tissue repair is shown for both\nHTO and KJD, imaging data on cartilage quality are\nscarce. In case of HTO, there is only 1 case report series\npublished and a few studies reporting on dGEMRIC\nmonths9 posttreatment in humans. Although positive\nresults were obtained, none of these studies could confirm\n(statistically) significant cartilage quality changes on\ntreatment with HTO. For KJD such data are not present.\nIn the present explorative study, the change in quality of\nthe repaired cartilaginous tissue two years after KJD or after\nHTO treatment was investigated using dGEMRIC. In addi-\ntion, it was evaluated whether these changes are related to\nradiographic changes and clinical outcome.\nMethods\nPatients\nFor this explorative study patients were included originat-\nknee OAconsidered for HTO according to regular practice,21\nrandomized to either KJD or HTO (1:2) were asked to par-\nticipate in this extended imaging study. Because of the rela-\ntive low number of KJD versus HTO patients, caused by the\nrandomization ratio, KJD patients from an RCT comparing\nTKA with KJD25 were additionally added to this study.\nThese patients were, according to regular practice, consid-\nered for TKA surgery and randomized to either KJD or\nFor both studies, patients younger than 65 years, with\nvarus deformity, Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) score >2,\nintact ligaments, normal range-of-motion (flexion >120\u00b0;\nflexion-limitation <15\u00b0), normal stability, and a body mass\nindex (BMI) <35 kg/m2 were included. Exclusion criteria\nincluded any history of inflammatory- or rheumatoid\narthritis, posttraumatic fibrosis due to fracture of the tibia\nplateau, full bone-to-bone contact (absence of any JSW on\nX-ray), surgical treatment of the involved knee <6 months\nago, and primary (isolated) patella-femoral OA. Patients\nwith an infectious susceptible prosthesis in situ and/or\ncontralateral knee OAthat needed treatment were excluded\nas well.\nAfter patients' written consent to participate in 1 of the\n2 RCTs, they were additionally asked to participate in the\ncurrent study extending the standard MRI measurements\nwith additional imaging modalities, including dGEMRIC\nto measure proteoglycan content/distribution. When com-\nparing the demographics of the original KJD and HTO\ngroups with those of this extended imaging study, only\nthe proportion of males in the HTO group is statistically\nsignificantly higher, which was considered coincidental\n(Table 1).\nBesselink et al. 3\nthe study was performed in accordance with the ethical\nprinciples from the Declaration of Helsinki. The first 20\npatients who gave written informed consent treated with\nHTO and the first 20 patients of both RCTs treated with\nKJD who gave written informed consent were included.\nTreatment\nKJD was performed by placing an external fixation\ndevice, ensuring 5 mm distraction during a period of 6\nweeks.26 In HTO, the aim was to shift the weightbearing\nline laterally, with the postoperative mechanical axis run-\nning laterally through the tibial plateau, at 62% of its\nentire width (measured from the medial side). HTO\npatients were hospitalized for 3 days, followed by 6 weeks\nof limited weightbearing. At 18 months, the plate was\nremoved to allow MRI at 2 years. Treatment radiographs\nare shown in Figure 2. Both joint-preserving treatments\nhave been described in more detail previously26 and in the\nsupplementary file (available in the online version of the\narticle).\nStudy Assessments\nFor the present study, evaluations were performed before\ntreatment (baseline), at 1 years, and at 2 years after treatment.\nPatients undergoing HTO did not undergo dGEMRIC MRI at\n12 months due to the metal-plate in situ.\nFunction and Pain\nClinical effectiveness was determined by the WOMAC\n(Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis\nIndex) 3.0 index derived from the KOOS (Knee injury and\nOsteoarthritis Outcome Score) questionnaire (self-assess-\nment reduced from 5 to 3 dimensions and using a 5-point\nLikert-type scale, normalizing to a 100-point scale, where\n100 is no pain). Pain was measured by a visual analogue\nscale (VAS-Pain), a continuous scale ranging from 0 (no\npain) to 100 (worst imaginable pain), on which the patient\nindicated the amount of pain.\nWeightbearing Radiographs and Joint Space\nWidth Measurements\nStandardized semiflexed weightbearing radiographs were\nacquired at inclusion and 2 years after treatment to deter-\nmine the K-L grade (K-L at baseline) according to a stan-\ndardized protocol and to evaluate changes in JSW over time\nusing Knee Images Digital Analysis (KIDA) software,27\n(single experienced observer) expressed in 4 JSW mea-\nsures; mean medial, and mean lateral JSW, mean of the total\njoint (mean JSW), and minimal JSW of the total joint.

As expected considering the original inclusion,21 age, and baseline Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) score were\nstatistically significant higher in the KJD group than in the HTO group. Also lateral JSW was higher for the KJD group, which was considered a coincidence. No other statistical differences were\nobserved.

The 3-dimensional\nimaging protocol consisted of a sagittal inversion recovery\nfast spoiled gradient-recalled echo (FSPGR) sequence with\ntional phantom experiment (data not shown) showed that no\nsignificant variations in measured T1 values were present\nover the range of slices analyzed in our study. The repetition\ntime (TR) was 10 ms. Other parameters were: flip angle = 15\u00b0,\nan intravenous injection of 0.2 mM/kg gadolinium-based\ncontrast agent (Gd-DTPA; Magnevist by Bayer Schering\nPharma). Subsequently, patients performed a standardized light\nexercise, by walking a predefined route for approximately\n15 minutes, and rested until 90 minutes after contrast infu-\nsion before the MRI scan was made (dGEMRIC sequences\nincluding scout images took 20 minutes and 30 seconds).\ndGEMRIC Index Estimation\nSegmentation was performed on dGEMRIC images of\nevery patient, acquired at baseline and follow up by 2 inde-\npendent observers (NB, AC), blinded for time point and\ntreatment. This segmentation provided a total of 12 regions\nof interest (ROIs), divided in anterior (a), central (c) and\nposterior (p) regions of the tibia (T) or femur (F) on the\nmedial (M) or lateral (L) side of the knee (Fig. 3). ROIs\nwere manually delineated on the sagittal images obtained in\nthe dGEMRIC scan with inversion time of 1650 ms (TI =\n1650 ms) according to the method described by Eckstein\net al.24,28 The central and both adjacent slices through both\ntibiofemoral joint compartments were manually selected.\nROIs were delineated, using in-house developed software\n(ImageXplorer, Image Sciences Institute).\nPhase-corrected real data reconstruction (allowing for\nnoise reduction), and image registration were performed on\nthe 3-dimensional images with 5 different inversion time\nEventually, all sequences were rigidly transformed to TI =\n1650 ms using an intensity-based image registration, and\nalignment was visually inspected.\nThe average dGEMRIC index refers to the longitudinal\nrelaxation time in the presence of gadolinium-based con-\ntrast agent.

Posteroanterior radiographs of knee joint distraction (left) and high tibial osteotomy (right).\nthe Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least-squares method\nwith in-house developed software (R2015a, The\nMathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) produced a reconstructed\nT1 map. From this T1 map, the average dGEMRIC index\nwas calculated for each compartment and ROI separately.\nThe dGEMRIC index map was then superimposed onto the\nscan acquired for TI = 1650 ms, see Figure 4. A color scale\nwas used, representing the condition of the cartilage, rang-\ning from degenerated toward healthy (low GAG content\nresults in a low dGEMRIC index, and vice versa).\nStatistical Analysis\nChanges in WOMAC, VAS Pain, radiographic JSW, and\ndGEMRIC signal (per side and region) were presented\nusing mean with SD or median with interquartile range.\nWOMAC, VAS Pain, and JWS changes were evaluated\n(without correction for multiple testing) by paired t tests\nand differences in changes scores between KJD and HTO\nusing independent tests.\nTo account for clustering of dGEMRIC indices within\nthe different regions analyzed, changes in dGEMRIC\nscores from baseline to follow-up, over all regions were\nanalyzed using multilevel analysis (i.e., a linear mixed-\neffects model) with a random intercept at region level. In\nthis analysis, the average change in dGEMRIC indices\nover time was estimated, as well as the effect of treatment\nand of side (medial or lateral) on this change. The associa-\ntion of change in dGEMRIC indices with change in\nWOMAC, change in JSW, and modification of these asso-\nciations by side and by treatment was also evaluated with\nmultilevel analysis and if relevant, based on size of regres-\nsion coefficient of the interaction term and a P < 0.20, sub-\ngroup analyses were performed.\nAll tests were 2-sided, and a probability of P < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant unless specified other-\nwise. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS\n(Version 21.0. IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).\nResults\nPatients\nThree out of 20 KJD and 2 out of 20 HTO patients were lost\nto follow-up due to conversion to HTO (in case of KJD) or\ntotal knee arthroplasty (TKA; in case of HTO) within 2\nyears (Fig. 1). In addition, 1 KJD patient had severe motion\nartifacts in the dGEMRIC acquisition. As the HTO patients\nall have medial compartment OA, 2 KJD patients with pre-\ndominantly lateral compartmental OA were excluded to\nallow for a proper comparison between groups. This\nresulted in a total of 14 KJD and 18 HTO patients analyzed\n(see Fig. 1). Baseline characteristics of these patients are\ngiven in Table 1. There were no statistically significant dif-\nferences in dGEMRIC indices at baseline between the KJD\nand the HTO patients.\nClinical and Radiographic Changes after HTO or\nKJD\nOne and 2 years after either treatment, a statistically signifi-\ncant increase in WOMAC and decrease in VAS-Pain com-\npared with baseline was observed (Fig. 5).

After 2\nyears, a statistically significant increase in mean JSW after\nHTO was observed, which was not present at 1-year follow-\nup yet. JSW findings were substantiated by volumetric\ncartilage assessments of the delineated cartilage, total knee\nvolume increases after both KJD and HTO, ruling out\nbiasing of JSW changes by an altered mechanical axis (both\nFigure 3.

However, at 1 year\nafter treatment, these parameters were statistically significant\ndifferent for medial JSW change (KJD:  1.28 mm, HTO: \ndGEMRIC Evaluation\nInterobserver reproducibility of the segmentation process\nwas evaluated by comparing the average dGEMRIC values\nof the ROIs (Supplementary Figure 1). The interobserver\nreproducibility was high (intraclass correlation coefficient\n[ICC] = 0.96); therefore, dGEMRIC indices of both observ-\ners were averaged for all further analyses. Average absolute\n(and relative) changes in dGEMRIC values of the different\nmedial and lateral compartments and subregions of the tibia\nand femur from baseline to 1-year and 2-year follow-up are\nshown in Table 2 and are generally small (on average 3.4%).\nIn the multilevel analysis, the overall average dGEM-\ndependent on baseline dGEMRIC indices.

Delta scores might deviate from the difference between time points due to missing dGEMRIC indices for specific ROIs at\nspecific time points. Missing indices can, for example, be caused by cartilage being reduced to a volume so small, it is insufficient for dGEMRIC analysis.\nFor this study, patients were included originating from 2\nseparate RCTs. There were differences in baseline charac-\nteristics (of inclusion criteria) for those 2 RCTs, which was\nreflected in the extended imaging cohort where a higher age\nand a more severe K-L grade for KJD at baseline as com-\npared with HTO was found. This can be explained by the\nfact that part of the included KJD patients (10 out of 20)\nwere originally considered for TKA, and these patients gen-\nerally suffer from more severe OA than patients considered\nfor HTO. The current study might be underpowered to pro-\nvide final conclusive answers due to the relative low num-\nbers of patients included. Despite these limitations, these\nare the first data on comparing cartilage quality between\nthese regenerative treatments.\nOne of the main reasons for patients to undergo treatment\nof an OA knee is to alleviate pain and recover function.\nEven in this small study, both are achieved as seen in the\nclear decrease in VAS-Pain and increase in WOMAC\nscores, 1 year after treatment and maintained for another\nyear, after either KJD or HTO. Interestingly, despite minor\nchanges in dGEMRIC signal, for the overall group, change\nin WOMAC score was positively associated with a change\nin dGEMRIC indices, independent of side or of treatment,\nimplying a clinically relevant correlation between increase\nin cartilage quality as determined by dGEMRIC and\npatients' experienced clinical benefit. The mechanism\nbehind this interrelation can only be speculated on.\nAfter correction for baseline dGEMRIC indices over all\nROIs, no statistically significant differences between HTO\nand KJD on change in dGEMRIC values were found. On\naverage, there is a decrease in medial and an increase in lat-\neral dGEMRIC indices for HTO patients.

Evaluating modification of the association between JSW change and\ndGEMRIC change by side in the regression model also indicated that effect modification may be present (regression coefficient: 14.62, P = 0.20), thus\nall further analyses were stratified by side. Hereafter, modification of the association between JSW change with dGEMRIC change by treatment was\nevaluated (regression coefficient of -30.57, P = 0.03), justifying additional stratification by treatment.\ndA statistically significant effect for side of the knee (P < 0.001) and treatment (P < 0.001) was found. Evidence for modification of the association\nbetween change in WOMAC and dGEMRIC change by side or by treatment was not found (WOMAC * side: P = 0.71, and WOMAC * treatment: P =\n0.42), thus the group was not stratified for treatment and/or side.\nGAG content at the lateral compartment after HTO and\ndecrease at the medial compartment might be the result of\nwedging of the joint after HTO, resulting in a slight lateral\ncompression and a slight medial decompression, and with\nthat relative (apparent) change in GAG signal. This is sup-\nported by a study demonstrating the sensitivity of dGEMRIC\nvalues to cartilage compression and unloading.33 Change in\ndGEMRIC indices are, on average, all quite small, represent-\ning relative small changes in cartilage quality over 2 years.\nThe assumption of compression of the lateral compartment is\nhowever not supported by the observation that a significant\nrelation between a decrease in lateral JSW and a decrease in\ncartilage quality (dGEMRIC indices) was found in specifi-\ncally the lateral compartment of HTO patients. This positive\nassociation between change in JSW and change in dGEM-\nRIC signal in specifically the lateral compartment indicates\nthat in case of an increasing lateral joint space width, despite\nwedging of the whole joint, quality of cartilage (higher\ndGEMRIC score) improves in these cases, over 2 years. So,\nthis might represent actual improvement of quality accompa-\nnying an increase in JSW. However, the fact that this is only\nfound in the lateral compartment on only HTO treatment and\nthat absolute changes are small argues its relevance.\nNo statistically significant relation between structural\nchange and dGEMRIC change in KJD patients was found.\ndGEMRIC values are expected to improve only if cartilage\ndamage is at the early stage, whereas if the collagen structure\nis already compromised, a replenishment of GAGs becomes\nmore difficult, which could explain the statistically signifi-\ncant influence of baseline dGEMRIC values on the change\nover time. The lack of statistically significant or consistent\nchange in dGEMRIC values for KJD, together with the clear\nincrease in JSW, suggests that the tissue quality in KJD\npatients, on average, including the newly formed, is main-\ntained. It might be argued whether this quality is sufficient, as\nbaseline values are obtained from presumably impaired carti-\nlage tissue in a severely damaged OA joint. Unfortunately,\nthe dGEMRIC signal of the baseline condition of the treated\njoints was not compared with the contralateral healthy joint.\nSince dGEMRIC values are expected to decrease over time\nin damaged joints, although no data are available, the mainte-\nnance of cartilage quality over time could be considered a\npositive finding. KJD and HTO may have been useful in\nstopping further cartilage degeneration, indicated by minor\nor absent changes in dGEMRIC indices. The question\nremains whether there is an increase in cartilage quality of\nthe residual tissue with newly formed tissue of inferior qual-\nity, whether the new tissue is of similar quality as the residual\nunchanged tissue, or whether it is residual cartilage tissue\nthat has decompressed and thereby showed an apparent\ndecrease in quality (lower GAG content per volume).\nIt was subjectively observed that cartilage quality in the\ndeeper layers (on to the bone) seemed to improve over two\nyears (representative image shown in Supplementary Figure\n2). In the original MRI KJD studies, it was demonstrated\nthat newly formed tissue is largely filling up denuded bone\nareas, thus cartilaginous tissue is formed in the deep\nlayers.34 This is suggestive of newly formed quality tissue,\nfilling in denuded bone area's but is far from conclusive.\nWith regard to the dGEMRIC imaging technique; a\nseries of scans, acquired with different echo times, is neces-\nsary to calculate dGEMRIC indices. Increased scanning\ntimes increase the risk of patient motion in between\nsequences (repositioning), potentially decreasing the effi-\ncacy of the fitting. Repositioning effects in our study were\nminimized by implementing image registration.35\nLongitudinal evaluation of cartilage repair, such as repre-\nsented in this explorative study, assume equal distribution\nof gadolinium within the joint. Although our contrast proto-\ncol is very strict, variations are inevitable, amongst others\nbecause of heterogeneous uptake of gadolinium in repair\ntissue over time, influenced not only by GAG content but\nalso patient motion, water content, and permeability of\ntissue.36,37 Note that it takes also quite some time for the\ncontrast to distribute throughout the body. This variation\nmay add to the inability to detect small changes over time.\nGAG concentration is, given its substantial contribution\nto load-bearing, a good measure to distinguish healthy from\ndegenerated tissue.22 However, studies have shown that\nsome results cannot be explained by GAG measurements\nalone, but might be found in a combination of several quan-\ntitative MRI techniques, morphological, and clinical evalu-\nation.22,38 dGEMRIC is considered a valuable tool in\nevaluating cartilage quality, but there are also alternative\nMRI techniques available to assess cartilage quality, such as\nAll limitations of dGEMRIC imaging considered in gen-\neral and in this specific small size study, implementation of\na strict contrast administration protocol, minimized patient\nmotion during acquisition, postprocessing image registra-\ntion, and minimal variation between observers should be\nsufficient to consider dGEMRIC indices as representative\nfor cartilage quality with respect to GAG content/distribu-\ntion in this study. Assuming this, despite the limited number\nof patients, it might be concluded that cartilaginous repair\non HTO and KJD is not accompanied by further decrease in\nGAG content. Future studies powered to elucidate potential\ndifferences between HTO and KJD treatment on dGEMRIC\nindices should be performed to support current findings and\nprovide conclusive answers.\nSummarizing, the significant clinical benefit and increase\nin radiographic JSW 1 year after treatment of medial com-\npartmental OA by either HTO or KJD, maintains through-\nout the second year of follow-up, postponing the natural OA\nprogression rate and with that knee arthroplasty. There\nseems to be a clinically relevant relation between the\nincrease in cartilage quality as determined by dGEMRIC\nand patients' experienced clinical benefit determined by\nWOMAC. Assuming natural deterioration of the cartilage\ntissue seen in osteoarthritis patients, is reflected in loss of\nGAG and therefore also applies to a decrease in dGEMRIC\nindices, KJD and HTO may contribute to regeneration of\ncartilaginous tissue with maintenance of cartilage quality,\nand thereby delaying the degeneration process.\nAuthors' Note\nFunding sources had no role in study design, collection, analysis\nor interpretation of the data, writing of the manuscript or in the\ndecision to submit the manuscript for publication.\n"
