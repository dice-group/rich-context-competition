In\nof obesity increased in children from all race/ethnic groups;\nhowever, the percentage increase was greater for non-Hispanic\nblack and Mexican American children and adolescents (2,3). In\na recent assessment of change in prevalence of obesity from\namong Mexican American and non-Hispanic black adolescents\n12\u00ad19 y of age far exceeded that observed in non-Hispanic white\nadolescents (1). Higher adiposity in children is a predictor of a\nvariety of adverse health outcomes (4\u00ad6); in minority children,\nchildhood and adolescent body weight track with adult body\nweight to a greater extent than in non-Hispanic white children\nComplex interactions of biological and environmental fac-\ntors, including diet, determine energy balance and contribute to\nethnic differentials in body weight (8). Ethnic differences in\ndietary patterns reflect a confluence of cultural beliefs and food\npractices modified by the social, economic, and environmental\ncontexts of food desirability, affordability, and availability (9).\nKumanyika (9) has argued that a study of dietary behaviors of\ndifferent ethnic groups not only helps in identifying behaviors as-\nsociated with higher body weight in the high-risk ethnic groups\nbut also provides information about which behaviors may have\ncausal associations with body weight for the population as a\nwhole. Assessment of time trends in possible ethnic differentials\nin dietary behaviors also sheds light on whether the changing\nfood norms, availability, and marketplace have a differential\nimpact on different ethnic groups. Such knowledge is necessary\nfor the identification, design, and targeting of suitable interven-\ntions to achieve the goal of elimination of health disparities that\nare part of the national health promotion agenda.\nSeveral prior studies have made important contributions to\nour understanding of changing dietary profiles of American children\n(10\u00ad37).

Other\nstudies mentioned above have examined selected age groups\n(25\u00ad37). A comprehensive picture of dietary and meal attributes\nis important to appreciate whether the observed dietary changes\ntrack with other possible compensatory or complementary die-\ntary and meal behaviors, yet few of the previous studies provide\nthis information.\nTherefore, to understand the possible contribution of dietary\nbehaviors to different race/ethnic trajectories of weight gain,\nwe examined race/ethnic differences in 20-y time trends (from\nAmericans children and adolescents using multivariable methods\nto adjust for family income and education.\nMethods\nTo answer the above question, we analyzed public domain data from the\nQueens College institutional review board for protection of human\nparticipants with an exempt review. The NHANES is conducted by the\nNCHS and consists of a nationally representative, stratified, multistage,\nprobability sample of the U.S. population. The NHANES III (1988\u00ad\nbecame a continuous annual survey and data are released for 2 combined\nyears at a time. Each survey included a home interview of the sample\nperson and an examination in the MEC6. The examination components\nincluded a complete physical exam, anthropometry, and a dietary inter-\nview. The unweighted response rates for the MEC examined sample of\nand 75%, respectively (38). The response rates for the ages examined\nin the current analysis (2\u00ad19 y) were generally higher than the rates\nmentioned above. The NHANES III oversampled 2\u00ad5 y olds and black\nand Mexican American populations; surveys conducted from 1999 to\n2006 oversampled low-income persons, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican\ndid not include a large enough sample of Mexican Americans as an\nethnic group to provide reliable estimates; therefore, these surveys were\nnot included in the present analysis.\nRace/ethnicity information in each survey\nRespondents to each survey self-reported race/ethnicity; for public\ndomain release, the NCHS provides variables that combine race and\nethnicity by adjudicating the available information. The public release\nMexican American, and other race/ethnic categories. The other category\nincludes Hispanics who were not Mexican Americans and all other\nethnic groups. The present analyses included non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, and Mexican American race/ethnic groups.\nDietary information\ninformation using an interviewer-administered, computer-assisted, 24-h\ndietary recall interview. For children 2\u00ad5 y of age, the recall was provided\nby parents or other caregivers; recalls of 6\u00ad11 y olds were self-reported\nwith assistance from parents or other caregivers; and 12\u00ad19 y olds self-\nreported their intake (38). In the NHANES III, the dietary recall was\ncollected using a 3-step procedure that changed to a 4-step process in\nsurvey year. In 2002, the NHANES was integrated with the USDA food\nconsumption surveys as part of \"What We Eat in America\" protocol\nThe NHANES III and publicly available dietary data for the NHANES\nused the first recall for all surveys. The NHANES III survey used the\nused the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (ver-\nsions 1\u00ad4.1) (41) to code and estimate the nutrient content of foods and\nbeverages reported in these surveys.\nAnalytic sample\nFor each survey, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican\nAmerican children and adolescents 2\u00ad19 y of age with a dietary recall\nconsidered by the NCHS to be complete and acceptable (38) were\neligible for inclusion in the analytic sample for this study (NHANES III,\n9749). From this eligible sample, we excluded pregnant and lactating\nand education level of head of household (NHANES III, n = 918;\npregnancy and lactation information was not available in the public\nexcluded from the analytic sample. The final analytic sample size was:\nDietary and meal intake variables\nTo obtain a comprehensive picture of dietary profiles, we examined 3\ntypes of dietary variables in this study: diet quantity and composition,\nfood form, and meal patterns. The decision to examine these variables\nwas based on the current speculation in the literature about the possible\nroles of food portions, energy density, sweetened beverages, and\nsnacking as contributors to increasing body weights of U.S. children\n(8,9). Therefore, in our presentation and narrative of results and their\ninterpretation, we considered energy intake, amount (grams) of foods\nand beverages, percent energy from beverages, and number of eating\noccasions as \"key dietary outcomes\" and all other dietary attributes as\n\"secondary dietary outcomes.\"\nDiet quantity and composition. These included total energy, percent-\nage of energy from macronutrients, dietary fiber, amount (g) of all\nreported foods and beverages, and energy density (energy content/g) of\nall foods and beverages and of foods only.\nFood form. To examine hypotheses related to the association of food\nform (liquid vs. solid), we created variables that identified all beverages\nand nonbeverage foods in the recall. Using previously reported methods,\nall types of liquid milk, 100% juices, juice drinks, shakes, infant formula,\ncarbonated beverages, coffee and tea, and alcohol, etc. were considered\nas beverages (42). Plain tap or bottled water (unsweetened) was not\nconsidered a beverage for this purpose. From this group, juice drinks,\ncarbonated or noncarbonated beverages, coffee or tea, and alcohol were\nconsidered non-nutritive beverages. The variables created examined the\ntotal amount (g) and the percent of 24-h energy intake from foods and\nbeverages.\nMeal intake. The number of eating occasions was determined from\nnumber of discrete clock times any food, beverage, or their combinations\nwere reported in the dietary recall. All foods or beverages reported at one\nclock time (e.g. as part of a meal) were considered one eating occasion.\nWe have used these methods in our previous examination of trends in\nadults (43). Eating occasions when the only reported item was plain\nwater or unsweetened bottled water were not counted as eating occasions.\nIn the recall, respondents were asked to name each eating occasion. Using\npreviously published methods, occasions named as breakfast, desayuno,\n6 Abbreviations used: AMPM, automated multiple pass method; EI:BEE, energy\nintake:estimated basal energy expenditure; MEC, mobile examination center;\nNCHS, National Center for Health Statistics; PIR, poverty income ratio.\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nor almuerzo were considered breakfast (44). Eating occasions named as\nsnack, drink, other, or equivalents in Spanish were considered a snack\n(43). Eating occasions not named as snack or other were considered main\nmeals and included breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, supper, or equiv-\nalents in Spanish. The percent of 24-h energy intake from main meals,\nsnacks/other, and that reported at or after 1700 h was computed for each\nBecause of reports of the occurrence of low-energy reporting in\nnational surveys, we also compared the ratio of reported EI:BEE. The\nBEE was computed using age-sex-BMI-for-sex-age percentile specific\nequations developed by the committee on Dietary Reference Intakes\n(45). We considered an EI:BEE ratio of ,0.92 to indicate low energy\nreporting. Because new recommended methods for the determination of\nimplausible dietary reports could not be implemented for all surveys\nincluded in our analyses (46), the cutoff used was based on methods de-\nscribed by Goldberg et al. (47) and has been used by other investigators\nStatistical analyses\nNCHS recommends combining data from the recent 2-y NHANES\ncycles to provide more reliable estimates for subgroup analyses (49).\nThe age range from 2 to 19 y includes a wide range of developmental\nstages, varying degree of family, social, and environmental influences, the\nextent of autonomy in food selection, and age differences in prevalence\nof adiposity. Therefore, our analyses were stratified by the age categories\nthe age categories used for reporting of NHANES body weight data by\nthe NCHS (1) and also reflect the age differences in respondents for the\ndietary recall.\nWe used multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses for\ncontinuous and dichotomous dependent variables, respectively, to ex-\namine the independent association of each dietary attribute with race-\nethnicity across surveys in analyses stratified by age group (2\u00ad5, 6\u00ad11,\nand 12\u00ad19 y). These analyses included each dietary/meal characteristic\nas a continuous or dichotomous outcome and the covariates potentially\nrelated to race/ethnicity and diet as independent variables. Because race/\nethnic group membership in the US is correlated with family income and\nlevel of education (50), all regression analyses included variables for\nfamily income as PIR and education level of head of household. Other\ncovariates that are possibly differentially distributed among surveys and\nrace/ethnic groups included day of week of dietary intake, season of\nMEC exam, country of birth of household reference person, household\nsize, and BMI for gender-age percentile based on 2000 CDC growth\ncharts (51). The multiple regression models thus included dummy\nvariables for race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black,\nand Mexican American), the covariates (mentioned above), and varia-\n2008) as independent variables. In this analysis, the combined surveys\nindependent samples representing the U.S. population corresponding to\nthe time period of each survey. We tested whether the trends in dietary\ncharacteristics across surveys among race/ethnic groups were similar by\ntesting the interaction of race/ethnicity and survey using models in which\nsurvey was either categorical or as a scored variable for survey year,\nwhere the midpoint of the time span of the survey is the score.\nTo enable interpretation of race/ethnic and survey effects when\nsignificant race/ethnicity by survey interactions were not present, we\ntested the main effects of race/ethnicity and survey using the above\nregression models without the race/ethnicity by survey interaction term.\nFor uniformity and descriptive purposes, we provided estimates of the\nadjusted means and proportions of dietary outcomes for each race and\nsurvey combination (obtained from models that included a race by\nsurvey interaction term) and main effects of race/ethnicity and survey\n(obtained from models without the interaction term), adjusted for other\ncovariates in the multivariable regression (52,53). For energy intake, we\nreanalyzed the regression models after excluding respondents with a\nlow EI:BEE ratio. Wald F tests were used for all statistical tests, with level\nof significance set at P # 0.05 (53). The reported P values for tests of\nsignificance are not adjusted for multiple comparisons; this criterion of\nsignificance is used as a guide to identify dietary relationships of potential\ninterest. Multiple comparisons increase the probability of finding signif-\nicant associations; therefore, the reported P values should be interpreted\nwith caution.\nWe followed NCHS recommendations for sample weights applicable\nto analyses from combined surveys (49). This weighting produced esti-\nmates that represented the population included in each individual survey.\nThese analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.2 (RTI) and SAS-\ncallable SUDAAN (54) to adjust for the complex, stratified sample design\nResults\nCharacteristics of the population. Relative to the other 2\nrace/ethnic groups, a slightly higher proportion of Mexican\nAmericans were 2\u00ad5 y of age and a slightly lower proportion\nand .50% of Mexican American household head or reference\npersons had ,12 y of education and ;40% had a family PIR ,1\nin all surveys. Over 50% of Mexican American household\nreference persons were born in countries other than the US.\nThe following narrative of results related to the study\nquestion is divided into 2 parts. The first part is focused on\nkey dietary outcomes of energy intake, amount (g) of foods and\nbeverages, percent of 24-h energy from beverages, and number\n(Fig. 1\u00ad3; Supplemental Tables 1\u00ad3). The second part summa-\nrizes findings about secondary dietary outcomes of percent of\n24-h energy from macronutrients; fiber (g); amount of foods;\namount of beverages; percent of 24-h energy from foods and\nnonnutritive beverages; energy density of foods; mention of\nbreakfast; mention of a snack; percent of 24-h energy from main\nmeals or snacks and at or after 1700 h (Supplemental Tables 4\u00ad\n6). For all dietary outcomes, first we described the results of race\nby survey interactions; for dietary outcomes without significant\nrace by survey interaction, we presented the main effect of race/\nethnicity across all surveys combined (Supplemental Tables 1\u00ad6).\nFor context, we provided information on BMI in Figures 1\u00ad3 and\nSupplemental Tables 3\u00ad6.\nTime trends in self-reported dietary outcomes\nDid the association of race/ethnicity with key dietary out-\ncomes (energy intake, amount of foods and beverages,\npercent of 24-h energy from beverages, and number of\nall age groups, the interaction of race/ethnicity and survey was\nnot significant for total energy intake, the amount (g) of foods\nand beverages, and percent of 24-h energy from beverages\nAlthough the reported number of eating occasions increased over\ntime in all race/ethnic groups, the secular increase in non-Hispanic\nrelative to non-Hispanic whites (P for race by survey interaction\n# 0.02). A similar trend was also noted for percent energy from\nbeverages in 12\u00ad19 y old non-Hispanic blacks.\nWas there a main effect of race/ethnicity for key dietary\noutcomes? In all age groups, the race/ethnic differences in\nmean energy intakes were not significant; however, the mean\namounts of foods and beverages differed among race/ethnic\ngroups, with non-Hispanic whites reporting the highest and the\nnon-Hispanic blacks reporting the lowest amounts (marginals in\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nSupplemental Tables 1\u00ad3). The mean percent of 24-h energy\nintake from beverages also differed among race/ethnic groups\nfor 2\u00ad5 and 6\u00ad11 y olds, with non-Hispanic blacks reporting the\nlowest percentage (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).\nDid the association of race/ethnicity with secondary\ndietary outcomes [percent of 24-h energy from macronu-\ntrients; fiber (g); amount of foods; amount of beverages;\npercent of 24-h energy from foods and nonnutritive\nbeverages; energy density of foods; mention of breakfast;\nmention of a snack; percent of 24-h energy from main\ndietary fiber intake (also noted in 6\u00ad11 y olds) and the reported\namount of foods (only) was greater in non-Hispanic blacks\nrelative to other race/ethnic groups (Supplemental Tables 4\u00ad5).\nAmong adolescents 12\u00ad19 y of age, the interactions of race and\nsurvey were significant for several dietary outcomes [percent of\nenergy from fat and carbohydrate, percent of 24-h energy intake\nfrom foods (only) and nonnutritive beverages, percent reporting\nbreakfast, and percent of energy reported at or after 1700 h]\n(Supplemental Table 6). The decline in percent of energy from\nfat and foods (only) and increase in percent energy from\ncarbohydrate and nonnutritive beverages was larger and signif-\nicant in non-Hispanic blacks relative to non-Hispanic whites.\nWas there a main effect of race/ethnicity for secondary\ndietary outcomes? With a few exceptions, significant race/\nethnic differences for a majority of the secondary dietary out-\ncomes were observed at all ages (marginals in Supplemental\nlikely to mention a snack in the recall and reported lower mean\nnumber of snacks relative to non-Hispanic whites (Supplemental\nTABLE 1 Characteristics of 2\u00ad19 y old children and adolescents, by race/ethnicity and by survey, NHANES III, NHANES\nNon-Hispanic white Non-Hispanic black Mexican American\nAge group, %\nEducation of household head\nor reference person, %\nFamily PIR, %\nHousehold size, %\nCountry of birth of household\nreference person, %\nPercentile of BMI specific for\ngender and age, %\nWeekday of recalled\ndietary intake, %\nMonth of MEC exam, %\n1 Values are percent or mean 6 SE.

The race/ethnicity differences (main effect) in percent with\n$85th BMI percentile or mean BMI were significant (marginals\nin Supplemental Tables 4\u00ad6).\nIn regression analyses that excluded respondents with a low\nEI:BEE ratio, the adjusted mean energy intakes were expectedly\nhigher, but race/ethnic differentials and trends were similar to\nestimates without exclusions (Supplemental Table 7). Similar\nresults were observed for amounts of foods and beverages,\npercent of 24-h energy from beverages, and energy density of\nfoods (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nThe most popular dietary hypotheses for explaining increasing\nadiposity of American children and adolescents are secular\nincreases in portion sizes, number of eating occasions, sweetened\nbeverage consumption, and energy density of foods (8,9). The\nonly hypothesis unequivocally supported by the present study is\nthat of a secular increase in the number of eating occasions in\nchildren and adolescents of all race/ethnic backgrounds. How-\never, the relative importance of this observation is open to debate\ngiven that the increase in eating occasions was not accompanied\nby the expected secular increase in energy intake and amount of\nfoods and beverages (expected because of possible increases in\nportion sizes). To our knowledge, few other studies have\nexamined race/ethnic diet trends over the time period examined\nin this study to make informed comparisons.\nThe observed secular changes in dietary behaviors were small\nand their direction was generally similar in all race/ethnic\ngroups. However, there is a suggestion of a somewhat larger\nwhites of all ages reported the highest number of eating\nincline was steeper, leading to convergence and narrowing of the\ndifferences in breakfast reporting by 12\u00ad19 y olds were not\ndecline in the percent of non-Hispanic blacks and an increase in\nthe percent of Mexican Americans who reported breakfast.\nNon-Hispanic black and Mexican American adolescents in-\ncreased their intake of energy from carbohydrate and decreased\ntheir energy intake from fat so that race differences in these\nHowever, in these adolescents, given the larger decline in dietary\nfiber over time and the significant secular increase in percent\nenergy from all beverages or nonnutritive beverages (in non-\nHispanic black adolescents), the higher percent of carbohydrate\nenergy does not indicate improved dietary selections. These\nresults collectively suggest that relative changes in adoption of\npossibly adverse dietary behaviors affected non-Hispanic black\nadolescents to a greater extent. Overall, therefore, the apparent\nconvergence of trends in many dietary attributes appeared to be\nnot due to greater improvement of behavior in non-Hispanic\nblacks but due to greater worsening of dietary behaviors.\nDespite widely held beliefs about large increases in beverage\nconsumption in the U.S. population, the relative mean contri-\nValues are adjusted means and proportions 6 SE obtained from multivariable regression models with each dietary variable as the dependent\nvariable.

These are presented when there was a\nsignificant race/ethnicity by survey interaction.\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nbution of energy from all beverages, nonnutritive beverages, and\nfoods changed little across surveys. At all ages, there were\nsignificant race/ethnic differences in percent energy from bever-\nages, non-Hispanic blacks reported a lower percentage of daily\nenergy from beverages and a higher percentage from foods in all\nsurveys. However, these differences in beverage intake were not\nsimilarly reflected in race/ethnic differences in total energy\nintake. We note that our analytic approach differs from that used\nin previous analyses that found total energy intake of consumers\nof sweetened beverages to be higher than that of nonconsumers\n(55). In children and adolescents of all races/ethnicities, the\nreported percent of 24-h energy from nonnutritive beverages in\nan aberration or a possible beginning of a downward trend in\nconsumption of these beverages (due to heightened awareness of\ntheir poor nutritional quality) or reporting bias (due to social\nundesirability of their consumption) cannot be deduced from the\navailable data. We await other recent independent estimates of\nconsumption of non-nutritive beverages to assess if the tide is\nturning.\nTo our knowledge, the only study to publish estimates of\ndietary energy density in children from different race/ethnicity\nfound that non-Hispanic black children had higher energy\ndensity (56). However, these estimates were based on dietary\nenergy density defined to include all foods plus beverages. Our\nresults suggest that due to lower overall beverage intake of non-\nHispanic black children and adolescents (a consistent finding in\nall age groups), examination of energy density of foods (only) is\nmore informative about the nature of foods selected. Using this\ndefinition (foods only), non-Hispanic black adolescents, but not\nyounger children, did consistently report foods of higher energy\ndensity at each examined time period. This may reflect a\npreference for certain types of foods that adolescents may\nexpress with increasing autonomy about food selections.\nWe note that although all NHANES used in the current\nanalyses collected dietary information using a computer-assisted\nonwards (38). To our knowledge, there are no published\nbridging studies to determine the contribution of change in\nmethodology to population estimates. Nevertheless, it is gener-\nally accepted that the AMPM for collecting dietary recall,\nimplemented in 2002, have improved the completeness of the\nrecall (57,58). However, the published validation studies of the\nAMPM have studied adults and not children and adolescents. If\nwe accept that the newer recall methods have improved the\ncompleteness of recalled intake, we should expect the amount of\nfoods and beverages and total energy intake to be higher in later\nsurveys. However, we observed no such trends. Nevertheless, we\nwere mindful of the potential methodological differences and\nconfine our narrative of results and discussion to whether the\nassociation of race/ethnicity and diet changed over time. In each\nsurvey, dietary assessment methods used for all race/ethnic\ngroups were the same; therefore, our approach allows valid\nconclusions about this primary study objective.\nThe dietary and meal attributes reported in this paper were\nderived from a single 24-h recall. Because of intra-individual\nvariability of food intake, estimates from a single 24-h recall are\nnot appropriate for the estimation of usual intakes of individ-\nuals, examination of population distributions of usual intake, or\nprevalence of nutrient adequacy; therefore, we did not attempt\nValues are adjusted means or proportions 6 SE obtained from multivariable regression models with each dietary variable as the dependent\nvariable. The independent variables were: race/ethnicity, age, gender, family poverty income ratio, education of head of household, day of dietary\nrecall, month of mobile examination center exam, household size, country of birth of household head, BMI for age percentile, surveys, and race/\nethnicity by survey interaction. n for models included those with complete covariate information, 6823.

These are presented when there was no significant race/ethnicity\nby survey interaction.\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nsuch analyses (59). However, the regression-adjusted means of\nobserved 24-h dietary attributes examined in the present\nanalyses are considered as appropriate for estimation of mean\nusual intakes of groups (59).\nAnother concern with dietary measurement pertains to\ndietary reporting errors, especially underreporting of food\nintake (59). The problem of dietary reporting error may be\ngreater in the age groups we studied for a variety of reasons\n(60,61). It is possible that with increasing adiposity and health in\nthe spotlight, the population may be wary of reporting dietary\nbehaviors that are perceived negatively, with a consequent\nincrease in prevalence of biased dietary reporting over time. We\nnote that our analytic approach adjusted for several possible\ncorrelates, such as income, education, and body weight, of\ndietary underreporting. Also, the mean ratios of EI:BEE (a rough\nindicator of possible low energy reporting status) and the\npercentage of the population below an EI:BEE of ,0.92\nappeared to be similar across race groups in the 3 surveys\n(Table 1). Finally, the results of time trends for energy intake\nafter exclusion of possible underreporters were generally similar\nto those without exclusions (Supplemental Table 7). Gibson also\ndid not observe an increase in energy intakes of British children\nreporting (62). Nevertheless, because the NHANES dietary data\nare used for national nutrition monitoring, meaningful inter-\npretation of these data for children requires more study of\nreporting bias, especially using the AMPM, race/ethnic differ-\nences in the nature and extent of underreporting, and possible\ndrift in dietary reporting.\nThe reasons for lack of concordance between race/ethnic\ndifferences in the trajectory of changes in body weight but\ngenerally unchanged energy intake or modest changes in other\ndietary behaviors are likely to be complex and may reflect the\nabove-discussed issues about validity of methods used to\nestimate dietary intakes in these surveys (9) or possible contri-\nbution of the energy expenditure side of the energy balance\nequation.\nIn conclusion, although the direction of changes in dietary\nattributes appeared to be similar in all race/ethnic groups, there\nis a suggestion of convergence due to somewhat larger changes\nin possibly adverse dietary behaviors in non-Hispanic blacks,\nespecially adolescents. However, the magnitude of observed\nchanges in dietary behaviors was modest and not accompanied\nby changes in energy intake. There is a continued need for\nunderstanding dietary contributors to positive energy balance in\nchildren and adolescents from all race/ethnic groups of the U.S.\npopulation.\n"
