    "reduced_content": "Objectives: Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a disturbance of vaginal mi-\ncroflora, is a common cause of vaginal symptoms and is associated with\nan increased risk of acquisition of sexually transmitted infections,\nHIV, and with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We determined preva-\nlence and associations with BV among a representative sample of\nwomen of reproductive age in the United States.\nStudy Design: Women aged 14\u00ad49 years participating in the Na-\nasked to submit a self-collected vaginal swab for Gram staining. BV,\ndetermined using Nugent's score, was defined as a score of 7\u00ad10.\nResults: The prevalence of BV was 29.2% (95% confidence interval\n15.7% of the women with BV reported vaginal symptoms. Prevalence\nwas 51.4% among non-Hispanic blacks, 31.9% among Mexican Amer-\nicans, and 23.2% among non-Hispanic whites (P <0.01 for each com-\nparison). Although BV was also associated with poverty (P <0.01),\ntrend), and having had a female sex partner (P <0.005), in the mul-\ntivariate model, BV only remained positively associated with race/\nethnicity, increasing lifetime sex partners (2 P <0.001 for trend),\nincreasing douching frequency (2 P for trend <0.001), low educa-\ntional attainment (P <0.01), and inversely associated with current use\nConclusion: BV is a common condition; 84% of women with BV\ndid not report symptoms. Because BV increases the risk of acquiring\nsexually transmitted infections, BV could contribute to racial dispar-\nities in these infections.\nsymptoms among reproductive-aged women,1 is characterized by\nthe loss of normal vaginal flora, predominantly hydrogen peroxide-\nproducing Lactobacillus spp., and the increase in the number and\nspecies of other bacteria in vaginal fluid.2 The decrease in lacto-\nbacilli and increase in numerous facultative and anaerobic bacteria,\nsome of which have only been recently characterized,2 may lead to\nchanges in the characteristics of vaginal fluid, such as thin dis-\ncharge and odor. However, many women with BV do not have\nsymptoms.\nThe diagnosis of BV can be made using clinical criteria3 or in\nthe laboratory by scoring bacterial morphotypes from a Gram stain\nof vaginal fluid.4 A score of 0\u00ad3 is defined as normal, 4\u00ad6 as\nintermediate, and 7\u00ad10 as BV.4 Treatment is recommended for\nsymptomatic women,5 but 1 month after therapy only 80% of\nwomen have regained normal flora; recurrences after 1 month are\nalso common.5\nThe changes in vaginal microflora of BV are associated with\nnumerous health problems.2,5 BV increases the risk of acquiring\nthe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),6 and among HIV in-\nfected women, BV increases HIV viral shedding.7,8 BV increases\nthe risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted infections (STI)\nsuch as gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and herpes simplex virus type\n2 (HSV-2).9,10 In pregnant women, BV increases the risk of\nmiscarriage,11 preterm labor, preterm delivery, and postpartum\ncomplications such as endometritis and wound infections.5,12,13\nBV is not a reportable condition in the United States.

They were instructed to insert the swab at least\n1 inch into the vagina, turn the swab against the walls of the vagina\nwhile counting to 10, and then put the swab into the collection\ntube. NHANES personnel applied the swab to narrow range pH\npaper to determine pH and then rolled the swab onto a glass slide\nto air dry. Slides were Gram stained and read using Nugent's\ncriteria3 at one central laboratory where readers were blind to any\ninformation about the women. As part of quality control, 2.5% of\nthe BV samples were reread. There was 100% agreement between\nthe two readings. For our analysis, a Gram stain score of 7\u00ad10 was\ndefined as BV. We also analyzed the proportion of women with a\nGram stain score of 7\u00ad10 and a vaginal pH of 4.5. Women were\nnotified of their results by a password-protected call-in system\nused for STI.\nDemographic and Behavioral Data\nRace and ethnicity were self-reported and classified as non-\nHispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Mexican American.\nWomen not reporting one of these categories were classified as\n\"other.\" Poverty index ratio was calculated by dividing total family\nincome by the poverty threshold index adjusted for family size at\nyear of interview.15 Assessment of educational attainment was\nlimited to those aged 18 and older. Population estimates were\ngenerated by multiplying 2002 census estimates of civilian non-\ninstitutionalized women aged 14\u00ad49 by the weighted prevalence\nestimate. Symptom and behavioral data were self-reported. Having\nsex was explained to participants as including vaginal, oral, or anal\nsex. Using the ACASI, participants were asked \"Have you ever\nhad sex?\" The date of onset of the most recent menstrual cycle and\nthe date of the exam were used to calculate day of menstrual\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.1,\nSAS Institute, Cary NC) and SAS callable SUDAAN (RTI, Re-\nsearch triangle Park NC), and account for the complex survey\ndesign by incorporating the survey weights and using a Taylor\nmedical examination survey weights provided by NHANES were\nused to account for the unequal probabilities of selection and\nadjustment for nonresponse. A prevalence estimate was considered\nunreliable if the relative standard error was 30% of the preva-\nlence estimate and those estimates are not presented. The sampling\nestimation and model building.\nConfidence intervals were calculated using a log transformation\nwith the standard error of the log prevalence based on the delta\nmethod and applying SUDAAN estimated standard errors.17 Sig-\nnificance tests for associations between BV and other variables\nwere based on a Wald 2 statistic. A 0.05 level was used to define\nstatistical significance.\nFor the multivariate model we used SUDAAN for logistic\nregression and considered all variables that had a P value of less\nthan or equal to 0.10 in bivariate analysis. Because of missing data\nin the poverty index ratio, we used a variable with more complete\ndata: family income greater than or equal to $20,000 or below\n$20,000. Using a backwards elimination approach, we removed\nvariables in order of least statistical significance. When all vari-\nables in the model were statistically significant at 0.05 level, all\npairwise interactions in the model were explored. When an inter-\naction was entered into the model the main effects variables were\nalways retained. A pairwise interaction was retained only if the\noverall P value for the interaction was 0.05.\nResults\nThe prevalence of BV was 29.2% (95% confidence interval\nThe proportion of women with a Nugent's score of 7\u00ad10 and a pH\nvariables mentioned below, prevalence of BV decreased by 25%\nwhen we added the criterion of pH 4.5. The sensitivity and\nBV prevalence varied significantly by sociodemographic char-\nacteristics, earlier initiation of sexual activity, increasing numbers\nof sex partners, and a previous female sex partner (Table 1). There\nwas a significant association between increasing numbers of life-\ntime sex partners and BV among non-Hispanic whites and non-\nHispanic blacks, but not among Mexican Americans (Fig. 1).\nWomen who reported more than one sex partner in the previous 12\nmonths (recent) and more than one lifetime sex partner had a\nprevalence of 39.6%, those who reported no or one recent sex\npartner and more than one lifetime partner had a prevalence of\n29.1%, those who reported no or one sex partner in the last 12\nmonths and one lifetime partner had a prevalence of 22.4%, and\nthose who reported never having had sex had a prevalence of\nreported never having had sex, 90% were aged 14\u00ad19 years, two\nwere infected with Chlamydia trachomatis, one with Neisseria\ngonorrhoeae, and four had serologic evidence of previous in-\nfection with HSV-2.

Some women with BV who reported\nnever having had sex had evidence of other STI or were married or\ncohabiting. Therefore, some women may have misstated their\nprevious sexual activity or misinterpreted the question about sex-\nual activity. Nonetheless, many women with BV who did not\nreport sexual activity had no other evidence indicating they had\nhad sex. These data do not support a uniquely causal role of sexual\nactivity. Few studies have reported BV prevalence, incidence, or\nrisk factors conducted among women who have never been sexu-\nally active. Our estimate corresponds with the prevalence found\namong sexually na\u00efve young women entering the military, 18%.21\nAnother study among school girls who reported never having had\nsex found a prevalence of 12%23 using the criteria of four of the\nfollowing five for the definition of BV: vaginal pH 4.5; abnormal\ndischarge; clue cells; positive sniff test; or succinate/lactate ratio\ngreater than or equal to 0.4 on gas-liquid chromatography of a\nvaginal specimen. These first four criteria (\"Amsel\" criteria3) may\nunderestimate the prevalence of BV.24\nIn support of a role of sexual transmission, previous studies have\nfound that multiple or new sex partners increased the risk of\nsuggested that condom use may be protective. In our study, BV\nprevalence increased with number of lifetime sexual partners\namong non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women (Fig.\n1), and increased by a factor of 1.4\u00ad2.4 with increasing numbers\nof sex partners in multivariate analysis. However, the NHANES\nquestionnaire did not assess recent sex act-specific condom use, so\nwe were unable to assess the relationship between recent condom\nuse and BV prevalence. Also supporting sexual transmission are data\nfrom a study among lesbian couples; BV was associated with sharing\nof sex toys, and couples had greater than 90% concordance in BV\nstatus26 suggesting transmission of an infectious agent. We found that\nwomen who had ever had sexual activity with another woman had a\nhigher prevalence of BV. Ongoing research into novel bacteria may\nshed light on the cause and transmission of BV.2\nassociated with higher BV prevalence by a factor of 1.4\u00ad2.1. We\nfound increasing douching frequency was independently associ-\nated with BV prevalence. However, because this was a cross-\nsectional study, we could not evaluate the temporal relationship, if\nany, of symptoms, the menstrual cycle, and douching to BV. Our\ndata showed no differences in BV prevalence among symptomatic\nwomen on the basis of douching status; however, among asymp-\ntomatic women, those who douched were more likely to have BV\nthan those who did not. The interpretation of this observation is\nunclear. We could not capture the dynamic nature of BV; it may\nappear and resolve spontaneously over days to weeks16. Of note,\nprevalence did not vary significantly by timing in menstrual cycle\nin this sample of women.\nAlthough the cause of BV remains unclear, BV has been asso-\nciated with numerous adverse health outcomes, such as increased\nvaginal HIV shedding.7,8,27 In prospective studies, BV increased\ngonorrhea by 1.7,9 and trichomoniasis by 1.8.9 Increased suscep-\ntibility to these STI may be related to the decrease in protective\nlactobacilli,9 the increase in abnormal flora,9 and the reduction in\nvaginal secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor.28 In our study, the\nprevalence of BV among non-Hispanic black women was more\nthan twice that of non-Hispanic white women. This higher prev-\nalence may in part contribute to higher prevalence of HIV, HSV,\ntrichomoniasis, and gonorrhea among non-Hispanic black women.\nA recent trial has shown that treating asymptomatic women who\nhave BV with a suppressive treatment regimen reduced the inci-\ndence of acquiring a new sexually transmitted infection (Jane\nSchwebke, MD, personal communication).\nThe higher prevalence of BV among non-Hispanic black women\nmay also relate to racial disparities in the rate of preterm birth.29 In\nthis sample, women who had delivered a preterm and low-birth\nweight infant had a higher prevalence of BV than either women\nwho had not had these pregnancy outcomes or had never been\npregnant. BV in pregnant women is associated with preterm birth\nand other complications.5,13\u00ad15 In this sample, women who had\ndelivered a preterm and low birth weight infant had a higher\nprevalence of BV than women who had not had these pregnancy\noutcomes or had never been pregnant. Racial disparities in the rate\nof preterm birth29 may be related to the higher prevalence of BV\namong non-Hispanic black women. An intervention targeting BV-\nrelated preterm birth may play a role in reducing these disparities.\nThis study provides additional information on the correlates of BV\nprevalence. Most women were asymptomatic. Current methods for\ndiagnosing BV do not discriminate between possibly different\npolymicrobial2 vaginal syndromes that could have different clinical\noutcomes. Further research should clarify the cause of and risk factors\nfor BV, therapies that have high and long-lasting effectiveness, meth-\nods to identify those at risk, and methods to reduce associated adverse\nhealth outcomes.\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the\nauthors and do not necessarily represent the views of the agency.\nReferences\n2.
