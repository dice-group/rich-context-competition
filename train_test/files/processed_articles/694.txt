    "abstract": "Abstract: Although the importance of exercise as a public health issue is increasingly\nrecognised, little attention has been paid to exercise in very old people. We examined\nexercise patterns in 1788 subjects aged 70 years and over who were participating in the\nAustralian Longitudinal Study of Ageing. In the two weeks before interview,39 per cent\nof subjects had taken no exercise and only four per cent had exercised vigorously. When\ncompared with those who took no exercise, exercisers were more likely to be male and\nyounger, to self-report better health, to be former smokers and regular alcohol users.\nMortality rates at two years follow-up were inversely related to the level of exercise at\nbaseline. This research indicates that exercise is important for the very old as well as\nN impressive list of health benefits accrues to\nelderly people who exercise regularly. They\ninclude better cardiovascular function,l.?\nlower morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular\nless body fat,' better lipid profile,\" slowed\nprogression of osteoporosis,'-\" better balance and\ncoordination,\"' better functional capacity,\",\" and\npossibly better nutrition and sleep.'\" Regular exer-\ncise in older people also reduces anxiety,depression\nand other psychological disorders.\"-'\" There is some\nevidence that cognition improves,\" but this is not a\nconsistent finding.I6Exercise also improves quality\nof life.':',\" Despite the convincing evidence of its\nbenefits, exercise levels tend to fall with age\" and\nthis trend accelerates after retirement.'!' Two\ndecades ago, relatively few elderly Australians exer-\ncised regularly.\"' Since then, the promotion of\nhealth and fitness through exercise has become an\nimportant public health issue in Australia as else-\nwhere and there is some evidence to suggest that\nexercise patterns are now changing for the better.\"'\nMost of the descriptive and intervention studies\non exercise in older people have focused on the\n'young old' (those aged under 70 years) while\nneglecting older people. The exclusion of people\naged over 70 years is inappropriate for two reasons.\nFirst, the size of this group is rapidly expanding in\nboth relative and absolute terms. Second, many of\nthe problems that can be attenuated by exercise are\nmost prevalent in this age group.\nWe studied exercise patterns and their correlates\namong people participating in the Australian\nLongitudinal Study of Ageing (ALSA),a large study\nof the determinants of health and wellbeing in peo-\nple aged over 70 years. We correlated exercise pat-\nterns with demographic and life-style characteristics\nat the time of entry to the study. Participants were\nA\nCorrespondence t o Lynne Giles, (kntre for Ageing Studies,\nfollowed up for two years, thereby allowing us to\nrelate exercise patterns at baseline to subsequent\nmortality.\nMethods\nThe Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing is a\nlarge epidemiological study which aims to identify\nthe determinants of health and social wellbeing in\nold age. The study is described in detail elsewhere.\"\nIn brief, a stratified random sample of people aged\n70 years and over and living in the Adelaide Statis-\ntical Division (the wider City of Adelaide), South\nAustralia, were interviewed in detail at their normal\nplace of residence (either in the community or in\nresidential care) about their demographic, medical,\npsychological,social and economic characteristics.\nA random sample was initially drawn from the\ndatabase of the South Australian electoral roll. From\nthis sample, eligible persons (defined as those per-\nat the time resident in the Adelaide Statistical\nDivision) and their spouses (aged 6\n.\n5 and over), as\nwell as other household members aged 70 and over,\nwere asked to participate. The electoral roll sample\nwas stratified to provide estimated equal numbers in\nfive-yearage and sex cohorts from 70 years upwards.\nMales were deliberately oversampled to compensate\nfor higher mortality over the period of the study.\nA total sample of 3263 people was drawn from the\nelectoral roll, of whom 2705 were eligible for inclu-\nsion in the study and 1477 agreed to participate.\nFrom within the households of those eligible for\ninclusion in the study,879 spouses were also eligible\nfor inclusion and of them 597 agreed to participate.\nOf 24 other eligible household members, 13 agreed\nto participate. Thus, 55 per cent of the primary sub-\njects identified through the electoral roll and 67 per\ncent of the spouses and other household members\nagreed to participate in the study. In total, 2087\ninterviews were conducted from September 1992 to\nFace-to-face interviews were carried out by a team\nof interviewerswho were all trained in intensivework-\nshops before interviewing. More than half of the\ninterviewers also worked as interviewers for the\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics. Two supenisors regu-\nlarly accompanied interviewers to ensure the stan-\ndardisation of interviews. Interpreters were employed\nas needed to assist with foreign language inteniews.\nA 12-month follow-up interviewwas conducted by\ntelephone, and among the eligible participants, a 91\nper cent response rate was achieved. At 24 months,\na full re-interviewwas carried out and among surviv-\ning participants the response rate was 94 per cent.\nThis paper deals with the 1799 community-dwelling\nrespondents aged 70 years or over who were first\nOf the 733 items in the baseline questionnaire,\nnine related to exercise that the person had under-\ntaken in the two weeks before the survev.These ques-\ntions were developed by Australia's National Heart\nFoundation for use in a 20- to 69-year-old popula-\ntion.\"' Four questions dealt with the type of exercise\nand five with the quantity of exercise undertaken.\nSpecifically, respondents were asked if they had: 1.\nengaged in vigorous exercise which was defined as\n`exercisewhich made you breathe harder or puff or\npant, such as tennis,jogging, etc.';2. engaged in `less\nvigorous exercise for recreation, sport or health/fit-\nness purposes which did not make you breathe\nharder or puff or pant'; 3. `walked for recreation or\nexercise';or 4. engaged in `tasksaround the house ...\ninvolving moderate to heavy physical exertion which\nmade you breathe harder or puff and pant'. In the\nanalysisof the responses, those answeringyes to ques-\ntion 1 were classified as `vigorous exercisers'; those\nanswering no to question 1 and yes to 2, 3 or 4 were\nclassified as `lessvigorous exercisers';those answering\nno to all four questions were classified as `nonexercis-\ners'.Those who answered yes to one or more of ques-\ntions 1 to 4 were asked supplementary questions\nabout the frequency of exercise undertaken. The\nrespondents who answeredyes to question 1were also\nasked about the duration of exercise sessions.\nTo assess subsequent mortality, we searched\nas the censoring date. If a respondent was still alive\nat the censoring date, the time in days from the date\nof their baseline interview was calculated. If the\nrespondent had died in the intervening period, the\nnumber of days he or she had survived after the\nbaseline interview was computed. A Cox regression\ntaking survival in days as the response\nvariable, was fitted to the data. Initially, only exer-\ncise status and the interaction between exercise sta-\ntus and time were included in the model so that the\nassumption of proportional hazards for exercisers\nand nonexercisers over the course of the study\ncould be Subsequently, a second Cox\nregression model incorporating a number of inde-\npendent variables was fitted to the data. The inde-\npendent variables used were sex, age, marital status,\nself-rated health, number of chronic medical condi-\ntions, smoking status, alcohol consumption, age at\nleaving school and exercise status.\nAll analyseswere carried out using SPSS.\"-`x\nResults\nextent to which they had exercised in the two weeks\npreceding the interview.

The\nThe vigorous exercisers had undertaken a mean of\n6.7 (standard deviation (SD) 0.6) sessions of vigor-\nous exercise in the previous two weeks with an aver-\nage duration of 56.2 (SD 7.2) minutes per session.\nThe average number of sessions undertaken by the\nless vigorous exercisers was 8.9 (SD 0.2); no data\nwere collected on the average duration of these ses-\nsions.\nthis was significantlyless than the mean age of 79.5\n(SD 6.1) years among nonexercisers (t17*,,\nP < 0.001). Other demographic and lifestyle charac-\nteristics of exercisers and nonexercisers are com-\npared in Table 1. Males were more likely to exercise\nTable 1: Demographic and life-style characteristics of\nelderly exercisers and nonexercisers\nExercisers Nonexercisers\nVariable n % n % x 2 P\nAge (years)\nSex\nCurrently married\nAge left school (years)\nSelf-rated health\nExcellent or\nSmoking status\nAlcohol use\nNotes: ( 0 )Times per month.

The relationship between self-\nrated health and exercise status was positive and\nhighly significant.\nWith regard to life-stylefactors, there was a signif-\nicant positive relationship between smoking and\nexercise status,with former smokers rather than cur-\nrent or never smokers being most likely to exercise.\nPeople who had never smoked were least likely to\nexercise; this was in part due to the higher number\nof women who were both sedentary and had never\nsmoked.

These comprised two (2.8 per\ncent) of the 'vigorous exercisers', 78 (7.6 per cent)\ncent) of the 'nonexercisers'. The difference in mor-\ntality rates between nonexercisers and others was\nSurvival analyses compared the pooled group of\nvigorous and less vigorous exercisers with nonexer-\ncisers. The pooled group of exercisers was used\nbecause the small number of vigorous (compared to\nless vigorous) exercisers could result in unreliable\nparameter estimates for the vigorous group. The\nfirst Cox regression model fitted to the data revealed\na significant difference in the surcival function\nbetween exercisers and nonexercisers. Figure 1\nshows the cumulative survival function for the fitted\nmodel. Survival curves for exercisers and nonexer-\ncisers started to diverge at about three months and\nprogressively diverged thereafter. Table 2 gives the\nsignificant predictors of the survival function as\nidentified by the second Cox regression model, as\noutlined in the methods section. An estimate o\nf the\nhazard ratio for mortality for each variable, along\nwith the 9\n.\n5 per cent confidence interval, was\nextracted from this model. The first level of each cat-\negorical variable was taken as a reference category.\nTable 2 shows that respondents who were female,\nwho reported excellent or very good health, who for-\nmerly or never smoked, or who exercised, had a\nm\n>\n.-\nv)\n..-\n,\n-\n.-\n-\n.-\nn\n: s s ; i ; k ; : h e\nsurvival time\nFigure 1: Survival function for fitted Cox regression model\nTable 2: Hazard ratios for death for significant\nindependentvariables in the Cox model\nVariable Hazard ratio CI\nSex\nmale\nfemale\nAge\nSelf-rated health\nexcellent or very good 1.oo\nSmoking status\ncurrent\nformer\nnever\nExercise\nsome\nnone\nNote: (a) CI = 95%confidence interval\nhigher probability of survival. Increasing age and a\ngreater number of chronic medical conditions were\nassociatecl with a diminished probability of survival.\nThe hazard ratio for death for those respondents\nundertaking no exercise was 1.7 times that for the\nrespondents who exercised.\nDiscussion\nDespite the recognised benefits to health of exer-\ncise, many elderly people exercise infrequently, if at\nall. In this study, almost 40 per cent of those sur-\nveyed had not exercised in the previous two weeks\nand only 4 per cent had exercised vigorously.\nComparable data from large samples of elderly peo-\nple from Australia or elsewhere are lacking. How-\never, in a study of middle-aged Australians, it was\nestimated that only 15per cent took enough exercise\nfor cardiovascular protection and that 30 per cent\nwere totally sedentary.\" In this latter study, exercise\nlevels declined with age so that less than 8per cent of\npeople aged over 50 years were aerobically active.\nThose least likely to exercise in our surveywere older\nwomen. This finding is similar to that of other stud-\nies from Australia2'and elsewhere.\"' However, others\nhave found that men take more outdoor exercise\nwhile women exercise more indoor~.'~\".~''\nWe found a strong association between exercise\nstatus at baseline and subsequent mortality such that\n2.8 per cent ofvigorous exercisers and 15.7 per cent\nof nonexercisers were dead at two-year follow-up.\nHowever,association does not imply causality,and in\na cross-sectionalstudy such as this, confounding fac-\ntors may operate. Those who exercised were\nyounger and had better self-reported health so that\nbetter survival characteristics are to be expected. It\nmay be that short-term recall of exercise activity\nreflects lifetime exercise patterns, and this could be\nan important predictor of diminished risk of mor-\ntality. In addition, our research identifies elderly\npeople who do not exercise to be a high-risk group\namong whom one in six fail to survive two years.\nNow that the benefits of exercising and the penal-\nties for not exercising are becoming clear, a strong\npublic health message is starting to emerge. Exercise\nis important for everybody, even for those who are\nwell past the traditional retirement age. The Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention and the\nAmerican College of Sports Medicine have recently\nrevised earlier guidelines when recommending that\nadults should accumulate 30 minutes or more of\nmoderate-intensity exercise on most and preferably\nall, days of the week.\" One way to meet these stan-\ndards is to walk 3 kni briskly;other examples of mod-\nerate-intensity exercise include cycling, swimming,\ncalisthenics, racket sports, golf, fishing, canoeing,\nhome care, lawn mowing and home repair. Less\ndemanding programs may also be of value, and a\ntwice-weekly, six-month progressive walking pro-\ngram has been shown to improve the fitness of\nelderly women.''\nThe World Health Organization recently empha-\nsised the importance of exercise for people of all age\ngroups 'including the oldest citizens' and stated that\n'the responsibility for personal health ultimately lies\nwith the individual and family, but ... the promotion\nof physical activity must be a part of public policy\nbecause the implications are important and far-\nreaching'.\":' Owen and Bauman identified inability\nand apathy to be the main barriers to exercise in\nelderly people.\"4Now that the benefits of exercise in\nold age are established, the next challenge is to\ndevise strategies to overcome these barriers and\nthen to implement and evaluate them.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was funded in part by the South\nAustralian Health Commission, the Australian\nRotary Health Research Fund, and a grant from the\nassistance of the Births, Deaths and Marriages\nRegistration Office and the South Australian Health\nCommission Epidemiology Branch in extracting\ndeath records is gratefully acknowledged.\nReferences\n1.
