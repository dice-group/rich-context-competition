This is\nalarming because once gained, it is very difficult to get\nrid of extra weight, and obesity is associated with an increased\nrisk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer, and with\na lower life expectancy.1,2\nThough conclusive direct evidence is lacking, a wealth of\nindirect evidence suggests that food advertising causes weight\ngain in children.3\u00ad5 The overwhelming majority of food-\nproduct advertisements seen on television (TV) by American\nchildren and adolescents are for food of poor nutritional value\nbut high in energy content.6 Food promotion is having an\neffect, particularly on children's preferences, purchase behav-\niour and consumption. This effect is independent of other\nfactors and operates at both a brand and category level.3\nIt seems unlikely that a change in consumption towards\nenergy-dense foods would not have any effect on body mass.\nThe real question is no longer whether food advertising\ncauses childhood obesity, but rather how much. Is its impact\nnegligible, as industry representatives argue, or considerable,\nas health and consumer organizations estimate?7,8\nA recent study shows that US children aged 2\u00ad11 years see\nan average of 11.5 min of food-related TV advertising per day.9\nHow much of the overweight and obesity among US children\nthis explains is unknown and this implies that the potential\neffectiveness of restrictions on the marketing of energy-dense\nfood to children is not known, either. We aim to give a\nquantified estimate of the impact of TV food advertising on\nchildhood overweight and obesity.\nThe effect of advertising is difficult to examine directly.\nTrials in life-like situations are virtually impossible, and\nobservational studies are complicated by a number of known\nand suspected confounders. Both exposure to TV food\nadvertising and obesity are highly correlated with time spent\nwatching TV, permissive parenting styles and exposure to\nother kinds of marketing. No study provides all the required\ninformation but elements of the pathway from advertising\nto overweight and obesity are known. Mathematical models\ncan be used to bring this information together in a logical\nframework to derive effect estimates of interventions.10,11\nData from the published literature was used in a\nmathematical simulation model of the relationship between\nexposure to food advertising on TV and the prevalence of\nchildhood overweight and obesity. In this article, we explore\nthe potential effects of a total ban on TV food advertising on\n6- to12-year-old children in the USA.\nMethods\nThe model compares two populations: a reference population\nthat remains unchanged, and an intervention population in\nwhich changes in exposure to food advertising are translated\ninto corresponding changes in consumption, body mass (BMI,\nin kg/m\u00c02) and the prevalence of overweight.\nOur analytical framework consists of four steps. First, an\nintervention or policy lowers exposure to food commercials.\nAt most, the exposure can be reduced to zero, and this is\nthe scenario we present. This is not a realistic scenario, but\nit indicates the theoretical maximum effect of measures that\naim to limit children's exposure.\nSecond, a change in exposure lowers total daily energy\nconsumption [see Equation (1) in the Appendix 1].

We then decided on total energy intake as an\nintermediate outcome measure and found only a single\nsuitable study. Based on cross-sectional data and a structural\nequation model Bolton estimates that an increase in TV food\nadvertising exposure by an additional 25 min/week would\ncause a child to consume one additional snack per week,\nwhich would increase the child's energy intake by $1.4%.12\nHastings et al.3 describe the study as a complex, high-quality\nstudy which found a small but significant association between\nTV viewing and frequency of snacking. In a separate analysis,\nwe replaced this value with one based on current expert\nopinion, as described below.\nThird, lower consumption leads to a lower average body\nweight [see Equations (2) and (3) in the Appendix 1]. For this\nstep, we applied the results of a study by Swinburn and\ncolleagues13. They analysed cross-sectional data in which total\nenergy expenditure is precisely measured and assumed to\nbe equal to total energy intake (`EnFlux'), and validated the\noutcomes with longitudinal data. The study showed that a\nhigher total energy expenditure is associated with a higher\nbody mass; the authors estimate that two populations with\nconfidence interval: 3.8\u00ad5.1%) difference in mean weight.\nFinally, we applied Rose's theorem that the mean predicts\nthe number of deviant individuals14 and assumed that the\naverage BMI predicts the number of overweight and obese. The\ndevelopment of the obesity epidemic can be conceptualized\nas a shifting population distribution of BMI.11 Over the years,\nthe BMI-curve has shifted to higher values with increased skew\nto the right (figure 1).15 This is reflected in the mean BMI,\nwhich has also steadily increased.16 We fitted the measured\nsample weights, to a lognormal curve using the least squares\nmethod.17 To mimic the historic changes observed in the\ndata, we fixed the lower end of the BMI-distribution in the\nintervention population. This is consistent with the data\nand theoretically plausible: below a certain BMI level, no life\nis possible. We modelled boys and girls separately in 1-year\nage categories. Children with a BMI between the 85th and\n95th percentiles of US reference populations are categorized\nas overweight, and those above the 95th percentile as\nobese.18,19 Because these definitions are based on age by\nmonth, we used the mid-year values. The entire BMI\ndistribution can be manipulated by changing its mean value.\nShifting the average upwards increases the variance and the\nrightward skew, which pushes a higher proportion of the\npopulation above the 85th and 95th percentile thresholds.\nThe model was implemented in a spreadsheet (MS Excel).\nDelphi study\nThe uncertainty in the above calculation was considerable,\nparticularly in the dose\u00adresponse relationship between TV\nadvertising and total energy intake. It is based on a single study\nthat was published in 1983 and did not quantify uncertainty.\nIn view of this paucity of evidence, we decided to obtain\ncurrent expert opinion and conducted a Delphi study to\nestimate the impact of advertising on consumption.20 We\ninvited 33 academic experts to complete online questionnaires.\nTwenty-five were selected via PubMed because of recent\npublications on the subject, and eight were known by the\nauthors to have expertise on the subject. After briefly\npresenting the Bolton study we asked for a lower and higher\nboundary, and for a central estimate of the effect. We used\nthe latter in this analysis.\nUncertainty analysis\nThe two parameters with the greatest uncertainty are the\nlink from advertising to energy intake and the link from energy\nintake to BMI. To reflect their potential impact, we calculated\n95% uncertainty intervals around the outcomes. We used\na parametric bootstrap for the link between the amount\nof energy consumed and body mass, assuming a normal\ndistribution.13,21 Since the Bolton study did not present\nconfidence limits, we could not incorporate the uncertainty\narising from the relation between advertising and energy\nintake in our base case scenario. In the scenario based on the\nDelphi study, we used a non-parametric bootstrap on the\ncentral estimates of the experts to model the dose\u00adresponse\nrelationship between exposure to advertising and energy\nintake. For all bootstraps, we used the Ersatz programme\nResults\nThe base case model predicts that reducing the exposure to\nTV food advertising of US children from 80.5 min/week9 to\nzero would decrease total consumption by 4.5%. If every 10%\nreduction in consumption corresponds to a 4.5% lower body\nweight, children would weigh about 2.1% less than in the\ncurrent situation, on average. This translates to a reduction in\nmean BMI of 0.38 kg m\u00c02, and a decrease in the prevalence\npoint for boys and 2.4 (2.1\u00ad2.8) for girls. The proportion of\nchildren with overweight would also decrease (table 1).\nOf the 33 experts invited to join the Delphi study, eight\ncompleted the two rounds of questions (24% response). When\nasked for a most likely value, the panel estimated that reducing\nthe exposure of children to food advertising on TV by\n10 min/week would reduce the total energy intake by 1.4%\nBMI\nProportion of population\nFigure 1 Modelled BMI distribution of 10-year old US boys.\non NHANES data, the dashed line is based on the NHES data\nproportion of the distribution lies above the age-specific\nreflecting the rising prevalence of overweight and obesity\n366 European Journal of Public Health\nestimates as input, the model predicts that reducing the\nexposure of US children to zero would result in a 12% decrease\nin total consumption, a lowering of weight by 5.6% and\nmean BMI by 1 kg m\u00c02 and a reduction in the prevalence\n(3.5\u00ad8.7) for girls. The proportion of children with overweight\nrespectively (table 1).\nDiscussion\nA complete ban on food advertising on TV may reduce\nthe prevalence of obesity among US children by about 2.5\npercentage points. Based on expert opinion, this could be\nas much as 6.5 percentage points. In other words, given a\nbaseline prevalence of about 17%, possibly as many as one\nin seven--or even one in three--obese children would not\nhave been obese in the absence of food advertising on TV.\nComparable numbers of overweight children might have had\na normal weight.\nLimitations\nThe uncertainty in the size of these effects is considerable and\nreflects the paucity of quantified data in this field of inquiry.\nThe most uncertain factor in our model is the dose\u00adresponse\nrelation between advertising and total energy intake. We based\nour estimate of the number of calories/day that is attributable\nto TV food advertising on the Bolton study and, in a separate\nanalysis, on expert opinion obtained with the Delphi method.\nThe Bolton study is rather old and based on cross-sectional\ndata. The effect of advertising may be confounded with\n`snacking-while-watching', because the time children were\nexposed to TV advertising was not adjusted for the time spent\nwatching TV. On the other hand, the study may underestimate\nthe effect of commercials because it corrects for parental\ninfluence. This assumes parents are not influenced by\nadvertising, but longstanding exposure to advertising may\nhave shifted parents' idea of what constitutes a `normal' diet\nfor children, even if there is no evidence of an influence on\ntheir understanding of a healthy diet.3 The Delphi study had\na rather low response of 24% and self-selection bias cannot\nbe excluded. This bias would probably lead to overestimation\nof the effects of restrictions on advertising, since people who\nare passionate about the subject will be more likely to respond.\nThe respondents found the questions difficult to answer. The\nresulting effect estimate is more than twice the Bolton effect\nestimate, which was justified by referring to (indirect) evidence\nfrom other studies, perceived limitations of the Bolton study\nand the notion that marketing is probably more effective\nnow than it was in 1977 when the Bolton data were collected.\nThe model itself also has its limitations. The modelled\nprevalence of obesity is about 1.4% lower than that reported by\nthe CDC,22 though our value falls within their 95% confidence\nrange. This may result from a less than ideal fit of our\nlognormal curve to children's BMI and from the use of mid-\nyear cut-off points for overweight and obesity, rather than the\nmonthly values. As did Bolton, our model assumes that the\nrelationship between advertising exposure and consumption\nis linear. This may not be accurate, but since we only estimate\nthe mean effect this is unlikely to lead to significant bias.\nOther studies\nFew studies give a quantified estimate of the effect of food\nadvertising on childhood obesity, or of the effectiveness\nof measures to limit the exposure of children to advertising.\nIn an ecological study, Lobstein and Dibb5 conclude that\nadvertising could explain up to half of the variation between\ncountries' overweight prevalence figures. This suggests a larger\neffect than we found. Possibly their exposure parameter, the\nnumber of obesogenic advertisements per hour, acts as proxy\nfor marketing pressure more in general and the attitude of\nthe public (including parents) towards advertising. A recent\neconometric study estimates that a ban on TV advertising\nfor fast food would reduce the number of overweight children\nhigh- and low-estimates and suggests an effect for all energy-\ndense foods that is in the higher ranges of our results.\nAn Australian study estimates that reductions in TV food\nadvertising may lower mean BMI by 0.17 kg/m\u00c02 which\nis about half to a quarter of the effect we find for a total\nban.24 A strong point is that this effect is based on a\nrandomized controlled trial,25 but the setting of a summer\ncamp makes extrapolating to total consumption during\nordinary life difficult.\nAlthough few other studies estimate the magnitude of\nthe effect of food advertising, TV watching as such has been\nfirmly linked to obesity. In a 4-year longitudinal study Dietz\nand Gortmaker found a dose\u00adresponse relationship of about\n0.6% increase in obesity prevalence per extra hour of TV, after\ncorrecting for past obesity and several socio-economic\ncharacteristics.26 In a later study they conclude that more\nthan 60% of overweight incidence in a representative sample\nof US children could be linked to excess TV viewing time.27\nRobinson et al. conducted an experiment that reduced the\ntime 9-year-old children spent watching TV from about\n15\u00ad9 h/week. After 7 months the BMI of the intervention\ngroup was 0.45 lower than that of the control group.28 The\nmechanism by which TV viewing causes weight gain remains\nless clear. Besides the influence of advertising, two more\npathways have been postulated: the sedentary nature of\nwatching TV and a tendency to snack while watching TV.\nA recent randomized controlled trial by Epstein at al showed\nthat reducing time spent watching TV or using a computer\nresulted in a decrease in energy intake, while physical activity\nlevels (measured by accelerometer) remained largely unaf-\nfected.29 This contradicts the widely held belief that physical\ninactivity explains most of the link between TV viewing and\nobesity, but does not indicate whether the culprit is advertising\nor `snacking-while-watching'. A rough estimate shows that\nin the Epstein study, a 70% reduction of TV and computer\ntime was associated with a decrease in net energy intake\nof 10%. In comparison, our model predicts that a similar\nreduction in TV advertising exposure may decrease consump-\ntion by about 3\u00ad8%, an estimate that remains under the\nceiling implied by the Epstein study.\nTable 1 Obesity and overweight among US children aged\nNHANES\n(counterfactual)\nBase case (Bolton) Delphi panel\nBoys\nGirls\n95% Uncertainty intervals are in brackets. Those around the\nbase case express uncertainty in the relationship between\nenergy intake and body weight only, while those around\nthe `Delphi panel' scenario also include the uncertainty in the\neffect of advertising on consumption\nFood advertising and childhood obesity 367\nStrengthening the evidence base\nThe best design to obtain more accurate estimates of the\neffect of TV food advertising on childhood obesity would\nprobably be a randomized controlled trial that reduces TV\nexposure, distinguishes between exposure to advertising\nand time spent watching TV and also measures physical\nactivity (using accelerometers). Such a study is technically\ndifficult, though in some settings it might be possible to\nrandomize access to channels with a high density of\nadvertising. Given the low feasibility of intervention studies,\ncarefully designed longitudinal and cross-sectional observa-\ntional studies could make very useful contributions to this\nfield. More quantitative evidence on the effect of marketing on\nchildhood obesity might strengthen the case for policy\nmeasures that limit (commercial) freedom and go against\npowerful vested interests. However, given the complexities\nof this field of research, the ultimate proof is unlikely to\nbe attainable.\nPolicy options\nThe present study suggests that if food advertising on TV\nwere banned, significant reductions in the prevalence of\nchildhood obesity are possible. Reducing marketing of\nenergy-dense foods via any channel might have an even\ngreater effect. A study into the effect of tobacco advertising\nconcluded that a comprehensive set of advertising bans can\nreduce tobacco consumption but that a limited set of\nadvertising bans will have little or no effect.30 This might be\ntrue for food advertising as well. If only TV advertising were\nrestricted, marketing budgets might not be reduced in size, but\ninstead used to deliver the same message via different media.\nFor example, the internet opens new ways to reach children\nwith marketing messages (e.g. via `advergaming'). Therefore,\neven though exposure to TV advertising seems to have\nstabilized in the US,9 the total commercial pressure on\nchildren's diets is likely to be increasing. Around the year\nin European countries were spent on TV advertising, but the\nmarket share of TV seems to be diminishing.8 However, it\nseems unlikely that the use of other marketing channels would\nfully compensate the loss of TV as an advertising medium.\nMarketers use a mix of strategies and media to influence their\ntarget audience, and it seems reasonable to assume that if the\nopportunities to reach children diminish, some of its power\nwill be lost.\nHow much evidence justifies action will always be a matter\nof judgment.31 In view of the likely costs of inaction, many\nobesity experts would argue that the scientific evidence is\nstrong enough to proceed to action.3,19 The International\nObesity Task Force (IOTF) recently formulated the `Sydney\nPrinciples', which call for statutory actions to reduce market-\ning to children.32 The American Academy of Paediatrics\nadvocates a ban on junk-food advertising during program-\nming that is viewed predominantly by young children.33\nSeveral countries (Sweden, Norway, Greece and the province\nof Quebec) have already restricted advertising to children.\nIn conclusion, a considerable proportion of overweight\nchildren in the USA might have had a normal weight in\nthe absence of advertising for unhealthy food on TV.\nThough more comprehensive measures are likely to be more\neffective, restrictions on TV food advertising may reduce\nthe prevalence of overweight and obesity among children.\nLimiting the advertising of energy-dense foods could well\nbe an element in a broader effort to make children's diets\nhealthier.\n"
