    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Numerous state and federal programs and policies aim to improve rural health\ncare. This study compares access to and quality of medical care in urban and rural areas\nfrom the perspective of physicians and patients, using a broad set of indicators taken from\nthe 2000\u00ad2001 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician and Household Surveys. Across\nmost dimensions examined, access and quality in rural areas--even rural counties not adja-\ncent to metropolitan areas--were either equivalent or superior to that provided in urban ar-\neas. However, rural residents have greater difficulty obtaining mental health services and\ngenerally face greater financial barriers to care.\nStrong congressional forces regularly advocate for increased support\nfor rural health care, based in part on perceptions that access to and quality\nof care in rural areas lag behind those in urban areas. These perceptions de-\nrive in part from research showing that per capita physician supply is lower in ru-\nral areas and that smaller inpatient facilities there lack some technology-intensive\nservices.1 Also, some believe that lower Medicare payments deter physicians from\npracticing in rural areas, although payment formulas actually compensate rural\nphysicians better than urban physicians relative to local practice costs.\nAs such, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization\nAct (MMA) of 2003 included funds for rural hospitals and home health agencies\nand increased Medicare payments to all rural physicians, with additional pay-\nments going to those practicing in underserved areas. This is on top of existing\nfederal programs encouraging physicians to practice in underserved areas and\nsubsidies for other rural services. On the other hand, President Bush's proposed\nfiscal year 2006 budget either greatly cuts or eliminates a number of rural health\nprograms.2 Given this recent policy activity, this is an opportune time to examine\ndifferences in rural and urban patients' access to and quality of care.\nWe compare health care in urban and rural areas from both physician and pa-\ntient perspectives. Our assessments do not encompass hospital quality, although\nwe include perceptions of both hospital- and non-hospital-based physicians.

With some impor-\ntant exceptions, the general picture that emerges is that across many dimensions,\nquality and access in rural areas are at least on par with urban areas.\nStudy Data And Methods\nsician and Household Surveys, conducted by the Center for Studying Health Sys-\ntem Change. Samples were representative of the population of physicians and ci-\nvilian, noninstitutionalized individuals in the forty-eight contiguous states\nhealth care markets, comprising fifty-one metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)\nand nine nonmetropolitan portions of economic areas defined by the Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis (BEA), supplemented by a nonclustered sample, comprising\nroughly 10 percent of all interviews to enhance the statistical power of national\nestimates.\nDetailed information on demographics, insurance coverage, health care use, and\nattitudes was gathered about all adult family members and one randomly selected\nchild in the Household Survey. The Physician Survey obtained detailed informa-\ntion on demographics, practices, and attitudes for nonfederal patient care physi-\ncians providing at least twenty hours of direct patient care per week. Both surveys\nused telephone interviews, supplemented in the Household Survey with in-\nperson interviews of households without telephones. We classified physicians\nand patients by the location of their practice or home, respectively. Urban areas\nare defined as those contained in MSAs; rural areas fall outside of MSAs. We fur-\nther divided rural areas into those adjacent or nonadjacent to an MSA (Exhibit 1).3\nWe compared the mean characteristics of urban physicians and patients with\nthose of their rural peers. Statistical significance tests accounted for the CTS sur-\nveys' complex sampling structure.

Comparisons discussed\nin the text, unless otherwise stated, are statistically significant at the 5 percent\nlevel.\nWe confirmed urban-rural differences in physician and patient characteristics\nfound in previous studies (data not shown).4 Female physicians were underrepre-\nsented in rural areas (19 percent versus 24 percent in urban areas). Contrary to\ncommon perceptions that rural physicians are older than urban physicians, rural\nphysicians tended to be slightly younger. Primary care physicians (PCPs), particu-\nlarly general and family practitioners, made up a larger portion of the physician\nworkforce in rural than in urban areas (49 percent versus 30 percent). Conversely,\nspecialists made up a smaller portion of the rural physician workforce (23 percent\nversus 37 percent). Rural physicians were less involved with managed care plans\nbut relied more on revenue from Medicare and Medicaid than their urban coun-\nterparts.\nThe supply of physicians, particularly specialists, was much lower in rural ar-\ncompared with 7.8 and 13.4, respectively, in urban areas. Referral patterns between\nrural and urban areas likely explain some of the difference in specialist supply,\nsince many rural areas were unlikely to be able to support subspecialist practices.\nConsistent with this, physician supply was greater in nonadjacent rural counties\nthan adjacent ones, although still much lower than urban areas. Conversely, the\nsupply of hospital beds (from American Hospital Association data) was greater in\nRural residents were older and were more likely to be uninsured or covered by\npublic insurance, to have lower incomes, and to be in poorer health on average.6\nGenerally, residents of counties nonadjacent to metropolitan areas tended to be\nmore disadvantaged than those in adjacent counties, with lower incomes and rates\nof insurance coverage.\nUrban-Rural Access Differences\nAccess to care defies simple measurement; it encompasses both patients' care-\nseeking decisions and system responses once the patient has initiated contact. We\nframed our comparisons around three sets of potential barriers, which all plausi-\nbly point to lower access to care in rural areas. The first set relates to \"convenience\nof use.\" Because of lower population density and fewer providers in rural areas, pa-\ntients may wait longer to get appointments, travel longer to see providers, and\nwait longer in doctors' offices. Less convenient access essentially makes care more\ncostly to use. The second set is \"provider supply\" factors. Having fewer providers\nin rural areas may make it more difficult to obtain services because physicians are\nless likely to accept new patients and can charge higher fees, or because physicians\nthemselves will have difficulties getting the services their patients need. The third\nset of factors, \"patient resource constraints,\" is related to patients' demand for ser-\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Because rural patients tend to be poorer and are less likely to have insurance\ncoverage, they are more likely to face financial barriers that discourage seeking\ncare and hinder their providers' ability to obtain services for them.7 Hence, the de-\nmand for care will be lower in rural areas.\nn General access measures. Exhibit 2 presents access indicators. First, we\npresent three general access measures from the CTS Household Survey: any unmet\nmedical need, whether getting needed care was put off, and whether patients had a\nusual source of care. There were no significant differences in the percentage report-\nR u r a l H e a l t h C a r e\nIndicators Of Access To Care In Urban And Rural Areas, 2000\u00ad01\nNonmetropolitan areas\nGeneral measures Metro areas\nAll\nnonmetroa Adjacenta\nNot\nadjacenta\nAdjacent vs.\nnonadjacent\nUnmet/delayed care needs in past year\nPercent of patients reporting\nunmet care needs\nPercent of patients reporting\nthey put off needed care\nPercent of patients with no\nusual source of care (USC)\nor who use an emergency\nroom and USC\nConvenience measures\nLast visit experiences\nTime to get appointment (days)\nWith PCP\nWith specialist\nTime traveling to physician's\noffice (minutes)\nTo specialist\n**\n***\nPercent of patients with umet/\ndelayed care needs citing\nspecific reason\nCould not get appointment\nsoon enough\nTakes too long to get to doctor\nTransportation problems\nProvider supply measures\nPercent of physicians accepting\nnew patients\nMedicare patients\nNone\nAll\nMedicaid patients\nNone\nAll\nPrivate patients\nNone\nAll\nUninsured patients\nNone\nAll\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Rural patients were more likely\nto report having a usual source of care--long identified as an important component\nof access to care and crucial for ensuring continuity of care (Exhibit 2).\nn Convenience of use. In the CTS Household Survey, patients who had a physi-\ncian visit in the past year (about 80 percent of all respondents) were asked about\ntheir last visit (PCP or specialist), including the time it took to get an appointment\nand to get to the doctor's office and the wait in the office before being seen.\nD a t a W a t c h\nIndicators Of Access To Care In Urban And Rural Areas, 2000\u00ad01 (cont.)\nNonmetropolitan areas\nProvider supply measures Metro areas\nAll\nnonmetroa Adjacenta\nNot\nadjacenta\nAdjacent vs.\nnonadjacent\nMean hours of charity care during\nPercent of MDs indicating they can\nobtain needed services for patients\nsometimes, rarely, or never\nReferrals to quality specialists\nHospital admissions\nAdequate hospital length-of-stay\nAncillary services\nDiagnostic imaging\nInpatient mental health services\nOutpatient mental health services\n**\nPercent of patients dissatisfied with\nchoice of physicians\nDissatisfied with PCP choice\nCovered by HMO\nCovered by non-HMO\nDissatisfied with specialist choice\nCovered by HMO\nCovered by non-HMO\n**\n**\nPatient resource constraint measures\nPercent with out-of-pocket costs\nexceeding 5% of income\nPercent with unmet/delayed care\nneeds citing cost as a reason\nAdjusted prior-year health care useb\nNo. of nonbirth hospital admissions\nNo. of nights in the hospital\nNo. of ER visits not resulting in\nadmission\nTotal outpatient medical visits\nPercent with any mental health visit\n**\nSOURCES: Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician and Household Surveys, 2000\u00ad01.\nNOTES: PCP is primary care physician.

The average number of days needed to get an appointment\nwith a PCP did not differ significantly between urban and rural patients, but rural\npatients reported longer waits to get specialist appointments. As expected, the\ntime reported traveling to the physician was longer in rural areas, although differ-\nences were not great.8 Travel times to specialists were longer, with a twenty-\nminute urban-rural differential (Exhibit 2). There were no significant urban-rural\ndifferences in wait times in PCP or specialists' offices (data not shown).\nHousehold Survey respondents reporting unmet or delayed care needs were\nasked to list reasons. We identified several related to convenience factors (Exhibit\n2). Of these, only the first had significant urban-rural differences, with urban resi-\ndents more likely to indicate that they couldn't get an appointment soon enough.\nThis suggests that although rural patients might have had longer waits, they were\nless likely to consider this a reason for experiencing delayed or unmet care needs.\nn Provider supply. If the lower supply of physicians in rural areas affects access\nto care, this might be reflected in fewer rural physicians accepting new patients. Al-\nthough there was little urban-rural difference in the percentage of physicians ac-\ncepting new private patients, rural physicians were more likely to accept new Medi-\ncare, Medicaid, and uninsured patients. They also provided more charity care,\nalthough differences are not statistically significant (Exhibit 2).\nAlthough highly important, getting in to see a physician does not guarantee ac-\ncess to care. Physicians have to be able to obtain the needed services. We next\nshow the percentage of physicians indicating that they had difficulty obtaining\nvarious services for their patients.9 Surprisingly, rural physicians were less likely\nthan their urban counterparts to report problems obtaining needed services (Ex-\nhibit 2). Despite the low specialist supply in rural areas, there was little difference\nacross urban and rural areas in the ability to obtain referrals to high-quality spe-\ncialists. Rural physicians were less likely to indicate problems obtaining hospital\nadmissions, ancillary services, and diagnostic imaging. However, they were much\nmore likely to report problems obtaining inpatient mental health services.10\nThe Physician Survey asked physicians who indicated difficulties obtaining\nthese services how important the lack of qualified providers (or facilities), health\nplan networks or administrative procedures, or patients with no or inadequate in-\nsurance coverage were in explaining these difficulties. Results suggest that urban\nand rural physicians differed in the reasons contributing to problems obtaining\nneeded services (data not shown). Among those indicating problems obtaining\nservices, the lack of qualified providers was more often cited as an important fac-\ntor by rural than urban physicians in the case of specialist referrals (85 percent\nversus 40 percent), mental health outpatient services (88 percent versus 66 per-\ncent), and hospital admission (37 percent versus 29 percent), although the last\ncomparison was significant only at the 10 percent level.\nWe next assess whether patients perceived an inadequate supply of physicians.\nPatients were asked whether they were satisfied with their choice of PCPs and\nR u r a l H e a l t h C a r e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

These comparisons might be confounded by greater health mainte-\nnance organization (HMO) penetration in urban areas. When we compared satis-\nfaction with physician choice separately for those insured by HMO and non-HMO\nplans, we found that rural patients covered by non-HMOs were less likely than\ntheir urban counterparts to be dissatisfied with the choice of specialists.\nn Patient resource constraints. As indicated, rural residents were poorer and\nless likely to have insurance coverage than urban residents, which suggests that they\nwill face greater resource constraints in accessing care.11 Indeed, the percentage of\npeople reporting out-of-pocket health care spending in excess of 5 percent of in-\ncome was much greater in rural than urban areas (Exhibit 2).\nWhen Household Survey respondents who indicated they had unmet or de-\nlayed care needs were asked to list reasons, the most prevalent reason given by\nboth urban and rural residents was concern about the cost. Rural residents were\nmuch more likely than urban residents to give this response, which suggests that\npatients' financial differences figure prominently in urban-rural access-to-care\ndifferences (Exhibit 2). On the other hand, rural physicians indicating serious\nproblems obtaining specialist referrals, hospital admissions, or outpatient mental\nhealth services were no more likely than urban physicians to mention patients' in-\nadequate insurance coverage as an important factor (data not shown).\nn Urban-rural differences in utilization. Although often used to indicate access\nto care, use of health care provides an imperfect measure. This is because we do not\nknow what the \"right\" level of use is and because overuse of services is common (and\npotentially harmful). We examined selected annual health care usage measures for\nurban and rural patients. Because there were significant population differences\nacross urban and rural areas that were likely to affect the demand for health care, we\npresent regression-adjusted means that control for demand-side factors: age, sex, in-\ncome, health status, family composition, and type of insurance coverage. Adjusted\nmeans provide a better indicator of usage differences attributable to disparities in\nthe provider supply, including the effect on convenience of use. However, additional\nunmeasured patient-demand factors, such as cultural differences, could also ac-\ncount for the remaining urban-rural differences.\nRural residents had more adjusted annual hospital admissions (excluding for\nbirths) than urban residents, although the total length-of-stay did not differ sig-\nnificantly (Exhibit 2). Controlling for demand factors reduced estimated rural\nhospital use, which suggests that rural residents are more likely than their urban\npeers to have conditions or injuries requiring hospitalization.\nFindings were mixed regarding outpatient utilization. Use of hospital emer-\ngency departments for conditions not requiring an overnight stay serves as an in-\ndicator of access to outpatient care, but little difference between urban and rural\nresidents was found.12 On the other hand, rural residents were found to have fewer\noutpatient visits (Exhibit 2). Similar patterns were evident when only physician\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Finally, consistent with physician difficul-\nties obtaining mental health care, rural residents were less likely than urban resi-\ndents were to report a mental health visit (Exhibit 2).\nQuality Of Care\nFor this study, we lacked specific clinical measures of health care quality and\nrelied mostly on physicians' and patients' perceptions. One objective measure, al-\nthough limited, is physician board certification.13 Rural specialists were less likely\nthan urban specialists to be board certified, although no differences were found\namong PCPs, who figure more prominently in the care of rural residents than ur-\nban residents (Exhibit 3). However, our subjective quality measures consistently\npointed to a conclusion of better-quality care in rural areas.\nPhysicians were asked how much they agreed with statements related to their\nability to provide high-quality care (Exhibit 3). In all cases, rural physicians were\nless likely than their urban peers to disagree with the statements, which indicates\nhigher perceived quality. One possible explanation is the smaller influence of\nmanaged care in rural areas; to account for this, we also calculated regression-\nadjusted means that control for physicians' HMO involvement.14 This narrowed\nurban-rural differences only slightly, and some lost their statistical significance.\nGenerally, rural PCPs treated a broader range of conditions and were more\nlikely than urban PCPs to staff emergency departments. One concern is whether\nthe scope of care rural PCPs are expected to provide without referral is broader\nthan it should be. Rural PCPs do not perceive this to be the case. PCPs were asked\nwhether the complexity or severity of patients' conditions for which they pro-\nvided care without referral to specialists was greater than it should be, about\nright, or less than it should be. Although 28 percent of urban PCPs indicated it\nwas greater than it should be, only 22 percent of rural PCPs did so.15\nGreater perceived quality among rural physicians was confirmed by patients'\nreports. Patients with a doctor's appointment in the past year were asked how\nmuch they trusted their doctor to meet their medical care needs and were asked to\nrate the thoroughness of the exam during their last physician visit and how well\ntheir physician explained things. In each case, rural patients gave more positive re-\nsponses about their physicians, although differences were small and only signifi-\ncant at the 10 percent level. However, rural patients were slightly more likely than\ntheir urban peers to indicate that their physician might be performing unneces-\nsary tests and procedures (Exhibit 3).16\nAdjacent Versus Nonadjacent Rural Areas\nOnly a few access indicators differed significantly between adjacent and non-\nadjacent rural counties (Exhibit 2).

Problems of patient resource constraints were greater in nonadjacent coun-\nties, reflecting residents' lower incomes and rates of insurance coverage. More-\nover, accessing specialist care appeared to be less convenient in nonadjacent coun-\nties.

This study is unique in bringing together both physicians' and\npatients' perspectives and in employing a broad set of access and quality indicators;\nhowever, it does have limitations. First, by reporting means across large geographic\ndivisions, we provided a broad picture but could not address the considerable varia-\ntion likely within both urban and rural areas. Second, some of the access measures\nand nearly all of the quality measures were subjective in nature. Urban-rural differ-\nences in these measures could be affected by differing cultural values, experiences,\nexpectations, and standards among respondents.\nn Physician/patient perspectives. In general, physicians and patients pro-\nvided concordant perspectives on access to and quality of care in urban and rural ar-\neas. While perceived quality was consistently found to be superior in rural areas, a\nmore complex picture emerged with respect to access.\nBecause rural residents were poorer and less likely to be insured than their ur-\nban peers, they faced greater access problems related to cost. This suggests that\npolicymakers should employ policies aimed at increasing low-income patients'\npurchasing power by expanding safety-net, income assistance, or public health in-\nsurance programs. Even broad-based reforms not specifically targeted to rural ar-\neas would alleviate some of the disparities we observed. These \"demand-side\"\naccess problems could be somewhat mitigated by rural physicians' greater will-\ningness to serve these patients. Although rural physicians worked longer hours\nthan urban physicians, they appeared to be more willing to accept patients for\nwhom they were likely to obtain little or no compensation: Medicaid recipients\nand the uninsured.17 This could be in recognition that few, if any, local alternatives\nexist; however, rural physicians' greater willingness to treat disadvantaged pa-\ntients could also reflect greater \"social capital\" in rural areas--that is, the \"norms\nand networks that enable collective action.\"18\nAlthough rural areas have far fewer physicians than urban areas, our results\nsuggest that in 2000\u00ad01, overall rural supply was adequate to provide access to\ncare on par with that in urban areas. Lower rural supply does not necessarily im-\nply inadequate supply, as geographic differences may reflect oversupply in urban\nareas or differences in patients' demand for care.19 Moreover, for some specialized\nservices, it is reasonable to expect that rural patients will use urban providers.\nIf the supply of rural providers were inadequate, we would expect that patients\nwould have to wait for appointments and that physicians would be unable to ob-\ntain needed services for their patients. We observed neither of these situations.\nLonger travel distances to providers also could be an implication, although this\nwould also be expected because of lower population densities in rural areas. Gen-\nerally, we saw little evidence suggesting that an inadequate supply of providers\nR u r a l H e a l t h C a r e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

One area where provider shortages did ap-\npear to be pervasive is mental health. Rural physicians reported greater difficulties\ngetting these services for their patients and were more likely to cite supply prob-\nlems as the reason. Moreover, rural patients reported fewer mental health visits\nthan their urban counterparts.\nRural health care policy is in a state of flux. With respect to de-\nmand-side programs, Bush administration support for additional commu-\nnity health centers will alleviate patient resource constraints in many rural\nareas, while proposed Medicaid cuts, which are much larger in magnitude, would\nlikely have the opposite effect for at least some segments of the rural and urban\nlow-income populations.\nOn the supply side, MMA contained some $17 billion over ten years in rural\nhealth care subsidies, the price of obtaining key Senate support for the Medicare\ndrug benefit. (Our results predate MMA implementation.) The MMA subsidies\nmostly benefit small rural hospitals, although the Medicare Bonus Payment Pro-\ngram, for physicians practicing in designated shortage areas, was enhanced; the\nMedicare fee formula was altered to increase payments to physicians practicing in\nlow-cost, mostly rural areas; and payments to some other providers were raised.\nHowever, the MMA provisions are now being used to justify deep cuts or elimina-\ntion of a number of other rural health programs in the administration's FY 2006\nbudget.\nAlthough our results do not allow us to make assessments about the appropri-\nate level of support for rural health care, they do suggest that cuts in low-income\nentitlement programs, such as Medicaid, will have a disproportionate effect on ru-\nral populations, where enrollments relative to the size of the population are\nhigher. Our results also suggest that subsidies directed to rural health care provid-\ners would be best targeted to those geographic areas with demonstrated short-\nages. This suggests, for instance, that enhancements to the geographically tar-\ngeted Medicare Bonus Payment Program and some of the smaller programs slated\nfor cuts or elimination may have greater effects on access to care in rural areas than\nthe MMA's broad-based physician payment formula changes and critical-access\nhospital provisions. Finally, broad-based programs might be appropriate when\nthey are focused on a specific type of service, such as mental health care, for which\nwidespread and serious problems have been shown to exist in rural areas.\nSupportforthisresearchcamefromtheRobertWoodJohnsonFoundationthroughitsfundingoftheCenterfor\nStudyingHealthSystemChange.TheauthorsthankCynthiaSaiontz-Martinez,EllenSinger,andValeriy\nBakaushinofSocialandScientificSystemsfortheirprogrammingassistanceaswellasLenNichols,Paul\nGinsburg,KeithMueller,andtheanonymousreviewersfortheircommentsonearlierdrafts.\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
