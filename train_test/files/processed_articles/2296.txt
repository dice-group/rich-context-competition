A cross-national analysis\nof gender and leisure time physical inactivity in Europe\nCharlotte Van Tuyckom, Sarah Van de Velde, Piet Bracke\nDepartment of Sociology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium\nCorrespondence: Charlotte Van Tuyckom, Department of Sociology, Ghent University, Korte Meer 5, 9000 Ghent,\nBackground: It is well known that European women are less physically active in their leisure time than European\nmen. Attempts to explain this gender difference often do not succeed in raising the problem above the individual\nlevel. However, the size of the disadvantage for women varies considerably across countries, proving that leisure\ntime physical (in)activity takes place in a broader societal context and must also be approached as such. In this\nsense, some authors have explained women's lack of leisure time physical activity in terms of gendered power\nrelations in society. Therefore, the present article postulates that over and above the individual effect of gender,\nthere is an additional impact of a society's gender-based (in)equality distribution. Methods: By means of the\n2005 Eurobarometer survey (comprising 25 745 adults from 27 European countries), gender differences in leisure\ntime physical inactivity (LTPI) were analysed by means of multilevel logistic regression analysis. National\ngender-based (in)equality was measured by the Gender Empowerment Measure and the Gender Gap Index.\nResults: Controlled for compositional effects, gender differences in LTPI varied as a function of gender-related\ncharacteristics at the macro-level. In particular, in countries characterized by high levels of gender-based equality,\nLTPI differences between men and women even disappeared. Conclusion: The findings underscore the need\nto adopt a society-level approach and to incorporate socio-contextual factors in the study of gender disparities\nin LTPI.\n.........................................................................................................\nIntroduction\nPhysical activity is an important public health issue and the\nbenefits of an active lifestyle in relation to well-being and\nhealth have been strongly emphasized in recent years in Europe.\nPhysical inactivity is associated with increased risk of chronic\ndiseases and with other disease states, such as hypertension,\ndiabetes, osteoporosis, particular forms of cancer, obesity and even\npsychological disorders. Therefore, the need to increase participation\nin regular physical activity has been identified as one of the most\nprevalent public health burdens of our times. In this regard, it is well\nknown that European women are less physically active in their\n452 European Journal of Public Health\nleisure time than European men.1\u00ad5 Attempts to explain this gender\ndifference generally emphasize women's different abilities, interests\nand choices,6 and consequently do not succeed in raising the\nproblem above the level of the individual. However, the size of the\ndisadvantage for women varies considerably across countries.\nResearch shows that women residing in Southern countries\n(Portugal, Greece, Italy) have the greatest deficit while the levels of\nfemale participation in Scandinavian countries (Sweden, Finland,\nDenmark) and the Netherlands are equal to or higher than those\nof men.7\u00ad9 In addition, in most countries men are more likely to be\nmembers of associations, whereas women's participation is more\nflexible and market oriented. However, there remain considerable\ncross-national differences.10 These differences prove that leisure time\nphysical (in)activity is a thoroughly social phenomenon, which takes\nplace, and finds its meaning for individuals within a broader societal\ncontext4 and must consequently also be approached as such.\nTherefore, recently, some authors11\u00ad13 have explicitly recognized\nthe role of gender- and family-related social policy as a source of\nboth ideological and practical influence on the way gender relations\nare played out in the context of leisure. They have explained\nwomen's lack of leisure time physical activity in terms of the\nreality of their everyday lives, and gendered power relations in\nsociety in particular. Lifestyle and leisure are thus constrained by\nthe lack of equal economic and political power between men and\nwomen. Unfortunately, none of the existing studies on\ncross-national variation in gender differences in leisure time\nphysical (in)activity7\u00ad9 examine the role of this factor in\npreventing or reducing women's opportunities for participation in\nleisure time physical activities. The present article aims to address\nthis gap and postulates that over and above the individual effect of\ngender, there might be an additional impact of a society's\ngender-based (in)equality distribution. Gender differences in\nleisure time physical (in)activity are thus seen to arise out of\nsocietal structures. Rather than viewing gender differences as fixed,\nour question becomes: under what conditions are gender differences\nin leisure time physical (in)activity large, and under what conditions\nsmall? The conditions highlighted in this article are those facilitating\nequal distribution of power and life opportunities for men and\nwomen in different domains, including economic participation,\npolitical empowerment, educational attainment and health and\nwell-being.\nMoreover, an additional interpretation to be considered is that\nprevious reports on cross-national gender differences in leisure\ntime physical (in)activity might reflect a so called `compositional\neffect',14 i.e. when cross-national variation is in fact attributable to\ndifferences in group composition (the characteristics of the individ-\nuals of which the groups are comprised). Such compositional effects\ncould erroneously lead to conclusions about contextual variation in\ngender differences, when in fact the differences are due to\nindividual-level factors in several life domains, such as age, marital\nstatus, educational attainment, urbanizational level and\nemployment, all of which have known effects on leisure time\nphysical inactivity (LTPI).5,15\u00ad18 Unfortunately, previous studies\nhave not ruled out such factors as likely explanations for the vari-\nability of gender differences. Consequently, the contextual (`the\ndifference a place makes') and the compositional (`what's in a\nplace') are often confounded.19\nThe present study examines both compositional and contextual\nsources of cross-national variation of gender differences in LTPI\namong European adults, using data from the 2005 Eurobarometer\nsurvey. The article is structured according to three main objectives.\nThe first is to address the amount of gender differences in LTPI\nacross countries. The second is to examine the compositional\neffects of individual-level factors on cross-national variation in\ngender differences in LTPI. The third is to present relationships\nbetween macro-level factors [gender-based (in)equality] and\ngender disparities in LTPI.\nMethods\nSample\nEurobarometer surveys in which LTPI was assessed in all 27\nEuropean Member States. A multistage random sample design was\nused and to ensure national representative samples,\npost-stratification weights were applied in each country according\nto demographic factors (gender, age and town size) using the most\nrecent census data.20 Data on individuals aged !18 years were\n1512 (Germany) conducted interviews in each country (table 1).\nMeasurement\nIndividual-level factors\nThe dependent variable in the analysis, LTPI, was assessed by means\nof the question: `In the last 7 days, how much physical activity did\nyou get from recreation, sport and leisure time activities?' Answer\nous outcome was created, with respondents answering `none'\ndefined as physically inactive in their leisure time, all others as\nactive [we have performed some exploratory sensitivity analyses\nwith a different operationalization of the outcome variable, i.e.\nwith both respondents answering `none' and `little' as physically\ninactive in their leisure time, and the others as active (see also\nprevious research9). More specifically, we have re-analysed all\nmodels, and although the coefficients were different, the results\nwere generally robust against the change in operationalization\nimplying that the main conclusions about macro-level influences\nTable 1 Sample details and LTPI percentages for the 2005\nEurobarometer survey\nCountries N LTPI v2 test\nStudy of gender disparities in LTPI 453\nof gender (in)equality were upheld with a slightly different\ndichotomization of the outcome variable].\nThe independent variables age, marital status, educational attain-\nment, urbanizational level and employment were introduced into\nthe equations to control for cross-national differences in the com-\nposition of LTPI-determining characteristics.\nMacro-level factors\nTwo international composite measures of gender-based (in)equality\nwere introduced: the United Nations Development Programme's\nGender Empowerment Measure (GEM) and the World Economic\nForum's Gender Gap Index (GGI) (both measured in 2005). The\nGEM captures gender differences in life opportunities in three areas:\n(i) economic participation, measured by women's and men's\npercentage shares of positions as legislators, senior officials and\nmanagers; and by women's and men's percentage shares of profes-\nsional and technical positions; (ii) political participation, measured\nby women's and men's percentage shares in parliamentary seats; and\n(iii) power over economic resources, measured by women's and\nmen's estimated earned income (PPP US$).\nThe GGI complements and expands on the GEM in that it\ncombines quantitative data sets with qualitative measures from the\nExecutive Opinion Survey of the World Economic Forum, a survey\ndomains: (i) economic participation, measured by male and female\nunemployment levels, levels of economic activity and remuneration\nfor equal work; (ii) economic opportunity, measured by duration of\nmaternity leave, number of women in managerial positions, avail-\nability of government-provided childcare, wage inequalities between\nmen and women; (iii) political empowerment, measured by the\nnumber of female ministers, share of seats in parliament, women\nholding senior legislative and managerial positions, number of years\na female has been head of the state; (iv) educational attainment,\nmeasured by literacy rates, enrolment rates for primary, secondary\nand tertiary education, average years of schooling; and (v) health\nand well-being, measured by effectiveness of governments' efforts to\nreduce poverty and inequality, adolescent fertility rate, percentage of\nbirths attended by skilled health staff and maternal and infant\nmortality rates.\nFor technical details on the GEM, see http://hdr.undp.org/en/\nmeasures, higher scores reflect higher levels of gender-based equality.\nStatistical analysis\nIn the present article, the following questions are raised:\n(i) nationally, how is gender related to LTPI?\n(ii) having taken account of individual, compositional character-\nistics, is there still cross-national variation in gender\ndisparities? and\n(iii) how do country-level characteristics measuring gender-based\n(in)equality account for the gender disparities in LTPI\nbetween countries?\nUnfortunately, most existing methodologies are problematic in\nthe manner in which contextual factors are implemented. The\nmore recent multilevel methodologies, however, provide a compre-\nhensive framework to empirically address the key contextual consid-\nerations of our research question5,14. By performing a multilevel\nanalysis, the clustered structure (individuals at level-1 and\ncountries at level-2) is taken into account and accurate estimations\nof individual standard errors are obtained. Moreover, by explicitly\nmaintaining countries as a contextual level, it is reasoned that\nimportant processes of social, political and/or economic nature\noperating at this level might have a bearing on gender differentials\nin LTPI.\nA three-step sequential modelling strategy is adopted with\ncomplexity being increased in every successive model. The focus of\neach of the models is described below.\nUnconditional or null model\nBefore estimating the individual-level multilevel models, it is\nappropriate to begin by estimating a model with no predictors at\neither level to test whether significant variation in LTPI exists across\ncountries (and consequently multilevel modelling is appropriate).\nMoreover, in order to understand how much of the overall\nvariance in LTPI is attributable to either the individual or the\ncountry level, it is useful to calculate the intraclass correlation\ncoefficient (ICC), [The intraclass correlation coefficient for linear\nmultilevel models is obtained by the following formula:\nHowever, in non-linear models, such as our Bernoulli model, this\nformula is less useful because the individual-level variance\nis heteroscedastic.22 Snijders and Bosker23 describe an alternative\ndefinition of the ICC for non-linear models as follows:\n \u00bc \u00f000=00 \u00fe 2=3\u00de. This definition treats the dependent variable\nas an underlying latent continuous variable following a logistic dis-\ntribution of which the variance is 2=3], which measures the\nproportion of the variance of the dependent variable that exists\nbetween countries.\nIndividual-level model controlling for\ncompositional effects\nCross-national variation in gender differences could occur as a result\nof known individual risk factors for gender differences in LTPI. To\ntest for such compositional effects, gender differences are adjusted\nfor age, marital status, educational attainment, urbanizational level\nand employment. If the pattern of variation in gender differences\nreflects a compositional effect related to (one of) these factors, we\nwould expect a reduction in the variation after controlling for these\nindividual-level factors. Both the intercept and the gender effect have\nbeen allowed to vary across countries (i.e. to be random), while the\neffects of all other variables are constrained to be the same across\ncountries (i.e. to be fixed).\nCross-level model\nTo examine the impact of national-level gender-based (in)equality\ncharacteristics, a series of cross-level interaction models are tested.\nFor presentation purposes, countries are grouped in low, medium\nand high groups based on the tertile scores of the relevant macro-\nlevel indicators. To test whether significant cross-level interactions\nexist, interaction terms between gender and the country subgroups\nare computed separately for each of the gender-based (in)equality\nmeasures and tested against the main effect model.\nSince the response variable has two possible outcomes, logistic\nmultilevel (Bernoulli) models based on a logit-link function are\nused. Models were fitted using the hierarchical linear modelling\n(HLM) 6.3 software.24 The probability of LTPI occurrence is\nestimated by calculation of multivariate odds ratio.\nBefore analysing gender-based inequality in LTPI in a multilevel\nframework, the total LTPI percentages for each country, those for\nmen and women separately, and women's LTPI rate as percentage of\nmen's were computed. In addition, the gender differences in LTPI\nwere examined using the 2 measure in SPSS 17.0. The results of\nthese analyses are presented in table 1.\nResults\nLTPI differences across countries\nThe countries in table 1 are ranked according to their total LTPI\nvalues, with Portugal and Romania as the most inactive nations:\n454 European Journal of Public Health\naround six out of 10 adult citizens are physically inactive in their\nleisure time. Finland is the least inactive country with only less than\ntwo out of 10 Finns aged !18 years reporting being totally inactive\nin their leisure time. In general, LTPI seem to increase when moving\nfrom the north to the south in Europe, and East Europeans generally\nseem to have higher scores than West Europeans (with Lithuania,\nSlovenia and to a lesser degree Latvia as exceptions). Moreover, for\n23 of the countries, women have higher LTPI prevalences than men.\nThis gender gap is, however, only significant (at P 0.05) in 15 of\nthese countries. The size of the gender differences varies considerably\nacross countries, being largest in Cyprus (19.50%). For four\ncountries in our sample (i.e. Sweden, Finland, The Netherlands\nand Lithuania), men have higher LTPI scores than women.\nHowever, this gender difference is significant in none of the\ncountries. For men, the lowest LTPI score is found in Austria\nThe highest LTPI is found for both men and women in Romania and\nPortugal.\nMultilevel models\nUnconditional or null model\nThe results of our unconditional model show that statistically sig-\nnificant variance in LTPI exists at the country level (variance\nthat the multilevel nature of LTPI should not be ignored.\nMoreover, the proportion of the variance in LTPI that exists\nauthors,25 the individual level usually accounts for a great deal of\nthe variance when data are measured at the individual level.\nMoreover, the variance found here is congruent with previous\nstudies into leisure time physical (in)activity in Europe,5 but may\nwell be an artefact of not taking into account key compositional\ncharacteristics. This is corrected for in the model shown in table 2,\nwhich represents a simple multilevel model where the level-2 gender\nvariation is estimated after allowing for, and conditional on, selected\nindividual, compositional effects.\nIndividual-level model: controlling for\ncompositional effects\nTable 2 shows the odds ratios (ORs) of gender on LTPI before and\nafter adjustment for compositional effects (ORs of all fixed effects\navailable upon request from the authors). After allowing for\nindividual characteristics, a 2 test shows that significant variation\nin gender differences in LTPI between countries remains even\nthough the amount of variation decreased a little from 0.034 to\n0.033 (The ICC after including both individual-level variables and\nother words, that the variation in gender differences in LTPI cannot\nbe accounted for by individual confounders alone and hence\ncountry-context matters.\nCross-level models\nBefore turning to the cross-level models, a model containing the\ncontextual variables in addition to the compositional variables was\nestimated. Each of the contextual variables (included separately) was\nsignificant at P 0.001. Moreover, an exploratory aggregate\nbivariate analysis showed that women's LTPI rate as percentage of\nmen's was positively related to both the GEM (Spearman's  = 0.543\nindicating that in countries characterized by more gender-based\nequality, the LTPI rates of women tend to approach those of men.\nOur multilevel analyses confirm that the ORs of gender on LTPI\nvary across country subgroups (table 3). The coefficients for the\ngroup of countries characterized by high levels of gender-based\nequality differ significantly (at P 0.001) from those for the group\nof countries characterized by low and medium gender-based\nequality, respectively. In countries characterized by low or\nmedium gender-based equality, significant gender differences in\nLTPI can be noticed, with European women reporting being\naround 1.4 times more physically inactive in their leisure time\ncompared with men (with P 0.001). In countries characterized\nby high levels of gender-based equality, differences between men\nand women disappear.\nDiscussion\nBy studying samples from all European Union countries, the present\nstudy showed that the magnitude of gender differences in LTPI\nvaries cross-nationally, a finding that is consistent with some\nrecent European studies on gender and leisure time physical\n(in)activity.1\u00ad3,9. Compared with these studies, the major strength\nof our analyses was that a more powerful statistical method\nwas used. Adopting multilevel methodologies gives a much\nstronger basis for making judgements about cross-national variabil-\nity. Through controlling for potential confounders (age, marital\nstatus, educational attainment, urbanizational level and\nemployment), it was found that the cross-national variation of\ngender differences in LTPI was highly robust for compositional\neffects. The key finding, however, was that gender differences in\nLTPI varied as a function of gender-related characteristics at the\nmacro-level. In countries characterized by a high level of equal\nopportunities between men and women in several life domains,\ngender differences in LTPI seemed to be absent, net of all\nindividual-level effects. National gender-based (in)equality thus\nseems to have implications for the way in which men and women\nconstruct their individual (and household) lifestyles, and fundamen-\ntally affects the broader context in which leisure time physical\n(in)activity occurs. Our results show that especially countries with\nTable 2 Results of multilevel Bernoulli regression modelling of LTPI\namong Europeans, OR for gender (reference category = males),\nbefore and after adjustment for compositional effects (i.e. age,\nmarital status, educational attainment, urbanization level and\nemployment) + variance of intercept and gender term\nBefore adjustment\nfor compositional\neffects\nAfter adjustment\nfor compositional\neffects\nOR for gender\nVariance of\nintercept (SE)\nVariance of gender\nterm (SE)\nTable 3 Results of multilevel Bernoulli regression modelling of LTPI\namong Europeans, OR for gender (reference category = males),\nafter adjustment for compositional effects (i.e. age, marital status,\neducational attainment, urbanization level and employment).\nCountries grouped into low, medium and high based on the tertile\nscores of the GEM and GGI, respectively\nGEM OR gender (95% CI) GGI OR gender (95% CI)\nStudy of gender disparities in LTPI 455\ngender-empowering social policies constitute a social context that\nhas positive consequences for gender disparities in LTPI. Removing\ninequality between men's and women's participation in leisure time\nactivities will therefore require far more than simply European-wide\nmass media campaigns aimed at convincing women to become\nphysically active in their leisure time. Instead of such individually\noriented approach, public health policy should adopt a society-level\nperspective in addressing gender disparities in LTPI. In most\ncountries, women still bear the major responsibilities for\nhousehold duties and childcare while men bear the major responsi-\nbility for generating income. In the absence of radical changes in\ngender roles within the family, the aim of reducing inequality\nbetween men and women may best be served by facilitating\nparental (female) employment by reducing the conflicting\ndemands of paid work and childcare while at the same time\nrestructuring the organization of work to reduce the time burden,\non women in particular. Evidently, a more nuanced and detailed\nunderstanding is needed of the implications of countries' social\npolicies aimed at narrowing unequal opportunities in several life\ndomains between men and women.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no previous study on leisure time\nphysical (in)activity has looked at gender disparities from a\nmultilevel perspective. Despite this major strength, however, we\nshould also note some limitations.\nFirst, the external validity of the findings might be difficult to\nascertain. Although intentionally two different macro-level\nindicators of gender-based (in)equality were included (the GEM\nand the GGI), their conceptual basis has been questioned by some\nauthors on the grounds that they are composites of conceptually\nvery different indicators.26 As a tool for testing hypotheses about\nvery specific mechanisms, these indicators might indeed be of\nrelatively limited heuristic value. Nevertheless, in the context of\nthis study, both indicators proved to be useful and support the\nview that macro-level gender-related factors need to be taken into\naccount when studying gender differences in LTPI from a\ncross-national perspective. And although exploratory analyses with\nthe subcomponents of the GEM and the GGI provided more or less\nsimilar results, a natural next step for future studies would be to\nincorporate particular national, political, economic, cultural,\neducation- and health-based factors as moderators of cross-national\ngender differences in LTPI.\nSecondly, cross-national comparison of data such as in the present\nstudy might involve several sources of bias, among which method\nbias. However, although inevitable variation in the data collection\nexists (e.g. influence from the reviewer), the available documenta-\ntion20 suggests no bias with respect to the countries' adherence to\nthe protocol.\nThirdly, although our analyses were controlled for urbanizational\nlevel (a proxy indicator of within-country regional differences), from\nan empirical perspective, it would be interesting to evaluate the\nrelative contribution of gender-based (in)equality at different\ncontextual levels such as regions or communities. Unfortunately,\nalthough extensions of the debate fit perfectly within our\nmultilevel framework, regional data on this subject are not available.\nFourthly, our study relies on cross-sectional data so that the im-\nplications of change over time could not be assessed. In this regard,\nlongitudinal studies might be interesting to both confirm and extend\nour cross-sectional findings.\nFifthly, although the Eurobarometer data were the best available,\nthe self-reported single-question registration of leisure time physical\n(in)activity might under- or overestimate real levels and might vary\nacross subgroups. Moreover, there might have been some variation\nbetween countries in how respondents understood what was covered\nby `physical activity from recreation, sport and leisure time activities'\n(other research27 provides a more in-depth discussion on this\nproblem of `equivalence of meaning'). In addition, with a\nreference period of 7 days, weather influences might also give\nsome bias to the results. Unfortunately, objective or multi-item\nleisure time physical (in)activity data are not available in all\nEuropean countries, or at least not in sufficient detail for\ncross-national comparison. In addition, our data are restricted to\nphysical (in)activity in leisure time, and any inferences pertain only\nto this form of activity. Consequently, the mentioned effects might\nbe contradictory. For example, a factor hampering leisure time\nphysical activity at the cultural level might at the same time\nincrease the propensity to become physically active in other\nsettings such as during gardening or household work. Research\nfrom 20044 has shown that high percentages of leisure time\nphysical activity go hand in hand with relatively low levels of\nphysical activity beyond the leisure sphere. According to this\nstudy, Scandinavians, for instance, seem to be involved in leisure\ntime physical activities to a large extent while (or possibly because)\nthey are comparatively inactive at work, in and around the house or\nwhen moving from place to place. However, results from a 2007\nEuropean study27 did not confirm these `compensation\nmechanisms'. What is certain, is that demographics (i.e. an\nincrease in elderly citizens) and many cultural drivers (i.e. a\ndecrease in activity derived through housework and self-powered\ntransport; a declining trend for physically demanding jobs) are\npushing us towards a more sedentary rather than a more active\nEuropean Union. However, outside of physical activity in the\nleisure time, the opportunities to promote other types of physical\nactivities are rather limited. It is difficult to envisage public inter-\nvention policies aimed specifically at promoting gardening or\ndo-it-yourself tasks. Moreover, apart from using the stairs instead\nof the elevator, or from jogging during lunch time, it sounds rather\nridiculous to formulate government recommendations aimed at\nincreasing the physical burden of jobs. Therefore, we suggest the\nimportant contribution of physical leisure time activities to health\n(among which the prevention or control of overweight and obesity)\nprimarily through the extent to which it contributes towards\nincreasing physical activity, although there is also evidence to\nsuggest that the social engagement aspects of leisure time physical\nactivity are beneficial in their own right.28\nKey points\n Attempts to explain gender differences in LTPI often do not\nsucceed in raising the problem above the level of the\nindividual. However, the cross-national differences found\nprove that LTPI is a social phenomenon that should also\nbe approached as such.\n Compared with previous studies, the major strength of our\nanalyses was that a more powerful statistical method was\nused. Adopting multilevel methodologies gives a much\nstronger basis for making judgements about cross-national\nvariability. It was found that the cross-national variation of\ngender differences in LTPI was highly robust for compos-\nitional effects.\n Our study shows that national gender-based (in)equality has\nimplications for the way in which men and women construct\ntheir individual (and household) lifestyle, and fundamen-\ntally affects the broader context in which leisure time\nphysical activity occurs, or does not occur. Especially\ncountries with gender-empowering social policies\nconstitute a social context that has positive consequences\nfor gender disparities in LTPI.\n Removing inequality between men's and women's participa-\ntion in leisure time activities will thus require far more than\nsimply European-wide mass media campaigns aimed at\nconvincing women to become physically active in their\nleisure time. Instead of such individually oriented\napproach, public health policy should adopt a society-level\nperspective in addressing gender disparities.\n456 European Journal of Public Health\nConflicts of interest: None declared.\nReferences\n1 Hartmann-Tews I.
