A multilevel logistic modelFincluding an\ninteraction term between the country's GNP and each woman's SESFindicates that obesity starts to fuel health inequities in the\ndeveloping world when the GNP reaches a value of about US$2500 per capita.\nCONCLUSIONS: For most upper-middle income economies and part of the lower-middle income economies, obesity among\nadult women is already a relevant booster of health inequities and, in the absence of concerted national public actions to prevent\nobesity, economic growth will greatly expand the list of developing countries where this situation occurs.\nKeywords: socioeconomic status; inequities in health; developing countries; GNP per capita\nIntroduction\nThere is abundant documentation in the developing coun-\ntries on the burden of nutritional deficiencies, infections,\nand maternal and perinatal problems being highly concen-\ntrated among the poor; however, much less information is\navailable on the inequities in health concerning noncom-\nmunicable diseases, including obesityFa disease in great\nexpansion at the global level.1\nAn exhaustive review of the literature, based on studies\npopulations and only 14 in developing populations) con-\ncluded that socioeconomic status (SES) and women's obesity\ntended to be inversely related in developed populations and\ndirectly related in developing populations. In nearly 90% of\nthe studies on developing populations, women's obesity was\nfound to be more frequent among the higher SES groups; in\nnearly 10%, no association was detected; and none of the\nstudies found obesity more prevalent among the lower SES\ngroups.2 In other words, until the late 1980s, there was no\ndocumented evidence that women's obesity could fuel\ninequities in health in the developing world.\nMore recent studies on SES and women's obesity in\ndeveloping populations indicate a different situation. In\nsome middle-income developing countries (eg, Chile,3\n\u00b8ao6), case studies conducted between\nassociations, between SES and women's obesity.

The China and Mexico data sets are from\nnational health and nutrition surveys conducted by these\ndata set corresponds to the World Bank Living Standard\nother national data sets correspond to standardized USAID/\nMacro Demographic Health Surveys (DHSs)13 conducted\nfrom http://www.macroint.com/dhs/ or obtained directly\nfrom the State Statistical Offices (SSOs) that conducted the\nsurveys. We used only the most recent data for countries in\nwhich two or more DHSs were conducted in the period.\nWe restricted our analyses in all data sets to nonpregnant\nwomen aged 20\u00ad49 y. In the case of the DHSs, most women\nwere mothers of children under 5 years of age. The average\nnonresponse rates were less than 0.2% for weight and height\nmeasurements and less than 0.7% for questions on SES.\nWe considered the following variables in our analyses:\nobesity status (body mass index (BMI) Z30.0 kg/m2), age\ngroups (5-year intervals) and SES. Weight and height\nmeasurements were obtained in all surveys following\nstandard procedures.14 We used relative levels of formal\neducation in each country as a proxy of overall SESFna-\nmely, the country's quartiles of the women's years of\nschooling. Cutpoints for the quartiles were selected in each\ncountry in such a way that each quartile would contain, as\nclose as possible, one-fourth of the studied population. In\ncountries where years of schooling were too clustered around\ncertain values (eg zero years), we were able to define only\nthree or two SES groups. In the case of two groups we labelled\nthem as Q1 (the lower quartile) and Q4 (the higher quartile).\nIn the case of three groups we labelled them as Q1, Q2 or Q3\n(according to which was bigger of Q4 and Q1, respectively)\nand Q4. We used the gross national product (GNP) per capita\nat the year of the survey to express the level of economic\ndevelopment of each country included in the analyses. For\ncertain analyses we grouped the studied countries into (a)\nlow-income economies (GNP oUS$745 per capita), (b)\ncapita), and (c) upper-middle-income economies (GNP Z\nUS$2995 per capita). The World Bank was the source for both\nthe GNP values (all deflated for 2001) and the GNP-based\ncountry's classification.\nWe initially calculated for each country the overall age-\nstandardized prevalence of obesity using the direct method\nof standardization, and having the age distribution of the\nworld population15 as a reference (survey-specific sample\nweights were used, so all estimates are nationally represen-\ntativeFexcept for the China survey, which only represents\neight provinces). We also calculated for each country the age-\nstandardized prevalence of obesity among women belonging\nto different SES groups. To summarize and test the direction\nof the association between SES and obesity in each country,\nwe calculated age-standardized prevalence ratios (with 95%\nconfidence intervals) in the higher SES groupFhaving the\nlower SES group as a reference. To specifically address the\nhypothesis that the direction and intensity of the association\nbetween SES and obesity would vary across the countriesF\ndepending on the country's level of economic develop-\nmentFwe first merged all national data sets into one single\ndata set. In this single world data set, we studied the\nassociation between SES and obesity in three strata of\ncountries grouped as low-income, lower-middle-income,\nand upper-middle-income economies. The null hypothesis\nof homogeneity of the associations across the strata was\ntested using the Mantel-Haenszel statistic.16\nAfter testing the homogeneity of the associations between\nSES and obesity across the country's GNP categories, and as a\nfinal step of our analytical strategy, we ran a multilevel\nlogistic model17 on the risk of obesity having as explanatory\nvariables: women's age (5-y intervals), women's SES (educa-\ntion quartiles), the country's GNP per capita, and an\ninteraction term between the women's SES and the country's\nGNP per capita. From this model we produced predicted\nprobabilities of obesity for each SES group at different levels\nof economic development. We evaluated the statistical\nsignificance of each model parameter, including the inter-\naction term, using the Wald test. We assessed the perfor-\nmance of the logistic model in predicting obesity probability\nby calculating the area under the ROC (receiving operator\ncharacteristic) curve (this area is equal to the probability that\na random obese woman in the sample has a higher predicted\nprobability of obesity than a random nonobese woman).18\nBoth the one-level and the multilevel statistical analyses of\nthis study took into account survey sampling weights and\ndesign effects resulting from the specific sample design\nNational wealth, individual SES, and obesity\nCA Monteiro et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nemployed by each individual survey. We used STATA\nstatistical software19 for one-level analyses and MlwiN\nmultilevel modelling software20 for multilevel analyses.\nResults\nFigure 1 plots the age-standardized prevalence of obesity\nagainst the GNP per capita for 37 developing countries.\nAlthough not linear, obesity prevalence clearly tended to\nincrease with the level of GNP per capita. Almost two-third\nof the variability found in national obesity figures (from\n0.3% in Vietnam to 34.2% in Jordan) could be explained by\nthe logarithm of the country's GNP per capita.\nTable 1 displays the social distribution of women's obesity\nin the same 37 developing countries ordered according to\nGNP per capita. It is clear that not only was the overall\nprevalence of obesity influenced by the country's GNP level,\nbut also its social distribution. In countries with low-income\neconomies (n \u00bc 21), obesity tended to increase strongly with\nquartiles of women's formal education (our country-specific\nSES measure). In these countries, the risk of obesity in the\nhigher SES group was often five or 10 times higher than in\nthe lower SES group. In countries with lower-middle-income\neconomies (n \u00bc 12), the pattern of association between SES\nand obesity was mixed. We found direct association between\nSES and obesity in Bolivia, Senegal, Egypt, Morocco,\nGuatemala, Namibia, and Peru; no association in Uzbekistan,\nKazakhstan, Colombia, and Peru; and inverse association in\nDominican Republic and Jordan. Finally, in the upper-\nmiddle-income economies (Turkey, South Africa, Brazil,\nand Mexico) the risk of obesity was always significantly\nhigher in the lower than in higher SES group.\nTable 2 describes homogeneity tests concerning\nthe association between women's SES and obesity across\nlow, lower-middle and upper-middle-income economies.\nIt was clear that as the country GNP increased, the\nrelative excess of obesity of the higher SES group decreased,\nor was even reverted. For instance, the age-standardized\nprevalence ratio for obesity among women in the higher SES\ngroup vis-a\n`-vis the lower SES group was reduced from 2.63 to\nsuccessively low-income, lower-middle-income and upper-\nmiddle-income economies. Similar trends were observed\nwhen we compared women in the intermediate SES groups\nto women in the lower SES group. The hypothesis of\nhomogeneity of the association between women's SES and\nobesity was refuted in all comparisons (P-value o0.0001),\nand this indicated that the level of economic development\nwas a statistically significant modifier of the SES effect on\nobesity.\nFigure 2 displays predictive estimates from a two-level\nlogistic model that included as explanatory variables of\nobesity: women's age, women's SES, the logarithm of the\ncountry's GNP per capita, and an interaction term between\nwomen's SES and the country's GNP (all terms significant at\nPo0.0001Fmodel parameters are available from the authors\nupon request). The area under the ROC curve for this model\nconfirm the great influence of the country's economic\ndevelopment on the association between SES and obesity\nand show that the predicted probability of women's obesity\nin the lower SES group exceeds the same probability in the\nhigher SES group at a GNP value of approximately US$2500\nper capita. Essentially, this indicated that US$2500 is the\nGNP value `necessary' to make women's obesity fuel health\ninequities in the developing world.\nDiscussion\nmiddle-age women living in 37 developing countries\nprovided us with the opportunity to analyze the social\ndistribution of obesity in a relatively recent period\nand stages of economic development (GNP from US$190 to\n4440 per capita). Our results show that belonging to the\nlower SES group confers a strong protection against obesity in\nlow-income economies (GNP below US$745 per capita), but it\nFigure 1 The relationship between the prevalence of women's obesity and Gross National Product per capita in 37 developing countries (1992\u00ad2000).\nNational wealth, individual SES, and obesity\nCA Monteiro et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nis a systematic risk factor for the disease in upper-middle-\nincome economies (GNPZUS$2995 per capita). A multilevel\nlogistic model including an interaction term between the\ncountry's GNP and each woman's SES indicated that obesity\nstarts to fuel health inequities in the developing world when\nthe GNP reaches a value of about US$2500 per capita. These\nresults show a much greater nuance about obesity and SES in\nthe developing world than heretofore presented.2\nTable 1 Age-standardized prevalence of obesity in women 20\u00ad49 y by quartiles of years of education (Q) in 37 developing countries ordered according to GNP per\nPrevalence ratio\nObesity (%) Q4 vs Q1\nTable 2 Age-standardized prevalence ratio (and 0.95 CI) for women's obesity by quartiles (Q) of years of education in low, lower-middle, and upper-middle-\nGNP Number of\n*P-value for homogeneity of prevalence ratios across GNP country categories.\nNational wealth, individual SES, and obesity\nCA Monteiro et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nThe nationwide probabilistic samples, large sample sizes,\nwide range of stages of economic development and regions\nof the world, highly standardized data collection procedures,\nand appropriate multilevel analysesFall favour the internal\nand external validity of our findings. The main limitation of\nour study is that it only surveyed women of reproductive\nages, most of them mothers of one or more children under 5\nyears of age. This fact probably biased our national estimates\nof obesity toward higher values given the fact that pregnancy\ncan be a contributory factor to obesity. In addition, it may be\nthat women who have lower education may be more likely\nto be represented in our national data sets. However, it is less\nlikely that the selection bias toward women of reproductive\nages with young children could affect substantially the\npattern of association between SES and obesity observed in\ndifferent GNP intervals.\nA recent national study on the social distribution of\nobesity conducted among the whole adult female population\nof the more, and the less, economically developed regions of\nshowed findings similar to the ones described by our\ninternational study: obese women were more common\namong the top 25% richer families in the lower-income\nfamilies) while in the higher-income region obese women\nwere more common among the bottom 25% poorer families\nAnother limitation of our study is the use of a single\nproxyFeducational levelFto assess SES. Although educa-\ntion is the SES indicator easiest to measure and with greatest\ncross cultural relevance,22 income or occupation may be a\nbetter measure of an individual's social status in some\npopulations.23 Unfortunately, data on income and occupa-\ntion were not available in all surveys.\nThe reasons the lower SES groups in the developing\npopulations were protected against obesity have been\nusually explained as being related to (a) food scarcity and\npatterns of high-energy expenditures commonly found\namong the poor; (b) the greater capacity of the elite to\nobtain adequate food supplies, and cultural values favouring\nfat body shapes.2 Most likely, these same reasons explain the\ngreater obesity among lower SES women in developing\ncountries with low-income economies.\nExplanations of the inverse association between women's\nobesity and SES, shown to exist in part of the lower-middle-\nincome and all upper-middle-income economies, are com-\nplex and more research on this topic is certainly necessary.\nLikely reasons are: (1) after a certain level of economic\ngrowthFexpressed by a GNP of about US$2500 per capita,\naccording to our estimatesFlack of food and or high energy\nexpenditure patterns are no longer common in the society,\neven among its poorer social segments and (2) the lower\nlevel of education and health-related knowledge among the\npoor, coupled with a greater difficulty to acquire more\nexpensive low-energy dense foods (eg, fruits, vegetables, and\nwhole-grain cereals), less leisure-time, and fewer opportu-\nnities for recreational exercise.1\u00ad2 Furthermore, people living\nin circumstances of low SES may be more at the mercy of an\nobesogenic environment because their eating and activity\nare more likely the `default choices' on offer.24\nRegardless of the explanations underlying the shifting of\nobesity toward the poorest SES groups in part of the\ndeveloping world, this phenomenon has important policy\nimplications. First, for many developing countries (most or\nall upper-middle-income economies, and part of the lower-\nmiddle-income economies), obesity should be seenFat least\namong womenFas a relevant booster of the already high\nhealth inequities generated by the exhaustively documented\nunequal social distribution of nutritional deficiencies, in-\nfectious diseases, and maternal and perinatal conditions. It\nshould be noted that, in addition to being a disease in its\nown right, obesity substantially increases the risk of several\nFigure 2 The predicted prevalence of women's obesity among the lower and the higher SES groups at different country GNP levels.\nNational wealth, individual SES, and obesity\nCA Monteiro et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nfatal and nonfatal, but highly debilitating, noncommunic-\nable diseasesFparticularly cardiovascular diseases, non-\ninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, several endocrine and\nmetabolic disturbances, sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis, certain\ntypes of cancer, and several psychological problems.1\nSecond, in the absence of concerted national public actions\nto prevent obesity in the developing world, economic\ngrowthFa highly desirable and needed goal for any\ndeveloping countryFwill tend to greatly expand the list of\ndeveloping countries where obesity will fuel inequities in\nhealth.\nFinally, our results make it most clear that public actions to\nprevent both obesity and obesity-related health inequities in\nthe developing world should include population education\nstrategiesFnot restricted to the eliteFon the determinants\nand consequences of obesity as well as changes in the\nphysical, economic, and sociocultural environment that\nmake healthier choices concerning diet and physical activity\nbehaviours feasible for all social classes.\n"
