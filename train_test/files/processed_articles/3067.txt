The number of participating hospitals ranged from 400 to 494.\nMain Outcome Measures Annual rates of TBI-related hospitalization, stratified\nby age, sex, severity of injury, and outcome.\nResults The annual number of TBI cases identified from the sample during the study\nperiod ranged from 1611 to 3129.

We could not perform an ex-\ntensive analysis of TBI incidence by\ncause of injury, because such data were\nincomplete; ICD-9-CM external-cause-\nof-injury codes (E codes) were pre-\ning the period of this study.\nWe used commercially available sta-\ntistical software to calculate crude hos-\npitalizationincidenceratesforeachyear,\nusing as denominators the US Census\nestimates for the national civilian popu-\nlation at midyears during this interval.\nGeneralized variance estimation func-\ntions that were provided by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics were\nused to generate confidence intervals\n(CIs) for rates.

We compared\ntween end points of the entire time in-\nterval, using z scores to test for differ-\nences in rates. To test for differences in\npercent change of hospitalization rates\nbetween categories of TBI severity, we\ncalculated z scores using variance ap-\nproximation methods.11\nTo compare estimated rates of TBI-\nassociated hospitalization with TBI-\nassociated emergency department (ED)\nvisits, we used data collected by the Na-\ntional Hospital Ambulatory Medical\nvariance estimates associated with in-\ndividual years of the survey were large,\nwe calculated the average annual rate\nof TBI-associated ED visits for the in-\nscribed elsewhere.13 As with the analy-\nsis of National Hospital Discharge\nSurvey data, TBI cases were identified\namong National Hospital Ambulatory\nMedical Care Survey records by search-\ning all 3 diagnostic fields for ICD-\n9-CM codes consistent with the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention\ncase definition.

First,\nhas been attributed in part to successes\nin injury prevention, especially those\nassociated with motor vehicles.4 In our\nstudy, because external cause of injury\nwas not consistently available in the\nNationalHospitalDischargeSurveydata,\nwe cannot directly assess any effects of\ninjury prevention on trends in TBI-\nrelatedhospitalizationsduringthestudy\ninterval.Nevertheless,ifsuccessininjury\npreventionweretheonlyfactorcontrib-\nutingtothedecreaseinTBI-relatedhos-\npitalization, then we would expect the\ndecreases in rates of TBI-related hospi-\ntalization and TBI-related death to be\nsimilar in proportion; we might also\nexpect a similar decrease in TBI-related\nhospitalization rates among all levels of\ninjury severity. However, in contrast to\nthe 22% decline in the TBI-associated\ndata demonstrate a disproportionately\ngreater decline in TBI-related hospital-\nization rates--51% during the interval\nof this study--with the decline found\nmainly among injuries of mild severity.\nto 1994, the rate of hospitalization for\nall causes declined 29%, suggesting a\nchange in hospital practices for admis-\nsions.14 Inastudyofhospitalserviceuti-\nlization and expenditures during this\nperiod, a reduction in inpatient ser-\nvices was associated with an increase in\noutpatient services, a shift attributed to\nthegrowinginfluenceofprospectivepay-\nment system reimbursement and man-\naged care.15 Thus, hospital admission\npolicies may now exclude a larger pro-\nportion of patients with mild TBI.\nHospital admission practices for TBI\nalso may be affected by improved diag-\nnostic technology. More frequent ED-\nbased CT scanning may shift treat-\nment of milder TBIs from hospital\ninpatient services to outpatient ser-\nvices. However, this effect may be lim-\nited, since only 26% of ED visits for TBI\nA shift in TBI care toward the ED can-\nnot be measured directly, because\nwe are unable to compare rates of\nTBI-related ED visits with rates of TBI-\nrelated hospital admissions through-\nout the study period. However, the esti-\nmated rate of TBI-related ED visits in\nmillion cases each year in the United\nStates--indicatesthatabout80%ofper-\nsons now evaluated for TBI are not\nadmitted to hospitals.\nThe increased rate of TBIs classified\nas severe runs counter to all other trends\nfound in these data. Three factors might\naccount for this phenomenon. The in-\ncreased number of cases classified as se-\nvere may be influenced by changes in\nICD-9-CM coding practices during this\nperiod that decreased the assignment\nof nonspecific codes and increased the\nassignment of codes with specific se-\nverity information. Also, increased re-\nliance on CT scanning and improved\nimaging during this study period may\nhave increased the detection of trauma-\nrelated intracranial lesions, again lead-\nFigure 1.

In addition, improvements in\ntrauma care during the interval of this\nstudy may have increased the propor-\ntion of critically injured persons who\nsurvive long enough to be admitted to\nhospitals, thereby increasing the num-\nber of cases classified as severe.\nOur analysis has several limitations.\nThe accuracy of our estimate of trends\nin the TBI severity distribution de-\npends on correct ICD-9-CM diagnostic\ncoding that is consistent over time\namong all hospitals in the sample. Limi-\ntationsintheaccuracyofdiagnosticcod-\ning performed in hospitals have been\nnoted since the beginning of this study\nperiod.16 Furthermore, coincident with\nthe increased use of prospective pay-\nment systems, coding practices appear\nto have evolved toward increased use of\ncodes denoting more specific and se-\never, changes in coding practices docu-\nmentedduringthisperioddonotappear\nsufficient to account for the very large\ndecline in rates of hospitalizations for\nTBIs classified as mild.\nTheaccuracyofourestimateoftrends\nin the TBI severity distribution also de-\npends on the accurate classification of\nthese injuries by ICDMAP-90 soft-\nware. Misclassification of these data\nwould affect our estimated relative pro-\nportions of TBI by level of severity more\nthan the trends for each level of sever-\nity, because this classification algo-\nrithm is applied consistently to the data\nacross all years examined.\nCONCLUSION\nDespite a substantial overall reduc-\ntion of TBI-related hospitalization rates\nues to represent a major public health\nproblem that calls for the application\nof more effective methods of injury pre-\nvention. The shift toward treating per-\nsons with less severe TBI as outpa-\ntients raises additional concerns. The\nproportion of those with mild TBI who\nexperience effects later is unknown, al-\nthough cognitive and emotional se-\nquelae resulting in extended or long-\nterm disability have been reported in\nvide no information about the num-\nber of persons seen in EDs or other out-\npatient facilities with such sequelae who\nmay need follow-up care or evalua-\ntion. Assessing these needs and ensur-\ning the availability of appropriate ser-\nvices is an important function of public\nhealth; additional studies are needed to\naddress these issues.\nREFERENCES\n1.
