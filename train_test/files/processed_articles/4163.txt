    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecently, we proposed that the aftereffects of adapting to facial age are consistent with a\nrenormalization of the perceived age (e.g., so that after adapting to a younger or older age, all\nages appear slightly older or younger, respectively). This conclusion has been challenged by arguing\nthat the aftereffects can also be accounted for by an alternative model based on repulsion (in\nwhich facial ages above or below the adapting age are biased away from the adaptor). However, we\nshow here that this challenge was based on allowing the fitted functions to take on values which\nare implausible and incompatible across the different adapting conditions. When the fits are\nconstrained or interpreted in terms of standard assumptions about normalization and repulsion,\nthen the two analyses both agree in pointing to a pattern of renormalization in age aftereffects.\n",

These alternatives predict very different patterns of aftereffects (Rhodes et al.,\n2005; Webster & MacLeod, 2011). Yet distinguishing between them is difficult, partly because\nthese patterns depend on sampling the aftereffects at multiple levels along a face dimension.\nRecently, we took advantage of the fact that facial age is among the few facial dimensions\nthat observers can readily scale (by assigning a perceived age) and used this to assess how\nadaptation to one age affects the appearance of all others (O'Neil, Mac, Rhodes, & Webster,\n2014). We found that the aftereffects for young and old faces were characterized by\napproximately uniform shifts, while middle-aged faces judged as a norm for age produced\nlittle aftereffect. We concluded from this pattern that adaptation to facial age is consistent\nwith a simple norm-based code. Storrs (2015) challenges this conclusion, arguing that the\naftereffects we reported are equally or better described by a pattern of local repulsion\npredicted by a multichannel model. Here, we show that her analyses were based on\nallowing the curve fits for repulsion to take on unrealistic and inconsistent values for the\nunderlying mechanisms. When the curve fits are constrained by conventional assumptions\nabout the channel models, then normalization provides a better account of the age\naftereffects, supporting our original claims.\nTo understand this debate, consider how the pattern of aftereffects differs for\nnormalization (norm-based coding) and repulsion (multichannel) as commonly construed\nThe differences were illustrated in Figure 1 of O'Neil et al. (2014). For normalization, the\nhallmark characteristics are:\n(a) Aftereffects of similar size and in the same direction for all faces including the adapting\nface, consistent with a shift in the appearance of the adapting face toward the norm.\nThus when adapting to a young face, all faces should look older.\n(b) No aftereffect when adapting to the norm.\n(c) Asymmetries in the aftereffects, such that adapting to an older or younger face alters the\nnorm, while adapting to the norm does not bias the perceived age of old and young faces.\nFor repulsion, the defining pattern is:\n(a) Changes in opposite directions for faces on opposite sides of the adapting level. Faces\nyounger than the adapt age should appear even younger, and faces older than the adapt\nage should appear even older.\n(b) No change in the perceived age of the adapting level itself.\n(c) A similar pattern at all adapting levels, and thus no asymmetries in the aftereffects\nbetween different ages.\nIn our original report, we evaluated these alternatives by comparing regression lines fit to\nthe age estimates before or after adaptation. Normalization predicts approximately constant\nshifts in the judgments, changing the intercept but not the slope of the function, while\nadapting to the norm should produce neither a slope nor intercept change. Moreover,\nnormalization predicts the intercept changes should be in opposite directions for young\nand old adaptors. This is the pattern we tested for and found. The perceptual expansion\nproduced by repulsion instead predicts a steepening of the slope and predicts that intercepts\nwould always be shifted and in the same direction (toward more negative values) for all three\nadapt levels, a pattern we did not find (see Figure 1). The size of these linear shifts obviously\ndepends on the magnitude and bandwidth of the adaptation. Yet the aftereffects for repulsion\nnever predict the pattern we observed of opposite shifts in the intercepts after adaptation to\nyoung versus old faces. From this we again conclude that the observed aftereffects are\nconsistent with the pattern predicted by normalization while inconsistent with the pattern\npredicted by repulsion and that our original analyses based on testing the slopes and\nintercepts were sufficient to distinguish between the alternative models.\nIn her commentary, Storrs raises several critiques of our work. One is that we did not\nevaluate the aftereffects directly (i.e., the changes in the age ratings before and after\nadaptation) but instead focused on the absolute ages under the different conditions.\nHowever, this misrepresents what we did. While our regression fits were based on the\nabsolute perceived ages, the analyses we conducted explicitly assessed whether the slopes\nFigure 1. Blue lines: Intercepts of linear regression lines fit to GD curves with different standard deviations.\nAll GDs were adjusted for a peak aftereffect of\u00c62.4, and spanned an age range from 18 to 89, with zero\ncrossings at the young (Y), Middle (M), or old (O) adapting ages. Black lines: intercept shifts for a uniform\nrenormalization of \u00fe2.4 (Y), 0 (M), or \u00c02.4 (O). Red lines: measured intercepts for the three adapting\nconditions.\nO'Neil et al. 3\nor intercepts of the regression lines changed with adaptation. This is necessarily an\nassessment of the aftereffect (of the change between pre- and postadapt settings) and one\nwhich is equivalent to asking whether the aftereffect itself was constant across age (i.e., a\nchange in the intercept without a change in slope, the basic effect we found).\nA second critique was that our analysis did not provide a fair test of a repulsion model. To\npursue this, Storrs instead compared how well the aftereffects were fit by a linear function\nversus a Gaussian derivative (GD). Her choice of the GD was reasonable for simulating\nrepulsion but allowing the function to take on any values is not. In particular, Storrs\nseparately fit each adapting condition with a function that was free to vary in its\namplitude, bandwidth, and zero-crossing. To see why this is a problem, consider first the\nfits she obtained to the young adapting age (Figure 2(a), green dashed line). Here, observers\nwere adapted to faces in their 30's, but the best fit occurs when the repulsion is centered not\non the adapt age, but instead crosses zero at an `age' of negative 5 years (4 decades from the\nadapt level), and also has a very broad standard deviation (48 years). What should we\nconclude from this? First, we argue that Storrs' analysis is not testing a viable model of\nadaptation. If it were, then the conclusion would be that when adapting to the age of\nyoung adults, the sensitivity losses were largest in channels tuned to an impossibly younger\nage--to how old we looked before our parents met. Her analysis is instead an exercise in\ncurve fitting, in which the parameter values are not constrained to have a mechanistic\ninterpretation. Second, Storrs' argument is that this curve provides as good an estimate of\nthe aftereffects as a linear fit. However, this is not because very different functions fit the data\nas well, but because the two fitted functions she estimated are in fact very similar over the\nfinite span of adult ages (18\u00ad89) at which the aftereffects were actually measured. As\nFigure 2(a) shows, a GD function with very broad tuning and a very remote zero-crossing\napproximates a linear change over the range of interest. In this regard it is not surprising that\nan arbitrary GD can fit the data at least as well, because it includes an approximation to\nlocally linear effects as a possible solution. In fact this is the reason her repulsion fit predicts\nthe positive intercept change we reported for the young adapt condition--because over the\nrange of physically possible ages the repulsion is all in the same direction. Finally, the fact\nthat this roughly linear effect best describes the aftereffects also for the GD curve shows that\nStorrs' own analysis yields the essential pattern of aftereffects predicted by normalization.\nSpecifically, both the GD and linear curve fits predict that adapting to faces in their 30's\nbiases all adult ages--including the adapting age--to appear older.\nA similar problem occurs for the older adapting age (Figure 2(c)). Here again the best-\nfitting GD function does not have a zero crossing at the adapt level (65), but is shifted now to\nolder ages (79; a difference as large as the age differences between our adapting conditions),\nand the function again predicts aftereffects broadly similar to the pattern predicted by\nnormalization (i.e., after adapting to older faces, almost all faces--including the adapt\nfaces--appear younger). In this case, the tuning is narrower (SD \u00bc 27) and the fits are not\nas well captured by a constant change at all ages, a point noted in our original paper. Yet\nthe still very broad and consistent direction of the predicted aftereffects is again closer to the\nhallmark pattern of normalization than repulsion.\nThe middle-age adapt condition reveals a further flaw in Storrs' analysis, which arises\nbecause she fit each of the three adapting conditions independently (Figure 2(b)). Here again\nthe zero-crossing for the best-fitting GD curve is displaced from the expected null at the\nadapting level (47 vs. 57). Yet more importantly, in this case, the bandwidth of the function is\nnow much narrower (6.5). This leads to fits for the GD functions which are internally\ninconsistent as a model of the aftereffects. While the bandwidths of channels could\nplausibly vary at different stimulus levels, they cannot simultaneously be so broad\nthat young and old adapt ages induce strong aftereffects in middle-ages (and each other), yet\nso narrow that middle-age adaptation does not induce complementary repulsion on the\nyoung and old ages. However, as curve fits, this asymmetry between the aftereffects for\nmiddle ages versus young and old ages once more follows the pattern of aftereffects\nexpected by normalization. As her fitted GD functions predict, adapting to the young or\nold faces biased middle-ages, while adapting to this norm did not produce corresponding\nbiases in the appearance of the young or old ages. Thus while Storrs argues that her analysis\ncontradicts our conclusions, simple inspection of the fitted functions shows that she has\ninstead confirmed that the aftereffects for all three adapt conditions follow the standard\npattern predicted for normalization, and not for repulsion.\nFigure 2.

Vertical green lines\nshow the age at the zero-crossings for the independent GD curve fits (Storrs null). Blue dotted line: best\nfitting standard repulsion model. Red solid line: best fitting standard normalization model.\nO'Neil et al. 5\nWhat if we instead compare viable models of normalization versus repulsion, by\nconstraining the fitted functions to embody the characteristics that define conventional\nimplementations of these models? For repulsion, we used the GD function but forced the\nnull to coincide with the adapting level to reflect the hallmark of typical repulsion\naftereffects. Further, we required the strength and spread of the adaptation to be the same\nat each adapting level, to preclude the implausibly large asymmetries in Storrs' independent\ncurve fits. This left two free parameters controlling the magnitude and bandwidth of the GD\nfunction. For normalization, we assumed a very simple model in which there is no adaptation\nto the norm, while adapting to younger or older ages produces a constant bias at all test ages.\nConsistent with evidence from distortion aftereffects (Susilo, McKone, & Edwards, 2010), we\nfurther required that the strength of the aftereffect increase in proportion to how far the adapt\nage was from the norm. This leaves only a single free parameter controlling the magnitude of\nthe aftereffect. Fits from the two models are plotted in Figure 2 as the red (normalization) and\nblue (repulsion) curves. Despite fewer degrees of freedom, the model of normalization provides\nsignificantly better fits to the aftereffects than the model of repulsion (RMS error \u00bc 2.66 for\nnormalization and 2.90 for repulsion, vs. 3.08 for no model). This was assessed with a\nWilcoxon-signed rank test of the relative errors for the two models, which makes minimal\nassumptions and does not penalize the repulsion model for having more free parameters (across\nall three adapt conditions combined: z \u00bc 3.06, p \u00bc .002). The normalization model also\noutperformed the repulsion model for both the younger (RMS error \u00bc 2.14 for\np \u00bc .033) adapt conditions, while the two models did not differ from each other for the middle-\nwhich normalization equals the prediction for no aftereffects. Thus, this analysis again confirms\nthat the aftereffects are better described by normalization than repulsion, at least when based\non standard and viable forms of these aftereffects.\nThe adaptation effects we measured were weak and it remains possible that elaborations of\neither model might better describe the actual pattern of age aftereffects (e.g., Elliott,\nGeorgeson, & Webster, 2011). In fact, the normalization and repulsion models differ only\nquantitatively and seamlessly in properties such as the number and bandwidth of the\nmechanisms (Webster & MacLeod, 2011). However, the point we emphasize is that any\nmodel comparisons should be based on realizable neural models, and not on curve fits in\nwhich the parameters are allowed to take on implausible or impossible values for the\nunderlying adapted mechanisms. When the aftereffects are fit or interpreted in this way,\nthen both our analyses and Storrs' own are better captured by normalization.\n"
