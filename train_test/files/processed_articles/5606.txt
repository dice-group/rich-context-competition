In line with findings\nsuggesting positive effects in the treatment of mental health problems, such research highlights the potential of psyche-\ndelic drugs for the enhancement of wellbeing even in healthy individuals.

Elsey\n Keywords\nPsychedelics, ayahuasca, psilocybin, DMT, LSD, drug policy, drug use, healthy participants\nResearchers and clinicians are becoming increasingly\nopen to the possibility that psychedelic drugs might\nprove useful in the treatment of mental health prob-\nlems. Studies conducted primarily in the 1950s and\n1960s furnished a wealth of (methodologically imper-\nfect) clinical findings to suggest beneficial effects of\npsychedelic drugs in the treatment of mood, anxiety,\nand addictive disorders (Grinspoon and Bakalar,\ndrug laws that effectively foreclosed research into\npsychedelic drugs in the 1960s, their possible benefits\nhave been widely overlooked (Nutt et al., 2013).\nMore recent studies have begun to corroborate the\nsuggestion that treatments involving psychedelic\ndrugs may be effective in the alleviation of a range\nof mental health problems (see Vollenweider and\nKometer, 2010 for a review). In light of such findings,\nseveral authors have argued for changes in drug policy\nin order to facilitate basic research and treatment\ninnovation regarding psychedelics (Gross, 2013; Nutt\nHowever, relatively little thrust has been given to the\nargument that even healthy individuals can experience\nconsiderable benefits from consuming psychedelics, and\nthat they may have a right to experience these (Walsh,\n2016). Bioethical discussion of the use of drugs in the\nhealthy population to improve wellbeing has typically\nfocused on the use of pharmaceuticals such as selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other anti-\ndepressants as a means of improving mood (Kramer,\neffects or due to inadequate research designs, evidence\nfor strong mood enhancing effects of such substances in\nhealthy individuals is scarce (Ilieva, 2015; Repantis\net al., 2009). Without evidence for clear effects, and\nwith the necessity for relatively long-term, daily usage\nbefore any such effects are likely to be apparent\n(Harmer, 2008), coupled with the possibility of unpleas-\nant side effects further deterring usage, it seems unlikely\nRoeterseilandcampus \u00ad gebouw G, the Netherlands\nCorresponding author:\nJames W.B.

In contrast, over 30 million\npeople in the United States are estimated to have experi-\nmented with psychedelic drugs (Krebs and Johansen,\n2013a), and with new research garnering considerable\nattention and suggesting positive effects, it seems pos-\nsible that more individuals may seek out psychedelic\nexperiences. Use of psychedelic drugs in this way may\nprompt not only bioethical, but legal discussions. It is\nessential that such discussions proceed in a way that\ntakes current scientific research into account.\nThe purpose of this review is to provide an up to\ndate overview of current knowledge regarding psyche-\ndelic drug effects in healthy individuals, with the hope\nof grounding future discussion of psychedelics in the\nexisting evidence base. I first describe the psychedelic\nstate and present research on its neurobiological under-\npinnings. I then review contemporary research on the\neffects of psychedelic drugs in healthy individuals. This\nis followed by consideration of possible adverse effects.\nFinally, I consider some implications of such research\nfor drug policy.\nPsychedelic drugs and the\npsychedelic state\nPsychedelics are a type of drug capable of reliably\nbringing about states of altered perception, thought,\nand feeling that are not usually experienced, besides\nin dreams or during religious exaltation (Jaffe, 1990),\nand have been used for their mind-altering properties\nfor thousands of years (Bruhn et al., 2002; Schultes and\ninclude dimethyltryptamine (DMT--found in aya-\nhuasca), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline\n(found in peyote), and psilocybin (found in ``magic\nmushrooms''). Psychedelic researchers have delineated\nthree broad stages of psychedelic drug effects (Majic\n\u00b4\nFirstly, shortly after drug administration, a short-\nterm (lasting from minutes to hours) acute psychedelic\nstate is induced. This phase is characterized by a sig-\nnificant alteration of conscious experience, and in some\ncases may result in a `complete mystical experience',\nalso known as a psychedelic peak experience (Majic\n\u00b4\net al., 2015). Complete mystical experiences include a\nsense of unity (e.g. merging with the universe, the sense\nthat all things are one), ineffability (being unable to\nfully describe the experience in words), a deep positive\nmood, a sense of sacredness or awe, transcendence of\ntime and space, and a noetic quality (a feeling of reve-\nlation or intuitive understanding) (Pahnke, 1969).\nSecondly, it has been reported that following the\nacute drug phase, a `psychedelic afterglow' state may\nbe produced, in which the recipient of the drug may\nhave an elevated mood and feel less burdened by previ-\nous worries (Pahnke, 1969). This phase typically sub-\nsides after approximately 2\u00ad4 weeks (Majic\nPahnke, 1969). Finally, as discussed in more detail\nbelow, over the long term there may be lasting psycho-\nlogical changes precipitated either by general drug effects\nor the subjective psychedelic/mystical experience itself.\nNeurobiology of psychedelic drugs\nNeuroscience research has recently begun to investigate\nthe acute effects of psychedelic drugs on the human\nbrain. Brain imaging has been performed on partici-\npants in the acute drug state for LSD (e.g. Carhart-\n(e.g. Carhart-Harris et al., 2012), and ayahuasca/DMT\n(e.g. Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015), enabling researchers\nto piece together a possible model for the effects of\nthese substances.\nStudies of the psychedelic state typically show\nchanges in the connectivity and activity of brain regions\nconstituting the ``default mode network'' (DMN), par-\nticularly regions that are usually highly active, such as\nthe posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial pre-\nfrontal cortex (mPFC) (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014;\nRaichle et al., 2001). The DMN is a network of brain\nregions that is typically engaged when the mind wanders,\nand is often thought to support metacognitive processes\nsuch as self-reflection, thinking about others, and think-\ning about one's past and future (Carhart-Harris et al.,\nAlthough the connectivity of brain regions compris-\ning the DMN appears integral to sustaining normal\nwaking consciousness, it has also been pointed out\nthat this may come at the price of restricting other pos-\nsible brain states and thus limiting conscious experience\n(Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). Indeed, while the integrity\nof communication between brain regions within\nthis network appears to be decreased by psychedelic\ndrugs, there are also increases in connectivity between\nwhat are usually more independently functioning brain\nnetworks, and these connectivity changes are correlated\nwith the altered state of consciousness under the influ-\nence of psychedelics (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Hence,\nit seems that in the acute drug phase, psychedelics\ndisrupt normal or even entrenched patterns of brain\nactivity that characterize waking experience, enabling\na greater range of activity patterns to surface\n(Tagliazucchi et al., 2014). This may explain the unu-\nsual insights and perspectives that frequently become\navailable under the influence of psychedelics. In sup-\nport of this possibility, Lebedev et al. (2016) found\nthat reduced organization of brain activity during the\nacute drug phase predicted later increases in the\n2 Drug Science, Policy and Law\npersonality dimension of openness, a dimension that\nincludes facets such as intellectual curiosity and creativ-\nity. Higher magnetoencephalography signal diversity in\nspontaneous brain activity was also observed in partici-\npants experiencing altered states of consciousness after\ntaking LSD, psilocybin, or ketamine, and preliminary\nevidence was found suggesting that these signal diver-\nsity measures were related to the intensity of the psy-\nchedelic state (Schartner et al., 2017).\nBrain regions that appear most affected by the admin-\nistration of psychedelics in humans overlap with sites\nthat have a high density of serotonin 2 A (5-HT2A\n) recep-\ntors (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Tagliazucchi et al.,\n2016), corroborating animal and human research indi-\ncating that psychedelic drugs act primarily through\nagonistic activity at 5-HT2A\nreceptors (Glennon et al.,\n2010 for reviews). Recent research in humans provided\nconcrete evidence for the role of 5-HT2A\nreceptors in the\naltered state of consciousness brought about by psyche-\ndelics: ketanserin--a 5-HT2A\nreceptor antagonist--com-\npletely blocked the subjective effects of LSD\nSuch agonistic effects may underpin not only the acute\ndrug state, but also longer-term changes as a result of\npsychedelic usage. For example, it has been found (in\nrodents) that repeated administration of LSD lead to\nthe reduced expression of 5-HT2A\nreceptors, particularly\nin prefrontal cortical areas (Buckholtz et al., 1990). These\nreceptors are overexpressed in the brains of humans with\ndepression (Meyer et al., 2003), are linked to stress resili-\nence in healthy individuals (Frokjaer et al., 2008), and are\nalso targets of antidepressant drugs (Yamauchi et al.,\nreceptor sites, particu-\nlarly in prefrontal cortical regions involved in the\nregulation of emotion, could be partly responsible for\nlong-term outcomes as a result of psychedelic use.\nEffects of psychedelic drugs in\nhealthy individuals\nThough the neurobiological effects of psychedelic drugs\nare only recently being elucidated, interest in the psy-\nchological impact of psychedelic states has been of\ninterest to psychologists for several decades. Early\nand contemporary researchers of psychedelics empha-\nsized the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs in a\nrange of disorders, ranging from depression and anx-\niety disorders to alcoholism and other addictions\nSessa, 2005). However, these drugs also induce pro-\nfound mystical or spiritual experiences in healthy indi-\nviduals, with potentially transformative effects. In this\nsection, research on the impact of psychedelic drugs on\nhealthy individuals will be considered.\nIn a classic study known as ``The Good Friday\nexperiment'', Pahnke (1963) administered psilocybin\nor nicotinic acid (an active placebo) to 20 students at\na theological seminary in order to assess whether the\ndrug might facilitate mystical experiences. Participants\nthen attended the local Good Friday Mass. The major-\nity of participants in this study found the experience\nvery profound. A follow-up conducted between\n24 and 27 years after the original study revealed that\nmost of those who received psilocybin felt a continued\nbenefit from their participation, with a deepened appre-\nciation of life and nature, as well as enhanced joy and\nappreciation for unusual experiences and emotions\n(Doblin, 1991). Likewise, in a study of LSD assisted\npsychotherapy, Savage et al. (1966) reported data on\na subset of psychiatrically healthy individuals who had\ncomplained of a lack of purpose or meaning in their\nlives. Following a supervised intake of LSD, the\nparticipants scored higher on self-report measures of\nself-actualization and creativity. As a whole, the par-\nticipants in this study reported feeling a greater sense of\nmeaning and purpose in their lives, oneness with\nhumanity, and decreased valuation of superficial pur-\nsuits such as material gains and social status. They also\nreported an increase in confidence and assertiveness,\nwith many of these changes still apparent months later.\nMore recent studies have largely corroborated these\nfindings. For example, Griffiths et al. (2006) gave\nhealthy volunteers a dose of psilocybin and supervised\nthem during an 8-hour period in a comfortable envir-\nonment. The majority of participants were found to\nhave a ``complete mystical experience'', including a\nsense of unity, transcendence of time and space, and\npositive mood. Strikingly, even at a 14-month follow-\nup, 58% of participants said the experience was among\nthe five most personally significant in their lives, 67%\nsaid that it was one of the most spiritually meaningful\nin their lives, and 64% noted an increased sense of\nwellbeing and life satisfaction (Griffiths et al., 2008).\nSimilarly, MacLean et al. (2011) determined a likely\neffective dose of psilocybin for reliably producing a\nmystical experience in an independent sample of\nhealthy participants. These participants likewise\nreported increases in wellbeing and satisfaction, as\nwell as moderate positive changes regarding behaviors\nin relationships and caring for themselves.\nLiechti, 2017, for a review of clinical research on LSD)\nassessed the acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects,\nand similarly found significant increases in relevant psy-\nchological states, such as a sense of oneness, disembodi-\nment, and an increased sense of personal wellbeing and\ntrust. Psychedelic and mystical experiences were more\nused. Schmid et al. (2015) supplemented their\nassessment of subjective effects with a range of auto-\nnomic (e.g. heart rate) and endocrine (e.g. plasma cor-\ntisol and oxytocin) measurements. Such additional\nphysiological measures may prove informative if used\nmore widely, potentially helping map how neural\nchanges translate to physiological effects and subjective\nexperiences (though it may be noted that excessive\nor intrusive measurement may negatively affect the\n``setting'', perhaps reducing positive outcomes under\nthe influence of psychedelics).\nTaking LSD in combination with listening to music\nmay lead to particularly emotive experiences. It has\nlong been argued that both the set (characteristics of\nthe person taking the drug) and setting (characteristics\nof the environment) are strong determinants of the\nquality of a psychedelic experience (Pahnke, 1969).\nProviding an appropriate environment in which to\ncatalyze positive and meaningful experiences can opti-\nmize the beneficial effects of psychedelics. Music may\nbe one such environmental factor, and has been used\nconsistently in psychedelic psychotherapy and in ritual\ncontexts over the long history of human psychedelic\nstudy, Kaelen et al. (2015) found that feelings such as\nwonder, transcendence, power, and tenderness in\nresponse to music were increased under the influence\nof LSD, relative to placebo. The authors suggest\nthat, given the relation of these emotions to crucial\ncomponents of the psychedelic peak experience, the\nappropriate use of music may increase the likelihood\nof participants reaching this state of consciousness.\nSuch results indicate that the environment can be care-\nfully tailored so as to maximize the chances of achiev-\ning new and positive breakthroughs.\nConsistent with the description of psychedelics as\nenabling new insights, it has also been suggested that\ntheir use may facilitate creative pursuits (Sessa, 2008).\nBoth artists and scientists have reported inspiration or\ninsights as a result of psychedelic experiences (Narby,\nthat drawings produced by visual artists after LSD ses-\nsions showed changes in some features, which were\nthought to reflect a greater freedom of expression.\nHarman and colleagues gave mescaline to 27 male par-\nticipants with jobs that typically required creative prob-\nlem solving, and assessed its impact on their creativity\n(Harman et al., 1966). This study was of particular\ninterest because participants were not only assessed\non a range of psychometric tests, but also worked on\na real life issue they had been trying to solve. Many\nparticipants in this study came up with genuine solu-\ntions to their problems under the influence of mesca-\nline, and reported an enduring impact on their creative\nprocess several weeks later. However, it is unclear the\nextent to which suggestion might also have contributed\ntowards such creativity, or to subjective reports of it:\nparticipants were specifically prepped to anticipate\nimprovements in their creative output, and it is\nknown that psychedelics can increase suggestibility\n(Carhart-Harris et al., 2014a). In a more recent study,\nparticipants were assessed before and two weeks after\nengaging in several ayahuasca sessions in a ritual set-\nting (Frecska et al., 2012). Relative to a control group,\nparticipants who took ayahuasca displayed increased\noriginality in a standardized test of creative thinking.\nHence, both experimental studies and anecdotal reports\nindicate that psychedelics may enhance the creative\nprocess. Further controlled studies are certainly\nwarranted.\nFurther studies using experimental tasks 2\u00ad3 hours\nafter the peak effects of LSD administration have\npassed, but when participants are still under the influ-\nence of the drug, have shown that social and emotional\nprocesses are affected by psychedelics (Dolder et al.,\nat recognizing fearful faces and showed a trend towards\nbeing less able to recognize sad faces, but had no\nchanges in relation to angry or happy faces (Dolder\net al., 2016). Relative to neutral faces, when viewing\nfearful faces, participants on LSD displayed reduced\nactivation of the right medial frontal gyrus, as well as\nthe left amygdala (Mueller et al., 2017), a brain region\ncrucial for the detection of biologically relevant stimuli\n(Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010). Participants on LSD\nwere also found to display greater feeling for and arou-\nsal over people pictured in emotionally provocative\nscenes (`emotional empathy'), though they were\nimpaired at actually inferring the mental state of the\npeople seen in the pictures (`theory of mind' or `cogni-\ntive empathy'). Finally, these participants made more\nprosocial choices in a set of resource allocation tasks,\nand reported feeling greater trust, closeness, and a\ndesire to be with others. Hence, important socioemo-\ntional stimuli may be processed and responded to dif-\nferently when under the influence of psychedelics.\nIt can be seen that the effects of psychedelic drugs\ncould go beyond the relatively small and inconsistent\neffects of pharmaceuticals such as SSRIs in healthy sub-\njects, in that they not only produce improvements in\nmood, but may also give access to states of conscious-\nness and insights of great significance, even after a\nsingle dose. In so doing, psychedelic drugs may cater\nto a major human need for meaning, connectedness,\nand purpose; needs which it may be argued are widely\noverlooked in Western, individualistic cultures. Several\nprominent psychologists have emphasized that these\nfactors are central to human flourishing. For example,\nMaslow (1969) proposed that the peak of human\nactualization might be the recognition of a higher\ngoal or purpose outside of oneself. Similarly, Frankl\n4 Drug Science, Policy and Law\npose as a fundamental human drive. The capacity of the\npsychedelic experience to help resolve such existential\nconcerns is a plausible contributor to the positive effects\nof psilocybin on mood and anxiety in patients with\nIn addition, the ability of psychedelic drugs to facili-\ntate the creative process may further promote\nself-expression, and pave the way to solutions to both\nprofessional and personal challenges. In summary, cur-\nrent empirical findings indicate that psychedelics have\nthe potential to significantly improve wellbeing among\notherwise healthy individuals, and may also help foster\nnovel perspectives, supporting the resolution of profes-\nsional and personal challenges.\nPossible adverse effects\nWith any intervention, one should always consider the\nassociated risks. This may be especially important\nwhere drugs are taken for the purpose of `self improve-\nment' or `enhancement' rather than treatment: where\nclear cut cases of treatment are concerned, a person\nmay have exhausted all other avenues, and even sizable\nrisks could be tolerated if it meant that they might be\nunburdened of severe pathology. People may have\nlower tolerance for risk when pursuing an intervention\nfor non-therapeutic purposes. With regards to psyche-\ndelics, Griffiths et al. (2008) summarize possible risks\nthat have been raised by other commentators, namely:\n(1) acute panic, leading to dangerous behavior under\nthe influence of the drug, (2) the manifestation or\nexacerbation of psychiatric conditions, (3) enduring\nperceptual disturbances, and (4) the development of\nan abusive pattern of drug use. Each of these issues is\ndiscussed below.\nRegarding the induction of panic and the exacerba-\ntion of psychiatric issues, it is notable, even paradoxical\n(Carhart-Harris et al., 2016), that the same psychedelic\ndrugs that are being considered for the purposes of\ntherapy and enhancement are also being utilized for\ntheir propensity to model psychotic episodes. Acute\neffects of psychedelic drugs can be aversive, with para-\nnoia and the fear of going insane noted by some\nwho take them (Hofmann and Ott, 2013). A sizable\nminority of participants in Griffiths and colleagues'\nLSD studies noted feelings of panic while on the\ndrug, though these feelings typically dissipated over\nthe session, and had no lasting impact. In reviewing\ncontrolled studies of ayahuasca, dos Santos et al.\n(2016) also noted that participants can experience\nunpleasant states in the acute phase after drug intake,\nbut emphasize that in no such studies were any lasting\npsychotic or otherwise highly negative outcomes\nobserved. Other researchers likewise noted transient\nincreases in anxiety in participants under the influence\nof LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016; Schmid et al.,\n2015). However, these participants experienced signifi-\ncantly greater increases in feeling a blissful state. In the\naforementioned studies, negative emotions were argu-\nably balanced or even outweighed by feelings of awe\nand other positive emotions, as well as longer-term\nimprovements in wellbeing. These findings are in line\nwith a pooled analysis of 110 healthy experimental par-\nticipants who had received psilocybin (Studerus et al.,\n2011): strong feelings of dysphoria or panic were only\nobserved when the highest doses were given in a small\nnumber of participants, and the psychedelic experience\nwas mostly deemed to have been pleasurable and\nenriching.\nCarhart-Harris et al. (2016) have suggested that\nsome of the potentially aversive aspects of the psyche-\ndelic experience, such as thought disorganization and\nego dissolution, may directly relate to later positive\nchanges. For example, they observed a positive trend\nlevel association between thought disorganization in\nthe acute drug state and later increases in openness.\nSuch unusual states of consciousness could be the sub-\njective reflection of the disordered patterns of brain\nactivity described earlier, which are similarly predictive\nof later personality changes (Lebedev et al., 2016).\nWhatever the case, controlled studies have not found\nevidence for dangerous behavior under the influence of\npsychedelics, or of psychological damage.\nWhile it appears that claims of common and severe\nnegative effects of psychedelic drugs have been exagger-\nated (Strassman, 1984), some reports of negative effects\nshould not be dismissed. Two subjects in Pahnke's ori-\nginal `Good Friday' experiment found the experience to\nbe extremely unpleasant, with one even needing to\nreceive a tranquilizer (Doblin, 1991). It is possible\nthat being surrounded by several other psychedelic\nnai\u00a8ve users, as well as inadequate preparation, could\nhave contributed to this negative outcome. Careful con-\ntrol over the setting in which the drug is taken can\nminimize such occurrences.\nIn case studies reporting adverse reactions to psyche-\ndelic drugs, it is often difficult to disentangle the dir-\nect effects of psychedelics from other drugs, or the\ninfluence of premorbid risk factors that should not\nnecessarily deter psychologically healthy individuals.\nFor example, dos Santos and Strassman (2011) describe\na young man who experienced psychotic episodes on\ntwo separate occasions after having taken ayahuasca,\none of which included causing superficial harm to him-\nself. This man had no personal or family history of\npsychoticism. Yet, he had also been a daily user of can-\nnabis for six years and often took cannabis in combin-\nation with ayahuasca. In addition, he had already been\ntaking ayahuasca on a regular basis for two years\nwithout adverse effects. Boulos et al. (2015) report a\ncase of a 15-year-old male who made a near lethal sui-\ncide attempt shortly after having taken a synthetic psy-\nchedelic. Though he reported no prior suicidal ideation,\nthis individual had a family history of schizophrenia and\nreported alcohol abuse and regular cannabis intake. In\ncases such as these, it can be difficult to disentangle clear\npsychedelic effects from drug interactions, interactions\nwith predisposing factors, or even chance events. While\nsuch instances should not be ignored, weight should be\ngiven to controlled or at least larger scale studies of\nadverse effects, from which firmer conclusions can be\ndrawn than from individual cases.\nAs reported in dos Santos et al.'s (2016) systematic\nreview of ayahuasca research, beyond a few exceptional\ncase studies, there is little evidence for serious adverse\neffects in relation to the use of ayahuasca, at least in\nritual contexts. Gable (2007) reports psychotic incidents\nin relation to ayahuasca use of between approximately\n0.05\u00ad0.1% over a five-year period (corresponding to an\nestimated 25,000 ayahuasca sessions) in the Unia~o do\nVegetal (UDV) religious group. Lima and To\n\u00b4 foli\n(2011) also used data from a UDV context, and reported\ntime period corresponding to an estimated 1.56 million\nayahuasca doses), of which just 19 actually appeared to\nhave ayahuasca as a clear precipitating factor. Many of\nthese cases were suggested to have premorbid character-\nistics linked with psychoticism. Regarding psychedelic\nuse more generally, it is calculated that, in 2010, there\nwere 32 million individuals in the US who had used a\npsychedelic substance at least once (Krebs and\nJohansen, 2013a). Consistent with the low risk of\nmental health problems associated with ayahuasca,\nindependent population studies in the United States\nhave found no evidence for a link between psychedelic\nuse and mental health problems or suicidality (Johansen\none recent population study found that, when independ-\nent risk factors were controlled, use of psychedelics was\nactually associated with lower psychological distress\nand suicidality (Hendricks et al., 2015).\nIn addition to a lack of negative acute or enduring\nmental health effects, no evidence has been found to\nsupport the idea that the use of psychedelics leads to\nany kind of enduring perceptual disturbances, known\nas `hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder' (HPPD)\n(Krebs and Johansen, 2013b). Despite the high level\nof vivid mental imagery brought about under the influ-\nence of psilocybin, Studerus et al. (2011) found no evi-\ndence for enduring visual hallucinations or flashbacks\nin their pooled analysis of experimental psilocybin\nrecipients. Large-scale population studies have also\nfailed to provide any evidence of HPPD in relation to\npsychedelic use (Johansen and Krebs, 2015; Krebs and\nJohansen, 2013b). This is true even in ritual users, who\ntypically have much greater exposure than participants\nin experimental studies (dos Santos et al., 2016;\nEven if a drug had no direct negative physical or\nmental health effects, dependence and compulsive use\ncould lead to a range of problems, such as financial\ndifficulties, legal trouble, or simply opportunity cost\nin pursuing the drug. However, the current scientific\nconsensus is that classic psychedelic drugs do not\nhave addictive properties (Bonson, 2012; Nutt et al.,\n2007). In fact, psychedelic drugs are being investigated\nas a potential means of treating addiction (Halpern,\ndisorganizing effects on the brain and cognition might\nhelp dismantle the well-worn neural pathways support-\ning drug dependence, just as they facilitate moves away\nfrom entrenched patterns of thought and behavior.\nLong-term, frequent use of psychedelics might be\nlinked to brain and personality changes. For example,\nBouso et al. (2015) found that members of the Santo\nDaime church in Spain, who use the psychedelic aya-\nhuasca on a roughly fortnightly basis as part of reli-\ngious rituals, displayed lower cortical thickness in the\nPCC (the area identified as a major hub in the DMN\nthat is affected by psychedelic drugs) relative to\nmatched controls, and this cortical thickness was asso-\nciated with levels of spirituality. These brain differences\nare not necessarily negative, however. The ayahuasca\nusers in Bouso et al. (2015) actually outperformed non-\nusers on a range of neuropsychological tests, possibly\nsuggesting cognitive- as well as affective-enhancing cap-\nabilities of such drugs. However, as a cross-sectional\nstudy, it remains to be seen whether the observed dif-\nferences between subjects reflect a predisposing factor\nto, or a consequence of, psychedelic use.\nIn summary, scientific research suggests that, when\nadministered at appropriate doses under supervised\nconditions, psychedelic drugs have a very good safety\nprofile. An overall positive experience and long-term\nbeneficial effects typically balance acute aversive reac-\ntions. Evidence does not support a link between psy-\nchedelic use and mental health problems, and may even\nindicate protective effects. Moreover, use of psychedelic\ndrugs does not lead to drug dependency. Risk factors\nfor negative effects should certainly be investigated, and\nit is recognized that those with some premorbid char-\nacteristics, such as psychotic or manic/bipolar disorders\nmight be particularly at risk (dos Santos et al., 2016). It\nshould also be stressed that psychedelic drugs can be\ndangerous if used at improper dosages, in combination\nwith other drugs, or in an unsafe environment, and that\nthe purity of illicitly acquired drugs is rarely certain and\ncould cause other complications. Yet, given the lack of\nevidence for dangers posed by psychedelics, Johansen\n6 Drug Science, Policy and Law\nand Krebs (2015) summarize their view by stating that\nthe prohibition of psychedelic drugs seems partly the\nresult of ``media sensationalization, lack of informa-\ntion, and cultural biases'' (p. 8), and that prohibition\nis difficult justify as a public health measure.\nDrug policy and psychedelic use in the\nhealthy population\nIn several cases in different countries, exemptions have\nbeen made for the use of psychedelics as part of reli-\ngious practices. While precise exemptions differ by\nstate, use of peyote by the Native American Church is\nlegal in the United States. Other uses of psychedelics\nhave become more of a global issue for lawmakers.\nReligious groups such as the Santo Daime and Unia\n~ o\nde Vegetal, which frequently incorporate ayahuasca\ninto their spiritual practices, have expanded outside of\ntheir native country of Brazil, prompting assessments\nof the rights of individuals to use psychedelic drugs in\nreligious contexts even in countries where there is no\nlongstanding tradition of use (Labate and Feeney,\n2012). When considering the use of ayahuasca in reli-\ngious ceremonies, the United States Supreme Court has\nruled that drug laws may be trumped by freedom to\npractice religion, in accordance with the Religious\nThe Netherlands has also granted the right to use aya-\nhuasca in religious and spiritual ceremonies to the\nSanto Daime, owing to insufficient evidence that the\nbrew causes any harm (Adelaars, 2001). However,\nother countries have not always granted freedom of\nuse. The fact that ayahuasca contains DMT was\nenough to suggest a public health risk that was\ndeemed to outweigh religious freedom in Germany\nExemptions for religious purposes raise questions\nregarding appropriate definitions of religion, and\nthere have been concerns over whether religious preten-\nsions might merely be used to cloak the otherwise illegal\nconsumption of psychedelic substances (Sandberg,\n2011). More libertarian commentators, however, have\nargued that such considerations may be beside the\npoint. Religious and therapeutic exemptions are seen\nto perpetuate the notion that the state has a right to\ndetermine appropriate uses of substances even when no\nevidence can be furnished that their use impinges on the\nrights or wellbeing of individuals in wider society\npursuing specific exemptions for psychedelic drugs in\nreligious and therapeutic contexts, a broader exemption\ncan be made for the use of psychedelics on the grounds\nof cognitive liberty. Prohibitions on psychedelic drugs\nmay be seen to amount to prohibitions on the right to\ncontrol one's own mind and conscious experience,\nprecluding access to volitionally chosen but otherwise\nGiven that considerations of religious legitimacy typic-\nally make distinctions between `merely' philosophical\nperspectives and religious views, even securing the\nright to consume psychedelics in religious practices\nmeans that the potentially life enhancing experiences\nand insights that might be gained through their use is\nessentially off limits (without risk of legal repercus-\nsions) to those who do not hold mystical beliefs.\nConvention on Human Rights enshrines not only the\nright to religious freedom, but also freedom of thought.\nIf freedom of thought is to mean anything, it is argued,\nit must surely incorporate freedom to direct one's own\nmental states to the extent that this is possible (Boire,\nThe use of psychedelic drugs only for the purpose of\ntreatment has also been a subject of debate. The dis-\ntinction between treatment and enhancement, or\nbetween therapeutic and recreational uses, is not imme-\ndiately clear. Making a binary distinction between\ntreatment, which would be argued to be the remedi-\nation of some specific pathology, and enhancement--\nthe improvement of a function or capacity deemed\nnormal--begs several questions. Firstly, a clear defin-\nition of pathology would be needed to justify an inter-\nvention. This is particularly troublesome where mental\nhealth is concerned, because pathology is most fre-\nquently inferred based on the presence of symptoms\nthat are not specific to any one disorder, which are\npresent to varying degrees in the general population,\nand for which the underlying causes (i.e. pathology)\nare largely unknown. Secondly, it assumes that normal-\nity is synonymous with good health and wellbeing, and\nthat this is merely the lack of (ill-defined) disease con-\nstructs. To the contrary, many authors argue that con-\nceptions of health and wellbeing ought to encompass\nnot only the absence of clear pathology, but also the\npotential of humans to develop and realize their full\nCurrent research on the use of psychedelics suggests\nthat these drugs may allow otherwise healthy individ-\nuals to improve themselves and increase their wellbeing,\nwith no apparent cost--and possibly benefits--to those\naround them.\nA distinction between the use of psychedelics for\nclear cases of treatment versus enhancement may still\nmake sense in healthcare settings, where service pro-\nviders must make judgments as to the most pressing\ncases, and where public funds may be used to support\ninterventions. It seems reasonable to suggest that treat-\nments for severe mental health problems should be\nprioritized over less pressing desires for improvements\nin wellbeing in healthcare settings. From a legal\nperspective, however, the nebulous boundary between\ntreatment and enhancement, and indeed between reli-\ngious and personal discovery or spiritual uses, raises\nproblems for the clarity of law. For example, is a\nperson who has used a psychedelic to try and gain\ninsight into their non-clinical levels of anxiety con-\nsidered to be self-medicating, or enhancing their self?\nIs this use to be considered wrong purely by virtue of\nbeing outside of a healthcare setting and therefore ille-\ngal? Moreover, the distinction between treatment and\nenhancement does not track any meaningful change in\nthe cost to society that the law is aimed at protecting,\nnor benefits that might be gleaned by the individuals\nthat make up society.\nUnfortunately, some policy developments may be\nproceeding without due consideration of different\ndrugs and their effects. The recent enactment of the\nPsychoactive Substances Act in May 2016 in the UK,\nwhich aims to prohibit psychoactive substances, not\nonly ignores consideration of benefits people might\nderive from a psychoactive substance, but even side-\nsteps the need to demonstrate potential for harm. It is\nnotable that this act seems to have been made to curb\nthe proliferation of `new psychoactive substances'\n(NPSs), also known as `legal highs', whose presence\nin the market is the direct result of bans on existing\npsychoactive substances that are known to pose little\ndanger, notably typical psychedelics LSD and magic\nmushrooms (DMT) (Gross, 2013). If a rational drug\npolicy were pursued regarding existing psychoactive\nsubstances, then there would be less impetus for the\ndevelopment of new ones, the risk profiles and purity\nof which are unknown. Despite evidence indicating that\npsychedelic drugs pose little threat to the individual\nuser or cost to society and may have substantial bene-\nfits, LSD, DMT, and psilocybin remain among the\nmost strictly prohibited substances in the UK, USA,\nOf course, it may be argued that regardless of actual\ndrug laws, psychedelics are relatively easy to procure\nillegally. Nevertheless, risk to those consuming psyche-\ndelics obtained illegally is likely to be higher than where\nuse is legalized. For example, beyond potential legal\nramifications, there are no checks on the purity of illi-\ncitly obtained drugs. Furthermore, `copycat' substances\nare sometimes produced to avoid trouble with the law,\nand the risk profile of these may differ markedly from\nknown psychedelics. Beyond personal use of psyche-\ndelics in healthy subjects, current drug laws stifle the\nuse of psychedelics for research purposes in healthy\nindividuals. Very few research labs currently have per-\nmission to investigate psychedelics, and permissions\ntypically impose standards that are very difficult and\ncostly to meet (Nutt et al., 2013). Research in healthy\nsubjects will prove highly informative in understanding\nthe nature of the psychedelic state and drug mechan-\nisms, which may ultimately help in understanding how\nthese drugs can best be utilized therapeutically.\nSeveral suggestions have been made regarding how\npolicy regarding psychedelics might be made more rea-\nsonable. Nutt et al. (2007) have strongly urged that\ndrug classification should correspond to what empirical\ninvestigation actually shows to be the relative harms of\ndifferent drugs. Classification also tends to consider\npossible benefits of usage for medical purposes. As we\nhave discussed above, there are significant benefits that\nmight be gained from the use of psychedelics outside of\nstrictly medical settings, and these might also be con-\nsidered when rating drugs. Some public health experts\nhave suggested other ways that a more reasonable\nstance towards psychedelics might be taken, based on\nmodels of treatment administration or use in religious\ncontexts. For example, Haden et al. (2016) have sug-\ngested that psychedelics could be administered in con-\ntrolled settings to healthy individuals provided that\ntrained individuals oversee it. Certifications advancing\nin their rigor and the usage of psychedelics that they\nallow (e.g. whether one can offer psychedelic psycho-\ntherapy, or charge for one's services) could be earned\nthat provide supervisors with the knowledge and skills\nto safely administer psychedelic drugs to healthy indi-\nviduals. Production, purity, and sale of the drugs could\nbe monitored and controlled, and tax revenue could be\nincreased, as well as increasing safety of usage by train-\ning in set and setting. Whatever specific course of action\nis taken with regards to drug policy, consideration\nof evidence regarding risks and benefits can only\nimprove policy.\nConclusion\nMany drug researchers have urged the reclassification\nof psychedelic drugs so that their therapeutic potential\ncan be fully realized (Nutt et al., 2013). From current\nresults, it would seem that it is not only those with\npsychological impairments who might stand to gain\nfrom the use of psychedelics. When used appropriately,\npsychedelic drugs have been shown to have positive\neffects among healthy individuals, with single doses\ncapable of producing lasting changes in wellbeing and\npurpose. A rational drug policy derived from empirical\nresearch into the potential costs and benefits of differ-\nent drugs may not only facilitate the treatment of\nmental disorders, but the safe and enriching use of psy-\nchedelic drugs more generally.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\n8 Drug Science, Policy and Law\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAdelaars A (2001) Court case in Holland against the use of\nayahuasca by the Dutch Santo Daime Church.
