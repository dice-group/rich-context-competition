All-terrain vehicles (ATVs)\nhave gained in popularity in recent years, and this rise in\nuse has been accompanied by increases in the number of\nATV-related injuries. Because children often lack the\nphysical strength, cognitive abilities, and fine motor\nskills to operate ATVs properly, their risk for injury is\ngreater. Furthermore, most children ride adult-sized\nObjectives. To estimate the numbers and rates of\nATV-related nonfatal injuries to riders aged <15 years\nwho were treated in hospital emergency departments\nMethods. Estimates of ATV-related injuries were ob-\ntained from the US Consumer Product Safety Commis-\nsion's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-\nAll Injury Program. The database is a nationally\nrepresentative, stratified probability sample of 66 US\nhospitals with >6 beds and a 24-hour ED. ATV-related\nnonfatal injuries to riders aged <15 years who were\ntreated in hospital EDs were examined by age group,\ngender, primary body part injured, diagnosis, and hospi-\ntal admission status.\nEDs for nonfatal injuries sustained while riding ATVs.\nThe number of ATV-related injuries increased by 25%\nover the 3-year period. Males aged 11 to 15 years ac-\ncounted for 52% of all ATV-related ED visits and hospi-\ntalizations among young riders. Children aged 0 to 5\nyears were more likely than the older children to have\nfacial injuries, whereas the older children were more\nlikely to sustain lower trunk and leg or foot injuries.\nFractures were the most common diagnosis, accounting\nfor 27% of ED visits and 45% of hospitalizations.\nConclusions. Current legal and regulatory standards\nhave been ineffective in reducing injuries among young\nATV riders. Renewed efforts by health care providers to\ncounsel parents about the injury risk to children who\nride ATVs and advocate for more stringent state-level\nminimum age requirements may help reduce the escalat-\ning rates of ATV-related injuries among young riders.\natric injuries, injury prevention, epidemiology, accidents.\nABBREVIATIONS. ATV, all-terrain vehicle; CPSC, Consumer\nProduct Safety Commission; ED, emergency department; NEISS,\nNational Electronic Injury Surveillance System; CI, confidence\ninterval.\nAll-terrain vehicles (ATVs) are motorized, gas-\noline-powered vehicles that generally weigh\npressure tires, a seat designed to be straddled by the\nuser, and handlebars for steering. These vehicles are\ndesigned for use by riders on off-road, nonpaved\nterrain. ATVs have gained in popularity in recent\nyears, and this rise in use has been accompanied by\nincreases in the number of deaths and injuries.1,2 A\nrecent report by the US Consumer Product Safety\nCommission (CPSC) noted that the number of ATV-\nrelated injuries treated in hospital emergency depart-\nments (EDs) has risen annually for the past 11 years\naged 15 years accounted for 31% of ATV-related\nED visits in 2003. The current report describes the\nATV-related nonfatal injuries to riders aged 15\nyears who were treated in hospital EDs during 2001\u00ad\nMETHODS\nNational estimates for ATV-related injuries were obtained from\nthe CPSC's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System\n(NEISS)-All Injury Program. This database is a nationally repre-\nsentative, stratified probability sample of 66 US hospitals with 6\nbeds and a 24-hour ED. The data are abstracted from medical\ncharts for initial ED visits related to injuries, consumer products,\nor both. We reviewed the narrative portion of each record to\nexclude cases in which the patient was not injured while riding on\nan ATV (eg, patient injured while unloading an ATV from a truck\nor while being pulled on a sled behind an ATV) and cases in which\nthe medical record did not clearly indicate whether the child had\nbeen riding an ATV at the time of the injury (n  258). Data from\nthe included cases were weighted by the inverse of the probability\nof selection to produce national estimates.4 We calculated annu-\nalized estimates of injuries on the basis of weighted data for 1563\nATV-related injuries among young riders treated in EDs during\ncorresponding years.5 A direct variance estimation procedure was\nused to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and account for\nthe complex sample design.4 The diagnosis and primary body part\ninjured were classified according to the most severe presenting\ninjury.6 The distributions of diagnosis and primary body part\ninjured by age presented in Table 2 and the distribution of hospi-\ntalization by age and primary body part injured presented in the\nresults are based on the unweighted data, because some of the cell\nFrom the *National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia; Loma Linda University\nChildren's Hospital, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda,\nCalifornia; and \u00a7Injury Control Research Center, West Virginia University,\nMorgantown, West Virginia.\nNo conflict of interest declared.\nAddress correspondence to Ruth A.

The\nnumber of ATV-related injuries increased from\nage and gender of the children treated, the charac-\nteristics of their injuries, and the rates of hospitaliza-\ntion were similar for all 3 years of the study period.\nThe annualized ATV-related injury rate was 56 per\ninjuries among children; 74% of the injured riders\naged 11 to 15 years were male. Eighty-seven percent\nof children with ATV-related injuries were treated\nand released from the ED.\nDiagnosis\nFractures and contusions or abrasions were the\nmost common injuries, together accounting for 52%\nof all ED visits for ATV-related injuries among\nyoung riders (Table 1). Based on the unweighted\ndata, fractures were more common among the older\nage groups, accounting for 29% of ED visits among\nchildren aged 6 to 10 years, and 22% of visits among\nchildren aged 0 to 5 years. Lacerations were most\ncommon among children aged 0 to 5 years, account-\ning for 29% of their ED visits (Table 2). The distribu-\ntion of diagnosis was similar for both genders.\nPrimary Body Part Injured\nThe body part with the most severe injury varied\nby age (Table 2). Based on the unweighted data,\nchildren aged 0 to 5 years were twice as likely as\nchildren aged 6 to 10 years and nearly 5 times as\nlikely as those aged 11 to 15 years to injure their face\nor mouth. Lower trunk and lower extremity injuries\nwere more common in the 2 older age groups. The\ndistribution of body part injured was similar for both\ngenders.\nDisposition\nTwelve percent of children with ATV-related inju-\nries who were treated in EDs were admitted to a\nhospital. Males aged 11 to 15 years accounted for\n52% of all hospital admissions for ATV-related inju-\nries among children. Compared with ED visits for all\ninjuries among children aged 0 to 15, those with\nATV-related injuries were 5 times as likely to be\npercent of children aged 0 to 5 years were hospital-\ndren diagnosed with a fracture accounted for the\nlargest proportion of hospitalizations (45%), fol-\nlowed by children with internal injuries (24%). Inju-\nries to the head, face, or neck accounted for 38% of\nhospitalizations, and injuries to the leg or foot ac-\ncounted for 27% of hospitalizations. Based on the\nunweighted data, hospitalization for injuries to the\nhead, face, or neck was more common among chil-\ndren in the younger age groups (0\u00ad5 and 6\u00ad10 years),\naccounting for approximately half of the hospitaliza-\ntions in each age group, compared with 38% of hos-\npitalizations for children aged 11 to 15 years.\nDISCUSSION\nestimated number of children aged 0 to 15 years who\nsought care at hospital EDs for nonfatal injuries sus-\ntained while riding ATVs increased by 25% from\nfor more than half of all ATV-related injuries among\nchildren. Fractures were the most common diagno-\nsis, accounting for 27% of ED visits. Children aged 0\nto 5 years were more likely than those aged 6 to 15\nyears to have facial injuries, whereas the older chil-\ndren were more likely to sustain lower trunk and leg\nor foot injuries.\nhospital EDs for ATV-related injuries were hospital-\nized. Compared with ED visits for all types of inju-\nries among children in this age group, those with\nATV-related injuries were 5 times as likely to be\nhospitalized. Males aged 11 to 15 years accounted for\n52% of the hospitalizations for ATV-related injuries\namong children. Fractures were the most common\ndiagnosis, accounting for 45% of hospitalizations.\nThe estimates presented in this report include only\nchildren who were injured while riding an ATV. In\njured by an ATV that they were not riding or that the\nmedical record did not clearly indicate that they\nwere riding. Common scenarios for injuries to non-\nriders included being struck by an ATV ridden by\nsomeone else, being injured while loading or unload-\ning an ATV, or being injured by a stationary ATV\n(eg, injuring the foot while trying to kick-start an\nATV). The occupant status of the injured child was\nmissing for a substantial number of cases in which a\nchild was run over by an ATV. These cases were\nexcluded from this report. It is likely, however, that\nsome of these children had been riding the ATV\nbefore it ran over them.\nThe estimates presented here differ somewhat\nfrom the estimates provided by the CPSC in its 2003\nannual report of ATV-related deaths and injuries.3\nFor example, for 2003, the CPSC estimated that\npital EDs for ATV-related injuries, compared with\nour estimate of 40 403 injured ATV riders of the same\nage. This difference in estimates is possible for sev-\neral reasons. The CPSC estimates include all ATV-\nrelated injuries regardless of whether the child was\noperating the ATV.3 The CPSC estimates are derived\nfrom reports of a probability sample of 100 NEISS\nhospitals, whereas the estimates presented in this\nreport are derived from a subsample of 66 hospitals\nthat participate in the NEISS-All Injury Program.4 In\naddition, the CPSC adjusts its estimates downward\nTABLE 1.

Rates and CIs were not calculated on unstable estimates.\nby 8% to account for cases that are coded incor-\nrectly as being ATV related,3 whereas we reviewed\neach record and made exclusions on a case-by-case\nbasis.\nThere are several limitations to the findings in this\nreport. The NEISS provides national estimates and\ndoes not allow for estimates by region, state, or local\njurisdiction. Furthermore, some geographic regions\nwith relatively high ATV injury rates may not be\nadequately represented in the NEISS. For example,\nAlaska and West Virginia, states with high ATV-\nrelated pediatric mortality rates, are not represent-\ned.7,8 The NEISS includes information about only the\nmost severe injury based on the physician's assess-\nment. Information about the rider's position on the\nATV (eg, driver, passenger) was not available for\n71% of riders, and there was no information on the\nsize of the ATV or the rider's frequency of ATV use,\nlevel of experience, or helmet use. Finally, because\nthe NEISS does not include children treated in phy-\nsician offices or clinics, the actual annual number of\nATV-related injuries among young riders is likely to\nbe higher than the estimates presented here.\nThe most recent national survey of ATV riders\nyears had ridden an ATV at least once in the previ-\nous year. Eighty-five percent of the children who had\ndriven ATVs drove ones with engines 90 mL (ie,\nadult-sized ATVs).2 Furthermore, 87% of the chil-\ndren who were injured while driving ATVs were\ndriving adult-sized ATVs. This pattern of children\noperating adult-sized ATVs persists despite recom-\nmendations by the CPSC and some ATV distributors\nthat children aged 15 years not ride adult-sized\nBecause children often lack the physical strength,\ncognitive abilities, and fine motor skills to operate\nATVs properly, their risk for injury is greater.10 A\nnational case-control study estimated that ATV driv-\ners aged 15 years were nearly 4 times as likely as\nolder drivers to be injured.11 Because of the increased\nrisk of injury to children, coupled with the propen-\nsity for children to ride adult-sized ATVs, some med-\nical and consumer advocacy organizations, including\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American\nAcademy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, and the Con-\nsumer Federation of America, recommend prohibit-\nAugust 2002, the Consumer Federation of America\nfiled a petition with the CPSC requesting that the\ncommission ban the sale of adult-sized ATVs for use\nCPSC staff recommended that the commission deny\nthe petition, citing that the impact of such a ban\nwould be limited because major ATV distributors\nalready require dealers not to sell adult-sized ATVs\nfor use by children. Moreover, the ban would not\napply to sales of used ATVs, which account for 37%\nof all ATV sales.17 The commission heard testimony\n2005, CPSC Chairman Hal Stratton directed the staff\nto review all existing ATV safety standards, particu-\nlarly as they relate to young riders (H. Stratton,\nCPSC, memorandum to review ATV standards, per-\nMost states have some laws or regulations govern-\ning the use of ATVs. According to the Specialty\nVehicle Institute of America, 28 states have mini-\nmum age requirements.18 These regulations apply to\nyoung riders aged 10 to 18 years and include a wide\nvariety of qualifiers such as where ATVs can be\noperated and exceptions for age requirements if the\nchild is supervised by an adult or has a safety certif-\nicate. The effectiveness of state-imposed require-\nments for operating ATVs in reducing serious inju-\nries and deaths among young riders is unclear.\nUpperman and colleagues7 examined the issue and\nfound no difference in ATV-related mortality rates\namong children between states with and without\nminimum age requirements and safety certification.\nKeenan and Bratton19 compared the characteristics of\nseriously injured ATV riders aged 15 years from a\nTABLE 2.

Finally, Helmkamp8 found that\nthe presence of some level of ATV regulation and\nhelmet-use requirement is associated with lower\nATV-related mortality rates in the overall popula-\ntion.\nDespite placement of decals with safety warnings\non all new ATVs and recommendations for restricted\nuse by children from the CPSC and medical associ-\nations, parents continue to obtain ATVs for their\nchildren's use. Most children ride adult-sized ATVs,\nand there is currently no federal mandate restricting\nthe sale of adult-sized ATVs for use by children.\nRenewed efforts by health care providers to counsel\nparents about the injury risk to children who use\nATVs and advocate for more stringent state-level\nminimum age requirements may help reduce the\nescalating numbers of ATV-related injuries occurring\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Patricia Holmgreen, formerly of the National Center\nfor Injury Prevention and Control, for programming and statistical\ncontributions.
