    "abstract": "Abstract\nLittle experimental research has investigated how attitudes are formed via direct personal experience within risky\nenvironments. This report summarizes the development of Treasure Island (TI), an attitude learning paradigm based on\nBeanFest. Two studies are reported: The first designed to compare the outcomes of TI with BeanFest; the second to show\nhow a manipulation of risk predictability would affect attitude learning within the paradigm. Study 1 demonstrated sampling\nand learning asymmetries similar to those seen in BeanFest, although the magnitude of these asymmetries was attenuated by\nthe opportunity for participants to landmark decisions. The manipulation of risk predictability in Study 2 led participants to\nseemingly form a less accurate representation of the underlying pay-off contingencies; however, a significant negative learning\nasymmetry did persist. The findings of this research (a) identify TI as a versatile paradigm for the investigation of attitude\nlearning within risky environments and (b) confirm the robust nature of the negative learning asymmetry in contingent-\nlearning settings; but (c) assert that care should be taken when generalizing the findings of BeanFest to ostensibly more\nvariable contexts.\n",

It is understood that \" . . . all aspects\nof responding, including emotions, cognitions, and overt\nbehavior, are infused with the evaluative meaning that atti-\nonly do attitudes color our evaluations of the social environ-\nment but they provide us with approach and avoidance moti-\nvations to guide our interactions within it (e.g., Cacioppo &\nBerntson, 1994). Indeed, by virtue of the fact that attitudes\nlabel things (i.e., people, issues, and objects) as positive or\nnegative they necessarily have implications for action (Eiser\nHowever, despite the centrality of the attitude concept to\nsocial psychology (e.g., Ajzen, 2001; Eagly & Chaiken,\nthe majority of our likes and dislikes are learned and not\ninnate (e.g., Rozin & Millman, 1987), the study of how atti-\ntudes are initially acquired and shaped by experience has\nbeen relatively neglected (Eiser, Shook, & Fazio, 2007).\nFurthermore, where research into attitude formation pro-\ncesses has been conducted, this has tended to focus princi-\npally on how attitudes are formed through \"passive\"\nexperience--where opportunities to learn occur indepen-\ndently of an individual's own behavior (e.g., mere exposure,\nsee Bornstein, 1989; evaluative conditioning, see De Houwer,\nThomas, & Baeyens, 2001)--with research into attitude for-\nmation in \"active\" or \"experiential\" learning contexts receiv-\ning less attention (Eiser & Fazio, 2008).\nAttitude Formation via Personal\nExploration\nActively establishing what (or where) is good/beneficial or\nbad/costly within a given context (i.e., what should be\napproached or avoided) necessarily constitutes attitude for-\nmation, as we tend to acquire attitudes consistent with our\nexperiences (Eiser & Fazio, 2008). However, active learning\nscenarios present people with a challenge. The world is a\nrisky place where approach\u00adavoidance decisions are often\nmade on the basis of incomplete or imperfect information,\nwhich can lead to errors. For instance, wrongly classifying\nsomething as \"bad\" when it is \"good\" can mean that some-\nthing desirable (e.g., appetizing food) is avoided.\nMisclassifying things as \"good\" when they are \"bad\" could\nmean that undesirable (or even hazardous) things are\n1University of Sheffield, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nChristopher R.

Remaining quiescent, while often less risky,\npresents no such learning opportunity.\nThus, when entering a new learning context we must\nstrike a balance between approach\u00adavoidance motivations to\nfacilitate goal pursuit (e.g., finding appetizing food) while\nminimizing the risk of harm (e.g., eating something disagree-\nable). Exactly how we strike and refine this balance depends\nupon a number of factors, including personality factors (e.g.,\nsensation seeking, see Zuckerman, 1994; regulatory focus,\nsee Higgins, 1998) and incentive values (e.g., Liberman,\n1993). Ultimately, though, it is often our expectancy about\nthe likely outcome of an approach/avoidance response (based\non previous direct of inferred experience) and how consistent\nthis is with their current goals, which shapes such decisions\n(consistent with expectancy-value theory, for example,\nThe BeanFest Studies\nThe gap in our understanding of attitude learning in active\nlearning settings prompted Fazio, Eiser, and colleagues (i.e.,\ndevelop the BeanFest paradigm. Based on the principles of\nreinforcement learning (see Sutton & Barto, 1998), BeanFest\nis a two-stage computer-based foraging paradigm that inves-\ntigates how attitudes form and generalize toward new stimuli\n(in this case beans) where feedback about the nature of stim-\nuli (i.e., whether or not they are \"good\" or \"bad\") is contin-\ngent on the sampling decisions of the learner. For details of\nthe procedure, see Fazio et al. (2004) or try BeanFest go to:\nhttp://www.millisecond.com/download/samples/\nv3/BeanFest/.\nOne of the key findings from studies using BeanFest is\nhow biases in approach behavior tend to result in persistent\nnegative asymmetries in the learning and generalization (see\nEiser, 2007). In short, because participants are motivated to\napproach positive beans and avoid negative beans there is a\ngreater likelihood that they will approach and correct false-\npositives (i.e., believing a bad bean is good) than false nega-\ntives (i.e., believing a good bean is bad). This means that\ncorrect identification of \"bad\" beans typically exceeds that of\n\"good\" beans (negative learning asymmetry). Moreover,\nconsistent with the \"negativity bias\" (see Cacioppo, Gardner,\ntypically show a bias toward labeling previously unseen\nbeans as \"bad,\" even after controlling for the differences in\nthe learning of the \"good\" and \"bad\" beans (negative gener-\nalization asymmetry).\nResearch using BeanFest has yielded pioneering insight\ninto attitude formation in active learning scenarios and the\nimplications this holds for the understanding of diverse top-\nics, such as prejudice (Deutsch & Fazio, 2008), political ide-\nology (Shook & Fazio, 2009), depression (Conklin, Strunk,\n& Fazio, 2009), emotional reactivity to stressful events\n(Pietri, Fazio, & Shook, 2013), and vulnerability to emo-\ntional disorders (Shook, Fazio, & Vasey, 2007). However, to\ndate all experiments utilizing BeanFest have focused on atti-\ntude learning in perceptively uncertain but objectively stable,\nprescriptive environments; where stimulus valence is\nunchanging (i.e., where good beans are always good and bad\nbeans always bad) and where target stimuli are presented\nsequentially (i.e., where each trial constitutes the presenta-\ntion of a single bean to participants devoid of other contex-\ntual cues that might aid the decision to approach or avoid it).\nThese parameters pose problems for our broader under-\nstanding of attitude formation processes in risky experien-\ntial-learning scenarios. For example, our social and physical\nenvironments are arguably more variable than presented\nwithin BeanFest, with the availability and/or valence of\ndesired resources being altered by our or others' interactions\nwithin them (or by the simple passing of time). For example,\nHardin's (1968) \"tragedy of the commons\" illustrates how\nsocial competition for a limited resource in line with one's\nself interests can lead to the overexploitation and rapid\ndecline in the availability and/or quality of that resource.\nAlso, it is not always the case we make sequential, isolated\nsampling decisions based solely on the features of an indi-\nvidual stimulus, but rather we often concurrently utilize\nother features or items within the decision-making context to\naid or landmark these sampling decisions (e.g., when choos-\ning groceries, for example, Putrevu & Lord, 2001).\nConsiderable research both in human and in lower-animal\nsubjects exists to indicate how both these (and other) factors\ncan influence real-world foraging and navigation (e.g.,\nShafir, & Blais, 2004). For instance, cognate research by\nGoldstone and colleagues (e.g., Goldstone & Ashpole, 2004;\nGoldstone, Ashpole, & Roberts, 2005; Goldstone, Roberts,\nhow human foraging within two-dimensional virtual envi-\nronments can be negatively affected by the presence of com-\npetitors, resulting in sub-optimal sampling behavior (i.e.,\nover- and under-matching of available resources) as partici-\npants utilize the foraging decisions of others to help guide\ntheir own decisions. With this in mind, one might hypothe-\nsize that factors such as the opportunity to landmark one's\nsampling decisions could affect the attitude learning and\ngeneralization observed within the paradigm.\nIn sum, while BeanFest studies have proved invaluable in\nstrengthening our understanding of how attitudes form and\nfunction in active learning scenarios, the question of whether\nor not the central findings from this research (e.g., the learn-\ning and generalization asymmetries) are generalizable to (a)\nperceptively more variable contexts, (b) contexts where the\nopportunity to concurrently reference (i.e., landmark) one's\nJones and Eiser 3\napproach\u00adavoidance decisions against experiences with\nother stimuli, and (c) other kinds of target stimuli (i.e., going\nbeyond beans) remains open.\nThe principal aim of the current research was to develop\nand test a modified version of the BeanFest paradigm capa-\nble of simultaneously investigating these things--this was\nachieved through the evolution of the Treasure Island (TI)\nparadigm.\nThe \"TI\" Paradigm\nThe TI paradigm (outlined fully below) is purposefully\ndesigned to operate in a largely comparable way to BeanFest;\nhowever, rather than eating or rejecting beans, participants\nplay the role of an explorer visiting an \"island\" where they\nare required to search for treasure (equivalent to eating\n\"good\" beans) while avoiding pirates (equivalent to avoiding\n\"bad\" beans). The \"island\" is created by simply overlaying a\ndepiction of a TI across the 10 \u00d7 10 matrix used to determine\nthe valence of stimuli within BeanFest. This creates a\ntwo-dimensional life-space with three (hidden) positive\nregions and three (hidden) negative regions (akin to the\n\"good\" and \"bad\" families of beans; see Figure 1).\nParticipants are presented with a full depiction of the TI on\nall trials and so have concurrent access to all stimuli when\nmaking their sampling decisions.\nThus, in contrast to BeanFest, (a) stimuli are differenti-\nated by their location in the spatial matrix as opposed to their\nindividual features (i.e., shape and speckling of beans), (b)\nindividual sampling decisions can be landmarked against\nprior experiences at other locations, and (c) because partici-\npants can be made to believe that the pirates (negative enti-\nties) are either static or mobile, there is an opportunity to\nmanipulate the perceived environmental consistency and\nhence the anticipated risk associated with sampling\ndecisions.1\nThe remainder of this article details the development of\nthe TI paradigm and reports on two studies: the first designed\nto assess whether or not the paradigm would produce the pat-\nterns in sampling and learning common to BeanFest, thus\nFigure 1. Treasure Island: Highlighted within the island are the six experimental regions (3x positive and 3x negative), which are\nformally equivalent to the \"coordinates\" used to generate good and bad beans in BeanFest.( see Fazio et al. 2004).\nNote. The experimental regions are not visible to participants.\n4 SAGE Open\nproviding a test of whether the findings of BeanFest can be\ngeneralized to a new stimulus type (in this case, spatial coor-\ndinates) and the second designed to investigate how a manip-\nulation of environmental consistency (specifically the\nperceived consistency of coordinate valences) would affect\nparticipants' sampling decisions and attitude learning within\nthe paradigm. The article ends with a consideration of the\nresearch implications and suggestions for further studies.\nStudy 1: TI and BeanFest Comparison\nStudy 1 was designed to test whether or not the TI paradigm\nwould generate similar trends in sampling and learning to\nthose observed in BeanFest. It was hypothesized that the\nsimilarities between the BeanFest and TI paradigms should\nmean that the negative sampling and learning asymmetries\ntypical of BeanFest should emerge. That is, participants\nshould show a greater tendency to approach and correct\n\"false-positive\" than \"false negative\" beliefs within the task,\nresulting in more accurate learning and recall of the negative\ncoordinates versus the positive coordinates (i.e., negative\nlearning asymmetry).\nMethod\nParticipants. A total of 30 (7 male and 23 female) undergrad-\nuate and graduate psychology students at the University of\nSheffield, United Kingdom, participated in this study. All\nparticipants had normal or corrected to normal vision, were\nage\nreceived partial course credit or  \u00a32 for taking part. Twenty-\nnine participants completed the sampling phase (none with\nrestarts--explained below).\nProcedure. TI was designed on a PC using E-Prime (Schnei-\nwere tested individually in a quiet laboratory cubicle. Upon\narrival, each participant was provided with a series of instruc-\ntions about TI. Participants were informed that the task\nwould comprise two phases: the first taking the form of a\n\"treasure hunt\" in which their aim was to accrue wealth by\nsampling the environment (sampling phase); and a second\nphase, instructions about which they would receive follow-\ning the treasure hunt (recall phase). Thus, participants were\nnot informed at this stage that the second phase would con-\nstitute a recall task.\nSampling phase: Instructions.Participants were presented\nwith the treasure map (see Figure 1) and told that the com-\nputer would sequentially select coordinates for them to sam-\nple. They were informed that approach responses (made by\npressing \"Z\" on the keyboard) could meet with one of two\npossible outcomes, that is, the discovery of Treasure (+10\ncoins) or a Pirate Town (-10 coins). They were also told that\navoidance responses (made by pressing \"M\") would have\nno net impact on their accrued wealth, but that they would\nnot receive feedback as to the valence of the coordinate (i.e.,\nfeedback was contingent on approach).2\nParticipants were notified that they would start the task\nwith 50 virtual coins and that their coins tally would be\nupdated following each sampling response. There was no\nupper limit to the wealth that could be accrued (other than\nthat predetermined by the number of trials); however, partici-\npants were notified that if they ran out of coins, they would\nbe evicted from the island and receive instructions relating to\nthe second phase of the task. Unlike BeanFest, once partici-\npants were evicted from the island they were not restarted,\nunless their eviction occurred within the first 10 min of\nbeginning the task (i.e., upon receiving the instructions).\nThis 10-min window was introduced to prevent the prema-\nture attrition of participants. Participants evicted during this\ntime were restarted minus the initial instructions, whereas\nparticipants evicted after this time were thanked for their\ntime and dismissed.3\nIn addition to guaranteed course credit or \u00a32 (approx. US\n$3) for participating, participants' performance within the\ngame was also tied to a donation to a local children's charity.\nParticipants were informed that a donation of 50p would be\nmade as a result of their participation and that their final\ncoins tally would be matched with an additional donation\n(i.e., 1p for every coin). The charity donation concept was\nintroduced as pilot studies revealed that guaranteed course\ncredit was not sufficient to motivate participants within the\ntask.\nParticipants then received an automated demonstration of\na sampling-phase trial, before partaking in a short practice\nsession, comprising six predetermined trials. These six trials\npresented one preselected coordinate from each of the six\nregions on the island. Participants were encouraged to\napproach all six of these coordinates to become familiar with\nthe outcomes of correct and incorrect approach decisions.\nSampling phase: Test trials.The sampling phase had a 3\n(Trial Block: 1, 2, 3) \u00d7 2 (Coordinate Valence: Negative vs.\nPositive) repeated-measures design. In each block, the 36\ntarget coordinates (18 \u00d7 positive and 18 \u00d7 negative, high-\nlighted in Figure 1) were presented once to participants. The\npresentation order of the coordinates within each block was\nrandomized except for the first 12 coordinates in Block 1.\nThese trials were fixed across participants (as in BeanFest,\nsee Fazio et al., 2004) to reduce the chance of premature evic-\ntion from the island. These trials comprised the presentation\nof two coordinates from each of the six coordinate clusters.\nFollowing completion of Block 3 (or when the participant\nran out of coins), a screen appeared notifying the participant\nof their eviction from the island. Participants were instructed\nto inform the experimenter that they had completed Phase 1.\nThe experimenter made a record of their coin tally before\nproviding the participant with details of the second phase of\nthe experiment.\nJones and Eiser 5\nRecall phase: Instructions. Participants were informed that\nthe treasure hunt aspect of the game was over and that their\ntask was now to recall which coordinates were \"good\" and\n\"bad.\" They were told that they would be presented with a\nseries of coordinates and that for each one they should indi-\ncate whether they thought it would yield treasure (by press-\ning \"Z\") or a pirate town (by pressing \"M\"). The computer\nthen recorded whether the participants' response accurately\nmatched the actual valence of the coordinate.4\nRecall phase: Test trials. On each trial, one coordinate on\nthe treasure map was highlighted. Written instructions then\nappeared, prompting participants to make their judgment.\nDuring the recall phase, the reward and feedback structure of\nthe sampling phase did not apply and participants received\nno feedback as to the \"actual\" valence of each coordinate.\nParticipants were required to categorize each of the 36 pre-\nsented coordinates, as well as estimate the valence of 34\nnovel coordinates (comprising 26 coordinates adjacent to\npresented locations and 8 unaffiliated coordinates [A10,\ninstructed to remember the valence of presented coordinates\nand make predictions about the likely valence of the novel\ncoordinates. It was hoped that responses made within this\nphase of the game could be used to establish the extent of\nattitude learning within the paradigm and how readily atti-\ntudes might generalize.\nThis recall assessment provides a subjective measure of\nparticipants'evaluation of stimuli (i.e., coordinates) grounded\nconceptually within the expectancy-value framework of atti-\ntudes (e.g., Fishbein, 1963). As the gaming aspects of the\nparadigm have ceased (i.e., participants choices no longer\nreflect approach and avoidance decisions) and participants\nare simply invited to comment on whether coordinates are\n\"good\" (contain treasure) or \"bad\" (contain pirates), this\nexercise can be seen as a direct measure of participants' atti-\ntudes rather than a behavioral index thereof. For a full justi-\nfication of this measure of attitude, see Fazio et al. (2004).\nDebrief.Participants were first provided with a short\nfeedback questionnaire asking them to comment on the per-\nceived purpose of the study and whether they had noticed\nanything particular about the distribution of treasure and\npirate towns. Participants were then fully debriefed, thanked,\nand dismissed.\nResults\nSampling phase. A 3 (Block: 1, 2, 3) \u00d7 2 (Valence: Negative\nvs. Positive) repeated-measures ANOVA yielded main\n.001, = .46 (large ES), and a significant Block \u00d7 Valence\nresults confirmed that sampling behavior was roughly com-\nparable with that observed in BeanFest, with a sharp attenu-\nation in the approach of negative stimuli but a relative\nmaintenance of the approach of positive stimuli over time\n(see Figure 2 for visual comparison with Fazio et al., 2004,\nexperiment 1).\nRecall phase.Participants showed above chance recall for\nboth positive and negative coordinates (ts  3.08, ps < .01, ds\n 1.16; large ESs).

Responses to the eight\nnon-adjacent coordinates were recoded to reflect the propor-\ntion of participants labeled as negative. Labeling of these\ncoordinates was at chance levels (i.e., 0.50), indicating that\nequal numbers were seen to be positive and negative, t(28) =\nRecall accuracy for positive and negative stimuli in TI and BF.\nMeans\nNegative Positive\nProportion of stimuli approached\nBF Positive\nBF Negative\nTI Positive\nTI Negative\nFigure 2.

Recall of positive\nstimuli is similarly accurate in TI and BF; however, recall of negative\nstimuli is more accurate in BF than in TI. BF = BeanFest; TI = Treasure\nIsland.\n6 SAGE Open\nDiscussion\nTaken together, the trends in approach and recall in this study\nwere broadly consistent with those seen in BeanFest.\nParticipants were able to use the outcomes of their sampling\nbehavior to learn about the distribution of treasure and pirates\non the island (and adjust their future approach\u00adavoidance\ndecisions), but a remaining preponderance of incorrect\navoidance choices resulted in a more accurate learning of the\nnegative coordinates. In contrast to BeanFest, however, no\nsignificant generalization asymmetry was observed within\nWhile still evident, the learning asymmetry within this\nstudy was smaller than that observed within BeanFest (see\nFigure 2). This finding, combined with the lack of a signifi-\ncant generalization asymmetry, is perhaps indicative of the\nopportunities that participants had to visually reference their\ndecisions within the task. Specifically, in contrast to\nBeanFest, because TI participants could see all coordinates\nat all times, it would arguably be easier for them to recognize\n(and recall the valence of) presented coordinates and distin-\nguish generalization targets as \"new.\" This should have not\nonly narrowed the expected learning asymmetry but also\nshould have reduced the likelihood of automatic generaliza-\ntion to novel targets based on mistaken identity (i.e., confus-\ning a novel coordinate for a presented one of known valence).\nHowever, despite the apparent advantage offered within\nTI by the opportunity to visually reference (i.e., landmark)\nsampling decisions, a significant negative learning asymme-\ntry did still emerge. This finding is of importance as it is\nindicative of a generalization of the negativity bias in attitude\nformation inherent to BeanFest, not only to a novel stimulus\nset (i.e., spatial coordinates) but also to a scenario where the\nstimuli can be viewed simultaneously, as opposed to\nsequentially.\nTaken together, Study 1 confirmed TI as a viable para-\ndigm for exploring attitude formation, and one that could\nproduce similar sampling and learning trends to those\nobserved in BeanFest. We next sought to investigate how a\nmanipulation of risk predictability might affect these\ntrends.\nStudy 2: Risk Predictability\nManipulation\nRisk predictability was manipulated by varying participants'\nperceptions of the risk of encountering pirates at particular\nlocations. This was achieved by either informing participants\n(correctly) that the pirates would remain in their towns (con-\nsistent condition), or (incorrectly) that the pirates could roam\nthe island and so turn up in a location that had previously\nbeen safe (inconsistent condition). This manipulation was\nmade without the need for actual changes to the underlying\nmatrix (i.e., the pirates did not actually roam), allowing for\nthe direct comparison of participants' responses in percep-\ntively stable (consistent) and unstable (inconsistent) versions\nof the same task.\nIt was hypothesized that participants in the consistent\ncondition should show patterns of sampling and learning\nsimilar to those observed in Study 1.\nIn the inconsistent condition, the belief that outcome con-\ntingencies could change was hypothesized to lead to more\nvaried search behavior, especially later in the sampling\nphase. Specifically, positive locations that had previously\nbeen found to contain treasure might be later avoided on the\ngrounds that they may now house pirates. Conversely, loca-\ntions that had previously been categorized as negative might\nbe later approached on the grounds that the pirates may have\nmoved on.\nOverall, we anticipated that the greater perceived unpre-\ndictability of the environment should result in generally\nmore sustained approach behavior--and hence greater expe-\nrience of actual reward and punishment contingencies--but\nwith paradoxically poorer learning of actual valence-location\ncontingencies.\nMethod\nParticipants. Seventy (17 male and 53 female) undergraduate\npsychology students participated. All participants had nor-\nmal or corrected to normal vision, were aged between 18 and\n34 (M = 20.1 years), and received partial course credit or \u00a32\nfor taking part. Thirty-five participants were assigned to each\nTable 1.

The fol-\nlowing analyses are performed on the responses of the 60\nparticipants who managed to complete the sampling phase.\nProcedure.The procedure was the same as that outlined in\nStudy 1; however, the instructions were altered so as to\nmanipulate the apparent mobility of pirates. Specifically,\nparticipants in the consistent condition were (correctly)\ninformed that pirates were confined to towns and could not\nroam the island; while participants in the inconsistent condi-\ntion were (incorrectly) informed that the pirates could roam\nthe island at will.\nResults\nManipulation check.

B3SA calculated by subtracting\nBlock 3 positive approach from Block 3 negative approach.\ngeneralization asymmetry was observed (akin to Study 1),\nthere were significant negative asymmetries in Block 3 sam-\npling and recall. These trends indicated how sampling behav-\nior within the paradigm (and hence learning) was being\ngoverned by expected outcomes at the presented locations, a\nresult supported by the significant correlations between\n\"accurate\" Block 3 sampling behavior and recall within this\ncondition. Consistent with Study 1, it was also evident that\nthe residual preponderance of false-negative beliefs resulted\nin less accurate recall of the positive coordinates.\nBy contrast, participants in the inconsistent condition\nshowed evidence of apparently more maladaptive sampling\nbehavior (particularly between Blocks 2 and 3) and poorer\nrecall compared with the consistent condition, suggesting\nthat the risk predictability manipulation had disrupted atti-\ntude learning. Indeed, the lack of significant correlations\nbetween sampling and recall within this condition suggested\nthat participants were not as readily matching the outcomes\nof their accurate sampling behavior in Block 3 with congru-\nent recall responses.\nInterestingly, while general recall accuracy was lower in\nthe inconsistent condition compared with the consistent con-\ndition, a negative learning asymmetry did persist. This asym-\nmetry was ostensibly the result of the risk predictability\nmanipulation having had a marked impact on participants'\nlearning of positive versus negative locations. We argue that\nthe sampling strategy employed by participants in the incon-\nsistent condition offers an explanation for the retention of\nthis asymmetry.\nFirst, if participants did believe that the island was change-\nable during the sampling phase, then their resultant tenden-\ncies to avoid returning to positive areas (believing them to be\nnegative) and to re-approach negative areas (believing them\nto be positive) should have served to directly decrease and\nincrease their actual experience of positive and negative\nlocation contingencies, respectively. Second, the continued\nexperience of negative outcomes at areas thought to have\nbeen vacated by pirates (from an incorrect approach of nega-\ntive coordinates) should have led to a belief among partici-\npants in the inconsistent condition that the environment was\nnegatively biased. Both experiences would have likely\ninflated negative responding relative to positive responding\nin the recall phase.\nIt is clear, then, that the manipulation of risk predictability\ndid have a notable impact on sampling trends and recall\nresponses relative to seemingly more stable versions of the\nTI task. However, while we contend that the findings from\nStudy 2 support the original hypothesis accompanying this\nstudy (i.e., that participants in the inconsistent condition had\ngenuinely developed less accurate representations of the\nvalence-location contingencies relative to those in the con-\nsistent condition), there is a competing explanation for the\nfindings that would argue that the detriment shown in sam-\npling and recall within the inconsistent condition was more\napparent than real.\nWithin the sampling phase of the inconsistent condition,\nfor instance, if participants were convinced that the environ-\nment was changeable, you might predict that those who had\ndeveloped an accurate representation of the underlying\nmatrix (perhaps equivalent to that of the consistent condi-\ntion) should show poor sampling accuracy. In other words,\npoor sampling accuracy should be expected if participants\nhad established where the good and bad locations were but\nwho were then erroneously updating their approach behav-\niors based on the assumption that the valence of these loca-\ntions had changed.10 Similarly, within the recall phase, if\nparticipants were making predictions about the likely future\nvalence of locations as opposed to simply recalling their last\nexperiences at these locations, then this might also be antici-\npated to artificially lower recall accuracy within the inconsis-\ntent condition (this issue is dealt with further in the general\ndiscussion).\nIn sum, while we conclude that the trends in sampling and\nrecall are indicative of participants in the inconsistent condi-\ntion having poorer learning of the valence-location contin-\ngencies, we concede that further research is required to\ndisentangle the extent to which this detriment is genuine.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe present research developed a modified version of the\nBeanFest paradigm which we used to investigate how people\nmight form attitudes toward spatial location within a percep-\ntively variable active learning scenario (i.e., where the pre-\ndictability of risk could be manipulated) but one in which\nthey could landmark their approach\u00adavoidance decisions.\nStudy 1 illustrated that trends in sampling and learning in the\nnew TI paradigm were broadly consistent with those seen in\nBeanFest studies (e.g., Eiser & Fazio, 2008; Fazio et al.,\ngeneralization asymmetry was observed. Study 2 revealed\nhow a simple manipulation of perceived (not actual) risk pre-\ndictability was apparently sufficient to disrupt participants'\nlearning of the actual underlying valence-location contingen-\ncies, although the extent to which this detriment is real or\napparent should be resolved through further research.\nThe results of Study 1 are important in illustrating the\ngeneralization of the negative learning asymmetry inherent\nto BeanFest to (a) an ostensibly easier learning environment\n(i.e., where participants could landmark their approach\u00ad\navoidance decisions) and (b) a task using a qualitatively dif-\nferent kind of stimulus (i.e., spatial location vs. beans). We\nsuggest that this is indicative of the robust nature of this\nasymmetry under perceptively stable conditions.\nWe argue that the opportunity to landmark approach\u00ad\navoidance decisions within TI explains the lack of the emer-\ngence of a clear generalization asymmetry. Unlike BeanFest,\nit would have been easier for TI participants to recognize\ngeneralization coordinates as new, thus limiting automatic\ngeneralization based on mistaken identity (i.e., mistaking a\nnovel bean of unknown valence for a presented bean of\nknown valence due to visual similarities). We contend that\nthis finding is indicative that the generalization asymmetry\ninherent to BeanFest is, at least in part, tied to the decision to\nsequentially present stimuli--as people are required to retro-\nspectively recall rather than simultaneously reference their\ndecisions.\nThe results of Study 2 indicate the apparently detrimental\nimpact that perceived risk predictability has on attitude\nlearning and, in doing so, assert that one should take care\nwhen generalizing the findings from BeanFest to situations\nwhere the environment and the objects therein are percep-\ntively more variable. Our research suggests that within per-\nceptively variable environments, the translation of experience\ninto learning is slower and less clearly defined than posited\nby the results of studies employing the BeanFest paradigm.\nThat having been said, even within this perceptively more\nvariable context, the negative learning asymmetry common\nto BeanFest did still emerge. We argue that this finding is\nthus indicative of the transferability of this asymmetry to\nperceptively less stable learning contexts.\nParadigm Limitations and Future Research\nWhile the research outcomes from these studies may hold\nsome relevance for our understanding of judgment and deci-\nsion making (JDM) in risky situations (for a discussion of the\nresearch challenges in this field, see Rakow & Newell, 2010)\nand human foraging behavior (e.g., Goldstone & Ashpole,\nvaluable for (a) enhancing our understanding of \"active\" atti-\ntude formation within ostensibly variable environments and\n(b) producing a tool for further expanding our understanding\nof this under-researched field of psychology. However, bear-\ning in mind the novelty of this paradigm and the limitations\nin the studies outlined, there remains a number of interesting\nresearch opportunities in this area. We outline a few of these\nbelow.\nChanges to the task instructions\nObedience to authority.Building on the early findings\nof Fazio, Eiser, and colleagues (Eiser et al., 2007; Fazio et\nal., 2004, Experiment 5), these studies highlight the influ-\nence that an individuals' beliefs about a learning environ-\nment can have on their perception of actual reinforcement\ncontingencies experienced. Notably, within the inconsistent\ncondition, participants appeared to give greater credence to\nthe expected outcomes (based on the indirect information\nprovided at the start of the task), rather than their directly\nexperienced outcomes at these locations. Indeed, within this\ncondition people were seemingly less able to overcome the\n(incorrect) advice provided to them before commencing the\ntask, resulting in significantly poorer performance.\nIt is possible that this finding is related to the fact that the\ntask instructions came from the experimenter, whom\nparticipants perhaps saw as either an expert and/or as unlikely\nto provide incorrect information. It could be hypothesized\nthat if the instructions was seen as coming from a less author-\nitative source (e.g., other participants, for example, Eiser et\nquickly overcome the inaccuracies in the advice provided\nand would thus show sampling and recall patterns consistent\nwith better learning.\nEqually, however, this finding may stem from a conflict\nbetween motivation and learning within this perceptively\nmore complex version of TI (see discussion of Yerkes-\nDodson Law, for example, Hanoch & Vitouch, 2004;\ncomplexity of the inconsistent condition could have led par-\nticipants to complete the task in a narrower, more piecemeal\nfashion than those in the consistent condition. This might\nhave resulted in a kind of \"confused chasing\" of individual\npay-offs and difficulties in recognizing the broader regional\ncontingencies present within the life-space (see Ert & Erev,\nWe argue that a formal investigation of (a) how the per-\nceived source of the instructions and advice within the task\ninfluences sampling and recall trends and (b) the interactions\nbetween motivation and attitude learning within a TI or\nBeanFest type scenario could provide fruitful avenues for\nfuture research in this field.\nThe impact of inconsistency: Poorer learning or experimen-\ntal artifact?We have concluded that the manipulation of\nrisk predictability in Study 2 led to a poorer leaning of the\nactual location-valence contingencies among participants in\nthe inconsistent condition as compared with the consistent\ncondition. This conclusion would appear to fit both with the\nmore indiscriminate sampling and poorer recall accuracy\nshown in this condition. However, we have also discussed\nthe possibility that the detriment within the inconsistent\ncondition could be more apparent than real. This alterna-\ntive explanation could be strengthened by limitations in the\ninstructions accompanying the recall task.\nIn short, while the instructions accompanying the recall\ntask asked participants to remember which areas were \"good\"\nand \"bad\" (i.e., insinuating that the participants should recall\ntheir last experiences at each location), it is possible that\nsome participants believed that this instruction was asking\nthem to predict future outcomes at each location (as was the\ncase of novel coordinates presented during this phase). If this\nwas the case, and if those in the inconsistent condition main-\ntained a belief that the environment was changeable, then\nthis could help to explain the lower recall accuracy in this\ncondition. That is, while participants in both conditions may\nhave had an equivalent appreciation of the pay-off matrix at\nthe end of the sampling phase (i.e., may have shown equiva-\nlent learning), those in the inconsistent condition may have\nbeen less trusting of this knowledge in predicting future\nexperiences at given locations. Thus, if these participants'\nrecall responses were reflective of anticipated future out-\ncomes at visited locations (not intended) rather than their\nmost recent experience at these locations (intended), this\ncould have artificially lowered recall accuracy in this\ncondition.\nFuture research could usefully adapt the TI procedure to\nformally investigate this possibility. This could be achieved\nby a simple rephrasing of the recall instructions to ensure\nthat participants focus on their last known experience at each\nlocation. These responses could then be compared with those\nfrom a secondary task where participants are invited more\nexplicitly to make predictions about the future valence of\neach location. One would anticipate that accuracy should be\nsimilarly poor in both \"recall\" and \"prediction\" tasks if the\nrisk predictability manipulation has resulted in genuinely\npoorer learning; but that \"recall\" should be superior to \"pre-\ndiction\" (and on par with responses in the consistent condi-\ntions), if the effect of the manipulation is more artifactual.\nCreating a more realistic foraging space\nActual versus implied change to stimulus valence. TI is not\na traditional foraging paradigm in the sense that partici-\npants do not personally navigate the environment to identify\nresources but are, akin to BeanFest, presented with a pre-\nselected series of stimuli in a randomized order. Moreover,\nwithin the current studies, the manipulation of risk predict-\nability was achieved through a variations in the information\nprovided to participants only and not through actual changes\nto the underlying pay-off matrix.\nWhile both factors could be seen to undermine the eco-\nlogical validity of the findings, these design decisions were\npurposeful so as to ensure a broad underlying comparability\nto all test conditions (i.e., all participants had the same poten-\ntial to have the same experiences within the task). Also,\nwhile there was no underlying change to the pay-off matrix,\nit was reasoned that the predictability manipulation should\nbe self-propagating and would thus not require us to make\nsuch changes. Specifically, to the extent that participants\nwere basing their decisions on the expected outcomes, the\nself-generation and subsequent approach of false-positive\nbeliefs (generated by the manipulation of environmental\nconsistency) should have enhanced the perception of the\nenvironment as changeable.\nParticipants in the inconsistent condition did believe the\npirates to be more mobile in comparison with the consistent\ncondition; however, estimates of mobility within this condi-\ntion were fairly moderate. This is presumably because of the\nactual underlying stability of the pay-off matrix and the tim-\ning of the manipulation check (i.e., the manipluation check\ntook place after the TI task was complete and so participants\nmay have established that the pirates were immobile). It is\nlikely, therefore, that the results of the risk predictability\nmanipulation observed within this research are moderate\ncompared with those that would be expected from studies\nwhere the predictability threat is real (i.e., where the pay-off\nmatrix does vary).\nFuture research should thus investigate to what extent\nattitude learning is affected within actually variable contexts\nand/or where participants are more able to select the order in\nwhich they experience stimuli, akin to more real-world\nforaging.\nThe impact of resource depletion on attitude learning.Real-\nworld foragers must often contend with resource deple-\ntion, for example, as inter- and intra-species competition\nfor resources alters the availability of these resources (e.g.,\nies might investigate how resource depletion (i.e., the pre-\ndictability of reward) might affect on sampling decisions and\nattitude formation within the paradigm. This manipulation\ncould be achieved either by altering the actual availability\nof resources (i.e., treasure) on the island or, akin to Study\n2, by altering participants' perceptions about the availability\nof treasure on the island (e.g., informing them that treasure\nyielding coordinates might have less/no treasure once sam-\npled).\nOne key feature of TI that would aid such investigation is\nthat it lessens the rigid \"resource-trial\" contingency present\nin BeanFest. As opposed to BeanFest where for each trial\nparticipants must choose to approach (eat) or avoid (not eat)\nindividual beans, TI presents participants with spatial coordi-\nnates that could feasibly contain variable amounts of a\ndesired resource (e.g., lots of treasure or not much treasure)\nthat could be seen to deplete as a result of sampling\ndecisions.\nInvestigating individual differences and other applications\nThe impact of personality and individual differences.The\nBeanFest and TI studies indicate that attitude learning within\ncontingent-feedback scenarios is (a) related to the approach\nand avoidance decisions of participants; and (b) influenced\nnot only by the information provided to participants but\nalso by state and trait individual differences (e.g., Conklin\nshowed that priming people to be more promotion or preven-\ntion focused within BeanFest resulted in smaller and larger\nnegative learning asymmetries, respectively. Furthermore,\nShook and Fazio (2009) discovered that political conserva-\ntism related to more avoidant strategies in BeanFest, result-\ning in a stronger learning asymmetry compared with those\nwith a more liberal political ideology.\nThe TI paradigm offers further opportunity to investigate\nhow individual differences might interact with attitude learn-\ning, particularly within less-predictable contexts. Of particu-\nlar interest here could be traits relating to an individual's\ntolerance of uncertainty; for example, low ambiguity toler-\nance (Furnham & Ribchester, 1995), high need for closure\n(Webster & Kruglanski, 1994), and high personal need for\nstructure (Neuberg & Newsom, 1993). These personality\ncharacteristics have been linked to a number of impression\nformation biases (e.g., the correspondence bias and\nerroneous group stereotyping) as people attempt to ascribe\norder to their social world (see also Schaller, Boyd,Yohannes,\n& O'Brien, 1995). Feasibly, the TI paradigm could be uti-\nlized to explore how these characteristics might facilitate or\nimpede attitude learning within variable environments,\nwhich could have implications for our understanding of prej-\nudice formation and transmission.\nIntergroup prejudice.Relatedly, the TI paradigm could\nprovide a better platform for assessing the formation and\nfunction of attitudes toward more socially relevant stimuli\n(e.g., individuals, groups) than BeanFest. The TI theme argu-\nably makes the experimental scenario more social than that\npresented by BeanFest. That is, rather than approaching and\navoiding \"beans,\" participants enter a dynamic intergroup\nsetting where they run the risk of approaching a threaten-\ning group of people (in this case pirates). While variations of\nBeanFest have been utilized to draw inferences about inter-\ngroup processes (e.g., stereotyping; Deutsch & Fazio, 2008),\nwe contend that TI provides a more appropriate conceptual\nplatform for investigating such issues due to the more social\nnature of the exploratory context,.\nFuture research could, for instance, focus on how preju-\ndice reduction strategies might affect the formation, mainte-\nnance, and transmission of the negative learning and\ngeneralization asymmetries common to this research (see\nPaluck & Green, 2009). One might anticipate that strategies\npromoting greater openness to interactions with outgroups\n(e.g., imagined contact; Crisp & Turner, 2009) could serve to\nincrease sampling behavior, thus reducing the size of these\nasymmetries.\nConclusion\nThe aim of these studies was to advance understanding of\nattitude formation processes via direct personal experience\nwithin ostensibly risky environments through the develop-\nment and testing of a new computer-based paradigm based\non BeanFest (i.e., TI). The findings of Study 1 support the\npioneering research achieved using the BeanFest paradigm,\nillustrating how an apparent failure to correct for false-nega-\ntive beliefs results in the emergence of negative learning\nasymmetry. However, it would appear that provision of an\nopportunity to visually landmark decisions attenuates the\nsize of this asymmetry and limits the extent of generalization\nfrom learning experiences. Meanwhile, the results of Study 2\nindicate how a verbal manipulation of risk predictability can\nserve to disrupt sampling behavior and recall in the task.\nTaken together the findings of this research would appear\nto confirm the robust nature of the negative learning asym-\nmetry in contingent-learning settings but simultaneously\nargue that care should be taken when seeking to generalizing\nthe findings of BeanFest studies to ostensibly more variable\ncontexts and/or those where participants can more easily\nlandmark their decisions. This is an important finding being\nthat real-world environments are perceptively (and often\nactually) (a) more changeable than BeanFest asserts; and (b)\noften offer more opportunity for people to reference their\ndecisions than is provided in the BeanFest paradigm. We\nhope that TI will be further utilized and developed to further\nadvance research in this presently under-investigated field of\nattitude research.\n"
