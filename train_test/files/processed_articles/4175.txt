Epistemological positive emotions (amusement, relief, awe, and interest) are\nfound to have distinct, recognisable displays via vocal or facial cues, while the agency-approach positive emotions (elation and\npride) appear to be associated with recognisable visual, but not auditory, cues. Evidence is less strong for the prosocial emotions\n(love, compassion, gratitude, and admiration) in any modality other than touch, and there is little support for distinct recognisable\nsignals of the savouring positive emotions (contentment, sensory pleasure, and desire). In closing, some limitations of extant work\nare noted and some proposals for future research are outlined.\n",
    "reduced_content": "Emotion Review\njournals.sagepub.com/home/er\nA central strand of contemporary research on emotions is the\nstudy of nonverbal expressions. To date, most studies of emo-\ntional communication treat positive emotion as a unitary cate-\ngory, that is, \"joy\" or \"happiness.\" However, in recent years\nresearchers are increasingly examining expressions of a range\nof diverse positive emotional states. This article provides an\noverview of that work, focusing on the study of adults (for a\nrecent developmental review, see Sauter, McDonald, Gangi, &\nMessinger, 2014). This review is structured using an emotion\nfamily approach, organising the research on nonverbal signals\nof positive emotions into epistemological, prosocial, savour-\ning, and agency-approach positive emotions. Epistemological\nemotions entail a change in one's knowledge state, prosocial\nemotions emphasise a focus on others' wellbeing, savouring\nemotions relate to enjoying physiologically pleasurable stim-\nuli, and agency-approach emotions involve a tendency to\napproach potentially rewarding stimuli. In the final section,\ngeneral conclusions and limitations are noted and some propos-\nals for future research are outlined. In order to provide an over-\nview, Table 1 provides a summary of the nonverbal facial,\nvocal, and bodily cues that have been found to occur in the\ncommunication of each of the 13 positive emotions reviewed in\nthe current article. Table 2 gives a summary of studies that have\nexamined nonverbal communication of specific positive emo-\ntions, with information about the channel of communication\nexamined, whether the focus was on perception, production, or\nboth, as well as the cultures included.\nMapping Emotions to Expressions\nOne feature of the investigation of nonverbal expressions of\nemotions is the use of objective cues like acoustic information\nand analyses of facial and bodily muscle movements. In map-\nping emotional states onto physical cues, researchers attempt to\nestablish links between emotion and behaviour without relying\non subjective self-report as a primary measure. Emotions are\ntypically either inferred from antecedent events or known\nin advance when expressions are posed. A complementary\napproach to measuring objective cues employs perceptual\nmeasures such as ratings or classification tasks, to establish how\nperceivers judge others' emotional expressions. The majority of\nstudies to date have examined the perception, rather than pro-\nduction, of emotional expressions. The logic is that perceivers\ncan only consistently map an emotional state to an observed\nnonverbal expression if there is a link between an emotional\nstate and that expression in the expresser.

(Continued)\nemphasised the probabilistic nature of these associations (see\ngers occur would the link to behaviour (including nonverbal\nexpressions) be rigid (Ekman, 2007). For example, experienc-\ning a sudden loss of physical support would be linked to fear\nbehaviours, and tasting a strong bitter flavour would elicit dis-\ngust behaviours. For positive emotions, unlearned triggers may\ninclude gentle touch and sweet tastes. The probability of a fixed\nassociation between subjective state and nonverbal behaviour is\nthought to depend on the prototypicality of the antecedent event,\nand relatedly, on the intensity of the emotional experience\n(Scarantino, 2015). Importantly for the current discussion, how-\never, a claim of an association between a nonverbal behaviour\nand a subjective emotional state does not depend on a perfect\none-to-one mapping between the two.\nEmotion Families\nHow best to conceptualise the structure of human emotions is an\nissue on which views range widely. Nevertheless, most theorists\nwould agree that each emotional state is not equally similar to\nall other emotional states. One way to operationalise these simi-\nlarities is the notion of \"emotion families\" proposed by Ekman\n(1992), that is, groups of emotional states sharing common\ncharacteristics. Such clustering could be done on the basis of\nfeatures such as antecedent events, nonverbal expressions, or\npatterns of appraisals or action tendencies.\nMost research to date has presumably examined only a sin-\ngle positive emotion (\"happiness\") because all positive emo-\ntions have been considered part of a single emotion family, as\npositive emotions are all characterised by positive valence.\nSome accounts have posited shared mechanisms of positive\nemotions, such as facilitating approach (Davidson & Irwin,\n1999) or increasing one's repertoire of thoughts and actions\n(Fredrickson, 1998). An alternative possibility is that positive\nemotion space is comprised of multiple emotion families that\nshare additional characteristics. An analysis of the English emo-\ntion lexicon has lent support to this kind of structure: words\ncluster together around multiple positive emotional concepts\n(Shaver, Schwartz, Kirson, & O'Connor, 1987), and there is\nsome preliminary evidence suggesting that nonverbal behav-\niours may also cluster into conceptually meaningful positive\nemotion families (App, McIntosh, Reed, & Hertenstein, 2011;\nSimon-Thomas, Keltner, Sauter, Sinicropi-Yao, & Abramson,\n2009). Building on this work, the current review is organised in\nsections of possible families of positive emotions (Simon-\nThomas et al., 2009), discussing nonverbal expressions of epis-\ntemological, prosocial, savouring, and agency-approach\npositive emotions in turn. However, given the scarcity of\nproposed classifications of positive emotions, this division is\nnecessarily preliminary. This is true both in terms of whether\nspecific emotion categories are best classified into one or the\nother superordinate category, and in terms of whether this struc-\nture is useful for establishing commonalities across subsets of\npositive emotions. In addition to providing an overview of\nextant research, one aim of the current review is to evaluate\nwhether this proposed classification fits the available evidence\non nonverbal communication of emotions.\nEpistemological Positive Emotions\nSome positive emotional states involve a change in the indi-\nvidual's understanding of, or knowledge about, the world.\nThese emotions can be considered epistemological positive\nemotions. They can, for example, involve the seeking out of\nnew information (i.e., interest), or the realisation that an\nexpected negative event will not occur (i.e., relief). The new\ninformation need not in itself be positive, but the change in\nknowledge results in a positive emotional state. The episte-\nmological positive emotions include interest, relief, amuse-\nment, and awe.\nAmusement\nAmusement, the feeling of finding something funny, is a posi-\ntive subjective state that can result from a resolution of incon-\ngruity (Carroll, 2013). In recent years, the nonverbal behaviour\nof amusement has been the focus of a considerable body of\nresearch, both in studies examining auditory and visual com-\nmunication. This research has primarily examined laughter, a\nvocal and facial suite of behaviours associated with amusement\n(for reviews on laughter see Owren & Amoss, 2014; Ruch &\nEkman, 2001). Experimental work has established that amuse-\nment induction (e.g., funny movies) reliably induces laughter\n(e.g., Ruch, 1995), though most research has focused on whether\nobservers infer amusement from others' laughter. In a recent\nstudy using a multimodal corpus of emotional expressions,\namusement was found to be the best recognised of all 12 emo-\ntions studied across modalities (B\u00e4nziger, Mortillaro, & Scherer,\n2012). The demonstration by B\u00e4nziger and colleagues that\nlaughter can be recognised from visual cues alone extends ear-\nlier findings that have described the facial movements associ-\nated with amusement without directly linking production and\nperception. Several studies have noted that amusement is linked\nto Duchenne smiles, that is, smiles co-occurring with raised\ncheeks (Campos, Shiota, Keltner, Gonzaga, & Goetz, 2013;\nHess, Beaupr\u00e9, & Cheung, 2002; Shiota, Campos, & Keltner,\n2003). In particular, spontaneous amusement has been linked to\nintense smiles with open jaws, and perceivers also judge smiles\nwith those characteristics as expressing amusement (Ambadar,\nCohn, & Reed, 2009). Notably, this configuration of cues has\nbeen found to communicate amusement across several cultures\nA small body of research has examined full-body cues\nassociated with emotions, with recent findings suggesting\nthat bodily cues can under some conditions convey affective\ninformation more clearly than facial expressions (Aviezer,\nTrope, & Todorov, 2012). Data is lacking for most positive\nemotions, but a recent study examined the bodily configuration\nassociated with amusement as well as a few additional positive\nemotions (Dael, Mortillaro, & Scherer, 2012). Employing dis-\ncriminant analyses of body movements, configurations of\nmovements expressing amusement were accurately classified,\nand evidence for a prototypical response pattern was estab-\nlished. Specifically, discontinuous touching and a straight\nhead position was found to be characteristic of amusement,\nand the authors suggested that this likely reflects a laughter\nresponse pattern involving the entire body.\nLaughter has also been found to communicate amusement\nvia auditory perception alone (see Owren & Amoss, 2014, for a\nreview) via both nonverbal vocalisations and speech inflection\n(e.g., Cowie & Cornelius, 2003; Sauter, Eisner, Calder, & Scott,\nsistent across cultures (Cordaro, Keltner, Tshering, Wangchuk,\nclearly communicated using either visual or auditory cues of\nlaughter across cultures. Laughter has been linked to emo-\ntional states other than amusement, including schadenfreude\n(Szameitat et al., 2009), and is part of the response to the tactile\nstimulation of being tickled, which may or may not be accom-\npanied by an emotional state (see Harris & Alvarado, 2005).\nNevertheless, the link between the emotional state of amuse-\nment and nonverbal signals of laughter appears to be robust\nacross modalities and cultural groups.\nAwe\nThere is growing interest from emotion researchers in awe, the\nfeeling of being in the presence of something greater than one-\nis often elicited by views of nature, has been suggested to\ninvolve a need for cognitive accommodation, that is, the adjust-\nment of one's ideas of what is possible in the world (Keltner &\nHaidt, 2002). However, only a few studies have investigated the\nnonverbal communication of awe, though there has been con-\nsiderable consistency across those studies. Examinations of\nfacial expressions of awe have shown that smiling rarely occurs,\nbut rather, awe is associated with head movements forward and\nup, widened eyes, an open mouth with a slightly dropped jaw,\nand raised inner eyebrows (Campos et al., 2013; Shiota et al.,\n2003). These facial changes may in part facilitate the hypothe-\nsised function of awe, that is, the enhanced processing of infor-\nmation to aid the cognitive accommodation sought during\nexperiences of awe. However, no study to date has examined the\nrecognition of facial signals of awe, though one study has found\nhigh levels of recognition across two cultural groups for Indian\ndance segments expressing the closely related state wonder\nParticipants posing awe expressions also frequently pro-\nduced visible inhalations (Shiota et al., 2003), and awe has\nalso been associated with voiced exhalations (Simon-Thomas\nSauter The Nonverbal Communication of Positive Emotions 227\net al., 2009). Such prototypical vocal awe displays are well\nrecognised by naive listeners (Simon-Thomas et al., 2009).\nThis suggests that awe is reliably communicated via auditory\nsignals, in addition to having a consistent configuration of\nfacial cues. It is also worth noting that awe has been linked to\ngoosebumps, which have been posited to serve a signalling\nfunction for profound positive experiences (Maruskin,\nThrash, & Elliot, 2012); that positive emotion can be inferred\nfrom perceiving goosebumps may be an interesting hypothe-\nsis for further study.\nInterest\nInterest, the feeling of wanting to learn more about something,\nfunctions to motivate exploration and has been proposed to be a\nprimary affect (Tomkins, 1995). However, results on the non-\nverbal communication of interest are conflicting. For example,\ninterest being associated with an open mouth (Mortillaro, Mehu,\n& Scherer, 2011) is contradicted by results linking interest to lip\npresses (Campos et al., 2013). Furthermore, in B\u00e4nziger et al.'s\n(2012) multimodal study, interest was overall the worst recog-\nnised positive emotion out of the six included in the study, with\nspeech intonation even less well recognised than facial displays.\nThis contrasts with earlier findings that have found high levels\nof recognition for interested speech prosody, characterised by\nfast rate of speech and a great vocal frequency range (Banse &\nScherer, 1996). There is more consistency in the results of stud-\nies of nonverbal vocalisations, with exclamations of interest\nrecognisable (Simon-Thomas et al., 2009) even across cultural\nIn terms of full body movements, interest is characterised by\nfacing straight ahead and leaning forward, likely linked to the\nmotivation to approach associated with interest (Dael et al.,\nration is not unique to interest and expressions are sometimes\nmisclassified as pride.\nIt has been suggested that awe and interest may be best\nexplained as variations of a single emotion, as both involve\nsome degree of cognitive accommodation, though interest is\nthought to be less intense (Campos et al., 2013). However, the\nonly recognition study to date to include both awe and interest\nfound low rates of confusion between the two for nonverbal\nvocalisations (Simon-Thomas et al., 2009). Could it be that\nthere is more overlap between the facial than vocal configura-\ntions of awe and interest? Facial expressions of interest, like\nthose of awe, do not typically involve smiling, but rather an\neye configuration often seen in awe with wide open eyes stands\nin contrast to the mild squinting or eye closure associated with\nsome differentiation, but at present, it is not known whether per-\nceivers can differentiate between facial expressions of awe and\ninterest. In sum, there is evidence for recognisable nonverbal\nvocalisations of interest, but evidence on facial expressions is\nless clear-cut, in particular with regard to the relationship\nbetween awe and interest configurations.\nRelief\nRelief is a positive emotional experience that occurs when an\nunpleasant emotional experience ceases. If the unpleasant expe-\nrience is ongoing, relief is elicited when it ends, or upon learn-\ning that it will end sooner than expected. If the negative\nexperience is anticipated to occur in the future, relief results\nfrom finding out that the negative experience will not occur.\nRelief can also be the result of a negative experience being less\nbad than had been expected. Multiple studies of nonverbal\nvocalisations have established that relief can be very reliably\ninferred from sighs. For example, Schr\u00f6der (2003) found that\nrelief was recognised at near-ceiling levels by listeners. This\nfinding has since been replicated (Sauter, Eisner, Calder, et al.,\nrelief elicits sighs across cultures (Laukka et al., 2013; Sauter,\nRelief can also be recognised from visual cues alone\n(B\u00e4nziger et al., 2012), though no work has yet tested whether\nvisual cues of relief are consistent across cultures. Facially, pro-\ntotypical relief expressions are characterised by a low-intensity\nsmile, preceded by mouth opening, eye closure, and the head\nmoving up (Krumhuber & Scherer, 2011). In terms of global\nbody movements, only one study to date has included relief\n(Dael et al., 2012). A statistical classifier could accurately clas-\nsify relief expressions and differentiate them from other (posi-\ntive) emotions, but the only distinguishing feature of the relief\nexpressions was that of retiring one's hands in one's pockets.\nSummary: Epistemological Positive Emotions\nTo summarise, there is clear support that all of the epistemo-\nlogical positive emotions examined to date (amusement, relief,\nawe, and interest) have distinct, recognisable displays via\nvocal or facial cues. These, together with pride (see section\nbelow) arguably constitute the strongest candidates for posi-\ntive emotions associated with specific, identifiable nonverbal\nexpressions.\nProsocial Positive Emotions\nPositive emotions can serve the function of orienting people\ntowards the welfare of others and to foster profound social rela-\ntionships. It has been argued that increased concern for others is\na central aspect of many positive emotions, though it is particu-\nlarly pronounced for certain emotions (Keltner, 2009). The\nprosocial positive emotions include love, compassion (some-\ntimes called sympathy), gratitude, and admiration. These emo-\ntions stand in contrast to positive emotions that enhance the\nindividual experiencing the emotion, such as pride.\nLove\nA consensus definition of love is lacking in the literature, and\nboth whether it is an emotion and whether it is positive have\nbeen questioned (Lamy, 2016). Nevertheless, love is typically\nconceptualised as a positive emotion that stimulates com-\nmitment to intimate relationships (Campos et al., 2013).\nNonverbal signals of love may reward prosocial behaviour\nand signal prosocial intent (Hertenstein, Keltner, App, Bulleit,\nSeveral studies have established an association between bod-\nily movements and love. One study examined couples in roman-\ntic relationships as they interacted with each other in a series of\nsemistructured discussions. Self-reported feelings of love cor-\nrelated with head nods, Duchenne smiles, and forward leans\n(Gonzaga, Keltner, Londahl, & Smith, 2001). Consistent with\nthese results, a study examining posed expressions found that\nlove was associated with Duchenne smiles, mutual gaze, affili-\native hand gestures, open posture, and forward leans (Campos\net al., 2013). It is notable that these studies have highlighted\nmovements beyond the face, such as postural shifts and hand\ngestures. However, love may in fact be preferentially communi-\ncated via a completely different type of signal, namely touch\n(App et al., 2011). App and colleagues found that, when given\nan unrestricted choice of expression modality between touch,\nface, or body, touch was preferred to bodily or facial cues\nfor expressing love, and signals of love were identified more\naccurately from observed touch than from facial or bodily\nmovement. This corroborates studies showing that love can be\nreliably communicated from touch, typically using hugging or\nstroking movements (Hertenstein, Holmes, McCullough, &\nKeltner, 2009), in both North American and Spanish partici-\nIn contrast, the evidence that love can be communicated via\nvocal signals is less strong. A meta-analysis of vocal communi-\ncation of emotion grouped positive emotions into \"happiness\"\nand \"love-tenderness\" (Juslin & Laukka, 2003). Speech\ninflected with love was characterised by slow speech rate, low\nvoice intensity, low pitch level, and little pitch variability, but\nhad the lowest decoding levels of all the emotions examined.\nThis aligns with findings from the communication of emotions\nvia nonverbal vocalisations, where only modest recognition\nrates have been found for vocalisations of love (affection), both\nwithin and across cultures (Laukka et al., 2013). The authors\nconcluded that love may lack a distinct type of vocalisation.\nFurthermore, affection vocalisations were commonly confused\nwith interest, an epistemological rather than prosocial emotion.\nFrequent misclassifications of speech intonation pattern of ten-\nderness have also been found in a study with a statistical classi-\nfier model using acoustic information (Hammerschmidt &\nJ\u00fcrgens, 2007). Speech expressing tenderness was specifically\nmisclassified as expressing sensual satisfaction, which could be\nconsidered a savouring positive emotion. Thus, there is evi-\ndence that love is communicated via touch and full-body move-\nment, but it does not appear to be associated with unique, clearly\nrecognisable vocal cues.\nCompassion\nCompassion, sometimes referred to as sympathy, is a desire to\nhelp in response to perceiving another's suffering (see Stellar\net al., 2017). It is differentiated from empathy, which is the\nvicarious experiencing of another's suffering, because feeling\ncompassion does not necessarily involve suffering and theorists\nhave conceptualised it as a positive emotional experience\n(Goetz, Keltner, & Simon-Thomas, 2010). Several studies have\nshown that compassion is marked by some facial features of\nsadness, combined with approach behaviours such as forward\ndiffers from facial displays of love because of the absence of\nsmiling, and differs from sadness due to the signals of approach\nin compassion. However, visual expressions of compassion are\npoorly recognised and often mistaken for sadness (e.g., Haidt &\nConsistent with the pattern of results for visual displays, the\nstudy of vocal expressions has found low levels of accuracy for\nrecognition of nonverbal vocalisations of compassion (Simon-\nThomas et al., 2009). An analysis of classification errors\nrevealed that love and gratitude vocalisations were often identi-\nfied as expressions of compassion, suggesting that vocalisations\nof all of those emotions may be used to communicate a general\nprosocial state of affiliation.\nThe strongest evidence for signals of compassion comes\nfrom the study of touch, with patting and stroking movements\nrecognised as expressions of compassion across two cultural\ngroups (Hertenstein et al., 2006). This is supported by a direct\ncomparison across channels of communication, where partici-\npants favoured touch over face and body for expressing com-\npassion (App et al., 2011). Naive participants were also more\naccurate in identifying compassion from observed touch as\ncompared to facial and bodily displays, and in line with findings\nfrom studies of recognition from vocal cues, errors classifying\ntouch tended to occur between compassion and love. In sum,\nevidence for a distinct, recognisable display of compassion\nfrom visual or auditory cues is weak, but rather, compassion\nappears to be preferentially signalled via touch.\nGratitude\nGratitude is what we feel when someone lends us a helping\nhand. It has been conceptualised as a positive emotional state\ncaused by appreciating benefits perceived to be intentionally\nbestowed upon oneself, and it is thought to be important for\npromoting social relationships (Algoe & Haidt, 2009; see also\nmarked by behavioural tendencies, such as reciprocating\n(Algoe & Haidt, 2009), little research has examined nonverbal\nexpressions of this prosocial emotion and results to date are\nweak.\nGratitude has been found to lack a reliable visual expressive\ndisplay (Campos et al., 2013) and to be poorly recognised\nfrom nonverbal vocalisations (Simon-Thomas et al., 2009). In\ncontrast, touch has been shown to communicate gratitude\nfrequent way to express gratitude was a handshake, suggesting\na conventionalised signal that may not generalise beyond par-\nticular cultural groups.\nSauter The Nonverbal Communication of Positive Emotions 229\nAdmiration\nThe experience of admiration is triggered by the perception of\nanother's extraordinary achievement (Algoe & Haidt, 2009).\nWe may feel admiration when learning of someone having a\nbrilliant insight, or when experiencing an exceptional artistic\naccomplishment, such as a virtuoso musical performance.\nSaid achievement should be outside of the moral domain, as\nwitnessing moral virtue triggers elevation (Algoe & Haidt,\n2009), which has not yet been studied in the context of nonver-\nbal communication. Admiration is a positive emotion that has\nreceived little attention from researchers of nonverbal com-\nmunication, and the available evidence holds only limited\npromise for the notion that admiration may be signalled via\nnonverbal expressions.\nIn a study of nonverbal vocalisations, Schr\u00f6der (2003) found\nthat recognition levels were nearly at ceiling for expressions of\nadmiration. However, this was also the case when only segmen-\ntal information was provided (i.e., transcriptions such as\n\"wow\"), suggesting that these exclamations may be conven-\ntionalised emblems, rather than fully nonverbal vocalisations\nlike sighs and screams.\nIn a more recent study by B\u00e4nziger et al. (2012), moderate\nlevels of recognition were found from both visual and auditory\nsignals of admiration when presented alone, but there was a\nmarked advantage for audiovisual presentation. This may sug-\ngest that there is relatively little redundancy in expressions of\nadmiration, such that visual and auditory cues complement each\nother. Notably, expressions of admiration were frequently mis-\ntaken for surprise, which likely reflects the conceptual overlap\nbetween these two emotions, as both involve an unexpected\nSummary: Prosocial Positive Emotions\nCurrent evidence indicates that the prosocial emotions (love,\ncompassion, gratitude, and admiration) are not reliably commu-\nnicated in any modality other than touch. This is clear support\nfor the proposal that the most effective mode of communication\nof an emotion may depend in part on the emotion's social func-\ntion (App et al., 2011), with prosocial emotions playing a par-\nticularly important role in intimate social relationships.\nSavouring positive emotions\nAn obvious way that positive emotions are triggered is from\nthinking about or experiencing enjoyable stimuli such as food or\nsex. Such savouring positive emotions include contentment,\nsensory pleasure, and sexual desire. The roots of savouring\nemotions are likely linked to unconditioned stimuli like food\nand touch, that fulfil basic needs.\nContentment\nContentment has been defined as an emotion accompanying\nsatisfaction of one's basic needs. Sometimes called satisfaction,\nit is the feeling of enjoying a quiet rest after completing\na good day's work. The central appraisal features that charac-\nterise contentment do not differentiate it well from other\npositive emotions (Campos et al., 2013). Conflation between\ncontentment and other positive emotional states has also been\nfound in the study of vocal signals. Specifically, nonverbal\nvocalisations of contentment were often confused with (sen-\nsual) pleasure across several studies (Sauter, Eisner, Calder,\ncues of contentment are specific to that emotion; posed dis-\nplays have been shown to primarily feature smiling (Campos\net al., 2013). Specifically, Duchenne smiles and smiles with\nthe lips pressed together occurred frequently in expressions\nof contentment, but given the ubiquity of smiling in positive\nemotions it remains to be established whether facial expres-\nsions of contentment can be recognised.\nSensory Pleasure\nSensory pleasure is the enjoyment of a physical stimulus, such\nas food or sex. Sensory pleasure can be elicited from uncondi-\ntional stimuli such as pleasant touch, but also through learned\nassociations. For example, one can experience pleasure from\ntasting flavours that are at first exposure not typically judged to\nbe pleasant (e.g., coffee, wine). Although pleasure has been\nincluded in a number of studies of nonverbal behaviour, results\nto date do not clearly point to a unique, recognisable signal for\nthis emotional state.\nAs noted, vocal signals of pleasure are frequently confused\nwith contentment (e.g., Sauter & Scott, 2007), and though rec-\nognition rates for pleasure are relatively high within culture,\nthey appear to be culturally variable (Sauter, Eisner, Ekman,\net al., 2010). However, given that posed expressions of pleasure\nare perceived as inauthentic (B\u00e4nziger et al., 2012), it remains to\nbe tested whether genuine-sounding vocalisations of pleasure\nare shared across cultural boundaries.\nIn terms of bodily movements, pleasure has been found to be\nassociated with a prototypical response pattern consisting of\ntilting the head upwards and away, accompanied by asymmetri-\ncal arm movements (Dael et al., 2012). However, no study to\ndate has examined whether observers can infer pleasure from\nothers' bodily movements.\nExamining facial cues of positive emotions, Ricci-Bitti,\nCaterina, and Garotti (1996) described the facial changes asso-\nciated with pleasure as closed eyes in combination with a\nDuchenne smile. This was corroborated by a more recent study\n(Mortillaro et al., 2011), which found that facial expressions of\npleasure were characterised by smiling, eye closure, and mouth\nopening. Complementing this work, there is some evidence sug-\ngesting that perceivers can recognise pleasure from facial cues.\nHowever, this seems to be the case primarily for pleasure\nexpressions of high intensity (Wehrle, Kaiser, Schmidt, &\nScherer, 2000) and for audiovisual displays (B\u00e4nziger et al.,\n2012). It is worth noting that confusion patterns for pleasure\nexpressions are highly variable; they have been interpreted\nprimarily as love/tenderness (B\u00e4nziger et al., 2012), interest\nvariation in emotion stimuli used in these studies renders these\ninconsistencies difficult to interpret, and highlight the need for\nconsistency in studies in this area. One contributing factor, how-\never, may be that the emotion most closely related to pleasure,\nat least for facial expressions, is not another positive emotion,\nbut rather pain. Detailed analysis of facial movements during\npleasure and pain have supported the notion that there is overlap\nbetween the facial configurations of these two states (Fernandez-\nDols, Carrera, & Crivelli, 2011), though observers are able to\ndistinguish these expressions at greater than chance levels in the\nabsence of contextual cues (Hughes & Nicholson, 2008).\nHowever, the studies examining overlap in facial expressions\nbetween pleasure and pain have specifically focused on sexual\npleasure; sexual enjoyment may differ from other forms of sen-\nsory pleasure, both in terms of facial configurations and on\nother features, such as action tendencies.\nSexual Desire\nDesire is a state that leads a person to seek out opportunities for\nsexual activity (Gonzaga, Turner, Keltner, Campos, & Altemus,\n2006). It differs from sensory pleasure, which may also contain\na sexual element, in that the contact has not yet occurred. Only\na few studies have examined the nonverbal expressions of sex-\nual desire.\nJust a single study to date has examined the visual cues of\ndesire (Gonzaga et al., 2006). It showed that self-reported feelings\nof desire in a semistructured interaction correlated with lip licks,\nbites, and puckering during interactions with a romantic, sexual\npartner. These sexual displays were also correlated with the part-\nner's self-reported sexual desire, but whether these displays are\nexplicitly recognised as signalling desire has not yet been tested.\nEvidence on vocal signals of desire is mixed. One study\nfound that nonverbal vocalisations of desire were poorly recog-\nnised, with errors distributed across many other response alter-\nnatives, possibly due to large variability among the desire\nexpressions (Simon-Thomas et al., 2009). In contrast, Laukka\net al. (2013) found that lust was one of the best recognised\nvocalisation types of the nine positive emotions in their study.\nRecognition levels were however still moderate, because sounds\nwere frequently conflated with relief, serenity, and positive sur-\nprise. It may be that the inconsistency between these studies can\nbe accounted for by differences between desire and lust, but it\ncannot currently be concluded that desire is associated with a\nnonverbal signal in any modality.\nSummary: Savouring Positive Emotions\nThere is currently little support for distinct recognisable signals\nof the savouring positive emotions (contentment, sensory pleas-\nure, and desire). The overlap between them in terms of confu-\nsion errors may be an indication that these do not constitute\nstates with distinct signals; the extent to which other criteria do\ndifferentiate these emotional states will be a worthwhile ques-\ntion for future research.\nAgency-Approach Positive Emotions\nThough not all positive emotions facilitate approach towards\nreward-related actions (e.g., Gable & Harmon-Jones, 2008),\nsome, including elation and pride, are characterised by approach\ntendencies. These emotions are more individual than many of\nthe other positive emotions, that is, they do not primarily involve\na positive interaction with another person: they may not require\nthe involvement of a social partner at all (i.e., elation) or they\nmay involve others only for social comparison (i.e., pride).\nElation\nElation is a highly aroused positive emotional state caused by an\nunexpected positive event (Mortillaro et al., 2011), such as win-\nning the lottery. Closely related states are enthusiasm, triumph,\nand excitement; these are discussed together here as there is cur-\nrently little theoretical differentiation made between these\nstates. Elation is however differentiated from joy (sometimes\ncalled happiness), which typically refers to a positive emotional\nstate in a more general sense. Elation is distinct from joy both in\nterms of the specificity of the target state, and in terms of levels\nof arousal, since elation is characterised by particularly high\narousal.\nIn a study of emotional speech prosody comparing segments\ndiffering in arousal, most emotion pairs (e.g., panic and anxiety)\nwere found to frequently be confused (Banse & Scherer, 1996).\nHowever, elation and joy were rarely mistaken for each other,\nsuggesting that they may have distinct prosodic contours,\nalthough recognition levels for both were moderate.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that nonverbal vocalisa-\ntions of enthusiasm and triumph are not well recognised, and it\nhas been suggested that this emotional state may lack a clear\nvocal nonverbal signature (Schr\u00f6der, 2003). Consistent with\nthis notion, B\u00e4nziger et al. (2012) found that vocal signals of\nelated joy were poorly recognised, and frequently confused with\namusement. Simon-Thomas et al. (2009) found that elation in\nthe form of triumph was poorly recognised from nonverbal\nvocalisations, while enthusiasm was recognised with moderate\nlevels of accuracy. Notably, enthusiasm and triumph were fre-\nquently mistaken for each other, underscoring the overlap\nbetween these two states.\nFacial expressions of elation are marked by smiles accompa-\nnied by widened eye aperture (Ricci-Bitti et al., 1996) or\nDuchenne smile together with raised eyebrows (Mortillaro\net al., 2011). In terms of recognition, judges can differentiate\nelated facial expressions well from related states such as pleas-\nure and happiness, especially when viewing high-intensity,\ndynamic expressions (Wehrle et al., 2000; see also Fujimura &\nSeveral studies have examined full-body cues associated\nwith elation. Wallbott (1998) found that elation was charac-\nterised by high movement activity and fast and expansive\nmovements (see also de Meijer, 1989, for a similar result).\nSpecifically, the arms were stretched out and the head was\ntilted up and back. A discriminant analysis yielded high levels\nSauter The Nonverbal Communication of Positive Emotions 231\nof accuracy for elevated joy expressions. Consistent with\nthese findings, a more recent study found high accuracy for\nfull-body cues submitted to a discriminant analysis, though\nthe specific movements for elated joy were repetitive vertical\nmovement of the arms and knees (Dael et al., 2012). However,\nrecognition data from full-body cues associated with elated\njoy is currently missing.\nIn sum, elation is linked to reliable patterns of facial and\nbodily movements, but not to a type of nonverbal vocalisation.\nPride\nPride is a positive, self-conscious emotion triggered by the com-\npletion of a goal; it is thought to play a role in enhancing the\nindividual's social status (Tracy & Robins, 2007). We feel proud\nwhen accomplishing a challenging goal, be it academic, ath-\nletic, or personal. Pride is the positive emotion whose nonverbal\ncommunication has been studied most extensively (see Tracy,\nWeidman, Cheng, & Martens, 2014, for a review).\nEvidence for consistent and recognisable visual displays of\npride is strong. Prototypical displays are characterised by a\ncombination of bodily and facial changes, specifically expanded\nposture, a head tilt back, and a small smile (Tracy et al., 2014).\nThis expression is produced spontaneously in pride-eliciting\nsituations and communicates pride also across cultural bounda-\nNotably, facial cues alone are insufficient for perceivers to dif-\nferentiate pride from joy (App et al., 2011; Mortillaro et al.,\nmisclassified as elation when bodily cues of pride are judged in\nthe absence of facial information (Dael et al., 2012; Wallbott,\nIn contrast, several studies have shown that pride is not well\nrecognised from auditory signals, with classification errors dis-\ntributed across both positive and negative emotions (B\u00e4nziger\nTo summarise, pride is communicated via a combination of\npostural and bodily cues, but not from vocalisations or facial\nexpressions alone.\nSummary: Agency-Approach Positive Emotions\nThe findings available to date suggest that agency-approach\npositive emotions (elation and pride) are associated with recog-\nnisable visual, but not auditory, cues. The consistency seen for\nthe emotions in this emotion family may point to positive emo-\ntions characterised by a strong approach motivation being pref-\nerentially communicated via visual signals.\nConclusions, Limitations, and a Look to the\nFuture\nThis article has provided an overview of the literature on the\nnonverbal communication of positive emotions. This research\nprovides support for three main conclusions. Firstly, this\nwork shows that there are a range of expressions that com-\nmunicate positive emotions. The study of a wide range of\nnonverbal cues is crucial, as many emotions are only reliably\ncommunicated via one channel of communication or a combi-\nnation of channels. Secondly, the reviewed results demon-\nstrate that there are a number of positive emotions that are\nassociated with unique, recognisable signals. Specifically, the\nfact that many of the studies reviewed have found evidence of\nrecognition of positive emotions, when examining them in the\ncontext of other positive emotions, attests to the signal clarity\nof these expressions (see Table 2). Thirdly, the available find-\nings indicate that the notion of emotion families may be use-\nful as a way to distinguish between positive emotions, based\non the associated nonverbal behaviour (see Ellsworth &\nSmith, 1988, for evidence based on appraisal profiles). The\nepistemological positive emotions (amusement, relief, awe,\nand interest) have distinct, recognisable displays via vocal or\nfacial cues. The recognisability of these signals suggests that\nthe nonverbal communication of these emotional states may\nbe adaptive in an evolutionary sense. They may, together with\npride, be the most likely candidates for potentially basic posi-\ntive emotions, equivalent to the set of negative emotions that\nare reliably communicated via nonverbal signals (e.g., fear,\ndisgust, anger). The agency-approach positive emotions (ela-\ntion and pride) appear to be associated with recognisable\nvisual, but not auditory, cues. This could indicate that these\nemotions are primarily communicated with others in rela-\ntively close proximity, since auditory cues (e.g., screams)\nmay travel further than visual ones (e.g., eyebrow raising).\nHowever, the relatively conspicuous bodily cues associated\nwith both elation and pride are indicative of signals that could\nbe inferred from others from a distance. Furthermore, there is\nlimited data on the production of vocal cues associated with\nelation and pride; hopefully future studies will explore this\nissue. Evidence is less strong for clear signals of the prosocial\nemotions (love, compassion, gratitude, and admiration) in\nany modality other than touch. This is consistent with previ-\nous findings that have highlighted the preferential communi-\ncation of prosocial emotions via touch and is thought to\nreflect the fact that these emotions primarily occur in intimate\nrelationships (App et al., 2011). Finally, there is little support\nfor distinct recognisable signals of the savouring positive\nemotions (contentment, sensory pleasure, and desire), which\nmay suggest that these emotions are not associated with com-\nmunicative functions, though they may nevertheless serve\nadaptive functions for the individual who is experiencing\nthem.\nThe suggestion of some consistencies in patterns of results\nwithin the proposed emotion families is not intended to\nimply that these categories are necessarily the best possible\nconceptualisation of positive emotion space. Nevertheless,\ncurrent evidence points to possible superordinate classes of\npositive emotions, in addition to underlining the differentia-\ntion between specific positive emotional states. It is also\nworth noting that a number of positive emotions have not\nbeen studied at all yet in the context of nonverbal behaviour;\nfuture work may for example examine the communication of\necstasy, devotion, and hope.\nThese findings overturn some previous assumptions about\nthe nonverbal communication of positive emotions. Specifi-\ncally, all positive emotions were once thought to share a nonver-\nbal signal in the form of a smile (e.g., Ekman, 1992). It is well\nestablished that smiling does not always provide a direct read-\nout of felt enjoyment (e.g., Kraut & Johnston, 1979), but the\nfindings reviewed here go beyond this point to reveal that some\npositive emotions, like interest, are reliably expressed and rec-\nognised by facial cues other than smiling. In addition, some\npositive emotional states are reliably communicated via nonfa-\ncial signals. Smiling may nevertheless provide a signal of gen-\neral positive emotion or prosocial orientation, but the available\ndata suggests that more detailed characterisations of configura-\ntions of cues are likely more informative than using single,\nglobal descriptive categories such as smiling.\nThe present review included only studies with adult par-\nticipants, but it is worth considering how this work connects to\nthe developmental literature (reviewed in Sauter et al., 2014).\nIt is well established that already very early in development,\ninfants are sensitive to nonverbal signals of positive emotion\nfrom others and also that they produce such signals them-\nselves. There is, for example, evidence that infants produce\nlaughter in response to playful physical games. Notably, simi-\nlarities between developmental and adult samples have been\nfound across multiple modalities. Even very young infants\nshow differentiation between different kinds of smiles in both\nperception and production, but little work focusing on early\ndevelopment has included comparisons between multiple\nkinds of positive emotions. Research on emotion perception in\nolder children has in some cases included several positive\nemotions and shown considerable differentiation, but data on\nmany aspects of the development of nonverbal communication\nof specific positive emotions are lacking. Addressing this gap\nin the research literature will be a worthwhile challenge for\nfuture research.\nIt is worth noting some limitations of the extant data, particu-\nlarly as this may inform further research pursuits in this field.\nThere is a great need for more cross-cultural research in the\nstudy of nonverbal communication of positive emotions. With\nthe exception of a handful of studies noted in the relevant sec-\ntions, the displays of most positive emotions have not been\ntested across cultures for any channel of communication. It is\nwell established that cultures vary in their orientations to differ-\nent types of positive affect (Tsai, Knutson, & Fung, 2006), but\nthe extent to which culture shapes emotional signals varies\ngreatly across positive emotions (e.g., Sauter, Eisner, Ekman,\net al., 2010). More research in this area is thus needed, particu-\nlarly given the importance of cross-cultural findings for evolu-\ntionary arguments on emotions.\nA number of studies have demonstrated a communication\nadvantage for multimodal expressions (e.g., B\u00e4nziger et al.,\n2012). The vast majority of studies to date have focused on\nexpressions within a single modality. Research on unimodal\ncommunication can provide a tough test of emotion recognition,\nbut including multimodal expressions will be an important next\nstep to increasing ecological validity. Relatedly, it is an obvious\nlimitation that so much of this research relies on posed emo-\ntional expressions; here the study of positive emotions has an\nadvantage compared to that of negative emotions in that there\nare generally fewer ethical concerns with inducing intense emo-\ntional experiences in the laboratory.\nFinally, there is enormous variability in terms of the meas-\nures, target emotions, and paradigms in the studies conducted to\ndate. Although open exploration is crucial for discovery, hope-\nfully the maturation of this field of research will begin to yield\ngreater convergence on methods and emotions over the coming\nyears.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAlgoe, S.
