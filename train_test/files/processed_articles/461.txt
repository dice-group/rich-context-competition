The overall seroprevalence of\nHAV seroprevalence was higher in Mexican Americans than other ethnic groups, in younger\npersons, and in those who reported previous vaccination compared to those who did not. We\nconcluded that anti-hepatitis A seroprevalence rates are increasing in younger individuals in the\nUSA, indicating a shift of seroprevalence over time due to vaccination status. Findings are\nconsistent with a persistent influx of infection through international travel and migration and\nhighlight the need to discern hepatitis A infection from vaccination status when assessing the\neffectiveness of vaccination using seroprevalence data.\nKey words: Cross-sectional, hepatitis A seroprevalence, prevalence, survey, vaccine.\nINTRODUCTION\nHepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is a common dis-\nease, particularly in children and is endemic in areas\nwith substandard hygiene and sanitation. The virus\naccounts for 25% of all clinically evident acute\nhepatitis and affects 10 million persons annually\nworldwide [1, 2]. Persons affected with the disease\ntypically complain of low appetite and malaise and\npresent with jaundice. Hepatitis A is a self-limiting\ndisease with signs and symptoms lasting for a few\nweeks and is not known to cause chronic hepatitis.\nA previous infection is detected by the presence of\nserum IgG hepatitis A antibody (anti-HAV) which\npersists for years and possibly confers lifelong im-\nmunity against all strains of HAV. Since HAV rarely\ncauses fulminant hepatitis, the fatality rate associated\nwith the infection is extremely low [2].\nOnce common in the USA, HAV infection has\ndeclined significantly in the era of hepatitis A vacci-\nnation [1, 3\u00ad7]. With the introduction of the vaccine in\n1995 and the recommendations by the Advisory\nCommittee on Immunization and Practices (ACIP) to\ntarget the HAV infection-vulnerable population, the\nannual incidence rates of clinical disease started to\ncommended vaccinating children aged o24 months in\nhigh-risk communities; in 1999 ACIP recommended\nThe online version of this article is published within an Open Access environment subject to the conditions of the Creative Commons\nAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike licence <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/>.

The fervour to decrease HAV infection\nby targeting regions endemic for hepatitis A may\nhave afforded herd immunity thus altering disease\nserological testing for anti-HAV that provided\npopulation-based seroprevalence data. We performed\nan analysis of the hepatitis A data made available in\nin order to assess the current determinants of anti-\nHAV seroprevalence in this age group as well as to\nassess epidemiological profile changes 15 years after\nhepatitis A vaccination was started.\nMETHODS\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) provides cross-sectional infor-\nmation on health and nutrition status that can be\ngeneralized to the US civilian non-institutionalized\npopulation. The survey uses a complex, stratified,\nmultistage probability sampling of households and\nobtains data from consenting participants through\nquestionnaires and standardized health examinations.\nHealth examinations include physical and laboratory\ntests conducted in mobile examination centres\nfrom 10149 participants, weighted to represent close\nto 300 million persons in the USA. NHANES over-\nsampled Hispanics, African Americans, participants\naged o60 years, and low-income persons to obtain a\nsample size sufficient for analysis of these demo-\ngraphic categories [13].\nSubjects in this study\nand 19 years were eligible for a qualitative determi-\nnation of total serum hepatitis A antibody (n=3306).\nhad confirmed results, one indeterminate, and 684\n(20.7%) did not have a specimen for analysis [14].\nLaboratory methods and questionnaire\nSolid-phase competitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA)\nwas used to qualitatively determine anti-HAV in serum\nor plasma. The intensity of the yellow-orange colour\nchange generated at the final step of the assay was\nmeasured by a spectrophotometer at 492 nm cut-off.\nA commercial assay kit was used to test for anti-HAV\nAbbott Laboratories, USA). Samples with absor-\nbance f492 nm were considered reactive to anti-\nHAV and labelled positive for the antibody while\nsamples with >492 nm absorbance were labelled\nnegative for anti-HAV. Solid-phase competitive\nEIA does not distinguish seropositivity acquired\nfrom hepatitis A infection or hepatitis A immuniza-\nThe NHANES sample person and family ques-\ntionnaire provided demographic information of the\nparticipants. For the analysis, age was categorized as\ncategorized race/ethnicity as non-Hispanic White,\nnon-Hispanic Black, Hispanic-Mexican American,\nHispanic-Other Hispanic, and Other. In this study,\nrace and anti-HAV status. The category `Other' was\nexcluded from the analysis. Participants indicating\nplace of birth other than USA were considered\nforeign-born. For determination of socio-economic\nstatus, the ratio of family income to the family's ap-\npropriate poverty threshold as measured by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau was used. This variable was catego-\no4.00. If a family's total income is less than the\nfamily's threshold income value, the index is <1 and\nthat family, and every individual in it, are considered\npoor.\nThe participants' hepatitis A vaccination status was\ndetermined using vaccination records and self-report.\nSubjects aged o16 years were interviewed directly.\nA proxy was interviewed for those aged <16 years\nand those unable to answer questions. Vaccination\nstatus was grouped as no vaccination, a single dose, or\ntwo doses of vaccine. Other variables included in the\nanalysis were water source and the year the partici-\npant's home was built. Water source was categorized\n418 E. Velasco-Mondragon, I. Lindong and F. Kamangar\ninto company-provided source and well, or other\nsources.\nStatistical analysis\nPrevalence estimates were weighted to account for the\nmethod of sampling used by NHANES and to ensure\nthat the resulting estimates represent the US popu-\nlation. We used logistic regression to calculate odds\nratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)\nfor hepatitis A vaccination status, adjusted for age,\ngender, race, poverty level, country of birth, and year\nhome was built. All of these variables were included in\nthe multivariate models. Education and family size\nwere also examined in relation to anti-HAV status\nbut they were not associated with the outcome and\ntherefore were not included in the models. Since anti-\nHAV seropositivity may be acquired through either\nvaccination or previous natural infection, we con-\nducted a subgroup analysis for only those who were\nnot vaccinated to assess seropositivity due to natural\ninfection. Results with P<0.05 were considered sig-\nnificant. Stata v. 10 (SVY module) was used to calcu-\nlate prevalence and odds ratios accounting for\nweighting and complex sampling of the survey.\nRESULTS\nBased on the results from the 2621 participants tested\nfor anti-HAV, the overall prevalence of anti-HAV\nantibodies in the US population aged 2\u00ad19 years\n(48.9%) had not been vaccinated. Of the latter,\nHAV and therefore considered to be positive via pre-\nvious HAV infection.\nDemographics\nRace/ethnicity was strongly associated with anti-\nHAV seroprevalence. Seventy-five percent of Mexican\nAmericans, 49% of Other Hispanics, 37% of African\nAmericans, and 28% of Whites were positive for anti-\nHAV. Being Mexican American increased the odds\nfor anti-HAV seroprevalence fivefold that of Whites\ngender, poverty level, year home was built, water\nsource and country of birth (Table 1). In the subgroup\nanalysis representing the non-vaccinated popu-\nlation, the odds for anti-HAV seroprevalence among\nMexican Americans compared to Whites remained\n(Table 2).\nThe prevalence of anti-HAV decreased with age.\nyears had anti-HAV detected in their blood samples.\nCompared to the 2\u00ad4 years group, persons aged 5\u00ad19\nyears had 2\u00ad3 times lower odds of anti-HAV sero-\naged 5\u00ad19 years had lower odds even after removing\nexposure to hepatitis A vaccination; however, the\n95% confidence intervals included the null value\n(Table 2).

Although females, both for the entire\npopulation and the non-vaccinated subpopulation,\nhad lower odds compared to males, this was\nnot statistically significant (all: OR 0.94, 95% CI\nHepatitis A vaccination\nCompared to non-vaccinated persons, those who re-\nported having received one and two doses of hepatitis\nA vaccine had over six and three times greater odds of\ntesting positive, respectively (one dose: OR 6.77, 95%\nreported higher proportions of hepatitis A vacci-\nnation than Whites and African Americans.

Seventy-two percent of Mexican\nAmericans aged 2\u00ad19 years in the USA reported\nhaving received at least one dose of hepatitis A\nvaccination. This result is consistent with previous\nreports showing higher hepatitis A vaccination\ncoverage in Hispanic children [15, 16].

The western region has the highest percentage\nTable 2.

Starting at the 2000 census, the country of origin\nwas specified for Hispanics where Mexican Americans\nrepresented 58.5% of the US Hispanic population\n[18]. The correspondence between geographic distri-\nbution of the Hispanic population and the hepatitis A\nvaccination priority areas explains the higher per-\ncentage of vaccinated Mexican Americans and Other\nHispanics which contributed to the high anti-HAV\nseroprevalence in these groups.\nIn an attempt to examine the seroprevalence at-\ntributable to natural infection, we conducted a sub-\ngroup analysis limited to those who reported not\nhaving received vaccination. In this subgroup analysis\nresults remained largely the same. Mexican Americans\nhad significantly higher odds of anti-HAV sero-\npositivity acquired through previous HAV infection.\nThis finding was consistent with earlier anti-HAV\nprevalence studies conducted prior to the introduc-\ntion of hepatitis A vaccination that reported higher\nseroprevalence in Mexican Americans compared to\nnon-Hispanic participants [9, 16]. Similar results were\nseen in prevalence surveys involving children living\nin Texas along the USA/Mexico border and families\nof migrant farm workers in Florida. The higher\nprevalence of infection in Mexican American and\nHispanic communities may be attributed to greater\nexposure to HAV through higher exposure to HAV\ninfection in these communities or frequent travel\nto HAV-endemic countries in Central and South\nof hepatitis A reported to the San Diego County\nHealth Department in Hispanic children aged f18\nyears linked infection to cross-border travel to\nMexico and its associated foodborne exposure [12, 20].\nIn addition to cross-border travel, other risk factors\nwere identified for schoolchildren living in a USA\u00ad\nMexico border community which include being in\nfirst grade of elementary education, low maternal\neducational attainment, >6 months residence in\nMexico, household crowding, and substandard sani-\ntation system [21]. The same reasons may explain the\nhigh prevalence of HAV infection in non-vaccinated\n2- to 19-year-old Mexican Americans.\nThe results of this study suggest that in the range of\nthis study (2\u00ad19 years) younger individuals were more\nlikely to be seropositive. This is contrary to earlier\nstudies describing hepatitis A epidemiology where\nage was one of the strongest predictors of anti-\nwhere HAV vaccination is not provided, and in the\nUSA prior to vaccination, seropositivity rates would\nDistribution (%)\nAge group (years)\n(\u00ad) anti-HAV/ (\u00ad) HAV Vaccine\n(\u00ad) anti-HAV/ (+) HAV Vaccine\n(+) anti-HAV/ (\u00ad) HAV Vaccine\n(+) anti-HAV/ (+) HAV Vaccine\n422 E.

Our analysis of the most recent\nbution of seropositivity across age groups. This led us\nseroprevalence rates across the younger three age\ngroups in the first survey, decreasing seropositivity\nacross the older three age groups in the second survey\nand decreasing seropositivity across all groups in the\nmost recent survey (NHANES 2008). This trend\ncould be attributed to either higher rates of infection\nin younger children that add to the vaccine sero-\npositivity; to weaning of vaccine effect after a number\nof years, hence leading to lower positivity rates in\nolder children or teenagers who received their vaccine\nmany years before; to use of more effective and\nimmunogenic vaccines for the younger children; or\nto higher vaccination rates in younger children.\nNevertheless, these explanations are unlikely, since\nmost reports indicate that antibodies generated via\nvaccination have a long life [26]; however, some stu-\ndies have quantitatively documented decreasing anti-\nbody levels over time after hepatitis A vaccination\narguing for the need of booster doses [27, 28]. We are\nnot aware of any reports showing that the newer\nvaccines are more immunogenic or effective. To study\nwhether younger children are being vaccinated at\nhigher rates, we conducted a subgroup analysis in\nthose who did not report vaccination. In this sub-\ngroup analysis anti-HAV seropositivity was also\nhigher in younger children which may seem to refute\nthe hypothesis. However, it should be borne in mind\nthat reporting of vaccination is subject to non-differ-\nential misclassification. Therefore, it is still possible\nthat younger children are being vaccinated at higher\nrates and due to misclassification of reporting the re-\nsults show higher rates of seropositivity in those who\ndo not report having received a vaccine. However, a\nsimilar misclassification effect on prevalence would be\nexpected to be seen in earlier surveys, which was not\nthe case.\nHepatitis A vaccination\nHepatitis vaccination was expected to be a strong\npredictor of anti-HAV positivity. Available since\n1995, the hepatitis A vaccine was routinely adminis-\ntered to children living in the West and Southwest\nregions where hepatitis was endemic causing the re-\nversal of disease age distribution; infection rates are\nnow higher in adults particularly in men aged 25\u00ad39\nThe general recommendation in the USA for chil-\ndren is two doses of hepatitis A vaccine administered\nat least 6 months apart [3, 17]; however, the results of\nthis study did not indicate lower seropositivity rates in\nthose who received a single dose of hepatitis vaccine.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes\nthat all hepatitis A vaccination schedules are effi-\ncacious in eliciting sufficient antibody levels for\nprotection against HAV infection and that high anti-\nbody levels are readily achieved by a single dose\n[26]. Further studies are needed to evaluate the pro-\ntection conferred by a single dose of hepatitis A\nvaccination.\nWe found that in each of the three NHANES\nstudies 13\u00ad25% of participants who reported having\nbeen vaccinated for hepatitis A were seronegative,\nwith a larger percentage for older participants (Fig. 1).\nThis result may be attributed largely to misclassifica-\ntion where participants erroneously report receiving\nhepatitis A vaccination. However, if participant re-\nports were accurate for the most part, seronegativity\ndespite hepatitis A vaccination may reflect vaccine\nfailure or a shorter than expected vaccine-conferred\nimmunity. No changes in case definition or in lab-\noratory cut-off values for seropositivy occurred in the\nthree surveys.\nContextual factors\nPoverty encompasses a number of socioeconomic\nstatus indicators such as education, sanitation,\nhousehold characteristics, and income. In this study,\npoverty was not significantly associated with anti-\nHAV seropositivity. On the contrary, members of\nthe wealthiest group (family income to poverty ratio\nof o4.00) have almost the same anti-HAV sero-\nprevalence as the poorer participants (Table 1). This\nincreased risk appears to be inversely related to im-\nmunization since the anti-HAV prevalence in the\nwealthiest subgroup drops from 40% (Table 1) in the\ntotal group to 25% (Table 2) in those denying being\nimmunized. However, the protective effect of family\nincome against seropositivity acquired through natu-\nral infection, although not significant, can be seen in\nnon-vaccinated persons. In developing countries\nHepatitis A seroprevalence in the USA 423\nwhere hepatitis A is endemic, the role of poverty in\nhepatitis A disease transmission is firmly established\n[22\u00ad25]. In the USA, immigration and international\ntravel, as previously discussed, were factors more\nstrongly associated with the spread of communicable\ncountry's accessibility to migrants from developing\nnations and proximity to places where hepatitis A is\nendemic may better explain the geographic and ethnic\ndistribution of the disease than poverty. Although a\nstudy on HAV infection in the USA using NHANES\nIII identified poverty as a significant predictor of\nHAV infection prevalence [16], the confounding in-\ntroduced by the revisions on the policies and re-\ncommendations on hepatitis A vaccination may have\nreduced the ability of poverty to predict sero-\npositivity. The higher odds among foreign-born per-\nsons for seropositivity due to previous infection,\nalthough not statistically significant, alludes to a\nrelatively better public health strategy like access to\npotable water, efficient sewage disposal system, and\nbetter housing among US-born persons. While com-\npany-provided water is the major water source in the\nUSA, the stronger association it had with anti-HAV\nseropositivity than other water sources like wells for\nnon-vaccinated persons, may have been due to chance\nsecondary to a lack of a sufficient sample for analysis.\nThe inclusion of the year participants' homes were\nbuilt was based on the assumption that communities\nwith older homes are more vulnerable to spread of\nhepatitis A due to older sewage systems that may be\npotential sources of contamination. This is particu-\nlarly relevant for participants denying vaccination;\nhowever the results showed that participants living in\nolder homes did not have elevated risks for anti-HAV\nseroprevalence.\nStrengths and limitations\nThis study has several strengths. NHANES is rep-\nresentative of the entire non-institutionalized US\npopulation, and serum samples from over 2600 par-\nticipants were analysed for anti-HAV seropositivity.\nData were available for potential confounders\nand subgroup analyses; however, very low numbers\nof other Hispanic and Mexican Americans limited\nour ability to draw conclusions from the results of\nthe non-vaccinated group. However, this study has\nlimitations too. Most notably vaccination was based\non self-report which may be subject to misclassi-\nfication.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, the results of this study showed that\nMexican Americans, while receiving higher rates of\nvaccination, were still at higher risk of HAV infection\nthan other groups. Therefore racial/ethnic disparities\nwith regard to HAV exist and efforts to expand vac-\ncination, especially to Mexican Americans may be\nneeded. Older children and teenagers were less likely\nto be seropositive against HAV than younger chil-\ndren, which may indicate a higher rate of vaccination\nin younger children, increased infection rates or\ngradual lower levels of antibodies years after vacci-\nnation. All these explanations seem unlikely. In ad-\ndition, herd immunity is unlikely to explain the\nincreased relative HAV prevalence in younger chil-\ndren in NHANES compared to earlier surveys. The\nlatter may need to be investigated and, if needed,\nbooster vaccines may need to be considered. Finally,\nthe reasons why HAV-vaccinated subjects tested\nnegative to anti-HAV need to be further explored.\nNone.\nREFERENCES\n1. Wasley A, Fiore A, Bell BP. Hepatitis A in the era of\n2.
