Using national longitudinal data from the Americans' Changing Lives study, along with census tract\ninformation for each respondent, we conduct multilevel survival analyses. Results show that black older adults are disadvantaged\nin mortality in younger old age, but older black adults have lower mortality risk than whites after about age 80. Both individual SES\nand neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage contribute to the mortality risk of older adults but do not completely explain race\ndifferences in mortality. The racial mortality crossover persists even after controlling for multilevel SES, suggesting that black older\nadults experience selective survival at very old ages. Addressing the individual and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage of\nblacks is necessary to reduce mortality disparities that culminate in older adulthood.\n1. Introduction\nBlack older adults (ages 65+) have higher all-cause mortality\nrates than white older adults in the USA [1, 2]. A growing\nbody of literature attempts to understand the mechanisms\nexplaining these persisting race differences in mortality [3\u00ad5]\nso that we can understand how such race disparities might be\nreduced or eliminated. Substantial disparities in individual\nsocioeconomic status (SES) by race have been observed in\nthe USA, and research has shown that individual SES (e.g.,\nincome and education) partly mediates but does not elim-\ninate the relationship between race and mortality [6\u00ad8]. In\naddition, neighborhood context has been identified as a key\nfactor that contributes to race disparities in morbidity [9\u00ad\n11]. However, few studies have examined how neighborhood\ncontext contributes to race difference in mortality [12, 13],\nparticularly at older ages.\nThe current study employees mixed effect survival\nanalysis to investigate whether SES, measured at both the\nindividual and neighborhood levels, explains black/white\ndifferences in mortality among older adults in the USA, using\nlongitudinal national data.\nA number of theoretical perspectives, including eco-\nnomic deprivation [14] and social disorganization theory\n[15, 16], suggest that neighborhood context is associated\nwith health and mortality. Some studies have shown that\nliving in a poor neighborhood is related to increased cause-\nspecific mortality among adults [17\u00ad20], after controlling\nfor individual SES variables. However, other studies have\nshown that there is no significant association between\nneighborhood context and all-cause mortality for older\nVery few studies have examined the contribution of\nneighborhood socioeconomic context to race disparities\n2  \nin mortality for older adults, although some research\nhas examined this question for younger and middle-aged\nadults. LeClere and colleagues found that the differential\nall-cause mortality rates between African American and\nnon-Hispanic white men and women aged 18 and older\nwere partly explained by individual-level SES and were\nfurther explained by neighborhood context. The differences\nin mortality between the black and white adults were\ncompletely explained by both individual SES and neigh-\nborhood combined [23]. However, some studies indicate\nthat race differences in mortality persist among USA adults\neven after both individual SES and neighborhood context\nare controlled. For example, one study demonstrated that\nmortality for all racial/ethnic groups is related to individual\nSES and to neighborhood characteristics, among people\naged 18\u00ad64. The race difference in mortality persisted after\ncontrolling for both individual and neighborhood level SES\nWith regard to older adults, LeClere and colleagues\nshowed that the percentage of female-headed families in\nthe neighborhood was associated with heart disease mor-\ntality for women aged 65 and above. Individual SES and\nneighborhood context fully accounted for the heart disease\nmortality disparity between white and black older adults\n[12]. The above research provides some knowledge about\nthe relationships among race, multilevel SES, and all-cause\nmortality, but the results are not consistent.\nMoreover, this body of research has not fully considered\nthe shape of the relationship between race and mortality\nat older ages. However, research suggests that there is a\nracial mortality crossover at older ages such that black older\nadults have higher mortality than white older adults in young\nolder ages while white older adults have higher mortality\nthan their black counterparts in very late old age [25\u00ad30].\nIt could be that the racial mortality crossover in late old age\ncontributes to the inconsistent conclusions regarding the role\nof multilevel SES in explaining race difference in mortality\namong older adults. This is because if crossover effects exist,\nthe effect of race on mortality for a younger subgroup will be\npositive while the effect of race will be negative for an older\nage subgroup. Combining age groups together in one \"old\nage\" group ages 65+ may result in the positive and negative\neffects canceling each other out.\nThere are two primary competing explanations for racial\nmortality crossover effects [27]. If black older adults are\nmore likely to misreport their age as older than it really is,\nthis would result in more young black older adults being\ncategorized in the oldest old groups. Alternately, black older\nadults may experience selective mortality. Since black adults\nare more likely to die at younger ages, the black survivors\nat very older age should be very robust. Unfortunately, it is\ndifficult to detect age reporting errors in survey data. In any\ncase, the potential existence of the racial mortality crossover\neffect means that, when studying race differences in mortality\namong older adults, it is necessary to consider the interaction\nof race and age.\nThere have been theoretical debates on the expected\npatterns of race disparities in mortality over the life course.\nThe double jeopardy hypothesis suggests that blacks are\nfaced with a double burden on health with aging and there-\nfore should experience worse health status and mortality\ncompared to whites at older ages [31]. Another perspective\nhypothesizes persistent inequality--that race differences in\nhealth are set at earlier ages and are then relatively stable\nthroughout the aging process [32]. These two perspectives\nsuggest that crossover effects should not exist. A third\nperspective describes a different story in which some factors\nthat affect health at younger ages are not as strongly\nassociated with changes in health at older ages. In particular,\nsocial factors may be less important than biological factors\nat older ages. For example, the research by House et al.\n[33] suggests that the relationship between SES, other risk\nfactors, and health may be buffered by biological robustness\n(in early adulthood), biological frailty (in later old age), or\nthe existence of social welfare programs, particularly at older\nages. This third perspective suggests that the race difference\nwill reduce or even crossover at older ages.\nEmpirical studies provide some support for the third\nperspective and have shown that the health disadvantage\nof blacks not only disappears but crosses over such that\nblack older adults have lower mortality ratios at very old\nhappens, it may obscure the true relationships among\nrace, multilevel SES and mortality among older adults in\ndifferent age groups. Given this consideration, we examine\nthe potential for a race crossover effect in mortality among\nolder adults and reexamine the contribution of multilevel\nSES to mortality and its variation by age among older adults.\nOur study extends prior work in a number of ways.\nThe existing literature has contrary findings on the effects\nof neighborhood context on mortality and the magnitude\nof the effects of neighborhood context on explaining race\ndifferences in mortality among older adults. A number of\nlimitations to prior work may cause this contradiction.\nFirst, as described above, most studies examine all older\nadults combined, rather than examining age-specific changes\namong older adults. Second, most studies examined disease-\nspecific mortality, but it is also important to understand\nhow multilevel SES is associated with all-cause mortality.\nThird, most previous studies used a single indicator or\nseparate indicators of neighborhood context, whereas we\ncombine a number of neighborhood variables to create a\nmore comprehensive neighborhood disadvantage index.\nFourth, our statistical approach represents an improve-\nment on prior work in the USA because we use multilevel\nsurvival analyses to account for the multilevel nature of the\ndata while modeling mortality using the greater precision\nof survival analysis. Most prior work in the USA has\nnot adjusted for the complex survey design effects that\nresult from the multistate sampling method of the data\nor the nested nature of the individual-level data within\nneighborhoods, leading to potentially incorrect variance\nand parameter estimates [36\u00ad38]. Some studies considered\nthe correlated data structure and used multilevel logistic\nregression to estimate the association between multilevel SES\nissues were not addressed leading to potential errors in esti-\nmates. Recently, a few studies employed multilevel survival\n  3\nanalysis, which combines the advantages of mixed effects\nmodel and Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the\neffects of multilevel SES on cause-specific mortality [17\u00ad\n19, 41] and all-cause mortality [42]. However, these studies\nwere based in European countries. We utilize this method\nusing a USA sample.\nIn sum, results regarding the effects of neighborhood\nSES on mortality and its contribution to race differences\nin mortality among older adults are mixed. Some national\nstudies provided evidence that multilevel SES is associated\nwith mortality and contributes to explaining race differences\non the magnitude of their contribution to race differences\nin mortality, particularly at older ages. We build from and\nattempt to improve upon prior work by introducing an\ninteraction between race and age. We also use multilevel\nsurvival models to appropriately estimate the associations\nbetween race, the interaction of race and age, individual SES,\nneighborhood SES, and all-cause mortality over 16 years\namong older adults in a nationally representative sample of\nadults in the USA.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Data. Wave 1 (W1) of the Americans Changing Lives\n(ACL) study was conducted in 1986 through face-to-face\ninterviews in the homes of 3,617 adults. The sample was\ncreated using a multistage, stratified area probability sample\nof noninstitutionalized adults aged 25 and older living in the\n48 contiguous states, with oversamples of black people and\nolder adults. We limit our analysis to the cohort of people\nages 65 and older in order to replicate and extend previous\nanalytic sample used in this study includes respondents aged\n65 or older at W1 (with survivors being aged 81 or older at\nwave 4) who reported their race as white or black, for a final\nNeighborhood variables are taken from the 1990 census\nat the census tract level, based on each individual's residence\nat W1 of the interview.\nData were collected by the University of Michigan using\napproved human subjects protocols. Data analyses were\nconducted with approval by the University of Wisconsin-\nMadison social studies institutional review board.\n2.2. Variables. Education is measured as years of formal\nschooling completed by W1 and is included as a continuous\nvariable. Family income at baseline is included as an\nordinal variable ranging from 1 to 10 (1 = less than $5K;\nabove). Regression-based imputations were made for missing\nincome data.\nFive neighborhood characteristics (% adults aged 25+\nwith 16+ years schooling, % households with public assis-\ntance, % persons aged 65+ below poverty line, % families\nthat are female-headed, and mean family income) are used\nto create a neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage index\n(Neighborhood SDI). After conducting a factor analysis\n(see Table 3), each of the five neighborhood measures was\nstandardized, weighted by its factor loading, and summed (%\nadults aged 25+ with 16+ years schooling and mean family\nincome were reversed) to create the Neighborhood SDI. A\nhigher score means greater neighborhood disadvantage.\nGender is coded 1 for men and 0 for women. Race is a\ndummy variable (Black = 1; White = 0).\nThe dependent variable at each wave is all-cause mor-\ntality. Mortality was tracked over time and was confirmed\nwith the National Death Index (coded to the year of death)\n2.3. Statistical Analysis. Survival analysis is used to examine\npredictors of time until death. The basic Cox proportional\nhazards regression is expressed as [46, 47]\nh(t | Z) = h0(t)exp\n\n\np\nk\nZk\n\nh(t | Z) is the hazard rate at time t for an individual\ncovariates vector Z. h0(t) is an arbitrary baseline hazard\nrate. k is the estimated parameter vector that represents the\ndirection and magnitude of the association between Zk and\nh(t | Z) compared to baseline hazard rate. If we assume\nthat censoring time and event for the jth participants are\nindependent given by Zk, the parameters in (1) could be\nestimated by maximizing the partial likelihood function in\nL  =\nD\nexp p\nk\nZ(i)k\njR(ti)\nexp p\nk\nZjk\n... < TD denote the ordered event times.\nZ(i)k is the kth covariate associated with individual whose\ndeath time is ti. R(ti) represents the kth covariate associated\nwith individuals who are still in the risk set at a time just prior\nto ti. The numerator in (2) represents the information about\ndeath where the denominator includes all information about\nindividuals who have not yet died.\nWhen neighborhood socioeconomic context is included\nin analysis, we model the association between individual sur-\nvival times within neighborhood. There is an unobservable\nrandom effect shared by subjects within a neighborhood.\nIn this case, Cox proportional hazard mixed effects model\none time-invariant neighborhood socioeconomic context\nvariable is included in the analysis. The hazard function for\nthe jth individual in i neighborhood can be expressed as\nhij(t | Z) = h0(t) exp  Zij + bi\nij\nZij is the vector covariate and  is the vector of regression\ncoefficient. ij is a vector of covariates that have random\neffects. This equation captures the random effects of the\ncluster and enables covariate by cluster interactions. Due to\nthe interaction of clustered and individual covariates, ij is a\n4  \nTable 1: Descriptive statistics (unweighted): percentage distribu-\ntion or mean (standard deviation in parentheses) at baseline for\nindependent variables (respondents aged 65 and above at baseline,\nVariables Range Percentages or mean\nNeighborhood SDI\n(standardized)\nNeighborhood SDI: Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage Index.\n2.4. Analytic Strategy. A series of Cox proportional hazard\nmodels will be presented to examine the association between\nrace, multilevel SES, and mortality. Models 1 to 4 in Table 2\nuse Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the\ncontribution of both individual SES and neighborhood SDI\nto race differences in mortality when neighborhood-level\nvariance is ignored. Mixed effect cox analyses are shown\nin Models 1b to 4b in Table 2 in order to examine how\nmultilevel SES explains race disparity in mortality when\nwe consider the neighborhood-level variance. Finally, the\ninteraction between race and age is introduced in Models 5\nto 7 to investigate whether race differences in mortality differ\nby different age groups after multilevel SES is controlled.\n3. Results\nTable 1 presents the descriptive information for the demo-\ngraphic and socioeconomic measures at baseline for 1211\nolder adults aged 65 and above who reported their race as\neither white or black. About one third of participants were\nmale, about 45% were married at baseline, and the average\nage was 73. The mean years of education are about 10. The\nThe effects of individual SES and neighborhood SDI\non mortality are presented in Table 2. Model 1 in Table 2\nshows that black older adults had a higher mortality rate\nof dying (at an earlier age or by the end of the study\nperiod) for black older adults is on average 18% higher\nthan the probability of death for white older adults. When\nonly individual SES measures were added in Model 2, race\ndifferences in mortality disappeared and family income is\nnegatively related to mortality. Model 3 examines the effects\nof neighborhood SDI on mortality. First, we find that neigh-\nborhood SDI is positively associated with mortality. This\nmodel suggests that, if the neighborhood socioeconomic\ndisadvantage index increases by one standard deviation, the\nRace differences in mortality persist after controlling for\nneighborhood SDI. Both individual SES and neighborhood\nSES were included simultaneously in Model 4. Model 4\nindicates that both family income and neighborhood SDI\nare significantly related to mortality. However, there is no\nremaining statistically significant race difference in mortality.\nModels 1b\u00ad4b in Table 2, using mixed effects Cox\nmodel, demonstrate similar results. Both individual SES and\nneighborhood SDI are related to mortality. Race differences\nin mortality are fully mediated by individual SES. Looking at\nModels 2\u00ad4 and 2b\u00ad4b together, we conclude that individual\nSES is stronger than neighborhood SDI in explaining race\ndifferences in mortality.\nThe interaction of race by age was added in Models 5\u00ad7\nin Table 2 in order to investigate whether race disparities in\nmortality vary by age among older adults. Model 5 indicates\nthat there is a significant interaction of race and age, which\nmeans that race differences in mortality are not constant\nacross age for older adults. The positive coefficients for race\nand age and the negative coefficient for the interaction of\nrace and age support theories that suggest a diminishing\nor crossover effect of race rather than theories suggesting a\ndouble jeopardy hypothesis. The positive coefficient of race\nsuggests that black adults experienced a greater risk of death\nat young old ages. The negative coefficient of the interaction\nof race and age shows that black older adults' risk of morality\nincreases at a slower rate than white older adults' risk. We\ncompute the turning point age where black and white older\nadults have an equal risk of mortality after controlling other\n79.68. This means that after around age 80, black older adults\nhad lower risk of dying than whites.\nIn Model 6, we include individual SES measures to\nexamine their effects on mortality and their contribution to\nrace differences in mortality by age. First, as in Models 1\u00ad\n4 and Models 1b\u00ad4b, family income is negatively associated\nwith mortality. Second, including individual SES measures\nreduced but did not fully explain race differences in mortality\nby age.\nNeighborhood SDI is added in Model 7. We see that\nliving in a neighborhood with greater disadvantage is\nof demographic, and individual SES variables, and it further\nreduces the association between race and mortality by age.\nAgain, there remains a significant racial crossover effect on\nmortality due to the positive coefficient of race and negative\ncoefficient of the interaction of race and age. The turning\npoint of the crossover is about 74 after controlling for SES\nat multiple levels.\nFinally, all variances of neighborhood tracts are signifi-\ncant in Models 1b to 4b and Models 5 to 7. The standard error\npresents how much an individual neighborhood varies in its\nmortality rate compared to the norm [53, 54]. For example,\nThis suggests that an individual neighborhood has an average\n7 percent higher or lower mortality level compared to the\nnorm. This relatively large variation between neighborhoods\nsuggests that it is appropriate to model neighborhood-level\nvariance in mortality analyses among older adults.\n  5\nTable 2: The effect of individual SES, neighborhood context on mortality over time (1986\u00ad2002) for people aged 65+ at baseline: multilevel\nsurvival model.\nSDI: Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage Index; Random effect: random effects of neighborhood; Fam. income: family income.\nTable 3: Principal components factor analysis of Neighborhood\nSocioeconomic Disadvantage Index.\nCensus item Factor loading\n% Households with public assistance 0.86\na\nReverse-coded when added to index.\nIn additional analyses, we tested whether race differences\nin mortality vary by other covariates by testing the interac-\ntions of race and other covariates (see Table 4). The results\nshow that no other interactions are significant.\n4. Discussion\nWe examined the role of individual SES and neighborhood\nSES in explaining race differences in all-cause mortality over\ntime among black and white older adults. We explicitly\ntested whether race disparities in mortality vary by age and\nexamined the contribution of individual and neighborhood\nSES to explaining age variations in these race disparities.\nOne debate in previous studies is whether there are\neffects of neighborhood SES on mortality for older adults.\nSome studies found that neighborhood context has no\neffects on mortality, while other studies showed that there\nis an association between neighborhood and mortality [22].\nWe believe that inconsistencies in prior work may be\npartly due to the fact that most prior work did not take\ninto account the correlated data structure and censoring\nissues related to examining mortality data over time. We\napplied a multilevel survival approach (COX PH model with\nmixed effects) to estimate the effects of neighborhood on\nmortality. We found that older adults who lived in more\ndisadvantaged neighborhoods had a higher mortality rate,\nwhich is consistent with the studies that used COX PH\nThus, we have more confidence in concluding that there is a\nsignificant relationship between neighborhood SDI and all-\ncause mortality among older adults in the USA.\nThe second debate is whether individual SES and neigh-\nborhood SES help explain race differences in mortality for\nolder adults. Although only very few studies have implicitly\nexamined this issue, the results have been inconsistent.\nSome studies showed that individual SES fully mediates the\nrelationship between race and mortality, while other studies\nfound that individual SES helped explain the difference\nwith neighborhood context further explaining the difference.\nHowever, none of these prior studies considered or modeled\nthe race crossover effect of mortality between black and white\nolder adults.\nIn this study, we examined the contribution of individual\nSES and neighborhood SDI to mortality through two sets\nof analysis--with and without modeling a racial crossover\neffect. The analysis without modeling a potential crossover\neffect showed that individual SES fully mediated the relation-\nship between race and mortality. However, the analysis with\nthe interaction term between age and race demonstrated that\nthere is a race crossover effect and further indicated that race\ndifferences in mortality persist after both individual SES and\nneighborhood SDI were controlled. Our analysis suggests\nthat the crossover effect happens around ages 76\u00ad80, which\nis consistent with previous studies [27, 34].\nThere are a number of implications of this study. First,\nour study suggests that age reporting bias is probably not\nthe main reason for the racial crossover in mortality. This\nis because, even if more young black older adults were falsely\ncategorized into the oldest old groups, social factors still exert\na large effect on race difference in mortality since significant\nrace differences in mortality exist between blacks and whites\nat early older age. At the oldest ages, the aging process\nitself, especially biological factors, may have more weight on\nmortality and health [33]. Given our data and findings, our\nresults are consistent with a selective mortality explanation\nfor the racial crossover in mortality at later old age for black\nand white older adults. The selective survival of robust black\nolder adults likely explains the racial crossover.\nAnother important finding is that our analyses reveal\nthat individual SES explains more of the race differences in\nmortality than does neighborhood SDI. This is consistent\nwith previous studies [13]. However, we must keep in\nmind that some of the neighborhood effects on mortality\nmay work through their effects on individual-level income\n6  \nTable 4: The effect of individual SES and neighborhood context on mortality over time (1986\u00ad2002) for people aged 65+ at baseline:\nmultilevel survival model (including interactions of race and other covariates).\nVariables Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4\nBlackage\nNeighborhood SDI: Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage Index; Random effect: random effects of neighborhood; F-income: Family income.\nover the life course. Actual neighborhood effects are likely\nunderstated when individual-level income is controlled.\nThere are a number of limitations to our study. First,\nwe only include white and black older adults in our\nanalysis due to sample limitations of racial/ethnic distri-\nbution in the ACL data. Future studies should examine\nhow individual and neighborhood socioeconomic context\ncontribute to racial/ethnic disparities in mortality between\nother racial/ethnic groups. Second, we only include baseline\nindividual SES and neighborhood SDI variables in the\nanalysis. Using these static measures may underestimate\ntheir effects on mortality and in explaining race disparities\nin mortality [55]. Examining how dynamic individual SES\nand neighborhood SDI measures affect mortality over time\nfor older adults is an interesting and challenging research\ndirection for the future.\nThird, we limited our analysis to the cohort of older\nadults aged 65 and above. It may be interesting to compare\nthe results with other age cutoffs and cohorts. Cohort is an\nimportant concept in life course theory [56], which expects\nthat people born at a particular time (cohort effect) may\nexperience similar life events that will affect their life path,\nSES, health, and mortality [57]. For example, the type and\ndegree of racial discrimination experienced may differ by\ncohort, affecting race differences in the accumulation of\nindividual-level SES and neighborhood segregation. Testing\ncohort differences in future research could enrich theory\nand evidence about how multilevel SES contributes to race\ndifference in mortality.\n5. Conclusion\nOur study extends previous research and contributes to\nthe literature in two major ways. First, we use appropriate\nstatistical methods to estimate the association between\nmultilevel socioeconomic status (at individual and neigh-\nborhood levels) and mortality and confirm that older adults\nliving in a disadvantaged neighborhood context experience\nhigher risk of dying at earlier old ages, beyond the impact\nof individual SES. Second, we demonstrate that there are\nrace crossover effects in mortality at later old age, with\nblack older adults having a mortality advantage at later\nold age. Moreover, neighborhood SDI helps explain race\ndifferences in mortality at older ages. Finally, race differences\nin mortality did not disappear even after controlling for both\nindividual SES and neighborhood SDI measures once we\nmodeled the racial crossover effect on mortality.\nThese results help resolve debates in previous studies\nand help us better understand the association among race,\nindividual SES, and neighborhood context. The socioeco-\nnomic contexts that affect black and white Americans into\nold age affect their mortality risk, leading to selective survival\namong the most robust black older adults at later old ages.\nAddressing the individual and neighborhood socioeconomic\ndisadvantage of black people over the life course is necessary\nto reduce mortality disparities that culminate in early older\nadulthood.\n"
