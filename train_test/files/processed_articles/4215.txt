In children and adolescents,\nCD is especially insidious because of the negative\ninfluence of pathological inflammation in the\nsmall bowel (SB) on nutrition, resulting in\ngrowth and development retardation.1 Most\npatients with CD have some extent of SB engage-\nment and up to one third suffer from inflamma-\ntion limited to the SB.2,3 Moreover, the onset of\nCD is located in the SB in more than 20% of\npediatric patients.4,5 However, these estimates\nare somewhat uncertain because they are based\non outdated methods to examine the SB, which\nmight have underestimated the extent of inflam-\nmation in the SB. One important question is\nwhether information about more proximal SB\ndisease in addition to what is observed using\nstandard endoscopic and imaging evaluations\nwould change therapeutic strategies.\nVideo capsule endoscopy in pediatric\npatients with Crohn's disease: a single-\ncenter experience of 180 procedures\nArtur Nemeth, Daniel Agardh, Gabriele Wurm Johansson, Henrik Thorlacius\nand Ervin Toth\n Keywords: capsule endoscopy, children, Crohn's disease, small bowel\nCorrespondence to:\nErvin Toth\nEndoscopy Unit,\nDepartment of\nGastroenterology, Sk\u00e5ne\nUniversity Hospital, Lund\nervin.toth@med.lu.se\nArtur Nemeth\nDepartment of\nGastroenterology, Sk\u00e5ne\nUniversity Hospital, Lund\nUniversity, Malm\u00f6, Sweden\nDaniel Agardh\nDepartment of Pediatrics,\nSk\u00e5ne University Hospital,\nLund University, Malm\u00f6,\nSweden\nGabriele Wurm Johansson\nDepartment of\nGastroenterology, Sk\u00e5ne\nUniversity Hospital, Lund\nUniversity, Malm\u00f6, Sweden\nHenrik Thorlacius\nDepartment of Surgery,\nSk\u00e5ne University Hospital,\nLund University, Malm\u00f6,\nSweden\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11\n2 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nVideo capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a noninvasive\nmethod enabling excellent visualization of the SB\nVCE has become the preferred method for evalu-\nation of obscure GI bleeding, tumors and inflam-\nmation in the SB.9\u00ad13 Several studies have\ndocumented that VCE effectively detects CD in\nadult patients. For example, one study reported\n20% increased diagnostic yield of SB CD lesions\ncompared with ileoscopy14 and another investiga-\ntion showed that VCE is superior in detecting\nmucosal lesions compared with magnetic reso-\nnance enterography (MRE).15 However, the\nimpact of VCE on the clinical management of\npediatric patients with CD has not been evalu-\nated in large single-center studies.16 Thus, the\naim of this study was to examine the impact and\nsafety of VCE performed in children and adoles-\ncents being investigated for suspected and estab-\nlished CD in a large sample of patients from one\ntertiary center for pediatric VCE.\nMaterials and methods\nPatients\nThis retrospective study evaluated all consecutive\npediatric patients with suspected or known CD\nundergoing VCE from October 2003 to December\n2014 at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital in Malm\u00f6,\nSweden. All patients gave written informed con-\nsent prior to VCE examinations. The study was\nconducted in accordance with the ethical princi-\nples of the Declaration of Helsinki and the study\nwas approved by the Ethical Committee of Lund\nmedical records of patients were analyzed by an\nexperienced gastroenterologist before VCE to\nidentify patients with potential SB obstruction.\nPatients with suspected SB stricture underwent\npatency capsule (PC) examination. In the case of\nSB patency, patients continued with VCE.\nPatients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-\ntory drugs within a period of 6 months before\nVCE were excluded.\nVideo capsule endoscopy\nVCE examinations were performed with the\nPillCam SB1, SB2 and SB3 VCE system (Given\nImaging Ltd, Yokneam, Israel) after an 8 h fast\nwithout any bowel preparation. After swallowing\nthe capsule, patients were allowed clear liquids\nafter 2 h and solid food after 4 h. If a patient was\nnot able to swallow the capsule the VCE delivery\ndevice (AdvanCE, US Endoscopy, Mentor, OH,\nUSA) or the Roth Net retrieval device (US\nEndoscopy) was used for capsule deployment via\na gastroscope in the duodenum. All VCE exami-\nnations were evaluated by one of four gastroen-\nterologists having experience with VCE. No\nfurther controls were done if the video showed\ncapsule passage to the colon. An abdominal x-ray\nfilm was recommended 2 weeks after VCE if the\nvideo did now show capsule passage to the colon\nor if the patient did not observe natural passage of\nthe capsule.\nPatency capsule\nPC examinations were performed using a first- or\na second-generation PC. A PC test was consid-\nered negative if the capsule was eliminated from\nthe GI tract within 40 h (first-generation PC) or\n30 h (second-generation PC) from ingestion\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions.\nElimination of the PC was confirmed using a\nhandheld scanner.\nDefinitions\nPatients referred for VCE with symptoms of\nabdominal pain or diarrhea were categorized as\nhaving suspected CD if they fulfilled the\nInternational Conference on Capsule Endoscopy\n(ICCE) criteria, or if their referring physician\nsuspected CD.17 Patients were diagnosed as hav-\ning CD if they were treated for CD on the basis\nof their symptoms and additional objective find-\nings. VCE consistent with CD was defined as\nthe presence of more than three erosions and\nulcerations in the SB while three or fewer SB\nlesions was defined as suspected but not diag-\nResults\nA total of 180 VCE examinations were performed\nin 169 consecutive patients.

Of these\nincomplete cases, 11 (37%) capsules were placed\nendoscopically into the duodenum. Findings\nconsistent with CD were found in 13 (43%) of\nthe 30 incomplete studies. The capsule showed\nSB mucosa for more than 7 h (range 3\u00ad11 h) in\nincomplete procedures. The majority of patients\nwith incomplete examinations swallowed the\n8 h of recording time, while 8 (27%) incomplete\nprocedures were conducted with the SB2 capsule\nhaving a maximum of 9 h of recording time. Only\n2 of 30 incomplete studies (7%) were performed\nwith the SB3 capsule, which has 12 h of record-\ning time and these two capsules had been endo-\nscopically placed in the duodenum.\nIndications for VCE were suspected CD in 125\ncedures. VCE detected mucosal abnormalities in\n98 (54%) examinations whereas SB findings were\nobserved in 88 (49%) studies. Seventy-one of\nthese 88 (81%) cases were consistent with CD\nminor changes not diagnostic for CD. A total of\n92 (51%) studies displayed normal SB mucosa.\nColonic lesions were seen in 14 (8%) examina-\ntions, including 10 cases in which no SB findings\nwere concomitantly detected. VCE showed previ-\nously unidentified lesions in the colon in three\nstudies. In patients with established CD, 44 of 55\n(80%) examinations showed findings consistent\nwith SB CD, whereas 10 (18%) cases were nega-\ntive and only a single patient had nonspecific\nabnormalities. Twenty-nine of 55 (53%) proce-\ndures identified CD lesions in the jejunum. In the\ngroup of 125 suspected CD, a new diagnosis was\nmade in 30 (24%) patients and CD was excluded\nshowed SB lesions suggestive but not diagnostic\nfor CD according to accepted criteria.18 The cap-\n(14%) suspected cases.\nA new diagnosis or a change in therapy occurred\nin 56 (31%) patients. Fifty-three patients had SB\nfindings and three had previously unidentified\nCD lesions in the colon. We detected 71 cases\nshowing Crohn lesions in the SB, and as a result\nof VCE findings, a change in therapeutic manage-\nment was recommended in 47 (66%) of these\npatients with CD. Therapeutic changes included\nintensification or initiation of anti-inflammatory\ntreatment in 43 (60%) patients; therapy was\ndecreased in 2 (3%) patients and 2 (3%) patients\nrefused recommended treatment. Biologic medi-\ncation was started in 19 (27%) and immunomod-\nulatory treatment was initiated in 14 (20%) of\nthese 71 patients. Surgical intervention was not\nsuggested to any patient. The recommended\ntherapeutic changes based on VCE results are\ndescribed in detail in Table 2.\nPC was used in 71 patients to identify those with\npotential SB obstruction before VCE. In 33\n(46%) patients, PC examination did not demon-\nstrate SB patency. In 14 (42%) of these cases,\nradiological imaging was performed and showed\nno SB stenosis but only 7 of these patients under-\nwent subsequent VCE. Radiological examination\nshowed SB stenosis in 8 (24%) cases and VCE\nwas not performed. Seven (21%) patients without\nSB patency did not undergo further examina-\ntions. In four additional patients, cross-sectional\nimaging was not performed, but after repeated\nevaluation of the patient's symptoms VCE was\noffered. In 38 (54%) cases, SB patency was con-\nfirmed and VCE was performed. Patients with\nendoscopic placement of the capsule and sus-\npected SB obstruction underwent MRE to prove\nSB patency. We observed one case of capsule\nretention in the GI tract. In this patient, the cap-\nsule was retained within a metallic stent in the\nsigmoid colon which had been inserted previously\nto manage a CD stricture. The patient recovered\nafter sigmoid resection.\nTable 1.

Only\none case of capsule retention was noted, indicat-\ning that the procedure is safe in children at least\nafter 3 years of age. Moreover, nearly half of the\nperformed VCEs revealed abnormal intestinal\nfindings and resulted in changes in therapy in 6\nout of 10 of these patients, which suggests a ben-\nefit of performing an additional investigation with\nVCE in children with potential SB disease.\nTwo previous large single-center pediatric studies\nincluded patients up to 23 years and they did not\nfocus on the impact of VCE on management of\nCD.7,20 All patients in our large European cohort\nwere under 18 years old. Herein, we found a 49%\ndetection rate of Crohn lesions in the SB, which is\nsimilar to previous studies.8,20 Moreover, a major-\nity (81%) of the SB findings were diagnostic for\nCD. At the same time, VCE excluded SB CD in\nabout 51% of the cases, which is of great impor-\ntance for further management of CD. Most of the\nchildren were able to swallow the capsule and the\ncapsule reached the colon during the recording\ntime in the majority of the examinations. The rate\nof incomplete procedures (17%) compares well\nNotably, 42% of the capsules deployed endo-\nscopically in the duodenum did not reach the\ncolon during recording time. The longer SB tran-\nsit time might be related to the use of general\nanesthesia and endoscopic placement of the cap-\nsule in the incomplete studies.22 Nonetheless, the\nSB was visualized in all incomplete studies.\nInterestingly, CD was diagnosed more often\n(43%) in patients with incomplete procedures\nthan those with complete examinations (38%),\nindicating that incomplete VCE examinations do\nnot hamper diagnostic yield. The explanation\ncould be that in incomplete procedures the cap-\nsule still spends on average more than 7 h exam-\nining SB even if not reaching the cecum during\nrecording time.\nAlthough there is some evidence to prepare the\nbowel prior to SB VCE, optimal bowel prepara-\ntion is controversial.23 A current meta-analysis of\nadult studies demonstrated that laxatives do not\nimprove diagnostic yield or completion rate in SB\nVCE, although SB visualization is improved.\nThat meta-analysis concluded that the use of lax-\natives might be beneficial in patients likely to have\nsubtle findings.24 The only prospective pediatric\nstudy to date supports the use of 25 ml/kg (up to\n1000 ml/day) of polyethylene glycol solution plus\nration of choice for VCE. This study demon-\nstrated that despite improvement in mucosal\nvisualization, there was not a significant differ-\nence in the overall diagnostic yield between the\nstudy groups.25 In our study, we performed VCE\nwithout bowel preparation and SB cleanliness\ngrading because Crohn lesions in the SB are often\nmultiple and missing minor mucosal changes\ndoes not affect diagnostic yield of VCE.\nFurthermore, bowel preparation might increase\npatient discomfort and decrease compliance in\nchildren.\nMRE examinations have a tendency to miss the\ndiagnosis of CD in the jejunum.26 In our study,\nVCE showed significant inflammatory activity in\nthe jejunum in more than 25% of all examina-\ntions, indicating the importance of VCE in the\nFigure 1A\u00adD.

It should be empha-\nsized that jejunal CD lesions were detected in\nmore than half of the patients with established\nCD in our study.\nOur study shows that VCE is a safe method in\npediatric patients with established and suspected\nCD. In fact, we found a very low complication\nfrequency with a capsule retention rate of only\n0.6% (one case), which is lower than that observed\nin most other studies, ranging from 1.0% to\nspecial in the sense that the capsule was retained\nin a metallic stent.28 Thus, previous stenting in\nthe GI tract should be taken into consideration\nbefore performing VCE. Notably, we did not\nobserve any capsule retention in the SB, which is\nin line with a previous prospective study of\npatients with inflammatory bowel disease.29 The\nuse of PC in adults has been shown to decrease\nthe risk of capsule retention.30 In our sample,\n46% of PC examinations did not suggest SB\npatency. This high proportion could be explained\nby the fact that elimination of PC was confirmed\nusing a handheld scanner and some of the PC\ncould have been in the colon at the time of scan-\nning. One study reported that use of PC is a use-\nful screening tool in adolescents,31 but it is\ncontroversial whether younger children should\nundergo PC examination because they cannot\nswallow the PC and sedation solely for endo-\nscopic deployment of PC is not recommended.32\nAt the same time, several studies have shown that\nradiological SB imaging, such as barium SB fol-\nlow through, computed tomographic enteroclysis\nand magnetic resonance enteroclysis does not\nexclude SB stenosis.30,32 Our low capsule reten-\ntion rate can be explained by careful patient selec-\ntion with frequent use of PC in patients older\nConclusion\nThis study in a large cohort of pediatric patients\ndemonstrates that VCE has a significant clinical\nimpact on the management of children and ado-\nlescents with suspected and established CD.\nAdditionally, VCE was associated with an excep-\ntionally low capsule retention rate in the GI tract.\nConflict of interest statement\nG.W.
