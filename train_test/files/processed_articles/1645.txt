The social disorga-\nnization tradition is perhaps the most well-known and developed piece of this\nresearch. Beginning with the pioneering work of Shaw and McKay (1942), an\nextensive literature has linked weakened neighborhood structures with more\ncrime. Shaw and McKay concluded that variation in delinquency across\ngeographic areas was a function of the variations in social disorganization,\ndefined as the breakdown in social institutions such as families, schools, and\nchurches. In Juvenile Delinquency and Urban Areas, they also observed that a\nvariety of social problems clustered in space along with delinquency, including\ntruancy, infant mortality, tuberculosis, and mental disorder. They subsequently\nconcluded that delinquency is not an isolated problem, but rather that the\nphysical, social, and economic conditions of neighborhoods impact many social\nills (see also Faris & Dunham, 1939; Silver, Mulvey, & Swanson, 2002). Thus, the\nsocial disorganization tradition leads researchers to expect a generality, or vari-\nety, of behaviors and social outcomes in socially disorganized neighborhoods.\nYet macro-theories of crime occasionally speak to variation in crime types\nwithin a geographically delimited unit, not just differences in the crime rate.\nConsider, for example, that the hypothetical distribution of offenses for all areas\nis approximately 40% violent and 60% nonviolent crime. Those areas featuring\n70% violent and 30% nonviolent crime would represent a substantial departure\nfrom the prevailing pattern. The literature examining the factors responsible for\nthe balance of violent to nonviolent crime within neighborhoods is quite scant,\nhowever, especially compared to what is known about the antecedents of overall\nneighborhood crime rates. Research has linked the key concepts of a number of\nmacro-level theories, including differential opportunity (Cloward & Ohlin, 1960),\nwith greater violence, yet this literature leaves open the possibility that the\nconstructs theorized as facilitating higher rates of violent crime in fact lead to\nhigher levels of crime across the entire spectrum of offense types, with no\nparticular tendency toward violence (i.e., the count of violent crime is higher,\nbut so too is property crime). An analysis that is specifically designed to study\nthe contrast in violent and nonviolent crime rates across neighborhoods could\nclarify this issue and offer insight about the unique conditions that give rise to\nviolent neighborhoods, thereby commenting on the need for theories to articu-\nlate violence-specific mechanisms. Should the factors purportedly fueling\ngreater neighborhood violence in fact promote myriad outcomes, then violence-\nspecific theories would have to be expanded to account for them. But the\ngreater the differences between relatively violent high-crime neighborhoods and\nrelatively nonviolent high-crime neighborhoods, then the greater justification\nthere is for theories that disaggregate the mechanisms underlying various crime\ntypes in neighborhoods. Put another way, the answer to the question of whether\nneighborhoods significantly vary in the extent to which violence is responsible\nfor their crime rates can have a profound effect on the evolution of macro-level\ntheories of crime.\nThe current study attempts to fill this empirical void by investigating the\nextent to which neighborhoods in Chicago demonstrate a relative proclivity for\nviolence over other crime types. Thus, this inquiry will comment on whether\nsystematic variations in crime exist across neighborhoods, not just with regard\nto crime incidence, but also crime type. It also determines whether particular\nfactors traditionally implicated as producing high levels of violence in neighbor-\nhoods (e.g., social disorganization) predict a differential tendency for violence\nas opposed to universally high crime rates across all types of crime. In order to\ndo so, the current study uses data from the 1995 Project on Human Develop-\nment in   (PHDCN) Community Survey, the 1990 Census,\nand officially reported crime data from the Chicago Police Department (CPD). It\nalso relies on an extension of a recently developed analytic technique that\ndetects both the extent and form of differential crime profiles (Osgood &\nSchreck, 2007). These data and this method afford the opportunity to investi-\ngate the theoretical expectations of the differential opportunity thesis with\nrespect to the types of crimes which cluster in space.\nTheory and Research on Differentiating Violent versus\nNonviolent Neighborhoods\nWhereas there is extensive literature on crime rates at the neighborhood level,\nlittle of it directly bears on the extent to which some neighborhoods favor\nparticular crime types over others. The void of research explicitly addressing\ndifferential crime profiles at the neighborhood level, with regard to crime type\nrather than rate, is somewhat surprising since empirical work suggests that such\npatterns may exist. Early cartographic work that, in part, served as the founda-\ntion for the development of neighborhood-based theories demonstrated such\npatterns. For example, Balbi and Guerry mapped official crimes across France\nduring the early part of the nineteenth century, noting that property and\nviolent crimes tended to concentrate in different regions (see Weisburd &\nMcEwan, 1998). More recently, research on crime at micro-level places (i.e.,\nhot spots) also demonstrates that crime not only clusters at places, but that this\nconcentration can be of particular crime types (Sherman, Gartin, & Buerger,\n1989). The premise underlying hot spots draws heavily from environmental\ncriminology (e.g., Cornish & Clarke, 1986) and routine activity theory (Cohen &\nFelson, 1979), suggesting that opportunities for crime vary across locations,\nwhether because they provide differential access to crime targets, concentra-\ntions of motivated offenders or gaps in supervision/guardianship. In some cases,\nthe opportunities for crime are ubiquitous, supporting a concentration of high\ncrime rates that cut across all crime types. In other cases, however, hot spots\nreflect specific opportunities and crimes (e.g., Braga, Weisburd, Waring, &\nnot solely dependent on the physical environment, but are also socially struc-\ntured (Cloward, 1959), one may expect to see a similar pattern emerge at a\nslightly higher level of aggregation from hot spots: neighborhoods.\nIn addition to these empirical patterns, some core theoretical treatises on\nneighborhoods and crime discuss, explicitly or implicitly, how different social\nstructures facilitate different crime patterns. These viewpoints arguably include\nsubculture of violence perspectives, strain theories, and opportunity theories\nthat focus on how the proximate environment affects the nature of crime.\nPerhaps the most explicit theory on this score is Cloward and Ohlin's (1960; see\nalso Cloward, 1959) differential opportunity theory--indeed, a core contribution\nof this theory is its assertion that neighborhood characteristics mediate and\nshape the expression of crime. In an attempt to bring together the contempo-\nrary dominant theoretical traditions--anomie and differential association--into a\nsingle explanation, they proposed that crime arises because of frustration asso-\nciated with unequal access to legitimate means to achieve success. For this\nreason, there is systematic variation in crime rates across places and popula-\ntions, with neighborhood disadvantage being a key indicator of where high\ncrime rates tend to cluster. Scholars often rely on this part of their proposition\nto label Cloward and Ohlin strain theorists, but the unique contribution of their\nargument is in their clear statement that \"the pressures that lead to deviant\npatterns do not necessarily determine the particular pattern that results\"\nmeans are not equally distributed, nor are illegitimate means; opportunities to\nlearn and engage in various types of crime are differentially distributed across\nneighborhoods. Thus, Cloward and Ohlin (1960) suggested that in disadvantaged\nneighborhoods, strain provides the motivation for crime and generally leads to\nhigher crime rates. But a neighborhood's social structure channels this motiva-\ntion so that the higher crime rates manifest in differential crime-type profiles\n(i.e., they anticipate both fluctuation in the incidence and distribution of crime\nproportions across neighborhoods). In particular, \"criminal\" subcultures situ-\nated around property crimes form in neighborhoods characterized by dense,\nthough unconventional, social ties and cohesion while \"conflict\" subcultures\nsituated around violence form in areas lacking integrated social relations and\nnetworks.\nJust as differential opportunity theory implicated the role of social ties in the\nproduction of crime, so too does social disorganization theory, though with\ncontrasting predictions. In socially disorganized areas, characterized at the\nmacro-level by factors such as residential mobility and economic disadvantage,\nsocial networks are sparse or weak and formal and informal social controls are\ndisorganization perspective, the void of stable and cohesive social networks in a\nneighborhood leads to a generalized increase in crime, of which violence is\npart. From this standpoint, structural factors should affect the incidence of\ncrime but not necessarily the differential distribution of its form; factors indica-\ntive of social disorganization should not be implicated in shaping crime patterns\nthat favor one type (e.g., violence) in any systematic way. To be sure, the\noriginal data with which Shaw and McKay (1942) illustrated their premise\nfocused on a variety of delinquent offenses, not particular crime types (see also\nthe complementary work of Thrasher, 1927).\nIn contrast, Cloward and Ohlin's (1960) differential opportunity perspective\nproposes that social disorganization leads to the emergence of a conflict\nsubculture, not to generalized and universally high crime rates. As per their\nargument, in socially disorganized areas, there is a void of both legitimate and\nillegitimate means to deal with strain, and violence becomes the only way to\nachieve status and success. Cloward and Ohlin argued that socially disorganized\nneighborhoods provide neither the opportunities nor the learning models for\nskills oriented around property crime enterprises, which would limit the\nincidence of property-related offenses. The fractured social cohesion and insta-\nbility of the neighborhood, however, curtails its ability to manage and control\nviolence, thereby allowing violent offending to comprise a greater share of the\nneighborhood crime distribution. Whereas some theorists find it paradoxical\nthat socially organized areas can have high crime rates, Cloward and Ohlin\nin economically deprived neighborhoods that have sufficient social cohesion and\ninterconnectedness of legitimate and illegitimate social networks, which bears\nimply that some neighborhoods may have crime profiles that favor nonviolent\ncrime.\nImportantly, it does not appear that differential opportunity suggests that\nonly violent crime will occur in neighborhoods devoid of social organization;\noffenders may channel frustration and seek status though occasional vandalism\nand theft, for example. Still, Cloward and Ohlin are clear in their assertions\nthat, relative to other neighborhoods, violence should be a defining characteris-\ntic of socially disorganized areas and not merely part and parcel of high crime\nrates. In the end, therefore, the traditional social disorganization perspective\nasserts that structural indicators such as instability and weak social networks\nshould identify high-crime neighborhoods, whereas differential opportunity\nargues that they should identify neighborhoods dominated by violence.\nThe literature does highlight an empirical connection between social disorga-\nnization and violence. For example, Sampson (1987) found that the key mediator\nbetween black unemployment and city-level violence was family breakdown,\nsince it impacted social control and stability at both the neighborhood and\nindividual levels. In this way, the argument is that economic deprivation does not\ninherently promote violent crime, but rather its effect operates primarily through\nweakened family and neighborhood social structure. More recent work echoes\nthis point. Ousey (2000) found that deindustrialization, which amplifies economic\ndisparity, promotes violent crime (juvenile homicide) because it increases the\namount of female-headed households, which also affects social controls at the\nneighborhood level. Like Sampson (1987), he argued that neighborhoods with\nhigher rates of female-headed households tend to have lower levels of formal\nsocial control, since single mothers tend to be less involved in neighborhood\norganizations, as well as informal social control, since single parent households\ntend to be less involved with neighbors. Furthermore, Ousey (2000) hypothesized\nthat fathers who abandon family roles and are also deprived of economic oppor-\ntunities because of deindustrialization are essentially excluded from legitimate\nsocial networks, increasing the odds of violence in the neighborhood. Sampson\net al.'s work on collective efficacy also clearly draws a connection between a\nvacuum of social organization, residential stability, cohesion, and violent crime\n(Sampson, Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997; see also Clear, Rose, Waring, & Scully,\nCollectively, such studies demonstrate that disadvantaged neighborhoods\ncharacterized by social instability and a void of cohesion will have higher rates\nof violence. These notions certainly evoke Cloward and Ohlin's (1960) argu-\nments that a void of integrated and cohesive social networks can promote a\nviolent subculture, since it limits opportunities for other criminal enterprise and\nthe neighborhood has a limited capacity to control youth violence. But it\nremains unclear whether these factors (1) truly underlie a neighborhood procliv-\nity for violence over other crime types, or (2) instead affect crime in a universal\nmanner. Studies that only focus on violence as an outcome (e.g., Ousey, 2000;\ncrime rates. Indeed, studies that do account for property crime often find it too\nhas a relationship with macro-level social instability and social disorganization\nremains the question as to what degree malfunctioning neighborhood structure\nspecifically favors violence relative to other crime types or whether neighbor-\nhood conditions fuel proportionate growth in all crime.\nThere are a few indications that structural and organizational factors may\naffect violent and property crime in different ways. For instance, Stark, Doyle,\nfound that certain measures of social integration, such as church membership,\nwere more strongly related to property crime than violent crime (see also\ncities offers perhaps the best evidence on the factors responsible for crime-type\ndifferentiation across neighborhoods. One of the research questions he explored\nwas the impact of various structural dimensions of neighborhoods on violent and\nproperty crime rates. Running separate models for violent (murder, aggravated\nassault, robbery) and nonviolent crime (burglary, motor vehicle theft), Hipp\nfound that greater inequality and ethnic heterogeneity resulted in higher crime\nrates overall, but the effect coefficients were typically more salient for violent\ncrimes than property crimes. Like previous studies investigating both property\nand violent crime, however, Hipp's (2007) results are still suggestive, as his\nprimary focus was on explaining overall crime rates and not on defining or\ndirectly measuring the contrast in violent versus nonviolent offending at the\nneighborhood level. Thus, extant literature cannot address the key point at\nwhich social disorganization and differential opportunity diverge. Disorganiza-\ntion scholars generally assume that disorganized neighborhoods will produce a\nvariety of crimes whereas differential opportunity adopts a view that the same\nstructural and organizational conditions would promote a distribution of crime\nwhere violence comprises a much larger share of the criminal activity. Findings\nto date reveal that a variety of crime and social problems are associated with\ndisorganization, but it is not yet certain if disorganization predicts a relative\ntendency for violent crimes over other types.\nThe Current Study\nWhile there is considerable empirical evidence that neighborhood social ties and\ndisorganization influence rates of crime (see e.g., Bursik & Grasmick, 1993;\nvoid of integrated and cohesive social networks (1) underlie a neighborhood\nproclivity for violence over other crime types, or (2) instead affect crime in a\nuniversal manner. A proclivity for violence may occur because certain condi-\ntions give rise or permit violent crime but not property crime, or because these\nconditions affect violent and property crime to different degrees (i.e., weak\nsocial networks may increase both crime types, but the magnitude may be\ngreater with regard to violence). In this way, neighborhood factors may not only\nimpact the local crime rate, but also predict variations in the relative portion of\ncrime types that comprise this rate.\nThe current study addresses this issue by using a newly developed analytic\nmethod that can detect differential crime profiles at the neighborhood level,\ndrawing on official crime reports from the Chicago PD. After assessing whether\nthere are significant differences in the relative distribution of crime types (i.e.,\nviolence and nonviolence) across neighborhoods, this inquiry will determine\nwhether structural factors reflective of a void in social organization predict this\ndifferential tendency, independent of local crime rates. If disorganization\nproduces a significantly greater preponderance of violence, then differential\nopportunity theory is supported, but if the indicators of disorganization do not\nresult in a significant differential impact on the contrast of violence to nonvio-\nlence in the neighborhood, then the notion that social disorganization has\ngeneral effects would be supported.\nData and Measures\nData utilized in this study come from three sources: the PHDCN, the 1990 U.S.\nCensus, and the CPD. Measures of neighborhood social processes come from the\npurposes of the PHDCN, neighborhood boundaries were operationally defined by\ncombining 847 census tracts into 343 neighborhood clusters, constructed to be\ninternally homogeneous with respect to socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity,\nhousing density, and family structure (Sampson et al., 1997).1 Survey questions\ninclude items about the social organization of neighborhoods, including an\nemphasis on neighborhood social ties.\nRecall Cloward and Ohlin's (1960) assertion that criminal subcultures\noriented toward property crimes form in neighborhoods characterized by dense\nsocial ties while conflict subcultures situated around violence form in areas\nlacking integrated social relations. Thus, we utilize a measure of neighborhood\nsocial ties in our analyses and hypothesize that violence will be relatively more\nprevalent compared to nonviolent crime in those neighborhoods characterized\nby weak neighborly social ties. We construct a scale of neighborly ties with the\nfollowing survey items related to the frequency (i.e., how often) of contact and\nsupport among neighbors: (1) Do you and people in your neighborhood do favors\nfor each other? (2) Do you and other neighbors watch over someone's property\nwhen they are not home? (3) Do you and people in your neighborhood ask each\nother for advice? (4) Do you and people in your neighborhood have parties\nwhere other people in the neighborhood are invited? and (5) Do you and other\npeople in your neighborhood visit in each other's home or on the street?2\nOur measure of neighborhood social ties was constructed via a multilevel\nregression model, with item responses to each survey question nested within a\nrespondent, and respondents nested within neighborhood clusters (see also,\nmodel represents an item response model with scale scores adjusted for missing\ndata and unreliability. At the second level of the model, scale scores are\nadjusted for the individual characteristics of respondents in neighborhood clus-\nters (gender, age, race and ethnicity, marital status, education, employment\nstatus, homeownership, years of residence in neighborhood, and the number of\nresidential moves in the five years leading up the survey). At the third level of\nthe model, each neighborhood-specific mean for a given scale is allowed to vary\naround the mean score for the city as a whole. From this three-level regression\n1. In analyses, we follow the standard practice of many PHDCN studies of excluding the neighbor-\nhood cluster which contains O'Hare airport.\n2. We specifically use this measure in lieu of collective efficacy, which is a combination of social\ncohesion (e.g., people around here are willing to help their neighbors) and informal social control\n(which focuses on neighbors' willingness to intervene upon witnessing deviance). In theory, collec-\ntive efficacy can be applied to achieve any collective goal; yet in practice, measures of collective\nefficacy are infused with a prosocial and conventional quality. Thus, the traditional measurement of\ncollective efficacy does not match the key point at which differential opportunity and social\ndisorganization differ, which is the notion that neighborhood ties and cohesion are not inherently\nprosocial. Because some scholars may not view social disorganization in this systemic way, but\nrather see it as focusing on legitimate ties and networks, we also estimated models with collective\nefficacy. Supplemental analysis, available upon request, demonstrates that collective efficacy\nbehaves in a manner similar to the neighborhood ties measure. Still, because it is more consistent\nwith our theoretical framework, we present the results with the neighborhood ties variable.\nmodel, a neighborhood-specific empirical Bayes residual is output, which is the\nneighborhood-specific scale we use in analyses (see Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002,\nNeighborhood structural data come from the 1990 U.S. Census. Consistent\nwith research in the social disorganization tradition, we utilize three measures\nof neighborhood structure: concentrated disadvantage, residential stability, and\nimmigrant concentration. A meta-analysis of the social disorganization literature\nindicates that these measures generally are predictive of neighborhood crime\nand disorder (Pratt & Cullen, 2005). These scales are created via factor analyses\nfrom resident responses to multiple census questions, where items included in\neach factor are weighted by their factor loadings. Concentrated disadvantage\nrefers to a scale of economic disadvantage influenced by poverty, family status,\nage, employment, and race. Specifically, the following census indicators are\nused to construct the measure: the percentage of families below the poverty\nline, percentage of families receiving public assistance, percentage of unem-\nployed individuals in the civilian labor force, percentage of female-headed fami-\nlies with children, percentage of residents under age 18, and the percentage of\nblack residents. Residential stability is derived from the following census indica-\ntors: percentage of residents five years old and older who lived in the same\nhouse five years earlier, and the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied.\nFinally, immigrant concentration is derived from two census indicators: the\npercentage of Latino residents and the percentage of foreign-born residents.\nobtained from the CPD.3 Address information from each incident was used to\ngeocode the location of the crime to the corresponding PHDCN neighborhood\ncluster. Readers should note that the available data for these two years contain\nslightly different assortments of offenses. For 1995, violent crimes included\nassault, homicide, and robbery. Nonviolent crimes included burglary, vandal-\nism, auto theft, theft, drugs, and vice. The 1996 data reported aggravated\nassault, assault, homicide and robbery (for violence) and vandalism and burglary\n(for property offending). As detailed in the next section, we combine these\nmeasures into latent variables using measurement modeling techniques, which\nshould reduce variations in the results arising from measurement errors. The\nrelevant items and their descriptive information are reported in Appendix A.\nThough many studies investigating crime at the neighborhood level have relied\non official records (e.g., Bursik, Grasmick, & Chamlin, 1990), scholars nonethe-\nless recognize their limitations and provide appropriate caution. Although we\nknow some about individual-level determinants of reporting crime, the extent\nto which neighborhood level factors impact reporting, and in which direction it\noperates, remains clouded (see Baumer, 2002). For this reason, even though we\nbelieve the current data are the best suited to the question at hand, we\nacknowledge the limitations of using official records.\n3. Data were provided by CPD's Division of Research and Development. Findings from use of these\ndata in no way represent the views of CPD or the City of Chicago.\nAnalytical Methods\nOur analytic strategy consists of two steps: first we employ a modified version\nof a statistical model developed by Osgood and Schreck (2007) to detect\ndifferential crime profiles. Second, after estimating each neighborhood's crime\nprofile (i.e., the relative proportion of violent to nonviolent crimes), we model\nthat profile as a function of neighborhood structural predictors and social ties in\na spatial regression model. As the aforementioned article provides a detailed\nexplanation of the technique, this presentation is limited to the main features\n(see also, Schreck, Stewart, & Osgood, 2008) and our modifications.\nDetecting Crime Profiles\nOsgood and Schreck's (2007) method derives from an item response theory (IRT)\nconception of measurement (Osgood, McMorris, & Potenza, 2002) in a multilevel\nregression framework (Raudenbush, Johnson, & Sampson, 2003). This model\nprovides some important benefits for the current investigation relative to a more\ntraditional regression or, for instance, a geographically identified system analysis\nthat either treats violent and nonviolent crime as separate dependent variables\nor else uses the ratio of violent to property crime. First, our analysis can assess\nwhether there are significant differences in the crime distributions across neigh-\nborhoods, relative to population base rates for each offense type. This allows us\nto determine the extent to which neighborhoods truly vary and are unique in their\ncrime distributions, as opposed to demonstrating differences generated by\nchance. Second, our approach addresses any potential confounding between over-\nall crime rates and the tendencies of neighborhoods to differentiate by crime\ntype, as well as controls for the measurement precision of the data. Taken\ntogether then, the model can distinguish between (1) neighborhoods with high\nlevels of violence, but where there are also concomitantly high levels of nonviolent\ncrime, and (2) neighborhoods that are significantly different from the mode with\nregard to the portion of their criminal repertoire that comprises violent crime.\nAt Level 1, the multilevel regression model specifies a measurement model\ndefining two indices, the first reflecting the combined violent and nonviolent\ncrime rates within neighborhoods and the second reflecting the differential\ntendency among neighborhoods toward either violent or nonviolent crime. This\nlevel therefore will provide insight as to whether there is any evidence of\nsystematic differences in crime type across neighborhoods, or simply differ-\nences in crime incidence. The Level 1 unit of analysis is the rate of offending\nwithin a neighborhood for a specific type of crime, and the Level 2 unit of anal-\nysis is the neighborhood. Integrating these two levels of analysis in a single\nmodel enables us to address the variation across neighborhoods in the overall\nrate of crime as well as the relative proclivity of violent to nonviolent crimes.\nIn the notation of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; Raudenbush & Bryk,\nThe Level 2 regression equations are:\nThe Level 1 equation serves as the measurement model and it establishes the\nmeaning of the Level 2 equations. IRT models often employ dichotomous item-\nlevel data (Osgood et al., 2002); however, neighborhood-level crime rates are\ncontinuous measures. HLM can accommodate non-dichotomous data in several\nways: via ordinal logistic, Poisson, or linear regression models. Given the contin-\nuous nature of our data, we specified linear regression and log-transformed the\ncrime rates in order to normalize their distribution. This converts the Level 1\nmeasurement model from the more complex linear form of IRT models to the\nmore straightforward linear form of classical measurement models (see Baker,\n2001). The Level 1 outcome measure thus is neighborhood j's rate or offense\ntype i. Should neighborhood j report, for instance, that 50 offenses occurred for\nOverall crime rate\nIn Equation (1), the rate for each offense within the neighborhood will depend\non three factors. The first is the equation's constant term, 0j, which applies\nequally to all offense types. This coefficient varies randomly across neighbor-\nhoods, as indicated by the residual term in its Level 2 equation (u0j of Equation\n(2)). Accordingly, 0j is a latent variable that captures neighborhood differences\nin crime rates across all offenses, or the overall crime rate. The variance of the\nresidual term u0j, or 00, reflects the extent of neighborhood differences in this\ntendency. The amount of variance depends on the degree to which higher offense\nrates for each offense are associated with higher rates for all other offense types.\nDifferential in violence versus nonviolence\nIn Osgood and Schreck's (2007) basic model, the second factor determining the\nrate for a given offense is the neighborhood's level of favoring violent crime. 1j\ntakes on this meaning when the variable Vio is coded with a positive value for\nmeasures of violent crimes and a negative value for measures of nonviolent crime.\nTo avoid any confound between differential distributions of violence and overall\nY Vio D\nij j j ij ij\ni\nl\n= + +\n=\n-\n\n  \n  \u00b5\nj j\n \nij\n \u00b5\nj j\ncrime, Vio is coded to have a mean of zero for every neighborhood (i.e., a group-\nmean-centered dummy variable). 1j provides an index of this differential\ntendency calibrated to reflect the difference between a neighborhood's log rate\nof violent crime versus its log rate of nonviolent crime.\nNeighborhoods with a relative preponderance of violent crime to nonviolent\ncrime would have a higher rate of offending for crimes with positive values on\nVio, and thus a positive value on 1j. Where the distribution of crime rates\nfavors nonviolent crime, the opposite pattern will occur and result in a negative\nvalue on 1j. Because the Level 2 equation for 1j includes a residual term, this\nindex of neighborhood violence is a latent variable that varies across neighbor-\nhoods, and the corresponding variance term (11) will reflect the extent to\nwhich neighborhoods systematically differ in their tendency toward violent\nversus nonviolent crime. An absence of variance would indicate a complete\noverlap in violent and nonviolent crime, with observed variation across neigh-\nborhoods due only to chance. A high level of variance, on the other hand, would\nbe indicative that the two are quite distinct.\nItem base-rates\nThe third factor contributing to the magnitude of a neighborhood's crime rate\nfor a given offense is the base-rate of offenses, expressed by the parameters\nij. Relatively rare forms of crime, which typically are more serious as well\n(Osgood et al., 2002; Raudenbush et al., 2003), will have lower values of ij and\nmore common crimes will have higher values. These parameters are incorpo-\nrated in the model through a series of dummy variables coded to reflect which\nitem is associated with each response (i.e., a value of 1 for that dummy variable\nand 0 for all others). These base-rate parameters are constant across the\nsample rather than varying across neighborhoods, as reflected in the absence of\na residual term in Equation (4).4\nSpatial Regression\nNeighborhoods are interdependent ecological units, such that the conditions\nin one neighborhood are influenced by the conditions of spatially proximate\nneighborhoods. Spatial dependence among neighborhoods arises, in part, because\nwe are artificially dividing a continuous geographic space (i.e., Chicago) into sepa-\n4. Our measurement model is a Rasch model, which assumes that all items are equally related to\nthe latent variable, and we assessed the plausibility of this assumption in the same manner as\nOsgood and Schreck (2007). Consistent with this assumption, (1) all items were positively correlated\nwith each other and had high positive loadings on a first factor in a factor analysis, and (2) violent\ncrime items generally were more strongly associated with one another than with nonviolent offense\nitems (Osgood & Schreck, 2007; Raudenbush et al., 2003). The model also assumes that the residuals\nof the latent variables (u) have a multivariate normal distribution, and our tests indicated no viola-\ntions of this assumption.\nrate neighborhoods. Thus, it may be the case that: (1) the crime rate in a given\nneighborhood is influenced by the extent of crime in proximate neighborhoods,\nand (2) that the proportion of violent to nonviolent crime in a given neighborhood\nis influenced by the proportion in proximate neighborhoods. Accordingly, prior\nresearch suggests that ignoring spatial dependence may lead to biased parameter\nestimates and erroneous conclusions about statistical significance (Anselin, 1988;\nIn order to estimate a spatial model, we output the Level 2 residuals from\nEquations (2) and (3) from the multilevel framework previously described, and\nimport those residuals as dependent variables into a software program designed\nfor undertaking spatial regression analyses.5 With a spatial lag model, we\nestimate two separate regression equations, one for the overall crime rate (0j)\nand another for the violence differential (1j).6 In these equations, we model\nthe respective dependent variable as a function of concentrated disadvantage,\nresidential stability, immigrant concentration, and neighborhood ties, while\nalso controlling for spatial autocorrelation. Thus, through such an analytic\nframework, we are able to detect the association between our four measures of\nneighborhood characteristics and our dependent variables, net of spatial depen-\ndencies. Readers should be aware, however, that using predicted scores derived\nfrom latent variables in a basic regression analysis has some potential problems\nof its own, as a large number of items is needed to reduce potential bias in the\npredicted scores (see Lu, Thomas, & Zumbo, 2005).7\nResults\nOur initial question concerns the significance of the contrast of violent to nonvi-\nolent crime across neighborhoods, or whether any observed variations in the\npatterns can be ruled out as plausibly a byproduct of chance. To address this,\nOsgood and Schreck (2007) used a z test, which employs the relevant variance\ncomponents (11) to assess whether adolescents had different violent offending\nhistories. Here, we use the same strategy to see if individual neighborhoods reveal\nsignificantly different violent crime profiles. Note that the information reported\nin Table 1 omits explanatory (i.e., Level 2) variables, as we are interested in the\n5. All spatial models reported to follow were estimated in the GeoDa program.\n6. Given the existence of spatial autocorrelation, it must be determined how to incorporate spatial\ndependence into model specification. There are two general approaches for introducing spatial\ndependence into regression models: spatial lag terms and spatial error terms. In preliminary analy-\nses, we employed a Lagrange Multiplier test to assess spatial autocorrelation, and to assess the\nexact form of spatial dependence. We find evidence of spatial autocorrelation with respect to crime\n(0j) and violence differentials (1j), and that a spatial lag model is most appropriate for modeling\nthese dependent variables.\n7. To provide some speculative information about whether the bias might affect our substantive\nresults, we also ran a latent variable regression with predictors (as shown in Osgood & Schreck,\n2007). This does not control for spatial autocorrelation, however. Even so, the results of this analysis\nare consistent with those reported here, indicating that the bias does not affect the significance of\nour key variables.\nfull variances. The ratio of the variance components for the latent variables to\ntheir standard errors must exceed 3.3 if they are to be significant at the .001\nlevel. Since the ratios for both years are 6.8 and 6.3, respectively, for 1995 and\n1996, our results show that there is significant differentiation in crime patterns\nacross neighborhoods, and that this is unlikely to have been generated by chance.\nMoreover, a comparison of the variances of the violent crime differential\nmeasures to those for overall crime rates shows that they account for a substan-\ntial portion of the overall crime rate within the average neighborhood.8\nThe variance components also speak to the degree of this systematic variation\nin the proportion of violence for a neighborhood's reported crime rate. The vari-\nance in 1995 was .54 with a standard deviation of .74. Exponentiating the standard\ndeviation indicates how much each standard deviation increase in the tendency\nfor violence multiplies the ratio of the rate of violent crime to the rate of nonvi-\nolent crime. For 1995, this meant that each standard deviation increase in the\nviolent crime differential resulted in the rate of violent offenses growing by more\nthan two for every unit increase in the rate of nonviolent offenses (exp(.74) =\nTo provide another perspective on the magnitude of differential distributions\nof violence, we report in Table 2 the average violent and nonviolent crime rates\n(per 100,000 people) for all neighborhoods based on their classification as either\n\"violent,\" \"neither violent nor nonviolent,\" or \"nonviolent\" neighborhoods.9\nHLM scores each case based on how far that neighborhood's distribution of\nviolent to nonviolent crime deviates from population base rates. Those neighbor-\nhoods with a positive score for Vio and, moreover, are one standard deviation or\ngreater from the mean are the \"violent\" neighborhoods. Neighborhoods that are\nat least one standard deviation from the mean in a negative direction are the\n\"nonviolent\" neighborhoods. The remaining cases are classified as \"neither,\"\nwith a distribution of crime generally approximating the overall distribution of\n8. Table 1 also reports reliabilities for both latent variables across each wave. The measure for over-\nall crime rates is highly reliable, exceeding .80 for both years. In contrast, the differential violence\nvariable is considerably less reliable (.50 for each wave). A measurement model approach is there-\nfore valuable with respect to addressing limited measurement reliability.\n9. The rates reported in Table 2 are not log-transformed. The rates shown here reflect the average\nrate for the violence and nonviolence items for each year.\nTable 1 Reliability and variance of overall crime rates and neighborhood violence\ndifferentials\nOverall crime rates Violence differential\nNote: Standard errors of  in parentheses.\nviolence to nonviolence. These classifications are somewhat arbitrary in that\nOsgood and Schreck's (2007) technique treats differential crime profiles as a\ncontinuous variable, but they are sufficient to provide a rough comparison of\ncrime rates. Within each category, there will not be uniformity among neighbor-\nhoods in terms of their distribution of crime.\nTable 2 reveals several interesting patterns. The neighborhoods we classified\nas \"violent\" tend to have higher crime rates across the board than the other two\ntypes of neighborhoods. That is, \"violent\" neighborhoods had high rates of\nnonviolent as well as violent crimes. Note, however, that for 1995, the ratio of\nproperty crime that the police learned about from these neighborhoods, roughly\n1.4 violent crimes were reported. The neighborhoods that tended toward\nneither violence nor nonviolence typically had a somewhat more even balance\nof violent to nonviolent crimes, and lower rates of crime overall relative to the\n\"violent\" neighborhoods. \"Nonviolent\" neighborhoods comprise the remainder\nof cases, and not only did they have the lowest rates of crime generally, the\nratio of violent to nonviolent crime distinctly favored nonviolent crimes (i.e.,\ntively). In short, as we mentioned earlier, it would be a mistake to characterize\nviolent neighborhoods as places where only violent crime takes place. Rather,\nsuch neighborhoods reveal a lot of crimes of all types; however, there is a\ndifferential clearly tending toward violence.10\nIf these results are to justify further study, then crime-type differentiation\nshould be an enduring property of the neighborhood and not a transient finding.\n10. As discussed earlier, this model detects differential crime profiles/distributions relative to popu-\nlation base rates. This means that if the modal ratio of violent to nonviolent crime was .3 to 1, then\nneighborhoods that averaged .8 violent crimes for every 1 nonviolent crime might have significantly\ndifferent profiles and therefore be deemed the relatively \"violent\" neighborhoods. This may not\nstrike some scholars as having face validity, certainly in comparison to the differential ratios that\nemerged in the current investigation. Still, because the \"average\" proportion of violence in the\ncrime rate likely varies from location to location (much like the average crime rate would), having\nsome objective scale of what constitutes relatively violent neighborhoods may be misleading. Such a\nscenario remains hypothetical, but we nonetheless urge replication of our inquiry outside Chicago in\norder to frame an empirically informed discussion of this issue.\nTable 2 Observed rates of violent and nonviolent offending, by type of neighborhood\nObserved distribution of crime rates\nYear Level of differentiation Violent Nonviolent Ratio n\nGiven that we have multiple years of crime data, we are able to examine the\nstability of these differential tendencies for violence. We obtained stability\nestimates by correlating the latent variables for overall crime and Vio with\nthemselves, and these results are reported in Table 3. Overall crime rates for\nreported levels of crime virtually identical in magnitude from one year to the\nnext. This result is consistent with those reported in the earliest literature on\nsocial disorganization (Shaw & McKay, 1942). The stability of the differential\nbetween violence and nonviolence, however, is not as well documented. Our\nresults showed that there is impressive consistency in the tendency of neighbor-\n1996 employed slightly different measures, so this correlation probably reflects\ncorrection for measurement error. Thus, not only do the \"violent neighborhood\"\ncrime ratios look remarkably similar from year to year despite some measure-\nment differences, but the neighborhoods are nicely consistent in these ratios\nover time. The remaining coefficients in Table 3 report the intercorrelation\nbetween overall crime rates and crime differentiation for both years. The strong\npositive correlation values verify what Tables 1 and 2 indicated earlier, which is\nthat neighborhoods with higher crime also tended to have an increasing prepon-\nderance of violence within their overall pattern.\nTable 4 shows how measures central to social disorganization and differential\nopportunity theories perform with respect to predicting overall (logged) crime\nrates and differential distributions of violence, net of our control for spatial\nautocorrelation. The results for the overall crime models are consistent with\nearlier work based on PHDCN data using the same or similar measures (e.g.,\nhere primarily to replicate earlier research and verify that our measures are\nperforming as expected. The coefficients in Table 4, under the \"violence differ-\nential\" columns, report the log-rate differential for violent and nonviolent\ncrime for each unit increase in the independent variable.

Again, the effects\nof the coefficients in the violence differential models are independent of over-\nall crime rates.\ntently had significant differential effects (with 1995 being a cross-sectional\nanalysis for most measures and 1996 being an analysis with lagged predictors).\nRecall that differential opportunity theory would predict that stronger social\nties within the neighborhood should produce a higher relative incidence of\nnonviolent crime, where the opposite would be true of neighborhoods where\nsuch ties were weak. Our results show that even as stronger neighborhood ties\nare associated with lower crime rates (based on the overall crime model), the\nnegative coefficient in the violence differential model means that of the crimes\nthat do take place, each unit increase in neighborhood ties corresponds with a\ngreater proportion of nonviolent crime. Greater concentrated disadvantage and\nresidential mobility should result in similarly noticeable differentials of violence\nwas associated with a greater preponderance of violence to nonviolence in a\nneighborhood's crime distribution. Residential stability, oddly, was associated\nwith violence having a greater share of the crimes in 1995, but its failure to\npredict a differential in 1996 indicates that this effect might be an artifact of\nchance. The general tenor of the results indicates that disorganized areas not\nonly have more crime, but they have more violent crime relative to property\ncrime than in organized areas. Reported crime in the more highly organized\nneighborhoods disproportionately tends to be of a nonviolent nature.

He\nargued that the disruption of this web (i.e., the interdependence of people)\nwould result in a complex and maladaptive chain of effects. Research starting\nwith that of Shaw and McKay (1942) would confirm this characterization, as\nsocial problems of almost every stripe seem to coalesce in areas of disorganiza-\ntion. Clearly then, social disorganization theory is designed to explain how\nneighborhood failure yields cascading, yet undifferentiated, varieties of hard-\nAt the same time, research far older than that of Park or Shaw and McKay\ndemonstrated that patterns of violence and nonviolence were not homogeneous\nacross areas. Later, scholars, such as Cloward and Ohlin and a string of subcul-\nture of violence theorists, would address this inconsistency and implicate\nfactors they saw as specific to explaining violence in the neighborhood. Cloward\nand Ohlin's differential opportunity theory takes the clearest position with\nrespect to the types of crimes that occur within neighborhoods, going so far as\nto argue that neighborhoods \"specialize\" in some types of crime, in much the\nsame way that individuals might.\nThe objectives of this investigation were to better understand the properties\nof differential patterns of crime across neighborhoods and to explain why\nviolence might predominate in some neighborhoods but not in others. Specifi-\ncally, we were interested in documenting the extent, stability, and antecedents\nof neighborhood crime patterns. Osgood and Schreck's (2007) statistical method\nis ideal for our purpose, as it is explicitly designed to analyze the balance of\nviolence to nonviolence independently of overall crime rates. In order to study\ncrime rates, it was necessary to modify their technique slightly in order to\naccommodate continuous interval-level data. One contribution of this research\nis thus to introduce a new statistical tool to macro-criminology, and one that is\nwell capable of addressing questions that are of substantive importance.\nUsing data from over 300 Chicago neighborhoods, we found that neighbor-\nhoods do clearly distinguish themselves based upon the types of crimes that\noccur there. Specifically, certain neighborhoods demonstrated crime rates that\nfavored violent crime with ratios that were unlikely due to chance, just as some\n11. Though the models predicting 1995 crime data are vulnerable to causal order criticisms,\nreplicating results for the lagged (1996) analysis nonetheless provide a sense of how stable the\npredictors are.\nfavored nonviolent crime significantly more so than did the \"average\" neighbor-\nhood. Moreover, there was remarkable stability in both overall crime rates and\nthe distribution of crimes taking place in these neighborhoods over the two\nyears of crime data analyzed. Neighborhoods that had a preponderance of\nAlthough future research should consider longer time windows in order to verify\nthe stability findings reported here, these results are evidence that the contrast\nof violence to nonviolence across neighborhoods is both distinct from crime\nincidence and substantively meaningful, which should open up an additional line\nof empirical inquiry with regard to neighborhoods and crime.\nThe results predicting these differential crime profiles have some interesting\ntheoretical implications. Our investigation suggests that social disorganization\nfuels both violent and nonviolent crime, attesting to the notion that the theory\ndoes have general effects on the crime rate. At the same time, however, factors\nindicative of disorganization rather clearly act as accelerants for violent offend-\ning (and less so for nonviolent crime). Social disorganization theory, as presently\nformulated, does not speak to why this might be the case. Alternatively, Cloward\nand Ohlin's differential opportunity theory, long viewed with skepticism among\nleading theorists (Hirschi, 1979; Kornhauser, 1978), generally finds support from\nthis finding. To the extent that the PHDCN's measures of disorganization imply\nweakened collective social control, our results indicate that neighborhood disor-\nganization has clearer implications for the social control of violence than for\nnonviolence. From our results, we would expect that programs designed to\nlessen social disorganization (e.g., starting neighborhood organizations) would\naddress local violence more effectively than property crime. Indeed, as social\norganization improves, there may come a point at which nonviolent crime\nbecomes the dominant crime type (in all likelihood as the levels of both decline\ngenerally).\nIf one were to interpret Cloward and Ohlin's (1960) description of a conflict\nsubculture as defined solely by violence, then this is not supported in our\nresults. The void of social organization does not impede nonviolent crime,\nperhaps because much crime does not require social networks for illegitimate\nlearning and opportunities as Cloward and Ohlin (1960) suggested (e.g.,\nGottfredson & Hirschi, 1990). Cloward and Ohlin were correct in their assertion\nthat concentrated disadvantage serves as a general risk for crime (i.e., the\ngeneralized motivation), but apparently so too does social disorganization. Still,\ntheir assertion that social disorganization has a particular tendency to foster\nand support violence to a degree greater than other crimes finds support. Given\nour focus on violence, we did not attend to their assertions regarding the other\ntwo subcultures (e.g., we did not investigate whether and why drug use might\nrepresent a unique neighborhood subculture). In order to provide a broader\ncommentary on differential opportunity as a whole, future research could\nexamine whether Cloward and Ohlin's predictions specifically hold for criminal\nand retreatist subcultures as well. This would likely be a productive direction,\nsince much literature on differential opportunity has largely lumped it in with\nstrain theories and tended to ignore the proposition that the response to strain\nis socially structured (Cullen, 1988). By revisiting the unique propositions it\noffers with regard to both the volume and type of crime across neighborhoods,\ncriminology may well find there is something to Cullen's (1988, p. 233) senti-\nment that \"Cloward and Ohlin's insights ... are much ado about something.\"\nStill, like any study, this investigation is not without limitations. Accordingly,\nwe advocate for future research on this topic, both to replicate and expand the\ncurrent inquiry. In doing so, scholars should first turn to other locations for\nresearch sites. A good portion of our theoretical and empirical knowledge about\nneighborhoods and crime stems from Chicago data and this inquiry joins that\ngroup. Thus, it is limited with regard to external validity, and, since this is the\nfirst inquiry of crime differentials with the current method, it is important to\nsee whether the results generalize to other locations and contexts. Future\nresearch can also productively expand the scope of predictor variables. Earlier,\nwe presented research on opportunity factors and crime differentials (e.g.,\nSherman et al., 1989). Future work should focus on how opportunity intersects\nwith the balance between violence and nonviolence in a neighborhood. We\nshould also note that this study has not exhausted all of the theoretical possibil-\nities for studying the unique origins of neighborhood violence, relative to other\nforms of crime. Depending on the availability of suitable data, scholars could\nderive and test additional relevant predictions from subculture of violence\nperspectives and strain theories.\nFinally, as we noted earlier, our neighborhood crime data come from official\nreports. The limitations of official data are well known but they have special\nimplications for understanding the patterning of crime within the neighbor-\nhood. For crimes to \"exist,\" at least for official purposes, someone must\nreport them to the police. Warner (1992) indicated that the reporting of prop-\nerty crime (but not violence) might depend to some degree on neighborhood\ndisorganization. We do not know if Warner's results persist in Chicago in 1995\nand 1996, largely because she indicated in her narrative that crime reporting\nmight be substantially influenced by period effects attributed to levels of\nintensified social conflict between elites and the lower classes during the\nit is noteworthy that Baumer (2002) recently illustrated that the reporting of\nviolent crime does not seem to depend on neighborhood characteristics. Neigh-\nborhood biases with respect to nonviolent crime reporting remain unknown,\nhowever. Future research should examine neighborhood crime data based upon\na broad range of aggregated self-reports of violent and nonviolent offending or\nvictimization.\nIn the end, despite these limitations, our investigation contributes to the\ndialogue of macro-level theories of crime, as well as expands knowledge about\ncrime patterns across space. It joins other work in demonstrating that there are\nnumerous dimensions of spatial crime patterns, much like there are for individ-\nual-level criminal careers (e.g., Weisburd, Bushway, Lum, & Yang, 2004). We\nhope it will spark more specific discussions and inquiries about neighborhood\ncrime profiles that extend past the frequency of crime, since this has clear\nimpact for both theory and crime control policy.\nReferences\nAnselin, L.
