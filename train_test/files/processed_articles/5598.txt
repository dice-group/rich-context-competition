Through a combination of data-intensive and\nqualitative investigations of textual data, we identify the `heritages' invoked in support\nof pro- or anti-Brexit sentiments. We show how these heritages are centred around\nmyths of origins, resistance and collapse that incorporate tensions and binary\ndivisions. We highlight the strong influence of past expert practices in shaping such\ndeeply entrenched dualistic thinking and reflect over the longue dure\n\u00b4e agency of heri-\ntage expertise. This is the first systematic study of public perceptions and experience\nof the past in contemporary society undertaken through digital heritage research\nfuelled by big data. As such, the article contributes novel methodological approaches\nand substantially advances theory in cultural heritage studies.

This\nvoting exercise became the vehicle through which, amongst other things, people\nexpressed their political identities and crafted `hoped for' political futures\n(Marichal, 2013). As such, it provides a powerful case study to examine the\nextent to which these identities are tied to the concept of the EU or to alternative\npolities and underlying ideologies.\nThe prominent role of the past in processes of identity construction and decon-\nstruction has been documented and discussed in a large corpus of literature con-\ncerned with cultural heritage studies (in relation to European identities, see e.g.\n2015). However, the ways in which ideas and materials from ancient periods are\ndrawn upon in order to define political selves and negotiate them with others in the\npublic sphere of today's increasingly Internet-pervaded and networked society\nremain largely unexplored. Yet, we argue, the pre-modern heritages of Europe\nshould be the subject of further investigation, as they permeate many aspects of\nfew examples) and constitute the origin of myth-making practices that are diffused\nwithin European territories and often extend to much of the contemporary Western\nworld.\nOur article addresses this gap, by assessing how objects, places, practices and\npeople from Iron Age to Early Medieval Britain and Europe (ca. 800 BC\u00adAD 800)\nwere leveraged by those who discussed the topic of Brexit in 364 Facebook pages\nand a total of over 1.4 million posts, comments and replies published in those\npages. We refer to these uses as the `heritages' that lie at the core of pro- or\nanti-Brexit sentiments, and demonstrate the centrality of narratives of origins,\nresistance and collapse that are played around tensions between local and global,\nindigenous and exogenous, insular and multicultural, civilisation and barbarism.\nWe draw on this analysis to show how these binaries are sometimes invoked to\nuphold opposite positions and highlight the impact of heritage practices from the\npast in shaping current dualistic thinking.\nInvestigating experiences of the past: Conceptual framework\nThe framework supporting this research rests on four main conceptual pillars that\nhave been previously but cursorily outlined in Bonacchi et al. (2016), and which are\nthus illustrated at greater length in this section. Such pillars constitute the back-\nbone of the project `Ancient Identities Today' (Ancient Identities, 2017a), funded\nby the Arts and Humanities Research Council and as part of which this study has\nbeen undertaken.\nFirst, we are working with an understanding of heritage as the processes and\noutcomes of using, experiencing and generally relating to the past in the present\n(Harrison, 2013). This is an interpretation of heritage that cuts across disciplinary\nboundaries, material and immaterial legacies, human\u00adobject relationships, natural\nand cultural heritage resources, and respects and studies their interlinking and\nentanglements. Researching contemporary heritages cannot prescind from a joint\ninvestigation of the inheritance of objects, places, practices and people from the\npast, as all or any of these can be more or less consciously encountered, selected,\nneglected or rehashed, in different ways by different stakeholders, in order to shape\nour world. Following from our understanding of heritage as process, here we focus\non examining how heritage is produced through the act of political activism per-\nformed on Facebook. Political activism enacted via social media has been the\nsubject of recent theorisation in the political sciences, with literature usually focus-\ning on assessing the effectiveness of social media to facilitate mobilisation offline\nthis article, however, we adopt a less-functionalist approach borrowed from\nMarichal's idea of `micro-activism' as the kind of political activism that takes\nplace on social media platforms (Marichal, 2013) and leads to the construction\nof `(hoped for) political identities', which may or may not result into social change.\nIn line with Marichal's view of political `micro-activism', we also understand\nFacebook as the field site from which our investigation departs, as well as a part\nof the wider public sphere of our society (Habermas, 1997; see also McKee, 2004) \u00ad\nwe will then refer to it as `Facebooksphere'.\nSecond, we note the importance of focusing on the longue dure\u00b4e when examining\nthe reception of the past, to better understand the relative values assigned to certain\nperiods and how these are opposed or equalled. This specific approach has been\nsuccessfully utilised to unpack a number of `insistent dualities' that still inform the\nways in which we live the past today (cit. Beard and Henderson, 1999; see Hingley\net al., 2018, for a full discussion of this topic).\nThird, we recognise the need to investigate the effects that diverse expert prac-\ntices are having on the construction of specific messages, their circulation, prolif-\neration and ultimate moulding into identities. How heritage values are made and\nunmade requires research on the politics of expert positions and the extent to which\nthey filter into `non-professional' actors' lives. The idea of expert practices has\nbeen developed in the context of heritage by Jones and Yarrow (2013: 22),\nto discuss how authenticity is a product of different forms of expertise that interact\nin the process of preserving the historic environment. The concept is also central to\nthe analysis of the role of what Smith and Waterton (2012: 2) have called\nAuthorised Heritage Discourse (AHD), displayed and communicated by profes-\nsionals working in the `officialdom' of research, education, museums, sites, arch-\naeological units and libraries.\nFourth, we take a `quali-quantitative' methodological approach, borrowing\nfrom the work of Venturini and Latour (2010), who use this label to express the\npotential of digital methods to suture the division between research on micro- and\nmacro-structures. Such dichotomy was created by traditional researchers in an\nanalogue world but does not exist in reality, since micro-structures and macro-\nstructures `are only two different ways of looking at the same collective canvas, like\nthe warp and weft of the social fabric'.\nMethodology\nMethods and workflows\nOur quali-quantitative data collection and analysis began with the `navigation' of big\ndata, characterised by sheer volume, velocity, variety, variability and flexibility, by\nexhaustive scope, fine-grained resolution and relational nature (Kitchin, 2013, 2014).\nIn undertaking this research, we have been confronted with the need to delve in\n`big data' using automated approaches in order to identify Facebook pages about\nBrexit, but the information contained in these pages and featuring ideas about the\npast did not possess some of the features described by Kitchin (2013, see above). Its\nvolume and velocity, for instance, were not very large, albeit probably greater than\nin most heritage studies conducted to date. Data-intensive methods were thus used\nprimarily as means of exploring Facebook as a field of ethnographic investigation\nin a non-traditional but nevertheless fully immersive manner (Hine, 2015). It is this\nimmersive and exploratory character that defines the data-intensive approaches we\nhave used as (unconventionally) ethnographic.\nAmongst social media, we chose Facebook due to its popularity across different\nsocio-demographics (Velasquez and LaRose, 2015), and for the richness of its data\nand metadata (e.g. compared to Twitter). An additional reason was that this social\nmedium allows users to set up public pages to host discussions on specific themes\nand lets researchers extract their content through its Application Programming\nInterface (API). Furthermore, according to a recent report, `approximately 63%\nof [Facebook] users acquire their news from social media, and these news stories\nundergo the same popularity dynamics as other forms of online contents' (cit. in\nDel Vicario et al., 2017). Facebook, thus, provides an ideal space for studying the\nrehashing of ideas by stakeholders and their circulation across media and plat-\nforms. As part of our ethics statement, we note that pages and messages \u00ad including\nposts, comments and replies \u00ad were accessed via the Facebook API, and mined with\nR software.\nOver the months of March and April 2017, we extracted the content of public\nFacebook pages featuring the word Brexit in their title or description and contain-\n(Table 1, online Appendix). 6 May 2010 was the day of the General Election\nthat led to the establishment of the Coalition government, during which the\noption of a possible referendum on the UK's membership in the EU was first\nproposed. We used a set of 569 period-specific keywords relating to Iron Age,\nRoman and Early Medieval places and people of Britain, in order to locate mes-\nsages that would be likely to reference the aforementioned pasts in the context of\nBrexit. These keywords included the names of Iron Age tribes and chiefs, Roman\nemperors and Anglo-Saxon kings, Roman towns, Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon\nsettlements in Britain, as well as general terms describing the period from 800\nBC to AD 800. A full list of the keywords that were used is made available\nonline (Ancient Identities, 2017b) and was compiled via desktop research and\nvetted through history and archaeology handbooks and listings of sites provided\nby heritage organisations such as English Heritage, Historic Scotland and Cadw.\nThe posts, comments and replies identified in this way were then verified manually.\nIn the first phase of the analysis, we examined the metadata of the 364 Facebook\npages about Brexit that had been previously extracted, to understand the motiv-\nations behind their set up and the context of their use; this metadata consisted of\nID (unique numeric value), About (short introduction), Category, Description,\nGeneral Info, Likes, Link (associated with the page), City, State, Country,\nLatitude, Longitude, Name, Talking About, Username and Website.\nSubsequently, we created a corpus composed of all the posts, comments and replies\nfrom the 364 Facebook pages and performed topic modelling to uncover the\nhidden thematic structure of the corpus. This method has been successfully\nemployed before to map out the content of large collections of documents, includ-\ning historical sources (Newman and Block, 2006; Yang et al., 2011), social media\ninteractions (e.g. Marwick, 2013) or scholarly blogging platforms (Puschmann and\nBastos, 2015), without using a priori categories. In particular, we applied Latent\nDirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular probabilistic topic modelling algorithm\nthat, for each of a pre-determined and optimal number of topics, outputs a set\nof words accompanied by values that represent the probability of each word to be\nassociated with the given topic (Blei et al., 2010, 2003). The model was executed\nusing the Python Natural Language Toolkit and Gensim library (Rehurek and\nSojka, 2010), and the optimal number of topics was estimated to be 25 by calculat-\ning topic coherence scores as described in Ro\n\u00a8 der et al. (2015). Topics were labelled\nindependently by the authors and then discussed and agreed; each label was\nassigned so that it would describe the overall association of the 20 terms with\nthe highest probability scores.\nWe repeated topic modelling on the subset of data containing the 569 period-\nspecific keywords (also referred to as `data subset', from now on) and compared the\n21 topics detected in this smaller dataset to the 15 featuring in the Brexit\nFacebooksphere as a whole. Thereafter, we calculated term frequencies and carried\nout association analysis (0.30 < coefficient) for the data subset, in order to under-\nstand how the past was called upon, which ideas were recurring more frequently\nand any related concepts. Messages containing keywords about the Iron Age,\nRoman and Early Medieval periods were not posted by a handful of individuals\nand the great majority of posters were `mono-posters' (2528 messages with past\nspecific keywords were written by 1909 users). Most users posted only one message,\nwhile 279 users posted more than one message and only 26 more than five mes-\nsages. We also discovered that most messages were posted only once, with only 86\nout of 2528 messages posted more than once and up to 15 times (in one case only).\nGiven the low number of multi-posters and multi-posted messages and their min-\nimal impact on the analysis, no filters were applied to account for them.\nFinally, we undertook qualitative analysis to gain in-depth knowledge of rele-\nvant messages and the influence of heritage expert practices on the discussion. All\nthe messages containing the most recurring past-specific terms were examined via\nclose reading. The thematic threads identified in this way (myths) are presented in\nthe `Myths and dualities' section and exemplified via relevant extracts chosen for\ntheir significance. These extracts have been contextualised as much as possible, with\ninformation about the author, the page where they were posted and the thread to\nwhich they belonged (if any). Deeper grounding could only be provided through\nfurther and smaller scale investigations such as posting an anonymous survey on all\nor a sample of the Facebook pages, or conducting offline ethnographic research\nwith the Brexit-related groups that have a presence beyond the Facebooksphere;\nthis work, however, transcends the scope of this paper and the space allowed, thus\nwe aim to integrate it in future.1\nThe Brexit Facebooksphere: Context of study\nWe worked to characterise the Brexit Facebooksphere by investigating how and\nwhy this space was set up by collectives and individuals. Half of the pages were\ncreated by groups already established offline and variously built around shared\nplace, party, institutional affiliation, job, related interests, social concerns, nation-\nality and voting preference (Table 2, online Appendix). The majority of these\ngroups were based in Britain and this fact, together with the languages used to\ncommunicate (Table 3, online Appendix), suggests interactions involving primarily\n\u00ad although not exclusively \u00ad UK-based social actors. Additionally, it indicates that,\nfor the most part, the Facebooksphere of Brexit was tightly connected with mobil-\nisation undertaken offline. Since Facebook-enabled and in-person activism seem to\nbe interlinked, there might be continuity in the ways in which the past is leveraged\nand heritage is produced within and beyond Facebook pages. This is not to say that\nthis analysis is formally representative of the `population' of activists involved in\nBrexit referendum discussions, but that some of the repertoires that we will exam-\nine are certainly not confined to social media; rather, they are variously embedded\nin the cultures of some of the communities located in the four UK countries of\nEngland, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nBased on the qualitative analysis of the metadata available, we studied the main\nreasons why individuals and the aforementioned groups created Facebook pages\nfocusing on Brexit (Tables 4 and 5, online Appendix). From these, 67 out of the\n209 pages containing messages that featured period-specific keywords were estab-\nlished for the purpose of campaigning for either the Leave or Remain camp,\nwhereas 52 pages intended to provide news without taking sides. Substantially\nlower is the number of pages that used the Brexit label to brand and market a\nproduct, or those that wished to present and debate specific initiatives, provide a\nspace for general discussion or for humour and satire. This motivational horizon\nshows how the creators of these Facebook pages understood the latter's role in the\nconstruction of political identities. In most cases, Facebook was used to illustrate\nand support existing ideas and projects; others turned to it to create a genuinely\nneutral and democratic arena to acquire and respond to any information provided\nabout the referendum and participate in dialogue. The Brexit Facebooksphere thus\ncomprises but does not only consist of pages that are dedicated to host exchanges\nof views and opinions. This is in line with the general findings of Del Vicario et al.\n(2017), who studied the interaction of one million Facebook users with Brexit-\nrelated posts from January to July 2016, and identified the existence of two distinct\nand separate groups acting as echo chambers and holding different perceptions of\nthe same topics.\nThe past in the Brexit Facebooksphere\nTopics\nThe topic modelling of all the messages extracted from Brexit-focused Facebook\npages shows that discussions in the Facebooksphere covered subjects ranging\nwidely from social welfare to the economy, international relations, mobility, other-\nness and (in)security; assessments of the costs and benefits of the referendum; and\nvoting procedures (Figure 1 and Table 6, online Appendix). Differently, the the-\nmatic structure of the period-specific data subset was less varied and centred on\nmobility, origins, identity, cultural tension, security and nationalism (Figure 2 and\nTable 7, online Appendix).\nThe past was leveraged in relation to certain issues more than others, and espe-\ncially to the movement of people, their subsequent interactions and the threats and\nopportunities caused by these dynamics in terms of identity and law and order.\nMobility is the thematic origin and trigger of the heritages of Brexit and one of the\ncontemporary issues to which Western societies relate by drawing upon the past\nAmongst the keywords that were used, the ones recurring more frequently in the\ndata subset of 2529 posts, comments and replies are Roman, britannia and barbar\n(featuring at least 300 times), followed by hadrian (appearing 200 times), and\nmediev and norman (present 100 times) (Table 8, online Appendix). These results\nhighlight the prominence of ideas related to the Roman period compared to the\nFigure 2.

Terms on the right-hand side relate to the selected\ntopic. For an interactive version of this Figure, see the online Appendix.\nFigure 1.

The word Roman, in particular, appeared only once in the majority\nof messages that contained it (249) and is associated with terms expressing power\ndynamics (e.g. inferior, superior) or related to mobility and discrimination (e.g.\nxenofobia, discrimin, racism, jute), militarisation, occupation and resistance (e.g.\noccupi, soldier, victori, coloni, armi, conquer, defend) (Table 9, online Appendix).\nConsistently, Britannia is associated with words from the song Rule, Britannia!,\nwhich features often in the corpus (Table 9, online Appendix). This is a patriotic\nsong derived from a poem by James Thomson, which was set to music in 1740, and\nopposes the freedom of Britannia and Britons to the situation of nations governed\nby envious tyrants. The latter have been interpreted by some as a reference to the\nabsolutism that was still characterising European monarchies in the 18th century,\nwhereas Britain had already curbed royal prerogative and developed a constitu-\ntional democracy. Furthermore, according to Armitage (2000: 173), the song was\nan expression of the ideas behind the British Empire `predicated on a mixture of\nadulterated mercantilism, nationalistic anxiety and libertarian fervour'. Today,\nmost citizens are not perhaps aware of these historical roots, but remain conscious\nof the strong nationalistic meaning of the song, so that the prominent use of the\nword Britannia in the context of nationalist hymning can be interpreted as estab-\nlishing a direct link between the ancient identity of the Roman province and ideas\nof British imperialism, independence and economic success.\nMyths and dualities\nIn order to more closely qualify how Roman times were called upon, we proceeded\nwith a qualitative exploration of the subset of data containing the keyword Roman.\nThis analysis was aimed at exploring the diversity of ways in which the period\nunder examination was leveraged. The research revealed the centrality and frequent\nrecurrence of a parallel drawn between the EU and the Roman Empire and of three\nmain myths, constructed through binaries that, for the most part, contrast the\nRoman Empire to other periods and polities.\n1. Myths of origin. The first myth of origin leverages the Roman past along the\nlines of Kristian Kristiansen's conceptualisation of European origins (1996). The\nnarrative is focused on the civilising power of the Roman Empire (equalled to\nthe EU), invoked within the pro-remain camp to support the UK's membership\nin the EU. For example, a user writes on the pro-leave page `Pro Britain' that:\n`Well, if it wan't for the Roman empire, you would ve be still barbarians living in\nhuts, still pillaging between ur selves, still in stone age! You say you invented the\ngentleman? That a joke! [. . .]!'\nThis idea is likely to be originally rooted in academic thinking and literature pre-\nthose pro-leavers who stress that the process of Romanisation of Britain, often\nportrayed as pacific and beneficial, was actually characterised by violence and\noppression. To build this argument, a user mentions the Roman occupation\ntogether with Norman invasions, showing how very different realities and past\nsituations can be juxtaposed to back narratives that are already present in the\nmind of an individual. In particular, he writes the following sarcastic post, as a\nreply to a message made public by the pro-remain page `Very British Problems' on\n`Mayhem government using tried and tested methods to maintain the purity of\nBrexit Britain':\nGoing back to the original post, I love your description of our ``cultural enrichment''\nat the hands of the Romans and Normans, though I doubt few of the contemporary\ninhabitants would have seen it that way. [. . .] first the Romans turn up with some\nreally nice homemade biccies and a big slice of rape and murder. . .things pick up a\nlittle later when the Normans arrive with a cheeky red and a nice dose of oppression,\nwhilst stirring up racial hatred between the Celts and non Celtic people's that still\nhasn't receded to this day. . . [. . .] If you're going to make the case for the EU, it's\nprobably best NOT to mention Britain's history with Europe!\nDifferently, the second myth of origin that emerges from the data subset identifies\nthe indigenous origin of Britain in the barbaric peoples who came before or after\nthe establishment of the Roman province of Britannia. When the roots of the\nnation are placed in the post-Roman period, English, British and Celtic identities\nfeature, and the first two are often in opposition to each other. This is exemplified\nby the words of a user who replied to a Mail Online article entitled `Teeth\nchecks make me ashamed to be British, says Diane Abbott: MPs accuse Shadow\nHome Secretary of being out of touch with voters following her comments'\n(Brown, 2016), which was posted on the page `Brexit News'. Commenting on\nAbbot, the user said:\nShe is not british tho she is african british. She is a migrants or the descendent of a\nmigrant, she has no say on britian. Only the descendent of those who build this nation\nup from the fall of the Roman Empire have a say. We are called native brits.\nEmphasis on pre-Roman origins is also evidenced in the data subset, as in the case\nof a contributor, who was replying to a post published on the page `Pro Great\nBritain' about Farage supposedly celebrating as Juncker admitted Britain was `in\ncontrol': `Smoke and mirrors bullshit from Junckers. RULE BRITANNIA! We\nfucked off the Romans, (eventually, have to say), Made the French/Viking/\nNorsemen Normans, change their names and get Anglicisised, to proper English\nnames. [. . .]' A third myth stresses the mixed and, in the words of one of the\nparticipants in the Facebook discussions, `non-pure' origins of Britain, and is\nused to support the Remain position, as in the example below.\nEngland was a microcosm of Europe even in those early days. Britons were of Greek\ndescent, Welsh, Irish were also part Greek and Scythian. Scots picts, were remnants of\nScythia, even as their name reads. Danes, Saxons, Normans, Angles, from Germanic\nheartlands, and northern Skane naval lands. Romans founded Londinium.\nThis text was posted as a reply to the only post in the whole of the data subset\ncontaining period-specific keywords that quoted an article specifically about heri-\ntage. The latter focused on the Anglo-Saxons and was written by the historical\nfiction writer Martin Wall (2016) in the BBC History Magazine. It was utilised to\nreiterate and \u00ad via selective referencing \u00ad support a narrative about British and\nCelts being indigenous people. The article is referenced to back the idea of Anglo-\nSaxons as conquerors, in opposition to the native `British' population, but the\nauthor only draws on those parts of the text that back his thesis. For example,\nhe ignores the passage stressing the possibility that Anglo-Saxons might have been\ninitially invited by the local population to help fighting the Picts, or that Anglo-\nSaxon tribes frequently fought among themselves.\n2. Myths of resistance. Myths of resistance characterise both the EU and Roman\nEmpire as dominant polities that deprive populations of their freedom, some-\ntimes also compared to Nazi Germany. An Indonesian national living in\nWashington, for example, explained the reasons behind Brexit by posting, on\nthe page `Pro Great Britain', a message stating that `Exit is the only solution'\nafter Britain has been `bullied to join this ``roman empire'' with no constitution\nin place yet'. In another case, a user replied to a post referencing the Sunday\nExpress article entitled `Bratislava 2016: ``Show some respect'' Hungary blasts\nEU for deceiving nations with ``tricks''` (Kegl, 2016), with these words:\nIf the people of the 27 countries don't react soon they are going to find themselves\nliving in a Dictatorship ruled over by a select few bent on personal power and wealth.\nReminds me of the Roman Empire or should I say `The Fourth Rike'.\nThe authors of these Facebook messages see the Brexit referendum as an oppor-\ntunity to resist by voting Leave, and, in some cases, Boudica or (retrospectively) the\nBritish Empire are invoked also as symbols of such resistance to Rome and the EU:\n[. . .] I understand it is now clear that the New Roman Empire has Invaded Britain and\nwhole British Empire and hence Commonwealth was formed by our ancestors in fear\nof this situation. It is history of British Commonwealth, which was formed to meet the\ndemand of WW2 to survive against European invasion. [. . .] [User from London\ncommenting on a post by Brexit News on `High court ruling puts Brexit in the\nbalance'].\n3. Myths of collapse. Myths of collapse revolve around the idea of the `fall' of the\nRoman Empire/EU or Britain, if the latter remains in the EU. Here we find a\nchoice of terminology (e.g. fall, collapse) that aligns with interpretations of the\npassage from the Roman to the post-Roman period as a break, and, in places,\nechoes the title of Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the\nRoman Empire (1789). The reasons that are mentioned as the possible causes for\nthis `fall', however, are varied and include migrations and integration of bar-\nbarian/foreign peoples (as Gibbon's thesis also argued), the fact that empires are\nnaturally destined to end, expansionism, economic decline, centralisation, bur-\neaucracy and excessive regulation. Myths of collapse are mostly, but not exclu-\nsively, used to support pro-Leave positions. For example, a pro-leave user\ncomments in these terms on a post by Pro Great Britain that reports the results\nof a YouGov poll on whether Britain's decision to leave the EU had been right\nor wrong: `The Roman Empire collapsed as hordes of barbarians assimilated\ninto their culture - the Franks, the Visigoths, the Vandals etc etc And now\nhordes of coarse barbarians from the East are arriving into the UK every\nweek.' As for some of the previous myths, parallels are often extended to\nother polities besides the Roman Empire and the EU. Again, this shows that\ncomparable images and situations are searched across centuries and juxtaposed\nvery simply (simplistically?), by both Brexiteers and Remainers:\nAnyone who voted to remain and still crying, should remember throughout history,\nall empires were built to fall. Being British we should know that better than most.\n(Remember the Roman Empire? USSR?). [Post of a self-declared leave campaigner,\npublished in the page `Pro Great Britain']\nHowever after a few centuries of Britain, Brexit will be the turning point of the final\nchapter of the UK. I believe that Britain like the Habsburg Empire, Yugoslavia,\nUSSR, the Ottoman or Byzantine or Roman Empire, is on its final chapter. Brexit\nwill bring a gradual economic decline, followed by secession of Scotland, NI,\nGibraltar and finally Wales, so England itself will eventually return to the EU and\njoin the Eurozone before 2030. [Greek national commenting on a post published on\nthe page `Brexit' about the possible end of the EU as a result of a `bomb effect'\ntriggered by Brexit]\nDiscussion\nThe analysis undertaken in this paper has shown the role of discourse around the\npre-Roman, Roman and post-Roman world in the making of political identities\nrelated to Brexit and the centrality of notions of imperialism in this context. These\nfindings resonate with the part that the above-mentioned periods have played in the\nvery formation of the EU. As noted by Hingley, for example, the idea of the EU\nhas drawn extensively on that of the Roman Empire, especially as regards the\npursuing of frontier integration and multiculturalism (Hingley, 2018; Hingley\net al., 2018). Furthermore, the study has offered supporting evidence for the\nhypothesis proposed by Andrew Gardner (2017), that a relation exists between\nthe void left by the end of the British Empire, the rejection of Britishness, the\nembracing of regional identities that roughly overlap with those of pre-Roman\nlocal groupings and the choice to vote for Brexit. This tension between supra-\nnational structures and regional ones lies at the core of the ways in which individ-\nuals and groups relate to the past in order to address social issues today.\nThe friction between global and local realities is connected with a number of\nother `insistent dualities' that are invoked in political micro-activism performed on\nsocial media. As explained in a previous article (Hingley et al., 2018), the concept of\n`insistent dualities' refers to all those oppositions through which the past can be\ninterpreted by contemporary stakeholders. It is a notion framed by Beard and\nHenderson (1999) in relation to Boudica/Boadicea and the ways in which the\nRoman occupation of Britain has been perceived. In particular, the authors ask\nwhether Roman Britain is `Roman or native', `British or foreign', `part of the\nseamless web of our island story or an ignominious period of enemy occupation',\n`the origins of (European) civilization on our shores, or an unpleasant, artificial\nintrusion that actually managed to postpone (British) civilization for almost a\nOur analysis has revealed how dualities concerning civilisation and barbarism,\nindigenous and exogenous, cultural integration and insularity are utilised to shape\npolitical identities in the context observed. These binaries are leveraged to mould\nthe three myths \u00ad of origin, resistance and collapse \u00ad through which people support\ntheir positions on Brexit and on mobility and border control more at large. These\nmyths are frequently leveraged to back opposed views in very simple terms, and\noften extending parallels and comparisons to more recent periods. The pattern of\nframing the present by drawing on multiple periods simultaneously confirms the\nvalidity of the longue dure\u00b4e approach that informs this research, and that it is\ncrucial to study public experiences of the past without regarding the latter as a\nclosed and packaged entity relegated to distant dimensions.\nThe myths that characterise the ways in which the ancient world features in\ndiscussions about Brexit seem to have been fed and nurtured by past expert prac-\ntices in the arenas of education, media and communication and heritage (the AHD\nmentioned at the beginning). The very prominence of the Roman world, compared\nto the Iron Age period or, to a lesser extent, the Middle Ages, is likely to rest on the\nhigh visibility that has been given to it in the National Curriculum for schools in\nEngland (Hingley et al., 2018). In fact, the idea of the Roman Empire, its forma-\ntion, development and `end' has been discussed as tightly linked to the destiny of\nthe EU in archaeological, and other social science literature, but the same has\nhappened for the Holy Roman Empire. The latter, for example, has been identified\nby some commentators in the political sciences and historical disciplines as com-\nparable to the EU due to its permeable frontiers, polycentric government and\nNevertheless, it appears only very seldom in the data subset we analysed.\nFrom 1989 onwards, the National Curriculum in England has also contributed\nto characterise the Roman Empire as both an invader and a strong and civilising\nmilitary power that has brought progress and advancement to Britain, thus\nrestating an idea of Roman origins that has had some currency since at least the\nVictorian and Edwardian period (Hingley, 2000; Hingley et al., 2018). Over the dec-\nades, the factual end of television programming has massively built on a widely\ndiffused idea of the Roman world as positive and beneficial, proposing programmes\nand series that align with this image and further reinforce it (Hingley et al., 2018). We\nhave encountered the reception of televised discourse, for example in relation to the\nseries `What the Romans Did for Us' (Wilkinson, 2001), which was mentioned as\nsupporting evidence for pro-Remain positions. Education, in turn, is often largely\ninfluenced by the AHD that is palpable through museum displays, on-site interpret-\nations and educational talks given to school pupils (Sharpe, 2017) \u00ad to name but a few\nexamples. These narratives tend towards stasis rather than swift adaptation, and often\nend up communicating the results of outdated interpretations of the past. It is thus not\nsurprising that the National Curriculum is still constructed on the notion of\nRomanisation, despite the critique to which the latter has been subject for over\nthree decades, as a result of post-colonialist reflections (Hingley et al., 2018).\nAs a way forward, we suggest the myths and repertoires of images and symbols we\nhave exposed can be used to facilitate dialogue between heritage `professionals' and\ncitizens over the meanings of the past and their implications in relation to issues of\nautonomy, mobility and border control. This is a kind of communication that res-\nonates with both rationality- and emotion-driven decision-making processes in what\nhas been recently defined a `post-truth society'. The use of the term post-truth peaked\nprecisely in 2016, concomitantly with the Brexit referendum and the US Presidential\nelections; it describes people's tendency to rely strongly on peer-to-peer communica-\ntions enabled by social media, basing their choices on beliefs more than `facts'\n(Higgins, 2016; Oxford Dictionaries, 2017). The myths that are typically used to\nconstruct and express political identities in national or supranational (European)\nterms possess an immediacy that can be quickly evoked. At the same time, the very\nfactthatthemyths wehaveencounteredaresolidlygroundedin expertpracticesof the\npast paradoxically contrasts with the idea of a loss of faith in expert and authoritative\nknowledge, to the point of challenging the very validity of post-truth as a notion.\nConclusions\nThe analysis presented in these pages should not be considered as necessarily\nlimited to Facebook, because it shows strong connections with some of the\nplaces and regions of Britain and with groups that operate in those areas. Brexit-\nrelated discussions on Facebook have drawn on landmarks such as Hadrian's Wall,\nand fully unleashed their multiple values as both natural and cultural, tangible and\nintangible, object- and practice-centred heritages. Our research has then empha-\nsised the viability of the concept of `context of heritage production', as the kind of\nhuman activity, here exemplified by political activism, that can potentially unfold\nacross both online and offline fields. The adoption of this concept and of quality-\nquantitative methodologies allows scoping dynamics regarding the public experi-\nence of the past that may also continue in those parts of our everyday lives where\nthe Internet is absent. On- and off-line, ideas tied to the Roman past and imperi-\nalism have been leveraged to frame `simple' myths of origin, resistance and collapse\nin support of either or both of the pro-leave and pro-remain camps. Materials,\npractices and places from the ancient past are linked to modern times and used to\ndiscuss matters that relate to identity and otherness in ways that reveal the longue\ndure\u00b4e impact of past heritage expertise.\nAuthors' Contributions\nCB designed research; CB and MK performed research; CB, MA and MK analysed data;\nand CB wrote the paper.\n"
