    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Prior research has demonstrated that adolescent delinquency and depression are prospectively related to adult alcohol use and\nthat adolescent religiosity may influence these relationships. However, such associations have not been investigated using person-centered\napproaches that provide nuanced explorations of these constructs. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult\nHealth, we examined whether adolescent delinquency and depression differentiated typologies of adult alcohol users and whether these\nrelationships varied across religiosity profiles. Three typologies of self-identified Christian adolescents and 4 types of adult alcohol users were\nidentified via latent profile analysis. Delinquency and depression were related to increased likelihood of membership in heavy drinking or\nproblematic alcohol use profiles, but this relationship was most evident among those likely to be involved in religious practices. These results\ndemonstrate the importance of person-centered approaches in characterizing the influences of internalizing and externalizing behaviors on\nsubsequent patterns of alcohol use.\n",

Excessive alcohol use has been cor-\nrelated with 200 other health problems, and deaths involving\nalcohol use are the fourth leading preventable cause of death\nin the United States.2,3 In addition, early initiation into alco-\nhol use is related to increased likelihood of heavy drinking\nand alcohol-related problems.4 As such, identifying behavio-\nral antecedents in adolescence, a developmental period in\nwhich alcohol initiation frequently occurs, has particular\nimportance for preventing the development of problematic\nalcohol use. Research that establishes identifiable behavioral\nantecedents to alcohol use in adolescence, and in turn distin-\nguishes those most at risk of developing subsequent alcohol-\nrelated problems, may lead to preemptive interventions that\nprevent escalation into problematic drinking.\nPathways to alcohol use\nRobust evidence for 2 distinct but related behavioral path-\nways to alcohol use has emerged within the literature. The\nfirst, an externalizing pathway, is characterized by impulsive,\nantisocial, and/or delinquent behavior and is posited to result\nfrom behavioral undercontrol or dysregulation.4,5 Such con-\nduct is presumed to be some of the first behaviorally mala-\ndaptive correlates of later substance use. Indeed, previous\nresearch demonstrates that childhood and early adolescent\nexternalizing problems are predictive of an earlier initiation\ninto substance use,6 late adolescent alcohol use,7 and alcohol\ndependence in young adulthood.8 Specifically, delinquent\nbehavior is frequently antecedent to substance use, suggesting\nthat adolescents may typically begin to use alcohol only after\nprevious engagement in delinquent activity; longitudinal\nstudies have further substantiated this temporal ordering.9,10\nThus, previous research suggests not only that delinquency\nand alcohol use are correlated but also that delinquency is\noften temporally precedent to alcohol use.\nAn alternate, internalizing pathway to alcohol use, wherein\nindividuals use alcohol as a purported means of coping with\nsymptoms of negative emotionality and behavioral inhibition,\nhas also been reflected in the literature.11 Prospective analyses\npoint to positive associations between major depressive disor-\nder at age 11 and the initiation and regular use of alcohol by\nage 14.5 In addition, a cross-lagged panel analysis designed to\nexplore direction of causation suggested that depression at age\n12 was positively associated with alcohol use at age 15, but that\nthe reverse did not hold true.12 Moreover, the influence of ado-\nlescent internalizing problems on alcohol use appears to persist\ninto adulthood, but with different effects.
