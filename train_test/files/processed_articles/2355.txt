A wide range of acute medical\noutcomes in cocaine-exposed and nonexposed infants, in-\ncludingsociodemographiccircumstancesandpolydruguse,\nwere assessed in infants recruited at these sites. Acute ma-\nternal pregnancy outcomes in these cohorts have already\nbeen reported.42 This report presents identified associa-\ntions between cocaine exposure during pregnancy and\nmedical conditions in the newborn infant from birth\nthrough hospital discharge or death.\nMETHODS\nRecruitment and screening occurred during a 2-year period at\n4 centers: Brown University, Providence, RI; the University of\nMiami, Miami, Fla; the University of Tennessee, Memphis; and\nWayne State University, Detroit, Mich. Informed maternal con-\nsent and institutional review board approval were required for\nparticipation. Reasons for noneligibility and nonenrollment are\nlisted in Figure 1. Mothers who consented were more likely\nand to have a history of drug use (13.0% vs 9.3%). Mothers who\nidentified themselves as white consented equally often (44.4%\nvs 44.9%) while those who responded that they were of \"other\"\nrace consented at lower rates (5.1% vs 8.6%). Differences in\npreterm delivery rate, abruptio placentae, prenatal care, and use\nof Medicaid between those who consented and those who did\nnot were small. All low-birth-weight infants (1500 g) were\nscreened. Maternal and infant charts were reviewed to iden-\ntify obvious protocol exclusions. Informed consent was usu-\nally obtained before or within 24 hours of delivery.\nInitial screening included the mother's labor and delivery\nrecord, the newborn admission record, and a meconium sample.\nA detailed drug use questionnaire that addressed the mother's\nuse of nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, opiates, and other\nillicit drugs was given by research staff trained and certified in\nthe reliable administration of all the study interviews. A De-\npartment of Health and Human Services Certificate of Confi-\ndentiality allowed for strict confidentiality regarding all drug\nuse information, including the 2 states (Florida and Rhode Is-\nland) that had mandatory reporting statutes. The certificate did\nnot, however, circumvent required reporting of child abuse,\nsexual abuse, or neglect.\nAlthough recruitment addressed exposure to cocaine and/or\nopiates, all analyses presented herein are limited to the cocaine-\nonly and the non\u00adcocaine-exposed cohorts.\nCocaine exposure was defined by maternal admission of co-\ncaine use at any time during this pregnancy or a positive enzyme-\nmultiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) screen for cocaine\nmetabolites in the infant's meconium, confirmed by gas chro-\nmatography\u00admass spectroscopy, coupled with a negative EMIT\nscreen for opiates. All analyses were performed by a central labo-\nratory (El Sohly Laboratories Inc, Oxford, Miss)43 after in-\nformed consent was obtained. A history of cocaine use re-\ncorded in the medical record was not sufficient to qualify as\nexposed. Mothers who denied use, but in whom the infant's me-\nconium EMIT screen was positive and gas chromatography\u00ad\nmass spectroscopy analysis was not available, were excluded.44\nA nonexposure designation required both a maternal denial of\nuse and a negative result of meconium screening. There were\n3183 infants of consenting mothers whose exposure could not\nbe determined primarily because of lack of gas chromatography\u00ad\nmass spectroscopy confirmation. This included 2760 in whom\nmeconium was unavailable, 254 in whom the quantity of me-\nconium collected was insufficient for any analysis, and 169 with\na positive EMIT screen but who had insufficient amounts of me-\nconium for gas chromatography\u00admass spectroscopy confirma-\nCocaine\nOpiates\n(Only and\nUncertain\nCocaine)\nNonexposed\nCocaine\nOnly\nCocaine and\nOpiates\nCocaine,\nUncertain\nOpiates\nNoneligible\nUnlikely to Survive\nMultiple Gestation\nOutborn\nMother Institutionalized\nMother With Psychosis\nNonenrolled\nReason Unknown\nMother Refused Consent\nExposure Indeterminate\nMeconium Not Available\nor Amount Inadequate\nNo GC/MS Confirmation\nor Consent Withdrawn\nMother Unavailable\nLanguage Problem\nSibling in a Research\nStudy\nMothers Consenting and Enrolled\nMothers Consenting With Known Exposure\nMother/Infant Dyads Screened\nMothers Eligible for Enrollment\nFigure 1.

Those mothers excluded because of indeterminate ex-\nposure were less likely to be black (47.5% vs 51.6%), were more\nlikely to be married (40.7% vs 36.6%), and had a higher rate of\npreterm birth (7.8% vs 5.7%). As with mothers who refused con-\nsent, there were no important differences in their Medicaid in-\nsurance status, rate of prenatal care, or prevalence of abruptio\nplacentae. Of the total 1072 infants with known exposure to co-\n(Figure 1). The remaining cocaine-exposed infants were ex-\ncluded as indeterminate. Use of alcohol, marijuana, and/or nico-\ntine during pregnancy occurred in both groups (95% of those\nexposed, 42% of those nonexposed).\nA standardized physical and neurologic examination, made\nup of 62 specific items and including the New Ballard Score,45\nwas performed within the first 24 hours of life by centrally trained\nand certified examiners from each site, who were masked to\nexposure status. Birth weight, length, and head circumference\nwere measured and recorded. These same certified research per-\nsonnel observed the \"acute\" course of these infants, which in-\ncluded the time from birth to infant death or discharge from\nthe hospital. Seventy-seven individual conditions and/or diag-\nnoses were recorded during the hospitalization. Detailed in-\nformation on therapies, procedures, resuscitation, the length\nof stay, child protective services reporting, and proposed liv-\ning situation was also collected. Information on medications\nadministered to the mothers at delivery and complications of\nlabor and delivery were assessed and reported previously.42\nTo compensate for and to protect against inflated type I er-\nror levels that may be caused by multiple comparisons, we de-\ncided a priori to report P.01 as significant in these analyses.\nIn addition, to reduce the number of reported outcomes and\nto eliminate redundancy, information from multiple sources\nwas combined where this was deemed clinically valid, and out-\ncomes with a prevalence of less than 1% in the nonexposed co-\nhort and that had no occurrence in the cocaine-exposed co-\nhort were dropped but are listed in the appropriate table\nfootnotes. Outcome data were summarized by exposure groups,\nusing frequency distributions (2 tests) or means and stan-\ndard deviations (unpaired 2-tailed t tests) when appropriate.\nThe estimated odds ratios and 99% confidence intervals are pre-\nsented as a summary of the unadjusted relationship between\ncocaine-exposure status and each outcome.\nStatistically significant (P.01) bivariate associations were\nsubjected to multivariate modeling to obtain covariate-\nadjusted estimates. Linear and logistic regression models were\nfitted for continuous and binary outcomes, respectively. A stan-\ndard set of 10 covariates plus cocaine use, chosen a priori for\nall multivariate analyses, was as follows: clinical site; race or\nethnicity; sex; birth weight; being small for gestational age; the\nuse of alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana during pregnancy; ma-\nternal age; and maternal education. Tobacco exposure was cat-\negorized at 3 levels as high use (0.5 pack per day), low use\n(any other use), and no use. Alcohol was categorized into 3\ngroups: alcohol use with bingeing, nonbingeing alcohol use,\nand no alcohol use. Marijuana was entered as a simple yes-no\nuse variable. Race or ethnicity of the mother was based on self-\nidentification as black, Hispanic, or white/other. Maternal age\nwas based on whether the mother was 26 years or older, or\nyounger than 26 years, at the time of delivery. Maternal edu-\ncation (12 years or 12 years) was considered a surrogate\nfor socioeconomic status. Being small for gestational age was\nentered into the model to adjust for the enhanced effect of low\nbirth weight seen primarily in the near-full-term subjects in the\nstudy. Being small for gestational age was based on a birth weight\nof less than 10th percentile for gestational age.46\nRESULTS\nsented (Figure 1). Meconium was analyzed in 8804 in-\nMeconium quantity was insufficient for any screening\nfirm a positive EMIT screen; no meconium was col-\nlected in 169 infants, and 1 mother withdrew consent.\nMaternal self-report alone identified 7.5% of infants as\ncocaine exposed, and meconium analysis identified a 5.0%\nexposure rate (Table 1). The total cocaine-exposure rate\nwas 9.1%. Meconium analysis identified an additional 190\nTable 1.

The exposure rate in the low-\nbirth-weight population (2500 g) was more than double\nthat of normal-birth-weight infants (16.7% vs 6.7%). Of\nmothers who admitted cocaine use during pregnancy, me-\nconium testing was confirmatory in 66.2% of the cases\nwhere both meconium and self-report were available. Be-\ncause maternal admission alone was sufficient to define\nan infant as exposed, meconium screens and confirma-\ntions were not run on all of these infants. However, as\nnoted already, an additional 1.6% of exposed infants,\nwhose mothers denied use during pregnancy, were iden-\ntified by meconium analysis.\nThe 717 infants identified as exposed to cocaine only\nhort (Table 2). The prevalence of prematurity (37\nweeks' gestation) was significantly greater in the cocaine-\nexposed cohort.\nTable 3 lists the prevalence of specific physical find-\nings and physiological observations assessed during the\ninitial infant examination, as well as diagnoses and/or con-\nditions observed during hospitalization. Abnormal physi-\ncal findings were rare, with only tachypnea exceeding a\n5% prevalence in either group. Two observations (flat phil-\ntrum and tachypnea) were significantly more frequent\nin the exposed cohort, but not after adjusting for covar-\niates in a multivariable logistic regression model. The di-\nagnoses of respiratory distress\u00adtransient tachypnea, ap-\nnea, retinopathy of prematurity, hepatitis, syphilis, human\nimmunodeficiency virus\u00adpositive status, proven sepsis,\nand any infection were significantly more prevalent in the\ncocaine-exposed cohort. Hepatitis, syphilis, human im-\nmunodeficiency virus\u00adpositive status, and any infection\nremained significant after adjusting for covariates. These\ninfections,determinedduringthehospitalizationandbased\non laboratory confirmation, were consistent with the in-\nfection findings documented in the mothers.42\nSeveral central and autonomic nervous system find-\nings, which included hypertonia, jitteriness or tremors,\nhigh-pitched cry, difficulty arousing, irritability, ex-\ncessive suck, and hyperalertness, were noted more\nfrequently on the initial physical examination in the co-\ncaine-exposed cohort (Table 4). During the hospital-\nization, the diagnoses of seizures and autonomic insta-\nbility were more frequently noted in cocaine-exposed\ninfants. When adjusted, all of these findings except hy-\npertonia, difficulty arousing, and seizures remained sig-\nnificant in the exposed cohort.\nMore screening and diagnostic echocardiograms of the\nheart, abdomen, and head were performed in the ex-\nposed cohort (odds ratio, 1.54; 99% confidence interval,\nweight infants in that group.

Testing of meconium, rather than\nurine, is hypothesized to reliably detect drug metabolites\nover a longer period of use during pregnancy. An addi-\ntional 190 cocaine-exposed infants were identified by me-\nconium analysis from mothers who denied drug use. There\nwas no incentive to falsely admit the use of an illegal sub-\nstance;however,thereversewasnottrue.Therefore,anega-\ntive meconium sample was required for the definition of\nnonexposure in mothers who denied use.\nThe important issues of multiple exposures to alco-\nhol, tobacco, and/or marijuana, as well as the level of their\nuse, were specifically addressed with the multivariate\nanalyses. Both study cohorts had significant exposures\nto these 3 drugs, with more than 40% of the non\u00adcocaine-\nexposed mothers also admitting to use. The impact of so-\ncioeconomic status and of a drug culture environment\non outcome is complex, but important confounders and\nthese variables were also addressed in the analyses. Un-\nfortunately, not all potential confounders were elimi-\nnated. Since consent was required, it remains possible\nthat particularly heavy users or those who used mul-\ntiple drugs might be more likely to refuse participation.\nBecause mothers were enrolled at or around the time of\ndelivery, substance use early in pregnancy could have es-\ncaped detection.\nThis study contradicts the early reports of an in-\ncreased prevalence of congenital anomalies. The in-\ncreased central and autonomic nervous system dysfunc-\ntion seen in the exposed cohort was mild, including soft\nsigns such as irritability, jitteriness, tremors, high-\npitched cry, and excessive suck. Although the cocaine-\nexposed cohort included more premature, low-birth-\nweight infants, who often exhibit mild, transient\nneurologic findings, most of the central nervous system\nfindings remained significant after adjusting for birth\nweight, suggesting a true cocaine effect as reported by\nChiriboga et al.13,16 These rather subtle, acute neuro-\nlogic findings support the findings of more recent re-\nports, which suggest potential long-term neurodevelop-\nmental, behavioral, and learning effects of cocaine\nexposure, rather than any acute teratogenic impact. More\nultrasound examinations were ordered by the primary\nphysician in the exposed cohort. The higher prevalence\nof premature infants in the exposed cohort, who have\nmore complex illnesses, longer hospital stays, and more\ndiagnostic tests such as echocardiograms, may also help\nto explain this difference. It is also true, however, that\nthe clinicians who ordered these examinations were of-\nten aware of the infant's exposure status as well as the\nliterature that equated cocaine exposure with the pos-\nsible teratogenicity of various organ systems. Of note is\nthat the ultrasound studies of the head were read cen-\ntrally by expert ultrasonographers who were masked to\nexposure status. However, despite this heightened scru-\ntiny, no differential structural abnormalities of the heart,\ngastrointestinal tract, kidneys, or brain were docu-\nmented by these detailed examinations. These findings\nstrongly support the conclusion that cocaine has no ob-\nvious anatomic teratogenic impact.\nAll measures of growth were affected by cocaine ex-\nposure, and this growth restriction was most evident in\nthe larger, more mature infants. Growth failure as ges-\ntation progresses may relate to the vasoconstrictive im-\npact of cocaine on the normally aging placenta, acceler-\nating its demise and resulting in not only shorter gestations\n(prematurity) but also in increasing overall growth in-\nhibition (small for gestational age) as term approaches.\nAn extremely important finding of this study is the in-\ncreasedprevalenceofinfectiousdiagnoses,particularlysexu-\nally associated infections that were previously reported in\nthesemothers.42 Althoughhumanimmunodeficiencyvirus\u00ad\npositive exposure status had a very low overall prevalence\nin this study (0.1%), it occurred almost 16 times more of-\ntenininfantsborntococaine-abusingwomen,acleardocu-\nmentation of the increased risk of an often fatal infection.\nSimilarly, a diagnosis of hepatitis occurred about 42 times\nmore often in cocaine-exposed infants, and syphilis was 15\ntimes as common. The morbidity and mortality associ-\nated with these diseases may have a significant impact on\nboth health care utilization and long-term developmental\noutcome.Theincreaseduseofbothmedical(intensivecare,\nprocedures, therapies, length of stay, etc) and social (re-\nferralstochildprotectiveservices,adoption,andfostercare)\nservices by the cocaine-exposed cohort is significant. The\nhospital utilization findings are reflective of cocaine's effect\non both gestation and birth weight, whereas the social im-\npact as reflected through child protective services involve-\nment and the infant's living situation is a direct effect of\nthe mother's cocaine use. The serious infectious expo-\nsures associated with prenatal cocaine abuse and the bur-\ndenandcostimposedonthecriminalandsocialjusticesys-\ntems are important short-term outcomes that have obvious\nlong-term implications and have not been previously ad-\ndressed. Being classified as a boarder infant was 48 times\nmore likely in cocaine-exposed infants, resulting in ex-\ntended hospital stays.

The manpower and fiscal\nimpact of these social risks on society are significant.\nPrenatal exposure to cocaine has a different face than\nhad been previously emphasized. It does not result in ob-\nvious and marked fetal damage, but rather, as recent re-\nports suggest, a more subtle impact has evolved.47 Sig-\nnificant societal expenditures will continue to be required\nto address the social, environmental, and developmen-\ntal issues of children born to mothers engaged in the drug\nabuser's lifestyle.\nCocaine use by women during pregnancy with result-\nant fetal exposure is preventable, but the degree of dis-\nability that may result from a particular exposure must\nbe clarified to mobilize resources to respond effectively and\nefficiently. Long-term issues regarding the impact of co-\ncaine exposure on cognition, learning, neurodevelop-\nment, behavior, emotional stability, and potential infec-\ntious morbidity are important and clinically relevant.
