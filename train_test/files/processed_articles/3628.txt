    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at veterans\n8 years after war, to find out relation of PTSD with other demographic and health related variables and discover the impact\nof depression and trauma on PTSD on 687 veterans from six municipalities in Kosovo. Method: Participants were 687 war\nveterans selected from six regions of Kosovo during 2008. The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ-40), was administered\nto measure PTSD and Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25) for depression and anxiety. Pearson chi-square, analysis\nof variance (ANOVA), and multiple regressions were used to analyze the data. Results: Results indicated that 11.2 % of\nveterans even 8 years after the war ended were suffering from PTSD. Six percent of veterans with PTSD did not seek medical\nhelp. They reported to have had emotional problems and physical problems, but they did not seek medical help. The findings\nsuggest that self-medication may be one way of veterans dealing with PTSD symptoms. Veterans with PTSD symptoms were\nmore concerned with \"family issues\" than those without PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: The study found that 8 years after\nthe war the veterans of the war in Kosovo suffer PTSD symptoms and that a good number of them do not seek help for this\nproblem. The establishment of adequate services by the state would transform these veterans' dealing with PTSD not into a\nmoral challenge but into a fundamental right to equal and high-quality services.\n",

In the current global political cir-\ncumstances, the risk of experiencing trauma by involvement\nin combat and hostile environments is extremely high (Hoge\net al., 2004).

Mean age of participants was 42 years (SD = 9).\nMean age of males was 42 years (SD = 9.1) and females was\n36.2 years (SD = 5.5). For number of members living together\nin the family, responses ranged from 1 to 37 people, with an\naverage of 7.8 (SD = 3.8). The response range for education\nmonth, and the average number of children was 3.4 (SD =\n1.9). Most of them (65.1%) were living in nuclear family and\n34.9 % in extended family. Before the interview, the partici-\npants were read the letter of information and the informed\nconsent. Each participant was informed of the voluntary\nnature of the study, their right to withdraw at any time, and\nthe confidentiality of their responses.\nInstruments\nFor the purpose of this study, participants filled out a demo-\ngraphic questionnaire prepared from the main investigator\nand the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire-40 (HTQ) for mea-\nsuring PTSD. HTQ is a self-report questionnaire, which con-\nsists of three sections. In the first section are 48 questions\nrelated to the traumatic event(s) that veterans may have\nexperienced or witness during the war. This section of the\nquestionnaire was evaluated with \"yes\" and \"no.\" The sec-\nond section has open-ended question asking for subjectivity\ndescription of most traumatic experiences during the war.\nThe third section of the questionnaire has 40 questions and\nrefers to three main groups of symptoms associated with\nPTSD: intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic\nevent(s), persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the\ntraumatic event(s), and psychological hyper arousal. The\nparticipants were asked to rate each item on a 4-point Likert\nscale (1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = quite a bit, and 4 =\nextremely). The first 16 items such as \"recurrent thoughts or\nmemories of the most hurtful or terrifying events\" or \"feeling\nas though the event is happening again\" attempt to assess the\naccepted symptoms of PTSD diagnosis and following 24\nitems assess the impact of the traumatic experiences. The\nrespondents with total PTSD score >2.5 were categories with\n\"positive PTSD\" while those <2.5 in HTQ were the \"nega-\ntive PTSD\" group. In this study, the HTQ was found to have\nan internal consistency of .97(Cronbach's alpha).\nThis questionnaire has been adapted in Albanian language\nand used in different studies in Kosovo (Gordon et al., 2008;\nHalimi, Dragoti, Halimi, Sylejmani-Hulaj, & Jashari-\nThe Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL-25) is a widely\nused screening instrument designed to measure symptoms of\nanxiety and depression. It consists of 25 items. The first part\nis composed of 10 items that measure anxiety, and the second\npart is composed of 15 items that measure depression. The\nscale for each question includes four categories of response\n(not at all = 1, a little = 2, quite a bit = 3 and extremely = 4.\nTwo scores are calculated separately, and the Total score\nincludes both subscales.

The study has found a prevalence of 11.2%\nof veterans who had PTSD 8 years upon the end of the war.\nThese data are consistent with other studies that found a\nprevalence of PTSD in veterans after the end of the war\nIn addition, this study explored the differences in relation\nto seeking medical help, self-medication, and their concerns\nover various issues related to life in general in veterans with\npositive symptoms versus those with negative symptoms. In\nthe group of participants with positive PTSD symptoms, 6%\nof them did not seek medical help for their problems. These\ndata are consistent with the study carried out by Vaughan,\nSchell, Tanielian, Jaycox, and Marshall (2014). But, at the\nsame time, our results are lower than the results obtained by\nreturning veterans who were positive for a mental disorder\nsought mental health care.\nMany participants reported that they had emotional prob-\nlems and more than one problem and that they did not seek\nmedical help. One of the reasons that could explain this\nresult may be the difficulties with accessing medical services\nin Kosovo, as there are no institutions specialized for work-\ning with veterans, and the relatively high level of stigma.\nMeanwhile, this leaves room for their self-medication. Our\nFigure 1. Participants' percentage responses.\nNote. PTSD = post-traumatic stress disorder.\nFigure 2. The correlation matrix among PTSD, age, incomes,\nand education.\nNote. PTSD = post-traumatic stress disorder.\nShahini and Shala 5\nresults are consistent with other studies (Schell & Marshall,\n2008), which found that barriers to care included, in rough\norder, concerns about confidentiality and discrimination,\npreferences for relying on family and friends, concerns about\nthe effectiveness or side effects of treatments, and logistics.\nThe study found that low income and low level of edu-\ncation, although at moderate level, are related to the sever-\nity of PTSD. Income was also found to be a significant\npredictor of PTSD. The study has shown that the veterans\nin Kosovo are a neglected category of the society, because\nmost of them live in less than optimal subsistence condi-\ntions, which increases even more their reluctance to seek\nhelp for their emotional problems. We assume that this\nstatus of theirs is consistent with the results indicating that\ntheir biggest concerns are family issues. Persons with\nPTSD often have difficulties in establishing relationships\nwith family, which may affect both them and their fami-\nlies and even more specifically their children, because\naccording to Dekel and Goldblatt (2008), clinical observa-\ntions and empirical research have shown that the conse-\nquences of traumatic events are not limited to the persons\nimmediately exposed to the event and that they often\naffect significant others in their environment, such as fam-\nily members. Herzog, Everson, and Whitworth (2011)\nfound that family members of combat exposed soldiers\nwith high levels of PTSD are at risk for developing sec-\nondary traumatic stress. Many studies have reported fam-\nily problems among veterans, including emotional\nproblems and behavior problems with their spouse and\nKlari, Kvesi, Mandi, Petrov, & Franciskovi, 2013).\nAccording to Braga, Mello, and Fiks (2012), the model of\ntransmitting trauma from one generation to another does\nnot consist of only traumatic experiences but also resil-\nience patterns that can be transmitted to and developed by\nthe second generation.\nConclusion\nThe study has found that 8 years after the end of the war,\nveterans in Kosovo suffer from post-traumatic stress symp-\ntoms and that a good proportion of them do not seek help\nfor this problem. The economic status appears to affect the\nretention of PTSD symptoms, by transforming them into a\nmoral challenge for veterans, because of the lack of institu-\ntional support for this population with high risk of develop-\ning mental health problems. Health policies of a country\nshould foresee specific services for veterans and war survi-\nvors, an in particular for the families of veterans, to reduce\nthe stigma and ameliorate the impact of PTSD on their\nlives. Studies continue to raise a \"hopeful possibility that\nPTSD may be reversible if patients can be helped to cope\nwith stresses in their current life\" (Friedman, 2004, p. 76).\nTherefore, the establishment of such services would trans-\nform the veterans' dealing with PTSD from a moral\nchallenge into a fundamental right to equal and high-qual-\nity services.\n"
