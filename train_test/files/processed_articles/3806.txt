    "abstract": "Abstract\nLoss to follow-up can introduce bias into research, making it difficult to develop inclusive evidence-based health policies\nand practice guidelines. We aimed to deepen understanding of reasons why participants leave or remain in longitudinal\nhealth studies. We interviewed 59 researchers and current and former research participants in six focus groups (n = 55) or\ninterviews (n = 4) at three study centers in a large academic research institution. We used minimally structured interview\nguides and inductive thematic analysis to explore participant-level, study-level, and contextual participation barriers and\nfacilitators. Four main themes emerged: transportation, incentives and motivation, caregiver concerns, and the social and\nphysical environment. Themes shared crosscutting issues involving funding, flexibility, and relationships between researchers\nand research participants. Study-level and contextual factors appear to interact with participant characteristics, particularly\nsocioeconomic status and disease severity to affect participant retention. Participants' characteristics do not seem to be the\nmain cause of study dropout. Researchers and funders might be able to address contextual and study factors in ways that\nreduce barriers to participation.\n",

Although loss to follow-up can be a prob-\nlem in any prospective study, older adults, minorities, and\npeople with low incomes can be particularly difficult to\nrecruit and retain (Kagawa-Singer, 2000; Napoles &\nChadiha, 2011). Nonrandom loss to follow-up can bias\nresults and affect the accuracy, validity, and translational\nvalue of research (Groves, 2006; Matthews, Chatfield,\nFreeman, McCracken, & Brayne, 2004), making it difficult\nto apply results to underrepresented groups or to develop\ninclusive evidence-based health policies and practice\nguidelines that support population health equity (Odierna\n& Schmidt, 2009; Tugwell, de Savigny, Hawker, &\nThe objective of our study was to deepen understanding\nof multidimensional barriers to and facilitators of participant\nretention in community-based and outpatient health studies.\nWe explored how social health determinants and characteris-\ntics of research participants, studies, and the context in which\nresearch is conducted might interact to affect loss to follow-\nup of diverse groups of participants in a broad range of stud-\nies at three academic research centers.\nMethod\nWe collected data using minimally structured focus groups\nand interviews. Focus groups are particularly appropriate for\nuncovering new information about complex, multidimen-\nsional issues and addressing real-world problems (Creswell,\nto describe and understand research participation from the\nperspective of researchers and research participants and to\nexplore researchers' and participants' perceptions of things\nthat might influence research participants to leave or stay in\nstudies (Guest, MacQueen, & Namey, 2012).\nWe conducted a total of six focus groups at three sites. At\neach site, we conducted two focus groups: one with researchers\nand other study personnel, and the other with current and for-\nmer study participants, all from a wide variety of longitudinal\n1University of California, San Francisco, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDonna H.

We also conducted individual interviews with four\nstudy dropouts who responded to recruitment materials but\ndeclined to participate in focus groups. We used an iterative\nprocess throughout the project and in our inductive analysis.\nStudy Sites\nThe focus groups took place at three research centers associ-\nated with a large university located in the Western United\nStates. One center (Site A) was chosen specifically for its\nresearch with aging populations and its large cohort of older\nadult patients and healthy controls. The other two sites (Sites\nB and C) were selected from among six clinical research cen-\nters. Of these six, four were excluded because they were not\navailable during our study window, because they conducted\nprimarily pediatric research, or, in one case, because the cen-\nter director felt that an open recruitment and focus group for-\nmat posed a threat of contamination to one or more\nrandomized clinical trials being conducted there. While some\nclinical trials are conducted at the study sites, most of the\nresearch projects at all three sites are multiyear observational\nstudies. Some studies include biological measures, from\nblood pressure checks and cheek swabs to more invasive\nprocedures such as blood draws or lumbar punctures.\nSite A is located in two medical buildings. Clinical assess-\nments take place on an upper floor of a bustling patient care\ncenter with a busy reception area. Study participants are\ninterviewed in a nearby medical office building, with dedi-\ncated interview rooms and small, quiet reception areas. Site\nA offers medical and support services for patients, family\nmembers, and other caregivers, and holds educational events\nwhere participants can meet and interact with one another. At\nany given time, Site A generally houses more than two dozen\nongoing studies, including a large multiyear study of demen-\ntia and healthy aging, and a separate study of aging and cog-\nnition in Asian Americans.\nSite B is located away from the university, in a small\nbuilding at the edge of an inner-city neighborhood character-\nized by vibrant street life, social disadvantage, poverty, and\nhomelessness. The outside door to the research center opens\nonto a busy sidewalk. During the day, commuters, tourists,\nand shoppers throng the area. At all times, area residents pass\nby, meet, and congregate. The center is on the second floor.\nAn elevator and an open staircase lead to a reception area\nwhere research participants can congregate, talk with each\nother and the receptionist, make phone calls, use the rest\nroom, and obtain information about services and other stud-\nies that are recruiting new participants. Site B's research\nfocus is on participants who are generally considered hard to\nretain: poor, largely minority, and marginalized populations\nliving with HIV. Even so, most Site B studies have high\nretention rates, generally more than 95%. Many of the\nresearch participants live in the area, and the site is easily\naccessible by public transit. The center conducts participant\nevents designed to develop an inviting atmosphere and a\nsense of community. There are more than a dozen interview\nrooms and a phlebotomy station on-site. Site B generally\nhouses between 5 and 10 large observational and behavioral\nstudies and, occasionally, clinical trials. Most of the studies\nare multiyear projects.\nSite C is a clinical research center located on an upper\nfloor of a busy hospital. The site has several examination and\ninterview rooms, medical testing facilities, nursing services,\nand a clinical trials unit. The check-in desk faces a corridor\nthat connects several departments. There is no designated\nspace for participants to congregate, although they can use\npatient and family waiting rooms on the same floor. At any\ngiven time, Site C houses approximately 150 clinical and\nbehavioral studies.\nRecruitment and Participants\nWe first met with research center directors to discuss our\nstudy. The directors introduced us to research coordinators\nwho helped us contact research personnel and participants\nfor our focus groups and interviews. We recruited research\npersonnel for our focus groups at staff meetings, on staff\nemail lists, by posting flyers at the research centers. We\nemphasized that we were studying the research process, not\nany individual study, and that the long-term objective was to\nimprove retention rates in future studies. Researchers at\nevery level were eligible if they worked on prospective out-\npatient or community-based clinical or observational studies\nat the study sites or had ongoing contact with research par-\nticipants at those sites.\nWe recruited study participants for our focus groups with\nflyers posted in reception areas and hallways or distributed\nby research staff. In addition, Site A researchers sent letters\nto former research participants who had dropped out of Site\nA studies, inviting them to participate in our focus group\nstudy. Our recruitment materials emphasized that we were\nstudying the research process rather than research partici-\npants, and that their participation would help researchers\nconduct better future studies. We screened all volunteers who\nresponded to our recruitment materials. Research partici-\npants were eligible if they were enrolled in studies at the\nresearch center or if they were caregivers who were respon-\nsible for transporting a patient to the study site. Other inclu-\nsion criteria were proficiency in spoken English by the\nsubject or caregiver, age 18 or older, and current or recent\nparticipation in a prospective study of at least 6 months dura-\ntion and two study visits. Study dropouts were eligible if they\nhad left such a study at one of the study sites within the pre-\nvious 4 years. Our exclusion criteria were inability to pro-\nvide consent to participate in our study, and participation in\nor conduct of only inpatient studies or studies with cross-\nsectional, retrospective, or other nonlongitudinal designs.\nWe closed recruitment for each focus group when we con-\nfirmed a maximum of 12 participants. We conducted focus\nOdierna and Bero 3\nData Collection\nWe conducted 90-min focus groups with study personnel\nduring lunch breaks or after hours in meeting rooms located\nat the research centers. We asked about characteristics of\nstudies and study participants, and factors that might help or\nimpede the retention of participants through all phases of\nresearch. We started with questions about the attendees'\nexperiences as researchers, their roles, and the studies they\nworked on. We continued with conversations about their per-\nceptions of participant retention and study types, target pop-\nulations, participants' characteristics, hard-to-retain study\nparticipants, follow-up protocols, and other topics that\nemerged in the discussions. We conducted focus groups with\nstudy participants in meeting rooms off-site or on-site at a\ntime when most study personnel were not present. We started\neach focus group with warm-up questions about the types\nand number of studies the attendees had participated in. We\nthen discussed their experiences as research participants, and\nwhether and why they completed studies, missed visits, or\ndropped out. In addition, we asked about factors that made it\neasy or difficult for them to participate in research. We also\nconducted telephone interviews with four dropouts from Site\nA studies who responded to our outreach materials but said\nthat they did not want to participate in the focus groups.\nBecause we were especially interested in including their\nexperiences, we offered them the option of participating via\nindividual 30-min in-person or telephone interviews. The\ninterviews with study dropouts covered areas similar to those\ndiscussed in focus groups, with special emphasis on why\nthey left the studies and whether there were ways they might\nhave been retained. We used discussion guides that were\nminimally structured and inductive; that is, earlier conversa-\ntions informed questions and probing in subsequent groups\nand interviews. To minimize effects of our own preconcep-\ntions and collect data that reflected focus group participants'\nperceptions and experiences rather than ours, we used mini-\nmally structured interview guides and spoke minimally dur-\ning the focus groups and interviews. We made efforts not to\ninject our opinions and into the conversations (Bradbury-\nJones, Sambrook, & Irvine, 2009). We encouraged all focus\ngroup participants to speak throughout the sessions, and\nprobed when necessary to elicit more information.\nAll focus group participants received a US$40 cash incen-\ntive in appreciation of their time and trouble; interviewees\nreceived US$25. We provided meals or substantial snacks\nthat were appropriate for the time of day when the focus\ngroups took place. We decided a priori not to collect sociode-\nmographic data. There were two main reasons for this deci-\nsion. First, we believed that the site differences were greater\nand more meaningful than differences among individual par-\nticipants. This would render analysis by sociodemographic\ncharacteristics of individuals misleading. Second, our stated\npurpose during the recruitment phase of our project was to\nexamine the research process itself, rather than the partici-\npants in our study. We made note of the apparent age, gender,\nand racial/ethnic makeup of the focus groups and the ways\nattendees described themselves.\nData Analysis\nWe recorded focus groups and interviews. The digital record-\nings were transcribed verbatim by a professional transcrip-\ntion service that has been used by other qualitative researchers\nat our institution. We began our analysis after conducting our\nfirst focus group and continued throughout the study. We\nfirst read each transcript to get an overall view of the discus-\nsion, then we reread and identified relevant statements. We\nthen grouped similar statements into categories, and we\norganized these into themes. We developed codes to repre-\nsent the themes we identified, created an overall thematic\nmatrix (Guest et al., 2012) organized into final themes and\ncharacteristics that focus group participants that were identi-\nfied as having substantial effects on the ability of studies to\nretain participants. We identified as themes broad factors that\nappear to have substantial effects on the research process.\nWe identified as characteristics the specific attributes of\nstudy participants, study design, and implementation, and the\ncontext in which studies take place. Throughout the study,\none researcher (dho) manually coded the data. We used a pre-\nliminary multilevel coding scheme (participant, study, and\ncontext) to identify themes and characteristics. Another\nresearcher (lab) reviewed and analyzed transcripts and text\nblock on an ongoing basis, and suggested additional catego-\nries for the coding scheme.\nWe used the preliminary scheme to code the dataset in\nmore detail, using an inductive, iterative process to revise the\noriginal coding as new insights and patterns appeared. We\ndiscussed the coding with other researchers, including a stu-\ndent intern who attended some focus groups and a colleague\nwho is an expert in qualitative methods. We then created\nworking data tables for research personnel and study partici-\npants. We asked for feedback on our coding and focus group\nmatrices from several researchers who participated in the\nfocus groups. The use of such informant feedback is a way of\nestablishing dependability in qualitative research (Creswell,\n2007). The data we present are based on the comments of\nmultiple participants or discussions that took place in multi-\nple focus groups. The quotes we chose for incorporation into\nthe text are representative of these discussions or illustrate\nvariations in the data.\nHuman Subjects\nThis study was approved by the Committee on Human\nResearch (CHR) of the University of California, San\nFrancisco Human Research Protection Program, Approval\nwe obtained verbal consent and provided CHR-approved\nstudy information sheets. Incentives were paid in cash,\nreceipts recorded only study ID numbers. Researchers con-\nducting the studies that provided the pool of volunteers were\n4 SAGE Open\nnot advised if any of their staff or research participants par-\nticipated in our study. We asked participants to avoid using\nnames during the conversations, and we strictly limited\naccess to the transcripts to our research team.\nResults\nWe recruited 63 researchers and research participants for six\nfocus groups at three research centers. Of those 63 individu-\nresearch participants or study dropouts. In addition to the 55\nfocus group participants, four study dropouts who responded\nto our outreach materials declined to participate in the focus\ngroups, but agreed to individual interviews. Therefore, 59\npeople participated in our study. Almost all of the researchers\nand most of the research participants/dropouts said that they\nhad been involved in more than one study, and many said\nthat they had participated in multiple studies over time.\nSeveral research participants who attended the focus groups\nmentioned that although they were currently actively partici-\npating in a study, they had dropped out of previous studies.\nFive participant focus group attendees identified themselves\nas caregivers for participants in our focus groups and in other\nresearch studies.\nAbout three quarters of the people who participated in our\nstudy (44/59) were women. Research participant focus\ngroups included 13 research subjects from Site A studies, 9\nfrom Site B studies, and 10 from Site C studies. Most research\nparticipants appeared to be middle age and older adults; six\nidentified themselves as caregivers who were responsible for\nescorting research participants to and from study sites. There\nwere very few young adults in the research subject focus\ngroups. The subject groups were diverse; about half appeared\nto be or identified themselves in conversation as members of\nracial or ethnic minority groups; attendees in the Site A par-\nticipant study group included six people who were research\nsubjects or caregivers in a study of cognition and aging in\nolder Chinese adults. The four study dropouts whom we\ninterviewed by telephone described themselves as retire-\nment-aged, but all said that they were currently self-employed\nor working as volunteers. The research personnel worked at\nthree academic research centers; the focus groups included\n11 researchers from Site A, 5 from Site B, and 7 from Site C.\nResearch personnel ranged in age and professional status\nfrom young adults in their first research jobs to senior staff,\nand included receptionists, research coordinators, interview-\ners, clinicians, center directors, and principal investigators.\nAnalysis of data from the focus group and interview tran-\nscripts yielded four major themes: transportation, participant\nincentives and motivation, caregiver concerns, and the phys-\nical and social environment. Within these themes, character-\nistics of participants, studies, and context emerged as barriers\nto or facilitators of participant retention (Table 1). Three\ncrosscutting issues:funding, flexibility, and relationships,\nwere common to all of the themes (not shown in the tabular\nform).\nTheme 1: Transportation\nResearchers and participants alike described transportation\nas an important element in the retention of research partici-\npants. Within this theme, we found that multilevel character-\nistics act as barriers or facilitators; these include income,\naccess to a car and other resources, comorbidity and disease\nseverity, site accessibility, and the ability of investigators to\nreschedule visits and reallocate resources. Discussions also\nfrequently centered on such contextual factors as public\nsafety and transit options:\nLike the last time they scheduled the MRI, it was at night and I\ncouldn't come because he's [paid caregiver] going to accompany\nme . . . it sounds kind of silly but I didn't want to come down\nthere on the bus at night. (Participant)\nIf it's local, then you can pay for a cab or a bus pass. Actually, I\ncan't tell you how many hours it took to figure out how to pay\nfor bus passes . . . I don't think we were ever able to do it.\n(Researcher)\nResearchers said that they knew that reimbursing study\nparticipants for transportation costs was extremely impor-\ntant, but that funding rather than participants' needs usually\ndetermined their ability to pay:\nWe can barely pay for a parking sticker . . . after NIH cuts your\nfunding by 20% you end up with a limited budget and you face\nwell, should I have one less staff person so I can't analyze my\ndata . . . or should I boost up the travel money? (Researcher)\nLike their travel was reimbursed [by the private sponsor] and we\nwere getting paid hundreds of dollars on a per-patient basis to\nrun the study, so it gave us a lot of incentive and a lot of money\nto play with to actually get the patients in when they needed to\nget in. (Researcher)\nStudy protocols and personal interactions between study\npersonnel and participants were important in meeting trans-\nportation challenges and retaining a study's particular target\npopulation. An interviewer described taking special care\nwith older participants, saying \"Our offices are hard to find.\nThe better I give them instructions on how to do that the\nsmoother that goes, I think the less scared of it they are in the\nfuture.\" Flexibility in the implementation phase of studies\nemerged as a facilitator of participant retention, allowing\nresearchers to address individual concerns that might other-\nwise cause participants to drop out. A participant in a pri-\nvately funded clinical study told the group how he was able\nto participate even though he had to travel a long distance:\nI have PTSD. And so for me to take the train by myself was kind\nof a trip, plus I had to pay for the train before I got there. They\nOdierna and Bero 5\nhad someone meet me at the station, pay for my fare, and ride\nwith me. (Participant)\nStudy participants' proximity to their study site, conve-\nnient and affordable public transit, or access to a car and\nconvenient parking facilitated participation. Researchers\nsaid that participants who lived far from study sites or who\nmoved far away during the course of a study were very dif-\nficult to retain. Changes in participants' employment status\ncan affect the time they have available for study visits and\nTable 1.

The flight was cheap, and I\narranged other things to do there. Now I'm retired and I have\ntime but not the money. If they could have covered some of my\nexpenses, I might've stayed. (Study dropout)\nResearchers who took part in the focus groups said that\nculture, language, and socioeconomic status (SES) have sub-\nstantial effects on transportation logistics. They said that the\ninteractions led to special challenges in getting some partici-\npants to research sites:\nI should also say for [some populations], distance is an issue in\na very different way. A lot of people who live, for instance, in\nChinatown really don't feel that comfortable coming up here [to\na research site in another part of the city] and that's a barrier that\nthe rest of our cohort doesn't experience. And it's certainly true\nfor the less educated, less acculturated group. (Researcher)\nTheme 2: Participant Incentives and Motivation\nResearchers and research participants repeatedly described\nmonetary and nonmonetary participant incentives as impor-\ntant motivators. However, investigators said that funding\nlevels and ethical concerns about participant coercion limit\nthe amount of financial compensation they can offer. Funding\npolicies and regulations can also impede the flexibility\nresearchers need to respond to changing and emerging needs\nof the population during study implementation. Research\nparticipants stressed that monetary incentives should be con-\ngruent with study-related risks and burdens to participants\nand caregivers. Research participants from Site B, mostly\npoor and at best marginally employed, said that monetary\nincentives were the primary reason they participated in\nresearch and that they looked for studies that paid well. \"I\nmean, the money. We're sitting here and we're telling you\nit's the money.\" They and others expressed concerns that\nmoney might persuade people with low incomes to partici-\npate in studies when otherwise they might not, although no\none said that this applied to them personally. Research par-\nticipants from all sites made it clear that money would not\nmotivate them to undergo what they perceived as dangerous\nmedical procedures or participate in studies they felt would\nthreaten their health. Some said that they were disinclined to\nparticipate in for-profit research because they did not trust in\nindustry sponsors. Some Site B participants, who for the\nmost part said that they were motivated primarily by finan-\ncial incentives, agreed,\nParticipant 1: Well I wouldn't do a smoking group sponsored by\nPhillip Morris [large tobacco company].\nParticipant 2: If you're taking my medical information and using\nit to market, not to improve the field but to market, it is just\nqueasy for some reason.\nParticipant 3: For these drugs to get on the market, they have to\nshow progress with it, you know . . . the FDA won't fund them\nanymore.\nAlthough many of the research participants in Site B and\nC participant focus groups said that money was the most\nimportantmotivator,thiswasnotalwaysthecase.Researchers\nfrom Site A said that older, highly educated, and affluent par-\nticipants sometimes did not even accept incentive payments.\nIn all groups, the need for information and the salience of the\nresearch topic emerged as especially important motivators\nfor patients in studies of conditions with few treatment\noptions:\nI'd say the financial incentive's huge if it's not something that\naffects you. Like if you're a healthy control or you're just\nparticipating \"because.\" But if it's maybe a medical condition\nyou have, for me, I would've done the study either way. Luckily\nit paid. (Participant)\nHowever, unmet expectations could cause participants to\nexpress dissatisfaction or even to leave studies:\nThey really don't tell you anything except that \"if we think that\nyou have a serious, you know, problem, we'll let you know\" . . .\nSo it seemed like very much for me a black hole. I found that not\nvery satisfying 'cause it was taking a fair amount of time and\nthat's why I kind of just decided to leave. I thought I was going\nto get a little more information and I got pretty much no\ninformation out of it. (Study dropout)\nWhile some participants emphasized the importance of\nperceived personal benefit in the form of information or\nmonetary incentives, many described volunteerism and the\ndesire to help others as important motivations. Others\ntalked about how participation in research gave them a feel-\ning of connection to the scientific community and enabled\nthem to contribute to advancements in medicine. Several\nparticipants who were healthy controls in studies character-\nized their own altruism as part of a larger social commit-\nment to science and population health. Some researchers\nsaid that they frequently saw this particular motivation\namong highly educated participants, and that education and\nculture played an important role, especially among immi-\ngrants. One researcher who worked primarily with immi-\ngrant populations said, \"Most of the time I see the\n[immigrants] who are, who do have that concept, contribut-\ning to the greater good and research, are probably PhDs or\nif not, at least college graduates.\" Another said that it is\nimportant for researchers not to project their own values\nonto their research subjects:\nI think we're used to the idea of like the culture we grew up in\nand the fact that we work here, that oh, I want to contribute to\nresearch is like even a concept. And I feel like other cultures it's\nnot necessarily this idea that oh, I'm contributing to science by\nbeing a research subject. (Researcher)\nOdierna and Bero 7\nThe discussions of motivations of altruism, volunteerism,\nand scientific importance were animated and enthusiastic:\nWhenever I see something on the board I can qualify for, part of\nit is, \"Oh, I'm getting a Safeway card.\" But part of it I feel like\nmaybe I'm helping a little. Plus, it's kind of exciting. You never\nknow what's going to happen. (Participant)\nOne of us might be the clue. But just in these years, all of a\nsudden--you know, it's gone from a small study . . . to be\nenormous . . . We're all getting older, a lot of us 'cause Ronald\nRegan had the money to put into it, the whole foundation, but it\nhas changed so much since he was first diagnosed and died. But\nit's just amazing the kinds of things that are out there, all because\npeople have gotten involved. (Participant)\nThey're all like really proud to be participating in a study that\nthey think is going to have an impact on other others who have\nbeen dealt the same situation that they've been dealt . . . That's\npretty significant. (Researcher)\nTheme 3: Caregiver Concerns\nFamily members'desire for information about the patient and\npossibly heritable conditions emerged as particularly strong\nmotivation to keep participants in studies. Other motivators\nincluded caregivers' desire to help family members, and the\nrespite caregivers had during patients' long study appoint-\nments. Conversely, difficulty accepting patients'diagnoses or\nlack of useful information emerged as reasons family caregiv-\ners and patients might drop out of studies. Family caregivers\nwho were juggling jobs and family obligations were some-\ntimes unable to meet study obligations. Transportation and\nmotivation were of particular importance to caregivers.\nResearchers described the difficulty caregivers have getting\nsicker patients, or those with mental health issues or increas-\ning dementia, to study sites as a substantial barrier:\nI think sometimes it makes it more difficult to travel when you\nhave somebody that might, you know, not be very agreeable to\nsitting for long periods of time on a plane or that they feel like\nthey can control. (Researcher)\nResearchers who worked with HIV+ participants men-\ntioned that older HIV+ adults sometimes do not have family\nor steady paid caregivers, making scheduling and participa-\ntion in research difficult. Moreover, patients' declining cog-\nnition could also change the way study personnel interact\nwith research participants and their caregivers. Researchers\nacknowledged the need to address this with staff training and\nsensitivity:\nIt's better to call the caregiver because it's more likely that\nyou'll get the appointment scheduled and they'll actually come.\nBut at the same time, you know, the [early dementia] patient\nrealizes that you're not calling them to schedule that appointment\nand gets offended that you didn't call them. So it's kind of tricky\nto navigate . . . And even the family member might be like,\n\"Why are you calling me to schedule this?\" You know, like\nthey're semi in denial about what's going on or how much they\nneed to help out. (Researcher)\nOverall, it appears that caregivers experience facilitators\nand barriers similar to those experienced by research partici-\npants. However, the focus group discussions highlighted the\nadditional burdens of assisting with the study participation of\nsick or cognitively impaired research participants.\nTheme 4: Physical and Social Environment\nFocus group discussions frequently focused on characteris-\ntics of the physical and social environment, and how these\nmight affect study participation. On-site parking was gener-\nally described as an important factor for those who had a car\nand drove to the sites. Accessibility is a product of site loca-\ntion and the built environment, but it was also discussed as a\nfunction of transportation options, cultural differences, par-\nticipants' level of disability, and caregiver burden. One par-\nticipant emphasized that even with parking, it was difficult to\narrive on-site:\nI have a problem with walking. It would be real nice if somebody\ncould pick me up. I know that's not feasible though. So if I'm\nparking in a garage, I have to come across the street. I have to\ncarry this [oxygen] everywhere I go . . . yeah, so, you know, I do\nwhat I can. But it would be helpful if I could do a whole lot by\nphone, a whole lot more by telephone. (Participant)\nParticipants and researchers repeatedly said that physi-\ncally attractive, clean, welcoming study sites encouraged\ncontinued participation. Site B, where many participants are\nhomeless or marginally housed, also provides a place where\nparticipants could come by just to relax, chat, have a cup of\ntea, or make a phone call; participants said that because of\nthis they sometimes even came by in-between study visits.\nAt the same time, many participants said that study visits\nconducted in unpleasant rooms and sites without comfort-\nable waiting areas were disrespectful or made them feel\nunappreciated. In studies with marginalized and socially dis-\nadvantaged target populations, researchers and participants\nsaid that \"official looking\" or intimidating research sites, for\nexample, those where participants had to interact with secu-\nrity personnel or show identification to enter, could discour-\nage continued participation in the research that takes place\nthere.\nInstitutional reputation emerged as both a participation\nbarrier and a facilitator. Participants mentioned the universi-\nty's role as a leading research and medical institution as an\nincentive to participation. Some researchers noted that previ-\nous negative interactions between academia and the commu-\nnity sometimes made it difficult to enroll and retain\nparticipants. Participants explicitly described perceived\ninstitutional systemic conflicts of interest as disincentives:\n8 SAGE Open\nThere'stoomuchblurrylinebetweencompaniesanduniversities.\nThey discovered in the last few years that professors are getting\npaid or some information's being slanted or they're leaving out\nsome information. It's not a clean line. I don't want them to say,\n\"Oh, let's take the best 80% that it worked well on, ignore the 20\nthat it didn't work well on and then we can go to the FDA.\"\n(Participant)\nCrosscutting Issues\nIssues related to funding, flexibility, and relationships were\ncommon to all of the major themes that emerged in our study.\nResearchers said that funding policies and budgetary con-\nstraints and cuts reduce study resources and staffing levels.\nThis in turn can affect study design and implementation, lim-\niting follow-up protocols, staff availability, and sometimes\neven reducing investigators' inclination to enroll potentially\nhard-to-find participants into their studies. According to\nsome focus group participants, when studies limited follow-\nup visits to weekdays, it caused them to miss visits or drop\nout of studies when their employment or personal situation\nchanged. Limited resources can result in smaller-than-ideal\nsample sizes because large cohorts require more effort for\nrecruitment, data collection, and follow-up. Moreover, strin-\ngent rules, for example, those found in multicenter projects\ninvolving large consortia or National Institutes of Health\n(NIH)\u00adfunded studies, sometimes denied investigators the\nflexibility to quickly adjust study visit time windows and\nretention protocols in response to the needs of the study and\nthe participants:\nSo there was a time . . . maybe just four years ago, that you could\nmanipulate the participant incentive budget to allocate a few\nhundred dollars for unique transfers or taxi vouchers or food or\nsomething like that. But [the university] was audited . . . and we\nwere told we could no longer--even though it was going towards\nthe participant use--do it unless it was itemized in the budget.\n(Researcher)\nSustained contact, personal touches, and the relationships\nthese engender emerged as important factors in the ability of\nresearchers to respond to participants' needs in scheduling,\ntransportation, and the desire for information. Researchers\nsaid that good communication among principal investiga-\ntors, coordinators, staff, and site directors provided impor-\ntant avenues of feedback about which retention procedures\nworked and which did not. On-the-ground research staff said\nthat this was particularly important when studies were led by\nless-experienced principal investigators and on studies\ndesigned with limited retention protocols. Respect, or the\nperceived lack of it, was described as affecting confidence\nand trust. Participants repeatedly said or implied that it was\nimportant that they not be \"treated like a number,\" and that\nthey want to be treated with respect. Perceived lack of respect\nby members of the study team negatively affected their con-\nfidence and trust in the research process. Researchers made\nfrequent reference to the importance of respect and personal\nconnection with participants:\nI found that the people . . . who I followed up with on the phone\nafter to give them test results or just to check in and make sure,\nyou know, their hospice was working out or make sure their\nMedicare benefits were coming through, whatever it may be,\nthey feel a tie to us . . . so then two months later, when I ask,\n\"Would you be willing to come back? I know he's in a wheelchair\nnow and it's going to be difficult but it would be really helpful\nfor us,\" they're more likely to do that. (Researcher)\nResearchers recognized the crucial importance of\nacknowledging participants as individuals. They also\ndescribed individual characteristics such as education,\nincome, cultural background, disability, or health status as\nimportant but not themselves necessarily barriers to\nretention:\nI want to say that there's an easy equation to determine who\nwould be difficult to get and who would be easy, but I don't\nthink there is . . . Some folks, they are marginally housed. They\nmay move around a lot, but they have a really good relationship\nwith their case manager and we know there's someone we can\ncall. Some people . . . go to the library and they check their\nemail. So the fact of someone's housing situation or situation in\nterms of needing care doesn't fully predict their ability to be\nretained in the study. (Researcher)\nDiscussion\nTheir comments show that researchers and research partici-\npants think in concrete, practical terms about transportation,\nincentives and motivation, caregiver burden, and the effects\nof the physical and social environment on research participa-\ntion. Moreover, the discussions illustrated how participant-,\nstudy-, and contextual-level characteristics interact to\nencourage or hinder participation in research over time.\nAttendees in all focus groups saw participant SES as relevant\nto the ability of studies to retain participants. They often\ncited income, education, and culture when discussing the\nrelative ease of participation in research, and the importance\nof monetary and nonmonetary incentives to lower income\nand higher income participants. High disease severity and\ncomorbidity and related burdens were described as substan-\ntial participation barriers, particularly when family resources\nwere scarce. Transportation issues, mentioned frequently by\nparticipants, might affect not only study participation but\nalso patients' ability to travel to medical appointments and\nadhere to medical treatment. Differential attrition of sicker\nresearch participants who also have transportation barriers\ncould thus bias study outcomes. In an individual car-based\nculture with inconvenient and increasingly expensive public\ntransit, the inability of poor and marginalized individuals to\nsimply get from one place to another can present a broader\nbarrier to their functioning than is commonly imagined.\nOdierna and Bero 9\nConversely, access to and reimbursement for safe and conve-\nnient transportation can facilitate continued study participa-\ntion. Transportation issues also might change with age;\npatients' need to stop driving, which has been linked to poor\nhealth outcomes including declining cognitive function\n(O'Connor, Edwards, Small, & Andel, 2011), can reduce\nindividuals' ability to continue to participate in studies, and\nchange the representativeness of cohorts over time.\nMost of the barriers and facilitators that our focus group\nparticipants identified are not simply due to characteristics of\nresearch participants. Rather, they seem to result from inter-\nactions between characteristics of study participants and the\nlarger research environment, which in combination can affect\nretention rates over time. This dynamic appears similar to\nprocesses in which physical limitations interact with condi-\ntions in the social and physical environment to limit full par-\nticipation in society by older adults or people with disabilities\n(Satariano, 2005). Just as appropriate accommodations\nimprove social participation for those populations, adjust-\nments to funding policies, study design and implementation,\nand site accessibility could improve participant retention in\nhealth research. Researchers, from data collectors to principal\ninvestigators, frequently described inadequate funding and\nresource allocation as participation barriers because of their\neffects on study protocols (e.g., recruitment and retention pro-\ncedures) and interaction with participants (e.g., staffing lev-\nels,studyvisitscheduling,sustainedcontactwithparticipants).\nIn particular, researchers often mentioned strict funding regu-\nlations as limiting the flexibility they need to achieve high\nretention rates. While it is not news when investigators com-\nplain about lack of adequate funding for any aspect of their\nprojects, the focus group discussions illuminated specific\nways funding policies can affect study design and implemen-\ntation, and how these in turn can affect retention.\nTo our knowledge, our study is unique in that we asked\nboth researchers and research participants to identify factors\nspecifically related to the retention of participants in pro-\nspective studies. We also encouraged broad discussion of\nmultilevel barriers and facilitators. Some of our findings\nreflect previous reports of relationships between loss to fol-\nlow-up and participant characteristics including low SES,\ndistance from the research site, or co-morbidities, and study\ncharacteristics, including insufficient follow-up protocols or\nhigh participant burden (Davis et al., 2002; Hessol et al.,\nDavis et al. (2002) found that the implementation of multiple\nfollow-up strategies was the most important factor in achiev-\ning high retention rates regardless of the population being\nstudied. Our findings that relationships, including elements\nof trust, cultural competence, and participants' wariness of\nfinancial conflicts of interest, are crucial to participant reten-\ntion are consistent with previous studies that found these to\nbe important factors in peoples' willingness to enroll in\nKirkby, Calvert, Draper, Keeley, & Wilson, 2012; Manson,\nGarroutte, Goins, & Henderson, 2004). A focus group study\nwith African American research participants found that a\nlack of trust in scientific research, academic institutions, and\nresearchers themselves, as well as the failure of researchers\nto share their findings with the community, were participa-\ntion barriers regardless of SES or education (Williams et al.,\n2010). The high value of altruism, salience, and developing\ngood relationships between researchers and participants con-\nfirms similar findings by Kost et al. (2011), whose study of\nthe overall experience of research participants and people in\nvarious roles of research enterprise found those factors to be\nof more importance than financial compensation. That study\nalso found that participants were dissatisfied when research\nstaff did not share test results with study participants or study\nfindings with the larger community.\nWe and others have found that caregivers often play an\nimportant role in participation through all phases of research.\nCaregiving can cause physical and emotional stress and\naffect the health of family members, particularly older adults\ncaring for disabled relatives (Perkins et al., 2013; Schulz &\nBeach, 1999). An analysis of a cohort of dementia patients\nfound associations between study dropout and nonfamily\ncaregiving and increased family caregiver burden, and con-\ncluded that caregivers'well-being could be an important fac-\ntor in retaining dementia patients (Coley et al., 2008). Our\nfindings indicate that the burdens of managing the research\nparticipation of a physically or cognitively impaired adult\ncan form substantial participation barriers for family care-\ngivers who work and have conflicting responsibilities.\nLimitations\nA limitation of focus group research is that the sample might\nnot represent the population of interest. As in most focus\ngroup research, participants in this research were self-\nselected, and the researchers and study subjects we talked\nwith might not be typical of such groups in other venues. In\nthis project, we had a special concern that hard-to-retain\nrespondents and dropouts might self-select out of the sample.\nTo address this, we made a special effort to recruit study\ndropouts, and we included a center that serves marginalized,\npoor, homeless, minority, and HIV+ individuals, and people\nwho experience substance abuse and mental disabilities--\npopulations long considered to be hard to reach for enroll-\nment and follow-up (Badawi, Eaton, Myllyluoma, Weimer,\nBen-Abdallah, Horne, & Claverie, 1996; DiFranceisco et al.,\nand convenience sampling generate rich information not eas-\nily found using other research designs (Creswell, 2007).\nBecause we were aware that our interpretive analysis of par-\nticipants' descriptions of research participation could be col-\nored by our own experiences as researchers, we used\ninformant feedback throughout the study to increase\nreliability.\nOther limitations result from the nature of our study\ndesign. We had access to study participants and expert\nresearchers in several research centers; this access provided\nmultidimensional perspectives. However, our study took\nplace at one institution, which limits generalizability. Our\nfindings are based on the perceptions and experiences of\nresearchers and participants in a wide range of health studies.\nWe had no access to study records and were unable to verify\ndetails of the studies they described. We are unable to report\ndifferences by race/ethnicity, gender, or age. These gaps pro-\nvide roadmaps for future mixed-methods studies and studies\nthat focus on particular participant populations.\nImplications for Research Policy and Practice\nRecently, there has been substantial focus on patient-cen-\ntered health outcomes in health care research and delivery.\nStudy designs that take into account patient- or participant-\ncentered research outcomes could maximize recruitment and\nretention. This is not amenable to a one-size-fits-all approach;\npatient-centered health and research outcomes depend on the\npriorities of the study population and policymakers who seek\nto address them equitably and efficiently. These priorities\nmight include, for example, relieving the burden of disease\nfor individuals and communities, addressing social health\ndeterminants, providing information and resources, or widely\ndisseminating or implementing findings. The latter might be\na particularly important motivation for participation in\nresearch. Our findings regarding nonmonetary incentives\nindicate that many research participants of all SES levels are\nmotivated to enroll and stay in studies they believe to be sci-\nentifically or socially important, but that financial compensa-\ntion is an effective motivator for many others.\nRelationships between researchers and research partici-\npants are pivotal in maintaining high retention rates.\nHowever, investigators cannot address every issue at every\nlevel. Structural and institutional barriers may be over-\nwhelming, especially when research policies or inadequate\nfunding limit retention strategies available to investigators.\nTo attain high response rates in diverse study populations, it\nmight be effective to evaluate the impact of individual,\nstudy, and social factors, and develop approaches tailored to\ntarget populations and communities. For example, Williams\net al. (2010) argue that pervasive barriers to African\nAmerican participation in Alzheimer's disease research can\nbe overcome if researchers maintain a durable presence in\nthe community. Research in Native American communities\nsometimes requires formal collaboration with tribal authori-\nties (Manson et al., 2004). Integrating the needs and prefer-\nences of the individuals, communities, and populations\ninvolved in research also requires funders' and policymak-\ners' willingness to provide resources for effective, flexible,\nand culturally competent retention protocols. Prospective\nstudies of retention of socially disadvantaged, disabled, or\nother clinically relevant populations, discussions with key\ninformants, or the addition of questions on national surveys\nor and study visit questionnaires are examples of strategies\nthat could provide important information to investigators\nand funders alike. Changes in research policy cannot elimi-\nnate the effects of contextual factors or social disadvantage\non participant retention; however, they can make research\nmore inclusive and relevant to diverse and aging\npopulations.\nAuthors' Note\nPortions of this article were presented at the Gerontological Society\nof America 65th Annual Scientific Meeting in San Diego,\nCalifornia, and the American Public Health Association 140th\nAnnual Meeting in San Francisco, California.
