For our project, 60 visitors to the Museum\nplayed ``Fish Police!!,'' a video game that examines audiovisual integration, including the ability to\nignore irrelevant sensory information.

Accompanying each fish was a task-irrelevant broadband\nsound, amplitude modulated at either 6 or 8 Hz. The rates of visual and auditory modulation\nwere either Congruent (both 6 Hz or 8 Hz) or Incongruent (6 and 8 or 8 and 6 Hz). Despite being\ninstructed to ignore the sound, players of all ages responded more accurately and faster when a\nfish's auditory and visual signatures were Congruent. In a controlled laboratory setting, a related\ntask produced comparable results, demonstrating the robustness of the audiovisual interaction\nreported here.

Notwithstanding the logistical challenges\nthey present, such environments can be attractive, especially for research focused on\ndevelopmental trends and individual differences. Perhaps the best-known example of\nresearch done in a public setting is Galton's (1895) study of 9,000 visitors to the London\nInternational Health Exhibition. After paying a small fee for the privilege, each visitor's\nvisual acuity, hearing, reaction time, and other functions were measured.\nThe Living Laboratory, located in Boston's Museum of Science, provides a unique\nresearch environment. The Museum invites scientists from local universities and hospitals\nto use the Laboratory as a venue for engaging visitors in ongoing research that also offers\nvisitors a valuable educational experience. The Laboratory makes it possible to collect useful\ndata from large and diverse samples of subjects across a wide age range, from school-aged\nchildren through senior citizens. For some time, we have been interested in audiovisual\nintegration, particularly the ways in which a correlation between signals' temporal\nstructures promotes their integration (Parise, Spence, & Ernst, 2012). So we took\nadvantage of the Museum environment in order to examine age-related changes in\naudiovisual integration, and also to test the robustness of observations made previously, in\nwell-controlled laboratory settings (Benussen et al., 2014; Sun, Shinn-Cunningham, Somers,\nPsychophysical experiments are often time consuming and usually require many\nrepetitions of the same measurement. As a result, test subjects must be available, attentive,\nand motivated for one or more lengthy testing sessions. Particularly when researchers want to\nstudy a wide age range of participants, the repetitive, sometimes monotonous aspects of an\nexperiment can cause participants to withdraw before the needed data have been collected.\nWithdrawal before testing is complete can render data collected up to that point unusable. To\nminimize such risks, we embedded our experiment within a simple video game, which was\ndesigned to engage and amuse participants while also generating data on interactions\nbetween what subjects saw and what they heard (e.g., Abramov et al., 1984; Miranda &\nIn our video game, ``Fish Police!!,'' players watched as computer-generated fish appeared\none at a time and swam rapidly across a virtual river (see Figure 1). As it swam, each fish\noscillated sinusoidally in size, at either 6 or 8 Hz. To make the task harder, each fish's path\nwas perturbed by a series of small random vertical displacements. Accompanying each fish\nwas a broadband sound that was amplitude modulated at either 6 or 8 Hz. Subjects were\ninstructed to classify each fish as rapidly as possible using only what they saw, judging\nwhether a fish oscillated at the slower (6 Hz) or faster rate (8 Hz). While making these\njudgments, subjects were to ignore the concurrent amplitude modulated sound. If, despite\nthese instructions, the sound affected subjects' responses, we expected that categorizations to\nbe more accurate and faster when visual and auditory signals were Congruent, that is when\nthey shared the same rate, rather than Incongruent, when auditory and visual signals were\nmismatched in rate.\nOnce a fish appeared and began its journey across the river, a subject had just 2 seconds to\nrespond before the fish would disappear from view. Then 3 seconds later, a new fish appeared\nand began its journey across the river. This schedule spawned about 12 fish per minute, which\nmade the game challenging and seemed to promote sustained attention.\nIn addition to a task design that would be accessible to subjects of all ages, this unique\nsetting also required special considerations in terms of set-up. In laboratory environments,\nequipment needed for research can be set up and left unmolested for repeated use over an\nextended period. In public settings, that is usually impossible to do. The Living Laboratory's\nspace is time-shared among multiple research projects, each of whom can use the space only a\nfew hours each week. At the end of each day's assigned time, researchers must pack up and\nremove all the equipment and materials that had been used. To accommodate this\nrequirement, our experiment's game was implemented in Python on an inexpensive\ntouchscreen tablet computer (Samsung Note 10.1) running the Android mobile operating\nsystem.\nTo boost players' enjoyment, Fish Police!! incorporated several features common to video\ngames (Hawkins, Rae, Nesbitt, & Brown, 2013; Miranda & Palmer, 2014). For example, each\ncorrect response was followed immediately by a pleasant, rewarding sound (clinking of\ncoins), and each incorrect response brought an unpleasant sound (a short buzz).\nAdditionally, a running total of correct responses, represented by a collection of coins,\nwas displayed at the top of the computer tablet screen (see Figure 1). The length of a\ngreen progress bar near the display's top indicated the time remaining before the response\ndeadline. Thanks to these features and the task's inherent challenge, Fish Police!! proved\nsufficiently engaging that of the Museum visitors who began play, only $10% quit before\ncompleting the game. Of these, approximately half were either ushered away by parents or\nguardians or were interrupted by some other unavoidable event. Moreover, about 25% of the\nplayers asked if they could play a second time, a request that we had to decline because there\nwas almost always a line of people waiting their turn to play.\nAs potential players of Fish Police!! would be unused to the attentional demands of\npsychophysical experiments, we decided to embed subjects' instructions in a narrative that\nwould be engaging, easily understood, and easily remembered. After being shown the\ncomputer tablet on which the game would be played, subjects were told:\nYou are going to be the police officer in charge of a river. One at a time, from either side of the\ntablet, a fish will appear. They are very nervous, though, because they don't want to be caught by\nFigure 1. A pair of screen captures from the tablet display. (a) Fish appeared at the screen's left side. (b) Fish\nappeared at the screen's right side. The green countdown bar at the top of screen shows that more time is\nleft before the response deadline in (b) than in (a). This difference corresponds to the fact that fish in (a) has\nmoved further from its starting location (at the edge of screen) than has the fish in b. The size difference\nbetween the fish results from the fact that the screen shot shows the two fish at different points in their size\noscillation cycles.\nGoldberg et al. 3\nyou! The bad fish will be wiggling fast because they're scared, that's when you tilt the tablet\ntowards you to catch them. If the fish is wiggling more slowly, then it's a good fish because it isn't\nas nervous, so you can tilt the tablet away from you to let it go. Remember though, since they've\nbeen swimming for a while, they're a little bored so they hum \u00adyou'll hear this through the\nheadphones I'll be putting on you. Try as best you can to JUST focus on their wiggling to tell\nif they're a good or bad fish.\nEach participant played the game while holding the tablet with one hand on each side of the\nscreen. This made it possible to implement a pair of responses, tilting the tablet either toward\nor away from the player that had an easily remembered correspondence to the judgment that\neach direction signaled.\nAt the Living Laboratory's entrance, a video monitor advertized the game by displaying\nan image from Fish Police!!'s splash screen. Before commencing play, a player's basic\ndemographic information, initials and age, was entered via the tablet's touchscreen. This\ninformation and all data generated during game play were de-identified and uploaded\nwirelessly by the tablet in real time to a secure server offsite. The tablet's built-in\naccelerometer sampled the tablet's angle of tilt at 60 Hz. The Python script controlling the\nvideo game defined a response as a rotation that was 17  or more relative to the tablet's\norientation at the moment when a fish first appeared on the screen. This rotation threshold\nguarded against that possibility that spurious, unintended movements of the tablet would be\nmistaken for genuine responses to the fish. Once the Python script detected that the response\nthreshold had been exceeded, it triggered the appropriate feedback for players, either the\nsound of coins clinking or a buzzing sound, and then, 3 seconds later, spawned the next fish.\nAll accelerometer readings and responses were inserted into a data stream sent wirelessly\nfrom the testing area to the offsite server.\nBefore beginning the game, a player was shown how to hold the tablet, with one hand on\neach side, and how the tablet was to be tilted in order to signal a response. Then, each player\nwas given three practice trials with Congruent and Incongruent ``good'' and ``bad'' fish. Also\nincluded in these practice trials were some in which the fish was presented with no\naccompanying sound. These no-sound trials were meant to reinforce the point that the\nplayer was to judge a fish only on the basis of visual attributes. The practice trials\nprovided an opportunity to ensure that a player understood the task. These trials were\nfollowed by a set of 10 practice trials in which conditions were randomized. Subjects\nscoring six or more correct on these randomized trials were allowed to move on to the\ngame proper; 12 subjects who failed to reach that threshold received an additional set of\n10 practice trials. Most of these 12 were among the younger subjects, who may have been\nparticularly distracted by the presence of schoolmates and friends. After a player finished, the\nplayer's proportion of correct responses and mean response time, along with the initials and\nresults of the previous 10 players, were displayed on a large computer monitor visible to the\nplayer and to any onlookers. Video 1 affords a player's eye perspective on the game.\nExperimental Design and Results\nDuring the approximately 5 minutes of play, each player had the opportunity to judge and\nrespond to 60 fish. For half the fish, the frequency of its size oscillation and the frequency of\nthe concurrent amplitude modulation were Congruent, that is, both were the same, either\n6 Hz or 8 Hz; for the other half of the fish, size and sound amplitude modulation were\nIncongruent, that is, they were at different frequencies. Specifically, the fish sinusoidally\noscillated in size, either at 6 Hz or 8 Hz, while the concurrent sound amplitude modulated\nat the other frequency, that is, 8 Hz or 6 Hz. For indices of audiovisual integration, we\ncontrasted players' performance with Congruent fish to their performance with Incongruent\nfish, using as metrics the proportion of categorizations that were correct, and the latency of\nresponse on correct trials; 60 test participants completed the entire 5-minute game; their ages\nranged from 82 years down to 6 years, the youngest age we had permission to test. Figure 2\nshows the age distribution of the players.\nThe 60 fish each player saw and heard were uniformly distributed across four categories\ndefined by the two species of fish (good fish--6 Hz oscillation in size and bad fish--8 Hz\noscillation in size), crossed with two types of congruence (Congruent audiovisual signals and\nIncongruent audiovisual signals). For each subject, this 2 \u00c2 2 design produced just 15 trials\nper cell, too few samples for stable estimates of the dependent measures. For example, with\nonly 15 samples and binomial variability, a change of just a single response would produce a\nswing of more than 13%. To reduce the impact of having so few samples per condition, while\nmaintaining the focus on audiovisual interaction, we aggregated responses into just two\ncategories: All fish whose audiovisual signals were Congruent and all fish whose\naudiovisual signals were Incongruent. In so doing, we ignored the frequency at which any\nparticular fish varied in size.\nData analysis began by comparing the accuracy with which players responded to\nCongruent and Incongruent fish. Audiovisual Congruent fish were correctly categorized\nmore often than were Incongruent fish. The mean difference between the two proportions\nFigure 2. Age distribution of participants who completed the entire 5-minute game. Each bin spans\nGoldberg et al. 5\nresponses made to Congruent and Incongruent fish were entered into a one-sample t test,\nWe next focused on response times from trials on which correct responses were made.\nMental chronometry (Posner, 2005) treats a response time as a composite of separable\ncomponents. Commonly, such components include movement time (MT), the time\nrequired to execute a motor response, and reaction time, the time needed to perceive and\nprocess the stimulus and to select the response. As Doucet and Stelmack (1999) noted,\nreaction time is influenced by the information processing demands of the subject's task,\nwhile MT may not be. Fish Police!!'s accelerometer records allowed us to estimate MT.\nThe accelerometer's tilt reading was reset to zero when a fish first appeared, providing a\nbaseline against which all subsequent tilts were evaluated. We examined successive 60 Hz\nsamples generated by the tablet's accelerometer in order to find the time sample at which the\ntablet was first tilted 17  either toward or away from the player. As explained earlier, this\ntime sample defined the trial's response time. Later, an algorithm made an offline search of\nthe stored accelerometer samples from each trial in order to find the trial's first sample that\nsatisfied our criterion: The sample represented the tilt of the tablet in the same `direction' as\nthe trial's ultimate 17  tilt, and the sample was not followed by any reversal in direction of\ntilt. The time associated with the sample that satisfied both these criteria was used to define\nthe trial's reaction time (Table 1). The trial's MT was defined by the difference between the\ntrial's reaction time and its response time.\nThe mean MT for Congruent fish was 175.58 ms; the corresponding mean for Incongruent\nfish was 162.88 ms. The difference between these two means was not statistically significant,\n60 Hz sampling rate of the accelerometer introduced some irreducible uncertainty into our\nmental chronometric estimates. Moreover, one subject continuously jiggled the handheld\ntablet, making it impossible to extract reaction time and MT from his/her records; that\nsubject's data were excluded from further analysis.\nFigure 3. Left: Mean proportion correct responses for Congruent and Incongruent Fish. Right: Mean\nreaction time for Congruent and Incongruent Fish. Error bars are within-subject standard errors of the mean.\nEach trial's MT was subtracted from its response time, yielding the reaction time for that\ntrial. Thereafter, all chronometric analyses were done on values of this derived reaction time\nvariable. Players' reaction times were significantly shorter for Congruent fish than for\nIncongruent ones. The mean difference between the two sets of reaction times was 59.21\naccuracy, produced reliable differences between players' processing of Congruent and\nIncongruent fish (Figure 3).\nWe were interested in the possibility that subjects might have been trading accuracy for\nspeed of response (Beilock, Bertenthal, Hoerger, & Carr, 2008; Heitz, 2014; Wickelgren,\n1977). Viewing each fish for a longer time could have allowed additional visual\ninformation to accumulate, thereby increasing the proportion of correct responses\n(Mazurek, Roitman, Ditterich, & Shadlen, 2003; Noppeney, Ostwald, & Werner, 2010).\nMore recently, Teichert, Ferrera, and Grinband (2014) showed that subjects strategically\nincrease response accuracy by delaying the onset of their decisions. Would players whose\nreaction times were long tend to produce a higher proportion of correct responses? To\nevaluate this potential connection between players' speed and accuracy, we examined the\ncorrelation between the two measures. In Figure 4, the effect of audiovisual congruence as\nrepresented by reaction time is plotted against the effect of audiovisual congruence as\nrepresented by accuracy. These two measures of the congruency effect were not\nwhatever factors contributed to differences in the way that players were affected by\naudiovisual congruence, these factors did not include adoption of some consistent speed-\naccuracy strategy.\nPrevious studies suggested that in humans, audiovisual integration emerges late in the first\nyear of life (Neil, Chee-Ruiter, Scheier, Lewkowicz, & Shimojo, 2006), but continues to be\nfine-tuned until somewhat later. Moreover, at least one study (Roudaia, Sekuler, Bennett, &\nSekuler, 2013) showed weakened audiovisual interaction in older adults. All of these studies\nused audiovisual stimuli and tasks that were quite different from those embodied in our\ngame. Although we were limited to testing subjects 6 years of age and older, we thought it\nwould be worthwhile to evaluate how audiovisual interaction in Fish Police!! varied with age.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the results of this inquiry for accuracy and reaction time measures,\nrespectively. The slopes and confidence intervals from linear regressions showed that neither\ncongruence effect was statistically significant: for reaction time, p \u00bc 0.13, and for accuracy,\np \u00bc 0.82. The 95% confidence intervals around the slope of regression against players' age\nmeasures of congruence, respectively.\nTable 1.

Left:\nEffect of congruence expressed as the difference between percent correct judgments when auditory and\nvisual frequencies were Congruent and when they were Incongruent. Right: The effect of congruence\nexpressed as the difference in reaction times for Congruent and Incongruent fish.\nDiscussion\nResults with each dependent measure were consistent with those from a comparable task\nstudied in a controlled, laboratory setting (Sun et al., 2014). In addition to differences in the\nlevel of distractions, the experiments comprising the laboratory study differed in multiple\nways from the conditions in the Museum of Science. For example, they differed in size of the\ndisplay (33  vs. $14\u00ad15  visual angle wide), response modes (button press vs. tablet tilt),\nnumber of trials each subject experienced ($300 vs. 60), interfish intervals ($2 vs. 3 seconds),\nand number of subjects per experiment (10 vs. 60). Table 2 shows that despite these\ndifferences, the main outcomes of the present study are not dramatically different from\nwhat was seen in the three laboratory experiments. The absence of strong differences\namong venues and conditions points to the robustness of audiovisual integration that\narises from temporally correlated auditory and visual signals.\nMoreover, results from the Museum and from the laboratory show that the effect of\ntemporal correlation of auditory and visual signals is strong enough to survive even with\nno corresponding spatial correlation between visual and auditory information. That is, the\nspatial information provided by vision (the fish's progress across the virtual stream) was not\nmatched by a comparable change in auditory spatial information (such as a change in\ninteraural time difference).\nAs explained above, results from the two dependent measures (Figure 4) suggest that\ndifferences among players' accuracy could not be explained simply by differences in their\nstrategies for balancing the competing demands for speed and accuracy. It seems likely that\nthe time constraints imposed by the game design (allowing just 2 seconds to respond) created\nhigh pressure that might have a particular effect on players tested at the Museum of Science.\nEach player had just a few minutes total experience with the game. As a result, it may be that\nthe time pressure had a greater impact on them than it would have had on more experienced\nplayers (Beilock et al., 2008). Although we cannot be certain, it is plausible that instructions\nthat mentioned the cost of a missed response and called attention to the time varying green\nprogress bar near the top of the display encouraged players to prioritize speed of response.\nThat speculation is consistent with the observation that very few responses, only 28 out of\nIn our video game, whenever a fish's auditory and visual attributes were not congruent, the\nrate at which the fish's sound was amplitude modulated not only did not match the rate of its\nsize oscillation but also actually matched the visual modulation rate of fish from the\ncompeting type, either ``good'' or ``bad'' species. This particular form of mismatch\nbetween auditory and visual signals was intended to maximize stimulus-response\nTable 2.

Each entry is the absolute value of the mean difference in responses to Congruent and Incongruent fish.\nGoldberg et al. 9\ninterference (Fitts & Deininger, 1954), which was expected to maximize observed differences\nbetween responses to Congruent and Incongruent fish.\nPlanning this project made us mindful of the many differences between a public or quasi-\npublic research environment and the well-controlled dedicated research laboratories in which\nwe have been studying various aspects of audiovisual interactions (Benussen et al., 2014; Sun\net al., 2014). Anticipating that other researchers might want to carry out a project in a setting\nlike the one we found at the Museum, we offer some suggestions for optimizing such\nopportunities.\nOf course, visual distractions and background noise are unavoidable in public spaces. In\nthe Living Laboratory, visual distractions included the Museum's nearby scientific\nattractions, the stream of curious passers-by, as well as players' friends, relatives and, for\nschool age players, their classmates, and teachers. To minimize these and other potential\nvisual distractions, we took the simple step of seating participants so that they faced a blank\nwall, with backs turned toward onlookers. Appreciable noise was generated by nearby\ninteractive exhibits and by the chatter of excited visitors to Museum, particularly younger\nvisitors. These sounds were consistently $76 to 80 dB SPL. To control the impact of audio\ndistractions, participants wore Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Canceling Headphones\nwhile playing the game. These provided $30 dB attenuation. This reduction in background\nsound helped subjects focus on the task, with reduced influence from the occasional heckling\nor encouragement of family or friends, or by the general din of the Museum.\nAs mentioned earlier, a publicly viewable video monitor displayed each player's initials,\nscore, along with the scores of the previous 10 players. This leader board seemed to motivate\nplayers, particularly when a pair of museum-goers decided that they would be competing\nagainst one another. The leader board was helpful also to players who did not do well, as it\nshowed them that there was considerable variation among players. In this regard, the leader\nboard was particularly helpful to parents of children whose play was good, but not perfect.\nA less than perfect score made some players' parent ask what was ``wrong'' with their child.\nSeeing the scores of the preceding 10 players helped to provide a reassuring answer to that\nquestion. Finally, the leader board encouraged some players to ask a scientifically important,\nbut difficult question, namely, why success varied as it did from one player to another. For\nthat question, we have yet to develop a satisfactory answer.\nEven if some planned project does not entail auditory stimuli, researchers might still\nconsider some technique to attenuate extraneous sounds. The noise canceling headphones\nworn while subjects played Fish Police!! were particularly useful, as they served two purposes.\nFirst, the headphones reduced the saliency of the extraneous sounds that were plentiful in the\nMuseum setting; second, the headphones signaled to onlookers, particularly friends or family\nmembers, that the headphone's wearer was engaged in an important task and therefore\nshould not be disturbed.\nIn settings like the Museum of Science, many visitors are eager to take part in an activity\nthat simultaneously is enjoyable and advances science. An experiment should be engaging\nand provide a vehicle for subjects to become interested in science and learn about real world\napplications of research. Embedding an experiment in a game is one effective way to achieve\nthese goals. As researchers, we were gratified that so many of the Museum visitors who\nplayed Fish Police!! were interested in how their data would be used and how their results\nwould impact science. For their participation and contribution, we are most appreciative.\nConflict of Interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nSupported by CELEST, an NSF Science of Learning Center (SBE-0354378).
