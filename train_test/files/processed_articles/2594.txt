The consistency of these differ-\nences have lead some to call race, in addition to class and\ngender, a fundamental cause of disease (Link & Phelan,\nthe argument is not that race biologically determines differ-\nences, but rather that race embodies access to resources,\nsuch as income and power, which in turn shape health. In\nthe United States, lacking a high school degree or living\nbelow the poverty line is associated with up to 12 fewer\nyears of life and up to 16 fewer years of life without disease\nIn this context, race is a social construct (D. R. Williams,\nMohammed, Leavell, & Collins, 2010; D. R. Williams &\nSternthal, 2010). Differential access to resources, such as\nincome and education, plays a large role in explaining racial\ndifferences in health (D. R. Williams et al., 2010). In addition\nto class, gender patterns racial differences in health. Racial dif-\nferences, particularly the role of class and behavioral risk fac-\ntors as mediators, vary between men and women (Cummings\nexample, race differences are larger among women as com-\npared to men for outcomes like cardiovascular mortality and\nassociated behavioral risk factors like obesity (Gallant &\nBut, although the links between race and morbidity and\nmortality are well elucidated, more recent evidence linking\nrace to biological disease processes is less well developed,\ndespite the potential utility of examining biological pro-\ncesses that underlie the development of diseases patterned\nby race. Systemic inflammation is a logical place to start\ngiven its links to numerous diseases (i.e., diabetes, cardiac\nproblems) commonly patterned by race and because although\nit is clear that race and inflammation, specifically C-reactive\nprotein (CRP), are highly correlated, the pathways linking\nrace to CRP are not well elucidated. CRP is an acute phase\nprotein that is considered a marker for systemic inflamma-\ntion. In hundreds of studies, it has been prospectively asso-\nciated with disease outcomes ranging from cardiac disease\nto diabetes and strokes (for reviews see Dehghan et al.,\net al., 2009).Although there is a dispute regarding the causal\nprocesses linking CRP to disease, elevated CRP levels are\nseen as a risk factor for disease (Lawlor et al., 2008).\nStudies have demonstrated that race strongly patterns CRP\n(Gruenwald, Cohen, Matthews, Tracy, & Seeman, 2009;\nThe Social Patterns of a Biological Risk Factor for\nDisease: Race, Gender, Socioeconomic Position, and\nC-reactive Protein\nPamela Herd,1,2 Amelia Karraker,2 and Elliot Friedman3\n1Department of Public Affairs, 2Department of Sociology, and 3Institute on Aging, University of Wisconsin, Madison\nObjective. Understand the links between race and C-reactive protein (CRP), with special attention to gender differences\nand the role of class and behavioral risk factors as mediators.\nMethod. This study utilizes the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project data, a nationally representative study\nof older Americans aged 57\u00ad85 to explore two research questions. First, what is the relative strength of socioeconomic\nversus behavioral risk factors in explaining race differences in CRP levels? Second, what role does gender play in under-\nstanding race differences? Does the relative role of socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors in explaining race differ-\nences vary when examining men and women separately?\nResults. When examining men and women separately, socioeconomic and behavioral risk factor mediators vary in\ntheir importance. Indeed, racial differences in CRP among men aged 57\u00ad74 are little changed after adjusting for both\nsocioeconomic and behavioral risk factors with levels 35% higher for black men as compared to white men. For women\naged 57\u00ad74, however, behavioral risk factors explain 30% of the relationship between race and CRP.\nDiscussion. The limited explanatory power of socioeconomic position and, particularly, behavioral risk factors,\nin elucidating the relationship between race and CRP among men, signals the need for research to examine addi-\ntional mediators, including more direct measures of stress and discrimination.\nKey Words: Behavioral risk factors--Gender--Inflammation--Race.\nMcDade et al., 2010). Though similar to racial differences\nin morbidity and mortality, there is evidence that racial dif-\nferences in CRP may shrink in old age. Explanations for this\ncrossover include mortality selection, only the \"hardiest\"\nAfrican Americans survive to the oldest ages, and data\nquality problems, particularly age misreporting by African\nCRP, as a marker for systemic inflammation, is an important\noutcome when considering racial differences, especially in\nthe context of the fundamental cause framework. Inflamma-\ntion is linked to multiple disease outcomes and the link\nbetween race and health is not disease specific; the patterns\nexist across a range of morbidity and mortality outcomes,\nmany of which (i.e., heart disease, strokes, diabetes) are\nmany diseases linked to CRP levels, like cardiovascular\ndisease and diabetes, are racially patterned (Hayward et al.,\na range of diseases and mortality risks makes CRP relevant\nfor investigations of its links to race.\nClass and Behaviors\nTo date, however, the existing research has not fully elu-\ncidated how class and behavioral risk factors mediate the\nrelationship between race and CRP. Though studies have\nexplored whether socioeconomic position (SEP) and behav-\nioral risk factors mediate the relationship between race and\nCRP, the power of behavioral risk factors, independent of\nclass, is not clear. As already noted, race is a crucial determi-\nnant of class--discrimination, both current and institutional,\nhas shaped education and income differences between\nblacks and whites (Wilson, 2009). In turn, there is a large\nbody of work demonstrating that class--especially educa-\ntion--is a determinant of behaviors (Herd, 2010; Mirowsky\n& Ross, 2003). Thus, if one simply adjusts for behaviors,\nwithout having adjusted for SEP, it is not clear whether the\nexplanatory power of behaviors to explain race differences\nin CRP simply reflects the explanatory power of class, espe-\ncially educational attainment. Many studies focused on how\nbehavioral risk factors mediate the relationship between race\nand CRP, however, have not adjusted for SEP as a mediator\n(Albert, Glynn, Buring, & Ridker, 2004).\nFurther, the few studies that have included both SEP and\nbehavioral risk factors, to account for race differences, have\ngenerally not adjusted for behavioral risk factors separate\nfrom other factors (McDade et al., 2010) or are based on\nsmall unrepresentative samples (McDade, Hawkley, &\nCacioppo, 2006). For example, McDade and colleagues\n(2010) add behavioral risk factors to the model simulta-\nneously with measures of chronic disease burden, sleep\nquality, marital status, depressive symptoms, and house-\nhold cleanliness. Consequently, it is impossible to estab-\nlish the extent to which behavioral risk factors, specifically,\nmediate racial differences in CRP. A study conducted by\nKelley-Hedgepeth and colleagues (2008) did find that obesity\nexplained a larger fraction of the race difference in CRP than\ndid SEP, but the sample includes only women ages 42\u00ad52\nwith intact uteruses and ovaries. In sum, prior studies do not\nmake clear the extent to which behaviors explain relation-\nships between race and CRP, after adjusting for SEP.\nGender\nBut, although attention has been paid to SEP and behav-\nioral risk factors as mediators in the relationship between\nrace and CRP, the literature on racial differences in CRP has\npaid almost no attention to gender. There is especially\nlimited evidence regarding how the roles of socioeconomic\nand behavioral risk factors differ when examining men and\nwomen separately. Studies that consider gender generally\nare not based on nationally representative samples and are\nnot explicitly focused on explaining racial differences in CRP\non health and health behaviors, however, would indicate\nthat there may be important gender differences in how racial\ndifferences in CRP manifest themselves. For example, some\nhealth differences appear to be particularly acute for African-\nAmerican women including cardiovascular mortality and\nassociated behavioral risk factors like obesity (Cummings\nbehavioral risk factors like physical inactivity and obesity,\nwhich are tightly linked to CRP and inflammation more\nbroadly, are larger among women than among men (Gallant &\nthat class differences (as measured by income, education,\nand occupation) in health also vary across gender (Mathews,\nManor, & Power, 1999; McDonough, Williams, House, &\nConsequently, using the National Social Life, Health, and\nAging Project (NSHAP) data, a study of older Americans\naged 57\u00ad85, we elucidate the relationship between race and\nCRP by focusing on two questions. First, what is the rela-\ntive role of socioeconomic versus behavioral risk factors in\nexplaining racial differences in CRP levels? Second, what\nrole does gender play in understanding racial differences?\nDoes the role of socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors\ndiffer when examining men and women separately?\nMethods\nData\nsentative study of noninstitutionalized older adults aged 57\u00ad85.\nThe NSHAP data contains information on the demographic\ncharacteristics; romantic, sexual, and social relationships;\nand physical and mental health--including biomarkers--of\nresponse rate was 74.8% (O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, &\nSmith 2009). Data was collected via in-home interviews\nand a mail-back questionnaire.\nThe NSHAP sample was chosen from a multistage area\nprobability design selected by the Institute for Social Research\nfor the Health and Retirement Study (O'Muircheartaigh\net al., 2009). NSHAP oversampled blacks and Latinos and\nbalanced age and gender subgroups (O'Muircheartaigh et al.,\ndents, a random 70% sample was asked to provide blood\nsamples. Williams and McDade (2009) reported that respon-\ndents who refused to provide blood spots did not differ from\nthose who agreed by gender, race, ethnicity, age, education,\nincome, marital status, self-rated physical or mental health,\nor number of doctor visits in the past year.\nAs is standard in this literature, we excluded another 136\ncases that had high CRP levels, which may be indicative of\nacute illness (Pearson et al., 2003). NSHAP collected CRP\nlevels from dried blood spots. Different cutoff criteria for\nmaximum CRP levels have been established for plasma versus\nblood spot samples (McDade, Burhop, & Dohnal, 2004).\nA plasma level of 10 mg/L roughly corresponds to a blood\nspot level of 8.6 mg/L, so CRP levels greater than 8.6 mg/L\nare excluded from the analytic sample (see McDade et al.,\n2010). Regardless, sensitivity tests demonstrated no mean-\ningful differences in the pattern of findings when including\neven the highest CRP values.\nWe dealt with missing values on covariates by employing\nwere missing data on income (Rubin, 2004). We did not\nimpute data for an additional 46 cases missing data on\nrace. We imputed 10 values for each missing observation\n(i.e., income), averaged those coefficients and importantly\ncalculated new standard errors (SEs) that account for the\nvariation across multiple potential imputed values. This is a\nbetter strategy for missing data issues than stepwise deletion\nbecause it reduces concerns about selection that could bias\nthe findings (Rubin, 2004). Further, multiple imputation also\nadjusts SEs to reflect the error associated with imputation.\nWe ended with a total sample of 1,757. Because of the\nrandomized modular design of the survey, survey weights\nused (which include nonresponse by age and urbanicity) are\nlikely adequate to account for additional selection.\nMeasures\nOutcome.--CRP was obtained in NSHAP via blood spot\nsamples, which were collected on filter paper (Williams &\nMcDade, 2009). This method of CRP data collection has\nbeen shown to be precise and reliable (McDade et al., 2004).\nBecause CRP levels were highly skewed, values were (natural)\nlog transformed.\nCovariates.--Demographics: Race is based on self-reported\ndata. We classified respondents as Black non-Hispanic,\nWhite non-Hispanic, and Hispanic. We employed an age\ncentered (at age 68) term. Sex is male or female.\nSEP.--We employed two measures of SEP. The first\nmeasure is educational attainment, which includes five cat-\negories: no high school degree, high school degree, some\ncollege, college, and graduate degree. Income includes pre-\ntax household income from wages, pensions, social security,\nand government assistance. Some studies have shown that\nlow-income groups, but not moderate-income groups, had\nsignificantly higher levels of inflammatory markers com-\npared to high-income groups (Friedman & Herd, 2010).\nTo allow for such nonlinear associations, we stratified\nthe sample into income quintiles. The income ranges that\ncoded and included in statistical analyses with the bottom\nquintile serving as the referent. We did test a linear version\nof the income measure, but found the results did not vary.\nPhysical health.--Health measures are included to help\nreduce the risk for reverse causality in the SEP\u00adCRP rela-\ntionship. Significant health problems affect SEP (i.e., disease\nonset inhibits both educational attainment and labor market\nparticipation). Adjusting for existing/known health prob-\nlems reduces the risk for reverse causality. In short, after\nadjusting for health, higher CRP levels are more plausibly\na risk factor for disease, though we cannot rule out the pos-\nsibility that there are some underlying unobserved health\ndifferences.\nPhysical health status was assessed using self-reported\nmeasures. We classified participants as having a particular\ncondition if a doctor had ever told them that they had the\nfollowing conditions: hypertension, diabetes or high blood\nsugar, chronic pulmonary disease/emphysema, heart attack,\nheart failure, operation to unclog or bypass arteries, asthma,\nstroke, or arthritis. These measures, which have been linked\nto inflammation, are included as individual dummy vari-\nables for each reported condition. Further, we adjust for\ngeneral self-assessed health. Respondents answered the fol-\nlowing question \"How would you rate your physical health:\nexcellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\" Self-reported\ngeneral health appears to capture much of the health-related\nvariation in CRP.\nPrescription drugs.--Many drugs, both prescription and\nover-the-counter, including antihypertensive, cholesterol\nlowering, and antidepressant, have been shown to have\nanti-inflammatory properties (Jaim & Ridker, 2005; Kenis &\nBuring, & Manson, 1999). Further, steroid medications, par-\nticularly as part of a hormone replacement regimen, have\nbeen shown to increase CRP levels. Dummy-coded variables\nindicating current use of these medications were included in\nall analyses. Specifically, we included measures for choles-\nterol absorption inhibitor medication, combination antihy-\nperlipidemic medication, estrogens, progestin, nonsteroidal\nantiinflammatories, steroids, and antidepressants. These\ndrugs were categorized using the Multum Drug Database:\nLexicon Plus version (Qato et al., 2008).\nBehavioral risk factors.--We include body mass index\n(BMI). We also included smoking measures, which capture\nwhether the respondent is a current smoker, former smoker,\nor never smoked. Finally, we include measures of physical\nactivity. These include little exercise (<4 times/month)\nmoderate (1\u00ad2 times/week), and heavy (3 times/week).\nAnalytic Techniques\nThe relationship between CRP and SEP, race/ethnicity,\nand gender was examined using ordinary least-squares\nregression, which included weights and statistical adjust-\nments for the NSHAP sample frame (O'Muircheartaigh\net al., 2009). We based our determination of whether and\nto what extent covariates mediated the relationship be-\ntween race and CRP employing standards set by Baron\nand Kenny (1986) mediation test. Step 1 requires that the\nindependent variable (in this case race) significantly affects\nthe mediator. Step 2 requires that the independent vari-\nable significantly affects the dependent variable in the\nabsence of the mediator. Step 3 requires that the mediator\nhave an independent relationship with the dependent var-\niable. Step 4 requires that the mediator reduce the inde-\npendent variable to zero for full mediation. We consider\nboth the statistical significance and the change in the size of\nthe race coefficient. We are explicit in the results regarding\nthe exact percent size reduction.\nThe first set of analyses is conducted on the full sample to\naddress two research questions. First, are there racial differ-\nences in CRP adjusting for self-reported health measures?\nThus, Model 1 includes gender, race/ethnicity, age centered\nat age 68, self-rated general physical health, medications,\nand chronic conditions (see Table 1 for detailed health\nmeasures). Model 2 adds an age and race interaction term to\ntest whether racial differences in CRP vary across age groups.\nSecond, what explains racial differences in CRP levels?\nModel 3 tests for the role of SEP by including income\nand education. Model 4 tests for the role of behavioral risk\nfactors by including BMI, smoking behavior, and exercise\nfrequency.\nThe second set of analyses breaks the sample down by\nsensitivity analyses testing interaction terms, indicate that\nsubanalyses by age are appropriate.As we already discussed,\nfindings of racial convergence in morbidity and mortality at\nolder ages is nearly universal, likely due to survivor selec-\ntion (Johnson, 2000). Further, separate analyses for men\nand women are important given prior research, discussed in\nthe Introduction, that indicates important gender differences\nin how racial differences in CRP may manifest themselves\nvia SEP and behavioral risk factors. Model 1 includes race,\nage, self-rated general physical health, medications, and\nchronic conditions to establish baseline racial differences for\nwomen as compared to men. Model 2 adds SEP variables\n(education and income) to establish the extent to which SEP\nmediates the relationship between race and CRP separately\nfor men versus women. Model 3 adds BMI, smoking\nbehavior, and exercise frequency to test the extent to which\nbehavioral risk factors mediate the relationship between\nrace and CRP separately for men versus women.\nResults\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics on the dependent\nvariable and covariates, in addition to differences in the\ncovariates by race. As expected there are significant racial\ndifferences in CRP levels, socioeconomic covariates, behav-\nioral risk covariates, and health covariates. Blacks have higher\nCRP levels, lower SEP levels, and more behavioral risk\nfactors as compared to Whites.\nCRP levels remain significantly higher amongst blacks\nas compared to whites, after adjusting for sex, age, health\ncovariates, and prescription drug use, in this sample of those\nlevels 33% points higher than comparable whites. But that\nvariation is age graded (Table 2, Model 2). At older ages\n(sensitivity analyses indicate above age 75\u00ad80), those dif-\nferences become insignificant, both statistically and in\nterms of coefficient size (results shown in greater detail in\nTable 3). In short, there is racial crossover in CRP levels\namong the oldest sample respondents. This finding is robust\ngiven that NSHAP oversampled blacks over age 80. Although\nthe main effects for Hispanics were not significant, there\nwas an interaction between ethnicity and age. At older ages,\nthe differences between whites and Hispanic CRP levels\nwiden. Because this is a cross section and because who\ncomprises Hispanics (nation of origin/immigration status/\nSES) has changed over time, it is difficult to make a mean-\ningful interpretation of the positive interaction between age\nand Hispanic ethnicity.\nDoes SEP explain racial differences? In model 3, after\nincluding SEP covariates, the size of the race effect drops\nCompared to those without a high school degree, those\nwith high school degrees, college degrees, and professional\nrespectively, though the difference between those with\ncollege degrees and high school degrees was marginally sta-\ntistically significant (p < .10). Finally, the gender coefficient\nshrinks from .19 to .16, with women having higher levels com-\npared to men indicating that SEP differences between men\nand women play some role in explaining gender differences.\nTable 1.

The inclusion of\nBMI, physical activity, and smoking patterns moderately\nreduces the race coefficient from .26 to .22, a 15% reduction.\nThough both SEP and behavioral risk factors moderately\nweaken the relationship between race and CRP, the differ-\nences remain statistically significant.\nTable 3 tackles our second research question. What role\ndoes gender play in understanding racial differences? Does\nthe role of socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors differ\nwhen examining men and women separately? Given both\nprior evidence and evidence in Table 2 of weakening racial\ndifferences in CRP at older ages, we further broke the\nanalyses down by age (those over and under age 75).\nTable 3 demonstrates that racial differences shrink signif-\nicantly after age 75. Basic racial differences in CRP are just\nslightly larger for men than for women under age 75 (Model\n1a and Model 1b), whereas the racial differences are not\nsignificant for either women or men age 75\u00ad85 (Model 1c\nand Model 1d).\nSeparate analyses for men and women in Models 2a\u00ad2d\nindicate that SEP explains 16%\u00ad18% of the racial variation\nin CRP for both men and women.

It should be noted, how-\never, that even though NSHAP oversampled individuals\naged 75 and older there are some groups, such as women with\nprofessional degrees that are quite small.

In the full sample, SEP and\nbehavioral risk factors explain relatively equivalent amounts\nof the relationship between race and CRP. Racial differ-\nences are not fully explained by socioeconomic and behav-\nioral risk factor mediators. Examining women and men\nseparately produced some interesting findings, however.\nFirst, behavioral risk factors explained nearly 30% of the\nrelationship between race and CRP for women aged 57\u00ad74,\nas compared to SEP, which explained 13% of the relation-\nship. However for men, although SEP did account for a\nfraction of the relationship, behavioral risk factors actually\nsuppressed racial differences in CRP among men aged 57\u00ad74.\nThus after adjusting for both SEP and behavioral risk fac-\ntors, race differences in CRP were little different than\nmodels accounting for neither factor.\nSimilar to prior studies, we find diminishing racial differ-\nences in CRP at the oldest ages. It is unlikely that this dimin-\nishment is a cohort effect resulting from cross-sectional\ndata. Indeed, racial differences should be larger in older\ncohorts given general improvements in economic well being\nand declining discrimination for younger cohorts. Healthy\nsurvivor selection likely plays a role in these declining differ-\nences at the oldest ages (Preston & Elo, 2006).\nWe also find that SEP, particularly education, and behav-\nioral risk factors help explain racial differences in CRP\nlevels. In the full sample, SEP and behavioral risk factors\neach explain approximately 15%\u00ad20% of the relationship\nbetween race and CRP, though the relationship remains\nstatistically significant even after adjusting for both. The\ninclusion of behavioral risk factors also mediated SEP differ-\nences in CRP, which parallels findings in the existing litera-\nMezuk, Abdou, Rafferty, & Jackson , 2010; Lubbock, Goh,\nAli, Ritchie, & Whooley, 2005). And similar to our findings,\nexisting research generally does not find that behaviors\nfully explain relationship between SEP and inflammation\ncolleagues (2008) do find it explains much of the relation-\nship for CRP, though not for an alternative marker for\ninflammation, fibrinogen.\nAlthough behavioral risk factors play an important role in\nexplaining racial differences in CRP levels, racial differences\nin behavioral risk factors may reflect coping mechanisms\nto manage stress and distress (Kershaw et al., 2009; Kim,\nBursac, DiLillo, White, & West, 2009; Lewis, Aiello,\nFor example, stress from discrimination may affect eating\npatterns and substance abuse (Borrell et al., 2007). This dis-\ntinction is important because it implies that these behaviors\nmay not be individualized and easily modifiable, but are a\nreaction to the stress associated with deprivation and discrim-\nWhen testing mediation effects separately for men and for\nwomen, the models indicated that SEP explained relatively\nsimilar amounts of the racial difference in CRP. Indeed,\nresearch examining the relationship between SEP and CRP\nhas tended to find either no gender difference or a slightly\nlarger relationship for women as compared to men (Gruenwald\nIt is worth noting, however, that these studies were based on\nsamples that were either younger than our sample (Gruenwald\nMost striking was that among men aged 57\u00ad75, after\nadjusting for both SEP and behavioral risk factors, racial\ndifferences in CRP levels were almost unchanged. SEP did\nexplain 18% of the difference, but behavioral risk factors\nwere actually suppressing racial differences. So after adjusting\nfor both SEP and behavioral risk factors, racial differences\nwere nearly the same as when not adjusting for SEP and\nbehavioral risk factors. These findings parallel prior work\non young black men (Gruenwald et al., 2009).\nUnlike for men, behavioral risk factors explained 33% of\nthe racial differences in CRP among women and their inclu-\nsion reduced the race coefficient to marginal statistical\nsignificance. The difference in BMI as a mediator for racial\ndifferences for women as compared to men is likely rooted\nin the fact that there are no meaningful racial differences in\nBMI among men, but relatively large racial differences in BMI\namong women. Indeed, Kelley-Hedgepeth and colleagues\n(2008) find that BMI explains much of the racial differences\namong women, though they did not analyze men. Further,\nthere is existing evidence that BMI is a more important\nmediator between SEP and CRP for women than for men\n(Gruenwald et al. 2009) and that BMI helps explain most of\nthe higher CRP levels in women compared to men (Cartier\nfind the mediated effect of diet was stronger for women than\nfor men. Khera and colleagues (2009) find that body fat is a\nmore important predictor of CRP in women than in men.\nWhat explains the remaining racial differences in CRP\nlevels, especially among men? One hypothesis that should be\npursued in future work is the potential effects of stress, par-\nticularly discrimination. Indeed, fundamental cause theory\nwould argue that race is a fundamental cause, separate from,\nthough related to SEP precisely because of racial discrimi-\nnation. As noted earlier, the fact that behavioral differences\nplay a role in explaining racial differences, at least for\nwomen, may reflect coping patterns to manage stress and\ndistress. There may be other ways that stress operates for\nblack men that are not measured in this study. There is\ngrowing evidence that stress is linked to higher levels of\ninflammation (Fuligni et al., 2009; Kiecolt-Glaser et al.,\nSeeman, 2006). For example, a recent meta-analysis of\nlaboratory studies concluded that acute psychological\nstressors produce increases in circulating levels of in-\nflammatory proteins, including CRP (Steptoe, Hamer, &\nRacial discrimination is thought to represent a particu-\nlarly noxious type of chronic stress that is linked to a\nrange of adverse health outcomes in blacks, and there is\nrecent evidence that chronic discrimination is associated\nwith higher levels of CRP in black adults (Lewis et al., 2010)\nand in E-selectin in a sample of older adults (Friedman,\nWilliams, Singer, & Ryff, 2009). Further, discrimination\nis linked to heart disease--coronary calcification and\nbehavioral risk factors (Borrell et al., 2007; Lewis et al.,\n2010). Future research must consider chronic stress gen-\nerally, and experiences of discrimination specifically, as\npotential contributors to racial differences in systemic\ninflammation.\nAlthough this study does not fully explain what mediates\nrace difference in CRP, it does make clear that the path-\nways mediating racial differences in CRP may be dif-\nferent for men and women.And that for men, in particular,\nbehavioral risk factors do little to explain the racial pat-\nterning of CRP.\n"
