    "abstract": "Abstract\nYoung women are increasingly diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. The aim of this study was\nto test various types of mass media and their associations with interpersonal communication about sex and HIV or AIDS\namong female college students, stratified by race. The study used a nonexperimental cross-sectional design and an electronic\nsurvey. The sample consisted of female college students (N = 776) at a 4-year public university in the southeast. We found\nthat the race of college women influenced their preferred media source for reception of information about sex and HIV/\nAIDS, which subsequently either motivated or was insignificant to communication with parents and/or partners.\n",

Message delivery and cultural background\nof the target audience are essential for tailoring mass media\ninterventions.

D.\nBrown et al., 2005); yet there are few research studies\nreported on the association of communication systems and\ninterpersonal relationships in college females. Determining\nmass media influences that might facilitate interpersonal\ncommunication and ultimately affect sexual decision mak-\ning may assist scientists in developing appropriate interven-\ntions that appeal to a population of female college students.\nTherefore, the purpose of this study was to test the associa-\ntions between race, preferred HIV mass media message\nmediums, and interpersonal relationships among female\ncollege students. Mass media is limited to print media,\ntelevision (TV), Internet, and radio. This study addressed\nthe following research questions:\nResearch Question 1: What are the relationships between\nselected demographic characteristics and extent of com-\nmunication with parents, partners, and peers?\nResearch Question 2: Based on race, to what extent does\nthe amount and type of media exposure affect parent and\npartner communication?\nStudy design and research methods have been previously\ndescribed (Chandler, et al, in press). However, we summa-\nrize the study methodology. In brief, a nonexperimental\ncross-sectional design was used. Data were collected via an\nInternet-based survey using the Dillman (2006) Tailored\nDesign Method.\nSample\nA convenience sample (n = 766) of female college students\nages 18 to 21 years attending a 4-year public university in the\nsoutheast was recruited.\nSeveral instruments were combined and placed into an\nelectronic format to test associations between variables. The\nsurveys used included: a demographic questionnaire, the\nAIDS Risk Knowledge Test, The Parent and Peer Influence\nScale, the Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale,\nthe Partner Communication Scale (PCS), and the Sex and\nAIDS Communication Measure. A detailed description of\neach survey has been published (Chandler, et al, in press).\nData Collection Methods\nAfter obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval\nfrom the source institution, an encrypted username/password\nprotected online survey program, Ultimate Survey soft-\nware\u00ae, was used for constructing and revising the survey.\nThis program is designed to distribute electronic recruitment\nmessages with survey links, via email, to a large volume of\nrecipients. Email addresses of the target population were\nobtained from the registrar's office. Using the Tailored\nDesign Method to ensure maximal response rate (Dillman,\n2006), age-eligible female college students could receive a\nmaximum of four email contacts. The second contact was\n7 days after the first, and the third and fourth contacts fol-\nlowed in 7-day increments.\nData Analyses\nThe survey data were exported, in bulk, from the Ultimate\nSurvey\u00ae program and analyzed using the StatisticalAnalysis\nSystem (SAS). The data system was password protected on a\ndedicated computer, to ensure confidentiality with data entry,\nmanagement, and analysis.\nStatistical Methods\nAnalyses were conducted by race, with demographic charac-\nteristics compared by use of student t tests for continuous\nvariables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.\nSimilarly, student t tests were used to compare parent com-\nmunication, partner communication, peer influence, HIV\nknowledge, and perceived risk for HIV/AIDS scores by race.\nSpearman (ranked) correlation coefficients were computed\nto estimate the strength of relationship between various types\nof media exposure and media content and parent and partner\ncommunication scores. Analyses were stratified by race.\nGeneral linear models with interaction terms (race \u00d7 media\nexposure/content variable) were fit to test for evidence of\nheterogeneity by race in the relationships between media\nexposure/content variables and parent and partner communi-\ncation scores. A two-sided p value less than .05 was used to\ndefine statistical significance.\nResults\nThe mean age of the study population was 20 years and did\nnot differ by race; however, Blacks were more likely than\nWhites to be in their freshman year at the time of survey\nparticipation (Table 2). Having a mother who was married\nwas more common in White (74.1%) compared with Black\nstudents (50.0%), and fathers of White students were more\nlikely to be college educated.\nCommunication, Influence, and Knowledge Scores\nCompared with White students, Black students had higher\nmean communication scores with their partners (7.6 vs. 5.9,\np = .002) and a trend toward higher mean communication\ncontrast, White students reported being influenced more by\npeers than Black students. The mean HIV knowledge score\nand perceived risk for HIV/AIDS did not differ statistically\nby race.\n4 SAGE Open\nMedia Exposure and Communication\nIn examining extent of communication with parents, the\nstrongest correlation among White students was for those\nwho reported higher number of hours per week being exposed\nto magazines (R\nS\nwas also observed for Black students (R\nS\nstudents who reported higher levels of exposure to Black\nEntertainment Television (BET; R\nS\n(R\nS\n= .24, p = .02) also reported more communication with\ntheir parents. There was evidence of statistical interaction\n(p = .0003) whereby Blacks exposed to more hours of radio\nper week reported more communication with their parents,\nan association that was not observed in White students.\nIn examining extent of communication with partners,\nhours of Internet exposure per day was positively associated\nwith communication among White students (R\nS\np = .003; Table 4b). A reverse result was indicated in Black\nstudents (R\nS\n= -.14, p = .25), which yielded a statistically\nsignificant interaction effect (p = .02). The other contrary\nfinding with respect to communication with one's partner\nwas a positive correlation for hours of reading per day among\nWhites (R\nS\n= .11, p = .02) and a negative correlation among\nBlacks (R\nS\nMedia Content Exposure and Communication\nIn evaluating exposure to information on sexual behavior\nand risk of HIV/AIDS, relationships with parent communi-\ncation were consistently positive yet small among White stu-\ndents (R\nS\nstatistical power (i.e., Blacks having a much smaller sample\nsize than Whites and lower statistical power), the relation-\nships between exposure to information on sexual behavior\nand risk of HIV/AIDS with parent communication were con-\nsistently positive and somewhat stronger among Black stu-\ndents (R\nS\nAdifferent pattern of association was observed for partner\ncommunication (Table 4b). Specifically, exposure to infor-\nmation on sexual behavior and risk of HIV/AIDS was con-\nsistently positively associated with partner communication\nscores among White students (R\nS\ntrast, there was essentially no association among Black\nTable 2.

Communication, Influence, and Knowledge Scores by\nRace.\nMeasure White Black p\nChandler et al. 5\nstudents for exposure to information on sexual behavior and\nrisk of HIV/AIDS and extent of partner communication.\nDifferential Association of Radio Exposure\nAs depicted in Figure 1, the impact of radio exposure on\nextent of parent and partner communication appeared to dif-\nfer markedly by race. Specifically, Black students had higher\nlevels of communication with their parents than White stu-\ndents when receiving more radio exposure, particularly,\nsheer number of hours per week and items about IV drug use\nand condoms. In contrast, White students had higher levels\nof communication with their partners than Black students\nwhen receiving more radio information about HIV/AIDS\nand IV drug use (Table 5).\nDiscussion\nOur study indicates that race is related to preferred media\nsources for information about sex and HIV/AIDS and sug-\ngests that exposure motivates communication with parents,\npartners, and/or peers. The Kaiser Family Foundation's 2011\nsurvey of Americans on HIV/AIDS reports that media is the\npublic's top source of information about HIV (KFF, 2011).\nAccording to this report, \"six in ten Americans say most of\nwhat they know about HIV/AIDS comes from the media,\nputting it ahead of other sources like school, doctors, friends\nand family.\" Similarly, \"media is the top information source\nfor younger and older adults alike\" (KFF, 2011). Considering\nthat media is a formidable resource for information about\nsexual health and HIV, the results of our study support the\nnotion that message delivery is relevant to interpersonal dia-\nlogue about sex and sexual risk.\nMedia Exposure and Communication\nBlack women reported higher parental and partner commu-\nnication scores when compared with White women; yet,\nhigher rates of STI and HIV/AIDS continue to dispropor-\nBlack women, more hours of radio exposure and BET had a\nsignificant relationship with communication with parents.\nWe infer that the exchanges on sexual behavior and risk of\nHIV/AIDS does not appear to be protective against unde-\nsired health outcomes; hence, a need to facilitate more effec-\ntive dialogue arises.\nTable 4a.

Yet, many of these Black col-\nlege women still regarded their parents, especially their\nmothers, as the most desired source for information about\nintimacy. When parents are hesitant to discuss sex and sexual\nrisks, perhaps such hesitancy is internalized by their children\nand thus avoidance of discussing this subject matter is nor-\nmalized. Avoiding interpersonal conversations about sex cul-\ntivates interest in songs heard on the radio and videos seen on\ntelevision as alternative sources for sex education (J. D.\nBrown & Keller, 2000). Lyrics are personal expressions from\nmusicians and videos portray a fantastical view, but don't\ntypically provide a factual depiction of sex or reveal the\npotential risks. Although hearing and viewing sex laden con-\ntent stimulates curiosity and prompts conversation with par-\nents and partners, it is unknown the extent to which women\nare getting accurate or enough information. In contrast, White\nwomen's exposure to magazines influenced their communi-\ncation with parents. Although specific magazines were not\nexplored, magazines are much more scrutinized with regard\nto information reliability. Thus, by inference, White women\nwho read content in magazines may be more likely to get a\ndetailed and accurate explanation about sex, and simply may\nneed to confirm what was read with their parents.\nMedia Content Exposure and Communication\nUnlike White students, there was no association among\nBlack students for exposure to information about sexual\nbehavior and risk of HIV/AIDS related to partner communi-\ncation. Considering the differences between White and Black\ncollege women's preferred media source, and who they feel\nprompted to talk to about sex when exposed to media about\nintimacy, a detailed assessment of radio and television (e.g.,\nBET) broadcasting statistics and magazine readership might\nreveal specific content to which this population is most often\nexposed. Furthermore, analyzing content from each media\ndomain might be useful to decipher race-related differences\nand outline for organizations and/or researchers culturally-\nspecific media to promote safe sex and HIV prevention. Our\nstudy implies that messages targeting Black women may not\nbe emphasizing the importance of talking with their partners,\nand learning how to effectively communicate with their part-\nners is essential to safe sex practices, including but not lim-\nited to condom negotiation.\nThe limitations of this study have been published\n(Chandler et al, in press ).\nConclusion\nBecause there was no appreciable difference among Blacks\nand Whites in this study with respect to overall knowledge of\nHIV/AIDS, we wonder if there remains a deficit with trans-\nlating information into action. This includes whether these\nwomen are being equipped with the skills to apply the infor-\nmation they do know about HIV/AIDS to their relationships\nwith sexual partners. As one approach, we recommend short\nand informative media (Helme et al., 2011) with a technique\nthat we coined Sex Safety Speed tactics (S3T). Sample topics\ninclude (a) strategies on how to know your partner when sex-\nting, (b) romantic cues and content that reveal important\ninformation before foreplay, (c) making condom-use your\ndecision but keep it sexy, (d) decode your conversation about\nsex with parents.\nChandler et al. 7\nLike other studies, perceived health risk tends to be low\nand knowledge about HIV/AIDS high in adolescent and\nyoung adult populations regardless of race (Lim, Hellard,\nAitken, & Hocking, 2007). Thus, in aggregate, college\nwomen, regardless of race, generally have some basic knowl-\nedge about HIV transmission. However, these women may\nstruggle trying to translate such knowledge into safe sex\npractices. We recommend that future mass media HIV pre-\nvention campaigns integrate messages that help college\nwomen build skills that will facilitate effective interpersonal\ncommunication. In this realm, messages should be custom-\nized to be culturally specific and age appropriate.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdefuye, A.
