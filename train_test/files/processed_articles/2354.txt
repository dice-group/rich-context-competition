A total of 11 811 maternal/infant dyads were enrolled. Drug exposed (EXP) infants were identi-\nfied by maternal self report of cocaine or opiate use or by meconium testing. Of 1185 EXP, meconium\nanalysis confirmed exposure in 717 to cocaine (CO) only, 100 to opiates (OP), and 92 to opiates plus\ncocaine (OP+CO); 276 had insufficient or no meconium to confirm maternal self report. Negative\nexposure history was confirmed in 7442 by meconium analysis and unconfirmed in 3184. Examiners\nmasked to exposure status, assessed each enrolled infant. Using generalised estimating equations,\nadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for manifesting a constel-\nlation of CNS/ANS outcomes and for each sign associated with cocaine and opiate exposure.\nResults: Prevalence of CNS/ANS signs was low in CO, and highest in OP+CO. Signs were significantly\nrelated to one another. After controlling for confounders, CO was associated with increased risk of mani-\nfesting a constellation of CNS/ANS outcomes, OR (95% CI): 1.7 (1.2 to 2.2), independent of OP effect,\nalso increased the risk for the constellation of CNS/ANS signs, OR (95% CI) of 1.3 (1.04 to 1.55) and\n1.4 (1.2 to 1.6), respectively, for use of less than half a pack per day and half a pack per day or more.\nConclusion: Cocaine or opiate exposure increases the risk for manifesting a constellation of\nCNS/ANS outcomes.\nCentral nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous\nsystem (ANS) manifestations are reported in neonates\nborn to mothers who used heroin or methadone during\npregnancy.1\u00ad3 Those CNS and ANS signs observed within the first\nfew days after birth comprise the manifestations reported with\nneonatal \"abstinence syndrome\" or neonatal narcotic with-\ndrawal syndrome.1\u00ad3 At delivery, transplacental drug transfer\nceases while neonatal drug metabolism and excretion continue,\nleading to drug disappearance and,consequently,manifestations\nof neonatal \"withdrawal\" or \"abstinence\".3 In the 1960s and\n1970s, high prevalence of heroin abuse and use of methadone as\na regimen to treat heroin addiction, especially in pregnant\nwomen, heightened awareness of neonatal withdrawal\nsyndrome.4\u00ad9 The syndrome was also recognised in infants of\nmothers using other drugs, such as sedatives, analgesics, stimu-\nlants, antidepressants, and antipsychotic medications.10\u00ad13 How-\never, there is variation in reported effects and prevalence of\nwithdrawal manifestations when in utero exposure involves pri-\nmarily cocaine.14 15 Madden et al observed no signs of teratogenic-\nity with cocaine exposure.16 In another series, neither with-\ndrawal signs nor illness distinguished cocaine exposed infants\nfrom controls.17 Cherukuri et al found only mild abnormal\nneurobehavioural manifestations.18 On the other hand, Chasnoff\nand colleagues19 reported that tremulousness and startle\nresponses tended to be of greater severity in infants exposed to\ncocaine compared to those exposed to methadone alone or non-\nexposed controls. Studies by Oro and Dixon20 and by Napi-\norkowski and colleagues21 revealed that cocaine exposed infants\nexhibited more stress behaviour, increased tone, motor activity,\njerky movements, tremors, and more CNS signs than non-\nexposed controls. In other reports, CNS and other neurological\nabnormalities were severe as detected clinically, radiologically, or\nby electroencephalographic and physiological studies.22\u00ad27\nAs part of a multisite study, the Maternal Lifestyle Study\n(MLS), to evaluate acute and long term effects of in utero\ncocaine and or opiate exposure on infant outcomes,28 we\nestimated the prevalence of CNS/ANS signs in neonates born to\nmothers who used cocaine/opiates during pregnancy. A priori,\nwe addressed the hypothesis that compared to non-exposed\ninfants, the prevalence of CNS/ANS signs would be increased in\ninfants exposed to cocaine or opiates in utero. We further\nhypothesised that there would be no difference in the\nprevalence of these signs between cocaine and opiate exposure.\nMETHODS\nThe study involved a multisite evaluation of effects of mater-\nnal lifestyle choices during pregnancy on their infants' acute\nand long term developmental outcomes in four centres of the\nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development\nNeonatal Research Network. These sites included Brown Uni-\nversity (Providence, RI), University of Miami (Miami, FL), The\nUniversity of Tennessee, Memphis (Memphis, TN), and Wayne\nState University (Detroit, MI). The Biostatistics Coordinating\nCenter at George Washington University, Washington, DC,\nprovided data management, research coordination, and statis-\ntical design and analysis, and later was succeeded by the\nResearch Triangle Institute (Research Triangle Park, NC).

Maternal exclusion criteria were age\n<18 years, institutionalised for mental retardation or emotional\ndisorder, or diagnosis of psychosis. After informed consent,\nmothers were interviewed for a brief history on illicit drug,\ncigarette, and alcohol use during the 12 months prior to birth. If\na mother smoked during pregnancy, she was asked whether she\nsmoked less than half a pack of cigarettes per day, or half a pack\nor more per day. If she drank alcohol, she was asked if she drank\n<1 drink/month, 1\u00ad3 drinks/month, or >1 drink/week, and\nwhether she had >5 drinks at any one time (binge).\nInfants were assessed by a research nurse masked to the\ninfant's drug exposure status. Research nurses involved in the\nstudy had training and certification on procedures, assess-\nment, and definitions of variables according to the MLS\nManual of Operations. Vital signs and growth measurements\nwere obtained, and GA by New Ballard29 examination\ndetermined with physical examination, and evaluation for\nincluded abnormalities (microphthalmia, encephalocoele,\nmeningomyelocoele, skull defect), disturbances in state, activ-\nity, or tone (hyperactivity, hyperalertness, hypertonicity, hypo-\ntonicity, jitteriness/tremors, high pitched cry, weak cry, abnor-\nmal posture, fisting, difficult to console, difficult to arouse,\nirritability, lethargy), and eye signs (notable strabismus,\nnystagmus, and sunset eye sign). ANS signs evaluated\nincluded sweating, sneezing, hiccoughing, mottling, bradycar-\ndia, tachycardia, poor suck, excessive suck, nasal stuffiness,\nhyperthermia, and hypothermia.\nMeconium was also collected and specimens were centrally\nassayed at El Sohly Laboratories, Oxford, MS. Each specimen\nreceived was analysed for presence of cocaine and opiates by\nenzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT), with\nsubsequent confirmation of positive samples using gas\nchromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS).32\nNon-exposed (NON) and exposed (EXP) groups were\ndefined a priori during the study design. NON infants were\nthose whose mother denied both cocaine and opiate use dur-\ning pregnancy, confirmed by a negative EMIT screen. Infants\nwere considered EXP either by maternal self report of cocaine\nand/or opiate use, or by meconium results that were positive\nfor cocaine or opiates by GC/MS. Infants were considered\nexposed to cocaine (CO) only, opiate (OP) only, and to both\ndrugs (OP+CO) if exposure was confirmed by GC/MS\nmeconium analysis.\nStatistical methods included estimation of prevalence of\neach of the CNS/ANS signs in NON, EXP, CO, OP, and OP+CO\ngroups. The EXP was first compared to NON, and odds ratios\n(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each of the\nCNS/ANS signs determined. Signs that were significant at\np < 0.05 by univariate analysis were selected as the CNS/ANS\noutcomes for subsequent multivariate analysis.\nIn the multivariate analysis, we chose not to fit separate\nregression models for each CNS/ANS sign or outcome, as this\nwas deemed vulnerable to problems of multiple comparisons,\ntherefore increasing the type I error to unacceptable levels.\nInstead, we adopted a multivariate modelling approach\nwherein we simultaneously modelled all CNS/ANS outcomes\nfound significant by univariate tests as a function of drug\nexposure and other covariates. We did this by testing the con-\nstellation of CNS/ANS outcomes for each infant as repeated\nbinary measures (yes/no) on the same subject and then used\ngeneralised estimating equations (GEE) to fit the model and\nestimate its parameters.33\u00ad35 This statistical approach avoided\nthe problems with multiple comparisons by fitting a single\nmodel to the data. Moreover, since it recognises that all the\nCNS/ANS outcomes for an infant may be inter-related and\ntogether constitute one syndrome, this approach is statistically\nmore efficient than fitting separate models for each outcome.\nIn addition, it allowed for outcome specific exposure effects,\nand we were able to test whether each specific outcome was\naffected by exposure to cocaine and/or opiates. In other words,\nthrough the statistical modelling, we can derive the odds ratio\n(OR) for the overall effect of exposure on manifesting the syn-\ndrome or constellation of CNS/ANS signs/outcomes as well as\nthe estimated OR for manifesting each individual sign.\nTable 1 Characteristics of mothers and infants\nCharacteristics\nUnconfirmed\n%\nNON\n%\nEXP\n%\nCO\n%\nOP\n%\n%\nSmoking\nAlcohol\nInfants' GA\nBody weight\nGroups: unconfirmed exposure, non-exposed (NON), exposed (EXP), and confirmed cocaine (CO) only, opiates (OP) only, and opiates + cocaine\n(OP+CO) exposure.\nCNS signs in drug exposure F107\nwww.archdischild.com\ngroup.bmj.com\nfn.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nUsing the above approach, we first determined the effects of\nEXP on CNS/ANS outcomes while controlling for confound-\ners. Then another analysis was done to determine specifically\nthe effects of confirmed CO and OP on outcomes using similar\ncovariates. The covariates chosen for analysis included clinical\nsite, GA, postnatal age at assessment, gender, race, maternal\nmarital status, highest grade of education completed, Medic-\naid status, prenatal care, sexually transmitted diseases includ-\ning AIDS/HIV, and use of marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco dur-\ning pregnancy. Alcohol use and tobacco use were entered into\nthe model with four and three levels, respectively, as obtained\nfrom maternal interview at enrolment. Birth weight and other\nbirth measurements were highly correlated with GA and were\nnot included in the multivariate model to avoid colinearity. In\nthe final multivariate models, covariates that were not statis-\ntically significant (p > 0.05) were excluded. Adjusted OR\n(95% CI) for the constellation of signs as well as for each CNS/\nANS manifestation with each type of exposure (EXP, CO, OP,\nand OP+CO) were estimated from the multivariate models.\nRESULTS\nA total of 19 079 mother/infant dyads were screened for study\n(70%) consented to study participation. From these, adequate\nmeconium was collected in 7442 infants, allowing confirma-\ntion of a negative history--that is, non-exposed (NON). There\nwere 3184 whose mothers had denied use, but no or\ninadequate meconium was collected. Table 1 presents charac-\nteristics of this group. Because of unconfirmed non-exposure,\nthese infants were excluded from analysis. A total of 1185\nexposed to cocaine, opiate, or both. Exposure to CO only, OP\ntively. Insufficient or no meconium was collected for\nconfirmation of drug use in the remaining 276.\nOf mothers who used opiates during pregnancy, 93% used\nheroin and/or methadone. Mothers in the EXP group were\nsignificantly older than those in the NON: mean (SD) age of\nMothers in the CO only, OP only, and OP+CO groups were also\nolder than NON, having mean (SD) ages, respectively, of 30.1\nhigher proportion of mothers in the EXP group were black, not\nmarried, with education of <12 years, with inadequate prena-\ntal care, smoked cigarettes, consumed alcohol, smoked\nmarijuana during pregnancy, and had sexually transmitted\ndiseases, compared to NON. Maternal and infant characteris-\ntics of the CO group were similar to EXP. The OP and OP+CO\ngroups did not differ from NON with regard to race or mater-\nnal education. A higher proportion of infants with lower GA\nand birth weight were seen in all EXP groups compared to\nNON. Birth length, mean (SD), in EXP was 46.5 (4.7) cm, sig-\nnificantly shorter than 48.9 (4.5) cm in NON. Mean (SD) head\ncircumference measurements in EXP, CO, OP, and CO+OP\nrespectively, significantly smaller (p < 0.05) compared to 33.4\nTwenty eight per cent of infants were examined for CNS/ANS\nassessment was 36 (17) hours.

Signs such as abnormal posture,\nsweating, hiccoughing, bradycardia, hyperthermia, and hypo-\nthermia had prevalence of <0.5% in EXP\n. Prevalence of hypoto-\nnia, weak cry, lethargy, mottling, tachycardia, and nasal flaring\nin EXP was between 1.1% and 2.7%. No gross CNS malforma-\ntion was seen in EXP\n. No infant was noted to have seizures dur-\ning masked assessment. However, on medical record review,\nthree infants (one in OP and two in OP+CO) had seizures as a\nmanifestation of drug withdrawal. Table 2 shows the signs\nfound to be statistically of higher proportion (p < 0.05) in EXP\nand are summarised by estimated OR (95% CI). Of signs\nsignificantly associated with drug exposure, the most prevalent\nwere CNS signs--that is, jitteriness/tremors and irritability\nobserved at rates of 16.6% and 14.9%, respectively. Hypertonia\nand high pitched cry were observed in 3.2% and 4% of EXP\n.\nThese CNS/ANS signs were also significantly interrelated as\nshown in table 3. Thus an infant with jitteriness/tremors was\n16.6 times more likely to manifest with hypertonia, 9.3 times\nmore likely to be irritable, 11.3 times more likely to have high\npitched cry, 5 times more likely to have nasal stuffiness, and 8.5\ntimes more likely to have excessive suck.\nIn the multivariate analysis the signs hyperactivity, hyper-\nalertness, and difficult to arouse were not included in the model\nbecause few babies had these signs. Table 4 shows the results of\nthe multivariate analysis. This table shows the adjusted OR\n(95% CI) for the outcome of manifesting the constellation or\nsyndrome of CNS/ANS outcomes and for each CNS/ANS sign\nassociated with being in the EXP group. Any drug exposure\n(that is,EXP) was significantly associated with the constellation\np < 0.0001. EXP infants were two to three times more likely to\nexhibit jitteriness/tremors, irritability, hypertonia, high pitched\ncry, or difficult to console; they were also greater than four times\nmore likely to have excessive suck, and one and one half times\nmore likely to show poor suck and nasal stuffiness. We found\nsignificant site differences, but GA, postnatal age at assessment,\nrace, gender, or sexually transmitted diseases did not signifi-\ncantly influence CNS/ANS outcomes. Neither alcohol nor mari-\njuana had effects on outcomes. However, smoking had an inde-\npendent effect on the syndrome of CNS/ANS outcomes.

In CO,\njitteriness/tremors and irritability were at rates of 14.6% and\n12.2%, respectively. All other signs occurred in less than 5% of\nbabies. The presence of at least one sign, however, occurred in\n28.2% of infants with CO only exposure. In OP, prevalence of\nmost of the CNS/ANS signs was higher than observed in CO.\nJitteriness/tremors and irritability were manifested in 22%\nand 24%, respectively, of OP infants. Any >1 sign was\nobserved in 44.8% of those with confirmed exposure to OP\nonly and in 62% of those exposed to OP+CO. Except for diffi-\ncult to arouse, the prevalence of CNS/ANS signs in OP+CO\nexposure increased above those observed in OP or CO infants.\nDifficult to arouse was a sign significant only in CO infants.\nAfter controlling for confounders, CO and OP exposed infants\nwere more likely than NON to manifest the constellation of\nCNS/ANS signs with OR (95% CI), respectively, of 1.7 (1.4 to\nTable 4 Adjusted OR and 95% CI of CNS/ANS signs\nEXP (CO or OP) Confirmed CO Confirmed OP Confirmed OP+CO\nConstellation/syndrome of\nCNS/ANS signs\nGroups: exposed (EXP), and confirmed cocaine (CO) only, opiates (OP) only, and opiates + cocaine (OP+CO) exposure.\n*Odds ratios from univariate analysis (too few cases for inclusion in multivariate models).\nNo interaction between cocaine and opiates and OR estimated from OR for cocaine multiplied by OR from opiate exposure.\nOR and 95% CI were adjusted for covariates (see text) including levels of tobacco and alcohol.\n\u00ad zero prevalence, OR cannot be calculated.\nCNS signs in drug exposure F109\nwww.archdischild.com\ngroup.bmj.com\nfn.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\ninteraction between cocaine and opiate use.

Other studies have used the Neonatal Withdrawal\nInventory,36 the Brazelton's Neonatal Behavior Assessment\nScales (NBAS),21 or the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale\n(NNNS),31 with measures derived from the NBAS, but\nmodified specifically to evaluate drug exposed infants and\nother high risk populations. Although we evaluated enrolled\ninfants for CNS/ANS signs described in Finnegan's Neonatal\nAbstinence Scoring System,30 no attempt was made to obtain\nabstinence scores. It was our main intent at the onset to\nestablish whether these signs would even be evident among\nexposed infants, especially with an evaluation performed\nmasked to infants' exposure status. Furthermore, enrolment\nof a large number of term infants and early discharge practice\nin participating centres precluded repeated assessment and\nuse of a more intensive evaluation such as the NBAS.19 20 37\nWe found a low prevalence of CNS/ANS signs but\nsignificantly higher in the EXP group, which included a large\nnumber of cocaine exposed infants. The prevalence of signs\nwas almost double in opiate only exposure but lower than\nVariation in reported incidence of CNS/ANS signs may be\nrelated to different factors, such as dose, duration of addiction,\nHowever, our study was not designed specifically to investigate\nthe relation between CNS/ANS signs and these factors.\nLower overall prevalence of CNS/ANS signs in our study\nmay also be attributed to postnatal age at assessment of\ninfants enrolled. As onset of withdrawal signs correlates\ninversely with time interval between last dose and delivery,3\nwe may have missed detection of CNS/ANS signs with onset at\nlater postnatal ages. Although we controlled for postnatal age\nat assessment in our analysis, the short nursery stay of our\ninfants was a major limitation in detecting the true prevalence\nof CNS/ANS signs following in utero drug exposure. Further-\nmore, onset of withdrawal manifestations, especially in\nmethadone exposure, may be delayed, as late as 4 weeks.9 Our\nfindings therefore are likely underestimates of the true preva-\nlence of CNS/ANS signs following CO or OP exposure. In a full\nterm cohort, Tronick and colleagues43 found no neurobehav-\nioural effects of cocaine exposure at 2\u00ad3 days of age after con-\ntrolling for confounders. It was not until 3 weeks of age that\nheavy exposure to cocaine was significantly associated with\npoorer state regulation and greater excitability. Studies by\nneurological abnormalities in cocaine exposed infants; their\ninfants were examined at later postnatal ages compared to our\ninfants. Coles and colleagues45 found little evidence of\n\"classic\" withdrawal signs in cocaine exposed babies. Richard-\nson and colleagues46 observed autonomic instability associated\nwith in utero cocaine exposure at 2 days postnatal age, regard-\nless of trimester exposure, but findings were transient and\nwere not observed at age 3 days.\nA review by Lester and colleagues47 highlighted the\nconflicting reports on neonatal effects of in utero cocaine\nexposure. In addition to variation in methods of assessment of\nCNS/ANS signs, differences in observed effects among studies\nmay be attributed to small sample size, failure to control for\nmultiple variables, and variation in subject selection second-\nary to methods of identification of exposure and confirmation\nof negative status among selected controls. Inaccuracy and\npoor recall inherent in maternal self report of drug use,48 low\nsensitivity and specificity of urine drug screening methods,49\nand unmasked evaluation of infants might result in bias in\nselection of study and comparison groups.50\nWe placed a major effort in our study design to improve on\nweaknesses evident in previous studies. Our findings were\nderived from a large sample. We also confirmed drug exposure\nusing GC/MS of meconium samples, a superior method to\nurine RIA screening.49 Furthermore, to minimise bias, infants\nenrolled were evaluated by research personnel masked to\ninfants' exposure status. In spite of a lower prevalence of CNS/\nANS signs than in other reports, we did find that cocaine\nexposure was associated with increased likelihood of mani-\nfesting a constellation of CNS/ANS signs, an effect independ-\nexposure were more likely to have jitteriness/tremors,\nirritability, hypertonia, high pitched cry, and were difficult to\nconsole, findings consistent with the reports by Chiriboga and\nThe variable fetal or neonatal effects of cocaine may be\nexplained by pharmacological factors39 51\u00ad57: individual differ-\nences in drug metabolism, high potential for cocaine in\ntraversing biological membranes but with slow tissue bio-\ntransformation, variability in plasma elimination half life, the\npotency and unpredictable vascular effects of both active and\ninactive cocaine metabolites, and variability of cocaine effects\non receptor densities or binding. Signs in cocaine exposed\nbabies may be secondary effects--that is, resulting from\nhypoxaemia, growth retardation, and/or poor nutrition,56\u00ad58 as\na result of the vasoconstrictive effect of cocaine on placental\nvessels, and thus the unpredictability of correlation between\nplasma cocaine concentration and prevalence or severity of\nwithdrawal manifestations. Of interest is the reported\ndose\u00adresponse effect of cocaine on neonatal neurobehavioural\nperformance59; amount of cocaine use was carefully deduced\nfrom maternal self report.59 A dose\u00adresponse effect of cocaine\nexposure on neurological findings was also reported in infants\n>36 weeks gestation.44 Higher likelihood of hypertonia\noccurred with higher levels of cocaine detected by RIA in\nmaternal hair.44 We were unable to address dose\u00adexposure\neffect of cocaine at this phase of the study, but a subpopulation\nis enrolled in long term developmental follow up, with\nplanned neurobehavioural evaluation at 42\u00ad45 weeks post-\nconceptional age and a detailed maternal interview of drug\nuse. This may permit exploration of relations between\nCNS/ANS manifestations and dose.\nMaternal polydrug use has been reported to result in more\nfrequent and more severe neonatal withdrawal signs than\nwithdrawal scores in infants exposed to both cocaine and\nmethadone compared to those with no added exposure to\ncocaine. In our study, the effects of exposure to the combina-\ntion of opiate and cocaine were additive. In animal studies,\nF110 Bada, Bauer, Shankaran, et al\nwww.archdischild.com\ngroup.bmj.com\nfn.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\ncocaine increases opiate receptor binding, therefore enhancing\nopiate effects.63 64 Thus, in maternal opiate plus cocaine abuse,\ndisappearance of opiates after birth may increase the\nlikelihood of development of neonatal withdrawal manifesta-\ntions than with exposure to opiate only. Furthermore, the\ncombined effects of opiate and cocaine on the upregulation of\ncAMP have been associated with increase in glutaminergic\nand noradrenergic responses.64 Increased glutaminergic activ-\nity may explain observed manifestations such as irritability,\nexcitability, or tremors after cocaine or opiate exposure.\nDempsey and colleagues65 observed that tone abnormalities\nare predicted by neonatal urine cotinine levels rather than con-\ncentrations of cocaine metabolites in meconium and urine. Pre-\nnatal exposure to cigarettes has been associated with measur-\nable neurobehavioural effects.66 Studies have also alluded to the\nresemblance between cocaine and nicotine effects.67 We found a\nsignificant association between smoking and CNS/ANS out-\ncomes independent of drug effects. As a large proportion of\nwomen who use cocaine also smoke during pregnancy, future\nstudies will need to evaluate neonatal and long term effects in\nthe context of exposure to both substances.\nIn summary, the large number of exposed infants in our study\nhas enabled us to discriminate effects related to cocaine from\nthose of opiates, while taking into consideration multiple\nconfounding variables. In utero cocaine exposure is significantly\nassociated with manifesting a constellation of CNS/ANS out-\ncomes. CNS signs are the more prevalent manifestations, but\nthese are significantly interrelated to one another and to ANS\nsigns. These manifestations are similar to signs of opiate\nwithdrawal. However, it remains unclear whether these signs\nassociated with cocaine exposure are withdrawal signs or rather\nmanifestations of toxic effects of cocaine on the developing fetal\nbrain. Perhaps, exploring any relation between these manifesta-\ntions and early gestational cocaine exposure as detected by neo-\nnatal hair analysis68 may help assess whether these signs relate to\nwithdrawal or drug effects. Furthermore, long term follow up of\nthese children will be needed to determine the prognostic signifi-\ncance of these early CNS signs. The association between cocaine\nexposure and CNS/ANS outcomes, the additive effects associated\nwith exposure to both cocaine and opiate, the reported subacute\nmanifestations in narcotic withdrawal, and possibility of late\nonset manifestations in either cocaine and opiates exposure must\nprompt primary care providers for early and frequent post-\ndischarge health monitoring of these high risk infants.\n"
