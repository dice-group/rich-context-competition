Concomitantly\nwith his landmark neuroanatomical research, Cajal had served as director of the Alfonso XIII National Institute of Hygiene.\nIn that capacity, his name had to be included in certificates as a mere bureaucratic formality. Cajal had an early interest in\nbacteriology, and introduced a pioneering chemical vaccine against cholera during the 1885 epidemic in Spain. However, in\na letter to the Madrid press, he vehemently denied any involvement with actual chemical analyses or commercial promotion\nof products such as bottled water, medicinal wines, disinfectants, and even toothpaste. In this episode, we realize that Cajal's\nview was absolutely contrary to the impression one might have gathered on the basis of the commercial documents alone.\n",

As a child, he painted and experimented\nwith explosives (Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, 1988; Triarhou & del Cerro,\n2008a). As an academic physician, besides studying nervous\ntissue, he pioneered the invention of a cholera vaccine\nanalgesia (Stefanidou, Sol\u00e0, Kouvelas, del Cerro, & Triarhou,\n2007), analyzed cross-sections of photographic film under\nthe microscope (Triarhou & del Cerro, 2008b), and conjec-\ntured on the psychology of poets (Triarhou & Vivas, 2009).\nThe present article examines certain claims made by the\nbottled water industry in commercial documents, implying\nCajal's involvement in the capacity of an analytical chemist.\nAmong other things, Cajal is mentioned as director by the\nCabreiro\u00e1 mineral water company of Ver\u00edn, Galicia, and as\nhaving performed chemical analyses for the Caraba\u00f1a min-\neral water company of Madrid.\nCajal had entered the Spanish medical corps after obtain-\ning the doctor's degree in 1873. Having a strong national\ncharacter and being in excellent physical shape, he served as\na lieutenant physician in the Third Carlist War, and subse-\nquently as a captain in the Cuban War. His stay in Cuba was\nmarked by hardship and disease. The decline of Spain's colo-\nnial policy, a war fought in a hostile climate, and corruption\namong military officers led Cajal to be stationed in a theater\nof operations with a rigid logistical system of \"trails,\" which\nwould end up in military failure and a loss of the colony.\nDisappointed and seriously ill from malaria, Cajal returned\nto Spain on a sick leave. Shortly thereafter, thanks to Dr.\nGenaro Casas, he became a university lecturer, ending his\nmilitary career (Moreno-Mart\u00ednez & Mart\u00edn-Araguz, 2002).\nDuring his military service in Cuba, Cajal nearly died of\ndysentery. Later, during his Valencia years and his tenure as\nanatomy chairman there, he witnessed the 1885 cholera out-\nbreak.

In 1907, Cajal's post as \"director\"\nwas printed on labels (Baeza Rodr\u00edguez-Caro et al., 2003;\nMurillo, 1913). Cabreiro\u00e1 mineral water was imported in\nArgentina by the Echegaray brothers (Figure 1).\nThe Cabreiro\u00e1 company has engaged in the bottling and\nmarketing of its mineral water for over a century.

A bronze statue, sculpted by\nthe Galician artist Manuel Garc\u00eda V\u00e1zquez de Buci\u00f1os, was\nerected to honor the Nobel Laureate (Editorial, 2006; Gabinete\nde Comunicaci\u00f3n da Xunta de Galicia, 2006).

After all,\nsuch claims were likely rooted in medical paradigms of his\nage. The 1800s had seen a widespread enthusiasm for water\ncures, Darwin being one of thousands of famous patients at\nwater spas. In that aspect of conventional medicine, Cajal\nmight not be doing much different than his contemporaries\nor anything particularly rigorous by the standards of his work\nin neuroanatomy.\nFurthermore, it is understandable that Cajal, an amateur\nastronomer and nature lover, felt for the unspoilt corners of\nhis land, such as the tiny town of Ver\u00edn, one of the many\nalong slow roads from Santiago de Compostela to Salamanca.\nThese are places where the traveler can soak his spirit in the\nessence of Spain. The night sky is velvet blue, the stars shine\nas they do not shine in our light-polluted cities. And the\nsilence! It is a silence that \"heals the mind.\"\nOn the other hand, there is a questionable quality as to\nhow water bottlers were using Cajal's reputation to promote\nproducts. Sometimes, a \"Great Man\" style in industrial\nadvertising can be insufficiently critical, lacking the hard\nevidence from properly controlled studies for the products\nbeing truly efficacious.\nThe reply comes from a unique, and surprising letter,\nfrom Ram\u00f3n y Cajal himself, hosted in the Diario Ilustrado\ntitle: \"How My Modest Name Is Exploited by Certain\nUnscrupulous Industries\" (Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, 1926). Cajal reit-\nerates that he never practiced any industrial analysis, neither\nas an individual nor as director of the Alfonso XIII Institute,\nand clarifies that, if his name appears in some documents, it\nis only owing to a bureaucratic formality requiring to include\nthe formal approval (B. V. or \"bueno visto\") of the director\nof the Institute.\nThe complete text of the letter reads as follows (authors'\nEnglish translation):\nThe most cultivated writer G\u00f3mez de Baquero said that the least\nSpanish virtue is respect. My case eloquently corroborates that\nsensible observation. I allude to a misuse initiated since I was\nnominated, at the suggestion of the illustrious doctor Cortezo,\ndirector of the Alfonso XIII National Institute of Hygiene. This\nmisuse, committed by quite a lot of industries, consists in\ngratuitously attributing to me the execution of the analysis of\nspecifics, of medicinal wines, of mineral waters, disinfectants,\ncigarette paper, toothpaste and other products, of which I have\nno idea. Such a myth has spread so, that it has even invaded the\nforeign press (including a current claim in a Swedish newspaper),\nand has generated within Spain, in magazines of great prestige,\ncommentaries hardly pleasant to me. And yet the tide keeps\nrising. Today I was informed that the Radio Company has\ncredited me with the analysis of the waters of Venta del Hoyo\n(waters of which I have not the slightest idea), and that a witted\n8 SAGE Open\nmerchant, in whose house I purchased a spray gun for\ndisinfectants (I paid, naturally), advises his clients to consult me\non its efficacy. Finally, as I write these lines, I am informed that\nin the central theater there appears a sign, which gratuitously\nattributes to me the analysis of the waters of Hoznayo.\nIt is urgent, then, to straighten things, by stating that:\nFirst. I have never conducted any industrial analysis, neither as\nan individual nor as director of the Alfonso XIII Institute, a\nposition that I resigned 6 years ago.\nSecond. That the experts' certificates handed over to individuals\nby the said Institute were authorized by the signature of the\nsection chief, the true author of the analysis, with the approval of\nthe director, stamped at the bottom, as required by regulations.\nThird. That the tariff of prices, extremely reasonable, were\napproved by the Directorate of Health, in accordance with a\nruling, under which half the amount of the honorarium is\ndestined to bolster the infrastructure and the rest to subsidize the\npersonnel, which, during the initial years of the organization of\nthe Institute, was receiving inadequate stipends.\nIf the industrial references had pointed on their labels or in their\nmagazine advertisements the official establishment where the\nexpert work was carried out, the name of the authoring professor\ndirectly responsible, plus the approval of the director (a\nbureaucratic imperative, which only expresses the mere\nsentiment of confidence in the competence and integrity of the\nanalyst), I would be content with all the claims; but the fact is\nthat almost all claims published by the advertisers systematically\nand maliciously omit the name of the Institute, eliminating that\nof the illustrious chemistry professor charged with the service,\nand it is only stated analyzed, or consulted, by Dr. Cajal, etc.,\neven though the report entails bland judgments or formulates\nrestrictions, reservations, and even failures outright unfavorable.\nSome will think that all this is suspicions or cogitations of mine.\nNo. Insofar as, even in the minute, the whole truth should always\nshine, for the deplorable tolerances I have suffered, as stated\nearlier, molestation attacks by doctors and journalists. Even in\nLa Libertad, a master of journalists, whom I wholeheartedly\nrevere and admire, expressed 4 or 5 months ago, without naming,\nand in a pious tone, caustic ironies.\nLet the aforementioned industries, then, rectify their conduct\ntoward me. Erase my name from their claims and labels and\nreproduce that of author of the analysis. I appeal to their rectitude\nand nobility. Announce that, attributing to me a work for which I\nam not competent brings me into a ridiculous, unjust, and\nunlawful position. Ridiculous, because everyone knows how\nTriarhou and del Cerro 9\noblivious I am in analytical chemistry; unjust, because I would\nappear to supplant or silence the personality of the illustrious\nprofessors, among others, that of Mr. Obtulio Fern\u00e1ndez,\nProfessor and Chairman of Pharmacy, an academic and one of\nthe few eminent chemists honoring Spain; unlawful, because, not\npaying the medical patent signals that I defraud the Treasury. I\ntrust, therefore, that the preceding reasons will make an\nimpression on the industries, which, for 14 or 16 years, exploit,\nin exchange for a few pesetas given to the Alfonso XIII Institute,\nmy humble name. I simply aspire to completely forget me. But if,\nas I suspect, they persist in their attitude, I shall be compelled to\nconsult an attorney and to take the matter to the Courts. These\nwill say whether, in citing a public document, it is permissible to\ndispense with the signature of the one who authored it, and\nwhether a mere ritualistic approval is equivalent to the paternity\nof the one who performed in person, and with full competence\nand responsibility, the meritorious expert work.--S. Ram\u00f3n Cajal\nDiscussion\nThis episode is an example of how the exhaustive documen-\ntation on a historical topic can prevent us from conceivably\npassing a message that would not correspond to reality, and\nfrom spreading a false legend. By reading Cajal's letter, we\nsee that his view was absolutely contrary to the impression\nthat one might have gathered on the basis of the commercial\ndocuments alone.\nThe story reminds of the Dutch botanist-physician\nwho was often disgruntled by fake publications with incor-\nrect statements and had also sent a letter to the local newspa-\nper warning about claims (mis)using his name (Koehler,\n2007). His note appeared in De Leydsche Courant on October\nwords, it went as follows:\nWhereas some booksellers of this and other countries, for the\nsake of lucre only, have highly injured me, and scandalously\ncheated the public, by printing in my name several books from\nlectures procured (as they pretended) from my auditors, who\nwere it so, make a very ill requital for my best endeavours to\nserve them; I find myself obliged to declare that I owe none such\nfor my works, being fraudulently published without my\nknowledge, contrary to my will.
