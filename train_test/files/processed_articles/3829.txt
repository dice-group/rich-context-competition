As an inter-\nmediate tumor with a tendency for local\ninvasion, GCTB treated with curettage has a\nand thus poses a great challenge for clinical\nPrognostic factors for local recurrence\nplay a key role in the preoperative planning\nof surgical procedures. We reviewed the\nliterature regarding prognostic factors for\nlocal recurrence of GCTB but obtained far\ntoo few reliable results. Authors seldom\ndraw unanimous conclusions, and the prog-\nnostic factors for GCTB remain ambiguous\nand controversial. Previously reported\nprognostic factors include age,5,7 location,2\nCampanacci classification,8,9 soft tissue\nHowever, all of these disease-related factors\nwere excluded in other equivalent stu-\ndies.12\u00ad15 Additionally, most of these studies\nwere retrospective with limited sample sizes.\nThe presence of a residual tumor after\nsurgery has been considered responsible for\nrecurrence6; therefore, the imaging features\nof the tumor border, which are potentially\nassociated with the liability of the residual\ntumor, are worthy of clinical investigation.\nMedical imaging is a noninvasive method\nthat can provide diverse information regard-\ning GCTB,16 including its characteristics\nand impact on surrounding regions. A\nradiographic classification of bone tumor\nmargins has been developed.17,18 However,\nanatomic overlap can obscure abnormal-\nities, and the classification has a limited\ncapacity to evaluate soft tissue. Radiographs\nare limited to determination of the relation-\nship between bone tumors and their\nsurrounding structures and the extent of\ndisease in the intact marrow cavity.18\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is\nespecially valuable for evaluation of muscu-\nloskeletal tumors because of its heightened\nsensitivity to soft tissue disease and multi-\nIn the present study, we investigated the\npreoperative imaging features of the GCTB\nborder, including peritumoral edema, the\n``paintbrush borders'' sign, bony ridges, and\nloss of the bone cortex. In accordance with\nestablishment of a new and standardized\nevaluation system to investigate the prog-\nnostic factors of GCTB. The knee is the site\nof predilection for GCTB12 and is a major\nweight-loading joint. Therefore, we investi-\ngated prognostic factors through prospect-\nive enrollment of patients with GCTB\naround the knee joint. The patients were\nfollowed up for at least 2 years.\nFurthermore, preoperative imaging features\nwere investigated through their correlation\nwith gross pathologic sections of surgical\nspecimens.\nMaterials and methods\nPatients\nThis study was approved by the institutional\nreview board of our hospital, the methods\nwere carried out in accordance with the\nrelevant guidelines and regulations, and\nwritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom all patients for the use of their clinical\nand imaging data in this study. The study\ndesign is presented in Figure 1. The eligibil-\nity requirements were histopathologically\nconfirmed GCTB; tumor location in the\nproximal tibia and distal femur; perform-\nance of intralesional curettage with\npolymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) packing,\nwhich is the preferred standard treatment\nfor GCTB and is performed consistently by\na subgroup of orthopedic specialists in our\nhospital; performance of MRI and com-\nputed tomography (CT) examination before\nsurgery; and a follow-up duration of >2\nyears. Patients with GCTB were prospect-\nively registered in this study from January\nwith pathological fractures and soft tissue\nmasses were excluded. Patients with GCTBs\ntreated with en bloc resection were enrolled\nonly for investigation of the pathologic basis\nof specific imaging features.\nImaging procedures\nCT examinations were performed with a\n64-slice CT scanner (LightSpeed VCT;\nGeneral Electric Medical Systems,\nMilwaukee, WI, USA) according to a rou-\ntine protocol. The bone window, soft tissue\nwindow, and two-dimensional acquisition\nwere used for observation.\nMRI examinations were performed on a\n1.5-T superconducting whole-body imager\n(SIGNA; General Electric Medical Systems)\nwith dedicated knee coils.\nA combination of axial, sagittal, and\ncoronal images was obtained using the fol-\nlowing sequences: spin-echo T1-weighted\n(repetition time [TR] range/echo time [TE]\nspin-echo T2-weighted (TR range/TE range,\nFigure 1.

The imaging matrix ranged\nAll patients routinely underwent\nanteroposterior and lateral plain radio-\ngraphs for reexamination.\nObjective features and groups\nPreoperative imaging features, including\nperitumoral edema, the ``paintbrush bor-\nders'' sign, formation of bony ridges, and\nloss of the bone cortex, were observed in the\naxial, sagittal, and coronal planes.\nBony ridges were defined as focally\nthickened bone trabeculae or ridge forma-\ntion on the bone rim, visible on CT scans.\nThe bone window was effective for observa-\ntion of bony ridges. Patients were classified\ninto the positive group if bony ridges were\nfound, regardless of the number of bony\nridges.\nGCTB margins are often relatively well-\ndefined or show irregular penetration. The\n``paintbrush borders'' sign was descriptively\ndefined as the presence of penetrating irregu-\nlar margins with a ``paintbrush'' appearance\nprotruding toward the bone, visible on\nMRI. Because of the stark contrast between\nthe high signal intensity of the bone marrow\nand the low signal intensity of tumor tissue,\nT1-weighted images more effectively showed\nirregular protrusions than did other\nsequences. Patients were classified into the\npositive group if the ``paintbrush borders''\nsign was found, irrespective of the number\nor shape of the sign.\nPeritumoral edema appeared as high\nsignal intensity on fat-suppressed MRI and\nindicated the presence of joint effusion and\nedema. GCTBs were classified into two\ngrades: grade A was defined as massive\nedema or significantly high signal intensity\non fat-suppressed T2-weighted images, and\ngrade B was defined as limited edema or\nminimally increased signal intensity on fat-\nsuppressed T2-weighted images.\nCortical bone destruction can be detected\nby CT or MRI. In this study, loss of the\nbone cortex was defined as discontinuity\n(shown as low signal intensity) of the nor-\nmally high-density bone cortex on the MRI\nbone window.\nAll these features were evaluated using\nnoncontrast MRI/CT and interpreted by\nthree senior musculoskeletal radiologists\nyears of experience; and X.D., 25 years of\nexperience). The radiologists discussed the\nfindings until consensus was reached. If\nconsensus could not be reached, the major-\nity opinion was used for analysis. GCTBs\nwere classified into positive and negative\ngroups according to the preoperative ima-\nging features.\nIntralesional procedure\nThe intralesional procedure performed in\neach patient was explicitly recorded in the\nmedical records. All 55 patients underwent\nintralesional curettage conducted by a\nsenior orthopedic surgeon (J.X., 19 years\nof experience). A wide cortical window was\ncreated, and the tumor tissue was removed\nwith a curette. The remainder of the tumor\ncavity was then eliminated with a high-speed\nburr. Phenol was applied in the borders of\nthe cavity with a cotton-tipped applicator\nand then neutralized with alcohol in 31\npatients; the remaining 24 patients were\ntreated without an additional adjuvant.\nFinally, the tumor cavity was carefully\npacked with PMMA filling.\nFollow-up and recurrence\nAll patients underwent annual reexamina-\ntion by X-ray or MRI regardless of whether\nthey were symptomatic. Patients who were\nunable to be re-examined in our hospital\nwere followed up by telephone, letter\nexchange, or in-person visits. All patients\nwere followed up for at least 2 years.\nExtension of the radiolucent zone on\nradiographs after bone cement filling was a\nreliable indicator of possible local\nrecurrence. The recurrent tumor, which\nwas represented by high signal intensity\naround the PMMA on T2-weighted ima-\nging, could be directly identified. The\npatients were immediately re-examined if\nany tumor-associated symptoms (abnormal\npain and swelling) occurred after surgery.\nRecurrent GCTBs were diagnosed by patho-\nlogical results. Follow-up could be halted if\nthe GCTB recurred.\nCorrelation with pathology\nSurgical specimens were obtained from two\npatients treated by en bloc resection.\nAccording to the acquired images, forma-\nlin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens were\nsectioned and stained with hematoxylin and\neosin.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using\nSPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0\n(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).\nCategorical variables are presented as\npercent and absolute number of patients.\nThe distributions of the frequencies of\ndichotomous attributes in each group were\nassessed using the chi-square test or Fisher's\nexact test, as appropriate. Independent fac-\ntors were identified by multivariate logistic\nregression analysis. All P values were two-\nsided, and a value of <0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nSixty-seven consecutive patients prospect-\nively registered in this study. Among them,\nfive patients with pathological fractures and\nfour patients with soft tissue masses were\nexcluded. Therefore, 58 patients were eli-\ngible for this study (30 men and 28 women;\nyears). The patients were grouped according\nto their preoperative imaging features\n(Figures 2\u00ad4), including peritumoral\nedema, the ``paintbrush borders'' sign,\nbony ridges, and loss of bone cortex.

This sign, which is characterized by\nmarginal infiltration on MRI, pathologic-\nally confirmed to represent invasion of bone\naround the tumor.\nIntralesional procedures are a preferred\napproach to GCTB but are challenged by\nlocal recurrence. Residual tumor tissue is\nassociated with local recurrence after sur-\ngery and is a vital concern when performing\nintralesional procedures.5,6 This inspired us\nFigure 3.

However,\ndespite the fact that the Lodwick grading\nsystem and modified Lodwick\u00adMadewell\ngrading system are well established, our\nliterature review revealed no studies evaluat-\ning the preoperative MRI features of the bor-\nder of GCTBs.25 The present study is the first\nto evaluate the association between the pre-\noperative MRI features of the border of\nGCTBs and the prognosis of these tumors.\nThe ``paintbrush borders'' sign is a\ncommon feature that can be found on\nconventional MRI but has been neglected\nin previous studies. This sign should be\ncorrelated with pathological findings to\ndetermine its clinical value. Therefore, we\nexplored the pathologic basis of the ``paint-\nbrush borders'' sign on MRI and found\nosteoclastic giant cells uniformly distributed\namong monocytes within the protrusions.\nGross pathologic sections showed that the\n``paintbrush borders'' sign represented inva-\nsion of bone around the lesion. The gross\npathologic sections visually matched the\nspecific findings on the images.\nInvasion of bone around a GCTB could\nbe interpreted as one cause of residual\ntumors. The penetrating irregular margins\nmight decrease the effect of intralesional\ntreatment. We have herein provided reliable\nevidence to substantiate the viewpoint that\nresidual tumors may be a major culprit in\nlocal recurrence and identified the ``paint-\nbrush borders'' sign as an independent\nprognostic factor for local recurrence of\nGCTBs. When penetrating irregular mar-\ngins are detected by MRI in the clinical\nsetting, surgeons should consider the pres-\nence of a GCTB and make every effort to\nthoroughly eliminate residual tumor tissue\nin the region of the irregular protrusions.\nThis prospective study of GCTBs has pro-\nvided evidence that inclusion of this novel\nsign on preoperative MRI might help to\nguide surgical treatment and reduce local\nrecurrence.\nWith respect to the molecular prognostic\nfactors of GCTB, the expression of some\nosteolysis-associated factors might be ele-\nvated in GCTB with the ``paintbrush bor-\nders'' sign. It can be reasonably speculated\nthat osteoclast activity and its related fac-\ntors, such as the receptor activator of\nnuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)/\nRANK/osteoprotegerin signaling pathway,\nmatrix metalloproteinases, and tumor\nnecrosis factor-a, might be pivots between\nosteolysis/formation of the ``paintbrush bor-\nders'' sign and local recurrence. In one study\nof bone malignancies, nuclear factor I-B,\nRANK, and RANKL co-overexpression\nwas identified as a potential discriminating\nfactor of a poor prognosis.26 Kumta et al.27\ndemonstrated that matrix metalloproteinase\n9 expression in GCTBs was well correlated\nwith local recurrence. Further research is\nrequired to clarify these findings.\nTable 1.

This could be explained as fol-\nlows. 1) Although bony ridges cause\ndifficulty performing curettage, they can be\nworn smooth with a high-speed burr, sub-\nstantially reducing their clinical impact. 2)\nTheoretically, peritumoral edema is a reac-\ntion to the tumor activity and is associated\nwith the aggressiveness of GCTB. Based on\nour negative result, however, we speculate\nthat many confounding factors, such as\nosteosclerosis, also play roles in the devel-\nopment of edema. 3) Loss of the bone cortex\nis a result of the aggressiveness of GCTB.\nAdditionally, Chen et al.10 demonstrated the\nrole of soft tissue masses in prognosis of\nGCTB. However, we did not arrive at the\nsame conclusion in terms of loss of the bone\ncortex. In the early stage before the forma-\ntion of a soft tissue mass, adjacent bone\ninvasion is more amenable to clinical treat-\nment. Surgeons should always select a bone\nwindow containing loss of the bone cortex\nor a thinner bone cortex to perform surgery.\nThe impact of demographic factors on\nlocal recurrence is also an important factor\nassociated with clinical management.\nSiddiqui et al.2 reported that local recur-\nrence of GCTB in the proximal tibia (recur-\nrence rate of 60%) is higher than that in\nFigure 4. A 23-year-old woman with a giant cell tumor of bone treated with en bloc resection. (a, b) The\nsurgical specimen was dissected to examine its correlation with the coronal image, and pathological samples\nwere taken from this coronal section.

This could explain why our\nextremely high. However, the higher rates\nof local relapse in the proximal tibia were\nmostly derived from statistical analyses\nwithout convincing investigations to explain\nthese findings. Kivioja et al.7 reported age as\na prognostic factor for local recurrence of\nGCTB and found a correlation between\nhigher age and lower local recurrence rates.\nThese findings coincide with those obtained\nby Klenke et al.,5 who reported that age was\nan independent risk factor for recurrence\nregardless of the disease status and chosen\ntreatment. In the current study, however, we\ndid not reach the same conclusions regard-\ning the role of these demographic factors.\nWe consider the present investigation to\nbe a standardized study in terms of the\nfollowing two aspects. First, we enrolled\npatients with GCTBs around the knee to\nexclude the impact of the tumor site.\nSecond, the surgical procedures were con-\nsistent among all patients.\nHowever, the application of phenol and\nthe long duration of this prospective study\nprobably interfered with the investigation\nand might be considered confounding fac-\ntors. To control for confounding factors, the\nimpact of the application of phenol on the\nprognosis was excluded by the correlation\nanalysis. Klenke et al.5 reported that local\nphenol use did not improve recurrence-free\nsurvival. On the other hand, the local\nrecurrence rates in the former and latter\nively, with no significant difference.\nGCTB is generally known to recur within\nwas set at >2 years.

For the\npatients without recurrence, the follow-up\nThis is the first study to evaluate the role\nof the MRI features of the tumor border in\npredicting local recurrence of GCTB.\nHowever, the study has some limitations.\nThe main limitation is that although this\nsingle-center study was standardized by\nenrolling only patients with GCTB around\nthe knee, the number of patients with GCTB\nwas relatively small. To the best of our\nknowledge, however, the GCTBs mainly\nrecurred within 2 years. We cannot exclude\nthe possibility of long-term recurrence with-\nout extending the study duration.\nIn conclusion, the MRI feature of the\n``paintbrush borders'' sign was discovered as\nan independent prognostic factor for local\nrecurrenceofGCTB.Pathologically,penetrat-\ning irregular margins on preoperative MRI\nwere correlated with bone invasion around the\nGCTB. Careful evaluation of the GCTB\nborder by MRI might help to raise surgeons'\nawareness about the risk of penetrating irregu-\nlar margins and guide surgical treatment to\nensure thorough elimination of residual\ntumors in the region of the protrusions.\nAuthors' contributions\nGuarantor of the integrity of the entire study:\nXiaoyi Ding\nStudy conception: Xiaoyi Ding, Yifeng He\nStudy design: Xiaoyi Ding, Yifeng He\nLiterature search: Yifeng He, Lianjun Du\nClinical studies: Yifeng He, Jianqiang Xu, Ji\nZhang\nExperimental studies: Fei Yuan, Jun Wang, Ji\nZhang\nData acquisition: Yong Lu, Jun Wang, Yifeng\nHe, Ji Zhang\nImaging analysis/interpretation: Xiaoyi Ding,\nLianjun Du, Yifeng He\nStatistical analysis: Yifeng He, Ji Zhang, Jun\nWang\nManuscript preparation: Yifeng He, Ji Zhang\nManuscript editing: Yifeng He, Ji Zhang\nManuscript revision/review: Xiaoyi Ding,\nLianjun Du, Yong Lu\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nFunding was received from the Science and\nTechnology Commission of Shanghai\nReferences\n1. van der Heijden L, Dijkstra PD, van de Sande\nMA, et al.
