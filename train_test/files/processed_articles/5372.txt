We sought to improve the\neffectiveness of an aspirin label as a refutation text by manipulating selective attention and label-processing strategy.\nAfter reading a facsimile label, those of 196 undergraduates who attempted to explain why shaded drug facts are \"easily\nconfused\" recalled more refuting drug facts than participants who attempted to explain why those facts are \"easily\nignored.\" However, \"easily confused\" processing did not change truth ratings of misconceptions associated with those\ndrug facts. We conclude that refuted misconceptions remain in memory but are inhibited by disconfirming drug facts.\n",

OTC drugs that pose health threats\nif not taken as directed by the drug label include analgesic,\nlaxative, antihistamine, cough suppressant, and heartburn\nmedications. Given the potential risks of self-medication\nwith nonprescription drugs, OTC drug labels are obligated\nto provide a consumer with the information needed to use\nthat drug safely and effectively (Soller, 1998; Sutherland,\n2010). Toward that end, the Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA, 1999) has standardized the organization, format, and\nreading level of label information as the now-familiar Drug\nFacts Label (DFL). In addition, the FDA mandates compre-\nhension studies for all nonprescription drug labels (FDA,\nignore or misunderstand label information that would ena-\nble them to use a drug safely and effectively (Bennin and\nreading failures may arise from deficiencies in the quality\nin the quality of a consumer's comprehension skills (Davis\net\nPrior knowledge effects may also underlie some of the\nproblems that consumers have in making sense of simple\nlabel directives.

However, this misunderstanding might also\nreflect the heightened concern of a mother of three young\nchildren about the potential risk of a choking hazard.\nMindful of that concern, she might well infer that she could\nreduce the risk of choking by thoroughly crushing and\nchewing the tablet. In re-interpreting the label directive, she\nhas reconciled the discrepancy between her prior knowl-\nedge and the authoritative text of the label in favor of her\nprior knowledge. Under other circumstances, she might\nhave reconciled the discrepancy in favor of the authorita-\ntive label directive. This example suggests that substantial\nimprovements in the comprehension of OTC drug labels\nmay require the modification of na\u00efve preconceptions con-\nsumers have about the safe and effective use of nonpre-\nscription drugs.\nThere is a small body of research that documents knowl-\nedge-based reading failures (Bostrom et al., 1994; Catlin\nclearest demonstration is that by Ryan (2011) and Ryan and\nCostello-White (2015). Their methodology involves a pre-\ntest\u00adposttest assessment of truth ratings assigned to a set of\n30 claims about the facts to be found on a facsimile aspirin\nlabel. Of these 30 claims, 15 could be readily confirmed by\nreading the aspirin label; the remaining 15 could be readily\nrefuted by reading the label. A careful reading of the fac-\nsimile label produced a substantial increase in the judged\ntruth of label-supported claims (LSCs) on the posttest. That\nreading also produced a significant decrease in the judged\ntruth of label-refuted claims (LRCs) on the posttest. In both\nstudies, however, the increase in truth values for LSCs was\nmuch greater than the decrease in truth values for LRCs.\nThese results demonstrate that individuals are better at\nusing label information to confirm valid claims about aspi-\nrin drug facts than in using label information to correct\ninvalid claims about aspirin drug facts. The disturbing\nimplication is that reading an OTC label very carefully may\nbe effective in confirming valid na\u00efve beliefs about a drug\nbut relatively ineffective in correcting invalid na\u00efve beliefs.\nCorrecting misconceptions that impair text comprehen-\nsion can be challenging enough to require specialized texts\nthat are capable of producing conceptual change (see Duit\nreviews in different scientific domains). Science educators\nhave long recognized that students often have na\u00efve scien-\ntific misconceptions that are not easily corrected (see\ncollege graduates may hold strongly to the mistaken belief\nthat it is warmer in the summer than in the winter because the\nsun is closer to the earth (Bailey and Slater, 2004). Science\ntexts that are designed specifically to dispel common scien-\ntific misconceptions are generally referred to as refutational\nnotes that refutation texts are most effective in correcting a\nmisconception when they (a) clearly articulate the miscon-\nception, (b) label it unambiguously as incorrect, and (c) cor-\nrect the misconception with an explanation of the relevant\nscientific principle. More recently, investigations of the co-\nactivation hypothesis (Kendeou etal., 2014; Danielson et al.,\nKendeou, 2008) have sought to identify the specific cogni-\ntive processes necessary to produce texts that promote the\nconceptual change necessary to modify na\u00efve misconcep-\ntions. The co-activation hypothesis assumes that a necessary\ncondition for conceptual change is that a given misconcep-\ntion and the corrective information offered by a text be\nsimultaneously active in working memory. In addition, how-\never, the text must prompt a reader to revise or replace the\ninvalid memory-based conception with the valid text-based\nconception. The question we investigate in this study is\nwhether it is possible to design a refutational DFL that is\neffective in correcting drug misconceptions and in improv-\ning the recall of the corrective information on the label.\nDesign constraints in creating refutational OTC\ndrug labels\nUnfortunately, the content and format of a nonprescription\ndrug facts label is so highly constrained (FDA, 1999) that it\nis difficult to devise a refutational DFL using either the sci-\nence education formula (Tippett, 2010) or the co-activation\nformula (Kendeou etal., 2014). However, there are two\nDFL features than can be manipulated: the use of a con-\nspicuous general injunction to the consumer and the shad-\ning of critical label phrases. For example, the general\ninjunction \"See new warnings information\" now appears\non the Principal Display Panel (PDP: the front label that\nincludes brand name and product logos) for many nonpre-\nscription drug labels. This injunction amounts only to a\ngeneral recommendation to read the label carefully to dis-\ncover any new warning information. The PDPcould include\nmuch more specific and useful label-processing directives.\nA second re-design opportunity lies in making better use of\nthe selective shading of keywords or phrases on an OTC\npercent of the pre-\nscription drug labels examined in their study made use of\ngray highlighting to emphasize information that was not\n\"patient-critical.\" A feasible and more patient-critical use\nof shading would be to highlight on a nonprescription drug\nlabel those keywords or phrases associated with each\nPrimary Communication Objective established by the FDA\nfor that drug. Because there are only about a dozen Primary\nCommunication Objectives for any nonprescription drug\n(see Raymond et\nwould not likely compromise the label-reading process.\nRyan et al. 3\nControlling attentional focus.We used label shading to focus\nparticipants'attention on keywords associated with label drug\nfacts that confirmed valid claims about the safe and effective\nuse of aspirin--claim-supporting drug facts (CSDFs). We\nalso used label shading to focus participants'attention on key-\nwords associated with drug facts that refuted invalid claims\nabout the safe and effective use aspirin--claim-refuting drug\nfacts (CRDFs). Figure 1 shows the seven shadings of key-\nwords for claim-supporting drug facts on a facsimile Drug\nFacts Panel. Figure 2 shows the seven shadings of keywords\nfor claim-refuting drug facts on the same Drug Facts Panel.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to read either a facsimile\nlabel (a PDP and two Drug Facts Panels) with the 15 CSDFs\nshaded or a facsimile label with the 15 CRDFs shaded. It\nshould be noted that shading only CSDFs (as in Figure 1) will\ndirect participants' attention to those drug facts and reduce\ntheir attention to CRDFs. Similarly, shading only CRDFs (as\nin Figure 2) will direct participants' attention to those drug\nfacts and reduce their attention to CSDFs. As a consequence,\nless attention will be paid to unshaded drug facts than if no\nshading were used, and more attention will be paid to shaded\ndrug facts than if no shading was used.\nPromoting label/belief discrepancy detection and label reconcili-\nation. We expected that keyword shading would focus our\nparticipants' attention on the associated drug facts in the\nlabel text and serve to activate whatever preconceptions\nthey had about those drug facts. Our analysis of pre-label\nratings suggests that in the aggregate, the shading of claim-\nsupporting drug facts (see Figure 1) are likely to activate\nlabel-supported preconceptions, and the shading of claim-\nrefuting drug facts are likely to activate label-refuted pre-\nconceptions (see Figure 2). According to the co-activation\nhypothesis (McCrudden and Kendeou, 2014; Van Den\nBroek and Kendeou, 2008), it would be necessary for a\nmisconception and its corrective drug fact to be active in\nworking memory simultaneously in order for differences\nbetween the two to be detected and reconciled. We sought\nto devise a processing strategy that would likely facilitate\nthe detection and reconciliation of discrepancies between\nactivated preconceptions and shaded drug facts. We also\nsought to devise a control processing strategy that would be\nless likely to facilitate the detection and reconciliation of\ndiscrepancies. We identified two semantic processing strat-\negies that seemed likely to vary in their effectiveness in\ncorrecting misconceptions.\n\"Easily-confused\" label processing.If we ask participants to\nexplain a why consumer might misunderstand or be con-\nfused by a particular shaded drug fact, we encourage them\nto engage in both elaborative and distinctiveness process-\ning. Elaborative processing occurs as participants seek to\ngenerate different plausible interpretations of a drug,\nincluding those based on their own preconceptions (Stein\nand Bransford, 1979). Distinctiveness processing occurs as\nparticipants seek to determine how different any generated\ninterpretation might differ from the interpretation most\nconsonant with the wording of the shaded drug fact (Jacoby\netal., 1979). This encoding strategy involves deep seman-\ntic processing that is likely to promote the detection of dis-\ncrepancies between alternative interpretations and the most\nveridical label\u00adbased interpretation. The emphasis upon\npossible misinterpretations should also likely bias partici-\npants toward resolving any discrepancies in favor of the\ninterpretation that adheres most closely to the text of the\ndrug fact. As a consequence, easily-confused processing\nshould promote the refutation of misconceptions and the\nrecall of the CRDFs associated with those misconceptions.\n\"Easily-ignored\" label processing.If we instead ask partici-\npants to explain why a consumer might disregard or ignore\na particular shaded drug fact, we encourage them to assess\nthe importance of that drug fact in relative isolation. Some\nelaborative processing will occur as participants seek to\njudge the relative significance of the shaded drug fact.\nSome distinctiveness processing will also occur as partici-\npants seek to determine what evidence they have concern-\ning the authoritativeness of the shaded drug fact. Neither\nform of processing promotes a direct consideration of pos-\nsible misconceptions nor how they might be reconciled\nwith a label-based interpretation of the shaded drug fact. As\na consequence, easily-ignored processing should be less\nlikely than easily-confused processing to promote the refu-\ntation of misconceptions and the recall of the CRDFs asso-\nciated with those misconceptions.\nThe encoding difference produced by easily-confused\nand easily-ignored processing strategies will not be enacted\nas we intend them to be if participants do not take the\ninstructions seriously. In order to increase that likelihood,\nwe asked our participants to spend 40seconds considering\neach shaded drug fact and explaining in writing why it\nmight be confused or why it might be ignored. Numbered\nlines were included at the bottom of each label facsimile for\nthese explanations to be recorded as participants were\npaced through the reading of the aspirin label text (only\nfour of the seven numbered lines for the first Drug Facts\nPanel are shown in Figures 1 and 2). The experimenter also\nattempted to induce a demand bias by asking participants to\nwrite very legibly so that their responses could be easily\nclassified.\nCued-recall of CRDFs. Label information may fail to correct a\nmistaken belief about the safe and effective use of a nonpre-\nscription drug because that belief biases the label compre-\nhension process or because the label text fails to modify the\nmistaken belief. If an individual simply misunderstands cor-\nrective label information as supporting an existing mistaken\nbelief, then the accurate recall of that corrective information\nshould be compromised. However, if an individual fails to\nuse corrective label information to modify a mistaken belief\n4 Health Psychology Open \nFigure 1. Drug Facts Panel with claim-supporting drug facts (CSDFs) shaded and the associated label claims shown in text boxes.\nRyan et al. 5\nFigure 2. Drug Facts Panel with claim-refuting drug facts (CRDFs) shaded and the associated label claims shown in text boxes.\n6 Health Psychology Open \n(see Van Den Broek and Kendeou, 2008), then the corrective\ninformation may be accurately recalled even though the mis-\ntaken belief is retained. Therefore, the recall of corrective\nlabel information provides useful information about why\nnonprescription drug labels may fail to correct mistaken\nbeliefs. We assessed the recall of the 15 CRDFs that cor-\nrected mistaken beliefs about aspirin by using a cued\u00adrecall\ntest rather than a free-recall test. Our cued recall test made\nuse of the keyword associated with each corrective drug fact\nas a retrieval cue for that fact. For example, in both shading\nand both processing conditions we provided menstrual pain\nas a cue for the recall of the drug fact \"Aspirin can be used\nfor the temporarily relief of menstrual pain.\" We did not use\na free-recall test (\"recall all of the drug facts you can recall\nfrom the aspirin label\") because the cued recall test would be\na more sensitive measure of recall for the 15 CRDFs.Acued-\nrecall test also allows us to control the amount of time spent\nin trying to recall a given drug fact and makes the recall task\nmore manageable for our participants.\nExperimental design and hypotheses\nWe used a mixed analysis of covariance to analyze changes\nin truth ratings for label-supported claims (LSCs) and label-\nrefuted claims (LRCs) as a function of reading the aspirin\nlabel. We manipulated the between-groups factor Keyword\nShading to highlight CSDFs or CRDFs. We manipulated\nthe between-groups factor Processing Strategy to encour-\nage Easily-Confused or Easily-Ignored label processing\n(see Figures 1 and 2 for detailed examples). Trials (pretest\nand posttest) served as the single within-groups factor.\nRather than including Claim Type (LSC or LRC) as a sec-\nond within-groups factor, we conducted separate analyses\nof the label-supported and the label-refuted aspirin claims\nin order to clarify and simplify our analyses. Our covariate\nmeasures were designed to assess two components of health\nliteracy. One covariate is domain-specific knowledge of the\norganization and format of nonprescription drug labels--\nour assessment of DFL knowledge. The second covariate is\nthe extended-range vocabulary test we used as a surrogate\nmeasure of general verbal ability. Because we used cued\nrecall only as a posttest measure, those data were analyzed\nwith a between-groups analysis of covariance with\nAttentional Focus and Processing Strategy as our between-\ngroups factors and Label Format Knowledge and Verbal\nAbility as our covariate measures.\nActivation hypothesis. We hypothesize that our attentional-\nfocus manipulation will encourage participants to pay\nclose attention to claim-associated label information. We\nhypothesize that pretest drug claims so targeted will be\nmodified by label processing to a greater degree than those\ndrug claims not so targeted. Ratings of LSCs should\nincrease, and ratings of LRCs should decrease.\nDiscrepancy reconciliation hypothesis.We hypothesize that\nparticipants given easily-confused instructions will engage\nin label-processing efforts that will focus them on the ways\nin which LSCs are verified by supporting label drug facts,\nand the ways in which LRCs are discredited by refuting\nlabel drug facts. Such efforts are expected to promote the\ndetection of discrepancies between LRCs and CRDFs on\nthe facsimile label. Easily confused instructions are also\nexpected to focus participants on the reconciliation of\nclaim/label discrepancies. As a consequence, truth ratings\nfor shaded LSCs will increase and truth ratings for shaded\nLRCs will decrease with easily-confused label processing,\nwhile ratings for unshaded LSCs will increase significantly\nless and ratings for unshaded LRCs will decrease signifi-\ncantly less. In contrast, we hypothesize that participants\ngiven easily-ignored instructions will focus on the salience\nand interest value of drug facts in isolation rather than on\nthe degree to which they verify LSCs and discredit LRCs.\nAs a consequence, easily-ignored processing will increase\ntruth ratings for shaded and unshaded LSCs to a lesser\ndegree than will easily-confused processing. Easily-ignored\nlabel processing will also decrease truth ratings for shaded\nand unshaded LRCs to a lesser degree than will easily-con-\nfused processing.\nCued recall hypothesis.Finally, we expected that CRDFs\nwould be most often recalled when their keywords have been\nshaded (see Figures 1 and 2) and their associated LRCs have\nbeen activated and reconciled with label information. The\ncognitive effort associated with easily-confused processing\nwill promote elaborative and distinctiveness processing to a\ngreater degree than will the cognitive effort associated with\neasily-ignored processing. As a result, recall for the CRDFs\nshould be greater with easily confused label processing. We\ndid not assess recall of claim-supporting drug facts because\nthe focus of the study is on refutational-processing effects.\nMethod\nFigure 3 is a schematic representation of the sequence of\ntasks in this study. The discussion below provides detailed\ninformation about nature and purpose of each task.\nParticipants\nIn order to satisfy a research requirement in their introductory\npsychology course, 170 female and 26 male students signed\nup for the study using an online research-participation sys-\ntem. Only self-reported native English speakers between the\nyears were recruited for the 50-minute,\nsmall-group sessions. After signing the consent form for the\nstudy, participants completed a short form that provided us\nwith information about their use of and preference for non-\nprescription single-ingredient analgesics. The great majority\nRyan et al. 7\nof our participants used nonprescription analgesics other than\naspirin. In total, 145 of them reported having used ibuprofen\ndays, 98 reported using acetaminophen\nduring that period, 48 reported using naproxen, and 18\nreported using aspirin. Only 6 participants reported aspirin to\nbe their preferred medication for pain relief, 114 reported a\npreference for ibuprofen, 35 reported a preference for aceta-\nminophen, and 33 reported a preference for naproxen.\nMaterials and measures\nDFL knowledge.We created a 30-item true\u00adfalse question-\nnaire that sampled participants' knowledge of both the nature\nand ordering of information found on nonprescription drug\nlabels (FDA, 1999). Some items focused on their knowledge\nof the ordering of label headings (e.g. \"Warnings informa-\ntion usually follows Uses information on the Drug Facts\nFigure 3. Sequence of tasks and measures in the study.\n8 Health Psychology Open \nLabel,\" \"Directions about when and how to take an over-the-\ncounter drug are near the end of the Drug Facts Label\").\nOther items focused on specific information included in all\nnonprescription drug labels (e.g. \"Over-the-counter drug\nlabels explain how a drug should be stored to maintain its\npotency,\" \"All over-the-counter drugs include specific cau-\ntions for pregnant or breast-feeding women\"). Scores on this\nquestionnaire ranged from 12 to 25, with a mean score of\nTruth ratings of claims about the drug facts for aspirin.Our\nsurvey included 15 LSCs and 15 LRCs about the drug facts\nto be found on a regular-strength aspirin label (see Tables 1\nand 2 for the complete set of claims). LSCs were statements\nthat paraphrased specific drug facts on the aspirin label and\nare clearly supported by the label text. For example, the\nclaim Students of high-school age or younger should not be\ntreated with aspirin for symptoms of chicken pox or the flu\nis clearly supported by the label drug fact \"Children and\nteenagers who have or are recovering from chicken pox or\nflu-like symptoms should not use this product.\" Figure 1\nshows a portion of the facsimile aspirin label with seven\nLSCs shown on the right next to their CSDFs. LSCs tar-\ngeted supporting drug facts from throughout the facsimile\nlabel. Each targeted drug fact provides information essential\nfor the safe and effective use of aspirin as an analgesic.\nIn contrast, LRCs were statements that misrepresented\nspecific drug facts on the aspirin label and are clearly\nrefuted by the label text. For example, the claim Aspirin\nshould not be used to treat menstrual pain because of the\nrisk for increased bleeding is clearly refuted by the label\ndrug fact \"Uses temporarily relieves ... menstrual pain.\"\nFigure 2 shows seven LRCs shown on the left next to their\nCRDFs. LRCs targeted refuting drug facts from throughout\nthe facsimile label. Each CRDF also provided information\nessential for the safe and effective use of aspirin. In addi-\ntion, the LRC targeting each refuting drug fact was written\nto sound as plausible as possible. Our set of 15 LRCs there-\nfore represented misconceptions about aspirin that were\ndiscrepant from the label text.\nFacsimile aspirin labels. We created a three-page, legal-sized\nfacsimile of the Principal Display Panel and the two Drug\nFacts Panels for a brand name aspirin label. We used Arial\nfont sizes of 14 and 12, respectively, for the standardized\nheadings and text to provide a highly legible version of the\nlabel format mandated by the FDA. The wording and the\nuse of bold face, italics, punctuation, and spacing corre-\nsponded to that used on the actual aspirin label. One version\nof this label used gray highlighting to focus participants'\nattention on the 15 label drug facts that verified the 15 LSCs\n(shown in part in Figure 1). A second version of the label\nused gray highlighting to focus participants'attention on the\n15 label drug facts that discredited the 15 LRCs (shown in\npart in Figure 2).\nLabel-processing instructions.The cover sheet for each fac-\nsimile label instructed participants to attend carefully to the\nTable 1.

Once all participants had\nread their instructions, they were asked to read them very\ncarefully a second time to be certain they understood what\ninformation they needed to write down on the numbered\nlines in the label facsimile. The two facsimile labels were\nassigned randomly to participants in each session.

After participants had read their aspi-\nrin label as directed, they were asked to complete the\nExtended Range Vocabulary Test (ERVT: Ekstrom etal.,\n1976)--a convenient index of general verbal ability. The\ners a wide range of ability levels.

In all experimen-\ntal conditions, recall of label information discrediting each\nof the 15 LRCs was tested by presenting the shaded words\nor phrases associated with those CRDFs (for example,\nmenstrual pain and changes in behavior in Figure 2). When\nthe experimenter read aloud the keyword phrase for a\nclaim-refuting drug fact (see examples shaded in Figure 2),\nTable 2.

Two different random orderings of these cues\nwere alternated from session to session.\nProcedure\nParticipants were tested in six- to eight-person group ses-\nsions, removing the necessary forms from their materials\nfolders as directed by the experimenter. The experimenter\nexplained that the purpose of the study was to find out what\nkinds of problems consumers might experience in reading\nan OTC drug label for aspirin carefully enough to be able to\nself-medicate safely and effectively.\nParticipants were then asked to complete the Drug Facts\nLabel Knowledge questionnaire. Next, they were asked to\nuse a 6-point Likert scale (1=Not At All True; 6=Certainly\nTrue) to report their impressions of the validity of each of\n30 aspirin claims. We told them some claims accurately\nreflected information found on the product label for\nregular-strength aspirin, while other claims contradicted\nlabel information on the label. We told participants to rely\non first impressions in making their judgments. We empha-\nsized that they should report their personal beliefs or feel-\nings rather than what they might have read or heard. We\nalso informed participants they would complete the ques-\ntionnaire a second time after they had read our facsimile\naspirin label. They self-paced themselves through the\nclaims, taking about 3minutes to make their ratings.\nAfter completing the aspirin claims pretest, participants\nwere told they would be reading a facsimile aspirin label\nand answering questions about how consumers might\nrespond to the information on that label. They were told to\nread the cover sheet instructions for their label very care-\nfully to find out what kind of questions they would have to\nanswer about shaded items on the three-page facsimile.\nAfter reviewing their instructions a second time, partici-\nminutes to read the label in its entirety,\nseconds to respond to each shaded item as they\nread. The PDP page in the facsimile had only one shaded\ntext element and a single numbered line at the bottom of the\npage. The experimenter allowed participants seconds to\nread that page carefully and then write their easily-confused\nor easily-ignored response on that line. The two Drug Facts\nPanel pages that followed the PDP page each had seven\nshaded text elements and seven numbered lines for partici-\npants' responses. In order to ensure that all participants\nminutes reading and responding to the label,\nthe experimenter asked them to maintain a pace of 40sec-\nonds for responding to each shaded item; 5-, 2-, and 1-min-\nute warnings were given to assist in maintaining that pace.\nWhen participants finished the label-processing task, they\nminutes to complete the 24-item ERVT. The experi-\nmenter explained that this vocabulary test assessed differ-\nences in verbal ability that might influence performance on\nthe label-processing task. The aspirin claims questionnaire\nwas re-administered immediately thereafter. To minimize\nany confusion in rating the claims, the posttest ordering of\nclaims was the same as the pretest ordering. We anticipated\nthat participants might attempt to recall their initial ratings in\norder to appear consistent or to recall facts from the simu-\nlated label in order to appear informed. To ensure that they\nfocused instead on reporting their label-updated personal\nbeliefs, we strongly and specifically encouraged them to\nreport their current intuitions:\nDon't try to recall to recall your previous ratings or anything\nyou may have read or heard about aspirin--instead just rate the\nstatements according to what you now believe. Read each\nstatement carefully, but then make a snap judgment about how\ntrue it now seems to you.\nThe experimenter again allowed them 3\nminutes to com-\nplete the set of 30 claims.\nFinally, the experimenter administered the cued recall\ntest by reading aloud the shaded words or phrases that sig-\nnaled those label drug facts that refuted each of the 15\nlabel-refuted aspirin claims, allowing 20\nseconds for each\nresponse to be written. Participants were told only that the\nrecall test focused on information about aspirin that was\nparticularly important for its safe and effective use. Once\nthe cued recall task was completed, participants were given\na brief explanation of the purpose of the study and allowed\nto ask any questions they wished.\nAnalysis\nUnit of analysis.For greater clarity in presenting our find-\nings, we analyzed the data for LSCs and LRCs separately. In\norder to ensure that any observed effects were neither partic-\nipant-dependent nor claim-dependent, we conducted paral-\nlel analyses of participants and claims. In the individual\nparticipant analyses, the participant was the unit of analysis,\nand we collapsed across claims to obtain mean LSC and\nLRC scores for each participant on the pretest and the post-\ntest. In this analysis, trials was a within-subjects factor;\nAttentional Focus and Processing Strategy was between-\nsubjects factors. In the individual claim analysis, the LSC or\nLRC was the unit of analysis, and we collapsed across par-\nticipants to obtain mean Attentional Focus, Processing\nStrategy, and Trials scores for each of the 15 LSCs and each\nof the 15 LRCs. In this analysis, Attentional Focus, Process-\ning Strategy, and Trials were within-claims factors.\nData transformations. We first demonstrated that participants\nassigned randomly to the four experimental conditions did\nnot differ in their pre-label ratings of LSCs or LRCs. Because\nthey did not differ significantly, we subtracted pre-label\nscores from post-label scores to obtain the updating index we\nuse in our main analyses. For LSCs, the index should be\npositive because reading the label should increase the truth\nratings for those claims. For LRCs, the index should be nega-\ntive because reading the label should decrease the truth rat-\nings for those claims. The means reported for the\nindividual\u00adparticipant analyses were all adjusted for the\ncovariate effects of Verbal Ability and Label Format Knowl-\nedge scores. The means reported for the individual claim\nanalyses were unadjusted because the two between-subjects\ncovariates could not be used in those analyses. Recall counts\nwere analyzed using both the square-root-of-x transforma-\ntion and the square-root-of-(x plus 1) transformation (How-\nBecause these transformations did not change the pattern or\nsignificance of effects, untransformed counts were used in\nthe analysis of cued recall performance reported below.\nResults\nOverall, the 15 pre-label LSCs received substantially higher\n=\n=\nlabel truth ratings as a function of claim category and\nexperimental condition to determine whether participants\nin our four experimental groups differed initially in their\nratings of LSCs and LRCs. The effect of claim category\np\n=\n=\nstrong effect did not interact with either of the treatment\ngroups to which participants were subsequently assigned,\nFs\n<\n1.00. Although our participants already assigned\nhigher truth ratings to LSCs than to LRCs, our Attentional\nFocus and Processing Strategy manipulations of the label-\nreading process were intended to increase the initial LSC\ntruth ratings and to decrease the initial LRC truth ratings.\nThis analysis of the pretest ratings served two purposes.\nFirst, it demonstrates that there is some validity to our par-\nticipants' preconceptions about aspirin and that we were\nsuccessful in creating plausible LRCs. Second, the absence\nof pretest differences among the four treatment groups\nallows us to simplify the analysis by subtracting pretest rat-\nings from posttest ratings to create change scores as our\nindex of label-induced changes in beliefs. Claim-supporting\neffects are visible as positive values on a bar graph, and\nclaim-refuting effects are visible as negative values on the\nsame bar graph (see Figure 4).\nEffect of label processing on changes in truth\nratings for label-supported aspirin claims\nIndividual-participant analysis. Pre-label truth ratings of LSCs\nwere subtracted from post-label ratings to obtain a measure\nof the degree to which reading the aspirin label increased\ntruth ratings for claims explicitly confirmed on the aspirin\nlabel--an index of CSDF Shading or CRDF Shading. These\nchange scores were entered into a two-factor between-sub-\njects analysis of covariance that included Processing Strat-\negy (Easily Ignored or Easily Confused) and Attentional\nFocus (Claim-Relevant or Claim-Irrelevant) as fixed fac-\ntors, with Label Format Knowledge and Verbal Ability\nentered as covariates. Neither Label Format Knowledge,\n<\np\n<\n0.15, was a statistically significant covariate. The main\n<\n<\n1.00, were not. Covariate-adjusted truth\nratings for LSCs increased significantly more when claim-\nadjusted change score means for all four participant-based\nLSC effects are shown in Figure 4.\nIndividual-claim analysis. Pre-label truth ratings for each of the\n15 LSCs were subtracted from their post-label ratings to\nobtain confirmational updating scores. These change scores\nwere entered into a within-claims two-factor analysis of vari-\nance that included Processing Strategy (Easily-Ignored or\nEasily-Confused) and Attentional Focus (CSDF Shading or\nCRDF Shading) as factors. Because individual claim scores\nwere collapsed across individual participants, there is no\nmeaningful way to include either Label Format Knowledge\nor Verbal Ability as covariates in this analysis. The main\ntion, F(1, 14)<1.00, had a significant effect. Truth ratings for\nLSCs increased significantly more when claim-relevant label\n=\nfour claim-based LSC effects are also shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4. Attentional and processing effects on changes in\ntruth values for label-supported and label-refuted claims.\n12 Health Psychology Open \nCeiling effects. It is possible that processing strategy effects\nwere not detected for truth ratings of LSCs because\nincreases in posttest truth ratings for those claims are lim-\nited by ceiling effects. The distributions of pretest ratings\nfor all 15 LSCs are negatively skewed toward the scale\nmaximum of 6.00, indicating that posttest increases for\nthose claims may be underestimated by our rating scale. We\nevaluated this possibility by examining the correlation\nbetween the sizes of overall pretest ratings for each of the\nLSCs with the overall sizes of posttest increases for those\nclaims. LSCs receiving lower pretest ratings should be less\nsubject to ceiling effects and larger, while LSCs receiving\nhigher pretest ratings should be more subject to ceiling\neffects and smaller. Therefore, a significant negative cor-\nrelation between pretest ratings and posttest increases for\nLSCs would reflect the presence of ceiling effects. Spear-\nman's rho values for easily-confused processing were sig-\nnificantly negative whether the supporting label drug facts\nwere shaded on the label or not, rs\nrs\n<\n0.05, respectively. Rho values for easily\nignored processing were also significantly negative whether\nthe supporting drug facts were shaded or not, rs\nthe absence of processing strategy effects in the claim-by-\nclaim analysis of LSC truth ratings may be due to artifac-\ntual ceiling effects.\nReversals of initial judgments of label-supported claims. It is to\nbe expected that an effective refutational label will reverse\ninitial \"false\" judgments of LSCs but not reverse initial\n\"true\" judgments of LSCs. Truth ratings of LSCs were\ndichotomized into \"true\" judgments of 4, 5, or 6 and \"false\"\njudgments of 1, 2, or 3 to determine if reading the label\nreverses initial judgments. If the label is effective in modi-\nfying LSCs, then the probability that \"false\" judgments of\nthose claims change correctly to \"true\" judgments should\nbe high, and the probability that \"true\" judgments of LSCs\nchange incorrectly to \"false\" judgments should be low.\nOnly the claim-by-claim data have enough false-to-true and\ntrue-to-false cases to permit a meaningful overall analysis\nof such changes. The median false-to-true reversal rate is\n75.6percent for the 15 LSCs, and the median true-to-false\nreversal rate for those claims is 6.2\npercent. There are too\nmany empty cells to permit a similar analysis within each\ntreatment condition or for individual participants. As far as\nLSCs are concerned, these data demonstrate that a careful\nreading of the label is 12 times more likely to correct a mis-\nconception than it is to induce a misconception.\nEffect of label processing on changes in truth\nratings for label-refuted aspirin claims\nIndividual-participant analysis.Pre-label truth ratings of\nLRCs were subtracted from post-label ratings to obtain a\nmeasure of the degree to which reading the aspirin label\ndecreased truth ratings for claims refuted by the label--an\nindex of refutational updating. These change scores were\nentered into a two-factor analysis of covariance that\nincluded Processing Strategy (Easily\u00adIgnored or Easily\nConfused) and Attentional Focus (CSDF Shading or\nCRDF Shading) as between-subjects factors, with Label\nFormat Knowledge and Verbal Ability entered as covari-\nnor Verbal Ability was a significant covariate, Fs<1.00.\nThe main effect of Attentional Focus was significant, F(1,\nsquared\n=\n0.09, but neither Processing Strategy, F(1,\nhad a significant effect. Covariate-adjusted truth ratings\nfor LRCs decreased significantly more when the claim-\nrelevant label text had been shaded (M=-0.15,\nThe adjusted change score means for all four LRC effects\nare displayed in Figure 4.\nIndividual-claim analysis. Pre-label truth ratings for each of\nthe 15 LRCs were subtracted from their post-label ratings\nto obtain refutational updating scores. These change\nscores were entered into a two-factor analysis of covari-\nance that included Processing Strategy (Easily Ignored or\nEasily Confused) and Attentional Focus (CSDF Shading\nor CRDF Shading) as within-claims factors. The main\neffect of Attentional Focus was significant, F(1,\nTruth ratings for LRCs decreased significantly more\nwhen claim-relevant label text was shaded (M=-0.15,\nHowever, the Focus-by-Strategy interaction was signifi-\nsquared\n=\n0.36. Curiously, the interaction represents a\ndifference between the two processing strategies when\nparticipants had been focusing on irrelevant label text\n(that relating to claim-supporting drug facts rather than\nclaim-refuting drug facts). There is a significantly greater\ndecrease in truth ratings for Easily-Confused than for\nEasily-Ignored processing in the claim-irrelevant label\nference is not artifactual because it is comparable in size\nto the nonsignificant interaction found in the individual\nparticipants' analysis reported above. However, an effect\nthat involves processing strategy differences for the\nfocus-condition label on which CSDFs were not shaded\nis not theoretically meaningful. Only the difference\nbetween the two processing strategies in the claim-rele-\nvant shading condition is crucial in this analysis. The dif-\nference in change-scores between the two processing\nstrategies in that condition is not significant, t (14)<1.00.\nChange-score means for all four LRC effects are dis-\nplayed in Figure 4.\n\"Basement\" effects.It is possible that processing-strategy\neffects were not detected for truth ratings of LRCs because\ndecreases in posttest truth ratings for those claims are lim-\nited by basement effects. The distributions of pretest ratings\nfor 8 of the 15 LRCs are positively skewed toward the scale\nminimum of 1.00, indicating that posttest decreases for\nthose claims may be underestimated by our rating scale. We\nevaluated this possibility by examining the correlation\nbetween the sizes of overall pretest ratings for each of the\n15 LRCs with the overall sizes of posttest decreases for\nthose claims. LRCs receiving higher pretest ratings should\nbe less subject to basement effects and larger, while claims\nreceiving lower pretest ratings should be more subject to\nbasement effects and smaller. Therefore, a significant nega-\ntive correlation between pretest ratings and posttest\ndecreases for LRCs would reflect the presence of basement\neffects. Spearman's rho values for easily-confused process-\ning were nonsignificant whether the refuting drug facts\nwere shaded on the label or not, rs\nrs\n>\n0.50, respectively. Rho values for easily-\nignored processing were nonsignificant whether the refut-\ning drug facts were shaded or not, rs\nrs\n>\n0.50. We conclude that the absence of pro-\ncessing-strategy effects in the claim-by-claim analysis of\nLRCs cannot be attributed to artifactual basement effects.\nReversals of initial judgments of label-refuted claims. It is to\nbe expected that an effective refutational label will reverse\ninitial \"true\" judgments of LRCs but not reverse initial\n\"false\" judgments of LRCs. Truth ratings of LRCs were\ndichotomized into \"false\" judgments of 1, 2, or 3 and\n\"true\" judgments of 4, 5, or 6, as we did above for label-\nsupported claim ratings. If the label is effective in modify-\ning misconceptions about LRCs, then the probability that\n\"true\" judgments of LRCs change correctly to \"false\"\njudgments should be high and the probability that \"false\"\njudgments of LRCs change incorrectly to \"true\" judg-\nments should be low. Again, only the claim-by-claim data\nhave enough true-to-false and false-to-true cases to permit\na meaningful overall analysis. The median true-to-false\nreversal rate is 28.6percent, and the median false-to-true\npercent. As far as\nLRCs are concerned, a careful reading of the drug label is\nabout as likely to induce a misconception as it is to correct\na misconception.\nThe nonparametric Mann\u00adWhitney U test (Mann and\nmedian beneficial (false-to-true) reversal rate for LSCs is\nsignificantly higher than the median beneficial (true-to-\nfalse) reversal rate for LRCs, U=5, two-tailed, p<0.05.\nThat test also indicates that the median detrimental (true-to-\nfalse) reversal rate for LSCs is significantly lower than the\nmedian detrimental (false-to-true) reversal rate for LRCs,\nU=7, two-tailed, p<0.05. There are too many empty cells\nto allow us to use this test to evaluate our experimental\nhypotheses, but these results do document how difficult it is\nfor individuals to make use of authoritative label informa-\ntion to correct misconceptions they have about a drug.\nCued-recall of claim-refuting drug facts\nWe used gist scoring to code recall protocols for the label\ndrug facts that refuted each of the 15 LRCs. Drug fact recall\ncounted as correct only if a participant (a) unambiguously\nreported the substance of the refuting drug fact and (b)\nmade no reference of any sort to the label-refuted claim.\nFor example, the claim-refuting drug fact \"It is especially\nimportant not to use aspirin during the last 3\nmonths of\npregnancy ...\" was cued with months of pregnancy in all\nexperimental conditions. Label-based responses such as\n\"last three months--do not take,\" \"should not take aspirin\nif you are 3months before delivery,\" or \"do not take if you\nare in 1st trimester\" were counted as correct. Ambiguous\nresponses such as \"do not take if pregnant for more than\nmonths,\" \"if you are pregnant, you shouldn't take aspi-\nrin,\" or \"3months of pregnancy, do not take\" were counted\nas incorrect. We also excluded from the recall count any\nresponse that echoed one of the 15 LRCs. For the recall cue\nmonths of pregnancy, the associated drug fact was \"It is\nespecially important not to use aspirin during the first three\nmonths of pregnancy.\" Therefore, we counted as incorrect\nsuch responses as \"first 3\nmonths possible birth defects,\"\nmonths, don't use,\" or \"less than 3 could hurt\nnewborn.\"\nMany of the drug facts are bulleted under headings\nthat describe the action to be taken under specified condi-\ntions. Because \"fever lasts more than 3\ndays\" is a drug\nfact that reflects a bulleted condition under the action\nheading Stop use and ask a doctor if, participants had to\nreport both the bulleted condition and the action heading\nfor their response to be counted as correct. For example,\nthe three responses \"Consult a doctor if a fever lasts\n3days or more,\" \"more than 3days, contact doctor imme-\ndiately stop,\" and \"fever lasts for 3days, stop use & con-\ntact doctor\" were all counted as correct in our scoring\nscheme. However, responses such as \"fever lasts more\nthan 10days, consult doctor,\" \"if fever lasts for more than\n3days stop taking it,\" and \"if fever doesn't go away stop\nsee a doctor\" were not. In each of these latter three\nresponses, the condition or the action is either incorrectly\nspecified or unspecified.\nThe second and third authors independently coded each\nof the 15 cued-recall responses for all 196 participants. The\nrecall form was separated from the rest of the participants'\nmaterials so that the two coders were unaware of the exper-\nimental condition associated with the responses they were\ncoding. Beforehand, both coders classified all recall\nresponses from 20 randomly chosen protocols. The first\nauthor then resolved through discussion with them what\nadditional coding guidelines would resolve all coder\n14 Health Psychology Open \ndisagreements. For example, the response \"consult a doctor\nif a fever lasts 3\ndays or more\" was counted as correct\nbecause we reasoned that stopping the use of the drug was\nimplicit in deciding to consult a doctor and would often go\nunsaid by participants. However, \"if fever lasts for more\nthan 3day stop taking it\" was not counted as correct because\nwe reasoned that seeing a doctor was not implicit in decid-\ning to stop using the drug. These supplemental guidelines\nwere included as notes in the Excel files that both coders\nused to record their responses. Between-coder agreement\nwas assessed as the Pearson correlation between the two\nrecall counts obtained for each participant. Overall, that\nUntransformed counts of label-based recall were used in\nthe final individual -participant and individual-claim analy-\nses because no square-root transformation affected the out-\ncome of those analyses.\nIndividual-participant analysis.Verbal Ability was a significant\ncovariate in the between-subjects analysis of covariance of\ncued-recall counts for label-refuting drug facts, F(1,\n<\n0.05, but Label Format Knowledge was not,\npartial eta-squared\n=\n0.03, significantly affected cued recall\ncounts.

When we highlighted key words or\nphrases in the label text to draw our participants' attention\nto claim-supporting drug facts, truth ratings of label-sup-\nported claims increased significantly more than when we\ndid not. When we highlighted keywords or phrases in the\nlabel text to draw our participants' attention to claim-refut-\ning drug facts, truth ratings of label-refuted claims\ndecreased significantly more than when we did not. With\nclaim-relevant highlighting, the increase in truth-ratings for\nlabel-supported claims was about five times greater than\nthe decrease in truth ratings for label-refuted claims.\nWe found no support for our reconciliation hypothesis in\nthe claim-rating data. When participants used the easily-\nconfused processing strategy to evaluate highlighted drug\nfacts, truth ratings of LSCs did not increase significantly\nmore than when participants used the easily-ignored pro-\ncessing strategy. Similarly, when participants used easily-\nconfused processing to evaluate highlighted drug facts,\ntruth ratings of LRCs did not decrease significantly more\nthan when participants used the easily-ignored processing\nstrategy.\nWe found support for both the activation hypothesis and\nthe reconciliation hypothesis in our cued-recall data. The\nattentional-focus manipulation and the label-processing\nFigure 5. The effects of claim-relevant and claim-irrelevant\nshading effects and \"easily-ignored\" and \"easily-confused\" label\nprocessing on the cued-recall of claim-refuting drug facts.\nmanipulation had significant and independent effects on the\ncued recall of claim-refuting drug facts. Cued-recall of\nthese CRDFs was significantly greater when they had been\nshaded in the label text than when they had not. Cued-recall\nof claim-refuting label text was also significantly greater\nwith easily-confused label processing than with easily-\nignored processing. The difference in cued-recall rates\nattributable to attentional focus was more than three-and-a-\nhalf times greater than that attributable to processing\nstrategy.\nInterpretation of findings\nOur data provide partial support for the co-activation\naccount of refutation text effects on misconceptions.\nFocusing our participants' attention on drug facts that\nrefuted a false claim about aspirin clearly decreased our par-\nticipants' faith in such claims. However, a label-processing\nstrategy that involved a consideration of how consumers\nmight be confused by those drug facts produced no addi-\ntional decrease in their faith in those false claims. One inter-\npretation of our claim-rating data is that our easily-confused\nprocessing strategy simply failed to prompt the reconcilia-\ntion of false aspirin claims with refuting drug facts on the\nlabel. However, this interpretation fails to explain why refu-\ntational easily-confused processing produced an increase in\nthe recall of refuting drug facts.\nPrior to offering an interpretation of our findings, we\nshould note that prior efforts to use this paradigm to produce\nrefutation change have been only modestly effective, with\nconfirmatory updating values on our 6-point scale ranging\n-0.27, respectively. Surprisingly, the shading manipulation\nand the processing intervention in this study did not produce\nsubstantially greater updating effects than those we had pre-\nviously obtained by simply asking participants to read the\nlabel carefully while checking for typographical errors.\nOur interpretation of the findings in this study is that\nrefutational change does not involve replacing a na\u00efve mis-\nconception with a correct conception. Instead, we believe\nthat a na\u00efve misconception remains in memory, but the\nrefuting information is stored as well and can be used to\noverride that intuitive belief with a more reasoned explana-\ntion. With respect to Kahneman's (2003) distinction between\nintuitive and logical modes of thought, we assume that the\ntruth-rating data in this study reflect intuitive reasoning,\nwhile the cued-recall data reflect logical reasoning. From\nthis perspective, the reconciliation process involves a rea-\nsoned comparison of a LRC and the aspirin label's CRDF.\nWhen the reconciliation process favors the label's authorita-\ntive drug facts, what is added to memory is the reconciling\naccount and the CRDF, and what remains in memory is the\nintuitive belief that underlies the LRC.\nTversky and Kahneman (1971) used just an account\nsuch as the one we propose to explain why the intuitive\njudgments of statistically sophisticated researchers were\ninconsistent with formal statistical principles. More\nrecently, Masson etal. (2014) have shown that physics\nexperts are more likely than physics novices to activate\nbrain regions involved in inhibition when they evaluate\nan electrical circuit displays that illustrate a common\nmisconception about electrical circuits. Masson et\nal.\nargue that the misconception lives on in the memory of\nthe experts but that experts suppress their intuitive belief\nin favor of a logic-based scientific account. In our study,\nparticipants were given instructions to rely on their \"gut\nfeelings\" when they rated aspirin claims, but they were\ntold to be as accurate and as clear as possible in respond-\ning to the recall prompts for CRDFs. We believe that the\nrecall of a refuting drug fact reflects the successful rec-\nonciliation of an incorrect claim with label information.\nHowever, the feeling-based misconception lives on in\nmemory to bias intuition-based responses on the claim-\nrating task.\nLimitations of the study\nOne limitation of our study is that our processing manipula-\ntion may have been relatively weak. Participants using\neither the \"easily-confused\" or the \"easily-ignored\" pro-\ncessing strategy had only 40seconds to develop a response\nto each of the 15 label drug facts they considered.\nParticipants were not forced to justify their responses nor to\nrate their confidence in them. However, the significant\neffect of processing strategy on cued recall indicates that\nthe manipulation was an effective one, but that it did not\naffect truth ratings. As we have explained above, it may be\nthat misconceptions and their intuitive truth values endure\neven after they have been supplanted by scientific\nexplanations.\nA second limitation of this study is that our label-com-\nprehension task lacks ecological validity. We designed\nthis study to create optimal conditions for correcting mis-\nconceptions. We shaded keywords associated with\nCRDFs, and we asked participants to spend 40\nseconds\nwriting an explanation of how a reader might ignore or\nmisunderstand the refuting drug fact. Our finding that\ntruth ratings of invalid claims changed decreased very lit-\ntle under these conditions suggests that more routine\nlabel encounters (purchasing a drug or using the drug)\nwould be even less productive in refuting misconcep-\ntions. The recall of specific drug facts should be compro-\nmised as well. If a consumer is only casually attending to\nlabel information when purchasing or using a drug, recall\nfor drug facts is likely to be close to that we found for\nthose drug facts that were not shaded on our facsimile\nlabels. In that condition, our participants only recalled\nabout one-third of the 15 unshaded drug facts. It would\n16 Health Psychology Open \nbe of interest to examine truth-rating and cued recall per-\nformance for individuals who used a nonprescription\ndrug on a regular basis to treat a chronic condition. Those\nadults taking daily 81-mg doses of aspirin as part of a\n\"heart-healthy\" regimen would be an ideal consumer\npopulation for such a study.\nA final limitation is our choice of aspirin as a nonpre-\nscription drug. We chose aspirin because we find that young\nadults are much more likely to use ibuprofen or acetami-\nnophen as their analgesic of choice. In principle, the amena-\nbility of aspirin misconceptions to label-based correction\nmay be quite different from that of other nonprescription\nanalgesics. However, we have obtained similar results in an\nunpublished study in which participants read ibuprofen or\nacetaminophen labels to confirm or correct preconceptions\nabout those two sets of drug facts. Both drug labels give rise\nto the same strong confirmational effects and weak refuta-\ntional effects we observe for aspirin. Future research should\nfocus on other classes of nonprescription drugs such as anti-\nhistamines, antitussives, antidiarrheals, and acid reducers.\nImplications\nThis study demonstrates the potential for the strategic\nuse of text shading and PDP warnings to improve the\ncomprehension of nonprescription drug labels. We\nshaded 15 claim-refuting text elements in one of our fac-\nsimile labels and 15 claim-confirming text elements in\nthe other. Given that very few label elements are shaded\nin current drug labels (Leat etal., 2014), much greater\nuse can be made of this tactic for calling consumers'\nattention to drug facts that refute na\u00efve misconceptions\nabout a drug product. However, research will first be\nnecessary to identify the drug-specific misconceptions\nthat would constitute \"Primary Refutation Objectives.\"\nCurrently, the FDA helps drug manufacturers define and\nrefine the Primary Communication Objects for a nonpre-\nscription drug label. However, it may be even more\nimportant to consider whether a drug label is effective in\ncorrecting stubborn misconceptions about the safe and\neffective use of nonprescription drugs.\nFurther research will also be necessary to determine\nwhich general warnings ought to be showcased on the bot-\ntle-cap or the PDP of a nonprescription drug container. The\ninjunction to \"Always Read the Label\" or \"See New\nWarnings Information\" may be contributing little to foster-\ning powerful label-processing strategies. We have shown\nthat the general injunction to \"consider why you might be\nconfused by some of these drug facts\" or to \"consider why\nyou might ignore some of drug facts\" can improve drug\nfacts recall. Other general injunctions may be more effec-\ntive than either one of these label-processing strategies.\nImproving the quality of general label-comprehension\nstrategies need not require the omission of singularly\nimportant warnings. For example, the bottle-cap for\nTylenol\u00ae includes the vital information that the product\n\"Contains Acetaminophen\" as well as the general injunc-\ntion to \"Always Read the Label.\"\nThis study makes it clear that calling consumers'\nattention to critical label information and urging them to\nbe mindful of the potential for misunderstanding may\nprove ineffective in refuting intuitive misconceptions\nabout aspirin. Future research should focus first on the\ngenerality of this effect--across a range of analgesics, a\nrange of nonprescription drug classes, and a range of\nconsumer populations. Just as importantly, future\nresearch must identify innovative ways to make it pos-\nsible for nonprescription drug labels to serve as refuta-\ntion texts. A nonprescription drug label fails to serve its\nintended purpose if it confirms consumers' valid precon-\nceptions about the drug but does little to refute their\ninvalid preconceptions.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nEthical approval\nThe authors received formal approval from the University's\nInstitutional Review Board to conduct this study.
