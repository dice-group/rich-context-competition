Our study focusses on the modulatory effects of anthocyanidins--malvidin (MAL) and pelargonidin\n(PEL)--on topoisomerase II poison mitoxantrone (MXT)-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in in vitro and in vivo\ndetermine cell viability. Further, experiments on cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction by single agents or combinations\nwere performed. In vitro and in vivo antigenotoxic effect of MAL/PEL against MXT was evaluated in human lymphocytes\nand mouse bone marrow cells. Methods. Cytotoxicity of test agents and apoptosis induction in HepG2 cells was assessed\nby MTT assay, trypan blue dye exclusion assay and Hoechst 33258 staining. Antigenotoxic effects of MAL/PEL against\nMXT were assessed in co-treated human lymphocytes and bone marrow from mice that received MXT intraperitoneally\n30 minutes post MAL/PEL oral administration Results. Dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed with all 3 test agents\nin HepG2 cells. Highest test concentration of 100 \u00b5M MAL, 640 \u00b5M PEL, and 10 \u00b5M MXT decreased HepG2 cell viability\nby 80%, 30%, and 90%, respectively. The combination of 1 \u00b5M MXT + 80 \u00b5M MAL reduced cell viability better than\nsingle agents. MAL/PEL treatment significantly reduced MXT-induced genotoxicity in human lymphocytes and micronuclei\nformation in mice. Conclusion. Combination of MAL/PEL with lower doses of MXT, especially MAL+MXT increases the\ncytotoxicity in cancer cells. In addition, MXT treatment with MAL/PEL reduced MXT-induced genotoxicity and protected\nnormal cells during chemotherapy.\n",

MAL, abundantly present in ber-\nries and occurring attached to a sugar moiety, is responsible for\nthe blue-red color and has been proved to have antioxidant,\nantidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory activities.18,19 PELis the red\ncolor\u00adproducing anthocyanidin found in fruits especially\npomegranate and is known to possess estrogenic activity.20\nTopoisomerase inhibitors form a major class of antineo-\nplastic agents consistently used in the therapy regimens of\nvarious cancers.21 MXT is a topoisomerase II\u00adtargeting\nanthracenedione that efficiently works against acute leuke-\nmia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast, liver, lung, pros-\ntate, and bladder cancer.22 Although MXT has been known\nto produce considerably fewer side effects, such as cardio-\ntoxicity than doxorubicin,23 drug resistance is a major\ndrawback observed in treated cases.24 In addition, the high-\ndose regimen induces genetic damage in cells, which might\nbe a cause for secondary cancers.25 Studies have also\nshown selective antiproliferative potential of anthocyanins\nagainst cancer cells compared to normal cells, where nor-\nmal cells are minimally or completely unaffected.26,27\nThus, coadministration of anthocyanins, especially MAL\nor PEL with MXT, might be an effective strategy to reduce\ngenotoxicity in normal cells and enhance antitumor effi-\ncacy as a combination therapy providing a low-dose, mul-\ntitargeted approach with high antineoplastic efficacy,\nwarranting better outcome with minimal side effects.28,29\nThe results of the present study showed that MAL with\nlow doses of MXT, than PEL in combination or as single-\nagent treatment, efficiently killed hepatocellular carcinoma\ncells and also that MAL/PEL+ low doses of MXT potentially\nreduced MXT-induced in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity.\nMaterials and Methods\nChemicals and Drugs\nand chemotherapeutic drug mitoxantrone dihydrochloride\nSigma-Aldrich, Germany. All other chemicals used in the\nstudy were of analytical grade.\nCell Line\nHuman hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2 was pro-\ncured from National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune, India\nand cultured in DMEM (Himedia, India) containing 10%\nheat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA), 100\nunits/mL penicillin G, 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Himedia,\nIndia), 2 mM glutamine (Gibco, USA), 25 mM HEPES, and\ncells/mL. Cells growing in the exponential phase were har-\nvested at 80% to 90% confluency and subsequently used for\nexperiments under standard conditions (37\u00b0C in 5% CO2\nwith 95% humidity) in an Eppendorf\u00adNew Brunswick\nGalaxy CO2\nincubator. Cells were grown up to 3 passages\nbefore the treatments.\nAnimals\nAll the experiments were carried out with male Swiss albino\nThese animals were bred in the university animal house and\nmaintained at 25\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C on the standard mouse diet and\nwater ad libitum in accordance with guidelines from\nCommittee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of\nExperiments on Animals (CPCSEA). Approval for this\nwork was obtained from the university animal ethical com-\nPreliminary Analysis of in Vitro Cytotoxic Activity\nThe dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic activity of MAL,\nPEL, and MXT in experimental cells was measured using\nthe MTT assay. Briefly, HepG2 cells were plated at a den-\nmedium/well. Following 24 hours of incubation and\nattachment, the cells were treated with MAL (10-100 \u00b5M),\ntreatment periods, cell viability was analyzed by MTT\nassay to compare the ability of metabolically active cells\nto reduce tetrazolium salt to colored formazan compounds.\nMTT (Sigma, MO) at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL\nwas added to each well and incubated for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C\n. After 4 hours, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\nwas added to each well to solubilize formed formazan.\nreference filter using an iMark microtitre plate reader\n(BioRad, USA). All the experiments were performed in\ntriplicate.\nCotreatment and Trypan Blue Dye Exclusion\nAssay\nFor evaluating the combinatorial effect of experimental\ncompounds in inducing cytotoxicity, cancer cells were\ntreated with anthocyanins and chemotherapeutic drug as\nsingle agents or in combinations of low and high concen-\ntrations for a period of 24 hours, and cell viability was\nassessed using trypan blue dye exclusion assay. 0.4% try-\npan blue was added to the treated cells. After 5 minutes,\ncells were loaded into a hematocytometer and counted\nbased on dye uptake. Cells with damaged membrane\nappeared blue because of the accumulation of dye and\nwere counted as dead. Live cells maintained cell mem-\nbrane integrity and did not take up the dye. The number of\nviable cells was calculated as a percentage of the total cell\npopulation.\nMorphological Assessment by Phase Contrast\nMicroscopy\nExponentially growing cells were seeded on 24-well\nhours, the cells were treated with specified concentra-\ntions of anthocyanins and chemotherapeutic drug as sin-\ngle agents and combinations. At the end of the\nexperimental period, digital photographs were taken\nvisualizing the treated cells under a phase contrast\ninverted microscope (TS100-F, Nikon, Japan) to assess\ntheir morphology.\nStaining\nThe ability and extent of apoptosis induction by experimen-\ntal compounds as single agents and combinations was\nassessed by staining cells with Hoechst 33258. Briefly, after\nthe experimental period, cells were trypsinized and washed\ntwice with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4); 100 \u00b5L\nmL) for 20 minutes, and the characteristic apoptotic mor-\nphological changes, chromatin condensation, and fragmen-\ntation were observed under a fluorescent microscope\n(Eclipse 80i, Nikon, Japan).\nHuman Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte\nCulture\nTo determine the protective effect of the anthocyanins\nagainst MXT-induced genomic instability in non-tumori-\ngenic cells, human peripheral blood lymphocytes were cul-\ntured and treated with specific concentrations of\nexperimental drugs as mentioned above. Briefly, blood\nsamples were collected in heparin-coated tubes from\nhealthy donors. Lymphocytes were isolated from the blood\nusing Histopaque (Sigma) and were cultured in a humidi-\nmented with 20% FBS, 200 mM l-glutamine, penicillin\ndescribed.30 Then, 0.2 mL of phytohemagglutinin M\n(Himedia, India) was added to induce cell division. Ethical\napproval for using human blood samples was obtained from\nthe Institutional Ethical Committee for Human Research\nMitotic Index (MI) and Chromosomal Aberration\n(CA) Assay\nTo determine the MI, after incubation for a specific period\nwith experimental drugs, the cultured lymphocytes were\ncentrifuged at 300g for 15 minutes, washed with ice cold\nPBS (pH 7.4), and resuspended in 6 mL of prewarmed hypo-\nminutes. Cells were then centrifuged and fixed in Carnoy's\nfixative (methanol:acetic acid, 3:1). The slides were pre-\npared and stained with 4% Giemsa for 8 to 10 minutes. The\nfrequency of mitotic cells per culture condition was deter-\nmined by tallying the number of mitotic cells out of a popu-\nlation of 1000 consecutive cells, ignoring broken cells,\nclumped cells, and cellular debris. For the analysis of CA\ninduced, the experimental cells were treated with colchicine\nand then harvested and fixed as mentioned above. Slides\nwere prepared by dropping 3 to 5 drops of the fixed cell sus-\npension on a clean slide and air dried. The slides were stained\nwith Giemsa. For each treatment, 100 well-spread meta-\nphases were analyzed to detect the presence of CAs.\nTreatment of Mice With Anthocyanidins and\nMXT\nMAL (1 or 2 mg/kg b.w.) and PEL (5 or 10 mg/kg b.w) were\ndissolved in double-distilled water and administered to\nmice by gavage (10 mL/kg b.w.). MXT (6 mg/kg b.w) was\ndissolved in distilled water and injected intraperitoneally\n(10 mL/kg b.w.), 30 minutes after the administration of\nMAL/PEL. The control animals received the same volume\nof distilled water. Depending on the body weight (b.w.) of\nthe animals, volume administered varied, so as to match the\ndoses. The doses of anthocyanins for in vivo studies were\nchosen as described previously.31\nBone Marrow Micronucleus Test\nAfter treatment with specific concentrations of MAL, PEL,\nand MXT, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation;\nbone marrow cells from the femur were collected in tubes\ncontaining FBS, and genotoxic effects were evaluated by\nthe mouse bone marrow micronucleus test according to\nSchmid.32 The dose for in vivo analysis was fixed based on\nthe in vitro results and previous literature. Slides were pre-\npared and stained with May-Gr\u00fcnwald and Giemsa stain. A\ntotal of 2000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) were\nscored per animal per slide to determine the frequency of\nmicronucleated PCEs (MnPCEs).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe results are presented as mean \u00b1 SD of replicate analy-\nses of independent experiments. Statistical analyses were\ncarried out using ANOVA by GraphPad Ver 5.03 statistical\nsoftware and Microsoft Excel. Differences at P < .05 or less\nwere considered statistically significant.\nResults\nDose and Time Determination for Combination\nTreatment\nThe experimental cells were treated with different doses of\nMAL, PEL, and MXT to determine the ideal concentration\nthat could produce cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. Our results\nshow that there was a prominent dose-dependent decrease\nin cell viability when treated with MAL for 24 hours. Figure\n1A shows that approximately 60% and 80% cytotoxicity\nwas induced at concentrations of 40 and 100 \u00b5M (highest\ndose used for the study) of MAL, respectively. PEL induced\nonly 30% cytotoxicity even at the maximum concentration\nof 640 \u00b5M (Figure 1B) used in the study for all 3 time peri-\nMXT produced a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability.\nApproximately, 50% cytotoxicity was induced at 2 \u00b5M, and\nalmost 90% cell killing was observed at the highest dose of\nMXT used for the study (10 \u00b5M). There was no significant\ntime-dependent difference in the cytotoxicity (Figure 1C).\nBased on our observation, the doses for further investiga-\ntion into the combinatorial cytotoxic effect of MAL+MXT\nand PEL+MXT, and antigenotoxic effects of MAL and PEL\nagainst MXT-induced genotoxicity in experimental cells\nwere chosen to be 40, 80, and 1 \u00b5M for MAL, PEL, and\nMXT respectively for a time period of 24 hours.\nCombinatorial Effect of MAL, PEL, and MXT on\nHepG2 Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis Induction\nAfter cotreatment with combinations of MAL, PEL, and\nMXT, the ratio of viable cells was analyzed. All treated\ncells had significant decrease in cell count when compared\nwith untreated control cells. We observed that 1 \u00b5M MXT +\nto 60% cell death was induced when they were used as sin-\ngle agents (Figure 2). The cotreatment of MXT+PEL did\nnot produce significant cytotoxicity when compared with\nMXT alone or MXT+MAL (data not shown). Our results of\ncotreatment show that 1 \u00b5M MXT was sufficient enough to\ninduce around 70% to 80% cytotoxicity when combined\nFigure 1. Dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effects of (A) MAL (0-100 \u00b5M), (B) PEL (0-640 \u00b5M), and (C) MXT (0-10 \u00b5M) on\nHepG2 cells.

There was no statistically significant increase in\ncytotoxicity when the cotreatment groups were compared.\nMorphological assessment of treated cells by phase con-\ntrast microscopy showed that control cells formed a com-\nplete monolayer with robust epithelial morphology (Figure\n3A), whereas treated cells exhibited cell shrinkage and\ndetachment of cells from the monolayer, indicating the\noccurrence of apoptosis (Figures 3B-3G).\nThe changes in the nuclear morphology to determine the\nextent of apoptosis induction in the experimental cells as\nevidenced by Hoechst 33258 staining showed that the con-\ntrol cells had intact nuclei (Figure 4A), whereas all the\ntreated cells had nuclear changes with varying degrees of\napoptotic features (Figures 4B-4G). Apoptosis induction is\ncharacterized by chromatin condensation, fragmentation of\nnuclear material, membrane blebbing, and formation of\napoptotic bodies. We found that there was no significant\ndifference in the number of apoptotic cells within the\ncotreated cells. However, cells treated with 1 \u00b5M MTX+40\n\u00b5M MAL and 1 \u00b5M MTX+80 \u00b5M MAL had increased fluo-\nrescence (Figures 4F and 4G) when compared with cells\ntreated with single agents, showing increased chromatin\ncondensation marking severe apoptosis induction.\nEffect of Cotreatment on Normal Cells\nTo analyze the genoprotective nature of MAL and PEL\nagainst MXT in normal cells, human peripheral blood\nlymphocytes were treated with the same doses and com-\nbinations of MAL, PEL, and MXT as HepG2 cells.\nFigures 5A and 6A show the MIs of treated lymphocytes.\nWe observed that 2 \u00b5M MXT greatly reduced the dou-\nbling potential of cells when compared with untreated\ncontrol cells, and cells treated with 1 \u00b5M MXT had ~25%\nto 30% MI. Cotreatment with MXT+MAL reduced the MI\nof cells similar to MXT alone, whereas it was compara-\ntively higher in cells treated with MAL alone (Figure 5A).\nMXT+PEL treatment showed a higher MI than MXT\ntreatment alone (Figure 6A). PEL treatment as a single\nagent did not show any change when compared with the\ncontrol.\nThe protective effect of cotreatment at the chromosomal\nlevel was analyzed by calculating the number of abnormal\nmetaphases and total number of CAs, such as breaks, gaps,\nand dicentrics. Analysis of single-agent treatment showed\ncells with CA, respectively, whereas the number of cells\nwith CA after MAL or PEL treatment was not significant.\nCotreatment of MXT with MAL/PEL greatly reduced the\nnumber of cells with CA to half the percentage when treated\nwith MXT alone (Figures 5B and 6B). Also, 1 \u00b5M MXT+40\nPEL, and 1 \u00b5M MXT+80 \u00b5M PEL reduced the incidence to\nIn Vivo Genoprotective Activity\nAnalysis of the protective effect of MAL and PEL against\nMXT-induced genotoxicity was evaluated by micronuclei\nassay. It was observed that there was a significant dose-\ndependent increase in percentage of MnPCEs in all MXT-\ntreated animals when compared with control (Figure 7). As\nconcentrations of MXT (2-8 mg/kg b.w. ) used for the study\nhad a significant impact on the genome integrity, 6 mg/kg\nb.w. was chosen for further analysis during combination\nstudies. The frequency of MnPCEs was found to be maxi-\nmum in MXT-alone treated animals, whereas there was a\nstatistically insignificant incidence at the higher doses of\nMAL (2 mg/kg b.w.) and PEL (10 mg/kg b.w.) treatments\nused in the study when compared with the control. A dose-\ndependent reduction in the level of genotoxicity was\nobserved in the combined treatment. MXT (6 mg/kg b.w.)\nwith PEL (5 mg/kg b.w.), and PEL (10 mg/kg b.wt) treat-\nment reduced the frequency of MnPCEs to ~40% and\n45.5%, respectively, when compared with the control\n(Figure 8). There was no significant variation between the\ncombined treatment animals. MXT+MAL (1 mg/kg b.w.)\ntreatment reduced the MnPCE incidence to ~38% when\ncompared with MXT-treated animals (Figure 9). Thus, our\nresults show that minimal doses of MAL (1 and 2 mg/kg\nb.w.) greatly reduced drug-induced genotoxicity when com-\npared with minimal dose of PEL (5 mg/kg b.w.).\nFigure 2.

Among\nthe anthocyanins, MAL and PEL have been proved to pos-\nsess chemopreventive potential in several reports. However,\ntheir potential cytotoxic and genoprotective activities when\ngiven in combination with standard drugs are yet to be elu-\ncidated. In the current study, MAL produced significant\ndeath of experimental cells, whereas PEL was not cytotoxic.\nSimilar results have been obtained in our previous study\ninvolving HL-6033 and several other studies on cell lines\nMAL, (F) 1 \u00b5M MXT+40 \u00b5M MAL, and (G) 1 \u00b5M MXT+80 \u00b5M MAL.

However, this work serves as a pilot study for the use\nof MAL and PEL in combination with MXT to enhance the\ncytotoxicity in HepG2. The dose of MXT needed for effec-\ntive killing of cancer cells in combination was reduced to\n50% of the required concentration when administered as a\nsingle agent. This reduction in dose may be attributed to the\nsynergistic or additive effect of MAL and PEL when coad-\nministered with MXT. Similar synergistic activities have\nbeen observed in several other phytochemicals when given\nas combinations of epicatechin, tea polyphenols, curcumin,\nand other flavonoids.38,39 The reduction in the dose of MXT\nused might prevent acquired drug resistance induced during\nThe results of the study also show successful activation\nof apoptosis in the experimental cells subjected to combi-\nnation treatment, as evidenced by Hoechst staining.\nStudies have shown that extracts rich in anthocyanins such\nas blueberry extract and red wine inhibited the growth of\nseveral cell lines by the activation of apoptosis, specifi-\ncally modulating the expression levels of Bax/Bcl-2, cas-\npases, ERK, mitochondrial membrane potential along\ntion of the exact mechanism that is responsible for cancer\ncell toxicity during cotreatment of MAL or PEL with MXT\nis necessary to understand the alteration in the cellular\nphysiology and assessment of any deleterious effects that\nmight be produced.\nThe ROS thus, expected to be generated by combination\ntreatment might interact with the macromolecules of sur-\nrounding normal cells and in turn induce genotoxicity with\nsubsequent alterations in cell cycle and development of sec-\nondary cancers. Huber etal45 have shown that DNAdamage\ninduced in the cells of the microenvironment in prostate\ncancer might lead to secondary cancers. In addition, MXT\nFigure 9.

PEL+MXT treat-\nment in cells showed a slight increase in the MI and lower\ngenoprotective effect when compared with MAL+MXT,\nproving that MAL cotreatment with MXT gives an additive\neffect in inducing chemopreventive and genoprotective\nfunction relative to single agents. Circulating tumor cells\ngenerally exhibited a biologically aggressive cancer pheno-\ntype, accompanied by selective resistance to chemother-\napy.47 The introduction of combination therapy involving\nMXT + anthocyanidins can effectively reduce the aggres-\nsiveness of cancer and its progression.\nThe in vivo assessment of combination treatment of\nPEL/MAL with MXT also showed that the anthocyanidins\nunder study greatly reduced the frequency of micronucle-\nated cells, thereby reducing the chances of therapy-induced\ncancer development and drug resistance. The reduction in\ngenotoxicity after MAL/PEL treatment was similar to that\nof the effect observed in our previous study on combinato-\nrial treatments of anthocyanidins with cyclophosphamide.31\nThis study thus confirms the genoprotective activity of spe-\ncific anthocyanins MAL and PEL that could be effectively\nused to enhance the existing methods of chemotherapy,\nespecially combination treatment with topoisomerase\ninhibitors for improved patient survival.\nConclusion\nIt is well known that anthocyanins have the potential to nor-\nmalize several physiological activities in disease condi-\ntions. However, lack of knowledge on synergistic\ninteractions, predictable combinations, and their clinical\noutcomes prevent the use of these plant-derived compounds\nin therapy regimens. The present study thus proposes the\nprimary idea of utilizing a combination of anthocyanins and\nchemotherapeutic drugs, especially MAL/PEL+MXT,\nwhich ensures cancer cell killing along with the protection\nof genome integrity in normal cells. Our study has focused\non the application of specific anthocyanins in combination\nwith specific chemotherapeutic drugs. However, further\nanalysis on the molecular mechanisms orchestrated during\nsuch combination treatments might help in the development\nand analysis of several other combinations of phytochemi-\ncals with conventional therapeutic agents and enhance cur-\nrent therapy strategies, minimizing or nullifying the side\neffects, if any.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nDr.KPK Thank the Department of Science and Technology\n(SERB), & University Grants Commission [UGC F.
