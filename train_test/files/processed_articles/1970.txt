    "abstract": "Abstract--In the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a US longitudinal study of 15 000 young adults, we\nexamined the extent to which socioeconomic status is linked to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and whether biobehavioral\nrisk factors mediate the association. More than 62% of the participants had SBP 120 mm Hg and 12% had SBP\n140 mm Hg. More than 66% were classified as at least overweight (body mass index 25 kg/m2), with 36% meeting\ncriteria for at least class I obesity (body mass index 30 kg/m2). Multivariate models showed that higher household\nincome and being married were independently associated with lower SBP. Higher body mass index, greater waist\ncircumference, smoking, and higher alcohol intake were each independently associated with higher SBP. Meditational\nanalyses suggested that higher education level was associated with lower SBP by way of lower body mass, smaller waist\ncircumference, and lower resting heart rate. When these indirect effects were accounted for, education was not\nsignificantly associated with SBP. In contrast, household income remained associated with SBP even with control for\nall of the covariates.

The study\nwas reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at the\nUniversity of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Written consent was\nobtained for all of the data collection. The participants were followed\nin 4 waves of data collection.15 Participants without SBP mea-\nsures or survey sample weights were excluded, leaving a final\nMeasures\nDemographic Measures\nAge and marital status (yes/no) were recorded assessed at Wave IV.\nRace was constructed from a series of queries at Wave I.\nSBP, Resting HR, and Cardiac Medication Use\nCertified field interviewers measured respondents' resting, seated\nsystolic, and diastolic blood pressures (in millimeters of mercury)\nand pulse rate (in beats per minute).16 After a 5-minute seated rest,\n3 serial measurements were performed at 30-second intervals using\na factory calibrated, MicroLife BP3MC1-PC-IB oscillometric blood\npressure monitor (MicroLife USA, Inc, Dunedin, FL), and SBP was\nconstructed as the average of measures 2 and 3 and are highly\nreliable.17 Cardiac medication status was assessed at the Wave IV\nin-home interview.\nBMI and Waist Circumference\nHeight, weight, and waist circumference were assessed at Wave IV.\nBMI was calculated as BMIweight (in kilograms)/height (in meters\nsquared). BMI was modeled in its continuous form in our primary\nanalyses, but for descriptive purposes also was reported in the\ncircumference was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm at the superior\nborder of the iliac crest.16\nPhysical Exercise, Alcohol Consumption, and\nSmoking Behavior\nExercise was represented by a yes/no variable that assessed regular\n(on a weekly basis) participation in any bouts of physical activity,\nsuch as walking or strenuous sports.19 Alcohol consumption was\ndefined as follows: 0nondrinker; 1occasional drinker, drink 2\ndays of the week; 2light, drink 5 to 7 days per week and 2 drinks\n(1 if female); 3moderate, drink 5 to 7 days per week, 3 drinks for\nmales and 2 drinks for females; and 4heavy, drink 5 to 7 days per\nweek, 3 drinks for males and 2 for females. Smoking was coded\nyes/no, indicating current daily smoking. All of the above variables\nwere assessed at Wave IV, concurrent with the SBP measurement.\nIndividual and Parental Education\nEducation was coded as the highest level reported (at Wave IV for\nrespondent and Wave I for parent), as follows: 1some high school\nor less; 2graduated high school; 3some college or vocational\ntech; 4bachelor's degree; and 5some graduate school or more.\nParticipants completing General Educational Development tests\nwere grouped in the lower level of education class.20\nFinancial Strain, Home Ownership, Built Environment,\nand Household Income\nIncome, financial strain, and home ownership were assessed at Wave\nIV. Financial strain was derived from 6 questions that assessed\nwhether individuals reported the inability to pay bills, buy food, and\nso forth. A \"built environment\" measure (rated by the field inter-\nviewer) was the sum of 2 Likert-type items assessed at Wave I\nregarding how well the building in which the respondent lived was\nmaintained and the surrounding buildings were maintained. The\nsummed score had a possible range of 2 to 8, with higher scores\nreflecting poorer maintenance. Annual household income was as-\nsessed using ordered categories. To create an ordinal income\nmeasure, we assigned the midpoint value to each category, resulting\nStatistical Analysis\nSample characteristics were described as median (interquartile\nrange) for continuous variables and frequency (percentage) for\ncategorical measures. Analyses were carried out using SAS version\n9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), R software (http://cran.r-project.\norg), and Mplus.21 Statistical models were weighted using grand\nsample weights and adjusted for individual school membership. We\nfirst conducted a series of linear regression models estimating the\nindependent associations between the predictor variables and SBP,\nfirst adjusted for only age, sex, and cardiac medication, and then\nadjusted for all of the predictors under study, a \"full\" model. To\ncapture nonlinearity for several variables we used a piecewise\nregression or \"hockey stick\" approach.\nWe then estimated a path model in which the associations between\nrespondent education and household income on SBP were mediated\nby the biobehavioral variables. Significance tests were 2 sided, and\na value of P0.05 was considered \"significant.\"\nFurther details on the above assessments and statistical analy-\nses can be found in the online Data Supplement at\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the unweighted sample characteristics.

Adjusting only for\nage, sex, and cardiac medication, financial strain, built\nenvironment, alcohol intake, tobacco smoking, BMI, resting\nHR, and waist circumference were associated with SBP,\nwhereas higher respondent and parental education, owning a\nhome, being married, regular exercise, and annual household\nincome were inversely associated with SBP.\nIn the fully adjusted model, the background variables age,\nmale sex, cardiac medication use, and black race remained\nsignificantly, positively associated with SBP. Annual income\nand being married maintained their significant negative asso-\nciation with SBP, whereas moderate and heavy alcohol intake\nremained strongly associated with higher SBP. Cigarette\nsmoking also was associated with higher SBP. Strong, inde-\npendent associations were observed for BMI and waist\ncircumference (see Figure 1), with higher values correspond-\ning with higher SBP. Higher resting HR was also associated\nwith higher SBP, although the P value was 0.06.\nMediation path model results are displayed in Figure 2.\nEstimates for respondent education (top panel) and household\nincome (bottom panel) were produced from a single model\nthat included all of the variables simultaneously but are\nseparated in Figure 2 for presentational clarity. Higher levels\nof respondent education were associated with lower BMI,\nlower resting HR, less smoking, and more frequent exercise.\nHigher education level was associated with greater alcohol\nintake. The indirect effects of respondent education through\nBMI and through resting HR were statistically significant\n(see Table S2, available in the online Data Supplement at\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org). For every one category increase\nin education, there was roughly a 0.50-mm Hg decrease in\nSBP by way of BMI and a 0.20-mm Hg decrease by way of\nresting HR. In contrast, for every one level increase in\neducation, there also was a 0.13-mm Hg increase in SBP by\nway of alcohol intake. The indirect effects of education\nthrough exercise and smoking were not statistically signifi-\ncant. Waist circumference and BMI were not simultaneously\nmodeled because of their strong correlation. We, therefore,\nre-estimated the primary path model replacing BMI with the\nwaist measure. In this model, education was inversely asso-\nciated with waist circumference (unstandardized path coeffi-\nized indirect effect for education via waist was 0.64 (95%\nindirect effects of education on SBP by way of household\nincome and biobehavioral variables; these associations were\nall trivial in magnitude and not statistically significant.) The\noverall indirect effect of education across the entire set of\n0.63). Finally, after accounting for all of the indirect effects\nvia biobehavioral mediators, the direct effect of respondent\neducation on SBP was no longer statistically significant.\nCombining the direct effect with all of the indirect effects\nyielded a total effect for education on SBP of 0.59 (95%\nHigher household income was associated with lower rest-\ning HR and higher alcohol intake (see Figure 2). In contrast\nto respondent education, although the specific indirect effects\nof income by way of alcohol and resting HR were statistically\nsignificant (see bottom section of Table S2), the total indirect\neffect was not. Moreover, the direct effect was statistically\nsignificant, with each $50 000 increase associated with a\ndecrease in SBP of 0.61 mm Hg. The total effect of\n0.29) and statistically significant. As with BMI, income\nwas inversely associated with waist circumference (unstan-\n1.03). The unstandardized indirect effect of household\nincome on SBP via waist circumference was also significant\nDiscussion\nA striking number of these young adults displayed clinically\nrelevant elevations in both SBP and BMI. Among the most\nnoteworthy findings from the conventional regression model\nwas that, among the SES indices, only income and marital\nstatus remained significantly related to SBP after adjustment\nfor biobehavioral risk factors and other SES indicators. Our\nfindings regarding the mediating path from education level to\nSBP by way of BMI, resting HR, and alcohol consumption\nare consistent with those of Chaix et al.10 However, our\nBackground Variable N\nMedian or\nPercentage\nInterquartile\nRange or\nFrequency\nAnnual household income\nBuilt environment (scale\n2 to 8, best to worst)\nN represents the No. of nonmissing cases.

For example,\nfor the first set of models reported in column 2, each $50 000 increase in annual income is associated with an 0.90-mm Hg\nreduction in SBP. SBP indicates systolic blood pressure; BMI, body mass index; HR, heart rate; SES, socioeconomic status.\n\u00a7Coefficients involving BMI, waist circumference, and heart rate are from a linear piecewise (hockey stick) estimate\nin which the regression slope is allowed to bend once at an inflection point. This procedure generates 2 coefficients\nfor each variable, each coefficient representing the 2 different slope regions. For example, in column 1, the coefficient\nfor waist circumference 100 (second column) is 0.32, which is the regression slope for individuals whose waist\ncircumferences is 100 cm. The coefficient for waist circumference 100 represents the change in that slope for\nindividuals whose waist circumference is 100 cm. Above 100 cm, the slope is 0.16 less steep than the slope for\nfindings diverge from the French study in that we did not find\nthat the total effect of household income on SBP was\naccounted for by these indirect biobehavioral mediators. This\ndiscrepancy may be the result of cultural differences between\nFrench and American cultures, the younger age of our\nsample, and/or our larger sample size. In addition, the\navailability of government-sponsored healthcare in France,\nfor example, could have buffered the SBP-raising effects of\nlower household income there. Another intriguing possibility\nis that the recent economic recession resulted in loss of jobs\nand diminished household income among National Longitu-\ndinal Study of Adolescent Health participants at just about the\ntime that the Wave IV data collection was under way, thereby\npotentiating the impact of such a recent reduction in house-\nhold income on SBP. Supporting this possibility is the recent\nreport22 that there was an increase in acute myocardial\ninfarction rates during the stock market decline of October\nSBP, mmHg\nHeart Rate, beats/minute\nSBP, mmHg\nWaist Circumference, cm\nSBP, mmHg\nFigure 1.

Results were\nestimated simultaneously from the same model\nbut separated here for presentational clarity.\nBrummett et al Systolic Blood Pressure and Socioeconomic Status 165\nOur findings may have important implications for approaches\nto prevention of high blood pressure. Mediation of the low\neducation association with SBP via increased BMI and waist\ncircumference is consistent with the long-recognized importance\nof steps to decrease BMI and central obesity in any cardiopre-\nventive program. The independent effect of lower HR to mediate\nthe effects of both low education and household income on SBP\npoints to the importance of also identifying interventions that can\nreduce resting HR. One such intervention is aerobic exercise,\nwhich is also long recognized as an important cardiopreventive\nmeasure.\nFinally, the emergence of smoking, being married, and\nincreased alcohol consumption as independent correlates of SBP\npoints to the importance of smoking cessation and limiting\nalcohol consumption as potentially important preventive ap-\nproaches. The salutatory effects of marriage and social support\nin general have been widely studied, for example,23 with the\nmajority of findings being consistent with ours.\nThe cross-sectional nature of this study precludes conclu-\nsions regarding causality, and the present findings may\ngeneralize only to individuals 24 to 32 years of age. In\naddition, as with any observational study, unmeasured factors\nmay have significantly contributed to the present associa-\ntions. For example, genetic profiles could be associated with\nSES, as well as SBP.\nPerspectives\nWe have shown that indices of lower SES are associated with\nincreased SBP and that increased BMI and waist circumfer-\nence and higher resting HR are significant mediators of these\nassociations. These findings strengthen the case that lower\nSES is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and that\nincreased BMI and central obesity are important mediators of\nthis effect. Interventions that promote weight loss and reduce\nresting HR have the potential to reduce the impact of low SES\non SBP, especially among young adults, which will further\nreduce the cardiovascular health burden of the US population\nas they age into middle and older adulthood.\n"
