Via activation of\nits G protein-coupled receptors, LPA exerts\na range of effects on the cardiovascular\nsystem including modulation of platelet\nactivation, recruitment and activation of\ninflammatory cells, and migration, pheno-\ntypic modulation and proliferation of vas-\ncular smooth muscle cells.1\u00ad5 It is therefore\ncritically involved in thrombosis and vascu-\nlar diseases such as atherosclerosis and\nvascular remodelling.\nLysophosphatidic acid accumulates in\nthe lipid-rich core of carotid atherosclerotic\nplaque6 and is released during plaque rup-\nture, when it activates platelets and can lead\nto intra-arterial thrombus formation.7\nTypically, LPA is present in very small\namounts in human plasma and tissues, and\nis released under pathological conditions\nsuch as injury and thrombosis.8 Tissue\nremodelling processes within plaque,\nmainly regulated by matrix metalloprotei-\nnases (MMPs), also play a major role in the\npathophysiology of atherosclerosis. MMP-\n9, a member of the MMP superfamily, is\nimplicated in the pathophysiology of plaque\nrupture, which is the most common mech-\nanism responsible for acute ischaemic car-\ndiac disease and cerebral stroke.9 MMP-9 is\nalso associated with atherosclerotic arterial\nremodelling10 and is actively synthesized in\nvulnerable plaques.11 Elevated plasma levels\nof MMP-9 in the peripheral blood have been\ndemonstrated in patients with acute coron-\nary syndrome (ACS)12 and are associated\nwith severe coronary stenosis13 and cardio-\nvascular mortality.14 Elevated plasma\nMMP-9 concentrations in the coronary cir-\nculation of patients with ACS indicate that\nMMP-9 production may be enhanced in\nthese patients.15,16 Investigation of the rela-\ntionship between LPA, MMP-9, and carotid\natheromatous plaque stability in patients\nwith cerebral infarction is far from ade-\nquate, however.\nThe aim of the present study was to\ndetermine the relationship between plasma\nLPA and MMP-9, and carotid atheroma-\ntous plaque stability in patients with\ncerebral infarction, and to explore its sig-\nnificance in the evaluation of vulnerable\ncarotid plaque.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study recruited patients diagnosed with\ncerebral infarction in the arteriae carotis\ninterna system who were admitted to the\nDepartment of Neurology, Tianyou\nHospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of\nScience and Technology, Wuhan, China,\nDiagnoses were made according to criteria\nestablished during the Fourth Chinese\nNational Cerebrovascular Disease\nteria were: cancer; surgery or major trauma\nin the previous month; obvious signs or\nclinical evidence of hospital-acquired infec-\ntion. Full clinical history and neurological\nexamination were performed for each\npatient.\nThe Ethics Committee of Tianyou\nHospital approved the study, and all\npatients provided written informed consent.\nCarotid artery duplex ultrasonography\nCarotid artery duplex ultrasonography\nexamination was performed with an ATL\nAndover, MA, USA). With the patient\nlying in a supine position, the extracranial\ncarotid arteries were imaged in the longitu-\ndinal (anterior, lateral and posterior views)\nand transverse planes. Both common car-\notid arteries, carotid bifurcations and\ninternal carotid arteries were examined for\nthe presence of atherosclerotic plaque.\nWhen plaque was visualized, the image of\nthe thickest plaque was frozen and the\nintima\u00admedia wall thickness (IMT, includ-\ning the plaque) was measured with an elec-\ntronic cursor and recorded as the maximal\ncarotid plaque thickness. IMT > 1.2 mm was\ndefined as carotid plaque, and IMT\n!0.8 mm\u00ad 1.2 mm was defined as thickened\nintima. Carotid plaque was divided into four\ntypes: flat, hard, soft and mixed, according\nto the ultrasound audiovisual pathology\nclassification of plaque.18 Flat and hard\ntypes are stable, while soft and mixed types\nare vulnerable.\nTranscranial Doppler monitoring\nAll patients were monitored with transcra-\nnial Doppler (TCD) for 1 h preoperatively, 3\ndays after onset of stroke. Continuous TCD\nmonitoring of the bilateral middle cerebral\nTCD unit (Nicolet Biomedical, Madison,\nWI, USA). Signals were recorded on digital\naudiotape for offline analysis and interpret-\nation of embolic signals as described.19\nPatients were classified as microembolic\nsignal-positive or microembolic signal-\nnegative.\nLPA and MMP-9 quantification\nPeripheral blood (10 ml) was collected from\neach patient within 24 h after TCD moni-\ntoring for quantification of plasma LPA and\nMMP-9. For MMP-9, blood was immedi-\nately mixed with sodium ethylenediamene\ntetra-acetic acid (EDTA,) centrifuged at\nseparated, and stored at \u00c080C until use.\nMMP-9 was quantified using one-step sand-\nwich enzyme immunoassay (Santa\nCruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA,\nUSA), according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions.\nFor LPA, blood was collected in tubes\ncontaining EDTA, and plasma was collected\nand either processed immediately or stored\nat \u00c070C until lipid extraction. LPA was\nquantified by colorimetric assay of platelet-\npoor plasma as described,20 following lipid\nextraction at 0C to 4C to minimize\ndamage to ester bonds.21\nVascular risk factors\nStudy definitions were: smoking, current or\nprevious tobacco use; hypertension, high\nblood pressure requiring treatment; dia-\nbetes, insulin- or noninsulin-dependent dia-\nbetes requiring treatment (including dietary\ncontrol); hyperlipidaemia, current treat-\nment and/or fasting lipid concentrations\n(total cholesterol ! 6.2 mmol/l or triglycer-\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SEM.\nBetween group differences in LPA\nand MMP-9 were analysed using Student's\nt-test for pairwise comparisons and one-way\nanalysis of variance for multiple compari-\nsons. Between-group comparisons of the\nincidence of microembolic-positivity were\nmade using 2-test. Pearson correlation\ncoefficient was used to analyse the relation-\nship between LPA and MMP-9 concentra-\ntions. P-values <0.05 were considered\nstatistically significant. All statistical ana-\nlyses were performed with SPSS\u00d5 version\n19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nResults\nrange 47\u00ad78 years). When stratified accord-\ning to carotid artery duplex ultrasonography\nfindings, 12 patients had no plaque, 16 had\nthickened intima, 21 had unstable plaque\nand 41 had stable plaque. There were no\nstatistically significant between-group differ-\nences in demographic characteristics or vas-\ncular risk factors (smoking, hypertension,\ndiabetes and hyperlipidaemia; Table 1).\nData regarding MMP-9 and LPA con-\ncentrations and the presence of microemboli\nin patients stratified according to plaque\nfindings are shown in Table 2. LPA and\nMMP-9 concentrations were significantly\nhigher, and microemboli-positivity was sig-\nnificantly more common, in patients with\nunstable plaque than the three other groups\nfor emboli; Table 2). LPA and MMP-9\nconcentrations were significantly lower in\nthe no-plaque group than in all other groups\n(P < 0.05 for each comparison; Table 2). In\naddition, LPA concentrations were signifi-\ncantly higher in the thickened intima group\nthan the stable plaque group (P < 0.01;\nTable 2). There was a significant positive\ncorrelation between LPA and MMP-9 con-\ncentrations in the study population as a\nTable 1.

The zinc-dependent endopeptidase\nMMP-9 is synthesized and secreted in\nmonomeric form as a zymogen,24 is asso-\nciated with atherosclerotic arterial remodel-\nling,10 and is actively synthesized in\nvulnerable plaque.11 MMP-9 affects plaque\nFigure 1.

The LPA-induced migration of T\ncells and MMP secretion that occurs in\natheromatous plaque can accelerate cap\ndegradation and eventually lead to plaque\nrupture.29 In addition, LPA can increase\nplaque instability by upregulating the expres-\nsion of proinflammatory cytokines and adhe-\nsion molecules, promoting inflammatory cell\nmigration and infiltration, and inhibiting\napoptosis of macrophages and T lympho-\ncytes.29 Plaque infiltrated by a large number\nof inflammatory cells has been shown to have\na high positive rate of microemboli, and\ncould lead to cerebral infarction.30 Others\nhave demonstrated a significant positive\ncorrelation between plaque MMP-9 concen-\ntrations and TCD findings.31\nLevels of LPA in human atheromatous\nplaques have been shown to be 13-fold\nhigher than in normal arterial tissue, with\nthe highest LPA concentrations present in\nthe lipid-rich core.3 LPA was found to be the\nprimary platelet-activating lipid in athero-\nsclerotic plaques, with other lipid fractions\nhaving comparatively minor biological\nactivity.3 Intravascular ultrasound assess-\nment of the culprit lesion in patients pre-\nsenting with acute myocardial infarction or\nunstable angina found MMP-9 to be an\nindependent predictor of plaque rupture,\neven after adjustment for the traditional risk\nfactors C-reactive protein and troponin.32 In\npatients with acute coronary syndrome,\nhigher in those with plaque rupture com-\npared with those without, supporting the\nassociation between plasma MMP-9 and\nplaque rupture.32 Concentrations of LPA\nand MMP-9 in the plasma of patients with\ncerebral infarction in the present study were\nsignificantly higher in those with unstable\nplaque than in those with no plaque,\nthickened intima or stable plaque. In add-\nition, the present finding that plasma LPA\nand MMP-9 concentrations were signifi-\ncantly higher in patients with evidence of\nmicroemboli than in those without micro-\nemboli suggests that LPA and MMP-9 are\nclosely related to the formation and disrup-\ntion of unstable plaque. It is possible that\nthe high concentration of LPA present in the\nlipid core of atherosclerotic plaque was\nexposed following cap rupture, resulting in\nlocal embolus formation. This may manifest\nas transient ischaemic symptoms or clinical\nacute cerebral infarction. Local embolus\nafter plaque rupture may then produce\nadditional LPA, forming a positive\nfeedback loop.\nTable 3.

In addition, plasma LPA levels\nmay be influenced by certain medicines,\nsuch as aspirin. Also, plaque stability was\nonly determined by the ultrasound audio-\nvisual pathology classification; further\npathological examination of plaque sec-\ntions would have provided importatnt\ninformation. In conclusion, plasma LPA\nand MMP-9 concentrations may be useful\nbiomarkers in the clinical identification and\nprediction of unstable plaque and in guid-\ning treatment.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by a grant from the\nScientific Research Project of Hubei Provincial\nDepartment of Education, China (No.\nReferences\n1.
