This\nmeans that older displaced workers must rely pri-\nmarily upon themselves and their households in\nadapting to the loss of employment. While many\ndisplaced workers will be reemployed quickly, prior\nresearch indicates that even those workers will\nexperience long-term losses in their earnings.\nMoreover, there is reason to believe that the earn-\nings losses associated with displacement will be\nlarger for older workers. Older workers typically\nhave more seniority, and if they leave a job where\n'Many thanks to Peter Barth for useful suggestions regarding this\nmanuscript.

The loss of\nhealth care and other employer provided benefits\nmight also expose older workers to more financial\nrisk than a younger worker due to the association of\naging with the onset of physical problems.\nAnother concern for older workers who are dis-\nplaced prior to normal retirement ages is how this\nwill affect their accumulation of assets for retire-\nment. If a displaced worker has difficulty being\nreemployed at their prior level of earnings, planned\nsaving for retirement may not occur and the worker\nmay be forced to consume assets which had initially\nbeen accumulated for retirement.\nHowever, the higher rates of nonemployment\namong older workers following displacement may\nreflect something other than economic hardship.\nDisplaced workers could be receiving private pen-\nsion income, and this may explain why many exit\nthe labor force. Although private pension eligibility\nand receipt will be examined here, previous research\nsuggests that relatively few of the individuals who\nqualify for private pensions would elect to receive\nthem at these ages (Burkhauser, Couch, & Phillips,\nMost of the prior research regarding displaced\nworkers has used the Displaced Workers' Surveys\n(DWS), a supplement to the January Current Popula-\ntion Survey (CPS) at two year intervals since 1984.\nUsing those data, it is common to define displace-\nment as the loss of a job in which the worker had\nbeen employed for at least three years due to plant\nclosure or layoff. Those data provide sufficient sam-\nples to examine the average displaced worker, but\nthe sample sizes available for examining specific age\ngroups, as will be done here, are prohibitively small.\nAs an alternative, data from the first wave of the\nHealth and Retirement Study (HRS) allow individu-\nals who have lost jobs due to plant closure or layoff\nto be identified. Because of the emphasis of the\nthe number of observations available is larger than\nwould be the case if the DWS were used (see\nAppendix, Note 1). Also, the HRS was designed to\nobtain measures which are more important for\nolder workers such as their household's net worth.\nBecause the HRS data provide a larger sample size\nand more information than the DWS for older\nworkers, they are used here.\nTo place the experiences of older Americans and\ntheir families following job displacement in context,\na brief review of the existing literature will be pro-\nvided. Then, the data will be described followed\nby a discussion of a series of tables regarding the in-\ncidence of job displacement and its impacts. Among\nthe topics discussed will be the incidence of job\ndisplacement and its correlates, the reemployment\nexperiences of displaced workers, the losses in\nearnings that occur for the individual and their\nhousehold, the availability and use of pensions as\na substitute for earned income, changes in health\ninsurance coverage, and differences in the net\nworths of the households of displaced workers rela-\ntive to others.\nPrior Literature\nThe literature regarding job displacement and its\nsubsequent impacts has grown substantially since\nthe early 1980s. The major findings of that literature\nwill be discussed here. More detail may be found in\na recent survey (Fallick, 1996). Two topics have dom-\ninated the literature which examines job displace-\nment. First, what is the incidence of job displace-\nment and has it changed over time? Second, how\nare employment and earnings affected by job dis-\nplacement?\nAs each DWS has been released, papers have\nbeen published which document the incidence of\njob displacement in the current survey and contrast\nit with findings from prior surveys (Flaim & Sehgal,\nFrom these as well as integrative studies by Farber\nfrom several of the DWS, a picture emerges of the\nincidence of job displacement and its evolution\nThroughout the period covered by the DWS, the\noverall rate of displacement has not increased (Far-\ndisplaced, however, has changed.

In\nthe most recent survey, the rate of displacement\namong all workers is actually lower than among\nAnother compositional change has occurred\nall displaced workers had lost manufacturing jobs.\"\nThis decline was mirrored in a reduction of the con-\ncentration of displacement among blue collar work-\ners during the same period.\nThese studies have also detailed the proportion\nof the affected workers who are reemployed, unem-\nployed, or exit the labor force following displace-\nment. Horvath (1987) reports that among workers\nwho had 3 years of tenure prior to displacement\nand who had lost their job in the preceding two\nLower rates of reemployment among relatively older\nworkers are common in all of the studies based on\nthe DWS.\nThese descriptive studies also document the de-\ncline in earnings which is experienced by a typical\ndisplaced worker.

Gardner\n(1995) examines the change in median weekly earn-\n8%. One weakness of these studies is that they only\nprovide these calculations for those who are reem-\nployed and possibly understate the impact of dis-\nplacement on earnings.\nA set of studies which use a multivariate approach\nhave also examined the impact of displacement on\nsubsequent employment and earnings. Rather than\ndescribing the incidence of job displacement per se,\nthese studies focus on identifying covariates associ-\nated with either reemployment or earnings changes.\nTwo studies have examined what factors are asso-\nciated with cross group or industry differences in\nreemployment shortly after displacement (Farber,\nFarber (1993) considers job losses which have\noccurred in the previous two years among workers\nwith at least three years of job tenure. He reports\nthat women, minorities, and older workers (ages 55\nto 64) are less likely to be reemployed using the\nDWS data. This examination, however, contrasts\nrates of reemployment across the population of dis-\nplaced workers. In contrast, Ruhm (1991a) uses data\nfrom the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)\nand compares the experiences of displaced workers\nto a control group of similar individuals at risk of\ndisplacement. Ruhm (1991a) concludes that dis-\nplacement does \"not have particularly adverse im-\npacts on the employment levels of non-Whites, blue\ncollar occupations, or long tenure workers\" (p. 521).\nHe argues that once a control group is used, many of\nthe cross-group differences in post-displacement\nreemployment observed in studies which do not\nuse a similar methodology become statistically in-\nsignificant.\nRuhm (1991b) also examined the long-term reem-\nThe Gerontologist\nployment prospects of displaced workers. Ruhm\nplacement, job losers are out of work only one\nweek more than their nondisplaced counterparts.\"\nThus, while all groups are adversely impacted by\njob displacement in the short run, displaced work-\ners are employed at rates similar to those who were\nnever displaced within several years.\nThe multivariate analyses which have focused on\nthe earnings losses associated with job displace-\nment examine both the gross loss as well as how\nmuch of it may be attributed to factors such as age,\ngeneral experience, specific experience, and transi-\ntions across industries following displacement (Car-\nthe earnings losses are only temporary or are per-\nmanent in nature.\nThe average earnings loss reported by these stud-\nearnings loss is found by Ruhm (1991b) who exam-\nines their size four years after displacement. Earn-\nings losses appear to be greatest immediately fol-\nlowing displacement, are moderated over time, but\ndo not disappear. As with the descriptive studies,\nthe calculations described here only include reem-\nployed workers so they potentially underestimate\nthe impact of displacement on earnings.\nStudies which have decomposed the gross earn-\nings loss have often focused on whether specific\nindustry skills and total years of experience are\nrewarded following job displacement (Carrington,\nearnings are closely related to industry specific\nskills, reemployment in the same industry following\ndisplacement should be related to higher earnings.\nThese studies support the view that individuals\ndevelop industry specific skills which are not easily\ntransportable to new employers following job dis-\nreport that those who switch industries following\ndisplacement have the largest earnings losses. Klet-\nzer (1989) concludes that the importance of industry\nspecific skills varies across industries since blue col-\nlar workers experience earnings reductions related\nto seniority which are larger than those observed\namong white collar workers.\nMost of these studies do not examine differences\nin experiences across race, gender, or age partitions\nof the sample (see Appendix, Note 2). Where con-\ntrols for age, gender, and ethnicity are included,\nmost report that they are not significantly related to\nthe observed earnings losses once tenure and edu-\ncation are controlled. The only exceptions are in the\nresearch of Farber who finds that age is associated\nwith reduced post displacement earnings and Ong\nand Mar who report that age, being Hispanic, and\nbeing female are each associated with lower post-\ndisplacement earnings.\nOne study explicitly examines whether minorities\nand women have higher or lower earnings losses\nthan Whites. Madden (1988) concludes that follow-\ning displacement, minority men experience larger\nearnings losses than White men but that the earn-\nings losses are larger for White women than Black\nwomen. She suggests that when other researchers\npool minority men and women together, they do\nnot find these differential impacts due to aggrega-\ntion bias. She also reports that age is associated\nwith larger earnings losses.\nData\nBefore proceeding to the examination of job dis-\nplacement among older workers, it is important to\ndescribe the basic sample which will be used\nthroughout the paper. The HRS contains information\n61 would be most likely to alter their behavior in\nresponse to the availability of social security retire-\nment benefits at age 62 so they are excluded from\nthis study. This reduces the sample size to 8,963.\nIn order to calculate rates of displacement, the\ngroup of individuals at risk of displacement must be\nidentified from this age-eligible population. Persons\nat risk of displacement are defined to be those who\nwere employed in 1989 and had been with the same\nemployer for at least five years. 4,282 of the observa-\ntions in the HRS on individuals ages 51 through 60\nmeet this standard for being at risk of displacement.\nFrom the group of individuals who are at risk of\ndisplacement, those who are displaced must be\nselected. To be displaced, a person must report\nleast five years of prior tenure. This window of two\nyears duplicates the two year retrospective window\nwhich has been used in much of the prior descrip-\ntive research based on the Displaced Worker Sur-\nThe method of determining whether a person\nwas displaced depends on whether they were\nemployed at the date of their 1992 HRS interview. If\na person was employed, an examination of their job\nhistory was conducted to determine if they had\nor layoff in which they had at least five years of\ntenure prior to 1990. If so, they were counted as a\ndisplaced worker.\nIf a person was unemployed, the record of their\nmost recent employment was examined. If that job\nlayoff and they had at least five years of tenure in\nthe position prior to 1990, the person was counted\nas a displaced worker. If a person was unemployed,\ntheir job history was also examined. If they had\nor layoff in which they had at least five years of\ntenure prior to 1990, they were counted as dis-\nplaced. In total, 204 age-eligible individuals were\nfound to be displaced from the 4,282 at risk. The\ndefinition adopted in the paper of a permanent job\nas one which lasts more than five years is necessi-\ntated by the data since jobs must have a minimum\nduration of five years to be recorded in the employ-\nment history section of the survey. For prior jobs, a\nvariety of detail regarding compensation and the\ntype of occupation is available.\nDisplacement and Its Effects\nThe importance of job displacement as both a\nsocial and economic phenomenon depends upon\nhow often it occurs. Table 1 shows the population\nof individuals ages 51 through 60 in the United\nStates at the date of the 1992 HRS. Of the total pop-\nulation of more than 21 million, 10.4 million, or about\nhalf, were at risk of displacement; i.e., they had held\na job for at least five years prior to 1990. Of those at\nrisk of displacement, 492 thousand were displaced\ntable, 4.7% of this age group was displaced (see Ap-\npendix, Note 3).\nThis estimate is made over a window of two years\nble to those from the DWS which have used a two\nyear window. During the period from 1991 through\nyears of predisplacement tenure. This compares well\nwith the displacement rate of 4.7% in Table 1 for\nworkers ages 50 through 60 with five years of pre-\ndisplacement tenure.\nBeyond the total rate of displacement, the final\ncolumn of Table 1 allows for comparisons across\ngroups and for tests of differences in their rates of\ndisplacement. For example, across the aggregate\ngroupings of men and women, the proportions dis-\nplaced are equal, .047. Similarly, no clear pattern is\nevident in the displacement rates across individual\nages in Table 1. There are also no statistically signifi-\ncant patterns across the larger age groupings pro-\nvided in the table for women, Whites, and non-\nWhites. Males, however, appear more likely to be\n60. Also, the displacement rate among non-Whites\nstandard errors provided, this racial difference is\nsignificant at the 5% level (see Appendix, Note 4).\nPrior research has established that higher levels\nof education and seniority reduce the likelihood of\nlayoff. Table 2 shows the average education and job\ntenure in 1990 of the group of workers at risk of dis-\nplacement and of those who were later displaced.\nAverage education does not vary significantly\nacross workers at risk of displacement relative to\nthose who were displaced for any of the demo-\ngraphic breakdowns provided in the table except\nTable 1.'

There are, however, significant cross-\ngroup differences in education if one looks down\nthe columns of the table to consider either the\ngroup of at-risk workers or those displaced. At-risk\nWhite workers on average had 13.1 years of educa-\ntion while minorities had only 11.8. Displaced White\nworkers had 13.3 years of education on average rel-\native to 10.7 years for non-Whites. The difference in\neducation across the White and minority groups for\nat-risk workers suggests that minorities should be at\na higher risk for job displacement. Among minori-\nties, it also appears that the less educated have a\ngreater chance of displacement.\nhigher for the at-risk group relative to those who\nare later displaced. Considering the demographic\ngroups in Table 2, males, Whites, and non-Whites\nwho are displaced appear to have significantly\nlower job tenure than the at-risk group. No signifi-\ncant difference in predisplacement tenure is seen\nacross displaced and at-risk women workers.\nAgain, if the groups of at-risk and displaced work-\ners contained in the individual columns are consid-\nered, significant differences in tenure are observed\nby race and gender. Men have significantly more\ntenure than women and Whites more than non-\nWhites. Although there is no difference in the dis-\nplacement rates of men and women, the lower job\ntenure of non-Whites appears to explain, in part,\ntheir higher rates of displacement.\nIn the early 1980s, displacement was strongly\ninfluenced by the industry of employment and type\nof occupation in addition to personal characteris-\ntics. Although recent evidence indicates those pat-\nterns have moderated among all workers, older\nworkers may nonetheless be concentrated in de-\nclining industries. Table 3 examines the extent to\nwhich job displacement is concentrated among\nblue and white collar occupations as well as major\nindustrial groupings for older workers.\nUpon examination, Table 3 indicates that the pro-\nportions of blue and white collar workers who are\ntries, manufacturing accounts for 22% of the em-\nployment of the at-risk group of workers and a\nslightly more than proportional amount of the job\ndisplacement observed, 25%. The components of\nservice employment (transportation, government,\nwholesale and retail trade, finance, insurance, real\nestate, and services) employ 67% of the at-risk\ngroup of workers and account for a roughly propor-\ntional 63% of the observed displacement.\nThe incidence of displacement is roughly equal\nacross occupations and industries. The primary vari-\nations observed in the rate of displacement appear\nto be associated with the lower education and job\ntenure of minorities. One wonders how successful\ndisplaced workers, and minorities in particular, will\nbe in finding new employment.\nTable 4 considers the labor force status of work-\n1992 HRS interview. The columns of the table show\nhow many workers were initially displaced, what\nproportion had paid employment at the date of sur-\nvey, what proportion were unemployed, and what\nproportion were out of the labor force. Among all\ndisplaced workers in the preceding two years, 73%\nwere reemployed at the date of survey, 18% were\nunemployed, and 10% had left the labor force (see\nAppendix, Note 5).\nAcross the demographic breakdowns by gender\nand race, significantly mor? women exit the labor\nTable 3.'

Thus, the group\nwith the lowest education and prior job tenure has\nthe lowest subsequent rate of reemployment and\nthe greatest proportion exiting the labor market.\nIt should also be noted that within each of the\ndemographic groups considered, more of the older\nTable 4.'

Table entries in\nthe last three columns are in the form: mean (standard error).\nworkers in the cohort (56-60) exit the labor force\nthan among younger workers (51-55). This pattern is\nnot statistically significant but is relevant to the later\ndiscussion of pension eligibility and receipt.\nThe rates of reemployment observed here are\nhigher for this age cohort than those found in the\nDWS. This is most likely because the survey date of\nthe DWS is January of the year of interview. Some\nprovides a longer time frame within which dis-\nplaced workers could subsequently become reem-\nployed. This would be expected to raise the propor-\ntion of displaced workers observed reemployed in\nthe HRS relative to the DWS as seen here.\nBeyond unemployment, the most obvious disrup-\ntion following displacement is the loss of earned\nincome. Since about one quarter of those displaced\nare not reemployed by the date of the survey, one\nwould expect a fairly sizable loss in earned income\non average. Also, given the relatively bad experi-\nences of non-Whites, they might also be expected\nto suffer somewhat larger losses in earnings on\naverage.\nIn the 1992 HRS, information on earnings is col-\nlected for the 1991 calendar year. This creates a\nproblem in making before and after earnings com-\nparisons because workers displaced in 1991 would\nreport earnings at the time of leaving their perma-\nnent job and those same earnings would be re-\nported as part of their total earnings in 1991. In\norder to make a pure comparison of earnings on\nprior jobs relative to earnings in 1991, the figures\npresented in Table 5 are calculated only for those\nindividuals displaced in 1990. The comparison being\nmade is between annualized earnings at the point\nof leaving a permanent job in 1990 to annual earned\nincome in 1991. Ninety-four observations are used\nin these calculations. The calculation for displaced\nand reemployed non-Whites uses 15 observations.\nAll of the other elements of the table are based on\nat least 25 observations (see Appendix, Note 6).\nTable 5 contains information on the average earn-\nings of all current workers relative to two groups of\nTable 5.* Mean Earnings By Age, Gender, Race, and Displacement Status Among Individuals Ages 51 Through 60\nTotal\nAge\nGender\nMale\nFemale\nRace\nWhite\nNon-White\nAll Current\nWorkers\nCurrent Job\nAll Displaced Workers\nPrior Job\nCalendar Year\nDisplaced and\nReemployed Workers\nPrior Job\nCurrent Job\n\"Based on author's calculations from 1992 HRS.

The average\ndisplaced worker experiences a decline in their\nworker who is displaced and reemployed, earnings\nworker earns $32,310 in their prior job, this provides\na rough estimate of the expected earnings loss for\nthose who are not reemployed.\nConsidering all displaced workers, women have\nsignificantly lower earnings than men and minori-\nties have significantly lower earnings than Whites\nfollowing displacement. What is to be made of this\nis unclear. Similar differences existed prior to dis-\nplacement. Displacement appears to substantially\nreduce the earnings of all groups. Racial and gender\npay differentials observed before displacement are\nmaintained afterwards.\nSimilar figures are provided in the table for those\nworkers who are reemployed. When the unemployed\nworkers are dropped from the calculations, the cur-\nrent earnings of White and non-White workers are\nonly $2,500 apart. The gap between male and female\nearnings, however, widens. The negative impact of\ndisplacement on the earnings of minorities appears\nto be associated with their relatively low likelihood\nof subsequent employment. For women, the nega-\ntive impact appears to be related to low earnings in\ntheir new jobs.\nOne way that older displaced workers might be\nable to supplement their earnings is by electing to\nreceive private pension income if they qualify.\nThose who have more generous pensions might\nalso be expected to exit the labor force and retire\nearly. This, in part, could explain some of the move-\nment out of the labor force observed in Table 4 (see\nAppendix, Note 7).\nTable 6 provides information on current pension\neligibility for at risk and displaced workers at the\ndate of the 1992 HRS. As can be seen in the first row\nof columns 1 and 2 of the table, of all workers at\nrisk, 60% were qualified to receive a private pension\nif they elected relative to 37% of those displaced. If\nthose exiting the labor force are being influenced\nby the availability of private pension income, they\nmust first be qualified for receipt. As a group, those\nwho left the labor force were least likely to qualify\nfor a private pension.\nTable 7 investigates how many of the eligible\nworkers elected to take the pension income. As can\nbe seen in that table, the rates of pension receipt\nare basically identical across workers at risk of dis-\nplacement, all displaced workers, displaced and\nreeemployed workers, and displaced and unem-\nployed workers. Those who were displaced and are\nout of the labor force take pension income at more\nthan twice the rate of these other groups, but the\nrate itself is only 18%. None of the displaced women\nwho were not reemployed were receiving pension\nincome. The same can be said of older non-Whites.\nOn the other hand, more than half of all males out\nof the labor force are receiving pension income.\nTable 7 also shows the average amount of pen-\nsion income for each of the five groups considered\n(see Appendix, Note 8). Conditional on receipt, the\naverage displaced worker receives $8,545 in pension\nincome. This amount does not vary dramatically\nwhether the worker is reemployed or not. Relative\nto the average earnings loss for a displaced worker\nwho is reemployed ($10,312), an early pension ben-\nefit would replace most of the lost income. How-\never, for a worker who was displaced and not reem-\nployed, the average amount of pension income\nwould probably replace a relatively small fraction of\ntheir prior earnings. Considering the average dis-\nplaced worker's earnings on the prior job of $32,310,\nTable 6.'

The highest\nrate of exit from the labor force was for the older\ngroup of non-Whites. Table 7 shows that this older\ngroup (56-60) is not more likely to receive pension\nincome and that none of the older minority displaced\nworkers are electing to receive pension income.\nBased on this evidence, the receipt of private\npension income does not appear to be a sizable\ninfluence on decisions to exit the labor force except\nfor males. The low rates of pension receipt among\nwomen and minorities and the modest amounts of\nincome involved are inconsistent with the high\nrates at which they exit the labor force.\nAlthough personal earnings fall significantly and\nare not offset to a great degree by the receipt of\npension income, the overall impact of displacement\nshould be offset to some extent by income received\nby other members of the household. Table 8 exam-\nines the average incomes of households which con-\ntain current workers, all workers displaced in 1990,\nand those displaced in 1990 and reemployed (see\nAppendix, Note 9). The figures presented are for\ntotal household income from all sources. The aver-\nage household income for current workers in 1991\nlower. The difference is somewhat smaller for\nhouseholds where the displaced worker was reem-\nployed, $11,000. These comparisons suggest that the\ntypical household that contains a displaced worker\nexperiences a sizable (24%) loss in income.\nTable 8/ Total Household Income in 1991 By Age, Gender, Race,\nand Displacement Status Among Individuals Ages 51 Through 60\nTotal\nAge\nGender\nMale\nFemale\nRace\nWhite\nNon-White\nAll Current\nWorkers\nAll Displaced\nWorkers\nDisplaced and\nReemployed\nWorkers\n\"Based on author's calculations from 1992 HRS.

Attributing these differen-\ntials to displacement would be inappropriate.\nAnother area where family members may be of\nassistance is in the replacement of health care cov-\nerage. Table 9 examines rates of health care cover-\nage among all workers in the 1992 HRS both from\nthe worker's own employer as well as from cover-\nage through their spouse.\nAmong all workers, the rate of coverage is 54%\nfrom their own employer relative to 80% from their\nown employer or their spouse's. Prior to displace-\nment, rates of health insurance coverage from one's\nown employer are not significantly different be-\ntween Whites and non-Whites although women\nappear to be less likely to have their own coverage\nthan men. Minorities are less likely to have spousal\ncoverage than Whites.\nFor displaced workers, the rate of health insurance\ncoverage from their own employer is 32%. The group\nwith the lowest rate of coverage is non-Whites at\n26%. Considering coverage from their own em-\nployer or their spouse, 59% of displaced workers\nhave health insurance, 21% points less than for all\nworkers. Minority workers also have the lowest rate\nof coverage including spousal policies, 38%.\nGiven the drop in personal and household in-\ncomes associated with job displacement and the\nneed of households to replace other nonwage ben-\nefits such as health insurance, households of dis-\nplaced workers would be expected to slow down\ntheir rate of asset accumulation towards retirement\nand to perhaps begin spending down assets in\norder to maintain their lifestyles.

Also,\nsince these are ex post comparisons, it should be\nborne in mind that an implicit assumption is that\nhouseholds containing displaced workers had simi-\nlar assets to those which do not prior to displace-\nment. Nonetheless, Table 10 shows that the average\nminority household is not in as strong a financial\nposition to deal with the impacts of displacement as\nthe average White household.\nConclusion\nIn many respects, the evidence regarding the inci-\ndence of job displacement and its economic impacts\nupon older workers provided in this article mirror\nthe findings of the broader literature on job dis-\nplacement. Job displacement appears to be spread\nproportionately across occupations and industries.\nPrior job tenure and education both appear to play a\nrole in determining who is displaced.\nFollowing displacement, the average loss in earn-\nings for displaced and reemployed workers (30%)\nlies at the upper end of the range of equivalent esti-\nmates reported by prior studies (10 to 25%) as\nwould be expected given the greater seniority of\nthe age cohort examined. When displaced workers\nwho are not reemployed are included, the esti-\nmated loss in earnings rises to 39%. At the time of\nsurvey for the 1992 HRS, a sizable fraction of those\n(27%), and this suggests that studies which exclude\nthese individuals when measuring the impact of job\ndisplacement understate its effects. There is also lit-\ntle evidence that the 10% of the sample who leaves\nthe labor force after being displaced are replacing\nlost earnings through pension income as only 13%\nof them qualify for private pensions and, of that\ngroup, about one fifth take the benefit.\nAlthough the typical displaced worker experi-\nences a sizable loss in personal earnings, their fam-\nily circumstances appear to buffer the decline in\ntheir economic well-being. Labor earnings for the\ntypical displaced worker decline by 39%, while their\ntotal family income appears to decline by about\n24%. Families also play an important role in increas-\ning the availability of health insurance to displaced\nworkers as they do for nondisplaced workers; 27%\nof displaced workers obtain their health insurance\nthrough their spouse.\nWhile the decline in earnings of the individual is\ntypically buffered by other sources of income in the\nhousehold, an average reduction of 24% is still\nquite large. The study offers some evidence that\nasset accumulation among the families of displaced\nworkers is impacted heavily by this loss of income.\nThis topic merits further research.\nThese large reductions in personal and family\nincome and the resulting effects on assets are trou-\nbling and may have important implications for the\npost retirement well being of all displaced workers.\nAn additional concern is the apparent pattern ex-\nhibited throughout the analysis of disproportionate\nhardship experienced by the non-White members\nof the sample. Relative to Whites, the non-White\ngroup experiences a greater incidence of displace-\nment, a lower probability of reemployment, lower\npersonal earnings, lower household incomes, and\nlower rates of health insurance following displace-\nment. It is also apparent that the non-White families\nhave less asset holdings to serve as a buffer until\nsocial security income becomes available. While\nthese patterns are explained in part by lower educa-\ntion and job tenure, minorities, as a group, are none-\ntheless worse off in every dimension examined fol-\nlowing displacement. Examining the impact of\ndisplacement across these groups following retire-\nment will be the subject of future research.\nReferences\nBurkhauser, R. V., Couch, K. A., & Phillips, J. W. (1996).

If displaced at age 61, they would be most\nlikely to forego a job search and wait to collect social\nsecurity benefits. Due to their close proximity to\nsocial security eligibility, they are not included in the\nstudy.\n2. It should be recognized that the measures included\nfor tenure and work experience are highly collinear\nwith age. This explains the omission of that variable.\nThe studies all find that workers with greater tenure\nprior to displacement suffer larger earnings losses.\nThis is similar to saying that older workers would be\nexpected to have larger earnings losses.\n3. When the numbers in the tables are reported as pro-\nportions, I will refer to them at times as rates or per-\ncentages and accordingly multiply them by 100.\n4. The formula for making these comparisons assuming\nindependence of the table elements is the difference\nin two table elements divided by the square root of\nthe sum of their squared standard errors. For the\nremainder of the article, significance will refer to the\n5. The totals and proportions do not sum exactly be-\ncause labor force status could not be assigned to\nthree observations. Thus, the total is slightly larger\nthan the sum of the components.\n6. This sample of workers displaced in 1990 is also used\nin the comparisons of total household income found\nin Table 8. The sample sizes described here for Table\n5 are the same as those used in Table 8.\n7. Other possibilities considered were receipt of Sur-\nvivors and Disability benefits as well as lump sum\nseverance payments. Less than 2% of the sample of\n16 The Gerontologist\ndisplaced workers received any of these types of pay-\nments. Coresidence with children and cash transfers\nwere also considered as a family response. Again, less\nthan 2% of the sample of displaced workers resided\nwith a child or received a cash transfer.\n8. These calculations are not provided at a more disag-\ngregated level because the low takeup rate for pen-\nsion benefits leaves few positive observations.\n9. The subgroup of workers displaced in 1990 which is\nconsidered here is the same as was used in the calcu-\nlation of individual earnings contained in Table 5. By\nconsidering only those workers displaced in 1990,\ntheir total household incomes in 1991 can be assured\nnot to reflect any earnings from the job from which\nthey were displaced. A description of the underlying\nnumber of observations available is provided in the\ntext with the discussion of the contents of Table 5.\n10. One concern with the information contained in Table\n10 is that among some of the demographic groups,\ndisplaced workers who are reemployed have lower\naverage net worths than among all displaced workers.\nHowever, in each instance where this occurs, the\nassociated standard errors indicate that the two fig-\nures are not significantly different.\nJust Released!\nDesigning\nfor an Aging\nPopulation:\nERGONOMICS\nRESEARCH\nEdited by\nWendy A.
