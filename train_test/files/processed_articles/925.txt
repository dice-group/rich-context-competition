Singer, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, February 29, 2000 (received for review April 20, 1999)\nThis paper presents national estimates of the population likely to\nidentify with more than one race in the 2000 census as a result of\na new federal policy allowing multiple racial identification. A large\nnumber of race-based public policies--including affirmative action\nand the redistricting provisions of the Voting Rights Act--may be\naffected by the shift of some 8\u00ad18 million people out of traditional\nsingle-race statistical groups. The declines in single-race popula-\ntions resulting from the new classification procedure are likely to\nbe greater in magnitude than the net undercount in the U.S. census\nat the center of the controversy over using census sampling. Based\non ancestry data in the 1990 census and experimental survey\nresults from the 1995 Current Population Survey, we estimate that\n3.1\u00ad6.6% of the U.S. population is likely to mark multiple races. Our\nresults are substantially higher than those suggested by previous\nresearch and have implications for the coding, reporting, and use\nof multiple response racial data by government and researchers.\nThe change in racial classification may pose new conundrums for\nthe implementation of race-based public policies, which have faced\nincreasing criticism in recent years.\nracial classification  government statistics  U.S. census\nAminor change in wording in the 2000 census may have major\nimplications for population statistics in the United States.\nInstead of limiting respondents to a single race, the new census\ninstructions will allow respondents to mark ``one or more'' races\n(1). The decision to allow multiple racial identification repre-\nsents a sea change in the U.S. system of racial statistics, which has\nuntil now relied on a set of mutually exclusive, single-race\ncategories. Counts of the population by race are used for\nenforcing a broad set of race-based public policies, including the\nredistricting provisions of the Voting Rights Act, equal oppor-\ntunity laws, and affirmative action (2). The treatment of multi-\nple-race responses is likely to be a challenge for race-based\npolicies in the United States, many of which already face a rising\ntide of public and political criticism.\nThe new method of racial classification will have impacts on\nboth population counts and on the treatment of individuals. If\nthose marking more than one race differ from those who mark\nsingle races, then this reclassification could also affect estimates\nof group characteristics such as health status, income, and\neducational attainment. At an individual level, multiple re-\nsponses will create a series of conundrums for race-based\npolicies. To give just two examples: Does someone who used to\nidentify as ``White'' and now marks ``White'' and ``American\nIndian'' now qualify for a minority small business loan? Does\nsomeone who formerly marked ``Black'' but now marks ``White''\nand ``Black'' no longer qualify? The indeterminacy of race is not\nnew for people with mixed heritage, but whereas the old system\nput the burden of choosing a single race on individuals, the new\nsystem will put this burden on the government, institutions, and\nusers of racial data.\nThis paper presents new national estimates of the size and\ncharacteristics of the population likely to mark more than one\nrace. Based on ancestry data from the 1990 census and exper-\nimental results from the 1995 Current Population survey, we\ncreate two sets of independent estimates that place the count of\nthe multiple-race population between 8 and 18 million people.\nTo put this into perspective, the controversy over census adjust-\nment in the 1990 census involved a net undercount of only about\n4 million persons. Our estimates of the multiple-race population\nare higher than previous estimates based on the introduction of\na separate ``multiracial'' category into the census question, which\nranged from 1 to 1.5% of the U.S. population, about 3 million\npeople (4, 5, 7). Based on the results presented here, we expect\nthe population counts of single-race groups to decline by 3\u00ad6%\nfor Whites, 3\u00ad7% for Blacks, 15\u00ad25% for American Indians, and\n4\u00ad9% for Asians and Pacific Islanders.\nThe change in racial statistics is part of a new federal statistical\npolicy on race that will go beyond the 2000 census to affect all\nfederal statistics, including those dealing with health, economics,\nand program participation. Furthermore, federal statistical pol-\nicy has a strong ``trickle-down'' effect and is usually imitated by\nstate and local governments as well as most private and public\nresearch. Researchers in medicine, public health, and the eco-\nnomic and social sciences will be affected. The results given in\nthis paper thus have implications for all research and program\nadministration that collects or analyzes data on race.\nDespite the fielding of experimental surveys during the four-\nyear review of the policy on racial and ethnic statistics, the ``mark\none or more'' option remains virtually untested. The multiple\nresponse option emerged relatively late into consideration, and\nmost research focused on the introduction of a separate ``mul-\ntiracial'' category (3, 4). The only survey that did include a ``mark\none or more'' format was the 1996 Race and Ethnicity Targeted\nTest (RAETT) (5). To ensure large sample sizes, the RAETT\nsampled only census tracts with very high proportions of par-\nticular racial or ethnic groups. As a consequence the survey was\nnot able to produce results that would be ``generalizable to the\nnational population'' (5). In fact, other research shows that\npeople living in racially segregated census tracts have lower\nintermarriage rates than the national population (6). Further-\nmore, respondents living in homogeneous areas who are of\nmixed ancestry may be less likely to identify multiple races than\nthose living in more diverse settings.\nIn the absence of a national survey testing the actual ``mark\none or more'' format, we turn to two large, nationally represen-\ntative surveys that gathered multiple-race identities in ways that\ndiffer somewhat from the planned 2000 census question but still\nallow estimation of the population likely to mark multiple races.\nFirst, we analyze the results of the 1990 census.

As a second source of data, we analyze\none of the panels from the Current Population Survey (CPS)\nMay 1995 Supplement on Race and Ethnicity. The CPS has been\npreviously analyzed (4), but in a different manner than here. We\nestimate the number of multiple-race respondents based on\nfollow-up questions that gave single-race respondents the chance\nto list additional races to ``better describe'' themselves. In\naddition to obtaining counts, the sources we use also allow us to\nexamine the socioeconomic characteristics of the multiple-race\npopulation and to order multiple responses by an approximate\nmeasure of the strength of identification.\nFramework\nDistinguishing between mixed and unmixed racial ancestry can\nonly be meaningful if consideration is limited to relatively recent\ntimes. Scientists have long abandoned the search for rigid\nbiological distinctions between races (8, 9). Current research on\nhuman origins concerns itself not with the question of whether\ncommon origins exist--this is taken for granted--but, rather,\nwith when our most recent common ancestors lived and when\nsubpopulations branched off from this common ancestor. The\nconcept of the four single-race groups used in the United States\n(American Indian, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and White)\nusually relies on the view that these populations were somehow\nunmixed and therefore definable at the time of their arrival in\nNorth America. Only from such a perspective is it possible to\ndistinguish between those whose ancestors are entirely within a\nsingle racial population and those whose ancestors come from\nmore than one of these populations.\nWith the above caveat in mind, it is useful to distinguish\nbetween three different concentric definitions of the multiple-\nrace population: (i) by genealogy, (ii) by awareness, and (iii) by\nidentification. A genealogical definition includes everyone with\nmixed ancestry, even at a remove of many generations. A\ndefinition taking into account awareness limits this genealogi-\ncally defined population to those who know of their mixed\nancestry. An identification-based definition further limits itself\nto those who actively identify, for example on surveys, with more\nthan one racial group. When we refer to the population that will\nmark more than one race in the 2000 census, we are referring to\nthis last definition.\nThe logical relation of these populations is shown in Fig. 1. We\nsee that each subsequent definition is a subset of the previous\none (i.e., C  B  A). This figure also shows that the children\nof interracial unions form only a subset of the aware multiple-\nrace population (B). We do this to highlight that not all\nmultiple-race people have parents who identify with distinct\nraces and that not all of the children of interracial unions will\nnecessarily identify with both races.\nThe proportion of the population identifying with multiple\nraces can be expressed in terms of the following identity:\nA\nN \nB\nA \nC\nB \nC\nN\nwhere N is the national population, and A, B, and C are the\ncounts of the populations identified in Fig. 1. This decomposition\nillustrates that the proportion of the national population enu-\nmerated with multiple racial identities is a product of the\ndemographic history of a country (represented by AN), the\ndegree of awareness about racial ancestry (BA), and the\nstrength of multiple-race identification (CB). All of these\nfactors are subject to change over time, whether through chang-\ning demography, changes in the population's awareness of its\nancestry, or social changes that affect the appeal of identifying\nwith more than one race.\nFrom a definitional standpoint, the count of the multiple-race\npopulation also depends on the definition of single-race cate-\ngories. As part of the revision of the directive on racial statistics,\nthe former ``Asian and Pacific Islander'' category has been\ndivided into two separate categories. Such changes in category\ndefinitions affect the sizes of all of the variously defined multiple-\nrace populations A, B, and C. If in the future the concept of\nmultiple race included Hispanic responses, there could be a great\nincrease in the number of multiple respondents.\nMost of the factors that contribute to the size of the multiple-\nrace population are not subject to measurement using survey\nresearch. In the end, we can only measure C and N, since we do\nnot know the racial genealogy of the American population, nor\ncan we ask about awareness in a way that does not involve at least\nsome filter on the part of respondents of choosing to identify\ntheir multiple ancestry in a survey. Still, some estimates do exist\nfor the size of the genealogically mixed population in the United\nStates. It has been suggested that the proportion of population\nidentifying as Black with some degree of White ancestry is as\nleast three-quarters and perhaps closer to 90% (10, 11). The\nproportion of American Indians with multiple-race heritage is so\nhigh that no federally recognized tribes have blood quantum\nlevels for membership greater than one-half (12). We cite these\nexamples to illustrate that the ratio CA of those who actively\nidentify with multiple races to those who potentially could\nidentify as such is probably quite small.\nA final consideration in terms of measuring the multiple-race\npopulation is the effect of questionnaire design. About 0.5% of\nrespondents in the 1990 census and in recent national surveys\nmark at least two races despite instructions to ``mark only one''\nrace (7). In the year 2000, the number of multiple respondents\nmay depend in large part on what proportion of the population\nactually reads and notices the instructions reading, ``Mark one or\nmore.'' An additional uncertainty is whether media attention will\nmake the public broadly aware of the multiple-race option even\nbefore census forms are delivered. After publication of the 2000\ncensus results, awareness of the multiple-race option will prob-\nably increase.\nFig. 1. The logical relations of the various definitions of the multiple-race\npopulation in the United States according to various criteria. The population\nC identifying more than one race on surveys and the census will be only a\nsubset of those with mixed racial ancestry, whether this is defined by gene-\nalogy A or by awareness B. Only the populations N and C will be enumerated\nin the 2000 census and other federal statistics. The population C marking more\nthan one race differs from the population that would mark a separate\n``multiracial'' category (the right-most dashed-line ellipse), the option re-\njected in the revised federal statistical standard. It also differs from the\npopulation made up of the children of interracial unions (the left-most dashed\nellipse).\nData and Methods\nWe use two data sources to estimate the number of respondents\nwho are likely to mark more than one race in the 2000 census.\nFirst, the 1990 census provides an indication of multiple-race\nrespondents because it includes both a single-response race\nquestionandanopen,write-inquestiononancestry(http:www.\nipums.umn.edu) (13). The ancestry question included explicit\ninstructions that ``persons who have more than one origin and\ncannot identify with a single ancestry group may report two\nancestry groups (for example, German-Irish)'' (14). Using an\nalgorithm developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we map\nthe roughly 500 detailed ancestry codes to the major racial\ngroups: American Indian and Alaskan Native; Asian and Pacific\nIslander; Black; White; and Other. For example, we code Irish\nancestry as \"White,\" Japanese ancestry as \"Asian and Pacific\nIslander,\" and Nigerian ancestry as \"Black.\" We code the\nsingle-race response to the race question as r1, the assigned race\nof the first ancestry as r2, and the assigned race of the second\nancestry as r3. If the responses to any two of these three racial\ndesignations (r1, r2, r3) corresponded to distinct single-race\ngroups, we coded the individual as identifying multiple races.\nAbout 90% of census respondents gave at least one ancestry, and\n30% gave at least two. Our algorithm tries to err on the\nconservative side by not counting ``other'' responses to the race\nquestion or ancestry responses that are mapped to ``other'' as\nindicating distinct single races. To further reduce the risk of\nmaking ``false positive'' (15) identifications of the multiple-race\npopulation, we changed the Bureau of Labor Statistics ancestry-\nto-race algorithm so that those who wrote in ``American'' as their\nancestry were coded as listing an ``other'' race. The original\nBureau of Labor Statistics algorithm coded these responses as\n``White.''\nThe second data source we use is Panel 2 of the Current\nPopulation Survey May 1995 supplement on Race and Ethnicity\n(http:www.bls.census.govcpsracethnsdata.htm), which\nwas fielded as part of the federal research effort accompanying\nthe revision of standards for racial and ethnic statistics. We\ncompare responses to the CPS ``control card'' single-response\nrace question administered several months before the supple-\nment to a modified race question and follow-up items in the\nsupplement. The modified race question in the supplement\nincluded a separate ``multiracial'' category in addition to the\nstandard single-race categories. Two types of follow-up questions\nwere then asked. First, respondents who identified ``multiracial''\nwere asked to identify component single races. Second, respon-\ndents who identified with a single-race group (instead of the\n``multiracial'' category) in the supplement's first race question\nwere asked to list additional races if they would choose more than\none group to ``better describe'' themselves. We defined multiple-\nrace respondents both as (i) those who chose ``multiracial'' and\nthen listed at least two distinct races in follow-up questions and\n(ii) those who chose a single-race and then listed at least one\nadditional single race to ``better describe'' themselves.\nA large number of respondents chose ``Something else'' as one\nof the races listed in follow-up questions in the CPS. We used two\nsystems of classification to reflect the uncertainty about how\nsuch individuals would respond to the 2000 census question. A\nlarger multiple-race population is obtained by counting ``Some-\nthing else'' responses as reflecting a distinct racial category from\nthat already stated. We call this the ``CPS High'' estimate. A\nmore conservative set of estimates was obtained by counting as\n\"multiple race\" only those ``Something else'' respondents who\ngave other indications that they were referring to a second\ndistinct race. These indications came from either the original\ncontrol-card race question or from a separate ancestry question\n(recoding ancestry to race).\nWe estimated the number and proportion of multiple-race\nrespondents by using unweighted counts from our analysis of the\ncensus and CPS. Estimates of the sampling error, unless other-\nwise indicated, were made assuming independent multinomial\nsampling. The standard errors for our estimates are considerably\nsmaller than those in previous research because we do not\ncompare question formats across independently drawn samples.\nInstead, we take advantage of the fact that the same populations\nwere administered different question formats in a manner\nsimilar to repeated trial experimental design (16).\nCharacteristics of the multiple-race population were also\nestimated from both data sources. Respondents' primary single\nrace was determined by answers to the single-response race\nquestions, the census race question and the CPS control card\nrace question. We interpret primary race as indicating the\npreferred single-race identity of multiple-race individuals when\nfaced with the historical system of mutually exclusive single-race\ncategories. Primary race was also used to estimate the single-race\ngroups from which multiple-race respondents would be drawn.\nHousehold income was used as a measure of socioeconomic\nwell-being. We rely on household rather than individual income\nto minimize any systematic age differences between the popu-\nlations. The multiple-race population tends to be somewhat\nyounger, because of the increase in interracial unions in recent\nResults\nTable 1 summarizes our estimates of the multiple-race popula-\ntion from the CPS and 1990 census. It also provides, for contrast,\nthe estimates of the targeted population from the RAETT (5).\nIt should be kept in mind that for the RAETT the row labels\nrefer to the race of the targeted population and not necessarily\nto the race of the actual respondents. The size of the entire\nmultiple-race population is 3.1% according to our low CPS\nestimate, 3.7% according to our 1990 census-based estimate, and\n6.6% according to our high CPS estimate. The census-based and\nCPS-based estimates are consistent with each other, with the\nIt corresponds to the PRSARAC5 variable constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and\nthe Census Bureau in the publicly available data set.\nTable 1. Percent of traditional single-race populations expected to mark more than race, by\nsource of estimate, with associated standard errors in parentheses\nEstimates for the RAETT refer to race of targeted sample and not necessarily to the race of respondents.

All of our estimates are higher than the 1\u00ad1.5%\nestimates given by previous researchers (3, 5, 7).\nThe multiple response option will have differential effects on\nexisting single-race populations. Most strongly affected will be\nthe American Indian population, who may see their numbers\nshrink by about 14\u00ad20%. The Black and Asian-and-Pacific-\nIslander populations may see declines ranging from about 5\u00ad8%.\nIt appears that the White population will be least affected, but\ncould still shrink by 3\u00ad6%.\nThe finding that all single-race groups will be affected by\nallowing multiple responses is in sharp contrast with previous\nresearch, which found statistically significant declines for Alas-\nkan Native and Asian-and-Pacific-Islander targeted samples but\nnot for White, Black, or American Indian populations (5). This\nearlier research differed from ours not only in that it focused on\nracially segregated populations, but also because estimates were\nless precise (and therefore less likely to find statistically signif-\nicant differences) as a result of comparing independently drawn\nrather than repeatedly tested samples.\nThe standard errors attached to the estimates in Table 1\nmeasure only the uncertainty introduced by random sampling.\nRecoding and sample frame bias are two other potential sources\nof uncertainty. In the case of our estimates, the recoding\nuncertainty is much greater than the sampling error, as can be\nseen by comparing the CPS high and low estimates. However, the\nnational sample frame of the CPS and the census do not\nintroduce additional bias. In the case of the RAETT results,\nthere is no recoding error since the ``mark one or more'' format\nwas used directly as part of the survey instrument. However, the\nbias introduced by the targeted sample frame is potentially large.\nTaking advantage of the multiplicity of questions on race in\nboth the CPS and census data sets, it is possible to order the\nprimary and secondary identities of multiple-race respondents.\nThis will not be possible using data gathered under the ``mark\none or more'' format planned for the 2000 census, since no\nfollow-up questions will elicit the strength of identification.\nTable 2 provides estimates of the joint primary-secondary race\ndistribution of the multiple-race population obtained from the\nCPS ``high'' classification and the census data. The table also\nprovides estimates from two additional surveys, the 1993 round\nof the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (http:www.\numich.edupsid) and the National Health Interview Survey\n(J. Kuo, personal communication), which did not explicitly allow\nmultiple responses but did code multiple responses if they were\ngiven. We see in Table 2 that all four sources show a consistent\npattern: the vast majority--from 64 to 82%--of the multiple-\nrace population list White as their primary race. The most\ncommon secondary race is American Indian. According to the\nCPS estimates, almost two-thirds of multiple-race respondents\nlist White as their first race and American Indian as their second.\nIn the census, the numbers are even higher, with almost three-\nquarters of the multiple-race respondents being of this type. The\nprevalence of American Indian as a second ancestry is consistent\nwith the growth in American Indian race and ancestry responses\nrates of natural increase (19). By contrast, Black-White and\nWhite-Black combinations form a small portion of the multiple-\nrace population. Although people of mixed Black and White\nheritage have been among the most vocal advocates of aban-\ndoning the mutually exclusive single-race system of racial clas-\nsification, they constitute only about one-tenth of the population\nlikely to be enumerated as multiple-race in the 2000 census.

Preliminary unpublished estimates, subject to revision.\nappears that the multiple-race population will consist mostly of\npeople who currently identify with the White majority and not\nwith historically disadvantaged Black, American Indian, and\nAsian populations.\nTo indicate the relative socioeconomic status of multiple-race\nrespondents and the multiple-race population considered as a\nwhole, we report the median household income of the popula-\ntions obtained from the census and CPS in Table 3. We see from\nthe CPS data that the $27,500year median household income\nof the entire multiple-race population is half-way between that\nof single-race Whites and Asians ($37,500year) on the one hand\nand single-race Blacks and American Indians ($17,500year) on\nthe other. The intermediate status of the multiple-race popula-\ntion hides important variation within the multiple-race popula-\ntion, in which median household income ranges from $17,500 for\nrespondents whose primary race is Black to $45,000 for those\nwhose primary race is Asian or Pacific Islander. The variation of\nincome by primary race within the multiple-race population is\nnot substantially less than that by race within the single-race\npopulation. It appears that primary racial identity, not whether\none has single or multiple heritages, drives income differences.\nA systematic difference that does appear between single- and\nmultiple-race populations is that people who list Black, Asian,\nand American Indian as a primary race tend to have slightly\nhigher incomes if they list additional races. The reverse is true\nfor those listing White as their primary race. One possible\nexplanation is that the family backgrounds of multiple-race\nrespondents might be wealthier than single-race respondents,\nparticularly since most multiple-race respondents report some\nWhite ancestry, and Whites have enjoyed a historical economic\nadvantage. A second possible explanation is that the tendency to\nidentify multiple races might itself increase with household\nincome. Selective reporting might mean that the multiple-race\npopulation defined by surveys (population C) is more affluent\nthan the multiple-race population defined by ancestry (A) or\neven by awareness (B). A third possibility is that being multiracial\nmay itself have consequences for income, due perhaps to dif-\nferences in discrimination.\nDiscussion\nThe new multiple-response format for racial statistics provides\na new set of options for Americans filling out census forms and\nother data collection instruments. The decision by individuals\nabout whether to identify with more than one race is a personal\none, making any estimates concerning the size of the more-than-\none-race population inherently uncertain. Many people may be\naware of their mixed heritage, but how many will choose it? It\nappears that the factor that will most affect the counts of the\nmultiple-race population is not how the children of interracial\nunions will identify, but rather how those with more distant,\noften American Indian, ancestry choose to identify themselves.\nIn the 1990 census, 2.9% of the national population identified\nAmerican Indian ancestry while at the same time choosing a race\nother than American Indian. If all of these people mark two races\nin the year 2000, then the multiple-race population will be at\nleast this high, even before any other racial combinations are\ncounted.\nSurvey allow estimates of the multiple-race population likely to\nthe national population actively identifies with more than one\nracial group. While neither source included question formats\nidentical to the planned census question, the estimates derived\nfrom these sources may prove better predictions of the 2000\ncensus results than those previously made from samples that\nwere not representative of the national population (5) or from\ntests of a separate ``multiracial'' category (3, 4). In particular, the\nmultiple response option may prove much more attractive than\na separate ``multiracial'' category, because instructions to mark\n``one or more'' categories involve a supplementation rather than\nreplacement of previously identified single-race identities.\nUnlike previous research, we find that multiple-race identifi-\ncation could indeed reduce the counts of all single-race popu-\nlations. If multiple responses are counted separately from single-\nrace responses, we estimate that single race counts will decline\nAmerican Indians, and 4\u00ad9% for Asians and Pacific Islanders.\nThe width of these estimates is due to uncertainty in the coding\nof certain multiple responses and will depend in part on how the\nCensus Bureau and others decide to code multiple responses,\none of which is ``Other race.'' Such declines are larger in\nmagnitude than the net census undercount from the 1990 census,\nwhich is estimated at about 4.4 million people, or less than 2%\nof the national population.\nOur quantitative conclusions are limited to the extent that our\nsources are indeed comparable to the ``mark one or more''\nformat to be used in the 2000 census race question. It may be that\nAmericans will be more reluctant to report additional ``races'' on\nthe census form than they were to either report additional\n``ancestry'' on previous census forms or to list additional races in\nan interviewer-based survey such as the CPS. The similarity of\nresults obtained from these two sources does, however, add\nconfidence to our results. Still, it is clear that precise estimates\nof the effect of changing the question format will require the\nfielding of surveys that use the actual \"mark one or more\"\nformat. Such surveys were, unfortunately, not undertaken as part\nof the research effort accompanying the revision of the directive\non race and ethnicity. We recommend that future surveys\ninclude the ability to match responses to the new format with\nprevious responses to the former single-race format. Such a\nmethod will provide estimates of the effect of question change\nwith much smaller sampling errors than the independent panel\nformat previously used. As a final consideration, we note that the\neffect of any publicity or public discussion on awareness of the\nmultiple-race format is left out of pilot tests and will have to\nDoes the multiple-race population form a meaningful cate-\ngory, one that should be used for race-based policies like\naffirmative action, redistricting, and other civil rights enforce-\nment? Perhaps most remarkable about the population marking\nmultiple races is its diversity.

As a whole, the socioeconomic situation of\nthe multiple-race population is fairly close to the national\naverage. Membership in a multiple-race category is not, in and\nof itself, terribly predictive. However, knowledge of a particular\ncombination of racial backgrounds appears to be quite predic-\ntive. Because multiple-race Americans, as a group, differ little in\ntheir socioeconomic characteristics from the general population,\nit may prove tempting to exclude this population from the\nprotections given to disadvantaged groups. Such an approach\nwould, however, clearly exclude a number of people from\nprotections to which they had a right under the old system of\nclassification.\nThe diversity of the more-than-one-race population poses\nsome serious problems for any method of classification and for\nthe treatment of this population under existing civil rights\nlegislation. The option of counting anyone with any non-white\nancestry as a minority may lead to controversy over whether\nthose who were previously counted as White should now be\nincluded in counts of the minority population and be entitled to\npolicies aimed at the non-white population, a sensitive issue\ngiven the current climate against race-based public policies. On\nthe other hand, multiracial people as a group might be consid-\nered exempt from programs that seek to benefit traditional,\nsingle-race minorities, but this would bring to life fears already\nexpressed by minority groups regarding the reduction of their\nconstituency base. In any case, the government will have to be\ncareful to avoid accusations of reinventing a modern ``one-drop\nrule'' or of counting whole people as fractions in a manner\nsimilar to the original wording of the U.S. constitution (20). The\nVoting Rights Act makes racial classification unavoidably polit-\nical; classification decisions which affect where district lines\nare drawn may be subject to accusations of a new form of\ngerrymandering.\nFor researchers in the health and social sciences, the change\nin racial statistics also creates the need for decisions and rules\nwhen using multiple-race data. Like government agencies, they\nalso face the complications of discontinuity in time series\ninformation. Our results suggest that the addition of the multi-\nple-race option will indeed affect the counts of single-race\ngroups and may also affect estimates of group characteristics.\nTaken together, the issues raised by multiple-race reporting\nmay fuel criticism not only of race-based policies but also of the\nrationale for the collection of racial statistics in the first place.\nThe growing presence of mixed-race Americans, and of immi-\ngrants who do not find an obvious place for themselves in U.S.\nracial categories, will continue to raise questions about what is\nmeant by ``race'' and why we are trying to measure it.\nThis research was supported by the Russell Sage Foundation, Grant\n2.
