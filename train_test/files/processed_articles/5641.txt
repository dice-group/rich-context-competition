We previously showed in a\nphase III randomized clinical trial that YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae yoga--a program that consists of breathing exercises, postures, and\nmeditation--significantly improved sleep quality in cancer survivors. This study assessed the effects of YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae on\nmemory and identified relationships between memory and sleep. Study design and methods. Survivors were randomized\nto standard care (SC) or SC with YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae . 328 participants who provided data on the memory difficulty item of\nthe MD Anderson Symptom Inventory are included. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality\nIndex. General linear modeling (GLM) determined the group effect of YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae on memory difficulty compared\nwith SC. GLM also determined moderation of baseline memory difficulty on postintervention sleep and vice versa.\nPath modeling assessed the mediating effects of changes in memory difficulty on YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae changes in sleep and vice\nversa. Results. YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae significantly reduced memory difficulty at postintervention compared with SC (mean change:\nyoga=-0.60; SC=-0.16; P<.05). Baseline memory difficulty did not moderate the effects of postintervention sleep\nquality in YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae compared with SC. Baseline sleep quality did moderate the effects of postintervention memory\ndifficulty in YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae compared with SC (P<.05). Changes in sleep quality was a significant mediator of reduced\nmemory difficulty in YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae compared with SC (P<.05); however, changes in memory difficulty did not significantly\nmediate improved sleep quality in YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae compared with SC. Conclusions. In this large nationwide trial, YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae\nyoga significantly reduced patient-reported memory difficulty in cancer survivors.\n",

The widespread prevalence of CRCI\nconstitutes a significant clinical problem for which practical\nand innovative interventions need to be investigated.\nResearch is also needed to assess whether improving mem-\nory might also help moderate and/or mediate improvements\nin sleep and other symptoms.\nResearch has demonstrated the beneficial effects of exer-\ncise, including yoga, on cognitive functioning and its asso-\nciation with fewer cognitive problems later in life among\nhealthy adults, those at risk for neurodegenerative disease,\nand those with chronic conditions.16-21 Although yoga is a\npromising intervention, the effect of yoga on cognitive\nfunction has not been extensively evaluated in cancer\npatients and survivors. Galantino et al22 have evaluated\nyoga for cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients\nreceiving chemotherapy in a case series, showing improved\ncognitive performance on objective tests of attention, exec-\nutive function and memory, and perceived cognitive bene-\nfits. Other studies have showed improvements in other\ncancer-related symptoms, including fatigue, quality of life,\naffect, sleep, and psychological distress.23-30\nSome forms of exercise (or physical activity) are safe\nand beneficial for cancer survivors, and yoga--a mode\nof exercise--has become increasingly popular in this\npopulation.31-35 Hatha yoga--the most widely used form of\nyoga--includes a sequence of meditative, breathing, and\nphysical alignment exercises that require musculoskeletal\nengagement. Restorative yoga is characterized by a combi-\nnation of meditative, breathing, and physical alignment\nexercises requiring the passive support of the body through\nthe use of props and is designed to promote deep relaxation.\nWe recently completed a phase III randomized clinical trial\n(RCT) through the University of Rochester Cancer Center\n(URCC) and Community Clinical Oncology Program\n(CCOP) to investigate the effects of a combined Hatha and\nRestorative yoga program, Yoga for Cancer Survivors\n(YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae ), on sleep quality and efficiency in cancer\nsurvivors posttreatment. We previously reported greater\nimprovements in global and subjective sleep quality, day-\ntime dysfunction, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency,\nand medication use at postintervention compared with con-\ntrols. Additionally, improvements in sleep latency, sleep\nduration, and daytime dysfunction were specific to controls,\nand medication use was reduced by 21% in yoga partici-\npants compared with 5% in controls. Therefore, we con-\ncluded that the improvements in global sleep quality in\nyoga participants may be related to reductions in daytime\ndysfunction in terms of less napping, less fatigue, and better\nsleep continuity, whereas any improvement in controls may\nbe related to continued sleep medication.30,36 Here, we\nreport a secondary data analysis investigating the effects of\nYOCAS\u00a9\u00ae on memory difficulty. We have included\nimportant covariates associated with memory function,\nincluding age, education, race, and ethnicity and also\nexplored other covariates hypothesized to influence mem-\nory function in cancer survivors, including previous sur-\ngery, previous chemotherapy, previous radiation therapy,\nprevious hormone therapy, and current hormone therapy.\nWe also explored moderating effects of memory difficulty\non postintervention sleep quality and vice versa and possi-\nble mediating effects of changes in memory on changes in\nsleep quality and vice versa.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis is a secondary analysis of a previously completed trial,\nof which the primary study results have been published\npreviously.30 This study was registered with clinical trials.\nand 9 CCOPs conducted a nationwide, multicenter, RCT\nexamining the efficacy of yoga for improving sleep quality\nin adult cancer survivors. Survivors were recruited in\ncohorts (n = 20-30), stratified by gender and baseline level\nof sleep disturbance (2 levels: 5 or >5 on an 11-point clini-\ncal symptom inventory scale anchored by 0 = no sleep dis-\nturbance and 10 = worst possible sleep disturbance), and\nrandomly assigned to either a yoga or standard care (SC)\ncontrol group at each CCOP. Group assignment was deter-\nmined by a computer-generated random number table in\nblocks of 2 and 1:1 allocation ratio. The allocation was con-\ncealed from the coordinator until after the participant was\nregistered by using a Web site that generated an e-mail to\nthe research base and individual CCOP site. The study pri-\nmary investigator and biostatistician were blinded to alloca-\ntion. Institutional review board approval was obtained from\nthe URCC CCOPResearch Base and all participating CCOP\nrecruitment sites, and informed consent was obtained from\nall participants.\nCancer survivors were recruited in 12 different US cities\nwere enrolled between 2 and 24 months after completing\nsurgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. For the\ncurrent analyses, the eligibility criteria were not modified.\nEligible survivors must (1) have a confirmed diagnosis of\nany type of cancer; (2) have undergone standard treatment\nfor their cancer; (3) have completed all forms of standard\ntreatment for their cancer between 2 and 24 months prior to\nconsenting for the study and initiation of baseline assess-\nments (continued treatment with hormones or monoclonal\nantibodies was allowed); (4) have persistent sleep distur-\nbance (indicated by a response of 3 or greater on a clinical\nsymptom inventory using an 11-point scale anchored by 0 =\nno sleep disturbance and 10 = worst possible sleep distur-\nbance); (5) be able to read English; (6) be 21 years of age or\nolder; (7) be able to give written informed consent; (8) not\nhave maintained a regular personal practice of yoga within\nthe 3 months prior to enrolling in the study or be actively\nplanning to start yoga on their own; (9) not have a con-\nfirmed diagnosis of sleep apnea; (10) not be receiving any\nform of treatment for cancer, with the exception of hor-\nmonal or monoclonal antibody therapy; and (11) not have\nmetastatic cancer.\nYoga Intervention\nYoga for Cancer Survivors, YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae, designed by\nresearchers at the University of Rochester, is a combined\nHatha and Restorative yoga program, which includes move-\nment, breath, and awareness. A full description of the pro-\ngram is described in a previous publication,30 and key\ninformation is provided herein. Postures include seated,\nstanding, transitional, and supine poses, with an emphasis\non restorative poses, and the program was taught with mod-\nifications to address multiple levels of experience. The\nbreathing exercises focused on regulation of breathing, and\nthe awareness component included meditation instruction,\nvisualization, and affirmation. The intervention was deliv-\nered in an instructor-taught group format over 8 sessions.\nEach session was 75 minutes, and sessions occurred twice a\nweek during the late afternoon or evening at community-\nbased sites, including yoga studios, community centers, and\ncommunity oncology practices. Sessions were standardized\nacross CCOP sites and included physical alignment pos-\ntures, breathing, and mindfulness exercises. Instructors\nwere Registered Yoga Alliance Instructors and each had to\ncomplete a standardized training session and was provided\nwith a detailed YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae instructor manual and DVD. In\naddition, a coordinator at each CCOP completes the stan-\ndardized training session and randomly observes\nYOCAS\u00a9\u00ae sessions to ensure proper content is taught.\nAdherence to the intervention was good, with yoga par-\nticipants attending an average of 6.5 of the 8 sessions. Yoga\nparticipants were also told that they could practice yoga that\nthey learned from class outside class. Exercise contamina-\ntion in the control group was minimal.\nMeasures\nMemory Difficulty\nPerceived memory difficulty was assessed using the MD\nAnderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI). The MDASI is a\npatient-reported clinical assessment tool used widely in can-\ncer centers across the country. This measure, developed\nby Cleeland and colleagues, assesses multiple symptom\noutcomes for clinical and research use and applies to many\ndifferent cancer types. It is sensitive to the symptoms that\ncancer patients experience and is sensitive to change in dis-\nease outcomes, quality of life, and performance status.Atotal\nof 13 core items are present in this measure, and each is\nassessed on a 11-point scale with 0 being not present to 10, as\nbad as you can imagine. This tool is designed to be used to\nassess a total symptom burden as well as individual systems\nrelated to cancer and cancer treatments. Impairment can be\nclassified as none (score of 0), mild (score of 1-3), moderate\n(score of 4-6), and severe (score of 7-10) or used as a con-\ntinuous outcome. The MDASI has been psychometrically\nvalidated with excellent test-retest reliability, internal consis-\ntency, and convergent validity.37 In the current study, we\nfocus on the perceived cognitive function item \"difficulty\nremembering things\" to assess perceived memory difficulty.\nSleep\nSleep quality was measured utilizing the Pittsburgh Sleep\nQuality Index (PSQI), a psychometrically validated, patient-\nreported, 19-item instrument.33 We utilized the global sleep\nquality score for the moderation and mediation analyses\ninvolving sleep variables because this was the primary\noutcome measure in our previously published study.\nStatistical Analyses\nMain Analyses.Data analyses were conducted using SPSS\nversion 22 and MPlus version 9.2. General linear modeling\n(GLM), controlling for age, gender, race, ethnicity, educa-\ntion, baseline memory, and baseline sleep score (PSQI) as\ncovariates, was used to determine the group effect of\nYOCAS\u00a9\u00ae on memory difficulty as compared with con-\ntrols. We included baseline PSQI as a covariate because\nsleep disturbance was an entry criteria for the main trial.\nAge, memory difficulty, and sleep scores were treated as\ncontinuous variables, with gender, race, ethnicity, and edu-\ncation as categorical variables. In a second model, we added\ncovariates of previous surgery, previous chemotherapy, pre-\nvious radiation therapy, previous hormone therapy, and cur-\nrent hormone therapy as binary (ie, yes/no) covariates. In all\ncases, P < .05 was treated as significant.\nModeration Analyses. A moderator is a variable that influences\nthe strength of the relationship between 2 other variables.\nHere, we assessed the influence of baseline sleep on postinter-\nvention memory by intervention condition and vice versa. To\nassess moderation of memory difficulty on sleep, we included\nage, mean-centered baseline memory difficulty score, mean-\ncentered baseline PSQI, and mean-centered baseline memory\ndifficulty score by intervention condition arm (YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae vs\nSC) interaction in our GLM model to evaluate moderation\nsignificance on PSQI score at postintervention.38\nTo assess moderation of sleep on memory, we included\nage, mean-centered baseline sleep, mean-centered baseline\nmemory, and mean-centered baseline sleep score by inter-\nvention condition arm interaction in our GLM model to\nevaluate moderation significance on memory difficulty\nscore at postintervention. IBM SPSS version 22 was used\nfor these calculations.\nMediation Analyses.A mediator is a variable that explains\npartially or in its entirety a relationship between 2 other\nvariables. Here, we assessed the effect of changes in mem-\nory on the efficacy of the intervention on sleep quality and\nvice versa. To determine the potential mediation effects of\nchanges in reduced memory difficulty from preintervention\nto postintervention through YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae on improved sleep\nand vice versa, we performed path modeling on change\nscores for memory and sleep, to derive path coefficients\nincluding age as a covariate. We first conducted 2 good-\nness-of-fit tests to determine model fit of memory mediat-\ning changes in sleep and vice versa. The memory mediation\nmodel included a direct path between intervention condi-\ntion arm (YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae vs SC) and sleep, a path between\nintervention condition arm and memory, and a path between\nmemory and sleep. Age was also included as a covariate.\nThe sleep mediation model followed the same design, with\na direct path between intervention condition arm and mem-\nory, a path between arm and sleep, and a path between sleep\nand memory. Age was also included as a covariate. Statisti-\ncal significance of mediation was assessed through 95%\nconfidence intervals (obtained from 10000 bootstrap sam-\nples) for the indirect path coefficient from intervention con-\ndition to memory on sleep and vice versa.39 Mplus version\n9.2 was used for the calculations. In all cases, P < .05 deter-\nmined statistical significance.\nResults\nParticipant Characteristics\nIn the current study, 328 participants provided evaluable\nmemory difficulty data at baseline and postintervention\n(Figure 1). Participants were predominantly female (96%)\nand 54 years of age, on average, ranging from 26 to 72 years\nold. Most of the participants had a diagnosis of breast can-\nImpact of Yoga on Memory Difficulty\nThe average score on the MDASI memory item in the entire\ncohort was 3.03 at study baseline, indicating a mild level of\ndifficulty in the overall population: 14% had no difficulty\nhad moderate difficulty (score of 4-6), and 13% had severe\ndifficulty (score of 7-10; Table 2). Postintervention, those in\nthe YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae group had a raw score decrease in memory\ndifficulty of 0.60 units, whereas controls had a raw score\ndecrease of 0.16 units (Table 3 and Figure 2). This repre-\nsents a 19.2% improvement in the YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae group com-\npared with a 5.4% improvement in controls; this\npostintervention group difference was statistically signifi-\ncant per the GLM model, controlling for relevant covari-\nates, including age, race, gender, ethnicity, education,\nbaseline memory, and baseline sleep score (PSQI) (P < .05).\nAdditionally, the only covariate that was significantly and\nindependently associated with postintervention memory\nscore was baseline memory score. We also explored whether\nprevious surgery, previous chemotherapy, previous radia-\ntion therapy, previous hormone therapy, and current hor-\nmone therapy were significant covariates in the GLM\nmodels. None of these was significant; however, previous\nchemotherapy showed a trend toward significance (P =\n.06), with chemotherapy exposure associated with increased\nreported memory difficulty. Overall, the Cohen's D effect\nsize of the impact of yoga over control was -0.24, indicat-\ning significantly more improvement in the YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae\ngroup compared with controls (P < .05).\nModeration and Mediation Pathways: Testing\nMemory as the Moderator and Mediator on\nSleep\nWe decided to keep age as a covariate in the moderation and\nmediation pathway analyses because age is well known for\nassociation with cognitive difficulties, including memory\ndifficulty, and the age range of participants in our study\nspanned 47 years. We did not find a significant moderating\neffect of baseline memory on postintervention PSQI (P >\n.05). For mediation, we assessed changes in memory medi-\nating changes in sleep. In this model, the direct effect of the\nintervention on sleep (using the PSQI total change score)\nintervention improved sleep quality by 0.762 points com-\npared with the SC control group. The direct effect of the\ning that the intervention reduced memory difficulty by 0.45\npoints. The path estimate for the mediating effects of\nYOCAS\u00a9\u00ae on sleep via memory was -0.135points (P =\n.06); however, this was not significant.\nModeration and Mediation Pathways: Testing\nSleep as the Moderator and Mediator on\nMemory\nWe found a significant moderating effect of baseline sleep\non postintervention memory difficulty (P < .05). For media-\ntion, we assessed changes in sleep mediating changes in\nmemory. In this model, the direct effect of the intervention\non memory (using the memory difficulty change score) was\nintervention improved memory by 0.361 points compared\nwith the SC control group. The direct effect of the interven-\nintervention improved sleep by 0.894 points. The path esti-\nmate for the mediating effects of YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae on memory\nof the improvement in memory was mediated through\nimproving sleep.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first study from a large RCT to show that\nYOCAS\u00a9\u00ae yoga--an intervention previously shown to\nimprove global sleep quality--also significantly reduced\nperceived memory difficulty in cancer survivors. Whereas\n85% of survivors reported some degree of memory diffi-\nculty, the most common rating was mild (51%), which is\nconsistent with descriptions of complaints in survivors as\noften subtle. Baseline memory scores were significant inde-\npendent predictors of postintervention memory difficulty.\nNo other predictors that we assessed were significant; how-\never, previous chemotherapy exposure showed a trend that is\nconsistent with this type of treatment, as often reported as\nthe most strongly associated with cognitive complaints.\nWhen we assessed moderation of memory on sleep, we did\nnot find a significant relationship; however, baseline sleep\ndid moderate the effects of reduced memory difficulty pos-\ntintervention. Additionally, memory mediation did not sig-\nnificantly play a role in improving sleep; however, mediation\nby sleep did play a significant role in improving memory.\nFigure 1. Participant flow diagram for secondary analysis.\nAbbreviation: RCT, randomized controlled trial.\nOverall, these results support the hypothesis that yoga has\na positive effect on memory function in cancer survivors and\nreduces memory difficulty. Limited research has been con-\nducted in this area. Sprod et al40 demonstrated that older\nTable 1.

One\nrecent, noncontrolled feasibility study showed a positive\neffect of Tai Chi Chuan on multiple domains of cognitive\nfunction in cancer survivors, including memory, concentra-\ntion, and attention.41 No large randomized controlled clinical\ntrials assessing physical activity interventions for CRCI have\nbeen conducted, making the results of the current study novel.\nThe current study has a number of strengths. First, it con-\nsists of a large nationwide sample of cancer survivors, making\nthe results generalizable to the US population. Moreover,\nassessment of the impact of yoga on memory was conducted\nusing a rigorous, randomized controlled clinical trial design.\nFinally, perceived memory function was assessed, making the\nresults relevant to the patients' experience. Although these\nresults need to be confirmed in future research, this is the first\nlarge study that suggests that yoga can improve perceived\nmemory function in cancer survivors.This finding is supported\nby animal literature showing that physical activity can increase\nneurogenesis in the hippocampus of the brain--a region that is\nresponsible for memory--and that chemotherapy damages by\nreducing neurogenesis. Numerous studies have shown that\nvarious forms of exercise in rodents improve memory, and\nmost recently, exercise in mice was shown to improve chemo-\ntherapy-induced spatial memory impairments in animal\nThe concept that improved sleep can help improve mem-\nory function is important, particularly if interventions that\ntarget sleep also improve memory and other cognitive func-\ntions. Previous studies have shown that improvements in\ncognitive function also improve other symptoms. For\nexample, cognitive training of memory in cancer survivors\nalso improved depression.43 Another cognitive training\nstudy showed improvements in anxiety and depression fol-\nlowing similar cognitive training exercises.44 Our hypothe-\nses need further testing. In an ongoing phase III trial, we are\ncurrently testing mediation hypotheses to further investi-\ngate the impact of yoga on sleep and memory difficulties\nand other co-occurring symptoms. In that study, we will\ninvestigate mediation and moderation effects of yoga on\nglobal sleep quality as well as sleep duration, sleep latency,\nsleep disturbance, daytime dysfunction, medication use,\nand subjective sleep quality. Improving memory and sleep\ncould enhance overall quality of life and could have broad\nimplications for improving activities of daily living, work-\nAlthough these results are encouraging, the study is not\nwithout limitations. First, while the results are based on a\nlarge nationwide RCT, the trial was not designed specifi-\ncally to assess changes in cognition. Therefore, the assess-\nment of cognition was limited to memory impairment and\nused a single-item self-report measure from the MDASI. A\nmore sophisticated cognitive battery, with both objective\nand subjective assessments, is needed in future studies to\ndetermine if the impact of yoga is restricted to memory\nimprovements or whether other domains of cognition may\nalso be improved. Objective assessments of memory will\nalso help support our findings. In the current analysis, we\ndid not have data on the time since the last treatment, which\nis an important covariate to consider in future studies.\nAdditionally, future studies need to incorporate more\ndetailed treatment agent, dosage, frequency, and duration\ninformation to tease apart the impact of therapy on cogni-\ntive function and whether or not interventions for memory\ndifficulty may work better in certain treatment settings. Our\npopulation included primarily breast cancer survivors, and\nthe impact of yoga on memory, sleep, and other symptoms\nneeds to be more thoroughly examined in those with other\ndiagnoses. Finally, the mediation analyses need to be inter-\npreted with caution because such analyses should use inter-\nmediate time points. In our analysis, we conducted the path\nanalyses with change scores, and we lack the requisite tem-\nporal order of mediation, where the mediator is measured at\na time between the intervention and postintervention assess-\nment. However, overall, our results do indicate that for\npatients with sleep problems, yoga improved memory, at\nleast partially via improved sleep.\nThe effects of YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae Yoga compared with SC on\nreducing memory difficulty were significant, positive, and\nconducted with a rigorous study design. More elaborate\nRCTs designed to specifically assess cognitive function\noutcomes in cancer survivors are needed to confirm these\nresults. Moreover, further research is needed to better\nunderstand which components of yoga (ie, physical move-\nments, meditation, and relaxation) are most important for\nimproving memory function in cancer survivors.\nTable 2.
