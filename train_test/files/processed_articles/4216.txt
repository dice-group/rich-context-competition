Therefore, searching\nfor alternative therapeutic modalities is urgently needed. Bitter melon (Momordica charantia) is a traditional dietary fruit,\nbut its extract also shows potential medicinal values in human diabetes and cancers. Here, we sought to investigate\nthe extract of bitter melon (BME) in antitumorigenic and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells. Methods.\nThree varieties of bitter melon were used to prepare the BME. Ovarian cancer cell lines, human immortalized epithelial\novarian cells (HOSEs), and nude mice were used to evaluate the cell cytotoxicity, cisplatin resistance, and tumor inhibitory\neffect of BME. The molecular mechanism of BME was examined by Western blotting. Results. Cotreatment with BME\nand cisplatin markedly attenuated tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in a mouse xenograft model, whereas there was no\nobservable toxicity in HOSEs or in nude mice in vivo. Interestingly, the antitumorigenic effects of BME varied with different\nvarieties of bitter melon, suggesting that the amount of antitumorigenic substances may vary. Studies of the molecular\nmechanism demonstrated that BME activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in an AMP-independent but CaMKK\n(Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase)-dependent manner, exerting anticancer effects through activation of AMPK\nand suppression of the mTOR/p70S6K and/or the AKT/ERK/FOXM1 (Forkhead Box M1) signaling cascade. Conclusion. BME\nfunctions as a natural AMPK activator in the inhibition of ovarian cancer cell growth and might be useful as a supplement\nto improve the efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.\n",

Chan, PhD1\n Keywords\nbitter melon, Momordica charantia, AMPK activator, cisplatin, ovarian cancer, chemoresistance\nwhich is a popular herb in ancient folk medicines in China,\nIndia, Southeast Asia, and Central America, has received\nmuch global recognition not only because of its remarkable\nhypoglycemic effects, but also because of its recently rec-\nognized anticancer effects. The findings that bitter melon\nexhibits anticancer properties is reminiscent of metformin, a\nderivative of a natural plant product, originally developed as\nan insulin-sensitizing and antihyperglycemic drug used in\nthe treatment of type II diabetes mellitus.10 Recently, it has\nbeen suggested that the anticancer effects of metformin11,12\nmight be a result of its capability to stimulateAMP-activated\nprotein kinase (AMPK).13 AMPK is a cellular energy sensor\nthat plays an important role in the maintenance of energy\nhomeostasis in response to external stresses.14,15 Recent\nstudies have suggested that AMPK reprograms cancer cell\nmetabolism and inhibits cell proliferation in various human\ncancers.16,17 Our previous investigations have demonstrated\nthat growth of cervical cancer cells is significantly sup-\npressed by a number of pharmacological activators of\nAMPK, such as metformin, AICAR, and A23187, by reduc-\ning the Wnt/-catenin18 and AKT/FOXO3a/Forkhead Box\nM1 (FOXM1)19 signaling cascades. However, because of\nthe toxic side effects of conventional AMPK activators such\nas metformin, which can cause lactic acidosis and gastroin-\ntestinal side effects,20,21 the use of nontoxic, natural AMPK\nactivators may be preferable to combat the development of\novarian cancer and chemoresistance.\nRecent studies have suggested that extract of bitter\nmelon (BME) contains triterpenoids and possesses the abil-\nity to activate AMPK and induce GLUT4 translocation9,22;\nhowever, its antitumor effects and the underlying molecular\nmechanisms are not totally clear. BME has potent antitumor\nactivity against different cancer cells, probably because of\nthe presence of some of its active components, including\ntriterpenoids such as cucurbitacin B (cucB) and kuguacin J.\nTriterpenoids from a wide range of botanicals have already\nbeen confirmed to possess antiproliferative23-25 and anti-\nhave been extracted from bitter melon; however, their bio-\nlogical functions have yet to be investigated in detail.\nRecently, it had been reported that cucB, a triterpenoid from\nCucurbitaceae vegetables, existed in the seeds of bitter\nmelon as well and had induced cell cycle arrest and apopto-\nsis in human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cells.25 Another\ntriterpenoid, kuguacin J, which accounts for only around\n1.6% of bitter melon leaf extract, had been shown to signifi-\ncantly inhibit cancer and/or carcinogenesis by causing cell\ncycle arrest at the G1 phase and inducing apoptosis in pre-\ninitiated or initiated tumor cells. In more advanced tumors,\nkuguacin J not only had the ability to sensitize chemoresis-\ntant cancer cells to anticancer drug\u00adinduced cell death, but\nalso to successfully block tumor progression and metasta-\nsis, implying that natural compounds from BME might be\nuseful in the development of chemopreventive as well as\nchemotherapeutic agents.\nIn this study, we examined the anticancer effects of BME\nand compared the tumor-suppressive properties of different\nvarieties of bitter melon. Studies of the molecular mechanism\nrevealed that BME acts as a naturalAMPK activator, increas-\ning AMPK through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein\nkinase- (CaMKK) signaling in an AMP-independent\nmanner, which in turn represses both mTOR/p70S6K and\nAKT/ERK/FOXM1 signals. It is important to note that based\non the nontoxic nature of BME, we explored the possibility\nof using BME as a potential supplement to improve the effi-\ncacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.\nMaterials and Methods\nCell Culture, BME, and Drugs\n(provided by Professor B. K.Tsang, Department of Obstetrics\nand Gynecology, University of Ottawa, Canada; authentica-\ntion of cell lines carried out by in-house STR DNA profiling\nanalysis), SKOV3, OVCA433, ES2 (American Type Culture\nCollection, Rockville, MD), and 2 human immortalized epi-\n18 (provided by Professor G. S. W. Tsao, Department of\nAnatomy, The University of Hong Kong), were used in this\nstudy. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's\nMedium (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) sup-\nplemented with 10% (volume/volume [v/v]) fetal bovine\nserum (Invitrogen, Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA ) and 100\nU/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies,\nCarlsbad, CA) in an incubator at 37\u00b0C with humidified\natmosphere of 5% CO\nand 95% air. Three varieties of\nyoung bitter melon (not yet ripe) such as Thailand, Chinese,\nand Taiwanese were purchased from the supermarket\n(Supplementary Figure S1, available at http://ict.sagepub.\ncom/supplemental). After being washed and deseeded, bitter\nmelon extract (BME) of each variety was extracted according\nto the method described in previous publications.28,29 Briefly,\nBME was extracted by a household blender and centrifuged\nat 500g at 4\u00b0C for half an hour (Supplementary Figure S1).\nThe supernatant was filtered using a 0.22 \u00b5m syringe filter\nand stored in aliquots at -80\u00b0C for future use. As needed,\n0.25% to 10% (v/v in medium) of pure BME was used for in\nvitro and in vivo studies. The BME samples were stored at the\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of\nHong Kong. AMPK activators AICAR, A23187, and metfor-\nmin and the CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 were obtained\nfrom Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK).\nHEK-293 Cells Expressing Tetracycline-Inducible\nAMPK-2 (Wild Type or Mutant) and RNAi-\nMediated AMPK1 Knockdown\nDNA encoding full-length human AMPK-2 was amplified\nwith primers designed to encode a 5-BamHI site and a\nC-terminal FLAG tag followed by an XhoI site. The result-\ning polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was cloned\ninto the pcDNA5/FRT (Flp recombinase target)/TO plasmid\n(Invitrogen) to create the plasmid pcDND5/FRT/TO/2. The\nR531G mutation was created in this plasmid using the\nQuikChangeSite-DirectedMutagenesissystem(Stratagene).\nT-RexHEK293cellscontainingasingleFRTsite(Invitrogen)\nwere transfected with Fugene6 (Promega, Madison, WI,\nUSA) using the plasmids POG44 encoding Flp recombinase\n(Invitrogen) and pcDND5/FRT/TO/2 at a ratio of 9:1. After\n48 hours, the cells were detached using trysin and replated in\nmedium containing hygromycin B (200 \u00b5g/mL) and blastici-\ndin (15 \u00b5g/mL). The medium was replaced every 3 days\nuntil cell foci could be identified, and individual foci were\nthen selected and expanded. The expression of FLAG-\ntagged AMPK-2 was checked using Western blotting with\nanti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO).\nExpression of AMPK-2 (wild-type, AMP-sensitive [WT]\nor AMP/ADP-insensitive R531G mutant [RG]) was induced\nwith tetracycline (1 \u00b5g/mL) for 48 hours. To knockdown\nhuman AMPK1, the TriFECTa RNAi Kit, which contains 3\nsiRNAs specifically targeting human AMPK1, was pur-\nchased from IDT (Integrated DNATechnologies, Inc, Iowa).\nCell transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINETM\n2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions. The universal negative control siRNA (IDT) was used\nas scrambled control, and Western blotting was used to\nverify the expression of AMPK1.\nRNA Extraction and Real-Time Quantitative\nReverse Transcription PCR (qPCR)\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary\nDNA (cDNA) was synthesized using a reverse transcription\nreagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City). The expression\nlevel of FOXM1 was evaluated by qPCR in an ABI PRISM\n7500 system (Applied Biosystems) using Taqman gene\nused as an internal control.\nWestern Blot Analysis\nProteins in cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE\nand transferred to polyvinylidene-difluoride membranes.\nThe membranes were blotted with 5% skimmed milk and\nsubsequently probed overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibod-\nies specific for anti-p-AMPK, anti-AMPK1, anti-AMPK,\nanti-p-AKT, anti-AKT, anti-p-p70S6K, anti-p-mTOR, anti-\nmTOR (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-p-ERK, anti-ERK,\nanti-FOXM1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA),\nand anti--actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and then incu-\nbated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat antirabbit\nor antimouse secondary antibody (Amersham, Uppsala,\nSweden). Immunodetection was performed with enhanced\nchemiluminescence reagent solution (Amersham ECL) and\nvisualized by medical X-ray film.\nCell Proliferation and Focus Formation Assays\nAn XTT cell proliferation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)\nwas used to measure cell viability according to the manu-\nfacturer's protocol. Three independent experiments were\nperformed in triplicate. For focus formation assay, approxi-\n6-well plate and treated with different drugs. After incuba-\ntion at 37\u00b0C in an incubator for 2 weeks, colonies were\nstained with crystal violet and counted.\nWound Healing and Matrigel Cell Migration and\nInvasion Assays\nFor wound healing assays, an equal amount of cells was\ngrown as a monolayer to 90% confluence in a 6-well plate.\nThe cells were pretreated with 10 \u00b5g/mL mitomycin C for 2\nhours, and a wound was then scratched with a sterile 200 \u00b5L\npipette tip in each well. After washing each well with phos-\nphate buffered saline (PBS), cells were treated with drugs\nand incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified, 5% CO\natmosphere.\nThe width of each wound was monitored at specific time\nintervals, with the relative velocity of cell migration being\ncalculated by dividing the width over time.\nFor Matrigel cell migration and invasion assays\ncells/mL in serum-free medium was added to each insert.\nThe medium (500 \u00b5L) containing 10% fetal bovine serum\nwas added to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. After\n1 to 2 days, the migrated cells were stained and counted by\nmicroscopy.\nFluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting\nCell cycle analysis was carried out to elucidate cell cycle\narrest and apoptosis induced by AMPK activator or BME\nby means of propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry.\nOvarian cancer cells were initially suspended in serum-free\nmedium and subsequently seeded into 6-well plates at a\ndensity of 0.5 \u00d7 106 viable cells per well. The cells were\nincubated overnight at 37\u00b0C in an incubator with a humidi-\nfied atmosphere of 5% CO\nand 95% air. The full medium\ntogether with either AMPK activator or BME was applied\nto the cells on the next day, and the plates were incubated\novernight as before. Cell pellets were collected by centrifu-\nnol. The cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer (BD\nBiosciences), and the number of cells in each phase of the\ncell cycle was quantified by Modfit software.\nIn Vivo Tumorigenicity Assay\nTo study the in vivo consequences of BME on tumor devel-\nopment, 1 \u00d7 106 ovarian cancer cells ES2 were implanted\nsubcutaneously into the right flank of 5-week old BALB/\ncAnN-nu female nude mice in groups of 5. Intraperitoneal\nadministration of BME was, therefore, started to pretreat\nthe mice for 2 days, and afterward cisplatin treatment was\ninitiated every other day for a total of 6 injections. Treatment\nwith BME was continued during cisplatin treatment. For\nthe control group, PBS was injected intraperitoneally at the\nsame times. The sizes of tumors were determined at the\ntime of each injection utilizing a digital slide caliper and\nwere evaluated using the following formula: Volume =\n[(Width + Length) \u00f7 2]3 \u00d7 /6. All experimental procedures\ndescribed in this report were submitted to and approved by\nThe Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and\nHong Kong.\nData Analysis\nThe Student t test was used to analyze parametric data,\nwhereas the Mann-Whitney test was used for nonparamet-\nric data. A P value .05 was considered significant.\nResults\nBME Specifically Inhibits Ovarian Cancer Cell\nGrowth\nGiven that a known AMPK activator such as metformin\nmediated growth inhibitory effects on human ovarian can-\ncer cells (Supplementary Figure S2A, available at http://ict.\nsagepub.com/supplemental), we examined whether a poten-\ntial natural AMPK activator, BME, could mediate the same\neffect. Several human ovarian cancer cell lines were treated\nChinese BME, so that the majority of the cells could main-\ntain appropriate viability and their respective proliferation\nrates could be measured by XTT cell proliferation assay for\ncells was significantly inhibited from 20% to 87% com-\npared with controls, but there was no significant effect on\nthe proliferation of immortalized human ovarian surface\nepithelial (HOSE 17-1) cells (Figure 1A). In addition, focus\nformation assays showed that the number of colonies was\ncells, respectively, whereas there was no effect using\nHOSE17-1 cells (Figure 1B). These results show that BME\nfunctions similarly to a known pharmacological activator of\nAMPK in attenuating cell growth of human ovarian cancer\ncells while having no cytotoxic effects on normal ovarian\nepithelial cells.\nBME Induces Cell Growth Arrest and Apoptosis\nin Ovarian Cancer Cells\nBecause long-term inhibitory effects of BME on cell viabil-\nity of human ovarian carcinoma cells were observed, we\nexamined whether it modulates cell cycle progression and\ninduces apoptotic cell death in a manner similar to known\npharmacological activators of AMPK (Supplementary\nFigure S2B). Similar to metformin, treatment for 24 hours\nwith 10% (v/v) Chinese BME of the ovarian cancer cell line\nA2780cp yielded a small but significant increase in cells\narrested in the G1 phase and a decrease in cells in the S\nphase compared with untreated controls (Figure 1C). On the\nother hand, apoptotic cell death ofA2780cp cells after BME\ntreatment was also elevated, as indicated by the 40%\nincrease in the sub-G1 cell content compared with untreated\ncontrols (Figure 1C). Furthermore, Western blot analysis\ndemonstrated that treatment with 5% or 10% (v/v) Chinese\nBME increased cleavage of PARP and caspase 3, both\n(Figure 1D). Additionally, 5% or 10% (v/v) Chinese BME\nenhanced the phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK, c-Jun, p38,\ngesting that BME induced apoptosis in human ovarian can-\ncer cells via intrinsic apoptotic mechanisms.\nBME Inhibits Migration and Invasion of Ovarian\nCancer Cells\nPrevious studies have reported that activation of AMPK by\nAICAR or metformin not only inhibits cell proliferation but\nalso retards cell migration,30,31 which might further enhance\nits capacity for tumor suppression. Thus, it was of interest\nto determine whether BME impaired migration and inva-\nsion of human ovarian cancer cells. In this study, the ovar-\nian cancer cell line SKOV3, a higher migratory cell line,\nwas subjected to BME treatment. Wound healing assays\nshowed that the wound closure rate of SKOV3 cells was\nsignificantly slowed by BME in a concentration-dependent\nmanner, yielding 40% to 50% reduction of cell migration on\ntreatment with 5% and 10% (v/v) Chinese BME (Figure 2A).\nIn addition, transwell cell migration assays showed that\naround 50% reduction in cell migration of SKOV3 cells was\ncaused by 5% or 10% (v/v) Chinese BME treatment, com-\npared with untreated controls (Figure 2B). Moreover, tran-\nswell invasion assays showed that the number of cells that\ninvaded through the matrigel was reduced by ~60% in\nSKOV3 cells treated with 10% BME (Figure 2C).\nBME Inhibits Tumor Growth of Ovarian Cancer\nCells In Vivo\nWe next determined whether BME could impair tumor\ngrowth in a mouse xenograft tumor model. An interesting\nfinding from a recent study was that Thai bitter ground\nfruits contained monofunctional phase II enzyme inducers\nthat stimulated phase II enzymes and inhibited mono-oxy-\ngenase in rat liver, whereas a Chinese variety only contained\nbioactive compounds capable of affecting mono-oxygenase\nin rats.32 Given the diverse effects exerted by different vari-\neties of bitter melon, different varieties of BME may also\nhave differing efficacies in inhibiting ovarian tumor growth.\nIn this study, a highly metastatic ovarian cancer cell line,\nES2, was inoculated subcutaneously into female nude mice,\nand when a palpable tumor was formed, 10% (v/v) BME\nfrom bitter melon of Taiwanese or Chinese varieties was\nadministered intraperitoneally every 2 days, with a total of 6\ninjections. As shown in Figure 3A, Taiwanese and Chinese\nBME significantly suppressed tumor growth by 1.4- to\n2-fold, respectively, compared with the PBS-treated con-\ntrols. The tumor weights displayed 40% to 70% reductions\non day 12 in the Taiwanese and Chinese BME-treated groups\n(Figures 3B and 3C). These findings are consistent with our\nin vitro tumor growth results and further support our notion\nthat different varieties of BME have strong suppressive\ncapacity in ovarian cancer tumor growth in vivo.\nDifferent Varieties of Bitter Melon Have\nDifferent Capacities to Sensitize Ovarian Cancer\nCells to Cisplatin/Taxol-Induced Cell Cytotoxicity\nDespite the efficacy of platinum-based drugs such as cispla-\ntin in killing cancer cells, development of cellular resistance\nto these drugs causes obstacles in the clinical management\nof the disease.33,34 Recent evidence has indicated that phar-\nmacological activators of AMPK such as metformin could\nenhance cisplatin-induced cell cytotoxicity.35 Considering\nthe speculation that BME acts as a potential natural AMPK\nactivator that inhibits ovarian cancer cell growth, it was of\ninterest to explore whether BME could enhance cisplatin-\nmediated cell cytotoxicity. In this study, two cisplatin-resis-\nChinese BME and cisplatin. Treatment with either 0.5% to\nFigure 1. BME impairs cell growth and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells.

(C) Upper: A2780cp cells\nwere rapidly treated with 10% (v/v) Chinese BME for 24 hours, and the extent of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was estimated by\npropidium iodide\u00adbased flow cytometry. Lower: C13* and OV2008 cells were treated with 5% and 10% (v/v) Chinese BME for 24\nhours, and Western blot analysis was performed to examine the effects on cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP, and phosphorylation of\nSAPK/JNK, c-Jun, p38, MAPKAPK-2, and HSP27. Representative cropped blots are presented.\nAbbreviations: BME, extract of bitter melon; HOSE, human immortalized epithelial ovarian cells.\n1% (v/v) BME was equivalent to a high dose of cisplatin (3\n\u00b5g/mL) in suppressing the cell proliferation of A2780cp and\nC13* cells, whereas cotreatment with BME and cisplatin\nfurther enhanced cisplatin-mediated cell cytotoxicity by\n~2-fold (Figure 4A). Next, the effect of BMEs from 2 other\nvarieties--that is, Taiwanese and Thai--on chemoresistance\nFigure 2. Bitter melon extract (BME) inhibits ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion. (A) Wound healing assays demonstrating\nthat there was a marked retardation in wound closure rate of SKOV3 cells treated with 5% and 10% (v/v) Chinese BME compared\nwith untreated controls over a time course of 12 hours (*P  .001). The width of the wound is indicated by arrows in the\nphotographs; 3 independent experiments were performed. (B) Transwell migration assay showed that SKOV3 cells with Chinese BME\ntreatment (5% and 10%) exhibited a significant reduction in the number of cells penetrating through the membrane as compared with\nuntreated controls (*P  .001). (C) SKOV3 cells treated with Chinese BME (10%) showed less invaded cells through the matrigel as\ncompared with the control (*P = .0006). The numbers of migrated or invaded cells in 3 randomly chosen fields were counted for 3\nindependent experiments, and the normalized numerical data were presented in bar charts with error bars.\nFigure 3. Bitter melon extract (BME) from different varieties of bitter melon displays significant antitumor effects in an ES2 xenograft\nmouse tumor model. (A) ES2 cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of female nude mice. On the seventh day after\ntumor cell injection, treatments with 10% (v/v) Taiwanese (TW) and Chinese BME (100 \u00b5L) were initiated and carried on every\nother day, with a total of 6 injections. Treatment with 10% (v/v) TW (*P = .01) and Chinese BME (**P = .0007) in PBS resulted in a\nslower rate of tumor growth as compared with PBS-treated controls. The tumor volume of each group was measured for 12 days\nand expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM from 5 mice. (B) Chinese and Taiwanese BME markedly diminished (28%-71%) tumor weight, when\ncompared with controls, on day 12. (C) Photographs illustrate that excised tumors from nude mice subcutaneously injected with\novarian cancer cell lines ES2 exhibited tumor stasis after BME injection, as evidenced by the smaller tumor sizes.\nwas examined. Treated with a lower concentration of cispl-\natin (1.5 \u00b5g/mL), there was only a slight inhibition of cell\nthe cell growth of both cell lines was reduced by 18% to\n30% on treatment with 1% (v/v) Taiwanese or Thai BME\n(Figure 4B). Cotreatment with either Taiwanese or Thai\nBME and cisplatin (1.5 \u00b5g/mL) further enhanced inhibition\nof cell growth by 40% to 50% compared with cisplatin\nalone, in both cell lines (Figure 4B). Interestingly, cotreat-\nment with 1% (v/v) Chinese BME and taxol (1 ng/mL) also\npared with either treatment alone (Figure 4C).\nTo further investigate whether BME enhanced cisplatin-\ninduced cell cytotoxicity against ovarian cancer cells in an\nin vivo tumor model, ES2 tumor-bearing nude mice were\nintraperitoneally injected with Chinese BME (2.5% and\n10%, v/v) and cisplatin (3 \u00b5g/kg) every alternate day for 12\ndays. Consistent with the in vitro data, BME further reduced,\nin a dose-dependent manner, cisplatin-mediated tumor\ngrowth retardation by 25% to 50% compared with cisplatin\nalone (Figure 4D).\nBME Activates AMPK and Suppresses mTOR in\nan AMP-Independent Manner via the CaMKK\nPathway\nMany AMPK activators are secondary metabolites of plants\nthat act as inhibitors of mitochondrial function, in which\ncase AMPK activation is induced by increased cellular\nratios of AMP to ATP or ADP to ATP and is accompanied by\ndecreases in cellular oxygen uptake.36 We studied the mech-\nanism of activation of AMPK by BME using isogenic\nHEK293 cell lines expressing AMPK complexes contain-\ning either WT cells or RG cells. These were similar to cell\nlines constructed previously,36 except that expression of the\nFigure 4. BME synergistically enhanced cisplatin-mediated cell cytotoxicity of chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. (A) XTT cell\nproliferation assay demonstrated that the growth rates of A2780cp and C13* cells were significantly reduced after treatment with\nBME. The growth inhibitory effect was more obvious when cells were treated with BME plus cisplatin, rather than cisplatin or BME\nalone. (B) Different varieties of bitter melon--Taiwanese (TW) and Thailand (Thai)--when administered with cisplatin (1.5 \u00b5g/mL),\nexerted similar synergistic growth inhibitory effects on the viability of the chemoresistant ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780cp and C13*.\n(C) BME could synergistically enhance cell cytotoxicity of taxol (1 ng/mL) in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. (D) BME displayed\nantitumor growth of an ES2 mouse xenograft tumor model. ES2 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank of female nude\nmice. On the seventh day of tumor cell injection, BME and cisplatin (3 mg/kg body weight) were intraperitoneally injected into the\nnude mice on alternate days for a total of 6 injections each. BME administration not only significantly reduced tumor growth but also\nenhanced cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, as evidenced by a smaller tumor size.\nAMPK-2 was tetracycline inducible because we have\nfound that cells stably expressing the RG mutant are unsta-\nble and lose the mutant protein on repeated passaging\n(Supplementary Figure S3, available at http://ict.sagepub.\nincreased Thr172 phosphorylation on AMPK in both WT\nand RG cells in a concentration- and time-dependent man-\nner (Figures 5A and 5B), indicating that BME activates\nAMPK via an AMP-independent mechanism rather than by\nincreasing cellular AMP or ADP (Supplementary Figure S3).\nAMPK can also be phosphorylated and activated in an Ca2+-\ndependent and AMP-independent manner by CaMKK,37 so\nwe examined whether CaMKK is involved in BME-\nmediated AMPK activation. Consistent with this, the cell-\npermeable CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 completely blocked\nThr172 phosphorylation in response to the calcium ionophore\nA23187 (positive control) as well as BME in both WT and RG\ncells (Figure 5C). On the other hand, it is known that LKB1/\nAMPK signaling is one of the most well-known upstream reg-\nulators of mTOR signaling.38 Previous findings from our labo-\nratory have shown that activation of AMPK by agents such as\nmetformin could inhibit ovarian cancer cell growth by repress-\ning the mTOR signaling pathway.35 As expected, Western blot-\nting revealed that treatment of the ovarian cancer cell lines\nFigure 5.

Representative cropped blots are presented.\nAbbreviations: BME, bitter melon extract; CaMKK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; WT, wild-\ntype, AMP-sensitive AMPK-2; RG, AMP/ADP-insensitive R531G mutant AMPK-2.\nBME for 24 hours yielded a marked reduction in phosphory-\nlation of both mTOR (Ser2448) and its downstream target\ndemonstrate that BME induces AMPK activation via the\nCaMKK pathway in anAMP-independent manner, whereas\nthe activated AMPK then impairs cell growth and ovarian\ncancer cell metabolism, at least in part, via inhibition of\nmTOR signaling.\nBME Also Suppresses the AKT/ERK/FOXM1\nSignaling Cascade\nOur previous studies have shown that pharmacological\nAMPK activators such as A23187, AICAR, and metformin\ncause inhibition of human cervical cancer cell growth by\nrepressing AKT/FOXO3a/FOXM1 signaling.19 Similarly,\nthese AMPK activators, as well as hypoxia, not only acti-\nvated AMPK but also inhibited expression of FOXM1 in\novarian cancer cells (Supplementary Figure S4, available at\nhttp://ict.sagepub.com/supplemental). To test whether BME\ncould mediate similar effects in human ovarian cancer cell\nconcentrations and varieties of BME. After treatment with\nChinese BME (1%, 5%, and 10%, v/v), the expression level\nof FOXM1 and phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and ERK\ndecreased, whereas phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172\nwas concomitantly elevated (Figure 6A). Similar effects\nwere observed in SKOV3 and OV2008 cells treated with\nThailand BME (2.5% and 5%, v/v; Figure 6B) or Taiwanese\nBME (10%, v/v; Figure 6C). Additionally, qPCR analysis\ndemonstrated that the mRNA expression level of FOXM1 in\nafter treatment with BME (5%, v/v) for 10 hours (Figure\n6D). To exclude off-target effects of AMPK activators, the\nAMPK inhibitor compound C was applied. After treatment\nwith compound C (10 \u00b5M), the expression of p-AMPK\n(Thr172) was significantly attenuated, whereas the expres-\nsion of FOXM1 and phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and\nERK were moderately increased in A2780cp cells as com-\npared with the control (Figure 6E). Thus, AMPK activation\nreduced the expression of FOXM1 at both the protein and\nmRNA levels via the AKT/ERK signaling cascade. To fur-\nther demonstrate that BME causes growth inhibition of\novarian cancer cells through activation of the AMPK sig-\nnaling pathway, the AMPK activity was specifically sup-\npressed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPK. As\nexpected, knockdown of AMPK1 (dominant isoform;\nFigure 6F) could significantly reduce the suppressive effect\nof Chinese BME (1%, v/v) on ovarian cancer cell growth\n(Figure 6G). It is important to note that the enhanced cancer\ncell growth mediated by cotreatment of Chinese BME (1%,\nv/v) and cisplatin (2 \u00b5g/mL) was remarkably reduced in\nAMPK1 knockdown cells as compared with the scrambled\ncontrol in a cisplatin-resistant cell line, A2780cp (Figure\n6G). Indeed, Western blot analysis confirmed that there was\nno reduction in the expression of FOXM1 and phosphoryla-\nAMPK1 knockdown cells after treatment with 10% (v/v)\nChinese BME for 24 hours, as compared with the vector\ncontrol (Figure 6H). These findings support our notion that\nactivation of AMPK by natural AMPK activator BME sup-\npresses the cell growth of ovarian cancer through suppress-\ning the AKT/ERK/FOXM1 signaling cascade.\nDiscussion\nBitter melon has been utilized as a hypoglycemic and anti-\ndiabetic agent in Chinese and Indian Ayurvedic traditional\nmedicine for hundreds of years.39 Emerging evidence has\nsuggested that many other dietary phytochemicals, such as\nresveratrol and curcumin have anticancer effects by target-\ning cancer cell metabolism,29,40 and the antitumor activity\nof bitter melon has recently begun to attract attention.41 For\ninstance, the crude extract from the fruits of bitter melon\ninduced cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis in adre-\nnocortical cancer cells NCI H295R42 and breast cancer\nBMEs had been documented to impede the proliferation of\nrat prostate cancer cells PLS10.43 These results suggest that\nBME not only has the ability to reduce cancer progression,\nbut also has the potential to prevent ovarian cancer devel-\nopment. In this study, we confirmed the capacity of BME\nto suppress proliferation, migration, and invasion of ovar-\nian cancer cells. Notably, BME showed no obvious toxicity\nin normal ovarian epithelial cells (HOSEs) or nude mice\nbut enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in ovarian cancer\ncells, both in vitro and in vivo. It is important to note that\nour mechanistic studies are the first to show that BME dif-\nfers from other xenobiotic AMPK activators, in that it acti-\nvates AMPK in an AMP-independent manner through\nCaMKK signaling. Such BME-mediated AMPK activa-\ntion significantly inhibits ovarian cancer cell growth by\nrepressing both mTOR/P70S6K and AKT/ERK/FOXM1\ncascades.\nWe and others have previously reported that pharmaco-\nlogical AMPK activators such as metformin impair cell pro-\nliferation of various human cancers.18,19,44 In this study, we\ndemonstrated that BME functions as a natural AMPK acti-\nvator and executes both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on\novarian cancer cells while not being toxic in normal immor-\ntalized ovarian epithelial cells (HOSEs) or nude mice (data\nnot shown). Similar to metformin, BME induces cell cycle\narrest and promotes apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, caus-\ning arrest at the G0/G1 phase and increasing the sub-G1\npopulation of apoptotic cells. Induction of apoptosis was\nalso revealed by elevated expression of other apoptotic\nmarkers, such as cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP.\nFigure 6. BME acts as a natural AMPK activator to repress FOXM1 expression via impairment of the AKT/ERK/FOXM1 signaling cascade.\n(A) Western blot analysis showing that the phosphorylation of Thr172 on AMPK was increased, whereas the levels of FOXM1 and the\nphosphorylation of AKT and ERK were reduced in ovarian cancer cell lines--that is, A2780cp and C13*--treated with Chinese BME (1%, 5%,\nand 10%, volume/volume [v/v]) for 24 hours. Representative cropped blots processed in parallel are presented. (B) AMPK was activated after\ntreatment of SKOV3 cells with Thai BME (2.5% and 5%, v/v). (C) Expression of FOXM1 was decreased significantly and phosphorylation of\nAKT and ERK was reduced after treatment of OV2008 cells with Taiwanese BME (10%, v/v). (D) qPCR analysis demonstrating that FOXM1\nwas used as an internal control. (E) Suppression of AMPK activity relieves AMPK-mediated FOXM1 inhibition. Western blot analysis showing\nthat AKT/ERK/FOXM1 signaling increased when A2780cp cells were treated by the AMPK inhibitor, compound C (10 \u00b5M), whereas the\nlevel of AKT/ERK/FOXM1 signaling decreased when A2780cp cells were treated with Chinese BME (10%, v/v). Representative cropped blots\nare presented for the 2 groups. (F) Depletion of the endogenous AMPK1 (1KD) by siRNA knockdown approach in ovarian cancer cell\nlines such as A2780cp and ES2; NC represents the scrambled control. (G) XTT cell proliferation assay demonstrated that the growth rate of\nA2780cp cells with AMPK1 knockdown was not suppressed by the treatment of BME (1%, v/v) as compared with the scrambled control.\nAdditionally, the growth inhibitory effect was more obvious in A2780cp scrambled control cotreated with Chinese BME (1%, v/v) and cisplatin\n(2 \u00b5g/mL), whereas there was no significant reduction of cell growth in AMPK1 knockdown A2780cp cells when cotreated with the same\ncondition. (H) Western blot analysis showing that AKT/ERK/FOXM1 signaling slightly increased when AMPK1 knockdown A2780cp cells\n(1 KD) were treated with/without Chinese BME (10%, v/v) for 24 hours, as compared with the scrambled control (NC).\nAbbreviations: BME, bitter melon extract; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; qPCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\nTumor metastasis and invasiveness are two very chal-\nlenging issues for ovarian cancer patients. To address the\nfunctional role of BME in ovarian cancer metastasis, we\nexamined its effect on ovarian cancer cell motility. Our find-\nings clearly demonstrate that BME markedly suppresses cell\nmigration and the invasive properties of ovarian cancer cells,\nsuggesting that BME may possess not only antitumor but\nalso antimetastatic function in ovarian cancer.\nThe differing abilities among the varieties of BME in\nsuppressing ovarian cancer cell tumorigenicity and chemo-\nresistance are another interesting finding in this study.\nKusamran et al32 have recently reported that Thai bitter\nmelon contains more bioactive substances than the Chinese\nvariety that inhibit some mono-oxygenases, displaying che-\nmopreventive potential, indicating that the presence of anti-\ntumorigenic substances in BME may vary among different\nvarieties. Indeed, numerous reports have documented that\nbitter melon contains many bioactive substances, nutrients,\nand phytochemicals, such as crude protein, minerals, and\nflavonoids, in leaves from different varieties and at different\nstages of maturity.45 Hence, its ability to activate AMPK as\nwell its antitumor activity may vary. Thus, cucurbitane-type\ncin J48 from bitter melon have all been shown to exhibit\nantitumor effects on various human cancer cells. It is impor-\ntant to note that recent studies have documented that triter-\npenoids (BMTs) such as BMT1 and BMT17 derived from\nBME possess the capacity for activation of AMPK.9,49 An\naglycone form of cucurbitane triterpenoid, cucurbitacin E,\nhas been reported to induce autophagy in human cancer\ncells through upregulating AMPK activity.50 Moreover,\nother triterpenoids such as momordicine I, momordicine II,\nkuguaglycoside G, and cucurbitacin I in bitter melon juice\nhave also showed antitumorigenic effects on pancreatic car-\ncinoma through activation of the AMPK pathway.51 These\nstudies suggest that there are potential bioactive substances\nin BME used as AMPK activators in antitumor application.\nMany conventional AMPK activators such as metfor-\nmin, berberine, resveratrol, and rosiglitazone are secondary\nplant metabolites or xenobiotics activating AMPK by sup-\npressing mitochondrial function and thus increasing cellular\nAMP to ADP and ADP to ATP ratios.52,53 In contrast, we are\nthe first to demonstrate that BME activates AMPK in an\nAMP-independent manner because it triggered Thr172\nphosphorylation equally in HEK293 cells stably, overex-\npressing either WT cells or RG cells.52 Interestingly, fre-\nquent mutations and deletions of LKB1 are found in human\ncancers,54-56 and our previous study demonstrated that loss\nof LKB1 reduced the efficacy of AMP- and LKB1-\ndependent activators such as AICAR in inhibiting tumor cell\ngrowth.57 However, CaMKK provides an alternative pathway\nto activate AMPK in an LKB1-independent manner.58 Using\nthe WT and RG HEK293 cells, we provide convincing evi-\ndence that BME activates AMPK via CaMKK-dependent\nsignaling only; this has not been reported thus far. Recent\nevidence has shown that CaMKK is highly expressed and\nmaybe used as a promising target for human cancers.59-61\nThis may provide an advantage, in that BME will activate\nAMPK and suppress the mTOR signaling cascade even in\ntumor cells lacking LKB1. Furthermore, CaMKK is\nknown to be expressed in host cells important in ovarian\ncancer, such as adipocytes.62 Adipocytes in close proximity\nto ovarian cancer cells are thought to provide the latter with\nfatty acids, supporting the growth of the tumors.63,64 It is\npossible that BME also activates AMPK in adipocytes,\nwhich is known to inhibit lipolysis,65,66 and may, therefore,\ndeprive the tumor cells of nutrients derived from these\nneighboring cells.\nAccumulating evidence has shown that the upregulation\nof FOXM1 is involved in the development of various\nhuman cancers.67-71 It is known that the aberrant activation\nof AKT and the increased expression of FOXM1 are\nremarkably associated with chemoresistance of human can-\ncers.72,73 Coincidently, we have recently reported that phar-\nmacological activators of AMPK are able to repress the cell\ngrowth of cervical cancer by targeting FOXM1 in an AKT/\nFOXO3a/FOXM1 signaling cascade.19 In this study, BME\nhas been shown to sensitize two cisplatin-resistant ovarian\ncytotoxicity. In our previous study74 and the present one, we\nclearly demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of cisplatin\nresistance of ovarian cancer cells by BME is through the\nAKT/FOXM1 signaling cascade. Moreover, our results\nshowed that activation of AMPK either by pharmacological\nactivators, by hypoxic stress, or by BME all not only reduce\nmTOR expression but also FOXM1 expression by sup-\npressing the AKT/ERK signaling pathway, thereby impair-\ning growth and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells. It\nis hoped that this targeted therapy may be able to overcome\nthe problem of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.\nConclusion\nOur findings suggest that BME not only functions as a\npotentialAMPK activator to prevent ovarian cancer progres-\nsion and metastasis but could also be used as a supplement\nto enhance the efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in\novarian carcinoma. It is important to note that BME acts\nthrough a mechanism different from that of other pharmaco-\nlogical activators of AMPK and appears to be nontoxic; it\nmay thus avoid side effects such as the lactic acidosis exhib-\nited by AMPK activators that act by inhibiting mitochon-\ndrial function, such as metformin and phenformin.\n"
