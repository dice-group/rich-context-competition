Few studies have investigated the prevalence and severity of urinary incontinence in older African American\nwomen. Comparisons of findings with those for older Caucasian women could provide important clues to the etiology of uri-\nnary incontinence and be used in planning screening programs and treatment services.\nMethods. Data are from the first wave of the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) study.A nation-\nally representative sample of noninstitutionalized adults 70 years of age and older was interviewed. African Americans were\noversampled to ensure that there would be enough minority respondents to compare findings across racial groups.\nResults. A statistically significant relationship was found between race and urinary incontinence in the previous year:\n23.02% of the Caucasian women reported incontinence, compared with 16.17% of the African American women. Other factors\nthat appear to increase the likelihood of incontinence include education, age, functional impairment, sensory impairment,\nstroke, body mass, and reporting by a proxy. Race was not related to the severity (as measured by frequency) of urine loss\namong incontinent older women.\nConclusion. This study identifies or confirms important risk factors for self-reported urinary incontinence in a national con-\ntext, and suggests factors leading to protection from incontinence. Race is found to relate to incontinence, with older African\nAmerican women reporting a lower prevalence.\nTTis well established that urinary incontinence is a common\n1.health problem among older adults. However, knowledge\naboutthe risk factorsfor developingincontinenceis incomplete,\nand the findingshave been somewhatinconsistent(1).At a min-\nimum, it is important to determine whether the prevalence of\nurinary incontinence varies across population subgroups (such\nas men compared to women, older adults compared to younger\nadults, and African Americans compared to Caucasians).\nFindings of demographic differences in the prevalence of uri-\nnary incontinence could provide important clues to the etiology\nof the condition and be used to better plan screening programs\nand treatmentservices.\nRace is known to be a strongpredictorof health status(2).For\nexample, the age-adjusted mortality rate for African Americans\nexceeds that for Caucasians (3). However,such rates may mask\nimportantinterracialdifferencesfor particularhealth conditions.\nTodate,relativelyfew studieshaveinvestigated race as a riskfac-\ntorfor urinaryincontinence.(4).\nEarlier studies suggest that urinary incontinence may be less\ncommon among African American women than Caucasian\nwomen.A large-scaleepidemiologicproject, the North Carolina\ncomponent of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic\nStudies of the Elderly (EPESE), found that African American\nwomenwerelesslikelythanCaucasianwomento reportanydiffi-\nculty holding their urine (5). [The percentages of African\nAmericanand Caucasianwomenreportingdifficulty \"mostof the\ntime\" or \"all of the time\" were very similar,however(5).]Burgio\nof whom were Caucasian), and found that Caucasian women\nwere more likely than African American women to report both\nregular and occasional urine loss. Similarly,unpublished results\nfrom the Medical, Epidemiologic, and SocialAspects of Aging\n60 yearsof ageand olderwereincontinentin the previousyear,as\ncompared with 23% of 86African American women in that age\nther supportfor findings of lowerprevalence ratesamongMrican\nAmericanwomen(8,9).Theseresultscanbe comparedwiththose\nof Bump (10),who reportedno significant racialdifferencein the\nprevalence of urinary incontinence for his clinical sample, but\nfound differences in the distributions of symptoms, conditions\ncausingurinaryincontinence, andriskprofiles.\nMost studies of racial differences in urinary incontinence in-\nvolve patient or localizedcommunity samples.These have been\ninstructive, but a national sample offers the opportunity to gen-\neralize findings.Further,comparisons of racial groups are often\nlimited by small sample sizes. The number of minority respon-\ndents in typical survey samples may be too small to produce re-\nliable prevalenceestimates. In this article,the data come from a\nnational sample of noninstitutionalized older adults that was\nspecifically designed to include large numbers of minority re-\nspondents. We compare the prevalence and severity (as mea-\nsured by frequency) of urinary incontinence among elderly\nAfrican American and Caucasian women, and investigate the\nrelationship between race and incontinence while controlling\nfor other possiblerisk factors.\nMETHODS\nThese data are from the first wave of the Asset and Health\nDynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) study. AHEAD is\na biennial survey of a cohort of noninstitutionalized people 70\nyears of age and older in the coterminous United States. It is\nfunded by the National Institute on Aging to examine the health\nstatus and economic situation of the oldest Americans. Half of\nthe core sample of persons aged 80 and older was selected from\na list of Medicare enrollees provided by the Health Care\nFinancing Administration. The other half of those aged 80 and\nolder plus those aged 70-79 were sampled using an area proba-\nbility design, with oversampling in certain areas to increase the\nnumbers ofminority respondents.\nThe data were collected from October 1993 through July\n1994. Trained interviewers from the University of Michigan's\nSurvey Research Center recorded the interviews on laptop com-\nputers. Unless a respondent requested otherwise, telephone in-\nterviews were conducted with 70-79-year-old respondents,\nwhereas face-to-face interviews were conducted with those 80\nyears of age and older. Proxy respondents were used to collect\ninformation for sampled respondents who were unable to an-\nswer the survey questions for themselves. Although issues of\ndata quality arise, the use of proxies is often preferable to ac-\ncepting the bias that may be introduced by missing information\non the frailest and most impaired of the sample population. A re-\nsponse rate of 80.4% was achieved. Interviews were conducted\nin English or Spanish. In developing the Spanish version ofthe\nquestionnaire, items were translated and then back-translated.\nThe sample consisted of 655 non-Hispanic African American\nwomen and 3,566 non-Hispanic Caucasian women. Because of\nmissing data on one or more correlates, the analyses were re-\nstricted to the 606 non-Hispanic African American women and\n3,385 non-Hispanic Caucasian women who were not missing\ndata on variables used in the analyses. Men were excluded be-\ncause of their lower risk for urinary incontinence (11), leading\nto smaller sample sizes that cannot support the multivariate\nanalysis. Racial and ethnic identifications other than African\nAmerican and Caucasian were excluded because the small\nnumber ofrespondents would not permit reliable comparisons.\nRacial identification was determined as part of the hour-long\ninterview through two questions: \"Do you consider yourself\nHispanic or Latino?\" and \"Do you consider yourself primarily\nwhite or Caucasian, black or African American, American\nIndian, or Asian, or something else?\" Every respondent who\nself-identified as Hispanic or Latino was classified as Hispanic.\nOf the remaining respondents, everyone who self-identified as\nblack or African American was classified as African American,\nand everyone who self-identified as white or Caucasian was\nclassified as Caucasian.\nUrinary incontinence was measured by asking, \"The next\nquestion may not be easy to talk about, but it is very important\nfor research on health and aging. During the last 12 months, have\nyou lost any amount of urine beyond your control?\" If the re-\nspondent indicated that she had lost urine, a follow-up question\nto assess the severity (frequency) of the urine loss asked, \"On\nabout how many days in the last month have you lost any urine?\"\nThese measures were based on questions used in the MESA\nstudy that have satisfactoryvalidity and test-retest reliability (11).\nAs a first step in the analysis, we examined the bivariate rela-\ntionships between race and the prevalence and severity of uri-\nnary incontinence. Because of the distribution of responses to\nthe severity measure, this variable was categorized into mild\n(0-6 days ofurine loss in the previous month), moderate (7-20\ndays of loss), and severe (21 or more days ofloss) incontinence.\nWe then combined these two measures into a single indicator\n(continence,mildincontinence,moderateincontinence,andse-\nvere incontinence) and investigated its relationship to race,\nwhile controlling other relevant variables. These variables in-\ncluded socioeconomic status, several suspected risk factors for\nurinary incontinence, and whether the data were self-reported\nor supplied by a proxy.\nAlthough the measurement of socioeconomic status is com-\nplicated by a number of issues (2), education (0-11 years vs\nolder women) were used as indicators of this construct. The\nsuspected risk factors for incontinence included age (70-79 vs\n80+), difficulty with one or more activities ofdaily living (no vs\nyes), sensory deficit (vision and hearing reported to be excel-\nlent, very good, or good vs hearing and/or vision reported to be\nfair or poor), history of stroke (never had vs ever had), body\nmass index (lower 75% vs upper 25% of older women), cur-\nrently smokes cigarettes (no vs yes), alcohol consumption (less\nthan once a day vs more frequent), and childbirth (zero vs lor\nmore children born). These risk factors were identified for eval-\nuation based on prior research findings.\nBecause of concerns about the amount and distribution of\nmissing data on the severity measure, we used the multiple im-\nputation method (12) to investigate the extent of bias in the\ncomplete case or listwise deletion analysis. Imputed data were\ngenerated by drawing the missing values from their predictive\ndistribution given the observed values. A variant of the joint\nmultivariate general location model was used to model the joint\ndistribution, and the missing values were drawn using the Gibbs\nsampling technique. It was also assumed that conditional on all\nthe observed values, the unobserved values were missing at\nrandom.The details of this method and the software used to\ngenerate the values are described in an article by Raghunathan\nand Grizzle (13). Analyses of the imputed data led to the same\nsubstantive conclusions as the complete case analyses using the\noriginal data set. The latter are presented here. The SUDAAN\nstatistical package (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC) was used for all significance tests in this\nstudy to adjust for the effect of the complex sampling design.\nTable 1 shows the bivariate relationships between race and the\npresence and severity ofurinary incontinence. There is a statisti-\ncally significant relationship between race and involuntary urine\nloss: 23.02% of the Caucasian women reported any incontinence\nin the previous year, compared with 16.17% of the African\nAmerican women. The severity of urine loss among incontinent\nolder women does not vary significantlyby race, however.African\nAmerican and Caucasian older women who have lost urine in the\nprevious year appear to lose urine with similar frequency.\nTable 1 also provides descriptive and comparative informa-\ntion about the sample. Statistically significant differences be-\ntween African American and Caucasian older women are found\nfor the majority of variables to be used in the multivariate anal-\nysis. The African American women in the sample were less ed-\nucated, poorer, more functionally or sensory impaired, heavier,\nTable1.Prevalence and Severity ofUrinary Incontinence in OlderWomen by Race(Percentages)*\nPrevalence\nAny incontinencein previousyear\nSeverity]\nNumberof incontinentdays in previousmonth\nCorrelate\nEducation(12 or more years)\nFinancialassets (upperone-halfof olderwomen)\nAge (80 yearsor older)\nFunctionalstatus(difficultywith 1or moreADLs)\nSensorystatus(visionor hearingis fair or poor)\nStroke(everhad)\nBodymass (upperone quarterof older women)\nCurrentlysmokes(yes)\nDrinksalcohol(daily)\nChildrenborn (oneor more)\nSourceof data (proxy)\nAfricanAmerican\nCaucasian\nSignificance\n*the unweighted sample size is 606AfricanAmerican women and 3,385 Caucasian women.

The findings\nsuggest that functional status and stroke are associated with uri-\nnary incontinence in a linear fashion. For the other variables,\nhowever, the relationships are more complex. For example, the\nfindings for education and financial assets suggest that women\nwith mild incontinence have a higher socioeconomic status than\ncontinent women, but that socioeconomic status declines with\nincreasing severity of the condition.\nTable 3 shows the adjusted odds ratios for the four-category\nincontinence variable regressed on race and the other predic-\ntors. For race, every comparison is in the direction of a greater\nlikelihood of incontinence for older Caucasian women com-\npared to older African American women (although the mild in-\ncontinence vs continence comparison is significant only at the p\n< .10 level). Other factors that appear to increase the odds of\none or more levels of incontinence relative to continence in-\nclude education, age, functional impairment, sensory impair-\nment, stroke, body mass, and reporting by a proxy.\nTable3.

Interestingly, the\nseverity of loss among the incontinent women-as assessed by\nfrequency-is not significantlydifferent for the two racial groups.\nThe present analysis cannot provide a ready explanation for\nthese findings, however. In general, racial differences in health\ncan arise from several sources. These include socioeconomic\ndifferentials; differences in medical care provision or utilization;\ngenetic factors; differences in the ways that health conditions are\ndiscussed and reported; and differences in lifestyles, health be-\nhaviors, or environmental factors that stem from cultural beliefs\nand/or racial discrimination (2,14). Because of the substantive\nfocus of the AHEAD survey,measures were not available for all\nof these concepts to allow testing ofthe various explanations.\nOne explanation that could be explored is socioeconomic\ndifferentials. A finding of better health for Caucasians relative\nto African Americans might be explained by the former group's\nbetter access to medical care or to a healthy environment!\nlifestyle. In that case, controlling socioeconomic status would\nreduce or eliminate the bivariate association between race and\nhealth status. In the case of urinary incontinence, however, the\nAfrican American women appear to be advantaged relative to\nthe Caucasian women, and this pattern was not found. Here, the\nnoteworthy finding is the greater likelihood for more educated\nrespondents to report mild incontinence vs continence. Burgio\nand colleagues (8) also found an association between education\nand incontinence, and suggested that more educated women\nmay be more willing to acknowledge this condition.\nPrevious findings regarding the relationship between age and\nincontinence have been inconclusive for older adults (15). In\nthis analysis, we found that older age is a significant predictor\nof frequent incontinence. This pattern is consistent with find-\nings from the MESA study of older adults. As respondents aged\nover the course of that study, there was a tendency for inconti-\nnent respondents to develop more severe symptoms (16).\nIn exploring the health correlates of urinary incontinence, it\nis not surprising that functional impairment and sensory deficit\nare significant factors. Earlier investigations documented a\nstrong relationship between incontinence and many types of\nmobility limitations (17,18). Stroke may contribute to difficul-\nties in locomotion and in the fine-motor coordination involved\nin toileting; and/or there could be a direct impact of stroke on\nthe neurological mechanisms necessary for urine control. Our\nfinding that a history of stroke relates to severe incontinence,\neven when functional status is controlled, supports the hypothe-\nsis of some direct impact. Moreover, the finding that proxy re-\nporting is related to severe incontinence reinforces the idea that\nincontinence is associated with poorer health status. Persons for\nwhom proxy respondents are necessary may be less healthy\nthan those who are able to self-report. It is possible that the data\nsource variable is picking up aspects of health status that were\nnot controlled by the other health variables.\nOur results are also consistent with earlier research on be-\nhavioral risks such as alcohol use, cigarette smoking, and obe-\nsity. Two previous studies showed that alcohol consumption\nwas not related to difficulty in holding urine (19), or to actual\nurine loss (6). Nor did the latter study find a relationship be-\ntween smoking and incontinence, although other results have\nsuggested that smokers are at increased risk for this condition\n(20). Of four studies examining the association between body\nmass index and incontinence, three found a significant positive\nrelationship (6,9,21). The fourth did not find a significant differ-\nence between continent and incontinent women for several\nindices of relative weight, although markedly high BMI was as-\nsociated with a positive clinical stress test (22).\nLastly, childbirth is one of the more heavily researched vari-\nables in women's incontinence. It is reasonable to suppose that\nthe strain ofpregnancy on the pelvic muscles, followed by the\ndemandsof the delivery, wouldweakenthe physical structures\nthatsupport urinecontroL Findings havebeeninconclusive, how-\never. Somestudieshavesuggested a relationship betweenchild-\nfoundtherelationship onlyamongwhitewomen(8).Ourfinding\nthatchildbirthis not a significantrisk factor may reflectthe old\nageof thewomenstudied. By age70 andolder, theaccumulation\nof chronicconditionsandimpairments thatcan contribute to in-\ncontinencemay blunt what might have been a clearer relation-\nshipin youngeragegroups. It is alsopossible thataneffectis ap-\nparent only for vaginal deliveries or only upon stress\nincontinence. The AHEAD studydoes not containinformation\nonthenatureofchildbirth, noron thetypeof incontinence.\nThis article identifiesor confirmsimportant risk factors for\nself-reported urinaryincontinence in a nationalcontext. Raceap-\npears to be among these risk factors. More research will be\nneeded,however,to fully understandthe relationship between\nraceandincontinence. Ideally, futurestudieswillbe designedto\ncollectinformationspecificto this topic.As we havenoted,the\nAHEADsurveywas not designedto be an epidemiologic study\nof urinary incontinence; as a result, our study is limited by the\nlack of data on respondents' treatment status, type of inconti-\nnence, andduration of incontinence. Furtherresearch on commu-\nnity-dwelling populationsshouldinvestigate whetherracialdif-\nferences holdacrossall typesof incontinence. Perhaps addressing\nthisissuewouldalsoclarifywhyracerelatesto incontinence sta-\ntus but not to the frequency of loss.Additionalresearch is also\nneededto determine whether the correlates of urinary inconti-\nnencevaryby race: Even withthe largeAHEAD sample,there\nwereinsufficient numbersofrespondents to studytheinteraction\nofraceandriskfactors. Moregenerally, research mustbuildupon\nanyfindings of racialdifferences to establish why theyoccurand\nwhattheyimplyforclinical practice andhealthpolicy.\n"
