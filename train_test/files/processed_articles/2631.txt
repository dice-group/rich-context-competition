Hamby, PhD\nEvidence continues to accumulate that there are seri-\nous consequences to health and well-being and soci-\nety from childhood exposure to violence and abuse.1,2\nChild maltreatment, peer victimization, and exposure to fam-\nily and community violence have been shown to be con-\nnected to developmental difficulties, problem behavior, and\nphysical and mental health effects extending throughout the\nlife span.3-6 However, the epidemiology of child victimiza-\ntion remains fragmented,7 with published studies8,9 on lim-\nited portions of the age and exposure spectrum and only oc-\ncasionally with a national scope. Controversies persist about\nthe most common forms of victimization, age of maximum ex-\nposure across type, and trends over time.10-12\nIn an effort to improve the epidemiology and make it more\ncomprehensive, the US Department of Justice and the Centers\nforDiseaseControlandPreventionhavecombinedresourcesto\nsupport a more regular and systematic national assessment of\nchildren's exposure to violence, crime, and abuse. In 2008, the\nfirst such assessment, the National Survey of Children's Expo-\nsure to Violence I (NatSCEV I), was conducted.13 The next wave\ninthisassessment,conductedin2011,hasbeencompleted.This\narticle provides updated epidemiology on the exposure of chil-\ndren to violence, crime, and abuse based on those data.\nMethods\nParticipants\nTheNatSCEVIIwasdesignedtoobtainup-to-dateincidenceand\nprevalence estimates of a wide range of childhood victimiza-\nIMPORTANCE Because exposure to violence, crime, and abuse has been shown to have\nserious consequences on child development, physicians and policymakers need to know the\nkinds of exposure that occur at various developmental stages.\nOBJECTIVES To provide updated estimates of and trends for childhood exposure to a broad\nrange of violence, crime, and abuse victimizations.\nDESIGN The National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence was based on a\ncross-sectional, US national telephone survey conducted in 2011.\nSETTING Interviews by telephone.\nPARTICIPANTS The experiences of 4503 children and youth aged 1 month to 17 years were\nassessed by interviews with caregivers and with youth in the case of those aged 10 to 17 years.\nRESULTS Two-fifths (41.2%) of children and youth experienced a physical assault in the last\nyear, and 1 in 10 (10.1%) experienced an assault-related injury. Two percent experienced\nsexual assault or sexual abuse in the last year, but the rate was 10.7% for girls aged 14 to 17\nyears. More than 1 in 10 (13.7%) experienced maltreatment by a caregiver, including 3.7% who\nexperienced physical abuse. Few significant changes could be detected in rates since an\nequivalent survey in 2008, but declines were documented in peer flashing, school bomb\nthreats, juvenile sibling assault, and robbery and total property victimization.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The variety and scope of children's exposure to violence,\ncrime, and abuse suggest the need for better and more comprehensive tools in clinical and\nresearch settings for identifying these experiences and their effects.\nSupplemental content at\njamapediatrics.com\nAuthor Affiliations: Crimes Against\nChildren Research Center, University\nof New Hampshire, Durham\n(Finkelhor, Turner, Shattuck);\nSewanee: The University of the\nSouth, Sewanee, Tennessee (Hamby).\nCorresponding Author: David\nFinkelhor, PhD, Crimes Against\nChildren Research Center, University\nof New Hampshire, 126 Horton Social\nScience Center, 20 Academic Way,\n@unh.edu).\nResearch\nOriginal Investigation\n \n \ntions.Itconsistsofanationalsampleof4503childrenandyouth\nducted over the telephone by the employees of an experi-\nenced survey research firm. Telephone interviewing is a cost-\neffective method14,15 that has been demonstrated to be\ncomparable with in-person interviews in data quality, even for\nreports of victimization, psychopathology, and other sensitive\ntopics.16-21 In fact, some evidence suggests that telephone in-\nterviewsareperceivedbyrespondentsasmoreanonymous,less\nintimidating, and more private than in-person modes16,22 and,\nas a result, may encourage greater disclosure of victimization\nevents.16Allprocedureswereauthorizedbytheinstitutionalre-\nview board of the University of New Hampshire.\nThe primary foundation of the study design was a nation-\nwide sampling frame of residential telephone numbers from\nwhich a sample of telephone households was drawn by ran-\ndom digit dialing. Two additional samples were obtained to\nrepresent the growing number of households that rely en-\ntirely or mostly on cell phones, including a small national\nsample of cellular telephone numbers drawn from the ran-\ndomdigitdialingmethod(n = 31)andanaddress-basedsample\n(n = 750). The address-based sample started with a national\nsample of addresses from the postal Delivery Sequence File.\nThese addresses were mailed a 1-page questionnaire. The ad-\ndress-basedsamplewasdrawnfromthepoolofreturnedques-\ntionnaires that represented households with children and\nyouth 17 years or younger. These households were then re-\ncontacted by interviewers and asked to participate in the\nsurvey. Approximately one-half of the eligible households ob-\ntained through the address-based sample were cell phone\u00ad\nonly households and represented an effective way to include\nhouseholds without landlines in our sample.\nProcedure\nA short interview was conducted with an adult caregiver (usu-\nally a parent) to obtain family demographic information. One\nchild was then randomly selected from all eligible children liv-\ning in a household by selecting the child with the most recent\nbirthday. If the selected individual was aged 10 to 17 years, the\nmain telephone interview was conducted with the child. If the\nselected child was younger than 10 years, the interview was\nconducted with the caregiver who \"is most familiar with the\nchild's daily routine and experiences.\"\nRespondents were promised complete confidentiality and\nwere paid $20 for their participation. The interviews, averag-\ning 55 minutes in length, were conducted in English or Span-\nish. Respondents who disclosed a situation of serious threat\nor ongoing victimization were recontacted by a clinical mem-\nber of the research team, trained in telephone crisis counsel-\ning, whose responsibility was to stay in contact with the re-\nspondent until the situation was appropriately addressed\nlocally.\nResponse Rates\nAveragedacrosscollectionmodalities,thecooperationratewas\n60%, and the response rate was 40.4%. These are good rates\nby current survey research standards23-25 given the steady de-\nclines in response rates that have occurred during the past 3\nAlthough the potential for response bias remains an impor-\ntant consideration, several recent studies29-32 have shown no\nmeaningful association between response rates and re-\nsponse bias.\nMeasurement\nThis survey used an enhanced version of the Juvenile Victim-\nization Questionnaire. This instrument obtains an inventory\nThe enhanced version of the Juvenile Victimization Ques-\ntionnaire obtained reports on 54 forms of offenses against\nyouth that cover the following 6 general areas of concern:\nsexual assault, child maltreatment, conventional crime, In-\nternet victimization, peer and sibling victimization, and wit-\nnessing and indirect victimization. Follow-up questions for\neach screening item gathered additional information, includ-\ning the use of a weapon and perpetrator characteristics, as well\nas whether injury resulted and whether the event occurred in\nconjunction with another screening event. Because different\nkinds of victimizations can occur together and can overlap by\ndefinition (eg, physical abuse by a caretaker can also be an as-\nsault with or without injury), rates reported for victimiza-\ntions in this article reflect considerable rescoring of these data\nprovided by the screening items and follow-up questions. Spe-\ncific screening items reflecting the 54 types of events are given\nin eAppendix 1, and definitions of the rescored victimiza-\ntions and aggregates are given in eAppendix 2 (Supplement).\nThe survey instrument used in the NatSCEV II included\nseveral new screening items that were not included in the\nNatSCEV I in 2008. Rates shown for the NatSCEV II reflect the\nincorporation of the new screening information in rates; how-\never, comparisons of rates with 2008 were based only on data\nfrom screening items that were used in both surveys.\nData Analysis Weighting\nThe weighting plan for the survey was a multistage sequen-\ntial process of weighting the sample to correct for study de-\nsign and demographic variations in nonresponse. Specifi-\ncally, weights were applied to adjust for (1) differing\nprobabilitiesofhouseholdselectionbasedonsamplingframes,\n(2) variations in within-household selection resulting from dif-\nferent numbers of eligible children across households, and (3)\ndifferences in sample proportions according to sex, age, in-\ncome, census region, race/ethnicity, number of adults and chil-\ndren in the household, and telephone status (cell only, mostly\ncell, or other) relative to the 2010 American Community Sur-\nvey Public Use Microdata Sample.\nResults\nTables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 give the exposure rates for 5 major do-\nmains, including assaults and bullying, sexual victimization,\nmaltreatment by a caregiver, property victimization, and wit-\nnessing victimization. Each table summarizes rates of expo-\nsure for the last year in total and broken down by sex and age.\nThey also give rates of lifetime exposure in total, by sex, and\nNational Violence, Crime, and Abuse Exposure Original Investigation Research\n \n \nfor those aged 14 to 17 years. Finally, they list changes in cur-\nrent rates compared with the NatSCEV I (2008) rates.\nAssault\nTwo of 5 children (41.2%) were physically assaulted during the\nlast year (Table 1). One in 10 children (10.1%) was injured. Sib-\nlings and nonsibling peers were common perpetrators. Also\ncommon were physical intimidation (13.7%) and relational ag-\ngression (36.5%), terminology we use instead of the more com-\nmon terms of physical and emotional bullying, which in their\ntechnical definition require a \"power imbalance\" in the rela-\ntionship between victim and perpetrator. Some specific kinds\nof assaults occurred in smaller groups of youth, including bias\nattack to 1.8%, assault by gang or group to 1.7%, attempted or\ncompleted kidnapping to 0.6%, and dating violence to 3.2% of\nyoutholderthan12years.Boysexperiencedmoreassaultsover-\nticularly disproportionate levels of assault with injury (13.0%\nsexual assault to the genitals (9.3% vs 1.0%). Compared with\nboys, girls were targets of more dating violence (4.7% vs 1.9%).\nAssault with injury, dating violence, and nonsexual assault to\nthe genitals were higher among the oldest youth (those aged\n14-17 years).

(Sexual assault excludes sexual harassment and\nincludes attempted and completed rape, plus contact sex of-\nfenses by adults and peers. It is equivalent to contact sexual\nabuse.) Rates were considerably higher for girls aged 14 to 17\nyears (the highest-risk group), 22.8% of whom experienced a\nsexual victimization and 10.7% of whom experienced a sexual\nassault in the last year. Among this group, 8.1% had reported\nan attempted or completed rape, 13.6% experienced sexual ha-\nrassment, and 12.9% were exposed to an unwanted Internet\nsexual solicitation in the last year.\nThere is considerable focus in the literature on the life-\ntime risk of sexual assault and victimization.

It was also common to have had multiple\nexposures. In total, 48.4% had more than 1 of 50 possible spe-\ncific victimization types involving direct or witnessed victim-\nExposure to one type increased the likelihood that a child\nor youth had exposures to other types as well. As summa-\nrized in Table 6, in most cases risk for an additional type of ex-\nposure was increased by a factor of 2 or 3 for a last-year expo-\nsure and somewhat more for a lifetime exposure. For example,\nhavingalast-yearassaultwasassociatedwitha2.7timeshigher\nlikelihood of sexual victimization and a 2.9 times higher like-\nlihood of caregiver maltreatment. There were no combina-\ntions for which this risk amplification did not occur.\nTrends Summary\nRatesreportedhereinfrom2011havebeencomparedwithrates\nfrom 2008, the year of the first NatSCEV, which was also based\non a nationally representative sample of children and youth\naged 1 month to 17 years.13 Comparisons are shown in Tables 1\nthrough 5. The comparisons for 5 aggregate types of exposure\n(assaults and bullying, sexual victimization, maltreatment by\na caregiver, property victimization, and witnessing victimiza-\ntion) suggest more stability than change. The percentage ex-\nperiencing any of the 5 direct and witnessed aggregate types\nin the last year fell by 2.3 percentage points, but the change was\nnot significant. Among the specific types of exposures, de-\nclines somewhat outnumbered increases, but there were only\n6 types for which decreases reached significance during the\nlast year or the lifetime. Assault by juvenile siblings (lifetime)\ndeclined, school bomb threats (last year and lifetime) de-\nclined,propertyvictimization(lastyear)androbbery(lastyear)\ndeclined, and flashing by a peer and statutory sex offense (last\nyear and lifetime) declined.\nDiscussion\nThis study reinforces numerous previous studies37-39 show-\ning that children and youth are frequently exposed to vio-\nlence, crime, and abuse on an annual basis and over the course\nof their childhoods. However, what is unique about the\nNatSCEV is its ability to provide more precise epidemiology for\nthis exposure, breaking it down by various distinct and some-\ntimes overlapping types, as well as by age and by last-year and\nlifetime rates, to suit various needs. Researchers and policy-\nmakers who want to focus on the most serious exposures can\ndo so, but so can those who want a more comprehensive pic-\nture that aggregates across types.\nTherefore, some may be most interested in the 10.1% of\nchildren and youth who are injured by violence in the course\nof a year or in those who were sexually assaulted by a known\nadult (0.5% of children and youth for the last year and 3.0%\nfor the lifetime as reported by those aged 14 to 17 years). Oth-\ners may prefer a rate for a sample that includes all physical as-\nsaults(41.2%ofchildrenandyouthforthelastyear)orallsexual\nassaults (2.2% of children and youth for the last year and 10.6%\nfor the lifetime of the older youth).\nThe comprehensiveness also allows an unusual perspec-\ntive on the degree to which some children and youth experi-\nence multiple exposures and that seem to be highly corre-\nlated. Eleven percent of youth in the sample had 6 or more\ndirect victimizations (excluding witnessing) in a single year, a\nhighly vulnerable segment of youth we have labeled as \"poly-\nvictims,\" who appear prone to distress, many adversities, and\nTable 6.

Overall, more rate\nthe changes were large enough to be detectable as significant\nwith the sample sizes available. There were significant down-\nward trends in lifetime exposure to last-year peer flashing, ju-\nvenile sibling assault, last-year statutory sex crimes, last-year\nand lifetime school bomb threats, and last-year robbery and\ntotal property victimization. According to Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation statistics,42-44 the overall trends in crime as\ntracked by reports to the police were down 4%, 6%, and 5% for\nings reported herein seem consistent with these statistics, al-\nthough the size of our survey and the precision of estimates\nare not great enough to reliably detect small changes. Per-\nhaps most noteworthy was that, in the context of continuing\nwidespread economic distress and high unemployment, there\nwere no signs of increased abuse, conflict, and aggression.\nLimitations\nReaders should also keep in mind several limitations of the\nstudy. Various factors may have prevented us from capturing\nthe full extent of exposure. The families that could not be con-\ntacted at home or who refused cooperation for themselves or\ntheir children may be the families whose children have dis-\ncrepant levels of exposure compared with the cooperating\nfamilies.Childrenmayformanyreasonsfailtodisclosealltheir\nexposures, and parents in particular may have incentive to\ncover up their children's exposures. The screening questions\nfor exposures needed to be brief and may not have included\nenough examples and details to trigger the memory of quali-\nfying experiences. Some exposures, especially over a long time\nspan, may be forgotten or may have occurred before the\nmemory capacity of some victims was well formed. Some im-\nportant types of victimization, like witnessing parental homi-\ncide, occur too infrequently in the population to be ad-\nequately counted in a survey method of this sort. Despite these\nlimitations, the approach taken by the NatSCEV is more de-\ntailed and comprehensive than that used in previous vio-\nlence exposure studies.\nImplications\nThe high rate of exposure in children and youth and the com-\nplexity and interrelationships among the types of exposure are\narguments for much more systematic, frequent, and inten-\nsive efforts to monitor the epidemiology of these problems.\nDespite the intense public attention focused on phenomena,\nsuch as clergy abuse (as illustrated by the experience in the\nCatholic church), coach abuse (as illustrated in the Penn State\ncase, University Park, Pennsylvania), and bullying (as illus-\ntrated by the suicide of Massachusetts high school student,\nPhoebe Prince), it is remarkable that there have been no reli-\nable, regular, validated data sources for tracking these prob-\nlems. No annual surveys assess the frequency of bullying or\ndating violence, no annual estimates are acquired on the total\nnumber of child molestations, and no annual data are ob-\ntained on the number of teachers or coaches who are investi-\ngated for sex offenses against children. The NatSCEV points\nto the feasibility of obtaining more coordinated and frequent\nepidemiological data about these exposures.\nThis dearth of epidemiology stands in contrast to the situ-\nation in public health, in which accurate annual estimates are\nprovided for more than 60 diseases, some quite obscure.45\nPopulation surveys track other health characteristics such as\ninsurancecoverageandtheprevalenceofasthmaandobesity.46\nCrimes, such as auto theft and purse snatching, are tracked by\nthe National Crime Victimization Survey.47 Large gaps exist in\nthe coverage of children's exposure to violence and abuse.\nGiven its importance, priority should be given to filling these\ngaps.\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design:\nFinkelhor, Turner, Hamby.\nAcquisition of data: Finkelhor, Turner.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: All authors.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Finkelhor, Shattuck.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important\nintellectual content: Finkelhor, Turner, Hamby.\nStatistical analysis: Shattuck.\nObtained funding: Finkelhor, Turner.\nAdministrative, technical, and material support:\nFinkelhor, Turner.\nStudy supervision: Finkelhor, Turner.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support:Thisprojectwassupportedby\nfromtheOfficeofJuvenileJusticeandDelinquency\nPrevention,OfficeofJusticePrograms,USDepart-\nmentofJustice.Thetotalamountoffederalfunding\nAmendment),readersareadvisedthat100%ofthe\nfundsforthisprogramarederivedfromfederal\nsources.\nDisclaimer: Viewpoints or opinions in this\ndocument are those of the authors and do not\nnecessarily represent the official position or policies\nof the US Department of Justice.\nCorrection: This article was corrected for an error\nREFERENCES\n1.
