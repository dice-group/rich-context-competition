To make such decisions, they\nwill first need population-based esti-\nmates of the prevalence and pen-\netrance of these mutations. Heredi-\ntary hemochromatosis (HH), a major\nform of iron overload disease, can serve\nas a model for making such decisions.\nHereditary hemochromatosis is a dis-\norder of iron metabolism in which ex-\ncess iron absorption leads to deposition\nof iron in multiple organs, resulting in\ncirrhosis, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, or\nhypogonadism, and can lead to early\ndeath.1 Hemochromatosis is one of the\nmost common autosomal recessive dis-\nordersamongwhitesintheUnitedStates.\nThe estimated prevalence is between 1\ning studies conducted among patients in\nprimary care settings, employed indi-\nviduals, blood donors, and other groups\ninwhichcasedefinitionsarebasedonel-\nevated levels of iron.2 A presumptive di-\nagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on\nelevatedfastingtransferrinsaturationlev-\nels.3 When predisposition to iron over-\nload is identified early in the course of\ndisease, organ failure can be prevented\nby periodic phlebotomy.4\nAuthor Affiliations: Division of Laboratory Sciences\n(Drs Steinberg, Chang, Caudill, Sampson, and Galla-\ngher), Office of Genetics and Disease Prevention (Dr\nKhoury), National Center for Environmental Health,\nand Divisions of Nutrition and Physical Activity (Drs\nCogswell and Grummer-Strawn) and Diabetes Trans-\nlation (Dr Bowman), National Center for Chronic Dis-\nease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, Chamblee, Ga; and\nDivision of Health Examination Statistics, National Cen-\nter for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, Rockville, Md (Dr McQuillan).\nCorresponding Author and Reprints: Karen K.

The prevalence estimates of the C282Y mutation in the US population are\ntation.\nConclusions Estimates of prevalence of HFE mutations are within the expected range\nfor non-Hispanic whites and blacks but the estimated prevalence of the C282Y mu-\ntation among Mexican-Americans is less than expected. Mutation data now need to\nbe linked to clinically relevant indices, such as transferrin saturation level.\nThehemochromatosisgene(HFE)has\nbeen localized to the short arm of chro-\nmosome 6 and has been identified as a\nmajor histocompatibility complex class\nI-likegene.5 Recentevidenceshowsthat\nthe protein coded for by HFE binds to\nthe transferrin receptor and reduces its\naffinityforiron-boundtransferrin.6-8 Two\nmissense mutations in HFE, denoted\nof HH among individuals of European\nmutationaccountsforanestimated50%\ntrueprevalenceremainsunknown,10%\nof the US population is estimated to be\nheterozygous for the C282Y mutation,\nwhich can be associated with increased\nlevelsoftransferrinsaturation,butwhich\nis only rarely associated with liver dam-\npoundheterozygousstate,whichisesti-\nmated to have a prevalence rate of 1.4%\nto 2.4% in populations of European\nmutationhasbeenassociatedwithasig-\nnificantly increased risk for phenotypic\nexpression of hemochromatosis (odds\nratio, 9.0; 95% confidence interval [CI],\nNo study has provided a true esti-\nmate of the prevalence of the 2 muta-\ntions within the US population. Previ-\nous prevalence estimates were derived\nfrom small, nonrepresentative US\nsamples, such as employed individu-\nas control subjects in studies compar-\ning them with patients with hemochro-\nmatosis (sample sizes ranged from\nthese studies included a large sample\nof individuals from minority groups.\nTo obtain an estimate of the preva-\ntions in the US population, we geno-\nrepresentative sample derived from the\nThird National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III)\nDNA bank.20 We then examined the\nprevalence of the 2 mutations by race/\nethnicity, sex, and age.

All estimates are\nweighted to represent the total US popu-\nlation and to account for oversampling\nand nonresponse to the household in-\nterview and physical examination. The\nsample for genotyping included phase 2\nparticipants who were 12 years or older,\nwhowerenotpregnant,andwhodidnot\nhave\"other\"listedforrace/ethnicity.Be-\ncause this sample was also used to study\nassociations between total iron-binding\ncapacity(transferrinsaturation)leveland\nHFE genotype (a study still in progress),\nwe excluded participants for whom\ntransferrin values were missing (3.7%).\nSerumironandserumferritinlevelswere\nalso obtained (in addition to transferrin\nsaturation levels, these data are not re-\nported herein). To ensure that previ-\nously masked specimens, which had\nbeen given new identification num-\nbers, remained anonymous (ie, no one\ncould link an HFE genotype to a per-\nsonal identifier in the full NHANES data\nset), it was necessary to guarantee that\nnofewerthan5individualshadthesame\nset of background characteristics (age,\nsex,race/ethnicity).Thesecommonchar-\nacteristicsconstitutedasamplingcell.Of\nthe individuals within a sampling cell\nwho did have a common set of back-\nground characteristics, we randomly\neliminated 20% or 2 of the subjects,\nwhichever number was larger.

All partici-\npants gave written informed consent for\nthe survey. Principles involved in con-\nsideration of research on the samples are\nrepresented in a previous publication.23\nThe specimens were masked, irrevoca-\nbly destroying the ability to link HFE\ngenotype to individual participants, be-\ncause informed consent did not ex-\npressly mention genetic studies (at the\ntime the survey was planned, there were\nno specific tests planned that could be\ndescribed to participants and the insti-\ntutional review board felt that a discus-\nsion of DNA would not be helpful to\nparticipants). Also, the penetrance and\nclinical significance of HFE mutations\nhave yet to be established. Finally, study\nparticipants were made aware of abnor-\nmalities in results of testing (all partici-\npants in NHANES III were notified re-\ngarding serum ferritin levels, although\nit is possible that they could have had\nHFE mutations without altered iron\nindices).\nGenotyping Methods\nSpecimens were genotyped in the Mo-\nlecular Biology Branch of the Division\nof Laboratory Sciences, National Cen-\nter for Environmental Health, Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, us-\ning genomic DNA extracted from Ep-\nstein-Barr virus\u00adtransformed cell lines.\nThe wild type (WT) and C282Y and\nH63D mutations were genotyped us-\namplification and genotyping are si-\nmultaneously performed using the ABI\nter City, Calif).\nSeparate polymerase chain reac-\ntions were performed for C282Y and\nH63D sites using primers and probes\nthat were designed using Primer Ex-\npress (Applied Biosystems) based on\npublished sequences. The H63D site\nsequences used were as follows: for-\nward primer, 5TCTTTCCTTGTTT-\nGAAGCTTTGG; reverse primer, 5\nGATCATAGAACAC; mutant probe,\nCATAGAACAC. The C282Y site se-\nquences were: forward primer, 5GGC-\nDiscrimination between alleles was\naccomplished by running allelic dis-\nlowing the manufacturer's protocol. In\naddition, all allele calls were con-\nfirmed by visual inspection of the re-\nsults of the multicomponent analysis of\nthe real-time polymerase chain reac-\ntion. We randomly selected approxi-\nmately 5% of the specimens for geno-\ntype confirmation using the restriction\nfragment-length polymorphism method\ndescribed by Lynas.27 In addition, we\nconfirmed all samples with the C282Y/\nC282Y genotype. Genotype calls, as de-\ntermined by the restriction fragment-\nlength polymorphism method, were\n100% concordant with genotype calls\nobtained by TaqMan polymerase chain\nreaction analysis.\nStatistical Analysis\nNHANES III was designed so that both\nphase 1 and phase 2 would be national\nprobability samples.

In reality, the design\neffect for this analysis may be lower or\nhigher than 1.5. Random selection\nwithin strata, for example, tends to\nlower the design effect.29\nUsing an average design effect of 1.5,\nticipants would be required to ensure\n80% power to estimate a mean (SE)\nthe expected prevalence of homozygos-\nity.

When weighted properly, these\nspecimens should be representative of\nthe US population.\nRESULTS\nBased on our results, homozygosity for\nthe C282Y mutation was estimated to\nof the total US population, and com-\napproximately 2% (TABLE 1). Among\nWTheterozygousgenotypes(C282Y/WT\nwas about 2.5-fold more common than\nthe genotype C282Y/WT. Homozygos-\nity for the H63D mutation was esti-\n2.43%) of the total US population.\nWhen we estimated prevalence of\ngenotypes by ethnic group, we found\nthat the estimate for the C282Y/\nhigher in non-Hispanic whites than in\nMexican Americans or non-Hispanic\nblacks (Table 1). The CIs for preva-\nlapped among the 3 groups, but the es-\ntimates were made on the basis of only\n1 person each in the Mexican Ameri-\ncan and non-Hispanic black groups.\nThe estimated prevalence for the H63D/\nH63D genotype was highest among\nnon-Hispanic whites and lowest among\nnon-Hispanic blacks, with estimates for\nMexican Americans falling between the\n2 previous groups. However, differ-\nences among the groups were statisti-\ncally significant only between non-\nHispanic blacks and non-Hispanic\nwhites. Prevalence estimates for com-\nwere also significantly higher for non-\nHispanic whites than for the other\ngroups. Although the C282Y/WT geno-\ntype was estimated to be significantly\nmore common in non-Hispanic whites\nthan in other groups, non-Hispanic\nwhites and Mexican Americans had\nsimilar prevalence estimates for the\nH63D/WT genotype, and both of these\ngroups had significantly higher preva-\nlence estimates for H63D/WT than did\nnon-Hispanic blacks.\nCalculations using these genotype\nfrequency data indicated that the C282Y\nmutation is estimated to be present in\n5.4% of the total US population and the\nThese percentages are slightly higher\nwhen data from the non-Hispanic white\npopulation are used in separate calcu-\nlations.\nWefoundnosignificantdifferencesin\nprevalence estimates for genotypes be-\ntween men and women when ethnic\ngroups were combined (TABLE 3).

Others\nhave estimated the prevalence of the\nC282Y/WT genotype to be approxi-\nestimate was 2.3% in non-Hispanic\nblacks. Because the C282Y mutation has\nnot been demonstrated in African popu-\nlations,34-36 haplotype analysis is likely\nto show that the C282Y mutation found\nin blacks is the result of admixture with\nthe white population, as is the case for\nC282Y mutations found in Chinese, Pa-\ncific Islander, and Australian aborigi-\ngenotype in a group of Spanish blood\ndonors was estimated to be 4.1%,13 simi-\nlar to the 3.7% for Hispanics in Cali-\nfornia,32 but slightly higher than the\nour analysis of Mexican Americans. In\na previous study, researchers found no\nmosomes from Mexican individuals,\nbut found a frequency of 3.2% in a study\nof 78 chromosomes from Spanish\nindividuals.34 That was not a popula-\ntion-based study, thus the representa-\ntiveness of the data from the 54 chromo-\nsomes regarding genetic characteristics\nof the general population is unknown.\nIt is possible that, due to population ad-\nmixture, the prevalence of C282Y is\nlower among individuals of Mexican\norigin than among individuals of Span-\nish origin. Seemingly contrary to this\nfinding, a study based on California\nhealth maintenance organization data\nindicated that phenotypic expression of\nhemochromatosis was as frequent\namong Hispanics as among non-\nHispanic whites.38 Additionally, among\nMexican Americans, the prevalence of\nelevated transferrin saturation levels, a\nphenotypic indicator of hemochroma-\ntosis, was similar to or slightly less than\nthat found among non-Hispanic\nwhites.39 Hence, it is possible that an-\nother yet undiscovered mutation ex-\nists that may explain phenotypic ex-\npression of hemochromatosis in\nMexican American populations. How-\never, the association of the C282Y mu-\ntation with hemochromatosis among\nMexican Americans has not been re-\nported.\nThe frequency of the H63D muta-\ntion among non-Hispanic whites and\nMexican Americans is similar to pre-\nviously reported frequencies of be-\ntween 6% and 30% in European popu-\nfrequency of this mutation among non-\nHispanic blacks, present at a low fre-\nquency in sub-Saharan African popu-\nlations, is probably the result of\nBecause mutations accounting for a\nlarge proportion of HH have been iden-\ntified, and because expression of the dis-\nease is preventable, the question of\nscreening healthy populations for HH\nusing genetic testing has arisen. Ex-\nperts recently reviewed the implica-\ntions of screening for these common\nmutations and concluded that popula-\ntion-based screening for HH is not ap-\npropriate because the prevalence and\npenetrance of HFE mutations and the\noptimal care of asymptomatic individu-\nals who have the mutations are un-\nknown.9 Information presented here\nrepresentsthefirstnational,population-\nbased prevalence estimate, thereby add-\ning an important piece of the puzzle\nneeded for making policy decisions\nabout screening.\nThese findings have implications for\nuse of genetic tests for HH screening.\nInformation on prevalence of the mu-\ntations among ethnic groups is impor-\ntant for targeted screening when ap-\npropriate. However, if the prevalence\nfor the homozygous genotype that has\nbeen associated with expression of dis-\nease is higher than the rate of the dis-\nease, that is, if penetrance of the ge-\nnetic mutations is low, then the positive\npredictive value of the relevant ge-\nnetic test may be low.\nResults of our study suggest that the\nprevalence of homozygosity for C282Y\namong non-Hispanic whites and for the\ntotal US population may not be equiva-\nlent to (because of penetrance, for ex-\nample) but may parallel the preva-\nlence of hemochromatosis as defined by\nelevated serum iron levels.16,40 We need\nadditional information about other ge-\nnetic and environmental factors affect-\ning expression of hemochromatosis-\nassociated mutations. We also need\nto identify new hemochromatosis-\nassociated mutations in populations not\nof European descent, such as Mexican\nAmericans and non-Hispanic blacks,\nto fully understand this relatively com-\nmon and treatable genetic disorder.\nFinally, an important step in under-\nstanding the public health signifi-\ncance of HFE mutations will be to re-\nlate these mutations to clinically\nrelevant information, such as transfer-\nrin saturation levels.41 An analysis of the\nrelationship between measures of trans-\nferrin saturation level and HFE muta-\ntions in the NHANES III population is\nin progress.\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design:\nSteinberg, Cogswell, Bowman, Grummer-Strawn,\nSampson, Khoury, Gallagher.\nAcquisition of data: Steinberg, McQuillan, Bowman,\nGallagher.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Steinberg,\nCogswell, Chang, Caudill, McQuillan, Bowman, Grum-\nmer-Strawn, Khoury, Gallagher.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Steinberg, Cogswell,\nCaudill.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Steinberg, Cogswell, Chang, Cau-\ndill, McQuillan, Bowman, Grummer-Strawn, Samp-\nson, Khoury, Gallagher.\nStatistical expertise: Cogswell, Caudill, McQuillan,\nGrummer-Strawn, Khoury.\nObtained funding: Cogswell, Bowman.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Stein-\nberg, Cogswell, Chang, McQuillan, Bowman, Khoury,\nGallagher.\nStudy supervision: Grummer-Strawn, Sampson, Gal-\nlagher.\n"
