    "reduced_content": "Diabetes is one of the most common\nchronic diseases in the U.S., having a\nprevalence of 7.5% among people\naged 20 years (1). Diabetes prevalence\nrates vary widely in different regions of the\nworld. In some traditional communities,\nsuch as those of the Mapuche Indians and\nMelanesians, diabetes is rare or absent,\nwhereas high prevalence rates are observed\nin some Arab, Asian Indian, Chinese, and\nHispanic American populations (2). In the\nU.S., diabetes is more common in African-\nAmericans, Mexican Americans, Japanese\nAmericans, and Native Americans than in\nnon-Hispanic Caucasians (1).\nType 2 diabetes accounts for 95% of all\ndiabetes. Although both insulin resistance\nand -cell dysfunction are well docu-\nmented, the molecular basis of type 2 dia-\nbetes is poorly understood (3,4). It has\nlong been considered a disorder resulting\nfrom both genetic and nongenetic influ-\nences (5). The current understanding of the\ngenetic basis of diabetes is largely restricted\nto a few distinct monogenic forms of the\ndisease with clear Mendelian modes of\ninheritance (3,4); there has been limited\nprogress in identifying specific genetic\ndefects responsible for the most common\nform(s) of type 2 diabetes, which is likely to\nbe heterogeneous and polygenic.\nThe Amish Family Diabetes Study was\ninitiated in 1995 with the goal of identify-\ning the genetic determinants of type 2 dia-\nbetes and related traits through positional\ncloning approaches. The Amish, named\nafter their original leader Jacob Ammann,\nimmigrated from western Europe (mainly\nSwitzerland) to the U.S. to escape religious\npersecution over a 50-year period begin-\nsettled in Pennsylvania. Later groups settled\nin Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. There are no\nlonger any Amish living in Europe.\nApproximately 200 of these families settled\nin Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and can\nbe considered the founders of today's Lan-\ncaster Amish community (7). Today's\nAmish population in the Lancaster area\nAll Amish are ruralites, and most earn\ntheir living by farming.

The Amish Family Diabetes Study was initiated to identify susceptibility\ngenes for type 2 diabetes. This article describes the genetic epidemiology of type 2 diabetes and\nrelated traits in this unique population.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The study cohort comprised Amish\nprobands with diabetes who were diagnosed between 35 and 65 years of age and their\nextended adult family members. We recruited 953 adults who represented 45 multigenerational\nfamilies. Phenotypic characterization included anthropometry, blood pressure, diabetes status,\nlipid profile, and leptin levels.\nRESULTS -- The mean age of study participants was 46 years, and the mean BMI was 26.9\nkg/m2. Subjects with type 2 diabetes were older, more obese, and had higher insulin levels. The\nprevalence of diabetes in the OOA was approximately half that of the Caucasian individuals who\nparticipated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (95% CI 0.23\u00ad0.84).\nThe prevalence of diabetes in the siblings of the diabetic probands was 26.5% compared with a\nprevalence of 7.0% in spouses (\ns\nquantitative traits was substantial (13\u00ad70% for obesity-related traits, 10\u00ad42% for glucose levels,\nCONCLUSIONS -- Type 2 diabetes in the Amish has similar phenotypic features to that of\nthe overall Caucasian population, although the prevalence in the Amish community is lower\nthan that of the Caucasian population. There is significant familial clustering of type 2 diabetes\nand related traits. This unique family collection will be an excellent resource for investigating\nthe genetic underpinnings of type 2 diabetes.\nE p i d e m i o l o g y / H e a l t h S e r v i c e s / P s y c h o s o c i a l R e s e a r c h\nDiabetes in the Amish\nassimilation into the surrounding dominant\nculture and are widely known for their old-\nfashioned social and technological practices\nand characteristic dress. They do not pros-\nelytize and do not allow outsiders to marry\ninto the sect. They represent both a religious\nand a genetic isolate (6). There is a high\ndegree of consanguinity in the Old Order\nAmish (OOA). Although first-cousin mar-\nriages are not permitted, on average, OOA\nmarried couples are more closely related\nthan second cousins once removed but less\nrelated than second cousins (9). Other fea-\ntures of this population include low reloca-\ntion rates, a relatively high standard of\nliving, large family sizes (average sibship\nsize 6\u00ad7), and essentially complete genealo-\ngenerations). All of these characteristics\nfacilitate the collection of large families and\nextended pedigrees for genetic studies.\nIn this initial report, we describe the\ndesign of the Amish Family Diabetes Study,\nthe genetic epidemiology of diabetes, and\nthe heritability of diabetes-related traits in\nthis unique founder population.\nMETHODS\nStudy recruitment\nSubject recruitment for the Amish Family\nThe protocol was approved by the Institu-\ntional Review Board of the University of\nMaryland. Informed consent, including\npermission to contact relatives, was\nobtained before participation. Individuals\nwith adult-onset diabetes were identified\nby door-to-door interviews and by word-\nof-mouth. Probands were defined as indi-\nviduals with previously diagnosed diabetes\nyears. The diabetic probands' first- and sec-\nond-degree family members aged 18\nyears were recruited. If another diabetic\nindividual was identified in the family (e.g.,\nan aunt or uncle), then the family was\nexpanded further to include that person's\nfirst- and second-degree relatives aged 18\nyears. The efficiency of this type of sequen-\ntial sampling strategy for genetic linkage\nstudies has been previously described (10).\nPhenotypic characterization\nStudy subjects were examined either at the\nAmish Diabetes Research Clinic in Stras-\nburg, Pennsylvania, or at their homes.\nHeight and weight were measured using a\nstadiometer and calibrated scale with shoes\nremoved and in light clothing. Waist cir-\ncumference was measured at the level of\nthe umbilicus, and hip circumference was\nmeasured at the widest protuberance across\nthe pelvis. Skinfold thickness was mea-\nsured with calipers in triplicate at 2 sites,\nthe subscapular and triceps. The ratios of\nwaist-to-hip circumference (WHR) and\nsubscapular-to-triceps skinfold thickness\n(STR) were calculated as indexes of abdom-\ninal and central adipose distributions. Sys-\ntolic (first phase) and diastolic (fifth phase)\nblood pressure were obtained in duplicate\nby use of a standard sphygmomanometer\nwith the subject sitting for at least 5 min\nand was recorded to the nearest 1 mmHg.\nAfter an overnight fast, an indwelling\nangiocatheter was placed in an antecubital\nvein. After acquisition of a fasting blood\nsample, a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test\n(OGTT) was administered. Blood samples\nwere then drawn for determination of glu-\ncose and insulin values at 30-min intervals\nfor 3 h during the OGTT. Glucose concen-\ntrations were assayed with a Beckman glu-\ncose analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,\nCA) using the glucose oxidase method\n(interassay coefficient of variation = 1.52%)\n(11). Insulin and leptin levels were deter-\nmined by radioimmunoassay (Linco, St.\nLouis, MO) (interassay coefficients of varia-\ntotal glucose and insulin areas under the\ncurve (AUCs) during the 3-h OGTT were\ndetermined with the trapezoid method.\nlevels were measured by high-\npressure liquid chromatography (interassay\ncoefficient of variation = 4.3% for low stan-\ndard and 2.5% for high standard), and the\nfasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL\ncholesterol, and triglyceride levels) was\nassayed by Quest Diagnostics (Baltimore,\nMD) (interassay coefficient of variation =\n1.6% for total cholesterol, 5.0% for HDL\ncholesterol, and 1.6% for triglycerides).\nLevels of antibodies to GAD, a marker of\nimmune destruction of pancreatic -cells,\nwere measured by radioligand-binding\nsubjects with diabetes).\nPreviously known diabetes was deter-\nmined by a self-report of diabetes and any\nof the following: 1) a single fasting venous\nplasma glucose level 7 mmol/l or a 2-h\nOGTT venous plasma glucose level 11.1\nmmol/l; 2) current treatment with insulin\nor oral hypoglycemic agents; or 3) con-\nfirmed diagnosis by a physician. Newly\ndefined diabetes was determined by the\nlack of diabetes history by self-report and\npositive OGTT results (either a fasting\nvenous plasma glucose level 7 mmol/l or\na 2-h OGTT venous plasma glucose level\n11.1 mmol/l). Impaired glucose toler-\nance (IGT) was defined as a 2-h OGTT\nvenous plasma glucose level 7.8 mmol/l\nbut 11.1 mmol/l, and impaired fasting\nglucose (IFG) was defined as a fasting\nplasma glucose level 6.1 mmol/l but 7\nmmol/l. The definitions of IGT and IFG\nexcluded subjects with diabetes.\nStatistical methods\nTo obtain descriptive details of the collec-\ntion, clinical characteristics of study sub-\njects were computed as unadjusted means\n\u00b1 SD. Means were compared using analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) (SYSTAT 8.0; SPSS,\nChicago); P values were adjusted for age\nand sex, and, where appropriate, BMI. To\nobtain unbiased estimates of the prevalence\nof diabetes and IGT in the overall OOA\npopulation, we compared age-specific\nprevalence rates in spouses of OOA dia-\nbetic probands and their family members.\nWe compared diabetes and IGT prevalence\nin the OOA with corresponding rates from\nthe general U.S. Caucasian population, as\nestimated from the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) (1). Using the indirect\nmethod of age adjustment (13), we applied\nprevalence rates obtained from the\nNHANES III to determine the expected\nnumber of diabetes cases in the OOA.\nDirect comparisons of diabetes prevalence\nbetween OOA and the NHANES III were\nthen obtained by comparing the number of\ncases observed in the OOA with the num-\nber expected if the OOA had the same age-\nspecific prevalence rates as the NHANES\nIII. The confidence interval for the ratio of\nobserved-to-expected was also calculated\ns\nwas estimated by comparing\nthe prevalence rates of type 2 diabetes\nbetween siblings of diabetic probands and\nspouses of OOA diabetic probands and\ntheir family members, adjusting for age\nwith the Mantel-Haenszel procedure (14).\nThe heritabilities of diabetes- and obe-\nsity-related traits were computed using\nstandard quantitative genetic methods (15).\nHeritability was defined in the narrow sense\nas the proportion of total phenotypic vari-\nance that could be attributed to the additive\neffects of genes. It was estimated as a func-\ntion of the covariance among all possible\nrelationship pairs in the pedigree. We simul-\ntaneously adjusted for the effects of age,\nage2, and sex. Parameter estimates were\nobtained using maximal likelihood proce-\ndures, as implemented in the SOLAR soft-\nware package (Southwest Foundation for\nBiomedical Research, San Antonio, TX)\n(16). Although it is possible to combine all\nof the study participants into a single 11-\ngeneration pedigree (17), it was not com-\nputationally feasible to perform heritability\nanalysis with such a complex pedigree\nstructure. Therefore, we combined families\nwith overlapping individuals so that the\noriginal 45 families were reduced to 8 pedi-\ngrees ranging in size from 3 to 844 individ-\nuals. Subjects with unknown diabetes status\ndue to missing data (n = 25) were excluded\nfrom all analyses, and subjects with diabetes\n(n = 109) were excluded from heritability\nanalysis of insulin. Similarly, subjects cur-\nrently taking antihypertensive medications\nwere excluded from heritability analysis of\nblood pressure. Data on HbA\n, insulin, lep-\ntin, and triglycerides were transformed by\ntheir natural logarithms to normalize the\ndata distributions.\nRESULTS -- The Amish Family Dia-\nbetes Study was well received by the OOA\ncommunity, and the participation rate was\nexcellent (80%). Of those who did not\nparticipate, the most common reasons\ngiven were 1) lived over 60 miles from the\nclinic, 2) personal reasons, and 3) debili-\ntating illnesses that precluded their partic-\nerational families were studied. The mean\nextended pedigrees formed by combining\nthese 45 families provided a very large\nnumber of relationship pairs for our genetic\nanalyses (Table 1).\nOverall, 53% of the study subjects were\nwomen. The overall frequency of diabetes in\nthis study population ascertained through a\ndiabetic proband was 11.7%. Diabetes was\nsignificantly more common in women\nalthough after removing probands from the\nsample, the prevalence in men and women\nwas approximately similar (10.5% in\ncharacteristics of OOA subjects with dia-\nbetes and IGT and/or IFG were similar to\nthose observed in other Caucasian popula-\neuglycemic subjects, those with diabetes or\nIGT and/or IFG were older, more obese,\nand had higher blood pressure and triglyc-\neride levels. Amish individuals with diabetes\nand impaired glucose tolerance also had\nhigher insulin levels than euglycemic indi-\nviduals, suggesting insulin resistance.\nTable 3 compares the age-specific\nprevalence rates of diabetes and IGT\nbetween spouses of OOA diabetic\nprobands and their family members and\nCaucasians from NHANES III (1). For the\nsake of comparison, diabetes status was\ndefined by World Health Organization cri-\nteria (20) for both the OOA and NHANES\nIII. As in NHANES III Caucasians, the\nprevalence of diabetes increased with age in\nthe OOA. Diabetes prevalence was lower in\nthe OOA across all age groups than in the\ngeneral U.S. Caucasian population. The\noverall prevalence of diabetes in the OOA\n22.4 cases would be expected among sub-\njects aged 40\u00ad74 years if the OOA experi-\nenced the same prevalence rates as the\nNHANES III. Thus, the diabetes prevalence\nin the OOA was only 0.54 times that of the\nnational rate for U.S. Caucasians (95% CI\nIGT in the OOA was 1.38 times that of\nNHANES III Caucasians (95% CI\ngroups was comparable with those of\nNHANES III (data not shown) (21).\nDiabetes was diagnosed in a total of\n109 OOA individuals. Characteristics of\nthese diabetic subjects are summarized in\nTable 4. Of those individuals, 57% were\nnewly diagnosed at our research clinic.\nApproximately 16% of the diabetic subjects\nHsueh and Associates\nTable 1--Number of pairwise relationships\namong examined subjects in the Amish\nFamily Diabetes Study\nPairwise relationship n\nHalf-sib 8\nGreat-grand\u00adavuncular 22\nFirst cousins, three times removed 25\nThird cousins, once removed 518\nData are n from 8 pedigrees consisting of 953 subjects.\nTable 2--Clinical characteristics of study subjects by diabetes status\nVariable Euglycemic IGT and/or IFG* Diabetes\nGlucose (mmol/l)\nInsulin (pmol/l)\nData are n unadjusted means \u00b1 SD. P values for BMI, leptin, waist, WHR, and STR were adjusted for age and\nsex; P values for all other traits were adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. Of the study subjects, 25 with unknown\ndiabetes status were excluded. *Of 160 subjects, 142 had IGT, 12 had IFG, and 6 had both IGT and IFG.\nP  0.001 between the euglycemic group and the IGT/IFG or diabetic groups; P  0.05 between the eugly-\ncemic group and the IGT/IFG or diabetic groups. dBP\n, Diastolic blood pressure; sBP\n, systolic blood pressure.\nwere diagnosed before the age of 35 years.\nMore than half of all previously known\ncases were on insulin (53.2%), whereas\nonly 6.4% of previously known cases did\nnot take any medications for diabetes.\nThe prevalence of GAD antibody pos-\nitivity in diabetic subjects whose age at\nrate did not differ significantly from that in\nsubjects with either normal glucose toler-\nance (6.6%) or IGT (5.6%). In contrast, the\nprevalence of GAD antibody positivity was\n50% in diabetic subjects with an age at\ndiagnosis 35 years, which is significantly\nhigher than that in nondiabetic subjects\ndance with the hypothesis that a large pro-\nportion of diabetes cases with an age at\ndiagnosis 35 years may have autoim-\nmune type 1 diabetes or latent autoim-\nmune diabetes of adults (LADA) (22), and,\ntherefore, we excluded subjects with age of\ndiagnosis 35 years (n = 17) from further\nanalyses of type 2 diabetes\u00adrelated traits.\nTo determine the magnitude of familial\naggregation of type 2 diabetes in the OOA,\nwe compared prevalence rates of diabetes\n(age at diagnosis 35 years) between sib-\nlings of diabetic probands and the spouses\nof probands and their family members. The\nprevalence of type 2 diabetes was signifi-\ncantly higher in the probands' siblings aged\nling relative risk (\ns\n) adjusted for age by the\nof IGT was similar between the 2 groups\n(23.5% among diabetic probands' siblings\nvs. 20.9% in the spouse group).\nHeritability estimates for obesity, blood\npressure, lipids, HbA\n, glucose, and\ninsulin in the Amish Family Diabetes Study\nare shown in Table 5. Heritability of both\nBMI and leptin was 42%. Heritability of the\nbody composition measures were 37% for\nwaist circumference, 13% for WHR, and\ntrations of lipids were also highly heritable,\nwith familiality accounting for 35, 50, and\n54% of variation in triglycerides, HDL-cho-\nlesterol, and total cholesterol, respectively\nfor 18 and 24% of the variation in systolic\n31% of the variation in HbA\nvalues (P =\nvariation in insulin levels during the OGTT\nAmong adult subjects, the majority of\nmen made their living as farmers (40%)\nand laborers (33%), and the majority of\nwomen identified their occupations as\nor shopkeepers, teachers, or craft makers\n(e.g., quilting) (21%). Of our respondents,\n87% said they had no leisure physical activ-\nity, and for those who did, such activities\nwere mostly walking and playing ball\n(baseball, volleyball, or table tennis).\nApproximately 42% of men reported they\nhad ever smoked cigarettes, compared with\nonly 1.4% of women. Among ever-smok-\ning men, most started smoking cigarettes\nstopped smoking in their early 20s. Less\nthan 3% of all OOA subjects reported that\nthey currently smoked.\nCONCLUSIONS -- The Amish Fam-\nily Diabetes Study was designed to elucidate\nthe genetic epidemiology of type 2 diabetes\nin a genetically well-defined founder popu-\nlation.

Based\non the association between age of diabetes\ndiagnosis and GAD antibody prevalence, it is\nlikely that both types 1 and 2 diabetes exist\nin this population. To minimize the possi-\nbility that probands for our study had type 1\ndiabetes, we required that age of diabetes\nonset in the proband be at least 35 years.\nAn unexpected result obtained from this\nstudy was the lower prevalence of diabetes\nobserved among the OOA compared with\nthe general U.S. Caucasian population. The\nobserved prevalence of diabetes among\nspouses of probands and their family mem-\nbers was only 0.54 as high as that expected\nif these individuals had experienced the\nsame diabetes risk as in the general U.S.\nCaucasian population. Interestingly, the\nprevalence of IGT in the OOA was similar to\nor slightly higher in spouse control subjects,\nas compared with the general U.S. Cau-\ncasian population. This raises the interesting\nhypothesis that the OOA may not be pro-\ntected against glucose intolerance, but fewer\nindividuals with impaired glucose tolerance\neventually develop overt diabetes. By virtue\nof their predominantly agrarian lifestyle, the\nOOA may be more physically active than the\ngeneral U.S. Caucasian population. One\nspeculation is that this relatively active\nlifestyle provides partial protection against\nconversion from IGT to type 2 diabetes.\nSeveral studies have reported beneficial\neffects of physical activity on insulin sensi-\nDiabetes aggregates in families in the\nOOA as it does in other populations\n(26,27). In this study, the prevalence of dia-\nbetes was 3.28 times as high in the siblings\nof diabetic probands than in the spouse\ncontrol group, a finding similar to that\nobserved in other Caucasian populations\n(28\u00ad30). By contrast, there was no familial\naggregation of IGT in the OOA. These find-\nings suggest that genes may be important\ndeterminants of progression of IGT to dia-\nbetes in the Amish.\nTo define type 2 diabetes genes, there\nmay be value in dissecting the type 2 dia-\nbetes phenotype into genetically less com-\nplex traits that may be more proximal to the\nunderlying pathophysiology. We observed\nmoderate heritabilities for many of these\nquantitatively distributed traits, including\nglucose, insulin, obesity, blood pressure,\nand lipid levels. The heritability estimates\nwe obtained from the Amish are in the\nrange of those reported for other popula-\ntions (Table 5).\ncessfully to map genes for simple Mendelian\ndiseases, especially those characterized by\nrecessive transmission. More recently,\nfounder populations have been used to map\ngenes for complex diseases (45,46), includ-\ning diabetes and related quantitative traits\n(47,48). To understand further the genetic\ncontribution to type 2 diabetes, we have ini-\ntiated additional studies of the OOA,\nincluding a genome scan. Because of their\nunique ancestral history, there may be\nadvantages to trying to identify diabetes\nsusceptibility genes in this population. First,\nbecause of the relatively small number of\nfounders, it is possible that a complex\ngenetic disease like type 2 diabetes will have\nequally strong genetic determinants in this\npopulation, as compared with the general\nCaucasian population, but will be attributed\nto a smaller number of genes, which should\nfacilitate their identification and characteri-\nzation. Second, diabetes susceptibility genes\npresent in the Amish are likely to be a sub-\nset of those that are relevant to the general\nCaucasian population. Third, the large fam-\nily structure characteristic of the OOA and\nthe large number of individuals for which\nquantitative trait information has been\nobtained lead to greater power because of\nthe very large number of relative pairs that\nare present. Fourth, uniformity of lifestyle\nmay minimize potential confounding effects\nof variable phenotypic expression of sus-\nceptibility genes, which would further\nenhance our ability to identify these genes.\nHowever, the use of founder populations to\nmap genes for complex disease poses spe-\ncial challenges. For example, the complex\npedigree structures can greatly complicate\nthe estimation of allele-sharing among pedi-\ngree members. In addition, once linkage is\nobserved, fine mapping may be difficult if\nlinkage disequilibrium extends over large\nregions of the chromosome. Furthermore,\nthe genetic defects identified in these pop-\nulations will need to be verified in other\npopulations to evaluate their implication in\npublic health.\nIn summary, the OOA are a genetically\nand socioculturally well-defined founder\npopulation.
