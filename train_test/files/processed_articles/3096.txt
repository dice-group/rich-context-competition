Recently WHO acknowledged an urgent\nneed to examine child obesity across countries using a standardized international\nstandard. Studies in adults find obesity and socioeconomic factors (SES) factors\nare correlated, but results are inconsistent for children. Using an international\nstandard, we examined the prevalence of obesity and compared the associations\nbetween SES factors and obesity across countries.\nMethods Data for children aged 6\u00ad18 from nationwide surveys in the US (NHANES III,\nupdated US NCHS body mass index (BMI = wt/ht2) reference to define obesity\n(BMI 95th percentile) and overweight (85thBMI95th percentile). The WHO\nrecommends an early version of the NCHS reference for international use. We\nconducted logistic analyses to examine the relationship between SES and obesity.\nResults The prevalence of obesity and overweight was 11.1% and 14.3%, respectively, in\nship between obesity and SES varied across countries. Higher SES subjects were\nmore likely to be obese in China and Russia, but in the US low-SES groups were\nat a higher risk. Obesity was more prevalent in urban areas in China but in rural\nareas in Russia.\nConclusions Child obesity is becoming a public health problem worldwide, but the prevalence\nof obesity varies remarkably across countries with different socioeconomic develop-\nment levels. Different SES groups are at different risks, and the relationship between\nobesity and SES varies across countries.\nKeywords Child, adolescent, obesity, overweight, socioeconomic status, cross-national\ncomparison\nDepartment of Nutrition and Carolina Population Center, University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill, USA.\nCorrespondence: Youfa Wang, Department of Human Nutrition, M/C 517,\nE-mail: youfwang@uic.edu\nsocioeconomic status (SES) factors and obesity, but less research\nhas used data representing large populations to examine the\neffects of these relationships on children.9\u00ad12 Sobal and Stunkard\nhave provided an excellent review of this topic.11 After exam-\nining over 140 published studies, they concluded that these\nstudies reveal a strong inverse relationship between SES and\nobesity among women in developed societies, but the relation-\nship is inconsistent for men and children. In contrast, in devel-\noping countries a strong relationship exists between SES and\nobesity among men, women, and children. It is of concern,\nhowever, that since different obesity definitions and SES\nindicators were used, the findings in different studies may not\nbe comparable.\nMoreover, it is argued that how SES and obesity are related\nis not clear. Among adults it is likely that causality operates in\neither direction.13\u00ad15 We expected that it may be easier to test\nthe direction of such a causality with studies among children\nbecause usually the SES of children is determined by their\nparents' characteristics instead of being influenced by their own\nobesity status and the related social consequences. To our know-\nledge, limited efforts have been made to systemically examine\nthe relationships between childhood obesity and SES across\ncountries using large-scale survey data.\nOur main objective is to examine the current cross-continental\nsituation of child and adolescent obesity and compare the\nrelationship between SES factors and obesity across countries\nusing an international obesity standard. We include industrial-\nized and developing countries from different continents and with\ndifferent socioeconomic development levels.16,17 Nationwide\nsurvey data collected in the early 1990s from the US, China, and\nRussia are used. The national total population was 1244 million\nin China, 268 million in the US, and 147 million in Russia in the\nearly 1990s; and their total populations account for over a\nquarter of the global population.18\nMaterials and Methods\nSubjects\nChildren and adolescents aged 6\u00ad18 years who had complete\nanthropometric and demographic data from national surveys in\neach country were included. Pregnant girls were excluded. The\nfor Russia.\nData sources\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nThe third NHANES was a cross-sectional representative sample\nof the US civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 2\nmonths. NHANES III contains data for a sample of 33 994 people,\nand it oversampled blacks, Mexican Americans, children under\n5 years, and the elderly (60 years). Detailed descriptions of\nthe sample design and operation of the survey have been pub-\nlished elsewhere.19 Standardized protocols were used for all\ninterviews and examinations. Data on weight and height\nwere collected for each individual in the full mobile examin-\nation centre through direct physical examinations. Based on\nself-reported race and ethnicity, subjects were classified into\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,\nand other four ethnic groups.\nThe China Health and Nutrition Surveys (CHNS, 1993)\nThe CHNS covered eight provinces that vary substantially in\ngeography, economic development, public resources, and health\nindicators. Anthropometric measurements were carried out by\ntrained health workers, who followed standard protocol similar\nto the US NHANES protocol developed by the US National\nCenter for Health Statistics (NCHS). Weight was measured in\nlight indoor clothing to the nearest tenth of a kilogram with a\nbeam balance scale. Height was measured without shoes to\nthe nearest tenth of a centimetre using a portable stadiometer.\nDetailed descriptions of the CHNS have been published else-\nwhere.20 The 1993 data were used. The CHNS time frame matches\nthat of US NHANES III.\nThe Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS, 1992)\nThe RLMS is the first nationally representative household survey\nin the Russian Federation. All members of more than 6400\nhouseholds from all regions of Russia were surveyed eight times\na protocol similar to the ones used in the NHANES III and CHNS\nsurveys. Detailed descriptions of the RLMS have been published\nelsewhere.21 The 1992 data were used for a better comparison\n(i.e. similar survey year) with data from the US and China.\nMeasures\nDefinition of obesity and overweight\nAdiposity was measured by using the body mass index (BMI =\nweight [kg]/height [m]2). Following WHO's recommendation,\nwe used a series of sex-age-specific BMI cut-offs to define obesity\nand overweight.22 It is important to choose a good obesity\nstandard for examining the global obesity epidemic and making\ninternational comparisons.1,4,7,8 A WHO Expert Committee\nrecommends using a set of sex- and age-specific BMI percentiles,\ndeveloped by Must and others based on the US NHANES I data\nand underweight.22\u00ad24 Specifically the WHO recommends using\nthe BMI 85th percentile to define overweight and the 5th per-\ncentile for underweight. This reference is called the `WHO/\nNCHS reference',22 and it has been widely used in the US and\nrecommends using both the BMI 85th percentile and the triceps\nskinfold thickness 90th percentile to define adolescent obesity,22\nthis has been used infrequently due to the difficulty of measur-\ning triceps skinfold thickness in large population-based studies\n(e.g. our RLMS data). Instead, many have recommended the\nuse of the BMI 95th percentile to define child and adolescent\nMost recently the US NCHS updated the old WHO/NCHS\nreference by using new data and better statistical techniques,30\nalthough the new BMI cut-offs are similar to the previous\nones. It is expected that this new reference will be accepted to\nreplace the old WHO/NCHS reference for international research.\nTherefore we chose to use the new NCHS BMI cut-offs. The\nsex-age-specific BMI 85th, and 95th percentiles were used to\ndefine overweight, and obesity respectively. Also, because the\nprevalence of obesity is very low in China, in our comparison\nanalysis we focused on overweight.\nAn alternative that we have considered is the recently\npublished `IOTF standard' proposed by the Childhood Obesity\nWorking Group of the International Obesity Task Force\n(IOTF).7,31 Our previous analysis showed that in general the\nWHO/NCHS and IOTF references produced similar estimates\nof overall overweight prevalence, although the differences are\nnoticeable for certain ages.32 In addition, recently some concerns\nhave been raised regarding the use of the IOTF standard, except\nfor its strengths.32,33 Our decision to use the WHO/NCHS\nreference allows easier comparisons between our findings and\nthose of others who have used this reference.\nSociodemographic characteristics\nSubjects were separated into two age groups: children (6\u00ad9\nyears) and adolescents (10\u00ad18 years). Self-reported urban-rural\nresidences were used. As a result the meanings of urban and\nrural residences may vary across countries. Per capita family\nincome tertiles were used to indicate low, middle, and high SES.\nFamily income data were collected at the same time children's\nBMI measurements were collected.\nStatistical analysis\nFirst, we examined the prevalence of overweight and under-\nweight in each country by age group, sex, urban/rural residence,\nand SES. For the US, to achieve national representative preval-\nence estimates, sampling weights were used to adjust for sample\ndesign effects. Next, using logistic regression models, we examined\nthe associations between obesity and SES for each country.\nSince the prevalence of obesity was low in China and Russia, we\ncombined obesity and overweight (i.e. BMI 85th percentile).\nFurthermore, we examined the associations between BMI and\nSES. For the US, in all regression analyses, sample design effects\nwere adjusted, and the effect of ethnicity was also examined. All\nanalyses were performed by using SAS Version 6.12 (SAS, Cary,\nNC, USA) and Stata Version 6.0 (Stata Co., College Station, TX,\nResults\nChildren and adolescents' main characteristics\nand BMI distribution in each country\nEach sample's main sociodemographic characteristics are\nsummarized in Table 1. On average American and Russian chil-\ndren and adolescents were taller and heavier than their Chinese\ncounterparts. We also examined the distribution of BMI among\nchildren and adolescents in each country (Figures 1 and 2). A\nclear shift of increased BMI existed across the three countries.\nThe trends were more obvious among adolescents than among\nchildren.\nThe prevalence of overweight and obesity across\ncountries\nAs shown by Figure 3, the overall prevalence of obesity and over-\nweight was high in the US (combined prevalence was 25.4%),\nlow in China (combined prevalence, 7.0%), and moderate in\nRussia (combined prevalence, 16.0%). These clearly suggest\nthat national socioeconomic development levels influence the\nepidemic of obesity. The prevalence of obesity and overweight\nand the combined prevalence of obesity and overweight by\nage, sex, and SES groups are presented in Table 2. In the US,\nTable 1 Main characteristics of each sample\nUS Russia China\na Mean (SD).\nb Body mass index.\nFigure 1 Body mass index (BMI) distribution among children\n(6\u00ad9 years) in the US, Russia and China: by sex\nFigure 2 Body mass index (BMI) distribution among adolescents\n(10\u00ad18 years) in the US, Russia and China: by sex\nFigure 3 Overall prevalence of obesity and overweight in the US,\nRussia and China\nthe prevalence of obesity and overweight among American\nadolescents was lowest in the high-income group. By contrast,\nin China the high-income groups generally were at a higher risk\nof obesity. The prevalence of obesity was higher in rural areas\nin Russia but higher in urban areas in China. Interestingly, in\nboth Russia and China, but not in the US, the prevalence of\nobesity and overweight was higher among children than among\nadolescents. The differences were especially remarkable for\nobesity.\nComparison of relationships between obesity\nand SES across countries\nSocioeconomic status was related to children's and adolescents'\nrisks of being obese or overweight (simply termed `obese'),\nalthough the relationships were different across countries\n(Table 3). In Russia urban children and adolescents were at a\nlower risk of obesity, but in China urban children and adolescents\nwere at a higher risk. Compared to the medium-income group,\nthe low-income group was at a higher risk in both the US and\nRussia, and in Russia the high-income group was also at an\nincreased risk. In China, however, high-income children and\nadolescents were more likely to be obese. Moreover our analysis\nstratified by gender indicates that in both China and Russia (but\nnot the US), boys and girls are at different risks even if they\nhave the same SES (Table 4). That is, gender is an effect modifier.34\nSobal and Stunkard suggested that research was needed to\nexamine whether the relationships change with age in children\nand adolescents.11 We tested the relationship between SES\nand obesity by age group (6\u00ad9 years and 10\u00ad18 years) for each\ncountry, and then by each year of age for American children\nand adolescents. We found that similar significant associations\nbetween obesity and SES existed in both age groups in China\nand Russia. By contrast, in the US only among adolescents (age\n10 years) did we find a reverse relationship between SES (i.e.\nincome) and obesity. Low-income adolescents were at a higher\nThe SES was not significantly related to obesity among children\nunder 10 years. The association became significant only among\nadolescents at age 12, and it became insignificant at age 17.\nTable 2 Prevalence (%) of obesity and overweight among children and adolescents in the US, Russia, and Chinaa\nUS Russia China\nObese or Obese or Obese or\nObese Overweight overweight Obese Overweight overweight Obese Overweight overweight\nChildren (6\u00ad9 years)\na Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) 95th percentile, overweight, 85thBMI95th percentile, Obese or overweight, BMI 85th percentile.\nTable 3 Comparison of relationship between obesity and\nsocioeconomic status across countries: OR and 95% CIa\nUS Russia China\na Combined overweight and obesity, defined as body mass index 85th\npercentile.

Logistic regression analysis. Age was adjusted. For the US, when\nstratified by gender none were statistically significant (P  0.05).\nMoreover, for the US consistent with many previous studies,\nwe found that ethnicity was a significant risk factor. Compared\nto whites, blacks and Mexican American children and adolescents\nwere at a higher risk for obesity and overweight; OR were 1.2\nand gender were adjusted. However, when income and urban-\nrural residence were adjusted, ethnicity became insignificant.\nThese may suggest that the SES differences across ethnic groups\nare likely the main explanation for the difference in obesity preva-\nlence across ethnic groups. We could not examine these ethnic/\nsubculture variations in China and Russia because minorities\nonly count for a small proportion of their total populations. In\nboth the Russia and China surveys, only a very small proportion\nof the subjects are from minority ethnic groups. The small sample\nsizes did not allow us to conduct meaningful comparisons.\nFinally, we examined BMI as a continuous variable, stratified\nby sex and age groups. In general, results (Table 5) were consistent\nwith the logistic regression analysis. High-income American\ngirls had lower BMI. In Russia urban girls had lower BMI,\nbut low- and high-income groups had higher BMI. In contrast,\nin China urban boys had higher BMI. Also SES effects seemed\nto vary by age groups. In the US, for example, although low-\nincome was not a significant risk factor for elevated BMI among\nchildren under 10 years, it was a strong one among adolescents\n(age 10 years). For the US we also examined the influence of\nethnicity. Interestingly, African-American girls and Mexican-\nAmerican girls were more likely to have a higher BMI than white\ngirls even when controlled for family income and urban/rural\nresidence (P  0.05). The regression coefficients and SES were\nethnicity was not a significant risk factor (P  0.05). In addition,\nsince the distribution of BMI in each sample was slightly skewed,\nwe repeated the regression analyses using natural logarithms\ntransformed BMI. The results we found were similar.\nDiscussion\nThe lack of consistent classifications in various studies makes\nit difficult to assess the global situation of child and adolescent\nobesity.1\u00ad8 To our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to\nexamine child and adolescent obesity across countries using an\ninternational standard and based on data from large nationwide\nsurveys. Overall we found that the prevalence of obesity differs\nremarkably across countries with different socioeconomic\ndevelopment levels. The combined prevalence of obesity and\noverweight was high in the US (25%), moderate in Russia (16%),\nand low in China (7%). Even though the use of different stand-\nards makes comparisons of findings difficult, previous studies\nindicate that in many other developed countries child and adol-\nescent obesity have reached levels comparable to those in the\nUS.1,35\u00ad37 In addition evidence suggests that the prevalence\nof overweight has increased to relatively high levels in many\ndeveloping countries.1 For example, in Brazil the prevalence of\noverweight among schoolchildren has tripled and increased\nchildren and 13% of adolescents were obese or overweight in\nover the use of a series of universal BMI cut-offs to define\nobesity or overweight in different populations of either adults or\ndifferent BMI cut-offs should be used for Asian and Caucasian\npopulations.33 Nevertheless, our results clearly show that child-\nhood obesity is becoming a worldwide epidemic. The remark-\nable variation in the prevalence across populations suggests that\nsocial, economic, and environmental factors are important influ-\nences on the epidemic, although it maybe also true that genetic\ndifferences across populations also play a role.5\nOur analysis shows that child and adolescent obesity is related\nto SES, although the relationships differ among these three\nTable 5 Relationships between body mass index and socioeconomic\nstatus stratified by sex and age: regression coefficients () and SEa\nMale Female\n SE P-value  SE P-value\nUS\nAll\nRussia\nAll\nChina\nAll\na Multiple linear regression analysis.

In the US low SES groups had a higher risk of obesity.\nBy contrast, in China high SES groups were at an increased\nrisk. In Russia, a transitional society that has experienced eco-\nand high-income groups were at an increased risk of obesity\ncompared to the medium-income group. One possible explan-\nation for the different SES-obesity relationship in developed\ncountries such as the US and developing countries such as\nChina is that the influence of SES on people's lifestyles such as\ndiet and physical activity may differ. Take food consumption\npatterns as an example. In China richer people have better\naccess to meat and other energy-dense foods (which are much\nmore expensive than other foods such as vegetables) than the\npoor.26 While in the US, higher-SES groups usually consume\nmore vegetables and fruits, which are less energy-dense, than\nUnlike China, where urban children were more likely to be\nobese, in Russia urban groups were less likely to be obese than\nwere rural groups. In the US no consistent rural-urban difference\nemerged. Similar to the results for China, the recent Egyptian\nnational survey found that the prevalence of overweight and\namong rural adolescents.25 These patterns are particularly\nattributable to the differences in people's access to food and\nhealth services, physical activity patterns, and social norms in\nrural and urban areas in these countries. Compared to their\nrural counterparts, urban Chinese usually have higher family\nincome, better access to food (especially meat and poultry),\npublic services such as health care and transportation. They are\nalso more likely to have sedentary lifestyles.26,42 In contrast, US\nrural and urban children and adolescents have similar access\nto food choices thanks to the well-established food production\nand distribution system. They are also likely to have similar\nlifestyles.43 In Russia, urban groups were less likely to be obese\nthan rural groups. This is probably due to that in the past\ndecade, living standards of urban groups have been seriously\naffected by the socioeconomic difficulties occurring since the\nour analysis stratified by sex and age further indicate that social,\neconomic, and environmental factors may operate through\ncomplex pathways to influence childhood obesity.\nIn general our findings regarding the relationships between\nobesity and SES are consistent with findings from many\nconducted on girls from developed societies reviewed by Sobal\nand Stunkard,11 40% found a inverse relationship between SES\nand obesity, although 25% found a positive relationship and\n35% found no relationship. The results were similar for boys.\nThe majority of the 16 studies conducted among children from\ndeveloping societies indicate a clear positive relationship.11\nMost recently McMurray and others also found that low SES\ninfluenced adolescents' body weight status in the US.44 EI-\nTawila and others found that in Egypt the prevalence of obesity\namong high SES adolescents was more than double that among\nAnother interesting finding is that in both Russia and China\nbut not in the US the prevalence of obesity and overweight was\nhigher among children than among adolescents. The differences\nwere especially remarkable regarding obesity. Further research\nis needed to investigate whether the gap is due to the differ-\nences in children's and adolescents' social and behavioral factors,\nsuch as diet and physical activity, or if it is because of the\nWHO/NCHS standard, which is based on data from the US. For\nexample, it has been well documented that thinness is desired\nin many developed societies, such as the US, and dieting is\npopular among young American females.45,46 However, `the\nbiological picture is not accurately reflected in American popular\nculture'.46 In other words, the growth patterns of American\nchildren and adolescents are not necessarily the optimal patterns\nfor other populations. Furthermore, ample evidence suggests\nthat sexual maturation is related to being fat, and adolescents in\nmany developing countries mature later than their American\ncounterparts.22,47 Therefore we suspect that by using the WHO/\nNCHS standard we might have underestimated the obesity\nproblem among adolescents in China and Russia.\nOur study has several limitations. Although the NHANES III\nand the RLMS samples are nationally representative, the CHNS\nsample is not. Only 8 of China's 31 provinces are covered. China\nis a country with large heterogenities.26,42 The CHNS sample\ncan not reflex the whole situation in China. Since the CHNS\nstudy, however, was designed to monitor nationwide trends,\nprovinces of different geography, economic development, public\nresources, and health indicators have been included. And, in\neach province, communities of different SES levels were sampled.\nThanks to the close collaboration from local health officials\nand nutritionist, plus the support of participants, the non-\nparticipation rate was very low whenever the subjects were\nidentified and invited to participate in the 1993 survey. Hence,\nwe are confident that the CHNS sample can provide good\ninsights into the SES and obesity relationship in China. In\naddition, a common weakness of the data sets we used is that\ninformation about children and their care-providers' attitudes\nand values toward obesity and children's physical activity patterns\n(except for the US sample) were not collected. As a result, we\ncould not make a further investigation about how SES may\ninfluence obesity nor to make more comprehensive comparisons\namong the three countries. Finally, this is a cross-sectional study.\nWe could not prove any causal relationship.34 Nevertheless,\nour findings provide some important insights into the child and\nadolescent obesity problem.\nIn conclusion, obesity is becoming a public health problem\ninfluencing children and adolescents in both developed and\ndeveloping countries. The prevalence of obesity varied remark-\nably across countries with difference socioeconomic development\nlevels, while within a certain population different SES groups\nare at different risks. To effectively fight the global obesity epi-\ndemic, population-based social and environmental approaches\nshould be considered.\n"
