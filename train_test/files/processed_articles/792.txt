    "abstract": "Abstract: According to data from the May 1988 Current Population Survey, 18 percent of workers\nare in firms that do not offer health insurance- The question explored here is whether the absence of\ninsurance in these firms is related to lack of supply (that is, a failure of the firm to offer the benefit\nbecause the price it faces is too high or the benefit too low) or lack of demand (that is, employees in\nthese firms would not purchase the insurance even if it were offered). Characteristics hypothesized to\naffect the supply of insurance by firms (size, rate of turnover, and union status) are found to distinguish\nwhether or not firms offer insurance. The data show near-universal acceptance of group insurance\namong employees offered the opportunity to participate. Both of these factors suggest a failure of\nsupply. However, employees in firms that do not offer insurance are young, low-wage earners who\nwork part time. These are also characteristics of workers who do not purchase group insurance even\nwhen it is offered, suggesting that many of the workers who are not offered group insurance would\nnot participate in a plan even if the supply failure were corrected. These findings have implications\nfor the effectiveness of voluntary strategies to improve access, but they also raise concern over the\nfairness to workers of mandates requiring that they purchase coverage.\nThere is widespread agreement that the problem of uninsured Ameri-\ncans is a crisis that demands attention; however, there is no consen-\nsus about the solution. Most proposals involve the expansion of\nemployment-based health insurance because about three-fourths of the\nuninsured are workers or their dependents. The proposals differ in the\nspecific strategies they employ to expand insurance, however. The choice\namong strategies depends both on their effectiveness in extending insurance\nto all the uninsured and on their fairness to all parties, but particularly to\nthe uninsured people they are trying to help.\nOne unresolved issue that affects the choice among strategies is whether\nthe existing gaps in employment-based insurance are viewed as arising from\na lack of supply--that is, a failure of employers to offer insurance--or a lack\nof demand to enroll on the part of employees. The choice among strategies\nalso depends on whether economic incentives are viewed as sufficient to\ninduce voluntary action by most firms and workers, or whether it is neces-\nsary to mandate their insurance decisions to achieve universal coverage.\nExhibit 1 uses these distinctions to classify the key strategies involved in\nSteve Long and Susan Marquis are senior economists at RAND in Washington, D.C.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

First, consider the propos-\nals that assume that the problem arises from a lack of supply that could be\ncorrected by voluntary responses to economic incentives. Examples are the\nsmall-group market reform proposals and the strategy of offering tax credits\nto small businesses to subsidize their insurance outlays.1 These proposals\nstrive to lower the price and increase the availability of insurance. They are\nbased on the recognition that small employers usually must pay higher\npremiums than large businesses pay, that they may not be able to afford to\noffer health benefits, and that sometimes small groups that include some-\none who is very ill cannot find any coverage.\nA second strategy, still based on the belief that economic incentives will\ninduce the desired behavior, assumes the view that the failure is due to\nemployees' lack of demand for insurance. That is, whether or not they are\nactually offered employment-based coverage, if they were offered it at\ncurrent prices they would choose not to enroll. This strategy provides\nindividual income tax credits or deductions to lower the effective price of\npurchasing health insurance. An example of this approach is the recent\nexpansion of the earned income credit to include health insurance premi-\nums paid to cover dependent children.2\nIt is also possible to embrace more than one strategy in a single proposal.\nFor example, the Bush administration's plan relied heavily on voluntary\nresponse to individual income tax incentives but also hoped to encourage\nlower-cost insurance products through the development of \"health insur-\nance networks.\"3\nIn contrast to the voluntary strategies, many proposals entail greatly\nexpanded regulation to assure that the formerly uninsured get covered. One\nmandatory approach requires all employers to offer health insurance to\nemployees and their dependents. If such mandates left room for a voluntary\nemployee decision to enroll, then they would be based solely on the view\nthat being uninsured reflects a failure of supply. But most mandate propos-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Moreover, most mandate proposals\ninclude some form of small-group market reform or a residual public plan,\nfurther suggesting that advocates of mandates subscribe to both hypotheses.\nCurrent examples include the well-known \"play-or-pay\" proposals, which,\nin contrast to a strict mandate, limit the burden on employment groups\nwith low wages.4 Another mandatory strategy requires that individuals be\ninsured, accompanied by tax subsidies for reasons of fairness.5 This is based\non the view that the uninsured do not demand insurance.\nA possible advantage of the voluntary approaches is that on grounds of\nfairness it can be assumed that those who participate in purchasing insur-\nance have done so willingly and therefore must have been made better off\nby their purchase. On the other hand, the mandatory strategies are more\nlikely to meet the access goal, since there is substantial concern about\nwhether economic incentives alone will suffice. Moreover, by assuring that\nthe risk is spread across both healthy and unhealthy individuals, mandates\nmay result in a product that is more affordable for high-risk individuals. But\nif the currently uninsured do not demand insurance, then mandates may\nimpose burdens on unwilling workers.\nThe purpose of this DataWatch is to investigate whether the reason some\nemployees go without health insurance is due to a lack of supply or a lack of\ndemand, using data from the May 1988 Current Population Survey (CPS)\nEmployee Benefits Supplement. These data allow us to distinguish between\nuninsured employees who are not offered group insurance and those who\nturn down an employer-sponsored plan.\nOffers Of Employment-Based Health Insurance\nOver three-quarters of all workers ages eighteen to sixty-four are offered\nhealth insurance by their employer (Exhibit 2).6 Among those offered\ninsurance, 87 percent (66 percent of all workers) participate in the plan.\nEleven percent of those eligible for an employer group plan turn it down\nbecause they have other coverage, generally through their spouse's em-\nployer. Only about 2 percent of employees eligible to participate turn down\nan employer offer and remain uninsured.\nAbout one-quarter of workers do not have access to employer-sponsored\nhealth insurance through their own employer. About 6 percent of workers\nare employed in firms that offer health insurance to employees but are not\neligible themselves. Full-time employment is a common requirement for\neligibility, and over half (54 percent) of ineligible employees work fewer\nthan thirty-five hours per week. Another 14 percent of those ineligible for\ntheir employer's health benefit plan have been with the firm for fewer than\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This\nis the group of workers that we wish to examine more closely to determine\nwhether they would elect group coverage if their employer offered it--that\nis, is this gap a failure of supply or a failure of demand?\nFirms That Do Not Offer Insurance Benefits\nHypotheses. We first examine characteristics of firms that are hypothec\nsized to influence the decision to supply insurance, to see whether there is a\ndistinction between firms that do and do not offer insurance. Firm size is the\nfirst of these characteristics. Small firms that wish to offer insurance face\nhigher premiums than large firms, and the high price may be a barrier\npreventing some small employers from offering insurance. Small firms are\noften less profitable than larger firms, and this too may be a factor in the\nability of some small firms to offer insurance.\nThere are several reasons that firms experiencing high turnover may be\nless likely to offer insurance than other firms. The firm itself benefits from a\nhealthy employee population; providing health insurance is a way for a firm\nto invest in the future health of its workers. If there is a lot of turnover\namong the workers, the returns from this investment are smaller, which\nmay affect the decision to offer insurance.8 A second reason is that frequent\njob turnover may raise the administrative cost of providing insurance and so\ndeter some firms from offering insurance. We also hypothesize that union-\nization affects the likelihood that the firm will offer insurance. Unions have\nhistorically obtained health benefits for their members and are in a stronger\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

As hypothesized, firm size is an important factor in whether the\nemployer offers health benefits (Exhibit 3). Sixty percent of those in firms\nof ten or fewer people have an employer that does not offer insurance as a\nbenefit, whereas fewer than 10 percent of workers in firms of 100 or more\npersons are in firms not offering this benefit.9 The importance of firm size in\naccess to insurance is highlighted when we focus on the 18 percent of\nworkers employed by firms that do not offer health benefits (Exhibit 4).\nOver half of these are in firms employing fewer than ten persons, and\nalmost 70 percent work for firms employing fewer than twenty-five people.\nSeasonality is one component of job turnover, and workers in industries\nwith greater seasonal employment--such as agriculture, construction, and\nretail trade--have less access to insurance (Exhibit 5). Over half of employ-\nees in the agriculture sector and one-third of employees in retail trade,\nbusiness services, and construction work for firms that do not offer insur-\nance as a benefit, whereas fewer than 10 percent of employees in transpor-\ntation, manufacturing, and government are employed in such firms.10\nA more direct measure of the effect of turnover on firms' offer of insur-\nance comes from comparing employment changes in the previous sixteen\nmonths among workers in firms that do not offer insurance with workers in\nfirms that do make such offers.11 Almost half (45 percent) of workers in\nfirms not offering insurance had at least one employment turnover in the\nprevious sixteen months, and almost one-quarter (23 percent) had more\nthan one change. In contrast, only 23 percent of employees in firms offering\ninsurance experienced one or more employment changes in the previous\nsixteen months, and only 10 percent had more than one change.\nUnionization is also an important factor in access to insurance.

Because we found near-universal acceptance of group in-\nsurance among employees offered the opportunity to participate, one might\nconclude that existing gaps in employer-sponsored insurance are not the\nresult of a lack of demand by workers but a problem of supply, especially for\nworkers in small firms. However, the picture becomes more complicated\nwhen we examine characteristics hypothesized to affect workers' demand\nfor insurance and contrast those who accept their employer's offer, those\nwho turn down the offer, and those whose employers do not offer insurance.\nThe demand factors that we examine include ability to pay for insurance\nand the price of insurance to the employee. We measure ability to pay by\nthe worker's wage and the hours of work. We do not have a direct measure\nof the price of insurance; instead we study two proxy measures. The first\nproxy is the employee's age. Younger workers use fewer health care services\nthan older workers. As a result, the expected benefits from a given policy\nare less for younger workers, and so the effective price per unit of insurance\nis higher. Thus, we hypothesize lower demand among younger workers.13\nThe second proxy measure of price is employee turnover. Turnover not\nonly increases the cost to employers, it also increases the cost to employees.\nWith a change in employment, the employee may have to meet a new\ndeductible or preexisting conditions may be excluded. Therefore, the effec-\ntive price per unit of insurance is higher with frequent turnover, and\ninsurance becomes less attractive.\nResults. The majority of workers in firms that do not offer insurance are\nlow-wage earners (Exhibit 6).14 Two-thirds of them earn an hourly wage of\nless than $7 per hour, and 41 percent earn less than $5 per hour. The wage\nprofile of those who turn down their employer's offer--especially those who\ndo so for reasons other than their coverage under a spouse's employer\ngroup--is quite similar: 61 percent earn less than $7 per hour, and 33\npercent earn less than $5 per hour. In contrast, only 21 percent of workers\nwho enroll in their own employer plan are low-wage earners.\nMany who work in firms not offering insurance and many who do not\nenroll in their employer plan are part-time workers. Among the former, 36\npercent work fewer than thirty-five hours per week; among the latter, 30\npercent work fewer than thirty-five hours. Part-time employment is much\nless common for workers enrolled in their group plan; only 10 percent of\nthem work fewer than thirty-five hours per week.\nBecause of low earnings from the combination of low wages and part-\ntime employment, those workers not enrolling in their employer plan may\nlack the resources to purchase group coverage. The similar earnings and\nhours profile of employees in firms that do not offer insurance suggests that\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Over one-quarter (26 percent) of workers in firms not offering\ninsurance are under age twenty-five, as are about one-third (32 percent) of\nworkers turning down insurance for reasons other than having insurance\nthrough a spouse's employer. In contrast, only 10 percent of workers enroll-\ning in their own group plan are under age twenty-five.\nAlmost one-quarter of employees in firms that do not offer insurance and\none-quarter of employees who turn down their employer plan for reasons\nother than coverage under another group plan experienced at least two\nemployment turnovers in the preceding sixteen months (Exhibit 7).\nAmong those who participate in their own employer group plan, however,\nless than 10 percent had two employment changes.\nWe also used multivariate methods to compare employees who work in\nfirms that do not offer insurance with those who turn down an employer\noffer and those who enroll in a group plan. Our model relates the prob-\nability of enrolling in an employer plan if offered the opportunity to do so\nwith the employee's wage, hours worked, age, number of employment\nturnovers, sex, family status, eligibility for group coverage from another\nfamily member, and firm size.15 Each of these characteristics is statistically\nsignificant in explaining the decision to accept or reject an employer offer\nof insurance.

In contrast, the predicted probability of enrollment is .91 for those\nwho do enroll in an employer plan. This result indicates a similarity in the\neconomic and demographic profiles of persons in firms not offering insur-\nance and those who turn down an offer.\nThis similarity between employees in firms that do not offer insurance\nand employees who turn down their employer plan for reasons other than\nspousal coverage suggests that lack of demand for insurance by their workers\nmay be a factor in the employer's decision not to offer health benefits. Thus,\nexisting gaps in employment-based insurance may not only be a supply\nproblem connected with the small-group market; lack of demand may also\nplay a role. In fact, when we examine firms of any size, those that do not\noffer insurance have an employee population that earns low wages, works\npart time, is young, and experiences a lot of turnover--all characteristics of\nlower insurance demand (Exhibit 8). In firms of any size that do not offer\ninsurance, roughly two-thirds of workers earn less than $7 per hour, whereas\nroughly one-third of workers are low-wage earners in any size firm that\noffers insurance. Controlling for firm size, workers in firms not offering\ninsurance are two to three times as likely to work part time as those in firms\nAbout 25 percent of workers in firms of all sizes that do not offer insurance\nare under age twenty-five, but firms that do offer insurance have only 15\npercent young workers.

This suggests that strategies to make insurance\nmore affordable to small business might fill some of the gaps. Nonetheless,\neven if all small firms voluntarily responded to lower prices, the 31 percent\nwho work for larger firms that do not offer insurance would remain without\nan offer of employer-sponsored insurance.\nBecause the problem of uninsured workers resides primarily in firms that\ndo not offer insurance, it first appears that the gaps stem from a supply\nfailure and that policy should encourage these employers to offer insurance.\nResults of several recent pilot projects offering subsidized health insurance\nto small, uninsured businesses, however, suggest that even with substantial\nsubsidies, few additional firms purchase coverage.16 Moreover, the closer\nlook provided by this DataWatch reveals that a large fraction of employees\nin firms that do not offer insurance might not participate in an employer\nplan, even if offered the opportunity to do so. They tend to be part-time,\nlow-wage workers who may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the\ncost. In 1990, for the average firm, this share was about 15 percent of the\nindividual premium, or roughly $22 per month.17\nOver half (56 percent) of the workers in firms that do not offer insurance\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Participation among eligible workers who work part time or\nearn less than $5 per hour is only 59 percent. In contrast, among full-time\nworkers who earn more than $5 per hour, 91 percent take an employer plan\nif they are eligible to participate. Tax credits or other subsidies may stimu-\nlate some additional purchase of insurance, although the average employer\nalready provides a large subsidy that many low-wage workers turn down.\nEven a combination of small-group market reforms and individual subsi-\ndies may prove insufficient to fill the current gap in employment-based\ninsurance. Clearly, the various mandate proposals can assume that the gap\nwill be filled. But what about their fairness? Mandates requiring the pur-\nchase of group insurance may place an unwanted financial burden on the\ncurrently uninsured, whose economic profile suggests that they are less\nlikely than the average worker to participate in employer-sponsored plans.\nThis research was supported by separate awards from the Health Insurance Association ofAmerica\nand the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor.

Our resulting estimate of employees\ncovered by their own employer group plan is consistent with other estimates.\n7. This underestimates ineligibles newly employed at their current firm. We classified as\nnew employees only persons who were employed at the time of the May 1988 CPS but\nreported being out of the labor force, out of work, or self-employed at the March 1988\nCPS. We could not identify persons who changed employers between March and May.\n8. Turnover is also a proxy for price to the employee and so affects supply and demand.\n9. For similar results, see Health Insurance Association of America, Providing Employee\nHealth Benefits: How Firms Differ (Washington: HIAA, 1990).\n10. These differences are due in part to differences among industries in firm size and union\nstatus. Controlling for these factors, however, industry type is still significantly related\nto the probability that insurance is offered.\n11. We measure employment changes during calendar year 1987 from responses about the\nnumber of different employers in 1987. Workers in the May 1988 sample who did not\nhave a job at the time of the March interview were attributed with one additional\nturnover; if these individuals held a job at any time in 1987, they were attributed with\nanother turnover. This proxy measure counts employer changes in 1987 and labor force\nstatus changes in 1988. It understates turnover because it does not count as turnover\n12. Some observers have pointed to sectoral shifts away from manufacturing, transporta-\ntion, and government to trade and services and to decreasing unionization as explana-\ntions for the increase in the uninsured over the past decade.

This assumes a similar distribution of ages among the employees in each firm. In\ncontrast, the cost of insurance to an employer group consisting primarily of young\nworkers might be less than the cost to other groups, making the employer more willing\nto offer insurance and the employee more willing to purchase it. However, we do not\nhave data on the average age of employees in each worker's firm.\n14. This and the following exhibits do not include the 6 percent of workers who are\nineligible for employer-sponsored insurance but work in firms that offer this insurance\nto other employees.\n15.
