The extent to which the further spread of electronic money might have\nconsequences for monetary policy depends not least on the actual demand for electronic\nmoney. Numerous studies have sought to answer this question. However, those studies deal\nfor the most part with the expected spread of electronic money in over-the-counter (OTC)\ntransactions. As far as further developments in network money are concemed, though, it\nhas not been possible to gain anywhere near as much in the way of insights. This is\nparticularly amazing since from a monetary policy perspective network money, in\nparticular, threatens the central bank's monopoly on money creation.\nAgainst this background, this paper attempts to shed more light on the future spread of\nnetwork money. It departs from the question as to the possible use of network money for\ntransaction purposes. To answer this question, the paper studies a simple model which\nincorporates the demand for different payment media as weH as their supply. In earlier\nstudies, the influence of the supply side has in many cases only been partially included.\nOn balance, the study shows that cyber money will most likely not completely substitute\nother forms of money. Rather, a specialisation of different payment media for different\ntransaction values is probable. Specialisation here means that only one payment medium is\nemployed to buy a good. Here, analogously to the use of electronic money in OTC trade,\nnetwork money is likely to assume the role of a medium of exchange used for small-value\ntransactions.\nZUS8DUllenfassung\nElektronisches Geld stellt die (vorerst) neueste Innovation im Bereich des\nZahlungsverkehrs dar.

Introduction\nThe history of money has been characterised by evolution towards more efficient forms of\nmoney in terms of (transaction) costs. Electronic money (e-money) is so far the latest\ninnovation. Up to now this new type of money has not made very deep inroads into\nGermany. At the end of 1998, there were 52 million Geldkarten, onto which electronic\nmoney can be stored, in the hands of the public. However, it must be borne in mind that the\nvast majority of those cards are eurocheque cards that have additionally been outfitted with\na Geldkarte function. At the same time the value loaded onto all cards totalled merely\nDM 113 million. By contrast, the amount of cash in circulation excluding credit\ninstitutions' cash balances was slightly more than DM 242 billion at the end of last year. At\nthat same time, software-based electronic money on the Internet issued in Germany,\nthough, had not left the pilot project phase.\nHowever, it would appear premature for monetary policy makers to conclude that there is\nno need to take action. In areport published last year, the European Central Bank: tackled\nthe issue of the possible consequences which the further spread of electronic money might\nhave for monetary policy.l The extent to which they actually will appear depends not least\non the extent of actual demand for electronic money. Numerous studies have sought to\nanswer this question. However, those studies deal for the most part with the expected\nspread of electronic money in over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Regarding further\ndevelopments in network money which can be used on the Internet, though, it has not been\npossible to gain anywhere near as much in the way of insights.\n\u00b7 This is an abridged version of Discussion paper 5/99 \"Netzgeld als Transaktionsmediurn\" of the Economic\nResearch Group of the Deutsche Bundesbank. This paper benefited frorn discussions that took place in\nworkshops with colleagues frorn the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, at the 47th\nInternational Atlantic Economic Conference in Vienna, and at the 74th Annual Conference of the Western\nEconomic Association International in San Diego. Special thanks go to Frank Browne, Harald Nitsch, Aloys\nPrinz, Franz Seitz and Juha Tarkka for their comments. I also wish to thank rny colleagues Hans Bauer,\nJohannes Clernens, Peter Schmid, Carotine Willeke and particularly Heinz Herrmann, Head of the Economic\nResearch Group of the Deutsche Bundesbank, for many ideas and nurnerous comments on earlier versions of\nthis paper. I am indebted to Frank Bickenbach for valuable suggestions, particularly for Section IV of this\npaper. Of course, all rernaining errors are mine alone.\nThis is particularly amazing since the question as to what role this fonn of money will play\nin the future has been answered nearly euphorically by followers of certain economic\nschools of thought. Those particularly deserving of mention here are proponents of\nincreased competition in the monetary sector, known as the \"free banking\" schoo1.2 1bey\nespecially hope that electronic money on the Internet will become a medium of exchange\nthat can be brought into circulation independently of the prevailing central bank monopoly\nand that will exhibit desirable quality features in the sense of a stable and efficient\nmonetary system. Titles li.ke \"'Ibe Internet and the End of Monetary Sovereignty\" serve to\nshow where the expected evolution will end.3\nBut even if no completely independent f10ws of money are generated with the help of\nnetwork money. its widespread circulation is capable of having a considerable impact on\nmonetary policy. 1be debate on what is called \"New Monetary Economics\" has recently\nbeen stimulated by the technical possibilities of innovations in payment systems.4 Based on\nthe assumption of a largely deregulated monetary sector, followers of this school of thought\nbelieve there will be a separation of different functions of money: in this system of\nseparated monetary functions, transactions will be settled by marketable assets of variable\nvalue. In that scenario central bank money may take on the role of a unit of account, if at\nall.s\nAgainst this background, this paper attempts to shed more light on the future spread of\nnetwork money. It departs from the question as to the possible use of network money for\ntransaction purposes.\nThis paper is structured as folIows: Section n starts with a definition of the concept of\nnetwork money followed by abrief description of the payment system on the Internet. The\nspecial features described in this section have an impact on the method of analysis. In\n1 See, for instance, England (1997) and the literature on monetary competition quoted therein. based on\nHayek (1977). See Pool (1998) for a critique of Hayek's proposal and for the empirical assessment for\nGermany oftbe conditions necessary for the proposal to succeed.\n4 For an overview of tbe most important tbeoretical contributions provided by New Monetary Economies. see \n\n\n\nparticular, an empirical approach seems to have little chance of success at present.\nTherefore, the microeconomic explanation of the use of various payment instruments forms\nthe centrepiece of this paper. Section III discusses, on the basis of Whitesell (1992), a\ntheoretical explanation of the transaction-related demand for different media of exchange\non the Internet. Section IV, the key chapter ofthis paper, extends the framework of Section\nIII and analyses the interaction between the supply of and demand for cyber money. The\nresulting equilibrium will provide a tentative assessment of a plausible scenario for the\nspread of network money. Section V concludes.\n11. Special features of network money\n1. Definition\n\"Electronic money is broadly defined as an electronic store of monetary value on a\ntechnical device that may be widely used for making payments to undertakings other than\nthe issuer without necessarily involving bank accounts in the transaction, but acting as a\nprepaid bearer instrument.\"6\nTherefore, if the stored units of value can only be used to pay for certain goods or services\nand if the issuer and the acceptor are identical (single purpose schemes), this is not\nconsidered electronic money. Prepaid telephone cards are one example. A further\ndistinction should be made between electronic money and products that provide electronic\naccess to standard forms of money such as sight deposits. In this area, the use of\neurocheque cards employed as debit cards has become particularly widespread in\nIn the actual area of e-money, two different product forms have crystallised so far. One is\nprepaid cards. In this context the EeB uses the term \"card-based products\" and defines\nthem as \"(...) plastic card[s] which contain[s] real purchasing power, for which the\n7 Eurocheque cards can be employed as debit cards for EFfPOS payments (either with a PIN number in an\nelectronic cash procedure or in the POZ method, i. e. point of sale without payment guarantee). Por\ninformation on developments in these forms of payment in Germany see Deutsche Bundesbank (1997) and\ncustomer has paid in advance (...).\"81be other type is \"software-based products\" which\nserve typically to transfer electronically stored value units via telecommunications\nnetworks such as the Internet.\nTbe term \"network money\" should not be regarded as synonymous with a certain type of\nelectronic money product. Although it contains software-based products, card-based\nproducts must also be included insofar as they are also employed in telecommunicatioDS\nnetworks with the help ofcard readers to make payments.9\n2. Tbe payment system in different marketplaces\nTbe use of network money as a payment instrument in (Internet) trade will also depend on\nwhat alternative payment instruments are available. This raises the question of the payment\nsystem on the Internet. For the sake of comparison, the payment system for OTC trade will\nbe briefly outlined first, without going into further detail on the individual payment\ninstruments.\n2.1. The payment system for OTC trade\nPayment instruments are usually classified according to the onset of the liquidity effect,\nfrom the point of view of the payer, i. e. the purchaser of a good or service. Tbe \"liquidity\neffect\" is defined in this context as an interest waiver, since it is no longer possible to\ninvest the funds in an interest-bearing way. To that extent, classifying different payment\ninstruments reflects an important component of the transaction costs which accrue to the\npayer: in the event of liquidity effect prior to receipt of the good, the buyer incurs\nopportunity costs in the form of lost interest income. If the good is paid for after receipt,\nthe cost calculation should take interest gains into account. In this sense, for instance, cash\nis a payment instrument which is categorised as \"pay before\". From the moment cash is\n9 Rojas (1996) makes a distinction in this context between off-Une money (- card-based network money) and\non-line money (- software-based networlc money). These terms, though, do not seem particularly weU-chosen\nas they might lead to confusion in connection with the terminology of the OTC payment system. It is true that\nthe term off-line transaction is used here. too. in connection with card-based e1ectronic money. However. this\nterm's counterpart referring to the on-lioe authorisation nccessary to use adebit card does not describe an\nalternative form ofelectronic money but is an access product instead.\nwithdrawn, i. e. even before the time of the actual purchase, its holder relinquishes the\nopportunity of collecting interest.\nBy contrast, in the case of a prepaid instrument of payment, its issuers have what is known\nas the \"float\" at their disposal. The use of a payment instrument where the liquidity effect\nsets in after transfer ofthe good involves a deferral of payment or a credit to the buyer.\nFor OTC trade the following description of the main payment instruments can be\nChart 1: Payment system for OTC trade\nFloat\npaybefore:\n- cash\n- prepaid cards\nPoint in time when a good is\ntransferred\npaynow:\n- debitcard\n- bank transfer\n- direct debit\n- cheque\nDeterrall credit\n... t\npayJater:\n- charge card I credit card\nThe categories \"pay before\", \"pay now\" and \"pay later\" each contain different payment\ninstruments the buyers have at their disposal. The classification of the various payment\ninstruments shown in Chart 1, however, is merely a rough orientation. By no means should\none conclude that payment instruments belonging to the same category will all take\nliquidity effect at the exact same time for the person making a payment. For example,\nowing to the required processing time, the liquidity effect of a eurocheque will probably be\ndifferent from that of a payment by debit card authorised on-line. The same applies to the\ndifferent liquidity effects of charge cards (where the payment is deferred until the amount\nis debited, usually monthly - with no credit option) and credit cards, provided the credit\noption is utilised. Nevertheless, the above classification illustrates the general nature of\neach payment instrument.\n2.2 The payment system on the Internet\nExisting payment instruments are used to settle some of the payment transactions executed\nvia the Internet This is only establishing access using a new medium. Moreover, there are\nin some cases already electronic equivalents of the payment instruments shown in Chart 1;\nfor some of them their (technical) implementation is just a matter of time.11 Fmally, there\nare also payment instruments specially devised for the Internet Analogously to the chart\nfor OTC trade. the payment system on the Internet can be roughly outlined as folIows:12\nChart 2: Payment system on the Internet\nPoint in time when a good is I\ntransfem:d\n______~~~Wq~t~__________+_--------.D!~f~~q~l/~g~e~daU------------~. t\npaybefore: paynow: paylater:\n- network money - direct debit - charge card I credit card I\n- electrooic cheque - debit authorisation\nprocedure\nI\nWhen applying the standard classification of payment instruments to the Internet\nenvironment, a limiting factor must be noted: owing to the medium involved here, the\nintervals between the liquidity effects of different categories are often shortened\nconsiderably. This is less so in the area of pay later instruments, which only establish\naccess via the Internet without changing the settlement periods of the issuer. By contrast,\nthe time interval between the liquidity effects of payment instruments belonging to the\nother two categories is likely to decrease. However, the specified classification still\nmaintains a certain justification in that it highlights the key features of the payment\n11 Tbe payment system on the Internet will only be briefty sketched in this report. For a more detailed\ndescription see, for instance, Furche and Wrightson (1997), Schuster, Firber and Eberl (1997), S10lpmann\n(1997) or Wei\u00dfhuhn (1998). In particular, the aforementioned literature contains exp1anations of the security\nstrategies associated with each payment instrument\n12 Here. it should be noted that not all on-line purchases ofgoods or services are paid for within this medium.\nActually. goods ordered over tbe Internet in Germany are paid for largely by invoicing or C.O.D. (Voss\n(1998\u00bb. In Chart 2, by contrast, only payment instruments wbich can be used 10 pay directIy on-line are taken\ninto consideration.\ninstruments being considered here. They, in turn, influence the costs associated with the\npayment instrument, which will be at the centre of the foHowing theoretical analysis.\nThe payment systems environment on the Internet deviates from that of over-the-counter\ntrade in that there is no anonymous, fmal, cash\u00b7like payment instrument which serves as an\nalternative to e-money. Pay before instruments are only available in the form of network\nmoney. This type ofmoney can be employed two ways:\nFirstly, software-based systems have been tested in pilot projects for quite some time\nalready (in Germany since 1997).13 At the centre of the system whose features are\nprobably most similar to those of cash is what is called an electronic purse, which is\ninstalied on the PC of the payer supported by a special type of software. It can be\nused to store electronic value units (tokens) for later use, which are loaded by the\ncustomer and certified by the issuing bank. The anonymity of the payment transaction\nis guaranteed by encryption methods which make it possible for the issuer to verify\nthe authenticity of a token submitted by a third party without the identity of the\nconsumer being revealed at the same time.l4 In addition, a further Internet payment\nsystem is being tested in Germany at present; however, it does not involve electronic\nmoney as defined by the ECB. For the consumer, though, it is similar to electronic\nmoney in terms of the need for special software as weH as its use (electronic purse).\nThis system centres on shadow accounts, \"cash containers\", held both by the payer\nand the traders receiving the payments. However, they are held not on the PC at\nhome but centrally by the issuer.ls Hence, this is not a bearer instrument.\nSecondly, there are card-based systems which allow electronic money saved on\nprepaid cards to be sent on the Internet with the help of a reading instrument linked to\nthe consumer's PC.\n13 For the German pilot project see Blakowski, G, C. Blum and C.A. Gerlof (1997). \n\n14 On the method ofblind signature used in this context see Chaum (1997). On further details ofthe system, \n\n\n\nFrom today's perspective it is unclear whether one of the two types of e-money products\nwill eventually prevail on the Internet and which ODe will do so. The card-based variant is\nsupported, in particular, by the fact that it can also be used in OTC trade.16 By contrast, the\nsecurity technology presently available seems to favour the software-based type of network\nIn the category of Internet payments that take place simultaneously with the transfer of the\ngood, there are basically several electroDic types ofconventional payment instruments: they\ninclude not only the electronic (collection-only) cheque procedurel8, but also electroDic\ndirect debiting. However. the aforementioned systems are at different stages of\ndevelopment. Moreover. they are not available to all Internet purchasers - depending on\nthe regulatory stance regarding contracts signed electroDically. The problem these payment\ninstruments generally share is the legally binding nature ofelectronic signatures. To use the\nprocedures belonging to this group, generally both sides of the market need a special\nsoftware with which the payment is automatically executed. The security of the instruments\ndescribed depends on whatever encryption methods are used when transmitting the data.\nAs regards the pay later methods of payment on the Internet, in addition to the unsecure\nexchange of information necessary for payment transactions (such as credit card numbers)\nbetween the purchaser and the trader, there are mainly two basic models of a secure\nsystem:\nFirstly, there are systems where the data required for the transaction are encrypted\nbefore being sent. A special software installed on the participating computers is used\nfor encryption.l9\n\n\n\n19 The development of SET (Secure Electronic Transaction) could set an open standard for the encrypted \n\ntransmission of confidential information through open nctwodcs. It is true that this standard is suited 10 the\nsecure transmission of information. very gencrally speakina. How.:ver, since this communication standard\nwas developed at the urging of credit card companies. it is especially likely 10 be used for credit card\ntransactions on the InterneL See. tor instance, Judt, B\u00f6denauer and Andlinger (1998), p. 774. However, it\nmust be noted that SET by no means represents a complete paymeot system. See. for instance. Stolpmann\nThe second model is a debiting system linked to different types of assets \nanalogous to the charge card principle. These are payment instruments where the\noperator has a binding contractual relationship with both consumers and traders. The\ntrader receives payment from the operator of the system and the consumer receives a\nbulk invoice at regular intervals. Payment can then be made either by credit card or\nby directly debiting the amount from a sight-deposit account. If the payment is linked\nto a credit card, the settlement described here can be regarded as a secure procedure\ninsofar as there is no need to pass on confidential card information over the Internet\nfor individual transactions. Rather, this information only has to be transmitted once,\nsuch as in the application sent to the system operator along secure communication\nchannels, i. e. by phone or maiI. Besides being used for payments in closed systems,\nsuch as, and in particular, shopping malls, this method of making payments secure\ncan be used in general for credit card transactions on the Internet, too.10\n3. The analytic approach\nRecent studies have tackled the issue of what consequences electronic money will entail for\nmonetary policy. The vast majority of both the empirical and the theoretical studies,\nhowever, refer implicitlY or explicitly to the use of electronic money in the form of prepaid\ncards for over-the-counter trade, whereas up to now the issue of network money has not\nbeen studied as intensively.\nMost studies focus on the role that electronic money is likely to playas a payment\ninstrument in the future. 'Ibis approach will be followed here, too. As opposed to network\nmoney, though, the use of e-money in over-the-counter trade is foreseeable, not least\nbecause there is already experience with systems introduced on the market. There is not\nmuch dispute conceming the fact that primarily cash will be substituted as a payment\n(1997), p. 74. Instead, the SET protocol is to be integrated into the payment system software, which is then \n\naccessed during the payment transaction by the parties involved. \n\n\ninstrument for low-priced goods, even if there is less agreement about the expected extent\nof the substitution process and its importance to monetary policy.21 22\nBy contrast, from today's perspective, the empirical evidence of the actual use of network\nmoney, such as for low-value payments. is insufficient As mentioned earlier, the use of\nnetwork money issued in Gennany is still in the pilot project stage. To that extent,\ntherefore, one cannot rule out the possibility that in future nearly the entire spectrum of\nInternet transactions will be paid with network money.\nFurthermore, the payment system in which network money is taking up position is different\nfrom that of over-the-counter trade in tbat there is not necessarily a satisfactory solution\napplicable to all transactions, particularly to trade in low-priced goods. For example, there\nis no fmal payment medium that is comparable with cash. In that case, network money,\nhowever, would not just be a substitute but also a complement within the payment system\nonce a new market is opened up by network money. In addition, a further dynamic\ndevelopment of trade on the Internet is expected, which means we would be ill-advised to\nbase our analysis on the existing volume of transactions. Thus, the scope of a discussion\ndealing solely with the substitution of existing payment instruments by e-money would\ninevitably be too limited.\nTherefore, a more fundamental approach has been chosen here: against the background of\nthe theoretical discussion conceming the demand for and the supply of different Media of\nII See, for instance, Alejano and Pe\u00fcalosa (1998) for calculations of the cash substitution to be expected in\nSpain. Boeschoten and Hebbink (1996) cak:ulafe tbe expected spread ofelecb'Onic money in over-the-counter\ntrade in the G-IO countries. See also JaDSSOD and Lange (1998) for similar calcu1ations for Gennany.\nThe aforementioned calculations an: based, inter alia. on assumptions conceming the processes of\nsubstitution to be expected between prepaid cards a:nd established payment instruments. particularly cash. If it\nmay be assumed that electronic money in OTC trade will be in a well-defined ratio to the cash substituted,\nthen the contraction of the demand for cash can be calculated based on a plausible average amount of e\nmoney per prepaid card. For example, given an equal velocity ofcirculation ofelectronic money and cash. the\nformer would substitute the latter to the same extent. However. the velocity ofcirculation ofelecb'Onic money\nis likely to be bigher than that of traditional forms ofmoney. See Ruckriegel and Seitz (1999), p. 233. As an\nalternative. assumptions on the probable replacement ofcertain denominations ofcash or a careful analysis of\nthe frequency of certain payment amounts may serve as a basis for benchmark scenarios regarding the\nsubstitution ofcash.\n22 See. for instance. Bank for International SeUlemeDlS (1996). Berentsen (1998). European Central Bank\n(1998) or S\u00f6llner and Wilfert (1996) for an overview of possible monetary policy consequences of\nwidespread cash substitution byelecb'Onic money.\nexchange, the objective of this study is to ascertain which role network money can play in\npayments on the Internet of non-banks in future. Other authors take a similar approach by\nusing microeconomic models grounded in the transactions motive of holding money as a\nbasis for gaining further insights into the spread of electronic money to be expected. The\ntwo groundbreaking papers on this subject were written by Whitesell (1992) and\nSantomero and Seater (1996). The latter paper, though, analyses only the demand for\nvarious payment media. Based on an extension of Whitesell (1992), Folkertsma and\nHebbink (1998) examine the behaviour of purchasers of a good or service when choosing\nwhich payment instrument to use as weIl as the consequences for the use of electronic\nmoney. Shy and Tarkka (1998), by contrast, study a model which takes into account the\ndecision-making problems of all parties involved, including purchasers, issuers of prepaid\ncards and traders. The aforementioned papers, though, are all restricted to an analysis of\npayments in OTC trade. By contrast, Prinz (1999) explicitly studies the potential spread of\nnetwork money by applying a Lancaster approach to the problem faced by the purchaser of\na good or service in trying to decide which payment medium to use.\nThe model introduced in Section IV differs from the cited literature insofar as it, for one\nthing, explicitly tackles the problem of the future spread of electronic money on the\nInternet. For another, the analysis is not limited to the payer's decision between different\npayment media. Rather, the behaviour of payment services providers is also included.\nIII. Whitesell's model or the demand ror different payment media\nOnly recently has the issue of using different forms of money for transaction purposes been\nstudied more closely from a theoretical perspective. In addition to the inventory theoretic\napproach by Santomero and Seater (1996), which is based on Baumol (1952) and Tobin\n(1956), the model developed by Whitesell (1992) provides a theoretically substantiated\nexplanation of the demand for different payment media.\nOne characteristic of Whitesell's model compared to that of Santomero and Seater is a\nmore differentiated cost structure. To that extent it can be understood as a formalisation of\nthe widespread assertion to be found in the literature on e-money that the costs entailed by\ncyber money are likely to have a decisive influence on its future. There are now aseries of\npapers that analyse the costs and benefits of network money to those involved.13 Another\nthing is that the underlying cash-in-advance condition as a determinant of money demand,\nwhich results in the individual decision-making problem being, relatively speaking, less\ncomplex than in the inventory theoretic approach, implies a clearer relationship between\nthe costs and the use of the various payment media. Therefore, in the following the\nWhiteseIl model will fonn the basis for taking a closer look at the demand for different\npayment media on the Internet.\nThe framework of Whitesell's model is as follows:\n\u00b7 The individual's problem consists only in minimising the costs of predetennined\npurchases of goods. The individual receives a fixed income which is distributed evenly\n(Y for each value of transactions) across the range of goods, i.e. the same amount is\nspent on each type of good. The goods are distinguishable by their different prices (Pi ).\nInstead of looking at different transaction volumes, the approach looks at varying\ntransaction frequencies n,. These are an inverse function of the transaction values: the\nhigher the price of a given good, the less frequently it will be bought during the one\nperiod considered here.\n\u00b7 One period is being observed here. At the beginning of the period, similarly to other\ncash-in-advance models, the decision on assets has to be taken. The transactions are\nsettled at the end of the period.14\n\u00b7 The original model examines three different payment media - cash, cheques and credit\ncards in OTC trade - specifying the costs they each entail. Basically a similar approach\nis possible for Internet trade and will be used in this section for the optimisation\nproblem faced by the purchaser of a good or service. Thus, electronic cheque\n23 On the cost-benefit structure of e-mooey and its significance, see, for instance, BOschgen (I998b),\n14 As opposed to an inventory tbeoretic approach, in the Whitesell m<XIel transaction costs are minimised not\nby determining the withdrawals during the period but only by choosing the Media of exchange once at the\nbeginning of the period. Folkertsma and Hebbink (1998), however, have shown that incorporating the\ninventory approach into Whitesell's modeJ is bolb possibJe and worthwbile. However, it does not alter the\nbasic structure of the tindings.\nprocedures, payment (in a secure or encrypted way) by credit card and cyber money will\nbe examined here.2S\nFollowing Whitesell, the costs to the purchaser which each medium of exchange entails are\nspecified as follows:\nCosts per\ntransaction\nTransaction costs per\nI\nperiod per type of good n\nOpportunity costs\nperperiod per type of good n\nCybermonev (PE )+kp (PEn)+kY (r-rE)Y\nElectronic cheque Ps psn (r-rD)Y\nCredit card 1 n\n.\nHere /3; designates the fixed costs per transaction. Those of a credit card payment are\nnormalised at unity; for those of a payment by cheque the following shall hold: 0< Ps < 1 .\nIn addition to transaction fees charged by the issuer of a payment medium, this cost\ncomponent may also include the time required for a transaction using that particular\npayment medium. It could be argued here that the use of network money may be less time\nconsuming compared with the other payment media because the money has already been\nauthorised prior to the purchase. In software-based systems there are tokens on the hard\ndrive of the customer's horne computer, whereas in card-based systems there is value\nstored on prepaid cards. It can only be estimated with difficulty to what extent this\nargument actually brings its weight to bear, in terms of network money transactions\nrequiring less time, and it depends on future technological developments. For example, as\npart of the software-based e-money system currently being tested in Germany, merchants\nconsult the network money issuer to settle each transaction, which means that at present the\ntime required by each of the three payment media is likely to differ only fractionally.\nAnyway, on account of the speed of electronic communications, there will probably be no\nmajor differences, either. For simplicity, let us assurne here that this cost component will\nnot playa role.\nThat leaves a potential fee charged by the issuer for each transaction as the determinant of\nfixed costs entailed by paying with network money. It is certainly possible, given the\nsoftware-based systems existing today, to levy such a fee due to the participation of the\nissuer in the transactions.16 However, the More it becomes possible in the future to transfer\ne-money from customer to customer without involving a centraI body, the less possible it\nwill be to levy a fee. In other words, the MOre closely future network money systems\nresemble cash. the MOre apt it would seem to set up a model incorporating costs to the\npurchaser of using network money which do not contain a fixed cost component In the\nfollowing, therefore, we will assume the fixed costs of a network money transaction, PE' to\nbe zero. This assumption has no severe impact insofar as the results compared to the\noriginal Whitesell model are uncbanged as long as the fixed costs of a network money\ntransaction are lower than those of all other payment media, which is still the case.\nHowever, for network money account will be taken of the fact that as the amount of money\ntransacted rises, so do the risks involved. This is justified insofar as payment using cyber\nmoney as a bearer instrument is the only form of payment where purchasing power is\ntransmitted via the Internet The same risks of loss, theft and counterfeiting that apply to\ncash also apply to network money, in principle. The model parameter k represents these\nrisks in proportion to the transaction volume.17\nWhitesell's assumptions with respect to the opportunity costs entailed by each form of\npayment, are motivated not only by their varying liquidity effect but also and in particular\nby their linkage to different assets. Whereas cheques can be cashed on deposits, credit card\npurchases can be settled through (money market) fund shares. As already shown in section\nII.2, however, the non-coincidence of the liquidity effect of the payment media can also be\nregarded as an important determinant of the opportunity costs. This has consequences for\nthe possible constellation of the model parameters. Ifone focuses on the different links, the\nreturn on the balances held for cheque payments and for credit card payments are the same\n26 With one exeeption. the electronie money systems available at present do not permit purse-to-purse\npayments. Le. unlimited payments between individuals. This is true of most card-based systems. The same\nholds for the software-based system described in Section n.2.2 wbere the tokens are returned to the issuer\nafter being used once.\n27 It is true that sueh risks also exist for other payment media. such as credit cants. UDlike network money,\nwhieh is a bearer instrument, tbeft of tbe credit card number does not automatieally lead to the loss of real\npurehasing power. In the example cited here tbe owner of tbe eredit card has the option of blocking the eard.\nThe key assumption concerning the model results is not so much that payment instruments on the Internet are\nrisk-free. with the exception of network money. Ratber, tbe decisive factor is that tbe risks of loss, theft and\neounterfeiting are the highest, relatively speaking, for eyber money.\nif the interest earned on the underlying assets is the same. By contrast, focusing on the non\ncoincidental settlement of the payments will lead to the opportunity costs of paying by\ncheque being able to correspond to those of payment by credit card only if deposits bear a\nhigher rate of interest than the asset used to settle a credit card payment. 1f, however - as\nis customary in Germany - both payment media are usually linked to deposits, this\npossibility does not apply. By contrast, it is technically quite possible to offset network\nmoney's liquidity effect preceding that of payment by cheque by allowing the stored value\nto bear interest, since Ws lead time - as opposed to a comparison between a cheque and a\ncredit card - does not go hand in hand with transferring the assets to the seIler of a good\nor service. Pay before payment media, rather, remain in the hands of the purchaser up to the\npoint in time of the transaction, Le. until the point in time of the liquidity effect of the pay\nnow instruments. The model parameter r designates either solely the interest borne by the\nasset backing the credit card purchases or also additionally the time lag of the debiting,\ndepending on the interpretation of opportunity costs chosen here. 'D denotes the interest on\nthe deposits and 'E denotes the interest borne by the network money balances.\nFinally, it should be remarked that installation costs, Le. fixed costs that are not dependent\non the transactions, are not included in Whitesell's model. In the case ofInternet payments,\nthis specification does not appear to be unproblematical at first glance. However, it could\nbe argued that they are incurred by all payment instruments being examined here and\ntherefore will most likely not differ all that greatly. All the same, the potentially high costs\nof installation could mean that only one form of money will be used.\nThe cost structure can easily be used to draw conclusions on how different payment media\nare used. For example, network money has, by assumption, the lowest fixed costs per\ntransaction and will most likely be used for low-value transactions (having a high frequency).\nLet m be the largest value of n up to which, starting from zero, the consumer uses credit\ncards, and let Mbe that value of n starting from which network money is used. Further, let\nN be the maximum frequency observed in Ws model. The assumption of an upper bound\nfor n corresponds to that of a lower bound for the transaction value. In reality, there is\ncertainly a minimum price at which goods are traded, which means that the assumption of a\nmaximum transaction frequency included in the model seems plausible and necessary. 1f\no::;; m::;; M::;; N holds, this leads to the following optimisation problem for the customer:\nI\n,/\n,\n\nThe first-order conditions lead to those values of m and M which minimise transaction\ncosts (The second-order conditions are fulfilled.):\n\n\nThe graphie representation of the different transaction segments illustrates the fIndings:\nChart 3: Distribution of payment media according to WhiteseU\nI Transaction costs Costs ofpaymmt by\ncteditcard\n,\n,\n,\n, \"\n,\n,\n,\"\n\",\n\"\n,,/'/ ,_ Costs ofpaymmt\n~' _\".- by cheque\n,,\" .,'\n\" \".,,- (r - rD)Y+Ps\"\n\"i' _,'\n,\n..,,\n~'\n..,.,.\n(r-rE)Y / ,.,\u00b7\n._------------,..-----~=------+------------------\nCosts ofpayment\nby networt money\n(r-rE)Y+kY\nTransaction I\nM N frequency i\n\" I\nI\nm\nIn the area from zero to m (high-priced goods) payment is marle by credit card; in the zone\nbetween m and M by electronic cheque; and from M Oow-priced goods) by network money.\nIn Whitesell's model, in an optimum a relationship is established between the bounds of the\nsegments within which transactions are uniformly marle with one specifIc payment medium\nand the model parameters (income and cost structure). If, for instance, the fixed costs of a\ncheque payment Ps fall, the curve of the costs of a cheque payment shown on the chart\nflattens, m shifts to the left, and M shifts to the right. The cheque payment zone is extended at\nthe expense ofthe other two zones. The following table sums up the relationships.\nTable 1: Causality in Whitesell's model\nEndogenous variables\nm-O\nCredit card payment\nzone\nM-m\nCheque payment\nzone\nCyber money\nIpayment zone\nk\nRisk parameter\nNo effect + -\ny\nExpenses per type\nofgood\n+ + -\nExogenous\nvariables\nN\nMaximum trans\ni\naction ftequency\nr\nMarket interest rate\nNo effect\n+\nNo effect\n-\n+\nNo effect\nrD\nInterest rate on\ndeposits\n- + -\nTE\nInterest rate on\ncybermoney\nbalances\nPs\nFixed costs per\ncheque payment\nNo effect\n+\n-\n-\n+\n+\nHere it must be noted that the reactions of the endogenous parameters in Iable 1 to\nchanges in the model parameters have been derived under the assumption that both in the\nold optimum and in the new optimum all three payment media are used.28 Otherwise some\neffects might vanish. For example, assuming a situation whereM N, a further rise in the\nrisk k associated with a network money payment can neither lead to an extension of the\ntransaction segment for cheque payments, nor does it reduce the segment taken up by\nnetwork money. In fact, network money was not even employed in the starting situation,\n28 This corresponds 10 the assumptions that M > m or k> r - rD - (r - rE) and N> M.\nI-Ps\nsince the low-value payments where there would be a cost advantage in using cyber money\nwere lower than the lowest-value transaction actually made.\nIn WhiteseIl's model, the focus of this section, the main feature of the optimum state is the\ngeneral fact that the use of payment media becomes specialised depending on the costs of\nusing each respective payment medium. 1bey can be classified under certain transaction\nsegments by the frequencies of a transaction or by the price of the goods purchased. Here,\nnetwork money assumes the role of a medium ofexchange for Iow-value payments.\nIn the light of the key role pIayed by the costs of using each medium of exchange, it would\nbe desirable not to incorporate them exogenously in the determination of optimal payment\npatterns. Rather, it would be preferable to derive them from plausible assumptions\nconcerning the behaviour of the issuers. This will be done in the next section.\nIV. Interaetion between supply and demand\nIn his model, Wbitesell (1992) looks at the decision problem of a (monopolistic) credit\ninstitution that accepts deposits upon wbich cheques can be drawn. By setting the costs of\npayment by cheque r-rD and Ps' the bank can ultimately determine the segment within n\nwhere payments are made by cheque. Whitesell assumes here that the decisions taken by the\nother issuers of payment media are exogenously given. 1be credit card industry has set its\ncosts per transaction (nonnalised at unity), and the transaction costs of cash issued by central\nbanks are also given. Under these assumptions (and ifN is defined suitably), the transaction\nsegment for cheques that maximises the credit institutions' profits can be derived. It turns out\nthat this segment - apart from marginal solutions - makes up half ofthe overall transaction\nThe optimisation problem faced by an issuer of network money, however, differs from that\nconsidered by Wbitesell in important respects. For one thing, the transaction segment covered\nby cheques is potentially threatened from both sides by other payment media. By contrast, the\ntransaction segment covered by network money - as shown in Section m-is at the right\nhand side of the spectrum of frequencies being considered here. This makes the assumption\nof a maximum transaction frequency or a minimum price at which a good is still traded a\ndecisively important one, since it piaces restrictions on the possible transaction segment of\nthe issuer of network money, thus \"forcing\" the issuer to compete with other payment media.\nFor another thing, in Whitesell's model, the issuer of cheques basically has two decision\nparameters: interest borne by deposits and the fee associated with a transaction. The extent to\nwhich a transaction fee can be charged for network money, however, depends on the extent to\nwhich network money takes on the character of cash in future - as was discussed in Section\nIII. Since network money should in principle be able to be passed through the Internet in\nindependent flows of circulation in the model being discussed here, we will continue not to\nincorporate a transaction fee for this medium ofexchange. Therefore, it remains for the issuer\nto decide on the potential rate of interest on cyber money balances. In the case of independent\ncircular flows of network money, this would be interpreted as interest reaped by the initial\nholder, who during this one model period under consideration holds cyber money in order to\nmake transactions at the end of this period.\nBesides these modifications of the Whitesell model, which are more of a technical nature,\nit would seem desirable also to make a fundamental extension to the decision problem\nfaced by an issuer of payment media. It can hardly be assumed that the issuers of\ncompeting payment instruments will not react to decisions taken by the others. For that\nreason, an approach should be chosen which includes all suppliers in the analysis. In the\nfollowing, therefore, a simple model will be introduced which serves to illustrate the\ninterplay between the demand and the total supply.\nFor simplicity, only two payment media will be analysed here: credit cards and cyber\nmoney. The cost structure is specified analogously to Section III as follows:\nCosts per Transaction costs Opportunity costs\ntransaction per period per period\nCybermoney kp kY (r-rE)Y\nCreditcard PK \u00dfKn -\nThus, those two payment media which differ the most from one another in terms of their\ncost to the consumer are included, as their competition is particularly interesting for\nanalytical purposes.\nLet p. be the smallest value of n for which cyber money is used. 0 S Jl S N then leads to the\nfollowing optimisation problem faced by the customer:\np. N\nMin J(PKn)dn+\nJ(k+(r-rE\u00bbYdn (4)\nThe fIrst-order condition leads to the following bound between the segments of the two\npayment instruments, Jl:\n\nThe optimisation problem faced by individuals can be illustrated by a graph as follows:\nChart 4: Distribution of payment media in a simple model with two payment\ninstruments\nTransaction\ncosts\nkY\n,\"Costs ofpayment\n,/\" by aedil card\n,\",\" PlCn\n\"\"\"\"\n,,'\n,\" Costs ofpayment\n---------------,.'~--_+-------\nI by netwott money\nI \n\nI \n\nI \n\nI \n\nI \n\nI \n\nI \n\nI \n\n---,------------~---------- ---------------\n: I\nTransaction\ntrequency\nN\nn\nHere, J.I.rrun denotes the lowest possible bound of the segment of transactions settled using\nnetwork money, which the issuer of network. money cannot undershoot. given a positive\nrisk of loss, theft and counterfeiting Je. For rE =r , depending on the transaction fee levied\nby the credit card issuer. this bound turns out to be:\nkY\nP\nK\nThus, it is only possible for the issuer of network money to cover the whole transaction\nsegment if a) she takes on the loss risk of those holding her payment medium and b) offers\na sufficiently high interest rate on the network money balances. The extent to which the\npossibility for the issuer to take on the risk should be additionally integrated into the model\ndepends again on the type of network money system under consideration. For example, a\nsystem that provides for the participation of the network money issuer in every transaction\nwill tend to allow the issuer to control the costs she will incur resulting from\nmalfunctioning and to prevent moral hazard. By contrast, this seems hardly possible in a\nsystem of independent circular flows of network money, since the issuer is unlikely to be\nable to verify a case of loss, thus giving the public an incentive to commit fraud. Therefore,\nit will be assumed in the following that the issuer of network money cannot take on the risk\ninvolved with her payment instrument. In the light of progress in the field of secure\ntransmission technology on the Web, however, it should be assumed that the potential\nsegment of network money transactions will tend to spread out over time. Hence, the\nparameter k corresponds to an exogenously given technology on the Internet.30\nIn the following, a credit card issuer and a network money issuer on the supply side will be\nconsidered, both of whom have a monopoly in their respective markets. Theoretical\narguments and trends in Internet payments which can actually be obselVed both justify\nmodelling the supply side in this manner. In the literature, in connection with the further\nspread of electronic money, it is often pointed out that, owing to network externalities, a\nlogistical pattern in its spread is likely to occur.31 This corresponds to the idea that in the\nearly stages of the spread of this innovative payment instrument in the market, the benefits of\nnetwork money are relatively modest. The number of traders who accept this form of money\nis still relatively smalI. However, once a criticallevel of market penetration is achieved, this\ninnovation can then spread much more quickly. This, however, means that if a network\nmoney system reaches the point where exponential growth sets in, this makes it much more\ndifficult for competing systems to take root.32 In fact, trends in the Internet payment system\n30 See the literature on Internet payment systems eited in Seetion 11.2.2. \n\n\n32 In adynamie model, the development of a competitive market into a monopoly due to network \n\nexternalities could be integrated. One could also study to what extent the existence of network externalities\nprovides an incentive for each individual issuer to offer a (temporarily higher) rate of interest on the loaded\nvalues, Le. for those issuers who are striving to be the first to achieve exponential growth with their product.\nseem to confinn this theory. For one tbing, it can be observed that up to now, for the\nsoftware-based cyber money system descri~ in each case oo1y one cred.it institution has\nissued this form of money at a natiooalleveI.33 For another thing, the cooperation of various\ncredit card companies in developing the SET standard indicates that the enterprises are aware\nof the risks involved in interfering with one another in an early stage of this innovation, or\nthat they are aware of the possibility of a bad investment in view of a competing system that\nis conquering the market, and thus wish to avoid this occurring.\nAs far as the issuers' optimisation problem is concemed, the simplest cost structure\npossible is assumed. The credit card issuer produces her services at constant marginal costs\nof CK > o. No further costs exisL By contrast, the costs of issuing network money are\nnegligible (CE\nHence, the credit card issuer's profit, depending on the value of p, is as follows:\nJ\u00abfJK -cK )n)dn =i(fJK -CK)p2 (7)\no\nFor the issuer of network money, the profit equation is specified as follows:\nN\n=\nJ\u00abr-rE)y)dn =(r-rE)Y(N-p) (8)\np\nThe credit card issuer maximises her profit by choosing a value for fJK \u00b7 The network\nmoney issuer maximises her profit by choosing a value for rE or r-rE' A (Nash)\nequilibrium is reached in the model if neither of the two has an incentive for varying her\ndecision parameter, given the choice of the other issuer. The equilibrium fce per credit card.\ntransaction maximises the credit card issuer's profit provided the network money issuer\nchooses the equilibrium rate of interest, and vice versa. Therefore, the next step is to derive\nthe best response in terms of her decision parameter that a monopolist can provide, given\nthe other's decision parameter.\nIn the simple model fra:mewort beiDa studied lIeK. this is not possible. Besides. ODe could argue tbat the \n\nlong-term equilibrium inboth models is likely to be the same. \n\n\nSubstituting p. from (5) into the profit functions gives the respective profit that takes\naccount of the impact of the cost parameters on the bound between the segments of the two\npayment media. Differentiating these functions with respect to the respective decision\nparameters results in the following response functions of the two monopolists:\n\nIt turns out that the credit card issuer selects the fee to be charged regardless of the behaviour\nof the network money issuer. By contrast, the lower the fee per credit card transaction, the\nhigher the rate of interest on network money holdings or the lower the spread r - selected\nr\nE\nby the network money issuer will be. Furthermore, the interest on e-money holdings will rise\nwith an increasing transaction volume per type of good Y. a declining transaction segment N\nand a rising risk parameter k. 1bis means an indirect compensation for a rising loss risk.\nFurthermore, it proves to be worthwhile for the issuer of cyber money to strive for a greater\nmarket share given rising expenditure per type of good, despite the fact that she will have to\nhand over a larger percentage of the (rising) interest income from the float to the holders of e\nmoney. Finally, the issuer reacts to a reduction in the transaction segment being analysed here\nby making her medium of payment more attractive to the public so as not to let the remaining\nmarket share become too small.\nThe equilibrium cost parameters folIowas:\n\nIn equilibrium the following bound p. shows up between the segments of the two payment\ninstruments:\np.=- N+-- :-(N+p. .) (12)\nThe second-order conditions for a profit maximum are fulfilled. \n\nThus. in equilibrium, a division of the market occurs such that both issuers each serve\nexactly half of the market for payment media when the loss risk of network money is\nnegligible. Otherwise, this risk then leads to the market share taken up by network money\nbeing less than half of the market. However, it is halfof the remaining market when taking\ninto account the fact that the zone up to Jlmm is left for the credit card issuer anyway. The\ncredit card issuer determines this zone by choosing a transaction fee; therefore, it is by no\nThe following table sums up the relationships in equilibrium:\nTable 2: Causality in a simple model witb two payment instruments\nPK\nFeefor\npaymentby\ncheque\n\"--\"\n,.-\"E\nSpread\nvariables\np-O\nCredit card payment\nzone\nN-p\nCybermoney\npayment zone\nk\nRisk\nNoeffect - + -\nY\nExpeoses per type\nNoeffect - + -\nExogenous\nvariables\nN\nMaximum Irans\naction -'\"-\nNoeffect + + +\nr\nMarket interest rate\nNoeffect Noeffect Noeffect Noeffect\nCK\nProduction costs\nper credit card\npaymeDl\n+ + - +\nTaking the supply ofpayment media into account here (as opPOsed to Table 1) means that\nsome of the parameters which are exogenously given when only the demand side is\nconsidered now become endogenous. Their chosen values can be explained. This affects\nthe variables \u00dfK (normalised at unity in the Whitesell model) and rE' The result is\nsometimes diverging relationships. For example, one result is that - unlike the result\nobtained when looking only at the demand side - the market interest rate has no effect\n3S See equation (6).\nwhatsoever on the division of the segments among the payment instruments. The reason is\nthat whenever the market rate of interest changes, the network money issuer makes the\nsame adjustment to the interest she offers on e-money holdings.\nWhat seems more important when looking at both sides of the market, though, is the\npossibility of analysing the conditions under which network money may come into use for\nall transactions. Whereas the model in Section m enables us to state only that as the\ninterest rate on network money balances goes up, so does the volume of transactions made\nusing this form of money, additionally taking the supply into account enables us to provide\nan answer to the question of whether the level of interest required to supplant payment by\ncredit card will possibly be set by the issuer. Even though the costs of issuing network\nmoney are nil, in equilibrium there will still be transactions using credit cards. One reason\n- as already discussed - is the loss risk associated with network money, which assures\nthe credit card issuer a positive market share. Another reason illustrated by the model is\nthat even if the loss risk is negligible, the network money issuer has no incentive to cover\nthe entire market through the choice of her cost parameter. To this end she would have to\noffer the public an interest rate that does not maximise her profit. Thus, when taking the\nsupply side into account, the result remains a segmentation of the payment system such that\nnetwork money assumes the role of a medium of exchange for low-value payments.\nV. Concluding remarks\nAn analysis of the microeconomic foundations of the choice the payer must make between\ndifferent payment instruments allows a tentative assessment of the future spread of network\nmoney to be expected. Thus, a cash-in-advance model based on Whitesell (1992) asserts\nthat specialisation of different payment instruments is a characteristic of the consumer's\noptimal payment pattern. Specialisation here means that only one payment medium is\nemployed to buy a good. Furthermore, payment instruments can be c1assified according to\ncertain price zones. This applies to the payment pattern in OTC trade, where such\nbehaviour can actually be observed.36 This also applies to trade on the Internet. Here,\nanalogously to the use of electronic money in OTC trade, network money is likely to\nassume the role of a medium of exchange used for low-value transactions.\nThis result is confinned by a simple model with two payment instruments which additionally\nincludes the supply side. Here. it tums out that the use of network money for the entire range\nof e~mmerce is not only hampered by the loss risk resulting from the fact that cyber money\nis a bearer instrument bot is also at odds with the issuer's profit-maximising behaviour.\nHowever, that makes the scenarios wheJ:e all other media of exchange are substituted\ncompletely by cyber money, potentiallyending up in the existence of a monetary flow\nindependent of the central bank monopoly (as described in the introduction to this paper),\nseem rather unlikely.37 Instead, the impact of the further spread of network: money on\nmonetary policy - much like that of e-money in over-the-counter trade - is likely to be\nlimited.\nHowever, the simple model discussed in Section IV leaves out numerous aspects,\nespecially the role of e-commerce traders in the spmId of certain payment media. In\nparticular, a detailed modelling ofthe idea that certain markets might potentially be opened\nup by electronic money on the Internet would enable us to make more detailed statements\nabout the development towards the steady stare examined in Section IV. It must also be\nremarked that the model examined here only deals with e-commerce on the Internet, thus\nnecessarily leaving unresolved the issue of substitution between OTC trade and e\ncommerce. Ultimately this paper seeks to provide an initial impetus towards a genuine\n\"microfoundation\" of the role electronic money is expected to play in payments. On this\nbasis, in a second step it would be possible to draw conclusions on the resulting\nimplications for monetary policy.\n37 Besides. it becomes clear from the description in Scction 11.2 of the existing e-mooey systems that no\nsystem which is tecbnically capable of creating an indcpendcnt cin:ular flow of mooey has been implemented\nyet. If the tokens created by the software..based system arc used several timcs, this affects the security of that\npayment medium against counterfeiting. A further bindrance is also to be seen in purse-to-purse payments not\nbeing possible in all systems. Payments between individuals arc currently possible only in the aforementioned\nsoftware-based system aod in ODe of the established card-based systems. See Mondex (1999). In addition, the\nvery nature of the pilot projects in the field of softwarc-based systems leads to the problem of insufficient\ninter-operationality between different issuers.
