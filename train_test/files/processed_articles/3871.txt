For example, in the case of the tilt aftereffect\n(TAE), prolonged exposure to tilted visual gratings (10\u00ad30 from vertical) causes a\nsubsequently presented vertical line or grating (test stimulus) to be perceived as being\ntilted in the opposite direction (Gibson & Radner, 1937). This perceptual phenomenon has\nbeen often attributed to lateral interactions between orientation-selective mechanisms at an\nearly stage of visual processing (Tolhurst & Thompson, 1975). In particular, it has been\nproposed that prolonged adaptation to oriented visual stimuli induces a repulsive shift in\nthe preferred orientation of orientation-selective cells in V1, causing substantial distortions in\nparticipant's subsequent visual orientation perception (Dragoi, Sharma, & Sur, 2000).\nCorresponding author:\nPeter Thompson, Department of Psychology, University of York, York YO10 5DD, UK.\nEmail: peter.thompson@york.ac.uk\ni-Perception\nipe.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sage-\npub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nRecent research has suggested that visual adaptation can produce aftereffects in other\ndemonstrated that visual motion adaptation can produce a motion aftereffect in the tactile\ndomain. Using a visual motion adaptation paradigm, participants were exposed to upward or\ndownward visual motion followed by a brief tactile motion stimulus delivered on their right\nindex figure. In a two-alternative forced choice task, participants had to indicate whether the\ntactile sweep of the stimulus was moving upwards or downwards. Crucially, repeated\nexposure to visual motion in a given direction (upward or downward) produced a tactile\nmotion aftereffect, such that the tactile motion was perceived in the opposite direction.\nSimilarly, Matsumiya (2013) demonstrated that adaptation to a visually presented face\nbelonging to a specific facial expression (happy or sad) elicits a repulsive bias in the\nsubsequent perception of a haptically perceived neutral face and vice versa. Together,\nthese studies illustrate that tactile processing depends on mechanisms adapted by vision,\nsuggesting that visual stimulation can alter tactile processing.\nThe existing cross-modal research suggests that visual input powerfully modulates the\ndynamics of tactile orientation perception (e.g., Beauchamp, 2005). The aim of the present\nexperiments was twofold: first, to determine whether the TAE transfers from vision to the\ntactile modality, analogously with Konkle et al.'s (2009) motion transfer, and second, to\ndetermine whether any cross-modal TAE reflects an early stage, retinotopic visuotactile\ninteraction or a later stage, spatiotopic interaction, anchored in a gravitational (i.e., world\ncentered) frame of reference.\nExperiment 1\nParticipants and Method\nExperiment 1 had three conditions: baseline, adapt left, and adapt right. The order of\nconditions was randomized for each of the 13 nai\u00a8ve participants. In all conditions, the\ntwo-point orientation discrimination of tactile vertical stimuli was determined (Tong, Mao,\n& Goeldrich, 2013). In the adapt right and adapt left conditions, the test measurements taken\nwere preceded by an adaptation stimulus, presented for 90 seconds, followed by 15 seconds of\ntactile tests. Top-up periods of 20 seconds adaptation then alternated with further tactile tests\nuntil all the observations had been collected. In the baseline condition, the adaptation\nstimulus was a small fixation cross on a uniform gray background while in the adapt right\nand left conditions, the stimulus was a high contrast circular grating, 10 in diameter, 4 cycle/\ndegree, square wave grating oriented 15 to the right or left of vertical. All stimuli were\ndisplayed on a standard liquid crystal display screen with 1024 \u00c2 768 resolution and 60 Hz\nframe rate, viewed at 57 cm.\nTo present the tactile stimuli, we used a plastic template which was used to mark target\ncontact points on the participants' foreheads. The template consisted of two rows of\nequidistant holes. The bottom row was composed of three holes placed 1.3 cm apart,\nwhich served as the center reference marks. Six equally spaced holes were placed every 4\nalong the circumference of a 3-cm radius circle centered at each of the three reference points,\nmarking orientations from \u00c010 to 10 in 4 steps (see Figure 1).\nParticipants were stimulated concurrently at one bottom and one upper point and asked to\nindicate whether an imaginary line joining the two points was tilted clockwise or anticlockwise\nfrom vertical. Each two-point stimulus pair (i.e., combination of upper and bottom points)\nwas presented 5 times for 1 second. Therefore, a total of 15 observations was made at each of\nsix orientations. The order of presentations was randomized. The three bottom points were\nused to reduce having too many stimulations at a single point on the forehead. (It should be\nnoted that a participant will perceive a stimulus as tilting clockwise when it appears\nanticlockwise to the experimenter. We reported all responses to be from the participant's\npoint of view.) A standard two-alternative forced choice psychophysical method with\nconstant stimuli was used. Psychometric functions were plotted for each participant, and\nthe point of subjective vertical (PSV) determined by fitting a cumulative normal distribution\nto the data; 95% confidence intervals were fitted by a standard bootstrapping procedure.\nResults\nFigure 2(a) shows the shifts in perceived vertical before and after adaptation in one\nparticipant. After adaptation to a visually presented clockwise-tilted grating (green\nsquares), the participant is more likely to feel a truly vertical stimulus as tilted\nanticlockwise. The PSV has shifted to \u00fe3.5. Adaptation to a visually presented\nanticlockwise-tilted grating produces the opposite effect (red triangles), the PSV now being\n\u00c04.6. The baseline condition (black circles) shows that this participant was largely unbiased,\nthe PSV being at \u00c00.02. Results for all 13 participants are shown in Figure 2(b).\nThese results demonstrate that adaptation to a tilted visual stimulus can shift our\nperception of the vertical in the haptic domain just as it can in the visual domain--the\ntraditional tilt aftereffect. For all 13 participants, visual adaptation to anticlockwise-tilted\ngratings caused the subsequent tactile test targets to be perceived as being tilted clockwise to\nthe participant. This leads to the PSV being shifted to a truly anticlockwise tilt. Of the 13\nparticipants, 12 participants perceived this cross-modal aftereffect after adaptation to\nclockwise visual tilt. On average, the haptic PSV was shifted 2.7 anticlockwise of vertical\n(from the participant's viewpoint) after anticlockwise visual tilt adaptation and 2.4\nclockwise of vertical after clockwise visual-tilt adaptation.\nTo compare statistically the effect of adapting stimulus orientation on haptic perception of\nverticality, a one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed in which the\nfactor of interest was the visual adaptation condition (right-visual tilt, left-visual tilt,\nFigure 1.

Mauchly's test of sphericity indicated that the assumption of sphericity had\nbeen violated (x2(2) \u00bc .50, p \u00bc .021), and therefore, degrees of freedom were corrected using\nthe Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity (\" \u00bc .67). There was a significant main effect\np < .001. Planned contrasts revealed that the postadaptation PSV for both right-tilted,\nwas significantly different from the unadapted baseline perceptual boundary. A paired-\nsamples t test confirmed that the TAE was not significantly different in magnitude after\nadaptation to right visual tilt than after adaptation to left visual tilt (Mean \u00bc 2.43,\nExperiment 2\nTo further investigate the origin of this cross-modal TAE, we asked whether it reflects a low-\nlevel integration of visuotactile orientation signals or a higher order perceptual phenomenon.\nWe tested this hypothesis by examining the reference frame of the visuotactile TAE. It is\ngenerally assumed that the visual TAE occurs at low-level visual stages and is thus tied to a\npurely retinotopic frame of reference (Mathot & Theeuwes, 2013). However, recent\nexperiments on trans-saccadic integration may have demonstrated that orientation shows\nspatiotopic adaptation, implying that under certain circumstances the TAE operates in\ngravicentric (allocentric) coordinate frames (Melcher, 2005; Zimmermann, Burr, &\nMorrone, 2011), though this claim is not uncontroversial, for example, Knapen, Rolfs,\nWexler, and Cavanagh (2010). On the other hand, haptic orientation perception, it is\ngenerally agreed, is largely governed by egocentric frames of reference (Coleman &\nDurgin, 2014). Recent research by Mikellidou, Cicchini, Thompson, and Burr (2015)\nsuggests that the oblique effect--reduced orientation discrimination for oblique\norientations--has both egocentric and allocentric components (Mikellidou et al., 2015).\nTo determine the reference frame of the visual-to-tactile TAE, we introduced a\ndiscrepancy between the gravitational and the egocentric visual vertical by having\nobservers adapt to visual gratings with their heads tilted, by the same angle and direction\nas the visual adaptor, so that the visually projected gratings were vertical on the retina but\ngravitationally they remained tilted. If such visual adaptation produces a tactile tilt aftereffect\nthen it would be evidence that the cross-modal effect found in Experiment 1, at least in part,\nreflects adaptation in a gravitationally based frame of reference. If however a TAE is not\nobserved in this experiment, then this would suggest that the cross-modal TAE documented\nin Experiment 1 represents a low-level visuotactile integration operating in retinotopic head-\ncentered coordinates.\nParticipants and Method\nFourteen participants, of whom 13 had taken part in Experiment 1, completed the\nexperiment. The procedure was identical to Experiment 1 with the single difference that\nwhen adapting to the 15 clockwise- (or anticlockwise-) tilted stimuli, the participant's\nhead was tilted at 15 in the same direction so that the adaptation grating was vertically\noriented in retinal coordinates. To control the head tilt of the participants, a 15 tilted\nheadrest was used which constrained the head position to 15 from vertical. (After the\nexperiment, we photographed head positions with the headrest and found deviations from\n15 of no more than \u00fe/\u00c02). The postadaptation measures of the haptic vertical were carried\nout with the head vertical, as in Experiment 1. For those participants who had taken part in\nKrystallidou and Thompson 5\nExperiment 1, the baseline measures were reused, for the one new participant, baseline\nmeasures were taken. In a between-subjects design, eight participants (participant\nnumbers 1\u00ad8) adapted to clockwise tilt, while the remaining six participants (participant\nnumbers 9\u00ad14) adapted to anticlockwise tilt.\nResults\nAs in Experiment 1, psychometric functions were fitted to the individual data and the PSVs\ndetermined (see Figure 3). Six of the eight participants who were adapted to a real-world\nclockwise tilt experienced a tilt aftereffect (on average 1.6) qualitatively similar that\nexperienced in Experiment 1. All of the participants who were adapted to an anticlockwise\ntilt experienced a tilt aftereffect, average size 3.6. The average size of the effect overall of 2.6\nis similar to the effects found in Experiment 1.\nA two-tailed paired samples t test indicated that adapting to tilted visual gratings while\nhaving the head tilted at the same angle significantly shifted participants' haptic PSV\n(p \u00bc .012). To further assess the reliability of this aftereffect, the magnitude of the PSV\nshift was compared with the visuotactile TAE documented in Experiment 1. For each of\nthe participants who participated in both experiments, the size of the TAE in Experiment was\ncompared with the equivalent magnitude in Experiment 1. A two-tailed paired t test indicated\nno difference between the magnitude of the aftereffect in the two experiments (p \u00bc .982). As\n13 of our participants provided data for both Experiments 1 and 2, we were able to run a\ncorrelation between their individual results in the two experiments. The correlation of 0.85 is\nhighly significant (p < .01), confirming that the effect size in Experiments 1 and 2 is similar.\nFigure 3. Haptic tilt aftereffects following adaptation to retinally vertical but gravitationally tilted visual\ngratings. Participants (1\u00ad8) adapted to clockwise tilt (green bars), and participants (9\u00ad14) adapted to\nanticlockwise tilt (red bars).\nExperiment 3\nOne intriguing experimental prediction can be made from the result of Experiment 2. It is well\nknown that adapting to a gravitationally vertical stimulus with one's head tilted leads to a\nvisual TAE (Rieser & Banks, 1981). However, if it is true that the cross-modal aftereffect\ndescribed here is gravitationally based, as suggested by Experiment 2, then this adaptation,\nwhile producing a visual aftereffect, should produce no haptic tilt aftereffect.\nParticipants and Method\nFifteen participants undertook three conditions, each in a pseudorandomized order. Baseline\nmeasures were taken as described in Experiment 1. The adaptation condition was identical to\nthe adaptation in Experiment 2 except that the adaptation stimulus was oriented vertically.\nThat is, the adaptation grating was presented vertically in space but tilted on the retina. Six of\nthe participants adapted with clockwise tilted head, and nine participants adapted with\nanticlockwise tilted head. The third condition repeated the adaptation condition but with\nno adaptation stimulus shown on the screen. Participants who had adapted with clockwise\nhead tilt in the experimental condition adapted with clockwise head tilt in the control\ncondition. This controlled for any effect of head tilt alone.\nResults\nAs in Experiment 1, psychometric functions were fitted to the individual data and the PSVs\ndetermined. The average baseline setting for all 15 participants was \u00c00.01, while the average\nbaseline after adapting to a blank screen with head tilt was 0.01. The data plotted in Figure 4\nshow the average baseline and postadaptation values of perceived true vertical. A t test shows\nthat the difference between the adaptation conditions, adapting head tilt left and head tilt\nDiscussion\nThe present results demonstrate that tactile orientation processing is susceptible to adaptation\nin the visual modality. In Experiment 1, adaptation to visual tilt of a particular orientation\n(right or left) induced a robust tactile tilt aftereffect, biasing the haptic PSV away from the\norientation of the visual adaptor. Experiment 2 established that the visual-to-tactile TAE is\ndefined in a gravitational frame of reference; adaptation to tilted visual gratings with the head\ntilted by the same angle produced a powerful haptic TAE. The cross-modal aftereffect\ndocumented in Experiments 1 appears to be of similar magnitude to the standard TAE\n(Gibson & Radner, 1937). Experiment 3 provided confirmatory evidence that the cross-\nmodal aftereffect reflects gravitational orientation rather than retinal orientation.\nThe results from this study are consistent with the reviewed literature on the cross-modal\ntransfer of aftereffects between vision and somatosensation. Konkle et al.'s (2009) experiment\nillustrated robust cross-modal motion aftereffects operating both from vision to touch and\nfrom touch to vision. Similarly, Matsumiya (2013) reported evidence for a genuine\nbidirectional visuotactile face aftereffect. Importantly, this study extended recent findings\nof visuotactile aftereffects in the perception of haptic orientation. The current experiment\nrevealed that haptic orientation perception is dynamically altered by prior exposure to visual\ntilt, whether visual tilt can similarly be altered by haptic tilt remains to be seen.\nThe TAE has been extensively investigated in the visual modality and is generally assumed\nto originate from lateral inhibitory interactions between orientation-selective neurons of the\nKrystallidou and Thompson 7\nprimary visual cortex (e.g., Tolhurst & Thompson, 1975). Nevertheless, the occurrence of a\nvisually induced haptic TAE demonstrates that the neural processing of tactile orientation\ndepends on neural substrates adapted by vision. Further, given that the reference frame of\nthis TAE is gravicentric, it appears that this haptic aftereffect is the result of high-level visual\nadaptation. The current psychophysical data cannot reveal the locus of this interaction.\nHowever, one prominent candidate is the left parieto-occipital complex. This region is\nthought to be specialized for multisensory spatial processing of orientation (Kitada et al.,\n2006). Indeed, Sathian, Zangaladze, Hoffman, and Grafton (1997) found that this region was\nactivated during tactile discrimination of grating orientation. Similarly, TMS research by\nZangaladze, Epstein, Grafton, and Sathian (1999) indicated that stimulation over this locus\ninterferes with haptic discrimination of grating orientation. The same region has been shown\nto be activated during visual grating orientation discrimination (Sergent, Ohta, &\nMacDonald, 1992). More recently, Kitada et al. (2006) confirmed these findings in a\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging study. Ultimately, evidence for tactually evoked\nactivation of visual parieto-occipital cortical region provides strong evidence for the\nexistence of partially overlapping, shared neural substrates for visuotactile orientation\nperception. Nevertheless, the spatial resolution of current functional magnetic resonance\nimaging technology is coarse, and a typical voxel might include a few million neurons\n(Logothetis, 2008). As a result, it is possible that seemingly identical regions activated in\nvisual and haptic orientation tasks are in fact distinct neural populations.\nIn conclusion, the present findings suggest that vision strongly alters haptic orientation\nprocessing. Using a tilt adaptation paradigm, we showed that adaptation to visual tilt results\nin a robust tactile TAE--the perception of a subsequent oriented tactile target in the opposite\nFigure 4. Results of Experiment 3. Error bars show 95% confidence intervals. As earlier, participants\nadapted with clockwise head tilt shown in green bars, anticlockwise in red bars.\ndirection to the visual adaptor. Further, we showed that this visually induced tactile\naftereffect operates in allocentric frames of reference. It is worth noting that the tactile\naftereffect on the forehead has a polarity as seen from inside the head--that is, adaptation\nto a visual pattern tilted clockwise makes a vertical tactile stimulus appear tilted clockwise\nfrom the experimenter's viewpoint but anticlockwise from the participant's viewpoint. This\nexperience concurs with a well-known demonstration: asked to write a word on your\nforehead you write it in mirror writing, that is, it is written as if seen from inside the\nhead. Writing a word on the back of your head is not so transformed. Our experiments\nmay have been easier if we had probed the tactile effects of the visual adaptation on the\nback of the neck!\nThe present findings suggest that the haptic orientation processing system is influenced by\nhigh-level visual representations. Nevertheless, the current psychophysical results cannot\nreveal the exact locus underlying this visuotactile interaction. Perhaps the investigation of\nthe cross-modal TAE using advanced functional-imaging methods will aid our understanding\nof this intriguing aftereffect, leading to further advances in the complex dynamics of\nmultisensory orientation processing.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nBeauchamp, M.
