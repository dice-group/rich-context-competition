The China Cardiac Survey collected clini-\ncal data from 3513 patients in seven cities across the coun-\ntry, which revealed a high percentage (up to 77%) of\nhyperglycaemia in patients with CAD.2\nOver the past few years, non-coding RNAs have been\nconsidered the `dark matter' of the genome because of\ntheir indefinite types and functions. However, studies\nhave shown that non-coding RNAs are able to regulate\ngene expression even though they cannot code for pro-\nteins directly.3 Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of\nclosed circular non-coding RNAs derived from reverse\nsplicing of exons, introns or both.4,5 With a ring structure\nlacking the 5-end cap and the 3-end poly(A) tail, circR-\nNAs cannot be recognized or hydrolysed by RNA exonu-\nclease, and therefore, circRNAs possess relatively higher\nbiological stability than linear RNA.6 The regulatory gene\nexpression mechanisms of circRNAs vary. As an `miRNA\nsponge', circRNAs play an important regulatory role at\nthe post-transcriptional level via competitive binding to\nmiRNAs.7 The circRNAs can also regulate transcription\nby interacting with small nuclear RNA (snRNA) or RNA\nblood is correlated with coronary artery\ndisease and type 2 diabetes mellitus\nXuejie Li1, Zhenzhou Zhao1, Dongdong Jian2,\nWentao Li1, Haiyu Tang1 and Muwei Li1\n Keywords\nCoronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, circular RNA, circulating circular RNA, microarray analysis\n1Department of Cardiology, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University,\nZhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China\n2Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang\nUniversity, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China\nCorresponding author:\nMuwei Li, Department of Cardiology, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou\nEmail: limuwei@medmail.com.cn\nOriginal Article\npolymerase II in the nucleus8 and competitively regulate\nRNA splicing by binding to transcription factors.9 In addi-\ntion, the expression of circRNAs is tissue specific and\ntime specific; for example, ciRS-7 is highly expressed in\nbrain tissue.10 Moreover, there are significant differences\nin the type and expression of circRNAs at different stages\nPrevious research has shown that circRNAs are closely\nrelated to certain human diseases. Burd et al.13 found that\ncANRIL, the circular isoform of long non-coding RNA\n(lncRNA)-ANRIL, may influence the development of\nCAD by affecting the expression of the INK4/ARF gene.\nWang et al.14 discovered that miR-7 might be involved in\nthe occurrence of DM by reducing regeneration of pancre-\nis a potential biomarker for liver cancer. In this study, we\ninvestigated the relationship between circRNAs with CAD\nand type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Microarray analysis\nwas conducted to compare the expression profiles of circR-\nNAs in the peripheral blood of normal individuals, CAD\npatients, T2DM patients and CAD combined with T2DM\npatients, and the results were verified in larger cohorts.\nMaterials and methods\nPatient population\nThe 289 participants in the study were divided into three\ncohorts (the clinical and demographic features of each\ncohort are shown in Supplementary Tables 1 to 3).\nParticipants were enrolled from the Departments of\nCardiology and Endocrinology of the People's Hospital of\nparticipants received coronary angiography (CAG) and an\noral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to identify the presence\nof CAD and/or T2DM. Clinically matched participants (24\nin total; control group, n=6; T2DM group, n=6; CAD\ngroup, n\n=\n6; CAD combined with T2DM group, n=6)\nwere enrolled for microarray analysis. CircRNA expres-\nsion was verified in the second cohort (control group,\ncircRNA with the best performance was selected and\ntested in the third cohort (control group, n=60; T2DM\ngroup, n=64; CAD group, n=81). The exclusion criteria\nwere as follows: (1) liver or kidney dysfunction, (2) auto-\nimmune disease, (3) malignancy, (4) any other clinically\nacute or chronic inflammatory systemic disease, (5)\nuncontrolled hypertension, (6) endocrine disease aside\nfrom T2DM or (7) previous history of acute myocardial\ninfarction (AMI), percutaneous coronary intervention\n(PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\nDefinition of CAD and T2DM\nIn this study, CAD was diagnosed according to theAmerican\nCollege of Cardiology/American Heart Association\nguidelines (at least one coronary artery stenosis: 50%).16\nThe extent of coronary artery stenosis was measured by two\nindependent cardiologists by visual observation.\nT2DM was diagnosed according to the 1998 Standards\nof the World Health Organization (WHO);17 T2DM was\ndiagnosed when one of the following criteria were met: (1)\nfasting blood glucose (FPG)\nwhere fasting was defined in the study as abstinence from\nany calories for at least 8\nh or (2) 2-h post-load plasma\nIn this study, control individuals showed no sign of\ncoronary atherosclerosis or microvascular disease investi-\ngated by negative treadmill exercise testing (TET) and\nemission computed tomography (ECT), and their 2h post-\nload plasma glucose levels in the OGTT and FPG test\nmg/dL\n(6.1mmol/L), respectively.\nCollection of blood samples, RNA extraction\nand quantitative real-time polymerase chain\nreaction\nAfter an overnight fast, 2mL of blood was collected from\nthe median cubital vein in the early morning before break-\nfast and stored in a vacuum blood collection tube contain-\ning ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant.\nWithin 20min (during which time the blood samples were\nstored in an ice box at 4\u00b0C), total RNA was extracted from\nthe whole blood (1mL) with a total RNA rapid extraction\nkit (CapitalBio Corp., Beijing, China) following the manu-\nfacturer's instructions. RNA was dissolved in ribonuclease\n(RNase)-free water, and the concentration and purity of\ntotal RNA were determined using a NanoDrop 2000 spec-\ntrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\nThe integrity of RNA was assessed with 1% formaldehyde\ndenaturing gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, reverse tran-\nscription was performed by applying a PrimeScript RT\nreagent kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Shiga, Japan) to obtain the\ncomplementary DNA (cDNA). Quantitative Real-Time\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (Q-PCR) was performed using\nSYBR-Green Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Inc.) and moni-\ntored with an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection\nSystem (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Foster\nCity, CA, USA). The relative expression levels of circR-\nNAs were determined by Q-PCR. Primers used for Q-PCR\nare listed in Supplementary Table 4.\nMicroarray analysis of circRNA\nParticipants (normal individuals, CAD subjects, T2DM\nsubjects and subjects with both CAD and T2DM; six cases\nin each group) were enrolled to conduct the microarray\nanalysis. Digestion, dephosphorylation, degeneration and\namplification of RNA were performed in accordance with\nthe instructions of the manufacturer. RNA was labelled\nwith Cy3-dCTP, and purified RNA was hybridized to a\nmicroarray (human circRNA Array V2.0, CapitalBio.,\nprobes.GeneSpringSoftwareV13.0(AgilentTechnologies,\nSanta Clara, CA, USA) was employed to analyse microar-\nray data. To select the differentially expressed circRNAs, a\nthreshold value of fold change 2 or -2 with a p<0.05\ndetermined by a t test was used.\nStatistical analysis\nVariables of different distributions are expressed as the\nmean\u00b1\nstandard deviation or percentages. In the scatter-\nplot showing circRNA expression, the horizontal lines rep-\nresent the median values. A chi-square test was conducted\nfor categorical variables; Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov and\nShapiro\u00adWilk tests were performed to check data normal-\nity for continuous variables, followed by testing for homo-\ngeneity of variance. Significant differences in clinical and\ndemographic indicators were tested using one-way analy-\nsis of variance (ANOVA) or a Kruskal\u00adWallis H test.\nLogistic regression analysis was applied to obtain odds\nratios (ORs) after the relative expression of circRNAs\nexpanded to 10 times, and adjusted ORs were also esti-\nmated after shared risk factors for CAD and T2DM were\nintroduced: smoking, hypertension, total cholesterol (TC),\ntriglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL). For all tests, a p value\nunder 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All\nanalyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 22.0 soft-\nware (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nResults and discussion\nCharacteristics of circRNA expression profiles\nThe results showed significant differences in circRNA\nexpression between the control group and the three experi-\nmental groups. Microarray analysis identified 2036 circR-\nNAs differentially expressed between the control group\ndownregulated in the CAD group (Supplementary Table 5),\nwhile 489 were differentially expressed between the con-\ntrol group and the T2DM group. In addition, 78 were\nupregulated in the T2DM group, whereas 411 were down-\nregulated (Supplementary Table 6). Similarly, 220 circR-\nNAs were also differentially expressed in the control\ngroup and the CAD and T2DM group, of which 147 were\nupregulated, and the other 73 were downregulated\n(Supplementary Table 7). Further analysis indicated that\n40 circRNAs were differentially expressed in all three\nexperimental groups, of which 13 circRNAs were upregu-\nlated and 27 were downregulated in the experimental\ngroups (Supplementary Table 8).
