Boaz, PhD,1 Jason Hu, MBA,2 and Yongjia Ye, PhD2\nThe role of adult children in assisting functionally\nlimited elderly parents has been receiving consider-\nable attention because an increasing number of\nelderly parents survive to a very advanced age and,\nthus, are prone to frailty and functional limitations.\nThe issue of filial responsibility has been addressed\nfrequently from the perspective of the parents. This\nstudy addresses the transfer of resources to parents\nfrom the perspective of the children who may pro-\nvide caregiving time, share living space, or give money.\nIt investigates the interdependence among all three\nmodes of transfer, given the parents' specific needs\nfor resources and the children's ability to provide them.\nWith increased longevity, the prevalence of three-\ngeneration families is common. Nearly three out of\nFour persons in the age range of 50-54 have at least\none living parent and one living child (Soldo, 1996).\nAt the time in their lives when called upon to assist\nfrail and disabled parents, middle-aged sons and\ndaughters may still be paying for the education of\ntheir own children and otherwise assisting them dur-\ning the early phases of adulthood. To support the\nsucceeding generation, the middle generation can be\nexpected to continue to work for pay. To help the\npreceding generation with daily activities of personal\ncare and household tasks, members of the middle\nThis study was supported by Grant #HS-8232 from the Agency for\nHealth Care Policy and Research.

Several studies analyzed the effect of employ-\nment on caregiving. White-Means and Chiang (1991)\nexamined the effect of wages on hours of caregiving\nand found a negative effect at the time of the initial\ncontact but not at the time of the 6-month follow-up.\nBoaz and Muller (1992) determined that full-time em-\nployment reduced caregiving to persons disabled in\nactivities of daily living (ADLs) by 20 hours per week,\nbut caregiving time had only a negligible effect on full-\ntime employment. Doty, Jackson, and Crown (1998)\nfound that the reduced caregiving time of employed\nfemale primary caregivers is offset by secondary un-\npaid and paid helpers, which means that the elderly\ncare recipients do not necessarily experience unmet\nneed for help in the community. Other studies ana-\nlyzed the effect of caregiving responsibilities on\nmarket work. Muurinen (1986) found that primary care-\ngivers of terminally ill patients suffered a loss of in-\ncome due to their withdrawal from the labor market\nor reduced hours of paid work. Stone and Short (1990)\ndetermined that caregivers of long-term disabled and\nfrail elderly persons accommodated their market\nwork to their caregiving responsibilities by rearranging\nwork schedules, taking time off without pay, or re-\nducing hours of paid work. Ruhm (1996) determined\nthat caregiving reduced employment by married but\nnot by unmarried women. Wolf and Soldo (1994) found\nthat caregiving by married women had a negative\neffect on their employment but the relevant coeffi-\ncients are not statistically significant. Ettner (1996) de-\ntermined that the effect of caregiving on paid work\nwas conditioned on living arrangements; caregiving re-\nduced daughters' employment when parents and\ndaughters were living in different households but did\nnot do so when they shared living quarters.\nCoresidence can facilitate caregiving by saving travel\ntime for the caregiver. In general, both elderly parents\nand their children prefer living apart. According to a\n1986 survey by Louis Harris and Associates (Harris and\nAssociates, 1986), of all the elderly persons living alone,\n86% stated their preference for this arrangement; and\nelderly persons were living with adults other than a\nspouse (NIA, 1993). Pezzin, Kemper, and Reschovsky\n(1996) determined that subsidized paid help had\nenabled elderly individuals to continue living alone.\nBut, in the absence of such help, functional limita-\ntions change this preference. Boersch-Supan (1990)\nshowed that the transition to sharing the household\nwith a helper occurred because of limitations in per-\nsonal care activities. Boersch-Supan, Hajivassiliou, Kotli-\nkoff, and Morris (1992) showed that elderly persons\nhad a very strong preference for living with children\nto avoid residence in a nursing home. Soldo, Wolf,\nand Agree (1990) determined that coresidence of a\nwidowed or divorced mother with her children de-\npends on her functional status and on the number\nand gender of her children; mothers are more likely\nto reside with their children if they have only one\nchild than if they have several children, and if this\nonly child is a daughter rather than a son. Kotlikoff\nand Morris (1990), studying both elderly parents and\ntheir children, concluded that the children were less\nwilling than their parents to share living quarters.\nFinancial assistance to elderly parents, which could\npay for human assistance, is a mode of resource transfer\nthat received only scant attention because such trans-\nfers are rare. Inter-vivo financial support is more fre-\nquently provided to the succeeding generation on the\nthreshold of adulthood. Summarizing the literature,\nSoldo and Hill (1993) stated that national estimates\nfrom the late 1980s indicate that only 5% of children\ngave money to parents or parents-in-law over a 12-\nmonth period and that such assistance was provided\nto parents who were disabled at the end of their lives.\ntransferred $500+ over a year's period (McGarry &\nMuch of the literature on the transfer of resources\nbetween generations has focused on motivation,\nnamely, whether transfers are a form of implicit ex-\nchange or can be attributed to altruism on the part of\nthe donor. In the former case, donor and recipient\n\"bargain\" about whether the transfer should take\nplace and at what level, and the donor of services or\nmoney anticipates a form of payment (e.g., an inher-\nitance). In the latter case, the donor decides on mak-\ning the transfer without expecting a return. Soldo and\nHnl (1993) point out that some empirical findings sup-\nport the hypothesis of exchange whereas others sup-\nport the hypothesis of altruism, an inconclusiveness\nthat might be due to the heterogeneity of donors, some\nof whom are motivated by altruism whereas others\nmight expect a reward. A couple of more recent studies\nfound that the needs of recipients motivate the trans-\nfer of resources. An analysis by McGarry and Schoeni\n(1995) supported the conclusion that transfers from\nliving parents to their children and transfers from adult\nchildren to their elderly parents were based on the\nrecipients' needs. Sloan, Picone, and Hoerger (1997)\ndetermined that the supply of time by children to dis-\nabled elderly parents did not appear to have been\nguided by the exchange motive of anticipating an in-\nheritance.\nThis study is concerned with the donors' ability to\nprovide resources rather than with their motivation.\nControlling for the donors' own economic resources\nand the other expected claimants on these resources,\nthe study investigates the extent of interdependence\namong all three modes of resource transfers because\ninterdependence implies that it is relevant to consider\nall modes of transfer simultaneously in order to better\nunderstand how families accommodate the needs of\ntheir frail and disabled members. Yet this interdepen-\ndence has not yet received much attention. Further,\nbecause the transfers flow from the pooled resources\nof the donor household, this study treats transfers as\na household activity, a departure from the customary\napproach to transfers as an individual activity. The next\nsection discusses conceptual issues. It is followed by\nsections that specify the regression model and present\nempirical results, and it concludes with a discussion\nand an interpretation of the findings.\nConceptual Issues\nThe three modes of transfer (i.e., the provision of\ntime, the giving of money, and the sharing of space)\nare not likely to be independent of each other. Their\ninterdependence is explained by showing how a frail\nand disabled person can be helped. For a person who\ncannot perform basic functions of daily living without\nhuman assistance, caregiving services are of overrid-\ning importance. Hence, central to the transfer of re-\nsources is the provision of time (measured by hours\nof caregiving). The sharing of space facilitates caregiving\nby saving travel time and, therefore, complements care-\ngiving. A person who shares living quarters with a dis-\nabled parent is usually a primary caregiver. Financial\nassistance to pay for needed human assistance can\nserve as a substitute for caregiving time that is not\nprovided 'or as a supplement to the time that is pro-\nvided.\nLabor market activity by the donor affects the abil-\nity to transfer resources. It can facilitate one mode of\ntransfer and inhibit another. When sons or daughters\ndo not work for pay, they can provide more caregiving\ntime and less financial assistance than when they do.\nConversely, the more time spent in paid work, the\nless time can be allocated to caregiving and the greater\nthe ability to transfer money. Commitment to market\nwork might also affect the decision on coresidence. A\ncaregiver who is engaged in labor market activity might\ndecide to share living quarters with a parent because\ncoresidence is a time-saving device. Thus, the labor\nmarket activity of donors is an essential determinant\nof the ability to make transfers; it affects the mode of\ntransfer ana the amounts transferred and, in turn, is\naffected by decisions on transfers.\nThe interdependence among the three types of\nresources and their link to the labor-market activity\nof the donor call for a simultaneous-equations model\nwith four structural equations. Such a model is pre-\nsented in Table 1; it satisfies the order-and-rank con-\nditions of identification. All four endogenous variables\nare right-hand-side (RHS) variables. The criterion for\nincluding exogenous variables in any structural equa-\ntion is whether these variables can be expected to\nhave a direct effect on the left-hand-side (LHS) vari-\nable of that equation; the exclusion restrictions follow\nfrom the variables that are included in each equation,\nbased on this criterion. The indirect effects are cap-\ntured through the RHS endogenous variables.\nThe exogenous variables (which are discussed in\ngreater detail in the next two sections) are the charac-\nteristics of parents (recipients) and children (donors).\nThe parents' characteristics indicate their needs for\nhelp and whether they have other family members\n(a spouse and other children) who could assist them.\nThese characteristics have a direct effect on each of\nthe three equations that estimate transfer-modes; they\naffect \"paid work\" by sons and daughters (the donors)\nindirectly through the effects of the three RHS endog-\nenous variables of the \"paid work\" equation. The abil-\nity of sons and daughters to transfer resources to par-\nents is indicated by their commitment to market work,\ntheir own children, their wealth, and their health. As\nshown by Mincer (1974) and subsequent studies, the\nmajor determinants of paid work are schooling and\nage; they can serve as instrumental variables for com-\npensation from work because these variables are highly\ncorrelated with labor market earnings. Fungible wealth\n(represented by income from assets) enhances the\nability to provide financial assistance to parents but\nweakens the commitment to market work. The donor's\nown children might compete with their grandparents\nfor resources. The type of resources that these children\nwould need depends on their ages and, therefore, their\nages affect the mode of resource transfer to their grand-\nparents. The donor's general health status can affect\nboth labor market and caregiving activities. Difficulty\nwith mobility points to a specific aspect of health status\nthat has a direct effect on helping parents with personal\ncare activities such as dressing, bath-ing, and assisting a\nperson with getting in and out of a bed or chair. Prob-\nlems with mobility are less likely to affect market work\nbecause, as stipulated by the Americans With Disability\nAct, most workplaces have to accommodate these prob-\nlems. (The undesirable effects of multicolinearity are\navoided by including these two health-status indicators\nin different equations.)\nTable 1.

The\nselection criterion for inclusion in the HRS is that at\nleast one person in each household was born between\ndomestic partner of the age-eligible person might be\nage eligible or could have been born before 1931 or\neligible and 1,138 (9%) were older. Their ages sug-\ngest that their parents were likely to be old: 40% of\naged 80+. (Detailed information on the HRS is pro-\nThe criterion for inclusion in the present study is\nthe functional status of the parents. Functional status\nand chronic health problems in old age are based on\nsuch exogenous factors as genetic endowment and\nevents earlier in a person's life (Smith & Kingston, 1997).\nHRS considers a parent to be functionally limited if\nhe or she needs help with routine personal activities\nsuch as dressing, eating, or bathing and/or \"cannot\nbe left alone for more than one hour\" (e.g., question\nE-43). This is the only question about the parent's\nneed for assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs);\nit differs from the usually detailed questions asked\nwhen disabled individuals are interviewed (e.g., in such\nsurveys as the NLTCS or AHEAD).\nThe unit of analysis is the household (not the indi-\nviduals in the household) because the household is\nthe economic unit whose members pool the resources\nthat are transferred to parents. The HRS distinguishes\nbetween one-respondent households and two-respon-\ndent households; 370 households of the former type\nand 1,298 of the latter qualify for inclusion in the sample\nbecause these are the households that have at least\none parent who needs help with personal care activi-\nties. The study is based on the sample of two-respon-\ndent households. Although similar in concept, the two\ntypes of households have to be analyzed separately;\nthe analysis of the two-respondent households has to\ntake into account the interaction between the labor-\nmarket activity of the two respondents whereas there\nis no such interaction in a one-respondent household.\nThis study is based on the more complicated and\nlarger subset, that is, on the two-respondent house-\nholds. Each of these households happened to be paired\nby respondents of the opposite sex; the households\nwere not selected on the basis of this attribute.\nThe four endogenous variables are: (a) hours of\ncaregiving time, (b) the probability of giving money to\na parent, (c) the probability of coresiding with a par-\nent, and (d) the commitment to market work. The\nHRS questionnaire words the question about hours of\nhelp in terms of the assistance provided during a 12-\nmonth period preceding the interview. It specifies the\nlower limit as 100 hours because persons who pro-\nvide fewer than 100 hours in a year are considered\nto have provided only token assistance and no regular\nhelp with the daily activities of personal care; they\nare not considered to be caregivers of persons who\nneed daily help and/or cannot be left alone. HRS sets\nthe upper limit at 5,824 annual hours (approximately\nannual hours for a two-respondent household. The\nHRS asks about amounts of financial assistance that\nexceed $500 per year. However, because the infor-\nmation on dollar amounts is incomplete, the regres-\nsion analysis specifies the probability that money has\nbeen given to a parent rather than tne amounts trans-\nferred. The HRS provides information on whether a\nparent resides witn the respondent in the same house-\nhold or has other living arrangements.\nThe strength of the commitment to market work is\nmeasured by the amount of time spent in paid work.\nLabor supply (hours of paid work) is not a continuous\n(linear or log-linear) variable because reported hours\nof work are clustered. Juster and Stafford (1991) point\nout that hours of work reported in surveys usually\ncluster around 35-40 weekly hours as a convenient\nindicator of full-time paid work. In the HRS, a sub-\nstantial cluster occurs at exactly 40 hours per week\nall male respondents and 21% of all female respon-\ndents in the sample reported this number of hours).\nHence, 2,080 is considered the demarcation for full-\ntime employment. A distinction is made among three\ntypes of commitment to market work: no commitment\n(no paid work), some commitment (part-time paid work\nof fewer than 2,080 annual hours), and a major com-\nmitment (full-time paid work of 2,080+ annual hours).\nThis classification follows the observations by labor\neconomists (e.g., Blank,1989) that part-time employ-\nment is a distinct mode of employment and is on a\ndifferent track than full-time employment (analogous\nto the difference between adjunct and tenure-track\nfaculty). The qualitative difference between part-time\nand full-time employment is also demonstrated by the\ndifference in eligibility for employment-related ben-\nefits and opportunities for promotion. Put differently,\npart-time and full-time employment are not on the\nsame continuum. Multinomial logit (MNL; rather than\nordered logit) is the appropriate functional form to\nrepresent the different types of employment because\nMNL estimates a different coefficient vector for each\nemployment category. (Ordered logit does not have\nseparate coefficient vectors because all truly ordered\ncategories are on the same continuum.)\nThe exogenous variables represent parents' need\nfor human assistance and their ability to obtain this\nassistance from other members of their family. The\ncharacteristics of the respondents are indicators of\ntheir ability to provide resources to their parents; the\nrelevant characteristics are their labor-market activity,\ntheir wealth and health, and the other expected\nclaimants on their resources.\nA parent needs extensive human assistance when\nhe or she requires the constant presence of a caregiver\nand cannot perform the daily activities of personal\ncare without assistance. As a measure of the burden\non donor households, this study distinguishes between\nhouseholds with at least one parent who needs such\nextensive help and households in which no parent needs\nextensive help. Another measure of the burden on house-\nholds is the number of parents who need help, which\nis specified by differentiating between households in\nwhich only one parent needs help and households in\nwhich more than one parent requires human assis-\ntance (the maximum is four parents). Ability of the\nparents to rely on family members other than the re-\nspondent lessens this burden; it is indicated by the\nparent's marital status and the number of other sons\nand daughters (the respondent's siblings). A parent who\nis married and/or has other children is less dependent\non caregiving by the respondent and less likely to re-\nside in the respondent's household.\nThe respondent's propensity to engage in market\nwork depends on the level of education, age, and\nhealth status. These variables are highly correlated with\nthe level of compensation (wages, salaries, and ben-\nefits), which is a major determinant of participation in\nlabor-market activity. Therefore, these variables can\nserve as instruments for compensation from paid work\nand avoid the problem of RHS endogeneity of the\ndirect measures of compensation. The decision on\nwhether to commit to market work and the type of\ncommitment is also affected by the household's in-\ncome from assets (nonlabor income) and by the ages\nof respondents' children. The ages of respondents' own\nchildren determine the type of support that these\nchildren need. When almost all children are young\nadults (ages 18+), the most likely resource they would\nneed is money, especially if they have not yet com-\npleted their education; and they may also need space\nif they reside in their parents' household. Hence, the\ngrandchildren can be expected to compete with their\ngrandparents for the respondents' financial support and\nhousehold space. Age 25 was selected as the demar-\ncation between need for parent support and no need\n(or lesser need) for such support. The number of chil-\ndren under age 26 is specified as an indicator of the\nother potential claimants on the resources of the re-\nspondents.\nAs presented in Table 1, the regression model specifies\nfour structural equations. A two-stage procedure is used\nto estimate each single equation. (System methods such\nas full-information-maximum-likelinood turned out to\nbe intractable for a four-equation model.) In the first\nstage, each of the four endogenous variables is re-\ngressed on all exogenous variables of the model; the\nrationale (as clearly explained in Gujarati, 1988, pp.\nto affect each endogenous variable either directly or\nindirectly (through its direct effect on another endog-\nenous variable). Four second-stage (structural) equa-\ntions specify the predicted values of the endogenous\nvariables as RHS variables. The functional forms for\nthe first-stage and second-stage equations are: (a) a\ntobit equation for hours of human assistance (time),\n(b) a binary (ordinary) logit equation for the probabil-\nity of providing financial assistance, (c) a binary (ordi-\nnary) logit equation for the probability of coresidence\n(sharing space), and (d) an MNL equation for estimat-\ning the commitment to market work.\nThe unit of analysis is the household because trans-\nfers flow from the household's pooled resources. This\napproach differs from the customary one that focuses\non the individual as the unit of analysis even when\nthe individual is married and data are available for\nthe spouse. The commitment of one spouse to mar-\nket work is not independent from the commitment to\nmarket work of the other spouse (Killingworth, 1983,\npp. 30-34). Because each household happened to be\npaired by respondents of the opposite sex, the labor-\nmarket interaction between its two respondents is pre-\nsented as gender-based interaction. The MNL catego-\nries of the variable \"commitment to market work\" are\nspecified to reflect this interdependence, as follows:\n(a) both husband and wife work full-time; (b) only the\nhusband works full-time (his wife does not work or\nworks part-time); (c) only the wife works full-time (her\nhusband does not work or works part-time); (d) both\nspouses do not work; and (e) a residual category of\nthe possible remaining interactions (a category that is\nnot interpreted). Because the HRS oversamples racial\nand ethnic minorities, the sample observations are\nweighted to adjust for the oversampling so that the\nempirical results are applicable to the population rep-\nresented by the sample of this study.\nEmpirical results\nTable 2 shows the frequency distribution of two-\nrespondent households by types of resources trans-\nferred. Although every household had at least one\nparent who needed help with personal care activities\nand/or who could not be left alone, only 29% of these\nTable 2.

Sons and daughters were more likely to share\nliving quarters with parents who were not married and/\nor had few or no other children; these households\nhad proportionally fewer employed respondents, pre-\nsumably because these respondents were likely to have\nhad major caregiving responsibilities. The regression\nanalysis is designed to assess the interdependence among\ntransfer modes and to determine the extent to which\nparents' needs and children's ability to be donors af-\nfect the transfer of resources.\nsents the second-stage equations that estimate the re-\nlationship among the three modes of transfer, control-\nling for the effects of the relevant characteristics of\nthe donors and the recipients. The three dependent\nvariables corresponding to these three transfer modes\nare hours of caregiving, the probability of transferring\nmoney, and the probability of sharing space. A fourth\nequation, whose dependent variable is market work,\nis not shown here because market work is not a re-\nsource that is transferred; its role in this model is that\nof a RHS endogenous indicator of the ability to trans-\nfer resources. The standard errors of the coefficients\nin second-stage equations are biased downward; hence,\nthe observed level of statistical significance is over-\nstated. To take account of this problem, the analysis\ndisregards the 10% significance level, regards the 5%\nlevel as only a weak statistical significance, and inter-\nprets the 1% level as statistically significant. [We know\nof no program that would adjust the standard errors\nof a second-stage equation that has three RHS pre-\ndicted variables that are obtained from three different\nfirst-stage equations. Such an adjustment requires a\ncombination of these three equations and, therefore,\nis not doable. LIMDEP 7.0 (Econometrics Software, Inc.,\nNew York) has a program for a model that has one\nfirst-stage equation.]\nThe RHS endogenous variables provide estimates\nof the interdependence among the three modes of\nresource transfer and the effect of market work on\nspecific transfer modes. Household characteristics in-\nclude parents' attributes, the respondents' own chil-\ndren, and the household's asset-income. Each of the\nhouseholds happens to have a male respondent and\na female respondent (as explained in the previous sec-\ntion); therefore, gender characteristics are considered\nhousehold characteristics and are shown separately for\nmale and female spouses (partners). The regression co-\nefficients are interpreted as the effects of RHS vari-\nables on the transfer of resources from the donor (sons/\ndaughters) generation to the recipient (parents) gen-\neration when the older generation has at least one\nfunctionally limited member.\nThe interdependence among transfer modes is\nunidirectional in that financial assistance and coresi-\ndence affect caregiving time but caregiving has no re-\nciprocal effect on the transfer of money or on the\nsharing of living space. Households that provided fi-\nnancial assistance also provided 502 more annual hours\nof caregiving time than households that did not pro-\nvide such assistance. The few households that shared\nliving quarters with a parent provided close to 3,000\nadditional caregiving hours per year compared with\nthe many more households that did not share space.\nWhen a functionally limited parent resides in a re-\nspondent household, at least one member of the house-\nhold is likely to have a major responsibility for caregiving.\nCoresidence and financial assistance do not appear to\nbe interdependent. The transfer of money to parents\ndid not affect the probability of sharing space with\nthem, and coresidence did not affect the provision of\nfinancial assistance.\nIn theory, the commitment to market work can be\nexpected to affect every mode of transfer. However,\nthe analysis shows that market work affected only the\namount of caregiving time and had no effect on the\nprobability of financial assistance or the probability of\ncoresidence. Specifically, compared witn no market\nwork, full-time employment by both husband and wife\nreduced caregiving by 344 annual hours. When only\nTable 4.

The underlying first-stage equations are available upon request.\naThe marginal effects are specified by McDonald and Moffitt (1980, Eq. 5).\ncAlmost all own children are young adults (ages 18+). Their claims on household resources are for financial support and space\naccommodation. They do not compete with their disabled grandparents for help (time) with routine activities of daily living. Or put\ndifferently, cell size for the relevant group of minor children who would need such help is very small, especially when interacted with\nthe number of children in the household.\n(interpreted as statistically significant).\nthe husband was employed full-time, caregiving was\nreduced by 247 annual hours, but caregiving by the\nhousehold was not reduced when only the wife was\nemployed full-time. Market work had no statistically\nsignificant effect on providing financial assistance to\nparents or coresiding with them.\nParents' characteristics have an effect on the trans-\nfer of resources by their children. Whereas the num-\nber of functionally limited parents in a household had\nno statistically significant effect on any transfer mode,\na parent's need for extensive help prompted the\nhouseholds of their sons or daughters to provide 200\nadditional caregiving hours per year (compared to a\nsituation when a functionally limited parent did not\nneed extensive help). A parent's marital status and the\nnumber of other children (respondent's siblings) had\nstatistically significant effects on reducing the probability\nof coresidence and financial transfers. Having a spouse\nreduced the probability of household sharing by 3.2%\nand the probability of financial support by 7.1%; hav-\ning an additional child (a sibling of the HRS respon-\ndent) reduced the probability of coresidence by 0.6%\nand the probability of financial transfers by 0.8%.\nThe ability of middle-aged sons and daughters to\nassist their functionally limited parents depends on the\nhousehold's fungible wealth and on the other expected\nclaimants to its resources. A measure of such wealth\nis income from assets; a substantial level of asset-in-\ncome increased the probability of financial transfers\nto parents by 8.7% when compared with a household\nthat had no asset-income. Foremost among the other\nclaimants are the donor household's own children, al-\nmost all of whom were young adults. These young\nadults might need financial support, and they might\nstill reside in their parents' home. Thus, the grand-\nchildren and grandparents might compete for space\nand money but, in effect, they did not. Having grand-\nchildren under age 26 did not reduce the probability\nof financial assistance to their grandparents or coresi-\ndence with them; there is no statistically significant\ndifference in giving money or sharing space between\nhouseholds that had no children and households that\nhad any number of children under age 26. (One puz-\nzling result is the effect of being non-White on the\nprobability of transferring money to parents; contrary\nto expectations, being non-White rather than White\nincreased this probability by 8.0%.)\nDiscussion\nInter-vivo transfers within families usually flow from\nmiddle-aged members to their children; transfers from\nchildren to parents are very rare and occur mainly at\nthe end of the parents' lives. The analysis is based on\nhouseholds in which at least one member is within\nthe age range of 51-61. When a son or a daughter\nhas a spouse, the household can have four living par-\nents. Included in this study are all households in\nwhich the age-eligible member has a spouse/partner\n(i.e., two-respondent households) and at least one\nparent cannot independently perform the daily ac-\ntivities of personal care and/or cannot be left un-\nattended. The family life cycle suggests that, in their\nfifties, members of the \"sandwich\" generation are likely\nto have parents of very advanced age who are prone\nto frailty and disability, in addition to having children\nand even grandchildren; in other words, members of\nthe middle generation can expect to have many\nclaimants on their resources. This study controls for\nthe ability of the sandwich generation to transfer re-\nsources as it investigates the interdependence among\nthe three mode of resource transfer.\nMost studies of disabled elderly parents and their\nadult children focus on caregiving. Stone and Kemper\nsons and daughters were active caregivers in 1984.\nHimes (1994) determined that, at any point in time,\nonly few daughters are caregivers; but, over their lives,\nthe probability of being a caregiver is high because,\nas parents' survival rates increase, the risk that they\nwill become dependent on their children increases.\nThe present study shows that, over a duration of one\nyear, relatively few children provided caregiving time.\nOn a household basis, 17% of the two-respondent\nhouseholds provided caregiving time in 1992. How-\never, caution has to be exercised in concluding that\nfamily caregiving has declined over time because of\nthe difference in the specified activities for which help\nis needed. The 1984 data have information on IADL\nand ADL disabilities whereas the 1992 data have in-\nformation only on ADL disabilities; it is much easier\nto assist with household tasks than to help with the\ndaily activities of personal care and, therefore, pro-\nportionally more children might be reported as caregivers\nThe provision of caregiving time is the primary mode\nof resource transfer. When tne transfers of money and\nspace are counted in addition to the transfer of time,\n29% of households transferred resources to parents. Co-\nresidence has been studied as a facilitator of caregiving,\nbut money transfers have received only scant attention\nalthough financial assistance enables a recipient-parent\nto obtain paid help. The findings from this study sug-\ngest a unidirectional rather than a multidirectional in-\nterdependence among the types of resources that\nare transferred. Coresidence and financial support\nare associated with a substantial increase in the amount\nof caregiving time and, at the margin, complement\ncaregiving. Households that share living quarters with\nparents are likely to have a major responsibility of\ncaring for them. Financial support for paid help in addi-\ntion to the unpaid help that is provided by family\nmembers signals a need for extensive human assistance\nby care recipients (Liu, Manton, & Liv, 1985); it is\npositively associated with caregiving time.\nFurther, transfer modes appear to be targeted to\nparents' needs. The provision of caregiving time is in-\ncreased when a parent is dependent on others for\nperforming the daily activities of personal care and\ncannot be left alone. Coresidence is more likely when\na parent has few or no other family members, such as\na spouse and/or other children, with whom to share\nliving quarters. Money transfers are more likely when\na parent is not married because married elderly par-\nents are frequently better off financially than unmar-\nried elderly parents.\nThe modes of transfer also depend on the types of\nresources available to the donor households. House-\nholds are more likely to provide financial support when\nthey have a substantial amount of income from assets,\nsuggesting a substantial level of fungible wealth. Fur-\nther, the likelihood of giving money to parents is not\nreduced by the other potential claimants (e.g., own\nchildren) on the household's resources. Market work\nwas found to affect only the provision of help time.\nFull-time paid work by both spouses reduces the house-\nhold's caregiving more than if only one spouse is em-\nployed full-time; but full-time employment by only the\nhusband is more likely to reduce the number of hours\nof help than full-time employment by his wife. Con-\nversely, when men and women are not engaged in\nmarket work, they provide more caregiving time than\nwhen they are. Although it has been amply docu-\nmented that women have the major responsibility for\ncaregiving, the caregiving households in this study dis-\nplay a pattern of human assistance in which men share\nthis responsibility to a substantial extent. In 55% of all\ncaregiving households, both spouses were caregivers;\nmen were sole caregivers in 7% of these households,\nand women were the only caregivers in 38% of these\nhouseholds. (The information on household caregiving\nwas, by design, obtained from the female respondent\nin the two-respondent household.)\nThe findings suggest that it is relevant to consider\nall modes of transfer in order to understand how\nfamilies accommodate the needs of their frail and dis-\nabled elderly members. Whereas the provision of care-\ngiving services is the primary mode of transfer, almost\nhalf of the donor households provide financial assis-\ntance. On the other hand, the general trend away\nfrom sharing living quarters with elderly parents, which\nis also reflected in the very low rate of coresidence\nwith elderly parents who are functionally limited. This\nfinding implies that single parents have to find other\nassisted living arrangements when they are no longer\nable to live alone. To judge from the level of cash\nincome available to individuals of advanced age (So-\ncial Security Administration, 1998), the majority of persons\nin this group cannot afford to pay for assisted living in\nthe community without financial support from their\nchildren or subsidies from public-sector funds. Thus,\nwhen middle-aged children have a strong preference\nfor their own privacy and avoid coresidence with their\nfrail and disabled elderly parents (Kotlikoff and Mor-\nris, 1990), financial assistance to parents might assume\nan increasingly important role in the transfer of re-\nsources from the middle to the oldest generation.\nReferences\nBlank, R.
