    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Cannabis (marijuana) use and acceptance towards use are increasing in the US, and\nstate-level policies are becoming more liberal. A wealth of research has been conducted to\nexamine risk factors for use; however, studies rarely differentiate between different forms of\nmarijuana. Objective: We sought to determine prevalence of use and delineate who is at risk for\nuse of hashish, a more potent form of marijuana. Methods: We examined data from a nationally\nrepresentative sample of high school seniors in the Monitoring the Future study (2007\u00ad2011;\nweighted n \u00bc 10 597). We determined how sociodemographic factors and reasons for marijuana\nuse correlated with recent (12 month) hashish use. Results: Prevalence of recent hashish use was\n6.5% and it was used by 18.3% of recent marijuana users. Hashish and other marijuana use\ntended to share many of the same correlates; however, associations were often stronger for\nhashish use. Females were consistently at low risk for use and users of other drugs were\nconsistently at high risk for use. Black students tended to be at low risk for hashish use. Low risk\nof identifying as Hispanic or religious and high risk of higher personal income or going out\nmore evenings per week for fun disappeared when controlling for other drug use. Using\nmarijuana because the student felt he/she was ``hooked'' nearly doubled the odds for hashish\nuse. Conclusions: This was the first national study to examine prevalence and correlates of\nhashish use. These findings can inform prevention in a time of increasing popularity of\nmarijuana use.\n",

State-\nlevel policy is beginning to shift, with four states plus the\nDistrict of Columbia legalizing recreational use and at least\nanother 20 states decriminalizing recreational use or legaliz-\ning medical use. As a variety of marijuana products become\nmore easily or legally accessible, it is important to examine\nwho is at risk for use of particular products in order to inform\nprevention and harm reduction strategies. Despite a wealth of\nresearch on marijuana, surprisingly very little epidemiologic\nresearch has focused on hashish (``hash''), a hypercompressed\nand more potent form of cannabis sativa.\nColorado and Washington were the first two states to\nlegalize recreational marijuana use and there is now no penalty\nin these states for private possession of up to 1 oz by adults age\n21 or older (5\u00ad7). In Colorado, the same regulations currently\napply to hashish. In Washington, an adult can legally possess\nup to 16 oz of marijuana-infused products (commonly con-\ntaining hashish) in solid form (e.g. brownies), or 72 oz of\ncannabis-infused products in liquid form (e.g. soda, which may\ncontain hash oil). Both hashish and non-hashish marijuana can\nbe smoked, vaporized, or cooked in food. Hashish can be used\neither in its natural state or converted into a more concentrated\noil (8). However, compared to other marijuana, hashish usually\ncontains a higher concentration of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol\n(THC), which is the most potent psychoactive cannabinoid\n(9\u00ad11). While a typical marijuana cigarette (``joint'') contains\nDifferent methods of marijuana use can lead to differences\nin absorption and metabolism of THC. When smoked, THC\nis absorbed from the lungs into the bloodstream within\nAddress correspondence to Joseph J. Palamar, 227 East 30th Street, 7th\nFloor, New York, NY 10016, USA. E-mail: joseph.palamar@nyumc.org\nminutes (11). THC reaches its peak levels within 10 min after\nsmoking and rapidly declines to 5\u00ad10% of its initial levels\nwithin an hour (11). Hashish, however, retains most of its\nparent THC in a form that can be more readily absorbed,\neither through ingestion or through smoke (13). When hashish\nis ingested, THC absorption is slower, taking 1\u00ad3 hours to\nenter the bloodstream; the result is a less intense high of\nlonger duration (13). A major metabolite, 11-hydroxy-THC, is\n20% more potent than THC and results in higher concentra-\ntions after being swallowed rather than smoked (14).\nTeen marijuana use (with hashish use included in the\ndefinition) has been researched extensively. In 2013, almost\nhalf of high school seniors (45.5%) reported using marijuana\nin their lifetime (1). Lifetime, annual and 30-day use is more\nprevalent among males, Hispanics and among those who\nreside in cities (15). Those who report marijuana use \u00ad\nparticularly frequent marijuana use \u00ad are also at high risk for\nusing other illicit drugs (16,17). Research is needed to\ndetermine not only whether hashish has different effects than\nwhat we normally deem ``marijuana'' on surveys, but also to\ndelineate correlates of use to determine who may be at highest\nrisk for use. Findings from our previous research suggest that\nit may not always be appropriate to collapse multiple forms of\nthe same drug or drug delivery system into a single category,\nas is commonly done with marijuana (18\u00ad22).\nHashish is usually more potent than non-hashish mari-\njuana, yet there is a remarkably limited literature on its\nepidemiology and correlates of use. Here we examine whether\nhashish and (non-hashish) ``marijuana'' have different socio-\ndemographic correlates of, and reasons for use in a large,\nnationally representative sample of adolescents approaching\nadulthood.\nMethods\nDesign\nData were examined from Monitoring the Future (MTF), an\nannual representative survey of high school students in\napproximately 130 public and private schools throughout 48\nstates in the US (1). Schools were selected through a multi-\nstage random sampling procedure; first geographic areas were\nselected, then schools within geographic areas, and then\nclasses within selected schools. Constructs assessed were\ndivided into six questionnaire forms and distributed randomly.\nThis study focuses on data collected through Form 1, the only\nform that assesses hashish use, in addition to general\nmarijuana use and sociodemographics. Analyses focused on\n(2011 was the last year recreational marijuana use was still\nVariables\nWith regard to sociodemographic variables, MTF assessed\nstudent sex, age (dichotomized as 518 vs. 18), and race/\nethnicity (i.e. white, black, Hispanic). Population density was\ncategorized by non-, small, and large metropolitan statistical\nareas (MSAs). Small MSAs are defined as counties or groups\nof counties with at least one city of 50 000 inhabitants and\nthe 24 largest MSAs are defined as large MSAs. Non-MSAs\nare the remaining areas (1). Religiosity was assessed via a\ncomposite of two ordinal items which assessed religious\nattendance and importance (range: 1\u00ad4). We divided the\nmean-composite into tertiles indicating low (1.0\u00ad2.0), mod-\nTo assess family structure, students were asked to indicate\nwith which parent(s) they resided. Students answered whether\nthey resided with no parents, one parent or two parents. The\nlevel of educational attainment of the parents was assessed via\nordinal scales and a mean score for both parents (or raw score\nif only one parent) was coded into three groups representing\ntion. Students were also asked about the number of evenings\nthey usually go out per week for fun and recreation and we\ncoded answers into: (1) 0\u00ad1 evening(s), (2) 2\u00ad3 evenings, and\n(3) 4\u00ad7 evenings. Student weekly income was assessed\nby asking how much money the student earns during the\naverage week from: (1) a job or other work, and (2) from\n``other sources''. We recoded responses for each item\nsociodemographic variables was guided by previous research\nWith respect to drug use, students were asked about\nfrequency of lifetime use of marijuana, alcohol (``more than\njust a few sips''), cigarettes and select illicit drugs. Students\nwere asked, ``On how many occasions (if any) have you used\nmarijuana in your lifetime?'' The survey reminded students\nthat ``Marijuana is sometimes called weed, pot, dope; hashish\nis sometimes called: hash, hash oil'' and then asked, ``On\nhow many occasions (if any) have you used hashish in your\nlifetime?'' The same questions were asked for use in the last\n12 months. Possible responses for these questions were:\ndichotomized recent (12 months) hashish use (into yes/no)\nand also created a trichotomous variable indicating: (1) no\nrecent use of either, (2) recent use of marijuana, but not\nhashish, and (3) recent use of hashish (regardless of other\nmarijuana use).\nThe same response options applied to lifetime use of\nalcohol and other illicit drugs. The illicit drugs considered\nin this study were powder cocaine, crack, heroin, LSD, and\nhallucinogens other than LSD. With regard to nonmedical\n(illicit) use of prescription drugs, this study considered use\nof amphetamine/controlled stimulants, narcotics other than\nheroin, tranquilizers/benzodiazepines, and sedatives/barbit-\nurates. We dichotomized use of each of any of these nine\nillicit drugs into lifetime use: yes/no. Lifetime alcohol use\nwas dichotomized into use on 510 vs. 10 occasions.\nLifetime cigarette use was assessed via an ordinal item with\ndifferent answer options: never, once or twice, occasionally\nbut not regularly, regularly in the past, regularly now. We\ncollapsed the two regular smoker categories because no\nrecent marijuana users identified as past regular smokers.\nFinally, students who indicated use of marijuana in the last\n12 months were asked, ``What have been the most\nimportant reasons for your using marijuana or hashish?''\nStudents were asked to answer yes/no to 11 items (listed\nin Table 2).\nAnalyses\nDescriptive statistics were first examined. We then analyzed\ndata for the 10 597 students (Weighted n) with complete drug\nuse data. Specifically, we fit two conditional multinomial\nlogistic regression models to delineate correlates of (1)\nhashish use (regardless of other marijuana use), and (2) other\nmarijuana use (marijuana users not indicating hashish use)\ncompared to no use. The first model contained only socio-\ndemographic variables; the second model also contained drug\nuse variables. We controlled for a variety of sociodemo-\ngraphic variables commonly utilized in other MTF analyses\nwas associated with its own adjusted odds ratio (AOR) in\nexplaining each categorical outcome (compared to no use).\nTwo binary conditional models were then computed focusing\non the subsample of recent (12 months) marijuana users\n(n \u00bc 2650) in order to more directly examine differences\nbetween both forms. The first model contained only socio-\ndemographic variables and the second model also contained\ndrug use variables. For consistency, we entered the same\nsociodemographic covariates, but in the second model we also\nincluded (1) frequency of recent marijuana use, and (2)\nreasons for marijuana use (which were only assessed with\nregard to recent use).\nAll models were adjusted by cohort with indicators for\nMultivariable models included missing data indicators for\ncovariates with missing data in order to maximize sample\nsize. For example, 14.9% of the sample was missing race and\n26.3% were missing religiosity. Utilizing case-complete data\n(with no missing values) would have required the deletion of\nroughly half of the sample. Including a missing data indicator\nfor covariates with missing data allowed the full analytic\nsample to be retained. Thus, each model technically contained\nno missing data, which would have led to listwise deletion of\nmissing cases. In order to ensure that inclusion of missing\ndata indicators did not bias results, all models were\nrecomputed using case-complete data and results were\nalmost identical. This is also commonly done in other MTF\ncomplex survey data (28), weighted accorded to the study's\nsampling scheme, and conducted using SAS 9.3 software.\nResults\nAs shown in Table 1, the majority of the sample was white or\nresided in an MSA. A quarter (25.1%) of recent marijuana\nusers reported lifetime hashish use (9.4% of the full sample)\nand 18.3% of recent marijuana users reported recent\n(12 month) use of hashish (6.5% of the full sample).\nPercentages of students indicating specific reasons for use\nare presented in Table 2.\nWith regard to recent use among the full sample (Table 3),\ncompared to males, females were at low odds for hashish use,\nand older students were at decreased odds for both forms only\nwhen controlling for other drug use. Compared to white\nstudents, black and Hispanic students were at low odds for use\nof hashish, but when controlling for other drug use,\nblack students were at more than double the odds for\nusing each form of marijuana, and the Hispanic association\nlost significance. Residing in an MSA somewhat consistently\nincreased the odds for use of each form, and religiosity was\nprotective against both forms, particularly hashish, and\nhighest religiosity was associated with lower odds. Residing\nwith one or two parents was protective against use of both\nforms, but controlling for other drug use, residing with two\nparents remained a protective factor against other marijuana\nuse, but not hashish. Number of evenings out per week\nrobustly increased odds of use of each form, particularly\nhashish, even when controlling for other drug use. Higher\nincome from a job or other sources tended to be a strong risk\nfactor for use of each form, but when controlling for other\ndrug use, high income from job (4$50/week) increased odds\nmarijuana.

Compared to white students, black students were at\nstrongly reduced odds for hashish use and Hispanics were also\nat low risk; however, after controlling for other drug use,\nblack students were at half the odds for hashish use\nlonger significant. Compared to less religious students,\nmoderate and highly religious students were at low risk for\nhashish use, but these significant associations disappeared\nwhen controlling for other drug use. Going out 4\u00ad7 evenings\nper week and earning 4$50 per week from a job were risk\nfactors for hashish use, but these significant associations also\ndisappeared when controlling for other drug use. Frequent\nalcohol use, regular cigarette smoking and other illicit drug\nuse all increased odds for hashish use, and as frequency of\nrecent marijuana use increased, odds for use of hashish\nincreased.

More potent forms of\nmarijuana, such as hashish, may present a threat to adolescent\nhealth. This is the first paper to examine correlates of hashish\nuse in a nationally representative sample of US high school\nstudents. Data from MTF indicates that nearly half (45.5%) of\nhigh school seniors have used marijuana at some point in their\nlives, with a third (36.4%) using it in the past year (1). We\nTable 1.

Percentages were weighted so they do not always add up perfectly to 100%.\nhashish has been used by nearly one out of ten high school\nseniors. Our findings suggest that (1) users of both forms of\nmarijuana share many of the same risk factors; but (2) various\nfactors tend to be bigger risk factors for hashish use as\ncompared to general marijuana use.\nMany sociodemographic factors explaining general mari-\njuana use were similar to those of hashish use; however, we\ndelineated numerous differences in associations, which were\noften stronger for hashish. Females were consistently at low\nrisk for hashish use, but not general marijuana use. In some\nrespects, these findings corroborate previous research that\nfemales tend to be at low risk for ``harder'' drugs than males\nother marijuana, and it is primarily the males that are at\nhigher risk for use of this more potent form. Males are also at\nhigher risk for marijuana dependence (30,31) so further\nresearch is needed to examine whether this high potency form\nof marijuana increases the risk of problematic use patterns.\nOne particularly consistent difference across use of\ndifferent forms of marijuana was that students with higher\nincome (earning4$50 per week from a job) were at increased\nodds for use of hashish, but not for general marijuana, at least\nuntil controlling for other drug use. This corroborates prior\nresearch showing that access to higher income can be\nassociated with risk-taking behavior, including drug use\neconomic status \u00ad as indicated by higher income \u00ad or simply\nthe fact that money is often needed to purchase drugs\nImportant race/ethnicity findings were delineated from\nthese analyses. Compared to non-users, black and Hispanic\nstudents were at low risk for hashish use, but not other\nmarijuana. However, when controlling for other drug use,\nidentifying as Hispanic was no longer protective against\nhashish use, and black students were at more than double the\nrisk for use of both forms. Interestingly, looking more\nspecifically into the marijuana-using subsample, blacks were\n(again) only at half the odds for hashish use. So while black\nstudents are at risk for general marijuana use (compared to\nnon-users) while controlling for drug use and other factors,\nthey are actually at low risk for hashish use. This finding\ncan help inform interpretation of other national reports that\nalso suggest higher reported rates of marijuana use among\nwhites (e.g. the National Survey on Drug Use and Health\n[NSDUH]) (15,37). However, despite blacks using at lower\nrates into adulthood, marijuana-related arrest and incarcer-\nation rates are higher for blacks throughout many US cities\n(38). We found that among marijuana users, blacks are at\nlow risk for recent hashish use; however, further research\nneeds to be conducted to determine whether this racial-\nprotective factor paradoxically places blacks at greater risk\nfor arrest. Since hashish is often ingested rather than\nsmoked, blacks who smoke (e.g. in public) may be at\ngreater risk for arrest since most other non-hashish mari-\njuana is smoked and thus has a strong odor that can lead to\ndetection by authorities.\nAnother key finding was that other drug use was a robust\nrisk factor for hashish use. Specifically, other illicit drug use,\nregular cigarette smoking and frequent alcohol use each\nincreased the risk for use. Results also indicate that higher\nfrequency of cigarette smoking increases odds of use, but\nfrequency of recent marijuana use was perhaps the most\nrobust risk factor, with more frequent use more strongly\nincreasing odds of using hashish. While temporality could not\nbe determined, it may be that those who use non-hashish\nmarijuana very frequently are more likely to be exposed to\nand/or eventually use this more potent version of the drug. It\nmay also be that higher frequency marijuana use may be\nlinked to increased tolerance, leading many users to seek this\nmore potent marijuana product. In addition, including other\ndrug use in models often drowned out \u00ad or in some cases,\nreversed \u00ad associations of sociodemographic variables. Many\nstudies do not control for drug use in models, and this finding\npoints to the importance of doing so because associations\ncommonly change in light of these factors (25).\nIn addition, we examined how reasons for marijuana use\nrelate to hashish use and found that those who use to seek\ndeeper insights or understanding, a common reason for\nhallucinogen use (39), are at increased odds for hashish use.\nAlarmingly, those who said they are ``hooked'' on marijuana\nwere at nearly double the odds for use (with more than half of\nthose who felt they were hooked reporting hashish use). This\nfinding helps shed some light regarding understudied aspects\nof marijuana dependence. Perhaps in some cases hashish use\ncan be viewed as a form of marijuana use ``severity'' (40,41)\nas it tends to be more potent, used among more frequent\nmarijuana users, and many marijuana users who feel they are\ndependent also use this form of the drug.\nLimitations\nSince this study was cross-sectional, temporality could not be\ninferred. Missing data, particularly of religiosity and race, was\nproblematic; however, we included missing data indicators in\nmodels in order to avoid listwise deletion, as has been done in\nprevious studies. We also computed case-complete models\nwith no missing data to ensure that results from our fully-\nretained analytic sample were similar. Hashish (not collapsed\nwith general marijuana use) was only assessed in a sixth of the\nsample each year so we combined cohorts from five years into\na single cross-section to increase power. Hashish use did not\nsignificantly differ over time, giving us confidence in\ncombining cohorts. State-level MTF data are not available\nso it is unknown which students resided in a state where\nmedical marijuana was legal or available. It is possible that\nTable 2. Reasons for marijuana use among recent marijuana users\nn %\nBecause I am `hooked' \u00ad I have to have it 94 3.5\nstudents in states with medical marijuana dispensaries might\nhave had easier access to hashish (e.g. through diversion) than\nstudents in non-medical marijuana states. Although recre-\national use was illegal in all states during the years of this\nstudy, it is unknown how results apply to states where\nrecreational marijuana use is now legal. MTF also did not ask\nabout method of use (e.g. smoked, ingested). Finally,\nMTF does not include students who were no longer\nenrolled or dropped out of school before their final year of\nhigh school.\nConclusions\nThis was the first national study to examine correlates of\nhashish use. We delineated various correlates of use, which\nwere often different (or stronger) in comparison to use of\nother marijuana. Frequent marijuana users and those who use\nmarijuana because they feel they are ``hooked'' are at high\nrisk for hashish use, so in some instances hashish use can be\nviewed as an indicator of severity of marijuana use. These\nfindings can inform prevention in a time of increasing\nTable 3.
