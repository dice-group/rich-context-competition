In this paper\nwe suggest a taxonomy as how to evaluate post-merger performance on the basis\nof cost efficiency (CE). We categorise mergers a success that fulfill simultaneously\ntwo criteria. First, merged institutes must exhibit CE levels above the average of\nnon-merging banks. Second, banks must exhibit CE changes between merger and\nevaluation year above efficiency changes of non-merging banks. We employ this\ntaxonomy to characterise (successful) mergers in terms of various key-performance\nand structural indicators and investigate the implications for three important\npolicy issues. Our main conclusions are twofold. First, approximately every\nsecond merger is a success. Second, the margin of success is narrow, as the CE\ndifferential between merging and non-merging banks is one percentage point.\n",

Ongoing consolidation is a global phenomenon. However, it\nhas been most remarkable in the largest banking market in Europe: Germany.\nAccording to the most recent report on EU banking structures by the ECB the\nnumber of credit institutions in Germany declined by approximately 35 percent\nstill hosts most banks in Europe and exhibits the most fragmented market in this\ncomparison. This may explain why for example the ECB expects further bank\nmergers especially among relatively small savings and cooperative banks.\nAn evaluation of the success of past merger activity is therefore crucial. In\nthis paper, we assess mergers from an efficiency point of view. We estimate a\nstochastic cost frontier to measure the cost efficiency (CE) of banks. On the\nbasis of a comparison of both efficiency levels and changes of merging versus non-\nmerging banks we distinguish successful from non-successful mergers. Only those\nbanks that exhibit simultaneously higher levels and changes in efficiency after a\ntransaction are deemed a success.\nOur main result is that approximately every second merger is a success ac-\ncording to this taxonomy. However, the mean difference between merging and\nnon-merging banks is slim. On average, CE levels of the former are around a\nmere percentage point higher compared to the according cohort of non-merging\nbanks in a given year. This difference remains fairly stable for a range of one to\nnine years that elapsed after a deal.\nWe use this grouping to investigate if mergers that are subject to three deal-\nspecific characteristics are more or less often a success (or a failure). The first deal-\nspecific characteristic is the size of pre-merger CE differentials between targets\nand acquirers to capture the potential for learning benefits due to the transfer of\nmanagerial skills. Our results indicate that only in the short run larger differentials\nlead more often to efficieny gains. In the long run, akin partners succeed more\nfrequently in terms of CE.\nThe second deal-specific characteristic refers to the usefulness of mergers as a\ntool to resolve bank distress. Our results indicate that banks emerging from a deal\nthat involved a distressed target are approximately as often in the success group\nas non-distressed mergers. However, those deals where the acquiring institute is\ndistressed exhibit less frequently CE levels and changes above the benchmark set\nby non-merging banks.\nThe third characteristic refers to the regional proximity of merger partners.\nSavings bank mergers among institutions from the same municipality are in the\nshort and medium run less frequently a success compared to cooperatives. Poten-\ntially, the lower frequency of successful savings mergers may be due to the lack of\noptimal partners that are geographically close by.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nSeit 1990 ist die Anzahl von Banken weltweit massiv zur\u00fcckgegangen. Ins-\nbesondere die Konsolidierung im gr\u00f6\u00dften Bankenmarkt der EU, Deutschland, ist\nbemerkenswert. Gem\u00e4\u00df dem aktuellen Report der EZB zur Struktur des eu-\nrop\u00e4ischen Bankwesens ist die Anzahl deutscher Kreditinstitute zwischen 1997\nund 2003 um etwa 35 Prozent gesunken. Trotz dieser mit Abstand st\u00e4rksten Ab-\nnahme bleibt das deutsche Bankwesen fragmentiert und die Anzahl an Banken\nist nach wie vor die h\u00f6chste in der EU. Dies mag erkl\u00e4ren, weshalb zum Beispiel\ndie EZB auch f\u00fcr die nahe Zukunft weitere Bankfusionen, speziell im Sparkassen-\nund Genossenschaftsbankensektor, erwartet.\nEine Bewertung bisheriger Bankfusionen ist daher von gro\u00dfer Bedeutung. In\ndieser Studie bewerten wir Fusionen nach Effizienzgesichtspunkten. Wir sch\u00e4tzen\neine stochastic cost frontier, um die Kosteneffizienz (CE) einzelner Institute zu\nmessen. Wir identifizieren erfolgreiche Transaktionen, indem wir Effizienzniveaus\nund -\u00e4nderungen von fusionierenden und nicht fusionierenden Banken vergleichen.\nNur jene Banken, welche nach einer Fusion gleichzeitig h\u00f6here Effizienzniveaus\nund -\u00e4nderungen zeigen, werden als Erfolg gewertet.\nUnser Hauptergebnis ist, dass gem\u00e4\u00df dieser Einteilung etwa jede zweite Fu-\nsion einen Erfolg darstellt. Der durchschnittliche Effizienzunterschied zwischen\nfusionierenden und nicht fusionierenden Banken ist jedoch gering und betr\u00e4gt\netwa einen Prozentpunkt. Diese Differenz ist stabil f\u00fcr Zeitr\u00e4ume zwischen ein\nbis neun Jahren, nachdem eine Transaktion vollzogen wurde.\nWir untersuchen weiterhin, ob jene Bankfusionen besonders h\u00e4ufig erfolgreich\nbzw. nicht erfolgreich sind, welche durch drei bestimmte Charakteristika gekenn-\nzeichnet sind. Wir betrachten erstens die Effizienzunterschiede zwischen Banken\neine Periode vor der Fusion. Gro\u00dfe Unterschiede deuten auf ein hohes Potenzial\nzum Transfer von Managementf\u00e4higkeiten nach einer Verschmelzung hin. Die Er-\ngebnisse zeigen, dass gro\u00dfe Unterschiede nur unmittelbar nach einer Fusion h\u00e4u-\nfiger zu h\u00f6heren Effizienzgewinnen f\u00fchren. Auf mittlere und l\u00e4ngere Sicht sind\neher jene Fusionen erfolgreich, welche zwischen \u00e4hnlich effizienten Banken erfol-\ngen.\nWir betrachten zweitens, wie h\u00e4ufig Fusionen mit problembehafteten Banken\nein Erfolg sind. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Fusionen, in welchen das \u00fcber-\nnommene Institut sich in einer problematischen Situation befand, in etwa genauso\nh\u00e4ufig in der Erfolgsgruppe vertreten sind wie Fusionen zwischen Banken ohne\ngravierende Problemanzeichen. Es zeigt sich auch, dass Transaktionen mit pro-\nblembehafteten Banken als aufnehmendes Institut selten zu einer erfolgreichen\nTransaktion f\u00fchren.\nDie dritte Eigenschaft betrifft die regionale N\u00e4he der Partner einer Fusion.\nFusionen zwischen Sparkassen innerhalb einer politischen Gemeinde sind seltener\nein Erfolg als Genossenschaftsbankfusionen. Die geringere H\u00e4ufigkeit von erfolg-\nreichen Sparkassenfusionen deutet unter Umst\u00e4nden einen Mangel an geeigneten,\ngeografisch nah liegenden Partnern an.\nContents\n1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\n2 The German Bank Merger Wave . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\n2.1 Competitive Pressure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\n2.2 Consolidation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n2.3 Characteristics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n3 Facilitators and Obstacles to M&A Success . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n3.1 Transfer of Skills . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n3.2 Mergers and Distress . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n3.3 Mergers and regional proximity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n4 Methodology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\n4.1 Cost Efficiency . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\n4.2 Successful Mergers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n5 Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\n5.1 Identification of Successful Mergers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\n5.2 Characteristics of Mergers across Groups . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n5.3 Transfer of Skill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\n5.4 Distressed Mergers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n5.5 Regional Proximity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n6 Conclusion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\nEvaluating the German Bank Merger Wave1\n1 Introduction\nTime and again, practitioners and regulators claim that increased competition\nin the financial industry triggered profound changes in Germany's banking land-\nscape. The drastic and continuous decline of the number of competitors since\nthe early 1990s is one of the lighthouse cases put forward as an illustration of\nthis claim. In fact, the number of banks constituting the three pillars of German\nResearch on the dynamics of US banking markets is fairly abundant, but\nour knowledge of the effects of German bank mergers remains limited. This is\ncumbersome because bankers, regulators and the public all have an interest to\nevaluate the effects of bank mergers.\nA clear understanding of post-merger performance can, for example, facilitate\ndecision making of bankers on the one hand, and successful future supervisory\nwork on the other. To our knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the con-\nsolidation effects of the merger wave among all German cooperative and savings\nbanks. In this paper we suggest a taxonomy to evaluate bank mergers. The ana-\nlytical workhorse is cost efficiency (CE) as measured by stochastic frontier analy-\nsis. We pursue three objectives. First, we want to identify successful mergers on\nthe basis of CE. Second, we want to characterise successful as opposed to unsuc-\ncessful mergers. Third, we want to apply the taxonomy to evaluate the influence\nof potential skill transfers between merger partners, the success of mergers as a\nmeans of resolving distress and the impact of prevailing regulation on geographical\nlimitations for merger success.\nWe organise the paper as follows. In section 2 we employ data provided by\nthe Bundesbank to supply an extensive description of market dynamics in these\ntwo important bank pillars. This descriptive analysis serves as the fundament to\nsection 3 where we formulate a set of questions to address three particularities in\nGerman banking. Section 4 explains the methodology for measuring CE and how\nwe identify successful mergers. In section 5 we present results on characteristics\nof merging and non-merging banks. We further investigate the effects of skill\ntransfer, distress and regulation on the success of mergers. We provide recom-\nmendations with regard to previously raised issues on the basis of fresh empirical\nevidence. Section 6 supplies some final thoughts.\n1This paper is the result of a research cooperation between the Utrecht School of Economics\nand the supervision department of the Deutsche Bundesbank. I thank participants of the\nNAKE day held at the Dutch central bank, the German Banking System Architecture (GBSA)\nworkshop and the Tjalling C.Koopmanns seminar on Policy Issues in Mergers, Acquisitions and\nAlliances. In particular, I am grateful to Clemens Kool, Jaap Bos, Reinhard H. Schmidt, Jan-\nPieter Krahnen, Dennis C. Mueller and Matthew Rhodes-Kropf for helpful comments. I thank\nthe Bundesbank for the permission to employ data. All remaining errors are mine.\n2The three pillars are commercial, savings and cooperative banks.\n2 The German Bank Merger Wave\nOur starting point in this paper is a stylised fact - German banks merged. The lit-\nerature on bank mergers suggest a variety of possible reasons for this observation.3\nBut as put forward by Amel et al. (2004), the majority of motives advocated are\nnot mutually exclusive and thus rather reflect attempts to rationalise as to why\nbanks merge instead of representing exclusive explanations.\nThis indeterminacy of merger motives notwithstanding, the causal chain of\nevents is according to many scholars surprisingly similar, see for example Berger\n(2003). Decreased information asymmetries of investors, lower switching costs for\nborrowers, non-bank intermediaries venturing into traditional banking activities\nand more leeway for incumbent banks to expand operations both in terms of\ngeographic and product scope all lead to increasing competitive pressure.\nTo counter these pressures, banks engage in mergers in order to utilise re-\nsources more efficiently. Likewise, a profound lack of efficient operations can lead\nbanks to face financial distress. To resolve distress, banks may exit the market\nthrough mergers.4\nHence, the effects of mergers should ideally affect efficiency in a positive way.\nTherefore, many studies on merger effects focus on a comparison of the productive\nefficiency of banking firms. We follow this notion and provide in this section a\ndescription of the major characteristics accompanying the German merger wave.\n2.1 Competitive Pressure\nWe have at our disposal data on all savings and cooperative banks for the period\nfrom 1993 until 2003. We focus on these two pillars for three reasons. First, they\naccount for more than a third of total assets managed in the German banking\nsystem and represent more than 80 percent of all banks in terms of number.\nSecond, the vast majority of mergers occurred among these institutes. While\na number of studies focus on mergers among publicly listed banks, this study\nprovides to our knowledge the only evidence on the (lack of) success of mergers\nfor these banking sectors as a whole. Third, Hackethal (2004) points out that\nsavings and cooperative banks are vital to the backbone of Germany's economy,\nnamely the \"Mittelstand\". Therefore, we are particularly concerned about the\nsuccess of bank mergers in these banking groups.\nThe data were obtained from the Bundesbank. All banks operating in Ger-\nmany annually report balance sheet and profit and loss account data. To grasp\nthe dynamics of competitive pressure during the last decade, consider table 1.\nProfitability as measured by return on equity (ROE) more than halved in\nthis period. If competition increases, prices are driven down to marginal cost. As\nmarkets approach perfect competition, textbook economic theory predicts that no\nadditional rents above marginal cost can be realised. We cannot observe marginal\ncost. But the development of ROE indicates in any case that comfortable profit\nbolsters during the early 1990s no longer prevail among German banks.\n3For example, the OECD (2000) lists technical change, globalisation and deregulation as\nthree major triggers for mergers in the financial industry.\n4Koetter et al. (2005) find that banks with weak financial profiles are more likely to merge.\n1) Return on equity; 2) Cost-income ratio; 3) Net interest margin;\nNote: ROE, CI and NIM of savings and cooperative banks in percent.\nThe fact that cost-income ratios (CI) stayed fairly constant in the course of\nevents signals to us that the deterioration of profitability cannot be explained by\npoor bank management alone. In such a case, administrative expenses as a share\nof operating revenue should have soared in lock-step. However, with the exception\nof the period involving stock market crashes around the turn of the century, we\nobserve that mean CI ratios seem to have been kept in check on an ongoing basis.\nAt the same time, deteriorating net interest margins (NIM) could reflect how\nspreads between lending and borrowing are competed away. Seemingly, ongoing\nconsolidation, as illustrated by the declining number of banks, did not result in\nbanks seeking monopoly rents. Individual cooperative and savings banks might\nstill be too small to exercise market power. The mean size of banks increased\nfor our sample from around C\n= 300m to a still fairly small scale of operations of\nC\n= 820m. We interpret our findings as indication that despite increasing mean\nsize banks continued to face considerable competition. Consequently, excessive\nmarket power is at first sight a minor concern.\nNot a single bank exited the market due to outright failure during the ob-\nservation period. The consolidation nonetheless left a profound imprint on Ger-\nmany's banking structure. Local market concentration increased by more than\n25 percent.5 Measured by total assets under management per county and year\nwe record an increase in the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index from just below 3,000\nIn sum, simple key performance indicators (KPI) convey in line with Bikker\nand Bos (2005) that competitive pressures increased among German banks during\nthe last decade despite increasing concentration. A massively reduced number of\ninstitutes bears witness to a changing bank market structure. The brunt of these\nchanges is in fact borne by mergers. The massive reduction of the number of\nbanks demands an evaluation of the success of mergers and the implications for\n5Note, that we do not attempt here a formal investigation of the causal relation between\nmarket power, concentration and prices. We rather restrict ourselves to simply acknowledge that\nmarket structure changed substantially in terms of markedly fewer banks managing increasingly\nlarger volumes of assets.\nthe industry in a more detailed fashion.\nThe Bundesbank collected data on 1,417 targets that were acquired during the\nat our disposal for each of these transactions.7 Table 2 provides data on the mean\nsize of acquiring, target and non-merging banks in the year prior to the merger.\nWe depict these measures by banking group. Additionally, we supply both the\ntotal volume and the number of acquirer and targets.\nTable 2: Size and number of mergers per sector\nSavings banks\nMerger year Acquirer1) Targets1) Non-merging1) Total TA2) N Acquirer3) N Target\nCooperative banks\n1) Mean total assets in mn Euro one year prior to transaction; 2) Sum of acquired assets in mn Euro\n3) Multiple acquirers only included once per year; serial acquirers included in each merger year.\nIn accordance with Lang and Welzel (1996), we observe that most mergers\noccurred among cooperative banks. While the number of German savings banks\nend of 2003, the corresponding decline of cooperative banks is 45 percent, reflect-\nConsequently, the merger process in the two sectors might differ. For example,\nregulation and/or government ownership potentially shelters savings banks to a\nlarger extent from competition compared to cooperatives. We then would expect\nmarket structure and profitability measures to exhibit these differences. We there-\nfore investigate in the next subsection some simple performance and structural\nindicators per sector in the year of a merger.\n6The total number of targets is 1,465 in the reference period, representing a decline from\ndata on either the acquirer or the target. We lack information prior to 1994 and after 2002.\n7The number of acquirers is below the number of targets due to, first, serial acquirers and,\nsecond, multiple acquisitions in a given year by the same acquirer.\nBecause we focus in this paper on an evaluation of the (lack of) success of\nbank mergers, we are less interested to add another, to put it in terms of Amel\net al. (2004), rationalisation to the literature as to why banks merged. We limit\nourselves to extend our set of KPI introduced in section 2.1 by three additional\nindicators. In doing so we aim to assess the plausibility of three frequently raised\nmotives by simple characteristics per bank. Let us briefly discuss the three motives\nmentioned before we turn to the ratios in the next section.\nA first reason as to why banks might merge is to enhance productivity of\nlabour. An intuitive illustration of this motive relates to technical advances in\nbanking. For example, Valverde et al. (2004) provide evidence that the increased\nuse of automatic teller machines and electronic payment systems fostered the\nreduction of (labour intensive) branch offices. It is conceivable that banks aim\nto enhance the productivity of labour by means of mergers. As German labour\nlaws are restrictive, restructuring the branching network of two banks operating\nwith considerable overlap is easier compared to simply laying off employees and\nsubstituting them with technology.\nSecondly, time and again practitioners hypothesise that merging banks aim\nto realise economies of scale.8 Table 2 illustrates the small size especially of co-\noperative banks. Cost pressures due to squeezed interest margins and too small\noperations to spread fixed costs fuel the (perceived) need to expand the asset base\nof these banks. The popularity of this notion among practitioners is vividly illus-\ntrated by a quote from Wolfgang Arnold, vice president of the German Bankers\nAssociation:\n\"[...] Ein alter \u00f6konomischer Lehrsatz befasst sich mit den Economies\nof Scale. Wenn man erforderliche Gr\u00f6\u00dfenordnung nicht selbst erre-\nichen kann, schlie\u00dft man sich zusammen und optimiert \u00fcber die Volu-\nmina kostentr\u00e4chtige Abl\u00e4ufe. [...]\"9\nWhile we point out that the academic literature fails consistently, somewhat\nstubbornly, to find evidence in favour of economies of scale, we devise below a\nsimple indicator variable to learn if successful mergers exhibit characteristics that\nsupport this motive.10\nFor an illustration of a third popular motive, consider the number and volume\nof deals depicted in table 2. The second peak of merger activity around the\nturn of the century is associated with turmoil in security markets.11 Banks that\nexpanded their securities business during rallying stock markets may have fallen\nvictim to mergers after the stock market crashed. Struggling banks with relatively\n8According to Amel et al. (2004) this is probably one of the most popular potential motives.\n9Press conference held in Frankfurt am Main on September 18, 2002. Available at\nhttp://www.bdb.de. The unofficial translation is: \"[...] An established economic proposition\nconcerns economies of scale. If one cannot achieve the required size of operations individually,\none combines these operations to optimise cost-intensive workflows by means of higher quanti-\ntities processed. [...]\"\n10Importantly, we do not claim here to conduct a formal investigation of the issue. An example\nofa European study that estimates economies of scale is Lang and Welzel (1996).\n11After a period of rallying stock markets, the stock market index DAX tumbled from an\nlarge non-interest income shares potentially turned prey to banks that aimed to\ndiversify income sources at comparably favourable conditions.12\nAs noted throughout we do not assume that any of these rationales is solely \"re-\nsponsible\" for mergers to occur. However, if these frequently encountered merger\nmotives - productivity, scale and scope enhancement - indeed drive mergers, we\nexpect to observe that our simple descriptives reflect these goals and improve after\na merger. We turn next to these characteristics across merging and non-merging\nbanks to obtain the stylised facts on bank characteristics after a merger.\nIf we assume that increased competition is indeed a major driving force of mergers\nand therefore changing market structures, we are interested in learning about the\nimmediate implications for bank's post-merger profitability and costs. In table\n3, we depict mean KPI to compare merging and non-merging banks across bank\nsectors in the year a deal occurred.13\nTable 3: Mean characteristics of merging versus non-merging banks\nSavings banks Cooperative banks\nKPI Non Merger p-value6) Non Merger p-value6)\n1) Net interest margin in percent; 2) Hirschman-Herfindahl Index in points;\n3) Productivity approximated as FTE per mn Euro of total assets; 4) Unit\ncost in cents of total operating cost per Euro of total assets; 5) Income\nstructure as fee over total revenue in percent; 6) Test for equality of means\nNote: Excluding pre-merger observations of ultimately merging banks.\nProfitability differed significantly for both banking groups between merging\nand non-merging banks by 5 to 7 percentage points of ROE. Likewise, cost pres-\nsure is higher for banks that just merged, as measured by higher CI ratios. How-\never, comparably poor KPI may result from a recent transaction, for example,\ndue to the integration of a new sales force or from incurring additional advisor\nfees during the transaction.\nLocal concentration, measured by HHI, is higher among those banks that\nmerged, especially for savings banks. Those banks that merged are thus operating\nin local markets with at times markedly fewer competitors. This can imply market\npower. But at the same time mean NIM do not differ a lot between merging and\nnon-merging banks. Furthermore, for savings banks mean NIM is not significantly\n12This motive indicator variable relates to the literature that seeks to estimate economies of\nscope. An example of studies along this strand is Lang and Welzel (1998).\n13This is in contrast to table 2, where mean KPIs refer to pre-merger years.\ndifferent despite substantially higher concentration among merging savings banks.\nRent seeking therefore seems to be an issue of less importance in our sample.\nBut while we find only limited evidence for rent seeking, higher concentra-\ntion may still imply that market discipline is lacking and therefore banks fail to\nmonitor costs carefully. Foregone cost savings imply unnecessary reductions of\nproducer surplus and are thus undesirable. This line of thought is supported by\nhigher CI ratios for merging banks of both sectors, when paired with higher mean\nIn section 2.2 we collected three potential motives as to why banks merge.\nThese are to enhance labour productivity, to reduce fixed costs relative to total\nassets and to diversify income sources. While we abstain from a formal investiga-\ntion of these motives due to reasons mentioned above and in Amel et al. (2004),\nwe devise three simple indicators to gain some insight.\nTo grasp the labour productivity of merging and non-merging banks, Prod,\nwe relate the number of full time equivalent employees (FTE) per bank to total\nassets. While the difference in table 3 is small, we find that merging banks\nemploy significantly more FTE per million Euro of total assets than non-merging\nbanks. According to this rough measure, non-merging banks use labour more\nproductively.\nTo investigate if economies of scale are a plausible merger motive, we relate\nbanks' operating costs to total assets to approximate unit costs, UC. Our data\nindicate that among small cooperative banks the difference between merging and\nnon-merging banks is significant but small. For each Euro of total assets coop-\nerative banks incur roughly 6 Euro cent in costs. Somewhat lower unit costs of\nsavings banks are in line with larger mean sizes reported in table 2. But minuscule\ndifferences between merging and non-merging banks indicate that scale economies\nare not a primary reason to merge.15\nA third potential motive is the notion that banks merge to diversify their\nincome sources. We test if fee income as a share of total revenue, INC, differs\nsignificantly between merging and non-merging banks. While we reject the null\nhypothesis of different mean fee income shares for savings banks, we find evidence\nthat merging cooperative banks exhibit an earnings structure significantly differ-\nent from non-merging banks. The relatively large difference suggests that tapping\nalternative income sources could be a reason for (cooperative) bank mergers.\nTo sum, we find that merging and non-merging banks differ with respect to\nprofitability and cost management both in the savings and cooperative banking\nsector. These KPI measures indicate that merging banks perform worse than\nnon-merging ones in the transaction year. Regarding interest margins, market\nconcentration, labour productivity, unit costs and income sources, we receive\nmixed signals depending on the banking sector. Merging savings bank operate\nin significantly higher concentrated local markets and suffer from lower labour\n14Note that the high p-value for the difference in mean test for cooperative banks may be due\nto outliers in the data. As we intend in this section to describe the stylized facts we included all\nbanks which submitted data to the Bundesbank and were thus in operation. When estimating\nthe efficient cost frontier we conducted robustness checks by excluding extreme observations.\nResults remained qualitatively unaffected.\n15While we are aware of the crudeness of our measure, this simple plausibility check is in line\nwith studies that consistently fail to identify scale economies gains due to mergers.\nproductivity; merging cooperative banks exhibit a higher share of fee income.\nRegarding market concentration, differences between merging and non-merging\nbanks are either minuscule and/or insignificant.\nIn line with Koetter et al. (2005), the described characteristics indicate that\nmerging banks perform at best mediocre. But with regard to the evaluation of\nthe success of mergers, we argue that all of the discussed measures suffer from\ntwo major limitations.\nThe first caveat refers to the development of KPI over time. For example, lower\nlabour productivity in the transaction year itself may merely reflect the rigidity\nof German labour laws. Adjustments of the labour force are time-consuming as,\nfor example, numerous employees at savings banks are protected by civil servant\nstatus. Hence, large scale labour force reduction is only possible by using natural\nfluctuation rather than Anglo-Saxon style lay-off waves. Therefore, it is in our\nview crucial to track the performance of merged institutes over some time.\nThe second caveat is that any of the above mentioned measures provide little\ninformation about what the optimal KPI could have been for banks operating un-\nder potentially markedly different circumstances. After all, the share of the differ-\nence between mean ROE for merging and non-merging banks that is attributable\nto poor management of the bank versus deteriorating economic conditions or sheer\nbad luck remains unclear. We simply cannot state by observing some increased\npost merger ROE whether the firm performed optimally - a higher return after\nthe merger might still be far from what could have been attained.\nAn alternative strand in the literature therefore suggests benchmarking banks\naccording to their ability to convert inputs into outputs.16 We employ cost effi-\nciency (CE) to measure the success of mergers. This approach ranks firms relative\nto an optimal industry cost function.\nThe appeal of this measure is that we evaluate mergers on the basis of simple\ntextbook microeconomic theory. We assume that banks operate on markets that\nare appropriately described by perfect competition.17 We expect a cost minimis-\ning firm to produce its outputs by demanding required inputs subject to prevailing\ninput prices. We then estimate an optimal cost function under the assumption\nthat deviations from best practice are, first, due to random noise and, second, due\nto inefficient allocation of inputs. Intuitively, no bank can incur systematically\nhigher costs compared to competitors. To avoid being driven out of the market\nany bank has to demand inputs in optimal proportions to produce a given output\nvector. We argue that this also holds for banks which potentially pursue alterna-\ntive objectives - in the long run no firm can afford systematically higher costs for\nidentical production factors employed.18\nWe postpone a formal introduction of our empirical model as to measure cost\nefficiency to section 4. Beforehand, we discuss three characteristics that may\nfoster or hamper successful mergers in German banking.\n17For the validity of this assumption see also Bikker and Bos (2005).\n18In contrast, it may very well be possible that German savings and cooperative banks may not\nstrictly maximise their revenues as to maximise profits. Therefore, ROE and other traditional\nperformance measures may fall short to assess the success of bank mergers. But even with these\nphilanthropic co-objectives it is plausible that while revenues may not be maximised any bank\nhas to optimise its costs when allocating resources to provide financial services.\n3 Facilitators and Obstacles to M&A Success\nThe preceding subsection shows that we have to, first, distinguish between suc-\ncessful and unsuccessful mergers. Second, we are interested in the development of\nbank-specific characteristics as measured by the previously introduced KPI over\ntime. As opposed to these bank-specific characteristics, merger success might\ncrucially depend on characteristics related to both how the deal is conducted\nand the environment in which it takes place. We refer to these as deal-specific\ncharacteristics and we investigate the following three:19\n1. Transfer of skills between merging banks\n2. Mergers as distress resolution tool\n3. Influence of regional demarcation\nWith the exception of the influence of regional demarcation on merger success,\nwe regard these deal characteristics as endogenous to merger management. That\nis, we assume that regulation cannot be influenced by the management in charge\nof conducting the merger. Rather, investigation of the relation between regional\ndemarcation and merger success intends to shed light on the costs and benefits\nof this arrangement. In contrast, the former two characteristics are the result\nof decisions made by management, i.e. if and how to transfer skills or to merge\nwith another bank in order to resolve distress. In fact, our merger data allows us\nto classify mergers according to these three criteria and thus learn if deals with\nparticular characteristics are more or less frequently a success (or a failure).\nSubsequently, we motivate each of the three either by means of evidence from\nthe literature or on the basis of merger data available. In addition to the devel-\nopment of merging banks' KPI, these three deal characteristics will serve later on\nas a guideline to structure the discussion of our results in section 5.\n3.1 Transfer of Skills\nLang and Welzel (1998) investigate merger effects for a sample restricted to co-\noperative banks in the state of Bavaria. They find that in 53% of all mergers the\nacquirer is more cost efficient than the target. However, only 18% of all merged\nbanks with higher ex ante acquirer CE managed to exhibit above average effi-\nciency growth after the merger. In contrast, they find that 35% of all mergers\nwith positive ex ante CE differences yield below average CE growth after the\nmerger. They conclude that these acquirers failed to transfer their superior CE\nskills to the target.\nThis finding reflects that the transfer of cost management skills matters a\nlot to determine success but that it can be difficult to accomplish. If banks with\nsuperior CE performance manage to lift the merged units' overall CE, mergers are\n19Clearly, there is a virtually infinite number of additional factors that may matter, for ex-\nample board compositions or local macroeconomic environments. Our choice here is motivated\nby the availability of data and the policy relevance of the deal characteristic from our point of\nview.\na desirable because they improve the competitive position of a bank and thereby\nstrengthen the stability of the whole banking system.20\nWhether a beneficial transfer of skill is successful depends on two major fac-\ntors. First, the size of the ex ante differential. On the one hand, a larger differ-\nential can indicate that cost management skills of one of the partners are clearly\nbelow those of the other partner. Then, potential for improvement is easily iden-\ntified. Relatively large gains may be quickly realised by simple imitation. An\nexample is that one bank pursues excessive spending on real estate resulting in\nexcessive office capacities. Switching to facilities closer to market cost then en-\ntails a quick win if switching costs are low enough. On the other hand, a large\ndifferential can indicate that one partner suffers from substantial problems that\ncannot be easily remedied. An example is a funding structure incurring too high\ninterest payments. If these are stipulated in contracts there is presumably little\na new management team can do in the short run.\nThe second factor refers to whether it is the target or the acquirer that exhibits\nhigher CE. Acquirers that are dominant in terms of CE may very well command\nsufficient power to enforce their management procedures on the target. However,\nwe have no reason to expect ex ante that the acquirer is indeed superior. Because\nof the respective government and member ownership structure of savings and co-\noperative banks (see Altunbas et al. 2001), we know that ownership shares are not\nfreely traded. Consequently, majority stakes cannot be accumulated in a hostile\nfashion. The absence of a full-fledged market for corporate control may imply\nthat objectives other than value maximisation are important for determining the\nacquirer and target in a merger. If it is indeed to some extent a political process\nthat determines the role in a merger, it may turn out that a large but potentially\nless efficient bank is the acquirer. Then, it can be less likely that best practise\nfrom the target is wholeheartedly embraced by the new organisation.\nWhether such scenarios prevail and whether we can observe particular com-\nbinations of pre-merger CE differentials to yield systematically more (or less)\nsuccessful mergers remains an empirical question that we address below. This\nway, bankers, head organisations and regulators can evaluate pending mergers on\nthe basis of pre-merger CE differentials to promote beneficial combinations that\nare likely to improve CE.\n3.2 Mergers and Distress\nAs no single bank went into outright bankruptcy it is reasonable to expect that a\nnumber of bank mergers served the purpose to remedy distress. Table 4 underpins\nthat around 100 mergers are identified as distressed transactions.\ntressed banks from the Bundesbank's database on default information. We focus\nhere only on those events that represent restructuring efforts by means of merg-\ners.21 As can be seen in table 4, distressed mergers are not limited to cases where\na bank becomes a target. In fact, it occurred equally often that distress resulted in\n20How far such joint CE must be lifted depends on the definition of a successful merger. We\ndiscuss that matter at length in the next subsection.\nTable 4: Distressed merger partners\nYear None Target Acquirer Both Total\nNote: Savings and cooperative banks.\nthe bank acquiring a non-distressed bank. Only in six cases, both parties involved\nin the merger were classified as distressed by Bundesbank records.\nIn sum, our data permit identification of mergers that received regulatory\nattention due to distress as opposed to transactions involving banks that are not\nidentified by Bundesbank records as distressed mergers. We want to examine if\nmergers are a successful instrument to ensure financial stability and soundness.\nTo this end, we analyse below if distressed mergers are relatively more or less\nfrequently identified as a success.\n3.3 Mergers and regional proximity\nThe process of merging involves additional important institutions next to the\nBundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (\"Bun-\ndesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin\"). These are the respective\nhead organisations of the savings and cooperative bank sectors, DSGV and BVR,\nWhile supervision authorities adhere to principles of financial soundness and\nstability, representatives of these head organisations guard what is known as the\nprinciple of regional demarcation (\"Regionalprinzip\").22 This principle is de facto\nenforced among both cooperative and savings banks. It stipulates that regional\nbanks of these sectors must not conduct operations beyond the borders of their\nassigned region. The objective of this regulation is to ensure that rural and\neconomically weak areas are also supplied with financial services in Germany.\nConsequently, many mergers among savings and cooperatives involve banks\nwhich are geographically close to each other. Table 5 depicts the number of\nmergers where both target and acquirer originate from the same region.\nIn 64 percent of the events, mergers among savings banks involve targets and\nacquirers that originated from the same county (\"Kreis\").23 Approximately 15\npercent of all mergers in this group concern banks from the same municipality\n22Legal definitions of financial soundness and stability, to which both Bundesbank and BaFin\nadhere, are outlined in a series of laws. The German Banking Act (\"Kreditwesengesetz, KWG\")\nis the most important one and is complemented by a number of regulations.\n23Equal to the sum of county and municipality mergers over total, i.e. (86+26)/176, as one\ncounty is distinguished into multiple municipalities.\nTable 5: Regional origin of merging banks\nRegion County Municipality Total\nYear Savings Coop's Savings Coop's Savings Coop's\n(\"Gemeinde\").24 For cooperative banks regional proximity of merger partners is\neven more evident. In almost 80 percent of all the cases, both parties are from\nthe same county. A quarter of all cooperative bank mergers involve banks from\nthe same municipality.\nThere are two main reasons why mergers in the same region can be superior.\nFirst, it is possible that these transactions serve the purpose of reaching some\nrequired minimum size to operate efficiently. If two banks serve the same com-\nmunity with considerable overlap in their customer base, joined operations can\nhelp reduce unit costs if excess capacities, for example branches or employees,\nare reduced. Second, mergers among banks from the same vicinity may be su-\nperior because the acquirer is presumably familiar with local market conditions,\nfor example weaknesses and strengths of local corporate firms, local politics or\ncustomer habits.\nOn the other hand, it is possible that the Regionalprinzip implies a lack of po-\ntential partners in a given region. Then it is more likely that target and acquirer\nmay fail to complement each other, e.g. in terms of product range or funding\nstructure. Mergers of banks located fairly close to each other might merely reflect\nrestrictions imposed by regulation. Another reason why close regional proximity\ncan result in inferior post merger performance is a lack of regional (income) di-\nversification. The merged institute's revenue basis will be further concentrated\nwithin confined boundaries, thus exposing the bank to a larger degree to local\nmacroeconomic conditions.25\nIn this paper, we abstain from a full-fledged analysis of the costs and benefits of\nregional demarcation. However, we investigate whether mergers between nearby\nbanks are more often a success or not.\n24Ideally, we investigate the geographical distance between target(s) and acquirer given the\nprevailing regional demarcation issued by the head organisations. Alas, this information is\nnot available and we have to resort to publicly available regional indicators of counties and\nmunicipalities where banks are located. The number of counties with banks is 438 and the\naccording number of municipalities is 2,333.\n25Note an important caveat. Regions assigned to banks are not publicly available. There-\nfore, we have to resort here to available regional identifiers, namely counties and municipalities.\nHence, our approach to investigate the relation between regional proximity and successful merg-\ners should be understand as a crude approximation of the implications of the principle of regional\ndemarcation only.\n4 Methodology\nOur first objective is to measure cost efficiency in a consolidating bank landscape\ntaking mergers explicitly into account. As noted by Lang and Welzel (1999), this\nrequires in a panel setting to model merged banks as new entities. This allows\nbanks after a transaction to follow a new efficiency path over time. Therefore, we\noutline first our efficiency model.\nNext, we suggest a taxonomy to define successful mergers that takes into\naccount both efficiency development and the efficiency of non-merging banks.\nWe estimate cost efficiency (CE) with stochastic frontier analysis.26 We use the\nintermediation approach and assume that banks produce three outputs. These\nare interbank and commercial loans, y1\n, respectively, and securities, y3\n.\nTo this end banks utilise three inputs, which are demanded subject to prevailing\nprices, wi\n, and the technology constraint, depicted by a transformation function\nT(y, x, z). A bank employs fixed assets, x1\n, labour, x2\n, and borrowed funds, x3\n. In\naddition, we include equity capital, z, to account for alternative funding sources\nand heterogeneous risk-preferences among banks. Our sample includes all savings\nTo estimate an optimal cost frontier for this unbalanced panel, we follow\nGreene (2005) and use a bank-specific fixed effects stochastic frontier model with\ntime-variant inefficiency. Non-random differences in size, sector and regional lo-\ncation of banks are now captured by the bank-specific fixed effects. To account\nexplicitly for ongoing consolidation, we follow the approach suggested by Lang\nand Welzel (1999). A merging bank is treated as a new bank. We allow a merged\nbank to follow a different optimal cost path inasmuch as each bank involved in a\nmerger is treated with a separate fixed effect k\n.\nThis approach is markedly different from, say, including a dummy variable for\nmergers in the cost frontier specification. Such a model boils down to estimating\none identical intercept for all banks that merge, which might be different from the\ncost functions intercept of non-merging banks. However, it is a strong assumption\nthat the cost intercept is identical for all merging banks. The reduced form of\noptimal cost is specified using the translog functional and takes the following\n26We focus on CE as cost pressure is more frequently cited as one of the major reasons in\nGerman banking to merge. A natural extension is to examine profit efficiency (PE). Given the\nlimited scope of this paper this approach is postponed for further research.\n27To account for technological change we also include a time trend and interaction terms.\n28We impose homogeneity and symmetry restrictions as in Lang and Welzel (1996).\nln Ckt\n= k\n+\ni\nln wikt\n+\nm\nln ymkt\nln zkt\n+\nij\nln wikt\nln wjkt\n+\nim\nln wikt\nln ymkt\n+\nmn\nln ymkt\nln ynkt\n+\n(ln zkt\n+\ni\nln wikt\nln zkt\n+\nm\nln ymk\nln zkt\nt +\n+\ni\nln wikt\nt +\nm\nln ymkt\nt + kt\n.\nIn any year t, a bank k can deviate from optimal cost due to random noise,\nvkt\n, or inefficient use of in- and outputs, ukt\n. To distinguish these two effects,\nwe specify a composed total error, kt\n. For a cost frontier inefficiency leads to\nabove frontier costs. Therefore, the total error is kt\n= ukt\n+ vkt\n. The random\nerror term vkt\nis assumed i.i.d. with vkt  N(0, 2\nv\n) and independent of the\nexplanatory variables. The inefficiency term is i.i.d. with ukt  N|(0, 2\nu\n)| and\nindependent of the vkt\n. It is drawn from a non-negative distribution truncated at\nzero. Greene (2005) further notes that the k\n's are allowed to be correlated with\nthe cost function variables, ykt\n, wkt\nand zkt\n. Any systematic deviations from the\nfrontier due to heterogeneity across banks are captured by the fixed effect.\nNote that inefficiency can vary over time but, apart from the distributional\nassumption, is not further specified to follow any particular trend over time. This\napproach has the virtue that efficiency can, for example, deteriorate in the imme-\ndiate aftermath of a merger but is able to \"recover\" after some time has elapsed.\nAt the same time, the cost frontier and the associated development of inefficiency\nis bank-specific, as it depends to some degree on the fixed effect.\nTo allow banks to enter a new efficiency path, we assign a new identifier to\neach bank after a merger. To illustrate this approach consider figure 1.\nWe assume for the sake of expositional ease that all banks A through D ex-\nhibit a positive, linear trend of efficiency over time.29 Subject to its fixed effect,\nD\n, bank D illustrates a bank that is not merging during the observation pe-\nriod and exhibits continuously improving CE. Assume now that compared to the\nnon-merging bank D two relatively less efficient banks A and B merge. Let the\nrelatively more efficient bank A acquire the relatively less efficient, but faster im-\nproving, bank B in period 5. Then, efficiency differentials discussed in section 3.1\ncan be measured as the CE differential one year prior to merging. To adequately\nevaluate the CE effects of merging, Lang and Welzel (1999) stress the importance\nto treat the merged banks as if it is a new entrant to the market. Following their\nsuggestion we therefore assign a new identifier to this merged institute, C. Esti-\nmated optimal cost, and hence efficiency, for this \"new\" bank are then subject to\n29We stress again that such a development is by no means pre-determined by our specification\nof the frontier. It exclusively serves the purpose of graphical illustration.\nFigure 1: Treatment of merging banks\nBank A\nBank B\nBank C\nBank D\nEfficiency\nTime\nBank A\nBank B\nBank C\nBank D\nEfficiency\nTime\na new separate fixed effect. Put differently, the location of the optimal frontier for\nthis new emerged bank C is different from that of bank A and bank B. Thereby,\nwe allow efficiency to develop over time on a different path compared to that of\nthe two banks prior to the merger.\nWe are interested not only in a comparison to non-merging banks but especially\nto distinguish successful and unsuccessful mergers. Let us therefore turn to our\ndefinition of successful mergers on the basis of cost efficiency.\n4.2 Successful Mergers\nIdentification of successful mergers on the basis of the level of efficiency alone\nmight be misleading. Consider as an example a bank that merged in 1995. Assume\nit exhibits CE of 80 percent in 1997 relative to an average CE of non-merging\nbanks of 75 percent. On this basis alone the merger may then be considered a\nsuccess. But if the bank exhibited cost efficiency of 85 percent in the year of the\nmerger, 1995, the decline by 5 percent is hardly an achievement.\nWe therefore compare mergers along two dimensions. The first dimension is\nthe acquirer's change in CE in year t relative to the year of the merger. The\nsecond is the level of CE of the merged institute in year t after the merger.\nThe first dimension captures changes in CE. As many practitioners point out,\npotential gains require some time until they materialise. Therefore, we report\nefficiency changes for a range of time t from 1 until 9.30 To evaluate whether a\nparticular merger was successful, we use as a benchmark the average efficiency\nchange of those banks that never merged, i.e. mean CE of all banks like D in\nfigure 1 in year t.31 Hence, a decline in efficiency need not necessarily imply a bad\nmerger. If a bank suffered, for example, from a five percent drop in CE but the\ngroup of non-merging banks experienced a drop of ten percent, the merger helped\nto offset the negative trend. For example, we compare the two-year CE change of\nthe same two years.\nThe second dimension is the level of CE of merging and non-merging banks.\nFor example, along this second dimension, we compare a bank that merged in\n1995 two years after the merger relative to the level of mean CE of non-merging\nWe define mergers in the north-eastern quadrant, group I, as a success. These\ntransactions yield, first, higher CE levels compared to non-merging banks in the\nyear examined and, second, enjoyed an increase in CE since the merger above the\nmean CE change of non-merging banks during the same time period. Below, we\nexamine if these successful mergers also exhibit other favourable KPI, e.g. higher\nprofitability and lower CI ratios. Likewise, we examine if successful (as well as\nunsuccessful) mergers exhibit a clear profile in terms of deal-specific characteristics\nin terms of transferring skills, regional proximity of partners, distress and learning\neffects.\nThe south-eastern quadrant, group II, is deemed unsuccessful. Merged banks\nexhibit above non-merging average CE two years after the transaction. But the\nchange in CE is lower compared to the mean change of non-merging banks. Such\nmergers are unsuccessful because, for the example of an increasing industry trend\nin CE, the bank failed to match positive market developments. This could be the\ncase if the acquiring bank was already highly cost efficient prior to the merger\nleading to high levels of CE in the merger year itself.33 A high level of CE could\nhave led to a too relaxed attitude towards rolling out superior cost management\nskills at the target quickly. We expect to obtain an indication if banks with ex-\ntreme pre-merger differentials fall relatively more often into this (or other) merger\ngroups, reflecting either inability or sheer neglect of transferring knowledge.\n31We refer henceforth to those banks that never merged as non-merging banks. Thereby, we\navoid to compare in a given year merging bank's performance to a benchmark that includes some\nbanks which may merge later on. In fact, a banks' CE one year prior to merger may already differ\nmarkedly from CE of banks never merging and can thus constitute a poor benchmark sample.\nBy excluding bank-year observations of institutes that eventually merge we avoid furthermore\na potential upward bias in the benchmark if successful banks merge early. Including these\nsuccessful early movers in the merger wave would then constitute a too high benchmark for\nthose relatively poor performing banks that follow suit at later stages of the merger wave.\n32Note that our formulation of a benchmark is quite conservative as it requires successful\nmergers to outperform non-merging banks simultaneously along two dimensions. Alternative\nand less rigorous benchmarks are conceivable. For example, Vander Vennet (2003) compares on\nthe one hand pre- and post-merger efficiency rankings within the group of merging banks and on\nthe other he compares these measures between merging banks and those of a peer group selected\non the basis of institutional form, country and size. Here, we prefer to explicitly allow the merger\nevent to enter the fixed effect of the frontier and thereby influence the relative benchmark more\ndirectly. Regarding the alternative of a peer group comparison we acknowldege here that our\nsample already is much more homogenous compared to a cross-country study. Given the large\nnumber of mergers we argue that the choice of relevant peer groups would be hard to achieve\nand is likely to result in arbitrary selection criteria.\n33Note, however, that we do not consider here how efficient the bank was in the year of the\nmerger but compare it to the benchmark t years after the merger.\nFigure 2: Performance of 1995 mergers two years after transaction\nMean change CE\nnon-merging banks\nMean level CE\nnon-merging banks\nGroup I\nGroup II\nGroup III\nGroup IV\nMean change CE\nnon-merging banks\nMean level CE\nnon-merging banks\nGroup I\nGroup II\nGroup III\nGroup IV\nThe south-western quadrant, group III, depicts the worst mergers. In the\nabove example, mergers conducted in 1995 resulted two years later in CE levels\nbanks exhibit a change in CE below the average of non-merging banks, namely\n0.04 percent. We expect to see that these banks do also perform poorly in terms\nof traditional KPI as they exhibit in terms of CE neither high levels of cost\nmanagement skill nor above average improvements.\nFinally, the north-western quadrant, group IV, depicts banks with below non-\nmerging banks' mean CE but with above average changes in CE. Consequently,\nthese transactions are not univocally a success. But they may have the largest\npotential as promising changes in CE may indicate above average efficiency after\nsome more time. We are interested below if, for example, especially those mergers\nare a success where one partner suffered from clear deficiencies as reflected by\ndistress. While turning around a distressed bank could imply below average levels\nof CE for a while, focused restructuring efforts could show up in our taxonomy\nas above average improvements of CE.\nBefore turning to an assessment of the German merger wave on the basis of\nour results let us briefly point out a potential caveat. The two dimensions on\nwhich our grouping is based, namely the level and change of CE, respectively, are\nnot entirely independent from each other. A bank that exhibits above average CE\nchanges after up to nine years after the merger is also more likely to end up with a\nlevel of CE above the average CE of non-merging banks. However, we argue that\nmost alternative approaches that rely either on levels of CE or, for that matter,\nother KPI do suffer from even more severe problems as these approaches neglect\nthe development of the chosen performance ratio entirely.\nWe present first the efficiency effects of merging banks according to the taxonomy\ndescribed in section 4.2.34 Compared to the group of non-merging banks we define\nas a success those transactions that yield both (i) higher levels of cost efficiency\nafter the merger and (ii) exhibit above average changes in efficiency. Based on\nthis categorisation we subsequently investigate the issues raised.\n5.1 Identification of Successful Mergers\nIn table 6 we depict for each cohort of merger years the difference between mean\nCE of merging versus non-merging banks. We do so for both the level of and the\nchange in CE.\nTable 6: Cost efficiency differentials between merging and non-merging banks\nYears elapsed\n1) Differentials calculated as merging less non-merging bank efficiency in percentages.\nNote: ,, depict significant differences at the 1, 5 and 10 percent level, respectively.\nSavings and cooperative banks.\nOn average, the post-transaction level of merging banks' CE is higher com-\npared to non-merging banks. In addition, the change in CE compared to the\nrespective year of the merger is also above the mean CE change among non-\nand change differentials are positive and significantly different from zero. Thus,\nmergers have on average been a success in Germany's cooperative and savings\nbank sectors.\n34We conserve on space and do not provide parameter estimates and general descriptive\nstatistics on efficiency. They are available upon request from the author.\nHowever, this success is on average modest regarding the level of improve-\nments, namely around a mere percentage point. The change of CE is more\nfavourable after considerable time has elapsed, say between seven and eight years\nafter the merger. Then, efficiency changes compared to the year of merger are\nslightly larger compared to quick wins just one or two years after the merger.\nBut even a two percent increase can hardly be called a splendid performance.\nInterestingly, for those mergers that were executed around the time of booming\nthe average of non-merging banks up to three years after the transaction. This\ncould indicate that managers did not focus on keeping production cost efficient.\nIn times when the temptations to realise quick gains in new business arenas may\nhave been paramount from a banker's point of view, careful cost management was\napparently of secondary interest.\nTable 6 depicts mean efficiency differentials. To further assess how many merg-\ners were a success we turn our attention to the distribution of mergers according\nto the quadrant taxonomy described in section 4.2.\nTable 7: Number of banks per quadrant x years after merger\nGroup Total\nelapsed Success Change loser Total loser Level loser\nNote: Multiple acquirers included only once; each bank treated separately\nafter merger. Savings and cooperative banks.\nThe number of banks in group I is throughout the years after merging at\naround 50 percent. Thus, we conclude that in terms of CE every second sav-\nings and cooperative bank merger resulted in a successful merger. To avoid that\nmultiple acquirers, i.e. those that absorbed more than one bank in a given year,\nare assigned too much weight in the categorisation of mergers, we included these\nbanks' post-merger performance only once in each year they conduct multiple\nAnother indication provided by table 7 refers to the declining share of group\nII mergers and the increasing share of group III mergers over time. A possible\nexplanation is that banks suffering from below non-merging banks' CE changes\nultimately also fall below the mean level of non-merging banks' CE ratios. Then,\nthese banks transit into the total loser group if they continuously experience below\naverage CE changes. However, the observation of switching shares of group II and\nIII, respectively, can only be regarded as an indication for the aforementioned\n35We did the same for the calculation of efficiency differentials in table 6.\ninterpretation. This is because in table 7 it is also possible that the share of a\ngroup stays fairly constant, such as for group IV, but the composition of individual\ninstitutes continuously changes from year to year. To draw stronger inference we\nwould have to construct transition matrices and seek to estimate the probability\nof transition given a whole range of bank-specific and environmental variables.36\nWhile we argue that efficiency is particularly suited to evaluate the success of\nmergers in the course of time, we acknowledge the inherent interest of practitioners\nand regulators in alternative KPI to assess the (lack of) virtues of bank mergers.\nWe therefore turn to the development of KPI introduced in table 3 for each of\nour merger groups.\n5.2 Characteristics of Mergers across Groups\nIn table 8 we show the KPI ratios introduced in section 2.3 in addition to mean\nCE over time and banking groups. Overall, KPI after a merger bear markedly\ndifferent information between savings and cooperative banks. In addition, most\ndifferences between traditional KPI across groups are not significant in the long\nrun. Thus, they are by and large uninformative when categorising mergers on the\nbasis of CE six years after the merger. This indicates that after approximately\nsix years other factors than a merger determine these indicators. We therefore\nconcentrate in table 8 on the medium and short run.\nConsider savings banks first. We find that profitability is highest for merg-\ners exhibiting above benchmark CE changes but below benchmark CE levels, i.e.\ngroup IV mergers. At the same time both net interest margins and concentration\nare highest for this group, too. Consequently, high profitability may be due to\nmarket power. We consider such a merger not a success and conclude that market\npower concerns are appropriate for savings banks that exhibit above benchmark\nCE changes. Our taxonomy of success on the basis of CE seems to avoid identifi-\ncation of such mergers as desirable. With respect to potential motives of merging\nwe find little support that either scope or scale economies are realised in savings\nbank mergers. The share of fee to interest income and unit costs are not the\nmost favourable ones for our success group I. However, our productivity proxy\nindicate that successful mergers are those with high labour productivity. Conse-\nquently, savings bank mergers in Germany might indeed be a vehicle to reduce the\nwork force under comparably rigid labour laws. This result is akin to findings of\nLang and Welzel (1999) who report that only those mergers yield above average\nefficiency growth which are accompanied by closure of branches.\nConsider cooperative banks next. Profitability is high for group I but also for\ngroup IV mergers. While the CI ratio is univocally the lowest for our identifica-\ntion of successful mergers, this result implies that CE and profitability measures\ncontain different information. In contrast to savings banks, we find that neither\nmargins nor concentration is particularly high for group IV mergers. In fact,\nboth measures are hardly ever significantly different across merger groups. We\nconclude that market power concerns are of minor importance for cooperative\n36In fact, it is an interesting question in its own right which banks transit over time from one\ngroup to another for what reason. An example of an explicit account of the transition dynamics\nassociated with bank consolidation can be found in Robertson (2001). Such an approach is\nbeyond the scope of this paper and subject to future research.\nTable 8: Mean performance and structure indicators across mergers\nYears KPI Savings Cooperatives\nOne Group I II III IV KW 5) I II III IV KW 5)\nThree\nSix\n1) Productivity measured as FTE per mn Euro of total assets; 2) Unit cost measured as Euro-cent\nof total cost to Euro of total assets; 3) Income structure measured as fee to total income;\n4) HHI in points between 1 and 10,000; 5) p-value for Kruskall-Wallis test of equal populations.\nNote: All mean KPI in percentages unless noted otherwise. Savings and cooperative banks.\nbank mergers. With regard to potential merger reasons we find as for savings\nbanks that productivity is most favourable for successful mergers. Thus, cooper-\natives may have used mergers as well to improve the productivity of their labour\nforce. In addition, unit costs are the lowest for successful mergers. This mirrors\nthe frequently raised objective of cooperative banks to increase the size of their\noperations to realise economies of scale. Note also that both ratios are the only\nsignificant ones in the long run. In contrast, income diversification is an unlikely\ncandidate for a merger motive as differences across groups are insignificant in all\nperiods.\nWe investigate next if the three characteristics raised at the beginning of sec-\ntion 3 did facilitate or obstruct mergers to become a success.\n5.3 Transfer of Skill\nThe first deal-specific characteristic in section 3.1 inquires if especially those merg-\ners are successful that involve partners with large CE differentials before a merger.\nWe create nine equally sized groups of CE differentials in table 9. We depict the\nmean difference in CE levels between the acquirer and the target one year prior to\nthe merger, CEA\n, one, three and six years after the merger occurred.37\n37For multiple acquirers we calculated the differential between the acquirer's CE level relative\nto the average CE level of all targets weigthed by the respective target's total assets.\nWe then compare the relative frequencies of each merger group I through IV for\neach of these nine CE differential groups to the population representation.\nTable 9: Cost efficiency differentials between acquirers and targets\nYears Pre-merger CE differential groups Total\nThree CEA\nNote: CEA\ndepicts mean CE of acquirer less CE of target one year prior to merger; multiple acquirers\nincluded only once; each bank treated separately after merger. Savings and cooperative banks.\nWe draw three major conclusions. First, on average mergers involved pairs\nwhere the acquirer is slightly more efficient prior to the merger, namely by about\none percentage point of CE. Given the tiny difference we concede that only little\nroom prevailed as to \"import\" superior managerial skills from either party into\nthe merged institute. Put differently, the desire to transfer skill or to replace less\nable incumbent managers appears to be of lesser importance for most mergers of\ncooperative and savings banks.\nSecond, large differentials of either kind, i.e. groups 1 and 9 in table 9, are in\nthe short run more frequently successful compared to those mergers that involve\nbanks with small CE differentials. Interestingly, those mergers where the target is\nthe dominant partner are identified considerably more often a success compared to\nthose where the acquirer dominates the target by a similarly large CE differential.\nThis result suggests that it is not per se important as to which of the partners\ninvolved is dominant. We conclude that in the short run large differentials in\ngeneral spur realisation of \"quick wins\" as both minimum and maximum CE\ndifferential groups 1 and 9 contain more often successful mergers.\nThird, we find that the medium- and long-term effects differ markedly from\nthose of the short-run. On the one hand, mergers which involve acquirers with\nCE levels on average ten percentage points higher than those of the target are less\nfrequently identified as a success. On the other hand, those transactions where\nthe target is around seven percentage points more cost efficient than the acquirer\nare also in the medium-run more often a success. However, for this group the\nbenefits from transferring cost management skills wear off at the latest six years\nafter the merger according to our results. Moreover, in the medium- and long-term\nthose groups containing mergers with differentials close to zero, i.e. groups 4 to\n6, contain successful mergers more frequently than any of the extreme differential\nmerger groups.\nIn sum, we conclude that large pre-merger CE differentials yield more fre-\nquently successful mergers in the immediate aftermath of the transaction. But\nthese short-term improvements in CE, which can be due to a transfer of skill,\nwear off already in the medium run. Three or more years after a transaction,\nmergers involving banks with pre-merger CE differentials around zero yield more\noften successful transactions.\n5.4 Distressed Mergers\nWe next assess if distressed mergers are represented more than proportionately\nin one of our merger categories. To this end we examine the short-, medium- and\nlong-term categorisation of (distressed) mergers in table 10. We compare group\nrepresentations of mergers without regulatory attention versus those where either\nthe target, the acquirer or both institutes are distressed.\nTable 10: Distribution of distressed mergers across groups\nYears Group Distressed ... Total\nOne None Target Acquirer Both N\nThree\nSix\nNote: Each bank treated separately after merger; including multiple\nacquirers once. Savings and cooperative banks.\nApproximately seven percent of all transactions are distressed. We discuss\nthree major conclusions with respect to the success of distressed mergers. First,\nthe distribution of distressed mergers roughly mimics the one for non-distressed\ntransactions. In line with Koetter et al. (2005), this indicates that a number of\nnon-distressed mergers may be rather similar to those that received regulatory\nattention. With respect to the group of mergers where both acquirer and target\nreceived regulatory attention we note that robust inference seems inappropriate\ndue to the very low sample size. We therefore disregard this group here.\nSecond, mergers where the target is distressed are more often a success than\ntransactions where the acquirer is distressed. This result is robust over time.\nOverall, the results clearly indicate that rendering a distressed bank the acquirer\nin a problem merger is not beneficial from a CE perspective.\nThird, we note that according to table 4, the majority of distressed mergers\noccurred after 1997. Thus, our comparison of distressed and non-distressed merg-\ners six years after the transaction suffers from a lack of observations because the\nlast year of available data is 2003. We thus caution to draw inferences based on\nthese results alone. However, one interesting outcome is that out of the eleven\nmergers that are still in existence six years after the transaction, the majority of\nseven are transactions where the acquirer was initially distressed. Moreover, these\nmergers are identified relatively often in group III. We tentatively interpret this as\na further indication that mergers with distressed acquirers are not recommended.\nIn sum we conclude that mergers can be a successful tool to alleviate distress\nin the medium run. However, short-run gains are unlikely to materialise and wear\noff in the long run. It is more favourable to render distressed banks the target\nrather than the acquirer from an efficiency point of view.\n5.5 Regional Proximity\nWe turn next to the question if regional proximity results in relatively more suc-\ncessful mergers. In table 11 we compare the distribution of transactions across\ngroups representing three different degrees of regional proximity. First, we depict\nmergers where partners are from the lowest level of regional demarcation avail-\nable, namely municipalities. Second, we depict mergers where both the acquirer\nand the target are from the same county. In the third pair of columns we show\nthose mergers where partners are from different regions as a reference group. As\npreviously, we analyse the short, medium and long run. We focus in our discussion\non two major conclusions.\nFirst, merging savings banks that are located closest to each other are rela-\ntively infrequently identified as successful mergers in the short and medium run.\nThe frequency of group I mergers ranges between 35 and 38 percent, respectively.\nThis is considerably less often compared to banks located further apart from each\nother. Our results imply that regional proximity hampers merger success for this\nbanking group from a CE point of view. Note, however, that we cannot observe\nwhether these merger partners voluntarily decide to join or if they were forced to\njoin forces with \"available\" banks within their region.\nSecond, this result does not hold for cooperative bank mergers. In the short\nrun the representation of county and municipality mergers in group I is just\nslightly below that for non-regional mergers in table 11. In fact, in the medium\nand long run regionally close partners accomplish merger success more frequently\ncompared to those outside the region. The closer the partners in a cooperative\nmerger are, the higher are the chances to outperform non-merging banks in terms\nof CE level and change even up to six years after the merger. This result is in line\nwith Lang and Welzel (1999), who note that successful cooperative bank mergers\nin Bavaria are those that, first, involve partners with some overlap in their branch\nnetworks and, second, reduce these redundancies by closing branches in order to\nenhance efficiency. In the same vein, Hackethal (2004) show that the number of\ncooperatives is despite ongoing consolidation still the highest in Germany, while\nthe size of their operations continues to be small. Our results here indicate that\ncooperative bank mergers might thus have eliminated some of the excess coverage\nin regions where fewer banks can provide customers more efficiently with banking\nTable 11: Successful mergers and regional proximity\nYears Group Municipality County Other\nOne Savings Coop's Savings Coop's Savings Coop's\nThree\nSix\nNote: Each bank treated separately after merger; including multiple acquirers once.\nservices. While we note that we have no information on branching overlap and\n(lack of) branch closure, the results indicate to us that mergers of regionally close\ncooperative banks are slightly different from savings bank mergers. More than\nfor the latter, proximity may rather reflect the elimination of too dense banking\n(and branching) networks.\nIn sum, we find that regional proximity has different effects on mergers among\nsavings and cooperative banks, respectively. With the exception of county mergers\nin the long run, savings banks are less frequently represented in group I compared\nto cooperative banks. In contrast, regional proximity among cooperative banks\nimplies higher chances of a successful merger.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we suggest a taxonomy as how to evaluate the merger wave of\nGerman savings and cooperative banks. We employ cost efficiency (CE) estimates\nobtained with stochastic frontier analysis to benchmark banks on the basis of their\nability to efficiently convert inputs into outputs.\nWe define successful mergers as those which, first, yield CE levels that are\nabove mean CE of non-merging banks and, second, exhibit larger changes between\nthe evaluation and merger years as compared to the respective cohort of non-\nmerging banks in the same period.\nOur results indicate that approximately every second merger is a success ac-\ncording to our taxonomy. On average, cooperative bank mergers are more often\na success than savings bank mergers. Importantly, the margin of success as in-\ndicated by mean CE level differences between merging and non-merging banks is\nvery small - on the order of one to two percentage points only.\nSuccessful mergers exhibit higher profitability than transactions resulting in\nbelow benchmark changes of CE, i.e. groups II and III. However, we find for\nboth banking groups that mergers in group IV, i.e. those that exhibit the highest\nchange in CE but below benchmark CE levels, also exhibit high profitability. For\nsavings banks, we find that both concentration and net interest margins are high-\nest for group IV, too. We interpret these findings as indication that savings bank\ntransactions might fail to yield CE improvements due to the absence of market\ndiscipline. In contrast, we find for cooperative banks that mean concentration and\nnet interest margins remain similar across groups. Consequently, market power\nconcerns do not seem to be an issue for cooperative bank mergers.\nInvestigation of three particularities of the German bank merger wave lead us\nto the following core conclusions. First, the potential for transferring skills from\nacquirers and targets is low as mean pre-merger CE differentials are minuscule.\nThose few transactions with high CE differentials do not result in sustained CE\ngains. Instead, we find that successful mergers exhibit no mean CE differentials.\nSecond, bank mergers where the acquirer is distressed are less often a success.\nIn contrast, mergers involving distressed targets lead in the short and medium\nrun relatively more often to successful mergers. Therefore, mergers where the less\nefficient institute is the target are preferable.\nThird, regional proximity of merger partners has on balance detrimental CE\neffects for savings banks but positive CE effects for cooperative banks. Mergers\nof cooperative banks from the same municipality are in the medium and long run\nmore often successful. In contrast, savings bank mergers involving partners from\nthe same municipality are rarely a success and more often an outright failure.\nFinally, an additional route for further research is to assess bank merger success\non the basis of relative profit efficiency (PE). Because only few banks manage to\nbe efficient in both dimensions, we hypothesise that a simultaneous classification\nbased on PE and CE yields even fewer successful bank mergers.\nReferences\nAltunbas, Y., L.
