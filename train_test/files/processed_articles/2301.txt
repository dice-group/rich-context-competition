Major depressive disorder is one of the most common,\nchronic, and debilitating mental health disorders, affecting more\nthan 13 million individuals annually in the United States [1]. The\nsocial consequences of depression are far-reaching, and the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) lists depression as one of the most\nburdensome diseases in the world [2]. Virtually all depressed\nindividuals experience some impairment in their ability to\nundertake normal activities and, because of this, depression is\na leading cause of disability [1,3].\nDepression among mothers may be of particular concern,\nboth because of the considerable consequences for mothers\nthemselves, but also because of the spillover effects that\nmaternal depression may have on children. Children of\ndepressed mothers have impaired cognitive, behavioral, and\nhealth outcomes from infancy through adulthood, and are\nespecially at risk when maternal depression persists [4\u00ad10].\nDepressed mothers often exhibit hostile, negative, or withdrawn\nbehaviors when interacting with their children [6,11]. De-\npression may create a stressful living environment, disrupt\nfamily routines, or limit mothers' abilities to parent effectively\n[11]. It is especially important to understand the prevalence and\ncorrelates of depression among mothers of young children, as\nyoung children are dependent on their mothers [12]. Un-\nderstanding depression among unmarried mothers is also\nimportant, as this is an increasing demographic group, these\nmothers may be especially vulnerable, and we know little about\nthe prevalence or correlates of depression for this group\nBut our descriptive knowledge about maternal depression,\nespecially maternal depression among unmarried mothers, has\nseveral limitations. First, much research uses small, nonrepresen-\ntative, and homogeneous samples of mothers, resulting in\nstudies of representative samples of mothers use data that are more\nthan 20 years old [22,23]. Additionally, studies often focus on the\npostpartum period and ignore depression when children are in\nearly and middle childhood [22,24]. Finally, little is known about\nstability and change in maternal depression, despite research\nsuggesting chronic maternal depression is most detrimental to\nseveral contributions to our understanding of stability and change\nin maternal depression, and the findings help inform the\ndevelopment of programs and interventions to diagnose and treat\nmaternal depression.\nMaterials and Methods\nSample\nAnalyses use data from the Fragile Families and Child\nWellbeing Study, a longitudinal survey of nearly 5,000 new and\nmostly unmarried parents in 20 U.S. cities [25]. Mothers\ncompleted a 30- to 40-minute in-person interview at the\nhospital after the birth of the focal child, between February\nsoon as possible after the child's birth. Mothers and fathers\nwere then interviewed by telephone when their children were\napproximately 1, 3, 5, and 9 years old. Baseline response rates\nwere 82% for married mothers and 87% for unmarried\nmothers. Of the 4,898 mothers who participated in the baseline\nand 9-year surveys, respectively [26]. Because unmarried\nmothers were oversampled, the sample over-represents minority\nand economically disadvantaged families.\nThe analytic sample included observations in which the mother\ncompletedatleasttwoconsecutivesurveys(notincludingthebaseline\nsurvey, since depression was not measured at baseline) (N = 4,366).\nHaving participated in two consecutive surveys is especially\nimportant for the random- and fixed-effects models (described\nbelow).Giventhemajorityofmothersparticipatedintwoconsecutive\nsurveys, there were few differences between the full and analytic\nsamples.Comparedtothefullsample,mothersintheanalyticsample\nwere less likely to be foreign-born. About 15% of mothers in the\nanalytic sample were born outside the United States, compared to\n17% of mothers in the full sample (p,0.05). Importantly, depression\nwas not associated with attrition, as mothers depressed at the 1-year\nsurvey were equally likely as their non-depressed counterparts to\nparticipate in each of the following surveys.\nMeasures\nMaternaldepressionwasassessedwhenchildrenwere1,3,5,and9\nyears old (but not at baseline, as mothers had just given birth). The\nmeasure of major depressive episode (MDE) came from mothers'\nresponses to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-\nShort Form (CIDI-SF) Version 1.0 [27]. Mothers were asked if, at\nsome time during the past year, they had feelings of dysphoria or\nanhedonia. Mothers who experienced dysphoria and/or anhedonia\nforatwo-weekperiodmostoftheday,everydaywereaskedadditional\nquestions (about losing interest in things, feeling tired, experiencing\na change in weight of at least 10 pounds, having trouble sleeping,\nhaving trouble concentrating, feeling worthless, or thinking about\ndeath). Those who answered affirmatively to at least one stem\nquestion and at least three additional questions were considered\ndepressed. Although limitations to the CIDI-SF exist, it is commonly\nused in large-scale community surveys to measure depression [28].\nAnalysesconsidertheprevalenceofdepressionwhenchildrenwere1,\n3, 5, and 9 years old. Analyses also consider a categorical measure of\ndepression chronicity: no depression (mother reported depression at\nzero survey waves), intermittent depression (mother reported de-\npression at one or two survey waves), and persistent depression\n(mother reported depression at three or four survey waves).\nThe multivariate analyses included a host of control variables.\nMother's race was represented by a series of dummy variables: non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic\notherrace.Adummyvariableindicatedthemotherwasforeign-born.\nAdditional controls include mother's age (younger than 25 years, 25\nto34years,35yearsandolder), education(lessthanhighschool,high\nschool diploma or GED, post-secondary education), employment in\nthe past week, household income (log), relationship status (married,\ncohabiting, non-residential romantic relationship, no relationship),\nand number of children in the household. Finally, analyses adjusted\nfor depression in the child's father (no depression, intermittent\ndepression, persistent depression), based on fathers' self-reported\nresponses to the CIDI-SF administered at the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 9-year\nsurveys. In the multinomial logistic regression models, all socio-\ndemographiccorrelatesweremeasuredatthebaselinesurvey(except\nfor employment, which was measured at the 1-year survey). In the\nrandom- and fixed-effects logistic regression models, all variables\nexcept for race and immigrant status were included as time-varying\ncharacteristics (measured at the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 9-year surveys).\nAnalysis\nThe analysis proceeded in three stages. The first stage calculated\nthe prevalence of maternal depression at each of the four survey\nwaves and the prevalence of maternal depression chronicity.\nDescriptive statistics show sociodemographic correlates, by the\nprevalence of depression chronicity (no depression, intermittent\ndepression, persistent depression). Mean differences across groups\nwere tested with chi-square tests (for categorical variables) and\nANOVA tests (for continuous variables).\nThe second stage used multinomial logistic regression models to\nestimate intermittent and persistent depression, both compared to\nno depression. Model 1 adjusted for the sociodemographic\ncontrols and Model 2 included a series of interaction terms\nbetween fathers' depression and mothers' relationship status with\nthe father (intermittent depression 6 cohabiting, intermittent\ndepression 6 non-residential romantic relationship, intermittent\ndepression 6 no relationship, persistent depression 6 cohabiting,\npersistent depression 6 non-residential romantic relationship,\npersistent depression 6 no relationship).\nThe third and final stage used random- and fixed-effects models\nto estimate change in depression as a function of change in the\ncovariates. For these models, the data were structured in a parent-\nwave format where each mother was observed up to four points in\ntime (when children are 1, 3, 5, and 9 years old). The random-\neffects model captured between- and within-individual variation\nover time, compared to the more conservative fixed-effects model\nthat captured only within-individual variation. These fixed-effects\nmodel allowed for an examination of how changes in socio-\ndemographic characteristics between waves were linked to changes\nin depression, net of time-invariant characteristics and time-\nvarying observed characteristics.\nFew observations were missing data on covariates, and these\nobservations were preserved using multiple imputation [29]. Both\ndependent and independent variables were used to impute missing\nindependent variables, but missing dependent variables were not\nimputed [30]. Findings were robust to listwise deletion. Because\nobservations were drawn from 20 cities, city fixed-effects and\nclustered standard errors were included in all models. Survey\nweights were not available for the 9-year survey, but analyses\nadjusted for all variables used in creating the weights at prior\nsurvey waves (race/ethnicity, education, relationship status, and\nResults\nPrevalence of Depression\nTable 1 presents unadjusted descriptive statistics of maternal\ndepression and all demographic characteristics for the analytic\nsample. Importantly, depression was a common mental health\nproblem among this sample of mostly unmarried mothers. About\n16% of mothers were depressed when their children were 1 year\nold. About 21% were depressed at the 3-year survey, 17% at the 5-\nyear survey, and 17% at the 9-year survey. There was moderate\nPrevalence and Correlates of Maternal Depression\nstability in depression at any two consecutive waves, with 52% of\nmothers depressed at the 1-year survey also depressed at the 3-year\nsurvey, 43% of mothers depressed at the 3-year survey also\ndepressed at the 5-year survey, and 44% of mothers depressed at\nthe 5-year survey also depressed at the 9-year survey (descriptives\nnot shown). Importantly, 38% of mothers reported depression at\nsome point during their child's first nine years. About 31%\nreported intermittent depression (e.g., depression at one or two\nsurvey waves) and 7% reported persistent depression (e.g.,\ndepression at three or four survey waves).\nIn terms of demographic characteristics, the majority of the\nsample was racial/ethnic minorities. Nearly half of mothers (48%)\nwere non-Hispanic black and more than one-fourth (26%) were\nHispanic. About 15% of mothers were born outside the United\nStates, and more than half (54%) were younger than 25 years old\nwhen they gave birth to the focal child. Most mothers did not have\neducation beyond high school at baseline, with 34% reporting less\nthan a high school degree and 31% reporting a high school\ndiploma or GED. At baseline, more than three- fifths (61%) of\nmothers were in a co-residential relationship with the child's\nfather, and 13% were not in a relationship with the child's father.\nMore than one-quarter (27%) of children's fathers reported\ndepression in at least one survey.\nBivariate Correlates of Maternal Depression Chronicity\nTable 2 presents unadjusted sociodemographic characteristics,\nby maternal depression chronicity (no depression, intermittent\ndepression, persistent depression). To begin with, the descriptive\nstatistics showed statistically significant race/ethnic differences in\nmaternal depression chronicity. Non-Hispanic white and non-\nHispanic black mothers were less likely to report no depression or\nintermittent depression, compared to persistent depression.\nHispanic and other race mothers were less likely to report\npersistent depression, compared to no depression or intermittent\ndepression (p = 0.002). About 8% of mothers who reported\npersistent depression were foreign-born, compared to 13% of\nmothers who reported intermittent depression and 19% of\nmothers who reported no depression (p = 0.000). Mothers who\nreported intermittent or persistent depression, compared to those\nwho reported no depression, had lower educational attainment at\nbaseline (p = 0.001). They were also less likely to be employed at\nthe 1-year survey (p = 0.000) and had lower household incomes\n(p = 0.000). Relationship status at baseline was also correlated with\ndepression. For example, 27% of mothers who reported no\ndepression were married at baseline, compared to 19% with\nintermittent depression and 19% with persistent depression.\nSimilarly, 12% of mothers who reported no depression were no\nlonger in a relationship with the child's father at baseline,\ncompared to 14% with intermittent depression and 18% with\npersistent depression (p = 0.000). Mothers with intermittent and\npersistent depression had more children, on average, than their\ncounterparts with no depression (p = 0.045). There was also an\nassociation between mothers' and fathers' depression. More than\nthree-quarters (77%) of mothers with no depression shared\nchildren with fathers who reported no depression, compared to\n70% of mothers with intermittent depression and 59% of mothers\nMultinomial Logistic Regression Models Estimating\nIntermittent and Persistent Depression\nTable 3 presents results from multinomial logistic regression\nmodels estimating depression chronicity. The first two models\nestimated the probability of mothers reporting intermittent\ndepression. The reference group was mothers reporting no\ndepression. In Model 1, which adjusted for all control variables,\nthere were no race/ethnic differences, suggesting mothers of all\nrace/ethnic groups were equally likely to report intermittent\ndepression compared to no depression. Similarly, both native- and\nforeign-born mothers were equally likely to report intermittent\nTable 1.

Again, the pattern of\nresults is easier to interpret when considering coefficients (not\npresented). In estimating persistent maternal depression, the\ncoefficient for fathers' intermittent depression (1.28) was nearly\nwiped out by the coefficients for the intermittent depression 6\nnon-residential romantic relationship interaction (20.89) and for\nthe intermittent depression 6 no relationship interaction (20.88).\nInteractions between fathers' persistent depression and relation-\nship status did not reach statistical significance, likely due to the\nsmall number of fathers who fell into this category and the large\nconfidence intervals, but the point estimates were in the expected\ndirection.\nImportantly, there was only one statistically significant differ-\nence in the correlates of intermittent and persistent depression\n(coefficients not shown).

Results show that, at any given survey wave,\nbetween 16% and 21% of mothers reported depression. Nearly\ntwo-fifths (38%) reported depression at least once during the eight-\nyear period. About 31% reported intermittent depression (e.g.,\ndepression at one or two survey waves) and 7% reported persistent\ndepression (e.g., depression at three or four survey waves). These\nprevalence estimates are higher than estimates of the general\npopulation and lower than estimates found in samples of\ndisadvantaged mothers [1,16\u00ad18]. They are consistent with other\nresearch on representative samples of mothers, though it is difficult\nto make comparisons because most representative studies use the\nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) to\nA second goal of this paper was to estimate the correlates of\nmaternal depression. Consistent with previous research, employ-\nment and relationship status are among the sociodemographic\ncharacteristics most robustly associated with both stability and\nrelationship status and maternal depression is complicated, though,\nas depression in the child's father was also robustly associated with\nboth stability and change in maternal depression if the parents were\nliving together. This is consistent with other research on assortative\nmating by mental health [38] and suggests that simply being in\na marital relationship may not be enough to ameliorate depression\namong mothers (and, instead, that partner characteristics are\nimportant). Other demographic characteristics \u00ad including educa-\ntion and employment \u00ad were associated with intermittent depression\nbut not persistent depression, which is consistent with research\nsuggesting differential causes of depression onset and depression\nTaken together, these findings make several contributions to the\nexisting literature on maternal depression. First, the estimates\nPrevalence and Correlates of Maternal Depression\npresented use data from a recent, large, longitudinal and\nheterogeneous sample of a group most at risk of maternal\ndepression. This is in contrast to much existing research that relies\non outdated or non-representative samples. Second, the estimates\nconsider depression among mothers over an eight-year time period\nthat spans both early and middle childhood. Third, by examining\nboth stability and change in maternal depression over this eight-\nyear period, as well as using rigorous fixed-effects models that\nexamine within-person changes in maternal depression, these\nfindings add to a literature on the correlates of maternal\ndepression that is often limited to considering depression at one\npoint in time.\nThough these analyses provide a comprehensive portrait of the\nprevalence and correlates of maternal depression, several limita-\ntions exist. First, because unmarried mothers were oversampled,\nthe sample is over-representative of minority and economically\ndisadvantaged mothers. Though these results cannot be general-\nized to all mothers, they provide a comprehensive understanding\nof an increasing, vulnerable demographic group [7,13]. Un-\nmarried mothers and their children have been the focus of\nincreasing research and policy initiatives and, indeed, some suggest\nthat such family arrangements lead to increasing inequality and\nAdditional limitations exist. The dichotomous measure of\ndepression makes it impossible to consider mothers who exhibited\nsome symptoms of depression but did not fit the diagnostic\ncriterion for depression [41]. Similarly, for mothers classified as\ndepressed, the dichotomous measure did not allow for an\nexamination of heterogeneity in depression severity, despite the\nfact that children may suffer most when mothers are severely\ndepressed [42]. Additionally, despite the fact the data span an\neight-year time period, yearly measures of depression were only\nassessed four times. For example, a mother who experienced\na short-lived bout of depression between the 1- and 3-year surveys\nwould only fit the diagnostic criterion for yearly depression if that\ndepression occurred in the year prior to the 3-year survey. Given\nthis, it is likely the true prevalence of maternal depression is\nunderreported. Finally, the analyses cannot demonstrate a causal\nrelationship between the sociodemographic characteristics and\nmaternal depression. Certainly, socioeconomic status, relationship\nTable 4.

To begin with, they suggest\na large number of mothers suffer from depression when their\nchildren are in early and middle childhood. But depressed\nmothers \u00ad at least the mostly unmarried mothers in this sample\n\u00ad are not necessarily receiving treatment for their condition. In\nfact, supplemental analyses (not presented) show that 80% of\nmothers depressed at the 3-year survey do not receive counseling\nor therapy for depression and 86% are not taking anti-depressants.\nScreening procedures by primary care physicians and pediatri-\ncians may help identify and treat depressed mothers. Similarly, this\ngroup of mostly unmarried mothers may face particular barriers\nthat prevent them from seeking and receiving treatment (e.g.,\nimpediments to finding child care, difficulty affording co-payments\nor prescriptions) [43]. Researchers and practitioners should work\nto identify and eliminate these barriers.\nAdditionally, these findings attest to the salience of socioeco-\nnomic status as a correlate of maternal depression. Understanding\nthis and other risk factors associated with depression may help\nphysicians identify mothers who may especially benefit from\ntreatment. Given that socioeconomic status is amenable to policy\ninterventions such as anti-poverty programs that promote\neconomic self-sufficiency, effective prevention and treatment\nstrategies may include targeting such correlates of depression\n[44]. Improving economic self-sufficiency may also increase the\nprobability of marriage [45], an additional correlate of maternal\ndepression. However, given that fathers' depression plays an\nimportant role in maternal depression, these results suggest that\npolicymakers concerned with marriage promotion among eco-\nnomically disadvantaged couples must consider parents' mental\nhealth [24].
