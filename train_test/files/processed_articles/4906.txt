Shore described the influence\nof the neurophysical background on integral\nchildren's development and the impact of\nunderdeveloped and differentiated levels of\nmanagement of movement on this develop-\nmental path. He highlighted particularly the\nrole and impact of early experiences,\napproaches, and processes.1 The transition\nfrom a lower to a higher stage of develop-\nment depends on a number of factors, the\nmost significant being physical growth,\nenvironmental influences, and self-activity.\nAmong environmental influences, the pres-\nence of stimuli provided by physical/sports\nactivities is ranked specifically. According to\nthe theory of integral development, there is a\nclose relation between a child's physical,\nmotor, intellectual, emotional, and social\ndevelopment.2 Children's muscle compos-\nition has attracted increased interest as it\ncould help us to understand better their\nmotor and physical development. The inva-\nsiveness of the approaches used in this field,\nhowever, is the main barrier to obtaining\ndata on muscle composition. The most\ncommonly investigated muscles are the\nvastus lateralis (VL)1 and biceps femoris\n(BF).3 To date, most studies have been\ncross-sectional. Longitudinal studies are\nrare, and their sample sizes are mostly small.\nAn important milestone in the research of\nskeletal muscle was achieved by Dahmane,4\nwho, via histochemical and biomechanical\nanalyses, demonstrated that each muscle of\nthe human body is unique and that the\nskeletal muscles of the lower and upper\nlimbs have varying numbers and volume\npercentages of slow (type 1) and fast (type 2)\ntwitch fibers. She also showed that it is\npossible to demonstrate a difference in the\nnumber and volume percentages of slow and\nfast twitch fibers via tensiomyography\n(TMG), whereby several contractile param-\neters may be defined.4 The TMG method,\nproposed by Valenc\n ic\nof muscles, has the advantages of being\nnoninvasive and selective. Hence, TMG is a\nsuitable method for determining the propor-\ntion of slow and fast twitch muscle fibers in\nskeletal muscles.6\nAccording to Valenc\n ic\n and Knez,7 TMG\ncan be used to assess skeletal muscle con-\ntractile properties, which are related to\nmuscle composition.4,6 Contraction time is\ncorrelated with the proportion of slow\ntwitch skeletal muscle,8\u00ad10 and it has been\nshown that not only the contraction time,\nbut also the delay time and relaxation half-\ntime, should be known for a more valid\nidentification of muscle composition.\nSprinting speed--one of the distinguish-\ning indicators of successful motoric\nperformance in children--develops through-\nout childhood and adolescence as children\ngrow and mature.11 Running speed during\nchildhood and adolescence develops in a\nnon-linear manner owing to the large mat-\nurational influences associated with\nincreased limb length and muscle mass and\nthe changing intrinsic muscle\u00adtendon prop-\nerties. Therefore, failure to master sprinting\nmay be an enormous barrier, preventing\nchildren from gaining more complex phys-\nical activity skills.11\nSurprisingly, little is known about the\nassociation between muscle contraction\ntimes and sprinting speeds. The search in\nWeb of Science (Thomas Reuters, USA)\nand PubMed (National Center for\nBiotechnology Information, U.S. National\nLibrary of Medicine, USA) bibliographic\ndatabase using the string ``contraction time''\nand muscle and speed and (sprint* or run*) at\nthe time of designing the study revealed no\narticles. Therefore, one of the aims when\nanalyzing the data collected during the\n5-year longitudinal study presented here\nwas to research the associations between\nvarious running speeds and muscle contrac-\ntion time category values in 8- to 13-year-old\nchildren using multiple correspondence ana-\nlysis (MCA). The following research ques-\ntions were posed:\n1. What kinds of associations, if any, exist\nbetween running speed and VL and BF\nmuscle contraction times?\n2. What is the difference in running speed\nand VL and BF muscle contraction time\nassociations between boys and girls?\n3. What is the difference in running speed\nand muscle contraction time association\nbetween the VL and BF muscles?\nParticipants, materials, and methods\nParticipants were recruited from three\nCentral Slovenia region, Drava region, and\nCoastal-Karst region. Three primary\nschools in each region, were selected ran-\ndomly. Participants came from five\nSlovenian towns (Figure 1): two major\ncities in central and northeast Slovenia and\nthree small towns in the coastal region.\nThus, we ensured that the sample covered\nmuch of Slovenia.\nThe researchers then organized work-\nshops for the schools' head teachers, phys-\nical education teachers, children, and\nparents with the aim of presenting the\npurpose of the study and inviting potential\nparticipants. In total, 300 children aged 8\nyears at the beginning of this study and 13 at\nthe end of this study were recruited, 100\nfrom each region. Among them, 265 chil-\ndren participated in the baseline study: 138\nmale (M) and 127 female (F). The selection\nprocess was performed in a random manner\nFigure 1. Backgrounds of the participants.\nZavrs\nto prevent any possible bias (e.g., gender,\ngeographic distribution, anthropometric\ncharacteristics). The most important inclu-\nsion criterion was good health, although the\nresearchers confirmed that none of the chil-\ndren had a history of neuromuscular dis-\norders or muscle disease. Before carrying\nout the research study (baseline or follow-\nup), the children and their parents were\ninformed that participation in the study was\non a voluntary basis and that the partici-\npants could drop out from the study at any\ntime and for any reason. Additionally, the\nresearchers pointed out that the results of\nthe longitudinal study would be used only\nfor research purposes. On this basis, the\nparents of the participants gave their written\nconsent for the children to participate. All\nDeclaration of Helsinki and were approved\nby the National Medical Ethics Committee\nof the Republic of Slovenia.\nFor the first follow-up study, 263 children\nchildren (98 M, 77 F); and in the fifth (last),\nchildren (53 M, 54 F) (initial average age\n9.1 \u00c6 0.5 years) completed all six longitu-\ndinal measurements and were selected for\nthe analysis. The study participants were in\nthe third grade at primary school at the\nbaseline and in the eighth grade at the last\nfollow-up.\nResearch design and measures\nThe 5-year longitudinal research study was\nperformed once per school year, from 2001\nsectional (single point), quantitative meas-\nurements of anthropometric characteristics,\ncontractile properties of skeletal muscles,\nand running speed.\nDuring the study, six repeat measure-\nments were performed from the third to\neighth grades of the children's primary\nschool education. The same procedure was\nused at each measurement. Because all\nmajor physical or sport activities were\ndiscouraged before each measurement\n(approximately 2 days), the research team\ninformed each school of the exact date on\nwhich each stage of the study was to be\nimplemented at least 1 week before it\noccurred.\nMeasurements of skeletal muscle\ncontractile properties\nTMG measuring method. TMG is a method for\nmeasuring skeletal muscles' contractile\nproperties.10 It determines the muscle's\nmechanical responses based on radial\nmuscle belly displacement induced by a\nsingle electrical stimulus.12 TMG is imple-\nmented mostly by a TMG S1 system (TMG\nScience for Body Evaluation). The method\nwas first introduced as a measuring tech-\nnique and was then proposed as a method\nfor defining parameters. Later, the link\nbetween the amplitude of the mechanical\nTMG response and the relative muscle force\nwas introduced--which is a linear relation.7\nThe TMG method was then evaluated for\nthese uses, and its validity was proven in\nseveral studies, including long-term\nTwo muscles, VL and BF (leg-dominant\nsites), were chosen for the measurements,\nwhich are shown in Table 1. We used a single\n1-msec pulse, applied through the cathode\nand anode, to elicit a twitch contraction.\nThe stimulation current at the start was just\nabove the contraction threshold and was\nincreased gradually until the response amp-\nlitude ceased to increase. Two maximum\ntwitch responses were recorded and saved.\nThe maximum displacement amplitude\nand contraction times were calculated from\neach twitch response.5,7 Maximum displace-\nment amplitude (in millimeters) was\ndefined as the peak amplitude on the\ndisplacement\u00c0time curve of the TMG\ntwitch response. The contraction time (in\nmilliseconds) was the time from 10% to 90%\nof the maximum displacement amplitude.17\nThe average value of these parameters\nextracted from two twitch responses was\nused for further analysis. Various experts\nfrom the fields of electrical engineering and\ncomputer science, physical education tea-\nchers, and undergraduate sport sciences\nstudents performed the measurements. A\nmedical doctor supervised all measurements.\nMeasurement of running speed\nBefore measuring maximum running speed,\nall participants were ``warmed up'' appro-\npriately for approximately 20 minutes.\nThe warm-up process was composed of\nthe following.\n\u00ad Running (5 minutes)\n\u00ad Stretching (5 minutes)\n\u00ad Warm-up running practice (10 minutes)\nEach participant's warm-up followed the\nsame procedure and was led by the same\nperson. Each participant completed two\nexperimental sprints. We measured max-\nimum running speed at a distance of 7 m\nfrom a flying start that was 10 m long. The\nparticipants performed preliminary runs\nduring the measurement process, followed\nby the first photocell checkpoint, and after\n7 m the second photocell checkpoint. We\ndivided the running distance into 7-m seg-\nments and identified a position from which\nwe could calculate the sprint speed. Each\nparticipant repeated the sprint twice, and the\nbetter result was used for further analysis.\nMaximum running speed was measured\nusing a wireless Brower measurement\nsystem (Brower Timing Systems, Draper,\nData analysis\nSix sets of measurements were obtained for\neach participant. A set consisted of the\nTable 1. Measurements of vastus lateralis and biceps femoris muscles.\nPosition of measurement\nVastus lateralis: Measurements on the VL were performed in the supine position at 30 knee flexion,\nwhere 0 represents the extended joint.\nBiceps femoris: Measurements on the BF were performed in the prone position at 5 knee flexion.\nProcedure\n1.

Select the measurement point where the belly muscle is largest while ensuring that the selected place is\nbetween the two electrodes. Start the experimental measurements (with palpation and re-installation of\nthe electrodes and sensors if needed). Because each muscle has its own specific anatomical structure,\nsome adjustments may be needed regarding the locations of the measuring equipment.\na.

For the\nanalysis performed in the present study, we\nwere not interested in absolute changes in\nmuscle contraction times or running speed\nduring childhood development. We were\ninterested in the changes in the contraction\ntimes and speed categories and the associ-\nation between these two entities. We used\nthe MCA18 to analyze the changes and\nassociations. MCA is a multivariate statis-\ntical technique used to analyze multi-way\ncontingency tables that unveils some corres-\npondence between columns (variables) and\nrows (category values). Its aims are similar\nto those of principal component analysis,\nbut it uses categorical, rather than continu-\nous, data. MCA enables the user to associate\nvariables and their category values graphic-\nally. The MCA results are presented as ``bi-\nplots.'' The proximity of category values in a\nbi-plot presents the degree of association\nbetween them (the closer the values, the\ngreater is the association). Each bi-plot can\nbe characterized by naming the dimensions,\nwhich adds a qualitative viewpoint to the\nanalysis--one of the advantages of MCA.\nThe other notable advantage is the visual-\nization of many associations on a single\nbi-plot, including associations between vari-\nables, associations between category values\nof a single variable, and combinations of the\ntwo. Thus, MCA might reveal more infor-\nmation than, for example, correlation ana-\nlysis or analysis of variance. A possible\nweakness might be that the associations are\npresented graphically and their magnitude\ncannot be quantified exactly. We used IBM\nSPSS Statistics 23 software (SPSS, Chicago,\nIL, USA) to perform the MCA.\nEach measured variable was discretized\nprior to analysis. For the sake of the read-\nability of bi-plots, only four category values\nwere calculated for each transformed vari-\nable. For running speed, we used very slow,\nslow, fast, and very fast. For contraction\ntimes, we used below average minus the\nstandard deviation (\u00c0SD), below average\n(\u00c0Avg), above average (\u00feAvg), and above\naverage plus the standard deviation (\u00feSD).\nCategory values were obtained using SPSS\nVisual Binning Automatic Transformation\n(SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).\nResults\nThe MCA of the VL contraction time and\nrunning speed for boys (Figure 2) at six ages\nshowed that all running speed category\nvalues formed their own clusters (i.e., very\nslow, slow, fast, very fast), regardless of how\nfar away they were located from each other\nor from both slow contraction time category\nvalues. This clustering revealed the follow-\ning assumptions.\n\u00ad All running speed category values were\nvery different from each other, the most\ndifferent being the very slow speed cat-\negory value.\n\u00ad Neither of the slow running speed cat-\negory values was associated with VL\ncontraction times.\n\u00ad Boys' running speed category values\nremained closely associated with each\nother throughout the study, meaning\nthat boys who were very slow stayed\nvery slow, boys who were very fast stayed\nvery fast, and so on.\nNo structured associations could be\nestablished between the fast speed running\ncategory value and VL contraction times.\nAdditionally, the joint category plot shows\nthat the very fast speed category in 13-year-\nold children is associated with below-\naverage VL contraction times at the ages\nA joint category plot for VL contraction\ntime and running speed for girls at six ages\n(Figure 3) showed that all four running\nspeed category values formed their own\nclusters that were located far away from\neach other. Additionally, the very slow and\nfast category values were located far away\nfrom the VL contraction time category\nvalues. This clustering revealed three\nassumptions.\n\u00ad All running speed categories were very\ndifferent.\n\u00ad Running speed category values very slow\nand fast were independent of VL con-\ntraction times.\n\u00ad Girls' running speed category values\nstayed closely associated with each other\nthroughout the study, meaning that girls\nwho were very slow stayed very slow, girls\nwho were very fast stayed very fast, and\nso on.\nIt is interesting to note that contraction\ntimes labeled \u00adSD (contraction times: \u00adAvg\n\u00adSD) were also grouped in an isolated\ncluster, meaning that extremely low contrac-\ntion times did not have any effect on running\nspeed and that extremely low VL contrac-\ntion times were categorically constant\nthroughout the study period. Low running\nspeed for girls was associated with under-\naverage VL contraction times and very fast\nrunning speed with extremely high VL con-\ntraction times (\u00feSD).\nThe MCA of BF contraction time and\nrunning speed for boys at six ages showed\nthat all four running speed category values\nformed clusters located far away from each\nFigure 2.

As\nabove, the running speed category values\nstayed constant: slow boys stayed slow and\nfast boys stayed fast (Figure 4).\nIn contrast to the VL muscle, running\nspeed categories were associated with the BF\ncontraction time category values. These asso-\nciations can lead to the following conclusions.\n\u00ad Very slow and slow running speeds were\nassociated with very slow contraction\ntimes, which were more than 1 SD from\nthe average BF contraction time.\n\u00ad Very fast running speeds were associated\nwith very fast contraction times, which\nwere less than 1 SD from the average BF\ncontraction time.\n\u00ad Fast running speed was associated with\nbelow-average contraction times\nThe MCA of BF contraction time and\nrunning speed for girls at six ages showed\nthat the extreme running speed category\nvalues--very slow and very fast--formed\ntheir own clusters located far away from\neach other and far away from the BF\ncontraction time category values (Figure 5).\nThis clustering revealed three assumptions.\n\u00ad The extreme running speed category\nvalues--very slow and very fast--were\nvery different from each other.\n\u00ad Neither extreme running speed category\nvalue was associated with the BF con-\ntraction time.\nFigure 3.

In\ncontrast, slow and fast running speed cat-\negory values were associated with\ndifferent BF contraction time categories.\nNevertheless, no clear association could be\nestablished between running speeds and BF\ncontraction times.\nThe associations between contraction\ntime category values and running speed\ncategory values in regard to gender and\nmuscle are summarized in Table 2. There are\nsome clear associations at specific category\nvalues, in contrast to other category values,\nwhere there seem to be no association\nbetween speed and contraction times.\nA comparison of the clustering of muscle\ncontraction time category values and that of\nrunning speed category values shows that\nthe same running speed category values are\nalways grouped in one coherent cluster.\nThus, participants' categorical running\nFigure 4.

In contrast,\nmuscle contraction time category values did\nnot form coherent clusters, meaning that\nthere were some categorical changes in\nmuscle contraction times associated with\nthe participants' ages.\nRegarding gender, the running speed of\nboys was less dependent on VL contraction\nFigure 5.

This finding is in\ncontrast to that of the BF muscle, where\ngirls' BF contraction times had either no or\nunstructured associations with running\nspeeds compared with those of boys, in\nwhom there were some clear associations.\nJoint category plots showed that BF con-\ntraction times were associated more closely\nwith running speeds than were those of the\nVL muscle. It is interesting that extremely\nhigh contraction times (above average \u00fe 1\nSD) were not associated with running speeds\nfor the BF muscle, in contrast to the VL\nmuscle, where extremely low contraction\ntimes (below average \u00c0 1SD) were not\nassociated with running speeds.\nThe dimensions\nAfter examining the muscle contraction\nspeed category values and running speed\ncategory values, all four bi-plots' dimensions\nwere named in an equal manner. The x-axis\nrepresented the ``Running speed,'' and the\ny-axis represented the ``Contraction time.''\nThe following general observations about\nassociations between contraction times and\nrunning speed could be derived based on\nthese dimensions.\n. VL muscle: The association is propor-\ntional (higher contraction times result in\nhigher running speeds).\n. BF muscle: The association is inversely\nproportional (higher contraction times\nresult in slower running speeds).\nDiscussion\nThe analysis just described contributes a\nnew insight into children's skeletal muscle\ndevelopment. We can summarize the results\nby taking into consideration the research\nquestions posed earlier. In general, the\nassociation of muscle contraction time and\nrunning speed was established, although\nclear associations exist only for specific\ncategory values of the two variables. There\nare gender differences in the association of\nrunning speed and muscle contraction times.\nIt seems, however, that the associations in\nboys have more structure that those in girls.\nThe structure of associations differs between\nmuscles as well as the type of association\n(proportional for VL and inversely propor-\ntional for BF).\nAssociations between muscle contraction\ntimes and running speed\nThe aim of this longitudinal study was to\ngain insight into the development of chil-\ndren's skeletal muscles, focusing on the\nassociations between running speed and\nmuscle contraction times, and comparing\nage- and gender-related differences. Our\nanalysis revealed the presence of an associ-\nation between muscle contraction times and\nrunning speed. Loturco et al.19 discovered\nsimilar associations in adults. Their study\nconfirmed that the TMG-derived velocity of\nBF contraction--calculated from the ratio\nbetween maximum radial displacement and\nthe sum of contraction time and delay\ntime--is associated with 20 -m and change-\nof-direction sprint performances of elite\nsoccer players. Bell et al.20 showed that the\ndistribution patterns and ultrastructure of\nskeletal muscles in children did not differ\nfrom those in normal adult tissues. Hence,\nthe combined results of these two studies\nsupport the outcomes of our research.\nThe period from ages 7\u00ad10 for girls and\n7\u00ad12 for boys--called ``late childhood''--is\ncharacterized by rapid linear growth of the\nlimbs. The next growth surge occurs during\nadolescence and lasts for about 2 years, from\nboys. At this stage, some of the body's\ndimensions rapidly increase. Our study,\nhowever, showed that the running speed\ncategory values generally did not change\nduring that period. Unfortunately, no other\nZavrs\nsimilar published studies could be found.\nThe lack of comparable studies could be\nbecause skeletal muscle composition is dif-\nficult to measure in healthy children. Some\nstudies have investigated VL composition in\nadults, but there have been few studies on\nGender differences\nOur study showed that there were gender\ndifferences in the association of running\nspeed and muscle contraction times, which\nhad been confirmed previously with correl-\nation analysis and published elsewhere.22\nThe analysis showed some gender differ-\nences in the VL muscle: (1) the contraction\ntime changes with age (faster in boys than in\ngirls); (2) maximum running speed of the\nboys over the whole measurement period\nincreased, whereas for the girls it increased\nonly up to the seventh grade; (3) the con-\ntraction times of VL first declined until the\nfourth grade and later increased (signifi-\ncantly more in boys than in girls). These\naccomplishments could be attributed to the\nfact that the early school period is the most\nimportant for the development of children's\nmotor potentials and for learning movement\npatterns. Usually, children learn new move-\nment techniques quickly and with little\neffort.23,24 As children develop coordin-\nation, they usually change the way they\nrun. From a technical point of view, boys\nrun more correctly, including their use of the\ntwo-headed muscle of the thigh (BF).\nPraprotnik et al.25 studied the correlation\nbetween the BF muscle and the maximum\nspeeds of male sprinters. They found that\noptimal running resulted from using a\nproper technique and taking advantage of\nthe BF. It was also found that boys perform\nbetter than girls in most tests of coordin-\nation.26 The myelination of the nervous\nsystem is crucial for muscle responsiveness.\nAdditionally, significant differences in the\nmuscle contraction speed coincide with\n``blast growth'' during middle and late\nchildhood and adolescence.27 S\n imunic\n\net al.28 showed that overall muscle mass is\nbetween the ages of 8 and 13 years, which\ncould be an additional source of gender-\nrelated differences in running speed.\nAccording to Always et al.,29 women have\na smaller cross section of muscle fibers than\nmen, which could be why they have a shorter\ncontraction time. Contrary to the above\nstudies, some researchers claim that there\nare no significant differences in the percent-\nage of fiber types between genders.30,31\nMuscle differences\nWe confirmed that the structure of associ-\nations, as well as the type of association\n(proportional in VL and inversely propor-\ntional in BF), differs between these muscles.\nThe VL muscle is an anti-gravitational\nmuscle and so receives many mechanical\nstimuli for its adaptation (i.e., hypertrophy).\nThe BF is not an anti-gravitational muscle\nand therefore has few everyday mechanical\nstimuli. The two-headed thigh muscle (BF)\ncan be trained to a greater extent because it\ncontains the largest number of type IIc, or\nsatellite-based, fibers, which, depending on\nthe functional requirements of the body, can\nbe transformed into type I or type II fibers.\nLimitations\nOur study has some limitations. First is the\nselection of the research environment: only\nthree of twelve Slovenian regions were\nselected for the study. Second is the use of\na non-standardized measurement tool.\nBecause other studies on children's physical\nactivities already exist, it might have been\nbetter to use some previously developed\nmeasurement tools. Nonetheless, the meth-\nods used in the present study were quite\nsimilar to those of other studies, so com-\nparison may still be possible.\nConclusion\nBy using MCA of VL contraction time and\nrunning speed for girls and boys, we were\nable to show that running speed categories\nare different in boys and girls. For boys, the\nvery slow speed category was the most\ndifferent. Also in boys, the slow and very\nslow running speed categories were independ-\nent of VL contraction times, in contrast to\nthe situation in girls, for whom very slow and\nfast running speed categories were independ-\nent of VL contraction times. Interestingly,\nboys' running speed categories stayed con-\nstant throughout the study, whereas only two\ncategories remained constant for girls (very\nslow and fast). Our study also revealed that\nboys' running speed was less dependent on\nVL contraction times than that of girls.\nThe MCA of BF contraction time and\nrunning speed for boys and girls revealed\nthat, in boys, contrary to what was observed\nwith the VL muscle, running speed cate-\ngories were associated with BF contraction\ntime categories. In boys, fast and very fast\nrunning speeds were associated with con-\ntraction times below \u00c0SD from the average\nBF contraction time. In contrast, girls' fast\nand very fast running speed categories were\nvery different and independent of BF con-\ntraction times. Our study also showed that\nboys' running speed categories were much\nmore structurally associated with BF con-\ntraction times than those of girls.\nComparing the MCA results for the VL\nand BF contraction times and running\nspeeds for boys and girls shows that the\nBF contraction times were associated much\nmore closely with running speed than were\nthe VL contraction times. It was also found\nout that extremely long contraction times\nof the BF are not associated with\nrunning speed, in contrast to the VL whose\nextremely short contraction times are not\nassociated with running speed.\nThe present results provide insight into a\nwhole new dimension of a child's develop-\nment. We are confident that our assessment\nof the contractile parameters in two skeletal\nmuscles, VL and BF, will contribute to the\ngeneral understanding of children's skeletal\nmuscle development. It is important to note\nalso the longitudinal nature of this study as\nsuch studies are rare in our field of interest.\n"
