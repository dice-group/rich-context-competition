Results show parent involvement activities, which may\nprovide the most beneficial outcome for parents and their children, are activities that include parents in the planning, decision\nmaking, and recruitment of other parents, and that parents need to be considered an important part of GEAR UP services\nfrom the beginning of program development. The importance placed on parent involvement was found to have a strong\npositive effect on the capacity for sustainability of partnership type programs, which draws attention to the way partnership\nprograms are created, and programs that best meet the needs of the community are created by those in the community in\nwhich services are provided.\n",

Of particular focus is the attention to student popula-\ntions traditionally underserved by higher education (e.g.,\nstudents who are first in their family to attend college, aca-\ndemically underprepared, ethnic minority, or from low socio-\neconomic backgrounds). Efforts to increase the college going\nrate of these students include financial aid (e.g., grants, loans,\nand work study), college awareness and preparation pro-\ngrams, and attention to factors such as expectations and aspi-\nrations; academic ability and preparation; accurate\ninformation about college options; and support from teach-\ners, counselors, family members, and peers. Early interven-\ntion or outreach efforts focus on eliminating higher education\nbarriers to ensure that academically qualified individuals are\nnot denied access. CIP is a term that was first used by Cabrera\net al. (2006) to describe a comprehensive approach in pro-\nviding resources for underserved students to help them pre-\npare for higher education. Cabrera studied the specific CIP,\nGaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate\nPrograms (GEAR UP), although the term CIP may be applied\nto programs such as Achievement Via Individual\nDetermination (AVID); I Have a Dream (IHAD);\nMathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA);\nand the initial three TRiO programs, now nine, suite of pro-\ngrams through the Federal Government. CIP initiatives are\nestablished by not-for-profit and governmental organizations\nto increase the likelihood that underserved students will suc-\ncessfully make the transition from high school to college.\nSeveral researchers have investigated specific compo-\nied additional components for possible inclusion (Fenske,\nTierney, Corwin, & Colyar, 2005; Tierney & Hagedorn,\nempirically identified 19 CIP components that help under-\nserved students prepare for college, one of which was parent\ninvolvement. CIP components such as parent involvement\n\"provide access to forms of cultural and social capital that\nare usually unavailable to low-income students\" (Cabrera\n1Utah Valley University, Orem, USA\n2University of Missouri\u00adKansas City, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDouglas S.

Gardner1 and Jacob M. Marszalek2\n Keywords\nGEAR UP, parent involvement, sustainability, college preparation, access to higher education\n2 SAGE Open\net al., 2006, p. 94). The provision of access to cultural and\nsocial capital for students and their families is vital for under-\nserved students to access higher education. Parents play a\nprominent role in helping their children gain access to and\nsucceed in higher education, so that they may accomplish\ntheir educational goals.\nParent involvement is possibly the most beneficial\nresource for children in the classroom (Perna & Titus, 2005).\nHowever, parent involvement as a CIP component lacks\nempirical support. Personnel who manage parent involve-\nment components frequently become frustrated because of\nthe lack of participation by parents, but within the GEAR UP\nintervention program, the issue is compounded: Parent\ninvolvement and all other components are expected to con-\ntinue beyond the time period of the grant, and the sustain-\nability of parent involvement is unknown (Department of\nEducation [ED], 2003). The theoretical framework for the\nsustainability component of our study came from the public\nhealth and health promotion literatures regarding empirical\nand theoretical evidence for the sustainability capacity of\ninnovations (e.g., Goodman & Steckler, 1989; Johnson,\nScheirer, Hartling, & Hagerman, 2008; Shediac-Rizkallah &\nParent Involvement: The Problem and\nPotential\nParent involvement activities constitute college readiness\nactivities involving parents, and may include the participa-\ntion of parents in their children's education at any level, as\nwell as a variety of partnerships between the school, family,\nPerna, 2006). In the context of our study, parent involvement\nis the inclusion of parents and family members in their chil-\ndren's education, ultimately leading to college attendance\n(Perna & Titus, 2005). Recent studies have shown parent\ninvolvement is positively related to aspirations for attending\ncollege, as well as actual enrollment and academic perfor-\nmance leading to college success (Rowan-Kenyon, Bell, &\nPerna, 2008). Research also demonstrates parents from low-\nincome backgrounds face economic, social, and psychologi-\ncal barriers (Hoover-Dempsey & Sandler, 1997;\nWithin CIP programs focused specifically on preparing\nstudents from low socioeconomic backgrounds for college--\ndespite recognition of parent involvement as important--\nprogram personnel have doubts about involving parents,\nciting parent involvement as the most difficult component to\nAuerbach, 2005). In their review of the literature, Tierney\nand Auerbach (2005) concluded parent involvement is unde-\nrutilized because CIPs are underfunded, noting when priori-\ntization of services takes place, components such as parent\ninvolvement \"almost never rise to the top\" (p. 45). Perna\n(2002) found parent involvement was the most challenging\ncomponent for CIPs to develop and implement. Both Gandara\nand Bial's (2001) evaluation of several CIPs, and the ED\n(2003) evaluation of GEAR UP, showed personnel frequently\nbecame frustrated with the lack of parent participation, which\nlimited the implementation of parent involvement. Programs\ninvolving parents were especially limited for students from\nunderserved populations (Gandara & Bial, 2001), the very\nfocus of those same programs.\nRowan-Kenyon et al. (2008) observed past research has\nfocused on the quantity of parent involvement rather than the\nquality, and concluded program personnel had a clear idea\nabout how to involve parents in preparing their children for\ncollege (e.g., attendance at school or program sponsored\nevents), but parents did not meet these expectations because\nof \"work commitments, lack of comfort with school staff,\nlanguage barriers, and conditional mistrust\" (p. 583). Rowan-\nKenyon et al. (2008) recommended school and program per-\nsonnel give up on their preconceptions about parents, and\ninstead find innovative ways to involve parents. Perna (2002)\nreported the most problematic concern for CIPs was coordi-\nnating with parents. In Perna's study, about 25% of all pro-\ngrams required a parent involvement component, and\napproximately 75% had some form of one. The GEAR UP\nevaluation conducted by the ED (2003) found that \"with\nsome notable exceptions, the projects [were] experiencing\ndifficulty engaging parents in activities\" (p. 13). The evalua-\ntors found that project staff members and teachers at project\nschools became frustrated with the lack of parent responsive-\nness, and attributed poor attendance by parents to a lack of\nconcern by the parents for their children's educations.\nHowever, they also found parents viewed themselves as\ninvolved with and concerned about their children's\neducation.\nParents can have the most significant influence on student\npreparation for and success in college, regardless of the fam-\nily's income level, ethnicity, or the amount of education the\nparentsmayhavereceived(Hossler,Braxton,&Coopersmith,\nconcluded that \"parent involvement as a form of social capi-\ntal . . . [was] positively related to college enrollment regard-\nless of the level of individual and school resources\" (p. 511).\nParent influence was identified as particularly influential for\nunderserved populations, such as Hispanics and African\nAmericans. Perna and Titus pointed out \"college preparation\nprograms, particularly those that are able to effectively\ninvolve parents, offer a promising approach\" (p. 511) in\naddressing the needs of underserved groups.\nA crucial characteristic of parent involvement is its inter-\nface with all other CIP components as parents occupy a spe-\ncial position in the student's life to help the child take\nadvantage of other services provided by a CIP. Parents are\nrecognized as an important factor in college enrollment from\nthe time students enter preschool to the completion of\nGardner and Marszalek 3\nsecondary education and the transition to college (Cabrera &\nLa Nasa, 2001), as well as throughout their college pursuits\nthe K-12 literature regarding parent involvement and con-\ncluded as follows: \"A majority of the research indicated that\nstudents performed better and had higher levels of motiva-\ntion when they were raised in homes characterized by sup-\nportive parents who were involved in schools and who\nencouraged and expected academic success\" (p. 195).\nParental influence across the socioeconomic spectrum is sig-\nnificant. As Rowan-Kenyon et al. (2008) concluded, policies\nand programs can in fact shape the educational futures of\nchildren from an early age for both low and high socioeco-\nnomic families.\nParent Involvement in Preparing for\nCollege\nA role for parents in the college selection process is articu-\nlated in the college choice literature (Hossler et al., 1989;\n(1989), in an article considered central to understanding col-\nlege choice (Cabrera & La Nasa, 2000; Griffin, del Pilar,\nthree-stage model consisting of (a) predispositions, (b)\nsearch, and (c) choice. Hossler et al. (1999) identified five\nkey factors in the predisposition stage that involve the fam-\nily: (a) socioeconomic, (b) parent education level, (c) family\nresidence characteristics, (d) parent support, and (e) parent\nencouragement. According to Hossler et al. (1999), parent\nsupport and encouragement--in the form of \"frequency of\ndiscussions between parents and students about the parents'\nexpectations, hopes, and dreams for their children\" to attend\ncollege (p. 24)--have the most influence on students attend-\ning college. In their longitudinal study, Hossler et al. (1999)\ninterviewed 4,923 students and their parents--with a smaller\nsubsample of students interviewed at least eight times as they\nmade their way to higher education or the workforce--and\nfound \"parents, other family members, and to a lesser extent,\npeers had the largest effect on students' college aspirations\"\n(p. 23). They also found students who talked with their par-\nents about their postsecondary plans were more likely plan-\nning to attend college, and were more likely certain of their\nplans, than students who did not talk to their parents. Parent\nencouragement and support were identified as important pre-\ndictors of educational aspirations for students from under-\nserved populations.\nPerna (2006) developed a well-received model that\ndescribes the basis for considering the role of the school,\ncommunity, and parents each influencing students in their\ntransition to college. Perna's model was built on the work of\nframed the college decision-making process in a multi-\nlayered context: (a) students and their families, (b) K-12\nschools and community, (c) higher education institutions, (d)\nand the broader societal, economic, and policy context. The\nmost important student level predictors for college enroll-\nment identified by Perna were (a) academic preparation and\nachievement, (b) financial resources, (c) knowledge about\ncollege, and (d) family support. This model took into account\nthe economic or human capital factors, as well as the cultural\nand sociological factors (Bourdieu & Passerson, 1977;\nColeman, 1988), in explaining the way social structures and\nresources provide or limit access to higher education\nmost relevant research regarding college access focuses on\nthe \"innermost layer of the model: the relationship between a\nstudent's parental encouragement and involvement and the\nstudent's college-related outcomes\" (p. 566). However, the\nother layers, especially the second layer (Schools and\nCommunity Context), focused attention on the need for the\nschool and community to \"provide access to resources and\nopportunities including information about college and help\nParents, Schools, and Community\nAs stated in the findings and conclusion sections of the pres-\nent article, the importance placed on parent involvement had\napositiveinteractionwithpartnershiptypegrants.Partnership\ngrants, consisting of a partnership with school and commu-\nnity organizations, may facilitate the development of parent\ninvolvement activities and break down the barriers created\nbetween the parents and school. For many educators, the\ninvolvement of parents is an affront to their credibility, and\nthough they may know the involvement of parents is impor-\ntant, they resist it. The conflict between the school and fam-\nily is not new: Lightfoot (1978) described the conflict as two\nsilos: parents and teachers, both curious about each other, yet\nthey create roadblocks for the other, even excluding one\nanother from having a positive influence.\nIn an attempt to assuage the sometimes contentious rela-\ntionship between the home and the school, Epstein (1995;\ndeveloped one of the more commonly used frameworks for\ndescribing and measuring parent involvement in the K-12\nsetting. This metric identified six types of parent involve-\nment in which schools should encourage parents to engage as\nthey seek to influence their children's education. First,\nschools should promote parenting as the most basic form of\nparent involvement by providing resources for parents to\nlearn good parenting skills, provide family support, under-\nstand child and adolescent development, and create a good\nlearning environment in the home. Second, schools should\ncommunicate with families about school programs in a recip-\nrocal relationship. Third, schools should participate in\nrecruitment, training, and other activities that include parents\nas volunteers in the school. Fourth, schools should promote\nlearning at home where teachers create homework assign-\nments requiring students to ask for help from parents, and\nencouraging students to share what they learned in school\n4 SAGE Open\nwith their families. Fifth, schools should include parents as\npartners in decision making, such as participation on school\ncouncils, improvement teams, committees, parent and\nteacher groups, or other organizations where parent input is\nvalued. Sixth, schools should coordinate resources and ser-\nvices for families to engage with community organizations,\nsuch as businesses, agencies, civic organizations, or colleges\nand universities helping families contribute their resources to\nthe community.\nIn a qualitative case study of parent involvement within\nCIP programs seeking to expand access to higher education\nfor underserved populations, Auerbach (2001; see also\nEpstein's (1995) framework for its singular focus on school-\nbased activities that include parents, and for the exclusion of\nparent involvement activities considering the unique needs\nof low-income and minority families. Low-income and\nminority families are unlikely participants in activities\ndirected by the school (Tierney &Auerbach, 2005).Auerbach\nsuggested a role for parents advocating for their children's\nrights, such as protecting children from discrimination,\nobtaining special services, resisting tracking, choosing\nschools, promoting family values, or establishing social net-\nworks with other families. Auerbach's conceptualization aids\nin helping to conceive of a type of parent involvement that is\nnot just a top-down approach originating at the school, where\nschool personnel are viewed as sages with the solutions and\nparents are expected to listen and respond. Auerbach chal-\nlenged educators to see parent involvement as involving par-\nents in making decisions and solving problems that confront\ntheir children and the school system, and not just showing up\nto school-planned activities. A less criticized concept intro-\nEpstein & Lee, 1995) is making schools more home-like and\nhomes more school-like. In family-like schools, all students,\nregardless of the challenges they bring, feel valued and\nincluded as members of the education community. In school-\nlike families, students are recognized as students, and the\nimportance of doing homework and other activities that build\nstudent skills is emphasized. Communities can create school-\nlike opportunities for students that reinforce student learning\nand create family-like settings that support families and chil-\ndren. Epstein explained that in a true partnership, the school,\nfamily, and community work together to identify and fill\ngaps where learning resources for students are lacking. In a\npartnership, gaps in community resources are filled by fam-\nily and school resources, and when the family or the school\nfalls short, community partners make up the difference.\nThe successful relationship between the school, family,\nand community depicted by Auerbach (2012b) is from the\nperspective of the school leader. According to Auerbach, the\nmotivation fueling an authentic partnership is not for the\nultimate academic results of the students in the community,\nfamily, and school, but instead for reasons fueled by social\njustice--\"it is the right thing to do\" (p. 5). Auerbach (2012a)\npresented a continuum contrasting the perspective of leader-\nship preventing partnerships and that of leadership for\nauthentic partnerships between the school, family, and com-\nmunity characterized by (a) respectful alliances, (b) dia-\nlogue across differences, and (c) sharing of power. Auerbach\n(2012a) draws attention to the need for examples of success-\nful collaborations among schools, parents, and the commu-\nnity from which school leaders can learn from and emulate.\nHands (2012) provided a case study example of what\nauthentic school, family, and community partnerships look\nlike. In short, authentic partnerships \"stemmed from a prag-\nmatic understanding that community partnerships were nec-\nessary to provide students with the learning experiences and\nsupport they needed to succeed in school and beyond\"\n(p. 187). Furthermore, the most successful partnerships\n\"were those voluntarily established by partners rather than\nthose established by legislation or mandates for collabora-\nActivities That Constitute Parent\nInvolvement\nThis study presents the following hypothesis: If the parent\ninvolvement component is viewed as important and sustain-\nable, the CIP becomes more sustainable. Gardner (2009)\nreviewed the literature on parent involvement intervention\nspecific activities intervention program administrators may\nchoose involving parents in helping the traditionally under-\nserved students in their programs become ready for college\n(McClafferty, McDonough, & Fann, 2001; Perna & Titus,\nSustainability and the Capacity for\nSustainability\nThe connection between importance placed on a program\ncomponent (e.g., parent involvement) and capacity for sus-\ntainability of the program (e.g., GEAR UP) is what our\nresearch study addresses. Sustainability means different\nthings to different people, and it is important to define \"types\nof sustainability\" (Scheirer & Dearing, 2011; Scheirer et al.,\n2008). Two terms, sustainability (Shediac-Rizkallah & Bone,\nSteckler, & Hoyle, 1993), have received the most attention\nrelevant to making innovations last beyond the grant period\nor becoming a permanent part of an organization. Shediac-\nRizkallah and Bone (1998) chose the term sustainability to\ncapture the \"general phenomenon of program continuation\"\n(p. 92) on the basis of sustainability as too broad and does not\n\"imply a static program\" (p. 92), as does institutionalization\nand routinization, but rather a dynamic and evolving con-\ncept. Sustainability was the preferred term used by Johnson\nGardner and Marszalek 5\non the work of Shediac-Rizkallah and Bone to further con-\nceptualize sustainability. Johnston et al. utilized sustainabil-\nity as their \"overarching construct\" because they believed it\nwas the only term \"broad enough to incorporate the essential\nelements of the other constructs, especially institutionaliza-\nDenning (2011) specify four different sustainability out-\ncomes: (a) continuing the project activities within the funded\norganization, (b) sustaining benefits for clients, (c) maintain-\ning a collaborative structure, and (d) maintaining attention to\nthe issues. Adopting the rationale of Shediac-Rizkallah and\nBone (1998) in our study, sustainability is the preferred term,\nand is defined as \"the process of ensuring . . . a sustainable\ninnovation . . . can be integrated into ongoing operations to\nbenefit diverse stakeholders\" beyond the time period of the\ntion, in accordance with the Scheirer et al. (2008) frame-\nwork, sustainability is also defined as \"continuing the project\nactivities within the funded organization\" (p. 336). Finally,\nour study assesses the perceived capacity of an organization\nto become sustainable, similar to the work conducted by the\nDoughterty (2011), which utilized various facets of sustain-\nability and measures to determine the potential for becoming\nsustained within the organization:\nThe degree to which the indicators in each domain exist increases\nthe likelihood that a project or program has the resources, skills,\ncapacity, and knowledge necessary to sustain components over\ntime. The stronger the existence of indicators for each of the\ndomains, the more likely a project or program can be sustained.\nResearchers in the fields of education (Buchanan et al.,\n2005) and organizational development (Foorman & Moats,\n2004) have addressed sustainability, but the literature refer-\nenced in our study to frame sustainability and the Parent\nInvolvement Component Sustainability Scale (PICSS) has\ncome out of the public health or health promotion field\net al., 2008). Our study does not rely on the conceptualiza-\ntions found in organizational development, which primarily\nare about helping organizations innovate in their thinking\nrather than sustaining innovations within organizations or\nbeyond initial grant funding. In addition, the educational\ninnovation literature focuses on reforms within school sys-\ntems, and these frameworks are less developed than those\nfound in the public health literature. The public health con-\nceptualizations are applicable to other areas of social science\nprogramming where sustainability is also a concern, such as\nin education, and are well developed through empirical and\ntheoretical research (Goodman & Steckler, 1987; Johnson et\nDenis, Pelletier, & Mannoni, 2005; Shediac-Rizkallah &\nSustainability and the capacity for sustainability is a con-\ncern in public health and education because of the consider-\nable funds devoted to interventions and innovations across\nthe United States and internationally to address health educa-\ntion issues (Johnson et al., 2004). Public- and private-fund-\ning agencies are concerned with how scarce resources are\nallocated, and desire their efficient use. The federal govern-\nment or private organizations provide seed money or demon-\nstration grant funds to initiate health promotion programs\n(e.g., Johnson et al., 2004) and expect the programs to con-\ntinue beyond the time period of the grant. The grant-funded\nprograms are not just expected to continue, they are expected\nto incorporate effective practices. Grant recipients are sub-\nject to the same pressures by the federal government or pri-\nvate-funding agencies to become sustainable and demonstrate\neffective outcomes, particularly in education.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the current study was to examine the effect of\nthe program emphasis placed on parent involvement on the\ncapacity for sustainability of the parent involvement compo-\nnent of a CIP. We hypothesized that the more importance a\nCIP placed on its parent involvement component, and the\nmore parent involvement activities the CIP implemented, the\ngreater capacity for sustainability the parent involvement\ncomponent of the CIP would have.\nMethods\nResearch Design\nThe design of this study was a web-based survey, specifically\ninvolved a nonprobability, purposive, nonproportional, quota\nsampling technique. The survey captured quantitative data\nand open-ended responses from a cross-section of current\nand former GEAR UP program administrators located\nthroughout the United States.\nPopulation and Sample\nThe target population included all GEAR UP partnership\ngrant administrators from each of the GEAR UP partnership\ngrants (n = 418) and known local or regional entities (n =\n388) within the state-awarded GEAR UP grant programs\npopulation in this study consisted of partnership grant recipi-\nents (n = 387) and local or regional entities within state\ngrants (n = 388) for which email addresses were obtained.\n(64%) were partnership grants (a response rate of 37%) and\n80 (36%) were local or regional entities within state grants\n6 SAGE Open\nGEAR UP programs received initial funding prior to or dur-\nfunding for a duration of 6 years, so those funded prior to\n2001 had to obtain additional funding by the time of data col-\nlection or cease operation). At the time of data collection,\nstill in operation.\nVariables\nCovariates.The covariates--status, type, and year--were\nentered as dichotomous variables in the multiple regression\nanalysis to answer the research question. The program status\nvariable was coded as a 1 if it was in operation and 0 if it was\nno longer in operation at the time of data collection. For the\ngrant type covariate, programs identified as a partnership\ngrant were coded as 1, and programs identified as a state\ngrant with local entities were coded with a 0. The covariate,\nfunding year, also was entered in the regression model as a\ndichotomous variable. To clarify funding year, if the pro-\ncating that the initial grant funding time period would have\nended at the time of data collection, it was coded as 0, and if\nthe program received initial funding from 2002 through\n2007, meaning that the program was at the end of the initial\ngrant period, it was coded as 1.\nImportance of Parent Involvement variable. Nineteen total CIP\ncomponents were identified by Gardner (2009) through a\nsystematic review of the intervention literature (Cunning-\ncomprehensive list of 60 components, which was then\nreduced to 19 after eliminating overlapping items. Respon-\ndents were asked to rate the level of importance of each of\nthe 19 CIP components (e.g., Career counseling) on a 5-point\nLikert scale:\nPlease identify the IMPORTANCE of each of the following\ncomponents to the GEAR UP program you specified.\nIMPORTANCE is the amount of time, personnel, financial, or\nother resources devoted to the component to help students\nPrincipal components analysis (PCA) was used to further\nreduce the CIP components, and the Importance of Parent\nInvolvement variable emerged as a combination of two CIP\ncomponents, CIP 8-Parent Involvement and CIP\n19-Volunteers are included in carrying out programs.\nParent involvement cluster variables.The parent involvement\ncluster variables represented the activities implemented by\neach GEAR UP program.

If the GEAR\nUP program you are familiar with is no longer functioning,\nplease identify the activities that were implemented when the\nHierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was then used to\nidentify clusters that grouped the parent involvement activi-\nties together based on similarity of responses.

Cluster scores represented the number of\ntimes a type of activity was implemented within an individ-\nual program.\nCapacity for the sustainability of parent involvement. The PICSS\nwas created to measure the participant perceptions of the\nfuture capacity for sustainability for the GEAR UP parent\ninvolvement components. The development of the PICSS\nand its eight facets was based on a review of public health\nliterature addressing the capacity for sustainability of public\nhealth innovations after grant funds end (Goodman & Steck-\nThe PICSS covers eight content domains with roughly\nequal numbers of items: planning early for sustainability,\nhaving a program champion, funding, evaluation, collabora-\ntion, community involvement, organizational structure, and\nprofessional development.

Because multivariate normality is an assumption\nof the multiple regression models intended for use in the\nanalysis, the variables were transformed using various\nexpressions to approximate normality (e.g., square root, nat-\nural logarithm, and inverse). Analyses were conducted with\nthe transformed variables, and repeated with the original\nvariables. Because the hypothesis test and effect size results\nwere the same for both sets of analyses, we retained the\nresults obtained with the original variables. Data screening\nalso revealed one multivariate outlier, and similar to the\ntreatment of nonnormal variables, we repeated analyses after\ndropping the case. Again, because substantive results were\nthe same, we retained the results with the original data set\nand report them here.\nSeveral preliminary comparisons were performed; the\nPICSS, the parent involvement cluster variables, and the\nImportance of Parent Involvement were compared on grant\ntype, funding year, and funding status using independent\nsamples t tests. PICSS score differed significantly, t(35.81) =\ncollection. Importance of Parent Involvement did not differ\non any of the three covariates. Programs initially funded in\n2001 or previous years implemented more Communication\nparent involvement activities (M = 3.54, SD = 0.76) than pro-\nof Communications activities implemented also differed sig-\nnificantly between state grants and partnerships grants,\nment activities classified as Concern for Parents, t(127.73) =\npartnership grants implemented more.\nPearson correlations were also examined among the fol-\nlowing variables: amount of parent involvement in the\nGEAR UP program (i.e., the five cluster variables), the\nimportance placed on parent involvement by the program\n(i.e., Component 5: Importance of Parent Involvement), and\nthe capacity for sustainability of the parent involvement\naspects of the program (i.e., the PICSS). Correlations among\nthe cluster variables were all significant and ranged in mag-\nnitude from .22 to .46, indicating varying degrees of associa-\ntion. Correlations among the PICSS and the cluster variables\nhad a similar range in magnitude from weak-to-moderate\n(.20) to moderately strong (.43). The Importance of Parent\nInvolvement variable had weak (e.g., .13, ns) to moderate\n(e.g., .30) correlations with all variables. These relationships\nprovided evidence that the variables merited further exami-\nnation in multiple regression, which would re-examine them\nafter controlling for the covariates of program type, status,\nand funding year. See Table 3 for a summary of correlations,\nmeans, and standard deviations. Pearson correlations were\nalso examined between the PICSS and each of the 19 CIP\ncomponents (see Table 2). The strongest correlation was\nbetween the PICSS and CIP 8-Parental Involvement (r = .32,\np < .01), which made up one half of the Parent Involvement\nVariable (i.e., Component 5). The other half consisted of CIP\n19-Carrying Out Programs, which correlated with the PICSS\nmoderately (r = .18, p < .01). Correlations between the\nPICSS and all other CIP components ranged from .02 (p =\nMultiple Regression Analysis\nMultiple regression was used to examine the relationships\namong the Importance of Parent Involvement variable, the\nfive parent involvement cluster variables, and the PICSS (see\nTable 4).

A hierar-\nchical-block approach was used, with the covariates entered\nsimultaneously as Block 1, the parental involvement cluster\nvariables as Block 2, the Importance of Parent Involvement\nvariable as Block 3, and interactions in Block 4. A full facto-\nrial model was tested with the following interactions: Grant\ntype \u00d7 Funding year, Grant type \u00d7 Program status, Funding\nyear \u00d7 Program status, and Grant type \u00d7 Funding year \u00d7\nProgram status. All assumptions, including homoscedasticity\nand multivariate normality, were met for the full factorial\nmodel and all subsequently reported models. In addition, all\nmodels were tested for homogeneity of slopes by testing\neach two-way interaction between a categorical covariate\nand a continuous independent variable, and all such tests but\none were statistically nonsignificant. In the full factorial\nmodel, the three-way interaction of the categorical covariates\nthe model was adjusted by dropping that term and testing\neach two-way interaction of the covariates in separate mod-\nels, but none were significant. Evidence for one two-way\ninteraction between a categorical covariate, program type,\nand a continuous independent variable, Importance of Parent\nInvolvement, was obtained in the form of a significant\nregression coefficient ( = 1.27, p < .01), and the model con-\ntaining just this one interaction was retained (see Table 4).\nThe retained model explained a large amount (31%) of the\nadj. R2 = .31. The covariates (Block 1) explained 6% of the\ntotal variance, a small-to-moderate amount, and the inclu-\nsion of the cluster variables explained an additional 23%, a\nlarge amount, which meant that the overall number of parent\ninvolvement activities implemented by a program had a\nstrong association with the capacity for sustainability of par-\nent involvement.Although Importance of Parent Involvement\ndid not add a significant amount of explanatory power on its\nProgram status had a statistically significant association ( =\n0.16, p = .01), as did the level of certain categories of parent\ninvolvement activities, such as Personalization ( = 0.18, p <\n0.26, p < .01). Program status had a moderate relationship, in\nwhich an increase of 1.00 SD was associated with an increase\nof 0.16 SD in PICSS when all other variables were con-\ntrolled. In other words, the difference in the capacity for sus-\ntainability of parent involvement found between extant\nprograms and extinct programs in our preliminary t test was\nconfirmed even after all other variables had been controlled.\nPrograms in operation had an average PICSS score of 0.16\nSD greater than programs out of operation. The regression\ncoefficients of Personalization, Communication, and\nInclusion were all small; an increase of 1.00 SD in any one of\nthese was associated with an increase of between 0.16 and\n0.26 SD in PICSS score with other variables controlled. That\nis, increases in any single type of the parent involvement\nactivities of Personalization, Communication, or Inclusion\nTable 4.

Although an\nincrease in a single type of parent involvement activity was\nrelated to improved capacity for sustainability somewhat, an\nincrease in three to five types of activities together was\nrelated to substantial improvement.\nInteraction.The interaction effect of Importance of Parent\nInvolvement and program type was significant, F(1, 212) =\nvariance in PICSS score, a small amount. Figure 1 illustrates\nthe difference in regression slopes between state grant and\npartnership grant programs when predicting PICSS score\nfrom Importance of Parent Involvement with all other vari-\nables controlled. The slope of the line for the state grant\ngroup is negative, but not statistically significant (B = -0.06,\nSE = 0.05, p = .23), and the slope of the partnership group is\npositive and statistically significant (B = 0.11, SE = 0.04, p <\n.01). These results suggest that the importance that a pro-\ngram places on getting parents involved is associated with an\nincrease in the capacity for sustainability of the parent\ninvolvement component of that program, but only if the pro-\ngram is part of a partnership grant. No association was iden-\ntified in programs funded by a state grant. This interaction\neffect is in addition to the unique main effects described\nabove.\nOpen-Ended Results\nThe open-ended data were analyzed by looking for emergent\nthemes, and through using the labels of the five parent\ninvolvement clusters as preassigned codes. The analysis\nfound 50 comments (22%) addressed Personalization\n(Cluster 2); 45 (20%) mentioned Communication (Cluster\nables that were found to have a small to medium effect on the\nPersonalization was the second parent involvement clus-\nter, and included three questionnaire items: (a) speaking the\nsame language as parents, (b) providing FAFSA counseling,\nand (c) giving personal attention to parents' needs. One\nrespondent captured the personalization theme in terms of\nrelationships with the students: \"Take time trust me there is\ntime to visit with all of these students, even after school. The\nmain point I learned is when the students are comfortable\nwith [the administrator] the parents are more likely to accept\nall invitations.\"\nCommunication and recognizing parent's demands as a\ntheme represented one or more comments from 57 (26%)\ndifferent respondents. This theme is characterized by GEAR\nUP personnel communicating information to parents through\na variety of methods, such as mailings, flyers, phone calls,\nand home visits. This theme also represents the need for\nGEAR UP personnel to acknowledge parents have many\ndemands on their schedules and desire involvement in their\nchildren's education. One respondent captured this theme in\nthe following words: \"Ask the parents what they already\nknow; what they want; what they need; and what they con-\nsider to be important. Then, build your programs from there.\"\nAnother comment from a respondent captures the sensitivity\nGEAR UP personnel should have toward parents in commu-\nnication: \"Be sensitive to culture, flexible scheduling,\ninvolve parents in the planning, provide training in native\nlanguage.\" The following comment from another respondent\nalso captures the essence of this theme:\nDon't expect parents to come to meetings or events, not because\nthey are not interested or don't care about their children but\nbecause of time, other conflicts, fear. Reach out to parents in\nother ways such as newsletters, e-mail, and college access\ncampaigns to start building relationships. Then offer workshops\nand events. Some will come.\nOne respondent encouraged other GEAR UP administra-\ntors to \"Keep the lines of communication open at all times\nInclusion was the next theme identified in the open-ended\nresponses. Parent advisory committees were mentioned by\nfour respondents. This same structure was identified by other\nrespondents as a \"Parent Action Committee.\" One respon-\ndent captured the rationale for including parents and a pos-\nsible approach toward parents: \"Far too often we think we\nknow what they need. Until we bring them into the decision-\nmaking process, we will continue to provide services that are\nirrelevant to their immediate needs.\" Parents' views on what\ntheir children need and on parents' help in making decisions\nmay enrich the parent involvement component, and serve as\na mechanism for increasing parent involvement itself.\nAdditional insight regarding the involvement of parents\non boards included advisory committees led by parents,\nmaking sure the parent boards are ongoing, and giving par-\nents responsibility for planning events and reaching out to\nother parents. Another respondent described the significant\nFigure 1. Scatterplot of the association between Importance of\nParent Involvement and PICSS score moderated by program type.\nNote. Only the line for partnership programs is statistically significant\nComponent Sustainability Scale.\nGardner and Marszalek 13\nrole for parents within the GEAR UP program: \"Parents\ndesign the program and work on committees to keep the\ninterest going. They work with staff to participate in specific\nopportunities that relate to their children's education. These\nare ongoing committees.\" The parent advisory or action\ncommittee theme was identified by other respondents who\nlisted parent leadership, parent board of trustees, parents\nattending national conferences, and the training of parents.\nThe involvement of parents on boards and other decision-\nmaking committees and activities was included among the\n27 parent involvement activities in the questionnaire, and\nmay have adequately represented many of the respondents'\nexperiences. However, the detail provided by respondents\nabout the different types of boards or committees, and the\ndifferent involvement activities, further informs and enriches\nthe practice of involving parents in productive ways.\nThe inclusion cluster represents the many ways GEAR\nUP personnel include parents' weekend programs, instruc-\ntional programs for students, advising for parents, and hav-\ning parents work on committees or serve on decision-making\nand planning boards. Respondents' comments encouraged\ngetting parents talking to parents, and having parents partici-\npate in a variety of activities. One suggestion that stood out\nwas to \"pick a particular parent who is involved and use that\nparent to help reach other parents.\" Another key point was\nthat parents need to work with GEAR UP personnel so that\neveryone can recognize that they are working for the same\ngoal.\nDiscussion\nOur results indicate program status (i.e., whether or not the\nprogram was still extant) and the number of parent involve-\nment activities in which programs engaged from three sepa-\nrate clusters or categories (Personalization, Communication,\nand Inclusion) had small-to-medium associations with the\ncapacity for sustainability of the parent involvement compo-\nnents of CIPS, and together explained a large proportion of\nits variance. Although the importance programs placed on\nincorporating parent involvement did not have a direct rela-\ntionship, it did have a significant interaction with program\ntype (i.e., whether a program was funded with a state grant or\na partnership grant). These findings are discussed below.\nThe regression coefficient of program status seems to\nindicate an association between the sustainability of parent\ninvolvement program components and the sustainability of\nthe overall CIP itself. When all other variables are held con-\nstant, the more sustainable the parent involvement compo-\nnent is (i.e., the higher the PICSS score), the higher capacity\nfor sustainability. This relationship provides evidence of\nconsequential validity for PICSS scores.\nThe number of parent involvement activities a GEAR UP\nprogram implemented that were identified as Personalization\nhad a small-to-medium relationship with PICSS score, and\nthe category consisted of three basic activities, the fewest\nnumber of any cluster used in the analysis: (a) program per-\nsonnel speak the same language as parents; (b) FAFSA coun-\nseling is provided for parents; and (c) personal attention is\ngiven to parents' needs. Personalization seems to indicate\nactivities in which program personnel constructively inter-\nacted with parents on an individual basis. In contrast, the\nseven activities identified as part of the Concern for Parents\ncluster seem to share the characteristic of program policies\nthat take parent concerns into account. Two representative\nactivities were (a) differences in parents' ethnicity, educa-\ntion, and socioeconomic status are respected and (b) flexible\nscheduling of activities takes into account parents' work\nschedules. The fact that Personalization had a significant\neffect and that Concern for Parents did not seems to indicate\nthat CIPs should focus on improving individual interactions\nbetween staff and parents to increase sustainability.\nCommunication activities were identified as having a\nsmall-to-medium association on the PICSS, and represented\nGEAR UP administrators' efforts to get information out to\nparents about what was taking place and how parents could\nbecome involved. In the open-ended portion of the survey,\nwhen GEAR UP administrators provided advice in the form\nof encouragement to keep on trying to involve parents, they\noften mentioned efforts to communicate to parents about\nwhat is occurring in the GEAR UP program. For example,\none respondent wrote that to involve parents, \"communica-\ntion is the KEY. Empower parents to have a vital role in\nGEAR UP.\" Another respondent provided advice about how\nto design communication in a way that grabs parents' atten-\ntion: \"keep mail outs simple and on point. Parents are too\nbusy to read lengthy literature. Something has to grab their\nattention right off or it is tossed or set aside.\" We observed\nmore Communication activities on average in programs\nwhich suggests that current CIPS should rededicate them-\nselves to implementing this type of activity.\nInclusion activities had the largest association with the\ncapacity for sustainability. The inclusion of parents in activi-\nties that get them highly involved in the programming, deci-\nsion-making, and recruitment activities of GEAR UP enables\nthem to increase their networks with GEAR UP personnel,\neducators, and others who can provide access to important\nresources. Perhaps the most import networking is among\nparents as they work together toward common goals, such as\nthe implementation of other program components. An\nincrease of one standard deviation in inclusion activities cor-\nresponds to an increase of over one-quarter of a standard\ndeviation in capacity for sustainability. The open-ended data\nsuggest administrators believe this type of involvement\nresults in benefits for both the parents and their children. The\npurpose is not to increase the number of parents who are\nattending meetings, classes, or workshops as passive partici-\npants, but instead to help parents become involved as advo-\ncates in the education of their children, and of other\nchildren for whom access to higher education is blocked.\nOne respondent made the connection between parent\ninvolvement and student benefits: \"Parent support is one of\nthe most important ways to help the students. Do all you can\nto get them involved and interested in the program, and then\ndo even more!\"\nWorkshops and seminars are often identified as an effec-\ntive way to involve parents, but merely holding a workshop\nis not the best parent involvement activity (ED, 2003).\nMerely holding a workshop, seminar, or class for parents\nmay not bring about positive results. Open-ended responses\nindicated parents'needs were important considerations when\nplanning and selecting topics and incentives for parent par-\nticipation in workshops. One way parent workshops and\nclasses were more effective addressing parents' needs was\nthe involvement of a third party specializing in classes and\nseminars for parents. This idea was introduced in the evalua-\ntion of the first two years of GEAR UP (ED, 2003). The pres-\nent study found some GEAR UP programs had involved\ncontractors operating under the state grants to work with par-\nents in 9- or 10-week courses, where parents were recog-\nnized for \"graduating\" if they attended a certain percentage\nof the classes. Three respondents mentioned the organiza-\ntion, Parent Institute for Quality Education (PIQE), and\npraised the efforts of that program to help parents learn from\neach other how to help their children. Created in 1987, PIQE\ninitially brought together parents in a San Diego community\nto talk about their poor living conditions and the poor perfor-\nmance of their children in school. The PIQE program grew\ninto weekly meetings for parents and several programs\nthroughout the State of California.\nAnother theme emerging from the analysis of the recom-\nmended parent involvement activities was including parents\nin GEAR UP planning and programming. The inclusion of\nparents allows parents to take part in providing services to\ntheir children and tailoring those services to meet individual\nneeds. Including parents is a high involvement activity, giv-\ning them real responsibilities, such as participating on plan-\nning committees, being part of decision-making bodies, and\nreaching out to other parents to involve them in GEAR UP\nservices.\nInteraction Between Importance of Parent\nInvolvement and Program Type\nAlthough the importance programs placed on parent involve-\nment had no direct association with the capacity for sustain-\nability of their parent involvement components, one of the\nkey findings of this research study was the interaction\nbetween program type (i.e., partnership grants vs. state\ngrants) and the importance placed on parent involvement in\nthe sustainability of the parent involvement program compo-\nnent. Specifically, the importance of parent involvement had\na positive association with the PICSS score for partnership\ntype programs, but no association with state grant\nprograms.\nWhen a partnership type program is applied for, the part-\nnership must consist of one or more local education agen-\ncies, one or more degree-granting institutions of higher\neducation, and \"no less than two additional community orga-\nnizations or entities such as businesses, professional organi-\ndo not have the same expectations to create partnerships\nprior to the submission of the grant. After receiving a state\ntype grant, it is typical that local entities resembling partner-\nship grants are then created to provide the GEAR UP ser-\nvices. The creating of partnerships at a very early stage, by\npartnership grant recipients, may provide for stronger part-\nnerships and services more clearly focused on meeting the\nneeds of the local area, and these partnerships may have a\nstronger focus on parent involvement or better carry out par-\nent involvement-focused services than recipients of state\ngrants. Partnership type grants, because of their early focus\non developing partnerships, are able to carry out GEAR UP\nservices in more personalized ways and focus on the needs of\nthe local area. We observed that partnership grants imple-\nmented more parent involvement activities on average than\nstate grants in the areas of Concern for Parents,\nCommunication, Inclusion, and Services Provided.\nPartnership type grants funded through the GEAR UP\norganization, as opposed to GEAR UP state funded grants,\nmay accurately portray the concept of overlapping spheres of\ninfluence introduced by Epstein (1995), Epstein and Jansorm\nof authentic partnerships discussed by Auerbach (2012a) and\ndescribed by Hands (2012). This conceptualization of a part-\nnership is where the school, family, and community work\ntogether to meet the needs of students, each filling in gaps\nwhere the others are lacking. Partnership grants funded\nthrough GEAR UP can facilitate the partnership between the\nschool, family, and community. The early planning that takes\nplace as GEAR UP partnership grants are prepared for sub-\nmission is essential to program capacity for sustainability,\nand is a good example of one faucet of the PICSS, which was\nPlanning Early for Sustainability (Goodman & Steckler,\nLimitations\nAlthough we believe our sample is representative of GEAR\nUP programs in the United States, our nonrandom sampling\nmethodology may not guarantee it, which somewhat limits\nthe generalizability of our results. In addition, the use of a\ncross-sectional design precludes the use of temporal effects\nas a source of support for causality. The analytical methods\nwe use are based on correlations, which are a necessary but\ninsufficient component of causality. Another limitation is the\nself-report nature of the data used, which makes the results\nvulnerable to social desirability bias. For example, some\nGEAR UP administrators may have answered survey\nGardner and Marszalek 15\nquestions in ways they perceived as more acceptable to the\nlarger educational community. In an effort to reduce poten-\ntial social desirability bias, all participants were informed\nthrough an informed consent document that \"neither you nor\nthe program you represent will be identified in the written\nreport with the findings reported in the aggregate . . . To pro-\ntect you from identification, your responses will not be ana-\nlyzed, reported, or otherwise connected with your name.\" An\narea of focus for future research is the measuring of actual or\nfuture sustainability, as this current study focused on the par-\nticipant perceptions of future capacity for sustainability.\nFuture studies can expand on our results by addressing these\nlimitations, but with the present findings, several lessons\napply to the broader CIP community.\nLessons Learned\nParent involvement within CIP's is recognized as an impor-\ntant component of comprehensive intervention that helps\nstudents from underserved backgrounds, particularly for stu-\ndents who are the first in their family to attend college, aca-\ndemically underprepared, are members of an ethnic minority,\nor are from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Parent\ninvolvement is not an easy component to implement (ED,\n2003); however, respondents participating in this study and\nrepresenting the perspectives of their GEAR UP funded pro-\ngrams believe parent involvement is beneficial for parents\nand students in ways that make the struggle to implement it\nworthwhile. The parent involvement activities that are rec-\nommended as a result of this study include getting parents in\nhighly involved and engaging activities, such as planning\nactivities for other CIP components for their children or for\nother parents. Parents also can participate on decision-\nmaking boards where they can give their input on the long-\nterm direction of the program, but especially the parent\ninvolvement component. Programs should focus more on\nincreasing positive one-on-one interactions between parents\nand staff and among parents. Finally, parents can recruit\nother parents; parents who are natural leaders can reach out\nto their peers and involve them in CIP-sponsored activities.\nBy participating, parents can develop valuable networks with\nother parents who have not, themselves, attended college.\nFrom a program development standpoint, the process of\napplying for a GEAR UP partnership grant where K-12 and\nhigher education institutions, as well as community organi-\nzations, are working together at the early stages of imple-\nmentation are a great opportunity for key stakeholders in\nbuilding strong relationships, and identifying and solidifying\nCIP components, such as parent involvement, in helping\nunderserved students make the transition from high school to\ncollege. Furthermore, the successful implementation of par-\nent involvement is more likely when the schools, commu-\nnity, and parents are working together to identify how\nimportant components, such as parent involvement, can\nbecome sustainable beyond the time period of the grant.\nWe conclude that parent involvement is in fact an impor-\ntant component of any early intervention program seeking to\nhelp students prepare for college, and parent involvement\nactivities providing the most beneficial outcome for parents\nand their children are activities including parents in the plan-\nning, decision-making, and recruitment functions of the\nGEAR UP program. GEAR UP services for parents should\nbegin as soon as services are offered to students, and parents\nneed recognition as an important part of GEAR UP services\nfrom the beginning. Planning for sustainability is an issue\nneeding focus at the beginning of program planning, even as\ngroups representing schools and the community work\ntogether submitting GEAR UP partnership grants, as indi-\ncated by the moderation effect of the type of program imple-\nmented on the relationship between the importance of parent\ninvolvement and the capacity for sustainability of the GEAR\nUP parent involvement program. The sustainability of the\nCIP itself seems impacted.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdelman, C.
