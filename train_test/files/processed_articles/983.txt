Popkin1\n1 Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.\n2 Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.\nHealth disparity by socioeconomic status has recently become an important public health concern.\nSocioeconomic status may affect health status through several pathways including lifestyle choices. The authors\ntested the link between socioeconomic status and lifestyle in China (in 1993) and in the United States (in 1994\u00ad\n1996), countries with high contrasts in development, to understand health discrepancy issues cross-nationally.\nHealthfulness of lifestyle was measured using the Lifestyle Index, a summary score that integrates four key\nlifestyle factors: diet, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Income and education were used as\nindicators of socioeconomic status. In China, as socioeconomic status improved, lifestyle was less healthy\nConversely, in the United States, higher socioeconomic status was related to a healthier lifestyle (relative odds\nfor the highest socioeconomic status group = 3.81, 95% confidence interval: 2.94, 4.94). The contrasting relation\nbetween socioeconomic status and lifestyle depicts different phases of the lifestyle transition (changes in\nlifestyles accompanying economic development). The differences may in part explain why nutrition-related\nnoncommunicable diseases are more prevalent in the developing world among people with a high socioeconomic\nstatus, whereas often the opposite is found in developed societies. Public health programs may benefit by\nadvising each socioeconomic status group separately, while considering the country's level of development.\nChina; education; health; income; life style; socioeconomic factors; United States\nSocioeconomic status has been identified in the health\nliterature as a powerful determinant of health status (1).\nHigher morbidity and mortality among people with a lower\nsocioeconomic status (most frequently referring to lower\nincome and lower education) have been reported across a\nwide range of health issues (2\u00ad4).\nVarious factors that can affect health outcomes are\nsummarized in figure 1. The influence of lifestyle, including\ndiet, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption,\non long-term health outcomes (pathway e) is strongly indi-\ncated in the literature (5). Other pathways by which socio-\neconomic status influences health outcomes include\ninequality of access to health care (6) and health care quality,\nsuch as diagnosis, treatment, and control (pathways f and i)\n(7). Differential exposure and responses by socioeconomic\nstatus to environmental, biologic, social, and psychological\nfactors, such as neighborhood, pathogens, support, and\nstress, can also result in health inequality (1, 8, 9).\nIn recent years, the pathways where the effect of income\nand education on health status is mediated by lifestyle\nchoices (pathways a through d in figure 1) have become\nmore evident, as the disparity in health status presented\nacross socioeconomic status groups seemed to reflect the\napparent changes in lifestyle observed worldwide. The life-\nstyle transition, a set of changes occurring in lifestyle behav-\niors along with the progress of economic development, is\nspreading worldwide. The direction of the shift, however,\nseems to differ among socioeconomic status groups across\ncountries depending on their various levels of development.\nThe most rapid changes in diet are found in the lower-\nincome countries as economic development increases (10).\nThe shift is most often toward an unhealthy diet character-\nized by higher fat levels and greater amounts of added sugar,\nespecially among the higher socioeconomic status groups in\ndeveloping countries (11). As societies have grown more\ndependent on labor-saving devices, sedentary lifestyles have\nbecome more common around the world. Less time is spent\nCorrespondence to Dr. Barry M.

These changes in life-\nstyle are in line with the discrepant patterns of health status\nseen around the world. In developed societies, people with a\nhigh socioeconomic status are healthier than those with a\nlow socioeconomic status (13). However, in the developing\nworld, nutrition-related noncommunicable health conditions\n(such as obesity) are often more prevalent as socioeconomic\nstatus improves (14).\nThese observations motivated us to test whether there is a\nlink between socioeconomic status and lifestyle that may\nlead to contrasting health profiles worldwide. The authors\nhypothesized that there is a systematic difference in health-\nfulness of lifestyle by socioeconomic status, with the pattern\ndepending on the country's level of development, which\nmay explain the difference in the relation of health with\nsocioeconomic status from country to country. This study\nexamined the hypothesis by modeling pathways a through d\n(shown in figure 1) separately for China and the United\nStates, countries with a high contrast in their levels of\neconomic development.\nData and subjects\nNational in-depth surveys from China and the United\nStates were analyzed for this study. The 1993 China Health\nand Nutrition Survey included approximately 14,000 indi-\nviduals drawn by a multistage, random cluster process in\neight provinces, whose socioeconomic and other health,\nnutritional, and demographic factors vary substantially (15).\nThe data collection for the China Health and Nutrition\nSurvey followed human subject-approval procedures of the\nhuman subjects protection committees of the University of\nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health and\nthe Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine. The 1994\u00ad\n1996 US Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals\nsurveyed a representative national probability sample of the\nUS population consisting of more than 16,000 individuals\nwho were drawn by a complex, multistage, area probability\nsample design. The data collection details for each survey\nhave been previously described (15, 16). Both data sets have\ncomparable information on socioeconomic status and life-\nstyle behaviors. Our study subjects were adults aged 20 or\nmore years who provided lifestyle data and who were not\npregnant or lactating. To effectively contrast the socioeco-\nnomic status profiles of those with healthier and unhealthy\nlifestyles, we included in our statistical modeling analysis\ngroups in the upper and lower tiers of healthfulness of life-\nstyle, which resulted in a sample size of 5,280 persons from\nthe China Health and Nutrition Survey and 6,301 persons\nfrom the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals.\nMeasures\nHealthfulness of lifestyle was measured using the Life-\nstyle Index for the individuals of the study samples. The\nLifestyle Index is a summary measure created for cross-\nnational comparisons based on global health concerns, inte-\ngrating four key lifestyle factors: diet, physical activity,\nsmoking, and alcohol use (17). Each factor of the Lifestyle\nrespectively), reflecting its relative importance in health\n(18\u00ad21). Diet quality was assessed with respect to variety,\nadequacy, moderation, and overall balance by measuring\nintakes of various foods and nutrients. Physical activity was\nevaluated by level of physical activity. Both status and\namount of smoking determined the smoking score. Alcohol\nconsumption was assessed by the type of alcohol drinking\n(regular or binge), as well as by the amount of alcohol\nFIGURE 1. Pathways linking socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, and health (e, f, g, h, and i not modeled in this study).\nconsumed. Each component index (and thus the Lifestyle\nIndex) has a gradient of scores based on the healthfulness of\nlifestyle: the higher the score, the healthier the lifestyle. The\nLifestyle Index scores range from zero to 100 points, with\n100 points implying the successful achievement of healthy\nlifestyle goals.\nWe categorized the continuous measures of healthfulness\nof lifestyle (the Lifestyle Index scores) into three groups:\nhigh (more than 80 points). These Lifestyle Index score\ngroups, created by the absolute cutpoints, approximated the\ntertile groups of the Lifestyle Index score in both countries.\nThis implies that the groups also reflect the relative posi-\ntioning of healthfulness of lifestyle in each country. The\noutcome in the modeling analysis was a healthy (high Life-\nstyle Index scores) or unhealthy (low Lifestyle Index scores)\nlifestyle.\nInformation on income and education was used to repre-\nsent socioeconomic status as the main independent variables.\nBecause our focus was to compare how relative socioeco-\nnomic status (rather than exact level of income or education)\nrelates to healthfulness of lifestyle across the countries, the\nsocioeconomic status indicators were categorized with\ncountry-specific cutoff points. For China, the total house-\nhold income per capita (average monthly income from work,\nincluding subsidies and bonuses, and household income\nfrom other sources, adjusted using a price index) was catego-\nrized into tertiles. For the United States, the annual approxi-\nmated income from all sources, earned by all of the\nhousehold members before taxes, was expressed as a\npercentage of the poverty threshold based on income and\nhead count of the household members. Cutoffs of 185\npercent and 350 percent of the poverty threshold were used\nto distinguish low-, middle-, and high-income groups for the\nUnited States.\nThe level of education was measured by the number of\nyears of education in formal school. The distribution of years\nof education in China and the United States varied substan-\ntially. For China, those with no formal education (more than\n20 percent of the analyzed sample) were put into the low-\neducation group, those with formal education up to or\nincluding the sixth grade were put into the middle-education\ngroup, and those with more than a sixth grade education\nwere put into the high-education group. For the United\nStates, we used cutoffs of less than 12 years (low), 12 years\n(middle), and greater than 12 years (high) of education. For\nthose with no education data available in the United States\n(n = 102, 1.6 percent of the analyzed sample), we imputed\nthe educational level with the use of a regression equation\nrelating years of education to age, gender, area of residence,\nregion, income, occupation, and race.\nAs control variables, sociodemographic factors that may\nsimultaneously be related to socioeconomic status and\nhealthfulness of lifestyle were included in the analysis. For\nexample, in China, gender is highly associated with both the\nlevel of education and smoking and alcohol consumption\nbehaviors. Therefore, gender may confound the relation\nbetween education and lifestyle. The control variables\nincluded age, gender, area of residence, and region in both\ncountries and, additionally, race in the United States. We\ncategorized age in years into three groups, with cutoff points\nat 35 years and 55 years of age. For China, we used two cate-\ngories for area of residence: urban and rural. For the United\nStates, three urbanization categories were available based on\nMetropolitan Statistical Area status: central city, outside\ncentral city, and non-Metropolitan Statistical Area. For the\nregion variable in China, the eight provinces surveyed were\ncategorized into two geographic groups, southern and\nnorthern. For the United States, four regional distinctions\n(Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) were used. Addition-\nally, for the United States, five racial groups (White, African\nAmerican, Asian and Pacific Islander, American Indian and\nAlaskan Native, and other) and an imputed-income indicator\n(described in detail below) were included.\nStatistical analysis\nWe summarized, separately for China and the United\nStates, the distribution of the variables in each sample. The\neffect of income and education on healthfulness of lifestyle\nwas examined using logistic regression. The effect of socio-\neconomic status on lifestyle was initially tested with more\nfinely divided Lifestyle Index score groups. Moreover, the\nsocioeconomic status of individuals in the highest tertile or\nquartile of the Lifestyle Index score was contrasted against\nthe socioeconomic status of those in the lowest tertile or\nquartile of the Lifestyle Index score. However, all of the\nmodels with finer outcome categories or with different\ncutoffs of Lifestyle Index scores showed very similar results.\nTherefore, this study presents the results by logistic regres-\nsion with the dichotomous outcome of low versus high Life-\nstyle Index scores based on absolute cutoffs of less than 60\npoints versus greater than 80 points, the most interpretable\ncategories.\nThis study modeled, separately for China and the United\nStates, pathways a through d, shown in figure 1. In other\nwords, we did not combine the two samples into one large\ndata set but examined each country separately with compa-\nrable specifications. The models were built as comparably as\npossible between China and the United States, but some\ndeviation was allowed to make each model most appropriate\nfor its country. The full models included income and educa-\ntion (used as the main effect variables) and interaction terms\nbetween income and education, as well as sociodemographic\nvariables (used as control variables). None of the variables in\nthe models was collinear. By including both income and\neducation in the same model, we could assess the indepen-\ndent effect of each. Interaction between income and educa-\ntion was included to examine any modification of income\neffect by education or vice versa, as well as the cumulative\neffect of income and education in relation to healthfulness of\nlifestyle. To evaluate the interaction, we compared the full\nmodel with a reduced model without income-education\ninteraction terms. First, the difference in odds ratio between\nthe strata of the main effect variables was examined from the\nfull model. A difference greater than 50 percent between the\nstrata was considered significant (22). Next, we performed a\nlikelihood ratio test at an alpha level of 20 percent,\ncomparing the reduced model with the full model (23).\nConfounding by the control variables was examined by\nSocioeconomic Profiles and Healthier Lifestyles 187\nexcluding the control variables from the full model, one at a\ntime. A change in estimate greater than 10 percent was\nconsidered significant (22).\nFor variables that were initially continuous measures but\ncategorized for analysis (i.e., income, education, and age),\nwe assigned indicator variables for the group distinction. We\nchose the lowest levels (low income, low education, and 20\u00ad\n35 years of age) as the referent group in all of the analyses.\nIndicator variables were also used for the other sociodemo-\ngraphic variables. For both countries, we chose females and\nrural area as the referent group. Additional referent groups\nincluded the northern province for China and the Northeast\nregion and the White race for the United States. In the\nContinuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals, the\nincome level of households that had not provided the exact\ninformation on income had been imputed by the US Depart-\nment of Agriculture based on either a broader income cate-\ngory, monthly income, regression equation, or segment-level\nmean income (16). In our analysis sample, income values of\nhave been imputed by the four imputation methods, respec-\ntively. Because a substantial proportion of the sample (24.7\npercent) had imputed income values, we included addition-\nally for the United States a dummy variable that distin-\nguished households with an imputed income to adjust for\nany estimation error.\nIn both the China and US surveys, data were collected\nfrom multiple members of the same households whose life-\nstyles may be correlated. We incorporated a Huber correc-\ntion to adjust for the correlation among the same household\nmembers, using a cluster option that corrects variances.\nDesign effects were also taken into account for the China\nHealth and Nutrition Survey data, combining the province\nand city/county distinctions as a cluster variable. For the\nUnited States, adjustment by the sampling weights made the\nresults representative of the total US population. All anal-\nyses were performed using Stata statistical software, version\nRESULTS\nThe distribution of the outcome, main effect, and control\nvariables among the analysis sample in each country is\nsummarized in table 1. All the variables were fairly evenly\ndistributed except area of residence in China and race in the\nUnited States. The distributions were comparable between\nChina and the United States.\nThe key findings from the logistic regression analysis are\nshown in table 2. The odds ratio and its 95 percent confi-\ndence interval are presented for the referent groups including\nlow income, low education, younger age, female gender, and\nrural area for both China and the United States; the northern\nregion for China and the Northeast for the United States;\nand, additionally, White race and reported income for the\nUnited States. For both China and the United States, the\ninteraction between and the additional cumulative effect of\nincome and education were not significant. Removal of\ngender and age from the model each changed the estimates\nof the main exposure variables greater than 10 percent for\nChina (most notably those of education), illustrating the\nconfounding effect of gender and age. None of the control\nvariables in the United States changed the odds ratio esti-\nmates significantly.\nIn China, as the income level increased, the likelihood of\nhaving a healthier lifestyle decreased significantly in a linear\ntrend. Compared with the lowest tertile income group, the\nhighest tertile income group was 2.5 times less likely to have\na healthier lifestyle. A similar trend was seen for education.\nAs the level of education increased, the likelihood of having\na healthier lifestyle decreased. Compared with people with\nno formal education, those with more than 6 years of educa-\ntion (high education group) were 1.8 times less likely to have\na healthier lifestyle.\nConversely, in the United States, as the income level\nincreased, the likelihood of having a healthier lifestyle\nincreased. People in the highest income category were about\n1.6 times as likely to have a healthier lifestyle than people in\nthe lowest income group. A similar but even more\npronounced trend was shown by educational level. People\nwith more than a high school education were 2.8 times more\nlikely to have a healthier lifestyle than were people with less\nthan a high school education.\nNext, we present the likelihood of having a healthy life-\nstyle with both income and education taken into account, by\nsummarizing nine combinations of the income and education\ngroups (low, middle, and high of each) into five socioeco-\nnomic status groups: low (both low income and low educa-\ntion), lower middle (one low and the other middle), middle\n(both middle, or one low and the other high), higher middle\n(one middle and the other high), and high (both high). Figure\n2 shows the likelihood of healthy lifestyle from the full\nmodel by those five socioeconomic status groups by country,\nwith the lowest socioeconomic status group (low income and\nlow education) as the referent. The average of the odds ratios\nwithin the five groups is illustrated on a logarithmic scale. A\ncontrasting gradient in the likelihood of having a healthier\nlifestyle for China and the United States is clearly seen. In\nChina, as socioeconomic status improved, the odds of having\na healthier lifestyle decreased; conversely, in the United\nStates, the odds increased with a similar magnitude. The\nhighest socioeconomic status group in China was more than\nfive times less likely than the lowest to have a healthier life-\nstyle (odds ratio for the highest socioeconomic status\nthe United States, the highest socioeconomic status group\nwas about four times more likely than the lowest to have a\nhealthier lifestyle (odds ratio for the highest socioeconomic\nDISCUSSION\nIn studying China and the United States, we found a clear\ncontrast in the relation of socioeconomic status and health-\nfulness of lifestyle, which may explain the differential\npatterns of change in health profiles observed worldwide. In\ndeveloping countries, nutrition-related noncommunicable\ndiseases are more prevalent among those with a high socio-\neconomic status; in developed societies, often the opposite is\nfound. A rapid change in lifestyle is consistently predicted in\nthe literature to lead to a similar increase in chronic diseases\namong specific socioeconomic status groups (25, 26). The\nprevalence of lifestyle-related chronic disease may rise even\nfaster, especially in the lower-income countries, as the life-\nstyle transition accelerates. Although research on Brazil and\nthe Latin American countries indicates a shift toward more\nobesity among the poor (27), this trend has not been consis-\ntently found in Asia, Africa, or the Middle East. Studies on\ndietary behavior in China indicate that the burden of a\nhigher-fat diet is expected to shift toward the poor by the\nThe marked contrasts in the relation between socioeco-\nnomic status and healthfulness of lifestyle shown in China\nand the United States suggest that the various socioeconomic\nstatus groups experience different patterns of the lifestyle\ntransition, depending on the country's level of development.\nIn developing countries like China, only the low socioeco-\nnomic status group seems to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\nTABLE 1.

The referent group for the comparison is the lowest socioeconomic\nstatus group (low income and low education).\nbecome exposed to a Western lifestyle, they readily adopt\nsome of its unhealthy aspects of lifestyle (including a diet\nhigh in fat and sugar and becoming more sedentary), in part\nbecause these choices are viewed as privileges of the\nwealthy. Such behaviors may have become even more\napparent in China since the market system was introduced\n(28). The drastic change that started in the late 1970s from\nthe government-controlled food distribution system to a free\nmarket may be continually leading people in the high socio-\neconomic status groups to change their food-buying habits\nto select foods that are not only more expensive but also less\nhealthy. In China, the overall level of education does not\nappear to be high enough to support healthier lifestyle\nchoices.\nIn the developed societies, people have become accus-\ntomed to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, which evolved\nalmost by default as a result of economic development. This\ntype of lifestyle is characterized by a poor quality diet (low\nin fruits, vegetables, and grains; low in micronutrients) and\nlack of physical activity. Processed foods, which in these\ncountries cost less but are poor in quality compared with\nnatural foods, are readily available. People are less active\nbecause of increased use of energy-saving devices and\nmotorized transportation. Choosing healthier lifestyle\nbehaviors involves making deliberate choices that people\nwith a higher socioeconomic status can most easily afford\n(e.g., buying natural rather than processed foods, joining\nhealth clubs, investing in sports equipment). Even engaging\nin walking or running warrants a safer environment that is\nusually available for those with a higher socioeconomic\nstatus.\nSmoking and alcohol drinking behaviors themselves, as\nwell as the relation between socioeconomic status and the\nbehaviors, may be less sensitive to the level of development\nthan is diet or physical activity. Smoking and alcohol use\nseem to reflect more of the cultural practices associated with\nsociodemographic factors that are also related to socioeco-\nnomic status. In China, smoking and alcohol drinking behav-\niors are found almost exclusively among the males. Higher\neducation is also greatly associated with the male gender in\nChina. Therefore, the relation between socioeconomic status\nand lifestyle is strongly confounded by gender in China. The\nrelation is also confounded by age, as older people are signif-\nicantly less educated and engaged more in unhealthy behav-\niors than the younger generation in China. In the United\nStates, although the proportions of smokers and heavy\nalcohol drinkers are higher among males than females, the\ndifference between genders is not as great as in China. In\naddition, gender is not significantly related to education in\nthe United States.\nIt is interesting to note the similarity of the health behav-\niors among those in the highest socioeconomic status group\nin China and the lowest socioeconomic status group in the\nUnited States. A vision of a broader development process\nmight potentially suggest a U-shaped relation between the\nlevel of development and healthfulness of lifestyles.\nHowever, this was not within the analysis of this study.\nOf the pathways shown in figure 1, we modeled only path-\nways a through d. Our results, in combination with the\nexisting literature, suggest that the contrasting relation\nbetween socioeconomic status and healthfulness of lifestyle\nmay affect the link between lifestyle and health outcomes\naccordingly. However, testing the pathway (pathway e in\nfigure 1) was beyond the scope of this study. There are other\nfactors involved in the pathway that could not be examined\nin this study. The route by which income and education\naffect health outcomes through other factors, such as health\ncare and environmental, biologic, social, and psychological\ninfluences (pathways f and i), may have different patterns for\nChina and the United States. For example, people with a\nhigher socioeconomic status in China have better access to\nand quality of health care and more positive social interac-\ntions than those with a lower socioeconomic status. These\npositive elements related to a higher socioeconomic status\nwould offset the negative effect of their unhealthy lifestyles\non health status. Therefore, the net result of health outcomes\nfor China may not reflect the differences in healthfulness of\nlifestyle by socioeconomic status groups as clearly as for the\nUnited States. People with a higher socioeconomic status in\nthe United States have both healthier lifestyles and better\nhealth care. Therefore, the effect of socioeconomic status on\nhealth outcome may be rather amplified by the other factors.\nParameters of socioeconomic status may be intertwined in\ninfluencing health behaviors differently, depending on the\nlevel of development. In developed countries where people\nare generally well educated, cultural norms agree with\nhealthy lifestyle choices. In this setting, the higher cost of\nhealthy lifestyles may be a realistic barrier to healthy life-\nstyle choices. In developing countries, a healthy lifestyle is\nusually more affordable than an unhealthy one. Because the\nlevel of education is not high enough to form healthy cultural\nnorms in these countries, the healthy choices, despite the\nfavorable cost, frequently lose their place to desires for the\nnovel and Westernized that are often unhealthy. In this case,\nit probably is not the cost that prevents people from engaging\nin healthy behaviors but the norms related to education.\nApplying a market segmentation technique in the health\nfield has been documented in the literature (31). Undoubt-\nedly, public health promotions would be more effective if\ntargeted to subpopulation groups for their specific needs.\nThe findings of this study suggest that global health promo-\ntion efforts include developing strategies that take socioeco-\nnomic status and level of economic development into\naccount. In developing countries, the focus should be on\nredirecting the lifestyle transition, especially among the\nhigher socioeconomic status groups, so that they can regain\na healthier lifestyle. Developing countries may benefit\ngreatly by establishing healthy cultural norms that encourage\nhealthier lifestyle choices through education. In developed\ncountries, an effective strategy may include tackling the cost\nbarrier by modifying the environment to one that promotes\nmore physical activity and makes healthier foods more avail-\nable and affordable, especially to the lower socioeconomic\nstatus groups. As the world increasingly faces lifestyle tran-\nsitions toward an unhealthy lifestyle, both in developing and\ndeveloped countries, these focused interventions would have\na particularly effective impact on global public health.\nSocioeconomic Profiles and Healthier Lifestyles 191\n"
