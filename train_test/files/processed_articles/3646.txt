Due to reductions in federal funding, maintaining the\nintegrity of programs that focus on URM retention and recruitment is crucial. We present data on the mechanisms used\nto recruit URM students to our program (e.g., email, events, referrals, website), which individually were equally effective\nin attracting applicants to the program. Recruitment mechanisms were grouped and further classified relative to their cost\nto implement as lower and higher cost. Our results indicate that lower cost mechanisms, statistically, were as effective as\nhigher cost mechanisms in recruiting students who persisted to PhD programs. Using a binary logistic regression model to\npredict PhD matriculation, higher cost mechanisms were not significant predictors of PhD matriculation. Collectively, these\ndata demonstrate for the first time that lower cost mechanisms can be as successful in recruiting URM students to summer\nprograms who pursue PhDs in STEM fields.\n",

However, STEM fields also\nindicate the social ills that remain in U.S. society. Racial,\nethnic, and gender disparities in STEM education and degree\nattainment have been documented for nearly 40 years and are\nnot likely to disappear in the near future (George, Neale, Van\nHorne, & Malcom, 2001; National Academy of Sciences,\n2010). According to data from the National Science\nminorities (URMs), although representing 32% of the U.S.\npopulation, comprise only small percentages of bachelor's\ndegrees earned in science and engineering fields (U.S.\nCensus Bureau, 2015). Specifically, Hispanics (all races)\ncomprise 9%, Blacks/African Americans 9%, and American\nIndian/Native Americans less than 1%. With regard to doc-\ntoral degrees, only 11% are earned by URM and if behav-\nioral and social sciences are ignored, this drops to a striking\n9%. This disparity in degree attainment directly translates to\na non-diverse STEM workforce of nearly five million, with\none study reporting that URM represent less than 9% of the\nworkforce and account for less than 8% of the doctorate-\nrequiring positions in STEM universities and 4-year institu-\ntions (Poirier, Tanebaum, Storey, Kirshstein, & Rodriguez,\nabout 13% of the STEM workforce at the bachelor's degree\nand higher, while less than 6% hold full professorships across\nall U.S. universities.\nTo address this education and workforce gap, many pro-\ngrams have been established to enhance recruitment and\nretention of URM in STEM, with agencies such as the\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH), the NSF, and other\ngovernment agencies serving as large benefactors.

They have demonstrated that research participation is\na key element to career intentions and decisions and that\nimprovement in curriculum aids in retention of STEM\nmajors. Whether solely dedicated to URM or a commitment\nto URM, the focus of such programs is improvement in\ndiversity in STEM.\nIn order for the United States to maintain its competitive\neconomy and world standing in technology and innovation,\nthe federal government and others have been implored to tar-\nget URM as an \"untapped\" resource (George et al., 2001;\nNational Academy of Sciences, 2007; Palmer, Maramba, &\nin federal funding in recent years have affected these diver-\nsity efforts that have been ongoing for several decades. The\neffects of sequestration reduced the budgets of NSF and the\nNIH by 5%, and have just rebounded, with NIH receiving its\nhighest increase in 12 years in the new Bipartisan BudgetAct\nincrease, funding for diversity research programs represents\na mere fraction of the budgets for NIH and NSF. Institutional\nand individual training grants, research centers at minority\ninstitutions, and minority biomedical research support,\nwhich are the likely NIH funding mechanism for diversity\nresearch programs, collectively represent 3% of the 2016\nNIH budget, which includes programs not directed to diver-\nsity (NIH Office of Budget, 2015). For NSF, the education\nactivities are not solely focused on diversity (NSF, 2015).\nThis paucity of funding presents a challenge to staff and pro-\ngram directors of diversity research programs. One area of\nspecific challenge is student recruitment. Federally funded\nprograms (e.g., NIH Education Projects [R25s]) provide lim-\nited resources for student recruitment and in some cases are\nnot allowed, resulting in the need for program directors to\nfind other resources for recruitment (e.g., university sup-\nport). For programs where recruitment strategies are vital,\nsuch as summer research experiences, developing and utiliz-\ning efficient recruitment strategies may be necessary to sus-\ntain the quality and impact of these programs.\nLiterature Review\nResearch opportunities for undergraduates, including sum-\nmer research programs, have shown positive effects on\nretaining students in STEM (Barlow & Villarejo, 2004;\nPender, Marcotte, Sto Domingo, & Maton, 2010; Slovacek,\nWhittinghill, Flenoury, & Wiseman, 2012). The benefits of\nundergraduate research to all students are well known and\ninclude higher interest in science, developing identity as a sci-\nentist, improved self-confidence, research and professional\nskill development, confirmation of career path, and learning\ngains in the research process, lab techniques, and scientific\nproblem solving (Junge, Quinones, Kakietek, Teodarescu, &\nHunter, Laursen, & Deantoni, 2004). Programs directed to\nURM have shown a great impact on career trajectories, col-\nlege persistence, undergraduate grade point average (GPA),\nand earning a biology degree (Matsui, Liu, & Kane, 2003;\nNagda, Gregerman, Jonides, von Hippel, & Lerner, 1998;\nVillarejo, Barlow, Kogan, Veazey, & Sweeney, 2008). Other\nprograms, including the well-known Meyerhoff Scholars\nProgram, have been shown to add to the scientific workforce\nby producing URM who persist to PhDs in STEM (Maton,\nSto Domingo, Stolle-McAllister, Zimmerman, & Hrabowski,\n2009). One common strand for these studies is evaluation and\na rigorous analysis of the effect of the programs on the afore-\nmentioned outcomes, representing a cadre of literature that\nfurther validates the necessity of undergraduate research.\nFurthermore, these studies are a mixture of summer and aca-\ndemic programs for which some extensive recruitment mech-\nanisms may not have been necessary. While recruitment is\nmentioned in some of these studies, limited data are presented\nregarding how students were recruited to these programs.\nInvestigations on the correlation of recruitment methods to\nparticipant outcomes are lacking in the literature.\nRecruitment is a key component for summer research pro-\ngrams, especially for programs directed to target popula-\ntions, where access to such populations may be limited\nlocally. When the focus is narrowed to summer programs,\nthere are few data reported on recruitment mechanisms. Data\nfrom the \"Spend a Summer With a Scientist\" program,\ndirected to minority students, showed that 62% of the sum-\nmer students who were surveyed entered graduate school,\nbut there was no mention of how students were recruited\n(Alexander, Foertsch, & Daffinrud, 1998; Alexander,\nFoertsch, Daffinrud, & Tapia, 2000). Similarly, an evaluation\nof the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE)\nprogram at Emory University reports successful outcomes\nsuch as increased GPA and number of science courses taken\npostparticipation, but the only data related to recruitment\nshowed that over 20% of students were from liberal arts\ncolleges and that 75% of non-Emory students were from\nout of state (Junge et al., 2010). In a study of the Research\nExperiences for Undergraduates (REUs) program sponsored\nby the NSF, principal investigators across 106 REU sites\nwere asked to report measures of success of the participants,\nwhich included graduate school attendance, participant co-\nauthorship, and participant satisfaction (Beninson, Koski,\nVilla, Faram, & O'Connor, 2011). The mechanisms used to\nrecruit were Internet (email, website), mailings, media, con-\nferences, campus recruitment office, and other methods, with\nthe majority of participants recruited by Internet or confer-\nences. Although graduate school attendance was a marker of\nsuccess, the study did not indicate the number or percentage\nof students in graduate school, thus any link of outcome to\nShadding et al. 3\nrecruitment mechanism could not be assessed. An evaluation\nreport of the programs funded by the Biological Sciences\nDirectorate of NSF (BIO REUs) indicates gains by partici-\npants in research skills and thinking like a scientist, with over\n50% intending to pursue a PhD in a STEM field. The recruit-\nment mechanisms utilized were announcements, the NSF\nwebsite, academic advisors, and web searches. An updated\nreport from this group discussed the types of institutions of\nparticipants: over 70% from Research I and over 84% from\npublic universities, but neither institution type nor mecha-\nnism type was linked to outcomes or other variables ana-\nevaluation of a summer research program targeted at URM\nacross 15 R1 institutions within a Midwest consortium\nshowed that 75% of participants went on to graduate or pro-\nfessional school, where these students were a mixture of\nmajors (e.g., humanities, engineering, natural, and physical\nsciences; Foertsch, Alexander, & Penberthy, 1997). Students\nwere recruited to the program from \"on campus\" or \"off\ncampus\" of the host institution. The \"off campus\" mecha-\nnisms included partnerships with minority-serving institu-\ntions (MSIs), which represented 9% of the participants.\nTheir data showed that participants who were STEM majors\nwere more likely to attend graduate school and to be\nrecruited from \"off campus\"\u00adresearch extensive schools. No\nfurther classifications of recruitment methods were men-\ntioned in the report.\nFrom these studies, it is evident that resources have been\ndevoted to increasing the pool of URM who will diversify\nthe STEM workforce. However, little has been reported in\nthe literature on how students were recruited. Missing in the\nliterature is a practical focus on recruitment of URM stu-\ndents, especially to summer programs. To our knowledge,\nthe literature to date has not demonstrated the success of\nrecruitment in attracting students who eventually enroll in\nPhD programs and other STEM-related degree programs.\nAs federal agencies provide limited funds for recruitment\nto diversity research programs, it is imperative for pro-\ngrams to enhance cost-effectiveness to continue the strides\nmade in diversity.\nUsing data from our summer program targeted at URM,\nOpportunities in Genomics Research (OGR): Undergraduate\nScholars, we show the outcomes of the participants and the\nrecruitment mechanisms used to attract students to the pro-\ngram. We demonstrate empirically, we believe for the first\ntime, the effectiveness of low-cost strategies in attracting\nstudents who are on the path to high impact terminal degrees\nin STEM, namely, STEM doctorates, to a summer program.\nMethod\nResearch Questions\nResearch Question 1: Are low-cost recruitment strategies\neffective in recruiting students to the OGR program?\nResearch Question 2:Are low-cost strategies effective in\nrecruiting students who persist to PhDs in STEM?\nProgram Design and Components\nThe OGR Program was established in 2007 atThe McDonnell\nGenome Institute at Washington University in St. Louis. This\nprogram is a part of the Diversity Action Plan (DAP), an ini-\ntiative by the National Human Genome Research Institute\n(NHGRI), to increase diversity in the field of genomics and\nrelated fields. The goal of the DAP programs is to increase\nthe number of PhDs in the field from underrepresented back-\ngrounds. The DAP programs initially defined URMs as\nAfrican American, Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific\nIslander. Since 2011, it has expanded the definition to include\nfirst-generation college attendees, socioeconomically/cultur-\nally disadvantaged, and persons with learning and physical\ndisabilities.\nHere we report on the summer research program of OGR:\nUndergraduate Scholars. Undergraduate Scholars is an\n8-week summer program where students conduct research\nwith Washington University faculty whose research focus is\nconcentrated on or related to genetics or genomics. The pro-\ngram consists of activities to encourage careers in research\nand to help prepare students for graduate school and its\napplication process. Such activities include graduate school\npreparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE) prepara-\ntion, seminars, journal clubs, scientific presentation skills,\nand career planning. The foci of this article are the recruit-\nment mechanisms and potential links to outcomes, rather\nthan the program features.\nParticipants\nWe report on 185 applicants to the OGR program from\ntheir application and phone interviews conducted by pro-\ngram staff. Factors influencing acceptance into OGR\nincluded recommendations by the mentors, GPA (overall\nand STEM), undergraduate major, research interests and\nexperience (for upperclassmen), interest in a PhD or\nresearch career as indicated in a personal statement and\ninterview, and classification at time of application. Eligible\nstudents were freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or first\nsemester seniors (students scheduled to graduate the winter\nfollowing the summer program).\nWe note we did not use a hard-line GPA in our selection\nprocess although great consideration was given to GPAs\n3.3 and above. Using the NSF definition of STEM (sci-\nence and engineering), 100% of participants (n = 59) were\nSTEM majors upon entry to OGR, including two behav-\nioral science majors. Of the program alumni (n = 55),\n4 SAGE Open\nData Collection\nThe baseline data were extracted from applications to the\nprogram and internally stored in Microsoft Excel. OGR stu-\ndents'long-term career outcomes, including career path data,\nwere collected from participants and stored in iBioSketch.\ncom, an Internet-based career tracking tool designed by\nStrategic Evaluations, Inc., our external evaluation team.\nThese career outcomes were verified through at least two\nother sources, including (a) study leaders' follow-up com-\nmunication with alumni and their research mentors and (b)\nqueries submitted to the National Students Clearinghouse.\nMatriculants were asked to initiate and update their profiles\nin iBiosketch annually, while formal surveys were given\nannually to biannually. We supplemented this information\nwith informal tracking methods (phone calls, social media,\nemails, etc.). The reported outcome data indicate where stu-\ndents were in their career to our knowledge as of September\n2014 or the last reporting of the student (e.g., PhD program,\nworking in STEM field, etc.)\nAll data are reported in aggregate. Demographic informa-\ntion such as gender, race, and ethnicity were voluntary and\nself-reported on the OGR application. Required information\nincluded name of institutions, overall, and STEM GPA (veri-\nfied by transcript). Institutions were classified as an MSI\nbased on data from the Department of Education listings of\nminority institutions and Excelencia in Education (2014,\nEdexcelencia.org). The following categories for MSIs were\nused: Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs),\nHispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and other MSIs (Tribal\nColleges and Universities, Primarily Black Institutions,\nNative American\u00adServing Non-Tribal Institutions, Asian\nAmerican, and Native American Pacific Islander\u00adServing\nInstitutions), or non-MSIs (majority institutions or primarily\nWhite institutions). Institutions were further categorized\nusing basic Carnegie Classification (Carnegie Foundation\nfor the Advancement of Teaching, 2012) and condensed into\nthe following major categories: associates (includes private\nand public), bachelor's (includes baccalaureate arts and sci-\nence, diverse, and baccalaureate/associates), master's (small,\nmedium, and large), doctoral (doctoral/research universi-\nties), and research (research university with high or very\nhigh activity).\nRecruitment Mechanisms\nThe main goal of this study was to investigate a link between\nrecruitment methods and student outcomes, particularly\nlow-cost recruitment methods. We have actively recruited\nfor the OGR program and documented the mechanism of\nstudent recruitment. We provided several closed-ended\noptions for applicants to indicate on the OGR application,\n\"how they heard about the program,\" which included\ninstructor, program, email, conference, career fair, brochure/\nflyer, website, word of mouth, former OGR student, and\nother; applicants were asked to indicate details (e.g., confer-\nence name). These options were condensed into five main\nmechanisms: emails, referrals, events, websites, and other.\nA brief description of each method is found in Table 1. A\nrecruitment database was maintained and included all indi-\nviduals and institutions we contacted through emails, events,\nand mailings. A mechanism was indicated for an applicant\nas the likely initial mode of contact. For example, if a stu-\ndent listed instructor on his or her application, and it was\nnoted in our recruitment database that several emails were\nsent to that applicant's institution, then email was listed as\nthe recruitment mechanism. If an applicant's choice of\nrecruitment mechanism could not be verified in our records,\nthe strategy was listed as indicated by the applicant or, if no\nstrategy could be verified, the mechanism was designated as\n\"other\" (see Table 1). The responses for each mechanism\nwere tallied and the mechanisms assessed against demo-\ngraphics, GPA, institution types, and outcomes.\nStatistical Analysis\nIBM SPSS Statistics Version 21 was used to compute\ndescriptive statistics, as well as test for correlations and sta-\ntistical significance. Independent-samples chi-square tests\nwere used to test the distributions for categorical response\nvariables, including differences between demographic vari-\nables, recruitment mechanisms, and career outcomes. When\nappropriate, the crosstab function within SPSS was used to\nhelp determine whether column proportions were signifi-\ncantly different. In these cases, z values were computed and\np values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the\nBonferroni method. To determine whether the means for\nour scale variables (overall GPAs and STEM GPAs) were\nequal across our independent categories, one-way ANOVAs\nwere conducted. Matriculation status and recruitment\nmechanism were the independent variables, while GPA and\nSTEM GPA were the dependent variables. Finally, vari-\nables in the data set were examined using a logistic regres-\nsion to determine which most likely explained students'\ncareer outcomes. The eligible variables for consideration in\nthe model were GPA, ethnicity, race, NSF quartile of fund-\ning, NIH quartile of funding, MSI classification, Carnegie\nclassification, cost of recruitment mechanism, level of per-\nsonal contact, and type of recruitment mechanism. Using\nthis technique, five explanatory/predictor variables and one\nresponse variable (career outcome) were chosen for the\nlogistic regression model. The dependent variable was\ndefined as the degree pursuit of the former scholars of the\nprogram coded with dummy value: 1 = scholars who chose\nto pursue a PhD or 0 = scholars who did not pursue a PhD.\nPredictor variables used were coded as gender (1 = female,\n0 = male), ethnicity (1 = Hispanic, 0 = non-Hispanic),\nCarnegie classification (1 = high or very high research\nactivity, 0 = non-research classified institutions), recruit-\nment mechanism (1 = high-cost events and website,\nShadding et al. 5\n0 = low-cost email and referrals). The median and mean\nGPA were calculated to both be 3.5. Therefore, scholars\nwith GPAs of 3.5 or higher were coded as 1, while those\nwith GPAs lower than 3.5 were coded as 0. The logistic\nregression model had a Nagelkerke R2 value of .291, sug-\ngesting that nearly 30% of the variability in what predicted\nstudents pursuing PhDs was accounted for in this model.\nResults\nOGR Demographics\nThe OGR programs are directed to increasing the number\nof underrepresented students who pursue PhDs in genomics\nand related fields. Over the 7-year reporting period, this\nstudy demonstrates that the program expanded its reach to\nhelp accomplish this goal. In the first three tables, non-\nmatriculant applicants (n = 126) are compared with matric-\nulant applicants (n = 59), where a matriculant is defined as\nan applicant who was accepted and participated in the\nprogram.\nMales and females were recruited to the program at rates\nHowever, the number and percentage of females in both the\nn = 32) trended higher than that of males. The percentage of\nfemales was nearly double that of males in the non-matricu-\nlant pool but was only 8% higher in the matriculant pool\n(Table 2). This may be reflective of gains made by women in\nundergraduate and graduate programs in certain sectors of\nSTEM, namely, biological sciences, where females earn 60%\nof bachelor's and 56% of doctorates in this area but 51% of\nbachelor's and 46% of doctorates in STEM overall (Burrelli,\ntrend where minority males lag behind their female counter-\nparts in certain areas of STEM, where Black and Hispanic\n46% of STEM doctorates, respectively (Aud, Fox, &\norous analysis would be needed to make this determination.\nIn light of this potential disparity, our recruiting reflects an\neffort to increase male matriculants. In 2007, we only had\none male student in our program, constituting 13% of pro-\ngram participants in that year. Over time, males represented\na higher percentage of the matriculants, peaking at 75% in\nOn the OGR applications, information on ethnicity and\nrace was requested. Using the census classification for eth-\nnicity and race, the number and percentage of Hispanics and\nnon-Hispanics (all races) and the number and percentage of\nracial groups (including Hispanic ethnicity) are reported\n(Table 2). Using federal classifications, persons choose an\nethnicity and a race; thus, a person who self-identifies as\nHispanic (ethnicity) may also identify as Caucasian (race).\nComparing non-matriculants and matriculants, Hispanics\nwere selected at a higher rate than non-Hispanics for matric-\nulation in the program. Forty-four percent of the matriculants\nidentified as Hispanic; however, they only constituted 31%\nnon-matriculants and 49% of matriculants. As Hispanics are\nincluded in the race category as well, they are reflected in\nsome of the racial groups. However, the majority of Hispanic\napplicants chose \"no response\" to race on the application, n\n= 44. Caucasians represented a small portion of the applicant\nmatriculants identifying as Caucasian were non-Hispanic\nTable 1. Description of OGR Recruitment Mechanisms.\nMechanism Description\nEmails Recruitment emails and electronic flyers with program information were sent to chairs of STEM departments at\nMSIs, institutions ranked by periodicals as top producers of URM graduates in STEM (e.g., Diverse issues of Higher\neducation, Hispanic outlook, Winds of Change), and program directors of MARC-USTAR, MBRS-RISE, and LSAMP\nReferrals Word of mouth by colleagues of program staff, other faculty, and OGR students; shared applications from other DAP\nprograms and other on-campus summer programs\nEvents Program staff attended large URM student focused conferences (e.g., ABRCMS, SACNAS) and smaller internship and\ncampus career fairs at MSIs and visited individual classes and program meetings at MSIs and non-MSIs.\nWebsites Includes the OGR webpage and other websites across the country. The URL for the OGR website was included on all\nOGR media (flyers, ink pens, emails, etc.); the URL was posted on the career/internship/program websites at various\ninstitutions and appeared on national webpages (e.g., Institute for Broadening Participation and NHGRI)\nOther Ads and fliers were generated and mailed to institutions (all types) within the Missouri/Illinois area and to some MSIs\nthat border these states.

Initially,\nrecruitment efforts were limited but have diversified over the\nyears of the program. Since its inception, the number of\napplicants to the program increased over 300% at its peak in\nto 25% due to fewer available slots. The OGR program par-\nticipants included previous students in good standing who\nre-entered the program non-competitively (Figure 1), how-\never, these students are only counted once in the total number\nof applications, so each year reflects unique applicants only\n(solid line--Figure 1).\nTo better assess demographics and the selectivity of OGR,\ninstitutional data were extracted from the applications.\nInstitutions were classified as MSI using data from the U.S.\nDepartment of Education minority institutions programs and\nExcelencia in Education. The major classifications utilized\nfor MSIs were HBCU, HSI, other MSI, or non-MSI (Table\n3). For non-matriculants, 50% had attended an MSI, and 26%\nhad attended an HBCU. Among matriculants, over 60%\nattended an MSI where HBCUs and HSIs were nearly equal\nat 31% and 32%, respectively; these differences were not sig-\nnificant. In addition, Carnegie classifications for matriculants\nand non-matriculants were compared and condensed into\nthe following categories: associates, baccalaureate, master's,\nTable 2.

Research universities provided the\nlargest number of applicants, both matriculants (44%) and\nnon-matriculants (39%; Table 3). Baccalaureate and master's\ninstitutions supplied the next largest group of non-matricu-\nrespectively. Overall, there was no difference in matriculants\ncompared with non-matriculants when considering Carnegie\nclassification. Regional data for the institutions using U.S.\nregions as classified by U.S. Census Bureau were collected.\nThe largest percentage of schools for both matriculants (53%)\nand non-matriculants (38%) were located in the South, which\ncorresponds to the location of a considerable number of\nMSIs (data not shown)\nShadding et al. 7\nThe selectivity of the program is further demonstrated by\nthe GPA data. To determine whether there was a difference in\nGPA within different phases of the application process, we\nanalyzed GPAs of all applicants, those invited to interview,\noffers made, and matriculants. We found no significant dif-\nference in overall or STEM GPA among applicants within\nthe different phases (data not shown). Therefore, GPA vari-\nables were not distinguishing factors between students at dif-\nferent phases of the application process.\nRecruitment Mechanisms\nSuggested best practices to recruit and retain URM in STEM\ninclude strategies such as improving K-12 education, part-\nnerships with MSIs and secondary schools, establishing\nmentorship programs, discipline-specific short courses, and\nso on (NHGRI, 2006; Organization for Tropical Studies,\n2007). Little attention has been paid to the practical aspect of\nrecruitment, which may become more important for feder-\nally funded programs given the decreases recently experi-\nenced in funding.\nTable 4 shows recruitment mechanisms for non-matricu-\nlants and matriculants to the OGR program from 2007 to\n2013. For both groups, the largest percentage of students was\nrecruited via email and referrals; the number recruited from\nemails trended slightly higher for non-matriculants and refer-\nrals for matriculants. Collectively, the two strategies of refer-\nrals and emails accounted for nearly 70% of students who\nultimately were selected for the program. However, when\ntested statistically, all recruitment strategies proved to be\nequally effective in drawing students to the program. The\nlack of significant difference also indicates that no specific\nmechanism was favored in the selection of students. These\ndata provide some confidence that the methods were varied\nand provide a platform to effectively compare them for\noutcomes.\nIn this study, with the exception of ethnicity and race,\nthere was no significant difference in non-matriculants ver-\nsus matriculants in other demographics, institution classifi-\ncation, GPA, and recruitment mechanism. Next, data were\nTable 4. Recruitment Mechanisms for OGR Applicants\nDisaggregated by Matriculation Status.\nRecruitment\nmechanism\nNon-matriculants\nMatriculants\nN Percent N Percent\nNote.

Crosstabs of demo-\ngraphic variables and recruitment mechanisms show that\nthere were notable gender differences. Males were more\nlikely to apply to the OGR program as a result of a referral\n(44%) or through website advertisement (16%). Conversely,\nfemales were more likely to apply to the OGR program as a\nresult of email solicitations (40%) or by hearing about the\nOGR program at an event (30%). Therefore, there may be\ngender differences in how applicants were attracted to the\nprogram.\nWhile there was no significant difference across any of\nthe mechanisms when comparing ethnicity, the effectiveness\nof recruitment mechanisms varied significantly for the dif-\nferent racial groups. Applicants identifying as Black/African\nAmerican were most likely drawn to OGR by interacting\nwith our program at an event (31%). Website advertisements\nwere the most effective mechanisms for attracting applicants\nidentifying as Asian, where 33% applied through this mecha-\nnism, more than any other racial group. Email solicitations\nattracted a significantly high proportion of applications from\nstudents identifying as Caucasian (50%).\nOur recruitment mechanisms, emails, events, referrals,\nwebsite, and other, experienced varying levels of success\ndependent upon the type of institution (Table 6).

The recruitment mechanisms were equally as\neffective across the different Carnegie classifications\nalthough emails or referrals were the mechanisms that\nattracted the largest percentage of applicants from each insti-\ntution type.\nWe also tested whether any mechanism was responsible\nfor attracting applicants with more selective overall or STEM\nGPAs. While the overall and STEM GPA for applicants\nrecruited through the website mechanism trended higher\nthan the GPA data for applicants recruited through other\nmechanisms, there was no statistical difference indicating\nthat no given strategy was more effective in attracting a stu-\ndent with a high GPA (data not shown).\nOutcomes\nThe recruitment mechanisms utilized in this study are rela-\ntively common and accessible for similar programs. The goal\nof this study was to demonstrate, for the first time, the effec-\ntiveness of these methods in recruiting students who prog-\nress to desired program outcomes.\nTable 7 lists the outcomes of the students in the OGR pro-\nbaccalaureate degree are included in the table (55 students).\nProgram outcome data reveal that 27% of students entered\nPhD programs (includes MD/PhD, n = 1) while 16% transi-\ntioned to professional degree programs in STEM areas (MD,\nDDS, and PharmD). An additional 11% enrolled in a post-\nbaccalaureate training or master's degree programs follow-\ning their undergraduate studies. Collectively, 54% of students\nacross the 7 years transitioned to advanced training in STEM\nfields. It is important to note that the \"outcomes\" used in this\nanalysis were accurate as of September 2014; students may\nhave progressed to a higher level of training since this report.\nThese data are a snapshot of where students were at the time\nour team analyzed the data for the article and does not cap-\nture each career step made by the participant since complet-\ning OGR.\nAn analysis of demographic variables in relation to career\noutcomes shows that there were no statistical differences for\nthe gender variable. Fifty-three percent of the students\nenrolled in PhD programs were male, while 67% of students\nenrolled in STEM professional degree programs were female\n(Table 8).\nHispanics showed a strong trend in transitioning to PhD\nprograms (67%) versus just 33% of non-Hispanics. However,\n.170). No statistical differences were seen among career out-\ncomes and race. While Black/African American students\naccounted for more than 50% of students transitioning to\nSTEM professional degree programs and postbaccalaureate/\nmaster's programs, these students accounted for only 26% of\nthose transitioning to PhD programs.\nStudents who attended institutions categorized by\nCarnegie as research high/very high were more likely to\nenroll in a PhD program than to pursue other career paths\n(Table 9). Seventy-three percent of students who enrolled in\nPhD programs were trained at these institutions, a higher\npercentage than any other Carnegie classification. There\nwere no additional differences found by analyzing Carnegie\ntype versus career outcomes.\nIt is interesting to note that 40% of students trained at\nHSIs went on to pursue a PhD, outpacing their HBCU coun-\nterparts nearly threefold. However, the difference in PhD\nenrollment rates between HSIs and HBCUs were not signifi-\nWhen comparing outcomes versus the mechanism of\nrecruitment, the majority of students who transitioned to\nPhD programs were recruited by events (40%), while the\nmajority of students who transitioned to STEM professional\ndegree programs were recruited by referrals (55.6%; Table\n10). However, there were no statistically significant differ-\nences in the individual recruitment mechanisms that drew\nstudents to the program and their ultimate career outcomes,\nShadding et al. 9\nTable 8.

Lower cost mechanisms = emails and referrals; higher cost mechanisms = websites and events.\nThe gradations of color represent the relative increase in cost of the mechanism. Percentages are the students who pursued a PhD or a\nSTEM professional degree (MD, DDS, or PharmD).\nsuggesting that no single mechanism was statistically more\nlikely to yield students enrolling in advanced degree pro-\neffect size, recruitment mechanism only accounted for 6% of\nthe total variability in the career outcomes.\nThis study aimed to determine the effectiveness of low-\ncost recruitment strategies in attracting students who later\nenroll in PhD programs. To further explore these mecha-\nnisms and their outcomes, strategies were grouped by rela-\ntive cost: lower cost and higher cost. Figure 2 shows a\nrelative cost spectrum of the recruitment mechanisms we\nused. Emails and referrals were of little cost in dollars to the\nOGR program to execute as a mechanism; thus, we com-\nbined these to form the lower cost category. However, web-\nsites and events are higher cost strategies. Website here\nincludes our website as well as other websites across the\ncountry where we advertised (e.g., schools, government).\nAlthough we advertised for free on external sites, generally\nspeaking websites can be costly to create and to maintain,\nwhere a basic site can be free or cost several thousand dollars\nand more elaborate sites can be as high as tens of thousands\n(Katkin, 2015). Events can be costly for small programs,\nwhereas for our program, they have been primarily confer-\nper conference. In Figure 2, we used the two-directional\narrow for events and websites to indicate that one may cost\nmore than the other, but both are more costly than emails or\nreferrals for our program.\nLower cost mechanisms were highly effective in attract-\ning students who eventually matriculated into terminal\ndegree programs. Over 50% of OGR alumni who pursued\nPhD programs were recruited by lower cost mechanisms\ncompared with 40% of PhD pursuants recruited by higher\ncost mechanisms. All of the students in our program who\npursued STEM professional degrees were recruited by lower\ncost mechanisms (Figure 2). Thus, in our small sample,\nlower cost mechanisms are statistically as effective as higher\ncost mechanisms in recruiting students who transition to\neffect size, cost of recruitment only accounted for 2% of the\ntotal variability among those pursuing PhDs.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this study shows for the first time the\ncost-effectiveness of recruitment strategies in attracting\nURM participants to a diversity research summer program\nwho progress to desired outcomes. Few studies have men-\ntioned recruitment mechanisms for summer programs, and\nonly one has indicated the outcome of students who were\nrecruited by certain mechanisms (on- vs. off-campus;\nFoertsch et al., 1997). Overall, the literature contains little\nthat shows the results of students who were recruited by spe-\ncific strategies. The findings of this study provide a tool for\nleaders of diversity research programs to evaluate their cur-\nrent recruitment methods and to incorporate new ones. While\nwe do not owe the outcomes of the participants to these\nrecruitment mechanisms, we do believe this study indicates\nto program directors that lower cost strategies can be utilized\neffectively to attract students who are on the path to graduate\nand professional degrees.\nOGR, like other diversity research programs, is devoted\nto the success of URM in STEM, where students build their\nskills and are provided with the opportunity to gain research\nexperience and prepare for graduate studies. This study dem-\nonstrates a selective, competitive, gender-balanced, URM-\ncentered program, where students were recruited from\ndiverse institutions using a host of mechanisms. The recruit-\nment mechanisms that are the focus of this article are quite\ncommon and available for all programs. We have demon-\nstrated how these mechanisms can be assessed to trace their\neffectiveness to participant outcomes. The five mechanisms\nof recruitment, email, referrals, event, websites, and other,\nwere not statistically different among non-matriculants and\nmatriculants as single mechanisms. However, a number of\nstatistical differences were evident when we compared the\nmechanisms and the demographics of the applicants. We\nnote a gender difference in how males and females were\nrecruited to apply to the OGR program. For females, email\nand events were the most effective and for males, referrals\nand websites were most effective. As demonstrated in\nTable 5, each gender was drawn to the program by one low-\ncost and one high-cost mechanism. These mechanisms can\nbe further classified as high contact (e.g., referrals, events)\nand low contact (e.g., email, website), which indicates the\nlevel of personalization the mechanisms required. For\ninstance, referrals and events required in-person contact or\nsome prior relationships established by the program staff\nwith individual applicants or faculty/administrators at a par-\nticular institution, whereas email and websites did not require\nthis personalization or level of contact. Similarly, males and\nfemales were attracted to the program by one low-contact\nand one high-contact mechanism; whereas the high-contact\nmechanism was most important for males, a low-contact\nmechanism attracted the most females. It would be tempting\nto speculate that because of the data noted earlier regarding\nthe low number of minority males compared with their\nfemale counterparts, using a high-contact mechanism such as\nreferral may indicate that some advocacy may have played a\nrole on behalf of the referee. More data are needed to make\ninferences about why this gender difference exists, but it can\nbe assumed that a diverse set of methods is essential to ensure\ngender balance in the program.\nWhen comparing race for specific mechanisms, differ-\nences were noted. Email was most effective for Caucasians,\nwebsite for Asians, and events for Blacks. These strategies\nare a mix of high and low cost, but high contact was signifi-\ncant for a portion of the target URM groups, corresponding\nwith data showing events were significant for recruiting stu-\ndents who attended HBCUs. This may verify what is assumed\nanecdotally when recruiting URM, namely, Blacks/African\nAmericans in this case, that recruiters must search and go\nwhere these students are to diversify their programs. This\nmay certainly be true for Black females, who have been\nnoted to select graduate schools based on relationships and\nenvironments that appear to be more supportive (Upton &\nOutcome data indicate that overall the OGR program was\nsuccessful: Over 50% of alumni were involved in advanced\ntraining in STEM, including 27% enrolled in PhD or MD/\nPhD programs. In light of this, our data do highlight some\ninteresting points regarding race and ethnicity. Although the\npercentage of Hispanics and non-Hispanics only differed by\n10% in our matriculant pool favoring non-Hispanics, the per-\ncentage of Hispanics who matriculated to the PhD was twice\nthat of non-Hispanics (67% vs. 33%). The largest group of\nTable 11.

Nagelkerke R2 = .291. CI = confidence interval; GPA = grade point\naverage.\nnon-Hispanics was Blacks, who earned slightly more than\nhalf of STEM professional degrees. This would suggest that\nethnicity and race even within URM might play a role in\nmatriculation to terminal degrees in STEM. Nationally, both\ngroups are underrepresented in the health professions (e.g.,\nmedicine and dentistry), and according to the American\nAssociation of Medical Colleges (AAMC; 2014) and the\nAmerican Dental Association, Blacks and Hispanics make\nup 9% and 8%, respectively, of working physicians and den-\ntists (Wyckoff, 2010). This is similar to the number reported\nby Poirier et al. (2009) for STEM PhDs. Additional data\nindicate that, nationally, Hispanic college enrollment has\nincreased and now outnumbers the enrollment of Blacks in\nbaccalaureate and doctoral degree attainment in STEM.\nTherefore, this study may be reflective of this national trend\nIn this study, we asked what variables were important for\nunderrepresented students in our study to pursue a PhD. We\nwanted to determine whether the type of recruitment mecha-\nnism and the relative cost played a role along with other vari-\nables. Using a binary logistic regression analysis, the\nvariables that were strong predictors of students who chose\nto enroll in PhD programs following their undergraduate\ntraining were determined. The following five variables\nemerged as reliably distinguishing between PhD pursuants\nand non-PhD pursuants: Carnegie classification, gender, eth-\nnicity, GPA, and relative cost of recruitment mechanism\nTable 11). Of these five variables, Carnegie classification\nwas the variable that proved to be the strongest positive pre-\ndictor (p = .028), where students attending research universi-\nties with high or very high research activity were 5 times\nmore likely to enroll in PhD programs versus those not\nenrolled in this type of university. While high-cost recruit-\nment mechanisms (events and website) were positive predic-\ntors of students pursuing PhDs, they were not statistically\nsignificant positive predictors (p = .11). Although our data\nset is quite small, our model corresponds with national data\nindicating that, overall, most PhD recipients hail from bac-\ncalaureate institutions that are research intensive (Fiegener\n& Proudfoot, 2013). The majority of our PhD pursuants in\nour sample were Hispanics and, of the HSIs in our data that\nproduced PhD pursuants, 83% were research universities\nwith high or very high activity. However, for Black students\nfrom HBCUs who pursued PhDs, their schools were not\nclassified as research universities and the same for those pur-\nsuing STEM professional degrees, which may also account\nfor our model results, where HBCUs regardless of research\nintensity have been noted to play a major role in Blacks pur-\nsuing PhDs (Bonner, Alfred, Lewis, Nave, & Frizell, 2009).\nWith this correspondence to national data, we believe that a\nmore robust examination of the relative cost of recruitment\nmechanism may provide us with clearer evidence of its con-\ntribution to the pursuit of the PhD pathway.\nLimitations and Implications for Future Studies\nThere are several limitations to this study. As indicated\nabove, one limitation is the sample size and the focus on one\nprogram, which may have prevented statistical significance\nin some of our data as well as determining the level of con-\ntribution of factors to the PhD path within our model. In\nexamining our recruitment mechanisms, we disaggregated\ndata from an already small sample size; thus, our data are\nsuggestive rather than conclusive, regarding the effective-\nness of our mechanisms. Also, this study lacks outcome data\nfor non-matriculants, which would provide definition to our\nrecruitment mechanisms and their association with out-\ncomes. As our program is ongoing, we continue to collect\nthese data, which may increase our sample size for future\nstudies. We can examine other programs with similar foci\ncontrolling for variation in program design to validate our\nfindings. We believe that our data provide a skeleton for a\nlarger study to examine recruitment mechanisms in detail for\nsummer research programs that can also be translated to\nother programs (e.g., graduate programs, postbaccalaureate\nprograms).\nThese data should not be considered in isolation. We\nacknowledge that there are many factors involved in the path\nto the PhD for all students and those in our programs. In no\nway are we suggesting that our mechanisms are responsible\nfor students pursuing STEM doctorates or professional\ndegrees. Factors such as the quality of the research experi-\nences during the OGR program, prior- and post-OGR\nresearch experience, and quality of their application to PhD\nprograms are just among the few factors responsible for\nentry into graduate and professional programs, which we did\nnot consider here, but may be interesting to add to a more\ncomprehensive study. In speaking of recruitment only, how-\never, it might be interesting to note the \"dosage\" of recruit-\nment and the relationship development to recruit a student\nand then look at the outcome. In other words, using the\nmechanisms we outlined, does the number of times an indi-\nvidual student was contacted prior to matriculation into a\nprogram matter to the outcome? Currently, the number of\ntimes individuals were contacted by our program, from ini-\ntial contact to application, is recorded, but the amount of\ncontact from application to matriculation is not captured, so\nthe focus of this study was the front-end recruitment.\nWe know that selection matters to the outcomes we\nobserved, whether it is self-selection by the student to apply\nto our program or selection of matriculants by program\nleadership. Our program sought students interested in\nresearch; thus, some students were on track to the PhD\nwhen they entered OGR. However, in our selection of par-\nticipants, GPA, prior research experience, and specific\ncoursework were not the major determinants of selection.\nWe certainly accepted students who were conducting\nresearch for the first time or deciding on a career path. A\nmore in-depth study is needed to determine the true effect\nof OGR on the outcomes.\nAnother limitation may be that we have not put into prac-\ntice newer and possibly more innovative methods of recruit-\nment (e.g., social media and virtual recruitment fairs) to\ndetermine if they are effective in bringing students to our\nprogram and in attracting students who pursue terminal\ndegrees in STEM. While we recently implemented webinars\nto provide information on OGR, the email mechanism was\nstill the initial mode of contact to attract participants to the\nwebinar.\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrates for the first time that cost-effective\nmeasures can be utilized to recruit students who will ulti-\nmately pursue PhDs or STEM professional degrees. We\nprovide evidence that establishing a system to implement\nlower cost mechanisms may be worth an investment of time\nfor individual programs, especially during fiscally lean\ntimes. Higher cost mechanisms, namely, conferences, are\nrecruitment staples and have great value, which according\nto our data, part of their value is in recruiting Blacks and\nstudents from HBCUs. But we also show the value of lower\ncost mechanisms, and we suggest that this value is that\nusing these mechanisms does not compromise program out-\ncomes, while conserving program dollars. We believe that\nlower cost recruitment mechanisms can be used to supple-\nment higher cost ones and should be given great consider-\nation in program recruitment plans. We also advocate that\nsummer programs designed to attract URM students thor-\noughly track the recruitment mechanisms and the outcomes\nby the mechanisms because this may be a key to improved\nefficiency.\nWe caution that our data must be viewed as a part of the\noverall experience for the student. As a whole, we are not\nsuggesting that our program is solely responsible for the\noutcomes, rather our program was a part of the students'\nexperiences and there were many factors that contributed\nto the outcomes, those within and outside of the OGR pro-\ngram goals. We also want to make clear that by recruiting\nstudents via certain mechanisms we are not guaranteeing a\nparticular outcome nor are we implying the mechanism is\nresponsible for the outcome. What we do suggest is that by\nassessing mechanisms comprehensively in light of small\nrecruitment budgets, cost-effective mechanisms may be\nutilized, and in our program, these mechanisms were suc-\ncessful in attracting URM students who pursued terminal\ndegrees in STEM.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This research was\nsupported by the National Human Genome Research Institute-\nReferences\nAlexander, B.
