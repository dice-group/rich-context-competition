Intertwined with these demo-\ngraphic changes is the epidemiological transition of\ndiseases, where the primary causes of disability, mor-\nbidity and mortality shift from communicable dis-\neases (CDs) to chronic non-communicable diseases\n(NCDs). Health systems in LMICs are\nfundamentally unprepared for tackling the chronic\ndisease challenges since they have been set up in a\nperiod when CDs were dominant.3 The increasing\nNCD burden puts older adults and elderly and their\nhouseholds at the risk of catastrophic health expen-\nditures and impoverishments. In LMICs,\nout-of-pocket payments for healthcare services are\npredominant, and existing formal social protection\nsystems cover only a small proportion of their\nageing population.4 Thus, people in LMICs arrive at\nold age in poorer shape and with fewer reserves.\nDuring the last decade, a large body of literature\nfocused on trends and determinants for the\nunequal distribution of healthy life years (HLYs)\nand the disability-free life expectancy (DFLE)\namong older people in several European countries\nand North America.5 6 The results consistently\nshow improvements in the overall quality of HLYs\nof older people in these high-income settings,\nthough inequalities in DFLE between population\nsubgroups remain. However, there is a paucity of\nevidence from studies on healthy ageing conducted\nin LMICs.7\u00ad12 A study based on the INDEPTH\nWHO-SAGE data revealed how different socio-\neconomic indicators such as education, marital\nstatus, living arrangement and household socio-\neconomic status influence health inequality\nobserved between men and women in eight coun-\ntries in Africa and Asia.7 Studies in Brazil and\nMexico link inequalities in DFLE to the prevalence\nDFLE between diabetics and non-diabetics exists.11\nAnother study from Brazil shows that women\nreceive more years of personal assistance but also\nexperience more unmet care needs compared with\nmen.9 A study in China showed evidence for a\ncompression of morbidity among people aged 65\nyounger age groups.12 Most of those studies,\nexcept the study by Ng et al,7 used different instru-\nments to measure disability at individual level. The\nheterogeneity in disability measurement limits the\navailability of cross-country comparative data.\nThe objectives of this study are to describe the\nlevels of and inequalities in LE, disability and\nDFLE between men and women across different\nage groups 50 years and over in six countries with\ndeveloping economies. We utilise data from the\nWHO Study on global AGEing and adult health\n(WHO-SAGE), which was collected using standar-\ndised instrument in six countries, representing four\ndifferent world regions. These countries are also at\ndifferent stages of the demographic, economic and\nepidemiological transition.\nResearch report\nCopyright Article author (or their employer) 2016.

The WHO-SAGE is designed as a longitu-\ndinal study with the first wave data collection conducted among\npeople aged 50 and over in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, the\nwave.\nData collection methods\nIn all countries, multistage cluster sampling was used to select\nnationally representative households. All individuals aged 50\nand over in the households were invited and data were collected\nthrough face-to-face interviews conducted by trained staff. The\ncombination of computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI)\nand paper and pencil was used. Details about the sampling pro-\ncedure and data collection have been described elsewhere.13\nInstruments\nStandardised instruments, containing individual and household\nquestionnaires, were used in all six countries. The demographic\n(age and sex) and basic activities of daily living (ADLs) data\nwere derived from the individual questionnaire. We used six\nquestions on ADL to estimate disability prevalence. The ques-\ntions asked how much difficulty the respondents had in the last\n30 days in (1) walking a long distance, (2) bathing or washing\nthe whole body, (3) dressing, (4) transferring through a room,\n(5) eating food and (6) getting to and using the toilet. The\nresponse was recorded in five categories ranging from no diffi-\nculty, mild, moderate, severe and extreme difficulty. Responses\nto each of these questions were dichotomised into `no disability'\n(no difficulty and mild difficulty--coded as 0) and `with disabil-\nity' (moderate, severe and extreme difficulty--coded as 1).\nA total score of ADL was later calculated as the sum of\nresponses to the six questions (range 0\u00ad6). On the basis of the\ntotal ADL, individuals were defined `with disability' (total score\n1\u00ad6) and have `full function' (total score 0).\nStatistical analysis\nAbout 4% of the respondents with missing data in any of the\nvariables included in this study were excluded from the analysis;\nhence, the complete case analysis included 32 770 respondents.\nWe calculated the DFLE for men and women in each country\nusing the Sullivan method. The Sullivan method, established in\nDFLE.15 DFLE is defined as the mean length of time that indivi-\nduals can expect to live free of disability if current health condi-\ntions continue to apply. Two key indicators were used in the\nDFLE calculation, that is, the standard period life table and the\nage-specific prevalence of disability. The life table was estimated\nusing age-specific and sex-specific mortality information\nWe estimated the prevalence of disability, based on the ADL\nstratified by sex. We weighted the survey data using country-\nspecific weights to adjust for different age\u00adsex distributions in\neach country. The person-years of the life table for each age\ngroup were multiplied by the age-specific prevalence of disabil-\nity. The analyses resulted in the total number of remaining life\nyears (total life expectancy, TLE), differentiated into the years\nlived with (life expectancy with disability, LED) and without dis-\nability (DFLE). Finally, we estimated the difference in LE and\nDFLE between men and women. All analyses were conducted in\nStata V\nThe WHO headquarters in Geneva granted access to the\nWHO-SAGE dataset, which is available in public domain.\nAll participants provided informed consents prior to the study.\nRESULTS\nThe sample size ranged from 2140 individuals in Mexico to\n12 784 individuals in China. There were more women in all\ncountries (overall: 51.7% women, 48.3% men), except in Ghana\nrespondents were aged 60 and over and 5% were 80 years and\nover, ranging from 4.2% in China and India to 7.5% in the\nRussian Federation (see online supplementary appendix 1).\nPrevalence of disability\nreported moderate or severe difficulty in performing any of the\nADLs in the last 30 days (table 1). The disability prevalence\nranged from 13.5% in China to 54.1% in India. Women consist-\nently reported more disability compared with men in all coun-\ntries (up to 1.8 times in the Russian Federation). More\nrespondents (29% women, 19% men) reported difficulty in\nwalking long distance compared to other domains where <5%\nof men and 7% of women reported difficulty. Indian men and\nwomen reported higher prevalence of disability in most domains.\nSome exceptions included that more Russian and Mexican\nwomen reported difficulties in bathing/washing and dressing,\nrespectively, and more Mexican, South African and Ghanaian\nmen had problem with dressing, moving inside the home and toi-\nleting, respectively. As expected, the prevalence of disability\nincreased among population at older age groups as shown in\nFigure 1 shows the prevalence of disability by sex and age\ngroup for each country. The prevalence of disability was higher\namong women (dashed lines, grey bars in figure 1) than men\nacross all age groups. The prevalence was also higher among\nolder age groups, consistently in all countries, except for men\naged 85 and over in the Russian Federation and South Africa.\nIndia had the highest prevalence of disability among young age\nability). The prevalence was over 80% among Indian women\naged 75\u00ad79 years (vs only about 40% in their Chinese counter-\nparts). The gender gaps in prevalence of disability were smallest\nin China and largest in Ghana. The gender gaps were constant\nacross age groups in China and Ghana. On the contrary, the\ngender differences were wider among older people in Mexico\nand the Russian Federation and narrower in India and South\nAfrica.\nGender differences in LE and DFLE\nThe highest LE at age 50 (LE-50) was observed in Mexico\n(men: 27 years; women: 29.1 years), while the lowest was\namong South African women (23.3 years) and Ghanaian,\nRussian and South African men (20 years) (see online supple-\nmentary appendices 2 and 3). The proportion of LE lived\nwithout disability (the grey part of the bars) indicated that\nChinese were the healthiest and Indians were the least healthy\n(figure 2). Chinese men and women spent 87% and 81% of\ntheir remaining LE-50 without disability, respectively, compared\nwith only 53% and 34% among Indian men and women.\nGhanaian, Indian and Mexican women aged 85 and over spent\nResearch report\n<20% of their remaining LE-50 without disability. The corre-\nsponding numbers among men aged 85 and over ranged from\nWomen enjoyed a longer LE than men, with higher LE-50\ncompared with men (from 8% higher in Mexico to 40% in the\nRussian Federation). The female advantage was observed stead-\nily across all age groups, though it declined at the older age\ngroups (black bars in figure 3). Yet, women experienced a less\nhealthy life than men. The proportion of women's remaining\nLE without disability was less compared with men (grey bars in\nfigure 3). The gender gap in the proportion of DFLE was smal-\nlest in China and South Africa. This disadvantaged phenomenon\nwas, however, markedly observed among women aged 85 and\nover in Mexico and the Russian Federation, and women aged\nDISCUSSIONS\nThis study expands the current literature on DFLE by using\nrecent nationally representative and comparable data from six\nLMICs. The main findings of the current study are: (1) the\nprevalence of disability was highest in both sexes in India, and it\noccurred at a younger age; (2) women were more disadvantaged\nwith higher prevalence of disability across all age groups, and\nthe situation was worst among older women in Mexico and the\nRussian Federation and (3) though women had higher LE, their\nproportion of remaining LE without disability was lower com-\npared with men.\nIntercountry differences in the level of disability\nThe observed country differences in the prevalence of disability\nin this study might reflect the differential chronic disease\nTable 1 Proportion (and 95% CI) of respondents reporting overall and domain-specific disability in the WHO-SAGE study\nDisability domain China Ghana India Mexico\nThe Russian\nFederation South Africa Pooled data\nMen\nWomen\nOverall\nAll the country-specific proportions were weighted by the country-specific weights, and the pooled proportions were weighted using the pooled weights.\nADL, activity of daily living; CI, confidence interval; WHO-SAGE, WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health.\nTable 2 Proportion (and 95% CI) of respondents reporting domain-specific disability by age groups in the pooled WHO-SAGE study\nMen\nWomen\nAll the proportions were weighted by the pooled weights.\nCI, confidence interval; WHO-SAGE, WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health.\nResearch report\nburdens and their risk factors. Chronic diseases tend to lead to\nchronic-disabling conditions.8 17 18 The proportions of total\nmusculoskeletal disease-related years lived with disability\n(YLDs), one of the leading causes of disability, in the six SAGE\ncountries range from 12% (India) to 19% (the Russian\nFederation). Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPDs)\naccounted for 9\u00ad11% of total YLDs in Ghana and South Africa.\nMexico had a large burden of diabetes-related morbidity and\nmortality,16 which was the highest among the six SAGE coun-\ntries.19 In India, where the disability was highest in our study,\nhaving multiple chronic illnesses, including hypertension, vision\nand hearing deficits, arthritis, depression, COPD, angina, dia-\nbetes and stroke, was significantly associated with disability\nMany of the NCD risk factors predict the onset of disability\namong older adults. Physical inactivity is predictive of shorter\nactive LE and a longer period of disability prior to death in old\nage. Alcohol consumption is strongly associated with cognitive\nand physical disabilities.20 Smoking, on the contrary, is more\nstrongly associated with fatal diseases and a relatively short\nperiod of disablement.21 Overweight and obesity predict func-\ntional decline and physical disability, such as osteoarthritis and\nchronic back pain.21 Compared to smoking and alcohol con-\nsumption, obesity is more strongly associated with an increased\nrisk of more YLDs at age 55.22 Data from the same\nWHO-SAGE population show that over 70% of Chinese and\n90% of South African older adults had two or more NCD risk\nfactors, including daily tobacco use, alcohol use, physical\ninactivity and obesity.23\nThese intercountry differences could also reflect the differences\nin socioeconomic and contextual factors across countries. Even\nthere are intracounty differences observed across different popula-\ntion groups. Studies in Britain and Canada identified strong\nregional variability in DFLE.24 25 In Canada, the highest DFLEs\nwere found in highly populated urban areas, while the lowest\nDFLEs were commonly found in remote rural regions.25 In the\nUK, there was an increasing clustering of inequalities in DFLE in\ndeprived areas compared with affluent areas.24 Inequalities in\nDFLE are also driven by socioeconomic status.24\u00ad27 Educational\ninequalities favouring the higher educated have been identified\namong European pensioners before and after the retirement and\namong Belgian men and women.6 26 Other social determinants\nsuch as illiteracy, smoking and unemployment are strongly asso-\nciated with variations in DFLE in Spain.27\nGender inequality in disability and LE\nOur study confirms the existence of gender inequality in disabil-\nity and LE as observed elsewhere.28\u00ad31 We show that women\nhave longer LE but proportionally less years of DFLE than men\nas shown in other studies.32\u00ad35 The gender inequalities in DFLE\nwere more evident in India, Ghana, Mexico and the Russian\nFederation. The similar observations, putting women as the dis-\nadvantaged sex, have also been reported in 25 countries in the\nWomen had higher prevalence of non-fatal chronic conditions\ncompared with men who are more likely to die from more fatal\ndiseases before being disabled due to disease. The differences\ncould be attributed to the biological and social determinants of\nhealthy ageing.36 In many LMICs, women tend to have higher\nrates of sedentary behaviour, hence lower muscle strength and\nbone density and higher proportion of body fat. They might\nalso have restricted access to nutritional food and healthcare\nfacilities. Consequently, women may accumulate more disability\nthroughout the life course. On the other hand, younger men\ncould suffer more disability than younger women, as they were\nmore prone to be exposed to economic and social instability,\nFigure 1 Prevalence of disability\namong men and women in each age\ngroup in the six WHO-SAGE countries.\nThe darker bars and the solid lines\nrepresent men, the lighter bars and the\ndashed lines represent women.

WHO-SAGE,\nWHO Study on global AGEing and\nadult health.\nResearch report\nCultural context of disability\nThe meaning of ageing is less biologically dependent but more\nsocioculturally constructed. The differences in the perception\nand evaluation of age and ageing vary considerably across cul-\ntures,39 hence, the ageing process might not progress uniformly\nacross populations. Eastern/Asian cultures--being based on\nConfucian values, ancestor worship and filial piety--employ\nmore positive views on ageing compared to Western societies,\nwhich are thought to be more youth oriented and thus holding\nmore negative notions towards the ageing process and elderly.\nChanges in functioning could therefore reflect changes in indivi-\nduals' expectations of disability and use of equipment, rather\nthan changes in their underlying disabilities.\nStrengths and limitations of the study\nThis study is one of the first studies with a cross-country DFLE\ncomparison using a standardised instrument. The national repre-\nsentative sample in the WHO-SAGE ensures the generalisability\nof the findings to the population in each country. Stringent\nresearch protocol employed in the study ensured that translation\nof questionnaire from English to local or national language in\nparticipating countries achieved equivalence across settings.13\nThe large dataset with relatively low proportion of missing data\nensures sufficient sample size to obtain robust statistics, espe-\ncially among the oldest age group above 80 years. The use of\nSullivan method, recommended for its simplicity, relative accur-\nacy and ease of interpretation, produces comparable results\nacross the six countries.40\nSeveral limitations in this study warrant careful interpretation\nof the results. The WHO-SAGE surveyed only\ncommunity-dwelling older adults and not institutionalised older\nadults; hence, we might have underestimated the true preva-\nlence of disability. The prevalence of disability might also be\ninfluenced by acute short-lasting illness that could not be con-\ntrolled for in the analysis. On the contrary, the more conserva-\ntive definition of disability in this study might be sensitive\nenough in revealing its true prevalence. The data do not allow\nus to assess a non-returnable state assumption, whether people\nrecovered from their disability situation or not. It is therefore\nnot possible to examine the transitional probabilities across dif-\nferent functional states, and how the disability transition rates\nand level vary by age and sex. As with many studies which were\nbased on self-reported questionnaire, the comparability of cross-\ncountry findings in this study might be hampered by differential\nhealth reporting related to different experiences and expectation\nabout health by different population groups within and between\ncountries.41 Though anchoring vignette approach has been\nintroduced to handle these reporting differences in cross-\ncountry studies,42 43 the applicability of this method in some\nsettings has been limited.44 45 Biological markers collected in\nthe second wave of SAGE could shed light on the validity of\nthese self-reported questionnaires in measuring health and dis-\nability across different population groups.46\nPublic health policy implications\nOur study raises several policy implications concerning the import-\nance of monitoring health trends through the DFLE indicator.\nFurther investigations on how social determinants of health and\nlifestyle risk factors might influence the disability states in different\ncountries are needed to understand the complexity of disability\nproblems among older people. Though the health of older women\nis a critically important issue, the feminisation of ageing phenom-\nenon is policy-wise a less acknowledged field. Without challenging\npolicies related to welfare, pensions, families and migration that\nemanate from the interests and experiences in more developed\ncountries, the gendering of old-age experiences we see in the\npresent global context may not change to any great extent.47 The\ncontextual differences in how the process of ageing is experienced\nneed to be considered by decision-makers, when designing gender-\nresponsive policies and programmes for ageing women. Further,\nensuring universal healthcare and strengthening the health system\nto address the emerging burden of NCDs and the intersection of\nNCDs with other diseases among women using a life course per-\nspective are among the essential steps to promote healthy ageing\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere are significant inequalities in the levels of disability and\nDFLE among men and women, and these inequalities are also\nobserved across different age groups over 50 years in the six\nSAGE countries. Countermeasures to decrease intercountry and\nbetween-gender differences in DFLE, including accelerating eco-\nnomic development and improving health promotion and\nhealthcare distribution, with a gender equity focus, are needed.\nWhat is already known on this subject\nLife expectancy has increased unprecedentedly in low-and-\nmiddle income countries in the last few decades. Yet, adding\nextra years to life does not always mean that the additional\nyears are disability free.\nWhat this study adds\nGender differences in LE and DFLE exist across different age\ngroups over 50 years in LMICs. Though women had a higher life\nexpectancy, they also had worse health conditions compared\nwith men. Therefore, policy actions aiming to reduce the burden\nof disability and maximise DFLE for older populations must be a\npriority in promoting healthy ageing. It is also vital to address\nthe social and biological determinants of healthy ageing in\nLMICs applying a strong gender equity focus.\nContributors AS, JS, MV and NN designed the study, conducted the statistical\nanalysis and interpreted the data.
