Kovandzic\nProgram in Criminology, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America\n Introduction\nThe social ramifications of marijuana legalization have been\nhotly debated for at least four decades [1]. Despite a long history of\nmarijuana use for medical purposes, policymakers and in some\ninstances, the scientific community, have been quick to note the\npotential problematic social outcomes of marijuana legalization\n[2]. In spite of these political discussions, medical marijuana\nlegalization (MML) has occurred in 20 states and the District of\nColumbia (between 1996 and the writing of this paper) and its\nrecreational use has now been legalized in Colorado and\nWashington [3]. An interest in the ramifications of these laws\nhas led to an increase in scholarly activity on the topic [4], [5]. The\nissue addressed in this article is whether MML has the effect of\nincreasing crime. While there are many mechanisms by which\nMML might affect crime rates, the most obvious is by increasing\nthe number of marijuana users, which may lead to a broader social\nacceptance of drug using behaviors and drug users [6]. To the\nextent that marijuana use serves as a ``gateway'' to harder drugs\nsuch as cocaine and heroin, MML could lead to long-term\nincreases in crime as an ever-growing number of illicit drug users\nengage in serious predatory crimes to support their habits (but see\n[7]). But even if MML does not lead to a rise in marijuana use\n(especially among youth), the laws could still stimulate crime as\nnewly opened medical marijuana dispensaries provide criminals\nwith a highly attractive target with their repository of high quality\nmarijuana and customers carrying large amounts of cash (but see\n[8]). As a member of the California Chiefs of Police Association\nstated, ``A disturbing and continuing trend is the increasing\nnumber of home invasion robberies and associated violence\nresulting in the victimization of those cultivating and possessing\nmarijuana ... [D]ispensaries also continue to be targeted based\nupon the availability of larger quantities of drugs and cash'' (see\nhttp://californiapolicechiefs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/\nJuly_September_2010_Final.pdf). Though anecdotal evidence\nabounds to support both theses, and a few single-jurisdiction and\ncross-sectional studies have examined the MML-crime link (e.g.,\n[9]), no single analysis has assessed the overall consequences of\nmedical marijuana laws on crime rates across the United States.\nThis study seeks to inform the debate by providing a comprehen-\nsive evaluation of the effects of state MML on state crime rates.\nThe Positive Correlation between Marijuana Use and\nCriminal Behavior\nThough the gateway hypothesis applies to the progression of\ndrug-using behaviors, there remains the possibility that marijuana\nuse leads to delinquent or criminal behavior via a similar\nmechanism. A number of studies have specifically examined the\nrelationship between marijuana use and crime [10], [11], [12],\n[13], [14]. Early studies compared the amount of crimes\ncommitted by juveniles whose urine tested positive for marijuana\nupon entering a detention center and those committed by\nindividuals who tested negative for marijuana. Dembo and\nassociates [15], [16], for instance, found that youths who tested\npositive for marijuana had a significantly higher number of\nreferrals to juvenile court for nondrug felonies than those testing\nnegative for marijuana use.\nArseneault and colleagues [17] examined the relationship\nbetween marijuana dependence and the risk for violence in a\nsample of New Zealand adolescents. The authors controlled for\ngender, socioeconomic status, and many other concurrent\ndisorders and concluded that marijuana dependence was related\nto a 280 percent increase in the odds of violence. This association\nwas stronger than the individual effects of manic disorder, alcohol\ndependence, and schizophrenia. In a study using data collected\nfrom school-age adolescents in the Netherlands, those who\nreported marijuana use tended to report more delinquent and\naggressive behaviors [18]. This relationship was significant after\ncontrolling for variables such as alcohol and tobacco use and the\nstrength of the relationship increased with higher frequency of\nmarijuana use. This study is noteworthy because marijuana use is\ndecriminalized in the Netherlands, thus the relationship is unlikely\nto be based on the fact that marijuana users have to participate in\nthe illegal market and are therefore at an increased risk for\nviolence. While these studies were cross-sectional and show a\ncorrelation between current marijuana use and criminality or\nviolent behaviors, other scholars have examined the link with\nlongitudinal data.\nUsing multi-wave data, research has shown adolescents who\nreported marijuana use at age 15 were more likely to report violent\ninvolvement at age 19, indicating that marijuana use, particularly\nduring adolescence may impact violent behavior in young\nadulthood [19]. Similarly, research has shown that frequent\nmarijuana use during adolescence was a strong predictor of being\ninvolved in intimate partner violence [5]. Results revealed that\nconsistent marijuana use during adolescence was related to a 108\npercent increase in the likelihood of being involved in intimate\npartner violence in young adulthood and consistent marijuana use\nwas associated with an 85 percent increase in the odds of being the\nperpetrator of intimate partner violence, independent of alcohol\nuse.\nThese studies provide evidence to the notion that marijuana use\nis at a minimum correlated with an increase in violent or\naggressive behaviors. What remains unclear is whether these\nfindings imply a causal link between marijuana use and violence or\nwhether the relationship is driven by an uncontrolled variable(s)\n(i.e., a spurious correlation). Along these lines, it could be argued\nthat the relationship between violence and marijuana use is\nprimarily due to its illegality and thus would not exist in an\nenvironment in which marijuana use, at least medicinally, is\nlegalized.\nThe Negative or Null Correlation between Marijuana Use\nand Criminal Behavior\nMost researchers who have examined the relationship between\nmarijuana use and crime report that these laws do not have an\neffect on violent crime [20], [21]. Green and associates [20], for\ninstance, concluded that while marijuana use was related to an\nincrease in drug and property crime, it was not related to an\nincrease in violent crime. Pedersen and Skardhamar [21] also\nfound a relationship between marijuana use and subsequent arrest,\nalthough once the authors removed all types of drug charges from\nthe models, the relationship was no longer significant. Results\nrevealed no evidence that marijuana use was related to an increase\nin later non-drug arrest, such as arrests for violent crimes. The\nauthors argued that the association between marijuana use and\ncrime appears to exist because of its illegality. Thus, if the\npossession and sale of marijuana was legal the relationship\nbetween marijuana and crime might disappear.\nIt has been argued that medicinal marijuana laws may increase\ncrime because the dispensaries and grow houses provide an\nopportunity for property crime and violent crime to occur, such as\nburglary and robbery. Kepple and Freisthler [9] examined the\nrelationship between medical marijuana dispensaries and crime\nand their results suggested that after controlling for a host of\necological variables, no relationship existed between medicinal\nmarijuana dispensaries and property or violent crime. Additional\nresearch has shown that medical marijuana dispensaries may\nactually reduce crime within the immediate vicinity of the\ndispensaries [8]. This may be due to the security measures\nimplemented by dispensary owners (i.e., having security cameras,\nhaving a doorman, and having signs requiring identification).\nImportantly, medical marijuana dispensaries do not appear to\nincrease crime in their surrounding areas.\nIn sum, research on the relationship between medicinal\nmarijuana and crime is mixed. Studies have shown that states\nallowing the use of medical marijuana have higher prevalence\nrates of marijuana use [13], [14], yet other studies have found that\nlegalized medicinal marijuana does not lead to an increase in its\noverall use [21], [22]. Research has also suggested that marijuana\nuse is associated with an increase in illicit drug use [23], [19] and\nan increase in crime [17], [19], [16]. Others, however, have\nrevealed that marijuana is not related to additional illicit drug use\nevidence is equivocal and in need of a rigorous evaluation of the\nMML-crime relationship.\nMethods\nData & Measures\nDependent Variables. Data on all seven Part I offenses--\nhomicide, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and auto\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting\n(UCR) Program, published as Crime in the United States. The data\nwere obtained using the ``data for analysis'' tool on the Bureau of\nJustice Statistics Web site (http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/dtd.\nhtm). All data were gathered for each of the 50 U.S. states across\nthe 17 year time span for a total N = 850. Values reflect the rate of\nMedical Marijuana Legalization (MML). To determine if\nand when MML occurred within a state, we searched the official\nfollowing 11 states legalized marijuana for medical use, with the\nyear the law was passed in parentheses: Alaska (1998), California\nbased on MML ``legislation-effective year'' rather than ``legisla-\ntion-passed year'' and found no substantive differences in the\nresults. The MML effective dates were also gathered from each\nState's official legislative website. Only 2 states (Connecticut and\nColorado) had an MML effective year different than ``passed''\nyear, both being only a 1-year difference. While there are many\noptions in modeling the effects of MML adoption on crime, we\nopted to use a post-law trend variable. The trend variable\nrepresents the number of years the law has been in effect with a\nvalue of zero for all years before the law was passed, a value of 1\nfor the year the law was passed, and a value of 1+k, where k =\nnumber of years after the initial passage of the law, for all\nsubsequent years. Unlike the traditional ``dummy variable''\napproach (i.e., 0 = no MML law, 1 = MML law), which posits\na once-and-for-all impact on crime, the post-law trend variable\nThe Effect of Medical Marijuana Laws on Crime\ncaptures any changes in the linear trend of crime that may be\nobserved over time. If opponents of MML are correct that the laws\nlead to increased marijuana use by teenagers, many of whom are\nlikely to continue illicit hard drug use throughout their adulthood,\none might expect a gradual increase in crime over time. Such an\neffect would be best captured by the post-law trend variable.\nSociodemographic Control Variables. Sociodemographic\nvariables were included in the analysis to aid in controlling for a\nvast array of other time-varying influences that might be potential\nconfounding factors over the study period. These variables, and\ntheir sources, have been described previously [24]. Specifically,\nthey include each state's percent of the civilian labor force\nunemployed; the total employment rate; percent of the population\nliving below the poverty line; real per-capita income (divided by\nthe Consumer Price Index); the proportion of residents aged 15\u00ad\n24; the proportion of residents aged 25\u00ad34, the proportion of\nresidents aged 35\u00ad44 years; the per-capita rate of beer consump-\ntion [25]; the proportion of residents with at least a bachelor's\ndegree; and the percent of the state's population that lived in a\nmetropolitan area. State-level unemployment data were obtained\nfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (www.bls.gov/sae/\nhome). Data on poverty were acquired via the Bureau of the\nCensus website (www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty). Personal\nincome and real welfare payments data were taken from the\nBureau of Economic Analysis website (www.bea.doc.gov/bea/\nregional/reis). The age variables were obtained directly from the\nU.S. Bureau of the Census. Data on beer consumption were taken\nfrom the Beer Institute website (www.beerinstitute.org). The\npercent of the population with college degrees or higher and the\npercent of the population living in a metropolitan area are linear\ninterpolations of decennial census data, as reported in various\neditions of the Statistical Abstracts of the United States.\nAdditional measures included the number of prison inmates per\nresidents. The number of prisoners was measured as the number\nof prisoners sentenced to more than a year in custody as of\nBureau of Justice Statistic's website (www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs). Data\non the total number of police, including civilians, were taken from\nthe Public Employment series prepared by the Bureau of the\nCensus. Louisiana and Mississippi were missing information on\nthis variable for the year 2006, therefore reducing the usable case\ncount by two units. Substantive results were identical when values\nfor this year were imputed with values from the previous year.\nSummary statistics for these explanatory variables are presented in\nAnalysis Plan\nTo identify the effect of MML on crime, we use a fixed-effects\npanel design, exploiting the within state variation introduced by\nthe passage of MML in 11 states over the 17 year observation\nperiod. The design allows for the assessment of whether states\nadopting MML experienced changes in the trend of crime by\nanalyzing within state changes in crime rates over time and\ncomparing those changes to the crime rate trends among states\nthat did not pass an MML law. To carry out this analysis, we\nestimate fixed-effects ordinary least squares regression models,\nwhere the natural log of each crime rate variable (i.e., homicide,\nrape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and auto theft) is the\ndependent variable. This model directly accounts for dynamic\nfactors that cause crime to vary from state to state, as well as those\nstable unmeasured factors that differ between states [26], [27]. In\naddition, we also include ``year fixed-effects,'' which capture any\nnational influences on crime that are not captured in any of the\ntime-varying explanatory variables. Robust standard errors are\nclustered at the state level to avoid biased standard errors due to\nthe non-independence of data points over time [28]. Thus, the\nfixed effects models can be expressed algebraically following the\nconvention set forth by Wooldridge [27] as:\nlog (\ny\nM\nMLjtz . . . zbik\nx\nxjtz\ne\neit\nwhere:\n\u00ad the subscripts i, j, and t are used to identify the crime rate\nvariable being used as the dependent variable, the 50 states,\n\u00ad log (\ny\nyijt) = the time-demeaned (see [27]) logged crime rate\noutcome variable;\n\u00ad bi0 = the crime-specific constant term;\nM\nMLjt = the time-demeaned crime-specific average\nimpact of MML on crime rates;\n\u00ad z . . . zbik\nx\nxjt = the time-demeaned crime-specific effect of\nthe various control variables, including year dummies, a linear\ntrend variable, and state fixed effects;\n\u00ad and, \ne\neit = the time-demeaned crime-specific error term.\nIt is important to note that fixed-effects models are not without\nlimitations. While they are well suited to address the issue at hand\nand account for unobserved time-invariant factors, they are always\nTable 1. Summary Statistics.\nMean SD\nDependent Variables (prior to log transformation)\nIndependent Variable\nSociodemographic control variables\nnoted in the text.\nThe Effect of Medical Marijuana Laws on Crime\nvulnerable to time-varying factors that are not accounted for that\ndiffer between states with MML and those without. However, we\nhave accounted for the bulk of factors that have been shown\nassociated with state crime rates and our models explain a\nconsiderable amount of variation in each outcome. It is also\nimportant to acknowledge that fixed-effects models do not account\nfor temporal ordering for time-varying predictors within a given\nobservation period. For example, it is unknown whether states\nadopted MML after experiencing lower crime rates in a given\nyear(s), however, this is unlikely to be an issue here since policy\nresponse to crime rates tend to take time and we account for this\nvia operationalization of MML as an additive effect.\nResults\nPrimary Findings\nBefore consulting the results from the fixed effects regression\nmodels, a series of unconditioned crime rates for each offense type\nwere generated and are presented in Figure 1. Note that two crime\nrate trends are presented in each panel. One trend--the solid\nline--shows the crime rate, by year, for states that had not passed\nan MML law. Thus, states that eventually did pass an MML law\ncontribute to the solid line up until the year that they passed the\nMML law. As expected from the overall crime trend during this\ntime period, the solid line reveals that all states experienced a\nImportant to note is the trend revealed by the dashed line, which\nshows the crime rate trends for states after passing an MML law.\nWith one exception--forcible rape--states passing MML laws\nexperienced reductions in crime and the rate of reduction appears\nto be steeper for states passing MML laws as compared to others\nfor several crimes such as homicide, robbery, and aggravated\nassault. The raw number of homicides, robberies, and aggravated\nassaults also appear to be lower for states passing MML as\npreliminary results suggest MML may have a crime-reducing\neffect, but recall that these are unconditional averages, meaning\nthat the impact of the covariates and other factors related to time\nseries trends have not been accounted for in these figures.\nThe results of the fixed effects analyses are presented in Table 2.\nIt is important to note that a Hausman test was carried out to\ndetermine whether the fixed effects model was preferable over the\nrandom effects model; the latter model is more parsimonious and,\nthus, should be preferred when results do not systematically differ\nacross the two approaches. The results of the Hausman tests (with\nyear fixed effects omitted for both equations because they are\ninestimable in the random effects model) suggested that the fixed\neffects model was preferred in each of the seven analyses. For\nassault, burglary, larceny, and auto theft, respectively.\nThe key results gleaned from the fixed effects analyses are\npresented in row 1 of Table 2, which reveals the impact of the\nMML trend variable on crime rates, while controlling for the other\ntime-varying explanatory variables. Two findings worth noting\nemerged from the different fixed effects regression analyses. First,\nthe impact of MML on crime was negative or not statistically\nsignificant in all but one of the models, suggesting the passage of\nMML may have a dampening effect on certain crimes. The second\nkey finding was that the coefficients capturing the impact of MML\non homicide and assault were the only two that emerged as\nstatistically significant. Specifically, the results indicate approxi-\nmately a 2.4 percent reduction in homicide and assault,\nrespectively, for each additional year the law is in effect. Because\nlog-linear models were estimated, the coefficient must be\ntransformed according to the following formula to generate\npercentage changes in crime for a one-unit increase in MML:\ne(b-1)*100 [27]. However, it is important to note that the finding for\nhomicide was less variable (i.e., a lower standard error) as\ncompared to assault. One might argue a Bonferroni correction is\nnecessary given the exploratory nature of the study and the\nmultiple models that were analyzed. Once a Bonferroni correction\nwas carried out (i.e., a/7), only the effect of MML on homicide\nremained statistically significant (.05/7 = .007). Perhaps the most\nimportant finding in Table 2 is the lack of evidence of any increase\nin robbery or burglary, which are the type of crimes one might\nexpect to gradually increase over time if the MML-crime thesis\nwas correct. Thus, in the end, MML was not found to have a\ncrime enhancing effect for any of the crime types analyzed.\nSensitivity Analyses\nThe fixed effects models presented above were subjected to a\nrange of sensitivity tests to determine whether the findings were\nrobust to alternative model specifications. First, and as previously\nnoted, data for the two missing cases were imputed using matched\ncase replacement for Louisiana and Mississippi. Importantly,\nsubstantive results were identical when this strategy was carried\nout. A second sensitivity analysis explored the possibility that the\neffect of MML on crime rates was non-linear. No evidence\nemerged to support the hypothesis that MML has a non-linear\neffect on crime rate trends. Third, a related issue concerns whether\nthe MML effect has both a trend effect (shown above) and a one-\ntime shock effect. We considered this issue by including the MML\ntrend variable (discussed above) along with a dummy variable\ncoded 0 for years when no MML law was present (by state) and\ncoded 1 in years when an MML law had been passed. The\nfindings were practically identical to those shown above: the MML\ntrend variable was negatively related to homicide (b = 2.02,\nre-estimated the original models (shown above), by weighting each\nstate proportional to its population size. When these weighted\nfixed effects models were estimated, the substantive findings were\nsomewhat different than those presented above. Specifically, the\neffect of MML on homicide rates was no longer statistically\nsignificant (b = 2.01, p = .30), MML negatively predicted robbery\nrates (b = 2.02, p,.10), MML negatively predicted assault rates\n(b = 2.03, p,.01), and MML positively predicted auto theft rates\n(b = .03, p,.05). While it is common in the crime policy literature\nto weight observations by resident population to correct for\npossible heteroskedasticity, this will be the efficient feasible GLS\n(generalized least squares) procedure only if the heteroskedasticity\ntakes a particular form, i.e. variance proportional to the square of\nthe population. In the present study, the unweighted results\nproduce findings that are substantively consistent with the\nweighted results, although they differ slightly quantitatively. The\nmost likely explanation for this discrepancy is that the weighted\nresults are driven by a few large population states. For this reason,\nwe present the unweighted results as the main results and the\nweighted results as part of our numerous robustness checks.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe effects of legalized medical marijuana have been passion-\nately debated in recent years. Empirical research on the direct\nrelationship between medical marijuana laws and crime, however,\nis scant and the consequences of marijuana use on crime remain\nunknown. Studies have shown that marijuana use was associated\nwith higher prevalence of subsequent illicit drug use [19] and an\nThe Effect of Medical Marijuana Laws on Crime\nThe Effect of Medical Marijuana Laws on Crime\nincreased risk of violence [17]. Yet, other studies have found that\nonce additional factors were controlled for, there was no\nrelationship between marijuana use and later serious drug use\n[7]. Research has also shown that marijuana use is not related to\nviolent crime when measured at the individual-level [20]. Once\ndrug charges are controlled for, Pedersen and Skardhamar [21]\nreported that the relationship between marijuana and crime was\nnot significantly different from zero. Unfortunately, no study has\nexamined the effect of legalized medical marijuana on state crime\nrates across the United States. The current study sought to fill this\ngap by assessing the effect of legalized medicinal marijuana on the\nseven Part I UCR offenses. The analysis was the first to look at\nmultiple offenses across multiple states and time periods to explore\nwhether MML impacts state crime rates.\nThe central finding gleaned from the present study was that\nMML is not predictive of higher crime rates and may be related to\nreductions in rates of homicide and assault. Interestingly, robbery\nand burglary rates were unaffected by medicinal marijuana\nlegislation, which runs counter to the claim that dispensaries and\ngrow houses lead to an increase in victimization due to the\nopportunity structures linked to the amount of drugs and cash that\nare present. Although, this is in line with prior research suggesting\nthat medical marijuana dispensaries may actually reduce crime in\nthe immediate vicinity [8].\nIn sum, these findings run counter to arguments suggesting the\nlegalization of marijuana for medical purposes poses a danger to\npublic health in terms of exposure to violent crime and property\ncrimes. To be sure, medical marijuana laws were not found to have\na crime exacerbating effect on any of the seven crime types. On\nthe contrary, our findings indicated that MML precedes a\nreduction in homicide and assault. While it is important to remain\ncautious when interpreting these findings as evidence that MML\nreduces crime, these results do fall in line with recent evidence [29]\nand they conform to the longstanding notion that marijuana\nFigure 1. Mean State Crime Rates as a Function of Year, by Medical Marijuana Law (MML). NOTE: Crime rates for states mandating MML\nafter 1996 remained in the ``Prior to Medical Marijuana'' line until transition to MML.\nTable 2.

The following variables were divided by 100000 in order to\nproduce coefficients that did not require scientific notation to interpret: Employment rate, Beer consumption, and Prisoners per 100k.\nThe Effect of Medical Marijuana Laws on Crime\nlegalization may lead to a reduction in alcohol use due to\nindividuals substituting marijuana for alcohol [see generally 29,\n30]. Given the relationship between alcohol and violent crime\n[31], it may turn out that substituting marijuana for alcohol leads\nto minor reductions in violent crimes that can be detected at the\nstate level. That said, it also remains possible that these\nassociations are statistical artifacts (recall that only the homicide\neffect holds up when a Bonferroni correction is made).\nGiven that the current results failed to uncover a crime\nexacerbating effect attributable to MML, it is important to\nexamine the findings with a critical eye. While we report no\npositive association between MML and any crime type, this does\nnot prove MML has no effect on crime (or even that it reduces\ncrime). It may be the case that an omitted variable, or set of\nvariables, has confounded the associations and masked the true\npositive effect of MML on crime. If this were the case, such a\nvariable would need to be something that was restricted to the\nstates that have passed MML, it would need to have emerged in\nclose temporal proximity to the passage of MML in all of those\nstates (all of which had different dates of passage for the marijuana\nlaw), and it would need to be something that decreased crime to\nsuch an extent that it ``masked'' the true positive effect of MML\n(i.e., it must be something that has an opposite sign effect between\nMML [e.g., a positive correlation] and crime [e.g., a negative\ncorrelation]). Perhaps the more likely explanation of the current\nfindings is that MML laws reflect behaviors and attitudes that have\nbeen established in the local communities. If these attitudes and\nbehaviors reflect a more tolerant approach to one another's\npersonal rights, we are unlikely to expect an increase in crime and\nmight even anticipate a slight reduction in personal crimes.\nMoreover, the present findings should also be taken in context\nwith the nature of the data at hand. They are based on official\narrest records (UCR), which do not account for crimes not\nreported to the police and do not account for all charges that may\nunderlie an arrest. In any case, this longitudinal assessment of\nmedical marijuana laws on state crime rates suggests that these\nlaws do not appear to have any negative (i.e., crime exacerbating)\nimpact on officially reported criminality during the years in which\nthe laws are in effect, at least when it comes to the types of\noffending explored here. It is also important to keep in mind that\nthe UCR data used here did not account for juvenile offending,\nwhich may or may not be empirically tethered to MML in some\nform or another; an assessment of which is beyond the scope of\nthis study.\nAuthor Contributions\nAnalyzed the data: RM JCB.
