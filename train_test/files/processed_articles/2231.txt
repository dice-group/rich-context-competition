This active state-based\nsurveillance system includes data from seven states for 2003 and 13 states for 2004. The incident-level\nstructure facilitates identification of homicide/suicide incidents.\n(58%) were a current or former intimate partner of the perpetrator. Among all male perpetrators of\nintimate partner homicide 30.6% were also suicides. A substantial proportion of the victims (13.7%) were\nthe children of the perpetrator. Overall, most victims (74.6%) were female and most perpetrators were\nmale (91.9%). A recent history of legal problems (25.3%), or financial problems (9.3%) was common\namong the perpetrators.\nConclusions: The results support earlier research documenting the importance of intimate partner violence\n(IPV) and situational stressors on homicide/suicide. These results suggest that efforts to provide assistance\nto families in crisis and enhance the safety of IPV victims are needed to reduce risk for homicide/suicide.\nThe consistency of the results from the NVDRS with those from past studies and the comprehensive\ninformation available in the NVDRS highlight the promise of this system for studying homicide/suicide\nincidents and for evaluating the impact of prevention policies and programs.\nHomicide followed by suicide is a relatively rare lethal\nincident in which an individual kills another and\nsubsequently dies by suicide, usually shortly after the\nhomicide.1 Past studies of homicide/suicide have estimated\nrates of occurrence in the US to be between 0.2\u00ad0.38 per\noccurrence, homicide/suicide incidents have a significant\nimpact on the children, families, and communities of the\nvictims and perpetrators.6 This study describes characteristics\nof perpetrators and victims of homicide/suicide, including\nnature of the relationship, location of the incident, history of\nalcohol or drug use, and interpersonal violence.\nHomicide/suicide incidents usually include one victim and\none perpetrator.1 In a majority of homicide/suicide incidents,\nthe homicide perpetrator is male, older than the victim, and is\nlikely to be white.5\u00ad7 A history of depression and/or mental\nillness is also common among perpetrators.5 8 Victims of\nthese incidents are more likely to be women who have\nseparated or are divorced from their partners.8\u00ad9\nHomicide/suicide incidents involving strangers are rare.8 In\nprevious studies of homicide/suicide incidents, more than\n95% of the perpetrators were known to the victims.1 10 Most\noften, the perpetrator was a former or current husband or\nother intimate partner with the homicide taking place in the\nhome of the victim.9 The authors of a recent study of\nhomicide/suicide incidents in China were able to identify an\nintimate relationship between the perpetrator and victim in\n95% of the incidents.11 When comparing homicide/suicide\nincidents to homicides, research has suggested that the\nperpetrator is more likely to die by suicide when the motive is\nrelated to possessiveness/jealousy, sickness, or stress and\nthese incidents are more likely to be premeditated than a\nAlcohol or drug use is a common risk factor in homicides,\nindependent of the suicide of the perpetrator.13 However, the\nrole of alcohol or drug use in homicide/suicide incidents is\nless clear as this information is not always available. In a\nreview of factors associated with perpetration of a homicide\nfollowed by suicide where toxicological information was\navailable, 34% of the perpetrators had detectible blood\nalcohol content during postmortem exams and other\nsubstances were identifiable in 18% of that same group.6\nMale perpetrators are also more likely than victims to be\nunder the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident.14\nThe majority of deaths associated with homicide/suicide\nincidents in the US involve a gun, with handguns being used\nmost frequently.3 14\u00ad15 Other weapons associated with homi-\ncide/suicide incidents include knives, blunt objects, and\nmotor vehicles; other methods of homicide have included\nstrangling/asphyxiation, poisoning, and physical assault.11\nApproximately one quarter of homicide/suicide incidents\ninvolve persons over the age of 55.16 While males remain the\nmost likely perpetrators in this age group, as many as 50% of\nmale perpetrators identified in a study of homicide/suicide\namong the elderly identified the husband as the main\ncaregiver in the relationship.17 Recently, a comparison of\nhomicide/suicide and suicides found that perpetrators of\nhomicide/suicide over the age of 55 were more likely than\nthose who died by suicide to have reported a recent illness, to\nhave provided care for another, and to have a history of\ndomestic violence.18\nThis study considers the association between these char-\nacteristics and perpetration or victimization in homicide/\nAbbreviations: IPV, intimate partner violence; MSA, metropolitan\nstatistical area; NVDRS, National Violent Death Reporting System.\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nsuicide incidents using data from the National Violent Death\ndemographic characteristics for both victims and perpetrators\nare compared and the association between homicide/suicide\nincidents and risk factors is considered using the detailed\ncontextual and personal data available in the NVDRS.\nDATA\nThe NVDRS is an active state based surveillance system that\nprovides a census of resident and violent deaths that occur\nwithin the US. Six states (Maryland, Massachusetts, New\nJersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia) contributed\ndata in 2003 and an additional seven states (Alaska,\nColorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode\nIsland, and Wisconsin) began contributing data in 2004. A\nviolent death is defined as a death resulting from the\nintentional use of any means to injure or poison oneself,\nanother person, or group of people. Included in the NVDRS,\ntherefore, are all homicides, suicides, and legal intervention\ndeaths, excluding legal executions and acts of war. The\nNVDRS also includes unintentional firearm related deaths,\nand deaths of undetermined intent occurring within the US\nto assess misclassification. The NVDRS captures data in a\nrelational database that includes victims (deceased persons),\nalleged perpetrators (deceased or live suspects), mechanisms\nof injury, and other details of the incident. Details of NVDRS\nmethods appear in Paulozzi et al and Azrael et al.19 20\nMETHODS\nHomicide/suicide incidents were identified by scanning the\nNVDRS data sets for incidents involving at least one suicide\n(abstractor assigned manner of death = 1) and one\nhomicide (abstractor assigned manner of death = 2). To\nbe considered a homicide/suicide incident in the NVDRS, a\nsuicide must occur within 24 hours of the homicide(s).\nUnder this selection criterion, 65 incidents (involving 84\nhomicides) were identified for the seven states covered by the\nhomicides) were identified for the 13 states covered by the\ninvolved multiple homicides (5 double homicides, 7 triple\nmultiple homicides (15 double homicides, 1 triple homicide,\n1 quadruple homicide).\nAt-risk population estimates based on US Census Bureau\ndata21\u00ad23 were used in the calculation of incidence rates.\nRecently released US Census Bureau data were also used to\ndetermine the metropolitan, micropolitan, or rural character-\nization of individual counties in the NVDRS reporting states.\nThe rates by race/ethnicity, gender, and metropolitan status\nwere age adjusted to the US standard population for the year\nAnalysis of incidence rates for rare occurrences or condi-\ntions often relies on the assumption that cases occur\naccording to a homogeneous Poisson process.25\u00ad27 Because of\nthe frequent clustering of victims associated with homicide/\nsuicide incidents, the independence assumption inherent in\nthis approach is violated. Therefore, an alternate method\nwhich compensates for such clustering was used to calculate\nconfidence intervals.28 The adjustment for clustering resulted\nin some confidence intervals, based on otherwise stable rate\nestimates, that are as much as 25% wider than those\ncalculated without such adjustment.\nThese analyses consider incidents at both the victim\n(n = 248 homicides) and incident (or perpetrator) level\n(n = 209). Frequencies were calculated using the appropriate\ndenominator for the selected level of analysis. Complete data\nwere not available for every incident. The number of cases\nmissing information on any measure is provided in the table.\nData on circumstance, relationship, and individual char-\nacteristics were often consolidated from multiple measures.\nOften a single element (for example, intimate partner\nviolence) is abstracted from multiple sources. To ensure\nmore complete representation, all available information was\nused to identify cases. For example, an incident can be\nidentified as intimate partner violence related using informa-\ntion taken from child fatality reviews, medical examiner\nrecords, or police reports. In these analyses an incident is\nTable 1 Characteristics of homicide victims in homicide/suicide incidents\nHomicide\nHomicide\nAge\u00c0 (years)\nRace/ethnicity1\nGender\nMetropolitan status\u00f4\n\u00c0The age of one victim in 2003 could not be determined from the available data.\n1The race/ethnicity data for nine victims in 2003 and one victim in 2004 were missing (n = 4) or corresponded to a group not appearing in this table (n = 6).\n\u00f4Metropolitan status could not be determined for two victims in 2003 and three victims in 2004.\n**Rate has an estimated coefficient of variation .30% (indicating instability) after adjustment for clustering.\n\u00c0\u00c0Rate has an estimated coefficient of variation .30% (indicating instability) before and after adjustment for clustering.\nMSA, metropolitan statistical area.\nii34 Bossarte, Simon, Barker\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nconsidered to have a given characteristic if it is indicated in\nany of the available data sources. Some NVDRS data lack the\ncontextual information necessary for a complete considera-\ntion of differences.

Fisher's exact test was used when\nexpected cell counts were less than 5.\nRESULTS\nAmong all incidents included in the NVDRS data, homicide/\nsuicide incidents are a relatively rare occurrence. In 2003,\nwith seven states reporting, there were 65 homicide/suicide\nincidents including 84 homicide victims (homicide rate =\nThe NVDRS allows a calculation of the percentage of all\nhomicides that are followed by suicide.

Overall, there were few\nsignificant differences among incident rates when the\ncharacteristics of homicide victims were considered. Young\nchildren and adolescents were significantly less likely than\nthose over the age of 65 years to die from a homicide in a\nhomicide/suicide incident in 2004. There were no other\nsignificant age differences among homicide victims in\nhomicide/suicide incidents when compared to those over\nthe age 65 in either year. There were also no significant racial\nor ethnic differences among homicide victims when com-\npared to non-Hispanic white victims. There are significant\ndifferences in the age adjusted rate of homicide victims\nhomicides among females was significantly higher than the\nrate for males; with the rate for females in both years being\nover twice the rate for males. While the majority of homicide\nvictims lived in a metropolitan area, the age adjusted rate of\nvictimization for both metropolitan and micropolitan area\nresidents was not significantly different from those living in\nnon-metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).\nTable 2 provides a comparison of characteristics of\nhomicide victims and perpetrators for the years 2003 and\n2004 combined.

Members of these age groups were also likely to\nwere 29 multiple victim incidents. Seventy six percent of\nthese incidents (n = 22) involved victims younger than 25\nyears of age and 48% (n = 14) involved at least one person\nhomicide victims younger than 15 years of age involved in 23\nhomicide/suicide incidents. In 17 (73.9%) of those incidents\nthe perpetrator was identified as a parent.\nA parent was identified as the suspect for five homicide/\nincluding two incidents with more than one victim under 15.\nIn four (80.0%) of these incidents, including both multiple\nvictim homicide/suicide incidents, the perpetrator was\nsuicide incidents involving children under the age of 15 years;\nincluding three multiple victim incidents. The mother was\nidentified as the perpetrator for eight (66.7%) of these\nincidents; including all three incidents involving more than\none victim under the age 15.\nThe majority of victims and perpetrators involved in\nhomicide/suicide incidents were non-Hispanic white.\nSlightly more than 20% of perpetrators and victims were\nidentified as African American. Of note, the percentage of\nAfrican Americans involved in homicide/suicide incidents is\nhigher than their representation in participating states\n(approximately 16.7% in both years). There were no\nsignificant racial or ethnic differences between homicide\nvictims and perpetrators.\nThere were few marital status differences between perpe-\ntrators and homicide victims. Perpetrators were significantly\nmore likely than victims to be widowed and victims were\nsignificantly more likely to be single. About one in three\nvictims and perpetrators were married at the time of the\nincident.\nPerpetrators of homicide/suicide incidents were significantly\nmore likely than homicide victims to have a high school\neducation or to have not completed high school at the time of\nthe incident. Small percentages of perpetrators and victims had\ncompleted a graduate or professional degree. There were no\nsignificant differences in college or advanced degrees.\nPerpetrators of homicide/suicide were not significantly more\nlikely than victims to test positive for either illegal drugs or\nalcohol during postmortem toxicological evaluations.\nThe distribution of homicide victims by their relationship\nto the perpetrator is shown in table 3. Homicide victims in\nintimate partner violence incidents were significantly more\nlikely to have been killed by a current or ex-spouse,\nboyfriend, or girlfriend. For homicides involving other family\nmembers, the incident was significantly less likely to be\nrelated to intimate partner violence than to some other factor.\nRegardless of intimate partner violence status, the majority of\nhomicides occurred within either the victim's or perpetrator's\nhome. There were no significant differences in location when\nintimate partner violence related and other types of incidents\nwere compared. ``Mercy'' killings, where one individual kills\nanother to end his/her suffering, were rare. Mercy killings\nwere identified using an abstractor coded variable based on\navailable information including incident narratives. There\nwere seven homicides determined to be mercy killings with\nSome situational factors associated with a homicide/suicide\nincident included whether the incident was associated with\njealousy (that is, a ``lovers' triangle''), whether more than one\nvictim was involved, and if the suicide occurred in the same\nlocation as the homicide. Only four (1.9%) homicide/suicide\nfew involved more than one victim (13.9%). Most suicides\n(82.2%) following a homicide/suicide incident occurred in the\nsame location as at least one of the homicides.\nAs shown in table 4, specific situational factors associated\nwith suicide were recent legal problems (25.3%), a job or\nfinancial problem (9.3%), or some other relationship problem\nnot related to IPV (8.8%). While only 7.2% were known to\nhave ever been treated for mental health problems, 11% had\nTable 3 Relationship and location characteristics of homicide victims, 2003\u00ad04\nIPV incidents,\nOther incidents,\nRelationship to perpetrator*\nLocation\n*Relationship information was not available for 8 IPV-related and 14 other incidents.\n\u00c0Chi square test of differences significant at 0.05 or greater.\n`Fisher's exact test of differences significant at 0.05 or greater.\nTable 4 Key characteristics of suicide following\nCharacteristic\nNumber of incidents,\nHistory of previous suicide attempts 5 (2.6%)\nCircumstance associated with the suicide\nOther relationship problem (not IPV) 17 (8.8%)\nMental illness\nDrugs/alcohol\nHistory of drug or alcohol abuse or dependency19 (9.1)\n*Circumstance information was not available for 15 suicides.\nii36 Bossarte, Simon, Barker\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nevidence of a current mental illness and 8.6% were\nconsidered depressed at the time of the incident.

Specifically, the findings that most\nhomicide victims in homicide/suicide incidents are female\nand most homicide perpetrators are male, that over half\n(58%) of the victims are current or former intimate partners\nof the perpetrator, that less than 5% of homicide/suicide\nincidents occur between strangers, that most homicide/\nsuicide incidents (82.3%) occur in a residence, and that most\ndeaths (81.6%) result from a gunshot wound are all\nconsistent with past research on homicide/suicide.3 14 15 As\nis the case in other studies, the majority of incidents are\nattributed to IPV, a substantial proportion include the\nhomicide of a child, and a small proportion can be attributed\nto ``mercy'' killings.\nThe finding that 30.6% of all male perpetrators of intimate\npartner homicide ultimately ended their own lives highlights\nthe importance of both IPV and suicidal ideation in under-\nstanding the factors contributing to risk for homicide/suicide.\nThe circumstance information available in the NVDRS provides\ninsights into the nature of the homicide/suicide incidents and\ncontributes to the growing body of literature on potential risk\nfactors for homicide/suicide. The fact that 11% of perpetrators\nhad documented mental illness at the time of the incident and\n29% tested positive for drugs or alcohol is consistent with past\nresearch documenting the importance of mental health and\nsubstance abuse disorders in predicting risk for suicidal\nbehavior and violence.3 5 Also, the finding that one in four\nperpetrators had experienced legal problems, nearly one in 10\nhad experienced job or financial problems, and approximately\none in 16 had experienced physical health problems that were\nassociated with their suicide underscores the importance of\nsituational factors for exacerbating risk. Those who work with\nvictims or perpetrators of IPV, suicidal patients, and those\ncaring for seriously ill family members should be alert for\nsituational stressors that may contribute to the possibility of\nviolence or suicide. The current results, combined with those\nfrom other studies, also underscore the importance of\nprevention programs and policies that increase the availability\nof treatment for mental health and substance abuse problems,\nthe accessibility of shelters for victims of IPV, and the\nenforcement of existing domestic violence laws.10\nThis manuscript provides basic descriptive information\nabout the prevalence of homicide/suicide and the character-\nistics of the people involved. Additional research is needed to\nunderstand how the demographic factors and experiences of\nthe people involved in homicide/suicide incidents differ from\nthose involved in homicide-only or suicide-only incidents. A\nbetter understanding of the similarities and differences in\nthese incidents can help guide the development of prevention\nprograms and policies.\nThere are several limitations that should be considered\nwhen making conclusions from these results. First, although\nthe use of multiple data sources enhances the accuracy of the\ndata in the NVDRS, it is still possible that some homicide/\nsuicide incidents were not identified in the system. Thus, the\nrates calculated are likely an underestimate of the true\nprevalence. Second, the operationalization of homicide/\nsuicide used in the current study does not include incidents\nwhere law enforcement officers used lethal force against a\nhomicide offender because of the offender's actions (for\nexample, raising a firearm at an officer), although some have\nsuggested that such incidents could be included as homicide/\nsuicide.28 Third, the data on the behavioral and mental health\nhistory of perpetrators are subject to error from both a lack of\ninformation routinely reported in official records and the\nabsence of detailed individual histories obtained during case\ninvestigations. When detailed histories are available the\nsource of information may be a family member or close\nfriend and are of unknown accuracy. While it is likely that\nreports of the presence of behaviors or symptoms are\naccurate, the absence of this information does not necessarily\nmean that the behaviors or symptoms did not occur.\nThe consistency of the NVDRS results with those from past\nstudies on homicide/suicide and the comprehensive informa-\ntion available about the characteristics of all the people\ninvolved in these incidents highlight the promise of the\nNVDRS for studying homicide/suicide incidents. Previous\nefforts to describe the epidemiology of homicide/suicide\nincidents have frequently relied on manual record linkages3\nor systematic reviews of newspaper accounts.16 The NVDRS\nallows for easy identification of homicide/suicide incidents by\nkeeping the homicide and suicide linked within an incident. As\nmore years of data become available and the number of states\nincluded in the NVDRS system continues to increase, this\nsystem will provide an efficient mechanism for monitoring\ntemporal changes in homicide/suicide prevalence, describing\nTable 5 Weapon type for homicides and suicides\nWeapon used to inflict injury Homicide n = 248 (%) Suicide n = 209 (%) All victims n = 457 (%)\nHomicide followed by suicide ii37\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nthe characteristics of homicide/suicide victims, perpetrators,\nand incidents, comparing rates across states, and evaluating\nthe impact of prevention programs and policies.\nIn conclusion, although homicide/suicide is a rare incident,\neach incident results in at least two deaths and frequently\nincludes the death of a child. While other countries have\nnational surveillance systems that capture homicide/suicide\nincidents, the US does not.29 Researchers have called for the\ndevelopment of a national system in the US to permit\nprospective monitoring of the prevalence and epidemiology of\nhomicide/suicide.4 30\u00ad31 The NVDRS has the potential to\ndevelop into a system that can be used for these purposes.\n"
