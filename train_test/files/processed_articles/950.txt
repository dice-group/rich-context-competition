Design and Methods: Telephone surveys were\nconducted with employers representing 615 nursing\nlow-income participants aged 40\u00fe in Operation ABLE\nemployment and training organizations. A total of\nResults: Low-income older workers were interested in\nparaprofessional careers in long-term care. More were\ninterested in home health care jobs than working in\nnursing homes. Job titles that most interested these\nworkers were infrequent in nursing homes. Many\nworkers perceived their health status as sufficient for\nfrontline work. The majority was interested in career\nadvancement opportunities and went to senior centers\nand places of worship to seek employment. Industry\nemployers had many positive perceptions of older\ndirect care workers, but there were real and perceived\ndeterrents to hiring older workers. The most prominent\ndeterrents were employers' perceptions that older\nworkers have higher health care costs and are less\nwilling to use technology. Implications: Policy makers\nshould target Title V funds toward training low-income\nolder workers for long-term care jobs, particularly in\nusing mechanical devices and long-term care technol-\nogies. Employment and training organizations should\nadd coursework in long-term care technologies, learn\nabout legal issues in targeting advertising to low-\nincome older workers, and educate employers about\nways to reach these prospective employees. Older\nworkers can use information about employers' percep-\ntions when seeking employment.\nKey Words: Workforce, Low income, Title V,\nNursing home, Home health care\nU.S. Census data reveal the sobering fact that the\n25- to 44-year-old population is not growing suffi-\nciently to replace workers who will soon be retiring.\nAccording to U.S. Census data, the population of\nyears of age grew by only 2%. Economic projections\nindicate that a workforce at least the same size as the\ncurrent workforce or larger will be needed over the\nnext decade (U.S. General Accounting Office, 2001). It\nwill be critical that older workers remain engaged in\nthe workforce to help offset the low replacement\nnumber. Employers must rethink their hiring policies\nand strategies for recruiting and retaining workers,\nas they have to increasingly turn to older Americans\nto fill the gap in the labor supply (U.S. General\nWhile the number of older Americans grows, their\neconomic problems grow as well. In 2000, the mean\nincome for persons 65 years and older who reported\n(U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). For many adults, staying\nemployed or returning to employment is increasingly\nbecoming a necessity rather than a choice.\nAARP conducted a national study of 2,518\nthis workforce intends to work after they retire from\ntheir current jobs (Montenegro, Fisher, & Remez,\n2002). The study also revealed a variety of motiva-\ntions for working after the age of 45, including to\nearn income, to maintain or obtain health care\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the following Operation\nABLEs for their help throughout this study: Operation ABLE of\nMichigan, Operation ABLE of Greater Boston, Operation ABLE\n(Chicago), Vermont Associates for Training and Development, Career\nEncores, Operation ABLE of Southeast Nebraska, and the Jewish\nCouncil for the Aging of Greater Washington.\nKaren Kosniewski is now with Junior Achievement of Southeastern\nMichigan, Detroit.\nAddress correspondence to Melanie Hwalek, President and Founder,\nE-mail: mhwalek@specassociates.org\n1SPEC Associates, Detroit, Michigan.\n2Operation ABLE of Michigan, Detroit.\n90 The Gerontologist\ncoverage, to contribute to society, to help people,\nand to continue to have a sense of belonging and\nAt the same time that there is an expanding group\nof older workers willing or needing to work, the\nneed for paraprofessional workers in the long-term\ncare industry is reaching a crisis level. In a review of\nthe research on long-term care workers, Harris-\nKojetin, Lipson, Fielding, Kiefer, and Stone (2004)\nconcluded that there are ``unprecedented vacancies''\n(p. 1) among direct care workers in most states.\nEmployee turnover has long plagued this industry,\nbut now employee availability is increasingly be-\ncoming the first concern (Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation and Atlantic Philanthropies, 2003).\nThere is a clear need to find available and\nqualified persons willing to take frontline jobs\noffered by nursing homes and home health agencies.\nWhat research has not addressed is whether the older\nworkforce represents a viable pool of candidates for\nthese usually low-wage direct care jobs. In fact,\nHarris-Kojetin and colleagues' (2004) review noted\nthat the typical direct care worker is younger than\nage 54, the mean age of home care aides declined\nhome care and nursing home aides are not much\nmore than minimum wage.\nOperation ABLE organizations could be pipelines\nfor filling direct care jobs in the long-term care\nindustry if low-income older workers are interested,\nable to perform in these jobs, and are placed into the\nmost appropriate frontline jobs to match their\ninterests and abilities. Operation ABLEs are employ-\nment and training organizations specializing in the\nrecruitment, training, and redeployment of older\nworkers (those aged 40\u00fe) into the workforce. Many\nOperation ABLEs began in the 1960s when Title V of\nthe Older Americans Act was passed. Title V\nprovides assistance to low-income older workers\ninterested in being trained in 21st-century workplace\nskills. To be eligible to receive training and\nemployment-related support under Title V, an in-\ndividual must be aged 55\u00fe and have an income no\nmore than 125% of the poverty guidelines established\nby the Office of Management and Budget (``Public\njob seekers are low-income older people actively\nseeking to be retrained and redeployed into the\nworkforce. Given this participant pool, Operation\nABLEs were a logical context for studying the\nalignment of low-income older workers' employment\nneeds with the needs and requirements of lower\npaying jobs in the long-term care industry. Although\nOperation ABLE participants may be just the right\nworkforce to fill some of the need for long-term care\nworkers, little, if any, research has examined the\ninterest of this population in this type of work.\nRecent research has addressed employers' percep-\ntions of older workers. Although some research found\ngenerally positive attitudes from employers about\ntheir older workforce (e.g., Munnell, Sass, & Soto,\n2006), other studies, such as Barth, McNaught, and\nRizzi (1996), indicated that employers have concerns\nabout hiring or retaining older workers, including\nfears of lost productivity, higher employee health\ninsurance costs, and greater absenteeism (Barth et al.,\n1996). These concerns may be even greater among\nlong-term care employers because frontline work is\nphysically demanding. We found no published studies\nspecifically on long-term care employers' interest in\nhiring older workers for direct care work.\nThis study aimed to develop a deeper understand-\ning of the needs, wants, and concerns of low-income\nolder workers regarding their choices about working\nwithin the context of long-term care. It also looked\nat the perceptions that long-term care employers\nhave about older workers. This study contributes\nsignificantly not only to recruitment strategies and\nworkforce designs to attract and retain low-income\nolder workers, but also to policy and program\ndevelopment that affects training and subsidized\nemployment dollars.\nStudy Questions\nThe data presented here are part of a larger study\nof the perceptions of Operation ABLE participants\nand long-term care employers about the use of older\nworkers in frontline jobs in nursing homes and home\nhealth agencies. The study answered the following\nsubset of questions, and we present the results here:\n1. What aspects of direct care work in long-term\ncare appeal to low-income older workers and\nwhy?\n2. What unique attributes can older workers bring\nto long-term care jobs?\n3. What recruitment strategies work best in attract-\ning low-income older workers to long-term care?\n4. What are the training issues and physical\nchallenges unique to hiring older workers?\n5. What do employment and training providers\nneed to do to meet the training requirements of\nthe long-term care industry?\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThere were multiple components to this study\ninvolving both focus group and survey research\nmethods. Seven states were included in the study:\nCalifornia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mich-\nigan, Nebraska, and Vermont. These states were\nselected because the executive directors of Operation\nABLEs in these states had a history of networking\ntogether to address older worker issues, and they\nwere very interested in jointly contributing to\na national study. Although these seven states were\na convenience sample, they represent diversity in\nterms of geographic location. The sample included\nboth urban and rural locations, as well as the\neastern, western, and middle United States.\nPreliminary Focus Groups\nThe study began with nine preliminary focus\ngroup interviews involving long-term care employers\nand low-income older workers in three of the study\nstates: Michigan, Nebraska, and California. Three\nfocus groups were conducted in each state, one with\neach of three study groups: nursing home employers,\nhome health agency employers, and low-income\nolder workers participating in Operation ABLE. In\ntotal, 9 employers from nursing homes, 17 employers\nfrom home health agencies, and 40 low-income older\nworkers engaged in the focus groups. Employer focus\ngroup participants were randomly selected from the\npublicly available lists of certified nursing homes and\nhome health agencies available from the Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services. In light of the\ndistance they would have to travel to get to the focus\ngroups, only facilities within a 2 hr driving distance\nfrom the focus group site were invited to participate.\nThe 40 low-income older workers were all aged 40\u00fe\nand were recruited by staff of the Operation ABLE\nagencies. They represented a convenience sample of\nparticipants who would be eligible to participate in\nthe large-scale telephone survey (according to the\nrequirements described in ``Low-Income Older\nWorker Survey''). Employers were given an incentive\nto participate. Employers were paid different\namounts in different states, between $50 and $125,\nbased on the distance they would be expected to\ntravel. Older workers were given $40 for their\nparticipation plus parking expenses if needed. Some\nof the employers donated their compensation to\ntenant/resident council funds at their agencies.\nThe purpose of the preliminary focus groups was\nto identify issues related to the research questions\nthat would need to be addressed in the telephone\nsurveys with workers and employers. Prior to the\nfocus groups, the research team reviewed several\nsurvey questionnaires and publications related to\nfrontline workers in long-term care. (Documents\nreviewed during the design of the survey instruments\nincluded Bell, 2001; Hams, Herold, Lee, & Worters,\nKnowledge Systems and Research, n.d.; Livingston,\nExpenditure Panel Survey, 1998; Paraprofessional\nfrom this review was presented as background\ninformation during the focus groups. Focus group\nparticipants were then asked to discuss each of the\nresearch questions. Responses from the focus groups\nwere used to develop closed-ended responses to\nsimilar questions created for the telephone surveys.\nLow-Income Older Worker Survey\nWorkers eligible for the telephone survey were\nthose aged 40 or older, who were at or below 125% of\nthe income associated with the federal government's\ndefinition of poverty, who were or had been enrolled\nin an Operation ABLE retraining and redeployment\nprogram, and who consented to be interviewed\nOperation ABLEs invited eligible workers to partic-\nipate in the study. At each Operation ABLE, staff\nused a standard set of recruitment materials and\nconsent forms that had been approved by an\ninstitutional review board for the protection of\nhuman research participants. Interested workers\ncompleted and signed a consent form that was faxed\nto SPEC Associates, the research firm responsible for\ndata collection and analysis. A total of 1,291 workers\nconsented to be interviewed. The exact percentage of\nolder workers that these consenting respondents\nrepresented is unknown. Each Operation ABLE had\nagreed to target the number of eligible older workers\nthat they expected to serve during the study period.\n(Executives of Operation ABLEs met at the beginning\nand end of the study and maintained communication\nthrough e-mail so they could provide input in the\ndevelopment of procedures and questionnaires [mostly\nfor the worker survey]. They also contributed their\ninterpretations of the data.) However, budget cuts\nand other factors resulted in some Operation ABLEs\nlooking to their past participants to meet their quota.\nA total of 1,091 interviews were completed.\nOf the 1,091 Operation ABLE survey respondents,\nanalyses reported here. Although the 40\u00fe population\nis the official government designation for the class of\nworkers protected under the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act, the interest of consumer organi-\nzations such as AARP is on the 50\u00fe population, and\nTitle V targets workers aged 55\u00fe. Therefore, the\nseven Operation ABLEs believed that the results\nwould be more informative to policy makers if the\n55\u00fe population was the first focus of analysis. Future\nanalyses will compare the survey responses of those\nthe survey.\nTable 1 shows the demographic characteristics of\nthe 55\u00fe low-income older workers sampled.\nAs shown in Table 1, the survey sample was\ndiverse in terms of gender and ethnicity. Notable is\nthat 61% of the survey participants reported attain-\ning more than a high school diploma. Only 7% re-\nported not completing either high school or a general\nequivalency diploma.\nProfessional interviewers trained in the use of this\nstudy's particular survey instruments conducted\n92 The Gerontologist\ninterviews over the telephone. Respondents were\npaid $25 for participating in the survey. The survey\nquestionnaire for low-income older workers covered\nthe following topics:\n Where respondents are likely to go or what they read\nwhen looking for a job;\n If there is a greater likelihood that respondents would\napply for a job if the notice uses phrases such as\nretirees welcomed, mature worker, or senior\ncitizen, or if the job offers various characteristics or\nbenefits;\n Whether respondents have health insurance coverage\nfor themselves, including Medicaid or Medicare, and\nif the coverage is through their spouse or partner's\njob;\n Past experience in regular care of an infant/small\nchild, or someone physically disabled, mentally\nimpaired, or seriously ill;\n If respondents rely on public transportation to get to\nand from a job;\n Health conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems,\nor back problems, that limit the kind of work\nrespondents can do;\n Respondents' perceptions of their functional abilities,\nsuch as walking a mile, standing for 1 hr, stooping,\nreaching, and using their fingers to pick up things;\n Current work status and pay;\n Preferences of work hours and minimum expected\nstarting pay for a job involving the care of\na physically disabled or mentally impaired person;\n Days of work missed at current or previous job\nbecause of health problems, transportation, caring\nfor someone who was sick, or lack of child care;\n Interest in several types of caregiving jobs differen-\ntiated by type of task (hands on, supervisory,\nemotional support) and by job title (direct care\nworker, feeding assistant, medication assistant,\nactivity aide, rehab aide, bathing assistant);\n Work setting preferences (e.g., client's own home,\nnursing home, or other institutional setting); and\n Willingness to attend a 75-hr training program to\nbecome certified to work as a direct care worker and\nexpectation for financial compensation to attend the\ntraining.\nNursing Home Survey\nNursing homes eligible for the survey were all\nfacilities listed on the Centers for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services publicly available list of certified\nnursing homes. A total sample of 891 nursing homes\nwas randomly selected by state. Random numbers\nwere created and assigned sequentially to each home\non each state's list. The list was then sorted, and the\nfirst 891 nursing homes listed were chosen to be\ncontacted. Letters were sent to the human resources\nmanagers of the selected facilities explaining the\nstudy and inviting them to participate. Nursing\nhomes that were listed and chosen for the sample,\nbut in actuality no longer existed, were replaced with\nother nursing homes listed.\nMost respondents were administrators or direc-\ntors of human resources at their respective agencies.\nA total of 615 respondents participated in the survey.\nBecause some respondents owned several nursing\nhomes, each was asked to respond with respect to\nthe one facility that was listed in the invitation letter\nthat they received.\nTable 2 shows how the nursing home employers\ndescribed their organizational structure and\nworkforce.\nNursing homes were diverse in structure, as\n47% of the nursing home employers reported that\ntheir organization was part of a chain, 40% reported\nthat theirs was independently owned and operated,\nand 13% reported theirs as being part of a larger\nsystem of health care services. The majority (57%)\nreported their organization as being for profit.\nVirtually all of the nursing homes (99%) employed\ndirect care workers on an hourly basis. Very few\nhad salaried (5%) or contractual (6%) direct care\nworkers. Finally, 19% of the nursing home employ-\ners said that their direct care workers were\nrepresented by a union.\nNursing home employers were not asked about\nthe certification of their direct care workers because\nin all of the sampled states, direct care workers in\nnursing homes were required to be certified. This\nmeans that they have completed at least 75 hours of\ntraining and have passed a certification test mandated\nby the state.\nThe same trained professional interviewers who\nconducted the interviews with other study samples\nconducted telephone interviews with nursing home\nemployers. The survey questionnaire covered the\nfollowing topics:\n Description of the agency (profit status, organiza-\ntional structure);\n Description of the agency's direct care workforce\n(total, number 55 or older, tenure of older workers);\n How often and where direct care workers are\nrecruited;\n Agency's targeting of recruitment toward workers\naged 55\u00fe and the success of these efforts;\nTable 1.

This was because employers were\nasked, specifically, to compare older and younger\ndirect care workers. Because direct care work is\ntypically a lower paying position, the research team\nfelt it would unnecessarily complicate the interview\nto ask employers to focus only on the low-income\ndirect care workforce that was 55 years or older.\nHome Health Agency Survey\nHome health agencies eligible for the survey were\nall organizations on the Centers for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services publicly available list of certified\nhome health agencies. The sample of 642 home health\nagencies was randomly selected using the same\nstrategy as for the nursing home sampling described\nin the previous section. Letters were sent to the\nhuman resources managers of the selected agencies\nexplaining the study and inviting them to participate.\nA total of 410 respondents participated in the survey.\nTypically they were the owners or directors of human\nresources at their respective agencies.\nAs shown in Table 2, few (8%) of the home health\nagency employers described their organizations as\nbeing part of a chain. Agencies were almost equally\ndivided between being independently owned and\noperated (43%) and being a part of a larger system of\nhealth care services (45%). More were nonprofit\nBecause certification of home health agency direct\ncare workers is not mandatory, these survey respon-\ndents were asked about the certification of their\nfrontline workforce.A total of 81% of the respondents\nreported that their direct care workforce consisted\npredominantly of certified workers (see Table 2).\nThe survey questionnaire for the home health\nagencies was essentially the same as the question-\nnaire used to interview nursing home employers.\nHowever, the research team realized during the pilot\ntesting of the questionnaire that many home health\nagencies employ both certified and noncertified\ndirect care workers. Because there could be differ-\nences between certified and noncertified direct care\nworkers in terms of wage scales and other character-\nistics, it was important to be clear about which type\nof worker the employer should be referring to as they\nanswered the survey questions. So as not to over-\ncomplicate the interview by asking the same ques-\ntions twice (once in relation to certified workers\nand again in relation to noncertified workers), the\nresearch team decided to ask home health agencies\nhow many certified and noncertified direct care\nworkers they employed. The interviewer was in-\nstructed to ask the survey questions relative to the\npredominant type of direct care worker employed by\nthe home health agency. If the number of certified\nTable 2.

This was to ensure\nthat there would be enough home health agencies in\nthe noncertified group to compare wage rates\nbetween certified and noncertified direct care work-\ners. Certain questions (e.g., about certification\ntraining) were asked specifically about certified direct\ncare workers regardless of the predominance of these\nworkers at the agency.\nTable 3 shows the number of survey respondents\nfrom each group from each state. The variation in the\nnumber of nursing homes and home health agencies\nfrom each state largely reflected the populations of\nnursing homes and home health agencies in each\nstate. The variation in the number of low-income\nolder workers from each state resulted from a number\nof factors. Some Operation ABLEs were more\nrigorous than others in recruiting potential study\nparticipants. Additionally, some Operation ABLEs\nhad more funding for their low-income older worker\ntraining programs and therefore had more potential\nstudy participants than others.\nInterpretive Focus Groups\nAfter completion of the surveys, focus group\ninterviews were conducted with a sample of low-\nincome older workers who participated in Operation\nABLE and with employers from nursing homes and\nhome health agencies in Vermont, Illinois, Massa-\nchusetts, and Maryland. One focus group with each\nrespondent type was conducted in each state. The\nsampling frames for the focus groups with nursing\nhome and home health agency employers were\nemployers located within approximately 100 miles\nfrom the focus group sites who responded to the\ntelephone surveys. Eligible telephone survey re-\nspondents were sent letters inviting them to partic-\nipate in the focus groups. Those employers who\nattended the focus groups from these agencies were\nnot necessarily the same individuals who completed\nthe telephone surveys.\nBecause the Operation ABLE staff were to recruit\nworkersforthefocusgroups,andthetelephonesurveys\nwere confidential (i.e., staff could not be told who did\nor did not respond), the sampling frame for the focus\ngroups with low-income older workers was current\nOperation ABLE clients aged 40 to 70 who had an\nincome within 125% of the federal guidelines defining\npoverty level, who could speak and understand\nEnglish, and who represented, to the extent possible,\nas diverse a group as possible in ethnicity, physical\nability, and gender. Each Operation ABLE was asked\nto recruit no more than 12 low-income older workers\nfor the focus groups. The research team prepared\na recruitment script approved by an institutional\nreview board and gave it to Operation ABLE staff.\nAs with the preliminary focus groups, both\nemployer and older worker participants were given\nfinancial compensation for their participation. Em-\non the distance they had to travel. Workers were\npaid $40 as well as parking expenses if needed.\nIn total, there were 12 employers of nursing\nhomes, 12 employers of home health agencies, and\n48 Operation ABLE participants in the focus groups.\nThe purpose of the focus groups was to obtain\ninsights about the interpretation of the survey results.\nParticipants were shown charts and graphs of the key\nstudy findings. Operation ABLE participants were\nasked to discuss what the older worker survey results\ntold them about (a) how to find a job, (b) where or\nhow to get themselves trained for this job, and (c)\nwhat agencies need to do to keep them happy in the\njob. These three questions were posted on large paper\nto be easily viewed by the group members.\nDuring the focus groups with employers of\nnursing homes and home health agencies, partic-\nipants were shown the results from their respective\nsurveys and asked to discuss the results in response\nto four key questions: (a) Should (nursing homes/\nhome health agencies) recruit mature workers as\ndirect care workers? (If yes, why? What is the best\nway to recruit mature workers?) (b) What is the best\nway to train mature workers as direct care workers?\n(c) What could (nursing homes/home health agen-\ncies) do to retain mature workers in direct care\npositions? (d) Should public money be spent on\nrecruiting, training, or retaining mature workers for\nTable 3. Survey Samples by State\nHome Health Agencies Nursing Homes\nLow-Income\nOlder Workers\nState Count % Count % Count %\ndirect care positions? (If yes, what is the best way to\nspend public money on recruiting, training, or\nretaining mature workers?)\nData Analysis\nFor all three telephone surveys, descriptive statis-\ntics were the predominant analyses used. When\ncomparisons were made between nursing homes\nand home health agencies, ``meaningfulness'' was\nthe criteria used to identify major differences, rather\nthan inferential statistics. The research team decided\nthat a difference between groups of 10% or greater\nwould constitute a meaningful difference. Differences\nthat were 10% or greater were also tested using chi-\nsquare and t tests and did, in fact, achieve statistical\nsignificance. The reason for the focus on meaning-\nfulness is that, given the large sample sizes in each\ngroup, even small differences of a few percentage\npoints would likely be statistically significant. The\nresearch team believed that it was more important to\nset a concrete standard for representing differences\nthat were meaningful to the reader rather than to\nbeset the study with numerous reports of statistical\nsignificance.\nResults\nEight key findings were supported by the data and\nare organized here according to the study questions.\nWhat Aspects of Direct Care Work in\nLong-Term Care Appeal to Low-Income\nOlder Workers and Why?\nFinding 1: Older Workers Are Interested in\nParaprofessional Health Careers.--In all, 43% of\nthe low-income older workers expressed an interest\nin direct care work. A total of 60% indicated that\nthey would like to work 30 hours or more per week,\nand 55% said that they would attend a 75-hr\ncertification training to become a direct care worker.\nMore (69%) said they would like to work in\nsomeone's own home as compared a nursing home\nor other institutional setting (57%). Particularly\ninteresting is the finding that 86% of these low-\nincome older workers reported an interest in career\nadvancement opportunities.\nFinding 2: Frontline Jobs in Home Health\nAgencies Are More Appealing to Older Workers\nThan Are Direct Care Jobs in Nursing Homes.--As\nmentioned earlier, the majority of older workers\nreported that they were interested in working in\nsomeone's own home (69%). A lesser number\nreported an interest in working in a nursing home\nor other institution (57%). When respondents were\nasked about specific job tasks, most popular jobs\nwere those more likely to be found in home health\nagencies. For example, 76% of older workers said\nthey were interested in supervisory tasks such as\nteaching someone how to dress themselves, guiding\nsomeone to walk somewhere, or reminding someone\nto take medication. The majority (69%) also said\nthey were interested in emotional support tasks, such\nas sitting by someone's side, calming down an upset\npatient, or giving someone a hug or touch for\nsupport. Notably fewer workers (28%) said that they\nwere interested in hands-on tasks, such as bathing,\ndressing, helping someone eat, clipping toenails, or\ntransferring someone from a bed to a wheelchair.\nHome health agencies were more likely than\nnursing homes to match worker interests and\nabilities with clients. In the employer surveys, 48%\nof home health agencies compared with 19% of\nnursing homes reported differentially assigning\nclients to workers based on the physical strength of\nemployees. Similarly, 50% of home health agencies\ncompared with 25% of nursing homes reported\ndifferentially assigning clients to workers based on\nother characteristics of the workers.\nWhen asked about their 55\u00fe certified nursing aide\n(CNA) workforce, nursing home employers re-\nported, on average, that 18% of their certified\nworkers were aged 55\u00fe. This compared with an\naverage 55\u00fe population of 27% among the home\nhealth agency employers.\nA comment from a home health agency employer\ncorroborated the survey data suggesting that home\nhealth agency settings are more amenable to older\nworkers than nursing homes. This person remarked,\n``I get a lot of people coming from the nursing home\nsaying that they just can't do it anymore. The lifting,\nthat it's too demanding, and they go into home care\nbecause it's less demanding.''\nFinding 3: Frontline Jobs in Nursing Homes That\nInterest Older Workers Are Infrequent Job Positions\nin Nursing Homes.--Low-income older workers\ntended to be more interested in the job positions of\nactivity aide, medication assistant, or rehab aide\nthan in the position of direct care worker. Survey\nresults revealed that 74% of low-income older\nworkers reported that they would be interested in\na job as an activity aide, described in the question-\nnaire as someone who plays games, does crafts with\npeople, and helps the activity director prepare and\nconduct special events. Similarly, 67% reported that\nthey would be interested in a job as a medication\nassistant, described as someone who helps people\nonly with their medicine, giving it to them or helping\nthem take it. Also, 58% of workers reported that\nthey would be interested in a job as a rehab aide,\ndescribed as someone who helps people only with\nphysical therapy, such as practicing walking or\nexercising. Moreover, 52% reported that they would\nbe interested in a job as a feeding assistant, described\nas someone who works in a nursing home or other\n96 The Gerontologist\ninstitutional setting only helping people to eat or\nfeeding people who are unable to feed themselves. In\ncontrast, only 27% of workers reported that they\nwould be interested in a job as a bathing assistant,\ndescribed as someone who helps people only with\nbathing when they cannot bathe themselves.\nAccording to the nursing home employers, very\nfew nursing homes had job positions of medication\nassistant (26%), bathing assistant (14%), or feeding\nassistant (8%). Although the majority of nursing\nhomes had job positions for activity aide (81%) and\nrehab aide (63%), according to employers in the\ninterpretive focus groups, typically there are only\none or a few of those positions in a nursing home.\nOne employer explained, ``[The job] is at the nursing\nhome, but there's maybe only like one person that's\na paid position.''\nEmployers in focus groups also reported that these\njob positions are often given as perks to frontline\nworkers who have seniority.\nWhat Unique Attributes Can Older Workers\nBring to Long-Term Care Jobs?\nFinding 4: Nursing Homes and Home Health\nAgencies Have Very Positive Perceptions of Older\nWorkers.--Except for their perceived willingness to\nuse new technology, the majority of employers\nreported positive differences between their direct\ncare workers who are aged 55\u00fe and younger\nworkers. Figure 1 shows the list of characteristics\nthat 50% or more of the employers reported workers\naged 55\u00fe are more likely to have, in comparison\nwith younger workers. As Figure 1 shows, with\nregard to work behaviors, employers reported their\n55\u00fe workers to be more loyal, independent, knowl-\nedgeable, motivated, and more likely to act as team\nplayers and be independent problem solvers. With\nregard to clients, employers reported their 55\u00fe\nworkers to be more understanding and patient,\nhave greater desire to care for the sick and disabled,\nand be better able to communicate and gain the trust\nof clients.\nSimilarly, most of the characteristics that employ-\ners reported their 55\u00fe workers are less likely to have\nreflect positively on their older workforce. As shown\nin Figure 2, 50% or more of employers reported that\ntheir 55\u00fe workers were less likely than younger\nworkers to leave within 10 days of training, leave\nwithin 90 days of hire, have background check\nproblems, have caregiving responsibilities that in-\nterfere with work, be absent from work, or leave to\ntake a job with higher pay or benefits. The only\nnegative characteristic that employers perceived\nmore often in their 55\u00fe workers is that older\nworkers are less likely to be willing to use technol-\nogy, such as computers or palm pilots.\nFigure 1.

Figure 3 shows the top two places\nwhere employers recruit and low-income workers\nlook for jobs (newspapers and friends of employees).\nFigure 3 also reveals the largest differences between\nwhere employers recruit and where low-income\nolder workers find jobs. Only 8% of nursing home\nemployers and only 14% of home health agency\nemployers reported that they were likely to recruit at\nsenior centers. However, 80% of the low-income\nolder workers reported being likely to look for jobs\nat senior centers. Similarly, only 16% of nursing\nhome employers and 23% of home health agency\nemployers reported being likely to recruit in bulletins\nfrom churches, synagogues, mosques, or other places\nof worship. In contrast, 66% of low-income older\nworkers said they were likely to look for employ-\nment at these places of worship.\nWhat Are the Training Issues and Physical\nChallenges Unique to Hiring Older Workers?\nFinding 6: There Are Real and Perceived\nDeterrents to Hiring Older Workers.--The deter-\nrents to hiring older workers that emerged from both\nthe survey and interpretive focus groups were the\nfollowing: (a) perceptions that health care costs\nwould increase, (b) perceptions that age discrimina-\ntion laws restrict targeted recruiting, (c) low-income\nworkers' reliance on public transportation, (d)\nworkers' worries about the availability or cost of\nCNA certification training, (e) employers' perceptions\nof technological illiteracy among older workers, and\n(f) workers' relatively high wage expectations.\nAlthough 70% of nursing home employers and\n74% of home health agency employers said that they\nare willing to use terms such as older worker and\nsenior citizen in advertising for older workers, only\n3% of nursing home employers and only 6% of\nhome health agency employers targeted recruiting to\n55\u00fe workers. When this inconsistency was discussed\nduring the interpretive focus groups, employers\npointed to health care costs and laws barring age\ndiscrimination.\nRegarding health care costs, during the interpre-\ntive focus groups some employers commented that\nolder workers utilize health care to a greater extent\nthan younger workers. Some reported having\ncorporate pressure to hire younger workers because\nof the increased health insurance costs associated\nwith hiring older workers. The validity of the claim\nof increased health care costs for older workers was\nquestioned by one nursing home employer, who\ncommented as follows:\nI don't know if you can believe what insurance\ncompanies tell you [regarding] how they are under-\nwriting.. . . They supposedly say you are community\nrated based on the age and sex of your workers.\nThat is supposedly the only thing they offset for. I\ncan't believe that in the age of computers . . . they\ndon't have programs that are writing down all the\nclaims they have come in on all the workers in the\nprevious, last year, 2 years. But you know, one of\nthe detriments I think is more general [other than\nage] . . . when you have women of childbearing age.\nThat is a costly workforce to afford from a health\ninsurance standpoint, and [women of childbearing\nage] makes up a large part of our workforce.\nIn the low-income older worker survey, 66% of\nworkers reported having health care coverage,\nincluding Medicare or Medicaid, and typically this\ncoverage was not through their spouses' jobs. The\nsurvey did not differentiate whether older workers'\ncoverage was through Medicaid, Medicare, personal\npay, or an employer.\nFigure 3. Common places for employers to recruit direct care\nworkers and for older workers to look for jobs.\n98 The Gerontologist\nRegarding laws barring age discrimination, em-\nployers in both the surveys and the focus groups\nnoted that they had been told by their human\nresources or legal departments that a phrase such as\nolder workers welcomed would violate Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) reg-\nulations. Therefore, although they were willing to\nuse these terms, their perception was that it would be\nillegal to do so.\nAn objective deterrent to hiring low-income older\nworkers was their reliance on and the limited\navailability of public transportation. In the low-\nincome older worker survey, 34% of the workers\nsaid that they rely on public transportation. This\ncompared with only 5% of the 50\u00fe population in\na recent AARP research report (Ritter, Straight, &\nEvans, 2002). In a similar vein, a nursing home\nadministrator lamented during a focus group that\npublic transportation was the biggest cause for\nemployee turnover, regardless of age:\nTransportation is a huge thing, because at my\ncenter, we are not on a reliable bus transportation\nsystem, we have [name of bus route], and it's not\nreliable, because the last bus that leaves our center is\nand then the bus comes like maybe right at 7:00. So,\nit's very difficult to retain employees, because the\nonly means of transportation is either [to] rely on\nanother aide or someone else or to catch a cab,\nand the amount of money it costs them to catch\na cab is not even conducive to what we pay them\nan hour. . . . Now, they are contemplating removing\nour bus line entirely, so that is going to reduce a lot\nmore employees.\nCNA training requirements was another possible\ndeterrent to hiring older workers. Regarding CNA\ntraining, 56% of nursing home employers and 78%\nof home health agency employers said that all of\ntheir direct care workers were already certified when\nthey applied for work. As specified earlier, 55% of\nolder workers indicated a willingness to attend a\n75-hr training program to become a CNA. However,\nsome workers in the focus groups commented that\nthey were concerned about the costs of training, and\nsome worried that they could not keep up with\nintensive educational coursework. They made com-\nments such as ``I think it's scary for some people to\nhave to think . . . `Here I am, at my older age, and . . .\nI have to get training.' Now that would be scary.''\nAs indicated previously, in the employer surveys,\n59% of nursing home employers and 57% of home\nhealth agency employers believed that older workers\nwere less likely than younger workers to be willing to\nuse a computer, palm pilot, or other technological\ndevice to record information. This conformed with\nrecent research by AARP (2000) that senior-level\nhuman resource executives perceive older workers as\nresistant to learning new technologies.\nFinally, the average hourly wage for direct care\nworkers may dissuade older workers from seeking\nemployment in long-term care. In the older worker\nsurvey, wage expectations for direct care work\naveraged $10/hr. This is more than the $8/hr average\nwage of personal care aides reported in research by\ncare aides and $7/hr for nursing home aides reported\nin Harris-Kojetin and colleagues' (2004) review.\nFinding 7: Stereotypes About Physical Capacity\nShould Not Dissuade Long-Term Care Employers\nFrom Looking at Older Workers for Frontline\nWork.--Employers in the interpretive focus groups\nindicated that age is not the major criteria that they\nuse when assessing the functional abilities of potential\ndirect care workers. Rather, they look at charac-\nteristics regardless of age. For instance, one com-\nment made by a nursing home employer suggested\nthat obesity can be a barrier for workers of any age:\nYou see a lot of the older folks that are doing these\njobs . . . are overweight [which] contributes to the\nconcerns about their day-to-day function. And if we\nwere to go about employing older workers, especially\nfor that kind of work . . . I would pay attention to\nwhether the individual was overweight. . . . If\nsomeone is overweight the demands that are placed\nupon them tend to be of a greater concern.\nSome employers indicated during the interpretive\nfocus groups that they do a functional assessment of\npotential employees prior to making the hiring\ndecision. There were variations among focus group\nemployers in the extent of their functional assess-\nment or whether the assessments were validated.\nThe majority of workers reported being able to do\nall of the physical functions needed in direct care\nwork (see Figure 4). However, one employer noted\nduring the interpretive focus group that the survey\ndata appeared to be liberal estimates of the capacities\nof older workers. The ``real'' question was whether\na worker could do these functions for extended\nperiods of time, day after day.\nEmployers in the interpretive focus groups also\nsaid that many functional limitations could be\nminimized with the appropriate use of mechanical\ndevices. They noted that training and/or retraining,\nas well as enforcing the use of mechanical devices,\nare all very important. Although they noted that\nmechanical devices are expensive, the cost might be\noffset by the savings related to fewer work injuries.\nEmployers also talked about the importance of\nmechanical devices for the safety of the employee.\nComments from nursing home employers in two\ndifferent focus groups were illustrative of this:\nThe mechanical devices that are available for use in\na given facility and the facility's enforcement of [the\nuse of] those . . . if those devices are available, and\nthe individuals are required or forced to use them\nthrough some reasonable protocols . . . that in itself\nshould play into the lessening of concerns about\nhow those individuals create wear and tear in their\nbodies, and I think [it] reduces concerns about age\nin some respects.\nIf older workers are to be retained, public policy\nmight suggest that public money should be spent on\nbetter approaches to ergonomics and other tools\nthat will let them do their jobs more safely.\nWhat Do Employment and Training Providers\nNeed to Do to Meet the Training Requirements\nof the Long-Term Care Industry?\nFinding 8: Employment and Training\nOrganizations Can Reduce Technological Barriers\nto Employing Older Workers in Nursing Homes\nand Home Health Agencies.--Survey results in-\ndicated that employers believe older workers are less\nwilling to learn to use new technologies. Survey\nresults also found that very few employers know\nabout the technology training provided by Operation\nABLEs or access federal monies available to support\nemployment training for older workers.\nAs mentioned previously, the majority of employ-\ners, both from nursing homes (59%) and home\nhealth agencies (57%), said that their 55\u00fe direct care\nworkers are less willing to use a computer, palm\npilot, or other device to record information. About\none third of the employers, both from nursing homes\n(28%) and home health agencies (36%), said that\ntheir 55\u00fedirect care workers are less likely to be able\nto learn new technologies. Fewer than half of the\nemployers, both from nursing homes (46%) and\nhome health agencies (33%), said that in the past 5\nyears they recruited direct care workers for perma-\nnent employment from employment and training\norganizations. Only 10% of nursing home employers\nand 13% of home health agency employers were\naware of the Operation ABLEs in their localities.\nOnly 7% of nursing home employers and 4% of\nhome health agency employers reported having\nreceived public money in the past 5 years to support\nthe recruiting, training, or retaining of direct care\nworkers, regardless of age. When employers did\naccess money, most often funds came from their\nrespective state governments (72% of nursing home\nemployers and 67% of home health agency employ-\ners who received public funds).\nDiscussion\nLow-Income Older Workers Are a Promising\nPool of Potential Frontline Workers\nStudy results suggest that there is some promise in\nlooking to low-income older workers to fill the need\nfor direct care workers in long-term care. As\nMontenegro and associates (2002) found in their\nAARP national study, this study also discovered that\nthere is motivation among the older population to\ncontinue working into their older years. These older\nworkers may be particularly suited for jobs in home\nand community care settings where employers match\nclients to the needs and interests of workers.\nHowever, many of the low-income older workers\nsampled in this study also indicated interest in\ninstitutional work settings.\nStudy results revealed that low-income older\nworkers are more interested in supervising someone\ndoing tasks of daily living and in providing\nemotional support to clients, rather than doing\nhands-on tasks. They are also interested in more\nhighly skilled jobs, such as activity aide, medication\nassistant, and rehab aide.\nA significant number of Operation ABLE partic-\nipants surveyed have post-high-school education and\ntherefore may be able to perform well in these types\nof jobs. Similarly, the vast majority of low-income\nolder workers surveyed in this study are interested\nFigure 4. Percentage of workers aged 55\u00fe reporting no\ndifficulty.\nin career advancement opportunities. Taken to-\ngether, the study results support the idea of targeting\nlow-income older workers for frontline work in\nnursing homes and home health agencies.\nOperation ABLEs Provide Essential Services in\nPreparing Low-Income Older Workers for\nFrontline Work in the Long-Term Care Industry\nThis study supported findings from the studies of\nMunnell and colleagues (2006), Barth and associates\nand negative perceptions of employers about older\nworkers. According to the employers surveyed, many\npositive attributes make older workers attractive as\nemployees. The one negative attribute employers\nascribed to older workers was their lack of\nwillingness to learn new technologies. Yet technol-\nogy training is exactly the area in which Operation\nABLEs excel. These results suggest that Operation\nABLEs can provide a valuable service, specifically for\nthe long-term care industry, by making desirable\nemployees even more desirable by reducing their\ntechnological limitations.\nOlder Workers Bring Many Positive\nCharacteristics to Long-Term Care Employers\nOne positive attribute of the low-income older\nworkers included in this study is their interest in\ncareer advancement opportunities. Nursing homes\nand home health agencies that offer career ladders\nmight use this feature of their workplace to attract\nlow-income older workers. Harris-Kojetin and\ncolleagues (2004) also found career ladders to be\nbeneficial in long-term care, particularly in staff\nretention. Advancement in career is very feasible in\nthe study population, as 61% have education beyond\ntheir high school diplomas. This level of education is\nwell above that of typical direct care workers as\nBoth of these studies found fewer than 40% of direct\ncare workers in nursing homes and home care aides\nhad completed at least some college.\nAnother positive attribute of the low-income\nworkers in this study is that the majority reported\nhaving health care coverage, including Medicare or\nMedicaid. This suggests that employers' fears about\nhaving higher health care costs if they hire more\nolder workers may be unfounded. More information\nis needed about insurance regulations related to\nhigher health care premiums for older workers to\ndraw further conclusions on this issue. Consider-\nation of how insurance companies use age as a factor\nin calculating insurance premiums and the savings\nthat accrue from smaller turnover and fewer\npersonal days that employers attribute as character-\nistics of older workers would be useful information\nto gather, but this was beyond the scope of this\nstudy. It may be that increased insurance premiums\nare more than offset by recruitment and training\ncosts saved when older workers are employed.\nConcerns Exist Regarding the Recruitment of\nLow-Income Older Workers for Frontline\nWork in the Long-Term Care Industry\nStudy findings suggest that low-income older\nworkers look for jobs in many of the same places\nwhere long-term care employers advertise. More\nnoticeable among older workers, as opposed to\nemployers, is the seeking of job opportunities at\nsenior centers and places of worship. A wider and\nmore diverse recruitment net may need to be cast to\nfind older workers interested in long-term care jobs.\nThis study found that employers were willing to\nadvertise specifically for older workers, and older\nworkers would respond favorably to such adver-\ntising. However, very few employers indicated that\nthey target their recruiting efforts to the 55\u00fe\nworkforce. Some employers fear that they would be\nliable under EEOC laws if they targeted recruitment to\nolder workers in their advertisements. Increased\ntargeting of older workers in recruitment efforts\nrequires further investigation of the conflicting focus\nof the EEOC and the Age Discrimination in Employ-\nment Act. Because workers aged 40 and older are\nprotected by the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct, it is not clear whether advertising specifically\nfor older workers would violate EEOC regulations.\nGiven this age discrimination concern of employ-\ners, whether warranted or not, Operation ABLEs\nmight advise potential employers about ways to be\nwelcoming to older workers without using exclu-\nsionary terms in their recruitment materials. Alter-\nnatively, if employers post job announcements at\nsenior citizen centers, there would be no need to use\nterms that might violate EEOC regulations. By\nsimply building relationships with Operation ABLEs\nthat are funded by Title V, employers could easily\ntap into the low-income older population for\npotential employees. It may require some effort on\nthe part of Operation ABLE public relations staff to\neducate employers about the existence and mission\nof these organizations, as very few of the employers\nin this study were aware of their local Operation\nTraining Needs to Be Tailored to Adequately\nPrepare Older Workers for Long-Term Care\nWork and Address Their Particular Needs\nIn addition to the technology training described\npreviously, older workers wanting to pursue work in\nnursing homes need to complete their state's re-\nquired CNA training program. Study results found\nthat the majority of low-income older workers\nsampled are willing to complete this intensive\ntraining. Another training issue not necessarily\nunique to older workers but relevant to any worker\nwith physical limitations is the proper use of assistive\ndevices, such as mechanical lifts.\nOne advantage of studying the low-income older\nworkers who participate in Operation ABLE pro-\ngrams is that this population is self-contained and\neasy to access through the network of Operation\nABLEs. These workers may also be easily identifiable\nat other employment and training organizations that\nhave age and/or income eligibility requirements.\nPublicly funded workforce programs could capitalize\non this easy-to-access older workforce, coupled with\nthe technology training provided by Operation\nABLEs, to fill the need for direct care workers.\nIn order to do technology training, however, one\nmust identify the specific technology needs of nursing\nhomes and home health agencies. Operation ABLEs\nmay need to enhance the technology in their\nclassrooms to include more portable devices, such\nas laptop computers and personal digital assistants,\nas well as software commonly used in the long-term\ncare industry. This would require an investment of\ndollars in new technologies and processes. What\nneeds further investigation is whether these upgrades\nin technology, assessment, and training would be\nallowable expenditures under the Workforce In-\nvestment Act and/or Title V dollars.\nOperation ABLEs can help to employ older\nworkers in long-term care in other ways that also\nfit their mission. They can develop or identify\na functional assessment tool based on employer\nneeds and screen participants for the ability to do\nfrontline work in nursing homes and home health\nagencies. They can partner with health care training\nproviders to provide low-cost certification training\ntailored to the learning styles of older workers. They\ncan focus job search activities on long-term care jobs\nand educate their program participants about the\npositive perceptions that employers have about older\nworkers. Indeed, study results found that most of the\nlong-term care employers hire older workers who are\nalready trained rather than providing their own\ncertification training. Offering a pool of older\nworkers already trained, not only in direct care\nhands-on work but also in leading-edge technologies,\ncould reduce employers' perceptions that older\nworkers are less willing to learn new technologies.\nThe Sample of Low-Income Older Workers in\nThis Study May Not Be Representative of the\nPopulation\nOne limitation of this study is that it is unknown\nhow representative the low-income older workers\nwho completed the survey are of the broader\ncommunity of low-income individuals who are\naged 55 or older. It is still unknown whether other\nlow-income senior citizens have as high a level of\ninterest in long-term care jobs as those Operation\nABLE participants included in this study. Operation\nABLEs serve only a fraction of the 55\u00fe population,\nand only those who have taken action to become\nretrained and redeployed in the workforce. There-\nfore, Operation ABLEs are a very small pipeline for\npreparing low-income older workers for frontline\nwork in long-term care. If the study population is\nrepresentative of all low-income senior citizens,\na much larger system of recruitment, assessment,\nand training could be established in order to realize\nthe potential of low-income older workers in\nmeeting the needs for frontline workers. If the study\npopulation is unique in its interest in long-term care\njobs, older workers may not provide as big an\nopportunity for shrinking the gap in frontline\nworkers as this study suggests.\nRecommendations for Policy Makers\nStudy findings point to several ways that policy\nmakers can increase the use of older workers in\nfilling the need for frontline workers in long-term\ncare. One concrete way is to target Title V funds\ntoward specialized training of older workers for jobs\nin long-term care. This study found that most\nemployers in long-term care hire workers who are\nalready certified. Low-income older workers' com-\nments during the focus groups indicated that some\nfear they cannot afford the costs of the 75-hr\ncertification training, and some lack confidence in\ntheir ability to complete a rigorous training program.\nTitle V specialized training funds can be targeted to\nincrease the pool of direct care workers who are aged\n55 and older by paying for the tuition costs of\ncertification training and the development of certi-\nfication programs that are tailored to the learning\nstyles of older workers and that will build workers'\nconfidence in learning new skills.\nAnother way policy makers can help fill the gap in\nfrontline workers is by targeting federal faith-based\ninitiative dollars toward recruitment efforts at places\nof worship. The majority of workers in this study\nsaid that they would look for job openings in\nbulletins at their churches, synagogues, mosques, or\nother places of worship. Thus, it seems that this\npopulation of older workers would be of interest to\nfederal faith-based employment placement initia-\ntives. It seems appropriate for faith-based job\ntraining initiatives to focus some effort on educating\nlong-term care employers about the employment\nneeds and wants of their low-income older congre-\ngation members. It also seems appropriate for faith-\nbased initiative dollars to be targeted toward\nrecruitment and training of congregations specifically\nfor long-term care industry jobs.\nPolicy makers can develop or strengthen policies\nrequiring employees to use mechanical devices and to\nbe adequately trained in the proper use of these\ndevices. A clear message from this study is that age\nitself is not the main deciding factor in employers'\ndecisions to hire direct care workers. It is also clear\nthat mechanical devices can be used both in nursing\nhomes and in the community to greatly reduce\nincidents of workplace injuries and allow older\nworkers with less physical strength to effectively\nperform frontline work. Employers voiced that\nalthough these devices are expensive, the expense\nmay be offset by the reduction in injury-related costs.\nThis study did not investigate current policies\nrequiring the use of mechanical devices, but it seems\nthat a good use of public money would be to help\nemployers purchase mechanical devices. Alternatively,\ntax incentives could be created to encourage\nemployers to use such devices. Good policy would\nrequire that employees be trained in the use of these\ndevices and be required to use them in an appro-\npriate and caring manner.\nPolicy makers can investigate how state workforce\ndevelopment funds can support direct care worker\ninitiatives. Results clearly show that very few long-\nterm care employers have accessed any public money\nto recruit, train, or retain direct care workers. When\nemployers did access public money, most often the\nfunding came from the state. This study did not\ninvestigate whether the state funds originated from\nfederal money. In any case, it appears that direct care\nworker initiatives may be more successful in\nadvocating for support locally rather than federally.\nWorkforce investment boards, for example, might be\none mechanism for obtaining resources to develop\na system to screen for the physical capacity of older\nlong-term care job candidates and for giving grants\nto agencies to cover the cost of certification training.\nMuch can be done to further the development of\nthe low-income older workforce in a way that helps\nto fill the shortage of frontline workers in long-term\ncare. This study offers many insights into directions\npolicy makers, employers, and employment and\ntraining organizations can take to expand the long-\nterm-direct care labor force using low-income older\nworkers.\nReferences\nAARP.
