Current smoking and having histories of diabetes and cardiovascular disease\nwere also associated with an increased risk for vitamin D deficiency (P < 0.05). Conclusions. Among women of childbearing age,\npericonceptional intervention programs may focus on multiple risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy to ultimately\nimprove their vitamin D nutrition.\n1. Introduction\nVitamin D, a lipid-soluble vitamin or steroid prehormone,\nis known to play an important role in bone metabolism\nthrough regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis.\nDuring the past few years, the influence of vitamin D on\nnonskeletal biologic processes has been expanded to a wide\narray of health outcomes including cardiovascular disease,\ninsulin resistance and diabetes, cancer, respiratory infection,\ninnate and adaptive immunity, and both cardiovascular and\nall-cause mortality [1\u00ad9].\nFor women of childbearing age, maternal vitamin D mal-\nnutrition imposes multiple health impacts on both women\nand their offspring [10\u00ad12]. Adequate vitamin D concen-\ntrations during pregnancy help ensure appropriate maternal\nand fetal calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism [11,\n12]. Consequently, vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy\nhas been associated with impaired fetal skeletal formation\ncausing infant rickets and reduced bone mass [13\u00ad15]. In\naddition, low maternal vitamin D concentrations have been\nassociated with spontaneous preterm birth and impaired\nembryonic and fetal development (including skeletal, brain,\nand immunological function development) resulting in\nsmall-for-gestational-age infants [16\u00ad18]. Moreover, child-\nhood vitamin D deficiency, which is strongly associated with\nmaternal vitamin D deficiency [19, 20], has been linked to\nincreased risk for multiple conditions including respiratory\nschizophrenia [25]. For maternal health, a low vitamin D\nlevel impairs maternal skeletal preservation and is asso-\nciated with increased risks for osteomalacia, osteoporosis,\nmiscarriage, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and bacterial\nLimited evidence has shown that pregnant women and\nneonates residing in the northern USA are at high risk\nfor vitamin D insufficiency regardless the use of vitamin\nsupplementation [10, 29]. A recent study reported that about\n69% of pregnant women and 78% of nonpregnant women\n2  \nin the USA had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]\nconcentrations below 30.0 ng/mL [30]. In those studies, how-\never, the 25(OH)D cut-point values defined as indicative of\ndeficiency or insufficiency varied significantly and was lack of\nconsensus. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently released\nnew definitions for vitamin D deficiency (i.e., 25(OH)D\na large, nationally representative sample of US women, the\npresent study aimed to (1) examine the prevalence of vitamin\nD deficiency and inadequacy among women of childbearing\nage based on the new IOM definitions and (2) identify\npotential factors including sociodemographics, dietary and\nlifestyle-related behaviors, health conditions, and healthcare\nutilization that may have predisposed women to increased\nrisk for vitamin D deficiency or inadequacy. We believe this\ninformation is valuable for women's health care providers\nincluding obstetricians and gynecologists to provide better\ncounseling for women of childbearing age concerning their\nneed for vitamin D.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Study Design. Data for this analysis came from the 2003-\n2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES), which uses a multistage stratified sampling\ndesign to collect data from the noninstitutionalized civilian\nUS population on a 2-year cycle basis. Survey participants\nwere initially interviewed at home and then invited to a\nmobile examination center (MEC), where they received vari-\nous examinations and provided blood samples for laboratory\nhuman subjects were approved by the Research Ethics Review\nBoard of the National Center for Health Statistics and written\ninformed consent was obtained from all participants. Details\nabout the NHANES survey design and methods are reported\n2.2. Participants and Measurements. We examined interview\nand laboratory data from female participants aged 20\u00ad44\nyears. The pregnancy status of a woman was determined\nas (1) current pregnancy which was confirmed either by\na positive laboratory pregnancy test or by a self-reported\npregnancy at the time of MEC exam, (2) nonpregnant with\na history of pregnancy, and (3) never pregnant. Participants\nwhose pregnancy status could not be ascertained were\nexcluded from our analyses.\nParticipants' serum specimens were frozen and stored at\n<\u00ad70C until analysis. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D\nwere measured using the DiaSorin radioimmunoassay proce-\ndure (DiaSorin Corporation 25(OH)D 125I RIA kit, DiaSorin\nCorporation, Stillwater, MN), which has been described in\ndetail in the laboratory procedure manuals of the NHANES\nwebsite [32]. The 25(OH)D assay has a sensitivity of\n1.5 ng/mL; the coefficient of variation ranged from 8.9%\nThe demographic covariates in our analyses were par-\nrace/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nMexican American, and other), and education level (<high\nschool diploma, high school graduate or equivalent, and\n>high school diploma). Major food sources of vitamin\nD intake were assessed by asking participants how often\nin the previous 30 days they had consumed milk (never,\n>0 to <1 time/day, and 1 time/day), or they had eaten\nfish (never, >0 to <2 times/week, and 2 times/week).\nPotential sunlight exposure was assessed using the 6-month\ntime period during which they were examined (categorized\nas November 1 through April 30 and May 1 through\nOctober 31). Dietary supplement use was assessed by asking\nparticipants whether they had taken any dietary supplements\nduring the previous month (yes, no). Body mass index\n(BMI) for currently pregnant women was calculated from\nself-reported, prepregnancy weight and height, and the BMI\nfor nonpregnant women was calculated from measured\nweight and height following standardized protocol and\nstatus was categorized as current smokers (participants who\nhad smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and\nwere still smoking) and nonsmokers (participants who had\nsmoked less than 100 cigarettes during their lifetime or\nthose who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their\nlifetime but had stopped). Physical activity was calculated\nas an average daily metabolic equivalent task (MET)-hour\nindex that summed transportation, household, and leisure-\ntime physical activity, and participants were dichotomized as\nhaving physical activity (MET-hour index >0) and physically\ninactive (MET-hour index = 0). Alcohol consumption was\ncategorized as any alcohol users (participants who had an\naverage daily drinks of >0 during the past 12 months) and\nabstainers (for whom the average daily drink was equal to\n0 in the past 12 months). Healthcare access was assessed by\nasking participants: (1) whether they were covered by health\ninsurance or some other kind of health care plan including\nthose obtained through employment or purchased directly\nas well as government programs like Medicare and Medicaid\nthat provide medical care or help pay medical bills (yes, no),\nand (2) whether, during the past 12 months, they had seen a\ndoctor or other health care professional about their health at\na doctor's office, a clinic, hospital emergency room, at home\nor some other place (yes, no).\nThe medical conditions assessed in the study were hyper-\ntension, physician diagnosed diabetes and cardiovascular\ndisease (including coronary heart disease, angina pectoris,\nmyocardial infarction, and stroke), and current asthma. The\nmean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP)\nwere established by using the average of the last two readings\nof SBP or DBP for participants whose blood pressure was\nmeasured three or four times, or using the last reading for\nparticipants whose blood pressure was measured twice, or\nusing the only reading for participants whose blood pressure\nwas measured only once. Participants who reported taking\nantihypertension medications or who had SBP 140 mmHg\nor DBP 90 mmHg were defined as having hypertension\n[33].

After further excluding those who had missing values\nfor their 25(OH)D concentrations or other study covariates,\n1,814 women remained in our analyses. The estimates for the\nmean concentration of serum 25(OH)D and the prevalence\nof vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy were weighted and\n44 years. We used log-linear regression models with robust\nvariance estimator to estimate unadjusted and multivariate-\nadjusted prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals\n(CIs). We used a Bonferroni corrected P value for multiple\ncomparisons and used SUDAAN (Software for the Statistical\nAnalysis of Correlated Data, Release 9.0, Research Triangle\nInstitute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to account for the\ncomplex sampling design.\n3. Results\nOf all study participants, 435 were currently pregnant and\n1,034 reported having a history of pregnancy. Their mean\nother racial/ethnic group. About 14.6% of women had less\nthan a high school education, 21.2% were high school\ngraduates or equivalents, and 64.2% attained an educational\nlevel of greater than a high school diploma.\nCI: 23.0\u00ad25.1 ng/mL), the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency\nThese measures did not differ significantly by age (Figure 1).\nBy race/ethnicity, the mean 25(OH)D concentration was\nthe highest among non-Hispanic white women and the\nlowest among non-Hispanic black women (Bonferroni\ncorrected P < 0.008, Figure 1(a)). Conversely, the prevalence\nof vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy was lowest among\nnon-Hispanic white women (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)) and the\nprevalence of vitamin D deficiency was the highest among\nnon-Hispanic black women (Figure 1(b)). By educational\nlevel, the mean 25(OH)D concentration increased linearly\n4  \n(Figure 1(a)), whereas the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency\nand inadequacy decreased linearly (P < 0.001 for linear\ntrends, Figures 1(b) and 1(c)). By pregnancy status, the mean\n25(OH)D concentration was higher among pregnant women\nthan among those in the other two groups (Bonferroni\ncorrected P < 0.017, Figure 2); the prevalence of vitamin\nD deficiency and inadequacy was lower among pregnant\nwomen than among women with a history of pregnancy\nBy race/ethnicity, the multivariate-adjusted prevalence\nratio for vitamin D deficiency was 8.3 times as high among\nnon-Hispanic black women, 4.1 times as high among Mexi-\ncan American women, and 5.4 times as high among women\nin other racial/ethnic groups as among non-Hispanic white\nwomen (P < 0.001 for all, Table 1); the adjusted prevalence\nratio for vitamin D inadequacy was also significantly higher\nin these groups (1.8\u00ad2.8 times as high as in non-Hispanic\nwhite women, P < 0.001 for all, Table 1). By BMI status,\nthe adjusted prevalence ratios for vitamin D deficiency and\ninadequacy were 1.7 times and 1.9 times as high, respectively,\namong women who were obese (BMI  30.0 kg/m2) as\namong women with a normal BMI (P < 0.001 for both).\nAdditionally, the adjusted prevalence ratio for vitamin D\ndeficiency was 1.5 times as high among women with diabetes,\n2.3 times as high among women with cardiovascular disease,\nand 1.4 times as high among women who were current\nsmokers as among their respective counterparts.\nIn contrast, milk consumption 1 time/day, dietary sup-\nplement use, and potential sunlight exposure during May-\nOctober were significantly and independently associated\nwith lower prevalence ratios of vitamin D deficiency and\ninadequacy (P < 0.05 for all, Table 1). Current pregnancy\nwas marginally associated with a lower prevalence ratio of\nvitamin D inadequacy (P = 0.051). Although education\nof >high school diploma, physical activity, any alcohol use,\ninsurance coverage, and having had a health care visit\nwere all associated with decreased likelihoods of vitamin\nD deficiency and inadequacy in unadjusted models, they\nwere not significant contributors to the full models when\ncontrolling for all study covariates.\n4. Discussion\nOur study on a large, nationally representative sample\ndemonstrated that applying the new IOM definitions pre-\ndicted a lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and\ninadequacy than that was reported previously [29, 30].\nOur results showed that more than one-third of women\nof childbearing age had their vitamin D status below an\noptimal level (i.e., 20.0 ng/mL [31]) in the United States.\nMore importantly, we found that multiple factors were\nindependently associated with suboptimal levels of vitamin\nD among these women.\nSignificant changes in maternal vitamin D and cal-\ncium metabolism occur during pregnancy. For example,\na study has reported that serum concentrations of 1,25-\ndihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], the active form of\nvitamin D, increased by 50\u00ad100% from the nonpregnant\nCurrently pregnant\nWith a history of pregnancy\nNever pregnant\nMean 25(OH)D (ng/mL)\nPrevalence (%)\nVitamin D\ndeficiency\nVitamin D\ninadequacy\nFigure 2: Age-adjusted mean concentrations (with 95% CIs) of\nserum 25(OH)D and the age-adjusted prevalence (with 95% CIs)\nof vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy by pregnancy status among\nstate to the second to third trimesters of the pregnancy\n[34]. A longitudinal study conducted in Caucasian women\nof the United Kingdom showed that plasma 25(OH)D\nconcentrations were lower among pregnant women than\namong nonpregnant controls [35], a finding that may\nbe largely explained by increased fetal demand for this\nessential nutrient which is almost entirely dependent on\nvitamin D from the mother [18, 19]. However, results from\nother cross-sectional studies have shown, similar to our\nfindings, that pregnant women have a higher mean 25(OH)D\nhigher 25(OH)D concentrations among pregnant women are\nlikely due to higher rates of dietary supplement use (i.e.,\nthan among nonpregnant women.\nOur study showed that multiple factors were associated\nwith suboptimal vitamin D status in women of childbearing\nage. The significant racial/ethnic disparities that we found in\nthe prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/inadequacy were in\nagreement with those reported previously both in the general\npopulation as well as in pregnant women, showing non-\nHispanic whites had the highest adjusted mean 25(OH)D\nconcentration, followed by Mexican Americans, and non-\nHispanic blacks had the lowest [30, 36\u00ad38]. Our results fur-\nther demonstrated that, among US women of reproductive\nage, those who were non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,\nor of other racial/ethnic groups were all at a higher risk, to the\nsimilar magnitude, for vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy\nthan non-Hispanic white women.\nIn the human body, about 50\u00ad90% of vitamin D comes\nfrom the biosynthesis of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in\nthe skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol that requires sunlight\n(ultraviolet radiation), and the remainder comes from\n  5\nTable 1: Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy among\nCharacteristic\nVitamin D deficiency Vitamin D inadequacy\nN Unadjusted Adjusted Unadjusted Adjusted\nDemographic\nAge (yrs)\nRace/ethnicity\nEducation\nPregnancy status\nDiet and supplementation\nMilk consumption\nFish consumption\nDietary supplement use\nExamination period\nBody mass index (kg/m2)\nChronic condition\nHypertension\nDiabetes\nCardiovascular disease\n6  \nTable 1: Continued.\nCharacteristic\nVitamin D deficiency Vitamin D inadequacy\nN Unadjusted Adjusted Unadjusted Adjusted\nAsthma\nLifestyle-related behavior\nCurrent Smoking\nPhysical activity\nAny alcohol use\nHealthcare access\nInsurance coverage\nHealthcare visit\n\nPrevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using log-linear regression models without and with adjustment for all other variables listed\nin the table; women with serum 25(OH)D 20 ng/mL was used as the referent.\nSelf-reported prepregnant weight and height were used to calculate body mass index (BMI) for pregnant women, and measured weight and height were\nused to calculate BMI for nonpregnant women.\na limited number of foods (mainly fatty fish, eggs, and\nliver as well as foods fortified with vitamin D such as\nmargarine, cereals, and milk products) and from dietary\nsupplements. A previous study based on data from the\nconsumption, and dietary supplement use were significant\nand independent determinants of hypovitaminosis D in\nwomen of childbearing age [39], which is consistent with\nthe findings of the present study. Fish consumption can be\na major source of vitamin D intake. Lym and Joh recently\nreported that frequent fish consumption was associated with\na higher vitamin D level among Korean men [40]. Brock et\nal. also reported that a high fish intake was associated with\nexposed to negligible solar UV light in winter [41]. In the\npresent study, however, this relationship was not significant\nin women of childbearing age. Thus, future research on the\nrole of fish consumption in improving vitamin D nutrition is\nwarranted.\nLow vitamin D levels are linked to increased risk for\nhigh blood pressure, insulin resistance and diabetes, and\ncardiovascular disease in the general population [2, 6\u00ad9].\nSimilarly, among women of childbearing age, we found\nthat having a history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease\nwas significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency (but\nnot vitamin D inadequacy) independent of other factors.\nThus, women with these conditions should be assessed and\ncounseled for their vitamin D status during their routine\nhealth care visits.\nMultiple health-related behavioral factors have been\nshown to affect pregnancy outcomes. For example, physical\ninactivity in mothers is associated with increased risks for\nobesity and obesity-related chronic conditions such as dia-\nbetes mellitus and hypertension, and pregnant women who\nare obese are at increased risk for miscarriage, pregnancy-\ninduced hypertension and preeclampsia, gestational dia-\nbetes, and thromboembolism, and at an increased risk of\nhaving children with macrosomia, spontaneous intrauterine\ndemises, or delivered by Cesarean section which carries\nan increased risk for wound infection [42\u00ad44]. Maternal\nalcohol use and cigarette smoking have been associated\nwith a higher rate of infertility, spontaneous abortion or\npreterm birth, fetal alcohol syndrome (characterized by\ngrowth deficiencies, central nervous system impairment,\nbehavioral disorders, and impaired intellectual devolvement\nwith lifelong implication), and facial dysmorphia [45\u00ad48].\nThus, maintaining healthy lifestyles is especially important\nfor women of childbearing age. Previous studies have\nconsistently reported low serum vitamin D concentrations in\npeople with a high BMI [38, 49, 50], results consistent with\nour finding that BMI of  30.0 kg/m2 was an independent\npredictor of vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy among\nwomen of childbearing age. Smoking has been associated\nwith a low bone mass and an increased risk for osteoporotic\n  7\nfracture [51]. Brot et al. further reported that middle-aged\nwomen who were current smokers had significantly reduced\n[52]. Our results also showed that smoking was indepen-\ndently associated with vitamin D deficiency in women of\nchildbearing age. However, we found that other behavioral\nfactors such as physical activity and alcohol drinking were\nnot significant determinants of vitamin D status.\nNutritional assessment, education, and counseling are\nimportant components of periconception care. In the present\nstudy, although the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency\nand inadequacy decreased linearly across educational levels,\neducation was not a significant contributor to the models\nafter controlling for potential confounders. Also, we found\nthat increasing use of health care services was not a\nsignificant determinant of vitamin D status either. However,\nthese findings should be viewed with caution because the\neffectiveness of nutritional education and counseling was not\nassessed in this study.\nThis study has several limitations. First, the causal\nrelationships between factors and vitamin D deficiency/\ninadequacy cannot be established from our cross-sectional\nstudy design. Second, the drift in serum 25(OH)D measure-\nments over the time has been reported. However, we did not\nfind significant differences in the prevalence of vitamin D\nmay not have been affected in a meaningful way by the\nvariability of serum 25(OH)D assay [53].\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that achieving\nan optimal vitamin D level remains a distant target for\nwomen of childbearing age in the United States. Given that\nadequate vitamin D concentrations in pregnant women are\nassociated with healthy reproductive outcomes, periconcep-\ntional intervention programs may focus on raising vitamin\nD levels in these women and efforts to prevent vitamin\nD deficiency-linked health outcomes should begin during\nroutine gynecologic care prior to conception and continue\nthrough the postpartum period. The multiple risk factors for\nvitamin D deficiency and inadequacy that we identified in\nthis study should be useful in identifying at-risk groups of\nwomen who may be targeted by these programs.\nDisclaimer\nThe findings and conclusions in this paper are those of the\nauthors and do not represent the official position of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.\nReferences\n[1] F.
