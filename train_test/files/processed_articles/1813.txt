Scrimshaw, United Nations University, Thornton, NH, October 18, 2007 (received for review June 1, 2007)\nIn a recent study of older participants (age >60 years) in the\n(NHANES), we showed that a combination of high serum folate and\nlow vitamin B12 status was associated with higher prevalence of\ncognitive impairment and anemia than other combinations of\nvitamin B12 and folate status. In the present study, we sought to\ndetermine the joint influence of serum folate and vitamin B12\nconcentrations on two functional indicators of vitamin B12 status,\ntotal homocysteine (tHcy) and methylmalonic acid (MMA), among\nwere pregnant, had evidence of kidney or liver dysfunction, or\nreported a history of alcohol abuse or recent anemia therapy left\nticipants for the study. Multivariate analyses controlled for demo-\ngraphic factors, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, self-\nreported diabetes diagnosis, and serum concentrations of\ncreatinine and alanine aminotransferase revealed significant in-\nteractions between serum folate and serum vitamin B12 in relation\nto circulating concentrations of both metabolites. In subjects with\nserum vitamin B12 >148 pmol/liter (L), concentrations of both\nmetabolites decreased significantly as serum folate increased. In\nsubjects with lower serum vitamin B12, however, metabolite con-\ncentrations increased as serum folate increased starting at 20\nnmol/L. These results suggest a worsening of vitamin B12's enzy-\nmatic functions as folate status increases in people who are vitamin\nNHANES  cobalamin  methionine synthase  L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase\nparticipates as a coenzyme in two reactions, the\nremethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine and the\nisomerization of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (1\u00ad3).\nThe former reaction is catalyzed by methionine synthase in the\ncytosol, and the latter is catalyzed by L-methylmalonyl-CoA\nmutase in the mitochondria. Vitamin B12\ndeficiency is associated\nwith anemia, megaloblastosis, neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric\ndisorders (4), all of which could theoretically be linked to the\nblock in Hcy remethylation or the resulting hyperhomocysteine-\nmia (5). However, the block in the isomerization reaction and\nresulting buildup of methylmalonic acid (MMA) could also play\na role (6).\nEarly case reports of vitamin B12\ndeficiency due to pernicious\nanemia described the alleviation of anemia but the precipitation\nor exacerbation of neurologic or neuropsychiatric sequelae after\nfolic acid administration, an early form of treatment based on the\nmistaken idea that folate deficiency was the problem (7). How-\never, a lack of confirmatory data from animal models or human\nstudies has generated controversy about the true consequences\nof folic acid administration in vitamin B12\ndeficiency (8), which\nis now known to encompass more than pernicious anemia (9, 10).\nWe recently examined the interaction between serum folate and\nstatus in relation to anemia, macrocytosis, and cognitive\nUnited States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) (11). As expected, low vitamin B12\nstatus was associ-\nated with all three abnormalities. Furthermore, when vitamin B12\nstatus was normal, high serum folate was related to protection from\ncognitive impairment. Among those with low vitamin B12\nstatus,\nhowever, high serum folate was directly associated with both\nanemia and cognitive impairment. Consistent with our findings for\nsubjects with normal vitamin B12\nstatus, several cross-sectional\nhave reported direct relations between folate status and cognition.\nOn the other hand, Morris et al. (20) found that higher folate intake\nwas associated with more rapid cognitive decline in a cohort of\nstatus was unknown.\nIn India, where vitamin B12\ndeficiency is common, authors of\nthe Pune Maternal Nutrition Study found that the combination\nof high blood folate and low vitamin B12\nlevels during pregnancy\nwas associated with elevated risk of insulin resistance in the\nchildren at age six (21). Insulin resistance is not an established\nconsequence of vitamin B12\ndeficiency, but the wide-ranging\nknown effects of the vitamin suggest that it also may have\nunknown benefits, and its deficiency may have unknown\nOur goal in the present study was to determine whether higher\nfolate status in vitamin B12\ndeficiency was associated with higher\ncirculating levels of the functional indicators of low vitamin B12\nstatus, total (t) Hcy, and MMA.\nResults\nSubject Characteristics and Serum Vitamin B12.

Supplement use was much more common during the\nmore recent survey, when serum folate was also much higher,\nand tHcy was lower. In both surveys, low serum vitamin B12\nwas\nsignificantly less common among non-Hispanic blacks than it was\nin non-Hispanic whites. Also consistent across surveys were\nstrong associations between low serum vitamin B12\nstatus and\nnonuse of dietary supplements, low folate status, and high tHcy\nand MMA concentrations as well as at least marginally signifi-\ncant associations with higher age, cigarette smoking, and lower\nalanine aminotransferase concentration.

A possible link\nbetween folate status and MMA has not been considered,\nbecause folate is not known to participate in pathways affecting\nMMA accumulation. In this study of the general United States\npopulation spanning pre- and postfolate fortification eras, we\nfound that tHcy does not generally decrease with increasing\nfolate status among people with low serum vitamin B12\nconcen-\ntrations. On the contrary, in people with low serum B12\ncon-\ncentrations, high tHcy levels were found at both very low and\nvery high serum folate levels, with lower tHcy levels in between.\nFurthermore, whereas MMA data for people with low levels of\nand folate were limited, the MMA results were\nconsistent with the tHcy results in revealing a narrow range of\nfolate values associated with near-normal metabolite levels and\nelevated metabolite levels among those with low and high folate\nconcentrations.\ndeficiency, high tHcy reflects impaired methi-\nonine synthase activity, whereas high MMA indicates impaired\nmethylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity. Consequently, our findings\nsuggest that both pathways of vitamin B12\nmetabolism are\nadversely affected by high serum folate despite the direct\ninvolvement of folate only in methionine synthase activity.\nSimultaneous impairment of both pathways is normally caused\ndeficiency or by the disruption of those early steps\nprocessing that are common in both pathways (1,\n23): (i) the intrinsic factor mediated B12\nabsorption by the\nintestine; (ii) formation of the B12\n-transcobalamin II complex in\nplasma; (iii) transport of the complex into peripheral tissue by a\nreceptor-mediated endocytosis and incorporation of the com-\nplex into the lysosomes; (iv) dissociation of the complex and exit\n, in the form of acquocob(III)alamin, into the\ncytosol; and (v) reduction to cob(II)alamin for subsequent\nmigration either for association with the methionine synthase\n(MS) in the cytosol or to enter the mitochondria.\nIt is difficult to envision how folate could interfere with any\nof these steps. The alternate possibility is that this interference\noccurs after the diversion of the vitamin to the respective\ncompartments in the course of rendering the vitamin available\nfor interaction with the respective enzyme proteins or during\ncatalysis. In the cytosol, the cob(II)alamin associates with the\nMS to form a cob(II)alamin\u00adMS complex. This complex is then\nreduced by a closely associated enzyme, methionine synthase\nreductase (MTR) to form a cob(I)alamin\u00adMS that is catalytically\nactive. The MS enzyme contains a binding site for 5-methyltet-\nrahydrofolate, which is more specific for polyglutamyl derivatives\n(2). In the enzyme catalysis, the cob(I)alamin acquires a methyl\ngroup from bound 5-methyltetrahydrofolate by means of an\noxidation addition mechanism forming a methyl\u00adcob(III)alamin\nprosthetic group (24). This bond between the methyl group and\nthe cobalt ion is then cleaved heterolytically, leaving both\nbonding electrons on the cob(I)alamin and transferring the\nmethyl group to homocysteine in the form of a carbocation,\n (24). Cob(I)alamin is remethylated by 5-methyltetrahy-\ndrofolate. However, the enzyme-bound cob(I)alamin occasion-\nally becomes oxidized to cob(II)alamin, and this enzyme form is\ncatalytically inactive. The enzyme is reactivated by a reductive\nmethylation in which the methyl group is derived from adeno-\nIn the mitochondria, the cob(II)alamin undergoes a reduction\nto cob(I)alamin by an electron donor followed by adenosylation\nin a reaction that involves ATP, to form the 5-deoxyadenosyl-\ncob(III)alamin (Adenosylcobalamin) (1, 2, 23). This is then\nassociated with the mutase by the action of adenosyltransferase.\nA mitochondrial protein, methylmalonic aciduria cblA type\nprotein (MMAA), associates with the mutase to protect the\nmutase from inactivation (26).\nIn the MMA\u00adCoA mutase reaction, the bond between the\nmethylene group of 5-deoxyadenosine and the cobalt ion un-\ndergoes homolytic cleavage, thus resulting in free radicals both\non the methylene group and the cobalt ion. The free radical on\nthe methylene group is transferred to the MMA\u00adCoA molecule\nto allow isomerization to succinyl-CoA, which is accompanied by\nthe transfer of the free radical back onto the methylene group for\nsubsequent rebonding with the cobalt ion (1, 2, 23).\nAlthough the reduction of cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin\noccurs in both compartments, the process is substantially dif-\nferent for the two. In the cytosol, this reduction takes place while\ncob(II)alamin is bound to the enzyme. In the mitochondrion, on\nthe other hand, this reduction precedes the association of the\nmutase. This difference and the fact that these reductions occur\nin separate compartments render it difficult to envision inter-\nference by folate.\nAnother possibility is that folate interferes with the catalytic\naction of MS, and the impairment of the mutase is secondary to\nthe interaction with the MS. This possibility would be analogous\nto the observed effects of nitric oxide on B12\nmetabolism. Nitric\noxide is a strong oxidizing agent that irreversibly inactivates\nmethionine synthase by oxidizing enzyme-bound vitamin B12\nto\nform a free radical (27). There is no known direct effect of\nnitrous oxide on the mutase. Nevertheless, both humans who\nTable 2. Least-square geometric mean (95% C.I.)

(33) showed that exposure to nitrous oxide\nresulted in cellular depletion of methylcobalamin and, after a lag\nperiod, decreased adenosylcobalamin and conversion of the\nmutase holoenzyme to its apoenzyme. These data suggest a\ncoordinate distribution of cobalamin cofactors between the\nmitochondria and the cytosol compartments.\nHigh serum folate as encountered in this study was attribut-\nable to high intake of folic acid from supplements and fortified\nfood, which undoubtedly resulted in the appearance of unme-\ntabolized folic acid in plasma (34, 35). In the Framingham Study,\nthe percent of folate consumed as folic acid increased sharply as\nplasma folate increased, from 50% among those with plasma\nnmol/L (S. Choumenkovitch, P.F.J., and J.S., unpublished work).\nA high intake of folic acid in vitamin B12\ndeficiency would\nchange the concentration and character of cellular folate, par-\nticularly tetrahydrofolate (36). A central hypothesis to account\nfor the observed effect of folic acid intake in the remission of the\nhematological complications in pernicious anemia is that the flux\nof unmethylated folate into the bone marrow cells circumvents\nthe inhibition of DNA synthesis caused by the trapping of folate\ncoenzymes as methyltetrahydrofolate (37). Folate coenzymes\nparticipating in DNA synthesis include formylated tetrahydro-\nfolate, which is used for purine synthesis, and 5,10- methylenetet-\nrahydrofolate, which is used for thymidylate synthesis. Unsub-\nstituted tetrahydrofolate and dihydrofolate are the respective\nproducts of these syntheses.\nA common denominator for some of these folates is that they\ncan serve as electron acceptors or oxidation agents. Formylated\ntetrahydrofolate can be reduced to 5,10- methylenetetrahydro-\nfolate; 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate can be reduced to\n5-methyltetrahydrofolate, whereas folic acid and dihydrofolate\nacquire electrons for conversion to tetrahydrofolate. Based on\nthese properties, it is tempting to suggest that folic acid or its\npartially reduced form, dihydrofolate, as well as formylated and\nmethylene tetrahydrofolate could act as electron acceptors and\nthereby accelerate the rate of oxidation of MS cob(I)alamin to\nMS cob(II)alamin. The enzyme activity could be even more\ncompromised because of the lower S-adenosylmethionine\n(SAM) availability and lower enzyme synthesis due to B12\nThis proposed interaction between folate derivatives (folic\nacid, dihydrofolate, etc.) and a heterologous protein (i.e., MS) is\nnot unprecedented: 5-methyltetrahdrofolate is an activator of\ncystathionine -synthase in Neurospora crassa (40), an inhibitor\nof glycine methyltransferase in mammalian systems (41), and\nbinds to cytosolic serine hydroxymethylase (42). Binding to\nserine hydroxymethylase is associated with diminished synthesis\nof methionine and diversion of the flow of one carbon units\ntoward thymidylate synthesis. Dihydrofolate is a competitive\ninhibitor of pig liver methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase\n(MTHFR) (43). In all cases, these associations are enhanced\nwhen the respective folates are polyglutamated, which is con-\nsistent with the idea that the great majority of folate enzymes\nhave a common binding site for the glutamic acid side chain. As\npointed out above, MS also contains a binding site for methyl-\ntetrahydrofolate and its product, tetrahydrofolate (2).\nBased on this paradigm, we propose that the high serum MMA\nassociated with the combination of low B12\nstatus and high\nplasma folate status stems from the disruption of B12\nhemostasis\nin the mitochondria, analogous to the effect of nitric oxide.\nIn conclusion, we have extended the findings of our recently\npublished study of the interaction between vitamin B12\nstatus\nand folate status in relation to anemia, macrocytosis, and\ncognitive impairment (11) by demonstrating that, among people\nwith low serum vitamin B12\nconcentrations, high plasma folate\nis associated with higher concentrations of the two functional\nindicators of impaired B12\nstatus, Hcy and MMA. These obser-\nvations provide a possible biochemical explanation for high folic\nacid intake's exacerbation of the clinical manifestations of\ndeficiency.\nMethods\nStudy Population. The NHANES, which is currently implemented\nas a continuous annual survey, monitors the nation's health and\nnutritional status by using a complex multistage probability design\nto select a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized United\nStates civilian population. To increase the precision of estimates\nderived from the survey, adolescents, the elderly, Mexican Amer-\nicans, and blacks are oversampled. The protocols for conducting the\nNHANES were approved by the institutional review board of the\nNational Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, and informed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants (44). For this investigation, we used data from phase 2\nwith NHANES analytic guidelines, we combined data from these\nlatter two surveys into a single dataset (45).\nTrained interviewers used a computer-assisted personal in-\nterview system to interview participants in their homes. The\nparticipants were also asked to report to a mobile examination\ncenter (MEC) to provide further interview data and undergo a\nphysical examination that included phlebotomy. A detailed\ndescription of blood collection and processing can be found in\nthe NHANES Phlebotomy Manual (46).

Of the 8,588 adult participants in phase\n2 of the NHANES III, 4,940 were included in this study (Fig. 2).\nBiochemical Measurements. Priority analyses were carried out at\nthe Inorganic Toxicology and Nutrition Branch or the Division\nof Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental\nHealth, or at central laboratories that varied with survey years.\nSerum concentrations of folate and vitamin B12\nwere measured\nby using the Quantaphase II Radioassay Kit (Bio-Rad).
