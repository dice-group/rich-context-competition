Densities in the regions of the LV cavity, papillary muscles and LV\nthrombus were observed on 140kVp mixed-energy and 70 keV single-energy images. Iodine and\nblood were chosen as the base material pair, the densities were observed and the iodine and blood\nconcentrations were quantitatively measured.\nResults: A total of 24 patients were enrolled in this study. On iodine-based density images, both the\nLV thrombus and papillary muscles showed low-attenuation shadows. On blood-based density\nimages, comparable high-density attenuation was found in the LV thrombus and LV cavity, while\nrelative hypodensity was noted in the papillary muscles. Iodine and blood densities were significantly\nlower in papillary muscles than in the LV cavity. Iodine densities were significantly lower in the LV\nthrombus than the LV cavity, whereas blood densities in the two areas did not differ significantly.\nConclusions: Spectral CT dual-substance separation technology and its derived images of iodine-\nand blood- based densities provide a new, simple, and feasible semiquantitative method to detect\nLV thrombus that warrants further investigation.\n",

Therefore, the accurate detection\nof the LV thrombus is essential for clinicians\nto determine treatment strategies and to\nimprove the patient's prognosis. Currently,\ntwo-dimensional transthoracic echocardiog-\nraphy (TTE) is the most commonly used\ntechnique for detecting LV thrombi.4,5\nIt provides information such as shape, size\nand anatomical site of the thrombus, but\noccasionally trabecular muscles, false chor-\ndae tendineae and papillary muscle tumours\nmay be misdiagnosed as thrombi. Magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) has been vali-\ndated as a fairly accurate modality to diag-\nnose LV thrombi.6,7 However, it is not\nsuitable for all patients due to increased\ncontraindications, higher cost and slower\nimaging speed compared with TTE. Spectral\ncomputed tomography (CT) imaging, a\nnewly developed technology, has been\napplied in areas such as coronary artery\nimaging,8 plaque recognition9,10 and myo-\ncardial perfusion,11 but no data have been\nreported on its application in the identifica-\ntion of LV thrombi.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate\nthe use of a gemstone spectral imaging (GSI)\nCT scanner to identify LV thrombi using\nCT spectra based on their unique dual-\nsubstance separation technology and\nderived single substance isolated images.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nPatients who underwent coronary CT angi-\nography in the Division of Cardiology,\nChina-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin\nUniversity, Changchun, Jilin Province,\n2014 were enrolled sequentially into this\nobservational case\u00adcontrol study. All patients\nunderwent a TTE examination within 3 days\nprior to CT examination. On the basis of the\nTTE results, patients were divided into two\ngroups: group 1 consisted of patients who had\nno cardiac thrombus; group 2 consisted of\npatients with LV thrombus detected by TTE,\nand the diagnosis was further confirmed with\nsequential TTE follow-ups with regular\nantithrombotic therapy using warfarin.\nPatients in groups 1 and 2 were age and sex\nmatched. Ethical approval was obtained from\nthe Ethics Committee of the China-Japan\nUnion Hospital of Jilin University (No.\nobtained from the patients prior to their\ninclusion in the study.\nTTE examination\nTwo-dimensional TTE examinations were\ncolour Doppler ultrasound system (Philips\nHealthcare, Best, the Netherlands) and\nstandard techniques, in accordance with\nthe guidelines of the American Society of\nEchocardiography.12 LV thrombus was\ndefined as an echodense mass within the\nLV cavity with margins distinct from the LV\nwall, visible in both systole and diastole in at\nleast two views, with a morphology that was\ndifferent from tissues such as papillary\nmuscles, chordae tendineae, trabecular mus-\ncles or technical artefacts. TTE results were\nreviewed by two experienced ultrasonog-\nraphy examiners.\nSpectral CT scan\nA Discovery CT750 HD scanning system\n(GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was\nused in the GSI mode. All patients signed an\nadditional informed consent form prior\nto undergoing their CT angiography exam-\nination. The patient's heart rate was\ncontrolled at <70 beats/min, and each\npatient lay in a supine position, connected\nto an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a bin-\nocular high-pressure injector. The position-\ning line was set at 1\u00ad2 cm below the trachea\ncarina to cardiac diaphragm surface.\nContrast agent application was controlled\nby the bolus tracking technique. A total of\n20 ml nonionic iodinated contrast media\niohexl (OmnipaqueTM 350 mg/ml; GE\nHealthcare) was injected via the cubital\nvein with a velocity of 5 ml/s, followed by\n15 ml saline injected at the same velocity. A\nregion of interest (ROI) was placed into the\naortic root, and image acquisition began 6 s\nafter the density level reached the predefined\nthreshold of 100 Hounsfield units. The\npatient was then instructed to hold his/her\nbreath, and a further 70\u00ad80 ml of contrast\nmedia was infused intravenously at the same\nvelocity followed by 30\u00ad40 ml of saline.\nScanning parameters were as follows: X-\nradiography tube helical scan speed, 0.6 s/\ninstantaneous voltage switch (0.5 ms)\nbetween high and low energy (140 kVp and\nmodes were selected for image reconstruc-\ntion: the first set of images was reconstructed\nusing 140 kVp mixed energy; the second set\nof images was constructed using 70 keV\nsingle energy. The reconstructed slice thick-\nness and slice spacing was 2.50 mm.\nImage analysis and measurement\nImage analysis and measurement in group 1\npatients. Reconstructed images using\nenergy were transferred to a GE Advantage\nWorkstation 4.6 (GE Healthcare). Image\ndensities in the regions of the normal LV\ncavity and papillary muscles were visually\nobserved. In the GSI viewer software, iodine\nand blood were chosen as the base material\npair. Then, in the generated isolated images\nof iodine- and blood-based density, the\ndensities in the regions of the normal LV\ncavity and papillary muscles were simultan-\neously compared with visual observations.\nSubsequently, a scanning slice showing the\nclearest images and maximum papillary\nmuscles was selected, and a ROI with a\nsize of 3 mm \u00c2 3 mm was set in the regions of\nthe papillary muscles and within the normal\nLV cavity for the same slice, respectively.\nIodine and blood densities at these ROIs\nwere qualitatively measured, based on the\nrespective isolated images of iodine- and\nblood-based density. Five ROIs were set for\neach slice in the LV cavity and papillary\nmuscles, respectively, and the measurements\nwere repeated in three different slices. The\nmean results were used for statistical\nanalysis.\nImage analysis and measurement in group 2\npatients. Using the aforementioned method\nfor patients without thrombi, densities were\nobserved in the normal LV cavities and\nthrombi on the mixed-energy 140 kVp and\nsingle-energy 70 keV images. The identifica-\ntion of an LV thrombus was made by two\nattending radiologists (M.C.Z. and L.L.)\nwith reference to the TTE images.\nSimultaneous comparative observations of\ndensities in the regions of the LV cavity and\nthrombus on the isolated images of iodine-\nand blood-based density were made; the\nmean iodine and blood densities in the\nregions of the normal LV cavity and\nthrombi were qualitatively measured.\nAccording to the obtained observations\nand analysis results, retrospective analyses,\nslice by slice, were undertaken of the isolated\nimages of the iodine- and blood-based dens-\nity in the patients with LV thrombus. On the\nbasis of the different manifestations of LV\npapillary muscles and thrombus on spectral\nCT, normal papillary muscles and LV\nthrombotic lesions were identified when\nthey coexisted at the same scanning slice.\nCardiac MRI scans (MAGNETOM\u00d5\nSkyra 3.0 T scanner; Siemens Healthcare,\n56 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1)\nErlangen, Germany) were conducted in\npatients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic\nsyndromes associated with LV thrombi.\nCine MRI was performed with breath\nholding, retrospective ECG-gating and true\nfast imaging with steady-state precession\nsequence.\nAll patients diagnosed with an LV throm-\nanti-Xa activity) of low-molecular weight\nheparin sodium (Clexane\u00d5; Aventis\nIntercontinental, Antony, France) subcuta-\nwarfarin (Xiinyi Jiufu Pharmaceutical Co.,\nShanghai, China) orally once daily for 3\u00ad5\ndays. Following discharge from hospital,\npatients continued to receive 2.5\u00ad9.0 mg of\nwarfarin orally once daily for at least 1\nmonth; the dose of warfarin was adjusted\nwas rechecked at 1 month after initial\ntreatment.\nStatistical analyses\nSigmaSTAT\u00d5 3.5 software (Systat Software,\nSan Jose, CA, USA) was used for statistical\nanalyses. Data were expressed as mean \u00c6 SD\nfor continuous variables with normal distri-\nbution. Data were expressed as median\n(25th\u00ad75th percentile) for continuous vari-\nables without a normal distribution.\nStudent's t-tests were performed in order\nto compare continuous variables with\nnormal distribution. The paired-sample\nt-test was used to compare blood and\niodine densities between the LV cavity\nand thrombus and between the LV cavity\nand papillary muscles for the same slice. An\nindependent-samples t-test was used to com-\npare differences in the blood and iodine\ndensities of the LV thrombus and papillary\nmuscles between the two groups.\nNonparametric Mann\u00adWhitney U-test was\nused to compare samples with a not-normal\ndistribution. A P-value < 0.05 was con-\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nTwenty-four patients who underwent cor-\nonary CT angiography, including 16 male\nand eight female patients (age range, 26\u00ad79\nwere enrolled in the study. On the basis of\nthe TTE results, patients were divided into\ntwo groups. Group 1 consisted of 12 patients\nwho had no cardiac thrombus (eight male\ntwo patients with acute myocardial infarc-\ntion (AMI) within 2 weeks of onset, four\npatients with chronic myocardial infarction\n(>3 month onset of AMI), four patients\nwith dilated cardiomyopathy and two\npatients with atrial fibrillation before radio-\nfrequency ablation. Group 2 consisted of 12\npatients (eight male and four female; age\ndetected by TTE. The diagnosis was further\nconfirmed with sequential TTE follow-ups\nwith regular antithrombotic therapy using\nwarfarin. Two patients had AMI within 2\nweeks of onset, four patients had chronic\nmyocardial infarction, four patients had\ndilatated cardiomyopathy and two patients\nhad idiopathic hypereosinophilic syn-\ndromes. A single thrombus was detected in\nnine patients and two or more thrombi\nin three patients, on TTE. Thrombi varied\nin size among patients with the maximum\npatients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic\nsyndromes underwent cardiac MRI\nexamination.\nIn group 1 patients on iodine-based\ndensity images, the LV cavity with normal\nfilling of contrast agent manifested as a high-\ndensity attenuation, while papillary muscles\nappeared as low-density attenuation or\nfilling defects (Figure 1A). On the blood-\nbased density images, the density of the\npapillary muscles was relatively lower\ncompared with the LV cavity with visual\nobservations (Figure 1B). Quantitative\niodine and blood concentrations in the\npapillary muscles were significantly lower\nthan those in the LV cavities (P < 0.001;\nIn group 2 patients on iodine-based\ndensity images, the LV cavity with normal\nfilling of contrast agent manifested as high-\ndensity attenuation, while the LV thrombus\nappeared as low-density attenuation or\nFigure 1.

LV, left ventricle.\n58 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1)\nfilling defects (Figure 2A). On the blood-\nbased density images, density in the LV\nthrombotic region was relatively high and\ncomparable with the normal LV cavity with\nvisual observations (Figure 2B). The mean\niodine concentration in the LV thrombus was\nsignificantly lower than that in the normal\nLV cavity (P < 0.001), while no difference\nwas found in the mean blood concentrations\nbetween these areas (Table 1).\nIn the 12 patients without cardiac throm-\nbus in group 1, the mean iodine and blood\ndensities in papillary muscles were sub-\ntracted from those in the LV cavity at the\nsame slice, to obtain the iodine and blood\ndensity differences between papillary mus-\ncles and the LV cavity for each slice. This\nprocess was repeated in three different\nscanning slices, and the mean value was\nused for each patient's final iodine and\nblood density differences between papillary\nmuscles and the LV cavity. Using the same\nmethod, iodine and blood density differ-\nences were obtained between the LV throm-\nbus and LV cavity in the 12 patients with LV\nthrombus in group 2. Statistical analyses\nshowed that the iodine density difference in\nthe LV thrombus was similar to that in\npapillary muscles, while the blood density\ndifference was significant between these two\nOn the basis of the results described\nabove, slice by slice, the isolated iodine-\nand blood-density images were simultan-\neously analysed in patients with LV\nthrombus in group 2. For each patient, it\nwas possible to easily and clearly identify LV\nthrombotic lesions from normal papillary\nmuscles. Figure 3 illustrates the CT spec-\ntrum images for a patient who had mixed\npapillary muscles and LV thrombus in the\nsame slice. On the iodine-based density\nimage, both papillary muscles and LV\nthrombus presented with less filling of con-\ntrast agent. On the blood-based density\nimage, the papillary muscles showed a rela-\ntively lower density, while the LV thrombus\nshowed a density similar to the LV cavity.\nTherefore, the differentiation between the\npapillary muscles and the LV thrombotic\nlesion could be made by the simultaneous\nobservation of the images of the iodine and\nblood densities in the same slice. The\nmeasured iodine and blood concentrations\nconfirmed the visual observation results\n(Figure 3).\nIn this study, two patients with LV\nthrombus underwent cardiac MRI scans.\nThe single cine MRI images showed low-\ndensity signals in the regions of the LV\nthrombus for both patients (Figure 4). All\npatients in group 2 received low-molecular\nTable 1.

One\nmonth later, TTE follow-up results revealed\nan obvious shrinkage in the size of the LV\nthrombi in 11 patients (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nLeft ventricular thrombosis is common in\npatients with AMI, ventricular aneurysm13\nand dilated cardiomyopathy.1 Occasionally,\nLV thrombus can be found in patients with\nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypereo-\nsinophilia.14,15 It is often accompanied by\nperipheral vascular thromboembolic com-\nplications such as stroke, and thus has a high\nmortality and morbidity.2\u00ad3,13 LV thrombi\nmay be significantly reduced or even\ncompletely dissolved if timely and effective\nanticoagulant and/or antithrombotic ther-\napy is administered.16 Therefore, timely and\naccurate detection of LV thrombi is essential\nin order to develop treatment strategies and\nimprove the patient's prognosis.\nCurrently, TTE has been proposed as the\nmost commonly used standard modality for\ndetecting LV thrombi.4,5 However, a large\nvariation exists in the results obtained by\ndifferent operators, and up to 46% of\ncardiac thrombi diagnosed with TTE are\nuncertain.4,5 Occasionally, structures such\nas trabecular muscles, false chordae tendi-\nnae and papillary muscle tumours may be\nmisdiagnosed as LV thrombi.6 Cardiac MRI\nhas been validated as a fairly accurate\nmodality to detect cardiac thrombi,6,7 but\ndue to its higher cost, more contraindica-\ntions, lower imaging speed and longer exam-\nination time compared with TTE, it is not\nappropriate for all patients. Multislice\nspiral CT (MSCT) angiography is a widely\naccepted method for the evaluation of cor-\nonary arteries. While clearly revealing the\nthree-dimensional coronary arteries, MSCT\nis capable of showing the low-density sha-\ndows or filling defects caused by thrombotic\nlesions. However, conventional nonspectral\nMSCT cannot be used to make a qualitative\ndiagnosis based on tissue composition or\naccurately identify thrombotic lesions from\nnormal papillary muscles. This is because\npapillary muscles are also manifest as low-\ndensity shadows on routine CT images.\nThe present study showed that spectral\nCT dual-substance separation technology\nusing a GSI scanner and its derived iodine-\nand blood-based density images allow the\nsimple and clear identification of LV\nthrombi. To our knowledge, this is the first\nreport to describe the use of this new spectral\nCT imaging technique for this purpose.\nCompared with conventional MSCT,\nspectral CT imaging is a newly developed\ntechnology.17 It utilizes a single X-radio-\ngraphy tube and an instantaneous switching\nbetween high and low voltage of 80 kVp and\nX-radiography sampling data almost simul-\ntaneously, for the same layer and in the same\ndirection. In addition to generating 101\nsingle-energy images,18 it can decompose\nthe attenuation coefficient of one substance\ninto a weighted sum of any other two\nsubstances (base material pair), thereby\nachieving composition analysis and sub-\nstance separation.19\nUsing spectral CT dual-substance separ-\nation technology and selecting blood and\niodine as the base material pair, the isolated\nimages of iodine (blood)-based and blood\n(iodine)-based density were obtained. On\niodine-based density images, both normal\npapillary muscles and LV thrombi appeared\nas low-density shadows, which represented a\nreduced filling by contrast medium. On\nblood-based density images, densities and\nmeasured blood concentrations in LV\nthrombi were similar to the normal LV\ncavity, while lower densities and quantita-\ntive blood concentrations were noted in\npapillary muscles. Thus, by simultaneously\ncomparing the blood- and iodine-based\nimages for the same slice, LV thrombotic\nlesions could be easily differentiated from\nnormal papillary muscles. This spectral CT\ncapability cannot be achieved with the trad-\nitional MSCT method.\nNormal papillary muscles and LV\nthrombi have different manifestations on\nisolated blood- and iodine-based density\nimages, which may be closely related to\ntheir different material composition and\nblood supply characteristics. Iodine is the\nmain component of CT-enhanced contrast\nagent, and the iodine-based density images\nshow the contrast agent (iodine) distribu-\ntion, therefore reflecting the tissue's blood\nsupply.20 It is more difficult for the contrast\nagent (iodine) to reach the regions of the\npapillary muscles and LV thrombus, com-\npared with the normal LV cavity. Thus,\nthese areas exhibited a lower iodine density\ncompared with the LV cavity on the isolated\niodine-based density images. In contrast,\nsince the LV thrombus is a condensed\nmass with blood components coagulated\nwithin the LV cavity, its composition is\nsimilar to the blood components in the LV\ncavity (both contain platelets and erythro-\ncytes). Therefore, the observed densities and\nthe measured blood concentrations are simi-\nlar for the LV thrombus and the normal LV\ncavity. Conversely, papillary muscle com-\nposition includes fibrous tissue and smooth\nmuscle, which is quite different from blood\nor clot components in the LV cavity and\nthrombus. Therefore, observed densities and\nquantitative blood concentrations in papil-\nlary muscles are different from the normal\nLV cavity and thrombotic lesions on the\nisolated blood-based density images.\nThis study also demonstrated that the\nLV thrombi could be reduced if a timely\nand accurate anticoagulant and/or antith-\nrombotic therapy, such as low-molecular\nweight heparin sodium and warfarin, were\nadministered.\nIn addition to cardiac thrombi, cardiac-\noccupying lesions include primary cardiac\ntumours, cardiac metastases and infective\nvalvular vegetation. Spectral CT dual-\nsubstance separation technology may\nprovide a new method to identify cardiac-\noccupying lesions such as tumours. The\nblood supply characteristics of cardiac\nthrombus and tumours are different.\nKirkpatrick et al.21 adopted contrast-\nenhanced ultrasound perfusion and found\nno contrast-enhanced phenomenon in car-\ndiac thrombi due to a lack of blood supply.\nUsing this feature, it should be easy to\ndifferentiate between cardiac thrombi and\ntumours. Since the composition of cardiac\ntumours is different from clots and blood\nwithin the cardiac lumen, it is anticipated\nthat simultaneous comparative analysis of\nthe isolated blood- and iodine-based density\nimages on spectral CT for the same slice will\nbe helpful for differentiating cardiac throm-\nbotic lesions from tumours. This hypothesis\nneeds to be validated through future clinical\ninvestigations.\nThis present study had a number of\nlimitations. First, the sample size was small\nso these current findings should be inter-\npreted as a `proof of principle', which dem-\nonstrates the feasibility of this new method\nfor assessing cardiac thrombi. Future stu-\ndies with larger sample sizes in which the\ninvestigators are blind to the TTE results are\nwarranted to validate the present observa-\ntional findings; and to determine the sensi-\ntivity, specificity, positive predictive value,\nand negative predictive value of this new\ntechnique. Secondly, TTE examination was\nused as the gold standard for the detection\nof LV thrombi, but histopathological con-\nfirmation were not performed. Thirdly, no\nvalidation or discrimination among diseases\nsuch as cardiac tumours was undertaken,\nand no atrium/left atrial appendage thrombi\nwere investigated in this study. It should be\nnoted that the current application of spectral\nCT is still in its initial stages, therefore more\nclinical experience and validation is\nrequired.\nIn conclusion, spectral CT dual-\nsubstance separation technology and the\nderived images of blood- and iodine-based\n64 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1)\ndensity allow the semiquantitative identifi-\ncation of the tissue components of LV\nthrombi. This technology provides a new,\nsimple, and feasible method for detecting\nLV thrombotic lesions, and may provide a\nnew method for identifying other LV-occu-\npying lesions such as cardiac tumours.\nFurther validation with larger clinical sam-\nples is warranted.\n"
