We examined the association between inflammatory markers, such as ferritin, uric\nacid, white cell counts, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein, and insulin resistance among 5,959\nadults, aged 20 years and without diabetes (fasting glucose 126 mg/dl and not taking\ndiabetes medication), who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey. Insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA).\nLevels of ferritin, uric acid, white cell counts, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein were signifi-\ncantly higher in individuals with a higher HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). After adjust-\nment for age, sex, race, education, physical inactivity, current and former smoking, alcohol\nintake, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systolic blood pressure, BMI, waist circum-\nference, serum total cholesterol, and triglycerides, a 1-SD higher ferritin (126.1 ng/ml), uric acid\nHOMA-IR. These findings indicate that elevated levels of inflammatory markers are positively\nand independently associated with insulin resistance. Further studies should examine the po-\ntential causal effect of inflammation on insulin resistance.\nInsulin resistance is a major risk factor\nfor type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular\ndisease, and chronic kidney disease (1\u00ad\n3). Additionally, insulin resistance and\ncompensatory hyperinsulinemia have\nbeen associated with hypertension, in-\ncreased levels of serum triglycerides,\nsmall dense LDL particles, circulating\nplasminogen activator inhibitor, and de-\ncreased levels of HDL (4). The prevalence\nof diabetes has been increasing progres-\nsively in the U.S. and other countries, and\nthe number of adults with diabetes in the\nworld is projected to increase to 300\nthat the number of individuals with insu-\nlin resistance will be much greater than\nthis estimate.\nThe underlying causes for the devel-\nopment of insulin resistance are not well\ndefined, but both genetic and environ-\nmental factors may play a role. Obesity\nand physical inactivity have been consid-\nered important risk factors for insulin re-\nsistance (6). Clinical and epidemiologic\ndata also indicate that inflammatory fac-\ntors might be associated with insulin re-\nsistance. Several studies have reported\nelevated levels of C-reactive protein,\nwhite blood cell count, uric acid, and fi-\nbrinogen in people with insulin resistance\nor the metabolic syndrome (7\u00ad16). Stud-\nies on the relationship between ferritin\nand insulin resistance are scarce. Fernan-\ndez-Real et al. (17) reported that ferritin\ncould be a marker of the insulin resistance\nsyndrome in 36 healthy subjects, while\nSheu et al. (18) reported that serum fer-\nritin was positively associated with insu-\nlin resistance in women but not men. In\ngeneral, studies on the relationship be-\ntween inflammatory factors and insulin\nresistance have been based on small sam-\nple sizes.\nWe examined the relationship be-\ntween inflammatory markers, such as\nC-reactive protein, white cell count, fi-\nbrinogen, uric acid, and ferritin, and in-\nsulin resistance in a large representative\nsample of nondiabetic U.S. adults who\nparticipated in the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\nducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics of the Centers for Disease Con-\n1994.

Information on\na wide variety of sociodemographic, med-\nical history, nutritional history, and fam-\nily history questions, such as self-reported\nage, race/ethnicity, sex, years of education\ncompleted, history of smoking and hy-\npertension, use of antihypertensive med-\nication, use of nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including\naspirin in the past month, physical activ-\nity, alcohol consumption, and 24-h di-\netary recall, were obtained during the\nhome interview (19).\nFor NHANES III participants who\nwere assigned to a physical examination\nduring a morning session, a blood sample\nwas collected following an overnight fast\nof 8 h. Laboratory procedures used in\nthe NHANES III have been described\nwas measured with a hexokinase enzy-\nmatic reference method (COBAS MIRA;\nRoche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and\nserum insulin level by means of a radio-\nimmunoassay (Pharmacia Diagnostics,\nUppsala, Sweden). Serum C-reactive pro-\ntein levels were measured using latex-\nenhanced nephelometry (Behring\nNephelometer Analyzer System; Behring\nDiagnostics, Somerville, NJ). The white\nblood cell count was determined on an\nautomated hematology analyzer (Coulter\nCounter Model S-PLUS JR).

Linear trends in these\ncharacteristics across insulin resistance\nquartiles were examined by means of the\nZ test (continuous variables) and the\nWald 2 test (categorical variables) in\nmultivariable regression models after ad-\njustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.\nUnivariate; age-, sex-, and race-\nadjusted; and multivariable-adjusted lin-\near regression analyses were used to\ndetermine the association between each\n1-SD higher inflammatory factor and\nHOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).\nIn addition, univariate; age-, sex-, and\nrace-adjusted; and multivariable-\nadjusted logistic regression analyses were\nused to estimate the odds ratio of elevated\nassociated with each 1-SD higher ferritin\nfibrinogen (80.6 mg/dl). The odds ratios\nof insulin resistance associated with de-\nelevated C-reactive protein (1.0 mg/dl),\nas compared with undetectable C-reac-\ntive protein, were also calculated. Multi-\nvariable models included adjustment for\nage, sex, race, education, physical activ-\nity, current and former smoking, NSAID\nuse in the past month, alcohol intake, sys-\ntolic blood pressure, BMI, waist circum-\nference, serum total cholesterol, and\ntriglycerides. To assess the robustness of\nthe association, all analyses were repeated\nstratified by sex and the presence of\nchronic kidney disease. All data analyses\nwere conducted using Stata 7.0 (Stata,\nCollege Station, TX) and used techniques\nappropriate to the complex survey design\nRESULTS -- Characteristics of the\nstudy participants are presented by quar-\ntile of HOMA-IR in Table 1. On average,\npersons with higher insulin resistance\nwere older, more often African American\nor Hispanic, more physically inactive, less\nlikely to possess a high school education,\nmore likely to be current smokers, and\nmore likely to drink alcohol. The preva-\nlence of NSAID use in the past month was\nsimilar among the quartiles of HOMA-IR.\nMean BMI, waist circumference, systolic\nand diastolic blood pressure, total choles-\nterol, and triglycerides were significantly\nhigher, whereas GFR was lower, among\npersons with higher insulin resistance.\nMean serum ferritin, uric acid, white\nblood cell count, and fibrinogen levels, as\nChen and Associates\nwell as the proportion of individuals with\ndetectable and clinically elevated C-reac-\ntive protein, were significantly higher in\npersons with higher insulin resistance.\nTable 2 shows the unadjusted; age-,\nsex-, and race-adjusted; and multivariate-\nadjusted linear regression analyses of\n1-SD higher level of inflammatory factors\nand elevated C-reactive protein on\nHOMA-IR. Even after multivariable ad-\njustment, serum ferritin, uric acid, white\nblood cell count, fibrinogen, and clini-\ncally elevated C-reactive protein levels\nwere positively and statistically signifi-\ncantly associated with HOMA-IR.\nTable 3 shows the unadjusted; age-,\nsex-, and race-adjusted; and multivariate-\nadjusted odds ratios of elevated\nHOMA-IR (2.86) associated with a\n1-SD higher level of inflammatory factors\nand elevated C-reactive protein. Again,\neven after multivariate adjustment, serum\nferritin, uric acid, white blood cell count,\nfibrinogen, and detectable and clinically\nelevated C-reactive protein levels were\neach positively associated with higher\nodds of elevated HOMA-IR. These associ-\nations were consistent in both men and\nwomen (Table 4).\nPatients with chronic kidney disease\nhad a higher level of HOMA-IR (3.2 vs.\nmg/dl, P  0.001), white blood cell count\nTable 1--Characteristics of study participants by HOMA-IR quartile\nVariable\nHOMA-IR quartile\nP for trend\nC-reactive protein (% detectable 0.22\u00ad\nData are means  SE.\nTable 2--Unadjusted, univariate, and multivariate linear regression analysis of inflammatory markers on HOMA-IR\nVariable (1 SD)\nUnadjusted Age, sex, and race adjusted Multivariate adjusted*\n*Adjusted for age, sex, race, education, physical activity, current and former smoking, alcohol intake, NSAID use in the past month, systolic blood pressure, BMI,\nwaist circumference, serum total cholesterol, and triglycerides.

The association between\nHOMA-IR and inflammatory factors was\nnot statistically different between patients\nwith and those without chronic kidney\ndisease (Table 4).\nCONCLUSIONS -- The present\nstudy identified strong, positive, graded\nrelationships between elevated C-reactive\nprotein, white cell count, uric acid, fer-\nritin, and fibrinogen with insulin resis-\ntance among nondiabetic subjects. These\nrelationships were independent of age,\nsex, race, and other potential risk factors\nfor insulin resistance, such as obesity,\nphysical inactivity, cigarette smoking,\nand alcohol consumption. These findings\nare noteworthy because they are based on\na large representative sample of the U.S.\ngeneral population. In addition, numer-\nous potential confounding covariates\nwere measured and taken into account in\nthe present study.\nThese findings have important clini-\ncal and public health implications. Insu-\nlin resistance is a major risk factor for type\n2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke,\nand kidney disease (1\u00ad3). Identifying risk\nfactors for insulin resistance is important\nin the development of strategies for the\nprevention and treatment of insulin resis-\ntance. Inflammatory markers such as tu-\nmor necrosis factor- receptor 2,\ninterleukin-6, and C-reactive protein\nwere associated with an increased risk of\ndiabetes (24). In addition, inflammatory\nfactors such as C-reactive protein and fi-\nbrinogen play an important role in the\npathogenesis of cardiovascular disease\n(25,26). Prospective epidemiologic stud-\nies have indicated that C-reactive protein\nhas additive effects on the risk of cardio-\nvascular disease among patients with in-\nsulin resistance (27). Treatment of\ninflammation may reduce the risk of in-\nsulin resistance, diabetes, and related car-\ndiovascular disease.\nPrevious studies have shown that C-\nreactive protein is associated with insulin\nresistance in healthy nondiabetic individ-\nuals (7,28). However, these studies were\nconducted in relatively small samples and\ndid not adjust for potential confounding\nfactors such as obesity, physical inactive,\ncigarette smoking, and alcohol consump-\ntion. Our findings provide additional ev-\nidence that C-reactive protein is\nassociated with insulin resistance in non-\ndiabetic individuals. In addition, data\nfrom the WOSCOPS (West of Scotland\nCoronary Prevention Study) showed that\nC-reactive protein predicted the develop-\nment of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged\nmen independently of established risk\nfactors (29). The potential underlying\nmechanisms of this association are un-\nclear. Devaraj, Xu, and Jialal (30) indi-\ncated that C-reactive protein might\npromote atherothrombosis and insulin\nresistance by increasing plasminogen ac-\ntivator inhibitor-1 expression and activity\nin endothelial cells.\nWhite blood cell count was associated\nTable 3--Unadjusted, univariate, and multivariate logistic regression analysis of inflammatory markers on elevated HOMA-IR*\nVariable (1 SD)\nUnadjusted Age, sex, and race adjusted Multivariate adjusted\n*The top 25th percentile compared with the bottom 75th percentile (2.86 vs. 2.86).

Chronic kidney disease was defined as estimated GFR 60 ml  min1 \nChen and Associates\nwith insulin resistance in nondiabetic\nPima Indians (10) and healthy nonsmok-\ning men (11). Our findings extend those\nresults to a nationally representative sam-\nple, adding more evidence that inflamma-\ntion is likely an important risk factor for\ninsulin resistance.\nSerum uric acid was positively associ-\nated with insulin resistance in several\net al. (31) reported that uric acid was not\nassociated with insulin resistance after ad-\njustment for confounding factors in\nyoung healthy Caucasians. Focchini et al.\n(14) reported that the clearance of uric\nacid was decreased in patients with insu-\nlin resistance. The current study docu-\nments a positive association between uric\nacid and insulin resistance in persons with\nand without chronic kidney disease. There-\nfore, our findings imply that the positive as-\nsociation between uric acid and insulin\nresistance is not due to the confounding ef-\nfect of reduced kidney function.\nElevated serum ferritin has been con-\nsidered a marker for both inflammation\nand insulin resistance. Fernandez-Real et\nal. (17) found that that serum ferritin was\ncorrelated with insulin sensitivity in 36\nhealthy subjects, and Sheu et al. (18)\nfound that serum ferritin was positively\nassociated with insulin resistance in\nwomen but not men. Our findings docu-\nment a strong and positive association be-\ntween serum ferritin and insulin\nresistance. Patients with chronic kidney\ndisease had higher serum ferritin levels,\nbut the association between serum ferritin\nand insulin resistance was independent of\nchronic kidney disease status.\nImperatore et al. (15) examined the\nassociation between plasma fibrinogen\nmultivariable analyses, both plasma insu-\nlin and the metabolic syndrome were sig-\nnificantly and independently associated\nwith plasma fibrinogen. In addition, Men-\nnen et al. (16) investigated the relations\nbetween markers for insulin resistance\n(fasting insulin and HOMA-IR) and fi-\nbrinogen in a cross-sectional study in\nwas independently related with markers\nof insulin resistance, and the association\nwith fibrinogen was stronger in women\nthan in men. Our study also showed an\nindependent relation between fibrinogen\nand insulin resistance, and this relation\nwas consistent in men and women.\nCertain limitations should be consid-\nered in the interpretation of our findings.\nFirst, the cross-sectional study design in\nNHANES III does not allow inferences to\nbe drawn regarding causality between in-\nflammation and insulin resistance. Specif-\nically, this study design does not allow\none to determine whether inflammation\ncauses the development of insulin resis-\ntance or whether insulin resistance causes\ninflammation. Prospective cohort studies\nprovide a better context for answering\nthese questions.\nIn addition, HOMA-IR was calculated\nbased on fasting insulin and glucose con-\ncentration, while the more accurate\neuglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp\nmethod was not used in NHANES III.\nHowever, it is not practical to use the\nclamp method in large clinical or epide-\nmiological studies to measure insulin\nresistance. Nonetheless, HOMA-IR is\nhighly correlated with insulin resistance\nmeasured using the euglycemic-\nhyperinsulinemic clamp method and is\nmore suitable for population studies\nwidelyusedinlargeepidemiologicalstudies\nand in clinical practice for estimation of in-\nsulin resistance. As such, the findings from\nourstudyareapplicabletoclinicalandpub-\nlic health practice settings.\nIn conclusion, our study documented\nthe presence of strong, positive, and inde-\npendent relationships between inflamma-\ntory factors and insulin resistance. These\nfindings combined with knowledge from\nprevious studies suggest that inflammation\nis present in patients with insulin resistance\n(33). Further studies are warranted to ex-\namine the potential causal effect of inflam-\nmation on insulin resistance.\n"
