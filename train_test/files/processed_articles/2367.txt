Glei2\nLuis Rosero-Bixby3\nShu-Ti Chiou4\nMaxine Weinstein5\n Introduction\nThe process linking chronic and acute health conditions to disability has been\nconceptualized as a progression through four stages: (1) pathology; (2) substantial\nimpairments; (3) functional limitations (restrictions in basic physical or mental\nperformance); and (4) disability (difficulties in various activities of daily life,\nVerbrugge and Jette 1994). Measures associated with these stages have provided\nresearchers and health professionals with valuable indicators of the current and future\nhealth status of community-dwelling populations of older adults. Population-based\nsurveys frequently include measures of the disablement process, either from self-reports\nor as interviewed-administered performance tests. Although these two types of\nmeasures  often labeled subjective and objective respectively  are statistically\ncorrelated, they are thought to capture distinct constructs (Reuben et al. 2004).\nNevertheless, both self-reports and performance tasks have been shown to predict\nsubsequent deterioration in health in diverse settings (Bernard et al. 1997; Cooper et al.\nEach method has advantages and drawbacks. The most frequently used self-\nreported measures identify: (1) limitations in performing basic activities of daily living\n(ADL) such as bathing or eating, and (2) mobility limitations such as walking or raising\nDemographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 229\none's arms. These indicators are easy to collect, inexpensive, and focus on behaviors\nthat are clinically relevant and signal the need for caregiving (Reuben et al. 2004).\nAlthough the subjective component of self-reports may capture information of\nprognostic value, self-reports are likely to be biased by myriad factors (e.g.,\nenvironmental conditions, cultural preferences, or attitudes) that impede comparisons\nacross populations or subgroups (Melzer et al. 2004) and, given their focus on\nfunctional limitations and especially disability, they are unlikely to identify individuals\nin the early stages of impairment (Reuben et al. 2004). Still, they may be better suited\nthan performance tests to assess individuals' interactions with their immediate\nenvironments and the associated constraints.\nPerformance assessments, such as grip strength, peak expiratory flow (PEF), chair\nstands, and walking speed, are largely determined by physiological functions that\ntypically decline with age and may underlie frailty (Cooper et al. 2010). Specifically,\nwalking speed and chair stands reflect lower limb strength and mobility, grip strength is\na marker of overall muscle strength, and peak expiratory flow is an indicator of lung\ncapacity and airway obstruction. These measurements are considered to have greater\nface validity and perhaps reliability than self-reports, and are likely to be more sensitive\nto changes over time, more comparable across different contexts, and better suited to\ncapturing variation across a wide continuum of physical function including early stages\nsuggest that they provide preclinical detection of functional decline (Reuben et al.\n2004). The predictive power of performance assessments for future health outcomes\nlikely results from bi-directional pathways. For example, not only do poor performance\nmeasures appear to be causally related to increased risks of injury and the onset of\ndisability, but a history of chronic disease and malnutrition is often the source of these\nphysical impairments (Fried and Guralnik 1997). Despite their utility in health surveys,\nperformance assessments come at a cost, not only a monetary cost, rather they also\nplace a burden on the respondent and interviewer. The tests are time-consuming, require\nsubstantial effort for some older or weak respondents, need special equipment and\nspace for administering, and may compromise response rates for the overall survey.\nThus, the decision about whether to include them in home-based interviews is likely to\ndepend on their added value beyond information captured by self-reports.\nAlthough there are many potential uses of performance assessments in both\npopulation-based research and clinical practice \u00ad for example, the identification of\nindividuals at risk of developing disabilities or requiring institution-based care \u00ad here\nwe evaluate these measures only in terms of their prognostic value for survival. We use\nsurvival as our criterion because mortality is the health measure most frequently used to\ncharacterize the overall wellbeing of a population. Moreover, mortality is a well-\ndefined and salient health outcome with little measurement error. Virtually all of the\nGoldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function\n230 http://www.demographic-research.org\nbest quality prognostic indices for predicting survival (e.g., Lee et al. 2006; Schonberg\net al. 2009) include physical function as a key indicator. Indeed, Swindell et al. (2010)\nfound that five of the ten strongest predictors of mortality (among 377 predictors tested)\nwere measures of physical function, including both self-reported and performance-\nbased indicators.\nOur primary objective in this paper is to ascertain the incremental improvement\nderived from performance tests beyond that provided by self-reported limitations in\npredicting mortality. Our secondary objectives are to determine whether some\nperformance assessments are stronger predictors than others and whether their\npredictive power persists with controls for self-reported disease status. As\nbiodemographic surveys increasingly incorporate performance tests into household\nvisits, it is important to evaluate the net contribution of these assessments for predicting\nsurvival. To assess the robustness of our findings, we use data from two\npopulation-based surveys of older adults that collected similar information in Taiwan\nand in Costa Rica. Although we have no reason to expect the relationship to differ\nbetween these countries, replication of the results in different settings may strengthen\nour inferences.\n2. Background\nThere has been little research addressing the central questions in this analysis. Few\nstudies predicting all-cause mortality in a general population of older adults include\nboth self-reported and performance-based assessments of physical function. Almost all\nexisting studies are based in high income countries \u00ad primarily the US (Al Snih et al.\nand Australia (Simons et al. 2011). Two exceptions are a study in China (Feng et al.\nBeyond this geographic restriction, the studies described above that include both\nself-reported and performance-based measures of physical function as predictors of\ntotal mortality have several drawbacks. First, although most include self-reported ADL\nlimitations, fewer include self-reported mobility limitations, which afflict adults across\na broader age range. Second, researchers often combine several different performance\nassessments into a summary measure, but they do not always evaluate the individual\ntests. For example, several of these studies use the Short Physical Performance Battery\n(SPPB), which comprises a timed walk, repeated chair stands, and balance stands\nReuben et al. 2004), and one uses the MOBLI (Index of Mobility-Related Limitations),\nDemographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 231\nwhich replaces balance stands with PEF (Melzer, Lan, and Guralnik 2003). Only two of\nthese studies evaluate all of the underlying individual tests as predictors of mortality\nDespite variation in the measures collected and in the lengths of follow-up, most\nstudies find that performance tests predict mortality net of self-reported limitations.\nHowever, perhaps because of variations in study design, researchers disagree about\nwhich tests best predict mortality. For example, Cesari et al. (2008) report chair stands\nto be the strongest component of the SPPB in predicting mortality, whereas several\nearlier studies identify walking speed (Al Snih et al. 2002; Markides et al. 2001; Ostir et\nal. 2007). Rosero-Bixby and Dow (2012) find grip strength to be the strongest predictor\nof mortality in women, whereas PEF is the best predictor in men; walking speed is only\nmarginally significant net of the other covariates. Most studies that have examined grip\nstrength or PEF in combination with self-reports include few, if any, additional\nperformance assessments, making it difficult to evaluate these two measures vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe others.\nOur study extends the existing literature in two important ways. First, we examine\nwhether previous findings, based mostly on the US, pertain to two middle income\ncountries: Taiwan and Costa Rica. Second, we consider a set of four performance tests\nto assess whether chair stands or timed walks \u00ad as some earlier work suggests \u00ad are the\nstrongest predictors of mortality, or whether grip strength or PEF, which are often not\npart of the most frequently used batteries of tests, perform as well or better. We\nhypothesize that grip strength and PEF may perform better because they are likely to be\nless correlated with the lower extremity functions captured by the self-reports.\n3. Materials and methods\nThe data come from the first wave of the Costa Rican Study on Longevity and Healthy\nAging (CRELES) and the second wave of the Social Environment and Biomarkers of\nAging Study (SEBAS). In both surveys, an interview conducted in the respondent's\nhome included questions related to health and a series of performance-based\nassessments. SEBAS and CRELES included informed consent from all participants and\nreceived ethical approval from the human subjects committees at the institutions\nconducting the studies.\nCRELES is a longitudinal study based on a national sample of residents of Costa\nRica aged 60 and older in 2005, with oversampling of the oldest old (Rosero-Bixby,\nGoldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function\n232 http://www.demographic-research.org\ndatabase using a multi-stage sampling design. For this analysis, we use data from the\ncompleted by 2827 respondents (85 per cent of survivors located).\nThe SEBAS cohort represents a random subsample of participants in the nationally\nrepresentative Taiwan Longitudinal Study of Aging (TLSA); elderly persons and urban\nresidents were oversampled. The TLSA began in 1989 and younger refresher cohorts\nwere added in 1996 and 2003; all three cohorts were selected randomly using a multi-\nstage sampling design. The sampling frame for the 2006 SEBAS included: a) an older\ncohort (aged 60+) of respondents from the 1999 wave of TLSA who completed the\nrespondents first interviewed in the 2003 wave of TLSA. Interviews were completed by\nWith the exception of mortality, all measures come from the first wave of CRELES\nFor SEBAS, survival status as of June 30, 2011 was ascertained through linkage with\nthe death certificate file maintained by the Department of Health and the household\nregistration database maintained by the Ministry of the Interior. Survival status in\nCRELES was established in two ways: (1) through the computer records in the National\nidentification number (the c\u00e9dula) that all Costa Ricans have. Five out of the 566 deaths\nfound in the field were not found in the Registry, suggesting a death under-registration\nrate of 1 per cent. In contrast, 10 per cent of the deaths from the Registry were not\nfound in the field, appearing in the second and third waves as loss of follow-up. For the\nforeigners in the sample (approx. 3 per cent), survival was established only in the field\nbecause they did not have a unique identification number with which to link them to the\nRegistry.\nDemographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 233\n3.2.2 Measures of physical function\nWe include two self-reported measures of physical function. Limitations with activities\nof daily living (ADL) are based on five ADLs (bathing; eating; toileting; moving\naround the house; getting out of bed). We count the number of ADLs (05) that the\nrespondent reported difficulty performing. The measure of mobility limitations counts\nthe number of mobility tasks (04) that the respondent reported difficulty performing.\nThree of these tasks were similar in both countries (i.e., walking; climbing stairs;\nraising his/her arms). In Costa Rica, respondents were asked to demonstrate whether\nthey could lift their arms above their shoulders; those who did not attempt the activity\nare coded as missing. In Taiwan, difficulty raising both hands over the head was based\non self-reports. The fourth self-reported function differed between Costa Rica (i.e.,\npushing or pulling a large object such as a recliner chair) and Taiwan (i.e., lifting or\ncarrying 1112 kg). In Costa Rica, respondents who reported that they do not do that\nactivity were coded as missing; this response category was not an option in Taiwan.\nFour health assessments were administered by trained interviewers: grip strength,\nPEF, timed walk, and chair stands. In each case, the test was coded as missing if the\nrespondent refused (or in the case of SEBAS, was unable to understand the instructions\nor there was equipment failure).\nGrip strength (in kg) was measured using a dynamometer (CRELES: Creative\nHealth Products dynamometer [model T-18]; SEBAS: North CoastTM hydraulic hand\ndynamometer [NC70142]); we used the highest level from two trials on the dominant\nhand in CRELES and three trials on each hand in SEBAS. The respondent was coded as\nunable to perform the test if s/he: a) met the exclusion criteria for both hands; b) tried\nbut was unable to do the test; c) did not attempt the test for safety reasons; d) (in\nCRELES only) was not tested because of disability; e) (in SEBAS only) did not attempt\nthe test because of weakness, stroke, or frailty or stopped because of pain or discomfort.\nThe exclusion criteria included: surgery on hand/wrist/arm in the past three months and\n(in SEBAS only) recent injury, worsening pain, swelling, inflammation, or severe pain\nin the hand/wrist.\nLung function, represented by PEF (L/min), was based on the maximum of three\ntrials using a peak flow meter (CRELES: Mini Wright; SEBAS: TruZone\u00ae). In\nCRELES, the unable group included respondents who were unable to complete even\none trial. In SEBAS, the respondent was coded as unable if: a) s/he met the exclusion\ncriteria (i.e., surgery on chest/abdomen or hospitalized for a heart problem in the past\nsix weeks; detached retina or eye surgery in past six months; hospitalized for\nrespiratory or lung infection in past three weeks), b) s/he did not attempt the test\nbecause of stroke or illness, or c) s/he or the interviewer felt it was unsafe.\nGoldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function\n234 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTo measure walking speed (m/sec), the respondents were asked to walk three\nmeters at their normal speed. The respondent started from a sitting position in CRELES\nand a standing position in SEBAS. CRELES included one trial; SEBAS conducted two\ntrials (we used the faster of the two). The respondent was coded as unable to\ncomplete the test if s/he: a) tried but was unable to do the test; b) did not attempt the test\nfor safety reasons; or c) (in CRELES only) reported any problem that would impair\nhim/her from doing a mobility and flexibility test.\nFor the chair stand test, the respondent was asked to stand up and sit down again\nfive times in a row as quickly as possible without stopping while keeping his/her arms\nfolded across his/her chest. For those able to complete five stands, the completion time\nwas recorded. To adjust for differences in chair height, we regressed the completion\ntime (ci\n) for individual i on chair height (hi\n) controlling for the respondent's age and\nheight (SEBAS)/knee height (CRELES), with models fit separately by sex (Cornman et\nal. 2011). The adjusted completion time was calculated as )\n(\n~\ni\ns\ni\ni\nh\nh\nc\nc \n\n  , where\ns\n\nwas the coefficient for hi\nfrom the sex-specific model and h was the mean chair height\namong the pooled sample (44.5 cm). Chair stand speed was computed as five divided\nby the adjusted time\ni\nc\n~ (Cornman et al. 2011). The respondent was coded as unable\nto perform the test if s/he: a) met the exclusion criteria (CRELES: reported any problem\nthat would impair him/her from doing a mobility and flexibility test; SEBAS: was in a\nwheelchair); b) tried but was unable to complete five stands, or c) did not attempt the\ntest for safety reasons.\nAll models include controls for age, sex, education, and urban residence. In auxiliary\nanalyses, we also control for several other variables that may be associated with both\nphysical function and mortality: self-reported measures of specific health conditions\n(i.e., cancer, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, respiratory disease, arthritis, hypertension);\nsmoking status (never, former, current); exercise (3+ times per week); and\nhospitalization in the past year.\n3.3 Analytical strategy\nAmong those interviewed, 19.0 per cent of the CRELES sample and 5.1 per cent of the\nSEBAS sample are missing data for a measure of physical function, either self-reported\nDemographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 235\nin SEBAS). Exclusion of these respondents leaves an analysis sample of 2290 for Costa\nRica and 1219 for Taiwan. In order to ascertain the robustness of the results to the\ntreatment of missing data, we use multiple imputation to re-estimate the final models\nfor the full samples.\nDescriptive statistics are weighted to account for oversampling and for differential\nresponse rates by age, sex, and other covariates. Survival models are fit separately by\ncountry using unweighted data. We estimate age-specific mortality using a Gompertz\nproportional hazards model with time measured in terms of age. The Gompertz function\nassumes that the force of mortality increases exponentially with age and generally fits\nvery well at older ages (Horiuchi and Coale 1982). In initial tests (not shown), the age\nslope of mortality () did not differ significantly by sex in these samples.\nSome of the performance tests are strongly correlated with one another (e.g.,\namong those with measurements, the Pearson correlations between grip strength and\nPEF are 0.60 in CRELES and 0.65 in SEBAS, and correlations between walking speed\nand chair stand speed are 0.37 in CRELES and 0.51 in SEBAS). Thus, we model the\nperformance assessments individually as well as jointly. Our models are fit in two\nstages. First, we estimate a model that includes only self-reported ADL and mobility\nlimitations in addition to sociodemographic controls. Next, we fit a series of models\nthat add a performance test, with a categorical specification: those unable to perform a\ngiven test are assigned a separate category, and the remaining responses are recoded\ninto quartiles based on the weighted distribution of the pooled samples. These models\nare not designed to reflect causal processes but rather to evaluate the prognostic value\nof performance assessments over and above that of self-reported measures of physical\nfunction.\nTo evaluate the predictive ability of different measures of physical function, we\ncompare the model-based predicted probability of dying by the end of follow-up (see\nSupplementary Material for details) with the observed binary outcome (death vs.\nsurvival) to estimate the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve\n(AUC). The AUC is the most popular measure of discrimination and can be interpreted\nas the probability that those who actually died are assigned a higher predicted\nprobability of death than are their counterparts who survived (Pencina and D'Agostino\n2004). We use the rocgold procedure in Stata 12.1 to test whether the addition of\nperformance assessments yields a significant improvement in mortality prediction.\nSimilarly, we compare the AUC from models that include individual performance tests\nto determine whether some assessments are better predictors than others. We present\nboth the absolute increase in AUC between pairs of nested models as well as the\nincrease in AUC for a given model as a percentage of the area above the curve (i.e., (1-\nAUC) or the fraction of incorrect predictions) for the simpler model.\nGoldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function\n236 http://www.demographic-research.org\nFinally, to help gauge the magnitude of the association with mortality, we calculate\nthe predicted probability of dying between exact ages 70 and 75 (\n^\nq ) for selected\nlevels of performance. This age interval corresponds roughly to the mean age at the\ntime of the survey (69.3) and at the end of follow-up (74.3) for the pooled sample\n(weighted). These probabilities are estimated by setting the selected performance\nassessment at the specified value, fixing all other covariates at the weighted mean for\nthe pooled sample, and using the model coefficients to predict the probability of dying\nbetween exact ages 70 and 75 (see Supplementary Material for details). For each\nperformance test, we provide two sets of predicted probabilities. The first is based on a\nmodel that includes only the selected performance assessment and sociodemographic\ncontrols, thus representing the gross effect without adjusting for any other measures\nof physical function. The second is based on a model that includes all physical function\nmeasures (both self-reported and performance-based) in addition to control variables\nand thus, represents the net effect after adjusting for the effects of all other measures\nof physical function.\n4. Results\nIn CRELES, there were 569 deaths by January 1, 2011; the average length of mortality\nfollow-up was 5.2 years (max., 6.2 years). For SEBAS, there were 140 deaths by June\nolder than the Taiwanese sample (Table 1), reflecting differences in the sampled\npopulation (60+ for CRELES, 53+ for SEBAS). A small proportion of respondents\nreport any of the five ADL limitations (11 per cent in Costa Rica, 7 per cent in Taiwan),\nsuggesting low rates of severe disability in these populations. Functional limitations are\nmore frequent: a sizeable proportion report at least one of the four mobility limitations\n(55 per cent in Costa Rica; 33 per cent in Taiwan; not shown). The performance-based\ntests capture more subtle variations in physical capability. For example, even among\nthose who report no ADL or mobility limitations, there is wide variation in performance\n(e.g., grip strength ranges from 5 to 58 kg in Costa Rica; 4 to 68 kg in Taiwan; not\nshown). Thus, although the performance tests are moderately correlated with the self-\nreported measures (r = -0.13 to -0.52), they are more likely to capture early stages of\nimpairment before a limitation would be acknowledged with standard questionnaires.\nDemographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 237\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics for all analysis variables, by country,\nweighted analyses\nCosta Rica\nTaiwan\nControl variables\nSelf-reported measures of physical functiona\nPerformance-based measures of physical\nfunctiona\nUnable to perform grip strength test, % 2.8 3.4\nADL, Activities of Daily Living; PEF, peak expiratory flow\nb Among those able to complete the test.\nc Maximum from trials on both hands except for n=8 in CRELES and n=46 in SEBAS who did not complete trials on both hands.\nd Maximum from three trials except for n=7 in CRELES and n=13 in SEBAS who completed only one or two trials.\ne In SEBAS, n=12 walked only 2-2.5m because of space limitations in the respondent's home; walking speed was calculated based\non the distance actually walked.\ncensored early, at the date of last contact.

In models that add a single\nperformance test (Models 2a-2d), joint Wald chi-square tests (based on the four\nGoldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function\n238 http://www.demographic-research.org\nparameters for a given assessment) indicate that each of the four performance tests is\nsignificantly associated with mortality in Costa Rica, but only grip strength and PEF are\nsignificantly associated with mortality in Taiwan. The fact that the sample size in Costa\nRica is more than twice that in Taiwan accounts for the significance of some estimates\nfor Costa Rica even when the magnitudes of the hazard ratios are similar to or smaller\nthan the corresponding values in Taiwan.\nThe hazard ratios are substantially attenuated when all performance tests are\nincluded in a single model (Model 5, Tables 2 and 3). Grip strength and PEF continue\nto be significantly related to mortality in both countries, but walking speed and chair\nstand speed are not. Being unable to perform the PEF test is a particularly strong\npredictor of mortality (HR=2.6 in Costa Rica; HR=5.2 in Taiwan relative to those in the\ntop quartile). Poor PEF performance (bottom quartile) also strongly predicts mortality\nin both countries (HRs>2). In addition to the models presented in Tables 2 and 3, we\nestimated an auxiliary model that includes controls for specific health conditions,\nsmoking, exercise, and hospitalization. Although the coefficients for PEF weaken\nslightly with the inclusion of these variables, both PEF and grip strength remain strong\npredictors of mortality (results not shown). We also used multiple imputation to re-\nestimate these same models for the full samples (n=2827 in Costa Rica, n=1284 in\nTaiwan). The coefficients from these models are very similar to those shown in Tables\nComparisons of the AUC for different models show that self-reported measures of\nphysical function yield a substantial and significant improvement in mortality\nprediction compared with a baseline model that adjusts only for sociodemographic\ncharacteristics -- the increase in AUC is greater than 10 per cent of the area above the\ncurve (1-AUC) for the baseline model in both countries (Table 4). Beyond the\nprognostic value of self-reported physical function, PEF provides the greatest\nimprovement in predictive ability in both countries; the other three performance\nassessments produce smaller improvements that are significant only in Costa Rica.\nDemographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 239\nTable 2: Hazard ratios from Gompertz model of age-specific mortalitya,\nSelf-reported measures\nPerformance-based tests\nGrip strength (kg)\nPEF (L/min)\nWalking speed (m/sec)\nChair stand speed (stands/sec)\na All models control for sex, education, and urban residence.\nb Model numbers correspond to those presented in Table 4.\nc Joint Wald chi-square test for the four parameters pertaining to specified assessment.\nGoldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function\n240 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 3: Hazard ratios from Gompertz model of age-specific mortalitya,\nSelf-reported measures\nPerformance-based tests\nGrip strength (kg)\nPEF (L/min)\nWalking speed (m/sec)\nChair stand speed\n(stands/sec)\na All models control for sex, education, and urban residence.\nb Model numbers correspond to those presented in Table 4.\nc Joint Wald chi-square test for the four parameters pertaining to specified assessment.\nDemographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 241\nTable 4: Comparisons of the AUC for various models, by country\nCosta Rica Taiwan\nComparison AUC\n in\n as a % of\nunexplainedb AUC\n in\n as a % of\nunexplainedb\n0 Baseline model\n(control variables\n1 Add self-reported\n2c Model 1 + walking\n2d Model 1 + chair stand\n3a Model 1 + (PEF, grip\n3c Model 1 + (PEF, chair\n4a Model 1 + (PEF, grip\nstrength, walking\n4b Model 1 + (PEF, grip\nstrength, chair stand\nwalking speed, chair\n5 Model 1 + all four\na The change () in the AUC and associated significance level is based on a comparison with the model indicated.\nb The  in the AUC as a percent of unexplained is computed as:\n)\n( Model\nModel\nModel\nX\nX\nY\nAUC\nAUC\nAUC\n\n\n, where Model X is the comparison\nmodel and Model Y is the current model.\nc This model is the same as Model 1 presented in Tables 2 and 3.\nd This model is the same as Model 5 presented in Tables 2 and 3.\nA ranking of the four assessments in terms of the absolute increment in AUC\nresults in the following order of performance measures, from largest to smallest: PEF,\ngrip strength, walking speed, and chair stands.

Based on the criterion of 0.01 to indicate a meaningful improvement in the\nAUC (Pencina et al. 2008), PEF appears to be a useful measure (the gain in AUC\nequaled 0.015 in Taiwan and was just below 0.01 in Costa Rica). Compared with PEF\nalone (Model 2b), the addition of each of the other three performance assessments\n(Models 3a3c) yields a similar increase in AUC in Costa Rica (0.004). In Taiwan, grip\nstrength (Model 3a) and walking speed (Model 3b) lead to the largest increases in AUC,\nwhile chair stand speed results in a more modest improvement in AUC.\nTable 5 shows the extent of variation in the predicted probability of dying between\n^\nq ) by selected levels of performance on the physical\nassessments. Differences are particularly large for grip strength and PEF. For example,\nthe gross effect for PEF (i.e., before adjusting for the effects of other measures of\nphysical function) suggests that 28 per cent of Costa Ricans who were unable to\nperform the test would be expected to die between ages 70 and 75 compared with only\n6 per cent of those in the top quartile; corresponding figures for Taiwan are 37 per cent\nvs. 4 per cent. After adjustment for the contribution of other physical function\nmeasures, the net effect for PEF is smaller, but remains substantial (Costa Rica: 17 per\ncent of unable vs. 7 per cent in the top quartile; Taiwan: 22 per cent vs. 5 per cent,\nrespectively). Some of the differences are large even without considering those who\nwere unable to complete the tests. For example, in both countries, the net effect of PEF\non mortality is twice as high for those in the bottom compared with the top quartile.\nIn auxiliary models (not shown), we explored whether the assessments are more\npredictive for older (70+) than for younger (<70) persons and for men than women \u00ad\nresults which would be consistent with tentative findings from a meta-analysis (Cooper\net al. 2010). In line with results from the EPESE study in the US (Reuben et al. 2004),\nwe also considered whether performance tests have greater prognostic value among\nthose who report themselves to be highly functioning (i.e., no self-reported limitations)\ncompared with those reporting limitations. Among the many interactions tested, few\nwere significant, close to what we would expect by chance. Thus, we found little\nevidence that the prognostic value of the performance tests differs by age, sex or the\npresence of self-reported limitations.\nDemographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 243\nTable 5: Predicted probability of dying between exact ages 70 and 75 (\n^\nq ) for\nselected levels of performance on the physical assessmentsa,\nby country\nGross effectb Net effectc\nCosta Rica Taiwan Costa Rica Taiwan\nObserved\nq in the national populationd\nPerformance-based tests\nGrip strength\nPEF\nWalking speed\nChair stand speed\na All models control for sex, age, education, and urban residence.

Discussion\nHealth interview surveys routinely ask respondents about their physical limitations, but\nthey are much less likely to measure respondents' physical performance with trained\nobservers, presumably because of the expense, complex logistics, and burden for\nparticipants. Because it is easier to obtain self-reports than to administer performance\ntasks, it is important to ascertain the additional value derived from such tests. Of course,\ntheir value depends in large part on the particular questions being addressed. In this\nanalysis we consider only one criterion: the prognostic value of four types of\nperformance tests over and above self-reported limitations for five-year mortality. For\ntwo population-based samples of older individuals living in the community, we find\nthat PEF and grip strength (and gait speed in Costa Rica) yield sizeable improvements\nin mortality prediction above and beyond self-reported limitations. The gains in\nprediction are stronger in Taiwan than in Costa Rica but, because of the smaller sample\nsize, are less likely to be statistically significant in Taiwan.\nThe paucity of previous studies addressing this issue, combined with variability\nacross data sets in the measures collected, has yielded few robust findings. One study\nsuggested that the chair stand test provided the strongest mortality prediction (Cesari et\nal. 2008), while other work favored walking speed (Al Snih et al. 2002; Markides et al.\n2001), and yet another study reported that grip strength had the biggest effect in women\nand PEF had the biggest effect in men (Rosero-Bixby and Dow 2012). None of these\nprior studies included all four performance tests. Our findings, which are remarkably\nsimilar in Taiwan and Costa Rica, reveal that for both countries  in the presence of\ncontrols for self-reported ADL and mobility limitations  PEF has the strongest\nassociation with mortality. In models that include all four assessments, PEF and grip\nstrength measures significantly predict mortality, whereas chair stand and walking\nspeed do not. The discrepancies between our results and previous findings are likely\ndue to two factors. One relates to the batteries of tests used in the earlier studies: chair\nstands and walking speed were generally included, whereas grip strength and PEF were\nnot. A second explanation is that previous studies controlled for self-reported ADL\nlimitations, but not mobility limitations. Tabulations (not shown) indicated that, when\nwe omitted controls for self-reported limitations, the advantage of PEF and grip\nstrength relative to the other two performance tasks was diminished, particularly in\nCosta Rica. This result is not surprising, as ADL limitations, mobility limitations, chair\nstand speed, and walking speed all reflect lower extremity function.\nMany studies have examined the links between PEF or grip strength and mortality\n(although only a few have done so in conjunction with other performance tests and self-\nreported limitations). Most have found strong and robust associations between each of\nthese two performance tasks and all-cause mortality (Cook et al. 1991; Cooper et al.\nDemographic Research: Volume 30, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 245\nAlthough explanations for these strong links remain unclear (Gale et al. 2007; Schrack,\nSimonsick, and Ferrucci 2010), multiple mechanisms are likely to be involved.\nRantanen et al. (2003) argue that grip strength, which reflects overall muscle strength,\npredicts survival in part because of chronic diseases that result in muscle\nimpairment via such mechanisms as nutritional deficiency, inflammation, physical\ninactivity, and depression. However, even in the absence of recognizable disease, weak\nmuscle strength may increase susceptibility to injury and compromise subsequent\nhealing (Rantanen et al. 2003). It could also reflect early life nutrition and fetal\ndevelopment (Gale et al. 2007; Rantanen et al. 2003) or be a marker of subclinical\ndisease (Rantanen et al. 2003). Similarly, Vaz Fragoso et al. (2008) suggest that a\ndiminished PEF reflects more than chronic lung disease or exposure to smoke or\npollution; for example, low PEF may indicate impaired respiratory muscle strength,\nupper-extremity functional limitations, and poor cognitive function. Both PEF and grip\nstrength are thought to capture a person's overall vigor or vitality (Cook et al. 1991).\nDespite the cost of specialized equipment, both measures have some advantages as risk\nassessment tools in household surveys, particularly in developing countries: Unlike\nchair stands, there is no need to adjust for differences in chair size; in contrast to the\ntimed walk, they do not require unobstructed space; and there is no need to time\nperformance, which may increase measurement error. Nevertheless, accurate\nmeasurements of all four performance assessments necessitate careful interviewer\ntraining and calibration of instruments.\nOne limitation of this study is the attrition of respondents due to loss to follow-up\nand mortality. As with any study of older populations, the analysis is restricted to those\nwho survived to the age range targeted by the survey. In the case of the Taiwanese\nsurvey, there was also attrition resulting from loss to follow-up during the course of the\nlongitudinal study. A second disadvantage  as with any application of performance\ntasks  is that some respondents are unwilling or unable to participate or they are\nexcluded because of health and safety concerns. This proportion is much lower for grip\nstrength (5 per cent in SEBAS; 11 per cent in CRELES) than for chair stands (12 per\ncent and 27 per cent, respectively). As indicated by the hazard ratios in Tables 2 and 3,\nbeing unable to perform a test (including those excluded for health reasons) is often a\nstrong predictor of impending death. However, these indicators are not well-defined:\nExclusion rates vary by the specific task and are likely to depend on the underlying\ndemographic, health, social, and cultural characteristics of the sample. They are also\nlikely to differ by the degree of caution and safety concerns of the survey investigators,\nthereby generating variability across surveys in the strength of the association between\nthese variables and health status. A third concern is limited statistical power,\nGoldman et al.: Prognostic value of measures of physical function\n246 http://www.demographic-research.org\nparticularly in Taiwan, where numerous estimates are substantial but not statistically\nsignificant.\nFew researchers question the importance of collecting self-reported data on\nphysical limitations in older populations. In this study we demonstrate the utility of\nperformance assessments, even when high quality self-reported measures are available.\nNonetheless, our findings indicate that it may not be necessary or cost effective to\ncollect a large battery of performance tests, in part because of substantial correlations\namong the tasks. For predicting mortality in community-based populations  at least\nwithin a five-year period  measurements of PEF and grip strength may suffice.\nAlthough our findings are reinforced by the consistency of estimates for Costa Rica and\nTaiwan, future work should examine the robustness of these results to different settings\nand populations, and, most importantly, to alternative health outcomes. For example, it\nis quite possible that performance measures that are redundant for predicting mortality\nare strong predictors of future disability. With the recent expansion of data collection in\nlongitudinal household surveys, future analyses should also assess the predictive power\nof changes in performance between survey waves, which may enhance models of health\nand survival beyond what can ascertained from cross-sectional measures. They may\nalso add prognostic value to models that include changes in self-reported health and\nfunctional ability as well as changes in physiological markers (e.g., biomarkers of the\ncardiovascular or immune system).\n6.
