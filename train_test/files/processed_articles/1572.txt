In the\npresent study, the demographic and medical characteristics of people who died of GUE were examined, using\nthe 1995\u00ad1997 Multiple Cause of Death files to calculate GUE death rates and proportionate mortality ratios.\nThere were 13,153 GUE deaths during the period, or 4400 deaths per year. Death rates were highest among\ninfants and elderly persons, especially nursing home residents, and increased during the winter months.\nCompared with all decedents, GUE decedents were more likely to have certain other medical conditions,\nincluding bacteremia, volume depletion, renal failure, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immu-\nnodeficiency syndrome. Fatal GUE often appeared to be infectious in origin, but death certificates provide\ninsufficient information to determine whether the causative agents were unknown or foodborne. The accuracy\nof GUE reporting on death certificates and the etiology of fatal GUE merit further investigation.\nGastroenteritis of unknown etiology (GUE) is a sig-\nnificant cause of mortality in the United States. Mead\net al. [1] recently estimated that there are 5000 annual\ndeaths due to GUE and attributed these deaths to un-\nknown, predominantly foodborne agents. Information\nabout deaths due to GUE is limited, hindering efforts\nto identify the sources of foodborne illness and improve\nthe safety of the US food supply. The purpose of the\npresent study is to examine the demographic and med-\nMultiple Cause of Death (MCD) files.

There is evidence that un-\nknown agents affect human health, because population-\nbased surveillance has detected unexplained deaths that\nappeared to be caused by infections but were not asso-\nciated with known pathogens [8]. There is also evidence\nthat unknown agents may be transmitted by food, be-\ncause the etiology of some well-documented outbreaks\nof foodborne illness has not been determined despite\nintensive investigations [9, 10], which suggests that un-\nknown agents were responsible.\nSource of data and definition of GUE.

Most of the condi-\ntions coded as 558 are thought to be infectious in origin, despite\nthe title for this category [13]. NCHS assigned additional ICD-\n9 codes on the MCD files that distinguished between radiation\nand toxic gastroenteritis. Conditions due to medical exposure to\nradiation, such as radiation gastroenteritis, were also coded as\nE879.2 (abnormal reaction to a radiological procedure or ther-\napy) [12]. Conditions qualified as \"toxic,\" such as toxic gastro-\nenteritis, were assigned 2 additional codes that specified the na-\nture of poisoning and the external cause whenever poisoning was\nalso mentioned on the death certificate [12].\nA GUE death was defined as any death of a US resident with\ndeath record, excluding deaths with a 558 code that were due\nto radiation or toxic gastroenteritis. Deaths with a 558 code\nwere considered to be radiation or toxic gastroenteritis deaths\nif a code for toxic poisoning or an abnormal reaction to a\nradiological procedure or therapy appeared on the same line\nimmediate or intervening cause of death, or on the same line\nwhen 558 was an underlying or contributing cause. Deaths due\nto allergic gastroenteritis, coded as ICD-9 558, could not be\ndistinguished from GUE deaths, but the number of such deaths\nlikely was small. Previous studies of gastroenteritis mortality\ndeaths but did not exclude radiation or toxic gastroenteritis\nAnalysis of GUE mortality. The causes of death for GUE\ndecedents were examined to determine how often GUE was\nthe underlying cause of death and how often physicians re-\nported that GUE was infectious in origin, as indicated by ICD-\ndiarrhea). Average annual age-adjusted GUE death rates by age,\nsex, race, and region were calculated to identify variations in\nthe risk of fatal GUE. Population denominators for death rates\nthe US resident population by age, sex, race, and state [14\u00ad16].\nDeath rates were computed by dividing the number of GUE\njusting on the basis of the 2000 US standard population [17].\nInfant deaths were divided into neonatal and postneonatal\ndeaths, and average annual neonatal and postneonatalmortality\ndenominator [18]. Three race categories (whites, blacks, and\nother races) were examined, but death rates were only calcu-\nlated for whites and blacks, because mortality is known to be\nunderestimated for other races [19]. Deaths were classified by\nregion of residence using the 9 US census divisions, each of\nwhich consisted of 3\u00ad9 contiguous states [20].\nGUE death rates excluding decedents with human immu-\nnodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS were also calculated to deter-\nmine the effect of HIV/AIDS on GUE mortality patterns. De-\ncedents with HIV/AIDS included any death with an ICD-9 code\ntality were analyzed by computing monthly GUE death rates.\nPopulation denominators were obtained from monthly post-\ncensal estimates of the US resident population by age [14]. The\nmonthly death rates were age-adjusted and plotted to identify\nseasonal patterns.\nThe number of GUE deaths was subject to random variation,\nso a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each death\nrate. Deaths were assumed to be distributed as a Poisson var-\niable when there were !100 deaths in a group and as a binomial\nvariable in other cases, in conformity with NCHS procedures\n[21]. The postcensal population estimates used to compute\ndeath rates were not subject to sampling error.\nThe proportion of GUE deaths in medical facilities, nursing\nhomes, and other places was examined using information about\nthe place of death.

Exact death rates could not be\ndetermined, because an unknown number of nursing home\nresidents were transferred to medical facilities before death, and\na medical facility was reported as the place of death. Instead,\na lower limit of the death rate for nursing home residents and\nan upper limit of the death rate for other elderly persons were\ncalculated by assuming that GUE deaths in nursing homes\nincluded all nursing home residents who died from GUE. The\ntrue GUE death rate was likely to be higher for nursing home\nresidents and lower for other elderly persons, depending on\nhow many fatal GUE cases were transferred from nursing\nhomes to medical facilities before death. The size and age dis-\ntribution of the elderly nursing home population was estimated\naveraged to obtain the 1996 nursing home population, and the\nother elderly population was determined by subtraction from\nthe total elderly population. The GUE death rate for each pop-\nulation was age-adjusted, and approximate 95% CIs were cal-\nculated using a formula provided by NCHS, because the public-\nuse version of the NNHS files does not include the information\nOther causes of death. The association between fatal GUE\nand other medical conditions was investigated by examining\nevery condition reported on 2% of GUE death records. Each\nof the 5570 ICD-9 codes used on the MCD files was treated\nas a separate condition, with 2 exceptions. The codes for HIV/\ncodes were not relevant for the analysis. The codes for extreme\ncombined, because these conditions were unlikely to be con-\nsistently differentiated on death certificates.

Previous studies have used\nPMRs in this manner to investigate hemochromatosis and neu-\nrofibromatosis mortality [25, 26]. The PMR for a specified\ncondition was defined as the observed number of GUE deaths\nassociated with the condition divided by the expected number\nof GUE deaths associated with the condition [27]. The expected\nnumber of deaths was determined by multiplying the number\nof GUE deaths by the proportion of all deaths associated with\nthe specified condition. Each PMR was standardized by sex and\ntional Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 95% CIs\nwere computed by assuming that GUE deaths were distributed\nas a Poisson variable when there were 1000 deaths with the\nspecified condition and as a binomial variable in other cases\n[28]. The value of each PMR indicates whether GUE decedents\nwere more likely ( ), equally likely ( ), or\nless likely ( ) to have the specified condition than all\ndecedents.\nThe conditions associated with GUE were likely to vary by\nage, so PMRs were also calculated for each condition reported\non 5% of the GUE death records for infants, nonelderly\npersons (aged 1\u00ad64 years), or elderly persons (aged 65 years).\nThe expected number of GUE deaths associated with each con-\ndition was determined in comparison to all deaths for the rel-\nevant age group.\nRESULTS\nan average of 4384 GUE deaths/year. This estimate excludes\n818 deaths from radiation gastroenteritis and 11 deaths from\ntoxic gastroenteritis. GUE was the underlying cause of death\nfor 34.2% of GUE decedents (table 2). GUE was more likely\nto be the underlying cause of death for decedents aged !15\nyears old than for older decedents. Only 10.3% of fatal GUE\ncases were reported to be infectious in origin, but the propor-\ntion of infectious cases was much higher for infants (81.1%)\nthan other age groups.

GUE mortality was 12% higher for males than\nfemales ( ) and 21% higher for blacks than whites\n( ). GUE mortality also varied by region. The death rate\nwas higher than the national average in the New England\n( ) and East North Central ( ) census divisions\nbut lower than the national average in the Mountain (P p\n) and West North Central ( ) census divisions.\nThe sex and racial differences in GUE mortality were reduced\nwhen the 740 decedents with HIV/AIDS were excluded, because\nthese individuals were disproportionately male (84%) and black\n(39%). In contrast, the age and regional differences were largely\nunaffected. When HIV/AIDS decedents were excluded, the\nGUE death rate was 4% higher for males than females (P p\n) and 8% higher for blacks than whites ( ) (data\nnot shown). The racial difference in mortality was greatest dur-\ning infancy, when the death rate was 14 times higher for blacks\nthan whites ( ) (figure 1). The racial difference decreased\nafter infancy and was reversed at the oldest ages, with the white\ndeath rate exceeding the black death rate at ages 75\u00ad84 years\n( ) and 85 years ( ). The age pattern of mor-\ntality was J-shaped for whites but U-shaped for blacks because\nof the higher mortality among black infants and lower mortality\namong blacks aged 75 years.\nThere were regular seasonal variations in the monthly age-\nyear, the death rate increased during the winter months and\ndecreased during the summer months. The maximum monthly\ndeath rate, in December or January, was 52%\u00ad70% higher than\nthe minimum monthly death rate, in August or September\n( in all 3 years). Approximately 47% of GUE deaths\noccurred during the 5 months from December through April,\na period that included 41% of the calendar year.\nMost GUE deaths occurred in inpatient hospital facilities\n(63%) or other medical settings (6%), but 18% were in nursing\nhomes and 11% were in residences. Nearly all (96%) of the\nFigure 2.

The average\nnumber of causes of death (including GUE) reported on death\ncertificates was 4.5 for GUE decedents versus 2.8 for other de-\ncedents. The other causes of death reported in conjunction with\nGUE included 31 medical conditions mentioned on 2% of\nGUE death records. Twenty-one conditions had a PMR 11.0 and\nwere associated with fatal GUE (table 4). The most common\nassociated condition was unspecified septicemia (bacteremia),\nwhich was mentioned in 16.4% of GUE deaths and occurred\ncomparison with all deaths. The second most common condition\nwas volume depletion. The other associated conditions included\na variety of disorders--notably, shock, renal failure, HIV/AIDS,\nanemia, short gestation/low birth weight, and electrolyte and\nfluid disorders.\nFour conditions mentioned on 2% of GUE death records\nhad a PMR of 1.0 and occurred as often as expected among\nGUE decedents, including cardiac arrest and diabetes without\nmention of complication (data not shown). The other 6 con-\nditions mentioned on 2% of GUE death records had a PMR\n!1.0 and occurred less often than expected, including 5 car-\ndiovascular conditions (data not shown).\nDifferences by age. Conditions with a PMR 11.0 men-\ntioned on 5% of the GUE death records for infants, noneld-\nerly, or elderly persons are reported in table 5. Fatal GUE was\nassociated with bacteremia, volume depletion, shock, and renal\nfailure in all 3 age groups and with respiratory arrest, cardiac\narrest, and pneumonia in 2 age groups. The most common\nconditions were short gestation/low birth weight and bacter-\nemia in infants; HIV/AIDS and bacteremia in nonelderly per-\nsons; and bacteremia and volume depletion in elderly persons.\nNine conditions appeared in only 1 age group: short gestation/\nlow birth weight, chronic perinatal respiratory disease (bron-\nchopulmonary dysplasia), and other specified intestinal dis-\norders in infants; HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cytomegalic inclusion\ndisease (cytomegalovirus infection), and cachexia in nonelderly\npersons; and chronic airway obstruction and malnutrition in\nelderly persons.\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study confirms that GUE is a significant cause of\ndeath in the United States. GUE was associated with 4400\ndeaths was comparable to the mortality burden from 3 diseases\nwith infectious etiologies: cervical cancer (4400 deaths), rheu-\nmatic fever and heart disease (4800 deaths), and hepatitis B\n5000 annual GUE deaths by Mead et al. [1], in part because\nthe present study excluded nearly 300 annual radiation and\ntoxic gastroenteritis deaths. The present study also relied ex-\nclusively on death certificate data, whereas Mead et al. [1] av-\neraged separate estimates on the basis of death certificate and\nhospital discharge data. The use of hospital discharge data to\nestimate the number of GUE deaths is problematic, because\n29% of the GUE deaths reported on death certificates occurred\noutside medical facilities.\nThe MCD files provide considerable information about the\ndemographic and medical characteristics of GUE deaths. The\nunderlying cause of death for 66% of GUE decedents was a\nmedical condition other than GUE, which suggests that fatal\nGUE usually occurred in individuals who were already ill and\nwere probably more susceptible to infection. However, only\n10% of fatal GUE cases were reported to be infectious, as in-\ncodes. Physicians may have described other GUE cases as pre-\nsumed infections, but these cases could not be identified be-\ncause the ICD-9 codes for gastroenteritis and diarrhea of pre-\nthe MCD files.\nGUE deaths in children had strikingly different character-\nistics from other GUE deaths. GUE was the predominant un-\nderlying cause of death for GUE decedents !15 years old, and\nmost fatal GUE in infants was reported to be infectious. Both\ncharacteristics are consistent with gastrointestinal infections\nthat were recognized at the time of death, although the causative\nagent was not reported on death certificates. GUE was also a\nmore important cause of mortality for infants and young chil-\ndren than older persons, particularly during the postneonatal\nTable 4.

On the basis of the definition used in the present study,\nGUE would have been the sixth leading cause of death for\npostneonates in 1997, after sudden infant death syndrome, con-\ngenital anomalies, accidents, pneumonia and influenza, and\nThere were large variations in the risk of death from GUE,\nespecially by age. GUE death rates were substantially higher\namong infants and elderly persons than other age groups, and\nthe age pattern of mortality resembled that for all categories\nof gastroenteritis combined [3]. Individuals 75 years old had\nthe highest GUE death rates and accounted for 58% of all GUE\ndeaths. Infants had the second highest GUE death rate and\naccounted for 7% of deaths. The age pattern of GUE mortality\nmay reflect age-related variations in exposure or susceptibility\nto unknown agents. Elderly persons are particularly susceptible\nto many foodborne agents because of changes in the immune\nand gastrointestinal systems during aging [33, 34].\nThe higher mortality rate from GUE during the postneonatal\nperiod than the neonatal period was unusual, because infant\nmortality from most major causes of death is lower during the\npostneonatal period [32]. One exception was infectious disease,\nwhich caused more deaths among postneonates than neonates\n[35]. The lower GUE mortality rate among neonates was not\nan artifact of the modified ICD-9 coding procedures for the\nMCD files, because the coding of infant gastroenteritis did not\nElderly nursing home residents had the highest risk of GUE\nmortality of any group examined in the present study and\naccounted for 17% of all GUE deaths, although they represent\n!1% of the US population. The risk of fatal GUE was 14 times\nhigher for elderly nursing home residents than other elderly\npersons, which confirms that GUE was a special problem for\nnursing home residents [3]. The difference in GUE mortality\nbetween nursing home residents and other elderly persons is\nalmost certainly understated, because some persons with fatal\nGUE were probably transferred from nursing homes to medical\nfacilities before death and, therefore, were classified in the pres-\nent study as \"other elderly\" persons. One study of nursing home\nresidents found that one-fourth of those who died were dis-\ncharged to a hospital before death [36]. If a similar proportion\nof nursing home residents with fatal GUE were hospitalized\nbefore death, then the GUE death rate has been substantially\nunderestimated for nursing home residents and overestimated\nfor other elderly persons.\nTable 5.

CI, confidence interval; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ICD-9, International Classification\nof Diseases, Ninth revision; n.e.c., not elsewhere classified.\nThe elevated risk of fatal GUE in the nursing home popu-\nlation is not surprising, because nursing home residents have\nhigh rates of chronic illness, malnutrition, and functional im-\npairments, such as bowel incontinence, that are conducive to\nthe spread of infection [37]. Outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis\nare common in nursing homes [38], including many attributed\nto unidentified foodborne agents [39]. Recent studies based on\nnew molecular diagnostic methods have indicated that most\ngastroenteritis outbreaks of unknown etiology in nursing homes\nwere actually caused by Norwalk-like viruses [40, 41]. This\nfinding suggests that some GUE deaths in nursing homes were\nalso due to Norwalk-like viruses. The role of Norwalk-like vi-\nruses in adult gastroenteritis mortality has not yet been estab-\nlished, but these agents might eventually emerge as an impor-\ntant cause of sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis, as well as\nmass outbreaks [42].\nThe risk of GUE mortality varied by sex, race, and region, as\nwell as by age and nursing home residence. Much of the differ-\nence in mortality by sex and race was due to the high proportion\nof males and blacks among GUE decedents with HIV/AIDS.Even\nafter decedents with HIV/AIDS were excluded, the risk of fatal\nGUE was higher for males than females and for blacks than\nwhites. The reason why the risk was higher for males is unclear,\nbut sex differences in behavior affecting exposure to unknown\nfoodborne agents might play a role. Compared with females,\nmales were more likely to engage in several unsafe food prepa-\nration and consumption practices that increased exposure to\npathogens in foods of animal origin [43, 44].\nThe racial difference in GUE mortality varied by age and\nwas reversed at the oldest ages. However, the mortality \"cross-\nover\" at the oldest ages was probably exaggerated by age mis-\nreporting on death certificates for elderly blacks, which causes\nblack death rates to be underestimated at the oldest ages [45,\n46]. As a result, the true age pattern of GUE mortality for\nblacks might be J-shaped rather than U-shaped. The reason\nfor the racial difference in GUE mortality was unknown, but\nthe relationship between GUE and short gestation/low birth\nweight suggests that racial differences in birth characteristics\nmight contribute to the higher GUE mortality among black\nof white births [47]. Other factors increasing GUE mortality\namong black infants might include racial differences in ma-\nternal characteristics affecting the use of medical care [2, 6].\nThe regional variation in GUE mortality was greater than\nthe differences by sex or race. The GUE death rate was 26%\nhigher in New England than in the Mountain census division,\nthe regions with the highest and lowest GUE mortality. Geo-\ngraphic variations in the incidence of illness may be typical of\nfoodborne agents. For example, the Foodborne Diseases Active\nSurveillance Network (FoodNet) [48] has found large geo-\ngraphic variations in the incidence of culture-confirmed illness\ndue to most of the foodborne pathogens under surveillance.\nThe seasonal increase in GUE mortality during the winter\nmonths was suggestive of a viral etiology, because the incidence\nof gastroenteritis due to Norwalk-like viruses, rotavirus, and\nastrovirus is also higher during the winter months [49\u00ad51]. In\ncontrast, the incidence of culture-confirmed illness due to most\nof the foodborne bacterial and parasitic pathogens monitored\nby FoodNet was higher during the summer months or else did\nnot vary seasonally [48]. Viral agents that cause acute gastro-\nenteritis, including Norwalk-like viruses, rotavirus, and astro-\nvirus, are less likely to be transmitted by food than are most\nother gastrointestinal pathogens [1], so the unknown agents\nthat caused GUE may not have been predominantly foodborne.\nThe present study did not examine age differences in the sea-\nsonality of GUE mortality, because the monthly number of GUE\ndeaths for most age groups was subject to a high degree of\nrandom variation. Other studies have found that deaths from all\ncategories of gastroenteritis were higher during the winter among\nyoung children and elderly persons, although the winter peak\namong children became less prominent after 1985, probably be-\ncause of a decrease in rotavirus mortality [3, 52]. Rotavirus often\ncauses severe gastroenteritis in children, but many rotavirus in-\nfections are never identified [53]. However, few GUE deaths were\nlikely to be unidentified rotavirus infections, because rotavirus\nis estimated to cause only 20 deaths/year [54].\nPhysicians reported more causes of death, on average, for\nGUE decedents than other decedents, which suggests that GUE\ncases were relatively more complicated. The PMRs comparing\nGUE deaths with all deaths indicate that a variety of different\nmedical conditions were associated with fatal GUE. Many of\nthese conditions were indicative of incomplete reporting of the\ncauses of death. Ten conditions had ICD-9 codes with the term\n\"unspecified\" in the title, because physicians did not provide\nenough information to allow coders to assign a more specific\ncode. Two other conditions--respiratory arrest and shock--are\ncited on the US standard death certificate as examples of modes\nof dying that should not be reported as causes of death [11].\nIt was unclear why physicians reported these nonspecific con-\nditions. One possible explanation is that the conditions were\ncaused by the same unknown agents responsible for fatal GUE,\nprecluding a complete diagnosis. Alternatively, nonspecific di-\nagnoses may have been erroneously recorded on death certif-\nicates in place of specific diagnoses [55].\nBacteremia was the condition most commonly associated\nwith fatal GUE. The etiology of bacteremia was apparently un-\ndetermined, because bloodstream infections were coded as\nICD-9 038.9 (unspecified septicemia) when there was no men-\ntion of a causative agent on the death certificate. Gastroenteritis\nis a possible complication of bacteremia [56], so some cases of\nGUE may have resulted from infections of sites other than the\ngastrointestinal tract. However, the association between GUE\nand bacteremia may also indicate that unknown agents that\ncaused GUE could invade the bloodstream, like certain gastro-\nintestinal pathogens, notably Salmonella species.\nSeveral other conditions associated with GUE were possible\ncomplications of severe gastroenteritis, including volume de-\npletion, shock, electrolyte and fluid disorders, and cardiac arrest\n[3]. Volume depletion occurred 9.6 times more often than ex-\npected and was present in 13% of GUE deaths, making it the\nsecond most common condition associated with GUE. The\nfrequent mention of volume depletion may indicate that GUE\ndecedents did not always receive timely treatment for gastro-\nintestinal fluid losses. Volume depletion was less likely to be\npresent in GUE deaths among infants (5%) than nonelderly\n(12%) or elderly (14%) persons, perhaps because infants were\nmore likely to receive rehydration therapy.\nSome conditions associated with GUE could also be caused\nby Shiga toxin\u00adproducing pathogens (Shigella dysenteriae type 1,\nEscherichia coli O157:H7, and other Shiga toxin\u00adproducing E.\ncoli strains). Infection by these pathogens may result in hem-\norrhagic colitis or hemolytic uremic syndrome (characterized by\nacute renal failure, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia),\nas well as gastroenteritis. Nearly 4% of GUE decedents had gas-\ntrointestinal hemorrhage and 2% had vascular insufficiency of\nthe intestine (ischemic colitis), conditions similar to hemorrhagic\ncolitis. GUE was not associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome\nbut was associated with acute renal failure (7% of decedents)\nand unspecified anemia (4% of decedents). Overall, 13% of GUE\ndecedents had gastrointestinal hemorrhage,ischemiccolitis,acute\nrenal failure, or unspecified anemia.\nShiga toxin\u00adproducing pathogens are estimated to cause\n160 deaths per year [1], assuming that S. dysenteriae type 1\nis responsible for most of the estimated deaths due to Shigella\nspecies. However, only 20 deaths/year are reported on death\ncertificates, under the assumption that all of the deaths on the\nsoning (005.8) were caused by Shiga toxin\u00adproducing patho-\ngens. The discrepancy between the numbers of reported and\nestimated deaths implies that most fatal infections due to Shiga\ntoxin\u00adproducing pathogens were not reported on death cer-\ntificates. Some of these unreported infections may have been\nincluded instead among the GUE deaths involving gastroin-\ntestinal hemorrhage, ischemic colitis, acute renal failure, or\nunspecified anemia.\nGUE was associated with unspecified renal failure and disorder\nof the kidney and ureter, as well as acute renal failure. One or\nmore of these conditions was reported in 13% of GUE deaths.\nGUE decedents were more likely than all decedents to have cer-\ntain conditions that could result in renal failure, including bac-\nteremia, volume depletion, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.\nGUE decedents who were hospitalized before death were also at\nrisk of nosocomial renal insufficiency [57].\nOther conditions associated with GUE made individuals\nmore susceptible to infection. The most important example\nwas HIV/AIDS, which was present in 6% of GUE deaths and\noccurred 4.0 times more often than expected. Nearly all (99%)\nof the GUE decedents with HIV/AIDS were nonelderly persons.\nSome (24%) of the nonelderly persons with HIV/AIDS also\nhad cytomegalovirus infections, a common cause of diarrhea\nin patients with HIV/AIDS [58]. It was unclear whether cy-\ntomegalovirus was responsible for gastroenteritis in these de-\ncedents, because cytomegalovirus can affect other organs with-\nout involving the gastrointestinal tract.\nChronic illness may also predispose individuals to infection.\nFive of the conditions associated with GUE typically occurred\nin chronically ill or debilitated individuals, including pneu-\nmonia due to unspecified organisms, chronic airway obstruc-\ntion, malnutrition, organic brain syndrome, and pneumonitis\ndue to inhalation of food or vomitus. Overall, 25% of GUE\ndeaths involved 1 of these 5 conditions, including 33% of\nthe deaths among elderly nursing home residents. The asso-\nciation with GUE was strongest in the case of malnutrition,\nwhich occurred 3.9 times more often than expected.\nThe association between GUE and pneumonia might also\nindicate that fatal pneumonia due to unidentified agents some-\ntimes involved gastrointestinal symptoms. Acute gastroenteritis\nof unknown etiology accompanied by respiratory symptoms\nhas traditionally been attributed to respiratory, rather than gas-\ntrointestinal, pathogens [1]. If the 420 annual GUE deaths as-\nsociated with pneumonia due to unspecified organisms were\nclassified as respiratory rather than gastrointestinal mortality,\nthe number of GUE deaths would be reduced by nearly 10%.\nThe classification of GUE deaths involving pneumonia is less\nconsequential for estimates of respiratory mortality, because\n486 for pneumonia due to unspecified organisms.\nA majority (56%) of infant GUE deaths were premature or\nlow birth weight. Fatal GUE might be associated with short\ngestations because the immune response is more deficient in\npremature infants than other infants [56], increasing the risk\nof infection. Low birth weight has also been identified as a risk\nfactor for infant mortality from all categories of gastroenteritis\n[6]. The association between GUE and 2 other conditions in\ninfants might be related to the use of dexamethasone; infant\nGUE deaths were 3.6 times more likely to involve broncho-\npulmonary dysplasia and 21.2 times more likely to involve other\nspecified disorders of the intestine than all infant deaths. Bron-\nchopulmonary dysplasia develops in premature infants receiv-\ning mechanical ventilatory support and is sometimes treated\nwith dexamethasone, an adrenocortical steroid that impairs the\nimmune response [59]. Low-birth-weight infants treated with\ndexamethasone are also at risk of perforation of the intestine,\none of the conditions classified under other specified disorders\nof the intestine [60].\nPossible explanations for the association between GUE and\n2 other conditions can also be identified. The most likely ex-\nplanation for the association with cardiac dysrhythmia was dis-\nturbance of cardiac function by electrolyte imbalances resulting\nfrom severe diarrhea [56]. Dysrhythmia might also result from\nthe use of drugs with proarrhythmic effects, such as erythro-\nmycin, a macrolide antibiotic recommended for treating di-\narrhea due to Campylobacter species, the most common cause\nof foodborne gastroenteritis [61, 62]. The most likely expla-\nnation for the association between GUE and urinary tract in-\nfections was nosocomial infection, because diarrhea is a risk\nfactor for nosocomial urinary tract infections, particularly in\npatients with an indwelling catheter [63]. Alternatively, the un-\nknown agents that caused GUE may have been able to invade\nthe urinary tract, like one of the most common gastrointestinal\npathogens, Salmonella species [64].\nIn summary, the information reported on death certificates\nsuggests that fatal GUE was often due to infectious agents. All\nof the GUE deaths where gastroenteritis was described as in-\ninvolved infectious agents. Infectious agents likely were also\npresent when GUE was the underlying cause of death and when\nGUE occurred together with bacteremia or pneumonia. Other\naspects of GUE mortality that were consistent with an infectious\netiology included the seasonal increase in mortality during the\nwinter months [3] and the association with HIV/AIDS and\ncertain chronic conditions, such as malnutrition, that increased\nsusceptibility to infection.\nAlthough fatal GUE was often due to infectious agents, the\ninformation provided on death certificates was insufficient to\ndetermine whether GUE was caused by unknown, predomi-\nnantly foodborne agents, as proposed by Mead et al. [1]. Death\ncertificates do not indicate why physicians ruled out known\ncauses of gastroenteritis or record how the agents that caused\nGUE were transmitted. More research is needed to assess how\nGUE was diagnosed and to identify the risk factors for fatal\nGUE to determine whether the agents that caused GUE were\nunknown or transmitted by food.\nThe most important limitation of the present study is the\nuncertain accuracy of death certificate data on causes of death.\nReported causes of death may be incomplete or even inaccurate\n[65\u00ad68]. The most frequent errors made by physicians include\nomitting some causes of death and listing nonspecific rather\nthan specific diagnoses [55, 66]. Infectious conditions are par-\nticularly likely to be underreported, including conditions due\nto gastrointestinal pathogens such as Vibrio vulnificus and Cryp-\ntosporidium parvum [1, 69, 70]. The accuracy of gastroenteritis\nreporting on death certificates has not been investigated and\nmerits attention, in view of the effect on estimates of GUE\nmortality. One important issue is whether physicians correctly\nruled out known causes of gastroenteritis, such as Shiga toxin\u00ad\nproducing pathogens or adverse drug reactions [71]. Another\nimportant issue is whether physicians sometimes erroneously\nreported a nonspecific diagnosis of gastroenteritis or diarrhea,\nrather than a specific cause such as a known pathogen.\nOther shortcomings of death certificate data include the un-\nreliable information about American Indian, Native Alaskan,\nAsian, and Pacific Islander mortality, the errors in age report-\ning for elderly blacks, and the absence of a variable identify-\ning nursing home residents. In addition, information about\nwhether GUE was described as a presumed infection on death\ncertificates was not available, because ICD-9 codes 009.1 and\n009.3, for gastroenteritis and diarrhea of presumed infectious\norigin, were not used on the MCD files.\nThe PMRs used in the present study also have limitations.\nA high PMR for one condition will necessarily result in a low\nPMR for other conditions, because the PMR is a ratio and the\nnumber of deaths from all causes is fixed [27]. This relationship\nmay explain why GUE decedents were less likely to have certain\ncardiovascular conditions than all decedents. However, PMRs\nare a good approximation of standardized mortality ratios when\nthe 2 groups being compared have the same overall death rate\nfrom all causes [27]. The true group at risk of fatal GUE is\nunknown, but the results from the present study indicate that\nmost or all of the US population was likely to be at risk, because\nGUE deaths occurred in every age, sex, race, and geographic\ncategory examined. Therefore, the group at risk of fatal GUE\nprobably had the same overall death rate as the US population,\nand the PMRs reported here are likely to approximate stan-\ndardized mortality ratios.\nThe PMR analysis involved multiple comparisons, increasing\nthe likelihood that GUE would be significantly associated with\nsome conditions simply by chance. At the conventional sig-\nnificance level of , 1 or 2 of 31 conditions reported in\n2% of GUE deaths would be associated with GUE by chance.\nIn fact, 21 conditions were associated with GUE, so most of\nthe associations were unlikely to be due to chance. Many of\nthe conditions associated with GUE were possible complica-\ntions of gastroenteritis, disorders that could be caused by\nknown gastrointestinal pathogens or conditions that increased\nsusceptibility to infection, further increasing confidence in the\nvalidity of the analysis.\nThe GUE death rates reported here are provisional, because\nmately be superseded by intercensal estimates. The postcensal\nestimates are projections based on the 1990 census, whereas\nthe intercensal estimates are interpolations based on the 1990\nand 2000 censuses. At the time of the study, intercensal esti-\nmates were available only for the US population by state and\nulation was 1.6% higher than the postcensal estimate, because\nthe population enumerated in 2000 was larger than had been\nprojected [73]. As a result, the GUE death rates reported here\nwould be slightly lower if intercensal population estimates were\nused for the denominator in place of the postcensal estimates.\nThe findings from the present study have important impli-\ncations for efforts to reduce gastroenteritis mortality. Many\nGUE deaths occurred in individuals who were susceptible to\ninfection, including patients with HIV/AIDS, persons with\nchronic illness, and nursing home residents. Other GUE deaths\nwere associated with serious conditions, such as bacteremia or\nacute renal failure, that may have been caused by the same\nunknown agents responsible for GUE. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to prevent such deaths without first achieving a\nbetter understanding of the etiology of GUE.\n"
