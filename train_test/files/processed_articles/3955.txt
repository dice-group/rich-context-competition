Based on the\nmathematical framework known as graph theory, SNA uti-\nlises a formal language for developing concepts and ideas\nin order to describe patterns of interaction between indi-\nviduals. Graph theory affords the representation of rela-\ntional information in a sociogram or graph, as was originally\nposited in the early 1930s by Jacob Moreno, who is consid-\nered the pioneer of the use of graph theory for identifying\nproperties of social networks. Relational information is\nincorporated in a sociogram by drawing points and lines.\nPoints, also named nodes or vertices in different nomencla-\ntures, represent individuals. Lines, edges or arcs, when\npresent, depict the existence of relationships between these\nIncreased interest in analysing criminal networks has\nencouraged the use of SNA as an analytic tool to investigate\nthem. Scott and Carrington (2011) suggested that criminal net-\nworks are formed by people who are involved in `networked\nactivities'. This definition leads to a better explanation of the\nnature of criminal relationships by highlighting the fact that\nindividuals committing crimes need to be organised. Since a\nnetwork provides a reliable mechanism for optimising resource\nexchanges (Bright, 2015), we speculate that the more criminal\nactivities are planned and coordinated by individuals, the bet-\nter organised and effective a criminal group becomes. This\naspect is particularly relevant for criminal networks in which\nactions should remain maximally undercover to limit the pos-\nsibility that individuals committing a crime would be detected.\nWe suggest that in order to investigate criminal networks, it is\nnecessary to focus on people's participation in criminal actions\nand how they maximise their efficiency under secrecy.\nWe conceptualised a network model (Brandes et al., 2013)\nas based on two distinct aspects of social interactions in a\nTemporal dynamics in covert networks\nChiara Broccatelli, Martin Everett and Johan Koskinen\n Keywords\nSocial Network Analysis, covert networks, criminal networks, two-mode networks, temporal dynamics, bipartite graphs,\ndynamic line-graphs\nThe Mitchell Centre for Social Network Analysis, School of Social\nSciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK\nCorresponding author:\nChiara Broccatelli, The Mitchell Centre for Social Network Analysis,\nSchool of Social Sciences, University of Manchester, Arthur Lewis\nBuilding, Bridgeford Street, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.\nEmail: chiara.broccatelli@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk\nOriginal Article\n2 Methodological Innovations\ncovert context. The first aspect refers to the idea of coopera-\ntion since individuals joining actions together are coopera-\ntively involved in the realisation of a specific criminal and/or\ncovert intent. The second aspect considers the fact that covert\nactions are simultaneous. Individuals involved in the same\naction, in fact, act simultaneously and in a specific point in\ntime. When few members of a criminal organisation are\ninvolved in performing the same task, such as terrorist\nattacks, secret meetings and violent protests, the relationship\nbetween each pair of these individuals involved can be\ndefined as a concurrent partnership since their relationships\noverlap in time. The main implication of including the idea\nof partnerships overlapping in time (Moody et al., 2005) in\nour network model is that of emphasising the relevance of\nthe time dimension as a central aspect for the analysis of cov-\nert networks.\nOur article seeks to contribute to the work on the analysis\nof longitudinal networks by proposing an alternative method\nfor representing temporal dynamics. The article proceeds as\nfollows. First, we review some of the existing SNA works\nthat considered the issue of time, and, second, we provide an\noverview of recent contributions related to temporal dynam-\nics in the specific field of criminal networks. Third, after a\ntheoretical introduction of our approach, we demonstrate the\nutility of the method on three real covert network data sets.\nRelated work\nThe issue of time is of increasing importance in SNA, result-\ning in considerable interest in analysing dynamic networks\nthe area of longitudinal network analyses use several meth-\nods for analysing the fluid nature of networks over time. We\ncategorised the research themes into five research areas by\nexamining how the aspect of time is considered and what\nmethods are used.\nThe first area of research focused on network temporal\ndynamics mainly for analysing the propagation of diseases\nand the risk of transmission of infections by using statistical\nend times of relationships influenced the level of reachability\namong individuals since overlapping relationships offered\nalternative routes of diffusion, as well as making some tra-\nversing paths impossible. The second area of research\naddressed the issue of time by partitioning a given time win-\ndow in a series of temporal snapshots, or intervals. Through\nthe analyses of network properties in each time interval,\nthese authors focused on the evolution of group and commu-\nnitystructures(NakaoandRomney,1993;Tantipathananandh\net al., 2007) as well as node level measures (Kim and\nAnderson, 2012). The third area went beyond a descriptive\nanalysis of how time constraints affected network properties\nby utilising an actor-oriented model, namely the stochastic\nactor-oriented model (SAOM), for examining the\nco-evolution of social networks and individual behaviours\ncesses modelled using the SAOM include homophily ten-\ndencies (Lazega et al., 2012) and mechanisms based on\nsocial capital (Agneessens and Wittek, 2012). The fourth\narea of research referred to a specific framework and data\nstructure, namely the Relational Event Model. This model\nfor analysing longitudinal networks defined human actions,\nsuch as a chain of events, related to each other through the\nfact that individuals took part together in these actions (Butts,\n2008). The ties are events and as such instantaneous as\nopposed to standard social network ties that are considered\nstates. Finally, the last area relied upon new visualisation\nmethods for providing a better representation of temporal\nnetworks. An important contribution came from Moody et al.\n(2005). These authors proposed to combine an animation\ntechnique, which shows the heterogeneity between tempo-\nrally adjacent network slices, with summary statistics of net-\nwork properties that capture the proportion of arcs changing\nfrom iteration to iteration. Another recent contribution in\nterms of visualisation techniques has been provided by\nBrandes et al. (2012). By referring to SAOM, in this article,\nthe authors focused on the co-evolution of networks and\nindividual behaviours over a sequence of time slices. In par-\nticular, they provided algorithms in order to capture the level\nof homogeneity among individuals as well as to detect indi-\nviduals with different behaviour through the visualisation of\ndiscrepancies between simulated and observed statistics.\nThe idea we propose in this article falls in this last cate-\ngory. Specifically, our contribution introduces a different\ntechnique for the representation and visualisation of longitu-\ndinal networks composed of two different entities such as\nindividuals and events.\nLongitudinal analyses in the field of criminal networks\nare rare. Some authors measured individuals' centrality over\na series of tasks temporally ordered (Toth et al., 2013) or\ncompared the level of stability and prominence reached by\nindividuals in several time snapshots (Sharara et al., 2012).\nOthers examined structural changes over time (Helfstein\nand Wright, 2011) and analysed the network's growth from\nthe perspective of roles played by individuals in order to\nkeep the network flexible and balanced between secrecy\nand efficiency (Bright and Delaney, 2013). Moreover,\nCunningham et al. (2015) used the SAOM to capture the\nimportance of pre-existing ties in a terrorist network. In\naddition, some authors focused on longitudinal studies to\nreveal how individual positions change over time using a\nblockmodeling approach (Xu et al., 2004) and along several\nFinally, criminologists have begun to develop a new per-\nspective for analysing the evolution of a criminal action. In\nthis perspective, the analysis of criminal activities integrates\nSNA with the crime script analysis. A criminal action is\ninterpreted as several logical phases, each characterised by\nspecific tasks that need to be accomplished. Since each actor\nBroccatelli et al. 3\nis then associated with a specific task, this technique can\nreveal the involvement of actors over the sequential steps\nand highlighting the presence of subgroups of offenders spe-\ncialised in a specific task (Bruinsma and Bernasco, 2004) as\nwell as the role each actor played for the success of the oper-\nThe above-mentioned methods for analysing temporal\nnetwork dynamics present some limitations that influence\ntheir possible applications in the field of covert networks.\nFirst, the applicability of these approaches is affected by the\nfact that these methods mostly require to split arbitrarily the\nwhole time window into several temporally adjacent inter-\nvals. These time intervals tend to not totally capture the\ndynamicity of network changes over time since they do not\ncontrol what happen in the given network between one interval\nand the next. Depending on how the time intervals have been\nidentified, in fact, the distinction of time windows into sepa-\nrate snapshots can either underestimate or overestimate the\nconnections among actors resulting in a partial understand-\ning of how the given network evolves over time. Second, a\nmore specific limitation concerning the use of applying these\nmethods for analysing covert networks is due to the paucity\nof time data information. Most of the time, in fact, research-\ners in the field of covert networks do not know the exact start\nand end time of a relationship and/or the duration of these\ninteractions (Gerdes, 2014); often they have information\nonly about the occurred events.\nIn this paper, we provide an alternative method for partially\novercoming these limitations in order to represent the tempo-\nral evolution of a covert network and the turnover of actors. In\nparticular, the main advantage of our proposed method is the\npossibility of visualising the given network by maintaining the\nlinear progression of succeeding actions exactly as these\noccurred and in which individuals took place together.\nModel\nThe purpose of this section is to state the assumptions on the\nbasis of our model, to reveal from where we get an inspira-\ntion for building our technique and to clearly define which\nare the entities composing our pattern of relationships.\nIn this study, we assume that for analysing temporal\ndynamics, it is necessary to focus on two aspects of people's\nparticipation in actions, events or tasks: (1) the temporal\nproximity between individuals; and (2) the individuals' tra-\njectories of participation in these actions over time. The first\naspect corresponds to tendencies towards collaboration and\nreflects who collaborates with whom. The second aspect\nrefers to how often an individual attended an activity and/or\nperformed a task during the time considered. By following\nthe individual participation in activities over time, it is pos-\nsible to have a good sense of individuals' engagement in\nactions over the time considered. Through the bi-dynamic\nline-graph representation, it is possible to capture those\ndynamics and make them directly visible into the graph.\nThe pioneering work by Moody (2009) theorised a\ndynamic network projection for one-mode networks in order\nto analyse the channels of transmission of diseases. In this\ncase, every edge between a pair of individuals is represented\nas a node, and new directed edges are added in the case in\nwhich the nodes share an individual. By recording the dura-\ntion of relationships as an attribute for each edge, Moody\nused this dynamic line-graph in order to analyse the diffusion\nof infections.\nIn this article, we build a similar dynamic line-graph pro-\njection for two-mode networks. Although Alexander pro-\nposed the use of the line-graph representation as a reliable\noption for visualising bipartite networks (Alexander, 2005),\nwe partially referred to Moody's principles in order to incor-\nporate the time dynamics in the line-graph. In the next para-\ngraphs, we explain the steps that are necessary in order to\nrealise our adaption of a dynamic line-graph representation\nfor two-mode networks.\nThe process of constructing the bi-dynamic line-graph\nfrom the original two-mode network is composed of three\nseparate steps. First, we consider a two-mode network in its\nbipartite network structure. The bipartite network is an indi-\nviduals-by-events matrix of affiliations where rows and col-\numns contain both individuals and events and only ties\nbetween individuals and events exist (Borgatti et al., 2013).\nSecond, from the bipartite network, we generate a line-graph\nprojection. With the line-graph, edges between individuals\nand events are transformed to nodes. As a result, in this visu-\nalisation, a node represents an edge between an individual\nand an event of the original two-mode graph. By construc-\ntion, all nodes representing the same actor joining events are\nconnected by an edge. In order to track individual's histories\nof participation in events, we use a reduction criterion for\nties. This criterion implies the exclusion of ties providing\nredundant information. Thus, in the third step, we reduce ties\nby maintaining only edges which connect nodes representing\nthe same actor joining events based on the sequence in which\nthese events occurred. The point of this construction is that\nevery individual attending an event in a specific point of time\nis represented by a node. If an individual participates in suc-\nceeding events, there are as many nodes as the number of\nevents in which the individual took place and these nodes are\nsequentially connected by a path. For example, a node refer-\nring to individual A participating at event 1 (A1) will have an\noutgoing tie only towards the node referring to individual A\nparticipating at event 2 (A2). If A also joined event 4, there\nwill be another outgoing tie between A2 and A4, throughout\na link between A1 and A4 is not present.\nIn a bi-dynamic line-graph, two sets of ties can be distin-\nguished: reciprocal and uni-directional (we refer to the latter\nas `directed' henceforth). Reciprocal ties connect nodes rep-\nresenting different actors who have been engaged in activi-\nties together simultaneously. In this case, reciprocal ties\ngenerate clusters and reflect the level of collaboration\nbetween individuals. Directed ties, on the contrary, link\n4 Methodological Innovations\nnodes referring to the same individual who have attended\nseveral events over time. These two sets of ties depict tem-\nporal dynamics in terms of common participation in activi-\nties as well as individual's engagement during time. In other\nwords, while reciprocal ties capture the extent of the indi-\nvidual's propensity of collaboration, directed ties follow the\nindividual's participation in events over time. An example\nof the dynamic line-graph representation is given in Figure\nIn the case of covert networks, reciprocal ties connect\nnodes referring to individuals who took part together in\nactivities such as terrorist attacks, secret meetings and vio-\nlent protests. A typical example is a member of a terrorist\ngroup who is actively engaged in a bombing attack and\nthrough the interactions with other participants establishes\nreciprocal relationships. By contrast, directed ties link nodes\ncorresponding to a same individual who participated in sev-\neral activities over time. For each active actor, there is a\ndirected tie starting from the first action in which he partici-\npated to the following one until the last action in which the\nindividual took part. Directed ties reveal the history of the\nindividual's presence in the criminal organisation.\nWhy are bi-dynamic line-graph\nrepresentations really necessary?\nIn this section, we briefly discuss some advantages as well as\nsome limitations related to the use of our visualisation tech-\nnique of representing two-mode networks. An intuitive way\nto understand the advantages of a bi-dynamic line-graph rep-\nresentation is to compare an original two-mode network\nwith its one-mode projection as well as with its bi-dynamic\nline-graph representation. In the two-mode representation,\nFigure 1(a), individuals are depicted as points, whereas events\nare represented by squares. When an individual attended\nan event, a tie connects the individual (point) and the\nevent (square). Since most SNA methods are developed for\none-mode networks, traditionally authors prefer to convert\nthe two-mode network into a one-mode network. Through\nthis conversion, the two-mode network is transformed into a\none-mode network in which individuals are linked to each\nother to the extent that they participate in at least one event\ntogether (Borgatti et al., 2013). Here, all vertices are individu-\nals (point), and a tie between a pair of vertices represents the\nfact that these individuals share person-to-person interactions\nby attending the same event. Unfortunately, the one-mode\nprojection suffers from a loss of information regarding the\nparticipation in events (Borgatti and Everett, 1997; Opsahl,\nwhich a person accomplished an activity (event) by himself,\nthis information would not be recorded in the one-mode pro-\njection. Second, visually speaking, unless the researcher\nchanges the thickness of the edges, it is impossible to quantify\nhow many times individuals have been involved in common\nactivities. By comparison, the bi-dynamic line-graph better\ncaptures the evolution of an individual's engagement in the\nevents over time. Figure 1 shows an example of two-mode\nnetwork (a) and, respectively, its corresponding one-mode\nnetwork (b) and the bi-dynamic line-graph (c).\nUsing a matrix representation, relational information is\nexpressed by an adjacency matrix where rows and columns\nrepresent points and values `1' into cells intersecting these\npoints indicate the presence of a tie between them.\nSociograms and matrices can be considered as two sides of\nthe same coin since adjacency and affiliation matrices may\nbe represented as graphs and graphs can be translated into\nmatrices. The matrices of the network visualisations showed\nin Figure 1 are reported in Figure 2.\nFigure 1. (a) The two-mode network representation, (b) the one-mode projection of the two-mode and (c) the bi-dynamic line-graph\nrepresentation of the matrices in Figure 2.\nBroccatelli et al. 5\nThe bi-dynamic line-graph replaces the standard node-as-\npoint representation in favour of a node-as-edge representa-\ntion. This dynamic representation can offer a different way\nfor visualising to what extent a network changes and evolves\nover time. The advantages of using a bi-dynamic line-graph\nrepresentation can be discussed under three headings.\nSubstantively, the first advantage is due to the fact that the\ntime dimension is directly incorporated into the graph,\ninstead of, for example, being added as an attribute or a prop-\nerty to the edges. In the bi-dynamic line-graph, in fact, the\nsequence of human interactions directly reflects how indi-\nviduals have been engaged in actions over time. Nodes, rep-\nresenting edges between individuals and events, are added as\nthey appear and straightforwardly can reveal how the net-\nwork materialises during the time.\nThe second advantage concerns the fact that with the bi-\ndynamic line-graph, it is not necessary to divide the whole\ntime window into time intervals as is, for example, required\nwith the SAOM method. This representation of the dynamic\nnetwork is also distinct from decay-based approaches (e.g.,\nHolme and Saram\u00e4ki, 2012). The main implication of that is\nthe chance for researchers of avoiding to make arbitrary\ndecisions in identifying time slices. All time steps corre-\nsponding to events, are, in fact, directly taken into account,\nand actions, linked together by the common participation of\nindividuals, are represented as a chain, in a sort of continu-\nous social process.\nFinally, since our bi-dynamic line-graph is specifically\ndesigned for two-mode networks, this last advantage refers\nto the possibility of utilising directly the two-mode network\nformat instead of the one-mode projection of the two-mode.\nThe use of the original affiliation matrix makes unnecessary\nthe loss of information that occurs when a two-mode\nnetwork is transformed in its one-mode conversion and to\nconsider both events and individuals as equally important\nBeside the advantages, we also need to consider the disad-\nvantages of our representation. To begin with, the bi-dynamic\nline-graph does not capture clearly the temporal dynamics\namong events. On the one hand, events may happen closely\ntogether in time, but, on the other hand, they might be sepa-\nrated by long periods of inactivity during which nothing has\nbeen recorded. In the current form of a bi-dynamic line-\ngraph, time interval between events is not considered. This\nimplies that even though the bi-dynamic line-graph takes\ninto account the successive aspect of the sequential events, it\nis not possible yet to reveal how these events are positioned\nby considering the whole time window.\nMoreover, for the purpose of the present work, we do not\nconsider the aspect of the duration of events. We follow the\nconvention of relational events and treat the events as instan-\ntaneous, allowing us to consider only the order and possibly\nthe time in-between events. For convenience, our basic\nassumption is that any actor can only be in one place at any\none point in time. Although there is a possibility that two\nevents may happen simultaneously and that, for instance,\nactor A participating in an event B precludes participating in\nany other event taking place at the same time, we speculate\nthat this possibility would be relevant only in very specific\ncases. As an example, we may consider the case in which a\nterrorist cannot take part in a terrorist attack since this person\nis already attending a training camp that lasts for a few\nmonths and occurs at the exact same time of the attack.\nSimilarly, our approach is not suited to explain such things as\ncoordinated attacks. However, this is not a serious restriction\nin our case due to the nature of events considered. In fact, for\nthe examples considered here, events, which correspond to\nviolent protests, terrorist kidnappings and Mafia meetings,\nnever overlap in time.\nFinally, a third limitation concerns the specific matrix for-\nmat of the bi-dynamic line-graphs. As mentioned earlier, the\nbi-dynamic line-graph matrix presents contemporarily two\nset of ties, reciprocal and directed. Due to this format, stand-\nard SNA measurements need to be adjusted in order to be\nutilised. As such, at the moment, our representations can\nonly be seen as a basis for narrative about individuals'\ninvolvement in criminal activities over time. Looking at who\njoined the actions, at which point in time and with whom,\ngives us the possibility of following and tracking the indi-\nvidual's histories of participation in actions over time and,\ntherefore, it may provide insights about the hidden strategi-\ncal organisation and structural dynamics within these covert\nnetworks.\nIn this article, we hope to demonstrate how this represen-\ntation can be a useful initial step for investigating the stabil-\nity of peoples' engagement as well as the turnover of\nindividual embeddedness in activities during the time. We\nwill now present some examples of the use of a bi-dynamic\nFigure 2.

In the United Kingdom, mem-\nbers of the WSPU engaged in the campaign were arrested\nand prosecuted by the authorities in order to maintain the\ncurrent status quo. As a result, Suffragettes used to act in\nsecrecy, particularly when they organised meetings for plan-\nning their protests. This particular data set concerns the co-\nparticipation in events occurring in Bristol and Bath from\nthis data set, events correspond to meetings, demonstrations,\nprotests and vandalism acts. Data have been reconstructed\nby considering historical sources of information such as\nSuffragettes' diaries, autobiographies and local newspapers\n(Edwards, 2014). This network is an example of a Covert\nSocial Movement Network, characterised by a strong orien-\ntation towards a political and social change by acting protests\nand violent acts (Crossley et al., 2012).\nPhilippines terrorist network.This network mostly refers to\nAbu Sayyaf Group (ASG), a terrorist movement operating in\nthe Southeast Asia. In particular, these data are related to the\nSalafist extremist movement, founded by Aburajak Janjalani,\na native terrorist of the Southern Philippines in 1991. The net-\nwork is based on a data set accumulated over 20 years, from\nimplementation of 108 kidnappings in Malaysia and the Philip-\npines. In particular, victims were essentially Filipino\nbusinessmen, news reporters and Christian clergy members.\nThe data set, reconstructed using four open sources by Ger-\ndes et al. (2014), is a result of a collection process regarding\nindividuals involved in kidnappings, the date of the kidnap-\nping event, as well as the place and the context in which those\nhappened.\n`Ndrangheta network.This network refers to the Calabrian\nMafia clan, the `Ndrangheta, which is based in the Reggio\nCalabria region, in Southern Italy. However, police investi-\ngations reported the evidence of the expansion of the\n`Ndrangheta organisation even in the north of Italy and, in\nparticular, in the Lombardy region. The present network is\ncomposed of 149 `Ndrangheta members participating in 47\nLombardy region. Those meetings were mostly organised in\npublic places such as pubs and restaurants. Also, they had the\naim of solving internal problems, making important deci-\nsions and identifying new affiliations (Calderoni, 2014). We\nreconstructed the data set by utilising a judicial document\nconcerning the pretrial detention order produced by the pre-\nliminary investigation judge of Milan. This act allows the\nimplementation of measures of custody and arrest warrants\nfor some people, identified such as `Ndrangheta's members.\nTheir identification is a result of a police investigation, called\n`Operazione Infinito' (Infinite Operation), through which\ninvestigators collected information about the evolution of the\n`Ndrangheta structure organisation by wiretappings and\nobservations of the common participation in summits and\nsecret meetings. Although these meetings had meaningful\ndurations, most meetings would last less than 24 hours,\nwherefore we deem the sequential nature more important\nthan duration dynamics (Table 1).\nRevealing the individual engagement in covert\nactivities over time\nIn this section, we begin by representing the two-mode net-\nwork graphical representation for all three data sets. Two-\nmode networks are showed in Figures 3(a), 4(a) and 5(a).\nBlue squares correspond to events, whereas nodes with a\nround shape in red refer to individuals.

One-mode networks corre-\nspond to Figures 3(b), 4(b) and 5(b). Here, the colour of\nnodes reflects the individual's centrality: Darkest nodes are\nthe most central. The centrality is based on the basic measure\nof the degree of a node that is equivalent to the number of\ndirect connections a node has (Borgatti et al., 2013). In this\ncase, an individual with a high degree corresponds to an indi-\nvidual who has been engaged in covert activities with many\nother participants. Finally, for each of the three data sets, we\nreport the bi-dynamic line-graph representation. Bi-dynamic\nline-graphs are showed in Figures 3(c), 4(c) and 5(c). In\nthese representations, the colour of the nodes matches with\nthe respective one in the one-mode representations. On the\ncontrary, the number in the labels reflects the number of the\nevents considered. The events are displayed from left to\nright, in a horizontal progression.\nUK Suffragette co-participation in meetings and actions in Bristol\nand Bath. Figure 3(a) shows the two-mode visualisation for the\nSuffragettes participating in meetings and public protests in\nBristol and Bath, in the United Kingdom. Here, we notice that\nonly a handful of central individuals took part in many of these\nevents, whereas the large part of Suffragettes joined in only a\nfew protests, and sometimes even on their own, as the three\nnodes located on the lower left side of the graph reveal. The\ninsight gained from Figure 3(b) is two-fold. First, the promi-\nnence of two individuals, N1 and N30, in dark blue, is visible\ndue to the fact they attended numerous events. As a conse-\nquence, in the one-mode projection, they result to be directly\nconnected to many other individuals. Second, it is possible to\nidentify the presence of a few clusters of individuals densely\nconnected to each other. This means that the Suffragettes did\nnot regularly attend all events, and the participation was spo-\nradic. This latter characteristic of the graph seems to suggest\nthat Suffragettes were organised in subgroups whose members\nused to attend meetings and perform violent attacks together.\nHowever, the one-mode projection does not show the extent to\nwhich the dynamics of the individual's participation over time\nevolve. A better insight of those dynamics is captured by the\nbi-dynamic line-graph, Figure 3(c).\nIn here, it can be seen that the general pattern of participa-\ntion over time is delineated by a pair of individuals who were\npresent in many of the events reported. The flow of the\nSuffragettes' participation can be distinguished in several\nperiods. During the first period, corresponding to the first 15\nevents, the direction of individual's participation presents a\ncertain linear polarisation around few key individuals.\nAfterwards, during the second period, characterising the fol-\nlowing 17 events, the participation evolves by presenting\nthree subgroups who led the mobilisation. Only few of these\nindividuals involved are still active members of the third\nperiod, represented by the last eight events, whereas most of\nthem abandoned the campaign. At this point, the dynamic\nline-graph shows a certain reorganisation in the Suffragettes'\nmobilisation since only nine individuals appear to maintain a\ncommitment to the campaign. In addition, it seems that the\nSuffragettes run the mobilisation by acting generally in two\nseparate subgroups. Almost at the end of the time window,\nafter the 30th event, only the individuals corresponding to\none of these subgroups continued its militancy in the\nSuffragettes campaign. Interestingly, the number of mem-\nbers who remained involved at that time is critically lower\nthan the beginning.\nThe major relevance of only few central people and the\npresence of a quite stable tendency of the Suffragette's\nengagement in events can be the consequence of either the\npresence of a specific role's distinction of individuals in the\ncampaign and the general leadership's influence. It is known,\nin fact, that Annie Kenney, who was employed as secretary\nby the WSPU, assumed an important role for supporting the\nexpansion of the Suffragette movement in the West of\nEngland, and in particular in Bristol and Bath. Ms. Kenney\nwas sustained and helped by Mary Blathwayt, albeit Ms.\nBlathwayt refused to be highly involved in risky activity. The\nprominence of Kenney and Blathwayt during the time is then\nexplained by the role they assumed in the Suffragette's cam-\npaign. Their presence in many of the these events is also jus-\ntified by the nature of events considered, which reflects\nviolent public demonstrations as well as private meetings\nwhich were sometimes located at Blathwayt's house. The\nleadership's influence, instead, may explain the decrease of\npeople's engagement in the campaign. Emmeline and\nChristabel Pankhurst, in fact, leaders of the WSPU, influ-\nenced the Suffragette's commitment in protests by restricting\ntheir participation in actions. The decision of taking part in\nviolent attacks was most of the time a result of an internal\ndecision related to the strategy adopted by the Suffragette's\nleadership rather than a personal decision. This aspect is par-\nticularly relevant since it goes against what ought to be the\nintention of a social movement which is to engage the critical\nmass and recruit people in support to their campaign. In our\nopinion, the dynamic line-graph brings to light the relevance\nof the leadership's influence much better than the other tradi-\ntional social network representations since it reflects the\nextent of the evolution of people's participation influenced\nby the leadership of the Suffragette movement who used to\ndecide who was in and who was out during the campaign.\nPhilippines terrorist network.Figure 4(a) represents the two-\nmode network of the Philippines terrorist network. In here,\nthe high density of individuals around some events (squares)\nreveals that terrorists mostly act in partnerships. The two-\nmode network representation also depicts separate compo-\nnents which suggest the presence of autonomous groups of\nterrorists. The one-mode projection of this two-mode network\nis reported in Figure 4(b). This representation, which captures\nthe presence of disconnected components, seems also to high-\nlight the prominent position assumed by some individuals,\nN41 and N103, belonging to the main component. Those\nBroccatelli et al. 11\nindividuals have a relevant role in keeping the network con-\nnected. However, neither of these representations are capable\nof capturing the evolution of people's action history.\nThe bi-dynamic line-graph, depicted in Figure 4(c), better\nreveals the story of the terrorists' tactics. Overall, terrorist\nactions seemed to be accomplished by different terrorist\ngroups over time. This representation also suggests that the\nindividual's commitment to terrorist attacks is subject to\nchanges through time since the number of terrorists involved\neach time rapidly increases and/or decreases. Terrorists have\nbeen involved in the events progressively and have followed\ndifferent directions of actions. In other words, they mainly\ntended to act separately. The general pattern of terrorists'\nparticipation in terrorist attacks can be characterised by four\nperiods. During the first period, referring to the first 21\nevents, the presence of only one main trajectory of collective\naction, with two small opposite branches can be noticed.\nOnly six of the terrorists involved in this period led the ter-\nrorist propaganda during the second period. In this second\ngroup of events, composed of the following 15 events, there\nseemed to be a surge in terrorist activism. During this second\nperiod, terrorists tended to act separately, mainly divided in\nthree groups until the last event of this period, number 36,\nwhich represents the highest one in terms of the number of\npeople involved. Interestingly, many of the terrorists who\nsupported the propaganda until now finished their active\ncommitment during the third period. This third subgroup of\nevents, from event 37 until event 67, is generally character-\nised by a low level of individuals' engagement in action. In\naddition, it can be noted that the flow of action mainly fol-\nlows two trajectories of participation. Afterwards, during the\nfourth period, corresponding to the remaining attacks, the\nindividual's commitment to terrorist attacks presents a fur-\nther decrease with, again, a certain tendency of acting sepa-\nrately in three groups. In general, the bi-dynamic line-graph\ndepicts a high turnover of terrorists' engagement in actions\nthat contributes in keeping the flow of participation fluctuat-\ning and discontinuous. In addition, this flow is characterised\nby the presence of key individuals who maintain certain\ndynamics of continuity of collaboration among those differ-\nent periods.\nThe presence of those separated groups of terrorists per-\nforming kidnappings can be explained by the characteristics\nof the data set. Due to the difficulty in defining boundaries\namong terrorist groups' members, it is possible that the iden-\ntified terrorists were members of different terrorist groups.\nAs Gerdes et al. (2014) pointed out, in fact, the ASG used to\nhave close relationships with other terrorist groups such as\nthe Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), the Southeast Asian terror group\nresponsible for the Bali bombing in 2002, and the Pentagon\nGang (PG), another radical organisation which used to per-\nform kidnappings. Therefore, the network can be composed\nby individuals who moved fluidly among several terrorist\norganisations. However, the presence of a certain level of\nflexibility in the participation dynamics characterising this\nnetwork might be explained by the criminal organisations'\nnecessity to adapt to new situations and to quickly re-config-\nure themselves in response to police authorities dismantling\nnecessity can be on the basis of the evolving strategy of per-\nforming kidnappings and of the way in which individuals\nhave been involved in these terrorist actions.\n`Ndrangheta network.Figure 5(a) and 5(b) show, respec-\ntively, the original `Ndrangheta Mafia network and its\none-mode representation. In this case, the difficulty in under-\nstanding the properties of the pattern of interaction only by\nlooking at these graphs is evident since these visualisations\ndo not suggest any particular pattern of interactions although\nthese could be better revealed by applying some SNA meas-\nures such as centrality. On the contrary, the bi-dynamic line-\ngraph, Figure 5(c), seems to give a better insight into the\ninternal dynamics of the Mafia organisation.\nIn general, in the flow of participation in Mafia summits,\nwe can distinguish two periods. During the first period,\ncorresponding to the first 28 meetings, it is noticeable that\nMafia members joined the organisation consistently and\nmainly led to the presence of two distinguished subgroups\nwith two different trajectories of participation. In addition,\none of these two subgroups seemed to be characterised by a\nfurther division in two separate branches. Afterwards, during\nthe second period concerning all the succeeding events, the\npresence of four different directions of action may be seen.\nNotwithstanding that, a certain tendency of clustering seems\nto appear during the last event since Mafia members belong-\ning to these different subgroups took part in the meeting\ntogether.\nThe added understanding of the pattern of interactions\nthat the bi-dynamic line-graph provides may be further\nemphasised using the background information provided by\nthe police investigation. As far as it has been reported in\nthe document from where data have been extracted, the\n`Ndrangheta Mafia organisation presented a hierarchical\nstructure with small satellite groups, called locali. Each\nlocale, similarly hierarchically structured, had the aim to\nmanage its specific territorial area. Bosses and individuals\nwith certain roles from a locale were expected, in most\ncases, to take part in meetings and summits organised from\nanother locale in order to honour the commitments\nassumed. We surmise that the distinction between mem-\nbers mainly involved at local level and others related,\ninstead, at the general level of the whole Lombardy terri-\ntory can explain the people's tendency of organising sepa-\nrated meetings. Moreover, the original police report offers\nsome information about the nature and the content of the\nmeetings. Therefore, this information helps in the compre-\nhension of the relevance of the two events, one in the mid-\ndle of the time window and one at the end. The first general\nsummit, meeting number 28, organised on the 20th of\nJanuary 2009 in a restaurant located in Cardano al Campo,\n12 Methodological Innovations\nin the province of Varese, in Lombardy, had been organ-\nised in order to discuss a new ordering of the leadership\nstructure due to the murder of the former Mafia's Lombardy\nboss. The second relevant meeting, number 47 at the end of\nthe time window, had been organised on the 31st of October\n2009 at the residential care `Falcone e Borsellino' in\nPaderno Dugnano, in the province of Milan. Here, the most\ninfluent Mafia members proceeded with the election of the\nnew `Ndrangheta boss in Lombardy and discussed the\nfuture guidelines of the `Ndrangheta organisation in north-\nern Italy. The content of these two events can explain the\npresence of changes in the evolving pattern of interactions\ndepicted by the bi-dynamic line-graph. Therefore, we pre-\nsume that the pattern of participation's flow reflects the\nnecessity of the Mafia leadership structure reorganisation\nand the way in which Mafia members reinforced their\nmembership and reciprocal trust.\nConclusion\nWe extended the use of the line-graph to bipartite networks\nin order to analyse temporal dynamics. Our work was based\non the use of a line-graph projection for bipartite network\nwith the application of a reduction criterion of redundant\nties. Our method not only provided a better visualisation of\ntemporal dynamics, but it also captured the temporal proxim-\nity between individuals, that is, the presence of overlapping\nrelationships and the individuals'trajectories of participation\nin events.\nWe sought to explore the power of this visualisation by\napplying it to three longitudinal covert networks. For each\nnetwork, we compared the bi-dynamic line-graph with two\ntraditional social network visualisations: the two-mode net-\nwork format and the one-mode network resulting from the\nconversion of the two-mode. By referring to previous publi-\nwhich the Mafia's data set has been reconstructed (Infinite\nOperation), we provided some narrative explanations about\nthe tendencies of people's trajectories of actions brought to\nthe light by the bi-dynamic line-graph.\nThese representations seemed to offer a better image of\nthe rate of individuals' turnover participating in covert\nactions over time without arbitrarily distinguishing the whole\ntime window in temporally adjacent intervals. The diversity\nand/or similarity of people's trajectories of actions over time\nhave been revealed through this representation and research-\ners could have a better insight concerning the pattern of these\ninteractions over time. Furthermore, beside the information\nabout individual's centrality within people's trajectories of\nactions, the bi-dynamic line-graph also helped in understand-\ning which events had been more relevant since they indicated\nthe exact moment in which individuals started to act differ-\nently resulting in a noticeable change in the patterning of\nsocial interactions.\nThinking in terms of the relevance of events opens up the\nimportant question of the duality of events (Breiger, 1974).\nThis idea of duality emphasises the intrinsic dualism present\nbetween individuals and events. If, on the one hand, indi-\nviduals become linked to each other due to their common\ninvolvement in the same social event, on the other hand, a\nsimilar link exists among events when characterised by com-\nmon people's participation. In this second case, the linkage\namong events can rely upon the specific meaning of the\nevents (Diani, 2015). Individuals co-participating in events,\nin fact, not only share person-to-person interactions but they\nalso assign a specific meaning to the events in which they\ntook place. By looking at the structure of the bi-dynamic\nline-graph, events acquire a central importance when they\nhappen at and define a crucial point in time, that is, a water-\nshed. Leading up to and after this watershed, individuals\nbecame involved in the actions differently during the time\nand changes in the organisational network dynamics can be\nregistered. The bi-dynamic line-graph seems to capture the\naspect of the duality of events since it reveals not only who\nare the prominent individuals whose trajectories of action\nincrease network connectivity but also at which point in time\nthis network connectivity rises and respectively to which\nevent. Therefore, the events can be seen such as a chain of\nconnected activities over time linked together by people\nattending those activities. The link between individual histo-\nries of participation in action and the community network\nstructure as it is provided by the bi-dynamic line-graph can\nbe the basis of a further development of a relational model\nfor collective action for investigating how individuals\nbecame involved in different types of events over time and to\nwhat extent.\nBeside the advantages, as has been pointed out above in\nthe section related to the description of the proposed model,\nthe bi-dynamic line-graph presented some limitations. First,\nthe different space in time existing between occurred events\nhas not been considered in this representation. A next step\nwould be the development of a specific visualisation tool in\norder to improve the visualisation of temporal dynamics, in\nparticular by removing overlapping people's trajectories and\ntaking into account the temporal distance between each event\nby considering the exact point in time in which these events\noccurred. Second, the set of standard SNA measures cur-\nrently in existence were not applicable. Due to the fact that\nthe bi-dynamic line matrices contain two sets of ties, directed\nand reciprocal, the SNA measures need to be specifically\nadjusted before being applied for analysing some formal\nproperties of these graphs. Thus, we plan to extend the use of\nthe bi-dynamic line-graphs by providing analytical solutions\nfor quantifying the centrality of individuals in virtue of their\nposition in the channels of latent knowledge and expertise.\nThis different measure of centrality will quantify the level of\nexpertise individuals accumulated by participating in activi-\nties over time and the amount of shared knowledge individu-\nals achieved by working and acting cooperatively and\nBroccatelli et al. 13\nconsistently with others. In such a context, we hope to gener-\nate new insights into the understanding of who the key actors\nare, who contributed the most to the spread of knowledge\nand expertise in the given covert networks.\n"
