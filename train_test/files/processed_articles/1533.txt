A detailed description of the Na-\ntional Social Life, Health and Aging Project study\npopulation and study design has been published\nAll women selected for participation in the Na-\ntional Social Life, Health and Aging Project were\nmit a self-administered vaginal swab specimen (Fig. 1).\nOf these, nine respondents tried but were unable to\ncollect the vaginal swab, equipment problems oc-\ncurred in the collection of six swabs, two specimens\nwere lost in transit, and one specimen was missing in\nspecimens were adequate for analysis.\nNonresponders to the vaginal swab protocol were\nsignificantly more likely than responders to be older\n(older than 75 years), have less than a high school\neducation (Table 1), and were less likely to report a\nrecent pelvic examination, menopausal prescription\nhormone use, or frequent sexual activity in the previ-\nous year. A physical or health problem was the most\ncommon recorded reason for not submitting a vaginal\nspecimen. The protocol was approved by the University\nof Chicago and the NORC Institutional Review Boards;\nall respondents gave written informed consent.\nRace and ethnicity were self-reported. Sex was\ndefined as \"any mutually voluntary activity with\nanother person that involves sexual contact, whether\nor not intercourse or orgasm occurs.\" For those\nreporting a current (prior 12 months) sexual partner,\nsexual frequency, condom use, and partner's sex were\ncollected for up to the two most recent partners.\nPartner infidelity (known or perceived) was collected\nfor up to the two most recent partners for a randomly\nselected two thirds of survey respondents. Questions\nabout sexual activity were refused by 2\u00ad7% of respon-\ndents. Data regarding the most recent sexual partner\nare used in the analyses reported here.\nSmoking was assessed using questions adapted\nfrom a major epidemiologic study of aging.19 Physical\nhealth was self-rated using the standard 5-point scale,\nand comorbidities were assessed using a modified\nCharlson Index.20 Current medications were logged\nand classified according to the Multum Drug Data-\nbase: Lexicon Plus version (Cerner Multum, Denver,\nCO).21 Other health and health-behavior variables\nwere obtained by self-report.\nWomen were given an illustrated instruction\ncard with collection materials22 and directed to a\nbathroom or other private room.

For each\nspecimen to be considered valid, both the high- and\nlow-level -globin controls had to yield a visible band\non the blot. For each run to be considered valid, both\npositive and negative controls had to perform as ex-\npected. The ambiguous XR/52 probe data were han-\ndled as follows: HPV type 52 was considered positive\nvisible. Although coinfection with HPV type 52 cannot\nbe ruled out in cases where both the HPV GT52/33/\nGT35, and/or GT58 bands were visible, we interpreted\nthose specimens as negative for HPV type 52. To ensure\nreproducibility, 22 of the 56 specimens were randomly\nselected and retested. Without exception, the number of\nbands and their relative staining intensities were similar\nbetween runs.\nThe analytic sample consisted of 1,010 respond-\ners who provided an adequate vaginal self-swab spec-\nimen. High-risk HPV prevalence (at least one high-\nrisk genotype present by Hybrid Capture 2) was\nestimated with 95% confidence interval (CI) obtained\nusing a logit transform to ensure that the confidence\nlimit would fall between 0 and 1. Logistic regression\nwas used to model associations between high-risk\nHPV and individual factors. All analyses accounted\nfor the survey sampling design through incorporation\nof sampling strata and clusters as well as weights that\nadjusted for differential probability of selection and\ndifferential nonresponse.

Mul-\ntivariable analysis was conducted for the entire sample\nand for women not currently married; multivariable\nanalysis among married women was precluded by the\nsmall number of high-risk HPV cases (n19).\nRESULTS\nThe mean age of respondents was 68 years, mean age\nat menopause was 46 years, mean duration since\nmenopause was 22 years, mean lifetime number of\nsex partners was 4.5 (median 2.0), and mean number\nof pregnancies was 2.8. The population prevalence of\nwomen aged 57\u00ad85 with prevalent high-risk HPV\nHigh-risk HPV prevalence was estimated accord-\ning to sociodemographic characteristics (Table 2).\nPrevalence of high-risk HPV infection did not differ\nsignificantly by age group, race/ethnicity, education,\nor insurance status. Current marital status was a\nstrong, significant predictor of high-risk HPV infec-\ntion. Prevalence was lowest among those currently\nmarried and was highest among those who were\ndivorced.\nThe frequencies of HPV genotypes were deter-\nmined for 56 of the 64 high-risk Hybrid Capture\n2-positive specimens (Fig. 1). Figure 2 illustrates their\ndistribution (2A) and copresence (2B). One or more of\nthe four genotypes included in the quadrivalent HPV\nwomen with high-risk HPV, although zero cases of\nHPV-11 were found. Nearly two thirds (63%) of\nwomen with high-risk HPV had multiple types de-\ntected. Among 49 specimens with any high-risk HPV\ngenotype detected, 37 contained two or more geno-\ntypes. The most common high-risk genotypes found\namong high-risk HPV\u00adpositive women were HPV-61\nspecimens tested positive for both high-risk HPV-16\nhigh-risk HPV\u00adpositive women. These genotype\nprevalences may be underestimates of the preva-\nlences in the entire population because genotyping\nwas limited to women who first tested positive for\nhigh-risk HPV by Hybrid Capture 2.\nBehavioral and health factors significantly associ-\nated with higher high-risk HPV prevalence in bivari-\nate analyses included current smoking, cancer, and\nhysterectomy. Although data on prior chemotherapy\nuse were unavailable, 47 women (4.6% of high-risk\nHPV\u00adnegative and 12.6% of high-risk HPV\u00adpositive)\nwere currently using an antineoplastic agent.

Among married women, high-risk HPV\nprevalence did not differ significantly between no sex\nand infrequent sex in the prior 12 months, whereas\nmore frequent sex (more than once a month) was\nsignificantly associated with a decreased prevalence\nP.002). Spousal infidelity was reported by 5.9% of\nmarried women and was significantly associated with\nP.01). Too few cases of HPV (n12) occurred\namong unmarried women who reported sex within\nthe previous year to further evaluate the effect of\nfrequency of sex in this subgroup.

Additional health-related correlates of\nhigh-risk HPV positivity, not appreciated in younger\npopulations, are identified. Among older women with\ngenital high-risk HPV, the vast majority exhibit mul-\ntiple genotype infection.\nEstimated high-risk HPV prevalence for women\naged 57\u00ad85 is nearly identical to that reported by the\nU.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey for women aged 50\u00ad59, using comparable meth-\nods.18 In a validation study including older women,\ntween physician and self-swab specimens for detect-\ning HPV.28 The frequency of oncogenic HPV types\n16 and 18 translates roughly to minimum population\nprevalences of 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively; no indi-\nvidual tested positive for both HPV types 16 and 18.\nThese findings are very similar to the U.S. National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey prevalence\nestimates for these genotypes among females age\nOther U.S.-based studies of HPV that include\nolder women are limited by relatively small, clinical\nconvenience samples and aggregation of women age\n60 and older.

The implications of long-term carriage\nof genital tract HPV well beyond menopause are not\nwell understood; further work is needed to appreciate\nthe implications in older women for vulvovaginal\ndiseases, transmission to partners, Pap test abnormal-\nities, treatment decisions about gynecologic comor-\nbidities, and psychological well-being.\nThe prevalence of high-risk HPV is higher in\nhysterectomized compared with nonhysterectomized\nwomen, despite similar sexual behavior. Understand-\ning the role of hysterectomy in the natural history of\nhigh-risk HPV is complex, limited in this study by\nself-report, and should incorporate factors such as\ntiming and type of hysterectomy, oophorectomy,\nindication for hysterectomy, and adjunctive treat-\nment. In two studies, Castle et al documented high-\nrisk HPV in younger women who had undergone\nhysterectomy but found no difference in HPV prev-\nalence by hysterectomy status.29,36 One study suggests\nthat persistent genital tract HPV infection in older\nwomen may be a marker of immune compromise.35\nThis may partially explain the relationship we find\nbetween hysterectomy and high-risk HPV. We found\nthat a history of any cancer, a higher number of\ncancers, and any current antineoplastic agent use\nwere associated with a higher prevalence of high-risk\nHPV and that women with hysterectomy were less\nhealthy than women who did not have hysterectomy.\nThere were limitations to our study. Cervical\ndysplasia and sexually transmitted infection history\nare likely underreported,37 thereby attenuating ex-\npected associations with HPV. Sexuality data also\nwere self-reported; prior work with this data set\ndemonstrates high internal and external validity and\nlow item nonresponse using valid interview meth-\nods.13,38 Differences between vaginal swab nonre-\nsponders and responders could bias prevalence esti-\nmates; however, in the extreme case where all\nnonresponders are assumed to be high-risk HPV\nnegative, overall prevalence is still 4.0% (2.9% in the\nwomen aged 75\u00ad85) and the same correlates are\nidentified. In some subgroups, the very small number\nof participants with high-risk HPV results in wide CIs,\nwhich have been reported for completeness but\nshould be regarded with caution. Use of the self-\ncollected specimens may lead to detection of different\nHPV types than those collected by direct endocervi-\ncal sampling and may favor detection of low-risk\ntypes with predilection for the vagina.18,28 The degree\nof vaginal atrophy also may influence HPV detec-\ntion,25 as suggested in our study by a higher rate of\ndetection in women with a longer duration since last\nmenses. Also, collecting a vaginal specimen from a\nsingle time point does not distinguish between new,\npersistent, or reactivated latent infection. Further-\nmore, because the Hybrid Capture 2 assay does not\ncontrol for cellular adequacy, a small but unknown\nproportion may have been falsely negative.\nHigh-risk HPV prevalence was stable across\nolder age groups and nearly equivalent to that esti-\nmated by the U.S. National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey for women in the sixth decade.\nAmong older women with high-risk HPV positivity,\nthe proportion of HPV types targeted by the HPV\nunderestimate of the prevalence of vaccine types\namong all older women, this is in contrast to the\nestimated 3.4% prevalence among the general popu-\nphysicians and the public new information pertinent\nto HPV counseling, screening decisions, and health-\nrelated quality of life.39\nREFERENCES\n1.
