Previous studies have linked higher religious attendance and longer survival. In this study, we examine\nthe relationship between survival and private religious activity.\nMethods. A probability sample of elderly community-dwelling adults in North Carolina was assembled in 1986 and\nfollowed for 6 years. Level of participation in private religious activities such as prayer, meditation, or Bible study was\nassessed by self-report at baseline, along with a wide variety of sociodemographic and health variables. The main out-\ncome was time (days) to death or censoring.\nResults. During a median 6.3-year follow-up period, 1,137 subjects (29.5%) died. Those reporting rarely to never\nparticipating in private religious activity had an increased relative hazard of dying over more frequent participants, but\nthis hazard did not remain significant for the sample as a whole after adjustment for demographic and health variables.\nWhen the sample was divided into activity of daily living (ADL) impaired and unimpaired, the effect did not remain sig-\nnificant for the ADL impaired group after controlling for demographic variables (hazard ratio [RH] 1.11, 95% confi-\ndence interval [CI] 0.91\u00ad1.35). However, the increased hazard remained significant for the ADL unimpaired group even\nafter controlling for demographic and health variables (RH 1.63, 95% CI 1.20\u00ad2.21), and this effect persisted despite\ncontrolling for numerous explanatory variables including health practices, social support, and other religious practices\nConclusions. Older adults who participate in private religious activity before the onset of ADL impairment appear to\nhave a survival advantage over those who do not.\nHE impact of religion on health is a topic of increasing\ninterest to epidemiologists, sociologists, and clinicians.\nMany recent studies have found health differences between\nreligious and nonreligious groups, yet many questions re-\nmain unanswered. New studies are needed to illuminate\nwhich specific areas of religious participation are beneficial\nto which health outcomes (1).\nInvestigations to date have predominantly explored the\neffect of organizational religious behaviors, such as church\nattendance, on health. Although some research has been\ncriticized for poor design, a growing body of soundly con-\nducted investigation is showing a positive health effect for\nreligious participants (2,3). Six recent studies have demon-\nstrated a reduction in mortality for frequent church attenders,\neven after controlling for demographic, health, social, and\npsychological factors known to impact mortality (4\u00ad9).\nStudies of private religious activities have shown a psy-\nchological benefit for participants. In a randomized, con-\ntrolled, double-blind study, O'Laiore found persons who\npray to have improvement over nonpraying counterparts in\n10 of 11 measures of self-esteem, anxiety, and depression\n(10). Other studies have shown a correlation between sense\nof well-being and private religiousness (11\u00ad13).\nFew prospective studies have been published to date that\nanalyze the relationship between physical health and private\nreligiousness. Various cross-sectional studies have shown\nthat those who are sicker or more disabled pray more\n(14,15). This finding agrees with Krause and Van Tran's\nsuppressor model of religiousness, which theorizes that religion\nis used as a coping device in times of crisis (16), but it fails\nto demonstrate possible health benefits. Gupta identified\nprayer as protective against coronary heart disease in a rural\npopulation in Rajasthan, India (17), but did not find prayer to\nbe significantly protective in an urban population (18). Do\nprivate religious activities such as prayer or study of scrip-\nture have a beneficial health effect in a Western population?\nWe hypothesized that elderly persons who participated in\nprivate religious activity would survive longer than those\nwho did not and that this benefit would be stronger in those\nwho reported private religious activity in the absence of any\nimpairment in activities of daily living (ADLs). Impairment\nin ADLs has been shown to correlate with both increased\nprivate religious activity and increased mortality (15,19).\nAnalysis of the ADL impaired and the ADL unimpaired\nseparately may show greater benefit for the ADL unim-\npaired, because their religious activity may reflect habit and\nnot simply prayer under duress.\nMETHODS\nDesign and Sample\nThis study used a prospective cohort design. Data came\nfrom the Duke University Established Populations for Epi-\ndemiologic Studies of the Elderly (Duke/EPESE), a popula-\ntion survey that was part of a multicenter, collaborative in-\nvestigation of persons aged 65 and older. The North\nT\nlation-based, stratified random sample, with African Ameri-\ncan and rural older adult subjects oversampled. At baseline,\n5,223 residents of five contiguous counties (Durham, Gran-\nville, Vance, Warren, and Franklin) in the Piedmont area of\nNorth Carolina were selected. Details of the sampling\nmethod are presented elsewhere (20). Of those initially se-\nlected, 4,162 completed the baseline survey, yielding an\n80% response rate. Of these, 26 were neither Caucasian nor\nAfrican American and were deleted from the analysis. An\nadditional 160 proxy interviews were deleted, because no\nself-reported data were available for these interviews. Of\nthe remaining 3,976, data on private religious activities\nwere available for 3,851 sample members.\nAnalysis of the 125 nonresponders to the private religious\nactivity question versus the 3,851 responders revealed no\nsignificant differences in age, gender, rural or urban loca-\ntion, or years of school between the groups. However, a\nhigher percentage of African Americans than white sample\nmembers answered the religion items.\nThe religious composition of the sample is overwhelm-\nidentified themselves as Catholic, Jewish, or Eastern Ortho-\ndox; 1.4% reported that they were either atheist or had no\nreligious association; 0.2% of sample members had missing\ndata for this question.\nAssessment\nPrivate religious activities were assessed by the question\n\"How often do you spend time in private religious activities,\nsuch as prayer, meditation, or Bible study?\" Responses\navailable were (1) rarely or never, (2) a few times a month,\n(3) once a week, (4) two or more times a week, or (5) daily\n(or more often). Responses were dichotomized into rarely or\nnever (1) versus all other groups (2\u00ad5). There were 678 sample\nsample members (82.4%) in the other groups combined.\nVital status was assessed through annual follow-up inter-\nviews either by telephone or in person, with dates of death\nconfirmed by abstracting death certificates (n  1,137).\nSurveillance continued until 1992, with length of time in\ndays from the initial interview until death recorded as the\ntime until death. Those alive at the final interview in 1992\nwere censored at 183 days (6 months) beyond the last inter-\nview date. Those lost to follow-up, 7.3%, were censored at\n183 days beyond the last contact.\nCovariates were chosen because of demonstrated associa-\ntions with mortality (4,20\u00ad28). All were measured at base-\ndemographics, physical and mental health, social connec-\ntions, and health practices (see Table 1).\nIn addition to private religious activity, both church atten-\ndance and religious media use were analyzed. Church atten-\ndance and religious media use were divided into once a\nweek or more versus less than once a week.\nDemographic variables included age, defined as 65\u00ad74\nversus 75 or older, gender, ethnicity, and education. Educa-\ntion was divided between 0 to 10 years of school and 11 or\nmore years of school, because high school in North Carolina\nformerly ended after the eleventh grade.\nPhysical health variables included chronic conditions and\nimpaired daily activities (inability to perform one or more\nADLs [29] vs no inability in ADLs) as well as self-rated\nhealth. Lifetime history of chronic conditions were dichoto-\nmized as none versus one or more of the following (by self-\nreport): cancer, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, hip fractures,\nfracture of other bones; or current angina pectoris, bronchi-\ntis, cardiac glycoside use, antihypertensive use, or cognitive\nimpairment on the Short Portable Mental Status Question-\nnaire (30). Additionally, two blood pressure (BP) measure-\nments were taken; if systolic BP averaged 140 mm Hg or\ndiastolic BP averaged 90 mm Hg, a diagnosis of hyperten-\nsion was included in the chronic diseases variable. Self-\nrated health was measured as the answer to the question\n\"Overall, how would you rate your health--as excellent,\ngood, fair, or poor?\" with responses dichotomized between\ngood or excellent versus fair or poor. Mental health mea-\nsures included depression, as measured by a CES-D depres-\nsion score of 9 or more (31), and self-reported negative life\nevents in the year prior to baseline. Negative life events in-\ncluded illnesses or deaths of family or friends, divorce, resi-\ndential moves, legal or financial problems, and retirement.\nSocial connections variables included marital status and\nsix measures of social support: immediate social network,\npersonal contacts in the last month, satisfaction with a sup-\nportive confidant, satisfaction with social interaction, and\nsupport given and received from family and friends.\nHealth practices included smoking, defined as yes or no\nas a current smoker at the baseline interview; drinking alco-\nhol, dichotomized into 20 or more drinks in the previous\nmonth versus less than 20; and body mass index. Body mass\nTable 1. Multivariate Sequential Models Using Baseline Covariates to Compare Mortality Rates for Very Infrequent Versus All Other\nGroups in Private Religious Participation During 6 Years of Follow-up\nModel and Covariates\nADL Impaired\nADL Unimpaired\nModel I: Report rarely or never participating\nindex was divided into bottom quintile, middle three quin-\ntiles, and top quintile, with the middle group used as the ref-\nerence group.\nCovariates with missing data at baseline were imputed to\ntheir mean if fewer than 2% were missing. If between 2%\nand 5% were missing, stochastic regression imputation tech-\nniques were used. No variable was missing more than 5%.\nAnalysis\nAll analyses were conducted using SAS (32) or SUDAAN\n(33) statistical analysis software. Baseline associations be-\ntween private religious activity and all covariates were ana-\nlyzed using the chi-square statistic. The relationship between\nprivate religious activity and each of the covariates was as-\nsessed. The unadjusted association between higher levels of\nprivate religious activity and survival was examined first,\nfollowed by the sequential addition of five groups of covari-\nates, using a Cox proportional hazards regression model with\n95% confidence intervals (34). First demographic variables\nwere added, followed by the addition of physical and mental\nhealth variables. Social connections were added third, fol-\nlowed by health practices, and fifth and finally by the addi-\ntion of the two religion variables. This model was first ap-\nplied to the group as a whole and then to the ADL impaired\nand ADL unimpaired groups separately.\nWe tested for both a dose\u00adresponse and a threshold effect\nfor devotional activity as follows. Four dummy variables\nwere constructed to represent increasingly frequent devo-\ntional activity. Two Cox proportional hazard models were\nanalyzed, the first including the full complement of control\nvariables but without the four dummy variables, and the\nsecond also fully adjusted but with the addition of the four\ndummy variables. The difference between the omnibus\n(Satterthwaite adjusted) chi-square statistics was 4.04 (4 df)\n2  9.48), which indicates no evidence of a\nsignificant trend across increasing levels of devotional activity.\nSubsequently, a third Cox proportional hazard model was\nanalyzed, including all control variables in addition to the\ndichotomized variable for rarely/never versus any devo-\ntional activity. The difference between the omnibus chi-\nsquare statistic for the model with the single dichotomous\nvariable and the same statistic for the model with four\nThis indicates no evidence of significant additional effect\nabove the threshold level of several times a month. Finally,\ncreated by adding the single dichotomous variable to the\nmodel that included only control variables provides evi-\ndence of a significant effect for any devotional activity (cut-\nthe hazard ratios for the independent variable, dichotomized\nas any versus no devotional activity.\nRESULTS\nFirst, the relationship between private religious activity\nand covariates at baseline was analyzed. Odds of low pri-\nvate religiousness were associated with a likelihood of both\nlow church attendance and low religious media use. There\nwas also a strong association between gender and private re-\nligious activity, with males nearly three times more likely\nthan females to be low private religious participants. Addi-\ntional demographic features of those likely to be infrequent\nparticipants were younger age, urban location, and white\nrace; education level was not significantly different between\nthe two groups. In physical and mental health measures,\nonly those reporting negative life events occurring in the\nyear prior to survey were less likely to be rare to never par-\nticipants in prayer, meditation, or Bible studies. Odds of im-\npaired function, history of chronic health conditions, and\ndepression were not significantly different between higher\nand lower frequency participants. Interestingly, those who\nwere married were much more likely to be in the rarely to\nnever category. Other than marital status, those with a\nhigher score on social contact measures were more often in\nthe higher frequency category. As expected, alcohol and\nsmoking were much higher in the rarely to never group. Al-\nthough no significant correlation was found with the lowest\nquintile in body mass index, the highest quintile showed a\nhigher frequency of participation. Overall, correlations were in\nthe expected direction and consistent with previous research.\nThose who reported rare participation in private religious\nactivities were more likely to die during the follow-up pe-\nriod than those who did not, but this association disappeared\nfor the group as a whole once known risks for mortality\nfied models, similar results were obtained for the ADL im-\npaired group (n  2,058; Table 1). However, a significant\nsurvival advantage was seen for those reporting private reli-\ngious activity among the ADL unimpaired group (n \n1,793; Table 1). The increased hazard remained statistically\nsignificant for this group after controlling for demographic\neffect persisted after further controlling for explanatory\nvariables, including health practices, social support, and\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study we found that private religious activities\nprovided a protective effect against mortality for an elderly\npopulation free of functional impairment, even after con-\ntrolling for numerous covariates; no such effect persisted in\nthe ADL impaired group. To our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to document a possible protective effect for private re-\nligious activity on mortality in a large community-dwelling\npopulation. Whereas studies of organizational religious ac-\ntivity (ORA) and mortality have shown a positive correla-\ntion (4\u00ad9), this study demonstrates protection via nonorga-\nnizational religious activity (NORA), at least for those who\npractice NORA before the onset of impairment in ADLs.\nImpairment in ADLs has long been recognized as a\nFunctional health status, as measured by ADL impairment,\nis often viewed as a \"method of conceptualizing [overall]\nhealth status\" (19). Because declining health has been asso-\nciated with increased private religiousness (14,15), our\nanalysis was stratified by ADL impairment. The purpose\nwas to distinguish between those praying in a foxhole (i.e.,\noffering prayer in times of need at the end of life) and those\nwho may have had a long-term habit of private devotionals\nmore likely to positively affect physical health.\nA study by Koenig and coworkers demonstrated that an\nill, elderly population may not be able to overcome the force\nof impending mortality even when employing various be-\nhaviors that have been shown in healthy populations to cor-\nrelate with extended survival (42). It is possible that the rel-\natively subtle effects of private religious activity are not\nsufficient to overcome the overwhelming force exerted on\nmortality by health decline to the point of ADL impairment.\nThus, the milder effects of private religious activities on\nmortality are more detectable among those persons who are\nrelatively healthy. Future studies may want to ask how long\na person has been engaged in private religious activity, to\ndetermine if habits begun after the onset of ADL impair-\nment are begun too late to show a survival benefit.\nA number of hypotheses have been offered to explain the\nphysical health benefit from religious activity. Social sup-\nport and health behavior differences have often been sug-\ngested as the primary mechanisms of health benefit, but this\nstudy found, as did other recent religion and mortality stud-\nies (4\u00ad9), that adjustments for differences in these areas did\nnot fully account for the survival benefit religious partici-\npants received.\nAnother prominent theory suggests that the repetitive rit-\nual of prayer or meditation provides health benefits through\nmechanisms such as blood pressure reduction and improved\npsychoneuroendocrine function. This model asserts that\nphysiologic benefits occur as a response to positive emo-\ntions experienced during prayer or meditation (43). Al-\nthough a growing body of literature supports these asser-\ntions, particularly in those who practice meditation techniques\nfrequently (44\u00ad46), the repetitive ritual model does not seem\nadequate to explain the results found in this investigation.\nFirst, frequent meditation is not a part of typical Protestant\nreligious practice. Second, this study found that the protec-\ntive benefits extended nearly equally from those that partic-\nipated daily or more all the way down to those that reported\nonly participating in private religious activity a few times a\nmonth. In other words, the risk appears only in the lowest\nfrequency group, and the benefit extends to all other groups,\nregardless of frequency.\nAlthough the repetitive ritual model does not seem to\nprovide a useful model to explain the findings here, other\nprominent hypotheses do. Many of these, such as improved\npsychological state (43), enhanced immunity (47), better\ncoping methods (48), and stress reduction (49), do not re-\nquire daily participation to provide physical benefit. Those\nwho pray or meditate even occasionally may have an im-\nproved psychological state or better coping skills, and thus\nreduced stress and/or enhanced immunity, because of the\ncomforting knowledge of having a higher being to turn to in\ntime of need. Levin has proposed that simply having reli-\ngious faith may cause \"the fostering of learned optimism\"\n(43). Participating in prayer or Bible study even occasion-\nally may be an identifying feature of those who benefit from\nthis learned optimism engendered by faith. Having a sense\nof the availability of a Higher Power may reduce stress and\nthus provide the various psychological and physical benefits\ndescribed.\nData from this study indicate that the absence of private\nreligious activity and the subsequent lack of psychological\nbenefit may manifest at a level below clinical depression\nand still have a physical health impact, because depression\nwas one of the covariates for which these results were con-\ntrolled.\nThis study has a number of strengths. These include a\nlarge sample size, longitudinal design, good response rate,\nand adjustment for numerous confounders. The endpoint\nchosen, all-cause mortality, is subject to minimal reporting\nbias, and the elderly population surveyed had a mortality\nrate high enough to provide more than adequate follow-up\nevents for hypothesis testing.\nOne significant limitation of this study was the lack of\nspecificity for the private religious activity variable, which\nasks about \"prayer, meditation, or Bible study.\" Although\nmeditation is not typical of Southern Protestant religious\nobservance, sample members were likely reporting both on\nprayer and Bible study, and may have been including in the\ncategory of prayer even brief ritualistic prayer before meals.\nFuture studies should both separate prayer from other types\nof private devotionals and distinguish between different\ntypes or dimensions of prayer. Other limitations included\nthe lack of data on both the nutrition and exercise levels of\nsample members. Additionally, the predominantly Protes-\ntant nature of this population precludes generalizability to\nnon-Protestant populations.\nFuture studies may want to determine what aspect of pri-\nvate religiousness is most beneficial to health. In a compre-\nhensive review of the benefit of social support on mental\nhealth, George described the accumulating evidence that\nspecific dimensions of social support may be differentially\nimportant in protecting against late-life depression. Specifi-\ncally, perception of social support is more protective against\ndepression than objective measures such as social network\nsize or structure (50). In particular, the availability of a con-\nfidant and the perceived adequacy of social interaction have\nshown strong protective health effects in community and\nclinical samples (51,52). In the case of devotional activity, it\nmay be that the perceived availability of a Higher Power or\nthe perceived adequacy of the responsiveness of that Higher\nPower, rather than the actual number of times an elder\ncalled upon that resource, represents the key benefit to sur-\nvival. Future studies may want to estimate the differential\neffect of frequency of devotional behaviors versus the sub-\njective sense of the availability of a higher being.\nThis study indicates that physicians' appropriate support\nof the faith of their patients may have positive health effects.\nThe study also strengthens the assertion that private religion\nusers receive not only psychological but physical benefits.\nIn conclusion, this analysis demonstrated a significant\nprotective effect against mortality for private religious ac-\ntivity in a relatively healthy elderly population. This protec-\ntive effect remained significant even after controlling for\nmultiple confounding variables. Although no protective ef-\nfect persisted in the ADL impaired portion of our popula-\ntion, this finding is consistent with the suppressor model of\nreligious participation (16), which posits that increased\nprayer occurs in response to stress. The ADL impaired\ngroup may have begun private religious activity only in re-\nsponse to declining health, too late to show a protective ef-\nfect against mortality.\n"
