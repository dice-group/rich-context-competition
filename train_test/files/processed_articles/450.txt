The Add Health\nstudy is a comprehensive examination of child/\nadolescent health,\ndesigned to measure numerous variables related to physical and\nmental well being in adolescence.Originally designed to investigate\nhow social contexts (e.g., family, friends, schools, neighborhoods)\nand individual characteristics influence adolescent health and risk\nbehaviors,theAddHealthdataincludesvariablesrelatedtophysical\nand mental health; interpersonal relationships and sexual behav-\niors; education; delinquency and violence; adolescent involvement\nin adult roles; various genetic and biological measures of disease\npresence and processes; as well as a variety of measures about the\nenvironmentsinwhichtheparticipantslive,gotoschool,andwork.\nschool year, when the participants were in grades 7\u00ad12, and the\nmost recent wave of data (Wave IV) was collected in 2008 when\nthe participants were between the ages of 24\u00ad32 years old. The\nmost recent phases of the study examined the effects of the vari-\nous contexts and health during the transition from adolescence to\nearly adulthood.\nThere were no specific personality instruments used as part\nof the variables collected during the first three waves of data\ncollection. However, a portion of the questions from Wave I of\nthe study's questionnaires could possibly be used to develop a\npersonality measure. To date, no study has examined these ques-\ntions to determine: (a) if the survey questions from Wave I had\na lexical relationship to questions from other measures specifi-\ncally designed to measure personality? (b) If so, could any of the\nquestions be aggregated to form a scale? (c) If questions could be\naggregated,what is the internal consistency of such scales? and (d)\nDo these scales actually measure personality factors? Thus, this\nstudy was designed to answer these four questions with the hopes\nthat if dimensions of personality can be measured in the Add\nHealth data, they can then be used to investigate the relationship\nbetween child/adolescent personality traits and health outcomes\nboth proximally (in childhood/adolescence) and distally (early\nadulthood).\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy design\nTheNationalLongitudinalStudyofAdolescentHealth(AddHealth)\nwas initiated in 1994 under a grant from the National Institute of\nChild Health and Human Development with co-funding from 17\nother federal agencies. Researchers in this study collected data in\nmultiple waves through the use of in-home, in-school, and school\nadministratorquestionnaires.Itwasdesignedtobethelargest,most\ncomprehensive survey of adolescents ever undertaken to study the\nhealth-related behaviors of adolescents (grades 7 through 12) and\ntheir outcomes in adulthood.Moreover,theAdd Health sample has\nmultiple sub-samples such as participants who are twins,adoptees,\nand siblings, as well as information on the participants'family and\nsocial networks,all of which can be used to help understand genetic\nand environmental influences on physical and mental health prac-\ntices and outcomes (Duncan et al., 2001).\nSample\nThesampleforthisstudycamefromalltheAddHealthparticipants\nwho completed theWave I In-Home and In-School questionnaires\n(n = 20,745).Fifty percent of the respondents were female and their\nIndian, with the remaining participants not identifying their race.\nHispanic ethnicity.\nInstrument development and psychometric analysis\nTo develop measures of personality traits from the Add Health\nWave I survey items, we combined the lexical (John et al., 1988)\nand factor analytic (Floyd and Widaman,1995) approaches.Both\nmethods have a long history in the development of personal-\nity scales (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1985; Barenbaum and Winter,\n2008) and both approaches have made contributions to the meas-\nurement and understanding personality (Lohman and Rocklin,\nLexical approach. First, we selected a criterion instrument that\nwas designed to measure the FFM personality domains and\nsubsequently made a list of the all the item stems in each of\nthe five domains. The criterion we used was the International\nPersonality Item Pool (IPIP; (Goldberg et al., 2006) version of\nthe NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R; (Costa and\nMcCrae, 1992a). The IPIP NEO-PI-R was selected because (a) it\nwas designed to measure multiple aspects of each factor of the of\nthe FFM; (b) is in the public domain; (c) it has a statement-based\nTable 1 | Description of the five-factor model of personality.\nDimension Description\nNeuroticism (N) Characteristics are related to anxiety and emotional liability versus being placid and emotionally stable\nExtraversion (E) Characteristics are associated with enthusiasm toward life's circumstances, outgoing, and surgency versus introversion\ngravity; encounter with oneself and one's life circumstances\nOpenness to experience (O) Characteristics are associated with the willingness to have new experiences, engage new ideas, and be open to one's own\nfeelings versus being cynical and tough-minded\nAgreeableness (A) Characteristics are related to an inclination toward submission to others, passivity, and subduedness versus being\nindependent and having a strong will\nConscientiousness (C) Characteristics are related to being reliable, responsible, and having self-control versus impulsivity and casualness\nDescriptions developed from Digman (1990).\nYoung and Beaujean Measuring personality in the add health data\nFrontiers in Psychology|Quantitative Psychology and Measurement July 2011 | Volume 2 | Article 158 | 2\n(CFI), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR).\nThese indexes were chosen as they represent both absolute and\nrelative fit indices, and they tend to perform well in simulation\nstudies (Marsh et al., 2005). While it is tenuous to use absolute\ncut-off values for fit indices, usually factor models tend to do an\nadequate job representing the data when: (a) the RMSEA value\nter in EFA as more factors are extracted, we looked for the most\nparsimonious number of factors that would produce adequate\nvalues that best fit the data.\nFor the third criterion, we examined pattern coefficients from\nthe various extractions to gage factor interpretability.While this is\nmore subjective than the other methods we employed,it is still one\nof the most important steps in determining the number of factors\nInternalconsistency.For each personality factor/domain we found\nfrom the previous steps, we summed the items scores within a\ndomain and assessed the internal consistency of the scores using\nall the respondents in the sample. We assessed internal consist-\nencyusingbothCronbach'salphaandMcDonald'somega(Zinbarg\nPredictive validity evidence. In Wave IV (2008) of the Add Health\ndesign, the In-Home instrument purposely collected personality\ndata based on the FFM.For each factor,the questionnaire included\nfour questions. There were 14,800 participants who had data at\nfactor scores (using IRT/CFA) collected from the Wave I person-\nality measure with the factor scores (again, using IRT/CFA) from\nthe Wave IV personality measurement to examine the predictive\nvalidity of the Wave I scales.\nResults\nLexical method\nSearching theWave I questionnaires yielded 21 items that appeared\nto measure neuroticism (N) (8 items), extroversion (E) (7 items),\nand conscientiousness (C) (6 items).\nFactor analytic methods\nThere were missing responses for the 21 items ranging from less\ning no response recorded for any of the items. Consequently,\nthe subsequent factor analyses were conducted using the 20, 721\nparticipants with at least one item score (half being used for\nthe EFA analysis, and the other half being used for the CFA/IRT\nanalysis). For the EFA, missing data was handled using pairwise\npresent method (Kaplan, 2009), whereas the CFA/IRT analysis\nused the full information maximum likelihood estimator (Enders\nand Bandalos, 2001) with the delta paramaterization and logit\nlink. All factor analyses were conducted in Mplus (Muth\u00e9n and\nFor the IL-EFA, the RMSEA values indicated that four factors\nshould be extracted, but the CFI, SRMR and MAP test indicated\nthat only three factors should be extracted. When we examined\nformat that matches many of the items from the Add Health sur-\nveys; (d) the NEO instruments have been used in a wide usage of\nclinical and research settings (Costa and McCrae, 1992a,b); and\n(e) the NEO-PI-R has been shown to work well in adolescent\nsamples (De Fruyt et al., 2000). Second, we searched the Add\nHealth Wave I In-Home and In-School questionnaires for items\nthat lexically or conceptually matched statements from the IPIP\nFactor analytic approach. The purpose of the factor analytic\napproach was twofold. The first purpose was to assess the dimen-\nsionality of the items found in the lexical approach, while the\nsecond was to examine how each of the found items measured\nits respective personality domain. McCrae and Costa (2004; cf.\nMcCrae et al.,1996) recommend assessing dimensionality of NEO\nitems via principal components analysis (PCA). Other method-\nologists have criticized using PCA because it was designed for\nuse with continuous variables, but items on personality tests\nNeglecting the continuous-variable assumption of PCA,and other\ntraditional exploratory factor analytic (EFA) techniques,can lead\nto factor extraction problems because the item thresholds (dif-\nficulties) are not taken into account (Bernstein and Teng, 1989).\nConsequently, we assessed item dimensionality using item-level\nexploratory factor analysis (IL-EFA), which accounts for item\nthresholds by using polychoric correlations estimated via a robust\nweighted least squares estimator (Flora and Curran, 2004) to\nmeasure the relationship among the items (Muth\u00e9n and Kaplan,\nOnce we determined the dimensionality of the items, we then\nconducted an item-response theory/confirmatory factor analysis\nwell each of the items measured their respective personality factors/\ndomains. For the IRT/CFA analysis, we used a robust maximum\nlikelihood estimator.As fit measures are not yet well developed for\nIRT/CFA with item-level data, and because our sample size was so\nlarge, we used the IRT/CFA estimates as a cross-validation of the\nEFA results (Bandalos, 1993), although we did not expect there to\nbe large differences (Kay, 2004). Consequently, we randomly split\nthe participants into two groups and conducted the EFA on the\nfirst group and the IRT/CFA on the second group.\nTo determine the number of factors to extract in the IL-EFA,\nwe used three criteria. First, best practices in EFA (Osborne et al.,\n2008) suggest using more traditional techniques (e.g., minimum\naverage partial test,MAP;(Velicer et al.,2000) to examine the num-\nber of factor to extract. Consequently, we used the MAP test with\nthe polychoric correlations as input. To conduct the MAP test, we\nused the SPSS syntax provided by O'Connor (2000), which uses\nthe original correlations (i.e., the polychoric correlations) in all the\nMAP test steps.\nSecond, we examined the IL-EFA fit statistics after extracting\none to five factors. The fit statistics we used were the root mean\nsquare error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index\n1The survey was designed such that all participants with answers to the In-Home\nquestionnaire also had answers to the In-School Questionnaire.\nYoung and Beaujean Measuring personality in the add health data\nwell as the values for the shortened version of the NEO-PI-R, the\nNEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). Across the N, E, and C\ndomains, the internal consistency estimates for the Add Health\npersonality scales are almost identical to the averages from the\nNEO-FFI (largest difference: 0.04) and are very close to averages\nfor all the NEO instruments (largest difference:0.07), which is\nremarkable given that the current scales have from 3 to 6 items,\nwhereas the NEO-PI-R has 60 items for each scale and the NEO-\nFFI has 12 items for each scale.\nPredictive validity\nThe results from the analysis of the personality data gathered in\nWave IV (2008) of the Add Health study is given in Table 6. As the\ntable shows, all the Wave IV items had relatively high pattern coef-\nficients on their intended factor.More importantly for the study of\nWave I and Wave IV factors, although modest, are in the expected\ndirections.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to determine how to best measure\npersonality from existing data in a longitudinal dataset that does\nnot utilize a specific personality instrument as part of its collected\ndata.Using survey questions fromWave I of the Longitudinal Study\nof Adolescent Health (Add Health), we sought to determine (a)\nif the survey questions from Wave I had a lexical relationship to\nquestions from other measures specifically designed to measure\npersonality? (b) if so, could any of the questions be aggregated\nTable 2 | Results from the exploratory factor analysis.\nFit measure Number of extracted factors\nFirst factor analysis (21 items)\nSecond factor analysis (13 items)\nCFI, comparative fit index; RMSEA, root mean square error of approximation;\nSRMR, standardized root mean square residual.\nTable 3 | Factor analysis pattern coefficients.\nAdd Health Personality factor Personality factor\nitem identifier\nEFA patternIRT/CFA pattern\ncoefficients coefficients\nN, neuroticism; E, extroversion; C, conscientiousness; EFA, exploratory factor\nanalysis; IRT/CFA, item-response theory/confirmatory factor analysis. \u00ad:\nCoefficient constrained to be zero. The sample was randomly divided into two\ngroups; the EFA was done in the first group and the IRT/CFA on the second.\nare given in Table 4.\nthe pattern coefficients, we found five items across both the three-\nand four-factor extractions that measured little in common with\nthe other items (i.e., all pattern coefficients <0.30 and all com-\nmunalities <0.14). In addition, there were three additional items\nthat had moderate pattern coefficients (between 0.48 and 0.58) on\nthe four-factor solution and low coefficients (<0.30) on the three-\nfactor solution, but the content of these items did not appear to\noverlap with each other. Consequently, we removed these 8 items\nandconductedanadditionalIL-EFAontheremaining13items.The\nvalues of the IL-EFA criterion measures all converged to indicate\nthat a three-factor solution bet fit the data. The results from both\nIL-EFAs are given in Table 2.\nThe pattern coefficients for the IL-EFA are given in the first part\nof Table 3. Each item had a large coefficient (>|0.69|) in only one\ndomain and small coefficients (<|0.19|) for the other two domains.\nThus,while the final 13 items are measuring three dimensions,each\nitem appears to only measure one factor (i.e., the three factors the\nitems are measuring appear to be unidimensional). The pattern\ncoefficients from IRT/CFA are given in second part of Table 3 and,\nas expected, are very similar to those from the IL-EFA, with the\nmaximum absolute difference being 0.06.\nTable 4 shows the final 13 items, similar items from the IPIP\nNEO-PI-R, and where they can be located in the Add Health ques-\ntionnaires and database.

While the values are similar to\ninternal consistency estimates typically found for scores on per-\nsonality questionnaires (Kline, 1998), these estimates can be put\ninto a better context by comparing them to the results of a recent\nmeta-analysis (Caruso, 2000) of various NEO instruments' score\nreliability.

The data is accessible in both public and\nrestricted use formats. The public-use data is free for download-\ning from two sources, but is limited in the variables that can be\naccessed. Specific instructions for accessing the Add Health data,\nas well as the variables included in the public and restricted use\nfiles, are found at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/\ndata. Having measures of personality in the Add Health data\nprovide opportunity for the investigation of child/adolescent\npersonality to a myriad of physical and mental health outcomes,\nboth proximally (in childhood/adolescence) and distally (in\nadulthood). Specifically, neuroticism, extroversion, and consci-\nentiousness could be included in models investigating physical\nand psychological health outcomes such as depression, substance\nabuse, and pregnancy in adolescence and early adulthood; data\nthat is included in the Add Health study.\nFurthermore,existing personality research suggests that various\npersonality traits tend to moderate or mediate the relationship of\nseveral mental health outcomes, such as depression (Ayotte et al.,\nrelationship of specific traits,such as extroversion and neuroticism,\nare related to overall well being (Lynn and Steel, 2006). Having\nmeasures of personality in a large,longitudinal dataset,such as the\nAdd Health dataset, allows researchers to investigate the nature of\nthe relationship (mediating,moderating,or interactive) of person-\nality traits to other variables associated with various mental and\nphysical health outcomes.\nto form a scale? (c) if questions could be aggregated, what is the\ninternal consistency of such scales? and (d) do these scales actually\nmeasure personality factors?\nWe compared the questions used in Wave I of the Add Health\nstudy with items from the IPIP (Goldberg et al., 2006) version of\nthe NEO-PI-R (Costa and McCrae, 1992a). Then we subjected\nthose items to an item-level factor analyses to determine what\nitems to keep, as well as the dimensionality of the domains the\nitems measured. We found that there were 13 items that meas-\nured neuroticism (N), extroversion (E), and conscientiousness\n(C) \u00ad three of the major super-ordinate dimensions of personal-\nity. Although there were only a few items in each of these three\npersonality domains, the factor structure of the items indicates\nthey each measure only one construct (i.e., domain scores are\nunidimensional) and the N, E, and C scores appear to have inter-\nnal consistency estimates (alpha \ncoefficients ranging from 0.76\nto 0.86) similar to NEO Personality instruments, which measure\nthe N, E, and C constructs with 3- to 10-times as many items.\nFurthermore, the factors from Wave I had a modest correlation\nin the expected direction with the factors from Wave IV. There are\nTable 5 | Reliability estimates forAdd HeathWave I personality scores.\nInternal consistency estimate N E C\nfor all NEO instruments1\nfor the NEO-Five Factor Inventory2\nN, neuroticism; E, extroversion; C, conscientiousness.

The ability to create personality\nmeasures within other large-scale data sets allows researchers to\nfurther investigate the relationship of personality traits to other\nmental and physical health outcomes not included in the Add\nHealth study, but nonetheless important in serving mental and\nphysical health needs of children and adolescents that have poten-\ntial ramifications throughout the lifespan.\nDespite the size of the sample and strength of methods\nemployed,the current study is not without limitations.One limi-\ntation is the inability to directly compare how the scores from the\npersonality factors extracted in this study relate to scores of other\nstandardized measures of personality. Another limitation is that\nbecause the Add Health study did not use a specific measure of\npersonality,we could only extract three of the five major personal-\nity factors, and the factors we could extract are made up of only\nlimited number of items.\nA.
