Simultane-\nously, these forces are improving the standard\nof living for college graduates while depress-\ning inflation-adjusted wages for Americans\nwith a high school education or less. Since\n1973 real hourly wages for high school gradu-\nates have fallen 11 percent, and those of school\ndropouts have fallen 18 percent. College\ngraduates, on the other hand, have enjoyed a\n17 percent increase in hourly wages.1\nContributing to the growing disparity in\nthe standard of living among workers, job-\nbased health coverage also has deteriorated\nover the past two decades for less educated\npopulations. As the source of health insurance\nfor 152 million workers and their dependents,\njob-based insurance is closely linked to\nwages, since dollars spent on health insurance\ncoverage represent an alternative form of\ncompensation.2 During the past six years the\nU.S. economy added more than twelve million\njobs, and the unemployment rate fell to the\nnumber of uninsured persons in the United\nStates increased from thirty-five million to\nforty-three million. In 1997, a year in which\nthe unemployment rate fell from 5.3 percent\nto 4.6 percent, the number of uninsured per-\nsons increased by nearly two million.4\nThe same forces that have redistributed\nearnings to more highly educated members of\nthe workforce also are curtailing health cover-\nage for less educated workers. Among Ameri-\ncans living in a family whose head of house-\nhold has a high school diploma or less, the\npercentage of the population without health\nsons from families whose head of household\nholds a college degree, the percentage without\nhealth insurance nudged up only slightly,\nHousehold surveys such as the Current\nPopulation Survey have established the close\nrelationship between family earnings and\nhealth coverage.

The wage distribution of a\nsmall firm's workforce strongly influences\nwhether the firm will offer health benefits to\nits workers.12 Higher-wage firms are more\nlikely than lower-wage firms are to provide\nhealth coverage for their workforce (Exhibit\n2). Only 39 percent of the small firms (fewer\nthan 200 workers) in the low-wage group of-\nfered health benefits to their workers. In con-\ntrast, among the high-wage firms, 82 percent\nof small firms offered health benefits.\nAmong firms of all sizes that offered health\nbenefits, the wage distribution of the work-\nforce was significantly associated with the\n\"coverage rate,\" the percentage of the work-\nforce covered by the firm's health benefits.

High-wage firms had the highest\npercentage of workers eligible for coverage\nand of workers electing coverage. In contrast,\nlow-wage firms had the second-lowest per-\ncentage of workers eligible for coverage and\nthe lowest percentage of eligible workers\nelecting coverage.\nEligibility criteria for part-time workers\ntend to be more stringent at lower-wage firms\nworkers in high-wage firms and 50 percent of\npart-time workers in egalitarian firms were\neligible for health benefits, only 29 percent of\nthose in low-wage firms were eligible. De-\npendent coverage varies little across wage-\ndefined employer groups. Surprisingly, the\ntwo groups most likely to provide coverage\nfor nontraditional partners--same-sex or het-\nerosexual unmarried partners--were low-\nwage and high-wage firms.\npercentage of workers who may choose a con-\nventional health plan or a health maintenance\norganization (HMO) varies little by wage\ngroup (Exhibit 4). Employees at high-wage\nfirms were more likely to have a choice of hy-\nbrid-type managed care plans such as pre-\nferred provider organizations (PPOs) and\npoint-of-service (POS) plans. The median\nnumber of plans offered to employees also var-\nied little by wage-defined group.\nFor all wage-defined groups, managed care\nplans accounted for at least 77 percent of en-\nrollment.14 Enrollment in HMOs was greatest\nin low-wage and low/high-wage firms (Ex-\nhibit 4). High-wage workers were more heav-\nily enrolled in PPOs and POS plans and, sur-\nprisingly, least likely to enroll in conventional\nplans.\nCOVERAGE. During this decade the number\nof uninsured persons has risen, not because\nfewer firms are offering health benefits, but\nlargely because more workers have declined\ncoverage.15 While real wages declined for low-\nwage workers, nominal employee contribu-\ntions for single and family coverage rose more\nWorkers in low-wage firms contributed\n24 percent of the monthly cost for single cov-\nerage and 41 percent of the cost for family\ncoverage (Exhibit 5). In contrast, employees\nat high-wage firms pay 21 percent of the cost\nof single and 27 percent of the cost of family\ncoverage. For family coverage, the share of\npremium paid by workers declines as we\nmove from low- to high-wage firms.\nn COST OF COVERAGE. The overall cost\nof single and family coverage is closely related\nto wage group (Exhibit 5). The average\nmonthly cost for single coverage is $162 for\nlow-wage firms, $173 for low/high-wage\nfirms, and $189 for high-wage firms.

High-wage firms\nwere most likely to provide retiree health\nbenefits to their workers (Exhibit 6). Seventy-\nsix percent of workers in high-wage firms\nwere offered retiree health benefits, compared\nwith 48 percent of workers in low-wage firms\nand 50 percent in low/high-wage firms. As we\nmove from low- to high-wage groups, a grow-\ning percentage of workers are employed by a\nfirm offering retiree health benefits.\nn FLEXIBLE BENEFITS. Flexible benefits\nallow employees to pay for any health insur-\nance contributions, as well as other employee\nbenefits, with pretax earnings. Another ap-\npealing aspect of flexible-spending accounts\nis that employees may use pretax dollars to\npay their cost-sharing obligations, such as de-\nductibles, coinsurance, and physician charges\nin excess of the insurance payment. Higher-\nwage firms were more likely than lower-wage\nfirms were to provide flexible-spending ac-\ncounts (Exhibit 6). Fifty-five percent of em-\nployees in low-wage firms were offered a flex-\nible-spending plan. In contrast, 81 percent of\nworkers in egalitarian and high-wage firms\nwere offered such a plan.\nAworker's health insurance clearly\nis influenced by the wages of other em-\nployees in the firm. Since health bene-\nfits represent an alternative form of compen-\nsation, the surprise is not the presence but the\nrecurring pattern of the relationship between\nthe wages of a firm's workforce and the firm's\nhealth benefits.\nReflecting on the failure to pass the Clin-\nton administration's Health Security Act,\nWalter Zelman, a key administration adviser,\nobserved the following:\n[W]e kept trying to link middle-class concerns\nto lower-income concerns, knowing that we\nhad an opportunity to piggyback the universal\ncoverage issue onto middle-class insecurities\nregarding thepotential loss ofhealth insurance.18\nWhat is apparent from our study is the\ndivergent interests of workers in firms with\nconcentrations of low- and high-wage work-\ners. The current system of employer-\nsponsored health insurance, when combined\nwith the tax exclusion of employer contribu-\ntions for health benefits, contributes to the\nclass system of health care coverage in the\nUnited States.19 Workers from high-wage\nfirms will be made worse off by reforms of a\nsystem that equalizes the tax subsidy for\nhealth insurance.20 However, it is in the inter-\nest of the uninsured and workers from low-\nwage and low/high-wage firms to equalize the\ntax subsidy across the population.\nOur findings strongly suggest that low-\nwage families obtain some protection against\nbecoming uninsured if they find work in firms\nwhere a substantial share of the employees\nearn more than they do.
