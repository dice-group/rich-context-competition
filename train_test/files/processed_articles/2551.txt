Latinos and African Americans, however, express this desire more\nAmericans live in neighborhoods with mostly people of their own race (Crowder\net al. 2012; Iceland et al. 2002). One possible reason for this mismatch is that people\nanswering survey questions about neighborhood racial preferences feel a need to\nprovide interviewers with socially desirable answers. People might want to think of\nthemselves as tolerant and over-state their true desire for diversity (e.g., Krysan\nargument goes, in neighborhoods with less diversity than they say they prefer.\nAlternatively, people might honestly desire the level of diversity they report to\ninterviewers but that desire for diversity is outweighed by other factors in the\nhousing search. That is, people may need to choose between neighborhoods based\non the neighborhood's racial diversity, ease of travel to jobs, school quality, and\naffordability (among other neighborhood features), and they might value the latter\nneighborhood characteristics more than its racial diversity. Relatedly, with\ncomparatively few integrated neighborhoods in any given metropolitan area, the\npossibility of finding a neighborhood with the desired level of integration might be\nrelatively small. This is complicated by the fact that racial composition tends to\ncorrelate with other neighborhood characteristics (e.g., Krysan et al. 2009), making\nit even harder to satisfy all criteria in the housing search. The tension between stated\npreferences (those that respondents tell interviewers) and revealed preferences\n(those preferences inferred by people's actions) has been thoroughly debated in the\nBut missing from this debate is that both of these explanations rely on the\nassumption that the ultimate move residents make reflects the outcome of choices\nmade during a search process. The housing search process--and especially its\nracial and ethnic dimensions--is something that is largely unstudied. The social\ndesirability explanation would maintain that people do not search for housing in\nareas as diverse as they say they want. The revealed preferences literature would\nsuggest that people do search for housing in diverse neighborhoods but compromise\nE. Havekes et al.\non their preference for diversity for other neighborhood amenities. Regardless of\nwhich of these interpretations is correct, what is clear is that the process that links the\nstated preferences and revealed preferences--the actual housing search--has not been\nstudied systematically. The purpose of this analysis is to begin to do just that. We use\nthe most detailed data available on expressed racial preferences and housing searches,\ncombine it with theoretically grounded expectations about why preferences, searches,\nand outcomes may be (mis)matched, and thereby provide an exploratory analysis\nintended to lay the groundwork for future data collection and theorizing about housing\nsearches and their role in shaping neighborhood racial patterns.1\nSpecifically, to demonstrate the value of focusing on the search process, we use\nthe 2004\u00ad2005 Chicago Area Study (CAS). For reasons we will delineate, these data\nare not ideal; however, this is the most complete data available which include\nresidents' stated racial residential preferences, retrospective residential search\nhistories in 41 communities in the Chicago metropolitan area, and current\nresidential location, thus enabling us to examine how racial and ethnic composition\nbetween these three types of communities (where people prefer, where they search,\nand where they live) might differ. In doing so, we begin to shed light on the search\nprocess as an overlooked mechanism that can help explain the perpetuation of racial\nresidential segregation nearly a half-century after the end of the Civil Rights\nMovement and the passage of the Fair Housing Act. Drawing on spatial\nassimilation, place stratification, and housing information theories, we explore the\npossible direction of (mis)matches between the racial and ethnic composition of\nwhere people say they would ideally like to live, where they searched for housing,\nand where they currently live. Two main research questions guide our analysis: (1)\nDo whites, blacks, and Latinos search for housing and reside in neighborhoods they\nsay they prefer in terms of the neighborhood's racial and ethnic composition and (2)\nwhat factors contribute to a mismatch between preferences, the racial/ethnic\ncomposition of search locations and the current neighborhood?\nPrevious Research\nMany studies investigate racial and ethnic residential preferences, with most of\nthem using a show card method in which respondents evaluate hypothetical\nneighborhoods that show varying degrees of racial and ethnic diversity (e.g., see\nFarley et al. 1994, 1978). This research demonstrates that an individual's race is an\nimportant factor in shaping neighborhood preferences. Whites tend to favor\npredominantly white neighborhoods, while blacks prefer integrated neighborhoods\n(i.e., a 50 % white, 50 % black neighborhood) and see `all white' but also `all black'\n1 Note that this emphasis on housing searches can shed light on how racial residential segregation is\nperpetuated--or how it can be reduced--and it can also inform the lively debate throughout social\nsciences on the issue of neighborhood effects. Specifically, there is a thorny selection problem in any\nstudies trying to understand how one's neighborhood impacts a range of outcomes, including health for\nexample. The question is whether the neighborhood impacts one's health, for example, or whether people\nwho are unhealthy ``select'' a certain kind of neighborhood. By focusing on the search process, and\nunderstanding how people end up living where they do, we can inform this debate (Krysan et al. 2014).\nRealizing Racial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences?...\n50 % white neighborhood over an `all Latino' neighborhood (Charles 2005).\nBecause the original show card method created only a limited set of racial\ncompositions and because it showed only two groups at a time (Farley et al. 1978),\nCharles (2000) created a different survey instrument in which respondents were\nasked to create their ideal neighborhood composition. Using this tool, Charles\n(2006) found that all groups drew quite integrated neighborhoods but also had a\npreference for at least a substantial number of co-ethnics that exceeded the share of\nany other outgroup. This was true for all groups, but especially for whites.\nMore recently, studies seek to uncover the factors that underlie these ethnic\nneighborhood preferences. Vignette experiments, in which respondents were\npresented with hypothetical neighborhoods in which relevant neighborhood\ncharacteristics systematically varied, have been successfully used to separate\nethnic/racial motivations from socioeconomic concerns. These studies indicate that\npart of the racial preference patterns can indeed be attributed to neighborhood\nconcerns that are related to race, such as poverty or crime (Emerson et al. 2001;\nremains an important factor in shaping residential preferences.\nStudies have begun to investigate how these stated racial residential preferences\ncorrespond to the actual neighborhood racial composition of an individual. Clark\n(1992) demonstrated that although most blacks preferred an integrated black\u00adwhite\nneighborhood, only 7 % realized this preference. Among whites and Latinos, most\nrealized their preference for either a predominantly white (for whites) or\npredominantly Latino (for Latinos) neighborhood. Importantly, however, of those\nwho preferred an integrated neighborhood, a large majority still moved to a\nneighborhood that was predominantly inhabited by their own group.\nFreeman (2000) examined the role of racial/ethnic preferences in residential\nattainment processes, while taking into consideration household income, wealth,\nand other background characteristics. He showed that black and Latino preferences\nfor living with whites were positively related to the percentage white in the\nrespondent's actual neighborhood. Similarly, Ihlanfeldt and Scafidi (2002)\nconcluded that blacks with a stronger preference for black neighborhoods are also\nmore likely to reside in such neighborhoods, though they maintained that\npreferences played only a minor role in residential attainment. Finally, Adelman\n(2005) demonstrated that preferences do not perfectly correspond with actual\nneighborhoods. His study in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles showed that\nmiddle-class blacks who prefer to live in a racially integrated neighborhood live on\naverage in neighborhoods that are 60 % black and 30 % white, while middle-class\nwhites who prefer racially integrated neighborhoods reside in predominantly white\nneighborhoods (i.e., on average 85 % white).\nOverall, the above studies showed that--although residential preferences\ncorrelate with actual compositions--generally respondents live in neighborhoods\nwith more co-ethnics than they report preferring. The purpose of this study is to\ndraw attention to the intermediate stage between preferences and outcomes--\nnamely, the housing search process itself--as a possible mechanism for\nE. Havekes et al.\nunderstanding how this (mis)match occurs. Treating the housing search as the\nintermediate stage between what people say they want and what they have, we can\nimagine at least two ways a mismatch can occur. A mismatch between preferences\nand current neighborhood composition could occur because people might not search\nin neighborhoods that match their preferences (henceforth, we refer to this as Stage\n1) or they might search in preferred neighborhoods but end up living in\nneighborhoods that do not match the search locations (i.e., Stage 2).\nTo date, there are only a few studies that examine the role of racial composition\nin housing searches. Krysan (2008) found that in the Detroit metropolitan area\nwhites mainly search in all white communities, whereas blacks explore more varied\ntypes of neighborhoods, ranging from predominantly white to predominantly black.\nRelatedly, Krysan and Bader (2007) investigated the Detroit-area neighborhoods\npeople would ``seriously consider'' and ``never consider.'' Whites mainly consider\npredominantly white neighborhoods as serious options, while blacks would\nseriously consider neighborhoods with large as well as small percentages of blacks.\nBader and Krysan (2015) replicate their research in the Chicago area and find that\nthe patterns of whites' racial matching and blacks' openness to communities of\nmany racial compositions. They find that Latinos were open to many communities,\nbut search patterns emulated white preferences after controlling for economic\nfactors.\nIn the present study, we examine the neighborhood preferences of whites, blacks,\nand Latinos and their relationship to the racial and ethnic composition of\nneighborhoods in which they searched for housing and in which they currently\nlive. Although we are highlighting a new way to think about the causes of racial\nresidential segregation--by focusing on the housing search process--we draw on\nexisting theories of spatial assimilation, place stratification, and housing information\nto inform our understanding of why mismatches might occur and how housing\nsearches contribute to them. The existing models emphasize constraints during the\nprocess of neighborhood selection that result in a mismatch between preferences\nand outcomes. Yet, the nature of the constraints highlighted by these theories differs\nand they are likely to operate at different stages of the process. In the following, we\ndiscuss these theories and elaborate on who is likely to have a mismatch, in what\nstage, and in which direction.2\n2 As noted above, an alternative to these substantive explanations for the mismatch is a methodological\none: individuals may state a preference for more diversity in their neighborhoods than they actually desire\ndue to social desirability pressures to report more liberal racial attitudes in a survey interview. Existing\nresearch suggests this bias is stronger for whites than African Americans; little is known about its\ninfluence on Latinos (Krysan 1998; Krysan & Couper 2003). In all cases, however, we expect social\ndesirability pressures to be strongest for the measure of residential preferences, and so its contribution to\npossible mismatches is greater at stage one of the process, where individuals do not search in\nneighborhoods that match their preferences in the first place because those preferences for diversity are\nover-stated.\nRealizing Racial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences?...\nWho is Likely to Have a Mismatch, at What Stage, and in Which\nDirection?\nThe spatial assimilation model (Alba and Logan 1993; Massey 1985) argues that the\nability of individuals to realize their residential desires is a function of a household's\nopportunities and constraints--particularly socioeconomic. Socioeconomic\nresources (such as income and education) increase a household's available choice\nof alternatives in the housing market (De Groot et al. 2011) so that mismatches\nbetween preferences and outcomes may be due to inadequate socioeconomic\nresources to actualize preferences. Applying this model to our research, (a lack of)\nsocioeconomic resources might create a mismatch at either stage. First, people may\nsearch in neighborhoods similar to their preferences, but those places might turn out\nto be financially unattainable (Stage 2). Additionally, households might consider\ntheir financial possibilities when making a first selection of possible neighborhoods\nto search and, hence, a lack of socioeconomic resources might also prevent people\nfrom searching in neighborhoods that match their preferences (Stage 1).\nWe expect the role of socioeconomic resources in shaping the direction of\nmismatches to function differently for whites, blacks, and Latinos, because of the\nrelationship between neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics and neighbor-\nhood racial/ethnic composition. The racial and ethnic composition of neighborhoods\nis strongly related to its socioeconomic status. Neighborhoods with substantial\nAfrican American and Latino populations (as compared to white populations) are\ngenerally associated with socioeconomic disadvantage and poverty (e.g., Charles\nblacks and Latinos would likely result in more `own group' members in their\nneighborhood than they prefer, while for whites, fewer resources will result in fewer\n`own group' members than they prefer.\ninstitutional barriers that have their origin outside of the household as the primary\ndriver of segregation. This model expects racial and ethnic minority groups to be\nless likely to realize their residential preferences because of discrimination. Housing\ndiscrimination could influence the housing search by generating mismatches at both\nstages. First, a person might search in a particular neighborhood, but be deterred\nfrom living thereby discriminatory actions by real estate agents, landlords, or loan\nofficers. This would create a mismatch between the search locations and outcomes\n(Stage 2). Given patterns of discriminatory treatment, this would be most likely to\naffect African Americans and Latinos.\nBut geographic steering, a less direct form of discrimination that continues to be\nuncovered by audit studies (Turner and Ross 2005) is another way that place\nstratification theories can shed light on the housing search process. Specifically,\ngeographic steering is the idea that different racial and ethnic groups are shown\ndifferent kinds of neighborhoods during the search process. This likely decreases the\nopportunity to search and reside in neighborhoods that match racial and ethnic\npreferences. Since geographic steering takes place when people are searching for a\nplace to live, it may be especially influential on the neighborhoods in which people\nE. Havekes et al.\nsearch for housing (and, thus, constitute a mismatch in Stage 1). The direction of\nsteering and its impact on mismatches varies depending on the race and ethnicity of\nthe searcher. Specifically, whites are encouraged to consider predominantly white\nand more affluent neighborhoods, whereas blacks and Latinos are steered to a more\nrestricted number of less affluent minority neighborhoods (Farley 1996; Turner and\nRoss 2005). In this way, processes of geographical steering might lead to whites,\nblacks, and Latinos both searching and subsequently residing in neighborhoods that\nhave a larger percentage of their own group than they prefer.\nFinally, housing information theories emphasize a factor that is largely neglected\nin traditional spatial assimilation and place stratification arguments, i.e., knowledge\nof housing options, which may influence the mismatch between preferences and\nsearch locations in particular (i.e., Stage 1). This fits in the general category of the\ncognitive resources used in housing searches (O\n\u00a8 zu\nbut for our purposes, we focus specifically on knowledge of the communities in\nwhich one might search (e.g., see Krysan and Bader 2009). Specifically, insufficient\nknowledge of the housing market may prevent people from searching in\nneighborhoods that match their preferences, resulting in a mismatch between\nresidential preferences and actual spatial patterns. To successfully find housing in\nneighborhoods that meet the wishes of residents in terms of racial/ethnic\ncomposition, residents need at least some knowledge about the possible commu-\nnities in their search area that fit their preferences (Brown and Moore 1970; Krysan\nand Bader 2009). It is unlikely (though not impossible) that people search in\ncommunities they know nothing about, or at least the search costs of gathering\ninformation about these communities are higher (Krysan and Bader 2009).\nAdditionally, knowledge of the specific neighborhoods in an area has an important\nimpact on where people eventually end up living (Clark 1986).\nTo the extent that knowledge differs for racial/ethnic groups and to the extent that\nknowledge varies depending on the racial/ethnic composition of the neighborhood,\nthen this knowledge can help us to understand who experiences mismatches in the\nsearch process, and in which direction. Krysan and Bader (2009) showed, for\nexample, that Latinos have less general knowledge about different communities in\nthe Chicago metropolitan area and African Americans' generally less knowledge\nabout overwhelmingly white and distant suburbs might complicate the search for\nhousing in more integrated neighborhoods. Whites, on the other hand, are less aware\nof racially mixed--even those that are diverse but still majority white--neighbor-\nhoods. Hence, whites, blacks, and Latinos alike have better knowledge of\nneighborhoods dominated by their own racial/ethnic group and this might lead to\nsearches (and moves) to neighborhoods that have larger percentages of their own\ngroup than they would prefer.\nFinally, to the degree that individual searches are informed by social networks,\nwe may find that individuals both search and reside in neighborhoods with greater\npercentages of their own group because these likely race-homogenous networks\nprovide information that is similarly racially homogenous. In particular, individuals\nwho search using informal methods, such as relying on family and friends, may be\nmore likely to search in places with greater numbers of co-ethnics than they desire.\nThis is because social networks tend to be racially segregated, and so the search\nRealizing Racial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences?...\ninformation provided by these networks may be less varied, as social capital\ntheorists would predict (Granovetter 1973). More specifically, since social networks\ntend to be racially and ethnically segregated and community knowledge is shaped\nby race, those who rely on their network when searching for housing may be more\nlikely (compared to those who use, e.g., newspaper ads or real estate agents) to\nsearch in neighborhoods with a greater percentage own group than they might\nprefer.\nThe extant theories of residential segregation processes just reviewed have clear\nexpectations about how the housing search process unfolds; importantly, though,\nthese expectations are often implicit and almost always unmeasured. In this paper,\nwe offer a rare and exploratory but systematic look at elements of this process. By\nassessing the mismatches--and where they occur--we can offer ideas about future\ndata collections and, importantly, policy interventions that might break the cycle of\nsegregation that the outcomes of these searches perpetuate.\nData and Measures\nChicago Area Study\nconsisting of a multistage area probability sample (stratified by neighborhood racial/\nethnic composition) representative of adults 21 years and older living in households\nin Cook County, Illinois (which includes the city of Chicago and many surrounding\nsuburbs). In addition to residential preferences, these data include retrospective\ninformation on housing searches and the racial/ethnic composition of current\nneighborhoods. Black and Latino respondents and those living in racially mixed\nneighborhoods were oversampled. A total of 789 respondents were interviewed\npurpose of our research, we have insufficient numbers of other racial/ethnic groups\nto do separate analyses, and so we limit our study to white, black, and Latino\nrespondents (n = 769 in the total sample, though as noted below our analyses are\nlimited to a smaller subset).\nRacial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences\nFollowing Charles (2000), to measure racial and ethnic neighborhood preferences\nrespondents were asked to imagine a neighborhood that had the racial/ethnic mix\n3 The cross-sectional nature of our data bears special mention since we measure preferences, search\nlocations, and outcomes all at a single point in time. Therefore, issues of causal direction remain uncertain\nas preferences might not only influence the choice for a particular neighborhood, but experiences during\nthe search process and the racial/ethnic composition of the current neighborhood might also affect\npeople's preferences. Our data do not allow us to address this problem of reverse causality. Instead, our\ngoal is to illuminate the degree to which preferences differ from searches and current neighborhood\nconditions and the individual factors associated with possible mismatches. As we note in the conclusion\nof the paper, we fully acknowledge the limitations of our data, but we argue that it is the best we have and\nis suitable for our purposes of illuminating this understudied element of segregation processes.\nE. Havekes et al.\nthey personally would feel most comfortable living in (the exact question wordings\nof the main survey questions used in our analyses can be found in the appendix).\nNext, they were presented a card showing a neighborhood with 15 houses of which\nthe middle house represented their own house (see Fig. 1). Respondents used the\nletters `W' for white, `B' for black, `L' for Latino, `AS' for Asian American, and\n`AB' for Arab American, to fill out their ideal neighborhood racial/ethnic\ncomposition. We calculated the percentage of houses that were of the respondent's\nown racial/ethnic group. Respondents who did not complete the housing card were\nlistwise deleted (n = 18). To reduce the possibility of socially desirable responses,\nas much as possible respondents were matched to an interviewer of similar race or\nethnicity. In our final sample, 75 % of the respondents were interviewed by\nsomeone of their own race.\nRacial/Ethnic Composition of Search and Current Neighborhood\nRespondents were also shown a booklet of maps that labeled 41 communities in the\nChicago metropolitan area (see Fig. 2), including neighborhoods in the city of\nChicago (n = 15 of the total 77) as well as suburban communities (n = 26 of the\ntotal 288). Inside the city of Chicago, the communities represent administrative\nboundaries (so-called Communities Areas) that are well known among Chicago area\nresidents, and roughly correspond to `neighborhoods.' Suburban communities are\nadministrative boundaries defined by the census as `census designated places'\n(CDPs) that usually align with community jurisdiction boundaries. The 41\ncommunities identified on the map were purposively selected to cover substantively\nimportant categories (e.g., a range of different racial compositions, different housing\nFig. 1 Show card presented to the respondents to indicate the racial/ethnic composition of their ideal\nneigborhood\nRealizing Racial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences?...\nprices, locations, etc.) and to be sure that areas would likely be known to a fair\nnumber of Chicago residents (i.e., very small communities were excluded). Table 1\ncompares the racial and ethnic composition of the neighborhoods and communities\nthat were shown on the map (Column 1) with those that were not (Column 2).\nCommunities with populations over 85 % white (``all white'' neighborhoods) are\nunderrepresented on the map, whereas racially/ethnically mixed communities are\noverrepresented compared to their presence in the entire Chicago metropolitan area.\nRespondents marked all the identified neighborhoods on the map in which they\nhad searched for housing in the past 10 years. We removed those respondents\n(n = 209) who had lived for more than 10 years at their present address and had not\nactively searched for housing in the meantime. There were also a total of 160\nrespondents who did search for housing in the past 10 years but who indicated that\nthey had not searched for housing in any of the 41 communities shown on the map.\nThese were also removed from our analytic sample, resulting in a final sample size\nFig. 2 Map provided to the respondents as a tool to indicate their search locations\n4 Additional analyses indicated that in the removed subsample (i.e., those who did not search for housing\nin the past 10 years and those who did not search in one of the 41 communities), whites, blacks, and older\npeople are slightly overrepresented. Furthermore, the omitted respondents are slightly more likely to have\nan own group neighborhood preference and to live in a neighborhood with larger shares of their own\ngroup. Nevertheless, patterns of mismatches between preferences and current neighborhoods are similar\nto the ones found in the analytic sample.\nE. Havekes et al.\nTo indicate the racial/ethnic composition of the search locations we calculated\nthe average percentage of a respondent's own racial/ethnic group in the\ncommunities a respondent searched for housing (community figures are based on\n2000 census statistics).

If the average percentage of own racial/ethnic group in the\nsearch locations or in the current neighborhood of a respondent falls within a range\nof plus or minus 15 % compared to the percentage own group in their ideal\nneighborhood, we considered preferences and search locations/current neighbor-\nhood to be a `match.' Preferences measured using the neighborhood cards are not\ncontinuous (they increase in increments of 7 % for each additional house) and,\nhence, this 15 % difference equals approximately the addition (or subtraction) of\ntwo same-race neighbors from a respondent's neighborhood card. This means that\nrespondents who have a mismatch should have added or removed at least two\nhouses on the preference card to match their average search locations and current\nneighborhood. Similarly, the percentage of respondents who reside in a neighbor-\nhood with a similar, larger, or smaller percentage of own group than in their average\nsearch location were calculated.\nThe variables percentage own racial/ethnic group in respondents' ideal neighbor-\nhood, average search neighborhood, and current neighborhood as well as their\nassociated mismatches are summarized in Table 2. All presented analyses use a weight\nthat incorporates a selection weight and an adjustment for nonresponse (which was the\ninverse of the response rate in each primary sampling unit). Furthermore, they account\nfor the clustered nature of our sampling approach, using Stata's ``svy'' command.\nDescriptive Results\nWe start this section with an overview of the search behaviors of whites, blacks, and\nHispanics in the Chicago metropolitan area. The number of indicated search locations\nranged from 0 to 41, but on average respondents indicated 3.6 communities on the map\nin which they had actively searched for housing in the past 10 years. The number of\ncommunities in which people reported searching differs among racial and ethnic\n5 We acknowledge that the variation in the geographical scale of the neighborhoods in the various\nmeasurements could in itself create a mismatch in racial and ethnic composition. The show card used for\nthe ``ideal'' neighborhood implies a small area (See Fig. 1), whereas the ``current'' and ``searched''\nneighborhood measures use larger census tracts and communities. Mismatches might arise either because\nindividuals may attach particular importance to the racial/ethnic composition of their immediate (micro)\nneighborhood (rather than the larger community), or because individuals live in a micro neighborhood\nthat matches their preferences but that is located in a larger community that does not match. Yet, we\nbelieve that this possible bias is similar for whites, blacks, and Latinos. It seems, therefore, unlikely that\ndifferences in the geographic scale of neighborhoods across our measurement instruments could account\nfor racial/ethnic differences in the degree of mismatch.\nE.

This suggests\nthat people tend to focus their searches on geographically proximate areas. Due to\nthe cross-sectional and retrospective nature of the data, we cannot make too much of\nthis finding, however, since we do not know where the respondent was living when\nthey undertook the search they are reporting about (it could have been their current\nneighborhood; it could have been somewhere else altogether).\nTable 3 presents an overview of the mean stated racial/ethnic neighborhood\npreferences, racial/ethnic composition of the search locations, and the composition\nof the current neighborhood for whites, blacks, and Latinos. First, Panel A shows\nthat all groups drew rather diverse neighborhoods but they also prefer to live in a\nneighborhood with at least a substantial number of co-ethnics. This is especially true\np \\ 0.01). Second, all groups currently reside in a neighborhood in which the\nmajority of residents belong to their own racial/ethnic group, though this pattern is\nLatinos (Panel B of Table 3). Panel C shows that whites mainly search in\nneighborhoods with a substantial proportion of their own group and this is less\nand Latinos search in neighborhoods with a substantial proportion of their own\ngroup but even larger shares of whites (Panel C of Table 3).\nTable 4 identifies the percentage of respondents who have a (mis)match in\nvarious combinations of the percentage of their own racial/ethnic group in (1) their\nideal neighborhood; (2) their current neighborhood; and (3) their search locations.\nPanel A reports the extent to which racial/ethnic preferences are reflected in the\ncomposition of the neighborhoods where respondents currently live. The majority of\nwhite (68 %), black (64 %), and Latino respondents (56 %) live in neighborhoods\nthat have more of their own racial/ethnic group than they say they prefer (statistical\ntests do not reveal differences across groups on this measure). Panel B of Table 4\nshows, furthermore, that the majority of whites in our sample (52 %) search in\nneighborhoods with a larger share of their own group than they say they prefer. This\npercentage is significantly larger compared to 21 % of blacks (F = 14.2, p \\ 0.01)\nplurality of Latinos (47 %) search in neighborhoods that match their preferences\nwith respect to the percentage own group.6 Finally, Panel C of Table 4 shows that\nnearly two-thirds of whites generally reside in neighborhoods that match the\n6 Additional analyses in which we calculated if at least one search location (instead of the average\nlocation) matched their ideal neighborhood, showed a similar pattern.

The proportion\nof whites is almost double the approximately one-third of blacks (F = 6.27,\nproportions of own-group residents as the communities in which they searched.\nMost blacks (60 %) and Latinos (56 %), on the other hand, reside in neighborhoods\nTable 3 Stated racial/ethnic preferences, racial/ethnic composition of search locations and current\nneighborhood\nWhites\nBlacks\nLatinos\nA.

Havekes et al.\nwith a larger share of their own group than in the average neighborhood they\nsearched for housing.\nIn sum, whites both seem to search and reside in neighborhoods with a larger\npercentage own group than they say they prefer. These descriptive results imply that\nwhites experience a mismatch in an early stage of the residential process (i.e., Stage\n1); namely, they do not search in neighborhoods that match the racial composition\nthey say they prefer. Meanwhile, blacks and Latinos search in neighborhoods with\ntheir preferred percentage of own group, but they live in neighborhoods with larger\npercentages of their own group than those in which they searched (and those which\nthey preferred). As a result, we conclude that blacks and Latinos experience a\nmismatch at the later stage of the process (i.e., Stage 2) since they reside in\nneighborhoods that have both more of their own group than they desire, and also\nthan the neighborhoods in which they searched.\nWhat Factors are Related to Mismatches?\nOur primary aim in this study is to explore the extent to which housing searches\nmatch preferences and outcomes; we also laid out a theoretical framework that\nsuggests a range of possible explanations for these mismatches. The preceding\ngroup-level analyses suggest that mismatches do occur, and that their patterns are\ngenerally consistent with a number of possible explanations. Data constraints--in\nparticular, small sample sizes and a lack of longitudinal data--do not permit a\ndetailed analysis of the individual-level predictors of a mismatch at the two stages.\nHowever, our dataset includes a number of variables that allow us to explore the\nindividual-level factors associated with mismatches. We examine who is more\nlikely to have ``too many'' of their own group by examining its relationship to\nsocioeconomic resources, information resources and experiences of self-reported\nhousing discrimination, variables that correspond to spatial assimilation, place\nstratification, and information theories.\nEstimating Correlates of Stage One Mismatches Among Whites\nIn exploring which factors are related to a mismatch, we focus on the most common\nkind of mismatch within each racial and ethnic group. For whites, we model the\nStage 1 mismatch: the probability that whites search in a neighborhood with more\nwhites than in their ideal neighborhood (Table 5). Based on our theoretical\nframework, the relevant factors are measures of knowledge (i.e., whites might not\nknow about the places that match their preferences) and education (to capture social\ndesirability effects which operate more strongly among the more highly educated).\nInformation resources were measured by a respondent's knowledge about different\nneighborhoods in the Chicago metropolitan area that we obtained by asking which\nneighborhoods on the map (identical to Fig. 2) they did not know anything about.\nWe used the number of neighborhoods a respondent indicated as a measure of a\ngeneral lack of knowledge of the housing market. To assess whether respondents\nhad racially/ethnically biased knowledge of the housing market, we calculated the\nRealizing Racial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences?...\naverage percentage of a respondent's own group in the neighborhoods they\nindicated they do not know anything about and compared this to the average\npercentage own group in the neighborhoods which they did not indicate (and thus\npresumably do know about). We created a dummy variable identifying those\nrespondents for whom the average percentage own group in the neighborhoods they\ndo know is larger than in the ones they do not know. We controlled for how many\nyears the respondent has lived in the metropolitan area since people who have lived\nlonger in the area likely know more about the places in it. We measured a\nrespondent's education with four dummy variables: less than high school degree,\nhigh school degree, some college but less than a Bachelor's degree, and Bachelor's\ndegree or higher (reference).\nThe results from Table 5 indicate that whites who possess greater knowledge of\nwhite neighborhoods than integrated ones search in neighborhoods with more\nwhites compared to their stated ideal neighborhood. White preferences mismatched\ntheir search neighborhood 55 % of the time for whites who possessed greater\nknowledge of white neighborhoods, compared to 33 % of whites with less racially\nbiased knowledge of neighborhoods.7 We found no association between education\nand a mismatch between stated preferences and searches.\nEstimating Stage Two Mismatches Among Blacks and Latinos\nWe concentrate on the mismatch at Stage 2 for Blacks and Latinos: the probability\nthat blacks and Hispanics reside in a neighborhood with more own group than in the\naverage search location (Table 6). Here the relevant factors are income (i.e., blacks\nand Latinos might not be able to afford to live in the neighborhoods where they\nsearch for housing) and experience with discrimination (i.e., they might face\nbarriers after searching in these neighborhoods). We measured household income in\nTable 5 Logistic regression analysis of the probability that whites (n = 123) search in a neighborhood\nwith more own group than in their ideal neighborhood; logit coefficients and standard error (SE)\nCoefficient SE\nEducation: less than BA degree (vs. [BA degree or higher) 0.13 0.78\n7 We calculated the value of racially biased knowledge as P(mismatch) = exp(b0\n? bbiased knowledge\n)/\n? bbiased knowledge\n) = exp(.19)/[1 ? exp(.19)] = .55 and for non-racially biased knowledge\nas P(mismatch) = exp(b0\nE. Havekes et al.\n(reference). Self-reported housing discrimination was measured by three items.8\nRespondents answered ``yes'' or ``no'' to the following questions: (1) whether or not\nthey ever felt they were denied housing by a landlord or real estate agent because of\ntheir race/ethnicity, (2) whether or not they ever felt that a real estate agent was\nshowing them only homes in certain neighborhoods because of their race/ethnicity,9\nand (3) whether or not respondents ever lived in a neighborhood where neighbors\nmade life difficult because of their race/ethnicity. We combined these items into a\nsummary scale of self-reported housing discrimination, running from 0 (did not\nexperience any of these) to 3 (experienced all three).\nTable 6 shows that blacks in the lowest income category (i.e., \\$20,000) are\nmore likely to reside in a neighborhood with more co-ethnics than in the average\nneighborhood in which they searched for housing. This finding suggests that black\nresidents with low incomes may search in neighborhoods similar to their racial\npreferences but be unable to afford those neighborhoods, a finding that supports the\npredictions of the spatial assimilation model.\nConclusion and Discussion\nPast research has examined the association between preferences for particular racial\nand ethnic neighborhood compositions, and the composition of the current\nneighborhood. In this paper, we draw on novel data that allow us to provide a\npreliminary look at how an important intermediate step--the search for housing--\ninfluences these relationships. Overall, our results draw attention to the value of\nexamining the search process that precedes the final choice when studying the\nTable 6 Logistic regression analysis of the probability that blacks (n = 114) and Latinos (n = 145)\nreside in a neighborhood with more own group than in the average search location (model 3); logit\ncoefficients and standard error (SE)\nBlacks Latinos\nCoefficient SE Coefficient SE\n8 Self-reported housing discrimination is an imperfect measure of actual discrimination in the housing\nmarket. Yet, in the absence of data on actual discrimination practices, we consider it a reasonable proxy.\n9 If respondents never used a real estate agent we considered them as not having experienced\ndiscrimination on this item.\nRealizing Racial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences?...\ncorrespondence between residential preferences and behaviors in particular, but also\nas an important component to the perpetuation of racial residential segregation.\nIn line with earlier research that focused only on the differences between\nresidential preferences and current neighborhood racial/ethnic composition without\ninformation on the search itself (e.g., Adelman 2005; Clark 1992), we found that\nresidents generally live in neighborhoods with a larger percentage of their own\nracial/ethnic group than they report preferring. Yet, our study goes beyond these\nearlier ones because we find interesting racial and ethnic differences in the stage at\nwhich these disparities arise, thus emphasizing the value of studying the search\nprocess in relation to residential attainment. Our results suggest that whites\nexperience a mismatch between preferences and behavior at an early stage of the\nresidential process: they generally do not search in neighborhoods that match their\npreferences. In contrast, blacks--and to a lesser extent Latinos--are more likely to\nsearch in neighborhoods that more closely correspond to their preferences in terms\nof their own racial and ethnic group, but when it comes to where they actually live,\ntheir neighborhoods have larger percentages of blacks and Latinos, respectively.\nThe greater degree of match for blacks and Latinos in their search locations and\npreferences suggests that the explanation for the mismatch between where they\nprefer and where they actually live should be sought in constraints that prevent the\nfinal choice from being the one that matches residential preferences rather than in\nthe choice of search destinations in the first place.\nAlthough our data limit the extent to which we can test a range of theoretical\nexplanations for mismatches at an individual level, our analyses does point to some\nhints about the sources of the mismatches we observe. For whites, we find that the\nracial blind spots that Krysan and Bader (2009) identified--such that whites are less\nlikely to be aware of racially diverse neighborhoods--may play a role in the\nmismatch. That is, white Chicago residents with bigger racial blind spots were the\nsignificantly more likely to search in communities that had more whites than they\nsaid they prefer. Although education did not predict mismatches, which would have\nbeen consistent with a social desirability interpretation, this is a rather weak test.\nThus, we suggest that it is still possible that the mismatch for whites at Stage 1 is\ndue in part to whites not being as open to integrated neighborhoods as they say they\nare. Influenced by social desirability, it may be that whites report a preference for\nintegrated neighborhoods when in fact they favor predominantly white neighbor-\nhoods, contributing to a discrepancy between preferences and residential behaviors.\nThat whites do not search in neighborhoods that match their reported preferences is\nconsistent with this interpretation.\nHowever, there are other possibilities apart from social desirability.10 For\nexample, it could be that the relative availability of neighborhoods in the\nmetropolitan area that approximate whites' racial and ethnic preferences is\nunfavorable. Whites say they prefer a rather diverse neighborhood as long as\nwhites constitute the largest racial/ethnic group. Although these diverse neighbor-\nhoods are overrepresented on the search location map (see Table 1), which would\nimply we overestimate the chances that there will be a match, we see that whites end\n10 We gratefully acknowledge the anonymous reviewer who pointed out these alternative explanations.\nE. Havekes et al.\nup living in predominantly white neighborhoods. So, relatively rare as they are, our\nmaps actually increased the possibility for a match between whites' ideal diverse\nneighborhoods and being able to report on our maps that they searched in one.\nNevertheless, whites (in contrast to blacks and Latinos) live in the most ``available''\ntype of neighborhoods, i.e., predominantly white neighborhoods. This means that\nthe relative availability of neighborhoods could play a role in the mismatch we\nfound.\nFurthermore, it may be that people tend to start searching close by their current\nresidence (wherever that might be). If this is the case, and in light of patterns of\nsegregation, for whites, these `nearby' neighborhoods are more likely to be white\nneighborhoods as well (whereas for blacks and Latinos there is a greater chance that\nthe nearby neighborhoods are more diverse). This spatial dynamic of searches\ntherefore precludes more diversity in whites' search locations. Additionally, it may\nbe that the `daily routines' of whites may be particularly circumscribed, translating\ninto less exposure to diverse neighborhoods and therefore, a lower likelihood that\nthere is sufficient knowledge to seriously consider diverse neighborhoods as\nWith respect to the mismatches of blacks and Latinos, we find some suggestion\nof the role of spatial assimilation for blacks. That is, blacks with an income of less\nthan $20,000 are more likely to reside in a neighborhood with more blacks than in\ntheir search locations. These results also lend indirect support to the place\nstratification model, since the searches may have been unsuccessful due to\ndiscriminatory barriers that discouraged blacks and Latinos from residing in the\nmore integrated neighborhoods that they prefer. Although our self-reported measure\nof housing discrimination did not reveal significant findings, as we noted, we have\nno measure of actual discrimination experienced by the searchers.\nOur study draws attention to a number of directions for future research that put\nthe spotlight on the search process itself as critical to understanding residential\noutcomes. For example, all we know from our survey data is that a person searched\nin a particular neighborhood--we do not know what they learned about the\nneighborhood or what they experienced in it when they searched. It may be, for\nexample, that neighborhoods that are similar to whites' preferences for more\nintegrated neighborhoods come with race-related factors that stopped them from\neven searching in these neighborhoods. Indeed, some scholars have asked whether\npeople really have a preference for a particular racial and ethnic composition, or\nwhether these preferences are driven by socioeconomic concerns instead (Harris\n2001). Outcomes of vignette experiments indicate that part of the racial preference\npatterns found in studies using the show card method can be attributed to\nneighborhood concerns that are related to race, such as poverty, criminality, and bad\nand Bates 1990). Nevertheless, the racial and ethnic composition of neighborhoods\n11 This might imply an interaction between `general lack of knowledge' and ``composition of the\nneighborhoods about which the respondent claims little knowledge'' as a predictor of the mismatch\nbetween preferences and search locations. In separate analyses (not shown) we included this as a predictor\nbut it was not statistically significant. It may be that the small sample sizes are responsible for this null\nfinding.\nRealizing Racial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences?...\nremained an important and independent factor in shaping residential preferences. In\naddition, taking into account socioeconomic factors of the neighborhood, Crowder\nneighborhood composition is still an important determinant of whites' residential\nmobility. Understanding the manner by which whites determine where to search--\nand the role of race/ethnicity versus social class--is of great importance.\nOverall, in examining the racial and ethnic composition of neighborhoods in\nwhich people searched for housing, we seek to highlight the potential role that\nhousing searches play in contributing to the discrepancy between residential\npreferences and current neighborhood racial and ethnic composition, in particular.\nMore broadly, however, our goal is to bring systematic attention to the role of\nhousing searches to the residential attainment processes and their stratified\noutcomes. Our data have several limitations, but these suggestive results draw\nattention to the need to better understand the housing search process and call for the\nidentification of data collection and research design strategies that can address them\nand provide a more decisive answer to the broader theoretical frameworks that\nunderlie our analyses.\nIn interpreting our results, several of these shortcomings should be kept in mind.\nFirst, we used a non-random sample of 41 communities on our map of the Chicago\nmetropolitan area. For those who prefer white neighborhoods, the proportion of\nneighborhoods on the map that match their preferences is smaller than they in fact\nare. Similarly, for those who prefer racially and ethnically mixed neighborhoods,\nthe proportion of neighborhoods on the map is larger than they would encounter in\nChicago as a whole. It is hard to determine what consequences of imperfectly\nmeasuring the relative racial and ethnic distribution of neighborhoods has for our\nobserved mismatches. Yet, given that a majority of respondents say they prefer very\nmixed areas, we believe that it most likely reduced mismatches because respondents\nhad more opportunities among the 41 to choose their ideal (which many said was\nracially mixed).\nSecond, the use of cross-sectional data means that we cannot draw causal\ninferences. With respect to the correlate of mismatches, for example, we have\nmeasured income at the time of the survey, not at the time of the search; it is very\npossible that economic constraints were very different at the two times. In addition,\nwith respect to our key measures of interest, information on preferences and current\nneighborhood were measured at the same time, and information on respondents'\nsearches (though not their reporting of them) predated statements of preferences.\nBecause of this, we cannot rule out the possibility that residents adjusted their\npreferences based on their search experiences. Similarly, not only searches, but also\npeople's current neighborhood might have informed racial residential preferences as\nthey were measured simultaneously in time. This might have affected our results in\ntwo ways: it might have either underestimated mismatches in the case of people\nwho could not realize their initial preference but adjusted their attitudes to the\nsituation in the current neighborhood (or based on their search experiences) or\noverestimated mismatches for those residents who search or reside in a neighbor-\nhood that matched their original preferences but--for whatever reason--change\ntheir preferences.\nE. Havekes et al.\nThus, we clearly do not have the appropriate temporal order of preference,\nsearch, and move data. We ask respondents to indicate their current preferences,\nfully aware that their past searches and current residences might influence their\ncurrent racial preferences. Future research should prospectively investigate\nresidential preferences and where people move. Such a study is obviously\ncomplicated by the fact that the very nature of moving makes following respondents\ndifficult; the payoff, however, would be clear insight into an area potentially ripe for\nintervention--encouraging residents to search in neighborhoods with their stated\nlevel of diversity even if it is not on their initial list of search destinations.\nThis focus on housing searches not only has value in terms of social science\ndebates and understanding of the causes of residential segregation as well as\nneighborhood selection processes that relate to a range of `neighborhood effects'\nresearch, but also there are significant policy implications as well. Indeed, the U.S.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development recently issued a 5-year Research\nRoadmap (Office of Policy Development and Research 2013), citing one of HUD's\nfour programmatic goals to ``Build inclusive and sustainable communities free from\ndiscrimination.'' The Research Roadmap identified a number of top priority research\nprojects to accomplish this goal, including one that examined the housing search\nprocess of racial and ethnic minorities. Understanding this process was identified as\nfoundational for a number of core HUD programs and policies, including the\nHousing Choice Voucher program, housing integration strategies, and discrimina-\ntion testing and enforcement. As the Roadmap notes,\n...HUD does not know how households search for housing and what their\npreferences are when searching for housing. This research will shed light on\nhow housing search and preference affect HUD's fair housing/Affirmative\nFurthering Fair Housing goals and how they promote or deter goals to build\nOur research contributes to this policy debate, suggests next steps, and reinforces its\nimportance.\nThe present study is, therefore, a first step in pointing out the mismatch between\nstated preferences, search locations, and outcomes. The results compel future\nresearch to gather new large-scale longitudinal data in which residential preferences\nand complete housing search and neighborhood careers can be followed over time to\ntest our causal implications and to take into account the full set of possible\nresidential destinations. It is also important for future studies to link these housing\ncareers to information about individual socioeconomic resources, housing market\nknowledge and local discrimination to understand more thoroughly the relevance of\nthe housing search for interpreting spatial assimilation, place stratification, and\ninformation models. Using an innovative dataset that measured for the first time the\nsearch locations of residents of a major metropolitan area, we have drawn attention\nto the possibility of the mismatch between stated preferences, search locations, and\noutcomes in general, and the importance of examining more carefully the search\nprocess in particular if we hope to better understand the way in which racial\nresidential segregation is perpetuated--or the possibilities for helping to break it\ndown.\nRealizing Racial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences?...\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use,\ndistribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original\nauthor(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were\nmade.\nAppendix\nSee Table 7.\nReferences\nAdelman, R.
