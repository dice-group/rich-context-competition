The purpose of this\narticle is, first, to describe the analytical tools that fractal\nmodeling offers in the sociopolitical subject area and, sec-\nond, to examine the heuristic opportunities they bring. In\nparticular, we present results of the developed model's\napprobation as applied to the modernization of sociopolitical\ninstitutions.\nThe development of fractal models is part of the general\nmethodological trend aimed at the application of advances\nin synergetics, chaos theory (Alekseev et al., 2007;\n(Gharajedaghi, 2006) to the study of complex and dynamic\nsocial systems.\nFractal models of social phenomena are used in econom-\nics, and in studies of spatial dynamics (Cirnu, 2014; De\nFlorio, Bakhouya, Coronato, & Di Marzo, 2013; Tannier,\nVuidel, Houot, & Frankhauser, 2012; Triantakonstantis &\nMountrakis, 2012). Economic applications of fractal model-\ning may even be found in classical works on fractal geometry\n1982). A lot of fractal structures have been found in nature.\nIn addition, it has been found that the evolution of many sys-\ntems (including social systems) is fractal in nature, that is, a\npink noise. It is a self-similar process in which events of all\nsizes coincide: small bursts, average waves, tremendous tsu-\nnamis. The theory of self-organized criticality--the sibling\nof fractal geometry--offers a universal explanation of the\npink noise origin (Bak, 1996). It has been found that many\ndifferent processes have fractal characteristics (e.g., the elec-\ntrical activity of the human brain, freshets, changes in quasar\nbrightness, the dynamics of market prices, the intensity of\nsocial conflicts, the frequency of traffic jams). In theoretical\nand review papers (Andergassen, Nardini, & Ricottilli, 2006;\nRundle, 2002), numerous allegations can be found that social\nreality also has the characteristic of self-organized criticality.\nThere are researches specifically dedicated to fractal pink\nCastillo-Mussot, Ribeiro, Lenzi, & Mendes, 2014; Roberts\n1Tambov State University, Russia\nCorresponding Author:\nDmitry S.

For our\nanalysis, we chose the important social problem of transfor-\nmation of traditional informal institutions (TIIs). In their\npathological form, TIIs are regarded by researchers as the\nmain obstacle to social progress. This is a key idea in funda-\nanalytical summaries on this subject (Helmke & Levitsky,\nSeltser, 2009), and in practice-oriented expert recommenda-\nWe used fractal models to study quite a wide range of\nobjects--modernization of sociopolitical institutions, demo-\ngraphic strategies of the traditional society, human pressure\non the environment in history, evolution of territorial admin-\nistration in empires of the Modern period, and so forth (e.g.,\nLyamin, 2010). Fractal models are able to discover and simu-\nlate nonlinear effects that appear in social systems (Borodkin,\n2012). We believe, therein lies the heuristic value of this tool.\nThe building of fractal models and computer experiments\nwith them do not actually provide empirical facts at the his-\ntorian's, political scientist's, or sociologist's disposal. But\nmodels may be seen as a \"heuristic machine\" of its own kind\nthat helps formulate hypotheses and discovers potentials and\nShinn, 2006). Russell Ackoff viewed virtual experiments\nwith models as a substitute for the real ones that are near\nimpossible to be carried out with regard to social objects:\nIn a sense the researcher into the operations of many social\nsystems is in a situation similar to that of the early astronomers;\nthe system they studied also seemed to be infinitely complex and\nyet incapable of being subjected to experimentation. However,\nastronomers eventually developed mathematical representations\n(models) of the systems, and analyzed or conducted experiments\nWhy Are Fractal Geometry Tools\nApplicable for Simulating Real Social\nSystems?\nFractal geometry emerged after Benois Mandelbrot's book\nLes Objets Fractals: Forme, Hasard et Dimension, which\nwas published in 1975. The revised version of the mono-\ngraph, \"The Fractal Geometry of Nature,\" is now a seminal\nwork on fractal geometry. A fractal is defined as a special\ntype of geometric figure, and the adjective \"fractal\" is the\ncharacteristic of a structure, phenomenon, or process pos-\nsessing properties of the fractal. Mandelbrot (1982) himself\ndefined fractal as a structure whose parts \"in some sense\" are\nlike the whole. Therefore, one of the fractal's attributes is\nself-similarity (scale invariance): Whichever approximation\nwe look at the fractal, we always see the same or, in any case,\nsomething similar. In Figure 1, some scales of the Sierpinski\nSieve fractal (Mandelbrot, 1982) are presented to illustrate\nthe scale invariance.\nFractal's self-similarity may be nonabsolute. Figure 2\ndemonstrates fragments of the best known fractal--the\nMandelbrot (1982) set. In this case, the self-similarity is\ntransformed at different scales, but at every level of com-\nplexity (at every scale), there appears a fusion of the indi-\nvidual characteristics of an element and the general ones of\nthe whole system.\nMandelbrot (1982) suggested that in nature, a fractal way\nof self-organization was essential, because algorithms of\nfractal building had a relatively simple \"genetic code\" (a\nbasic principle of building), yet at the same time they could\nproduce supercomplex objects or processes.\nSubsequent to natural sciences, principles and tools of frac-\ntal geometry are mastered in humanities. In the monograph\n\"Fractals, Graphics and Mathematical Education,\" Mandelbrot\nquite remarkably, reflects on history and fractal geometry:\nLet me at this point confess to you the envy I experienced as a\nyoung man, when watching the hold on minds that is the\nprivilege of psychology and sociology, and of my youthful\ndreams of seeing some part of hard science somehow succeed in\nachieving a similar hold. Until a few decades ago, the nature of\nscience made this an idle dream. Human beings (not all, to be\nsure, but enough of them) view history, psychology, and\nsociology as alive . . . Astronomy is not viewed as alive; the Sun\nand the Moon are superhuman because of their regularity,\ntherefore gods. [ . . . ] In recent years the sharp contrast between\nastronomy and history has collapsed. We witness the coming\ntogether, not of a new species of science; nor even (to continue\nin taxonomic terms) a new genus or family, but a much more\nprofound change. [ . . . ] It is only since the 1960s that the study\nof true disorder and complexity has come onto the scene. Two\nkey words are chaos and fractals, but I shall keep to fractals.\nAgain and again my work has revealed cases where simplicity\nbreeds a complication that seems incredibly lifelike. [ . . . ]\nAstronomy described simple rules and simple effects, while\nhistory described complicated rules and complicated effects.\nFractal geometry has revealed simple rules and complicated\nFractal models allow the discovery of patterns and strict\nordering in such systems where, seemingly, absolute chaos\nof multidirectional human aspirations and diverse empirical\nfacts dominate. The consistency of the basic pattern does not\ncontradict the diversity of facts under study. Fractal geome-\ntry unites them, but at the same time it does not lay them\ndown to the Procrustean bed of simple schemes.\nThe most \"ancient\" type of fractals is geometrical frac-\ntals. They are a convenient heuristic metaphor for describing\nself-similar social and political structures, as well as logics\nof their development. Geometrical fractals are figures that\nemerge as a result of repetition of one and the same graphic\nZhukov and Lyamin 3\nelement (a so-called \"fractal generator\") for an infinite num-\nber of times at a constantly reducing scale. Examples of such\nfigures are the Sierpinski Sieve (Figure 1) or the Koch\nFractals of another type--algebraic--emerge in a com-\nplex numbers space as a result of iterations of a particular\nformula. Algebraic fractal building may be seen as a study of\nthe system's behavior in the phase space. That is the princi-\nple implemented in General Fractal Model of Transit\nHow GFMT and Modernofractal 5.1\nFractal-Builder Work\nFor the purposes of computer modeling in social and politi-\ncal disciplines, we offered the GFMT. The mathematical\napparatus of the model is based on procedures described by\nMandelbrot (1982). These classical methods were modified\nto solve issues of simulating specific studied objects. The\nGFMT is a mathematical and logic matrix of a class of theo-\nries, which describe transformation, transition of social\nsystems from one state to another. Here, we demonstrated the\nGFMT application to studying problems of institutional\nmodernization, but there are also successful outcomes from\nusing the model for other processes-related research.\nIn GFMT, various states of the system in any moment are\ndepicted by means of an image point (complex number Z) in\nthe two-dimensional phase space. This point's position cor-\nresponds to values of key system characteristics plotted\nalong phase space axes. State transition (transformation) of\nthe system at any time is represented by the sequence of\npoints--namely a certain trajectory in the phase space.\nTo conduct computer experiments with GFMT, Julia\nMovchko designed the Modernofractal 5.1 computer pro-\ngram that performs algebraic fractal-building procedures.1\nFractal geometry reveals the mechanisms by which com-\nplex and diverse structures can be generated on the basis of\nvery simple rules. The same is true of software that models\nreal processes. The fractal generating programs are mostly\nrather simple. They use very simple algorithms--repetition\nof basic computational operations. Because of this, there are\na lot of fractal generators, but none of them is quite a\nFigure 1. The Sierpinski Sieve.\nFigure 2. The Mandelbrot set.\nFigure 3. Initial stages of building the Koch Snowflake.\n4 SAGE Open\nversatile enough program for modeling. Therefore, we\nneeded a special program that could resolve the specific\nresearch problem.\nThe mathematical apparatus of the model contains an iter-\nated formula (1) and two mathematical conditions (the so-\ncalled -symmetry rule, -symmetry rule), that allow us to\nequate the geometrical sense of complex numbers operations\nwith the results of nuclear interactions of a model's factors.\nn n\n+\n= +\nwhere A is a real number, Z (d\nzn\n; k\nzn\n) and  (d\nc\n; k\nc\n) are com-\nplex numbers.\nThe iterated formula generates a sequence of numbers that\nare taken as coordinates and, therefore, set an image point\ntrajectory in the complex plane (the very same, two-dimen-\nsional phase space of the model).\nWhy and how can iteration simulate the evolution of the\nsocial system? Let us compare the iterative process in a frac-\ntal model with procedures of agent-based modeling. There\nare similarities and differences.\nIn agent-based modeling, individual agents interact with\neach other, guided by simple rules and conditions. The result is\na new, complex, and sometimes paradoxical behavior of the\nwhole artificial society--the entire set of agents. Thus, the\nagents' basic interactions at the microlevel generate system\nmicrodynamics.\nIn fractal modeling, the system is not broken down into\nindividual components or agents; rather, it is the system's\nwhole dynamics that are broken down into individual situa-\ntions. Each situation is a short-term and basic change of the\nwhole system under the influence of controlling factors. The\nformula (1) governs the interaction of controlling factors and\ntheir influence upon the system in the simplest situation.\nEach change in the system is manifested in the iteration. The\nposition of the image point in the phase space changes as a\nresult of the iteration. A series of iterations simulates a series\nof changes. During a single iteration or a small number of\niterations, the system's behavior tends to be very simple.\nHowever, the set of iterations can create a nontrivial trajec-\ntory. Thus, the elementary behavior of the system in short\nperiods of time generates a long-term system dynamics.\nA researcher has the opportunity to observe point trajecto-\nries tracing starting points (creation states of the system) and\nfinishing stable points (if any)--attractors of the system evolu-\ntion. The fractal-builder computer program can, therefore, gen-\nerate images of system attractors (we will call them\n\"perspectives'space\" for our purposes) and basins (\"potentials'\nspace\"). If we consider the complex plane as a two-dimensional\nphase space, the movement of the image point may be identi-\nfied as the system evolution. The basins (the whole complex of\nstarting points from which the system gets into one or another\nattractor) highlight possibilities for evolution. Attractors shed\nlight on the most likely and comfortable outcomes of the sys-\ntem development under the influence of model factors.\nThe attractor is heuristically a very productive concept of\nsynergetics. Configuration of each specific trajectory may\ndepend on many fluctuations, but it does not eliminate the\nfinal outcome and does not change the attractor's \"location.\"\nHowever, the system may have several attractors, and the\nchoice between them is made in a bifurcation point and may\nbe dependent on fluctuations. After passing a bifurcation\npoint, only a correction of the attractor-approaching trajec-\ntory may take place within the system, not the choice of the\nattractor itself; in the attractor the system stabilizes.\nDiscovering attractors allows us to effectively forecast the\nfuture of the object of study, because eventually specific tra-\njectories (viz., any future scenarios) demonstrate a distinct\nconvergence to the attractor.\nIn many cases, the choice of the attractor depends heavily\non initial conditions, that is, the system's starting positions.\nEvery attractor corresponds to a certain area of initial states/\npoints, starting from which a system (if it \"depends on initial\nconditions\") will definitely come to this attractor. As a meta-\nphor for such phenomena, we can use a river's basin.\nQuite often the images of basins and, less frequently, those of\nattractors, generated in the way mentioned above, are fractals.\nThe quadratic model simulates the effect of a factor on\nitself. This allows consideration of the presence of feedback\nloops in the system. It is known that the presence of such\nloops is a necessary condition for the model to demonstrate\nsome nonlinear effects. This is well illustrated in the agent-\nbased (Schelling, 2006) and system-dynamic (Meadows,\n2008) modeling. Therefore, if we want to teach the model to\nsimulate nonlinear effects, the most direct way to do this is to\nput into the model one or more feedback loops.\nHowever, there are more fundamental considerations\nforcing us to use the quadratic model to simulate the devel-\nopment of social systems in particular. Among other things,\nthe system dynamics depends on its properties. A key feature\nof any social system is reflexivity. Self-reflection, reflection\nof its own state, is the attribute of the individual conscious-\nness as well as collective social phenomena. Our individual\nand group ideas and behavioral strategies are under the direct\nand strong influence of reflection on our current and past\nstates. Reflexivity is realized in a vast number of feedback\nloops in society and, of course, in our minds. Reflexivity\nrequires considering the social system as a control factor for\nthe reconstruction of the social-system dynamics. The easiest\nway to do this is to use the quadratic model.\nAccording to the models' conditions, different areas of the\nphase space may have a qualitative meaning. In GFMT, a sys-\ntem is regarded in the context of transition from one ideal state\n(zero pole) to another (infinity pole). As applied to real sys-\ntems, in most cases this transition starts, continues, and finishes\nsomewhere between these two poles (see Figure 1). An image\npoint in the considered plate may be represented as a certain\nqualitative state of the system that emerged from a combination\nof particular values of two key system characteristics--H\nx\nand\nH\ny\n. The conventional border of the GFMT working space is a\nZhukov and Lyamin 5\nsquare (Figure 4). Each of the two characteristics (generally\nspeaking) has two gradations: weak (from 0 to 1, from 0 to -1)\nand strong (from 1 to 2, from -1 to -2). These gradations may\nbe treated as two essentially (qualitatively) different ranges of\nthe respective characteristics. The combination of two grada-\ntions of two characteristics provides four types of system states,\nconditionally designated as , , ,  ()--Figure 4.\nModernofractal 5.1 generates images of attractors and\nbasins (fractal ones, as a rule) of the studied system depend-\ning on governing factors--Figure 5.\nThe user sets values of , d\nc\n, and k\nc\n(i.e., force of governing\nfactors) as constants; the user also pinpoints the direction of\nhow d\nc\nand k\nc\nfactors influence the system (this may be inward\nor outward directed--to the zero point or to the periphery, at\ninfinity). In compliance with the preset mesh step, the program\ntests a set of complex plane points in the TOMH area or in any\nother area that is defined by the user at random. Coordinates of\neach tested point are carried to the iterated formula as a Z\ninitial value. Furthermore, the program performs a number of\niterations, defined by the user, and analyzes the final outcome.\nGenerally, 300 to 400 iterations are sufficient to establish\nwhether a generated numerical sequence ends at infinity or\ntends to a certain attractor in some space (in the TOMH area).\n-symmetry rule enforces that in each iteration, signs\nbefore d\nc\nand k\nc\nare marked not depending on signs obtained\nin the previous iteration, but depending on the user's settings\nand signs before parts of the complex number F (d\nf\n; k\nf\n) in the\ncurrent iteration (Table 1).\nA-symmetry rule simulates the use in calculations of the\nequal amount of negative and positive A-values taken in ran-\ndom order, that lead to the distribution of attractors symmet-\nrically about all axes. This rule may be applied by the user if\nthere is a qualitative sense of A irrespective of a sign.\nDue to A- and C-symmetry rules, the imagery is symmet-\nrical about the x- and y-axes. That is why a qualitative mean-\ning of imagery is enclosed in any one quarter of the working\nspace limited by semiaxes.\nWhat Qualitative Senses Could Be\nCorrelated With GFMT Elements?\nGFMT is designed for simulating and forecasting real social\nprocesses. But the ability to simulate, as a minimum, sug-\ngests certain qualitative senses of a model's procedures and\nmathematical apparatus. How does transition (or nontransi-\ntion) of the system from one state to another actually take\nplace in GFMT scenarios? Or, if we ask this question another\nway--why does GFMT describe various transformations of\ndifferent systems with only one mathematical and logical\nstructure of representation? What are the common qualita-\ntive senses for different systems that underlie the mathemati-\ncal apparatus of the model?\nA social system's transition from one state to another\noccurs under the influence of the three multicomponent\nfactors: Zn\n2 , system's self-development; A, system's envi-\nronmental resistance/irresistance; and C, impact of the\nenvironment.\nAny system tends to reproduce itself, to save itself, to\nsecure its identity as a minimum and strengthen its key char-\nacteristics as a maximum, and so forth. Under the impact of\nsuch inner intension for self-development, social structures\ntend not to move rectilinearly and uniformly. And, it is the\noperation of squaring a complex number Z\nn\nthat definitely\nreflects this attribute of social systems. First, inner factors of\nthe system's self-reproduction and self-protection may lead\nthe process of transition to empirically described \"turbu-\nlences\" (rollbacks, jerks, slips, etc.)--multiple nonlinear\neffects so common in real life. Second, the closer a system is\nto \"poles\" (ideal states), the stronger its intention is to\nstrengthen key characteristics.\nIn GFMT, a user sets the full range of environmental\nimpacts on the system by means of two constants--parts of\nthe complex number  (d\nc\n; k\nc\n). They are two generalized\ngroups of \"external impulses.\" Each of them is in effect pre-\ndominantly along the respective axis, that is to say, each of\nthem makes an impact on one of the key characteristics. But\nusing complex numbers in calculations leads to paradoxical\noutcomes. External influences may both encourage the\nstrengthening of a given characteristic as well as its weaken-\ning. That is the reason why a user is allowed not only to set a\nd\nc\nand k\nc\nvalue (\"force\") but also for direction (\"inward\" or\n\"outward\"). We can easily speculate on directions of external\nfactors' influence (as though we are in a one-dimensional\nworld) because we only deal with the theory of transition\nfrom one state to another. And, it is the very paradigm of\ntransition studies that makes us establish a clear transition\ndirection--forward or backward (a third is not given).\nFigure 4. GFMT phase space marking.\nNote. GFMT = General Fractal Model of Transit.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe -factor is an inner factor of the system closely\nrelated with the character of its interactions with the envi-\nronment. This factor weakens or strengthens the ability of\nthe system for self-development following its internal\nlogic. This factor makes the system more or less stable\ntoward the environment. To provide linearity of its impact,\nthe A-factor is introduced as a real number. As  (d\nc\n; k\nc\n),\nthe A-factor may be treated as a generalized combination of\nfactors.\nBecause complex numbers are used for building algebraic\nfractals, questions arise: What is the \"ontological\" status of\ncomplex numbers in social studies, and what kind of social\nand political phenomena can be described by means of com-\nplex numbers? Our proposal is to correlate real and imagi-\nnary parts of a complex number with some binary notions a\nsystem is characterized with. These may be contradictory or,\nconversely, complementary notions. Discovering two basic\nsystem characteristics, which are two parts of its dialectical\ndevelopment, is quite a routine method for studying systems.\nThe GFMT-applied mathematical apparatus allows us to\nsimulate a system's behavior exactly as dynamics of a cor-\nrelation between two basic characteristics--H\n\nand H\n\n.\nBut why are there two characteristics? Why is correlation\nbetween them crucial? Why may a system's trajectory/evolu-\ntion in such coordinates be considered a tool to study differ-\nent (and sometimes quite dissimilar) social systems at all?\nAn application of a four-part marking-out of the phase space\nin GFMT (Figure 4) is a widespread practice. It is heuristi-\ncally productive, because the phase space marked out this\nway may be considered a visualization of a two-dimensional\n(based on two criteria) typology.\nA good survey of this toolkit is presented by Russell\nAckoff's student and disciple, Jamshid Gharajedaghi (2006),\nin System Thinking: Managing Chaos and Complexity.\nGharajedaghi suggests taking several system characteristics\nin aggregate, moreover, in inseparable aggregate:\nThe principle of multidimensionality maintains that the opposing\ntendencies not only coexist and interact, but also form a\nTechnologically it is easier to work with the two-phase\nspace, where each characteristic is represented by a single\ndimension. In this dimension, each characteristic may be\n\"strong\" or \"weak\" (or, for example, \"low\" or \"high\"). This\nprocedure allows us (in a first, rough approximation) to dis-\ntinguish four types of systems (or their states):\n[This results] in a multidimensional scheme where a low/low\nand a high/high, in addition to low/high and high/low, are strong\npossibilities. This is a non-zero-sum formulation, in which a loss\nFigure 5.

On the\ncontrary, both opposing tendencies can increase or decrease\nsimultaneously. Using a multidimensional representation, one\ncan see how the tendencies previously considered as dichotomies\ncan interact and be integrated into something quite new. [ . . . ]\nIn this context, the point of distinction between low and high is\nnot arbitrary. It signifies the level at which the behavior of the\ndependent system is qualitatively affected. (Gharajedaghi, 2006,\nA point mentioned by Gharajedaghi (2006) is the so-called\n\"unit line\" in GFMT (Figure 4, red line), that may be consid-\nered as a border between two (along each axis) qualitatively\ndifferent values of a respective characteristic. Such a feature\nof the unit line is determined by the very point of GFMT,\nintended to trace qualitative transitions in the process of sys-\ntem evolution. As an example, here we demonstrate markings\nused in our two recent research projects for studying demo-\ngraphic strategies and interactions of traditional (pre-indus-\ntrial) society with the environment (Figures 6 and 7).\nIn a GFMT space marked \"by default,\" other various\nadditional geometric constructions may be added--for\nexample, a homeostasis line along which basic system\nparameters are balanced, and so forth. This makes the model\nheuristically productive, because the image point moves (the\nsystem evolves) through space endowed with a number of\ncomplex qualitative meanings. There are known cases when\nmethods of studying system trajectories in the phase space\nwere successfully applied in researching not only physical\nbut also social phenomena. But how are these trajectories\ngenerated? We suppose that procedures of algebraic fractal\nbuild-up allow simulation of various social evolutions,\nmainly their initial and end points.\nAs we found, GFMT may be applied for simulation of a\nbroad range of social phenomena with typical phase\ntransitions, a disproportion of causes and consequences, and\nother counter-intuitive effects classic linear models cannot\ngrasp. Of course, it matters whether the development of these\nphenomena may be simulated by formula (1) iteration. This\noperation simulates interaction of several governing factors,\nand moreover, these factors in their abstract formulation may\nbe considered to be the most significant for many social sys-\ntems. This fact, as well as the simplicity of the formula cou-\npled with the great variety and complexity of results it\nproduces, makes the model completely functional. GFMT\nmay be \"tuned,\" made more specific for studying different\nobjects. To do so, one should just redefine the characteristics,\nthe governing factors, and make a new phase space marking.\nWhat Phenomena Can We Observe\nin GFMT and How Can We Interpret\nThem?\nAny model results should be, as a minimum, interpretable.\nThe qualitative interpretation of images produced by GFMT\ndepends on both the character of these images and the state-\nment of initial conditions: Exactly what kind of physical\n(qualitative) meanings are attributed to the basic characteris-\ntics and governing factors of the model, and how different\nareas of TOMH working space are marked. Methods of qual-\nitative interpretation of the resulting images are based on an\nanalysis of the image point's movement through \"marked\"\nphase space, with different areas and additional construc-\ntions within the latter having their respective physical\nmeanings.\nIn GFMT, main objects and events of the chaos theory are\ngenerated. We shall consider possible interpretations of sev-\neral (by no means all) events in the GFMT space without\nreference to a specific subject.\nFigure 6. Types of demographic strategies of traditional (pre-industrial) society: An example of GFMT space marking.\nNote. GFMT = General Fractal Model of Transit.\n8 SAGE Open\nIf the simulating process has an attractor in visible range\nand not in eternity, the point trajectory, as a rule, has a shape\nof an intertwined spiral. Such a trajectory signifies damped\noscillation processes. It has a profound meaning with regard\nto social and political systems, because such mechanisms\nare instruments to achieve homeostasis and, besides, are\noften a part of open \"reactive\" systems, developing in a\nseries of calls and responses (and counter-responses) to\nthem. Homeostasis maintenance suggests not only the freez-\ning of certain system parameters (in such a case it would\nlose its ability to respond to external calls, that is, its adapta-\ntion potential disappearing). In practice, homeostasis main-\ntenance means several oscillations around system optima.\nThese oscillations allow the system to find, by trial and\nerror, the best parameters. In this case, homeostasis is not a\nproduct of the processes' stopping, but an outcome of the\ndynamic balance of multidirectional processes. The latter\ncreates significant advantages if the system comes out of the\nhomeostatic condition under the influence of external\nimpulses, because it leaves possibilities for system\nself-development.\nAnother most important event in the model is a dispropor-\ntion of causes and consequences. A minor change of one fac-\ntor may cause a qualitative adjustment of attractors' and\nbasins' outlines. Of course, these macro-consequences of\nmicro-causes are not always possible, only under a certain\ncombination of factors. A reverse situation may also occur:\nIn some cases, major changes of governing factors have few\nor no effect on outcomes.\nIn GFMT, a phase transition occurs as an \"explosion of\nattractors.\" For illustrative purposes, we present images from\na series of experiments carried out for a research project on\ndemographic strategies of traditional society (Figure 8;\nZhukov et al., 2013a). Initially concentrated in one point,\nattractors fly apart to form several groups--they \"explode\"\nand leave a \"shell.\" After the first \"explosion,\" one can see a\nnew \"secondary\" system stabilization, when attractors,\nthough not in one point as before, nevertheless form a com-\npact cloud. This means that separate social communities\nretain a certain degree of \"social fate\" commonality and\nevolve together in some way. However, if governing factors\nkeep on changing in a definite way, the second \"explosion\"\nhappens, and so forth. Eventually, a series of \"explosions\"\nleads to a slide toward true chaos (attractors and basins dis-\nappear from the working area).\nOnly within the last two decades has the idea of phase\ntransitions being extremely widespread in history been estab-\nlished in social sciences. Overnight \"loyal advocates\" can\nturn into \"blood-thirsty Jacobins,\" \"monarch-loving peas-\nants\" into \"regicides,\" and \"communist leaders\" into \"bank-\ners.\" An inexperienced observer may conclude that all these\nsocial and political metamorphoses are so radical and fast\nmoving that they are undoubtedly caused by supernatural\nforces or inspired by influence agents from abroad. That is\nwrong. Phase transitions are quite common phenomena even\nin daily life.\nDiversification, distinction, and sophistication of differ-\nent attractors'basin contours may be interpreted as increased\nvarieties of the system's ways of development, the emer-\ngence of situations of social choice. Such a diversification\ngenerates complementarity of social elements in the first\ninstance, and then a collapse, if it deepens pathologically. On\nthe threshold of chaos--after a second or third \"explosion\"--\neven a very insignificant change in initial conditions can\nFigure 7. Types of traditional (pre-industrial) society's strategies of interaction with the environment: An example of GFMT space\nmarking.\nNote. GFMT = General Fractal Model of Transit.\nZhukov and Lyamin 9\ntrigger the attractor's change. In real life, this means that\nevery decision becomes crucial for further development.\nAttractors do not just deconsolidate and diffuse, but \"fly\napart\" to typologically distinct areas of the phase space. In\nsuch a situation, a coexistence of institutions with markedly\ndifferent prospects takes place. System development is\npoorly predicted in this case. A community cannot exist fol-\nlowing this pattern for long.\n\"Explosions\" are accompanied by a narrowing of the\n\"space of survival\" (sum of all attractors), because in this\ncase, a system sometimes cannot get into an attractor lying\nwithin a physically possible range. In other words, condi-\ntions emerge that push a system into infinity. After each\n\"explosion of attractors,\" the visible attractors keep on exist-\ning within an even narrower range of governing factors.\nThis is quite typical for understanding the modernization\ncommon for historical and political science studies, where it\nsupposes acceleration of development rates, an increase in\ncatastrophe risks, and an essential expansion of possible\nprospects. We assume that all modernized contemporary\nsocieties may be considered as ones of \"secondary stability.\"\nHomeostasis of a modernized society is based on the balance\nof fast processes and the balance of strong factors. Such bal-\nances need to be fine-tuned and are more sensitive to minor\nalterations in environmental conditions. Modernization insti-\ntutions are solid within a narrow range of governing factors,\nbecause they are more fragile. On the contrary, traditional\nsociety is based on slow processes and maintains homeosta-\nsis due to the conservation of processes and the reduction of\nfactors.\nHow Can Models of Particular Social\nSystems Be Created on the Basis of\nGFMT and How Can One Experiment\nWith These Models?\nWe would like to demonstrate the GFMT heuristic potential\nin research practice, namely, in studies of social and political\ninstitutions' modernization. We can create a model of the\nparticular object--rapid institutional modernization--on the\nbasis of the abstract GFMT. We call it \"Modernofractal.\" But\nfirst of all, we should formulate the initial conditions by\ndescribing the research situation.\nIt is known that spontaneous (natural, organic) modern-\nization is now impossible--it is consigned to history. Possible\nformats for modernization are partial (in post-colonial coun-\ntries) or rapid (in countries of catching-up development or, in\nother words, \"of second echelon,\" e.g., BRICS--Brazil,\nRussia, India, China, South Africa). We are concerned with\nforced modernization--a process enhanced and accelerated\nby impulses from a certain interior modernization driver.\nInstitutions are the key phenomenon in many social theo-\nries. Douglas North, an institutionalism theoretician, under-\nstood institutions, among other things, as a body of rules for\nhuman conduct (\"game rules\"; North, 1990). Institutions may\nbe formal and informal, modernized and traditional.\nModernization must be accompanied by the growing formal-\nization of rules and mechanisms of social and political inter-\naction. The reverse process, deformalization of rules, is\ngenerally a social malady in reality (Merkel & Croissant,\n2000). The term \"traditional informal institution\" is applied to\nFigure 8. \"Explosion of attractors,\" example.\nthe enormous number of phenomena, which are mostly highly\nnegative--personal ties networks and corruption, clientelism,\npaternalism, clans and mafia, nepotism, and so forth (Helmke\n& Levitsky, 2004). It is known that in the process of rapid\nmodernization TIIs continue to exist for various reasons, as a\nrule, related to the high speed of modernization transforma-\ntions. We shall focus our attention primarily on the correlation\nand interaction between TIIs and modernized formal ones\n(such as public law and the State administration).\nBy means of Modernofractal we carried out 19 series of\nexperiments. Here, we could imagine (very generally) the\nfinal results.\nTo formalize initial data, we used indicators calculated\non the basis of expert evaluations. Therefore, in this study,\nmodeling should be considered solely as a means to produce\nhypotheses, to create a number of possible prospects. It was\nimportant for us, because along with historical content, the\n\"Modernofractal\" project incorporated a political research\ncomponent. Within this component, the issues we addressed\nwere an analysis of alternative scenarios and a forecasting of\ncertain outcomes of various hypothetical controlling actions.\nWe used data on Russia, but at a high level of abstraction,\nRussian processes are very similar to those in other coun-\ntries of catching-up development.\nIn Modernofractal, standard scaling and calibration meth-\nods were applied. A model was verified by comparing the\noutcomes of computer experiments with values of governing\nfactors and the final results of the studied processes known\nfrom historical sources and academic literature.\nModernofractal phase space marking for simulating insti-\ntutional dynamics is a remarkably modified typology of\ninstitutions, offered by Helmke and Levitsky (2004; Table 2,\nFigures 9 and 10). The essence of this modification is an\nassumption that ineffectiveness of formal institutions\nincreases in a direct ratio to the distinction in prominent\ncharacteristics between formal and informal institutions in a\npeculiar social milieu.\nWe offer the following meanings for governing factors: Z2\nis an intention of the system (institution) for self-develop-\nment. Impulse  (d\nc\n; k\nc\n) signifies external impact on the sys-\ntem: d\nc\n--modernizing or traditionalizing activity of the State\nas a key creator and reformer of institutions; k\nc\n--the degree a\nsystem is influenced by public consciousness (a sum of atti-\ntudes and active stands aimed to maintain the system in its\npresent form and/or its transformation toward modernization\nor traditionalization). The -factor designates objective\nmodernization/traditionalistic demands and opportunities\ninherent in the institution's social milieu.\nEssentially, the process of simulation modeling in GFMT\nconsists of three stages: formalization of sociohumanitarian\n(politological in this case) discourse, imaging of attractors\nand basins in the fractal builder, and interpretation of graphic\nand numerical results in sociohumanitarian qualitative terms,\nand comparison of these interpretations with known facts.\nLacking the possibility to present all the experiments carried\nout in the \"Modernofractal\" project, we mention (very briefly) a\nnumber of experiments from \"00 series.\" Here, we focus not on\ntheir substantial outcomes, but on the methods of their obtaining\nand on demonstration of outcome data interpretability.\nWhat are incoming data of a \"zero\" simulating situation?\nFirst, there is strong modernization pressure from the State\n(d\nc\n) upon a certain hypothetical institution (or a number of\ninstitutions). Second, a public consciousness attitude (k\nc\n)\ntoward transformation of the institute is not clearly expressed\nand may change significantly. Recent historical experience\nshows that whereas some social strata have high moderniza-\ntion expectations, the dominance of traditionalist thinking is\nevident among enormous masses of the population not will-\ning to adapt to the innovations associated with moderniza-\ntion. After all, these innovations often bring (as side effects)\nthe necessity to master new formal practices, gain more\nmodern knowledge of law and economics, and give up social\nparasitism in favor of social activism.\nThird, values of modernization opportunities and social\nmilieu demands (A-factor) used in the \"zero\" series may\nseem low at first sight (0.2-0.3 points on a scale 0-2). In the\nsimplest case, it could mean, for example, that moderniza-\ntion supporters represent 10% to 15% of the social milieu of\nthis institute. This is a not small number.\n(Figure 11). Attractors are far from the convergence line and\nclose to the competitive institutions area and to the pole of\nthe State ineffectiveness. Generally speaking, this situation\nmay be interpreted as an accentuation of an etatist and direc-\ntive character of modernization. This is a situation where\ninstitutions of accommodating type are substituted by those\nof a competitive type. It leads to the decline of the State\neffectiveness and to the open confrontation of formal and\ninformal institutions.\nTable 2.

In the meantime, if the State efforts for modern-\nization are the only driver of this process, they are canceled\nout by the counter-intuitive behavior of the social system.\nof a scenario where modernization efforts of the State are\nsupported by the public consciousness. The outcome is pos-\nitive: Attractors are steadily located in modernization areas\nnear the convergence line. This observation is easily inter-\npreted by itself. If some level of modernization of public\nconsciousness does not exist, external modernization\nimpact throws the actors out \"in a vacuum\": The old insti-\ntutional structure is deteriorated but not substituted with a\nnew one.\nnario where modernization opportunities dominate (high\nA-factor) and the State impact is traditionalistic. This is\nquite an artificial situation hardly imaginable in real con-\ntemporary life, but of course, history knows such examples.\nAt each level, we see a deeply dissected, polarized society\nwhere every unit has development prospects distinct from\nthose of the next unit and, in its turn, consists of different-\ntype parts.\nWhat Are the Results of the\nInstitutional Modernization Simulation?\nWe present some most interesting qualitative interpretations from\nthe series of experiments. Generally, nonlinear effects known\nfrom literature were verified (under a certain combination of\nFigure 10. Typology of institutions and GFMT space marking for institutional dynamics simulation, detailing.\nNote. GFMT = General Fractal Model of Transit.\nFigure 9. Typology of institutions and GFMT space marking for institutional dynamics simulation.\nNote. GFMT = General Fractal Model of Transit.\nfactors), and new effects and/or conditions of their origin were\ndiscovered. We used a metaphor \"turbulent\" rapid modernization\nto describe the whole complex of these effects.\nSuch a modernization is not uniform, it variously affects dif-\nferent institutions, strata, and spaces that should seem to lead to\ncontradictions or even clashes between them. The turbulent\nZhukov and Lyamin 13\nmodernization is characterized with phase transitions--leaps,\n\"breakthroughs\"--that may break the proportion of causes and\nconsequences. Leonid Borodkin (2005), a Russian specialist in\nsocial-system modeling, notes\nAccording to the [synergetic] paradigm, development is thought\nof as a sequence of long periods of the stable states of the system,\ninterrupted by short periods of chaotic behavior, after which a\ntransition to the next stable state (attractor) takes place. (p. 5)\nIn terms of institutionalism, a phase transition may be\ndescribed as follows: In the beginning, an institutional struc-\nture exists (game rules) with informal institutions inside it.\nThere is also consensus among actors regarding this structure,\nas well as some kind of equilibrium (this implies, among other\nmatters, a balance between actors' advantages from the exist-\ning structure and disadvantages from its collapse). At the same\ntime, a latent institutional structure exists (alternative, known-\nbut-not-used game rules) that does not include TIIs. But transi-\ntion to the new game rules, even though old ones are archaic\nand ineffective, faces at least two obstacles. First, actors are\nafraid to incur unacceptable costs as a result of abandoning the\nprevious equilibrium. Second, scattered attractors do not pos-\nsess the instruments to compromise on removing old game\nrules and accepting new ones. In many cases, tackling of these\ntwo obstacles does not need considerable resource spending\n(namely, it has a low-energy, \"weak\" impact on the system),\nbut it may have far-reaching implications.\nDuring modernization, archaic norms, social structures,\nand administrative and political institutions do not die off,\nbut adapt, accustom into new ones, both transforming mod-\nernization innovations and being transformed by them. This\nis how \"the sedimentary society\"2 emerges, where old \"game\nrules\" are conserved but not isolated. A sedimentary structure\n(or traditional institutional legacy), having lost its former\nfunctional role, obtains pathological forms. \"Communal con-\nsciousness\" justifies criminal clans. \"Mutual supportiveness\"\ngives rise to \"mutual cover-up,\" conspiracies of silence, and\nillegal relations between the State officials and the business\ncommunity. \"Patriarchalism\" creates nepotism, domestic\nviolence, and so forth. This is how an effect that may be\ncalled a \"ptomaine of traditionalism\" emerges.\n\"Backflows\" are inherent in turbulent modernization. In\nsome areas and institutions, which are not fully integrated\ninto modernization processes, there is an emergence of a kind\nof cyst that evolves in the opposite direction--toward archa-\nism. Under a number of favorable (nondiscriminatory) con-\nditions, these sectors grow intensively. The appearance of\npseudo-morphoses allows archaic institutions to be steadily\nembedded into modernized formal structures and substitute\nmodernized \"game rules\" (the essence of institutions) while\npreserving exterior forms. Archaic institutions seek to adapt\nto a new modernized milieu in a way that is inherent to\nhuman beings and not plants: If the latter change themselves,\nthe former change the environment. For example, in response\nto the primacy of personal ties, openness to violence, formal\nand legal nihilism in traditional societies, modernized struc-\ntures have to adjust to them and obtain their features. These\nphenomena alone are widely known and constitute one of the\nmost debated topics in social sciences.\nEven if \"backflows\" occupy quite a small social space,\nnevertheless, the very presence of them drastically enhances\nthe unforeseen negative effects of the modernization strategy.\nIn many cases, the collapse of traditionalist segments pro-\nceeds quite painfully: Both in experiments and reality, we see\nthat such efforts may result in the disintegration of the insti-\ntutional structure, and the abrupt narrowing of the system's\nspace of survival. But the \"flawed stability\" scenario is very\ndangerous as well. It implies the dislocation of attractors to\nthe area of competitive institutions and to the pole of the\nState ineffectiveness; it may even cause an open struggle\nbetween institutions of different types. While placing mod-\nernization demands on institutions, the State in the meantime\nmakes concessions to the traditional social forces in exchange\nfor stability. Such dissonant behavior leads to the sheer falsi-\nfication of institutions: Behind the exterior formally modern-\nized fa\u00e7ade, informal archaic institutions--mafia-clannish,\nsenior-vassal, tribal, and so forth--are developing.\nA series of experiments also makes evident the effect of\n\"necrosis\": In the process of modernization, a number of\ninstitutions are neither modernized nor traditionalized, nei-\nther adapt nor isolate themselves, they just disappear in the\nsocial and, consequently, physical sense. It is interesting that\nin our experiments \"necrosis\" started in the poles of diver-\ngence, where formal game rules were too weak and gave\nplace to almighty informal institutions. These are spaces\nwhere society/state public authority ends and the supremacy\nof tribal and ethnic factions, criminal gangs, or quasi-capital-\nist corporations starts. One can see this effect as a humanitar-\nian catastrophe, an accumulation of socially dangerous\ngroups or \"inflammable material,\" and so forth.\nModernization pressure may be accompanied with the\ngrowth of \"volatility\" and variability of modernization mea-\nsures (and likewise, reactions to them): Some of them may be\nstronger and super strong, others less strong and insignifi-\ncant. Historians are familiar with the \"frog effect,\" an inter-\nchange of institutions' and societies' super-passivity with\nleap-ahead super-reactions to sometimes minor external\nimpulses. Besides, the institution's fragility grows signifi-\ncantly against the background of rapid modernization.\nConclusion\nFollowing natural and hard sciences, social disciplines mas-\nter methods and concepts of fractal geometry. Large-scale\ninvariability, system's ability to self-assembling, complex\nconsequences of simple causes, fractal limits--these and\nmany other phenomena are hard to describe and generalize\nwithin traditional models of social processes. Meanwhile,\npolitical scientists, historians, and sociologists often deal\nwith these phenomena. The ability of virtual computer frac-\ntals to simulate real objects and processes in living and non-\nliving worlds makes fractal geometry a heuristically\nproductive instrument not only for modeling physical but\nalso for social reality.\n"
