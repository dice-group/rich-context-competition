    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe present study delineates the cellular responses of\ndorsal pallium to targeted genetic ablation of the principal\npreplate neurons of the neocortex. Ganciclovir treatment\nduring prenatal development (E11\u00adE13; where E is\nembryonic day) of mice selectively killed cells with shared\nS-phase vulnerability and targeted expression of a GPT\n[golli promoter transgene, linked to HSV-TK (herpes simplex\nvirus-thymidine kinase), t-eGFP (t-enhanced green fluor-\nescent protein) and lacZ (lacZ galactosidase) reporters]\nlocalized in preplate neurons. Morphogenetic fates of\nattacked neurons and neuroblasts, and their successors,\nwere assessed by multiple labelling in time-series compar-\nisons between ablated (HSV-TK+/0) and control (HSV-TK0/0)\nlittermates. During ablation generation, neocortical growth\nwas suppressed, and compensatory reorganization of non-\nGPT ventricular zone progenitors of dorsal pallium\nproduced replacements for killed GPT neuroblasts.\nReplacement and surviving GPT neuroblasts then produced\nreplacements for killed GPT neurons. Near-normal restora-\ntion of their complement delayed the settlement of GPT\nneurons into the reconstituted preplate, which curtailed\nthe outgrowth of pioneer corticofugal axons. Based on this\nevidence, we conclude that specific cell killing in ablated\nmice can eliminate a major fraction of GPT neurons, with\ninsignificant bystander killing. Also, replacement GPT\nneurons in ablated mice originate exclusively by prolifera-\ntion from intermediate progenitor GPT neuroblasts, whose\ncomplement is maintained by non-GPT progenitors for\ninductive regulation of the total complement of GPT\nneurons. Finally, GPT neurons in both normal and ablated\nmice meet all morphogenetic criteria, including the\n`outside-in' vertical gradient of settlement, presently used\nto identify principal preplate neurons. In ablated mice,\ndelayed organization of these neurons desynchronizes and\nisolates developing neocortex from the rest of the brain,\nand permanently impairs its connectivity.\n",

Throughout this sequence, a\nsmall complement of non-pyramidal neurons (,10% of total)\ngenerated at the margins of the dorsal pallium migrate\ntangentially into the developing neocortex (Del Rio et al., 1997;\nThe principal preplate neurons show radial migration like the\npredominant cortical plate neurons. They are proliferated by\nprogenitor cells, and many, if not all, of the more deeply settled\npreplate neurons emit corticofugal pioneer axons before\ncortical plate neurons. Unlike cortical plate neurons, they have\nan `outside-in' neurogenetic gradient of vertical settlement\nand, for the most part, shorter periods of survival. They serve\nprimarily as a transient mould for neocortical morphogenesis\nby support of radial migration, laminar framing and guidance\nof afferent ingrowth (Ghosh and Shatz, 1993; Allendoerfer and\nFlores-Sarnat, 2002). However, their full developmental role\nremains uncertain owing to limited success in their identifica-\ntion and experimental elimination. Most of the molecular\nmarkers of these cells occur in multiple brain sites and have\ninsufficient anatomical isolation for decisive ablation studies\n(Hevner et al., 2003). Furthermore, the normal expression of\nthese markers may not regulate naturally occurring mechan-\nisms of apoptosis.\nFortunately, the transgene of the proximal golli promoter\nof the MBP (myelin basic protein) gene is a promising\nmolecular marker for such analyses because of its early and\nrestricted expression in cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb and\nsensory ganglia in mice. It can be used to drive expression of\nvarious reporters, including HSV-TK (herpes simplex virus-\nthymidine kinase), which putatively identify the principal\npreplate neurons and their neuroblasts [collectively referred\nto as GPT (golli promoter transgene) cells for ease of\nal., 2007). HSV-TK can convert the prodrug ganciclovir into\ntoxic nucleotide analogues that disrupt DNA synthesis in\ngenetically targeted GPT progenitors. This initiates apoptosis\nin their daughter GPT cells (neurons and/or neuroblasts),\nwhich complete mitotic division after shared S-phase\nvulnerability (Moolten, 1986). Such treatments produce\ncharacteristic global defects of neocortical lamination in\ntransgenic mice (Xie et al., 2002). In the present study, we\nfocus on the early cellular aspects of this phenotype to test\nthe hypothesis that a permanent, catastrophic extermination\nof GPT neurons accounts for these ablations. The origins, fates\nand organizations of GPT cells are compared in time-series\nbetween littermate control and genetically targeted mice\nwith equivalent exposures to ganciclovir.\nMost of the methods used here have been described fully\nrandomly selected from 46 timed pregnancies [day of\nmating5E0.5 (where E is embryonic day); day of birth5P1\n(where P is postnatal day)] treated to produce large ablations,\nfrom 24 timed pregnancies treated to produce smaller\nablations, and normative reference materials. Data from\nmales and females were equivalent and pooled. Mice were\nhoused in the UCLA School of Medicine vivarium, and\nprocedures were conducted according to the NIH (National\nInstitutes of Health) Guide for the Care and Use of\nLaboratory Animals.\nGeneration and ablation of transgenic mice\nEstablishment and histological identification of\ngenotypes\nTransgenic genotypes were produced using the proximal GPT for\nthe MBP gene to drive expression of linked, non-native reporter\ntransgenes for HSV-TK, t-eGFP (t-enhanced green fluorescent\nprotein) and/or lacZ (lacZ galactosidase) (Landry et al., 1998; Xie\nall mice was a fragment containing 1.1 kb upstream of the golli\ntranscription start site plus 0.2 kb downstream into the first\nexon of the MBP gene.

For the main treatment\ngroup with the largest ablations, pregnant dams received two\ni.p. (intraperitoneal) injections of ganciclovir (20 mg/g of body\n(Xie et al., 2002). For smaller ablations, useful to determine\nthe effects of multiple doses and timing of ganciclovir\nadministrations, pregnant dams received ganciclovir treat-\nments on the following schedules: three injections on E11\u00ad\ninjection on E11 and one injection on E12, and one injection\non E11. These age groups were selected due to the positive\nexpression of HSV-TK in ventricular zone progenitors shown\non E11\u00adE15. Unablated experimental mice receiving vehicle\ninstead of ganciclovir on E11\u00adE12 had no neocortical\ndamage. All mice were alive at delivery as indicated by\nspontaneous movement and/or the absence of histological\nsigns of fetal resorption or extended anoxia.\nHistological preparations\nTissue processing\nPregnant dams anaesthetized with halothane were killed by\ncervical dislocation to obtain fetal tissue on E11\u00adE16 and E18.\nFetuses were delivered, brains dissected and tissues immersed\nin 0.9% NaCl and 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1M PBS\nfixative. Postpartum mice anaesthetized with halothane were\nperfused transcardially with fixative to obtain tissue on P1\nand P4. Tissues were immersion-fixed for 1 h (histochemistry)\nor 12 h (immunohistochemistry) at 4\u00b0C, cryoprotected in 30%\n(w/v) sucrose, frozen in OCTTM, sectioned serially at 20 mm\nthickness (coronal or sagittal planes; all age groups included\nspecimens in both cardinal planes), and mounted on\nsubbed glass slides. For coronal series, the section interval\nwas 200 mm along the rostrocaudal axis of forebrain.\nPrimary antibodies\nHSV-TK was localized with polyclonal rabbit anti-HSV-TK\nserum [a gift from Dr WC Summers (Yale University School of\nMedicine, New Haven, CT, U.S.A.); 1:2000 dilution]. Directed\nagainst whole purified protein, this antiserum shows a major\nWestern blot analysis (Bush et al., 1998). Label was detected\nin all mice with, and none without, the GPT/HSV-TK\ntransgene, indicative of primary antiseral specificity\n(Figures 3C\u00ad3E). t-eGFP was localized with a polyclonal\nrabbit anti-GFP serum (Chemicon, catalogue number\ndilution), which show a single 27 kDa band for GFP in\nWestern blot analysis (according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions). Label was detected in all mice with, and none\nwithout, the GPT/t-eGFP transgene, indicative of primary\nantibody specificities. BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine) was loca-\nlized with a monoclonal mouse anti-BrdU antibody (Becton\nshows BrdU incorporated into single-stranded DNA during\nthe S-phase of the cell cycle (according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions). Label was restricted to the progeny of cells that\nunderwent the cell cycle and mitosis during the periods of\nBrdU exposure, indicative of primary antibody specificity.\nHSV-TK immunohistochemistry\nSections from experimental and control mice in litters with or\nwithout ganciclovir treatment were obtained on E11 (a pre-\nablation group from the earliest day of clear GPT expression\ntal mice expressed this transgene, so unablated experimental\nHSV-TH+/0 mice from dams treated with vehicle, but not ganci-\nclovir, provided normative data. Mounted specimens were\n/methanol, blocked in normal rabbit\nserum, incubated in primary antiserum and labelled by\nbiotinylated avidin\u00adperoxidase methods using DAB (3,39-\ndiaminobenzidine) chromogen. Method specificity of labelling\nin GPT neurons and neuroblasts was affirmed by differential\nstaining of `experimental' compared with `control' sections\nafter omission of primary antiserum in each experimental case,\nwith no apparent labelling in HSV-TK0/0 control mice\n(Figures 3C\u00ad3E). For reporter cross-validation, sections were\nlabelled for lacZ, then HSV-TK. Reporter co-localization was\ndetermined microscopically (brown cytoplasmic/nucleoplasmic\nHSV-TK label+blue cytoplasmic lacZ label; Figure 3A), with\noptical elimination of each label by a running continuous\ninterference monochromator. Results were obtained from 53\ncontrol mice; 13 litters).\nt-eGFP immunohistochemistry\nFor intrinsically generated eGFP, mounted specimens were\ncoverslipped in AquamountTM (Figures 12A\u00ad12F). Immuno-\nhistochemical methods improved label efficiency. Mounted\nspecimens were quenched with 0.3% H2\n/methanol, blocked\nwith BSA, incubated in primary antibodies and labelled by\nbiotinylated avidin\u00adperoxidase methods using DAB chromo-\ngen. Method specificity of labelling of GPT neurons was\naffirmed by omission of primary antibodies in `control' sec-\ntions from each case. For reporter cross-validation, sections\nwere labelled for lacZ, then t-eGFP. Reporter co-localization\nwas determined microscopically (brown cytoplasmic t-eGFP\nlabel+blue cytoplasmic lacZ label; Figure 3B), with optical\nelimination of each label.

On E12\u00adE16, pregnant dams in the main ablation\ngroup (E11\u00adE12 ganciclovir treatments) were given an i.p.\ninjection of 100 mg of BrdU/g of body weight in PBS vehicle.\n144 h post-ganciclovir).

Overall,\nexamined.\nMorphological analysis\nHistological differences were assessed by comparisons between\nand within genotype, treatment and age groups. Observations\nwere obtained by light microscopy with brightfield transmis-\nsion, differential interference contrast transmission and\nepifluorescent illumination (Zeiss Ultraphot IIIB and Leica\nDMRXA microscopes). Data were recorded by analogue film\nand digital photography as well as camera lucida mapping.\nTrends observed by qualitative methods were pursued by\nquantitative measurements, mainly density indices of specif-\nically labelled cells, to assess statistical reliability of differences\nbetween groups. Neocortical development was bilaterally\nsymmetrical in all groups, so data were obtained from a\nrandomly selected hemisphere from each case. Neocortex has a\nlateral-to-medial horizontal neurogenetic gradient reflected in\nthe vertical extent and density of GPT neurons, so sampling\nsites were selected from its flat-mapped centre where\nmeasurements approximated averages from lateral and medial\nlimits. Under certain conditions, ablated mice had focal\nneocortical scars. Sampling sites were selected in the unscarred\ndorsal pallium to assure homologous locations between groups\nthat were well-lateral to the scarred regions.\nA comprehensive density index of GPT neurons was derived\nfrom nine measurements/case of lacZ-positive cells in Neutral\nRed-counterstained neocortex of experimental and control\nmice+61 control mice, 29 litters, five to ten mice/age and\ngenotype).

These\nvalues, normalized by tissue unit, were grouped by age and\ngenotype, averaged, and compared statistically, mainly by a\none-way Student's t test with a fixed Pa\nof reliable differences between groups. These standard\ndensity estimates were also used to measure apoptotic and\nBrdU-labelled neurons.\nFinally, in central sections from E12\u00adE14 mice counterstained\nwith haematoxylin (15 ablated mice+13 control mice, three to\nfive mice/age and genotype), mitotic cells with recognizable\ncleavage planes (as signified by chromosomal orientation,\nnuclear division and/or cytoplasmic division) and locations\n,25 mm from the ventricular surface were detected by light\nmicroscopy and counted along 500 mm of the ventricular lumen\nmagnification). Among these cells, MAT [M (metaphase), A\n(anaphase) and T (telophase)] mitotic profiles were categorized\nas horizontal (cleavage planes ,45\u00b0from a line parallel to the\napical cell surface) or vertical (cleavage planes ,45\u00b0from a line\nperpendicular to the apical cell surface). Within each group,\nMAT profiles yielded comparable percentages of horizontal and\nvertical cells, which allowed the data to be pooled across these\nmitotic phases into two comprehensive categories despite\nmetaplate rocking during metaphase (Haydar et al., 2003).\nMeasurements from each case were converted into linear\ndensities, extrapolated to cells/mm of ventricular surface length\nfor normalization and grouped for statistical analyses.\nFor all of these measurements, Abercrombie's correction\n[Ts\n/(Ts\n+h); where Ts\nis section thickness and h is counted\nprofile thickness] was applied to reduce the bias of profile\ncounts from serial tissue sections (Guillery, 2002). Both terms\nof the correction factor were nearly constant across the age\nand treatment groups (Ts\ncorrection ratio was a transformation that increased the\naccuracy of the description, with no effect on the validity of\nconclusions based on the raw data.\nRESULTS\nAblation studies customarily begin with a survey of the\nextirpated tissue. The genetically targeted ablation used in\nthe present study was unusual because it identified the\nspecifically killed tissue elements as GPT cells, whose survivors\nshowed in turn a high degree of reconstitution and\nreplacement in reaction to the loss of their predecessors\nwithin a defective neocortical phenotype. Our analysis first\ncompared control and ablated mice to assess the structural\norganization of excess dying GPT cells and to delineate their\nplace within the scheme of reorganization of viable GPT cells,\nwhich would have been their normal fate without ganciclovir\ntreatment.\nExcess dying GPT cells and a defective neocortical phenotype\n(Xie et al., 2002) were reliably associated with genotype,\nganciclovir treatment and age at ganciclovir treatment\n(Pa\ncontrol mice with identical exposure to ganciclovir, had the\ndefective phenotype. Ganciclovir-treated experimental mice,\nbut not untreated (i.e. vehicle-injected) experimental mice, had\nthe defective phenotype. Unablated experimental mice had the\nnormal neocortical phenotype of control mice. Experimental\nmice receiving ganciclovir at E11\u00adE13, but not thereafter, had\nthe defective phenotype. Ganciclovir had no effect on control\nmice regardless of age at treatment.\nThe magnitude of the components of the defective\nneocortical phenotype in ablated mice were ganciclovir\ndose-dependent (i.e. `smaller' treatments produced less cell\ndeath and less severe defects) during the E11\u00adE13 period of\nvulnerability. Consequently, the qualitative analyses included\nall of the ablation groups produced during this period to\neliminate non-specific and/or non-essential defects from the\nablation phenotype. The quantitative analyses, and all\nexamples shown in the Figures, originated from the main\nablation group (four ganciclovir treatments on E11 and E12)\nand the ancillary ablation group that received two ganciclovir\ntreatments on E11 to characterize the maximum extent of\nspecific defects produced in the ablation phenotype. In the\nlatter group, mice were usually terminated on E12 to define\nthe earliest cellular aspects of the ablations.\nTargeted ablation produces excess apoptosis in\nthe dorsal pallium\nQualitative regionalization of apoptotic cells\nControl and ablated mice had dying cells located in the dorsal\npallium from E12 to P4. The mode of cell death in both\ngroups was apoptosis, as signified by pyknosis (chromophilia/\nshrinkage) and/or TUNEL labelling (Van Cruchten and Van den\nco-localized and yielded similar results, so their data were\npooled.\nControl and unablated experimental mice had normal\nbackgrounds of diffuse, infrequent apoptotic cells in the\ndorsal pallium and adjacent neostriatum.

Both brain regions\nexhibited normal growth with increasing age.\nAblated mice had excess dying cells in restricted parts of\nforebrain. They rapidly, but transiently, accumulated high\nlevels of apoptotic cells in the dorsal pallium, but not the\nneostriatum (nor, with certain exceptions, any other\nforebrain site) during and immediately after ganciclovir\ntreatment from E12 to E14 (Figure 1). These excess apoptotic\ncells were found mostly in the ventricular zone and, in some\ncases, were located in distinct regions of unscarred and\nscarred tissue. Their early accumulation was the initial\nindicator of the ablation neocortical phenotype, which never\noccurred in their absence. Growth stalled in the dorsal\npallium during their accumulation but resumed with their\ndisappearance. Lower levels of excess apoptosis recurred after\nE16, long after the termination of effective ganciclovir\ntreatments. These late excess apoptotic cells were found\nmostly in the mantle zone.\nNon-specific apoptosis in ablated mice\nThe targeted ablation was capable of killing both GPT and\nnon-GPT cells under certain conditions. Four distinct types of\nnon-specific apoptosis of non-GPT cells were recognized. All\ncells with these types of non-specific apoptosis were excluded\nfrom the quantitative analysis. Three of these types were\neliminated as necessary contributors to the ablation pheno-\ntype, and all regions with these types of non-specific\napoptosis were also excluded from the quantitative analysis.\nControl mice had very few apoptotic cells combined with\nmacrophages (or comparable histiocytes; resident microglia\nwere not apparent in the dorsal pallium during this early\nperiod of development). All groups of ablated mice that\nreceived ganciclovir treatment before E13 had approx. 10%\nof their early-onset apoptotic cells located in unscarred\ndorsal pallium surrounded by dying macrophages, which\noften contained small apoptotic bodies, on E13. Assemblies of\napoptotic cells and macrophages disappeared by E15, and did\nnot recur during late-onset apoptosis. Early-onset phagocyt-\nosis was not sufficient to account for the ablation phenotype,\nbut could not be eliminated by the tested experimental\nconditions. Its main action was the acceleration of the\ndisappearance of excess apoptotic GPT neurons on E14\n(Figure 2A).\nControl mice had no scars.

Scars were associated with multiple\nganciclovir treatments at ,16 h intervals, and were found in\nancillary groups with smaller ablations. Scars eventually\noccupied 10% of the dorsal pallial volume. Nearly all GPT and\nnon-GPT progenitors and neurons were killed in the scars\nduring and shortly after ganciclovir treatment, unlike the\nadjacent, unscarred dorsal pallium. Apoptosis was multiplic-\native, and dying cells formed clustered aggregates within the\nscars. The time-course of apoptotic initiation extended\nbeyond one mitotic cell cycle and was usually accompanied\nby extensive phagocytosis on E13. Few, if any, progenitors,\nGPT neurons, cortical plate neurons, astrocytes, oligoden-\ndroglia or ependymal cells were generated during subsequent\ndevelopment. Scars were penetrated by fibroblasts, ventricu-\nlar zones were obliterated and the dorsal pallium thinned\nafter E13.

They did not always accompany ablation even\nwith the most destructive ganciclovir treatments. They were\neliminated by increasing the intertreatment intervals of\nganciclovir administration. Comparable data were obtained\nfrom unscarred cases and unscarred dorsal pallium of scarred\ncases. However, scars were a significant instructive artefact.\nThey were direct morphological evidence for a distinct\noutcome in the ablation phenotype due to concurrent, early\napoptosis of GPT and non-GPT cells. The alternative, more\nfundamental, outcome of the unscarred dorsal pallium was\ndue to the specific early apoptosis of GPT cells only, as seen\nwithin adjacent regions of dorsal pallium in the same ablated\nmice and in unscarred ablated mice. This difference demon-\nstrated that non-GPT progenitors and neurons were largely, if\nnot entirely, spared in the unscarred dorsal pallium of ablated\nmice, although the identities of all non-GPT cells or all\napoptotic cells could not be established with absolute\ncertainty due to technical limitations.\nTwo other defects occurred only in severely scarred ablated\nmice, and were therefore not necessary contributors to the\nablation phenotype. Transient increases of apoptotic neurons\nwere seen in forebrain circumventricular organs, particularly\nthe median eminence, for several days following ganciclovir\ntreatment. Also, ventricular expansion and neocortical\nthinning occurred after E18 as signs of progressive hydro-\ncephalus (Figure 4F).\nQuantitative development of apoptotic cell density\nDensities of apoptotic cells in the dorsal pallium of control\nmice were relatively high at E12\u00adE13 during the generation\nof GPT cells, but decreased reliably from E12 to E16 before\nrising slowly to a lower level after E18 (Figure 2A; Pa\nDensities of apoptotic cells in the unscarred dorsal pallium\n(the exclusive focus of further analysis) of ablated mice were\nreliably greater than in same-age controls (Figure 2A;\nPa\n,0.05). These differences represented excess cell death,\nwhich emerged in three phases.\nThe early-onset phase of apoptosis consisted of significant\nincreases in the densities of dying cells from E12 to E15\n(Pa\nduring the normal period of generation for GPT cells (+494%\nof the control value). Continued ganciclovir treatments\nproduced a peak accumulation at E13 (+873% of the control\nvalue). Apoptosis decreased rapidly after E13 and was nearly\nabsent at E16. These data indicated that excess apoptotic cells\nwere generated within 12 h, and persisted for approx. 48 h,\nafter ganciclovir treatment, consistent with previous esti-\nmates of the time-course of apoptotic cells in normal\nneocortex (Takahashi et al., 1996). Early-onset apoptosis was\ndue mainly to the death of GPT cells triggered by ganciclovir\ntreatment. Its rapid, additive onset, and even more rapid\nsubsidence, demonstrated that each ganciclovir treatment\nexerted a killing effect on a cell cohort generated within one\ncell cycle.\nThe middle-onset phase of apoptosis matched the low,\nnormal density of dying cells encountered in control mice on\nE16. Excess apoptosis was absent at this time.\nThe late-onset phase of apoptosis consisted of reliable\nincreases in the densities of apoptotic cells after E18\n(Pa\n,0.05). This recurrent apoptosis was minor in magnitude,\nwith the peak value on P1 at ,15% of the peak value for the\nearly-onset phase. Late-onset apoptosis was due to the death\nof settled neocortical neurons more than 5 days after\nganciclovir treatment.\nDirect demonstration of apoptotic GPT neurons\nOnly a small fraction of apoptotic cells was identified by\ndouble-labelling as GPT neurons, owing to the destructive\nprocesses of cell death, which usually impaired migration and\nreporter expression.\nApoptotic GPT neurons (lacZ) were seen in the mantle and\nmarginal zones of the dorsal pallium from E12 to P1 in\ncontrol mice.

HSV-TK was found in infrequent GPT neurons\nlocated in the marginal, mantle and intermediate zones of\ndorsal pallium in experimental mice, whereas t-eGFP and lacZ\nwere almost undetectable before ganciclovir treatment on\nE11. Reporters resided in the perikaryal cytoplasm of far more\nfrequent post-mitotic (G0\n-phase) GPT neurons located distal\nto the ventricular zone in dorsal pallium from E12 to P4\n(Figures 3, 4 and 12). GPT neurons had fusiform or multipolar\ncell bodies, somatic diameters .7 mm and dispersed nuclear\nchromatin. Somatic diameters grew to .10 mm, and t-eGFP\nlabelling extended into dendritic and axonal processes in\nolder mice.\nApoptotic GPT neurons which localized with each of the\nreporters were settled in the marginal and mantle zones of\ncontrol and ablated mice at E12\u00adP4.

Adjacent sections\nsingly labelled for each reporter showed that approx. 30% of\nthe cells in the marginal zone in unablated triple-transgenic\nexperimental mice were GPT neurons, with similar results for\nt-eGFP and lacZ in control mice during this early period.\nMore than 90% of the cells in the mantle zone of the same\nsections were GPT neurons. Reporter co-localizations were\n(Figures 3A and 3B) in adjacent sections labelled for HSV-\nTK+lacZ and t-eGFP+lacZ in triple-transgenic unablated\nexperimental mice. The proportions of GPT neurons were\nreduced to ,10% of the neurons in the marginal zone and\n,50% of the neurons in the mantle zone during this period\nin ablated experimental mice. They retained normal levels of\nnon-GPT neurons, which transiently increased their density\ndue to the paucity of viable GPT neurons. This result indicated\nthat non-GPT neurons were not subjected to significant non-\nspecific killing in the unscarred neocortex of ablated mice.\nViable and dying GPT neurons of control and ablated mice\nsettled in the dorsal pallium by and after E11 in agreement\nwith molecular biological evidence (Landry et al., 1998). All\nthree reporters were detected in neocortical neurons that\nmatched, with no evidence for reporter leakage, the structure\nof GPT neurons shown by in situ hybridization (Jacobs et al.,\n2007). Localization of any of these reporters in GPT neurons\nwas a surrogate for the others, as predicted by genotype.\nHemi- and homozygous offspring, like homozygous progeni-\ntors, had similar results for t-eGFP and lacZ transgenes, so\ntheir data were pooled. Double- and triple-transgenic mice\nhad identical results for shared transgenes, so their data were\npooled when appropriate.\nRegional organization of GPT neurons\nThe vertical organization of GPT neurons in control mice\nemerged with their settlement in the mantle and marginal\nzones of preplate neocortex (Figures 4A, 4C and 4E). The\nprimordial, unilaminar settlement of GPT neurons in the\npreplate neocortex established superficial (marginal zone),\nmiddle (mantle zone intercalated with cortical plate) and\ndeep (mantle zone subplate) laminae in primitive neocortex\nfrom E13 to E15. This trilaminar pattern persisted in mature\nneocortex at E16, with separation of the distal laminae by\nintervening supragranular cortical plate neurons and separa-\ntion of the proximal laminae by expansion of the fibrous\nband of layer VI. Normal apoptosis of GPT neurons from E16\nto P4 followed a distal (early)-to-proximal (late) sequence,\nand eventually restricted these cells mostly to the subplate\nand deep parts of layer VI.\nThe horizontal organization of GPT neurons in control mice\nbegan to emerge on E12 with their first settlement near the\nrhinal sulcus (Figure 4A). This region became juxtallocortex,\nwith the greatest density of GPT neurons in forebrain.\nSubsequent, concentric, settlement of GPT neurons into neo-\nand allo-cortex was finished by E16. Approx. 50% settled into\nneocortex in a lateral (early)-to-medial (late) neurogenetic\ngradient. The remainder settled into juxtallo- and allo-cortex,\nwith small contributions to claustrum and amygdala. No\nother forebrain sites contained GPT neurons.\nAblated mice had the same patterns of vertical and\nhorizontal organization of GPT neurons as control mice\n(Figures 4B, 4D and 4F). They required one or two additional\ndays of age to complete the settlement of GPT neurons into\npreplate neocortex before its structural transformation\ninto primitive neocortex. The middle and deep laminar\ndistributions of GPT neurons were more diffuse and\ndisaggregated in ablated mice during the postnatal period.\nThis defect was accentuated in scarred, hydrocephalic cases,\nwhich suggested the occurrence of a non-specific disruption\nin the orderly apoptotic sequence found in control mice\n(Figures 4E and 4F).\nQualitative distribution of GPT neurons\nThe density of GPT neurons (lacZ) in control mice increased from\ntheir initial detection at E12 and peaked at E16 as their genera-\ntion and accumulation outpaced volumetric tissue growth\n(Figures 4A, 4C and 4E). GPT neurons became sparser after E16\ndue to cessation of generation and accumulation, continued\nneocortical growth and normally accelerated apoptosis.\nGPT neurons (lacZ) in ablated mice were also first detected\nat E12, but their density did not increase notably until E14\n(Figures 4B, 4D and 4F) with the subsidence of early-onset\napoptosis in unscarred dorsal pallium. They became denser\nthan in controls, as extended generation led to excess\naccumulation relative to volumetric tissue growth between\ndue to cessation of generation and accumulation, continued\nneocortical growth and abnormally accelerated, late-onset\napoptosis.\nTargeted ablation delayed the accumulation of viable GPT\nneurons in unscarred neocortex in patterns that mirrored the\nregional accumulation of early-onset apoptotic cells in the\nmantle zone and its underlying intermediate and ventricular\nzones (i.e. along the radial path of migration and settlement\nof GPT neurons). The simultaneous shortfall of distal, viable\nGPT neurons and the excess accumulation of proximal, dying\ncells was indirect anatomical evidence that a substantial\nfraction of the apoptotic cells was morphologically related to\nGPT neurons.\nQuantitative density of GPT neurons\nThe density of viable GPT neurons in the dorsal pallium of\ncontrol mice was a parabolic function of age (Figure 5). It\nrepresented the generation and settlement of GPT neurons as\nan early rising phase followed by continued tissue growth and\nneuronal loss during a late descending phase.

However, standard density values obtained\nfor GPT neurons (HSV-TK and t-eGFP) in unablated\nexperimental mice showed the initial rising phase between\npeak value at E16. Similar late-phase decreases after E16 were\nobtained with all three reporters (Figure 5). Thus lacZ was less\nefficient than HSV-TK and t-eGFP reporters during the early,\nbut not the late, development of GPT neurons. These data\nindicated that neocortical GPT neurons were normally\nacquired from E11 to E14, consistent with the vulnerability\nof GPT cells to ganciclovir-induced apoptosis from E11 to\nE13, plus a delay of 24 h for migration and settlement.\nThe density of viable GPT neurons in the unscarred dorsal\npallium of ablated mice retained the same developmental\npattern, but had a reliably different age distribution from\nFigure 4 Photomicrographs of the organization of GPT neurons (blue, lacZ) in coronal sections of dorsal pallium counterstained with Neutral Red in control\n(A, C and E) and littermate ablated (B, D and F; E11 and E11\u00adE12 ganciclovir treatments) mice\nDevelopmental effects are shown by differences in vertical sequences, and superimposed ablation effects are shown by differences in horizontal pairs.

The early rising phase\nwas extended, which skewed the distribution to the right. The\ndistribution was also more kurtotic, with greater peak density\nand accelerated rising and descending phases. Comprehensive\nand standard measurements of GPT neurons (lacZ) again\nyielded similar values (Pa\n.0.05). Standard density values\nobtained for GPT neurons (HSV-TK) showed a cumulative\nincrease for the rising phase, a peak value at E15 that\napproached the lacZ peak value and a late descending phase\nas for control mice (Figure 5).

The\nrecovery of a relatively normal total complement of GPT\nneurons in ablated mice, gained by the proliferation of\nsurviving GPT neuroblasts and replacement GPT neuroblasts\n(see below), indicated that dying GPT neurons were unable to\nrejoin the pool of viable GPT neurons. There were no apparent\nshortfalls beyond scar losses among non-GPT cells generated\nsubsequent to targeted ablations, except in association with\nthe late occurrence of hydrocephalus.\nThe third phase showed the dissolution of GPT neurons\n(E18\u00adP4; Figures 4E and 4F).

The\nquantitative coincidence and covariation between the\npredominant fate of live GPT neurons and the early-onset\ndying cells was further indirect evidence for the identity of\napoptotic GPT cells in ablated mice. Many live GPT neurons\nwere missing during early-onset apoptosis in ablated mice\ndue to their failed generation from dying progenitors or their\ntransformation into dying GPT neurons.\nTargeted ablation reconstitutes the ventricular\nzone to replace GPT neuroblasts and GPT neurons\nin the dorsal pallium\nLocalization of reporters in GPT cells in the ventricular\nzone\nAll three reporters demonstrated that GPT neurons settled in\nthe marginal and mantle zones, but only HSV-TK allowed\nthem to be traced back to their immediate progenitors.

They were absent from\ncontrol mice and all other forebrain ventricular zones in\nexperimental mice.\nFigure 5 Corrected means\u00a1S.E.M. of GPT neurons in the marginal and\nmantle zones of dorsal pallium in control and ablated mice from E11 to\nTop panel: comprehensive measurements of age-related differences of\naccumulated GPT neurons [lacZ (Neutral Red counterstain)] in control and\nablated groups.

Approx. 50% of the HSV-TK immunoreactive cells at\ntheir peak density in the ventricular zone had condensed\nnuclear chromatin in counterstained sections. Approx. 15% of\nthese cells had mitotic chromosomal arrays and were\ninterspersed among unlabelled mitotic cells when adjacent\nto or within 25 mm of the ventricular lumen. Taken together,\nthese cells were GPT progenitors in S-, G2\n- and mitotic cell-\ncycle phases immediately before separation of asymmetrically\ndivided daughter GPT neurons and neuroblasts, or symmet-\nrically divided daughter GPT neurons. Densities of GPT\nneuroblasts increased and then decreased rapidly during\nearly neocorticogenesis, with peaks at E12 (absent by E14) in\nunablated experimental mice and E13 (absent by E16) in\nablated experimental mice. These nascent periods preceded,\nthen briefly accompanied, the subsequent settlement of GPT\nneurons in the marginal and mantle zones.\nOther GPT cells, usually distal to the lumen in the\nventricular zone, had dispersed nuclear chromatin. They were\npost-mitotic (G0\n-phase) GPT neurons in migratory transit\nfrom their periventricular mitotic origins and, in at least some\ncases, pre-mitotic (G0\n-phase) GPT neuroblasts\npreparing to re-enter the cell cycle in the distal ventricular\nzone. They disappeared from the ventricular zone with the\nmitotic exhaustion and disappearance of GPT neuroblasts.\nThey were supplanted by the normal succession of non-GPT\nprogenitors, which yielded no apparent shortfalls for non-\nGPT cell types generated subsequent to targeted ablations in\nthe same ventricular zones of the dorsal pallium.\nGPT neuroblasts in the S-, G2\n- or mitotic phases did not\nexhibit apoptosis in control or ablated mice. However, their\ndensities were transiently suppressed during the onset of the\nrising phase of early-onset apoptosis in ablated mice. All of the\napoptotic GPT cells in the ventricular zone were G0\n-\nphase cells in both control and ablated mice. There were wide\nvariations of TUNEL and HSV-TK label densities in these\napoptotic cells in the ablated mice owing to variable durations\nof ganciclovir exposure during their S-phase period of\nvulnerability. The tissue densities of these apoptotic cells\nincreased excessively during the early-onset phase of apoptosis\nin ablated mice when the density of viable GPT cells in the\nventricular zone was first suppressed. The initial suppression of\nmitotically active GPT cells in ablated mice provided direct\nevidence that a substantial fraction of the dying, non-mitotic\nGPT cells in the ventricular zone consisted of GPT neuroblasts\nunable to re-enter the cell cycle. The remainder of the dying\nGPT cells, half or more of the total dying GPT cells in the\nventricular zone of ablated mice, necessarily consisted of GPT\nneurons (i.e. daughter neurons of asymmetric or symmetric\ndivision of GPT neuroblasts) largely unable to migrate into the\nmantle zone. Both of these outcomes would have contributed\nto the early shortfall of live GPT neurons settled distally into\nthe marginal and mantle zones.\nMany of the early-onset apoptotic cells found in the\nventricular zone degenerated so rapidly that their GPT\nidentity could not be directly determined at 24 h after\nganciclovir treatment. However, these apoptotic cells,\nincluding directly identified apoptotic GPT cells, retained\nthe same dispersed, non-clustering, isolated pattern of\ndistribution found for dying GPT neurons in the mantle and\nmarginal zones. They were located in close proximity to viable\nGPT cells as well as unlabelled non-GPT cells that escaped\nspecific cell killing. These results, and the observed limitation\nof cell killing to single cell-cycle cohorts of newly proliferated\ncells, indicated that toxin leakage mediated little or no non-\nspecific bystander effect on GPT and non-GPT progenitors, as\nwell as GPT neurons, within the ventricular zone of the\nunscarred dorsal pallium of ablated mice.\nReorganization of the periventricular mitotic array in\nablated mice\nThe periventricular mitotic array near the ventricular lumen\nappeared to be continuous and only one to three cells deep in\ncell density within the array increased with age (Figures 6A\nand 6B). GPT neuroblasts disappeared as their proliferation of\nGPT neurons was exhausted.\nThe majority of periventricular mitotic cells consisted of\nGPT neuroblasts at E12 in unablated experimental mice. The\nmagnitude of this progenitor population was consistent with\nthe observed high yield of GPT neurons at this time. It was\nalso congruent with the modest growth of the ventricular\nand predicted by a predominant mode of asymmetric division\namong GPT neuroblasts. Fewer than 10% of the mitotic cells\nwere GPT neuroblasts on E13, and they were absent at E15\n(Figure 6A). The density of GPT neuroblasts was reduced at\nE12 in ablated experimental mice coincident with early-onset\napoptosis, the observed low yield of viable GPT neurons and\nreduced growth of the ventricular zone (,10% daily volume\nincrease) (Figures 6A and 6B). The density of mitotic cells was\ndecreased at the ventricular lumen, but increased overall with\nthe vertical expansion of the full periventricular mitotic array.\nThis transformation was initially signified by the retention of\nnormal levels of non-GPT progenitors and mitotic profiles\nadjacent to the ventricular lumen and an overall increase in\ntheir density within the full extent of the reorganizing\nmitotic arrays. These results indicated that non-GPT progeni-\ntors were not subjected to significant non-specific killing\n(Figure 6). Subsequently, increased densities of GPT neuro-\nblasts clustered in thickened mitotic arrays, but did not\naccount for their full complement at E13. The peak density of\nGPT neuroblasts slightly preceded, then accompanied, the\nexuberant accumulation of GPT neurons. GPT neuroblasts\ndisappeared at E15 before the late-onset dissolution of GPT\nneurons.\nThe periventricular mitotic arrays were disrupted by cell-\nsparse spaces due to apoptosis of entrapped G0\n-phase\nGPT cells at E12\u00adE13 in ablated mice. The depth of the\ndamaged arrays increased with age and was reliably greater in\nY-Y Xie, E Jacobs and R Fisher\n238 E 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\ncompared with 2\u00a11 cells, Pa\ncular mitotic cells were infrequent in both groups during this\nperiod.\nThe reconstitution of the mitotic array was reflected\namong progenitors positioned adjacent to the ventricular\nlumen in the dorsal pallium.

In any\nevent, targeted ablation transiently shifted all mitotic cells\ntoward the vertical cleavage plane, including mitotic GPT\nneuroblasts.\nThese observations provided indirect evidence that GPT\nneuroblasts, as well as GPT neurons, were included among the\nearly-onset apoptotic cells located in the ventricular zone of\nablated mice. The density of mitotic GPT neuroblasts was\nreduced at the ventricular lumen and shifted toward a\nsymmetric division plane during early-onset apoptosis,\nwhereas the density of mitotic non-GPT neuroblasts with a\ndominant symmetric division plane was reduced at the\nventricular lumen, but increased with the thickening of the\nproliferative array. Thus non-GPT progenitors were spared\nfrom non-specific bystander killing and stimulated to\nproliferate by the targeted ablation of GPT neuroblasts. This\noutcome was accompanied by a shortfall of distal, viable GPT\nneurons and an accumulation of nearly twice as many\nproximal, dying cells, which had to consist of GPT neuroblasts,\nas well as GPT neurons.\nProliferative replacement of GPT neuroblasts and neurons\nin the dorsal pallium of ablated mice\nThe proliferation of non-GPT progenitors allowed the ongoing\nreplacement and additive cell death of GPT neuroblasts and\nneurons during and shortly after the initiation of early-onset\napoptosis in ablated mice. The retention of this proliferative\ncapacity in ablated mice indicated that non-GPT progenitors\nwere not subjected to significant non-specific killing. The\nsubsequent, exclusive origins and radial migration of normal,\nsurviving and replacement GPT neurons from GPT neuroblasts\nin the ventricular zone of the dorsal pallium were cross-\nvalidated by mapping `birth-dated' BrdU-labelled cells into a\ndevelopmental neocortical mosaic (Figure 3F).\nDoubly labelled GPT neurons in control mice were\nproliferated only by ventricular zone neuroblasts at E11\u00adE13,\nwith peak production at E11\u00adE12 (shown sequentially in\nFigures 8\u00ad10). GPT neurons migrated radially into the marginal\nand mantle zones within 24 h of proliferation. Nearly all\ncontained detectable lacZ within 48 h of proliferation,\nconsistent with the differential efficiency of HSV-TK and lacZ\nreporters. GPT neurons settled in a superficial (early)-to-deep\n(late) (i.e. `outside-in') neurogenetic gradient as a characteristic\npattern of vertical organization.\nThis neurogenetic gradient was conserved but delayed in\nablated mice (Figures 8\u00ad10). At E13, the few viable doubly\nlabelled GPT neurons born on E12 settled deep to GPT\nneurons born before E12. At E14, doubly labelled cells were\nembedded between singly labelled GPT neurons born before\nlabelled cells born on E13 settled between singly labelled GPT\nneurons born before and after E13. At E17, only a few doubly\nlabelled neurons born on E15 settled in the subplate.\nFigure 7 Corrected mean linear densities\u00a1S.E.M. showing different distributions of categories of mitotic profiles at the luminal surface of the ventricular\nzone proliferative matrix for dorsal pallium in E12\u00adE14 control and ablated mice (E11 and E11\u00adE12 ganciclovir treatments)\n(A) Total mitotic profiles regardless of phase of mitosis.

This finding suggested that few, if any,\nnon-GPT neurons originated from either GPT- or non-GPT\nprogenitors in the dorsal pallium before E13. Comparable\nablated mice had many persistent, singly labelled BrdU cells in\nthe ventricular zone until E14 (Figure 8).

The outgrowth of dendritic and\naxonal processes from GPT neurons, best assessed at E18 a\nfew days after settlement and before the advent of gross\nhydrocephalus in the main group, was reliably impaired in\nablated mice (Pa\n,0.05). Comparable densities of labelled GPT\nneurons were present in control and ablated mice at this\ntime, with macroscopic label differences attributed mostly to\ntheir processes.\nForebrains of ablated mice had many fewer t-eGFP labelled\nprocesses than littermate controls (Figures 12A and 12B).\nModerately impaired dendritic outgrowth of GPT neurons\nwithin ablated neocortex accounted for the scarcity of\nlabelled bundles of apical dendrites, commonly seen in\ncontrols (Figures 12C and 12D). Mild impoverishment of local\ncollaterals and corticocortical projections from GPT neurons\nin ablated mice also yielded a diffuse, punctate distribution of\nlabelled axons at the interface of the subplate and corona\nradiata. Of most significance, labelled corticofugal and\ncorticocortical axonal projections from GPT neurons in\nablated mice were infrequent before, on and after E18, and\nwere largely absent from the narrowed fibre fascicles of the\ninternal capsule and thinned corpus callosum (Figures 12E\nand 12F). Ablated mice had grossly diminished neuropil\nspaces that would normally have been occupied by\nthalamocortical axons and neuronal dendrites in layers IV\nand VI of primary sensory neocortex.\nThese changes accompanied the late-onset apoptosis of\nGPT neurons.

The targeted ablation of GPT\ncells in the dorsal pallium, in concert with the reactions of\nsurviving and replacement cells, yields phenotypic defects of\nradial migration, laminar framing and afferent guidance,\nwhere governance has been attributed to preplate neurons in\nprevious studies (Ghosh and Shatz, 1993; Allendoerfer and\nJacobs et al., 2007). The hypothesis that a permanent,\ncatastrophic extermination of preplate neurons accounts for\nthe targeted ablation must be rejected because the\nsuppression of GPT neurons is transient (i.e. killed cells are\nreplaced) and the apoptosis of GPT neurons is graded (i.e.\nkilled cells are compounded additively by serial ganciclovir\ntreatments during progenitor vulnerability).\nThe present study provides support for additional conclu-\nsions of biological significance by integration of the cellular\norigins, morphogenesis and population dynamics of normal\nand ablated GPT cells.

GPT neurons are one of the\nprincipal specific targets for ablation, as demonstrated\ndirectly by the co-localization of apoptosis and GPT reporters.\nDespite the dissemination of cellular lesions and the\nprogressive failure of target gene expression in dying cells,\nthe extent of apoptotic GPT neurons can be determined from\nthe preponderance of morphological evidence and key\nstatistical observations of densities of viable GPT neurons\nand apoptotic cells in control and ablated mice during and\nshortly after ganciclovir exposure\nHalf the peak density of non-phagocytic cells killed during\nearly-onset apoptosis is a predictable shortfall of GPT neurons\ndue to the killing mechanism of the targeted ablation initiated\nduring asymmetric cell division. The remaining half consists of\nspecifically killed GPT neuroblasts. Consistent with these\ninterpretations, the sum of 50% of the apoptotic cell density\nand the total GPT neuron density observed on E13 shortly after\nganciclovir treatment in the main group of ablated mice\npredictably and nearly attains the peak density of GPT neurons\nin littermate control mice, with similar results obtained\nthroughout the first phase of apoptosis. Furthermore, the\nfraction of GPT neurons that escapes specific killing at E11\u00adE12\nis predictable from durations of effective ganciclovir action\n(5 h), S-phase (5 h), cell cycle (10 h) and intertreatment interval\nsurvival of 11% in the main group of ablated mice matches the\npredicted survival of 10% for surviving GPT neurons generated\nduring the E11\u00adE12 period of the targeted ablation.\nBased on this evidence, we conclude that the conditions\ntested in the present study specifically eliminate up to 90% of\nthe normal complement of GPT neurons. Using the schedule of\norigin of BrdU-labelled GPT neurons in control mice, these\nmethods can be extended to estimate the dose-dependency of\nspecific cell killing in ancillary ablation groups. For example,\nthree ganciclovir injections at E11\u00adE12 eliminate up to 70%,\ntwo ganciclovir injections on E11 eliminate up to 36% and one\nganciclovir injection on E11 eliminates up to 18% of the\noriginal unablated complement of GPT neurons. Qualitative\nobservations of the magnitude of the defective neocortical\nphenotype of ablated mice match this ordered sequence.\nNon-specific cell killing is insignificant, but\nstructurally distinctive, in ablated mice\nHSV-TK/ganciclovir ablations are often associated with non-\nspecific `bystander' killing, an apoptotic amplification by\nthree possible mechanisms: intercellular toxin transfer via\ngap junctions, intercellular toxin transfer by endocytosis and/\nor local immunological activation by extracellular toxin. The\nextent of bystander killing in the predominant unscarred\ndorsal pallium can be determined with reasonable certainty\nby key statistical observations of ratios of apoptotic cell\ndensities in ablated mice to GPT neuron densities in control\nmice during and shortly after ganciclovir exposure.\nExcess dying cells in ablated mice accumulate after the rapid\nsaturation of clearance mechanisms (Thomaidou et al., 1997).\nHigh ratios of dying to normal cells would reveal amplification,\nparticularly via gap junctions, with a range of predicted values\nbetween 6:1 (oncological studies) and 100:1 (dye-coupling of\nneuronal progenitors) (LoTurco and Kriegstein, 1991;\napoptotic amplification, but consistent with the specific killing\nof either symmetrically divided pairs of GPT neurons derived\nfrom a GPT progenitor, or asymmetrically divided pairs of GPT\nneurons and GPT neuroblasts derived from a GPT progenitor.\nThe characteristic reorganization of the proliferative matrix in\nthe ventricular zone and the proliferative replacement of GPT\nneurons in ablated mice are in accordance with only the latter\ncondition. Based on this evidence, and comparable results\nthroughout the first phase of apoptosis, we conclude that\nbystander killing plays an insignificant role in the unscarred\nneocortex of ablated mice.\nThe products of non-specific killing deserve close attention\nfor their probative value, as well as for their required\ninclusion in a comprehensive survey of the impact of targeted\nablation. Based on evidence presented by these distinct forms\nof cellular damage, we conclude that the specificity of the\ntargeted ablation method, while not absolute, is sufficient to\npermit meaningful developmental analyses. Only one early\nform of non-specific killing can be recognized in the\nunscarred dorsal pallium of all ablated mice: dying macro-\nphages, which ingest toxin by endocytosis from specifically\nkilled neurons. A second early form of bystander killing is\nseen in scars, which are neither necessary nor sufficient to\naccount for the unscarred ablation phenotype. Scars provide\nan alternative outcome where both GPT and non-GPT cells\nare clearly subject to ganciclovir-initiated apoptosis. These\nscars have two key features. First, they are limited in extent,\nunlike the widespread neuroepithelial collapse produced by\nearly ionizing radiation (Bayer and Altman, 1991). Secondly,\ntheir location is restricted to the dorsomedial peak of the\ndorsal pallium, a site that divides capillary beds from anterior\nand middle cerebral arteries. This site is unvascularized in\nmice until E15, although capillaries penetrate all other dorsal\npallial ventricular zones on E11 (Conradi and Sourander,\nments and slow toxin clearance may promote non-specific\nbystander killing due to inherent vascular defects that\nresemble those found in neoplastic tumours, the most\nintensely studied tissue model for bystander killing. Scars\nencompass killing of all available cell types, which suggests\nmediation by toxin endocytosis. Neuroepithelial collapse\nwithin the scars releases toxins into the ventricular CSF\n(cerebrospinal fluid). Endocytosis of toxin-contaminated\nY-Y Xie, E Jacobs and R Fisher\n246 E 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nCSF from residual processes at the ventricular lumen or `leaky'\nnon-ciliated tanycytes may then non-specifically kill neurons\nin circumventricular organs. Hydrocephalus may originate later\nfrom the inherent structural weakness and impaired vascular\ndrainage of the scars, a progressive organic effect often found\nin association with neoplastic forebrain tumours.\nReplacement GPT neurons proliferate from GPT\nneuroblasts in ablated mice\nThe capacity for near-normal replacement of the complement\nof GPT neurons in ablated mice is unexpected and may shed\nlight on the difficult problem of control of proliferation during\nneocortical development (Price and Willshaw, 2000). The key\nobservation is the expression of HSV-TK in both GPT\nneuroblasts and neurons, a finding inferred, but not demon-\nstrated, in our previous study (Xie et al., 2002), and congruent\nwith molecular biological indicators of GPT expression (Landry\net al., 1998). These asymmetrically divided progeny show a very\nearly localization of the reporter-target for ganciclovir action\nduring a shared S-phase within their common GPT progenitors,\nconditions required for apoptotic induction, but not coincident\nin ganciclovir-insensitive, G0\n-phase (post-mitotic) GPT neurons\nGPT neuroblasts are located entirely in the ventricular zone of\nthe dorsal pallium for a short developmental period in normal\nand ablated mice. The occurrence and extent of addition of GPT\nneurons is determined by preceding levels of proliferation of\nGPT neuroblasts in these restricted sites. Newborn GPT neurons\nmigrate radially to settle into the mantle and marginal zones,\nwhere they can be detected by less efficient t-eGFP and lacZ\nreporters. The origin, migration and settlement patterns of GPT\ncells shown by HSV-TK match the morphological trail of\napoptotic cells in ablated mice. Also, birthdays of apoptotic cells\nand GPT neurons in ablated mice fit these patterns when lacZ\nexpression is corrected to the earlier, more accurate, timing of\nHSV-TK expression. Finally, replacement of GPT neuroblasts and\nneurons fails only where the instructive artefact of neuro-\nepithelial collapse of a ventricular zone scar in the dorsal pallium\nextirpates the proliferative source and radial migratory\nframework for newly generated cells.\nBased on this evidence, we conclude that, like normal GPT\nneurons, replacement GPT neurons in ablated mice arise entirely\nby extended de novo proliferation from GPT neuroblasts.\nRegulation, modulation and technical sensitivity may contribute\nto differences in reporter efficiency, but de novo expression\nand/or up-regulation of GPT in post-mitotic neurons that\nnormally do not localize GPT are neither apparent nor consistent\nwith the data, unlike trophic determinations of transmitter\nidentity in sympathetic ganglion neurons (Patterson, 1978).\nReplacement GPT neuroblasts originate from\nnon-GPT progenitors in ablated mice\nGPT neuroblasts first arise from non-GPT progenitors, then\nself-replicate for a limited period by asymmetric division as\nshown by HSV-TK expression in unablated experimental mice.\nSelf-replication of GPT neuroblasts is largely eliminated by\nspecific cell killing during the period of ganciclovir-induced\napoptosis in ablated mice, when neocortical development\nfalters, but does not fail. Simultaneously, dying GPT neurons\nare accumulated in an additive, continuous fashion. The key\nobservations are the reconstitution and extended replace-\nment of GPT neuroblasts during and shortly after their\ntargeted ablation, which uncover a mechanism of proliferat-\nive plasticity for the subsequent replacement of killed GPT\nneurons.\nBased on this evidence, we conclude that, like the initial\npool of normal GPT neuroblasts, a substantial component of\nreplacement GPT neuroblasts seen during ganciclovir treat-\nment in ablated mice originate and replenish by proliferation\nfrom prior progenitors. These progenitors are invulnerable to\nganciclovir-induced ablation due to lack of GPT expression,\nand neither do they seem to be prone to bystander killing\nfrom dying GPT cells within the ablated ventricular zone. This\nprogenitor\u00adneuroblast\u00adneuron lineage sequence identifies\nthe GPT neuroblasts as intermediate progenitor cells. Their\nprogrammed death after three to five cycles of asymmetric\ndivision would account, at least in part, for the regulated\naccumulation of viable GPT neurons and the early high levels\nof apoptosis normally encountered in the ventricular zone of\nthe dorsal pallium. The lineage sequence appears to be\nobligatory and unidirectional, with no apparent bypass\ntowards cortical plate instead of preplate assembly or reversal\nfrom cortical plate to preplate assembly.\nSuch lineage sequences contribute to the amplification,\nregulation and diversification of cell division in neocortex\nexample occurs in the late generation of the subventricular\nzone and supragranular neurons (Noctor et al., 2001). The\nnew data indicate that a comparable sequence may also be\nemployed in the ventricular zone by early neuronal\nprogenitors. The harnessing of HSV-TK/ganciclovir ablation\nto GPT expression is a significant technical improvement for\nstudies of intact brain because, unlike previous ablative\nagents such as ionizing radiation or the anti-mitotic\nmethylazoxymethanol (Bayer and Altman, 1991; Cattabeni\nand DiLuca, 1997), the new attack spares prior progenitors,\nspecifically kills intermediate progenitors of GPT neurons and\nlargely saves the proliferative matrix of the ventricular zone\nfrom neuroepithelial collapse.\nThe complement of GPT neurons is inductively\nregulated in ablated mice\nAblated and normal mice eventually attain similar peak total\ncomplements of viable GPT neurons. A key observation is\nobtained from ablated mice, which display a proliferative\ncapacity to replenish and replace killed cells by generating\nnearly twice the total complement of GPT neurons found in\nnormal mice, with no alteration of the cell-cycle duration\namong GPT neuroblasts.

This regulation, also embedded\nin control mice, involves both positive and negative feedback,\nsince substantial shortfalls or excesses of the total population\nof viable GPT neurons are avoided. The regulation appears to\nbe global for the dorsal pallium, which may reflect numerous\nlocal cellular interactions widely distributed throughout its\nproliferative ventricular zone. Despite previous speculation\nuncharted.\nIt is important to recall that neocortical growth is abridged\nin ablated mice, which leads to excessive, transient local\naccumulations of viable GPT neurons. The scale of this\nsupranormal local replacement of GPT cells is paradoxical\nwith regard to ganciclovir-induced reductions of mitotic\nactivity immediately adjacent to the ventricle in the dorsal\npallium of ablated mice. However, ablative harrowing of the\nproliferative matrix of the ventricular zone evokes its\nstructural reorganization. The periventricular mitotic array\nconverts from a flat, thin configuration into a perforated,\nthick configuration, which expands the vertical complement\nof mitotic progenitors, enlarges regenerative capacity and\napparently restricts horizontal growth. This structural accom-\nmodation could disrupt progenitor fluidity within the\nproliferative matrix and misdirect radial migration unless\nGanciclovir-induced apoptosis is accompanied by a transient\nshift in the dominant cleavage plane of mitotic cells in the\ndorsal pallial ventricular zone, which may contribute to the\nearly replacement of GPT neuroblasts in ablated mice by\nthe symmetric division of their non-GPT progenitors (Sanada\nand Tsai, 2005). However, this shift may also reflect a\ndissociation of cellular cleavage and division planes (Konno et\nal., 2008) that subserves a compensatory modification of\nradial migration. Dying GPT neurons in ablated mice enter an\nimpaired migratory framework within a regenerating neuro-\nepithelial matrix (Xie et al., 2002). The vertical cleavage plane\nmay derail them from the outward-bound track of radial\nmigration, confine them to the malleable ventricular zone\nand benefit the laminar assembly of ablated neocortex by\nsparing the marginal and mantle zones from the clearance of\nexcessive killed cells.\nDelayed preplate formation blocks projection\naxons from GPT neurons in ablated mice\nA second unexpected finding is that GPT neurons in ablated\nmice conserve all of the definitive morphogenetic properties\nof the principal prelate neurons except one: they emit few\npioneer projection axons, which consist mainly of corticotha-\nlamic fibres in normal mice (Jacobs et al., 2007). Sparse\nresidual projections arise from GPT neurons generated before\nganciclovir treatment, whereas surviving and replacement\nGPT neurons retain the capacity to emit local infracortical\naxons. Preplate formation is delayed in ablated mice due to\nreplacement of killed GPT neurons. By inference, we conclude\nthat this delayed settlement is an unavoidable timing error\nthat desynchronizes the development of neocortex and\nthalamus, and arrests the outgrowth of axonal projections\nby GPT neurons. The mechanism underlying projection\nblockade is uncertain, but this outcome has significant\nimplications for the `handshake hypothesis' often used to\nexplain the midcourse contact and subsequent guidance to\ncellular targets of developing, reciprocal corticothalamic and\nthalamocortical projections (Lopez-Bendito and Molnar,\n2003). The primary defect of ablated mice is restricted to\nthe principal preplate neurons, unlike Tbr1and Pax6 mutants\npreplate neurons in ablated mice do not emit substantial,\nalbeit unstable, projections that approach the pallial-\nsubpallial boundary, unlike Coup-tfi mutants (Zhou et al.,\n1999). Thus ablated mice provide a novel opportunity to\ndissect apart the elements of the `handshake hypothesis'\nbecause preplate neurons, a distal target for thalamocortical\naxons, are restored at an excessive local density, whereas\npreplate projections, a proximal target for thalamocortical\naxons, are never established.\nThe middle and deep laminae of the principal preplate\nneurons in control mice are well-situated to guide ingrowth\nof `specific' thalamocortical axons for termination in neuropil\narcades at the superficial and deep borders of infragranular\npyramidal neurons in sensory neocortex (Molnar and\nBoth afferents and arcades are grossly diminished in ablated\nmice, which contribute to the dyslaminated appearance of\nneocortex despite the conserved laminar organization of its\nneuronal cell bodies. It is reasonable to speculate that\ninadequate thalamocortical connections, as well as their lack\nof pioneer corticothalamic projection axons, accelerate the\ndiffuse, late-onset apoptosis of GPT neurons (Cowan et al.,\n1984), whereas spared infracortical connections are sufficient\nto support the survival of many non-GPT pyramidal neurons.\nThese surviving neurons do not generate significant seizure\nactivity in ablated mice, perhaps because of their isolation\nwithin an impaired neocortex that is, in turn, isolated from\nthe rest of the brain.\n"
