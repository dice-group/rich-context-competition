Mokdad, PhD\nBackground--Recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated guidance on lipid screening in childhood. Our\nobjective was to examine recent distributions in concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol among US children and adolescents and to estimate the prevalence of adolescents who are potentially eligible\nfor pharmacological treatment for elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\nMethods and Results--We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2006 for\nparticipants 6 to 17 years of age. The mean concentration for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol for participants 12 to\nyears of age was 163.0 mg/dL (n9868). Depending on the cut points used, an elevated concentration of low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol was noted for 5.2% to 6.6% of participants and an elevated concentration of total cholesterol for\n9.6% to 10.7%. Approximately 0.8% of adolescents 12 to 17 years of age were potentially eligible for pharmacological\ntreatment for elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\nConclusion--Given current guidelines, only a small percentage of US adolescents may need pharmacological treatment for\nKey Words: cholesterol  epidemiology  lipids  pediatrics  prevention\nThe roots of coronary heart disease herald back to child-\nhood. Autopsy studies have demonstrated the presence of\nearly lesions of coronary heart disease in the heart vessels of\nchildren and adolescents.1 Furthermore, the presence of these\nchanges correlated with known risk factors for cardiovascular\ndisease, including concentrations of low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol and total cholesterol.2,3 In addition, concentrations\nof low-density lipoprotein cholesterol predict subclinical\natherosclerosis as determined by carotid intima-media thick-\nness in adults.4,5 In recognition of the role of dyslipidemia in\nthe early genesis of coronary heart disease, the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently released a report on\nlipid screening in childhood.6\nIn that report, thresholds for defining hypercholesterolemia\nand elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were sum-\nmarized. One set of values were derived from a report from\nthe National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in 1992.\nAnother set of values were derived from data from the Lipid\nResearch Clinics Prevalence Study. Previous publications\nhave provided important information about lipid concentra-\ntions in children and adolescents.7\u00ad14 However, much of that\ninformation is 10 years old. Therefore, our objective was to\nprovide updated information about concentrations of low-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol in chil-\ndren and adolescents in the United States.\nMethods\nWe used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\na multistage, stratified sampling design. The surveys were designed\nto produce results representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US\npopulation. Participants were interviewed at home and were invited to\nattend a mobile examination center, where they were asked to complete\nadditional questionnaires, undergo various examinations, and provide a\nblood sample. The surveys received human subject approval. Parental\npermission to allow a child to participate in the survey was obtained, as\nwell as assent from children and adolescents 7 to 17 years of age.\nParticipants 18 years of age were asked to sign an informed consent\nform. Details about the survey may be found elsewhere.15\nMeasurements of concentrations of total serum cholesterol were\nconducted for participants 3 years of age for NHANES 1999 to\n2006. For analyses involving concentrations of total cholesterol, we\nincluded all participants who had a measurement regardless of\nfasting status. Measurements of fasting serum concentrations of\nFrom the Division of Adult and Community Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, Atlanta, Ga.\nThe findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and do not represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention.\nCorrespondence to Earl Ford, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Hwy, MS K66, Atlanta, GA 30341.

In 2006, serum cholesterol was\nmeasured enzymatically on a Hitachi 912 Analyzer. We used the 2\napproaches presented in the AAP guidelines to define elevated\nconcentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cho-\ncut points derived from data from the Lipid Research Clinics\nPediatric Prevalence Study.6 The cut points based on the NECP\nguidelines are 200 mg/dL for total cholesterol and 130 mg/dL for\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The cut points for abnormal\nconcentrations of total cholesterol based on the 95th percentile in the\nLipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study are 201 mg/dL for boys 10\n19 years of age. The cut points for low-density lipoprotein choles-\ncholesterol were measured by both the heparin-manganese precipi-\ntation method and the direct immunoassay method. A change in the\nmethod for measuring concentrations of high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol took place in 2003 when, from then on, concentrations of\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured only with the\ndirect immunoassay method.17 Concurrent with this change in\nmethods, measurements of concentrations of high-density lipopro-\nlipoprotein cholesterol were calculated, the upward bias in concen-\ntrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol may have resulted in\na slight lowering of the calculated values for low-density lipoprotein\nUsing the approach presented in the AAP report, we estimated\nthe percentage of adolescents 12 to 17 years of age whose\nelevated concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol\npotentially qualified them for pharmacological treatment.6 The\nAAP uses 3 thresholds for elevated concentrations of low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol to determine the need for pharmacological\nmanagement of the dyslipidemia. If a patient does not have a risk\nfactor (obesity, hypertension, cigarette smoking, family history of\npremature cardiovascular disease, or diabetes mellitus), pharma-\ncological management can be considered when concentrations of\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol exceed 190 mg/dL. In the\npresence of risk factors (obesity, hypertension, cigarette smoking,\nor family history of premature cardiovascular disease), pharma-\ncological management can be considered when concentrations of\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol exceed 160 mg/dL. In the\npresence of diabetes mellitus, pharmacological management can\nbe considered when concentrations of low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol equal or exceed 130 mg/dL.\nObesity was defined as a body mass index 95th percentile\ndetermined from the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion Growth Charts.18 The recommendations of the Fourth Report on\nthe Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in\nChildren and Adolescents were used to define hypertension.19\nConcentrations of cotinine were used to establish smoking status. A\nconcentration 10 ng/mL was considered smoking.20 Participants\nwho had a fasting plasma concentration of glucose 126 mg/dL or\nreported using insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents were classified as\nhaving diabetes. Demographic covariates included in the analyses\nwere age, sex, race, or ethnicity (white, black, Mexican American,\nother).\nGenerally, analyses involving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were\nlimited to participants 12 to 17 years of age and analyses involving total\ncholesterol to those 6 to 17 years of age. In addition, we analyzed data\nof total cholesterol for participants as young as 3 years of age and as old\nas 19 years of age and to make comparisons with previously published\ninformation concerning concentrations of total cholesterol and low-\ncalculated means and percentages with elevated concentrations of lipids.\nFor race- or ethnic-specific estimates, we present results for only the 3\nmajor groups (whites, blacks, Mexican Americans). Differences in\nproportions and means were tested with 2 tests and t tests, respectively.\nMultiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the\nstatistical significance of the effects of age, gender, and ethnicity on\nconcentrations of lipids. Log-binomial regression analysis was used to\nexamine the effects of age, gender, and ethnicity on the prevalence of\nelevated concentrations of lipids.

Because of\nthe small magnitude of these percentages, detailed analyses\nfor possible determinants were not feasible. Of the 26\nadolescents who qualified for pharmacological treatment, 11\nhad a concentration 190 mg/dL (4 also had at least 1 risk\nfactor, and 1 participant had a risk factor and diabetes), and\n15 had at least 1 risk factor and a concentration 160 mg/dL.\nOnly 1 participant 16 years of age reported using a choles-\nterol-lowering medication, in this case cholestyramine.\nDiscussion\nThe recent lipid screening recommendations issued by the\nAAP have drawn new attention to the importance of healthy\nlipid concentrations in children and adolescents. Our analysis\nof recent national data from the United States indicates that,\ndepending on the cut points used, 5.2% to 6.6% of adoles-\ncents 12 to 17 years of age had elevated concentrations of\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, 0.8% of\nsuch adolescents would qualify for lipid-lowering treatment\nbased on the AAP guidelines.\nAlthough the difference in age groups limits the possible\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the Lipid Research\nClinic Pediatric Prevalence Study for adolescents 15 to 19 years\ncomparison, the percentiles calculated with NHANES 1999 to\npercentiles for girls are in close agreement between the 2 sets of\nTable 3.

An unfavorable effect of obesity on concen-\ntrations of lipids in children has been demonstrated.21 Beside the\npossible effects of temporal trends, differences in characteristics\nof the study populations and laboratory methods further compli-\ncate comparisons between the 2 sets of data.\nSeveral major studies, including the Muscatine Study, Lipid\nResearch Clinics Prevalence Study, Bogalusa Heart Study, and\nNHANES, have provided important information about concen-\ntrations of lipids in children and adolescents in the United\nStates.7\u00ad14 These studies have yielded important information\nabout age, gender, and ethnic differences in concentrations of\nlipids. In addition, critical insights into the tracking of concen-\ntrations of lipids have been gleaned from these studies.22\u00ad24 Data\ndetailed information about concentrations of lipids in children\nand adolescents in the United States.13 The authors provided\nmeans and various percentiles of lipid distributions but did not\nprovide estimates of the prevalence of elevated concentrations of\nlipids. The 90th percentile for participants 4 to 19 years of age in\nthat survey was 200 mg/dL, which is the same as in NHANES\nwe also observed that concentrations of total cholesterol peaked\naround 8 to 10 years of age. No age-related differences in\nconcentrations of total cholesterol were reported from the Mus-\ncatine Study.7 In NHANES III, concentrations of total choles-\nterol were higher in female than male participants.13 In addition,\nTable 4.
