    "reduced_content": "Is Altruistic Behavior Associated with Major Depression\nOnset?\nTakeo Fujiwara*\nSection of Behavioral Science, Department of Health Promotion and Research, National Institute of Public Health, Wako-shi, Saitama, Japan\n Introduction\nThe estimated prevalence of depression was 9.6% in the United\nStates. This prevalence was the highest among 14 countries (6 less\ndeveloped and 8 developed) in the World Health Organization\nWorld Mental Health Initiative [1]. The burden of depression in\nthe United States is estimated to be $43.7 billion [2]. By examining\nrisk and protective factors, it would be possible to determine what\ntypes of behaviors are related to the development of depression.\nOne type of behavior to be examined are altruistic behaviors (AB),\nwhich is defined as ``behavior intended to benefit another, even\nwhen this risks possible sacrifice to the welfare of the actor'' [3].\nAccording to positive psychology, AB can regulate people's\nperception of those internal and external realities they are\npowerless to change, and empower them to effect meaningful\nchange [4]. Literature on caregiving suggests that the caregiver,\nwho is considered as an actor of AB, might receive rewards due to\nthe perception of doing something good for others [5]. On the\nother hand, the actor of AB might feel stressed when the sacrifice\nof the actor is too large.\nPrevious studies reporting a link between AB and mental health\nshowed mixed directions. Schwartz et al. (2003) found that those\nwho do something for others showed better mental health.\nFujiwara (2007) reported that altruistic behavior had a tendency\nto protect generalized anxiety disorder, but was harmful for major\ndepression (MD). However, these studies used cross-sectional\ndesign. Brown et al reported more beneficial effects of providing\nsocial support than receiving it by prospective study [6]; however,\nas they measured the outcome as mortality, the impact on mental\nhealth remains uncertain. In addition, the impacts of AB on\nmental health depending on the types of AB were not well-\nreported. In the study of AB towards children and grandchildren\nby parents and grandparents, fathers and grandfathers who\nprovide moderate amounts of informal assistance and financial\nsupport to children and grandchildren were protected to develop\nMD in 2\u00ad3 years, although not among mothers and grandmothers\n[7]. Thus, there is a need to investigate the impact of AB towards\nothers (i.e., non-family member) on the development of MD of AB\nproviders. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of\nAB toward others on the development of MD prospectively.\nMethods\nParticipants\nFor baseline data, the author reanalyzed the publicly-available\nNational Survey of Midlife Development in the United States\ntive, interdisciplinary investigation of the patterns, predictors, and\nconsequences of midlife development in the areas of physical\nhealth, psychological well-being, and social functioning [8],\nalthough the author was not involved in the original study.\nRespondents were selected from a nationally representative,\nrandom digit dial sample of non-institutionalized, English-\nspeaking adults, between 25 and 74 years of age, selected from\nworking telephone banks in the coterminous United States.\nDetailed information regarding the MIDUS study has been\npublished previously [9]. The sample for the current analysis\nincludes original MIDUS respondents who completed both the\ntelephone survey (response rate 70 percent), which included\ndemographic characteristics and Composite International Diag-\nnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF) based diagnoses of MD, as\nwell as the postal questionnaire (response rate 87 percent), which\ncaptured information related to AB. The combined response rate\nfor both the telephone survey and the postal questionnaire was\n60.8%. Follow-up data was obtained using the Psychological\nprimary objective of the follow-up study was to explore how adults\nperceive psychological change in their lives. This study was a\nrandom telephone follow-up of 724 respondents of the original\nMIDUS random-digit-dial sample (82% response rate among 883\nparticipants selected from the original MIDUS survey who were\nre-contacted). After explaining the study to the informant, a\nhousehold listing was generated of people in the age range of 25 to\n74, and a random respondent was selected. Men and older people\nwere oversampled. To see the impact of AB on the development of\nMD in later life, respondents who had MD at baseline were\nexcluded from analysis sample, resulting in N = 639. In addition,\nto adjust for possible selection bias and differential non-responses,\nsampling weights were applied for all analysis yielding weighted\nAssessment of Major Depression\nMIDUS researchers assessed MD in both the original and follow-\nup study using CIDI-SF [11]. The diagnosis of MD was based on\ndefinitions and criteria specified in the DSM-III-R, comprised of 19\nitems [12]. A diagnosis of MD requires a period of at least two weeks\nof either depressed mood or anhedonia most of the day, nearly every\nday, and a series of at least four other associated symptoms typically\nfound to accompany depression, including problems with eating,\nsleeping, energy, concentration, feelings of low self-worth, and\nsuicidal thoughts or actions. MD was assessed by telephone\ninterview in both the original and follow up surveys. In the original\nMIDUS survey, the time frame for inquiring about MD symptoms\nwas the previous 12 months, while in the follow-up MIDUS survey,\nMD items inquired about the past 5 years to capture all depressive\nepisodes during follow-up. The test-retest reliability and clinical\nvalidity of CIDI-SF diagnoses have previously been examined and\nfound to be high [13]. Psychometric properties are also acceptable:\nsensitivity was 0.73 and specificity was 0.82 in comparison with\nsemi-structured clinical diagnostic interview [14]. Moreover, the\nMD scales employed in the present study were used in a previous\npublication, where it was based upon the responses of the MIDUS\nMeasurement of Altruistic Behaviors\nAB was measured by mail-in questionnaire in three dimensions:\nunpaid assistance, emotional support, and financial support.\nUnpaid assistance was assessed by asking the following question:\n``On average, about how many hours per month do you spend\nproviding unpaid assistance, such as help around the house,\ntransportation, or childcare, to anyone else other than family\nmembers or close friends?'' Emotional support was assessed by the\nfollowing question: ``On average, about how many hours per month\ndo you spend giving informal emotional support, such as\ncomforting, listening to problems, or giving advice to anyone else\nother than family members or close friends?'' For the question of\nunpaid assistance and emotional support, respondents answered by\nthe number of hours. Financial support was measured by the\nfollowing question: ``On average, about how many dollars per\nmonth do you or your family living with you contribute to any\nindividuals other than family members or close friends, including\npeople on the street asking for money? If you contribute food,\nclothing or other goods, include their dollar value.'' Respondents\nanswered by the amount of dollars. AB measurements were further\ncategorized into three, non-AB, low AB, and high AB. First, those\nwho did not engage in AB were categorized as non-AB. Second,\nthose who provided AB were divided into two groups, low AB and\nhigh AB. Cut-off of low and high AB was decided based on their\ndistributions. Consequently, unpaid assistance was categorized as 0,\n1\u00ad2, and 3 or more hours/months; weighted distribution was\ncategorized as 0, 1\u00ad4 and 5 or more hours/month; weighted\nsupport was divided into 0, 1\u00ad9 dollars and 10 and more dollars per\nMeasurement of potential confounders\nBased on previous findings [7,15,17], age, sex, race, education,\nworking status, and marital status were considered as potential\nconfounders of the association between AB and MD. Age was\nfor further analysis. Race was categorized as Whites, Blacks, and\nOthers (Native American, Aleutian Islander/Eskimo, Asian,\nPacific Islanders, multiracial, or other). Education was categorized\ninto 4 groups: less than high school, graduated high school, some\ncollege, and graduate college or more. Working status was\ncategorized as full-time working, retired, homemaker, and\nunemployed. Marital status was categorized as married, separated,\ndivorced, widowed, and unmarried.\nTable 1. Characteristics of sample (weighted N = 563).\nWeighted %\nWorking Status Full-time working 62.9\nAltruism and Depression\nStatistical Analysis\nFirst, association between AB and demographic variables were\nexamined by ordered logistic regression. Second, unadjusted and\nadjusted odds ratio of AB at baseline on MD in follow-up were\ncalculated. In adjusted model, all AB measurements and\ndemographic variables were included as explanatory variables. It\nis assumed that the association has an independent and significant\neffect if P,0.05 (two-sided). All analyses were undertaken using\nStata SE, version 9 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas).\nResults\nDemographic characteristics and prevalence of MD in 1998 of\nthe study sample were shown in Table 1. Regarding demographic\ncharacteristics, 55 percent of the sample was women, 86 percent\nwhite, 90 percent high school graduates or more, 63 percent full-\ntime workers, and 75 percent married. Among those who did not\nTable 2 shows the weighted odds ratio of demographic\ncharacteristics on AB. Higher education level was associated with\nproviding unpaid assistance and emotional support. High school\ngraduates, some college, college or more graduates were\nsignificantly providing unpaid assistance in comparison with those\nwho did not graduate high school. Similarly, some college and\ncollege or more graduates showed a higher likelihood of providing\nemotional support, compared with those who did not graduate\nhigh school. However, financial support was not associated with\neducation level. Older age groups were less likely to provide\nunpaid assistance and emotional support; while no such\nassociation was found for financial support. Race as other (Native\nAmerican, Aleutian Islander/Eskimo, Asian, Pacific Islander,\nmultiracial, or other) than white or black were 4.3 times more\nlikely to provide financial support compared with whites (95% CI:\n1.86\u00ad9.86). Separated marital status were associated with higher\nprovision of financial support (odds ratio [OR]: 3.58, 95% CI:\n1.28\u00ad10.0). Gender and working status were not associated with\nany type of AB.\nTable 3 describes weighted unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio\nof AB on MD in 2\u00ad3 years later. Unpaid assistance, emotional\nsupport, and financial support were not associated with MD in\nunadjusted model. However, in adjusted model, financial support\nwere significantly associated with MD onset: those who provide 10\nor more dollars/month to anyone else other than family member\nor close friend were 2.6 times significantly more likely to develop\nassistance was not associated with MD onset in adjusted model:\nalthough point estimate showed a protective direction. Emotional\nsupport was not associated with MD onset either, although point\nestimate showed harmful direction.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this analysis showed that the effect of AB on the\ndevelopment of MD varied by type of AB. Financial support was\nharmful in terms of MD development, while other ABs (i.e.,\nTable 2.

The\ndemand of financial support by others can be endless. Thus,\nfinancial support providers might be easily overwhelmed by\nconstantly giving, and as a result, develop MD. Furthermore, the\ntiming of receiving something in return for providing financial\nsupport may be delayed. That is, when people give some money to\nothers, they expect something in return not necessarily from the\nreceiver of the money, but some form of compensation for\nexhibiting good behaviors (i.e. financial support to others), such as\nreputation or status [18,19]. On the contrary, people providing\nemotional support would receive rewards, such as sense of\nmeaning or purpose, directly through providing emotional\nsupport, which reduces the likelihood of developing MD [20].\nThus, emotional support did not show significant negative effects\non the development of MD, as the providing emotional support\nmight be diluted by the rewards of contribution to improve others'\nemotion.\nIn addition, financial supporters might feel guilty, as it is\nsuggested that the feeling of guilt promotes altruistic behavior [21].\nPrevious research also showed that the feeling of guilt, which is\nassociated with religious strain, would lead to MD development\n[22]. That is, those who did not provide financial support don't\nfeel guilt for not providing financial support, while those who\nprovide financial support might feel guilt for not providing\nfinancial support [23]. As the amount of financial support is\nrelative, those who feel guilt may not resolve their feeling of guilt\nthrough financial support. As the feeling of guilt is associated with\nnegative emotions [24], financial support would have a harmful\neffect on the development of MD.\nPrevious research has shown the positive effect of providing\nfinancial support to children or grand children: for fathers or\ngrandfathers who provide financial support were less likely to develop\nMD in later life [7]. The differential effect of providing financial\nsupport to others and family members can be explained by changes to\nthe self-esteem. For fathers and grandfathers, they would think of\nTable 3.

On the contrary, it would be difficult to\ndevelop higher self-esteem through financial support to others, as the\namount can be unlimited and is relative, as mentioned above [25].\nHowever, the current study did not measure the feeling of guilt or self-\nesteem through AB among respondents. Further research looking at\nthe psychological mechanism of the effect of financial support on MD\nis recommended.\nIn this research, 10 dollars was used as the cut-off of financial\nsupport for better distribution for analysis. Although the amount of\n10 dollars or more a month is a fairly small amount, it was found\nthat providing such a small amount had was associated with the\ndevelopment of MD. The distribution of the amounts given by the\nrespondents among those who provide 10 dollar or more were: 10\nsquare test: p = 0.84, data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that\noutliers drive the findings.\nOn the contrary, although not statistically significant, unpaid\nassistance was in protective direction on MD onset. One possible\nexplanation for the mental health benefits of unpaid assistance could\nbe related to AB's nature of caring for others and focus outside of the\nself, which might nullify the self-focused nature of depression.\nSchwartz and Sendor proposed that the process of AB facilitates\nchanging of internal standards, values, or conceptualization of quality\nof life [26]. However, previous studies showed limited evidence of the\neffect of volunteer activity on prevention of MD [16]. The differential\neffect on MD between unpaid assistance and volunteer activity might\nbe due to the difference of focus, whether outside the self or not;\npeople might join a volunteer activity from an achievement-oriented\negocentricity, rather than focusing outside the self.\nThe current research has several limitations. First, the sample\nsize was relatively small which might explain the marginal\nsignificance level of the effect of unpaid assistance and emotional\nsupport on MD. Further research using a larger representative\nsample is needed to replicate the findings. Second, AB used in this\nstudy was not validated in other studies. AB was measured\nnumerically by type of AB (i.e. hours or dollars spent per month);\nhowever, whether the motivation of AB truly comes from an\nintention to do something for others was not measured. Third, the\nauthor could not adjust for all the possible covariates which\ninfluence the onset of MD. For example, if the author could\ninclude feeling of guilt or religious strain for doing AB as\ncovariates, the results may change. Fourth, the author could not\nassess other types of AB, such as encouragement of others or giving\nuseful information. As specific types of AB were associated with\nMD, it is needed to investigate the association between a wider\nrange of AB and MD. Fifth, it is not known whether AB was done\non demand or initiated by provider. If the AB was initiated by\nprovider, the provider might feel a sense of control, which has a\npositive effect on mental health [27]. But if the AB was done on\ndemand, the provider might not feel a sense of control. Sixth, with\nregard to outcome measures, it would be better to diagnose MD\nusing DSM-IV, which is currently used. In addition, other types of\nmental disorders which are associated with psychological distress,\nsuch as generalized anxiety and panic disorders, were not used in\nthe present study, as a follow-up to the MIDUS study measured\nMD only. Nonetheless, this study has several strengths which\ninclude being based on a nationally representative sample of\nmiddle aged adults in the US, its longitudinal design, the exclusion\nof those who have MD at baseline, and the use of a validated\nclinical diagnostic tool (CIDI-SF).\nThe findings of the effects of AB on MD have implications for\nmental health practice. First, randomized controlled trial to test\nthe protective effect of unpaid assistance on development of MD\nneeds to be implemented. In addition, the harmful effect of\nproviding emotional and financial support should be considered as\nrisk factors of MD in clinical and health care settings.\nIn conclusion, this study suggested the importance of AB on\nMD development. It is found that providing unpaid assistance had\na protective effect on MD in 2\u00ad3 years later, while provision of\nemotional and financial support had harmful effect on MD.\nFurther studies, including larger cohort studies or randomized\ncontrolled trials, are needed to elucidate the mechanism of the\nassociation between AB and MD.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: TF.
