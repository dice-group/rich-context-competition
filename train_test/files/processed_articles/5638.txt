Several demographic variables were evalu-\nated. While the study did not yield as many differences as\nexpected, it is conclusive that important differences do exist;\nthe results are important because school funding decision\nmakers must find common ground to equitably and ade-\nquately fund education for every child.\nIntroduction\nSchool finance is not a new problem in the United States nor\nis it a new problem in the state of Alabama. It has been in\nexistence and evolving since the beginning of public educa-\ntion. During the 2004 democratic presidential primaries,\nSenator John Edwards struck a chord with voters and educa-\ntors when he spoke of \"two Americas: one for the wealthy\nand privileged, another for those not so lucky\" (Bartolomeo,\nLikewise, since the beginning of the school finance\ndebate, researchers have found spending differences between\ntax-wealthy school districts and those poorer districts with\nlimited tax capacity. Students and schools may be short-\nchanged in the quality of education because of the lack of\nfinancial resources. In a study of New York City schools,\nBartolomeo (2004) analyzed the inequities teachers and stu-\ndents experienced due to the funding divide. Bartolomeo\nfound that poorer districts in New York had higher turnover,\nfewer textbooks, more unsafe conditions and older buildings\nwhen compared with their wealthier counterparts elsewhere\nin the state. Class sizes in the poor districts were 30 to 35\ncompared with the wealthier districts' class sizes of 15 to 25.\nThe results of this study provided evidence that a strong tax\nbase resulted in more funding, afforded better programs,\nhigher quality textbooks and more manageable class sizes.\nAsimilar study found that the majority of students who are\nclassified as having the greatest needs and a higher cost to\neducate tend to live in poor districts (Moran, 1999). These\ncostly students more often than not reside in property-poor\ndistricts; this creates a greater obstacle for district leaders to\ngenerate sufficient local taxes to meet their educational needs.\nSchool finance in Alabama presents problems similar to\nthose in other parts of the country. Many believe that current\nfunding issues in the education system are rife with inequity\nand the lack of equal opportunity for students from different\nattributed the lack of opportunities to the differences in funds\ncollected by the individual school districts. These problems,\nwhile not new, remain unsolved.\nIn Alabama, the budgeting process is spelled out in state\nlaw.

These are primarily\n1Alabama State Department of Education, Montgomery, USA\n2Samford University, Birmingham, AL, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nThomas W Woolley, OBB School of Education and Professional Studies,\nEmail: twwoolle@samford.edu\nSchool Funding Issues: State Legislators\nand School Superintendents--Adversaries\nor Allies?\nWarren C.

When the economy is growing, there tends to be\nadditional revenue. When the economy slows down, the\nEducation Trust Fund has a hard time meeting existing finan-\ncial obligations.\nThe Alabama Education Trust Fund provides the financial\nresources that support the legislatively approved minimum\neducational programs for each district and each student\nthroughout the state. Any additional program offered by a\ndistrict that is above and beyond what the state mandates is a\nresult of the expenditure of local tax dollars. Some districts\nhave the potential to generate greater amounts of local taxes;\ntherefore, they can offer enriched learning opportunities over\ntax poorer districts.\nLocal school districts have very limited authority to\nimpose additional taxes for educational purposes without\nfirst gaining full support of the Alabama Legislature.\nStatewide legislation only allows county commissions to\nlevy limited county and district school taxes. If a district\nwishes to exceed that amount, they must secure a three-fifths\nvote of the House and Senate delegation to have a proposed\nconstitutional amendment placed on a ballot for a statewide\nvote, and then a majority of state voters is required for its\npassage. As a result, funding for education in Alabama relies\nheavily on legislators and local superintendents who work\nwith legislators to determine funding priorities. The deci-\nsion-making process of these groups of individuals is influ-\nenced by internal and external factors that affect their belief\nsystems. This study investigates how these belief systems\ninfluence the decisions of legislators and superintendents.\nLiterature Review\nFunding\nThe politics of school funding tend to blend philosophical,\nsocial, and economic differences into a structure recognized\nas \"free public schools.\" It is impossible to separate educa-\ntion funding from resources. The level of funding drives not\nonly the quantity but also the quality of resources available\nto create public educational opportunities.\nThe success or failure of schools is strongly connected to\nthe financial support made available to them through the\nlevying of taxes and the allocation of revenues (Harvey,\n1989). In this regard, major legal decisions have occurred in\nAlabama affecting the educational funding throughout the\nstate. To understand where the state is today, it is important\nto know where it was in past years.\nHistorical Events in Alabama That Held Funding\nImplications\nThree major legal decisions that affected education fund-\ning in Alabama have all centered on the state's right to\ndefine what is appropriate legislative support of school\nfunding.\nThe 1950s were an extremely volatile time in Alabama\nhistory. In an attempt to avoid desegregation of public\nschools, the Alabama Legislature amended the 1901\nserved as the basis upon which the State of Alabama pro-\nvides funding for schools based on its available revenue. It\nalso eliminates any obligation to the needs or quality of those\neducational opportunities (Harvey, 2000).\nSince the 1950s, proration of educational funding has\nbeen a major factor in the history of Alabama. Proration in\nthe Education Trust Fund has been declared 17 times since\n1950; 15 times it continued until the end of the fiscal year, an\naverage of once every 3.66 years.\nThe second legal factor that continues to influence legisla-\ntion and policy decisions in Alabama was the 1973 ruling by\ntheU.S.SupremeCourtonthecaseofSanAntoniov.Rodriquez,\nwhere the court ruled that public schooling was not a right\nguaranteed under the United States Constitution (Schrag,\n2004). This ruling essentially assigned obligations for any kind\nof an education to the states, where it remains today.\nThe third and most significant legal factor that trans-\nformed the state funding scheme from what was known as\n\"The Minimum Program,\" prior to 1995, to the current fund-\ning scheme known as \"The Foundation Program\" was\nAlabama Coalition for Equity v. Hunt (1993). In an effort to\nmore clearly define the state's obligation to provide equita-\nble and adequate educational opportunities, 33 school sys-\ntems sued the State of Alabama in Ace v. Hunt (1993). This\ncourt action resulted in the creation of a declaration in which\nthe judge stated, \"that education is a fundamental right under\nthe Alabama Constitution.\" This ruling forced the legislature\nto adopt a different method of distributing state funds (Ward\nThe final disposition of this case was never completed to\nthe extent of defining and implementing a funding scheme\nbased on a set of defined outcomes, as many similar cases in\nother states were able to accomplish. Instead, it ended in\n2002. While considering a totally unrelated educational mat-\nter, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that it was not the\ncourt's responsibility to insure equity and adequacy of the\nschools in Alabama. According to the Court, that responsibil-\nity rests in the authority of theAlabama legislature (Siegelman\nv. Alabama Association of School Boards, 2001). This ruling\nestablished the legal precedent that legislators control the\nfunding of public schools.\nThe major outcome of these three cases was that the legal\nresponsibility for school funding rests with the states. States\nhave a responsibility to provide equitable education for all\ncitizens, and legislators control the allocation of funds for\nschools. Thus, legislators are the key to school funding\nequity in the state.\nThe Evolution of Adequacy\nHistorically, states have focused on how to allocate funding\nacross school districts. Calculating revenues and how they\nPouncey et al. 3\nare distributed to school districts are complicated issues and\ndifficult to understand. Recently, the focus has changed from\nequity to adequacy and over the past 30 years, state courts\nhave played a significant role in shaping education finance\npolicy. Legal challenges to finance formulas have been\nMany of the early cases centered on \"equity.\" Equity was\ndefined as funding every child throughout the state in an\nequal manner (Smith & Pettersen, 2002). Alabama changed\nits funding distribution method in 1995 to accomplish this\ntype of equity. Known as the \"Foundation Program,\" the\nfunding scheme dictated the distribution of state dollars\nequitably on a per pupil or per teacher basis to every district\nIn a report released by Public Affairs Research Council of\nAlabama (PARCA), Williams (2006) reported that a founda-\ntion program tries to do three things:\n1. Define the components of an adequate K-12 educa-\ntion and the cost of providing them to ensure that\nevery student, no matter where he or she lives, has an\nadequate educational opportunity.\n2. Encourage an appropriate level of local tax support\nfor every public school system to promote local own-\nership and to recognize the benefits of good schools\nto the community.\n3. Distribute state funds in a way that meets these objec-\ntives so that everyone pays a fair share of the burden\nof supporting high-quality public schools throughout\nthe state.\nAlabama's Foundation Program was established to com-\nbine both state and local funds to support the standard educa-\ntional program defined by state laws. These resources are\nmade available to every local school system, in the following\nway: First, the resources necessary for the standard program\nare calculated. In Alabama, these are defined in terms of\nnumbers of teachers and other professionals, plus amounts\nfor their salaries and fringe benefits, five types of classroom\ninstructional support and other operating expenses. These\ncomponents are then summed to determine the allocation to\neach school system for the cost of the foundation program.\nSecond, a minimum level of local tax support is required for\nevery school system. The idea is that the local community\nshould pay a fair share of the cost of the foundation program.\nIn Alabama, every school system must contribute 10 mills of\nlocal property tax support to the foundation program. This\nproduces more local funds per student in some school sys-\ntems than in others, primarily because property uses and val-\nues vary across the state. Third, the local share is subtracted\nfrom the defined cost of the foundation program. The remain-\nder is paid by the state. The subtraction is larger for school\nsystems in communities that have the ability to raise large\nsums locally. This means that the state pays a smaller share\nof the cost of the foundation program for such \"wealthy\"\nsystems, and a larger share of the cost where local taxing\ncapacity is low. The subtraction therefore helps to ensure that\nthe foundation program is affordable in every community\nPARCA's report (Williams, 2006) on Alabama's\nFoundation Program validated the benefits of this method of\nfunding schools. Prior to the adoption of the Foundation\nProgram, the state distributed its funds to school systems\nwith very little consideration of local tax capacity.\nThe Budgeting Process\nIn the budgeting process, the State of Alabama requires that\nthe state superintendent develop a budget proposal for con-\nsideration for the State Board of Education. Once adopted,\nthe budget is submitted to the Governor, who then makes it\npart of the budget proposal that is presented for approval to\nthe Alabama Legislature. The legislature can approve it in\nwhole, or they may choose to modify various segments of the\nproposal.\nThe budgeting process has become increasingly complex.\nAs states attempt to establish some form of equity in school\nfunding, many factors complicate the process. Differences in\nlocal tax capacity continue to allow some school districts to\nprovide more services than others. The addition of standards\nand a means of measuring whether a district has met those\neducational standards have heightened the awareness of a\nneed for adequacy. The connection of standards to funding\nfurther adds to the complexity of the budgeting process.\nState's Role and Components of an Adequate\nFunding Scheme\nIn the past, states have allocated funds across school dis-\ntricts, each of which has different tax bases, in a manner to\nachieve some level of parity. States have paid far less atten-\ntion to the results each district has produced (Hunter, 2004).\nIn a review of literature on school finance, Theobald\n(2000) listed the following three goals for any proposed\nchange to a state's education finance system: (a) education\nfinance systems should facilitate a substantially higher level\nof achievement for all students, while using resources in a\ncost-effective manner; (b) education finance systems should\nfacilitate efforts to break the nexus between student back-\nground characteristics and student achievement; and (c) edu-\ncation finance systems should generate revenues in a fair and\nefficient manner. In many states, the responsibility has been\nplaced on legislators to determine performance goals and\nestablish funding accordingly. Alabama has yet to embrace\nthat obligation.\nModels for Adequate Spending Levels\nSince the 1983 publication of A Nation at Risk (Education\nCommission of the States, 1983), there has been a growing\n4 SAGE Open\nrecognition by policy analysts, policy makers, and the courts\nthat an equal distribution of resources will not close the\nachievement gaps among ethnic and socioeconomic groups.\nThis is particularly true if the amount of resources distributed\nequitably is not sufficient to provide the instructional\nresources required to eliminate those gaps. Thus, consider-\nation of equity issues increasingly has been approached from\nthe perspective of adequacy (King, Swanson, & Sweetland,\n2005). Other researchers have elaborated by blending suffi-\nciency with desired outcomes in defining adequate financing\nas sufficient resources to provide students with the opportu-\nnity to achieve adequately defined levels of knowledge and\nThere are four primary models used to determine ade-\nquate educational spending levels, including the Professional\nJudgment Model, the Successful Schools Model, the\nAdvanced Statistical Model, and the Evidence-Based\nApproach Model (King et al., 2005). These four models can\nprovide policy makers options for considerations that utilize\nmeasurable means to better address a true understanding of\nadequate resources.\nThe Professional Judgment Model brings a group of edu-\ncators together to define the components needed to establish\na prototype school that, in their opinion, will have enough\nresources to enable a specified percentage of students to\nmeet established standards (King et al., 2005). The cost of\nthose resources is then estimated to ascertain an adequate\nlevel of funding. The professional judgment model is the\nonly method that has been fully implemented by a state.\nWyoming conducted a study using this method and, as a\nresult, the legislature approved a plan that cost US$6,050 per\nstudent each year (Odden, 2003). The main advantage of this\napproach is that spending levels for adequacy can be esti-\nmated in the absence of a sophisticated student assessment\nsystem. It is easy to explain to the public, and the resulting\nestimates are based on the judgments of professional educa-\ntors with experience in educating students.\nThe Successful Schools Model looks at all schools in the\nstate and identifies the ones that are meeting the state-\napproved standards. The amount of money these schools are\nspending becomes the adequate funding level for the state\n(Picus & Blair, 2004). However, flaws have been identified\nin this model. For example, the model bases its recommenda-\ntions on only a few educational standards and fails to account\nfor many of the other important functions of a good educa-\nbecause atypical districts are usually eliminated when using\nthis approach, the result is often based on average-sized non-\nmetropolitan districts that are demographically homoge-\nneous and spend below the state average. The successful\nschool district approach does not specify a way to make\nadjustments for characteristics of individual districts, leading\nto potential disagreements over how to meet the needs of\nmany students, especially those with high needs.\nThe Advanced Statistical Model represents the most tech-\nnically complex model. This approach attempts to estimate\nhow much money would be needed to attain a certain level of\nstudent performance, while controlling for the characteristics\nof the district and its students.Anumber of important insights\nabout relationships between inputs and outputs may be\ngleaned from cost function analyses. Many of these insights\ncan be used to inform policy and help determine the magni-\ntude of adjustments for students and district characteristics\n(Picus & Blair, 2004). Proponents believe that with enough\ninformation on education expenditures and student charac-\nteristics, statistical techniques can determine the funding\nneeded to meet education standards (Smith & Pettersen,\n2002). The primary concern with this model is its complex-\nity; lawmakers and the public in general are very suspicious\nof complex models and may mistrust the final calculations\nThe final method used to determine \"adequate\" funding is\nthe evidence-based approach. This model relies on current\neducational research to identify resources needed for a proto-\ntypical school to meet the state's student performance stan-\ndards (Picus & Blair, 2004). Once identified, those\nspecifications are subject to the \"professional judgment\" of\nofficials in the state to validate the research-based recom-\nmendations. These costs are then estimated and applied to\nactual schools in the state. One drawback is the fact that\nresearch-based models will not always work in absolutely\nSpending for Improvement in Student\nAchievement\nIn considering the aforementioned funding models, many\nstates, including Alabama, have yet to make the change to\nfunding with an emphasis on student performance. Most\nstates who adopted formulas similar to the foundation pro-\ngram formula used in Alabama have failed to recognize that\nthe amount of money needed to educate students in one dis-\ntrict may not be the amount needed to educate other students\nin a different district (Reschovsky & Imazeki, 2000).\nAlabama, however, has invested in three programs designed\nto improve student achievement in three critical areas. These\ninclude the Alabama Reading Initiative (ARI), the Alabama\nMath, Science, and Technology Initiative (AMSTI) and the\nAlabama Connecting Classrooms Educators and Students\nStatewide (ACCESS) in advanced secondary classes.\nNow that states have set ambitious performance goals for\ntheir students and the federal No Child Left Behind Act of\n2001 has demanded that all children achieve those standards\neducation spending to academic results (Olson, 2005). While\nAlabama has yet to define a true meaning of an \"adequate\"\neducation, it has chosen to direct specific allocations focused\non improving the academic results of students. In 1998, the\nPouncey et al. 5\nstate launched a study of 16 schools participating in the ARI\nusing US$1.5 million dollars from corporate donations to\nfund the project. The initiative was targeted to strengthen\nreading instruction in the early grades, continuously expand-\ning all students' reading power and comprehension, and\nintervening effectively with struggling readers.\nAMSTI provides three basic services to schools in an\neffort to boost hands-on learning experiences in math and\nscience. Central to its success is a strong recurring profes-\nsional development model that involves all teachers in\nGrades K-8 with extensive professional development train-\ning. In addition, teachers are supported throughout the year\nwith prepackaged manipulative kits that allow each class to\nengage in hands-on learning experiences.\nTheACCESS represents a statewide initiative that focused\non bringing true equity in instructional opportunities to all\nAlabama high school students. It provides a blended approach\nof online and interactive learning experiences through a\nstatewide distance learning effort. When fully implemented,\nall 440 Alabama high schools will be connected; each will\nhave the have the ability to offer students more rigorous and\nadvanced learning opportunities. This initiative began in\nlion dollars, and has been granted increased state funding\neach year to its current level of US$25 million dollars for\nFY2009 (Alabama Department of Education Legislative\nThese efforts have served to focus resources on improv-\ning student learning and have produced significant academic\ngains statewide. The National Assessment of Educational\nProgress (NAEP), which was released in September 2007,\nshowed Alabama public schools made more improvement in\nfourth-grade reading than any other state in the nation. The\nNAEP report showed a significant gain of eight points in\nfourth-grade reading for Alabama students--almost triple\nthe national average in gains. In 2005, the scaled score was\nfour scale score points away from the national average (220)\nin fourth-grade reading (The Nation's Report Card: NAEP,\nhttp://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard).\nIn addition, NAEP data show Alabama posted gains in\nfourth-grade mathematics and in eighth-grade mathematics.\nimproved by two points, Alabama's score showed a four-\npoint gain. The percentage of students who performed at or\nNation's Report Card: NAEP, http://nces.ed.gov/nationsre-\nportcard). These focused appropriations have begun to move\nAlabama up in the nationally ranked means of measuring\nstudent achievement.\nThis study looks at four constructs of educational funding\nperspectives: (a) equity and adequacy, (b) personal values,\n(c) political ideology, and (d) social influence. It is important\nto understand how such perspectives are formed.\nThe Formation of Attitudes and Opinions\nBehavioral studies in the field of politics have long recog-\nnized the need for a thorough understanding of the fields of\npsychology, sociology, and anthropology. These disciplines\noften present an array of competing positions but their syn-\nthesis offers a basis to more accurately examine attitude\nresearch (George, 1958). Specifically, how does attitude\naffect the general disposition of a superintendent or legislator\nto take action in a certain way?\nthe notion that political man is a purposive being, engaged in\ninstrumental behavior and exercising reason in attempting to\nchoose his course of action wisely is, of course, a traditional and\nhighly respected idea in political science. This notion, has long\nserved as the basis for interpreting and accounting for political\naction by means of the so-called \"rational hypothesis.\" (p. 21)\nKarl Popper has chosen to interpret political action by\nmeans of the rational hypothesis, the \"logic-of-the-situation\"\ntype of explanation (Popper, 1952). Those individuals choos-\ning to \"act\" are assumed to choose among alternative courses\nof action based on their assessment of logic of the situation\nthat they are confronting. For example, if an inner city school\nis labeled as a failing school, a legislator may perceive it is a\nresult of poor teaching and a lack of proper administration.\nHowever, the school may have far more challenges than\nother schools, in that there may be many more socioeco-\nnomic barriers preventing the school from succeeding.\nOne study (George, 1958) claimed that \"one takes account\nof the actual and programmed use of these three functions--\n`object appraisal,' `social adjustment,' and `externalization'\"\n(p. 21). All of these factors apply motivational forces in\nforming opinions. Likewise, \"reality testing,\" \"reward and\npunishment,\" and \"ego defense\" are three additional motiva-\ntional contexts of attitudes (Saruoff & Katz, 1954).\nResearchers have validated that no single factor forms opin-\nions or shapes attitudes.\nSocial Influences\nThe process of opinion change is greatly affected by social\ninfluence. In a study on opinion change by Kelman (1961),\nhe identified processes of social influences that guide all\nopinion changes: compliance, identification, and\ninternalization.\nCompliance can be said to occur when an individual\naccepts influence from another person or from a group\nbecause he hopes to achieve favorable reaction from the\nother. He may be interested in attaining certain specific\nrewards or avoiding certain specific punishments that the\n6 SAGE Open\ninfluencing agent controls (Kelman, 1961). For example, he\nstated that \"some individuals may compulsively try to say\nthe expected thing in all situations and please everyone with\nwhom they come in contact out of a disproportionate need\nThe individual learns to say or do the expected thing in spe-\ncial situations, regardless of their private beliefs.\nThe second social influence that guides the development\nof opinions is identification. Identification can be said to\noccur when an individual adopts behavior derived from\nanother person or a group because this behavior is associated\nwith a satisfying, self-defining relationship with a given per-\nson or group. It contributes to a person's self image. In\naccepting influence through identification, an individual has\na way of establishing or maintaining the desired relationship\nto the other party. Opinions formed through identification\nmay take all or part of the role of the influencing agent. He or\nshe defines their role in terms of the role of the other (Kelman,\n1961). An example of this may include political party affilia-\ntion or caucus membership. An individual's opinion is influ-\nenced by a desire to maintain affiliation with the group and\noften embraces the opinion of the group whole heartedly to\nmaintain acceptance.\nThe third social influence that affects opinion formation\nof an individual is that of internalization. It is said to occur\nwhen an individual accepts influence because the induced\nbehavior is congruent with his own value system. The indi-\nvidual adopts it because he finds it useful for the solution of\na problem or because it is congenial to his own orientation or\nthat is demanded by his own values (Kelman, 1961).\nCompliance, identification, and internalization are, in\neffect, tools needed to influence or internalize change.\nCore Beliefs and Values\nAn individual's core beliefs and values represent the basic\nfiber of an individual as he or she enters the arena on the first\nday of political interaction. To some extent, policies and\nactions are often judged right or wrong because of their\nimplications for deeply held values (Rokeach, 1973). A set of\nwidely shared beliefs, values, and norms concerning the rela-\ntionship of citizens to their government and to one another in\nmatters affecting public affairs is often recognized as politi-\nThree widely shared beliefs that tend to define the core\nvalues of an individual are (a) a belief in equal opportunity,\n(b) support for economic individualism, and (c) support for\nthe free enterprise system (Devine, 1972). All three of these\nare major components of what Devine identified as the basis\nof American public opinion and have been argued to be cen-\ntral to the way in which people in the United States think\nabout politics.\nEconomic individualism, the belief which people should\nget ahead because of their own hard work, is a core element\nin accounts of American values and beliefs. Some of the\nearliest European settlers brought with them a commitment\nto the work ethic already entrenched in industrialized Britain\n(Feagin, 1975). Evidence of a widespread belief in the work\nethic is still apparent in opinion surveys today.\nThe companion belief to work ethic is equality of oppor-\ntunity. Despite obvious discrimination against minorities and\nwomen, the United States was the first nation to acknowl-\nedge that formal equality is a right of all people (Lipset,\n1979). Americans have interpreted equality as formal or\npolitical equality rather than equality of results. Its value was\nmeant to be interpreted in terms of advancement rather than\nas an asset in itself.\nThe third belief that serves as a core value is that of the\nstrong support to the free enterprise system. The free enter-\nprise system can be seen as the economic side of the indi-\nvidualistic social system. Support for the free enterprise\nsystem has typically been accompanied by a distrust of big\ngovernment (Lipset, 1979). The support for capitalism and\nfree enterprise forms one of the basic elements of the\nAmerican political culture.\nCore beliefs are not uniformly distributed within the pub-\nlic or in the ideals of politicians or superintendents. To the\nextent that differences exist, these beliefs can account for\nvariations in policy preferences, political evaluations, and\ncandidate preference (Feldman, 1988). Take for example the\nbelief in equal opportunity for all. To one legislator that may\nbe interpreted as the need to propose policy language that has\nvery little restrictions on government interference, while\nanother legislator may interpret equal opportunity for all to\ninclude nondiscriminatory language in any proposed\nlegislation.\nPolitical Ideology\nBeing aware of the current \"Political Ideology\" is very\nimportant. All legislators hold personal views, beliefs, and\nvalues. They often move away from them to vote, according\nto the views and beliefs of their constituents. Legislators may\nbow to threats or enticements and vote against their own val-\nues, especially in highly publicized issues. In fact, research-\ners have raised doubts about the importance of personal\nideological orientations of an individual legislator when it\ncomes to roll-call voting (Clausen, 1973).\nTransparency in voting produces strong incentives for\nlegislators to adhere to constituency preferences (and ignore\ntheir own) on all but the most trivial or obscure bills. Voters\nseem to evaluate incumbents largely on the basis of simple\nname recognition, personal trustworthiness, and providing\nlegislative grants and service as ombudsmen in the bewilder-\ning bureaucracy. Few voters demand that representatives\nunswervingly follow constituency in all their roll-call votes.\nThe result is that for a vast majority of the votes, \"a congress-\nIn most sessions, legislators confront a few highly publi-\ncized, controversial issues; their private policy views may\nPouncey et al. 7\nmatter little. When confronted with issues similar to these, an\nelected official may resort to ideology as a means to define\nhis or her position. The use of political ideology as a matter\nof \"position\" on a given issue is defined as a set of general\nattitudes about the proper role of government in the alloca-\ntion of values in society; it contains a general evaluation of\nthe status quo of wealth and power, and a general orientation\ntoward the extent and nature of any changes that government\nshould pursue. This definition partakes of questions usually\nassociated with the \"liberal/conservative or a Republican/\nDemocrat\" continuum in politics (Entman, 1989).\nOftentimes, legislators choose to adopt the ideology of\nthe majority of their constituents on a particular issue as a\nmatter of pursuing the pathway of least resistance and as the\nsafest path that minimizes any criticism that they may receive\nas a result of the position they take. Conservative legislators\nmost often represent more affluent suburbs and rural areas;\nin contrast, liberal legislators tend to represent predomi-\nnantly urban areas which stand to benefit from the programs\nusually supported as a means of improving social factors that\nBeing cognizant of an individual's political ideology is\nimportant when approaching legislative changes. One's\npolitical ideology can also serve to assist in addressing mea-\nsures that attempt to diminish public education's position. It\nis this political ideology that many legislators wear as a pro-\ntective shield, and it allows their actions to be viewed based\non a defined group and not that of an individual.\nGender Differences\nToday, 32 out of 132 superintendents in Alabama are female,\nand 18 legislators are female out of a total of 140 legislators\nin the state. Women now have an established presence in an\narena traditionally dominated by men. Many believe that\nwomen will focus their time and efforts on policy develop-\nment issues that are more important to women as a group,\nwhich will change the way these issues are conceptualized,\ndebated and legislated to produce substantive policy out-\ncomes that serve women better than similar outcomes\nNumerous studies of women legislators find that they\nfocus on issues that follow from their status as women and\ntheir socialization as part of this distinct group. Sanbonmatsu\n(2002) found that female legislators have defined distinct\npositions nationally as they relate to reproductive rights.\nTolbert and Steuernagel (2001) noted that female legislators\nhave shaped national policy on health care issues as they\nrelate to all women and children. Both studies validate that\nthe overarching allegiance to and support of the effects of\npolicy development occur with all women, in general, rather\nthan a party allegiance to Democrats or Republicans.\nOther issues that women have successfully influenced\ninvolve their traditional social roles as mothers and caregiv-\ners, such as, policies about child protection, or those related\nto these traditional social roles, such as education and health\ncare (Thomas, 1994). Women try to change policies in these\nareas primarily through agenda-setting activities in the legis-\nlature, where they have the most leeway to be policy leaders\nin their areas of interest (Tamerius, 1995). Women introduce,\nsponsor, and cosponsor more legislation in these areas.\nWomen legislators may have similar policy priorities and\ninterests to each other and different policy priorities from\nmen, but the specific alternatives to solving these policy\nproblems may not be the same. Instead, the policy alterna-\ntives women favor are often \"filtered through their own dif-\nFemale legislators see themselves as representatives of\nthis type of representation as \"surrogate representation\" in\nthat women are able to act on behalf of women as a constitu-\nency beyond district or political boundaries, particularly\nbecause of the marginalized place of their social group in the\npolitical past.\nThe biggest differences in men and women's political\nopinions tends to focus on policy priorities, in that women\nare more interested in policies dealing with families, chil-\ndren, and women's rights as well as policies related to other\nareas, such as education, health care, and welfare. They tend\nto be more supportive of government activism and regula-\ntion, more compassionate toward low-income and minority\ngroups, less supportive of the use of force and in some cases,\nmore socially conservative than men (Thomas, 1994).\nGroup Affiliation and Choice Shift\nUnderstanding the attitudes and opinions of a specific gender\nor an individual legislator is only part of the puzzle. One\nmust realize the influence of group dynamics and how they\nare intertwined in fostering opinion change. Friedkin (1999)\nstated that the study of choice shift and group polarization is\na prominent line of work for social psychologists. It exam-\nines the effect of group memberships on individual attitudes.\nA choice shift is said to occur when, after a group's interac-\ntion on an issue, the mean final opinion of group members\ndiffers from the members'initial opinion. Group polarization\nis said to occur when the choice shift is in the same direction\nas the mean initial opinion (e.g., if on some issue, the initial\nattitude of the average member is positive, then the subse-\nquent attitude of the average member will be more\npositive).\nChoice shifts can arise simply from inequalities in the\nrelative influence of persons in a group interaction. A choice\nshift is the product of a group's social structure in which cer-\ntain members have more influence than others during the\nopinion formation process (Berger, Fisek, Hamit, Robert, &\nAn examination of these dynamics and the other factors\nreviewed from the literature are key to understanding how an\nindividual is influenced by his or her affiliation with multiple\n8 SAGE Open\ngroups. These groups include, but are not limited to, party\naffiliation, caucus membership, regional and demographic\naffiliation, and constituent obligations. Understanding group\ndynamics provides a better theoretical understanding of\nthose groups in which social structures affect individual and\ngroup outcomes.\nThe knowledge gained from this review informed the\nconstruction of the data collection instrument used in this\nstudy.\nData and Method\nThis study utilized an ex post facto research design to ana-\nlyze perceptual differences between two groups (superinten-\ndents and legislators). The dependent variables included\nopinions relative to school funding in four categories: equity\nand adequacy, personal values, political ideology, and social\ninfluence. These constructs were evaluated within several\ndemographic independent variables: gender, ethnicity, edu-\ncation level, population of representative districts, and aver-\nage household income of the districts.\nThe participants consisted of two groups: 140 elected\nmembers of the State of Alabama legislature (comprising\n105 members of the House of Representatives and 35 mem-\nbers of the Alabama State Senate) and 132 local school\nsuperintendents (39 of whom served as elected superinten-\ndents and 93 having been appointed by their respective\nboards). All were included to maximize the sample size.\nBecause of the uniqueness of this study, the researcher\ndeveloped the data collection instrument--a self-adminis-\ntered, Likert-type scale questionnaire, School Funding\nFactors Survey (available upon request). Specific items tar-\ngeted perceptual beliefs relative to the four constructs: equity\nand adequacy, personal values, political ideology, and social\ninfluence. Five demographic variables were also assessed on\neach participant: gender, ethnicity, education level, popula-\ntion of representative districts, and average household\nincome of the districts represented by the two groups.\nCronbach's alpha internal consistency reliability coefficients\nwere computed on the survey and all subscales.\nContent validity of the instrument was established through\na two-stage process. First, survey items were extracted from\nthe existing literature on the subject and a thorough review\nwas conducted by experts in the field of higher education.\nSecond, the instrument was reviewed for content validity by\na panel of experts consisting of three legislators, and three\nsuperintendents. After receiving input from these experts,\nfinal edits to the instrument were completed and it was\napproved for use by the university Institutional Review\nBoard.\nThe survey instrument was sent to each legislator and\nsuperintendent in the State of Alabama. The survey included\na cover letter that provided the participant with an overview\nof the study; in addition to assuring anonymity, it contained\ninformation about who to contact with questions regarding\ntheir rights as participants. Each potential respondent was\ncontacted by fax to inform them that they would be receiving\na survey regarding state finance of education. A link to the\nonline survey was subsequently emailed to each superinten-\ndent; a hard copy of the questionnaire was mailed to each\nlegislator (along with a stamped, self-addressed envelope).\nThe superintendent participants had the option to either link\ndirectly to the survey, submit their responses online or down-\nload a hard copy of the survey and fax or mail their responses.\nThe legislative participants had the option to complete the\nhard copy and either mail or fax their responses to the\nresearcher. To maximize response rates, differences in data\ncollection procedures were implemented after consultation\nwith legislative and state education staff.\nAn array of descriptive statistics was computed on all\nvariables. The analyses comparing the legislator and super-\nintendent perspectives on school funding issues along the\nfour constructs was conducted using two-tailed independent\ngroups Student's t tests. Comparison of the superintendent\nand legislator groups on demographics variables was con-\nducted with a Pearson's chi-square test of independence. All\nstatistical analyses were conducted at the 0.05 level of sta-\ntistical significance using the SPSS statistical software\npackage.\nResults\nCronbach's alpha internal consistency reliability coefficients\nfor the School Funding Factors Survey and its subscales are\nprovided in Table 1. These reliability coefficients were\ndeemed acceptable for a user-designed instrument. Increasing\nthe number of items per subscale, however, may have\nimproved the reliability.\nBefore analysis, the data were examined for overall accu-\nracy. This included checks for missing data elements, dupli-\ncation of records, sufficient frequency counts in each level of\nvariable to support the chi-square test of independence (cat-\negories were collapsed where necessary), and deletion of\nunusable records. Generally, records were eliminated from\nthe data for missing demographic data elements or duplica-\ntion of the entire record. Furthermore, records were elimi-\nnated from analysis if small counts could cause spurious\nresults in later analyses or potentially threaten the anonymity\nof the respondent; for example, the single informant who\nwas self-reported as \"Native American/Alaskan Indian.\"\nTable 1.

The largest percentage of respondents were at the\nlevel of \"post-master's (no doctorate)\" at 26.5%, followed\nclosely by those responding at the level of \"doctorate\" with\n27.2%, and those claiming \"master's degree\" following\nclosely at 23.8% of the sample.

The means, standard deviations, differences between\ngroup means, by item, are reported in Table 5.\nSuperintendents outscored legislators on items: 10, 12,\n20, 23, and 29. Note that a larger scaled value indicates less\nagreement with the survey item statement. The complete text\nof the survey is available from the authors upon request.\nConclusion and Implications\nThe purpose of this study was to examine factors influencing\nthe thoughts and perceptions of statewide policy makers\nengaged in the process of funding schools. Alabama has 140\nlegislators and 132 school superintendents. They collectively\nrepresent a very diverse group of constituents as well as per-\nsonal backgrounds and experiences. In addition, they vary in\ntheir level of understanding of the political process and their\nunderstanding of quality school programs. Superintendents\nand legislators must gain a clearer understanding of each\nother's thinking to develop effective strategies for establish-\ning a consensus for change. Identifying differences and simi-\nlarities between superintendents and legislators can provide\ndirectives for future consensus initiatives relative to securing\nand deploying additional resources. The outcomes of this\nstudy should be useful to both groups as they gain an\nenhanced understanding of each other's perspectives related\nto school funding.\nEvidence was found to conclude there is a difference\nbetween legislators and superintendents on the factor of\nequity and adequacy; furthermore, the typical legislator\nscored 2.14 points higher than superintendents on this factor.\nThe mean factor scores on Equity and Adequacy are actually\nweighted averages based on eight survey items. Of these\neight items, superintendents outscored legislators on only\ntwo of the factor items. In addition, of these two factors only\none factor difference was statistically significant and the\nother factor difference indicated an emerging trend toward\nsignificance. The two survey items are number 10 and 12.\nSurvey item 10 states, \"Districts should be required to\ncontribute a local match in an amount greater than 10 mills in\norder to receive state funds.\" The median response for legis-\nlators was agreement, but the median response for superin-\ntendents was disagreement. Efforts could be made to inform\nlegislators that most states require a local match much higher\nthan 10 mills required in Alabama. This low threshold results\nin a funding model that is primarily dependent on state\nappropriations. An increase in local match would provide\nmore stable funding for the districts and take some of the\npressure off the legislators to meet the needs for providing\nadequate state funds. This represents an opportunity to build\nconsensus and capitalize upon a win-win outcome for both\ngroups.\nSurvey item 12 states, \"State implemented achievement\ntests are the best in assessing the performance of a school\ndistrict.\" The median response among legislators was neutral-\nity, while the median response among superintendents was\ndisagreement. The difference between the two groups shows\nthat there is a predisposed tendency to view school success by\nmultiple factors, especially on the part of superintendents.\nTable 3.

Legislators' and Superintendents' Relationship With\nExternal Demographic Factors (n = 151).\nFactor 2 df\nSome of these factors may include parental satisfaction,\nextracurricular accomplishments, teamwork, behavior and\nattendance, using subject measurement factors other than\nnorm-referenced tests, and a variety of other measures that\ncontribute to a person's success in life and contributions to\nsociety. Superintendents' disagreement with achievement\ntests as the best means of measuring success may be based on\ntheir experience that all students cannot be fairly measured by\nthe same factors. Instead, multiple measures may be employed\nto ensure schools are educating the total child regardless of\ntheir background. A better understanding and agreement\nbetween legislators and superintendents about what children\nshould learn to be successful, productive citizens is a cogent\nstarting point to begin the discussion.\nNationally, there exists a large gap between spending in\ntax-wealthy and those poorer districts that are limited in tax\ncapacity. This disparity presents a problem in that educa-\ntional funding is limited in poorer areas, thereby often con-\ntributing to fewer resources and personnel for some students,\ndepending upon where they reside. As decisions regarding\nthe parity of spending are made at the state level, where leg-\nislators and superintendents engage in discussion through\ncommittees and other fact-gathering endeavors, the study of\nperceptions is critical to the creation of final policies that\nimpact school funding issues. Although the current body of\nresearch on school funding is abundant, there is a paucity of\nresearch in the area of differences in perceptions of school\nsuperintendents and legislators as it relates to school funding\npolicy decisions. Thus, this study seeks to make a contribu-\ntion to the body of literature on the topic. Policy intermediar-\nies are individuals who work with sometimes disparate\ngroups to help them find points of agreement so that policies\ncan be developed to improve the \"public good\" or \"public\nwelfare.\" The quality of those policies is directly influenced\nby the information that legislators and superintendents\nreceive. The findings of this study clearly point out that it is\nincumbent upon these intermediaries to locate, distill, and\nshare in understandable and succinct units of information\nthat are usable by the groups directly responsible for creating\nand legislating educational funding policies. The practical\noutcomes of this study that intermediaries may use to\nimprove policy development processes and products are that\nthey should:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Identify key policy issues well in advance that are\nwell documented and data based;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Keep key policy issues to a minimum, avoiding infor-\nmation saturation;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Frame policy issues clearly and succinctly without\nusing excessive educational or legislative jargon.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Understand that both legislators and educators need a\nshared definition of what constitutes \"adequacy.\"\n(The data suggest that viewpoints are disparate on this\ndefinition; adequacy is associated with the responsi-\nbility to ensure an education that is standards based.\nHistorically, education has been focused on an \"equi-\ntable\" education, that is, funding based on distribution\nof funds rather than funding for achievement of stan-\ndards. This is a new definition that is not understood\nor shared by all factions of policy makers.)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Supply research around key policy issues that is\ntimely, provides an historical context, and is\naccurate.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Provide all decision makers and their immediate sup-\nport staff involved in the issue with the same high-\nquality information.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Note the make-up of the various committees charged\nwith creating and dispensing policies; identify gender,\nethnicity, educational levels, and constituent informa-\ntion (socioeconomic levels, population densities).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Recognize the historical influence in respective cham-\nbers/districts (not part of study, but considered\nTable 5.
