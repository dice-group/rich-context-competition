Russell, PhD\nBackground: The amount of time individuals spend on health-related self-care is not known.\nObjective: The aim of this study was to describe how much time American adults reported spending\non health-related self-care (eg, taking insulin, dressing a wound).\nMethods: We analyzed data from the first 5 years, 2003 to 2007, of the population-based American\nhealth-related self-care on their survey day. We used descriptive statistics, weighted to represent US\nadults, to describe self-reported time and logit regressions to analyze the odds of engaging in self-care\nas a function of age, sex, race, and other characteristics. Because health status was collected only in\nResults: Of Americans 25 years of age and older, 6.6% engaged in health-related self-care each day.\nAmong those reporting self-care, mean time reported was 90 minutes (median, 15 minutes); 20.6% re-\ntimes as likely (95% CI, 2.7\u00ad5.8) to report self-care as persons aged 25 to 44. Compared with persons\nin excellent health, those in fair health were 2.0 times as likely (95% CI, 1.4\u00ad2.8) and those in poor\nhealth were 3.7 times as likely (95% CI, 2.5\u00ad5.6) to report engaging in self-care. Nonworking disabled\npersons reported self-care 4 times (95% CI, 3.1\u00ad5.3) as often as employed persons. Sex, race/ethnicity,\npresence of children, and body mass index were also significant.\nConclusions: Time spent on health-related self-care is disproportionately distributed across the\npopulation, with a larger amount of time reported by those in poor health (3.6 hours/week) and the\nnonworking disabled (3.2 hours/week). To provide patient-centered care and to promote optimal deci-\nsions about health-related time management when making recommendations for additional self-care\ntasks, clinicians need to talk to patients about how much time they are already spending on\nKeywords: Adult, Patient Time, Self-Care, Time, Time Factors\nSelf-care, or self-management, is an integral part of\nthe management of chronic diseases such as asthma,\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure,\nand diabetes. For some conditions, the majority of care\nis implemented day to day by patients, with physicians\noffering intermittent instruction.1,2 Appropriate self-\ncare can require considerable time and likely varies by\ncondition and severity. For example, adult patients with\ncystic fibrosis devote almost 2 hours daily to self-care,3\nand estimates suggest that recommended diabetes self-\ncare requires more than 2 hours daily.4\nSelf-care has been defined as \"the personal and\nmedical care performed by the patient, usually in\ncollaboration with and after instruction by a health\ncare professional.\"5 The time required for self-care\n(eg, taking insulin, dressing a wound) for most\nhealth conditions is not known, nor is the total time\nthat individuals spend on self-care.

First, self-care is es-\nsential for optimal health. Second, the amount of\ntime required for self-care tasks could be a very\nimportant factor in patient-centered decision mak-\ning. Knowing what people currently choose to do\nseems an essential first step toward achieving opti-\nmal \"health time\" management. When patients\nhave competing demands and only a set amount of\ntime to devote to self-care, but there are hours of\noptions, what should they prioritize? If time re-\nquirements are burdensome, clinicians may need to\nhelp patients set priorities to maximize health. Third,\nthe time required may for some patients be a substan-\ntial barrier to compliance with self-care regimens.\nSeveral authors have explained that time require-\nments are barriers to self-care or health care more\ngenerally.3,6\u00ad9 One study found that more than 20%\nof patients identified \"not enough time\" as the biggest\nobstacle to effectively managing their diabetes.8\nThe American   (ATUS), from\nthe US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), is the first\nlarge-scale ongoing survey of time use in the\nUnited States. The ATUS interviews a nationally\nrepresentative sample of noninstitutionalized adults\nabout their activities during a 24-hour period. De-\ntailed activity codes make it possible to identify\ntime spent on personal health-related self-care for\nexisting conditions, which is coded separately from\ntime spent on primary prevention activities like\nphysical activity. The purpose of this article is to\ndescribe the time American adults 25 years of age\nand older spend on health-related self-care using\nMethods\nAmerican  \nConducted for the BLS by the Census Bureau, the\nselected from those that have completed their last\ninterview for the Current Population Survey\n(CPS), the nation's monthly labor force survey.11\nThus, the ATUS, like the CPS, is based on a\nnationally representative sample of the civilian,\nnoninstitutionalized US population. The process of\nselecting the ATUS sample begins by subsampling\nthe CPS to reduce the oversample of less-populous\nstates because accurate estimates by state, which are\nrequired for the CPS, are not necessary for the\nATUS. Households are then stratified on race and\nHispanic origin, presence and age of children, and,\nfor childless households, the number of adults; mi-\nnority households and households with children are\nsampled at higher rates than other households. Fi-\nnally, one respondent at least 15 years old is ran-\ndomly selected from the members of each sample\nlected each month throughout the year. Response\nAt our institutions, institutional review board ap-\nproval was not necessary for this study because the\nde-identified data are publicly available.\nEach monthly sample is divided into 4 parts, one\nfor each week of the month. Within a week, 10% of\nthe sample is assigned to each weekday and 25% to\neach weekend day. BLS weights adjust for the over-\nsampling of weekend days as well as for stratifica-\ntion and nonresponse.11\nThe survey is conducted using computer-assisted\ntelephone interviewing (see Appendix 1, available online\nat http://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/research_programs/\nevidencebased_practice/publications/index.htm). Re-\nspondents are randomly assigned a day of the week\nand called the following day. During the interview,\nthey are asked how they spent the 24 hours, begin-\nning at 4 am the day before the call and ending 4 am\nthe day of the call. For activities other than per-\nsonal care, they are asked where they were and who\nwas in the room or accompanied them. When re-\nspondents report 2 or more activities for the same\ntime, they are asked to specify which was primary;\nexcept for childcare, interviewers do not ask about\nsecondary activities. For respondents who are not\nreached on the first try, interviewers attempt sub-\nsequent contacts on the same day of the week for up\nto 8 consecutive weeks. Respondents in households\nthat do not provide telephone numbers (5% of the\nsample) are requested, by mail, to call the telephone\ncenter to complete the interview. Interviews with\nthese respondents take place by telephone and\ncover the previous 24 hours, just as with other\nrespondents. Respondents are interviewed only\nonce; there is no longitudinal component.\nATUS's telephone interview is conducted as a\nconversation (see Appendix 1). Except for 12 com-\nmon activities listed on the form, such as sleeping\nand eating/drinking, activities are not coded during\nthe interview but are entered in the respondent's\nown words. The interviewer \"walks\" the respon-\ndent through his or her day, essentially asking,\n\"...and what did you do next?\" The coding of\nactivities takes place only after the interview is\nfinished. The interview asks about the day before\nthe interview and has no longitudinal component,\nwith one exception: a summary question about time\nspent away from home for 2 or more nights during\nthe previous month.\nAfter the interview is complete, 2 other inter-\nviewers/coders, working separately, assign codes to\nthe activities reported. Each activity is assigned a\n6-digit code. The first 2 digits indicate one of 17\nmajor activity categories, the second 2 digits indi-\ncate an intermediate category, and the final 2 digits\nindicate the specific activity.12 We report data for\nunder \"personal care,\"01 subcategory health-related\nself-care.03 Health-related self-care also includes a\nseparate code for \"self-care, not elsewhere classi-\n\"feeling sick.\" We omitted this category because we\nwere interested only in active self-care. Examples of\npersonal health-related self-care are provided in\nThe definition of health-related self care in the\nATUS seems to be conservative (see Appendix 1).\nAs noted, what is categorized as health-related self-\ncare is determined after the interview by 2 coders\nwho did not conduct the interview. Routine self-\ncare, like toothbrushing or food preparation, is\nexplicitly described by other codes. Exercise is in-\ncluded under health-related self-care only if done\nfor medical reasons; otherwise it is coded under\nmajor category 13 (\"sports, exercise, and recre-\nation\"), which includes exercise for leisure or for\nprimary prevention. Health-related self-care sec-\nondary to another activity is noted if mentioned by\nthe respondent but is not coded.\nDemographic and other characteristics of respon-\ndents came from the ATUS survey and from the\nthe ATUS asked respondents their self-rated health,\nheight, and weight as part of an Eating and Health\nmodule added by the Department of Agriculture.\nData Analysis\nTo focus on adults, and to avoid problems with\npredictors like education, which do not represent\nsocioeconomic status well for adolescents and\nyoung adults, we omitted respondents younger\nthan age 25. We used the weights BLS provides for\ncombining survey years to adjust for oversampling\nin some subpopulations, days of the week, and\nnonresponse to make national estimates.13 Unless\nstated, numbers are weighted.\nOur initial analysis focused on descriptive statis-\ntics. We compared the full ATUS sample 25 years\nof age or older with respondents who reported\nto 2007 sample was compared separately because\nthese were the years when self-rated health and\nbody mass index (BMI) were available. To explore\nthe factors related to whether patients reported\ntime on health-related self-care, we ran multivari-\nable logistic regressions using a binary dependent\nvariable (any time vs no time spent). We included\nthe following predictors: age; sex; race/ethnicity\n(white non-Hispanic, black, Hispanic, other); edu-\ncation; employment status; household income;\nmarital status; and presence of children. We re-\npredictors, plus BMI and self-rated health, which\nwere only available for those years. We conducted ad-\nTable 1.

The ATUS sample weights adjusted for strat-\nification and nonresponse so that time estimates rep-\nresent the national population of adults. The ATUS's\nsuccessive difference replicate weights were used to\nobtain standard errors that adjust for the complex\nsurvey design.\nWe calculated yearly time for the average adult,\nand the average member of subgroups, eg, those\nwith poor self-rated health, by multiplying mean\ndaily time for the group (proportion who reported\nself-care time multiplied by mean time spent by\nthose who reported time) by 365 days. We calcu-\nlated weekly time by multiplying daily time by 7.\nAlthough any one individual's self-care time varies\nfrom day to day, these extrapolations of daily time\nare valid because respondents who report self care\non their interview day but do not engage in it on\nother days are balanced by respondents who do not\nreport self-care on their interview day but do en-\ngage in it on other days. The proportions of par-\nticipants who do and do not report self care on their\ninterview days, and the times they report, are rep-\nresentative of the adult population. The ATUS\nthus provides an accurate snapshot of time spent by\nthe average adult each day and can legitimately be\nextrapolated to a week or a year.\nAnalyses were conducted using SAS software ver-\nsion 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) or Stata\nsoftware, version 11 (StataCorp, College Station,\nTX).

When respondents reported 2 or more ac-\ntivities for the same time (ie, multitasking), only\nself-care activities designated as primary by the\nrespondent are coded by the ATUS.\nIn multivariable logistic regression for the full\ncation, children, employment status, and income all\ninfluenced the odds of spending any time on self-\ncare (Table 4). Age was particularly important, with\nparticipants in the older age groups being much\nmore likely to report time on self-care. Nonwork-\ning disabled persons were more than 7 times as\nlikely to report time spent on self-care.\nand self-rated health and BMI were included in the\nregression, those with fair self-rated health were\ntwice as likely, and those with poor self-rated\nhealth were 3.7 times as likely, to spend time on\nself-care as those with excellent self-rated health\nlikely to spend time on self-care as those with a\nlonger significant.\nIn multivariable logistic regressions stratified by\nage group (Appendix 2), BMI was statistically sig-\nyears, but not for the youngest and oldest groups.\nThere were other minor differences across age\ngroups; for example, the sex difference seemed to\nbe greater among persons 25 to 44 years of age than\nthose in the older groups. The finding that fair or\npoor health increases the probability that a person\nwill report health-related self-care is consistent\nTable 2.

Time spent on health-related self-care\nis disproportionately distributed across the popula-\ntion, with a small segment of the population ac-\ncounting for a large proportion of the time. Not\nsurprisingly, our results support the expectation\nthat people who have health problems are more\nlikely to spend time engaging in self-care. A much\nlarger percentage of those 65 years of age and older\nspent time on health-related self-care on any given\nday, although the median time spent by those who\nspent time was lower than for younger age groups.\nThat may seem surprising, but it is consistent with\nthe idea that many are spending time on things as\nsimple as taking pills, which is less common among\nyounger people.\nTo implement patient-centered decision making,\nclinicians should consider the time required for self-\ncare and talk to patients about time demands. Our\ndata provide a rough estimate of how much time, on\naverage, various patients spend (eg, 3.6 hours/week\nfor those with poor health, 3.2 hours/week for people\nwho are disabled/not in the labor force). Knowing the\nstarting point for what people currently do seems an\nessential first step toward achieving optimal \"health\ntime\" management. When weighing various options\nfor self-care, it may be important to negotiate which\ntasks are most important to develop plans that are\ntailored to individual patients and set realistic goals\nfor self-care activities in the time available for each\npatient. Some self-care regimens may be too time\nconsuming or complex for many patients to under-\ntake without multidisciplinary support.14 Consider-\nation of patient knowledge, health belief models, and\nhealth literacy are also important for understanding\nTable 4.

Screen shot of American   interview form.\npatients' capacity to maintain appropriate self-\nAlthough health outcomes may be improved\ncare requirements may represent a substantial time\ninvestment for some conditions, leading patients to\nomit important tasks, depending on their time\ntrade-off decisions. For example, a survey of diabe-\ntes patients found that 38% did not engage in\nrecommended foot care or physical activity.8 Ap-\nproximately one fourth of adult cystic fibrosis pa-\ntients report not completing recommended airway\nclearance, primarily because they are too busy, they\nforget, and because of the complexity of the regi-\nmen.3 Similar reasons for neglecting self-care have\nbeen reported among children with cystic fibrosis\nand asthma,43 as well as adults with diabetes,44 and\nsuggest that time requirements may have an impor-\ntant impact on self-care. People's willingness to\nspend time likely depends on the perceived benefits\nof that self-care.\nSince the emergence of the self-care movement\nin the 1970s, the health care system has shifted\ntoward expecting chronically ill patients to play a\nmore active role in their care, and time spent on\nself-care has likely increased.39 The self-care move-\nment aims to increase patients' involvement in their\nown care, especially for chronic conditions, thereby\nfostering greater adherence to complex self-care\nThe ATUS data do not allow us to determine\ntime spent on specific self-care activities or for\nspecific health conditions. It is unclear how much\nof the time is dedicated to chronic disease self-\nmanagement (eg, taking insulin or foot care for\ndiabetes), acute illness self-care (eg, gargling for a\nsore throat or icing an injury), or other purposes\nsuch as stress management. In addition, we cannot\ndetermine whether individuals with chronic dis-\neases spend an optimal amount of time (ie, an\namount that is appropriate, adequate, or effective)\non self-care and whether the time should be re-\nduced or increased. Nor can we assess time\ntradeoffs between alternative self-care activities.\nNonetheless, the ATUS provides a useful starting\npoint that helps clinicians understand how much\ntime the average patient spends on health-related\nself-care, especially if that patient is in poor health.\nSome would argue that self-care should be much\nmore broadly defined to include general physical ac-\ntivity and cooking healthy foods, but our purpose\nhere is to describe time spent on health-related self-\ncare without including activities for primary preven-\ntion, which we consider a separate issue from time\nthat patients spend caring for existing health condi-\ntions. The time reported for physical activity has been\ndescribed previously for the ATUS sample,46 with\nsports, exercise, and recreation reported by 17.6% of\nrespondents (mean for those reporting any time\nspent, 114 minutes/day; mean for the average adult,\nincluding those who did and those who did not report\ntime, 20 minutes/day).\nOur study has several limitations. First, the\nATUS relies on self-reported time rather than on\ndirect observation of activities or completing a di-\nary of activities as they occur, making the time\nestimates subject to recall bias. Second, ATUS re-\n(2003). Participants with the greatest self-care time\nrequirements may be more likely to respond (eg,\nunemployed or retired individuals may be more\nlikely to be at home to answer the phone) or less\nlikely to respond (eg, disability or illness may make\nit difficult for individuals to answer the phone). In\naddition, the ATUS response is limited by (1) non-\nresponse from the CPS and (2) survey fatigue from\nthe CPS; survey fatigue is a key reason why people\nrefuse to participate in the ATUS.47 However, the\nCPS offers advantages in selecting the ATUS sam-\nple and adjusting for nonresponse because more is\nknown about the base population. Third, time\nspent on health-related self-care as a secondary\nbehavior (eg, while watching television) is not asked\nabout, nor is it coded when volunteered (Appendix\n1), making our estimates conservative. Fourth, we\ncannot determine time spent on specific self-care\nactivities because the ATUS does not provide that\nlevel of detail; all health-related self-care activities\nare grouped under a single code. Finally, because\nthe ATUS does not collect data on health condi-\ntions, we are unable to determine time spent on\nself-care by condition, such as diabetes or asthma,\nand therefore we cannot determine whether the\namount of time spent is optimal.\nConclusion\nTime spent on health-related self-care is dispro-\nportionately distributed across the population, with\nmore time spent reported by those in poor health\n(mean, 3.6 hours/week) and the nonworking dis-\nabled (mean, 3.2 hours/week). To provide patient-\ncentered care and to promote optimal decisions\nabout health-related time management when mak-\ning recommendations for additional self-care tasks,\nclinicians need to be aware of the time their pa-\ntients are already spending on self-care. The ATUS\nprovides benchmark data that can help clinicians\nidentify those patients for whom the burden of\nself-care time is likely more substantial. Further\nresearch, including longitudinal studies of self-care\ntime, is needed to understand the time required for\nself-care activities for specific health conditions.\nReferences\n1.
