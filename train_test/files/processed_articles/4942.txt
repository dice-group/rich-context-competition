The ASSERTIVE study previously reported more sustained control of Br-SBP with aliskiren\nversus telmisartan in patients with hypertension, following 7-days treatment withdrawal. In this ASSERTIVE sub-study,\nwe hypothesised that aliskiren would similarly exert more sustained control of CASP than telmisartan during treatment\nwithdrawal.\nMethods: We investigated the effects of treatment withdrawal on both Br-SBP and CASP following 12-weeks treatment\nwith either aliskiren (300 mg) or telmisartan (80 mg). Br-SBP and CASP were measured at the end of treatment, and at\ndays 2 and 7 following treatment withdrawal in 303 patients (CASP randomised set).\nResults: Of the CASP randomised set, 94 patients completed CASP measurements at all time points (CASP completer\nset). After 7 days of treatment withdrawal, aliskiren demonstrated lesser increases in both Br-SBP and CASP than\np = 0.041, n = 94. Similar findings were obtained for the CASP randomised set.\nConclusions: Following treatment withdrawal, aliskiren demonstrated more sustained control of both brachial and\ncentral SBP than telmisartan.\n",

Since missed medication\ndoses are a frequent occurrence during the treatment of\nelevated BP, it is important to verify the consequences on\ncentral aortic pressure in comparison to what has been\ndescribed for peripheral blood pressure.9,10 It is possible\nthat treatment withdrawal could change the relationship\nbetween brachial and central pressure, effects which might\nnot be apparent from monitoring brachial pressure alone.\nTwo different strategies for lowering BP via inhibition\nof the renin\u00adangiotensin\u00adaldosterone system (RAAS) were\nstudied. We compared the effects of withdrawal following\nprior treatment with either aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor,\nor telmisartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), both\nknown for their long-lasting efficacy.11,12 The primary\nfocus of this study was on the 7-day treatment withdrawal\nperiod, following a 12-week treatment period, evaluating\nthe corresponding changes in brachial BP and central aortic\nsystolic pressure (CASP), in patients with hypertension.\nTheASSERTIVE study previously reported more sustained\ncontrol of Br-SBP with aliskiren versus telmisartan in\npatients with hypertension,13 following 7-days treatment\nwithdrawal. In this ASSERTIVE sub-study, we hypothe-\nsised that aliskiren would similarly exert more sustained\ncontrol of CASP than telmisartan during treatment with-\ndrawal. Importantly, this paper reports, for the first time,\nthe impact of treatment withdrawal on brachial BP and\nCASP in a randomised clinical trial of BP lowering.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis was a sub-study embedded within theAliSkiren Study\nof profound antihypERtensive efficacy in hyperTensIVE\npatients (ASSERTIVE), the design and primary results of\nwhich have been previously published.13 ASSERTIVE\nwas a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-\ngroup, multi-centre study. Following a 2-week washout\nand 1- to 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were ran-\ndomised to 2 weeks of active treatment with either once-\ndaily aliskiren 150 mg or telmisartan 40 mg monotherapies,\nand then force-titrated to double the initial dose for 10\nweeks.\nAt the end of the 12-week treatment period, both drugs\nwere replaced with placebo and brachial and central pres-\nsures were measured at days 2 and 7 following treatment\nwithdrawal. The present analysis focuses on the 7-day\ntreatment withdrawal period. Details of the run-in and\nactive treatment periods concerning sitting brachial and\ncentral pressure are presented in the online supplement.\nPatients\nThe ASSERTIVE study included men or women 18\nyears, with essential hypertension (Grades 1\u00ad2), who met\nboth of the following criteria at randomisation: office sys-\nmean ambulatory SBP (MASBP) 135 mmHg. Major\nexclusion criteria included the following: severe hyperten-\nsion (mean sitting SBP (msSBP) 180 mmHg and/or\nmean sitting DBP (msDBP) 110 mmHg), secondary\nhypertension, and pregnant women.\nThe trial was conducted in accordance with the\nDeclaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on\nHarmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and\nthe US Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46, Protection of\nHuman Subjects. The trial protocol was approved by inde-\npendent ethics committees at all centres, and written\ninformed consent was obtained from each patient before\nparticipating in any trial procedures. The trial is registered\nParticipants in this ASSERTIVE sub-study were\nrecruited from 45 out of the 111 ASSERTIVE study cen-\ntres worldwide. All participants at each centre were invited\nto participate (mean participation 95\u00b115% per centre) and\nthis comprised the CASP randomised dataset (n = 303).\nStudy assessments\nThe primary endpoint for this analysis was to compare the\nsustained efficacy of prior treatment with aliskiren versus\ntelmisartan on the change in seated CASP at day 7 follow-\ning treatment withdrawal. Other assessments included\nchange in (1) seated CASP at day 2 following treatment\nwithdrawal, (2) seated brachial BP at days 2 and 7 follow-\ning treatment withdrawal, (3) brachial ambulatory BP at\nday 7 following treatment withdrawal and (4) evaluation\nof biomarkers, plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldoster-\none across the treatment and 7-day withdrawal periods.\nso that set-up of ambulatory blood pressure measurements\ncould be standardised across the study.\nBrachial BP measurements\nSeated brachial BP was measured at the end of the 12-week\ntreatment period (baseline for this analysis) and on days 2\nand 7 following treatment withdrawal. Brachial BP was\nmeasured using a validated and automated BP monitor\n(Omron\u00ae HEM-705) with an appropriate cuff size, accord-\ning to the European Society for Hypertension Guidelines.15\nBriefly, the cuff device was applied on the non-dominant\narm or the arm with the higher reading at screening if there\nwas a clinically relevant difference (SBP 10 mmHg and/\nor DBP 5 mmHg) between arms at the first study visit.\n616 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(3)\nThree sitting BP measurements were taken at 1\u00ad2-minute\nintervals after the patient had been seated for 5 minutes.\nThe mean of these readings was recorded as brachial BP.\nCASP measurements\nSeated CASP was measured at the end of the treatment\nperiod (baseline for this analysis) and on days 2 and 7 fol-\nlowing treatment withdrawal, using the BProTM device\n(HealthSTATS, Singapore). The BProTM device uses\napplanation tonometry to capture high-fidelity radial artery\npulse waveforms (RAPWF) at the wrist in blocks of\n10-second intervals. RAPWFs were calibrated to brachial\nBP measured in the same arm using the OMRON HEM-\n705 device, immediately prior to waveform collection.\nCASP was derived from the calibrated RAPWFs using a\nvalidated algorithm.16\nAmbulatory BP Monitoring\nTwenty-four-hour brachial ambulatory BP monitoring\n(ABPM) using Spacelabs 90208 (Spacelabs Medical Inc.,\nRedmond, Washington, USA) was performed at the end of\nthe treatment period and on day 7 following withdrawal.\nABPM sessions commenced between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m.\nand monitors were applied to the non-dominant arm of the\npatient, as previously described.13,17 Validity criteria for\nABPM measurements included a minimum test duration\nof 24 hours, at least 70% of valid expected BP measure-\nments during the 24 hour duration, and no more than two\nnon-consecutive hours without readings. If the ABPM\nmeasurement failed to achieve validity criteria at randomi-\nsation, a repeat measurement was permitted within 24\u00ad72\nhours, provided the patient continued to receive placebo\ntreatment.\nPlasma renin activity and aldosterone levels\nBlood samples were collected from a subset of patients\nprior to treatment initiation, at the end of the treatment\nperiod, and on day 7 following withdrawal. Blood samples\nwere collected after a fast of at least 8 hours. EDTA sam-\nples were centrifuged within 5 minutes of collection and\nplasma was immediately frozen at -20\u00b0C for a maximum\nof 4 weeks, and then at -80\u00b0C at the central laboratory\n(Eurofins, Breda, The Netherlands), until assayed. The\nbiomarker, PRA was assessed using RIA kits from\nDiaSorin (Stillwater, Minnesota, USA) and aldosterone\nwas measured using RIA Coat-a-Count kits from Siemens\n(Deerfield, Illinois, USA).\nStatistical analyses\nIn this sub-study, CASP was measured at sub-study base-\nline (end of active treatment) and at days 2 and 7 following\ntreatment withdrawal. However, not all patients had valid\nCASP measurements at all sub-study time points. Hence,\ntwo sets of patient populations, based on the extent of\navailability of their CASP data, were analysed. The CASP\ncompleter dataset was obtained from participants who had\nvalid seated CASP measurements at all time points, i.e. at\nthe end of the treatment period (baseline for this analysis)\nand on days 2 and 7 following treatment withdrawal. In\naddition, the CASP randomised dataset was obtained from\nparticipants who had a valid seated CASP measurement at\nleast at one of the above mentioned time points. Changes\nfrom baseline in seated brachial SBP (msSBP), CASP, and\nMASBP were analysed using an analysis of covariance\n(ANCOVA) model with treatment, study region and gen-\nder as factors and baseline mean arterial pressure as a\ncovariate. The primary analysis focussed on changes in\nCASP from the end of the 12-week treatment period to\ndays 2 and 7 of the treatment withdrawal period. Between-\ntreatment analysis was also performed for changes in\nmsSBP, CASP and MASBP from baseline to end of the\nwithdrawal period.\nResults\nPatient disposition\nOf the 1359 patients who entered the placebo run-in period\nof the ASSERTIVE study, 822 were randomised to the\ngroups. Of these patients, 303 (aliskiren, n = 157; telmisar-\ntan, n = 146) participated in the central aortic pressure sub\nstudy (CASP randomised set), of whom 94 patients\n(aliskiren, n = 49; telmisartan, n = 45) had a valid CASP\nmeasurement completed at every time point across the\ntreatment withdrawal period (CASP completer set).\nDemographic and baseline characteristics\nDemographic and baseline characteristics of the sub-study\npopulation were generally comparable between the aliskiren\nand telmisartan groups at randomisation for the CASP ran-\ndomised and CASP completer sets (Table 1).\nEfficacy\nChanges in seated brachial SBP\nIn the CASP randomised set, msSBP was similar between\nboth treatment groups at baseline for the treatment with-\ndrawalperiod,i.e.attheendofthetreatmentperiod(aliskiren,\nas shown in Figure 1(a)).

Accordingly, the response of biomarkers\nfrom end of the treatment period to end of the withdrawal\nperiod is presented.\nIn the CASP randomised set, PRA levels increased dur-\ning 12 weeks of treatment with telmisartan, while it\ndecreased in patients receiving aliskiren (Figure 3(a)).\nSeven days following treatment withdrawal, PRA returned\ntowards baseline with both aliskiren and telmisartan in the\nCASP randomised set. Similarly, in the CASP completer\nset, 12 weeks of treatment was associated with an increase\nin PRA for patients receiving telmisartan, whilst PRA was\nsuppressed in patients receiving aliskiren. Seven days fol-\nlowing treatment withdrawal, PRA returned towards base-\nline values with both treatments in the CASP completer set\n(Figure 4(a)).\nIn the CASP randomised set, 12 weeks of treatment was\nassociated with a decrease in plasma aldosterone levels for\nboth treatments. Plasma aldosterone increased during the\n7-day withdrawal period for both treatments (Figure 3(b)).\nThe increase in aldosterone was greater following with-\ndrawal of telmisartan compared to aliskiren, which was\nstatistically significant (p = 0.013).

The study demonstrates sustained control of\nboth brachial and central BP even after 7 days of aliskiren\nwithdrawal in the CASP completer and randomised sets. In\ncontrast, both brachial and central BP increased gradually\nby 4-5 mmHg over the same time period following with-\ndrawal of telmisartan, indicating a gradual loss of BP con-\ntrol over the withdrawal period. This is the first reported\ndata on the effects of treatment withdrawal on both bra-\nchial and central aortic pressure and extends the previously\nreported observations of differential effects of treatment\nwithdrawal on brachial BP and 24-hour ambulatory bra-\nThe primary focus of this study was a comparison\nbetween treatments for the change in seated CASP fol-\nlowing treatment withdrawal, i.e. from the end of the\n12-week treatment period to day 2 and to the end of the\n7-day treatment withdrawal period in the CASP com-\npleter patients set. To complement the results from the\nCASP completer patients set, we also report changes in\nseated CASP following treatment withdrawal in the\nCASP randomised set. The primary endpoint showed sta-\ntistical significance in favour of aliskiren over telmisar-\ntan in the longevity of CASP control, with little change in\nCASP during the 7-day period following aliskiren with-\ndrawal in both CASP completer and randomised sets.\nMoreover, data from the present study illustrate that the\npattern of change for brachial BP and CASP was broadly\nsimilar following withdrawal of either treatment. From\nthis data it would seem that conventional monitoring of\neither brachial or central pressure is sufficient to deter-\nmine the haemodynamic consequences of treatment with-\ndrawal as these changes occur in parallel during this\nperiod. This concept is also supported by the pattern of\nchange for ambulatory brachial BP across the treatment\nwithdrawal period, which was similar to that seen for\nboth seated brachial BP and CASP in the CASP com-\npleter as well as in the CASP randomised sets.\nWith regard to the longevity of BP lowering across the\ntreatment withdrawal period, aliskiren and telmisartan are\nboth regarded as long-acting drugs from their respective\nclasses. As reported previously, both drugs were very\neffective in decreasing brachial BP in the overall popula-\ntion.19,20 In the present study, both treatments reduced BP\nto the same level following 12 weeks of treatment, such\nthat the baseline brachial and central pressures for the\nwithdrawal period did not differ between treatment arms.\nMoreover, brachial and central pressures remained propor-\ntional across the withdrawal period for both treatments, i.e.\nthere was no evidence of differential effects between the\ntreatments.\nOther studies investigating the influence of simulated\nnon-adherence have assessed effects only on brachial BP\nand have used shorter treatment withdrawal time periods,\ntypically 24\u00ad48 hours. Depending on the treatment regi-\nmen investigated, these studies have generally demon-\nstrated short-term maintenance, or partial loss of BP\ncontrol with increases of 4-5 mmHg occurring over a short\nperiod of time.19 Data from the present study demonstrate\nconsistency with previous findings over a 2-day treatment\nwithdrawal period, and extend the same over a 7-day with-\ndrawal period, demonstrating loss in both brachial and\ncentral BP control upon telmisartan withdrawal but little\nchange upon aliskiren withdrawal. These data demonstrate\nthe sustained duration of action of aliskiren on seated bra-\nchial BP, CASP and brachial ambulatory BP across the\nprolonged treatment withdrawal period of 7 days.\nFigure 4. Mean changes in (a) plasma renin activity (PRA) and (b) plasma aldosterone from end of treatment to end of withdrawal\n(day 7 of withdrawal) for the CASP completer set. Results are expressed as geometric means and error bars indicate 95% CI.\nPersistence in the BP-lowering response to aliskiren\nand telmisartan is consistent with the pattern of biomarker\nactivity monitored across the treatment withdrawal period\nin the CASP completer and the CASP randomised sets. As\nexpected, PRA showed a divergent response over the\n12-week treatment period. As demonstrated previously,\nup-regulation of PRA was observed following active angi-\notensin receptor blockade,13,21 which results from stimula-\ntion of renin secretion in the juxtaglomerular apparatus\n(JGA) in response to elevated circulating angiotensin II\nlevels.22 In contrast, PRA was suppressed during active\ntreatment with aliskiren, thereby reflecting inhibition of\nplasma renin. The extent of inhibition of PRA with\naliskiren was similar to that reported previously.21\nFollowing treatment withdrawal, PRA returned towards\nbaseline levels; however, the extent of this restoration\nappeared to differ between treatments. Thus, at the end of\nthe 7-day withdrawal period, PRA reduced toward base-\nline levels in patients previously randomised to telmisar-\ntan, while there were signs of continued PRA suppression\nfor patients previously randomised to aliskiren.\nActive treatment was associated with suppression of\nplasma aldosterone levels, which returned to near-baseline\nlevels at the end of the 7-day treatment withdrawal period\nfor patients previously randomised to telmisartan. In con-\ntrast, a trend towards continued suppression of plasma\naldosterone throughout the 7-day withdrawal period was\nevident in patients previously randomised to aliskiren.\nThese data imply sustained inhibition of the RAAS with\naliskiren withdrawal, while RAAS activity was gradually\nrestored upon telmisartan withdrawal, and is consistent\nwith other findings using these treatment types.7,13\nPersistence in the BP lowering and aldosterone lower-\ning effects of aliskiren over the 7-day withdrawal period is\nconsistent with tissue localisation studies with this drug.\nAnimal studies indicate persistent accumulation of\naliskiren in the kidney.23 A tissue distribution study in\nhumans indicates affinity for lipophilic tissues,11 providing\na likely rational for the sustained effects of aliskiren on\nRAAS and BP lowering. Typical half-lives for ARBs have\nbeen reported to be between 5 (eprosartan, valsartan) and\n24 (telmisartan) hours. The relatively long half-life for tel-\nmisartan is consistent with the slow restoration of BP and\nbiomarker activity in this study.\nThis study has limitations that must be acknowledged.\nCentral pressure was measured non-invasively as it was\nneither practical nor appropriate to use invasive measure-\nments with frequent visits in this study population. As this\npopulation was late middle-aged and predominantly white\nor Asian, these findings may not be applicable to young or\nblack patients with hypertension. As this was a sub-study\nembedded within the ASSERTIVE trial, and as only 94 out\nof 303 participants had valid central BP measurements at\nevery time point, this study was not powered to investigate\nthe impact of treatment withdrawal on effects beyond BP\nlowering, such as cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, the\nclinical implications of the differences observed in BP\nupon treatment withdrawal are not known.\nIn conclusion, we report for the first time the impact of\ntreatment withdrawal on both brachial and central aortic\npressure, demonstrating that both respond proportionately,\nand that brachial BP is a reasonable surrogate for changes\nin central pressure following withdrawal of these medica-\ntions. The importance of such properties with regard to\ncardiovascular protection needs further investigation.\n"
