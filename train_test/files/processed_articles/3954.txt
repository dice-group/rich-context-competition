    "abstract": "Abstract\nSandhoff disease (SD) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by a mutation in the gene for the\nb-subunit of b-N-acetylhexosaminidase (Hex), resulting in the inability to catabolize ganglioside GM2 within the lysosomes.\nSD presents with an accumulation of GM2 and its asialo derivative GA2, primarily in the central nervous system. Myelin-\nenriched glycolipids, cerebrosides and sulfatides, are also decreased in SD corresponding with dysmyelination. At present, no\ntreatment exists for SD. Previous studies have shown the therapeutic benefit of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-\nmediated gene therapy in the treatment of SD in murine and feline models. In this study, we treated presymptomatic SD\ncats with AAVrh8 vectors expressing feline Hex in the thalamus combined with intracerebroventricular (Thal/ICV) injections.\nTreated animals showed clearly improved neurologic function and quality of life, manifested in part by prevention or attenu-\nation of whole-body tremors characteristic of untreated animals. Hex activity was significantly elevated, whereas storage of\nGM2 and GA2 was significantly decreased in tissue samples taken from the cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, and cervical spinal\ncord. Treatment also increased levels of myelin-enriched cerebrosides and sulfatides in the cortex and thalamus. This study\ndemonstrates the therapeutic potential of AAV for feline SD and suggests a similar potential for human SD patients.\n",

Mutations in the gene\nfor the -subunit of Hex cause SD, leading to excessive\naccumulation of the ganglioside GM2 and its asialo deriva-\ntive GA2 within lysosomes (Gravel et al., 1995).

Several experimental\ntherapies have been examined for the treatment of SD\nincluding bone marrow transplantation, stem cell therapy,\nsubstrate reduction therapy, caloric restriction, enzyme\nreplacement therapy, and gene therapy (Rattazzi et al.,\nRecent studies revealing the success of adeno-associated\nvirus (AAV) gene therapy in treating murine and feline\nSD models demonstrate the potential for successful treat-\nment of human GM2 gangliosidosis (Sargeant et al., 2011;\nAAV gene therapy in SD mice resulted in survival to\n2 years of age, compared with approximately four\nmonths of age for untreated SD mice (Cachon-\nSD cats. The naturally occurring feline model of SD has\nbeen maintained as a research colony and thoroughly\nmouse brain and is more complex. Also, human anatomy\nand lipid profiles are more similar to cat than mouse; thus\nthe treatment of cats was chosen to act as a bridge\nbetween mouse experiments and human clinical trials\nAfter bilateral injection of the thalamus alone, SD cats\ntreated with AAV1 vectors expressing human Hex had\nreduced GM2 ganglioside storage and an increased lifespan\n(Bradbury et al., 2013). However, a pronounced humoral\nimmune response was detected in treated cats, and restor-\nation of Hex activity to the cerebellum was minimal. Second-\ngeneration vectors incorporating the AAVrh8 capsid and\nfeline Hex led to improved longevity with minimal immune\nresponse (Bradbury et al., 2013). Here, we optimize therapy\nof the cerebellum and spinal cord by adding intracerebro-\nventricular (ICV) injection of AAVrh8 vectors to the thal-\namic delivery route proven effective at treating the\ndiencephalon. Also, we examine the lipid profiles of\nAAVrh8-treated SD cats to better assess therapy distribu-\ntion throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and feasi-\nbility of this approach for human clinical application.\nMaterials and Methods\nAnimal Surgery and Treatment Groups\nThe breeding colony of SD cats was maintained at\nAuburn University, AL. The institutional animal care\nand use committee approved the research described\nherein. Affected SD cats were treated at 1.1 to 1.6\nmonths of age (disease onset, 1.3 \u00c6 0.2 months).\nAnesthesia was induced with ketamine (10 mg/kg) and\ndexmedotomidine (0.04 mg/kg) through an intravenous\ncatheter and maintained using isoflurane (0.5% to\n1.5%) in oxygen delivered through an endotracheal\ntube. Cats were positioned sternally for intracranial injec-\ntion using a Horsley\u00adClark stereotaxic apparatus (David\nKopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) and injected with vector\nbilaterally in the thalamus and in the left lateral ventricle.\nCraniotomy sites were made with a 20-gauge needle at the\nfollowing distances (in cm) from bony landmarks on the\nskull:thalamus (relative to bregma), anterior-posterior\n(AP)\u00c00.65, mediolateral (ML) \u00c60.4, dorsoventral (DV)\n\u00c01.6 (from meninges); left lateral ventricle, caudo-\nthalamic notch located by ultrasound guidance through\nthe bregma or median suture after a 1.5-cm incision of the\nscalp. Vector was delivered using a Hamilton syringe\n(Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) with a noncoring\neach thalamus in 10 to 20ml boluses. Injection rate was\n2ml/min, and the needle was raised 0.15 cm between boluses.\nA total of 200ml was injected into the left lateral ventricle at a\ngenomes, which comprise a 1:1 ratio of AAVrh8 vectors\nexpressing the feline Hex  or  subunit, described previously\n(Bradbury et al., 2013). Vectors included the hybrid chicken\n-actin promoter (Cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhan-\ncer fused to the chicken -actin promoter; Matalon et al.,\n2003) and woodchuck hepatitis posttranscriptional regula-\ntory element (WPRE). AAV-treated cats (n\u00bc 4) were eutha-\nnized 16 weeks postinjection for biochemical analysis of\ntherapeutic effect. Controls were age-matched untreated\nnormal cats (n\u00bc 4 for all analyses) and untreated SD cats\n(n\u00bc 5 for enzyme analysis, n\u00bc 6\u00ad7 for storage analysis, and\nn\u00bc 14 for clinical analysis). Disease progression was scored\non a 10-point scale based on gait defects, compiled from\nuntreated SD cats over the last 5 years. Cats received the\nfollowing scores based on gait. Age of onset \u00c6 standard\ndeviation are shown in parentheses: 10, normal\n(2.5 \u00c6 0.3 mos.); 6, instability with occasional falling\nable to stand but not walk (3.9 \u00c6 0.5 mos.); 3, cannot\nstand on 2 consecutive days (humane endpoint, 4.4 \u00c6 0.6\nmonths for untreated SD cats, n \u00bc 14); 2, lateral recum-\nbency; 1, progressive disease. Also, tremor progression\nwas noted as no tremors, fine tremors, whole-body tremors,\nhind limb spasticity, or fore limb spasticity.\nTissue Preparation\nBrains were divided into coronal blocks of 0.6 cm from\nthe frontal pole through the cerebellum. Coronal blocks\n2 ASN Neuro\nfrom the right hemisphere were frozen in optimum\ncutting temperature (OCT) medium and used for analysis\nof Hex distribution by naphthol staining and Hex-specific\nactivity by 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) enzyme assays.\nCoronal blocks from the left hemisphere were halved to\nanalysis of storage material by high-performance thin\nlayer chromatography (HPTLC).\nLipid Extraction for HPTLC\nCNS tissue was homogenized in 3 ml dH2\nO. An aliquot\n(100 ml) of each homogenate was set aside for analysis of\nHex activity. The remaining homogenate was frozen at\n\u00c080C and lyophilized. The weight of the lyophilized\ntissue was measured prior to lipid extraction.\nLyophilized tissues were transferred into 50 ml\nglass screw capped test tubes and rehydrated with\nO. Lipids were extracted from the tissue\nby adding 5 ml CHCl3\nOH 1:1 (v/v). A small mag-\nnetic stirring bar was added, and samples were placed on\na magnetic stirrer at room temperature overnight\nlected. Two milliliters of CHCl3\nadded to the pellets prior to spinning a second time. The\nsecond supernatant was collected and added to the first;\n0 were added to the supernatant creating a final\nO (v/v/v) (Baek\nColumn Chromatography\nIon exchange chromatography was performed to separate\nneutral lipids and cholesterol from acidic lipids and gan-\ngliosides as previously reported (Macala et al., 1983; Baek\net al., 2009). Total lipid extract was applied to a column\ncontaining DEAE sephadex (A-25, GE Healthcare). The\ncolumn was washed twice with 20ml of solvent A, CHCl3\n:\nfraction consisting of the initial eluent plus washes was\ncollected. This fraction contained the cholesterol, phos-\nphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, plasmalogens,\nsphingomyelin, cerebrosides, and asialo-GM2 (GA2). The\ncolumn was then washed with 30ml of solvent B, CHCl3\n:\nand collect acidic lipids and gangliosides.\nNeutral Lipid Purification\nNeutral lipids were dried by rotary evaporation and\nOH 1:1 (v/v). To further\npurify GA2, a 4 ml aliquot of neutral lipids was dried\nunder nitrogen and then base treated with 1 ml of 1 N\nNaOH at 37C for 1.5 hr. The sample was Folch parti-\ntioned as previously described (Kasperzyk et al., 2004).\nThe lower phase containing GA2 and cerebrosides was\nevaporated under nitrogen and resuspended in 4 ml\nGanglioside and Acidic Phospholipid Purification\nThe acidic lipid fraction containing gangliosides was dried\nby rotary evaporation and separated into acidic lipids and\ngangliosides by Folch partitioning as described previously\n2005). After the upper aqueous phase containing ganglio-\nsides was transferred, the lower organic phase containing\nthe acidic lipids was dried under nitrogen and resuspended\nOH 1:1 (v/v). This fraction contained\nfatty acids, cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidyli-\nnositol, and sulfatides.\nResorcinol Assay\nAn aliquot of the upper aqueous phase containing\ngangliosides was evaporated and analyzed for sialic acid\ncontent using a resorcinol assay as previously described\n2004). N-acetylneuraminic acid was used as an external\nstandard. Samples were dissolved in 1 ml of resorcinol\nsulfate, 5 ml 2% resorcinol stock, brought up to 50 ml\nO 1:1 (v/v). Samples were then boiled\nfor 17 min and cooled in an ice bath; 1.5 ml of butyl acet-\nate: 1-butanol 85:15 (v/v) was added to each sample.\nSamples were vortexed and then centrifuged at 1200 \u00c2g\nfor 1 min. The violet supernatant was removed and ana-\nlyzed at 580 nm in crystal cuvettes in the Shimadzu UV-\n1601 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto,\nJapan).\nBase Treatment and Desalting\nThe remaining gangliosides were evaporated under\nnitrogen. Dried gangliosides were base treated with 1 ml\nof 1 N NaOH at 37C for 1.5 hr. Salts were removed from\ngangliosides using a C18 reverse-phase Bond Elute\ncolumn as previously described (Hauser et al., 2004;\nwere applied to columns that were previously equilibrated\nwith 5 ml each of: CHCl3\nOH, and\n0.1 M NaCl. The columns were washed slowly with 20 ml\n0 to remove salts. Gangliosides were eluted from the\ncolumns using 4 ml CH3\nOH followed by 3 ml\nOH 1:1 (v/v) and then dried under nitrogen.\nGangliosides were resuspended in 5 ml CHCl3\nOH\n2:1 (v/v), and an aliquot was analyzed for sialic acid\ncontent.\nRockwell et al. 3\nLipid Analysis by HPTLC\nAll lipids were evaluated qualitatively with HPTLC. Each\nlane was spotted with 1.5 mg sialic acid for gangliosides,\n70 mg of dry weight for neutral lipids, and 200 mg of dry\nweight for acidic lipids and GA2. Purified lipid standards\nwere purchased from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA)\nor were a gift from Dr. Robert Yu (Medical College of\nGeorgia, August, GA). To enhance precision, oleoyl alco-\nhol was added as an internal standard to the neutral and\nacidic lipid standards and samples. Lipids were spotted\non 10 \u00c2 20 cm Silica gel HPTLC plates using a Camag\nLinomat V semiautomatic TLC spotter (Camag Scientific\nInc., Wilmington, NC). Gangliosides were developed in a\nsingle ascending run for 90 min in CHCl3\nO\n(aq). Plates were\nsprayed with resorcinol-HCl reagent and heated at 95C\nface down for 10 min and then face up for an additional\nminute in order to visualize gangliosides (Ando et al.,\ntop in a single ascending run in CHCl3\nO\n(aq). Plates\nwere sprayed with orcinol-H2\nface up for 5 min to visualize GA2 (Svennerholm,\n1957). Neutral and acidic lipid HPTLC plates were devel-\noped to a height of 4.5 or 6 cm, respectively, in\n(v/v/v/v/v). Plates were dried and then developed to the\nbands were visualized by charring with 3% cupric acetate\nin 8% phosphoric acid solution for 7 min as previously\nQuantitation of Individual Lipids\nThe quantitation of individual lipids was performed as\npreviously described (Arthur et al., 2013). Total brain\nganglioside distribution was normalized to 100%, and\nthe percentage distribution was used to calculate sialic\nacid concentration of GM2. To calculate neutral lipids,\nacidic lipids and GA2 density values were fit to a stand-\nard curve of known standard.\nDetermination of Lysosomal Enzyme Activity and\nDistribution\nTotal Hex activity from samples homogenized for HPTLC\nwas determined as previously described using the synthetic\nfluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl--D-\nglucosaminide (MUG; Hauser et al., 2004). For enzyme\nassays on blocks A\u00adO, several frozen sections (50 mm) were\ncut from each coronal block, and lysosomal enzyme activ-\nity was measured as previously described using synthetic\n4-methylumbelliferyl (4MU) fluorogenic substrates\nacetamido-2-deoxy--D-glucopyranoside (MUGS); total\nHex, MUG; -mannosidase, 4MU--D-manopyranoside.\nSpecific activity was expressed as nmol 4MU/mg protein/\nhr. Histochemical staining for total Hex activity was\nperformed on 40 mm frozen sections using 0.25 mM naph-\nthol AS-BI-N-acetyl-B-D-glucosaminide in the presence\nof pararosaniline as previously described (Lacorazza and\nStatistics\nHPTLC and corresponding MUG data were analyzed by\none-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to calculate\nstatistical significance between groups using IMB SPSS\nStatistics 21 software. For pairwise comparisons of lyso-\nsomal enzyme activity, statistics were performed in SAS\n9.2 software using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. One-sided\ntesting is reported for directional significance (i.e., signifi-\ncantly higher or lower), which may otherwise not be rea-\nlized using two-sided testing due to low animal numbers\nwhen using a feline model.\nResults\nOur objective was to determine the degree to which\nAAVrh8 vectors expressing feline Hex  and  subunits\ncould correct the biochemical and behavioral symptoms\nof ganglioside GM2 storage in SD cats when injected into\nthe thalamus combined with intracerebroventricular\n(Thal/ICV) injections (Bradbury et al., 2013). Clinical\ndisease progression was monitored in animals using a\n10-point scoring system based on gait defects in untreated\nanimals (see ``Materials and Methods'' section for\ndescription). Untreated animals experienced hind limb\nmuscle weakness, ataxia, and whole-body tremors by\n2.5 (\u00c6 0.3) months and progressed to humane end\npoint, defined by inability to stand and a clinical rating\ngression was delayed in treated animals. At the predeter-\nmined end point of 16 weeks posttreatment\n(approximately five months of age), treated animals\nreceived an average score of 6.8 (\u00c60.6) with some animals\nexperiencing mild whole-body tremors while others\nexperienced only fine tremors (Figure 1; Supplemental\nTo determine Hex distribution from the injection site\nto other regions of the brain, naphthol staining and\nenzyme assays (MUG and MUGS) were performed for\neach coronal block and each region of the CNS examined\nby HPTLC (Figure 2(a)). Histochemical naphthol stain-\ning revealed widespread distribution of Hex throughout\nthe brain and spinal cord of treated animals (Figure 2(b)\nand (c)).\nThe synthetic substrates MUGS (-subunit preferred)\nand MUG (for total Hex activity) were used to quantify\n4 ASN Neuro\nHex activity in the CNS, which in untreated SD cats was\n2% of normal. In AAV-treated SD cats, total Hex\nactivity in brain averaged 3.7 - to 56.6-fold greater in\nthe treated cats than in normal cats, whereas activity in\nspinal cord was 6.1 - to 16.4-fold greater in treated cats\nthan in normal cats (Table 1). The greatest activity was\nfound in block D, which contains the thalamic injection\nsite. Similar elevations above normal were measured\nusing MUGS substrate (Table 1). Total Hex activity\nwas additionally measured in each brain punch biopsy\nused for HPTLC analysis and ranged from 2 - to 234-\nfold normal in the AAV-treated cats (Table 2). Of the\nsites biopsied for HPTLC, enzyme activity was highest\nin the thalamic injection site and in the cervical intumes-\ncence of the spinal cord.\nThal/ICV AAV treatment reduced total ganglioside\nlum, thalamus, and spinal cord regions, respectively, to\nlevels comparable with those found in normal animals\n(Table 2).\nGM2 accounted for approximately 40% of the total\nganglioside in the various CNS regions of untreated cats.\nTreatment with Thal/ICV AAV injections resulted in a\n!92% decrease of GM2 storage in all CNS regions tested\nwith a 98% decrease in the thalamus (Figure 3).\nCorrection of GM2 storage varied for each animal\ntested as well as between regions for each individual\ncat. In some animals, AAV treatment decreased GM2\nconcentration to below detectable levels, as in the\nnormal cats.\nSimilar reductions were documented in the levels of\nasialo GM2 (GA2) in AAV-treated cats. GA2 was\nundetectable in the CNS regions examined in normal\ncats but was a major storage material in SD cats. AAV\ntreatment reduced GA2 to undetectable levels in the\nthalamus and cervical intumescence of all SD cats\n(Table 2), while average reduction was $ 97% in the\ncortex and cerebellum biopsy sites. Two Thal/ICV treated\nanimals had no detectable GA2 accumulation in any of\nthe regions tested (data not shown for individual animals)\nwhile the remaining cats varied in the amount of correc-\ntion in each region.\nThe concentration of cerebrosides and sulfatides was\nsignificantly lower in the brain regions of untreated\nSD cats compared with normal cats (Table 2, Figures 4\nand 5). This is consistent with previous reports of lower\nFigure 1. Clinical progression of AAV-treated Sandhoff cats.

No differences were\nfound for the concentration of cerebrosides or sulfatides\nin the cervical spinal cord between normal and SD cats\nregardless of treatment. However, unusually high\nvariability in all cohorts may have contributed to incon-\nclusive findings from this region.\nElevation of nonmutant lysosomal hydrolases often\noccurs in lysosomal storage diseases (McCurdy et al.,\nfold higher in untreated SD cats than in normal cats\n(p \u00bc 0.01 for each block; Figure 6). AAV treatment sig-\nnificantly decreased mannosidase activity in all CNS\nregions, though levels remained significantly above\nnormal in three of eight brain regions and six of seven\nspinal cord blocks.\nDiscussion\nNo effective treatments presently exist for persons with\nSD. Recent studies in murine and feline models have\nshown the potential for AAV treatment in the manage-\nment of ganglioside storage diseases (Cachon-Gonzalez\nexamined the effects of thalamic injections, in combin-\nation with ICV injection, on disease progression of SD\ncats using AAVrh8 vectors expressing feline Hex  and .\nHex activity and lipid concentrations were evaluated in\nFigure 2.

SD cats were injected bilaterally in the\nthalamus and the left lateral ventricle with AAVrh8-fHEXA and AAVrh8-fHEXB (1.1 \u00c2 1012 vector genomes total), and tissues were\ncollected 16 weeks later. (a) Shown are injection sites (white circles) and 0.6 cm coronal blocks of the brain (A\u00adH) and spinal cord (I\u00ad\nO) collected at necropsy.

Previous studies\nshowed that axonal transport could facilitate delivery of\nlysosomal enzymes throughout the CNS (Passini et al.,\nthalamus was chosen as the site for AAV injection to\nmaximize the distribution of Hex from vector-transduced\nBruno, 2013). However, previous work (Bradbury et al.,\n2013) demonstrated that thalamic injection alone was not\nsufficient to restore Hex activity to the cerebellum.\nBecause of the vascularity of the posterior fossa and the\nsurgical risk associated with direct injection of the cere-\nbellum, we selected ICV injections for cerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF)-based treatment of the cerebellum, and potentially\nthe spinal cord. Enzyme activity in all regions of the trea-\nted CNS was significantly increased compared with both\nuntreated SD animals and normal animals, and Hex\nreached 5 - to 7-fold normal in the cerebellum compared\nwith a maximum of 0.4-fold normal in animals treated by\nthalamic injection only (Bradbury et al., 2013). Inclusion\nof ICV injection or a similar route is required for effective\ntreatment of the cerebellum. The highest level of enzym-\natic activity occurred in the thalamic injection site, where\nHex activity was 234-fold above normal. While other\nstudies using AAVs have reported brain toxicity caused\nby overexpression of proteins (Georgievska et al., 2002;\nKlein et al., 2006), our previous study using this vector\nfound no evidence of neuron loss or clinical neurological\nsymptoms in normal cats >1.5 years postinjection indi-\ncating no brain toxicity as a result of AAV-mediated\noverexpression of Hex (Bradbury et al., 2013). For this\nreason, we do not believe that the high levels of enzyme\ncause pervasive cytotoxicity in the cat CNS.\nIn addition to axonal transport of Hex to areas of the\nCNS remote from the injection site, the therapeutic mech-\nanism in our study is likely to involve transmission of the\nvector and enzyme through the perivascular space of\nVirchow\u00adRobin (Broekman et al., 2009; Cachon-\nGonzalez et al., 2012). Also, it is known that AAV vec-\ntors transduce ependymal cells (Yamazaki et al., 2014;\nYang et al., 2014) and that lysosomal enzyme is distrib-\nuted throughout the brain parenchyma after CSF-\nmediated delivery of AAV (Liu et al., 2005; Haurigot\net al., 2013). However, because cats in the current study\nwere treated by both CSF and thalamic injection, we\ncannot strictly determine the contribution of each indi-\nvidual route to Hex activity in the brain parenchyma.\nThe storage of GM2 and GA2 in SD causes lysosomal\napoptosis, and CNS inflammation (Huang et al., 1997;\npathology, SD treatment should ultimately correct the\nTable 1.

As seen in Figure 2, our treatment approach gen-\nerated regions of intense activity that tapered to much lower\nlevels within the same coronal section. Nevertheless, neur-\nonal morphology was normalized almost completely\nthroughout the brain (data not shown). Discrete areas of\npersistent neuropathology were thought to coincide with\nareas that received the lowest levels of Hex activity. Rare\nareas of perivascular cuffing and cellular infiltrate were pre-\nsent in the cerebral cortex of treated SD cats but were much\nless pervasive than in our previous study in which mouse\nHex was used for treatment (Bradbury et al., 2013).\nAlthough gangliosides are mostly stored in CNS gray\nmatter, histopathologic changes have been seen in white\nmatter of mice, cats, and humans with SD (Koelfen et al.,\nassociated lipids, cerebrosides and sulfatides, are also\ndecreased in mice, cats, and humans with SD (Sandhoff\ndysmyelination contributes to SD pathogenesis (Kroll\net al., 1995). Our results showed that AAV treatment\nfully or partially restored the level of cerebrosides and\nsulfatides in the thalamus. The lack of correction in the\ncortex and cerebellum despite reduced ganglioside storage\nrequires further investigation but may improve at time\npoints beyond 16 weeks postinjection. If cerebroside/sulfa-\ntide defects persist with time, it is possible that uneven Hex\ndistribution in the brain prevents full correction of the\ndisease phenotype in all cells. Alternatively, strong evi-\ndence has been reported that an early myelin defect in\nSD mice is refractory to standard gene therapy (Cachon-\nGonzalez et al., 2014), which could explain the lack of\ncerebroside/sulfatide restoration distal to the injection\nsite in the current study. Focal rather than global normal-\nization of myelin defects may be responsible for the incom-\nplete arrest of disease progression, though the disease\nphenotype was dramatically improved by treatment.\nThe differences we found for total ganglioside concen-\ntration between the various regions of the untreated cat\nbrain are consistent with observations from previous stu-\net al., 2008) and from human SD patients (Baek et al.,\n2009).

When individual gan-\ngliosides GM2 and GA2 were quantified, some variability\nwas noted between treated animals, though significant cor-\nrection was seen in each region, and every animal had\nsubstantial clearance of ganglioside.\nOur study shows the effectiveness of AAV gene ther-\napy in restoring Hex activity to normal or above-normal\nlevels and attenuating the major lipid abnormalities in SD\ncats. While the initial findings are unusually promising\nfor a large animal model of lysosomal disease, further\nstudies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of\nthe treatment. Examination of clinical effect, enzyme\nactivity, and lipid concentrations of animals that are fol-\nlowed long-term will allow us to better assess the poten-\ntial for translation into human treatment.\n"
