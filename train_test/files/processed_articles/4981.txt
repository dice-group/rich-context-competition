We have reported that chronic activation of\nangiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2\nR) alters RAS components and provides protection against obesity-related kidney injury.\nMaterials and methods: We utilized AT2\nR knockout (AT2\nKO) mice in this study and evaluated the renal expression\nof various RAS components and examined the renal injury after placing these mice on high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks.\nResults: The cortical ACE2 activity and MasR expression were significantly decreased in AT2\nKO mice compared to wild\ntype (WT) mice. LC/MS analysis revealed an increase in renal Ang II levels and a decrease in Ang-(1-7) levels in AT2\nKO\nmice. Cortical expression of ACE and AT1\nR was increased but renin activity remained unchanged in AT2\nKO compared\nwith WT mice. WT mice fed HFD exhibited increased systolic blood pressure, higher indices of kidney injury, mesangial\nmatrix expansion score, and microalbuminuria, which were further increased in AT2\nKO mice.\nConclusion: This study suggests that deletion of AT2\nR decreases the expression of the beneficial ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR\nand increases the deleterious ACE/Ang II/AT1\nR axis of the renal RAS in mice. Further, AT2\nKO mice are more susceptible\nto HFD-induced renal injury.\n",

While ACE/Ang II/AT1\nR is\nknown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of vari-\nous cardiovascular diseases, kidney injury, anti-natriure-\nsis, and hypertension,3\u00ad5 emerging evidence supports a\nprotective role for ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis in heart and\nkidney function, including natriuresis and hypertension.6\u00ad10\nInter-regulatory pathways have been suggested by which\nRAS components alter each other's expression and\nAngiotensin type 2 receptor null\nmice express reduced levels of\nrenal angiotensin converting enzyme-2/\nangiotensin (1-7)/Mas receptor and\nexhibit greater high-fat diet-induced\nkidney injury\nQuaisar Ali, Isha Dhande, Preethi Samuel and Tahir Hussain\n Keywords\nRenin\u00adangiotensin system, angiotensin II type 2 receptor knockout, angiotensin (1-7), Mas receptor\nDepartment of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences,\nUniversity of Houston, USA\nCorresponding author:\nTahir Hussain, Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical\nSciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Houston, Houston,\nEmail: thussain@central.uh.edu\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nfunction. For example, AT1\nR activation decreases ACE2\nMasR activation and function.13,14 Such changes in the\nRAS components cause a shift potentially impacting on\nthe functional balance between deleterious versus protec-\ntive arms of the RAS.\nThe angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2\nR) is another\ncomponent of the RAS, and has not been \"particularly\"\nassigned to either of the RAS axes. However, numerous\nstudies, including some from our laboratory, have shown\nR is natriuretic, anti-hypertensive, and cardio-\nand reno-protective in various animal models.8,15\u00ad18\nTherefore, AT2\nR may be grouped with the protective\nR is termed as `func-\ntional antagonist' of AT1\nR.19 This notion is based on the\nfindings that AT2\nRs, via dimerization with AT1\nsignaling cross-talk, attenuates AT1\n-mediated cellular\nresponses in various cell types including the kidney epi-\nthelial cells.20,21 Additionally, chronic treatment with\nR agonist has been shown to cause a reduction in\nR expression, another mechanism by which AT2\nR can\nreduce AT1\nR function.22 Recently, we have reported that\nlong-term pharmacological stimulation of AT2\nR with\npreferential agonists caused a decrease in AT1\nR-mediated\nrenal function, but increased the expression/activity of\nACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis in the kidney cortex of obese\nZucker rats.8 These changes were associated with\nenhanced natriuresis, lowering of BP, and decreased renal\ninjury in obese animals.8,16 In light of the beneficial effects\nmediated by AT2\nR, the present study is designed to test the\nhypothesis that deletion of AT2\nR (a) decreases the renal\nexpression of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis and increases\nthat of the ACE/Ang II/AT1\nR axis and (b) makes the ani-\nmals more susceptible to kidney injury in response to a\nhigh fat diet (HFD). To test this hypothesis, RAS compo-\nnents in the kidney cortices from AT2\nKO mice and wild\ntype (WT) controls from a similar background were meas-\nured. To demonstrate the reno-protective effect of AT2\nR,\nWT and AT2\nKO mice were fed either a normal fat diet or\na HFD to induce obesity-related glomerulopathy.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals\nKO) mice, which were kindly pro-\nvided by Tadashi Inagami (Vanderbilt University,\nNashville, Tennessee, USA) and wild type with similar\nbackground (C57BL/6) of 20 weeks of age (purchased\nfrom Harlan, Inc.) were used in the study. The animal\nexperimental protocol was approved by the Institutional\nAnimal Care and Use Committee at the University of\nHouston. These animals were euthanized and the kidneys\nwere removed, washed in cold saline and kept frozen at\n\u00ad80\u00b0C for measuring RAS components.\nWestern blotting for AT1\nR and MasR\nThe expression of AT1\nR, and MasR in the kidney cortex\nwas determined by western blotting. For this purpose, the\nkidney cortices were homogenized in a buffer containing\n(in mM) Tris 50, ethylene diaminete tra-acetic acid (EDTA)\n10, Phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) 1 and pro-\ntease inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein (20 g for AT1\nR\nand 40 g for MasR) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and\nwere transferred onto immobilon P (blot). The blots were\nincubated with primary polyclonal antibodies for the\nR, and MasR. Following incubation with the primary\nantibodies, the blots were incubated with Horse radish\nperoxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit Immunoglobulin\ntype G (IgGs). The signal was detected by Enhanced\nchemiluminescence (ECL) system, recorded and analyzed\nby Fluorchem 8800 (Alpha Innotech Imaging System, San\nLeandro, California, USA) for the densitometric analysis.\nThe blots were stripped, and re-probed with -actin mouse\nmonoclonal antibody.\nRenin, ACE2, and ACE activity\nRenin activity in the kidney cortex was measured by\nSensolyte 520 Mouse renin and ACE2 activity was meas-\nured by Sensolyte 390 ACE2 assay kit (Anaspec Inc.,\nFremont, California, USA). The renin and ACE2 activity\nwas determined using Mca/Dnp fluorescence resonance\nenergy transfer (FRET) peptide. In the FRET peptide the\nfluorescence of Mca is quenched by Dnp, upon cleavage\ninto two separate fragments by the enzyme, the fluores-\ncence of Mca is recovered, and is monitored at excitation/\nrenin.ACE concentration was measured by Enzyme linked\nImmunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit (USCN Life Science\nInc, Texas, USA) as per manufacturer's instructions.\nLC/MS quantification of angiotensin peptides\nTo determine angiotensin peptide levels quantitatively in\nthe kidney cortex, tissue was homogenized in lysis buffer\n(10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors. The angio-\ntensin peptides were then analyzed by LC/MS method as\ndescribed in our earlier publication.23,24\nDiet-induced obesity protocol\nMale WT and AT2\nKO mice (four weeks old) were placed\neither on normal diet or HFD for 16 weeks to induce obesity.\nThe HFD feed Teklad custom research diet (TD.06414)\nwith adjusted calorie diet (60/Fat) containing 18.4% protein,\n(code of normal diet) with isocaloric 29% protein, 56% car-\nbohydrate and 15% fat were purchased from Harlan,\nIndianapolis, Indiana, USA. Both diets contained similar\nAli et al. 3\nin metabolic cages during the last week of diet administra-\ntion to collect urine. At the end of the 16-week treatment,\nthe mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation under iso-\nflurane anesthesia following six hours of fasting. Each left\nkidney was fixed in formalin for histological analyses.\nRenal histology and morphometry\nThe formalin-fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin and 4\nm sections were prepared. The slides were further stained\nwith Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) reagents or Masson's tri-\nchrome stain (Dako North America, Inc.) according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions. All tissue samples were eval-\nuated independently by two investigators in a blinded fash-\nion by light microscopy (\u00d7400). For each animal, 30\nglomeruli from each of the three consecutive sections were\nassessed. A semi-quantitative scoring method described by\nRaij et al.25 was used to evaluate the degree of damage to\nthe glomeruli. This was graded according to the severity of\nthe glomerular damage: 0, normal; 1, slight glomerular\ndamage of the mesangial matrix and/or hyalinosis with\nfocal adhesion involving <25% of the glomerulus; 2, scle-\nsclerosis >75% of the glomerulus. A mesangial matrix\nexpansion (MME) score was assigned in a similar manner\non a scale of 0\u00ad4 depending upon the area of the glomeru-\nlus occupied by mesangial matrix when compared to lean\ncontrol glomeruli. The glomerulosclerosis index or mesan-\ngial score was calculated by averaging the grades assigned\nto all glomeruli fields using the formula:\nsclerosis index MME score\n/\n/\n=\n\u00d7 + \u00d7 + \u00d7 + \u00d7\n( ) n\nwhere N1\u00adN4 represent the number of glomeruli with the\nrespective score, n is the total number of glomeruli.\nMeasurement of microalbuminuria\nAn indirect competitive ELISA kit (Exocell, Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania, USA) was used to measure urinary albumin\nexcretion according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nBP\nBP was measured by tail-cuff method using CODA system\nwhich is clinically validated and provides 99% correlation\nwith telemetry and direct BP measurements.26,27 The CODA\ntail-cuff BP system utilizes volume pressure recording (VPR)\nsensor technology to measure the mouse tail BP. BP was\nmeasured during the last two weeks (three days in each week\nwith three readings each day on each animal) of the feeding\nregimen. For each animal, the data for each animal was aver-\naged and treated as one value, which was used to calculate\nmean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM).\nChemicals and reagents\nAntibodies for MasR and  Actin were purchased from\nAlomone Labs Ltd, Israel and Santa Cruz, California, USA\nrespectively.AT1\nRantibodywascustomraised(Biomolecular\nIntegration, Arizona, USA). Standards for Ang II and Ang-\n(1-7) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, St Louis,\nMissouri, USA. All other chemicals were of standard grade.\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean\u00b1SEM and were analyzed using\nGraphPad Prism 4 and subjected to t-test. n=5\u00ad6 in each\ngroup, as detailed in figure legends. A p value of less than\n0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nEffect of deletion of AT2\nR on RAS components\nACE2, Ang-(1-7) and MasR. The cortical ACE2 activity (Fig-\nKO mice. The LC/MS quantifica-\ntion of angiotensin peptides revealed that the levels of Ang-\n(1-7) (Figure 1(b)) was also significantly reduced (WT:\ntex of AT2\nKO compared to WT mice. Similarly, cortical\nMasR band at 47 kDa was significantly reduced in AT2\nKO\nmice (Figure 1(c)).\nACE, Ang II and AT1\nR.ACE in the kidney cortex of AT2\nKO\nwas significantly elevated compared to WT mice (WT\nKO: 3\u00b10.4 ng ACE/\u00b5g tissue). Ang II peptide\nlevels (Figure 2(b)) were significantly higher inAT2\nKO mice\nsue). Western blot of AT1\nR at 41 kDa revealed almost a two-\nfold increase in the kidney cortex of AT2\nKO compared to\nWT mice (Figure 2(c)).\nRenin.Renin activity in the kidney cortex remained\nunchanged between wild type and AT2\nKO mice (Figure 3).\nEffect of deletion of AT2\nR on renal injury\nMarkers of early renal injury.Renal sections were stained\nwith PAS to assess glomerular injury. Early pathological\nchanges, including glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial\nexpansion, and basement membrane thickening, were\nobserved in WT and AT2\nKO mice maintained on the HFD\nwhile the renal morphology of ND-fed WT and AT2\nKO\nmice was normal (Figure 4(a) and (b)). MME scores were\nhigher in HFD-fed AT2\nKO mice compared to WT mice\nfed the HFD (Figure 4(a) and (b)). Masson's trichrome\nstain was used to evaluate tubulointerstitial collagen depo-\nsition. No tubulointerstitial fibrosis was detected in any of\nthe treatment groups (data not shown). WT mice on HFD\n4 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nexcreted increased amounts of albumin in the urine, and\nlack of AT2\nR in HFD-fed mice modestly increased the uri-\nnary albumin excretion (Figure 4(c)). The urinary albumin\nexcretion was within normal values in WT and AT2\nKO\nmice on ND (Figure 4(c)).\nEffect of deletion of AT2\nR on systolic BP. As shown in Figure\n5, systolic BP in AT2\nKO on normal diet was modestly but\nsignificantly higher compared to WT. High fat diet signifi-\ncantly increased systolic BP in both WT andAT2\nKO. How-\never, the BP levels were similar in WT HFD and AT2\nKO\nHFD mice.\nDiscussion\nThe most notable finding of the current study is that AT2\nR\ndeficient mice expressed a decreased level ofACE2/Ang-(1-\n7)/MasR while ACE/Ang II/AT1\nR increased in the kidney\ncortex. This shift in the balance of RAS components resulted\nin greater susceptibility to obesity-induced renal injury,\nwhich highlights the critical role of AT2\nR in regulating renal\nRAS components and exerting reno-protective effects.\nACE2 is an important RAS enzyme which converts\nAng II to Ang-(1-7). Similar to AT2\nR, Ang-(1-7) via the\nMasR, can oppose the actions of Ang II mediated via\nR28\u00ad31 and can exert vasodilatation, natriuresis, and\nreno-protection. It has been shown that stimulation of\nMasR inhibits the AT1\nR-mediated regulation of ERK1/2\nactivity,32 a critical enzyme involved in cell growth and\ntissue remodeling under various pathological conditions.\nMasR is considered reno-protective, and blockade or dele-\ntion of this receptor has been shown to cause reduced\nnatriuresis, increased proteinuria, and reduced renal blood\nR expression in the kidney is markedly\nincreased along with reduced glomerular tuft diameter,\nincreased collagen and fibronectin in MasR knockout\nFigure 1.

Moreover, consistent\nwith other reports,36,37 we also observed that deletion of\nR significantly increased AT1\nR expression in the kid-\nney cortex. Additionally, Ang II levels were also elevated\nin the kidney cortex of AT2\nKO mice.\nThe inter-regulatory role of AT2\nR in the two arms of\nRAS seems to be complex but can be plausibly explained.\nThe enhanced AT1\nR expression in AT2\nKO mice kidney\ncould be a result of the reduced expression on MasR in\nthese animals, as earlier study has shown that deletion of\nMasR causes an increase in the AT1\nSubsequently, it is likely that the increase in AT1\nR\nFigure 2.

Values\nare represented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM);\n6 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nexpression and activation by higher Ang II concentration,\nas observed in this study, causes a reduction in ACE2\nexpression and activity leading to the reduced Ang-(1-7)\nproduction. Earlier studies have shown such relationship\nin that Ang II via activation of AT1\nR causes a reduction in\nACE2 expression and activity, thus reduces Ang-(1-7) pro-\nduction in cardiac myocytes.11 However, we have recently\nreported that the AT2\nR activation may have direct positive\nregulation of ACE2 expression and activity, without the\ninvolvement of AT1\nRs.8 Thus it's likely that AT2\nR may\nhave a direct as well as indirect role in regulating the pro-\ntective and deleterious arms of the RAS. However, sys-\ntemic studies are needed to delineate the role of AT2\nR in\nregulating various RAS components.\nThe functional relevance of AT2\nR deletion and of the\nshift in the two arms of the RAS was studied in animals\nsubjected to high fat diet, which is known to cause renal\ninjury. As expected HFD fed WT mice developed renal\ninjury evidenced by MME and microalbuminuria in these\nanimals. However, AT2\nKO mice on HFD developed\nFigure 4.

Both \nKO ND mice.\nAli et al. 7\ngreater renal injury, suggesting a protective role of AT2\nR.\nKO per se had no changes in MME and microal-\nbuminuria, it could be argued that AT2\nR-mediated protec-\ntion occurs only under pathogenic conditions, such as\nobesity. This notion is further supported by other studies,38\nincluding ours,16 which show that pharmacological activa-\ntion of AT2\nR protects against nephropathy in obese rats\nand diabetic animal models and had no injurious effects in\nnormal animals. Hypertension is a known risk factor for\nrenal injury.39 It is likely that the injury in HFD fed WT\nmice was related to elevated BPin these animals. However,\nKO mice on HFD had similar elevated BP as WT\nHFD, yet exhibited greater renal injury, suggesting\nBP-independent protection by AT2\nR. This AT2\nR-mediated\nprotection could be related to its anti-oxidative stress and\nanti-inflammatory activity, as reported recently.16,40\nConsistent with a previous study,41 AT2\nKO mice had mod-\nest elevation in BP, which had no significant impact on\nkidney structure and albuminuria. In the present study we\nfound an imbalance of RAS components with AT2\nKO\nwithout alteration in mesangial area and albuminuria.\nAlthough the levels of renal Ang II and AT1\nR were\nincreased, this may not be enough to induce kidney injury\nand MME. In a recent study, Kim et al.,42 demonstrated\nthat even onset of early chronic kidney disease in an exper-\nimental model is not sufficient to cause glomerular injury\nor collagen deposition. This suggests that a simple increase\nin a deleterious RAS component may not lead to kidney\ndamage. Indeed, we have recently shown that obese rats\ntreated with high salt leads to increase in superoxide via\nNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate- oxidase\n(NOX) and increased oxidative stress in kidney.43\nSuperoxide can directly affect the glomerular barrier and\nincreases Na reabsorption leading to hypertension and\nrenal injury in obese rats and Dahl salt sensitive rats.\nFurther, activation ofAT2\nR by the non-peptide agonist C21\nreduces the Ang II level, expression of p47phox-NOX\nsubunit, superoxide formation and salt-sensitive rise in\nBP,22,43 but had no effects on Ang II levels or oxidative\nstress in obese rats treated with normal diet.8 This suggests\nthat the adverse effect of AT2\nR deletion can be seen only\nunder pathogenic conditions. The limitation of this study is\nthe fact that we did not design this study to assess renal or\nplasma components of RAS in AT2\nKO HFD mice, there-\nfore it is unclear whether RAS components have changed\nin response to HFD per se and whether those changes\nmight have further contributed to the renal injury inAT2\nKO\nmice. However, collectively our data highlights the impor-\ntance of AT2\nR under pathogenic conditions, such as obe-\nsity, where it plays a protective role. The contribution of\nvarious components of the RAS in the face of opposing\nchanges in obesity warrants a detailed systematic study.\nIn summary, we observed that deletion of AT2\nR caused\nan elevation in renal ACE/Ang-II/AT1\nR and reduction in\nACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR expression leading to a shift from\nbeneficial to deleterious axis of RAS. Thus, owing to the\nbeneficial role of renal AT2\nR, it could be considered as a\npotentially important therapeutic target in preventing obe-\nsity related renal injury.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial\nsupport for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle: The study is supported by National Institute of Health\nReferences\n1.
