The ECB distinguishes an `economic' and a `monetary' pillar:1\n\u00b7 \"Economic analysis assesses the short to medium-term determinants of price de-\nvelopments. The focus is on real activity and financial conditions in the econ-\nomy. The economic analysis takes account of the fact that price developments\nover those horizons are influenced largely by the interplay of supply and demand\nin the goods, services and factor markets.\"\n\u00b7 \"Monetary analysis focuses on a longer-term horizon than the economic analy-\nsis. It exploits the long-run link between money and prices. The monetary analysis\nmainly serves as a means of cross-checking, from a medium to long-term per-\nspective, the short to medium-term indications for monetary policy coming from\nthe economic analysis.\"\nIn terms of economic theory, the long-run link noted by the ECB is related to the equa-\ntion of exchange, that is, the definition of the velocity of money. Rewritten in growth\nterms it relates money growth, inflation and output growth to the change in velocity. In\nthe long-run, once output growth and the change in velocity have settled down to trend,\nthe equation of exchange implies a proportional relationship between money growth and\ninflation. In terms of empirics, this relationship has manifested itself most clearly in pe-\nriods of very high inflation. Recent empirical assessments, however, have re-emphasized\nits validity in periods of moderate to low inflation in leading industrial economies.2\nOn this basis, Gerlach (2003, 2004) has proposed to augment the standard Phillips\ncurve, which accounts for shorter-term inflation dynamics, resource utilization gaps and\ninflationary shocks, with a measure of long-run or low-frequency money growth.3 His\nestimates indicate a direct effect of filtered money growth on inflation. Such an aug-\nmented Phillips curve unifies the two pillars of the ECB in a single assessment of in-\nflationary risks, and--if treated as a structural relationship--provides a rationale for\nincluding filtered money growth in the central bank's optimal interest rate rule. Con-\nsequently, optimal interest rate policy would embody a small but systematic response\nto ongoing monetary developments. The ECB's description of its strategy, however,\ndoes not rely on a direct effect of money on inflation in the Phillips curve. Rather, it\n1See http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/monetarypolicy2004en.pdf.\ninflation zones including low inflation and deflation.\n3A similar proposal has been made by Neumann and Greiber (2004).\nfocuses on the long-run link and its usefulness for identifying medium- to long-term in-\nflationary risks. Thus, we aim to develop an alternative rationale for including money in\nthe policy rule that stays as close as possible to the ECB's stated reasons. The ECB's\nformer chief economist, Otmar Issing, wrote on the monetary pillar: \"In line with the\nargument of a closer relationship between money and inflation at lower frequencies, the\nfunction ascribed to the monetary pillar is to reveal medium-term risks to price stability\n..\" but \"... there is no mechanical monetary policy reaction to deviations of M3 growth\nfrom the reference value\" and \"... cross-checking the information from the economic\nanalysis with the information from the monetary pillar is ... a crucial element underpin-\nning the robustness and medium-term policy orientation\". He concludes: \"you can also\nthink of the monetary pillar as the institutionalized promise of what the ECB will con-\ntinue to do in the future; cultivating, as far as possible, an approach to central banking\ngeared towards constant learning and encompassing all available information relevant\nfor monetary policy\".4\nWe formally characterize ECB-style cross-checking using a policy rule with two\ncomponents. The first component aims to control inflationary risks based on a standard\nPhillips curve and aggregate demand relationship. Essentially, it is the optimal interest\nrate rule of an inflation-targeting central bank. If implemented successfully this rule\nshould ensure that inflation averages around the central bank's inflation target. Its weak-\nness is that it relies on knowledge of unobservables such as the equilibrium real interest\nrate and potential output that may be subject to large and persistent policy mispercep-\nThe second component captures the idea of cross-checking using the long-run rela-\ntionship between money and inflation. We assume that the central bank checks regularly\nwhether a filtered money growth series adjusted for output and velocity trends averages\naround the inflation target. If the central bank obtains successive signals of a sustained\ndeviation of inflation from target it adjusts interest rates accordingly.\nOur simulations indicate that persistent policy misperceptions regarding potential\noutput induce a policy bias that translates into persistent deviations of inflation and\nmoney growth from target. In this case, our \"two-pillar\" policy rule may effectively\noverturn the policy bias. Cross-checking relies on filtered series of actual money and\noutput growth without requiring estimates of potential output. Nevertheless, it leads to\nadjustments in interest rate policy that offset the bias resulting from policy mispercep-\ntions. Indirectly, however, it helps the central bank to learn the proper level of interest\nrates.\n2 Money growth and inflation in the long run\nThe equation of exchange defines velocity, vt\n= -mt\n+ pt\n+yt\n, where (m,y, p) denote the\nlogarithms of money, output and the aggregate price level. Taking first differences we\napproximate the equation in growth terms:\nvt\n= -mt\n+pt\n+yt\n is the first-difference operator. In the long-run, output growth and the change in veloc-\nity will settle down to trend and reveal a proportional relationship between money growth\nand inflation. In the short-run, however, fluctuations in velocity and output growth are\nlikely to obscure this relationship. The behavior of velocity may be characterized as a\nfunction of the nominal interest rate, i, real output and money demand shocks, md, using\na standard money demand equation:\nmt\n- pt\n= yyt\n-iit\n+md\nt\nHere, y\ndenotes the income elasticity and i\nthe semi-interest rate elasticity of money\ndemand. Money demand shocks are assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero\nand variance 2\nmd\n. Taking first differences, re-arranging (2) and combining with (1) we\nobtain:\n)y+i\ni+md\nLong-run equilibrium values (superscript *) can then be determined as follows. In the\nlong-run, money demand shocks would average to zero, and the nominal interest rate\nwould settle down to its steady state level. Thus, the long-run trend in velocity corre-\nsponds to v\nt\n)y\nt\n, and long-run inflation is proportional to long-run money\ngrowth adjusted for output and velocity trends:6\np\nt\n= m\nt\n-y\ny\nt\nRecent studies obtained empirical support for this long-run relationship using var-\nious filters or frequency-specific estimation. And more interestingly, they have found\nmoney growth to lead inflation at this frequency. To give an example, Gerlach (2004)\nuses the following filter\nf\nt\n= f\n+ t\n-f\nto approximate long-run values of inflation and money growth. In his work, t\nmay\nalternatively stand for money growth, mt\n, or money growth adjusted for output growth.\n6A trend in velocity may not only arise from potential output growth y\nt\nwith an income elasticity y\ndifferent from unity, but also from other sources such as financial innovations (see Orphanides and Porter\nIn our paper we will follow equation (4) and adjust money growth using the estimate of\nthe income-elasticity of money demand, i.e.\nf\nt\n= mf\nt\n-y\nyf\nt\n3 Monetary policy design without money\nMost research on monetary policy rules in the last two decades has focused on models,\nin which the monetary transmission mechanism works as follows: the nominal interest\nrate affects the real interest rate due to price rigidity, the real rate influences the output\ngap via aggregate demand and the output gap impacts on inflation via a standard Phillips\ncurve. Thus, monetary aggregates play no direct role in the transmission of policy from\nnominal interest rates to inflation.7 Money supply instead is determined recursively from\na money demand equation.\nTo illustrate this point we use a simple New-Keynesian style model with backward-\nlooking expectations in the spirit of Svenssson (1997), Rudebusch and Svensson (1999)\nand Orphanides and Wieland (2000). The model consists of a Phillips curve and an\naggregate demand equation:\nt\n= e\n+y\n(yt\n-y\nt\n)+,t\nyt\n-y\nt\n= ye\n-y,e\n-r\n(it\n-e\n-r\nt\n)+y,t\nwhere e\n, ye\n-y,e\n-y\n.\nt\n= pt\ndenotes inflation, (,t\n,y,t\n) stand for zero-mean cost-push and demand shocks\nrespectively with variances (2\n\ny\n), r denotes the long-run equilibrium interest rate\nand the superscript e refers to market expectations, which we assume to be backward-\nlooking.\nAn inflation-targeting central bank would set the nominal interest rate it\nin order to\nminimize expected discounted inflation deviations from target\nmin\nit\nEt\n\n\ns=t\ns-t (s\nwhere  denotes the central bank's inflation target and  its discount factor. Conse-\nquently, optimal monetary policy corresponds to a Taylor-style interest rate rule, which\nresponds to lagged inflation and output gaps but not to money growth:\niopt\nt\n= r\nt\n+\ny\nr\n-)+\nr\n-y\n7Exceptions are studies of the so-called `P-star' model, originally of Hallman, Porter and Small (1991),\nThe superscript `opt' refers to `optimal'.\nTo be clear, the central bank achieves the desired interest rate setting by conducting\nopen-market operations that influence the money supply. Thus, the money supply is\ndetermined according to the money demand equation (2) consistently with the desired\npolicy rate, current output and the price level. However, money does not appear as a\nvariable in the central bank's optimal interest rate rule and the remainder of the economy\nis automatically insulated from money demand shocks. Of course, the model defined by\nequations (7), (8), (10) and (2) also exhibits the long-run relationship between money\ngrowth and inflation discussed in the preceding section and emphasized by the ECB's\nmonetary pillar.\n4 The two-pillar Phillips curve and policy design\nInspired by the evidence for the long-run relationship between money and inflation, Ger-\nlach (2003, 2004) proposed to include a filtered measure of money growth or adjusted\nmoney growth in the estimation of the short-run Phillips curve. A simplified version of\nthe two-pillar Phillips curve is given by\nt\n= f\nt\n+y\n(yt\n-y\nt\n)+,t\nwhere we define adjusted filtered money growth f\nt\nas in equations (5) and (6) and as-\nsume that the weights on filtered money growth and lagged inflation sum to one, i.e.\n.\nIn this subsection, we intend to make just one simple point. Namely, if any central\nbank were to consider this empirical two-pillar Phillips curve as a structural relationship8\nit would conclude that a measure of filtered money growth should enter in its interest\nrate rule. Replacing the standard accelerationist Phillips curve in (7) with the two-pillar\nPhillips curve (11) we proceed to derive the optimal interest rate rule for the model\nt\n=\ny\nr\ny\nr\n+\ni\nr\nt\n+\ny\nr\ny\nr\n+\ni\n+\n\ny\nr\n+\ni\n\n+\ny\ny\nr\n+\ni\n+\n\ny\nr\n+\ni\n.\nThe superscript 2p refers to the two-pillar Phillips curve underlying this rule. It is more\ncomplicated than the rule given by (10) because the nominal interest rate influences\n8Gerlach typically refrains from a structural interpretation with the exception of Gerlach (2004) where he\nintroduces long-run money growth as a proxy for market expectations of inflation. Theoretical foundations\nfor direct effects of money on aggregate demand and inflation can be obtained from micro-founded models\nthat allow for non-separability of money and consumption in household utility. Empirical implementations,\nhowever, have failed to detect strong direct effects (cf. Ireland (2004) and Andres et al. (2006)).\ninflation not only via aggregate demand but also via a small contribution of current\nmoney supply to filtered money growth, f\nt\n. Substituting out this effect leaves us with\nthe lagged interest rate and the lagged money demand shock in the rule. However, the\nmost important new element is the lagged filtered (and adjusted) money growth rate f\n.\nOf course, if the coefficient on filtered money growth in the two-pillar Phillips curve, \n,\nis set to zero, the interest rule again collapses to the specification without money in (10).\n5 ECB-style cross-checking and policy design\nThe interest rate rule derived in the preceeding section can be viewed as a possible in-\nterpretation of the ECB's two pillar strategy. Our understanding, however, is that the\nECB's strategy as stated does not require a direct effect of money on inflation in the\nPhillips curve. The ECB's description of cross-checking suggests to us that it uses the\nmonetary pillar to accumulate evidence signalling trend changes in inflation. The mon-\netary pillar appears to stand for the ECB's concern for `robustifying' its policy under\nuncertainty and is subjected to regular scrutiny and learning.\nThus, we develop an alternative characterization of ECB-style cross-checking that\nstays as close as possible to the ECB's own description. Our proposed interest rate rule\nhas two components:\nt\n= iEA\nt\n+iMA\nt\nHere the superscript CC refers to cross-checking, EA to the interest rate setting implied\nby the ECB's `economic analysis' and MA to an additive adjustment in interest rate\nsetting that arises from the ECB's `monetary analysis'. We set the first component equal\nto the optimal interest rate rule in the baseline model:\nt\n= iopt\nt\nThis interest rate setting should ensure that inflationary risks based on a standard Phillips\ncurve are controlled perfectly and inflation fluctuates randomly around the mean, .\nHowever, this component relies on knowledge of unobservables such as the equilibrium\nreal interest rate, r, or potential output, y, that may be subject to large and persistent\npolicy misperceptions.\nThe second component, iMA\nt\n, is novel and captures the idea of cross-checking us-\ning the long-run relationship between money and inflation. This component is additive\nand persistent, because it is intended to offset persistent policy biases due to imperfect\ninformation. We assume that the central bank regularly tests whether filtered and ad-\njusted money growth, f , still averages around the inflation target. Thus, the central\nbank computes the normally-distributed test statistic,\n =\nf\n-\nf\nand checks whether  deviates from a critical value crit. f\ndenotes the standard de-\nviation when iEA\nt\n= iopt is implemented with correct values of potential output and the\nmean of f corresponds to . If the central bank obtains successive signals of a sus-\ntained deviation from target, i.e. ( > crit for N periods) or ( < -crit for N periods),\nit responds by adjusting interest rates accordingly.9\nt\n=\n\n\n\n\n\ny\nr\n)(f\n-) if  > crit or  < -crit for N periods\nAs long as iEA\nt\n= iopt\nt\nis implemented with full knowledge of potential output, y\nt\nand the\nreal equilibrium rate, r, cross-checking with regard to iMA\nt\nwill almost never lead to an\nadjustment in interest rates. Under imperfect knowledge, however, cross-checking may\nonce in a while have a very important effect on interest rate policy.10\n6 Cross-checking and policy misperceptions\nRecent research exploiting data on historical revisions to real-time estimates of the out-\nput gap has identified very persistent policy misperceptions.11 The persistence of mea-\nsurement errors arises primarily from biased estimates of unobservable potential output,\nsince revisions to actual output decline more rapidly than those to the output gap. Thus,\nif a central bank relies on potential output measures in policy design, its policy stance\nmay be biased for a sustained period of time. To illustrate this effect we define the policy-\nmaker's estimate of potential output, ^\ny\nt\n= y\nt\n+biast\n, as the sum of true potential output\nand a measure of the misperception denoted by biast\n, and include it in the baseline rule:\nt\n= iopt\nt\n= r\nt\n+\ny\nr\n-)+\nr\n-y\n9The response coefficient on inflation deviations from target is the same as in iEA\nt\n, namely 1\ny\nr\n.\n10The two parameters of iMA\nt\n, crit and N play different roles. crit reflects the probability that an observed\ndeviation of f from  is purely accidental (for example a 5% or 1% significance level). N defines the\nnumber of successive deviations in excess of this critical value. Thus, the greater N the longer the central\nbank waits to accumulate evidence of a sustained policy bias. For example, if crit is set to the 1% critical\nvalue for the normal distribution (2.575) and the critical number of periods of sustained deviations N is set\nto 4, the probability of such an event in the absence of policy misperceptions would be less than 10-8.\n11See Orphanides (2003) and Orphanides et al. (2000) who estimate a worst-case process of mispercep-\ntions with a near unit root (0.96) and standard deviation of 3.77% using quarterly revisions from 1966 to\nThe resulting bias in interest rate policy will induce a persistent deviation of inflation\nfrom target. For example, if the central bank's estimate of potential output were to\nremain permanently 1% above its true level (i.e. biast\n= 1t), average inflation would\nincrease by (y\nr\n)(r\n)-1 percentage points.\nTo illustrate this point further we calibrate the model with the standard Phillips curve\nand backward-looking expectations defined by equations (7), (8) and (2). The calibration\nof the parameters is summarized in Table 1. We then simulate the interest rate rule (17)\nTable 1: Calibration\nParameter Value Economic interpretation\n-r -1 Real interest rate elasticity of aggregate demand (in line\ny 0.5 Elasticity of Phillips curve w.r.t. output gap (broadly in\ny 0.1 Income elasticity of money demand (in line with Andes\n-i -0.4 Interest rate elasticity of money demand (in line with An-\n 0.2 Weighting parameter of filter (broadly in line in Gerlach\nr,y\nt\n, 2 Equilibrium real interest rate, potential output growth and\ninflation target\n,y\n,md\n0.8 Standard deviation of cost-push, demand and money de-\nmand shocks\n\nf\ncrit 1% Critical value for the cross-checking rule.\nN 4 Number of periods required for a sustained deviation in\nthe cross-checking rule.\nwith the following sequence of policy misperceptions:\nThe central bank's initial estimate of potential output is assumed to coincide with the\ntrue value. In periods 11 to 14 the central bank begins to overestimate potential output\nleading to a bias of 4% from period 14 onwards. In the calibrated model this misper-\nception will cause a bias of -4% in the central bank's interest rate response to short-run\ninflationary risks. Ultimately, this policy bias will induce an increase in average inflation\nof 2 percentage points. Accordingly, money growth and the long-run level of nominal\ninterest rates will also rise by 2 percentage points. \u00bfFrom period 100 onwards the cen-\ntral bank's overestimate of potential output declines to 1% and the resulting deviation in\naverage inflation to 0.5 percentage points.\nFigure 1: Output Gap Misperceptions and the Money-Inflation Link\n\nTime\ny-y*\nTime\ni\nTime\nm\nTime\nf\nTime\nf\nTime\nFigure 1 presents a simulation of the consequences of policy misperceptions for\na single draw of normally-distributed cost-push, demand and money demand shocks.\nGiven the many alternative sources of short-run fluctuations in inflation the persistent\nincrease due to policy misperceptions cannot be immediately read from inflation real-\nizations. Nevertheless, the filtered measures of inflation, f , and money growth, mf ,\neventually reveal the increase in average money growth and inflation. This simulation\nshows how policy misperceptions regarding potential output would render the long-run\nrelationship between money growth and inflation quite apparent in the data. In the short\nrun, however, money growth may deviate substantially from inflation due to movements\nin interest rates and output as well as money demand shocks.\nThis simulation emphasizes the weakness of the policy rule, iEA\nt\n= iopt, in the event\nof persistent misses on potential output. A similar effect would arise from incorrect\nestimates of the equilibrium real interest rate r. Of course, one may argue that the\nprocess of misperceptions in (17) is an extreme example and that the central bank will\nlearn from its mistakes. Thus, we proceed to show that cross-checking as defined by\nthe rule in equation (16) provides a convenient and effective avenue for learning and\ncorrecting the central bank's policy bias.\nWe repeat the preceding simulation using the cross-checking rule, iCC\nt\n, defined by\n(16) which includes an additive and persistent adjustment in the event of sustained de-\nviations of filtered (adjusted) money growth from target.

The interest rate adjustment of ( 1\ny\nr\n)(f\n-) almost perfectly offsets\nthe policy bias arising from potential output, ( 1\nr\n). Once the misperception of\npotential output declines after period 100, cross-checking soon leads to another adjust-\nment of interest rates. In the preceding simulation the parameters of the cross-checking\nrule were set as follows: crit was set to the 1% critical value (2.575) and the number of\nperiods required for a sustained deviation, N, was equal to 4 periods.

Consequently, it takes\nlonger to detect a persistent change and the interest adjustment from cross-checking\nFigure 3: Sensitivity Analysis Regarding the Performance of Cross-Checking\ni\nt\nMA, bias\nt\ni\nt\nMA, bias\nt\ni\nt\nMA\nbias\nt\ni\nt\nMA, bias\nt\nTime\ni\nt\nMA, bias\nt\nTime\nhappens somewhat later in the top left panel than in the bottom left panel of Figure 3.\nLowering crit to the 5-percent level (i.e. 1.96) renders cross-checking more sensitive\nto trend changes in money growth. Consequently, the interest-rate adjustments happen\nsomewhat earlier in the second column of panels than in the first column.\nWe have reviewed two possible rationales for including a smoothed measure of money\ngrowth in the central bank's interest rate rule. First, we have confirmed that the two-pillar\nPhillips curve presented in the recent literature\u00adif considered a structural relationship\u00ad\nwould provide such a rationale. More interestingly, however, we have also shown that\nmoney can still play a very useful role in the central bank's interest rate rule if the\neconomy corresponds to a more standard model, which does not incorporate a direct\neffect of money on inflation.\nWe have presented a novel, formal characterization of ECB-style cross-checking. To\nour knowledge this is the first formal characterization of the ECB's two pillar strategy\nwith cross-checking as an interest rate rule. Under the unrealistic assumption that the\ntrue values of potential output and equilibrium real interest rates are known to the cen-\ntral bank our specification of cross-checking would never come into play. However, with\nimperfect knowledge there is a possibility of policy misperceptions. These mispercep-\ntions may generate sustained deviations of inflation from target. Due to the long-run link\nbetween money growth and inflation these deviations are also apparent in filtered mea-\nsures of money growth. Thus, a central bank that responds to persistent and significant\ndeviations of money growth by adjusting interest rates can effectively offset the policy\nbias arising from misperceptions about potential output and other unobservables.\nOur findings open up several interesting avenues for further research. For exam-\nple, allowing for unforeseen, permanent shifts in velocity, i.e. shifts in money demand\nparameters, the information content of long-run money growth would depend on how\nquickly the central bank learns the new parameter values.12 Furthermore, we have\nfocused on strict inflation targeting with backward-looking expectations. In this case,\ncross-checking for persistent shifts is relatively straightforward as inflation and adjusted\nmoney-growth are expected to be white-noise processes. Extending the analysis to allow\nfor partially forward-looking market expectations would not change this feature of our\neconomy. However, flexible inflation targeting (with the output gap in the central bank's\nloss function) would introduce mean reversion in inflation and adjusted money growth\ndynamics. In this case, a more sophisticated test may be required for cross-checking.\nFinally, our baseline model may be extended to render filtered money growth a leading\nindicator of filtered inflation, such that it clearly dominates filtered inflation as the object\nof cross-checking.\nReferences\nAndres, Javier, David J.
