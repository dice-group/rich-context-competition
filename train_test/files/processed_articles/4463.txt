    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis aim of this study was to explore which kinds of working situations are regarded by psychologists as being particularly\ndetrimental to their identity (personal and professional), how these situations are appraised in terms of threat and/or\nchallenge, and what their impact is on perceived stress, work satisfaction, and perceived threat to occupational status. In\nall, 842 French psychologists answered an open format question requesting them to report a situation that was particularly\ndifficult for them as a person and/or as a psychologist (analyzed by the way of a content analysis), and a questionnaire\ncontaining our dependant variables. Four major categories of situations were highlighted. While the first three were positively\nlinked to threat, the \"patient relations\" category was negatively correlated with it. \"Threat to personal identity\" mediated the\nrelationship between difficult situations and perceived stress. Situations appraised as being identity-threatening are mostly\nthe same than those found in the stress literature and are stressful because of their impact on personal identity. Moreover,\nfor psychologists, relations to patients, which are at the heart of the profession, seem to be protective regarding stress and\nidentity threats.\n",

People are\ndevoting more and more time and energy to their work and\nputting a lot of themselves into it. Work is becoming an inte-\ngral part of our identity, serving at least partly to define us\npersonally and professionally, position us in the social hier-\narchy, and make us feel competent and useful--in short, giv-\ning us a positive identity (Ashforth & Mael, 1989; Gini,\n1998). This is the positive side of work.\nAt the same time, maybe because of this high degree of\ninvolvement and centrality, work now places many con-\nstraints and demands on employees. People have to become\nmore involved, put in more hours, work ever faster (even if it\nis to the detriment of quality), have ever higher qualifica-\ntions, contend with problematic colleagues, and so on and so\nforth. This is the negative side of work, which, because orga-\nnizations are so demanding, can be a source of stress.\nThe literature on organizational stress is extremely wide\nranging (Dewe, O'Driscoll, & Cooper, 2010; Schabracq,\nWinnubst, & Cooper, 2003). Numerous studies have shown\nthat organizational stress has a great many negative conse-\nquences on individuals' physical and psychological health\neconomic and organizational issues. Nevertheless, this litera-\nture has mostly focused on the impact of stressors, such as\npsychological and physical demands, workload, or bad inter-\npersonal relationships at work, on perceived stress. Although\nsome of these stressors are psychological in nature and affect\nthe way in which individuals appraise such situations (i.e., as\nthreats or challenges to well-being), relatively little attention\nhad been paid to their impact on identity. And yet, given the\ncentrality of work for identity (Gini, 1998; Schaufeli &\nwould expect certain difficult situations to be appraised not\nonly with regard to what they mean in terms of threats or\nchallenges to well-being (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), but\n1Universit\u00e9 de Reims, France\n2Universit\u00e9 Lille Nord de France\u00adUDL3, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France\n3Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, Boulogne Billancourt, France\nCorresponding Author:\nSophie Berjot, Laboratoire C2S \u00ab Cognition, Sant\u00e9, Socialisation \u00bb, EA\n6291, Universit\u00e9 de Reims Champagne Ardennes, 57 rue Pierre Taittinger,\nEmail: sophie.berjot@univ-reims.fr\nThe Impact of Work Stressors on\nIdentity Threats and Perceived Stress:\nAn Exploration of Sources of Difficulty at\nWork Among French Psychologists\nSophie Berjot1, Emin Altintas2, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lesage1, and\nElisabeth Grebot3\n Keywords\nprofessional identity, personal identity, stress, appraisals\n2 SAGE Open\nalso in terms of identity (see Wiesenfeld, Brockner, Petzall,\nWolf, & Bailey, 2001, for an example in the context of reac-\ntions to layoffs), be it personal (i.e., the self as distinct from\nother people; Hogg, 2003) or social/professional (i.e., the\npart of identity that is associated with group membership).\nDrawing on a recent model of stress and coping with identity\nthreats (Berjot & Gillet, 2011), we therefore sought to find\nout (a) which situations have an impact on identity, (b) how\nthese situations are appraised in terms of threats and/or\nchallenges to personal and or professional identity, and\n(c) whether the impact of these specific situations on per-\nceived stress is mediated by appraisals.\nWork and Identity\nthat, as mentioned earlier, people are often very committed to\ntheir work and/or organization, psychological functions such\nas personal achievement or harmonious social relationships\nwould appear to be especially important nowadays (England\nincreasingly central place in the minds of individuals, who\noften define themselves in terms of their work, their profes-\nsional abilities or their professional relationships (Gini,\n1998), it can be regarded as an important source of identifi-\ncation, helping to define personal and organizational identi-\nIdentification with work often helps people to cope with\njob stress, by allowing them to perceive stressful situations\nas less threatening (Haslam, Jetten, O'Brien, & Jacobs,\n2004) and serving as an important source of social support\nfrom coworkers or from the institution itself (Haslam,\nO'Brien, Jetten, Vormedal, & Penna, 2005). The flip side of\nthis identification is that when work is threatened, as is the\ncase when particularly stressful situations are regularly\nencountered or when the very existence of the job is in\nquestion (i.e., redundancy or quite simply fear of redun-\ndancy; see, for example, Heaney, Israel, & House, 1994;\nSverke, Hellgren, & Naswall, 2002; Wiesenfeld et al.,\n2001), reactions may be particularly negative (Harnisch,\nstress, but they can also have a more general impact on\nidentity (Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993) and self-esteem\n(Winefield, Winefield, Tiggemann, & Goldney, 1991), and\nlead to hospitalization and self-harm (Eliason & Storrie,\nstress disorders (Grebot & Berjot, 2010), and even suicide\nWithout going as far as losing one's job, stressful situa-\ntions or work difficulties that occur on a daily basis can,\nbecause of their recurrence and because of what they mean\nfor identity (questioned, devalued, or scorned), equally rep-\nresent a major source of stress. This is certainly the case of\nextreme situations such as sexual harassment, which not\nonly causes stress but also depression, anxiety, and poor\nself-esteem (see Fitzgerald, 1993, for a review). It is also the\ncase of daily situations that include or imply humiliation,\nthe organization or nature of work (Schabracq, 2003) or,\nmore generally, the fake expression of emotions (Ashforth\nwhile these situations have been shown to lead to dysfunc-\ntional stress reactions because they are appraised as threats\nto the individuals' well-being or because the constraints\nexceed the latter's resources (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), to\nour knowledge, researchers have yet to look at whether\nthese situations have an impact on personal and/or profes-\nsional identity, and how.\nThe Stress and Coping With Identity\nThreat Model\nWhile there are numerous models of stress and coping,\nwhich most of the time offer ecologically valid explana-\ntions as to how people react to different types of threats to\ntheir well-being, such as major events, daily hassles, and,\nmore particularly, threatening situations at work (Dewe\npeople appraise and react to self-threats, that is, threats to\ntheir sense of self, as unique individuals (often referred to\nas personal/individual/private self or personal identity)\nand/or as members of meaningful groups (often referred to\nas group/collective self or social identity; Baumeister,\nTraditional models of stress do not make any distinction\nbetween the tangible aspects of the situation that has to be\ncoped with (e.g., work overload, conflicts) and what that\nsituation means for an individual's personal and/or profes-\nsional identity (e.g., seeing one's competence called into\nquestion, being treated as unprofessional, etc.). The stress\nand coping with identity threat model (Berjot & Gillet, 2011),\ngrounded in the literature on stress and coping with discrimi-\nnation, is based on transactional models of stress, and is spe-\ncific to identity-threatening situations. These situations have\nspecific antecedents, an appraisal phase, specific coping\nstrategies (e.g., self-handicapping, self-affirmation), and dif-\nferent kinds of effects, such as lowered self-esteem and\nstress.\nIt is the primary appraisal phase that is of interest to us\nhere. This is when individuals assess whether, in a specific\nproblematic situation (a) something is potentially detrimental\nto their identity (personal and social) and (b) which part of\nthat identity is threatened (or challenged) by the situation.\nThis appraisal phase is presented in the model as mediating\nthe way these threatened individuals then react (outcome). In\nother words, appraising a situation as relevant to one's iden-\ntity and threatening for one or both aspects of that identity is\na source of stress because of its impact on identity (Ashforth\n2001). For example, a study by Berjot, Girault-Lidvan,\nBerjot et al. 3\nScharnitsky, and Gillet (2010) showed that students of for-\neign origin whose ethnic identity was threatened in a stereo-\ntype threat paradigm (threat of confirming a poor reputation\nby failing on a task; for example, women taking a math test)\njudged the situation to be more stressful than students of\nFrench origin, who were not threatened by the stereotype. In\nanother study, Berjot, Girault-Lidvan, and Gillet (2012)\nshowed that stigmatization linked to being physically dis-\nabled was negatively correlated with the threat to personal\nand social identity. Moreover, these individuals made distinct\nidentity appraisals, depending on whether they faced discrim-\nination, and these appraisals were specifically linked to\noutcomes such as personal and collective self-esteem, and\nidentity management strategies.\nWhen applied in an organizational context, this model can\nhelp researchers to explore the impact of identity appraisal\non adjustment. For example, Lesage, Berjot, Altintas, and\nphysicians, symptoms of burnout, perceived stress, and iden-\ntity appraisals. Results showed that stress and burnout were\nsignificantly and positively linked to threat to personal and\nprofessional identity. Moreover, results showed that threat to\npersonal identity (TPI) explained twice as much feelings of\nlow personal accomplishment than perceived stress and as\nmuch depersonalization than stress.\nFinally, as it will be also our goal here and more in a quali-\ntative way, help to find out (a) which kinds of difficult situa-\ntions are relevant to identity and therefore whether these\nsituations are partly or entirely the same as those that are\nusually identified as sources of stress in the organizational\nliterature, and (b) explore their relation with stress. In the\nlight of the above studies, we set out to ascertain (a) which\nkinds of work difficulties are regarded as identity-threaten-\ning by employees, (b) how those problematic organizational\nsituations are appraised (i.e., in terms of personal vs. profes-\nsional identity threats and/or challenges), and (c) what effects\nthese difficulties have on adjustment (in this case, perceived\nstress, satisfaction with working conditions and the percep-\ntion that one's professional status is threatened by society),\nas mediated by the appraisal process. The first part of the\npresent study was therefore descriptive (the kinds of situa-\ntion that have an impact on identity, how they are appraised,\nand what their impact is on stress), while the second part was\nprocessual. Concerning this second part, and again based on\nthe literature, we predicted that threat appraisals would medi-\nate the relationship between situation and stress.\nMethod\nParticipants and Procedure\nThe present study was run with a specific population, namely\nFrench psychologists, as many studies have shown that psy-\nchologists are particularly stressed and sensitive to syn-\ndromes such as burnout ( Ackerley, Burnell, Hoder, &\nCarlozzi, & Stein, 1999). Given their high qualifications and\nthe human responsibilities they have to bear, psychologists\nare particularly committed to their profession.\nParticipants were 842 psychologists (M\nage\nage\nThey were all actively employed in a number of different\nworked in universities or colleges (1.07%). As for their sta-\ntwo types of contract. On average, they had been working for\n7.60 years, with a minimum of 1 month and a maximum of\n51 years. Participants were approached via French national\nassociations of psychologists1 and the authors' own social\nand professional networks to respond to an online question-\nnaire. The aim of the study, as well as its voluntary and anon-\nymous nature, was set out on the first page of the\nquestionnaire.\nMeasures\nAppraisal of identity threat.First of all, participants were\nasked to \"think about a difficult professional situation (or set\nof similar situations) that you have experienced and which\nparticularly affected you as a person or as a psychologist.\"\nThey were then asked to describe the situation or situations\n(optional), before responding to the 20 items of the Primary\nAppraisal of Identity Threat scale (PAIT; Berjot, Girault-\nLidvan, & Gillet, 2012). This tool is a trait-like scale that\nassesses how people appraise situations in terms of threats\n(or challenges) to their personal and/or social identity. Here,\nthe social identity items were rephrased to fit the psycholo-\ngists' professional identity and participants were told to\nrespond to these items with reference to the situation(s) they\nhad just reported.\nThe PAIT has four subscales. The two Threat subscales\nmeasure the degree to which the individual self (vs. the\nsocial/professional self) is devalued, insulted, or undermined\nin the reported situations (Tajfel & Turner, 1986). The Threat\nto Personal Identity subscale (6 items,  = .84; for example,\n\"I have the feeling that I'm regarded as a nobody\") refers to\nthe individual self, while the Threat to Social Identity sub-\nscale (TSI; 5 items,  = .86; for example, \"I have the feeling\nthat psychologists are insulted\") refers to the social self, in\nthis case, a psychologist.\nThe two Challenge subscales measure the degree of con-\nfidence that, with an effort, the situation's demands can be\novercome. These two subscales therefore focus on the posi-\ntive outcomes that can come from difficult situations. The\n4 SAGE Open\nChallenge to Personal Identity subscale (CPI; 4 items;  =\n.64; for example, \"I focus on the way I can take advantage of\nthe situation\") focuses on the individual self, while the\nChallenge to Social Identity subscale (CSI; 5 items,  = .77;\nfor example, \"I'm pleased to have a chance to show to what\nextent psychologists, including myself, can deal with this\nkind of situation\") focuses on the professional self. As this\nscale was originally developed in the context of identity\nthreats linked to discrimination, we used exploratory facto-\nrial analysis with an oblimin rotation to check its structure.\nThis analysis yielded a four-factor solution (61.14% of vari-\nance). All the items loaded on their respective dimensions\nexcept for two, which loaded on two dimensions. As these\nboth had quite a high loading on their initial dimensions, we\nincluded them in the scores.\nPerceived stress. Stress was assessed with the French version\nof the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS14; Cohen, Kamarck, &\nMermelstein, 1983; translated into French by Bruchon-Sch-\nPSS is a brief self-report scale of 14 items. People are asked\nto rate on a Likert-type 5-point scale ranging from 1 (never)\nto 5 (very often) the extent to which they experienced each of\nthe feelings and thoughts on the list in the course of the pre-\nvious 2 weeks.\nWork satisfaction. This was assessed with a single question:\n\"Are you satisfied with your working conditions?\" Partici-\npants answered on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at\nall) to 7 (totally).\nThreat to occupational status.This was also assessed with a\nsingle question: \"Do you think that psychologists' profes-\nsional status is threatened in France?\" Participants answered\non a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (totally).\nPsychosocial and status characteristics. After responding to the\ndifferent scales, participants were asked several questions\nabout their sex and age, their experience (in years), the type\nof place they worked in, and their type of work contract.\nResults\nSituational Content Analysis\nA total of 568 participants reported at least one difficult situ-\nation before responding to the PAIT (67.22%). The content\nof their reports was analyzed by two of the coauthors, who\ncounted 1,205 occurrences (an occurrence corresponded to\nthe citation of one specific source. Even if the same source\nwas cited more than once, it was still only coded once), that\nis, 2.12 occurrences per respondent. The categorization was\nundertaken jointly by the two coauthors, who shared the cod-\ning out between them after they had coded about 70 partici-\npants together and arrived at a consensus on the definition of\neach category and the criteria for placing an occurrence in a\nparticular category. If a problematic occurrence was encoun-\ntered, it was discussed until a consensus was reached.\nContent analysis highlighted four types of work-related situ-\nations that represented sources of difficulty at work for\nFrench psychologists. These situations are set out in the fol-\nlowing section, starting with those with the most occurrences\n(see Table 1).\nExperience of work. Occurrences in this category concerned\nthe way in which psychologists experienced their work\n(29.96% of all occurrences). Coming top in this category was\na general lack of recognition (34.38% of occurrences in this\ncategory), particularly in the case of psychologists working\nfor private companies (33.33% of them), and hospitals\ncame a sense of being devalued at work, through more or less\nexplicit insults or derogatory remarks about their qualities\nand competence, criticism, scornful comments, and verbal\nattacks (20.63%). This was the case for those working in\nand 14.96% for private and public hospitals, respectively).\nAnother frequently cited subcategory was the feeling of not\nbeing able to find a solution that psychologists can some-\ntimes have when confronted with their clients' problems.\nThis subcategory represented 18.62% of occurrences in this\ncategory and was encountered mostly by those working for\nprivate companies (25% of them) and in public administra-\ntions (24%). The final subcategory concerned the conflicts\nthey encountered over interests, values, and ethics (11.17%).\nPatient relations. Occurrences of this category concerned dif-\nficult relationships with patients/clients and/or their families.\nThey represented 24.82% of total occurrences and predomi-\nnantly concerned instances where the psychologists had been\ntouched or moved by the illness and suffering of their patients\n(68.65% of occurrences in this category), which is perceived\nas a difficult experience. All categories of psychologists fre-\nquently reported these events, ranging from 34.74% of those\nworking in public hospitals to 48% of those working in pub-\nlic administrations. The other subcategories concerned direct\ndifficulties with patients who either did not want to be cured\nWorking conditions. Occurrences of this category represented\n23.73% of all occurrences. They referred to the tangible\nphysical, economic, and social conditions that psychologists\nencounter. Institutional problems and dysfunctions repre-\nsented 25.17% of occurrences in this category. Psychologists\ncomplained of the slowness of the institutions, their peculiar\nand often counterintuitive logic that prevented them from\npracticing correctly, and the difficulties involved in planning\nor implementing projects. This was notably the case for psy-\nchologists working for associations (14.17% of them), public\nBerjot et al. 5\nTable 1.

Finally, economic pressures (pressure to be produc-\noften reported in this category, particularly by psychologists\nworking for companies (20.83% of them reported time pres-\nsure, 12.50% economic pressures). Other occurrences con-\ncerned difficulties such as large workloads (8.74%), lack of\nroles (being asked to do something that is not in one's job\nRelations with colleagues and superiors.This category repre-\nsented 22.16% of all occurrences and concerned problems\nthe participants had with their colleagues (mostly in public\nhospitals), the teams in which they worked (24.34%), or their\nimmediate superiors, who either abused them or were in\ndirect conflict with them (30.34%, mostly in public adminis-\ntrations or associations). Some occurrences concerned a lack\nof teamwork, either because there was no such team or\nbecause the existing team excluded them or did not take\nthem properly into account, which created conflicts (16.10%).\nFinally, some occurrences concerned collective (from col-\nleagues) and/or institutional abuse (12.73%). This included\nverbal and physical abuse, and a total lack of consideration\nfrom patients or families (particularly so in hospitals).\nDescriptive Statistics\nAs we did not know exactly what participants who had not\nreported any events were referring to when they responded to\nthe PAIT, we only computed results for participants who had\nreported at least one event (n = 558). There were no signifi-\ncant differences in variables between those who reported an\nevent and those who did not, except for the CPI subscale,\none event judged the situation(s) to be less challenging to\ntheir identity than those who had not reported any.\nTo link sources of stress with other measures, we com-\nputed several indices. First of all, we summed the sources of\ndifficulties the participants had cited (a) across all categories\n(total number of sources) and (b) within each of the four cat-\negories. Second, we calculated an index representing the\nnumber of categories cited (one, two, three, or four) by each\nparticipant.\nAs can be seen in Table 2, the psychologists appraised the\nsituations they cited as being threatening to their professional\nidentity (CSI: M = 3.43, SD = .87). Their level of satisfaction\nwith their working conditions was just above the theoretical\ntheir professional status as being extremely threatened (M =\nSD = .96) than that observed among French employees in\nAs for events, Table 2 showed that the mean number of\noccurrences in each of the four categories logically repro-\nduced the distribution found in the content analysis. The\nexperience of work's category had the highest mean number\nof occurrences (M = .63, SD =.78), followed by patient rela-\n= .79), and relations with colleagues and superiors (M = .47,\nThe correlational analyses showed that number of sources\nand total number of categories were significantly linked to\nTPI (r = .24 and .17) and, even more so, to threat to\nTable 2. Means, Standard Deviations, and Correlations Between Measures.\nNote. TPI = Threat to Personal Identity; TSI = Threat to Social Identity; CPI = Challenge to Personal Identity; CSI = Challenge to Social Identity.\nBerjot et al. 7\nprofessional identity (r = .34 and .29), indicating that the\nmore participants reported events, the more they appraised\nthem as a threats to their professional identity. These factors\nwere not linked to challenge appraisals. The same pattern\nwas found for each of the four categories, with the exception\nof patient relations, which was negatively correlated with\nTSI (r = -.35) and, to a lesser extent, with TPI (r = -.12),\nindicating that psychologists who encounter these kinds of\nsituations do not regard them as threats to their identity. As\nfor the link between reporting events and other measures,\nresults showed that total number of sources and number of\ncategories were correlated negatively with satisfaction with\nworking conditions (r = -.20 and -.17), and positively with\nstress (r = .16 and .11). Only total number of sources was\ncorrelated with perceived threat to status (r = .13). As for\ntypes of sources, results showed that working conditions was\ncorrelated negatively with work satisfaction (r = -.26) and\npositively with threat to status and perceived stress (r = .18\nand .17). Once again, patient relations was correlated posi-\ntively with work satisfaction (r = .14) and negatively with\nthreat to status (r = -.16). It was not linked to stress. Finally,\nrelations with colleagues and superiors seemed particularly\ndeleterious, as it was correlated negatively with work satis-\nfaction (r = -.34), positively with threat to status (r = .12)\nand perceived stress (r = .46).\nAnalyses showed, however, that threat appraisals were\nsignificantly linked to other measures. Thus, TPI was linked\nto work satisfaction (r = -.34), threat to occupational status\n(r = .12) and perceived stress (r = .34), as was TSI (r = -.34,\n.34, .18). It is worth noting that CPI was correlated positively\nwith threat to status and negatively with stress.\nThreat Appraisals as Mediators Between Sources\nof Difficulties and Perceived Stress\nTo test for multiple mediations, we followed the procedure\ndescribed by Preacher and Hayes, using their macro for\nSPSS 18. This statistical analysis is based on the Baron and\nKenny procedure (1986) for testing for mediators, but makes\nit possible to test for more than one at a time. Given that the\ncorrelational analyses only showed significant relations for\nthreat appraisals, we excluded challenge appraisals from\nthese fresh analyses (expect for the patient relations category,\nwhich was linked to CPI). We ran a multiple regression anal-\nysis for all the independent variables (IVs), with the two\ntypes of threat as simultaneous mediators and perceived\nstress as a dependent variable (DV).\nTotal number of sources.The model was significant for this\nsignificant total effect of number of sources on perceived\nstress (corresponding to the direct link between the IV and\nDV,  = .14, p < .001) and a nonsignificant direct effect (cor-\nresponding to the effect between the IV and DV while the\nmediators were controlled,  = .14, p = .22, ns), showing that\nthe relationship ceased to exist once we had entered the\nmediators. Moreover, the effects of number of sources on the\ntwo mediators (TPI and TSI) were only significant for TPI\n( = .19, p < .001), ruling out TSI as a mediator. Finally, the\nlink between TPI and perceived stress was significant\n( = .48, p < .001), indicating that only TPI mediated the\nrelationship between the sources of difficulties and perceived\nTotal number of categories.

As for the links between the mediators and the DV,\nonly the one between TPI and perceived stress was signifi-\ncant ( = .49, p < .001), again indicating that TPI was the\nonly mediator in the relationship between the number of cat-\negories cited and perceived stress.\nWorking conditions.The model was significant, R2 = .26,\nnumber of sources on stress ( = .16, p < .001) and a signifi-\ncant but smaller direct effect ( = .08, p < .01).

Some con-\ncerned working conditions and interpersonal problems (with\ncolleagues and superiors). Others concerned situations that\nwere more central to identity, such as experience of work and\npatient relations. More specifically, working conditions and\nrelations with colleagues and superiors seemed to threaten the\nprofessional aspect of identity, whereas experience of work\nthreatened both aspects of it. This can be explained by the fact\nthat the latter category concerns the way in which people\nexperience their work, rather than the actual physical and\nmaterial conditions. Accordingly, while working conditions\nor conflicts with colleagues can represent a threat to the pro-\nfessional we think we are, calling us into question because we\ndo not have adequate facilities to practice our profession\nproperly, the denigration or lack of recognition we receive\nfrom others certainly has a deeper impact, calling not just our\nprofessional identity into question but also and above all our\nindividual identity. If stressors such as harassment or violence\nare so harmful, it is precisely because they go beyond our\nprofessional identity and have an impact on ourselves as\nindividuals.\nWe also noticed that the most identity-relevant sources\nwere well represented. Taken together, lack of recognition\nand devaluation represented 55.01% of their category (almost\n16% of total occurrences), while being moved by suffering\nrences). This high frequency may have been due to the speci-\nficities of the sample population, who have daily contacts\nwith patients and/or clients who are suffering or at least need\nhelp. However, the extensive literature on burnout shows\nthat a great many occupations actually involve regular con-\ntacts with people who are suffering, have problems, or who\nare aggressive, unhappy, needy, or protesting (e.g., social\nservices, health care, teaching, and private institutions such\nas banks and call centers; Schaufeli & Buunk, 2003)\nMost of these situations have already been identified and\nare well-known sources of stress. For example, a recent\nmemo from the French Department of Labor (Dares\nAnalyses, 2010) divided psychosocial risks into six catego-\nries: (a) work demands (e.g., workload, time pressure),\n(b) emotional demands (e.g., contact with suffering, need to\nconceal emotions, relations with the public), (c) autonomy\n(e.g., prevented from using skills, lack of autonomy),\n(d) interpersonal relations (e.g., conflicts with colleagues and\nsuperiors, harassment, lack of recognition), (e) conflicting\nvalues, and (f) socioeconomic insecurity. Almost all our\nsources of difficulties figured in this classification, although\nsome of our categories partly overlapped or were not specifi-\ncally identified, doubtless because they were too specific.\nOne of our results did not, however, fit the usual pattern.\nPatient relations were correlated negatively with threat\nappraisals (especially TPI), and positively with CPI and\nwork satisfaction. All the occurrences for this category con-\ncerned problems or, at the very least, things that were identi-\nfied as problematic and/or painful. This pattern may be\nspecific to psychologists or, at any rate, to professionals who\nfrequently come into contact with patients and suffering or,\nas mentioned earlier, who identify closely with their profes-\nsion. Psychologists certainly identify closely with their pro-\nfession, and according to social identity theory and recent\nstudies (Haslam et al., 2005), this may protect them from\nstress. Senter, Morgan, Serna-McDonald, and Bewley\npsychologists' occupational identification and their score on\nthe \"personal accomplishment\" subscale of burnout (correla-\ntion of -.21 between identification and the \"emotional\nexhaustion\" subscale). In a study of 521 counseling psychol-\nogists in private practice, Vredenburgh and colleagues (1999)\nreported a positive relationship between hours of client con-\ntact per week and sense of personal accomplishment (see\nalso Rupert & Morgan, 2005; Rupert, Stevanovic, & Hunley,\n2009, for a similar results). Moreover, for psychologists, this\nidentification with occupation seems to be strongly associ-\nated with several specific and characteristic values, one of\nwhich is empathy (Carlozzi, Bull, Stein, Ray, & Barnes,\n2002), as their definition of empathy is strongly linked to\ntheir identification with specific theories of psychotherapy.\nAccordingly, the more contacts psychologists have with\npatients and the more opportunities they have to exercise\ntheir professional skills, the more they can express their pro-\nfessional identity and feel useful and competent.\nFinally, another aim of this study was to see whether iden-\ntity-relevant situations had an impact on perceived stress and\nthen to explore the processes that explained this relationship.\nThe results of the multiple regression analyses showed that\nthe personal aspect of identity explained the relationship\nbetween most sources of difficulty and perceived stress. In\nother words, if these situations affected stress, it was because\nBerjot et al. 9\nof their impact on this specific aspect of identity. The litera-\nture exploring the effects of identity threats with regard to\ndiscrimination and stigmatization shows that threats to the\npersonal aspect of identity are more painful than threats to\nthe social aspect. For a start, there is a very complex relation-\nship between social identity (and the identification it implies)\nand outcomes (e.g., lowered self-esteem, stress). TSI often\nelicits an increase in group identification, which can then\nserve as a resource for coping with the threat (in the form of\nsocial support or sharing the same faith) and thus lessen its\neffects. Second, the social and personal aspects of identity\nare not independent of each other. Group memberships and\ndifferent identifications are part of who we are. As such, a\nthreat to the social aspect of identity often has an impact on\nits personal aspect, too, especially for highly identified peo-\nple (Branscombe, Schmitt, & Harvey, 1999; Schmitt &\nBranscombe, 2002). In short, a threat to the professional\naspect of identity may well be particularly detrimental to the\npersonal identity of individuals but at the same time be alle-\nviated by this very identification, insofar as it serves as a\nresource for coping with the difficult situation (Haslam et al.,\nTo conclude, there is far too little research in the literature\nbearing on the identity-threatening aspects of particularly\nstressful working situations and the impact on stress (most\nstudies focus on identity as a resource). Surprisingly, the cen-\ntrality of identity is only highlighted in the literature on\nsymptoms (not causes), such as burnout (Schaufeli & Buunk,\nnurse suffering from burnout, the results of her qualitative\ncontent analysis identified three themes, all related to the\nnurse's identity (e.g., her personal experience, ethical prob-\nlems, and feelings of helplessness\u00adexistential issues of suf-\nfering). However, even if extreme symptoms of stress are\noften accompanied by identity problems or effects (e.g., low-\nered self-esteem, depression), all too few studies in the work-\nplace have explicitly explored the link between what is\nidentity-threatening in an environment and its impact on\nhealth. There is much to gain from adopting the stress and\ncoping with identity threat model to explore employees'\nreactions to stressful situations in terms of antecedents and\nconsequences. In particular, because this model draws on\nabundant literature (social identity theory in particular; see\nAshforth & Mael, 1989, for a discussion of its application to\norganizational contexts), it could allow us to make more pre-\ncise predictions about, for example, the strategies that people\nuse to cope with such threats. The literature on identity con-\ntains descriptions of the specific strategies people use to cope\nwith identity threats, such as self-affirmation or self-handi-\ncapping, some being more useful and efficient than others\nDrawing on the literature on organizational stress, the\npresent study extended this area of investigation to situations\nthat can threaten identity and the way in which these threats\ncan affect stress. Moreover, we sought to differentiate\nbetween two aspects of identity that shape our daily working\nactivities, that is, its personal and professional aspects. We\nare conscious that this is the first attempt to directly link\nstressful situations to identity threats and that much more\nresearch is needed to explore how and why specific stressful\nsituations affect identity and stress.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAckerley, G.
