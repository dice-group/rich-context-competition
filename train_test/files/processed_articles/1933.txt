Fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption data\nwere collected using two non-consecutive 24 h recalls. For the purpose of the\nstudy, F&V intakes were aggregated into seven subgroups indicating degree of\nprocessing, which afterwards were used as inputs into cluster analysis.\nResults: Total average F&V intake of the adults was below the recommended\nlevel. Thereby, 20 % of the respondents consumed fruit only in the form of juice.\nThree F&V consumption patterns were identified: `low-intake F&V consumers'\n(74 % of respondents), `consumers of healthier F&V options' (13 %) and `intensive\nfruit juice consumers' (13 %). These groups differed markedly in terms of their\nsociodemographic, lifestyle and health characteristics, such as gender, age, race/\nethnicity, education, smoking, weight status, etc. Differences in nutrient profiles\nwere also found, with the `consumers of healthier F&V options' showing better\nnutritional quality compared with other clusters.\nConclusions: Only a small share of US adults combines high F&V intakes with\nhealthier F&V options that lead to a better nutritional profile. This raises discussion\nabout a need to deliver more specific F&V promotion messages, including advice\non healthier preparation methods, especially for the specific population groups.\n",

A large amount of literature\nhas investigated the fruit and vegetable (F&V) intakes of\npopulations and their correspondence to the existing\nrecommendations(4\u00ad7). Thereby, F&V have most often\nbeen considered as a combined variable or differentiated\nby botanical characteristics, e.g. citrus fruits, berries, dark\ngreen vegetables and legumes. However, there has been\nless focus on the actual F&V consumption patterns, i.e. the\nway F&V are incorporated into diets, which certainly\ncontributes to the overall diet healthiness. Thus, one might\nchoose to eat F&V in their natural low-energy form, as well\nas use cooking techniques such as deep-fat frying, serving\nwith high-fat dressings or sauces or including in high-fat\nmixtures, which greatly increase the energy and fat content\nin the dish and thus reduce the healthiness of the pro-\nduce(8). Canned F&V may contribute to the rise of total\nenergy consumed, when prepared with added sugar and\nheavy syrups, and may also contain added salt. Although\nfruit juice is rich in a number of micronutrients, it loses the\nfibre present in a whole fruit and is often a source of\nadditional energy. Moreover, a whole fruit provides higher\nsatiety than does juice, and may therefore contribute to\nweight management(9). Consequently, a `5-a-day' message\naimed at encouragement of F&V intake might be of little\nsupport to health in the case of insufficient attention to the\nway F&V are incorporated into diets. In this context,\ndefining the F&V intake patterns among the population is\nof special interest. Cluster analysis presents a methodolo-\ngical approach widely used for identification of dietary\npatterns as it groups individuals with similar characteristics\ninto homogeneous, mutually exclusive groups(10\u00ad13).\n*Corresponding author: Email tetyana.demydas@agrar.uni-giessen.de r The Authors 2011\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Specifically, the current study presents: (i) F&V\nclassification with respect to their degree of processing\nand description of intakes from the created subgroups;\n(ii) derivation of F&V consumption patterns; (iii) exploration\nof sociodemographic and behavioural differences across\nclusters; and (iv) comparison of their nutritional profiles.\nMethods\nStudy sample and survey data\nThe US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nyears of age, who were non-pregnant and non-lactating\nand had reliable 2d dietary information and F&V intake\ndata, provided data for the analysis. The final study sample\nadult sample). Details on the design of the NHANES survey\nare given elsewhere(14,15). Briefly, the NHANES is a pro-\ngramme of studies conducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention designed to assess the health and nutritional\nstatus of adults and children in the USA. It is a nationwide\nprobability sample of the population selected via complex\nmultistage probability techniques. Sample weights and\nsample design variables that compensate for different\nprobability of selection, non-response and post-stratification\nshould be used to obtain representative results. F&V con-\nsumption information was collected from each respondent\nby means of two non-consecutive 24h dietary recalls. Total\nnutrient intakes were calculated for each interviewee by\nNCHS and were available in the data set. Data on smoking\nstatus and other behavioural characteristics were obtained\nby standardized questionnaires. Body weight and height\nwere measured by trained specialists.\nFruit and vegetable classification\nabout consumed F&V, including their form (i.e. whole,\njuice), degree of processing (i.e. cooked, canned) and\nadditional ingredients. The intakes of F&V as a part of\ncomposite dishes, e.g. soups, sandwiches, stews and\npizzas, can be accounted for. Data preparation covered\nscreening the reported 2 d F&V intakes and grouping\nthem into subgroups with respect to the degree of\nprocessing using the codes of the Food and Nutrient\nDatabase for Dietary Studies of the US Department of\nAgriculture (USDA)(16). In total, 430 codes for fruit and\n1566 codes for vegetable groups including legumes were\navailable. Table 1 presents the description of the created\nsubgroups. In the present study, fruits refer to whole fruit\neaten in all forms and 100 % fruit juice. The following\nfruit subgroups were created: raw, juice and canned/\nfrozen/dried/desserts. More detailed subdivision was\nnot feasible because of: (i) the initial food coding in the\ndata set (i.e. no consistent distinction between canned,\ncooked and frozen produce); and (ii) a very small num-\nber of persons who reported consumption of dried fruits\nand fruit desserts. The vegetable group consists of dark-\ngreen, deep-yellow produce, tomatoes, other vegetables,\nlegumes, potatoes (including fried potatoes but exclud-\ning potato chips) and other starchy vegetables in all\npreparation forms. Inclusion of legumes and potatoes\nwith other starchy tubers into the group of vegetables\nvaries among studies(17). Owing to the fact that these\nfoods constitute a part of the Food Guide Pyramid\nrecommendations about vegetable consumption(18), they\nwere classified into the vegetable category. The following\nsubgroups were created: raw vegetables, consumed\nwith and without dressings; cooked vegetables, served\nwithout dressings, creams and non-vegetable items;\nvegetables in mixed dishes, including those served with\ncreams, dressings and non-vegetable items; and fried\nvegetables.\nTable 1 Classification of F&V by degree of processing\nGroups Examples of foods in subgroup classification*\nFruit\nRaw Orange; papaya; plum; fruit salad without dressing\nJuice Apple juice, fresh; lemon juice, bottled; tangerine juice, canned\nCanned/frozen/dried/\ndesserts\nGrapefruit, canned or frozen, in light syrup; apricot, cooked or canned, in heavy syrup; cherry pie filling;\nmango, pickled; blackberries, frozen; banana chips; pear, dried, cooked with sugar; lime souffle\n\u00b4; fruit salad\nwith salad dressing or mayonnaise\nVegetables\nRaw Broccoli, raw; spinach salad, no dressing; cucumber salad with creamy dressing; artichoke salad in oil\nCooked Beet greens, cooked, fat not added in cooking; tomatoes, from fresh produce, broiled; mushrooms, stuffed;\nwhite potato, baked, peel not eaten; green plantains, boiled\nIn mixed dishes Vegetable combinations, cooked, with pasta; carrots, tomato beef rice soup, prepared with water; potato from\nPuerto Rican beef stew, with gravy; corn, cooked, from fresh produce, with cream sauce, made with milk;\nbean and rice soup\nFried Potato pancake; aubergine, batter dipped, fried; white potato, french fries, from frozen produce, deep fried\nF&V, fruit and vegetables.\n*The list of foods is taken from Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies and is not exhaustive of each subgroup.\nFruit and vegetable by degree of processing 1089\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

This approach allows the analysis\nof nutritional adequacy of an individual within the\nenergy needs. The INQ is defined as the ratio of nutrient\ndensity to the amount of this nutrient recommended for\nthe maintenance of good health within a given energy\nrequirement(21,22). The actual densities of the selected\nnutrients were calculated on the basis of the person's 2 d\nthe recommendations of the USDA Food Guide(23) served\nas a reference. Therefore,\nINQ \u00bc nutrient density=recommendations of USDA\nINQ was calculated separately for each of the selected\nkey nutrients related to F&V intake (i.e. dietary fibre, K,\nCa, Mg, vitamins C and A) and to undesirable health\nfactors (i.e. total fat, total SFA, total sugar, Na, choles-\nterol). INQ values .1?0 may be seen as desirable for\nfibre, K, Ca, Mg and vitamins C and A, and as undesirable\nfor fats, sugar, Na and cholesterol.\nStatistical methods\nStatistical analyses were performed using the Statistical\nPackage for the Social Sciences statistical software pack-\nage version 17?0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To identify\ngroups of subjects with similar F&V eating patterns, a two-\nstage clustering procedure, advocated in the literature\nbecause of higher validity of cluster solution, was\napplied(24). The 2 d average intakes of the created F&V\nsubgroups were used as continuous inputs. Hierarchical\ncluster analysis with squared Euclidean distance was\nrun to determine the number of clusters and was followed\nby K-means clustering. An optimal number of clusters\nwas decided on the basis of inspection of the change\nin agglomeration coefficients. Because all variables were\nmeasured at the same scale, they were not standardized\nbefore the analysis. Reliability of the cluster solution was\nchecked by performing the procedure multiple times,\nchanging algorithms and methods, as well as by splitting\nthe sample into halves and analysing each one indepen-\ndently(25). The stability of the cluster solution was tested\nthrough discriminant analysis. Distribution differences in\nsociodemographics, lifestyles and health status associated\nwith the derived groups were examined with the x2 test.\nANOVA with least significant difference test for multiple\ncomparisons was applied to assess mean differences\namong clusters by F&V intakes. All P values were two-\nsided (P , 0?05). Except clustering, all statistical analyses\nwere performed on the weighted sample(10). Means and\nstandard errors were estimated in an SPSS 17?0 Complex\nSamples module that allowed the use of sampling weights\nand sample design variables and, thus, the production of\nrepresentative estimates for the selected group of the\ncivilian, non-institutionalized US population.\nResults\nFruit and vegetable consumption in the\nwhole sample\nTotal daily average F&V intake of adults amounts to\nafter excluding juice (Table 2), which is below the\nWHO recommended minimum of 400 g F&V/d excluding\nTable 2 Intakes (g) of F&V by degree of processing across the clusters of adults from NHANES 2005\u00ad2006*\nLow-intake F&V\nConsumers of healthier\nIntensive fruit juice\nGroups Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE P value- Mean SE\nFruit\nCanned/frozen/dried/\ndesserts\nVegetables\nTotal F&V, excluding\nfruit juice\nF&V density\n-\nF&V, fruit and vegetables; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\na,b,cMean values within a row with unlike superscript letters were significantly different (P , 0?05, least significant difference test).\n*Data are weighted to be representative of the population.

Fruit juice and raw\nfruits were the main contributors to the fruit group, with\nvegetable group, adults reported on average the highest\nintakes of cooked (105 g) and raw vegetables (91 g).\nFruits in the `canned/frozen/dried/desserts' form, as\nwell as vegetables in mixed dishes and fried, were less\nimportant in terms of absolute amounts. Furthermore, as\nshown in the Appendix (Fig. A1), 20 % of the interviewees\nincorporated fruit into their diets only in the form of juice\non both recall days. About 81 % of the adults consumed\nvegetables in more than one predefined form.\nCluster solutions for fruit and vegetable\nintake patterns\nThree consumption patterns were identified as the most\nadequate representation of the combinations of F&V\nsubgroups in the diet of adults. Further splitting of the\nclusters led to a smaller heterogeneity among them and\ndid not result in additional information about the intake\npatterns. The discriminant function analysis performed\non the derived clusters also indicated a good stability\nof the chosen three-cluster solution. The percentage of\ncorrect classifications, i.e. the `hit ratio', was 93?0 %.\nAll input variables (i.e. created F&V subgroups), except\nfruit as `canned/frozen/dried/desserts' and vegetables in\nmixed dishes, contributed significantly to the formation of\nclusters. Tables 2 and 3 present data for the three clusters\non F&V intakes, as well as on sociodemographic and\nbehavioural characteristics.\nThe first segment represents the largest group of 1802\npersons (74 % of adults). They are characterized by low\nintakes from all the F&V subgroups with a total average\nintake of 255 g/d. Therefore, the cluster may be described\nas `low-intake F&V consumers'. A large share of these\nindividuals reported to have a lower education, to smoke\nand to eat out often/very often. Only one quarter of them\nevaluated their own diet as excellent/very good.

In comparison with the other\ngroups, females, older respondents, married persons and\nindividuals with higher education and household income\nconstituted a large share of the segment. Over a half of\nthe group (53 %) judged their own diet as excellent/very\ngood. Moreover, the share of overweight/obese adults\nThe third cluster is a group of 319 persons (13 % of\nadults) whose F&V consumption is characterized by a\nhigh share of fruit juice. Although their total F&V intake\nwas over 700 g/d, exclusion of fruit juice from this cal-\nculation reduced the amount to only 284 g. The cluster\nwas named `intensive fruit juice consumers'. Compared\nwith other segments, males, younger interviewees, non-\nHispanic blacks and persons with lower household\nincome were highly represented here. Overweight/obese\nindividuals constituted 64?2 % of the cluster.\nNutrient profiles of the clusters\nFigure 1 gives an overview of the nutritional adequacy\namong adults overall and across the clusters measured\nby INQ of eleven key nutrients. All three clusters with\ndistinct F&V intake patterns showed a low nutritional\nquality with respect to the USDA Food Guide recom-\nmendations(23). Overconsumption of undesirable nutri-\nents (e.g. fats, Na) and insufficient consumption levels of\ndesirable nutrients (e.g. fibre, Ca, vitamins A and C) are\nclearly prevailing. However, in the cluster `low-intake\nF&V consumers', a greater share of the individuals\nseemed to have a worse nutritional profile in comparison\nwith the other segments. A very small proportion of these\npersons complied with the recommendations for the\nconsidered nutrients. Although the pattern `consumers of\nhealthier F&V options' was associated with a higher\nintake of healthy nutrients, the proportion of individuals\nwith adequate densities of fats, Na and cholesterol was\nalso low in this cluster. Compared with the other groups,\na higher share of the `intensive fruit juice consumers'\ncould reach the recommendation on vitamin C. However,\nthey had a lower adequacy in terms of sugar intake.\nDiscussion\nThe present study explored F&V consumption patterns\namong adults in the USA with a special focus on the\npreparation method of the consumed produce. The basic\nmotivation behind the study was that such healthy foods\nas F&V might not be consumed in a healthy way, but\nrather by using preparation techniques and additional\ningredients that significantly reduce their dietary and\nhealth benefits. Therefore, it is of interest for public health\npolicy to monitor such trends and to determine groups\nof individuals who might be targeted with more specific\nnutritional advice.\nAccording to the results, US adults do not consume\nsufficient quantities of F&V, which is in line with pre-\nvious research(7,26,27). Among the F&V preparation forms\nexplored in the study, fruit juice, raw fruits as well as\nvegetables cooked and eaten without dressings and in a\nraw form had the highest shares in the total average\nintake. Consumption of F&V in other forms, e.g. fruit\nas `canned/frozen/dried/desserts', vegetables in mixed\ndishes and fried, was lower. Notably, about 20 % of the\nrespondents reported consumption of fruit only in the\nform of juice. Such importance of fruit juice has been\nshown by other studies. According to the results from\ncontributor to overall fruit intake in the USA(26). Putnam\net al.(28) also indicated a low variety in the fruit intake\nof Americans and showed that orange and apple juice,\nout of over sixty fruit products from food supply data,\nof our study suggest that high fruit juice consumption\ncan be attributed to a particular group of adults named\nin the study as `intensive fruit juice consumers' (13 % of\nadults). Especially younger individuals, predominantly\nmales, non-Hispanic blacks and persons with lower\nhousehold income tend to show this consumption pat-\ntern. While evaluating the impact of juice intake on diet\nand health, several aspects should be considered. First, it\nis important to bear in mind and to remind consumers\nCholesterol\nNa\nTotal sugar\nSaturated fat\nTotal fat\nK\nMg\nCa\nVitamin C\nVitamin A\nFibre\nPercentage of adults Percentage of adults\nFig. 1 Percentage of adults with adequate nutrient intakes ( , low-intake F&V consumers, n 1802; , consumers of healthier F&V\noptions, n 323; , intensive fruit juice consumers, n 319; , all adults, n 2444).

The US Dietary Guidelines\nAdvisory Committee emphasizes that no more than one\nof the three recommended fruit servings should come\nfrom fruit juice and the rest from whole fruit(29). Second,\nthe driving forces of a high juice intake need deeper\ninvestigation. Among others, the convenience aspect\nmight play a determinative role in this decision. Con-\nsumers might also perceive juice as an extremely healthy\nand important component of their diet, and therefore\n`the more, the better' rule is applied. They might also\nbelieve to be able to fulfil the F&V recommendations\nsolely with juice. In this respect, clearer F&V promo-\ntional messages including a special notion on fruit juice\ncould be beneficial.\nThe study also showed that the `low-intake F&V con-\nsumers' pattern constitutes a prevailing share of the adult\npopulation in the USA (74 % of adults). This group had\nlow intakes of all F&V subgroups, especially of raw\nproduce. Characteristics of the low-intake consumers\n(e.g. lower education, non-Hispanic black race, unhealthy\nlifestyles) are consistent with the results of previous\nheterogeneity of F&V consumption patterns in France by\ndisaggregating intakes into subgroups by preparation\nmethod, found that households with the lowest income\nand lower education level of the reference member\ntended to have the lowest total F&V intakes and,\nfurthermore, to consume less of raw F&V and more of\ncanned and frozen fruits as well as to spend a higher\nbudget share for vegetable-based convenience food.\nHowever, the segment comprised predominantly of more\naffluent consumers and those with higher education level\nwas positively associated with consumption of fresh\nF&V. In our study, adults with similar characteristics\n(e.g. higher education and income level, being older and\nmarried) formed the pattern `consumers of healthier F&V\noptions' (13 % of adults). Compared with other clusters, a\nsmaller share of these individuals was overweight or\nobese. Although the relationship between F&V intake\nand obesity has been a focus of research, the results of\ninvestigations are contradictory(8,9,34). Lin and Mentzer\nMorrison(8) found a negative association between fruit\nconsumption and BMI, but no strong association with\nrespect to vegetables. They stated that the key to these\nassociations might be the way in which people tend to\nconsume the produce. Investigation of the links between\nF&V intake and body weight should further explore\nthis issue.\nDifferences detected in the nutritional profiles of the\nsegments can be partly attributed to amounts, as well as\nto preparation methods of F&V. Associations between\nlow F&V consumption and inadequate intakes of micro-\nnutrients and fats found in the study are in line with\nprevious research(35). `Intensive fruit juice consumers'\ncould not meet the recommendations either, with the\nexception of a considerably higher adequacy of vitamin C\nintake. The pattern `consumers of healthier F&V options',\nrich in low-energy-dense options (e.g. raw produce, F&V\ncooked and served without dressings), was associated\nwith higher densities of healthy nutrients. However, the\nshare of individuals with adequate intakes of unhealthy\nnutrients was still very low in this cluster. An explanation\ncould be that F&V are not eaten as substitutes for higher\nenergy foods. However, the present study did not look at\nthis aspect closely and there is a potential for further\nresearch. Moreover, a combination of a higher F&V intake\nwith reduction of energy density in the diet is discussed in\nthe literature with respect to its importance for weight\nmanagement(4).\nIn interpreting our results, several methodological\nissues must be taken into account. First, since only 2 d\ndietary data were available, the question about the relia-\nbility of the characterization of the individual's usual\nintake may arise because of day-to-day variations in\nconsumption. Another aspect is application of cluster\nanalysis. Although it has an exploratory nature, this\nmethod has been widely applied for identification of\npopulation subgroups with distinct dietary patterns. In\nthe present study, we additionally used discriminant\nanalysis to confirm the stability of the chosen solution.\nThe study also has a number of strengths. First, the\nsample was population based, which allows inferences\nfor the adult non-institutionalized population of the\nUSA. An important advantage of the used data set is\nthat it reflects F&V intakes from composite dishes (e.g.\nsoup, pizza, sandwich). Omission of this information is\nconsidered to be a common problem leading to under-\nreporting and bias in the studies on F&V intake(36).\nOverall, the study contributes to the investigation of\nF&V consumption in the USA by taking into consideration\nnot only amounts but also the preparation forms of the\nconsumed produce.\nIn conclusion, our results show that different patterns\nof F&V consumption exist among US adults, which\ncontribute to the differences in their nutrient profiles. The\nstudy suggests a need to monitor the current consump-\ntion trends and especially the related disparities across\nage, ethnic and educational groups. The delivery of more\nspecific F&V promotion messages, including the focus\non F&V options of a higher nutritional value, healthier\npreparation methods and explicit substitution message,\nmight be considered.\n"
