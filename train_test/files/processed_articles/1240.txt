Since the time of those data, there\nhave been trends in other factors in the population that could\npotentially affect vitamin D status. For example, the prevalence\nof overweight increased in the US population in the past decade\n(3, 4). Body fat is inversely related to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin\nD [25(OH)D] (5), but it is not known whether the increase in the\nprevalence of overweight has been accompanied by a decline in\nvitamin D status. A clear understanding of changes in the vitamin\nD status of the US population and of factors that may have\ncontributed to these changes is relevant in light of the consider-\nable efforts currently underway to better define the role of this\nimportant vitamin in health (6\u00ad9).\nSerum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured in the Na-\ntional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for\nbeen part of the current continuous NHANES process since\n2000. These data provide the opportunity to compare vitamin D\nstatus in representative samples of the noninstitutionalized US\npopulation who were assessed at 2 different time-points. The\nobjectives of the present study are 1) to describe current\n25(OH)D concentrations in a wide range of population sub-\ngroups, including children aged 1\u00ad11 y and pregnant women, for\nwhom national estimates have not previously been available and\n2) to compare differences in serum 25(OH)D between NHANES\nassay method changes. We also performed exploratory analyses\nto compare the relative contributions of confounding from assay\nmethod with the combined effects of biological and behavioral\nfactors (eg, body mass index, sun protection, and milk consump-\ntion) that may have contributed to observed differences over\ntime.Thisevaluationwaslimitedtoasinglepopulationsubgroup\nfor which data on these factors were available. Identifying the\ncontribution of confounding factors is essential to avoiding er-\nroneous conclusions about observed changes in the population's\nvitamin D status, because changes in confounding factors are\nunrelated to changes in vitamin D status over time.

In both surveys,\nnon-Hispanic whites were significantly more likely to have been\nexamined in April\u00adOctober and to be living at higher latitudes\nthan were either non-Hispanic blacks or Mexican Americans (P\n 0.05). Furthermore, the racial-ethnic composition of the US\npopulation has changed since the 1990s because of an increase in\nthe Hispanic population (12), which may explain why race-\nethnicity differed significantly between surveys for the sample\nexamined in November\u00adMarch (See Table S1 under \"Supple-\nmental data\" in the current online issue).

BMI was calculated. Body weight was measured\nby using an electronic load cell scale, and standing height was\nmeasured with a fixed stadiometer (10, 11). Latitude and season\nwere based on the geographical location and the month of blood\nspecimen collection. Dietary calcium intake from food was\nbased on a single 24-h recall. Milk intake was based on self-\nreported frequency of consumption in the past month. The ques-\ntions on milk intake differed slightly between the 2 surveys. In\nclude milk used in cooking in their responses, whereas NHANES\nIII respondents did not receive that instruction. In addition, milk\nconsumption was coded as times consumed per month in\nNHANES III. To be comparable with milk consumption in\ncoded as \"never or rarely\" (0\u00ad3 times/mo) or \"sometimes or\noften\" (4 times/mo). Type of milk was based on the fat content\n(ie, whole, 2%, 1%, or skim or nonfat milk) of the milk that was\nself-reported as usually consumed. VMS use was based on self-\nreported use of any type of supplement in the past month.

In both surveys, respondents were asked whether\nthey practiced the following behaviors if they were outside for\n1 h on a sunny day: stay in the shade, wear protective clothing\n(eg, long sleeves or hat with brim), or use sunscreen. Response\ncategories differed between the surveys, and thus responses to\nthe 1992 NHIS by combining \"always\" and \"most of the time\" to\nrepresent \"very likely,\" using \"sometimes\" to represent \"some-\nwhat likely,\" and combining \"rarely\" and \"never\" to represent\n\"unlikely.\" Respondents who reported not going out into the sun\nwasnocomparableresponsecategoryinthe1992NHIS.Asingle\nsun-protection variable was created by assigning the highest\nfrequency reported for any of the 3 behaviors. For example, a\nrespondent who reported being \"very likely\" to stay in the shade\nwas coded as \"very likely\" to practice sun protection overall,\neven if he or she did not report wearing protective clothing or\nusing sunscreen.\nData analyses\nSample weights were used in calculations of point estimates in\nall analyses. Analyses were performed by using SUDAAN soft-\nware [version 9.01; Research Triangle Institute, Research Tri-\nangle Park, NC (15)]. Data collected in the contiguous United\nStates (25\u00ad47 \u00b0N) from both surveys were included in the anal-\nyses. The distribution of race-ethnicity by season of blood col-\nlection was compared between NHANES III and NHANES\ncentiles, and prevalence with serum 25(OH)D below selected\nand race-ethnicity. Adjusted means by selected characteristics\n(ie, age, sex, race-ethnicity, season of blood collection, and, for\nwomen of child-bearing age, pregnancy status) also were calcu-\nsion. The mean for each characteristic was adjusted for all of the\nothercharacteristicsinthemodel.Whenmultiplecomparisonsof\nmeans between groups were made, a Bonferroni correction was\nused.\nChanges in serum 25(OH)D in the population aged 12 y\nined by calculating age-standardized means by sex and season of\nblood collection for each survey period for the total population\nand by race-ethnicity when possible. Data were limited to sub-\njects aged 12 y because serum 25(OH)D was not measured in\nyounger persons in NHANES III. Means were calculated sepa-\nrately by season and sex to avoid confounding due to differences\nin the racial-ethnic composition of the sample by season between\nsurveys, and because an interaction was also found between sex\nand survey. Means were age-standardized to 2000 US Cen-\nsus population estimates. Regression models that included\nNHANES survey and age were used to test the significance of\nobserved differences. These models were run separately by sex,\nseason, and race-ethnicity. When multiple comparisons were\nmade, a Bonferroni correction was used. Because the proportion\nof nonwhites in the sample examined in November\u00adMarch dif-\nfered significantly between surveys, the sample used in the com-\nparison for this season was limited to non-Hispanic whites.\nAge-adjusted means of the serum 25(OH)D concentrations\nwere compared between NHANES III and NHANES 2000\u00ad\n2004 before and after adjustment for assay differences detected\nin the comparison study (See Appendix S1 under \"Supplemental\ndata\" in the current online issue).

In specific, to avoid\nconfounding due to differences in the racial-ethnic composition\nof the sample by season between surveys, the analyses were\nlimited to a subsample of non-Hispanic whites who were exam-\nined in April\u00adOctober. We chose April\u00adOctober because the\nobserved difference in serum 25(OH)D between surveys was\ngreater for the sample examined during that season than for the\nsample examined during November\u00adMarch. We limited the\ncomparison to non-Hispanic whites because the sample size for\nApril\u00adOctober was greatest for this racial-ethnic group. Data\nsun protection data were available only for these survey years.\nThe analyses were focused on persons aged 20\u00ad59 y because the\nfor that age group. Data were analyzed separately by sex because\nof the previously noted sex  survey interaction. The mean age\nof this subsample differed between surveys (x\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nCensus. For this subsample, a 2-step modeling approach was\nsequentially used: step 1) regression to predict mean serum\n25(OH)D concentrations after adjustment for the confounding\neffect of assay differences (NHANES III only) and step 2) re-\ngression to predict mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations after\nadjustment for changes in biological and behavioral factors\nThe first step in the analyses of potential explanatory factors\nwas to assess the contribution of assay differences. This was\naccomplished by calculating predicted mean age-standardized\nadults aged 20\u00ad59 y from NHANES III on the assumption that\nthe current assay had been used. The predicted mean was calcu-\nlated by applying the previously described regression equation\nfrom the assay comparison study to the serum 25(OH)D data for\nthis NHANES III subsample.\nThe second step was to assess the potential contribution of\nchangesinvitaminD\u00adrelatedbiologicalandbehavioralfactorsin\nthis population subgroup between surveys.

After\nadjustment for sex, race-ethnicity, and season, mean serum\n25(OH)D concentrations differed significantly by age: they were\nhighest in children aged 1\u00ad5 y and then significantly lower in\neach succeeding age category. The adjusted mean serum\n25(OH)D concentration was significantly higher in males than in\nfemales and in those whose blood was drawn in April\u00adOctober\nthan in those whose blood was drawn in November\u00adMarch.

Binkley et al (16) found that\ndifferences in mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations between\ndifferent assay types could be as much as 2-fold when the same\nset of blood samples were measured. Variations in results ob-\ntained by using the same method in different laboratories also\nwere described (17). The results of the present study suggest that\nchanges of 12% in the same assay over time can also affect\nserum 25(OH)D concentrations, even when the assays are per-\nformed in the same laboratory. Standard reference materials for\nserum 25(OH)D are currently being developed by the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (18), and the use of those\nstandard reference materials should improve agreement between\nassay methods. It is important to note that the assay adjustment\nused in the present study was based on the current version of the\nRIA, because the NHANES III\u00adera RIA version could not be\nreconstructed. However, without a standard reference material\nfor serum 25(OH)D, it is not clear which assay version is the best\nin terms of assessing nutritional status.\nIn addition to examining trends in serum 25(OH)D, we eval-\nuated mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the current\nNHANES by selected demographic characteristics. These data\nfill an important gap for some groups in whom data have previ-\nously been scanty--in particular, children, adolescents, and\npregnant women (19, 20). In the present study, mean serum\n25(OH)D concentrations were highest in children aged 1\u00ad5 y,\nintermediate in children aged 6\u00ad11 y, and lowest in adolescents\naged 12\u00ad19 y.

Recent community-based studies of vitamin D status in\npregnant women in the United States have reported that low\nvitamin D status is common in this group, but those studies did\nnot include comparisons with nonpregnant women (20, 22).\nIt is important to note that statistical adjustments to serum\n25(OH)D data for assay differences or biological and behavior\nfactors that changed between NHANES III and NHANES 2000\u00ad\n2004 were made in the present study only. The publicly released\n2004 that are available on the NHANES website (Internet: www.\ncdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm) are the observed, unadjusted values.\nWe recommend that researchers who use the publicly released\ndata to make comparisons between surveys should consider the\nconfounding effects of assay differences and changes in popu-\nlation demographics in their analyses.\nThepresentstudyhadlimitations.Theanalysestocomparethe\ncontribution of confounding factors with changes in vitamin\nD\u00adrelatedbiologicalandbehavioralriskfactorsinthepopulation\nwere limited to adults aged 20\u00ad59 y because of a lack of sun-\nprotection data in other age groups. These analyses were further\nlimited to non-Hispanic whites to avoid confounding due to\ndifferences in the racial-ethnic composition of the sample by\nseason between surveys.

For example, because direct\nestimates of dietary vitamin D intake from food are not available\nFIGURE 2.

Nonresponse bias in\nNHANES is reduced by a nonresponse adjustment factor in-\ncluded in the calculation of the sample weights. However, 5\u00ad\n10% of those who came to the mobile exam centers did not have\nserum 25(OH)D data in the 2 surveys, and this nonresponse is not\naddressed by the sample weight adjustments. Finally, some im-\nportant at-risk groups, such as institutionalized persons and per-\nsons living in the northern United States during the winter, were\nnot included in the NHANES sampling frame by design.\nIn summary, age-standardized mean serum 25(OH)D concen-\ntrations based on observed values were significantly lower in\nment for assay changes noticeably reduced the difference be-\ntween surveys. However, mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations\nremained significantly lower in males (except Mexican Ameri-\nadjustment for assay differences. This remaining difference\nlikely represents a real decline in vitamin D status. Changes in\nBMI, milk intake, and sun protection appeared to contribute to\nthis decline in a subgroup of non-Hispanic white adults.
