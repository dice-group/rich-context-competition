It is axiomatic that microglia-mediated (M1 proinflammatory)\nresponse causes central nervous system inflammation; however, the mechanisms by which helminth parasites modulate\nmicroglia activation remain poorly understood. Here, we show that microglia display a diminished expression of\nM1-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nitric oxide synthase 2\n(NOS2) in murine neurocysticercosis. Microglia also exhibited a lack of myeloid cell maturation marker major histocom-\npatibility complex (MHC)-II in these parasite-infected brains. Treatment of microglia with helminth soluble/secreted factors\n(HSFs) in vitro did not induce expression of M1-inflammatory signature molecule NOS2 as well as MHC-II in primary\nmicroglia. However, HSF treatment completely inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in expression of MHC-II,\nNOS2 and nitric oxide production in these cells. As epigenetic modulation of chromatin states that regulates recruitment\nof RNA polymerase II (Pol-II) is a key regulatory step in determining gene expression and functional outcome, we next\nevaluated whether HSF induced modulation of these phenomenon in microglia in vitro. Indeed, HSF downregulated Pol-II\nrecruitment to the promoter region of TNF-a, IL-6, NOS2, MHC-II, and transcription factor CIITA (a regulator of MHC-II\nexpression), by itself. Moreover, HSF suppressed the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in Pol-II recruitment as well. In\naddition, HSF exposure reduced the positive histone marks H3K4Me3 and H3K9/14Ac at the promoter of TNF-a, IL-6,\nNOS2, MHC-II, and CIITA. These studies provide a novel mechanistic insight into helminth-mediated immune suppression in\nmicroglia via modulation of epigenetic processes.\n",

Interestingly, NCC is typically asso-\nciated with a long initial asymptomatic phase lasting sev-\neral years before the onset of symptomatic phase (White\nasymptomatic phase is correlated with a lack of detect-\nable inflammation in the CNS, presumably due to the\nability of the cysticerci to induce immune suppression\nIndeed, in NCC patient brains, a lack of surface expres-\nsion of activation/maturation marker major histocom-\npatibility complex (MHC)-II in macrophages has been\ndocumented in areas around the larvae (Alvarez et al.,\n2008). Thus, parasite-derived molecules likely play an\nimportant role in suppression of inflammation in the\nCNS helminth infection. Understanding these immune\nsuppressive mechanisms may help develop new ways of\ntherapeutically regulating CNS inflammation in NCC\nand other pathological condition.\nInflammation in the CNS in response to diverse stimu-\nlus, for example, infection, injury, or trauma, is mainly\nregulated by the innate immune response (Ramesh et al.,\ntypes, microglia serve as the primary innate immune cell\nproviding first line of response (Rivest, 2009; Cherry et al.,\n2014). When activated, microglia express a number of\ngenes and development of inflammatory responses,\ndepending on the nature, intensity, and duration of the\ninsult. The functional phenotypes of microglia vary in\nresponse to external stimuli these cells receive through a\nwide variety of surface receptors. Microglia displaying the\nclassical activation phenotype (M1) release multiple\nproinflammatory cytokines and generally promote the\ndestruction of pathogens, but also cause widespread\nbystander tissue damage as a result of their overactivation\n(Kobayashi et al., 2013). However, the mechanisms\nunderlying helminth-induced suppression of M1-inflam-\nmatory signature in microglia are not clearly understood.\nMicrobial products (e.g., lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) or\nendogenous inflammatory stimuli (e.g., interferon\ngamma) activate myeloid innate immune cells types,\nsuch as microglia and macrophages, to produce M1-\ninflammatory mediators (e.g., antimicrobial peptides,\nreactive nitrogen and oxygen species, chemokines and\ncytokines; Mosser and Edwards, 2008; Gordon and\nsuch stimuli by surface receptors leads to activation of\ndownstream NF-kB (Nuclear Factor Kappa B), MAPK\n(Mitogen-activated protein kinase), and JAK-STAT\n(Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of tran-\nscription) signaling pathways (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010)\nthat have been found to integrate into a coherent pattern\nof changes in epigenetic landscape and subsequent gene\ntranscription (Natoli et al., 2011). Indeed, genome-wide\nanalyses have clearly shown that epigenetic chromatin\nmarks are dynamically regulated in response to diverse\nstimuli (Zhou et al., 2011). The expression of genes are\nassociated with functionally distinct polarizing class of\nhistone marks (Ernst et al., 2011), for example, positive\nwith actively transcribed genes, whereas H3K27me3 are\nassociated with gene repression (Medzhitov and Horng,\nving chromatin marks regulate accessibility around the\npromoter region and facilitate RNA polymerase (Pol) II\nrecruitment to the promoter (Adelman et al., 2009). The\ncascade of events that follows ultimately leads to Pol-II\nelongation and productive RNA synthesis (Adelman\net al., 2009). In toto, epigenetic events involving chroma-\ntin marks contribute to Pol-II recruitment to the gene\npromoter, and Pol-II-dependent transcription elongation\nis important for gene transcription (Rogatsky and\nAdelman, 2014). An important question, therefore, is\nwhether helminths induce modulation of epigenetic mech-\nanisms involving chromatin marks, Pol-II recruitment,\nand elongation that are involved in the inhibition of\ninflammatory responses in microglia. This is an under-\nstudied area of research.\nIn the present study, using a murine model for NCC\ndeveloped by i.c. infection of mice with Mesocestoides\ncorti (M. corti) metacestodes (Mishra et al., 2008,\nGundra et al., 2011), the maturation and activation\nphenotype of microglia was determined by the expression\nof MHC-II, CIITA, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\na), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nitric oxide synthase 2\n(NOS2) in parasite-infected brains. To determine whether\nepigenetic events of microglia activation and maturation\nare affected by the parasite, we tested the effect of hel-\nminth soluble/secreted factors (HSFs) on expression of\nPol-II recruitment to promoter of immune molecules by\nChromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis.\nMoreover, effect of HSF (Sun et al., 2014) on toll-like\nreceptor (TLR)-induced upregulation of H3K4me3 and\nH3K9/14Ac expression, and increased Pol-II recruitment\nat the promoter of these immune mediators was analyzed.\nOur results presented here show that the regulation of\nepigenetic pathways by helminth molecules is likely a\nnovel immune suppressive mechanism to block micro-\nglia-associated M1-inflammatory response in NCC.\nMethods\nAnimals and Antigens\nMaintenance of the animals and tissue collection for all\nstudies presented here were conducted under the guide-\nlines of the University of North Dakota's IACUC, the\n2 ASN Neuro\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National\nInstitutes of Health. Female BALB/c and C57BL/6\nmice used in this study were bred and maintained in the\nanimal facility at the University of North Dakota SMHS,\nGrand Forks, ND. M. corti metacestodes were propa-\ngated in the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice by serial\nintraperitoneal (i.p.) infection. HSF consisting of M. corti\nsoluble/secreted factors was prepared from M. corti meta-\ncestodes by freezing and thawing as described previously\nAntibodies\nThe following antibodies were used to analyze microglia\n(anti-MHC-II), as well as purified anti-mouse TNF-a,\nIL-6, and NOS2 (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). For\nimmunofluorescence (IF) staining, fluorescent-conjugated\nsecondary antibodies and isotype control antibodies\n(Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, West Grove,\nPA) were used. Antibodies used in ChIP assays included\nanti-Pol-II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology [Dallas, Texas,\nUSA]) at 2 mg/IP, anti-H3K4Me3 (Millipore [Billerica,\nMassachusetts, USA]) at 1 mg/IP, anti-H3K9/14Ac (cell\nsignaling technology [Danvers, Massachusetts, USA]) at\n2 mg/IP, or normal rabbit IgGs.\nHistology and IF Staining in Brains During\nMurine NCC\nMurine NCC was induced by i.c. injection of 50 ml of\nHBSS (Hank's balance salt solution) containing approxi-\nmately $40 M. corti metacestodes into 5-week old\nC57BL/6 mice under short-term anesthesia (Cardona\nmice were sham injected with 50 ml sterile HBSS alone. At\nindicated times postinoculation, anesthetized animals\nwere perfused through the left ventricle with 20 ml cold\nphosphate-buffered saline. The brains were immediately\nremoved from perfused animals, embedded in O.C.T.\nresin, and snap frozen. Serial horizontal cryosections,\n10 mm in thickness, were placed on silane prep slides\n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The slides were air-\ndried overnight and fixed in fresh acetone for 20 s at\nroom temperature. Acetone-fixed sections were wrapped\nin aluminum foil and stored at \u00c080C or processed imme-\ndiately for in situ IF microscopy analysis as previously\nspecific staining, several control experiments were per-\nformed. In each case, sections were blocked with\nsaturating concentrations of appropriate isotype control\nantibodies or host serum antibodies to eliminate FcR-\nmediated nonspecific binding. In addition, staining in\nthe absence of primary antibodies was performed as\nnegative controls.\nPrimary Microglia Maturation and Activation\nMicroglia were purified from postnatal Day 1 (P1) mouse\nbrains (C57BL/6) as previously described (Floden et al.,\n2014). Briefly, meninges-free cortices from P1 mice were\nisolated and trypsinized. Cells were plated onto tissue cul-\nture plastic in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium\n(DMEM)-F-12 with L-glutamine (Invitrogen [Waltham,\nMassachusetts, USA]) containing 10% heat-inactivated\nfetal bovine serum and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum\nand fed every third day. After $14 days, the cultures were\nshaken vigorously (30 min; 120 rpm on a rotary shaker) to\nremove microglia. Microglia purity was routinely deter-\nmined to be $90% cells by IF microscopy using specific\nmarkers IBA-1 or CD11b and negative staining for glial\nfibrillary acidic protein (a marker for astrocytes). The cells\nwere plated at 1.5 \u00c2 106 per well in six-well plates and were\nincubated for 24 hr at 37C in medium alone, or in the\npresence of HSF, LPS, or HSF/LPS. After 24 hr poststi-\nmulation, microglia were surface stained with anti-MHC-\nII to measure expression of this maturation marker using\na BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) as we have\npreviously described (Chauhan et al., 2014). The gating\nscheme included discrimination of single cells from doub-\nlets by plotting linear forward-scatter height versus for-\nward-scatter area. Live microglia cells were then selected\nby plotting side scatter versus the Am Cyan channel,\nwhich included the live/dead stain (live gate). From the\nlive gate, MHC-II \u00fe cells were selected via side scatter\nversus Alexa 700 channel. Gates for MHC-II \u00fe cells\nwere set based on isotype control staining. FlowJo v7.6\n(Treestar) was used for all flow cytometry analyses.\nTo test the inhibitory effect of HSF on production of\nnitric oxide (NO), the cells were plated at 8 \u00c2 104 cells per\nwell in 96-well flat-bottom plates and were stimulated\nwith medium alone, or in the presence of HSF, TLR\nligand LPS, or HSF/LPS. Culture supernatants were col-\nlected 24 hr after stimulation, and NO production was\nmeasured by using the Griess reagent (Promega\n[Fitchburg, Wisconsin, United States]) according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions.\nChIP Experiments\nChIP experiments were carried out as previously\ndescribed (Dhasarathy et al., 2007; Adelman et al.,\nand were pulsed with medium alone, or in the presence\nof HSF, LPS, HSF/LPS for 24 hr at 37C. Cells were\ncross-linked with formaldehyde for 10 min at room tem-\nperature, followed by addition of 125 mM glycine for\nChauhan et al. 3\n5 min at 4C for quenching formaldehyde. Cells were\nwashed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and har-\nvested. Cells were lysed by sonication with a previously\ndetermined optimal cycle conditions to generate 250- to\n150-bp DNA fragments using Covaris Sonicater.\nImmunoprecipitation was performed with the antibodies\nindicated, and IgG was used as a control. Precipitated\nDNAs were detected by polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) using specific primers. Sequences of the specific\nprimers used for IL-6, NOS2, TNF-a, H2Eb (MHC-II\ndomain in C57BL/6), CIITA, and GAPDH are as fol-\nlows: IL-6 (sense) 50-ACTCCTCTCTCACAGT\nCTCAATA-30 and (antisense) 50-GGGATGTCTGT\nAGTCCCAGTTTTGA-30 and (antisense) 50-CTGGT\nPCR analysis on respective immunoprecipitated DNA\nwas performed using SYBR green as the detection dye\n(Mishra et al., 2008). The percent input for each sample\nwas calculated based on a standard curve using 10%, 1%,\n0.1%, and 0.01% of input DNA. Precipitated DNA with\nanti-IgG served as a background control.\nStatistical Analysis\nStudent's t test and one-way analysis of variance was used\nto compare the means of different groups (SIGMA PLOT\n8.0 [Systat Software, San Jose, CA]). A p value of less\nthan .05 was considered to be statistically significant.\nResults\nMicroglia in Murine NCC Brains Exhibit Attenuated\nInflammatory Phenotype/Profile\nThe kinetics of microglial expression of MHC-II, TNF-a,\nIL-6, and NOS2 were compared by in situ IF microscopy\nin brain tissues from mock-infected and NCC mice.\nMicroglia were identified by IF microscopy using cell\nmarkers CD11b together with their characteristic morph-\nology and location in brain parenchyma. In normal\nphysiological conditions, microglia exhibit resting/quies-\ncent phenotypes with low basal level expression of\nCD11b, while an increased CD11b expression is among\nthe earliest signs of microglial response (Frick et al.,\nat a low/undetected basal level in microglia in mock-\ninfected brains as compared with the parasite-infected\nbrains (Figure 1). Importantly, the expression of the\nM1-inflammatory molecules, MHC-II, NOS2, TNF-a,\nand IL-6 were minimally detected in the brain of mock-\ninfected animals (Figure 1(A1), (B1), (C1), and (D1)).\nIn the parasite-infected brains, expression of MHC-II\n(Figure 1(C2)), or IL-6 (Figure 1(D2)) proteins were\nbarely detected or undetected in microglia cells in brain\nparenchyma at 1 week, and 3 week p.i. (Figure 1(A3),\n(B3), (C3), and (D3)). However, IL-6 was upregulated\nin cells with morphology similar to those of astrocytes\nlocalized to the brain anatomical region in proximity to\nthe meninges (Figure 1(E1)), suggesting a microglia-spe-\ncific immune suppression. IF staining using isotype con-\ntrol Ab or staining in the absence of primary antibodies\n(only fluorescent-conjugated secondary Ab) did not show\nany signal (Figure 1(E2) and (E3), and data not shown).\nSpecificity of the staining was also confirmed by perform-\ning positive control IF microscopy analysis to detect\nexpression of MHC-II, NOS2, and TNF-a or IL-6 after\nFrancisella novicida infection. As expected, upon intrana-\nsal infection, bacteria-infected lung tissues displayed\nextensive staining for MHC-II, NOS2, and TNF-a\n(data not shown). Thus, the low to undetected levels of\nexpression of M1-inflammatory molecules in microglia\nwas specific to parasite infection and suggests a defect\nin the activation of these cells in helminth parasite-\ninfected brains.\nHSF Inhibits Maturation and Activation of Microglia\nIn Vitro\nNext, the effect of helminth molecules on maturation of\nprimary microglia was analyzed in vitro. Flow cytometric\nanalysis revealed that exposure to HSF itself did not\naffect the surface expression of the myeloid cell matur-\nation marker MHC-II in microglia as compared with the\nuntreated cells (Figure 2(A1) and (A2)). We have recently\nreported that helminth molecules inhibit LPS-induced\nmaturation of bone marrow-derived macrophages\n(MT; Chauhan et al., 2014). We thus examined the\neffect of HSF on LPS-induced MHC-II expression in pri-\nmary microglia. Microglia stimulated with LPS alone\nexhibited an upregulated surface expression of MHC-II\n(Figure 2(A1) and (A2)). This LPS-induced activation of\nmicroglia was completely blocked upon exposure of cells\nto HSF (Figure 2(A1) and (A2)). Furthermore, these\nmicroglia treated with HSF alone, or when exposed to\nLPS in the presence and absence of HSF, displayed simi-\nlar levels of viability as the medium alone (as examined\nby MTT assay), suggesting the specificity of the immune\nsuppressive effect of HSF.\nAs NOS2 expression and subsequent NO production is\na signature for M1-inflammatory phenotype of myeloid\ncells (Jenkins and Allen, 2010), we then tested the effect of\n4 ASN Neuro\nFigure 1.

In contrast, NO was undetected in culture super-\nnatant of untreated or HSF-stimulated microglia (Figure\n2(B)). Interestingly, coexposure to HSF completely inhib-\nited the LPS-induced secretion of NO (Figure 2(B)).\nInterestingly, this blocking effect of HSF was independ-\nent of whether the cells were costimulated with HSF and\nLPS together or HSF was added before or after the add-\nition of LPS to the culture (Figure 2(B)). Furthermore,\nHSF alone did not modulate gene expression of NOS2,\nthe enzyme responsible for inducible NO production at\nboth 12 hr and 20 hr post stimulation (Figure 2(C)).\nHowever, HSF also inhibited LPS-induced NOS2\nmRNA expression (Figure 2(C)). Together, the results\nfrom these studies clearly demonstrate an inhibitory\neffect of HSF on microglia-associated M1-\ninflammatory response.\nHSF Downregulates Pol-II Recruitment at the\nPromoter of Inflammatory Mediators\nAn important step in the regulation of gene expression is\nthe recruitment of Pol-II along with the general\nFigure 2.

We next exam-\nined the effect of HSF on the recruitment of Pol-II to the\npromoter of MHC-II, CIITA, TNF-a, IL-6, and NOS2\nusing ChIP assays. As positive control, the level of Pol-II\noccupancy at the housekeeping GAPDH in the same\nsample was measured. As negative control, ChIP analysis\nusing isotype IgG antibody was performed on the same\nsamples. Compared with the untreated microglia, HSF-\nstimulated cells displayed a significantly decreased Pol-II\noccupancy at the promoter of all the immune mediators\nanalyzed (MHC-II, CIITA, TNF-a, IL-6, and NOS2;\nFigure 3(A) to (E)). The effect of HSF on LPS-induced\nPol-II recruitment to the promoter of the previously men-\ntioned host mediators was examined. As expected, expos-\nure to LPS significantly increased Pol-II occupancy at the\npromoter regions of MHC-II (Figure 3(B)), CIITA\n(Figure 3(A)), NOS2 (Figure 3(C)),TNF-a (Figure\n3(D)), and IL-6 (Figure 3(E)), whereas minimal to no\nPol-II occupancy was observed using the isotype IgG\nantibodies (data not shown). This effect of LPS was sig-\nnificantly inhibited in the presence of HSF (Figure 3). In\ncontrast, HSF, LPS, HSF/LPS stimulation had no signifi-\ncant effect on Pol-II occupancy at the housekeeping gene\nGAPDH, as compared with the untreated microglia (data\nnot shown). Moreover, as helminth infections are known\nto induce markers associated with M2 in helminth infec-\net al., 2010), Pol-II occupancy was examined at the pro-\nmoter regions of Arginase-1 (a signature marker of M2\nactivation phenotype). As compared with control cells,\nHSF-stimulated cells displayed a significantly increased\nPol-II occupancy at the promoter of Arginase-1\n(Figure 3(F)). In contrast, no difference in Pol-II occu-\npancy was observed at the promoter of Arginase-1 after\nLPS exposure, which was significantly augmented in the\npresence of HSF (Figure 3(F)). Taken together, results\nfrom these experiments suggest that HSF inhibited Pol-\nII recruitment at the promoter of the inflammatory\nimmune mediators in microglia.\nHSF Downregulates Positive Histone Marks at the\nPromoter of Inflammatory Mediators\nChromatin states, defined by well-established combin-\nations of histone marks, determine the magnitude of\ngene expression by cells in response to extracellular sti-\nving histone marks lead to chromatin remodeling in the\npromotor-proximal, which in turn modulates Pol-II bind-\ning to the promoter. Positive histone marks such as\npromoter region accessible to Pol-II and transcription\nfactors (Natoli et al., 2011). Thus, the effect of HSF on\npromoters of the previously mentioned inflammatory\nmediators was analyzed (Figure 4). ChIP analysis\nrevealed that HSF alone downregulated H3K9/14Ac\nmark at the promoter region of all the inflammatory\nmediators analyzed (Figure 4(A1), (B1), (C1), (D1), and\n(E1)). Moreover, coculturing with HSF significantly\ninhibited the LPS-induced increase in the expression of\nH3K9/14Ac mark at the promoter region of MHC-II,\n(C1), (D1), and (E1)). In contrast, incubation of HSF\nalone had no significant measurable effect on\nH3K4Me3 at the promoters of most of the measured\ninflammatory mediators (Figure 4(B2), (C2), (D2), and\n(E2)) with the exception of CIITA (Figure 4(A2)) that\nsignificantly reduced by HSF alone as compared with\nthe untreated microglia. However, as expected, exposure\nof LPS induced a significant increase in H3K4Me3 marks\nat the promoters of all of these M1-inflammatory medi-\nCostimulation of HSF and LPS substantially inhibited\nthe LPS-induced increase in H3K4Me3 marks (Figure\nperformed using isotype IgG antibody on the same sam-\nples display a very low reactivity (Figure 3, and data not\nshown). Together, these data suggest that chromatin\nmodification by helminth antigens is an important\nimmunosuppressive mechanism of inhibition of inflam-\nmatory gene expression.\nDiscussion\nNCC typically has a biphasic course: an initial phase of\nparasitic infection that is characterized with a lack of\ndetectable CNS inflammation, followed by a symptom-\natic phase associated with hyper-inflammation (Mishra\ntion as first responder cell type in the CNS that regulates\nthe development of CNS inflammation (Nayak et al.,\n2012).

We\nassessed the expression of M1 signature inflammatory\ncytokines TNF-a and IL-6 in microglia in the CNS\nduring M. corti infection. In addition, we analyzed the\nexpression of MHC-II, which is indicative of maturation\nof myeloid cells, and NOS2 that is a classical M1 myeloid\nactivation phenotype marker (Kreider et al., 2007). Our\nresults show that TNF-a and IL-6 were undetected in\nmicroglia. Moreover, expression of MHC-II and NOS2\nwas practically undetected in these cells in murine NCC\nbrains. This is in line with our recent report where a simi-\nlar trend of low/diminished expression of costimulatory\nmolecules such as CD80 and CD86 was observed in infil-\ntrating macrophages in brains of parasite-infected mice\n(Chauhan et al., 2014). We also reported that there is a\nlow/undetectable level of MHC-II in many of the infil-\ntrating macrophages in parasite-infected brains of NCC\nmice. The in vitro experiments using primary microglia\nsimilarly demonstrated inhibition of agonist-induced\nMHC-II and NOS2 expression by helminth factors.\nTogether, these results clearly demonstrate that helminth\nparasite suppress M1-inflammatory activation in micro-\nglia. Microglia are critically positioned at the interface\nbetween innate immune activation-induced CNS inflam-\nmation and subsequent manifestation of adaptive\nimmunity in the brain microenvironment. Thus, it is a\nreasonable hypothesis that dampening the TLR initiated\ninflammatory response is beneficial for parasitic growth\nand would also prevent collateral tissue damage due to\nexcessive inflammation. Moreover, an immature micro-\nglial phenotype with low expression of MHC-II down-\nregulates the proliferation of activated effector T cells\nand induces T cell anergy/regulatory phenotype\nexpansion of regulatory T cells in the CNS microenvir-\nonment has been reported in NCC patient (Adalid-\nPeralta et al., 2013). In toto, helminth-induced\ndownregulation of innate immune pathway activation is\nlikely crucial in establishment of chronic parasitic infec-\ntions as well as for maintaining tissue homeostasis.\nGene transcription is a complex process, but the expres-\nsion of gene loci in cells can be broadly divided into three\ndistinct transitional steps (Rogatsky and Adelman, 2014).\nFirst, the promoter region surrounding the transcription\nstart site must be accessible through the removal of repres-\nsive nucleosomes. Second, Pol-II and general transcrip-\ntion factors are recruited to facilitate the priming of\nRNA synthesis. Third, stimulation-specific transcriptional\nfactors and chromatin regulators are recruited to the site\nas a result of activation, leading to Pol-II migration and\nproductive transcription. Epigenetic events consisting of\nposttranslational modifications of DNA at the CpG\nmotifs and DNA binding proteins such as histones, and\nnoncoding RNA, have been demonstrated to regulate the\npreviously mentioned three states of transcriptional activ-\nity thereby determining the kinetics and magnitude of gene\nexpression (Zhou et al., 2011; Buecker and Wysocka,\n2012). The majority of these studies has been focused on\nmacrophages, and it is of note that epigenetic events mod-\nulating microglial gene expression in the context of CNS\ninflammation have been understudied. Among these\nevents, histone modifications have received the most\nattention in efforts to understand the activation of inflam-\nmatory genes. Histone modifications are broadly divided\ninto positive and negative marks that are typically corre-\nlated with the levels of productive and nonproductive gene\nexpression, respectively (Ernst et al., 2011; Zhou et al.,\n2011). In the absence of inflammatory stimuli such as\nTLR ligation, inflammatory gene expression is restrained\nby the presence of gene-specific negative histone marks\n2012). Once the cell receives stimulation through TLR lig-\nands, an increased expression of positive histone marks,\nmoter of the inflammatory cytokine gene loci (De Santa\net al., 2011). These positive histone marks are thought to\nfacilitate chromatin accessibility of genes and binding of\nfactors such as Pol-II and signaling transcription factors,\nto promote transcription elongation (Adelman et al.,\n2009). Therefore, it is indeed interesting that we show\nhere an inhibition of the LPS-induced upregulation of\nPol-II recruitment at the promoter of inflammatory medi-\nators after exposure to immune suppressive helminth-\nderived molecules. These findings are in line with earlier\nfindings that demonstrated that intracellular protozoa\nparasite Toxoplasma gondii infection impairs LPS-induced\nchromatin remodeling at TNF-a promoter (Leng et al.,\n2009) in macrophages. However, unlike Toxoplasma\ngondii infection alone, in our studies helminth factors\nfrom M. corti, which is a macroscopic and extracellular\ncestode, by themselves downregulated H3K4Me3 and\nH3K9/14Ac expression, as well as reduced the Pol-II\nrecruitment at the promoter of inflammatory mediators\nin microglia as compared with the unstimulated cells.\nThis suggests that extracellular macroscopic helminth\nparasites, such as M. corti and T. solium, have likely\nacquired additional mechanisms to modulate epigenetic\nlandscape to deactivate cells such as microglia. However,\nto conclusively ascertain this, it will be important to exam-\nine additional epigenetic mechanisms, including the distri-\nbution of other positive and negative histone marks, and\ntheir correlation with chromatin conformation and\ngenome-wide gene expression profile in microglia.\nChauhan et al. 9\nIn NCC, the loss of helminth-induced immune sup-\npressive mechanisms upon parasite death is thought to\nresult in the detrimental inflammatory response that con-\ntributes to the disease-associated neuropathology (White,\ninvasive macroscopic helminth parasites such as M. corti\nand T. solium often cause host tissue destruction because\nof their size as well as metabolic activity; however, an\ninflammatory response is undetected in the asymptomatic\nphase. TLRs act as sentinels not only for PAMPs, but\nalso recognize damage-associated molecular patterns\n(DAMPs) from dead and damaged cells and tissues,\nresulting in inflammation (Sangiuliano et al., 2014). In\nthis regard, our results presented here, along with previ-\nous reports (Chauhan et al., 2014), are of particular inter-\nest, as they demonstrate helminth factor-mediated\ndownregulation of the TLR ligation-induced inflamma-\ntory response. We speculate that helminth-mediated regu-\nlation of epigenetic pathways is likely an important\nmechanism involved in the development of the asymp-\ntomatic phase. We also anticipate that specific helminth\nmolecules differentially modulate the gene expression of\ninflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and tissue repairing\nfactors by establishing distinct histone marks.\nIdentifying which of the multitude of histone marks\nplay specific functional role in determining genome-wide\ngene expression in microglia is a major focus of the cur-\nrent research in our laboratory.\n"
