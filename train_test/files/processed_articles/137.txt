Our\nfindings show that both decisions are substitute risk management strategies. A\nhigher likelihood of bank distress makes banks reduce their on-balance sheet in-\nterest rate exposure and simultaneously intensify their swap use. Exogeneity tests\nindicate that both decisions are only endogenous to each other for banks that start\nusing swaps for the first time. For other banks, the maturity gap is endogenous to\nthe decision to use swaps, but the reverse relationship is exogenous. For banks with\ntrading activity, both decisions are exogenous to each other. We interpret these\nfindings as the maturity gap being largely determined by customer liquidity needs,\nwhereas the decision to use swaps relies on compliance with the interest rate risk\nregulation. Although hedging motives dominate, we find selective hedging behavior\nin swap use driven by the slope of the yield curve as well as by funding uncertainty.\n",

This interest rate risk is visible on the balance sheet as\nthe maturity mismatch or duration gap (i.e., the difference between the average residual\ntime to maturity of the assets and the liabilities). Financial intermediation theory stresses\nthat this risk should be hedged, and banks should instead concentrate on managing credit\nrisk. An easy way to eliminate interest rate risk is to use interest rate swaps for hedging\npurposes.\nIn our empirical study, we analyze both German universal banks' on-balance-sheet\nduration gap and off-balance-sheet interest rate swap use in a simultaneous equation\nframework using data from 2000-2011. We derive the following results for banks' interest\nrate risk management:\n\u02c7 German universal banks use on-balance-sheet adjustments of the duration gap and\ninterest rate swaps as substitute strategies for managing their overall interest rate\nrisk exposure.\n\u02c7 The cost of default makes banks take less risk on the balance sheet and hedge more\nof their risk off the balance sheet.\n\u02c7 Banks engage in selective hedging and take more interest rate risk when the yield\ncurve is steep and term transformation is profitable, but they reduce their interest\nrate risk when interbank funding uncertainty makes them vulnerable to the closely\nassociated liquidity risk.\n\u02c7 For banks with trading books, the decision to use interest rate swaps and the du-\nration gap are statistically independent. For pure banking book intermediaries, the\ndecision to use interest rate swaps depends on the maturity gap. Only banks that\nstart using swaps for the first time make a simultaneous decision when they deter-\nmine the magnitude of their duration gap and whether to use interest rate swaps.\nThe extent of interest rate swaps being used always depends on the duration gap.\nAll in all, our results provide support for the maturity gap being largely determined by\ncustomers' liquidity preferences. Banks' willingness to offer borrowers the maturity they\ndemand is supported by legal and institutional settings of the German financial system,\nespecially the high degrees of creditor and proprietary rights as well as the conservative\nvaluation of pledged collateral. The use of interest rate swaps is driven mainly by the at-\ntempt to comply with the current interest rate risk regulation in order to avoid regulatory\nactions.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nBanken sind Zinsrisiken aufgrund ihrer Gesch\u00e4ftst\u00e4tigkeit, kurzfristige Einlagen in lang-\nfristige Kredite zu transformieren, ausgesetzt.

Discussion Papers represent the authors'\npersonal opinions and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank or its staff.\n1 Introduction\nThrough their function as qualitative asset transformers, financial intermediaries are ex-\nposed to non-diversifiable risks, specifically liquidity and interest rate risk. Financial\nintermediation theory has derived models that explain the management and allocation\nof these risks. Among the seminal studies explicitly related to interest rate risk (IRR),\nDiamond (1984) stresses that banks should focus on managing credit risk for which they\npossess a monitoring advantage, and hedge all IRR. Hellwig (1994) suggests that banks\nallocate IRR to their depositors by offering contracts that do not necessarily repay de-\nposits at par, thereby focusing on the liquidity risk of deposit withdrawal. Froot and\nStein (1998) propose that banks hedge all risks that can be sold to the capital market at\nfair conditions, especially interest rate and currency risks.\nHowever, although empirical evidence shows that banks manage their IRR, almost\nno bank will hedge its IRR exposure completely (e.g., Landier, Sraer, and Thesmar,\n2013). A large fraction of smaller banks in particular can be observed that do not use\nany off-balance-sheet (OBS) IRR derivatives. The most obvious reason for banks to\nkeep IRR on the balance sheet instead of hedging it -- for example, by using interest rate\nswaps -- is the expected profitability of maturity or term transformation, which we will use\ninterchangeably. A on average steep normally shaped yield curve increases profits when\na bank operates with a positive maturity mismatch, i.e., its assets have longer maturities\nand reprice less frequently than its liabilities.1 However, these profits are associated with\nthe risk that a rise in the yield curve, especially at the lower maturity rates, may generate\nlosses as in the savings and loan (S&L) crisis. Moreover, the close alignment of interest\nand liquidity risk through the maturity mismatch can threaten banks' existence when\nthey rely too heavily on short-term wholesale funding, as the 2007-2008 financial crisis\nshowed quite plainly.\nTherefore, the question arises as to what determines banks' IRR management deci-\nsions? To answer this question, we investigate German universal banks' IRR management\nbetween 2000 to 2011 by simultaneously estimating their maturity mismatch and interest\nrate swap activities. Our empirical approach relates the simultaneous risk management\nframework of Purnanandam (2007) with the cross-sectional and time-series regression\nmodels of Chernenko and Faulkender (2011) to distinguish the use of interest rate swaps\nfor hedging and speculative purposes in panel data. We find that on-balance-sheet IRR\nmanagement and the use of interest rate swaps are substitutes for one another in pursuit\nof the goal of keeping the overall IRR exposure below regulatory thresholds. We also give\nevidence of hedging theories which predict that the cost of bankruptcy makes firms pursue\nmore conservative risk management. Selective market timing behavior is observed for the\nmaturity mismatch, the decision to use interest rate swaps and the extent of their use with\nregard to the slope of the yield curve and interbank funding uncertainty. The profitability\nof a steep yield curve induces universal banks to simultaneously increase their duration\ngap and to hold fewer interest rate swaps for hedging purposes, while the opposite holds\nfor increasing funding uncertainty.\nOne central determinant of the decision to manage risk on the balance sheet or off it\n1Memmel (2011) estimates the income from term transformation generated by German savings and\ncooperative banks over the business cycle to be around 30 basis points annually, which is a significant\nshare of their overall interest income.\nis the financial environment in which a bank operates. Allen and Santomero (2001) stress\nthat banks' risk management techniques will differ between market-based and bank-based\nfinancial systems as a result of the degree of competition financial intermediaries face from\nfinancial markets. In bank-based economies, like Germany, financial intermediaries ap-\nply intertemporal smoothing of non-diversifiable risks through the accumulation of liquid\nreserves. In market-based economies, households will withdraw their funds when banks\nbuild up liquidity reserves. Financial intermediaries need different, cross-sectional risk\nmanagement strategies to shield themselves and households' portfolios against the afore-\nmentioned risks (Allen and Gale, 1997). Increasingly popular cross-sectional risk sharing\nencompasses derivatives hedging. Our study adds to the literature by investigating if there\ndo exist differences between the market-based German sample and the U.S. commercial\nbank sample Purnanandam (2007) examined. We find that buffer stocks of liquid assets\nhave indeed a differing impact on the propensity to use interest rate swaps for hedging\npurposes. In the U.S. they serve as substitutes whereas German universal banks seem to\nconsider them complementary hedging strategies.\nWe test the endogeneity assumptions underlying the simultaneous equations frame-\nwork and cannot reject for banks with a trading book that both, the maturity gap and\nthe decision to use interest rate swaps are exogenous to each other. For banks without\na trading book, the decision to hedge is exogenous to the maturity gap, but the reverse\nrelationship is endogenous. Only in samples of banks that use interest rate swaps the\nfirst time both variables are found to be endogenous to each other. On the other hand,\nthe maturity gap is always an endogenous driver of the extent of banks' swap holdings.\nThese results seem to reflect the impact IRR regulation has on bank behavior. Banks\nwith too high an IRR exposure after netting out the OBS effects are considered \"outlier\"\nbanks that can expect supervisory scrutiny and even additional capital charges. Hence,\nonce the on-balance-sheet IRR exposure becomes too large, a bank has to look for ways\nto decrease its overall exposure and will likely do so by using interest rate swaps. Only in\nthese circumstances, the maturity gap and the decision to hedge are endogenous to each\nother. Before a bank reaches the critical threshold for on-balance-sheet exposure or once\nit has set up a derivative risk management department, the decision to use interest rate\nswaps is exogenous. As banks that have a comparatively large duration gap are those\nthat decide to use interest rate swaps, the duration gap is an endogenous driver of the\nvolume of swaps held. This suggests that banks manage their overall exposure to comply\nwith the IRR regulation, whereas the maturity gap is determined by the liquidity needs\nof bank-dependent borrowers and depositors.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the literature on IRR\nmanagement as well as selective hedging and speculation of IRR. Section 3 describes the\nempirical research strategy and puts emphasis on the instruments used to identify the\nsystem of equations in the IRR framework. Data and summary statistics are presented in\nSection 4, before we proceed with the empirical analysis. Section 5 introduces the hazard\nrate model which is estimated in order to derive proxies for the cost of default in the risk\nmanagement analysis. Section 6 presents the results for the simultaneous equations of the\nIRR management decisions, i.e., the on-balance-sheet exposure measured as the duration\ngap, the decision to use swaps and the extent of interest rate swap use. Whenever possible,\nregressions are run both cross-sectional and based on time-series estimators. The paper\nends with concluding remarks in Section 7.\n2 Interest Rate Risk Management, Selective Hedging\nand Speculation\nIn spite of banks' importance as suppliers of external capital and the IRR related to\ntheir activities, the literature on banks' IRR management is relatively scarce, whereas the\nmajority of risk management literature focuses on corporate hedging decisions, mainly\ncommodity price hedging. Among the few exemptions, Schrand and Unal (1998) examine\nthrifts' overall risk management and find -- in line with the models of Diamond (1984)\nand Froot and Stein (1998) -- a shift from interest rate risk towards credit risk following\nthrift conversion. These authors suggest that risk management is a mean of allocating\nrisks from homogeneous risk sources, such as IRR, to core-business risks, where the bank\npossesses a comparative information advantage.\nA central motive of hedging is the reduction of cash flow variability and consequently\nbankruptcy risk. Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993) endogenize the cost of financial dis-\ntress by assuming external capital to be more expensive than internally generated funds.\nIn support of their model, Brewer, Jackson, and Moser (1996) show that hedging IRR\nreduces the cost of uninsured debt, i.e., rates paid on commercial paper issued by thrifts.\nPurnanandam (2007) simultaneously investigates the use of derivatives for hedging pur-\nposes and on-balance-sheet IRR management of the duration gap for U.S. commercial\nbanks. He finds that banks intensify IRR management in response to increasing default\nrisk. Additionally, the use of interest rate derivatives makes banks less vulnerable to mon-\netary shocks and allows them to change the composition of their portfolios less drastically.\nMemmel and Schertler (2014) show -- for the same sample of German universal banks\nwe investigate -- that net interest income is more heavily affected by changes in the yield\ncurve than by changes in the composition of asset and liability portfolios. Banks that\nuse IRR derivatives are less vulnerable to interest rate shocks, and hence derivatives are\nmainly employed for hedging purposes. However, when the yield curve steepens derivative\nusers increase their maturity mismatch more significantly. In contrast to the papers that\nshow that banks use interest rate swaps predominately for hedging purposes, Begenau,\nPiazzesi, and Schneider (2013) prove that the largest four U.S. banks that serve as swap\ndealers used their swap positions to increase their exposure to IRR.\nBolton, Chen, and Wang (2011) present a dynamic risk management model where\nbankruptcy risk increases the risk of not having sufficient funds for value-adding invest-\nment projects, thus increasing the incentives to hedge. However, for financially con-\nstrained firms it is optimal not to hedge as margin requirements override cash flow volatil-\nity concerns. Moreover, their model shows that market timing behavior can be rational\nin terms of ensuring sufficient funding sources.2\nMarket timing of risk management activities has received increasing attention in fi-\nnancial research. Stulz (1996) defines selective hedging as managers incorporating market\nviews into the timing of risk management activities, and considers this a mild form of\nspeculation. Empirical and survey evidence from non-financial firms suggests that timing\nderivatives markets is done quite frequently. Such strategies should, however, result in\npermanent additional profits only if managers have an information advantage, but sum\n2The model of Bolton et al. (2011), however, incorporates equity market timing through the issuance\nof new shares, and not debt market or derivatives market timing.\nup to zero otherwise.\nThe main drivers of selective IRR risk management when entering into new debt\ncontracts or interest rate derivatives are the level and, especially, the slope of the yield\ncurve. Faulkender (2005) finds that firms alter the IRR exposure of new debt issues from\nfixed to floating by jointly entering into interest rate swaps when the yield curve is steep.\nVickery (2008) confirms these results for small bank-dependent firms that choose between\nfixed-rate and variable-rate loans. Credit constrained firms, however, are more likely to\nchoose fixed-rate interest per se. Recently, Mian and Santos (2012) have found evidence of\nactive maturity management driven by liquidity considerations. Credit-worthy firms tend\nto renegotiate and extend loan maturity early during periods of good financial conditions.\nThe behavior of bank-dependent borrowers should have a directly observable effect on\nbanks' balance sheets and might trigger changes in their OBS risk management. Besides\nselective hedging, corporate use of interest rate derivatives also reveals speculation on\ninterest movements. G\u00e9czy, Minton, and Schrand (2007) and Chernenko and Faulkender\n(2011) find evidence that financially unconstrained firms incorporate market views into\ntheir derivatives positions and use interest rate swaps, at least partly, for speculative\npurposes, too.\n3 Research Design\n3.1 Regression Design\nIf banks manage their overall IRR exposure, -- the composite on- and off-balance sheet\nexposure -- decisions on the maturity mismatch and on the use of interest rate swaps\nare jointly determined. We therefore follow Purnanandam (2007) in estimating these\ndecisions simultaneously using 2SLS IV regressions in order to overcome endogeneity\nand the resulting simultaneity bias of OLS coefficients. In line with most of the risk\nmanagement literature, we separate the decision to hedge from the extent of derivative\nuse by estimating a Cragg (1971) model. The model follows a two-step procedure, and\ninvestigates first which determinants drive the decision to use interest rate derivatives. In\nthe subsequent step it examines the drivers of the extent of derivatives use conditional\non a positive decision to use derivatives. The decision to hedge corresponds to a dummy\nvariable that takes the value of 1 if a bank reports a non-zero volume of interest rate\nswaps outstanding. Although interest rate swaps are only one out of several derivatives a\nbank can use to offset IRR, they are the most common ones to hedge IRR. As information\non interest rate swaps is available at the highest quality, we exclusively focus our IRR\nhedging analysis on the use of interest rate swaps. The extent of hedging is modeled\nas the natural logarithm of the nominal volume of interest rate swaps outstanding to\ntotal assets. The potential sample selection bias arising from conditioning the sample to\nbanks that decide to use interest rate swaps is controlled for by including the inverse Mills\nratio. The modified duration gap is modeled using information available to the banking\nsupervisors on different brackets of remaining time to maturity for classes of assets and\nliabilities and the interest rate sensitivities from the standard approach for IRR regulation\nof the German banking supervisory authority BaFin. See Appendix B, for more details\nof the modified duration gap.\nTo estimate the simultaneous equation system exclusion restrictions are required.\nValid IVs are allowed to influence only one of the two risk management decisions, ei-\nther the on-balance-sheet or the off-balance-sheet decision. We use two instruments for\neach equation and provide overidentification tests to support the validity of the IVs. With\nstrong and valid instruments at hand, we test the endogeneity assumed in the simultane-\nous equation framework, using endogeneity tests based on the C statistic, which is defined\nas the difference in overidentification J-tests derived from 2SLS models.3\nWe will use the following instruments in the risk management equations and justify\ntheir use extensively in Section 3.2. For the duration gap, we propose the use of the\nshare of Customer loans in relation to total assets and Loan commitments to total assets.\nFor the decision to use interest rate swaps and the extent of their use we include Past\nswap experience as a dummy variable that equals 1 from the point in time a bank has first\nstarted to use swaps. To create this variable we use data starting in 1998. We additionally\nuse Average board experience, as the average experience of all board members in relevant\nexecutive management positions measured in years, as an instrument for the decision to\nuse interest rate swaps but not for the extent of their use. This allows us to correct for\nthe sample selection bias by adding the inverse Mills ratio into the extent of interest rate\nswap regressions. Furthermore, we include an exogenous instrument with regard to the\nrisk management decisions in the estimation of the hazard rate model. Here, we choose\nHidden liabilities, a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if a bank avoids writing off\nassets. This gives the following system of equations:\nX + DG\nBExp + SU4\nX + SU\nX + SE\n,\nwhere subscripts indicating bank or time units are left out for simplicity. DG stands\nfor the (modified) duration gap, SU is the dummy of the swap use decision, and SE\nrepresents the extent of interest rate swap use, proxied by the logarithm of the nominal\nvolume of interest rate swaps in relation to total assets. CL is customer loans, and LC\nloan commitments. PSE is the dummy of past interest rate swap experience, and BExp is\nthe average board experience, while IMR is the inverse Mills ratio controlling for sample\nselection in the extent of interest rate swap use. X is a vector of all explanatory variables\nthat influence all risk management decisions including the Probability of default (PD).\nFor the duration gap and the extent of swap use equations we exploit both the cross-\nsectional and the time-series variation. The cross-sectional variation is captured applying\nboth, between effects and Fama-MacBeth estimators. The results are then compared to\nthose from pooled OLS models to evaluate the impact of a potential bias. The time-series\nvariation is investigated applying the within transformation of a fixed effects estimator.\nWhen modelling the decision to use swaps, we apply pooled probit regressions only in\norder not to lose observations on banks that never hedge or, alternatively, hedge during\nthe whole sample period.\nThe use of cross-sectional as well as time-series estimators for IRR management de-\ncisions, such as the on-balance-sheet exposure and the extent of interest rate swap use,\n3The C statistic can be computed for clustered standard errors, whereas the Hausman test is calculated\nunder homoskedasticity. For probit models we use the endogeneity test of Lee (1992) but linear probability\nmodels using the C-statistic confirm our results.\nis related to the empirical approach of Chernenko and Faulkender (2011) who examine\nnon-financial firms' interest rate swap use. One of the key elements of interpreting the\ncoefficients is that these firms are assumed to have a constant exposure to IRR over time.\nWhen firms manage towards a target fixed-to-floating IRR exposure, average hedge ratios\nshould be explained by between effects and Fama-MacBeth models. In contrast, devi-\nations from a target hedge ratio over time can be understood as market views on IRR\ndrivers being incorporated into the hedging decision. Such market timing is then captured\nby fixed effects estimators.\nAlthough the assumption of a constant IRR exposure over time is doubtful for banks\nin general, small, locally operating savings and cooperative banks have homogeneous\nbusiness models with a focus on granting loans and accepting deposits, providing them\nthereby with comparably stable on-balance-sheet exposures. Evidence is provided by\nmajority of banks' interest income and expenses using revolving portfolios based on the\nassumption that on-balance exposure remains stable via replacement of maturing assets\nand liabilities with new business of equal maturity. The results of Memmel and Schertler\n(2014) provide further support for the on-balance-sheet exposure being comparatively\nstable among German banks.\nAdditionally, small universal banks are also more likely not to engage in trading ac-\ntivities and most of them only have a banking book and no trading book. Pure banking\nbook institutions are prohibited from using OBS instruments for speculation purposes to\na substantial extent.4 In analyzing only pure banking book institutions, we thus have a\nsetting similar to Chernenko and Faulkender (2011) for which the constant on-balance\nexposure assumption and hence the interpretation of cross-sectional and time-series esti-\nmators seems justified. In order to examine the whole German banking sector, we run\nregressions for the total sample, which consists of around 90% non-banking book insti-\ntutions, and for the sub-sample of trading book banks. The latter not only have more\nexposure to market risk, but they may also use interest rate swaps for speculation which\ngoes beyond the market timing of risk management activities. For example, Begenau et al.\n(2013) show that the four largest U.S. banks use interest rate swaps to increase their IRR\nexposure instead of hedging it. Furthermore, banks might use trading activities to shift\nrisks, which harms traditional relationship banking (Boot and Ratnovski, 2013).\n3.2 Exclusion Restrictions\nIn the following we draw on the literature to justify the use of the instruments we intro-\nduced above.\nInstruments to identify the probability of default:\nAs corporate risk management theory stresses the importance of the cost of bankruptcy\nfor risk taking, hedging and speculation behavior, we include the natural logarithm of\nthe Probability of default (PD) derived from a hazard rate model to proxy for this de-\n4The German Banking Act (KWG) defines banks as trading book institutions when they have on\naverage (in a single year) either trading activities of more than 5% (6%) in relation to both total assets\nand off-balance-sheet activities, or of more than e15 (20) million in absolute terms. These volumes are\nminor compared to the total assets of universal banks in Germany, even of the small cooperative banks.\nSee Table 2 for details.\nterminant. However, the cost of bankruptcy and the resulting financial constraints are\nendogenous to risk management decisions (e.g., Froot et al., 1993; Bolton et al., 2011).\nAlthough the variables we use in the hazard rate model are not identical to those in the\nrisk management regressions, many of the variables that explain a bank's default are also\ndrivers of its risk management decisions and hence do not qualify as IVs.\nIn order for the PD, derived from the hazard rate model, to be an exogenous deter-\nminant of the IRR management decisions, at least one explanatory variable must not\nhave a direct influence on the magnitude of the duration gap, the decision to use swaps,\nand the extent of their use. We argue that avoiding write-offs on assets,5 -- creating so\ncalled Hidden liabilities -- satisfies the exclusion restriction. This accounting option in\nthe German GAAP -- (the commercial code, HGB) -- is often used as a form of \"window\ndressing\" for accounting statements by postponing realized losses into the future.\nBiddle, Ma, and Song (2013a,b) observe that accounting conservatism6 reduces sub-\nsequent corporate bankruptcy risk through restricted earnings management and higher\ncash reserves, as well as by directly reducing operating cash flow downside risk. Avoiding\nhidden liabilities and thereby realizing losses on securities held in a more timely manner\nis a form of conservative accounting. After controlling for the indirect effect accounting\nconservatism has on cash holdings, by controlling for liquid assets, there should be no\nfurther effect of hidden liabilities on the risk management decisions other than through\noperating cash flow downside risk, which should be correlated with the PD estimates.\nInstruments to identify the maturity gap equation:\nThe maturity gap, especially for savings and cooperative banks, is driven by the demand\nfor long maturity liquidity on the asset side and the supply of short-term deposits on\nthe liability side. In contrast, interbank loans are used by these banks to reduce the on-\nbalance-sheet exposure (Ehrmann and Worms, 2004). Instrument validity is given when\nthe only impact Customer loans have on interest rate swap use emanates from the IRR\nthey add to the modified duration gap.\nWe argue further that Loan commitments have a direct impact on the maturity mis-\nmatch but not on interest rate swap usage. This argument seems counterintuitive as loan\ncommitments are OBS activities and do not have a directly observable impact on the on-\nbalance-sheet IRR. Moreover, if they were fixed-rate loan commitments their IRR could\nbe hedged using futures or forwards.\nAlthough we cannot distinguish fixed-rate from floating-rate loan commitments, we\ncreate a loan commitment proxy that is likely to be dominated by floating-rate agreements.\nOur definition excludes long-term commitments for investment expenditures and real\nestate loans, but includes household and corporate lines of credit that are more likely to\nbe short-term floating-rate agreements.7\n5Write-offs can be avoided by assigning and reclassifying certain kinds of securities to the banking\nbook, where they are accounted for at historical cost instead of their lower market value.\n6Accounting conservatism is considered to be a prudent reaction to risk and uncertainty and their\nadequate disclosure in accounting statements. Unconditional conservatism is the effect of accounting\nprinciples per se. Conditional conservatism relates to more timely recognition of negative corporate\noutcomes.\n7Davydenko and Franks (2008) present summary statistics from major German commercial banks'\ndefaulted corporate borrowers. The majority of loans and credit lines are, indeed, short-term with\nmaturities of less than one year and floating-rate. However, their sample might be biased to firms that\nwere already financially constrained when they received their loans and overdrafts.\nThe literature offers additional arguments why undrawn loan commitments might have\na direct impact on banks' balance sheets. Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002) derive a model\nin which banks possess a natural hedge against liquidity risk via imperfectly correlated\ndraw-down risk for loan commitments and withdrawal risk for deposits. Carrying out\nboth, lending and deposit activities offers banks synergies in using the buffer stock of\nliquid assets.\nBerger, Espinosa-Vega, Frame, and Miller (2005) find that corporates drawing loans\nunder commitment receive loans with no different maturity if they are high-risk firms.\nOn the other hand, high-risk corporates not drawing under commitment receive only\nloans with significantly lower maturity. Loan commitments, especially (revolving) lines\nof credit, are means of acquiring soft information on borrowers out of relationship lend-\ning8 and provide monitored liquidity insurance that prevents borrowers' illiquidity seeking\n(Acharya, Almeida, Ippolito, and Perez, 2014). Undrawn loan commitments can, there-\nfore, have a direct effect on the existing maturity gap via the information collected in\nthe past from relationship lending, intensified monitoring upon frequent renewal, and the\nliquidity hedge deposits offer.\nInstruments to identify the swap use decision and the extent of their use equations:\nThe Past swap experience dummy serves as a proxy for the existence of a derivatives risk\nmanagement department or experience in handling interest rate derivatives. Chen (2011)\nuses a similar instrumental variable. More precisely, he uses the past experience of fund\nmanagers as an IV for the current use of derivatives by the hedge funds they manage.\nPurnanandam (2007) uses a cross-sectional hedging experience dummy that takes the\nvalue of 1 if the bank holds derivatives for purposes other than IRR management during\nthe same period. Unfortunately, in our sample too few banks use currency swaps to create\nIVs that pass the weak identification test.9\nOne potential concern with a dummy based on past hedging experience is that previous\nyears' interest rate swap use predetermines contemporaneous use. This would be the case\nif a bank buys swaps with maturities of more than one year and holds them until maturity.\nWe do not see a problem in using past swap use for the following reasons. First, about 10%\nof the banks in our sample that used swaps in an earlier year do not do so the year after.\nTherefore, swap experience does not perfectly predict current swap use and some banks\nchange frequently between years where they use swaps and years where they do not. Even\nif banks engage in swaps with maturities of more than one year, it is possible for them to\nclose these positions. Second, Gorton and Rosen (1995) report that a substantial share\nof interest rate swaps held by banks have maturities of less than one year for reasons of\nregulatory capital charges on counterparty risk. Moreover, during the past decade, there\nhas been a substantial increase in short-term maturity overnight index swaps (OIS) to\nhedge interbank rates. Current figures presented in Fleming, Jackson, Li, Sarkar, and\n8See, for example, Berger and Udell (1995); Jim\u00e9nez, Lopez, and Saurina (2009); Norden and Weber\n(2010), and specifically for German banks screening for bankruptcy risk, Davydenko and Franks (2008).\n9We run robustness checks, not reported for brevity, that contain information on whether the bank\nuses any kind of derivatives to hedge or speculate on currency or market risk. Unfortunately, data is\navailable only until 2008. The coefficients derived are very similar to those reported when employing\nthe Past swap experience and overidentification tests are also insignificant for all samples investigated.\nHowever, the weak instrument statistics are significantly lower, and although they are still above the\nvalues suggested by Stock and Yogo (2005), the coefficients for the instrumented Dummy interest rate\nswap use cannot be distinguished from zero.\nZobel (2012) support these statements. Although 10-year and 30-year interest rate swaps\nare still frequently traded tenors for hedging the IRR from long-term loans, the vast\nmajority of all interest rate derivatives have maturities of less than one-year.\nOur second instrument is based on the finding that characteristics of board members\nhave an impact on hedging decisions, but not on the extent of hedging (e.g., Zhu, 2011,\n2012). Therefore, we include the average experience of all board members in bank execu-\ntive positions measured in years as an explanatory variable for the decision to use swaps.\nAs this variable does not influence the extent of hedging, we can use it additionally to\nestimate the inverse Mills ratio in a sample selection model and do not simply identify the\nselection model from the non-linearity of a probit estimator. Average board experience\ntherefore qualifies the exclusion restrictions for both, the maturity gap and the extent\nof swap use decision and only has a direct impact on the decision to use interest rate\nswaps. Zhu (2011) uses a dummy based on whether the CEO is below the age of 45 as\na variable identifying the decision to hedge, but not the extent thereof.10 We argue that\nboard experience has no other influence on the maturity gap decision apart from the effect\nthrough the use of interest rate derivatives, as the maturity gap for most banks is largely\ndetermined by borrower and depositor liquidity needs.\n3.3 Common Control and Market Timing Variables\nOur bank-specific explanatory variables are consistent with those used in the study by\nPurnanandam (2007). Size, measured as the logarithm of total assets, is included to proxy\nfor economies of scale in setting up a derivatives department. Larger banks are more likely\nto have a risk management department that is proficient enough to deal with derivatives.\nAt the same time, larger banks are also more likely to have other income sources apart\nfrom interest income and might, as a result, not depend to the same extent on income\nfrom term transformation. Based on Froot et al. (1993) banks with more investment\nopportunities should be more likely to decrease IRR both, on balance sheet and off balance\nsheet. Investment opportunities are proxied in line with the banking literature (e.g., Froot\nand Stein, 1998) by the (annual) Total asset growth rate. As current risk management\nliterature stresses the importance of liquidity management considerations, we include two\nmeasures which capture liquidity on the asset and liability side, Liquid assets, the sum of\ncash reserves and securities which can be sold within one year, and the ratio of Savings\ndeposits to total assets as a measure of funding strength.\nIn addition to Purnanandam, we include a Branch HHI, a Herfindahl (-Hirschman)\nindex of branch concentration at the county level, as a measure of bank competition.11\nThe model derived by Adam, Dasgupta, and Titman (2007) predicts that competition has\na direct impact on the decision to hedge risks in equilibrium. Furthermore, competition\nmay have an effect on the maturity mismatch choice via its nexus with risk taking. When\nwe investigate the total sample, we also include a dummy that takes the value of 1 for\nbanks with a trading book, and we include banking group dummies (savings, cooperative\n10For the smaller German savings banks and cooperative banks, it is not possible to identify the CEO\nor the CFO of a bank as these banks do not distinguish between different board responsibilities.\n11Most of the savings banks and cooperative banks, and, therefore, the majority of banks in our sample,\nare limited to running branches in their municipality, which is referred to as the regional principle. We\ntherefore consider the county level the relevant market to measure banking concentration.\nand private banks) to control for different business models in the cross-sectional settings.\nTime-series models of the maturity gap and the extent of interest rate swap use as\nwell as the pooled probit models of the decision to use interest rate swaps also include\nmacroeconomic variables to test for market timing behavior in IRR management. These\ninclude the slope of the yield curve (e.g., Faulkender, 2005; Vickery, 2008) and a variable\nwe refer to as EURIBOR spread, the difference between the 12-month EURIBOR and\nthe 12-month German government bond yield. The latter is intended to capture the\neffects of the TED spread used in U.S. banking studies and proxies for interbank funding\nuncertainty. We also interact both of the aforementioned macroeconomic variables with\nthe 1-year government bond yield to analyze differing effects of banks' risk taking behavior\nin response to the monetary environment (Borio and Zhu, 2012).12\n4 Data and Summary Statistics\nchose the start date of the analysis in accordance with the availability of data for the\nvariable Liquid assets. For the hazard rate model we employ data starting in 1994 to\nmake use of as many default events as possible, especially restructuring mergers during\nthe wave of consolidation the German banking sector underwent in the 1990s. To create\nthe instrument Past swap experience, we use information dating back to 1998. All data is\nprovided by the prudential banking supervision databases of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nTo cope with outliers, we windsorize our variables at the 99th percentile and at the 1st\npercentile, except for Size and (the logarithm of) the Probability of default estimated in\nthe hazard rate model. The impact of mergers on the consistency of accounting measures\nis accounted for by creating a new banking entity after every merger taking place. This\nis the most frequently applied approach when using Bundesbank data. When we create\nthe Past swap experience dummy, the variable takes the value of 1 for the new entity if\nat least one of the two pre-merger institutions used any kind of swaps before the merger.\nAs our variable is intended to proxy for the existence of a derivatives risk management\ndepartment, this procedure seems justified as the knowledge of how to hedge risks off the\nbalance sheet is unlikely to be lost during a merger process.\n4.2 Summary Statistics\nTable 1 displays the distribution of banks using interest rate swaps over the sample period\nfrom 2000 to 2011. Although the absolute number of banks reporting interest rate swap\nuse increases only slightly from 599 to 677, their relative share increases heavily from\nbanking sector that led to the disappearance of about 700 banks during the sample period.\nThe relative increase in the use of interest rate swaps was quite sharp between 2003 and\n2007, but slowed thereafter. A clear relation between a bank's size and the use of interest\n12For an overview of the variables used in the empirical study, including those in the hazard rate model,\nsee Appendix A.\nTable 1: Distribution of Swap Users over Time\nSize Quintiles\nYear Total No. No. of swap in % 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th\nof banks users\nThis table presents the distribution of German universal banks' use of interest rate swaps according to size quintiles between 2000 to 2011.\nSize quintiles are based on total assets in 2011, where the 1st quintile encompasses the smallest and the 5th the largest banks. Swap users are\ndefined according to a positive nominal volume of interest rate swaps at the end of a given calendar year.\nrate swaps is observable. Whereas in the lowest size quintile 12% of banks hold interest\nrate swaps in 2011, the percentage increases gradually and peaks at the highest quintile\nInterestingly, the current share of interest rate swap users is close 50%, which corre-\nsponds to the solution of firms hedging in equilibrium in the Adam et al. (2007) model.\nThese authors also summarize many studies which find the percentage of non-financial\nfirms in several industries and indices to be close to this value. As the banking sector is a\nregulated industry with supervision of risk management, this result should, however, not\nbe mistaken for the industry equilibrium percentage of hedging firms in the model cited\nabove.\nSurprisingly, we find a significantly larger percentage of banks that manage IRR off\nthe balance sheet in our study compared to Purnanandam (2007), although the theory\nof intertemporal smoothing would have predicted the opposite (Allen and Santomero,\n2001). In our sample, 31.28% of universal banks report interest rate swaps outstanding in\n2003, whereas Purnanandam reports 5.94% users of interest rate derivatives for hedging\npurposes for his U.S. commercial bank sample in the third quarter of 2003.\nWe present summary statistics of the variables used in the risk management equations\nin Table 2, separately for interest rate swap users and non-users, and test for differences\nin means and medians between these two groups. Some noteworthy features appear:\nswap users have indeed a higher modified duration gap. The mean difference is 0.14\nand significant at the 1% level. Moreover, swap users are larger in size with regard to\ntotal assets and are more likely to have a trading book. They hold less liquid assets and\nreceive less funding from savings deposits, but nevertheless make more loan commitments.\nInterestingly, the average board experience is significantly lower for banks that use swaps.\nFor most of the variables, the differences between users and non-users are significant at\nthe 1% level. One exception is the difference in the means of the probability of default,\nwhich cannot be distinguished statistically.\nGerman universal banks indeed have comparatively large buffer stocks of liquid assets,\nas predicted by the theory of intertemporal smoothing in Allen and Gale (1997). The\nmean of liquid assets in relation to total assets is around 43.5% for swap users and 44.5%\nfor non-users, and the difference of 1 percentage point is economically not very large,\nalthough statistically significant. Purnanandam (2007) reports non-users as having, on\naverage, 36% and users 30.5% liquid assets. Here, overall levels are smaller and the\ndifference between users and non-users of interest rate derivatives for hedging purposes\nis more pronounced. It should, however, be borne in mind that the definitions of liquid\nassets do not completely match.\n5 Hazard Rate Model\nFollowing Purnanandam (2007), we proxy for the cost of bankruptcy by estimating the\nbank-specific probability of default (PD) from a hazard rate model.13 The hazard rate\nmodel is estimated using default events from 1994 to 2011. All covariates are lagged\nvalues from the previous year-end. Defaults for 2012 were not available at the start of\nthis study. PDs for 2011 have therefore been predicted from the coefficients derived with\ncovariates until 2010. We include the following default indicators into the dependent\nvariable dummy: forced closures, restructuring mergers, and capital injections by either\nsectoral insurance schemes or the federal scheme set up during the recent financial crisis.\nThe model is estimated using a pooled multiperiod logit model (Shumway, 2001) with\nstandard errors clustered at the bank level. A similar model is used in the banking super-\nvision department of the Bundesbank to gauge the financial soundness of national banks.\nThe bank-specific covariates are based on the CAMELS taxonomy and therefore include\nvariables capturing capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and\nsensitivity to market risk.14\nSpecifically, we choose the following variables to estimate the PD: capital adequacy is\nincluded using the Tier 1 capital ratio, the ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets\n(RWA), and Total bank reserves, the ratio of total banks reserves that serve as equity to\ntotal assets (TA). The dummy Reserve reduction takes the value 1 if the aforementioned\nreserves have been reduced. Asset quality is proxied using a Herfindahl (-Hirschman) in-\ndex (HHI) of loan concentration over 23 industry sectors. Earnings are captured by ROE,\nthe return on equity, defined as operating income to equity. Additionally, the competitive\nenvironment is controlled for by the Branch HHI on the county level. Financial interme-\ndiation theory provides predictions for the nexus of risk taking and competition. Boyd\n13This approach implicitly assumes identical loss given default (LDG) for banks when the PD is the only\nrelevant variable. Purnanandam (2007), however, finds no qualitatively different results when proxying\nLGD instead of PD. Moreover, the model of Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2013) implies that a bank's PD,\nand not the LGD, is the major driver of a \"maturity rat race\" leading to excessively short durations for\nbanks' liabilities.\n14Liquid asset measures are not included as an explanatory variable, which is the common procedure\nin the \"Bundesbank hazard rate model\". If included, such measures show up insignificant as liquidity\nappears to be an indicator for the lack of business opportunities and not of active risk management\nTable 2: Summary Statistics\nSwap Users Non-Swap Users Group Differences p-values\nMean Median Mean Median Mean Median Mean Median\nHazard Rate Model\nIRR Simultaneous Equations\nThis table presents descriptive statistics of German universal banks between 2000 to 2011. Total assets are in emillions. Avg. board\nexperience is in years. All other variables are in percentage points. The p-value on mean differences is a two-sided t-test computed\nunder the assumption of independence. The p-values of median differences are based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The branch\nand De Nicol\u00f3 (2005) show that the effect of competition on bank risk taking depends on\nborrowers' reaction to the transmission channel of market power into loan rates. More\nconcentrated banking markets can trigger less risk taking through rising charter values.\nHowever, raising loan rates can also increase risk taking if the pool of borrowers is more\nlikely to default. Therefore, predictions on the coefficient of the Branch HHI cannot be\nmade. The level of the short-term interbank 3-month EURIBOR rate and regional GDP\ngrowth at the state level are included to control for changes in the macroeconomic envi-\nronment. Dummies for savings and cooperative banks capture heterogeneity in business\nmodels with private banks being the reference group left out.\nThe impact of these variables can be seen in Table 3 and is presented displaying\nmarginal effects from the logit model. As expected, Tier 1 capital and bank reserve en-\ndowments reduce bankruptcy risk significantly, whereas the dummy indicating reserve\nreductions is an indicator of significantly higher default likelihood. Specialization in cer-\ntain business sectors via concentrated loan portfolios does not significantly impact default\nlikelihoods. ROE significantly reduces bankruptcy risk through its effect on capital accu-\nmulation. A higher value for the Branch HHI indicates more concentrated and, therefore,\nless competitive banking markets. Our results thus indicate that competition in the\nbanking market slightly improves banking stability. Business conditions captured in local\nGDP growth have no significant influence on bank default, but a lower level for short-\nterm interbank rates increases distress likelihood as predicted by the risk-taking channel\nof monetary policy (Borio and Zhu, 2012). At first glance, this finding contradicts the\neffect that would have been attributed to funding conditions and experiences of the U.S.\nsavings and loan (S&L) crisis. However, contemporaneous studies confirm the positive\nrelation of short-term interest rates to banks' risk-taking behavior (Jim\u00e9nez, Ongena,\nWe consider Hidden liabilities to be exogenous to the risk management decisions exam-\nined in Section 6. The coefficient is positive as expected and significant with a t-statistic\nof almost 3.3. Having hidden liabilities on the balance sheet increases the likelihood of\ndefault during the following year by 35%, a change of high economic magnitude. In-\nstrumenting actual defaults with the Dummy hidden liabilities in the risk management\nregressions of Section 6 -- using defaults as the only variable to be instrumented in a lin-\near probability model -- we receive weak instrument statistics which are always above the\nrule of thumb threshold of 10. Except for the extent of swap use time-series equation the\nKleibergen-Paap F-statistic is also above the critical threshold of 16.38 Stock and Yogo\n(2005) calculated for the Cragg-Donald F-statistic received under the assumption of i.i.d.\nstandard errors for a 10% maximal size distortion of the 2SLS estimator. Although no\ncritical values for the Kleibergen-Paap statistic with clustered standard errors exist, the\nF-statistics are in general of conveniant magnitude to conclude that hidden liabilities are\nan instrument strong enough to estimate a PD that is exogenous to the risk management\ndecisions. In further regressions where both, the actual default and the decision to use\nswaps or the maturity gap are considered endogenous and are therefore instrumented, we\ncannot reject tests of overidentifying restrictions with the null of valid instruments in all\ncases at the 10% level. Overidentification is achieved using the two instruments for the\ndecision to use interest rate swaps or the maturity gap. Furthermore, we provide in the\ncolumn on the right to the Kleibergen-Paap statistics also the Angrist-Pischke statistic\nwhen the effect of the other two instruments is partialled out. Again, these statistics\nTable 3: Hazard Rate Model\nKleibergen-Paap (Angrist-Pischke) F -stat.

Angrist-Pischke statistics are the F -statistics when\nthe impact of the other two instruments has been partialled out. Kleibergen-Paap statistics, on the other hand, are the first\nstage F -statistics when only the distress events are instrumented and are always carried out as linear probability models\n(Angrist, 2001). The regression for deriving the overidentification statistic with the hedging decision as the dependent\nvariable is a two-step IV-Probit regressions (Newey, 1987) and the overidentification statistic is from Lee (1992). In all other\nregressions the overidentification test is a Hansen-J test.\nconfirm the strength of hidden liabilities as an instrument to identify the PD, except for\nthe time-series equation of the extent of swap use. As we are interested in the impact the\nlatent variable Probability of default has on risk management decisions rather than the\nactual default, we will not proceed using actual default in the following risk management\nregressions.\nThe hazard rate model has both, good predictive and discriminatory powers. Statis-\ntical power is evaluated using the pseudo R2, which has a value of 0.189. Discriminatory\npower is judged using the value of the area under the Receiver Operating Characteris-\ntics (ROC) Curve, which is 0.859. Both values are comparatively good considering the\nparsimonious use of explanatory variables compared with other studies.\nUnlike in the U.S., the German banking industry did not undergo a major crisis with\nits underlying causes in the dynamics of interest rates, like the S&L crisis that affected\nthrifts in the U.S. during the 1980s. Although we find that defaulting banks were more\nsensitive to a decrease in the level of interbank rates, we did not include specific variables\nrelated to interest rate risk taking, and thus there exists no ex ante mechanical relation\nbetween the PDs derived and IRR management.\n6 Simultaneous Interest Rate Risk Management\nWe present and discuss the results of the three equations in the simultaneous model --\nestimated using two-stage least squares (2SLS) -- in different tables. Standard errors\nare either clustered at bank level or bootstrapped. Results for cross-sectional models are\npresented as between effects as well as pooled IV models. In Table 4 and 5 we provide\nsupport that pooled models for the modified duration gap and the extent of interest rate\nswap use derive coefficients quite similar to Fama-MacBeth models when all explanatory\nvariables are considered exogenous. In contrast to the Fama-MacBeth method, pooled\n2SLS offers a rich variety of test statistics for the IVs and corrects standard errors for the\nfact that the endogenous variables have been instrumented in the first stage.\n6.1.1 Cross-Sectional Variation\nTable 6 presents the cross-sectional results of the maturity gap equation within the si-\nmultaneous risk management framework. As expected, the coefficients of the swap use\ndummy are significantly positive, indicating that banks deciding to use interest rate swaps\nare operating with a higher maturity mismatch. On average, universal banks that use\nswaps have a 0.16 percentage point higher modified duration gap. The effect is highest\nfor trading book institutions where the effect amounts to 0.65, or 0.48 percentage points,\ndepending on the estimated model. The economic magnitude of these coefficients is quite\nsubstantial. In the pooled OLS setting switching from a non-swap user to a user increases\nthe modified duration gap on average by 0.2 standard deviations (sd), for pure banking\nbook institutions by 0.19 sd, and for trading book banks by even 0.47 sd. The posi-\ntive coefficients give evidence that, although trading book institutions might use interest\nrate swaps for the purpose of speculation, they predominantly seem to use them for the\npurpose of hedging, and confirm previous results from Memmel and Schertler (2014).\nTable 4: Maturity Gap - Cross-Sectional Models (Exogenous)\nBetween effects Fama-MacBeth Pooled OLS\nTotal sam-\nple\nNon-\ntrading\nbook\nTrading\nbook\nTotal sam-\nple\nNon-\ntrading\nbook\nTrading\nbook\nTotal sam-\nple\nNon-\ntrading\nbook\nTrading\nbook\nBanking group dummies YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES\nDependent variable: modified duration gap.

(1993) and Froot and Stein (1998), that the potential distress cost\nleads banks to take less IRR. Again, this effect is most pronounced for trading book\ninstitutions. A one sd change in the PD decreases the modified duration gap by 0.04\nsd for non-trading book banks, and by 0.13 sd for trading book institutions. As trading\nbook institutions receive more of their funding from capital markets and arms-length\nrelationships in interbank markets, whereas the majority of pure banking book institutions\nreceive interbank loans from their associated head institutions (Ehrmann and Worms,\n2004), the coefficients found might reflect the effect of risk taking on the cost of external\nfinance, as documented by Brewer et al. (1996).\nSize leads pure banking book institutions to take more, but trading book institutions\nto take less IRR on the balance sheet. Business opportunities show the expected negative\neffect, as predicted by Froot et al. (1993) and Froot and Stein (1998), only for pure\nbanking book institutions. For trading book financial intermediaries the opposite holds,\nalthough the coefficients are only significant in the pooled OLS setting. Both, asset and\nfunding liquidity induce banks to engage in less maturity transformation. This finding\nis not surprising for liquid assets as a substantial portion of these assets have a short-\nterm maturity that reduces the modified duration gap. For savings deposits the finding is,\nhowever, surprising as the short-term funding nature of deposits leads to a higher duration\ngap per se. On the other hand, many small regional banks with strong deposit funding\nlack business opportunities and hold proportionally large liquidity buffers, often deposited\nvia interbank loans at their head institutions. The results of all coefficients presented so\nfar are consistent with those found by Purnanandam (2007) in cross-sectional regressions\nwhere Fama-MacBeth estimators have been applied. More concentrated and therefore\nless competitive markets lead to more on-balance-sheet interest rate risk taking.\nThe coefficients for Customer loans and Loan commitments are positive and significant\nat the 1% level in all regressions. Banks with a higher share of customer loan volume\nindeed have a higher duration gap as already documented by Ehrmann and Worms (2004).\nThe positive coefficient for the ratio of loan commitments confirms the results of Berger\net al. (2005) that banks use loan commitments to gather information on borrower quality\nand finally to offer loans with longer maturity. The significance levels serve as upfront\nindicators of instrument relevance in the swap use regressions presented in Section 6.2.\nThe first-stage instrumentation process of Interest rate swap use -- which has been\ncarried out for simplicity as a linear probability model -- proves instrument relevance.15\nPast swap experience and the average board experience have high explanatory power\nfor the interest rate swap use dummy. The F-statistics are always larger than 10 and\nalso exceed the Stock and Yogo (2005) threshold of 19.93 for the Cragg-Donald statis-\ntics for a 10% maximal size distortion calculated under homoscedastic standard errors.\nOveridentification tests under the joint null that the model is correctly specified and that\ninstruments are exogenous cannot be rejected at a 10% level. Interestingly, the endo-\ngeneity test statistics show that the null of interest rate swap use being exogenous to the\nmagnitude of the maturity gap cannot be rejected at levels always above a p-value of 25%\nfor all three samples. Hence, the results derived are quite similar to pooled OLS models\n15Using fitted values from a first-stage probit model as instruments -- as described in Wooldridge\n(2010) -- does not change the results qualitatively. This holds for all other regression models, both\ncross-sectional and time-series. However, this approach would not allow a test for overidentification.\nthat take the decision to employ interest rate swaps as exogenous.\nIn this Section, we investigate the time-series behavior of the modified duration gap and\npresent the results in Table 7. The use of panel data allows us to include macroeconomic\nvariables which we can use to prove market timing behavior in on-balance-sheet IRR ex-\nposure. Our standard model (Panel A) includes time dummies to control for the potential\nimpact of several macroeconomic indicators. Compared to the cross-sectional model, the\ntime-series model has significantly lower explanatory power based on the coefficient of\ndetermination R2. The variables included are therefore better able to distinguish cross-\nsectional differences between banks than to explain the adjustment of the duration gap\nover time.\nIn the baseline model, we find the coefficients for the Interest rate swap use to be\ninsignificant, except for the sub-group of banks that changed their status of swap use at\nleast once, which we refer to as \"starters\". Most of these banks started hedging during\nthe sample period and therefore changed from non-users to users at least once. For this\nsub-sample we find a structural parameter of 0.15, corresponding to a 0.24 sd increase of\nthe duration gap when a bank switches from being a non-user to a user, and significant\nat the 1% level. As the majority of banks, around two-thirds, do not change their swap\nuse status once during the sample period, and either never use swaps or do so in all years,\ntoo little intertemporal variation exists for the fixed effects estimator to deliver significant\nresults in the other three samples.\nFor the other explanatory variables, we find the same coefficient signs in the time-\nseries models as in the cross-sectional models. The only exemption is Size, which now\nhas significantly negative coefficients. Hence, as banks become larger, they decrease their\non-balance-sheet exposure resulting from term transformation. One explanation is that\nbigger banks start engaging in other business lines that generate fee and trading income.\nThe significance of loan commitments decreases in the trading book sample, but is still\nsignificant at the 10% level. The effect of competition shows ambiguous results. Whereas\ndecreasing competition induces non-trading book institutions to take on less risk, the\nopposite holds for trading book banks.\nThe macroeconomic variables confirm the results from previous analysis. Banks in-\ncrease their duration gap when the yield curve becomes steeper and maturity transfor-\nmation becomes more profitable. Similar results were found by Purnanandam (2007) and\nMemmel and Schertler (2014). As the level of the short-term 1-year government yield is\nhighly collinear to the slope of the yield curve, we do not include it as an extra variable\nbut create an interaction term with the slope instead. These interaction terms are signifi-\ncantly negative and confirm theories related to the risk-taking channel of monetary policy\n(Borio and Zhu, 2012). Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2014) find that short-term instead of long-term\nrates matter for banks' risk taking. During times of high short-term rates, when short-\nterm lending funded with deposits that pay less than market rates is also profitable, banks\nengage in less maturity transformation (Panel B). Interestingly, banks decrease their du-\nration gap in times of uncertainty in interbank markets, measured by a higher spread of\nthe 1-year EURIBOR over the 1-year government rate (Panel C and D). However, when\ninterbank uncertainty arises contemporaneously with a steep yield curve, banks decrease\nTable 6: Maturity Gap - Simultaneous Cross-Sectional Models\nBetween effects Pooled OLS\nTotal sample Non-trading\nbook\nTrading book Total sample Non-trading\nbook\nTrading book\nTime dummies NO NO NO YES YES YES\nBanking group dummies YES YES YES YES YES YES\nDependent variable: modified duration gap.

The endogeneity tests of interest\nrate swap use cannot be rejected at a 10% level for the total, the non-trading book and the\ntrading book sample, -- as for the cross-sectional regression models -- but exogeneity is\nrejected for the sample of starters. However, this finding depends on the macroeconomic\ncovariates included and does not hold for Panel B where the yield curve slope and its\nintercation with the 1-year interest rate are included.\n6.2 Interest Rate Swap Use Decision\nIn this section we analyze the determinants of the use of interest rate swaps by applying\npooled probit models into which we include macroeconomic variables. The results are\npresented in Table 8. Again, the baseline model in Panel A includes time dummies,\nwhereas the other model specifications use the same sets of macroeconomic variables as\nin the time-series setting of the duration gap analysis.\nMaturity gap has the expected positive coefficients, always significant at the 1% level.\nPure banking book institutions show a three to four times higher sensitivity to on-balance-\nsheet IRR than trading book institutions. In the baseline model the presented structural\ncoefficients translate into an increase in the propensity to use interest rate swaps by 46%,\n60%, 25%, and 28% given a 1 sd increase for the overall sample, pure banking book\ninstitutions, trading book banks, and starters, respectively. Therefore, the underlying\non-balance IRR is a driver of high economic magnitude for the decision to use interest\nrate swaps.\nThe sign of the coefficient of the PD provides evidence for the predictions of risk\nmanagement theory (Froot et al., 1993; Froot and Stein, 1998). The higher the default\nrisk and the associated cost of bankruptcy, the higher the propensity to use interest rate\nswaps. Again, the sensitivity of trading book financial intermediaries, which are more\nlikely to depend on their credit rating in interbank and capital markets, is higher in\nmagnitude. The coefficient of 0.095 in the baseline model of Panel A corresponds to a\n23% higher propensity to employ interest rate swaps given a one sd increase in the log\nof the PD. However, these banks might use interest rate swaps, at least partly, also for\nspeculation purposes. Also for banks, we find the empirically well-documented effect that\nlarger entities are more likely to use OBS derivatives. This is most likely due to economies\nof scale in establishing risk management departments that are proficient enough to use\ninterest rate swaps.\nSo far, all our results are consistent with those of Purnanandam (2007). The major\ndifference are the coefficients related to bank liquidity measures, for which Purnanandam\nTable 7: Maturity Gap - Simultaneous Time-Series Models\nTotal sample Non-trading\nbook\nTrading book Starters Total sample Non-trading\nbook\nTrading book Starters\nPanel A Panel B\ncontinued on next page\nTable 7 continued: Maturity Gap - Simultaneous Time-Series Models\nTotal sample Non-trading\nbook\nTrading book Starters Total sample Non-trading\nbook\nTrading book Starters\nPanel C Panel D\nDependent variable: modified duration gap.

GR2 is the\nadjusted generalised (within) R2 of Pesaran and Smith (1994).\nfinds significantly negative relationships. We find that savings deposits have no impact\non the interest rate swap use decision. The buffer stock of liquid assets is found to be in-\nsignificant for trading book institutions, but significantly negative for pure banking book\nintermediaries. This indicates that these banks consider liquid assets to be a complemen-\ntary hedging tool, whereas risk management theory stresses the substitutionary relation\n(e.g., Bolton et al., 2011). One potential explanation for this finding lies in the role\nthat liquidity buffers have in the theory of intertemporal smoothing of non-diversifiable\nliquidity and interest rate risk (Allen and Gale, 1997).\nCompetition is not found to have an effect on banks' likelihood to use swaps, although\ntheory would have suggested so (Adam et al., 2007). Zhu (2011) finds significant effects\nfrom hedging on competition and vice versa. However, she investigates unregulated in-\ndustries' commodity price hedging. In the regulated banking industry, competition has\nno effect on the decision to use swaps after controlling for all the other determinants that\naffect interest rate risk taking.\nPast swap experience has the expected positive sign and coefficients are far above 1,\nsignificant at the 1% level in all samples and regression setups. Average board experience,\non the other hand, reduces the likelihood of using interest rate swaps and is always\nconveniently significant at 5%. The negative effects are most pronounced for trading\nbook institutions. These results contradict those found in the literature hitherto. Zhu\n(2012) finds that younger and therefore less experienced CEOs are less likely to use OBS\nhedging. Our results suggest that experience does not seem to be an indicator for risk\naversion.\nThe macroeconomic variables serve as indicators of market timing in hedging deci-\nsions. Pure banking book institutions are less likely to use swaps when the yield curve is\nsteep (Panel B). As non-trading book banks can use interest rate swaps only for hedging\npurposes, they hedge less of their floating-rate debt exposure in times when corporates\nalso hedge less (Faulkender, 2005; Vickery, 2008). For trading book banks, we find in-\nsignificant or significantly positive relationships. Here, it has to be taken into account\nthat these banks can use interest rate swaps for speculation on the yield curve and pos-\nitive coefficients can indicate increasing off-balance-sheet IRR exposure. The interaction\nterm with the 1-year yield is significantly negative for all samples (Panel B).16 Interbank\nfunding uncertainty increases banks' likelihood of using interest rate swaps (Panel C and\nD). Interestingly, both the overall and aggregate sectoral -- calculated separately for sav-\nings, cooperative, and private banks -- interest rate swap use quotas are highly correlated\nwith the EURIBOR spread. Hence, funding uncertainty seems to be a major driver of the\nswap use decision on an industry level. This is further evidence for the dynamic risk man-\nagement theories that incorporate liquidity issues into hedging decisions. Furthermore,\nour finding is supported by the increasing use of overnight index swaps in the banking\nindustry. Again, when uncertainty is accompanied by a steep yield curve making term\ntransformation profitable, the effect of the EURIBOR spread becomes smaller (Panel D).\nCustomer loans and loan commitments are relevant instruments with Kleibergen-Paap\nF-statistics always above 10 and, again, also always above the size distortion threshold\n16It should be noted that the elasticities of interacted variables in probit models should be interpreted\nwith caution as the correction proposed by Ai and Norton (2003) has not been applied. However, we\nderive similar coefficients in magnitude for the interacted and all other variables from linear probability\nmodels (LPM).\nof 19.93 reported by Stock and Yogo (2005) in the case of homoscedastic standard errors.\nInstrument validity is supported using overidentification tests that are insignificant at a\n10% level for all samples being estimated. The exogeneity tests of Smith and Blundell\n(1986) only cannot be rejected at a 10% level for the sample of trading book institutions.\nThis indicates that the maturity gap seems to be an exogenous driver of their decision\nto hold swaps, but exogeneity is rejected for all other samples, including the sub-samples\nof non-trading book banks and starters. However, for the starter sample the test statisic\ndepends on the macroeconomic covariates included and decreases when the EURIBOR\nspread is included. For Panels C and D exogeneity can only be rejected at 9% and 7.3%\nlevel which is not too far from the 10% threshold usually employed.\n6.3 Extent of Interest Rate Swap Use\n6.3.1 Cross-Sectional Variation\nTable 9 shows the cross-sectional results of the extent of interest rate swaps for between\neffects and a pooled specification. For trading book banks, only three variables are found\nto be significant. These are the PD, which increases the extent of interest rate swap\nuse, Size, which also has a significantly positive impact, and the Past swap experience.\nAlthough only three variables are significant, the R-squares are higher for the trading book\nbank samples than for the pure banking book institution samples. As the cross-sectional\nestimators should explain constant extent of swap use, whereas we cannot distinguish\nwhether interest rate swaps are used for speculation or hedging purposes, the assumptions\nunderlying the estimators may be violated. The results for the trading book sub-sample\nshould therefore be interpreted with caution.\nFor the sample of pure banking book institutions, we find results in line with those\nPurnanandam (2007) obtained when he investigated interest derivatives for hedging pur-\nposes. Banks with higher duration gaps hold significantly more interest rate swaps, and\nbanks with a higher cost of distress also increase their swap use to hedge IRR, consistent\nwith the implications for the risk management behavior of unconstrained firms in cor-\nporate finance theory. As for trading book banks, Size also shows significantly positive\ncoefficients.\nLiquidity endowments, in general, reduce the volume of swaps held. This is consistent\nwith the predictions of modern dynamic risk management theory, where cash is considered\na substitute for hedging activities (e.g., Bolton et al., 2011). Savings deposits as an\nindicator of stable funding sources significantly reduce the extent of interest rate swap\nuse. The same holds for the buffer of liquid assets, however, only when a between estimator\nis used. Again, competition has no influence on the extent of interest rate swap use in\na regulated industry. Controlling for sample selection bias is only necessary for the pure\nbanking book sample and the total sample, but not for the trading book sample.17\nAgain, for the pooled models, Kleibergen-Paap statistics for weak instruments are\nalways clearly above 10 and also above the threshold of 19.93 calculated for the Cragg-\nDonald statistic for a maximum size distortion of 10%. Hence, customer loans and loan\n17The reduction of sample size conditional on using swaps is most substantial for non-trading book\ninstitutions, while the observations in the trading book sample drop only slightly. Observations decrease\nby more than two-thirds in the pure banking book sample from 17,166 to 5,725, whereas the reduction\nTable 8: Interest Rate Swap Use Decision - Simultaneous Pooled Models\nTotal sample Non-trading\nbook\nTrading book Starters Total sample Non-trading\nbook\nTrading book Starters\nPanel A Panel B\ncontinued on next page\nTable 8 continued: Interest Rate Swap Use Decision - Simultaneous Pooled Models\nTotal sample Non-trading\nbook\nTrading book Starters Total sample Non-trading\nbook\nTrading book Starters\nPanel C Panel D\nTime dummies NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO\nBanking group dummies YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES\nDependent variable: dummy interest rate swap use.

Instrument validity is supported by overidentification tests\nwhich all fail to reject the null with p-values conveniantely above 50%. The endogeneity\ntests reject the null of exogeneity of the modified duration gap for all three samples\nclearly. Thus, the modified duration gap is indeed an endogenous determinant of the\nnominal volume of interest rate swaps held by German universal banks.\nIn a time-series setting -- results are presented in Table 10 -- the duration gap has a\npositive and even larger impact on the extent of interest rate swap use than in the cross-\nsectional settings. To address problems of unobserved heterogeneity, endogeneity, and\nsample selection, we estimate these models following Semykina and Wooldridge (2010).\nIn the baseline model, a one sd increase in the duration gap leads to a rise in the extent\nbook, the trading book and the starter sample, respectively. None of these coefficients\ncan statistically be distinguished from 1. This might be an indicator that German banks\ntry indeed to keep their hedge ratios constant over time in relation to their on-balance\nIRR. In contrast to the cross-sectional regressions, we do not find a significant influence\nof the probability of default in any of the regressions run on the extent of swap use.\nHowever, it should be kept in mind, that the strength of hidden liabilities in the hazard\nrate model did not fully match the requirements of being a strong instrument. Also,\nliquid asset endowments as well as savings deposits are found to be insignificant. These\nresults stand in contrast to our cross-sectional findings and also to the time-series models\nof Purnanandam (2007), who finds a significantly negative impact for both variables. Size\nhas a significantly positive impact on the extent of interest rate swap use and is larger\nthan in the cross-sectional regressions.\nKleibergen-Paap weak instrument statistics are even in the smallest cases close to 15,\nand hence customer loans and loan commitments are strong instruments for the maturity\ngap in the time-series sample selection setting. Hansen-J tests support the exclusion\nrestrictions as the null of instrument validity cannot be rejected conveniently at a 25%\nlevel. The endogeneity tests reject the null of the maturity gap being exogenous for all\nsamples, as in the cross-sectional regressions.\n6.4 Summary of Results from the Simultaneous Equations\n6.4.1 Simultaneous Risk Management\nFor banks in the non-trading book sample, we find that more restrictive on-balance-sheet\nIRR management -- resulting in lower maturity gaps and an intensified use of interest\nrate swaps -- are substitute strategies. The coefficients derived for the probability of\ndefault largely provide an empirical support for the behavior of unconstrained firms in\ntheoretical corporate finance risk management models. However, the proxy for profitable\ngrowth opportunities -- the growth rate of total assets -- is mostly insignificant. In\nrobustness checks, this also holds for the growth rate of customer loans, and total loans,\nand if we choose real instead of nominal growth rates by deflating monetary volumes. The\nmarket timing behavior we find for the slope of the yield curve is in line with the results\nTable 9: Extent of Interest Rate Swap Use - Simultaneous Cross-Sectional Models\nBetween effects Pooled OLS\nTotal sample Non-trading\nbook\nTrading book Total sample Non-trading\nbook\nTrading book\nTime dummies NO NO NO YES YES YES\nBanking group dummies YES YES YES YES YES YES\nDependent variable: extent of interest rate swap use.

As the results for\nthe cross-sectional and the time-series regressions do not differ, no differentiation is made.\nWe also display only the results for the total sample and the sample of banks starting to\nuse interest rate swaps for the first time, and for trading book banks for the swap use\ndecisions.\nThe decision to use interest rate swaps is only endogenous to the maturity gap for the\nsub-sample of banks that start hedging during the sample period. For all other banks,\nincluding the total sample which is dominated by banks that either use interest rate swaps\nin all years or do not use them in any year, the decision is exogenous. The duration gap\nis an endogenous determinant of the decision to use interest rate swaps even for starters.\nIt is only for trading book institutions that exogeneity cannot be rejected. With regard\nto the extent of interest rate swaps held conditional on a positive decision to use interest\nrate swaps at all, the maturity gap is always endogenous.\nWe interpret the results as follows. The decision to use interest rate swaps and the ex-\ntent of their use seem mainly driven by the contemporaneous IRR regulation in Germany,\nwhereas the maturity gap seems to be largely determined by borrower and lender liquidity\npreferences. Banks that face the decision to newly start employing interest rate swaps are\nlikely to have a maturity gap close to the threshold of being considered an \"outlier\" bank\nby the regulator. \"Outliers\" lose more than 20% of their regulatory equity in a simulated\n130 basis point parallel upward shift of the yield curve.18 Starters face the decision of pay-\ning the one-time initial cost of establishing a derivatives hedging department, becoming\nan \"outlier\" bank that exceeds the regulatory threshold19 or, alternatively, rejecting the\nloan maturity borrowers demand. In contrast, banks whose exposure is far away from the\nthreshold or those whose exposure is above the threshold but which have already initiated\nan OBS risk management desk in order to comply with the IRR regulation can offer any\n18The IRR regulation was revised in the fourth quarter of 2011. The relevant interest rate shock has\nbeen increased to 200 basis points and banks are no longer referred to as \"outliers\" but as institutions with\n\"elevated interest rate risk\". For more details of the IRR regulation, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2012).\nExcluding observations from the end of 2011, when the new regulatory framework became effective, does\nnot change our results.\n19Banks decrease overall IRR exposure drastically after having been classified as an \"outlier\" (Memmel,\nloan maturity borrowers demand and accept all volumes of short-term deposits. Hence,\nonly for starters the decision to use interest rate swaps is endogenous to the maturity gap.\nThe IRR regulation in Germany can also explain the more pronounced use of interest\nrate derivatives in Germany compared to the U.S., although the intertemporal smoothing\ntheory of Allen and Gale (1997) predicts a higher propensity of derivative use for the U.S.\nGerman universal banks seem to use interest rate swaps predominantly for compliance\nwith the IRR regulation and not to manage liquidity risk.20\nWe additionally account the finding that the interest swap use dummy is exogenous\nfor most samples to the fact that German banks' maturity mismatch is largely deter-\nmined by customers' liquidity needs. Research on borrowers' preferences reveals that\nloan size is most sensitive to the maturity being offered, whereas interest rate sensitivity\nis less pronounced. These findings are interpreted as the existence of binding borrower\nliquidity constraints (e.g., Karlan and Zinman, 2008; Attanasio, Koujianou Goldberg,\nand Kyriazidou, 2008). Germany's legal and institutional environment provides banks\nwith incentives to supply borrowers with long-term liquidity if demanded. In the German\nbank-dominated financial system only few large corporates have access to equity and debt\ncapital markets, whereas the majority of Germany's small and medium-sized enterprises,\nknown as the \"Mittelstand\", depend completely on banks with which they most often\nhave longstanding relationships. Additionally households have most of their savings as\ndeposits with banks (e.g., Allen and Santomero, 2001).\nMajor determinants of the loan maturity being granted by a bank are the degrees of\ninformation asymmetry and moral hazard that are inherent to the borrower relationship.\nWays to mitigate the maturity-reducing impact of the aforementioned factors are pledging\ncollateral and relationship lending. The German \"Hausbank\" principle is one of the\nstrongest forms of relationship lending. Additionally, most often commercial property or\nreal estate is pledged as collateral and valued quite conservatively. Therefore, German\nbanks are likely to offer the same long-term loans as banks in the U.K., although Germany\noffers less favorable creditor rights (Davydenko and Franks, 2008; Qian and Strahan,\n2007). The property rights prevailing in Germany are among the most friendly what\nadditionally facilitates granting long-term loans (Bae and Goyal, 2009). To sum up, the\nGerman legal and institutional environment helps to reduce moral hazard, and therefore\nbanks seem to be able and willing to offer their lenders the maturities they demand.\nGiven this setting, it appears plausible that the decision to use swaps is exogenous to\nthe maturity gap, except for those banks that face the decision to set up a derivatives\ndepartment for the first time. Banks at the \"outlier\" threshold which decide to manage\nIRR solely on the balance sheet are likely to use their interbank lending and borrowing\nto adjust their maturity gap endogenously (Ehrmann and Worms, 2004).\nOur findings thus indicate that banks use interest rate swaps predominantly for hedg-\ning purposes in compliance with IRR regulation. Pure banking book institutions seem\nat first to choose the magnitude of their maturity gap based on liquidity demand. Af-\nterwards, they decide on the extent of swaps that is necessary in order not to exceed the\n\"outlier\" threshold. With regard to the set-up of our simultaneous equation framework,\n20We are not aware of a similar \"outlier\" threshold with regard to a potential equity loss in the Economic\nValue Model applied by the Federal Reserve to investigate U.S. commercial banks' IRR, although a 200\nbasis point shift in the yield curve is also simulated. The threshold seems more likely to be one comparing\nbanks relative IRR (Houpt and Embersit, 1991) than an absolute one.\nwe summarize that the decision to use swaps and the maturity gap do not necessarily\nhave to be estimated simultaneously, except for banks that start using derivatives for the\nfirst time.\n7 Conclusion\nModeling German universal banks' IRR management as the simultaneous choice of on-\nbalance-sheet maturity gap management and OBS interest rate swap use, we find that\nboth decisions serve as substitutes for one another. The effect of bankruptcy risk on\nrisk management decisions is consistent with the predictions of corporate finance models\nfor financially unconstrained firms. Being faced with a higher default likelihood makes\nbanks pursue more conservative on-balance-sheet portfolio management with less maturity\nmismatch, and increases their propensity to hedge on-balance-sheet risk with interest rate\nswaps.\nOur empirical findings are largely in line with those of Purnanandam (2007) who\ninvestigates IRR management for U.S. commercial banks. One major exemption is the\neffect that liquid assets have on the use of interest rate derivatives. U.S. banks manage\nbuffer stocks of liquid assets as substitutes to OBS hedging in line with the theoretical\nimpact predicted by dynamic risk management theories. German universal banks, on\nthe other hand, consider liquidity buffers complementary risk management strategies to\nthe decision to hold interest rate swaps. Once banks decide to employ interest rate\nswaps, the extent of their use serves as a substitute for liquid assets. The differences\nin managing liquidity and interest rate risk on the balance sheet or off the balance sheet\nhave been stressed by Allen and Santomero (2001) based on the theoretical model of Allen\nand Gale (1997). U.S. banks are more likely to manage risks using derivative hedging,\nwhereas German banks can rely more heavily on on-balance-sheet risk management due\nto intertemporal smoothing.\nThe reason why we nevertheless observe more banks in Germany using OBS risk man-\nagement instruments than in the U.S., is the outcome of the IRR regulation in Germany.\nExogeneity tests on the endogenous regressors in the simultaneous equations suggest that\nswap use is exogenous to the magnitude of the duration gap. Hence, banks seem first\nto decide on their duration gap, which is driven by the liquidity preferences of their cus-\ntomers. Afterwards, they make their decisions on using interest rate swaps. This holds\nfor all banks, except for banks that start using interest rate swaps for the first time. Only\nthese banks simultaneously decide on their maturity mismatch and the use of interest rate\nswaps.\nWe find market timing behavior in IRR management in samples of banks that are\nby law prohibited from engaging in substantial OBS speculation. Our results show that\nbanks are willing to take more IRR when a steep yield curve makes maturity transfor-\nmation profitable. Funding uncertainty in the interbank markets urges banks to reduce\non-balance-sheet risk by means of derivatives hedging. High levels of short-term nominal\ninterest rates induce banks to further reduce IRR exposure. This finding is consistent\nwith the risk-taking channel of monetary policy. Including macroeconomic variables does\nnot change the relationship between on-balance exposure and interest swap use decisions,\nand therefore the speculative element in market timing appears minor compared to the\ndominant effect that on-balance and off-balance IRR management serve as substitutes.\nOur research has strong implications for banking supervisory authorities as the design\nof IRR regulation has a major impact on banks' decision to hedge on-balance-sheet risk\nwith OBS derivatives. As OBS derivatives only allow for trading the interest rate but not\n(fully) the liquidity risk, there is room for future research to investigate how a combined\ninterest rate and liquidity risk regulation, as proposed by Basel III, with the Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio, will affect banks' portfolio structures.\nFor banks in market-based and bank-based financial systems which both adopt Basel III,\nit will be interesting to observe whether the theoretical predictions from Allen and Gale's\nmodel on the relation between liquid assets and OBS risk management still holds after\nliquidity risk becomes more heavily regulated.\nAppendix A Variable Description\nTable 12 gives an overview of the variables used in the hazard rate model and the interest\nrate risk management analysis and how these variables were calculated.\nAppendix B Modified Duration Gap\nTime-to-maturity is defined either as the remaining time-to-maturity or as the time re-\nmaining until the next repricing. The modified duration gap is calculated by first assign-\ning the modified durations of the standard BaFin approach to the maturity brackets, and\nthen summing up the volume-weighted assets' and liabilities' time-to-maturity brackets.\nThe modified duration gap can then be calculated from the modified asset and liability\nduration by\nDgap\n= DA\nmod\n- DL\nmod\ntotal interest-earning liabilities\ntotal interest-paying assets\n,\nwhere total interest-bearing assets (liabilities) is the sum of business volume reported\nin the time-to-maturity brackets. Information on assets' remaining time to maturity is\navailable for loans to banks and non-banks. For liabilities' remaining time to maturity in\naddition to loans from banks and non-banks, are also available for savings accounts and\nbonds issued. For each of these categories, four maturity brackets have been collected\nranging from three months or less, more than three months up to one year, more than a\nyear up to five years, and finally, more than five years. The modified duration assigned to\noutliers, we drop all banks that report negative volumes in any of the time-to-maturity\nbrackets. Additionally, we require that three out of the four brackets reported for loans\nto and from non-banks have non-zero volume.\nTable 12: Variable Description\nHazard rate model\nTier 1 capital ratio Tier 1 capital to total assets\nTotal bank reserves Total reserves that qualify as equity to total assets\nDummy reserve reduction Dummy taking the value 1 if any reserve included in Total bank reserves has\nbeen reduced\nSector HHI Herfindahl index of credit portfolio concentration over 14 industry sectors\nDummy hidden liabilities Dummy taking the value 1 if the bank avoided writing off assets\nROE Return on equity calculated as operating income to equity\nBranch HHI Herfindahl index of bank branches per county averaged over all counties in\nwhich a bank runs branches\nDummy savings banks Dummy taking the value 1 if the bank is a savings bank\nDummy cooperative banks Dummy taking the value 1 if the bank is a cooperative bank\nEURIBOR 3 month EURIBOR (Euro interbank offered rate)\nRegional GDP growth Real GDP growth at the state level\nIRR management model\nDependent variables:\nModified duration gap Calculated according to Appendix B\nDummy interest rate swap use Dummy taking the value 1 if the bank has non-zero volume of interest rate\nswaps\nExtent of interest rate swap use ln of the nominal volume of interest rate swaps\nExplanatory variables:\nProbability of default (ln) ln of the probability of default derived from the hazard rate model\nSize ln of total assets\nSavings deposits Savings deposits to total assets\nLiquid assets Cash and securities to total assets\nTotal asset growth Annual growth rate of total assets\nDummy trading book Dummy that takes the value 1 if a bank is qualified as a trading book bank\naccording to the German Banking Act (KWG)\nInverse Mills ratio Inverse Mills ratio is calculated according to Wooldridge (2010) in cross-\nsectional and according to Semykina and Wooldridge (2010) in time-series\nmodels\nCustomer loans Sum of all non-bank loans to total assets\nLoan commitments Loan commitments, excluding those for investment expenditure and real es-\ntate, to total assets\nPast swap experience Dummy that takes the value of 1 when a bank used either interest or currency\nswaps once in previous years since 1998.
