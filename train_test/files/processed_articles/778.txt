    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: As Congress considers introducing a drug benefit for Medicare, it will more\nthan likely adopt a program that uses a formulary. We examined data from the Community\nTracking Study Physicians Survey, a large, nationally representative study of physicians, to\nlearn about physicians' views of formularies. Our results suggest that several aspects of for-\nmularies are associated with physicians' positive views about them. Policymakers should\nconsider imposing limits on the number of competing Medicare formularies operating in a\nparticular area, promoting the adoption and use of information technology, and incorporat-\ning financial incentives for physicians to adhere to formularies.\nEvidence suggests that lack of drug coverage is an extremely\nimportant issue for elderly Americans, particularly for the projected 27\u00ad35\npercent of Medicare beneficiaries who lack any drug coverage.1 Nine out of\nten beneficiaries fill at least one prescription per year, and average annual\nspent almost twice as much out of pocket on prescription drugs as those with cov-\nerage spent, although their total spending was 45 percent less.2 Those without in-\nsurance coverage have also been shown to fill fewer prescriptions and to spend a\nhigh percentage of their disposable income on pharmaceuticals. Consequently,\nmany seniors are not filling prescriptions or are skipping doses to help soften the\neconomic impact and extend their prescriptions.3\nAs Congress considers introducing a Medicare drug benefit, it will more than\nlikely adopt a program that uses a formulary to help control costs and use. Al-\nthough they differ greatly in their reliance on the private sector, bills passed by\nboth the House and the Senate, as well as other bills proposed by Democrats and\nD a t a W a t c h\nBruceLandonisanassistantprofessorofhealthcarepolicyatHarvardMedicalSchoolandanassistantprofessor\nofmedicineatBethIsraelDeaconessMedicalCenter.JamesReschovskyisaseniorhealthresearcherattheCenter\nforStudyingHealthSystemChangeinWashington,D.C.DavidBlumenthalisdirectoroftheInstituteforHealth\nPolicyandaphysicianatMassachusettsGeneralHospital/PartnersHealthCareSysteminBoston.Heisalsoa\nprofessorofmedicineandhealthcarepolicyatHarvardMedicalSchool.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Formularies are\ncommonplace in the commercially insured population and typically tied to a set of\nadministrative or financial mechanisms that are designed to promote adherence to\nthe formulary by physicians and patients.4 These mechanisms typically include re-\nstricting access to certain drugs, selecting preferred drugs, requiring preapproval,\nor classifying drugs into different tiers, so that consumers are responsible for in-\ncreasing copayments for more expensive therapeutically equivalent medications\nor ones for which the coverage plan could not negotiate discounts. Closed formu-\nlaries restrict coverage to drugs on the formulary, while open formularies cover\nnonformulary drugs but often with higher consumer payments.\nBecause of such restrictions, many are concerned that drug formularies could\nbe harmful to vulnerable seniors.5 In addition, formularies introduce an additional\nlayer of complexity that could be difficult for the vulnerable elderly to negotiate.\nFor instance, some patients might not know when they could request an alterna-\ntive drug if faced with a higher-tier copayment.\nOne voice missing in the debate about formularies is that of physicians. En-\nacting a Medicare drug benefit that incorporates formularies will greatly expand\nphysicians' exposure to them. Nearly two-thirds of physicians obtain one-fourth\nor more of their practice revenue from Medicare.6 Although a majority of Medicare\npatients have drug coverage from a previous employer, a Medigap policy, or a\nMedicare+Choice (M+C) health plan, a sizable minority has no such coverage.\nConsequently, the use of formularies for Medicare beneficiaries as a whole is likely\nto be lower than for other privately or publicly insured patients.\nThere are few systematic data on physicians' views of formularies. To fill this\ngap, we used data from the Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physicians Survey\nto inform this issue. We had three primary questions. First, how prevalent are for-\nmularies, and what types of physicians have the greatest exposure to them? Sec-\nond, how might a Medicare drug benefit that includes formularies increase physi-\ncians' exposure to them? Third, what are physicians' views on the usefulness of\nformularies, and what factors influence these assessments? We conclude by draw-\ning lessons for the implementation of a Medicare prescription drug benefit that\nuses formularies.\nn Data source. The data for this study are from the third round of the CTS Phy-\nsician Survey, a nationally representative telephone survey of 12,406 direct patient\nter for Studying Health System Change. The survey sample, the largest in recent his-\ntory, was designed to be representative of direct patient care physicians in the conti-\nnental United States, as well as in selected communities or sites.7 The overall survey\nresponse rate was 59 percent. All analyses are weighted to account for survey design\nand survey nonresponse.\nP h y s i c i a n s & F o r m u l a r i e s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 3 , N u m b e r 1 2 1 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Nine percent were unable to an-\nswer this. These cases were imputed using a weighted sequential, hot-deck proce-\ndure. Other key variables on attitudes toward formularies and use of relevant\ninformation technology had very low item nonresponse, well below 1 percent.\nStudy Findings\nn Exposure to formularies. Overall, physicians reported that an average of 57\npercent of their patients had insurance coverage that included the use of formular-\nies, and more than two-thirds reported that half or more of their patients had such\ncoverage (Exhibit 1). Only 2 percent of physicians reported having no patients sub-\nject to formularies.\nExposure to formularies declined as the age of the physician rose and was\ngreater for female physicians than for male physicians. The proportion of patients\ncovered by formularies was higher for primary care physicians, particularly pedia-\ntricians, as compared with specialists. Physicians in medical school\u00ad and hospi-\ntal-based practices had slightly higher percentages of patients with formularies\nthan those in groups and solo or two-physician practices. Physicians practicing in\ngroup or staff-model health maintenance organizations (HMOs) on average re-\nported that 87 percent of their patients had formulary coverage, far higher than\nphysicians in all other practice settings.\nInvolvement with managed care. Not surprisingly, exposure to patients with formu-\nlaries is positively associated with the physician's exposure to managed care. To\nanalyze this relationship, we divided the sample of physicians into thirds, based\non the percentage of their practice's revenue from managed care. Those with the\nhighest managed care involvement reported that 71 percent of their patients had\nformularies, compared with 45 percent of those with the lowest involvement (Ex-\nhibit 1). We similarly divided the sample into three groups according to the per-\ncentage of practice revenue that is capitated. This shows a similar positive rela-\ntionship with involvement with formularies, although not as strong.\nFormulariesandMedicare. Physicians whose practices receive a majority of revenue\nfrom Medicare reported that 50.7 percent of their patients have formularies, com-\npared with 62.1 percent for those physicians with less than 25 percent of practice\nrevenue from Medicare (p < .01). This suggests that a Medicare drug benefit is\nlikely to greatly expand physicians' exposure to formularies. Medical and surgical\nspecialists as well as physicians with low managed care involvement would be\nmost affected by a Medicare drug benefit that involves formularies. These physi-\ncians are more likely to have both low exposure to formularies and a large depend-\nence on revenue from Medicare.\nn Formularies' effect on medical care. Overall, nearly half of all physicians in-\ndicated that they thought formularies had a negative effect on the quality and effi-\nciency of medical care (Exhibit 2). In contrast, only 13.4 percent thought that formu-\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

These ratings varied considerably with both physicians'\npersonal characteristics and the characteristics of their practices. We also con-\nducted multivariate analyses of the likelihood of giving a positive or negative assess-\nment of formularies. The multivariate results closely mirrored the trends evident in\nthe bivariate results, so we do not report them here.8\nPersonal characteristics and medical specialty. Somewhat surprisingly, physicians age\nfifty-five and older were more likely than those younger than age forty-five to give\npositive ratings. In addition, physicians in various specialties had differing atti-\ntudes toward formularies. Medical and surgical specialists were more likely than\nother physicians to have neutral attitudes toward formularies. In contrast, inter-\nnists and those in general or family practice were least likely to be neutral and\nmost likely to express both positive and negative feelings. Graduates of foreign\nmedical schools were much more likely than U.S. medical graduates to rate formu-\nlaries positively.\nPractice setting. Practice setting was strongly related to ratings of formularies.\nJust 12.4 percent of physicians in solo or two-physician practices and 8.9 percent\nin group practices rated formularies as positive, compared with 39 percent of phy-\nsicians practicing in group/staff-model HMOs. Because the latter typically deal\nwith patients from only their own health plan, they usually have only one formu-\nlary to deal with, and it is often fully integrated into their office systems. These\npatterns were mirrored for those rating the effect of formularies as negative.\nPractice exposure to managed care. As in Exhibit 1, we assessed physicians' exposure\nto managed care along several dimensions. Regardless of the measure, as managed\ncare exposure rises, the percentage of physicians who have neutral views about\nformularies declines. With the exception of the number of managed care con-\ntracts, which might indicate how burdensome dealing with multiple formulary\nrequirements is, greater exposure to managed care is generally associated with a\ngreater likelihood that a physician will express positive views about formularies.\nFor instance, 19 percent of physicians in practices with high exposure to capita-\ntion expressed positive views about formularies, compared with only 11 percent\namong those with low exposure. We should also note, however, that in\nmultivariable models controlling for both managed care exposure and the propor-\ntion of practice revenue that was capitated, the degree of capitation appeared to\nbe more strongly related to positive views about formularies.9 The number of man-\naged care contracts a physician's practice has (which is presumably correlated\nwith the number of formularies the physician must deal with) is associated with\nnegative feelings toward formularies. Those with more than ten contracts were\nsignificantly more likely than those with none were to view formularies negatively\nP h y s i c i a n s & F o r m u l a r i e s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 3 , N u m b e r 1 2 2 3\n\"The burden of dealing with multiple formulary requirements is an\nimportant factor influencing physicians' attitudes.\"\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The relationship between number of contracts\nand physicians' attitudes toward formularies suggests that the burden associated\nwith dealing with multiple formulary requirements is an important factor influ-\nencing these attitudes. Information technology could be used to alleviate these\nburdens. We found that physicians' use of information technology to write pre-\nscriptions and check formulary information is strongly associated with how those\nphysicians rate formularies. Although each type of technology independently\nserves to move physicians' attitudes in the positive direction, the use of both tech-\nnologies together appears to be synergistic. Ten percent of physicians who do not\nuse either technology expressed positive attitudes toward formularies, compared\nwith almost 30 percent of physicians who use both technologies.\nConclusions And Policy Implications\nAs Congress considers a variety of proposals for implementing pharmaceutical\ncoverage for Medicare, it is likely that formularies will be a crucial aspect of most\napproaches.10 Given this likelihood, it will be important for policymakers to con-\nsider physicians' views on formularies and the aspects of practice that make these\nviews more positive. Nearly half of all physicians reported that formularies nega-\ntively affect the quality and efficiency of care. Although we cannot dissect the ex-\ntent to which this is attributable to the impact on quality versus the impact on ef-\nficiency, our analyses suggest that the increased hassle factor and resultant effects\non efficiency are major concerns to many physicians.\nInsurers do not specifically compensate physicians for checking formulary lists,\nwriting prescriptions, or fielding calls from pharmacists when prescriptions do\nnot conform with formulary requirements. Recent cuts in physician payment\nrates might have increased the problems Medicare beneficiaries face in accessing\nphysician care.11 This raises the question of whether new formulary requirements\nwould further burden physicians who serve Medicare beneficiaries, potentially\nmaking them less likely to accept new Medicare patients or serve current ones.\nn Need for information technology. Physicians who lack information technol-\nogy that can alleviate these hassles and those who are likely to have to deal with a\nlarge number of different formularies are more likely to have negative attitudes\nabout formularies. These results suggest that policies to promote the adoption and\nuse of information technology for both prescription writing and formulary informa-\ntion should be an important component of any new benefit package; its positive ef-\nfects could extend beyond Medicare.\nThese features might include common specifications to facilitate linkages with\npharmacies and facilitating the electronic retrieval of formulary information. Phy-\nsicians thus would spend less time trying to identify \"covered\" medications\namong multiple formularies. These technologies, particularly those used for pre-\nscription writing, could have the additional benefit of improving patient safety by\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

How managed care affects attitudes\ntoward formularies is more complicated. Physicians with the highest number of\nmanaged care contracts tended to be less likely to view formularies positively, prob-\nably because of the inherent complexities of dealing with multiple coverage and for-\nmulary arrangements. Consequently, policymakers might want to consider adopt-\ning policies that limit the number of PBMs, and implicitly formularies, that operate\nin a particular geographic area. These actions, however, would have uncertain ef-\nfects on any cost savings derived from the use of formularies. In addition, it would be\nimportant to maintain several choices so that beneficiaries could find a plan that\ncovers most of the drugs they are taking.\nn A role for financial incentives? Physicians with higher proportions of\ncapitated managed care revenue have more positive views. Although we cannot dis-\ncern whether this finding is related to the types of physicians that choose to practice\nin capitated arrangements, it suggests that when economic incentives favor the use\nof formularies, physicians view them more positively. However, additional research\nis needed to assess how risk-sharing arrangements or financial incentives might af-\nfect Medicare beneficiaries' access to care. Appropriate financial incentives might\nassure physicians' willingness to treat Medicare beneficiaries, although such incen-\ntives need to be risk-adjusted for patients' severity of illness so as to avoid problems\nspecifically with access for the sickest beneficiaries. Lastly, when more patients have\ncoverage that includes formularies, physicians appear to have a more positive view of\nformularies, perhaps because they gain experience in dealing with them.\nn Study limitations. Our study results must be interpreted in light of several\nlimitations. Because of the nature of our survey, we were not able to distinguish be-\ntween different types of formularies or ask physicians about detailed characteristics\nof formularies such as prior authorization policies, inclusiveness, or the number and\nmagnitude of copayment tiers. We also could not ask the extent to which physicians\nhad dedicated support staff or systems in their offices to help deal with multiple for-\nmularies. While we do not believe these limitations affect our main conclusions,\nvariability in these areas could also affect physicians' views of formularies.\nAs congress considers various str ategies for implementing a\npharmaceutical benefit for Medicare, it should consider adopting policies\nthat are associated with positive views about formularies by physicians.\nThis points to limits on the number of different Medicare formularies that exist in\na particular area, new policies to promote the adoption and use of information\ntechnology for obtaining information and writing prescriptions, and possibly in-\ncorporating financial incentives for physicians or their parent organizations to ad-\nhere to formularies.\nP h y s i c i a n s & F o r m u l a r i e s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 3 , N u m b e r 1 2 2 5\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
