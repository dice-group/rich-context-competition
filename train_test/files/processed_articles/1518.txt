We\nevaluated the association of serum selenium, measured by inductively coupled plasma-dynamic reac-\ntion cell-mass spectrometry, and diabetes, defined as a self-report of current use of hypoglycemic\nagents or insulin or as fasting plasma glucose  126 mg/dL.\nResults: Mean serum selenium was 137.1 \u00b5g/L.

Participants were\ndivided into quartiles of serum selenium\nconcentration based on the weighted popu-\nlation distribution. We used multivariable\nlinear regression to calculate adjusted means\nfor plasma glucose and glycosylated hemo-\nglobin differences and logistic regression to\ncalculate odds ratios (ORs) for diabetes com-\nparing each quartile of serum selenium with\nthe lowest quartile. We used three models with\nprogressive degrees of adjustment. Model 1\nwas adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and\neducation. Model 2 was further adjusted for\nBMI, smoking, cotinine, and menopausal sta-\ntus. Model 3 was further adjusted for use of\nvitamin/mineral supplements. Because ignor-\ning diabetes treatment may result in biased\nestimates of the association between selenium\nand glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin, we\nconducted an additional analysis using cen-\nsored linear regression (model 4) to correct\nfor the effect of medication for diabetes using\nNHANES survey weights (Tobin et al. 2005).\nTests for linear trend were calculated by includ-\ning serum selenium as a continuous variable in\nthe models. To further explore the shape of the\nrelationship among serum selenium and plasma\nglucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and diabetes,\nwe used restricted quadratic splines with knots\nserum selenium distribution. We also evaluated\nthe interactions between selenium (modeled as\nquadratic restricted splines) and sex, age, race/\nethnicity, education, BMI, smoking status, or\nuse of vitamin/mineral supplements. Statistical\nanalyses were performed using weights specific\nfor the fasting morning sample in the survey\npackage in the R Statistical Software (version\n2.6.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing,\nVienna, Austria) to account for the complex\nsampling design and weights.

Participants with diabetes were\nmore likely to be older, male, and non-His-\npanic black or Mexican American and to have\na higher BMI compared with participants\nwithout diabetes (Table 1). Serum selenium\nconcentrations were positively associated with\nage and with the use of vitamin/mineral sup-\nplements, and inversely associated with cur-\nrent smoking (Table 2).

However, whereas sub-\nstantial attention has been paid to explain the\nmechanisms for a potential benefit of increas-\ning serum selenium in low-selenium intake\npopulations, the mechanistic explanation\nfor the effects of selenium above the levels\nrequired to maximize glutathione peroxidase\nactivity is largely unexplored. Further experi-\nmental and epidemiologic research is needed\nto explain the mechanisms underlying the\nobserved associations between high selenium\nexposure and cardiometabolic risk factors.\nHigher selenium concentrations were\nassociated with some diabetes risk factors\nsuch as increasing age. In contrast, selenium\nconcentrations decreased with higher BMI,\nwhich is one of the stronger diabetes risk\nfactors. The associations of selenium and dia-\nbetes reported were adjusted for these risk\nfactors, reducing the possibility that the\nassociation between selenium and diabetes is\ndriven by differences in established diabetes\nrisk factors across selenium levels.\nThe strengths of our study come from the\nrigorous sampling design, the quality of the\nstudy measurements, and the representative-\nness of the NHANES sample. Among its\nlimitations, the cross-sectional design restricts\nour ability to evaluate the temporality of the\nobserved association. It is possible that high\nserum selenium levels are related to body\nweight. Nevertheless, the observed associa-\ntion persisted after adjusting for BMI as well\nas for use of multivitamin/mineral supple-\nments. The use of a single measurement of\nserum selenium may not reflect completely\nthe known high within-person variability\n(Longnecker et al. 1993) and does not pro-\nvide information on selenium metabolism.\nA cross-sectional analysis of a subsample of\nthe Health Professionals Follow-up Study\nfound an inverse association between toenail\nselenium levels and the prevalence of diabetes\nFigure 2.
