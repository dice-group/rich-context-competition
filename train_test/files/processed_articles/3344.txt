The pernicious effects of this broad\nsocietal trend are striking: Rising inequality is linked to poorer health and well-being across countries, continents,\nand cultures. The economic and psychological forces that perpetuate inequality continue to be studied, and in this\ntheoretical review, we examine the role of daily experiences of economic inequality--the communication of social class\nsignals between interaction partners--in this process. We theorize that social class signals activate social comparison\nprocesses that strengthen group boundaries between the haves and have nots in society. In particular, we argue\nthat class signals are a frequent, rapid, and accurate component of person perception, and we provide new data\nand analyses demonstrating the accuracy of class signaling in 60-s interactions, Facebook photographs, and isolated\nrecordings of brief speech. We suggest that barriers to the reduction of economic inequality in society arise directly\nfrom this class signaling process through the augmentation of class boundaries and the elicitation of beliefs and\nbehaviors that favor the economic status quo.\n",

Throughout, we detail existing evidence for each\nof these predictions and chart the future directions they\nsuggest.\nFor the purpose of this article, it is important to dwell\non the definition of social class, which we and others\nhave defined in the past as one's position in the eco-\nnomic hierarchy in society that arises from a combination\nof annual income, educational attainment, and occupa-\nThough the experience of social class is shaped by this\neconomic positioning, the actual impact of the construct\non social and psychological experience is wide-ranging\nand multifaceted: Social class shapes behavior through\ncultural learning, such as socialization processes occur-\nring within a family whose members share a similar\nsocioeconomic background, and through social-cognitive\nmechanisms, which include habitual response patterns to\nan experience that is unique to a particular social class\n(e.g., Fiske & Markus, 2012). Social class can also deter-\nmine the groups an individual interacts with and belongs\nto (Lareau & Conley, 2008). Because of its many facets, it\nis helpful to conceptualize social class (like race) as a\n\"bundle of sticks\" that can be disaggregated and studied\nbased on its specific elements (i.e., Sen & Wasow, 2016).\nSignaling is the specific element of social class we exam-\nine in this article, with an eye toward better understand-\ning how class signals might shape processes related to\nthe creation of class boundaries, perceptions and experi-\nences of class mobility, and self-perceptions of an indi-\nvidual's own socioeconomic position in society.\nWe believe our approach in this article represents a\nsignificant advance in how researchers examine eco-\nnomic inequality. Prior studies have examined economic\ninequality through the lens of a global economy (e.g.,\nPiketty, 2015); as an economic trend perceived by indi-\nviduals (e.g., Kluegel & Smith, 1986); or indirectly through\nan examination of the association between social class\nposition and emotion, cognition, or behavior (e.g., Kohn,\nfrom this prior work, we examine economic inequality as\nthe daily process of comparing one's own socioeconomic\nstanding to that of others based on the dynamic observa-\ntion of observable behaviors that signal social class. Such\nan approach has several direct benefits: This approach\nexpands our understanding of the experience of eco-\nnomic inequality beyond the economic realm to include\nthe dynamic social signaling processes it informs, it\nallows for a fuller understanding of the process by which\npeople come to accurately perceive their own social class\nposition in society relative to others (e.g., Goodman\nunderstanding the processes by which economic inequal-\nity might perpetuate itself over time.\nSigns of Social Class\nFrom primates to fiddler crabs, individuals across species\nsignal their broadly defined social status with nonverbal\nSergio etal., 2011), vocalizations (Dunbar & Burgoon,\nCLASS\nSorting\nStereotyping\nClass conflict\nGROUP\nBOUNDARIES\nDehumanization\nStrategic sharing\nJustifying ideology\nECONOMIC\nINEQUALITY\nMAINTENANCE\nBody\n(Kinesic behavior,\nphysical appearance)\nVoice\n(Linguistic and\nparalinguistic cues,\nword choice)\nCulture\n(Sartorial choices, leisure\nactivities, preferences)\nFig. 1.A theoretical model detailing the modes of social class signaling and their influence on the augmentation of group boundaries\nbetween the haves and have nots in society and, in turn, on social judgments and behaviors that perpetuate economic inequality on a\nsocietal scale.\nstatus symbols assist individuals in avoiding costly aggres-\nsive encounters or in aligning with others who have the\nmaterial resources necessary to facilitate group living\nIn humans, symbols of status are used in a variety of\ncontexts--for instance, to signal physical dominance\n(Kraus & Chen, 2013) or as cues of achieved success\n(Tracy & Matsumoto, 2008). Aligning directly with this\npast research, we assert that social class is a form of soci-\netal social status that is signaled and perceived accurately\nin interactions with others (e.g., Kraus & Keltner, 2009).\nOur first prediction that social class signaling occurs\nduring social perception is supported by two separate\nlines of research. First, research on social comparison, or\nthe process of comparing oneself to other people on\nsocial characteristics and outcomes (Festinger, 1954; Taylor\n& Lobel, 1989), indicates that people compare themselves\nto others frequently on economic dimensions. Social\ncomparison is often referred to as an unavoidable aspect\nof perception during social interactions (Brickman & Bul-\nit functions as a means by which individuals gather infor-\nmation about the self, regulate their emotions and goals,\nmanage uncertainty, and judge the normalcy of personal\nlife events (e.g., Taylor & Lobel, 1989). Though compari-\nsons occur on many dimensions in social relationships,\nevidence indicates that these comparisons are frequently\ntuned to economic outcomes: For instance, reward\nregions of the brain (e.g., the left ventral striatum) were\nactivated when engaging in comparison with an experi-\nment partner who received a relatively lower monetary\nreward rather than an equal reward (Fliessbach etal.,\n2007). In another study, the tendency for nurses to have\na high social comparison orientation--was positively\nassociated with reports of relative deprivation or feelings\nof reduced resources relative to others (Buunk, Zurriaga,\nSecond, studies of social class signaling indicate that\nperceivers can rapidly and accurately judge the social\nclass of others based on only small amounts of informa-\ntion. Theoretical accounts of social class suggest that it\nshapes people's lives in persistent and enduring ways by\nconstraining or expanding access via levels of economic\nresources or by shaping behavior through cultural and\npsychological means (Bourdieu, 1984; Fiske & Markus,\n2012; Kraus, Piff, Mendoza-Denton, Rheinschmidt, &\nKeltner, 2012). Studies generally support this assertion:\nClass determines the foods people eat (Monisaivis &\nDrewnowski, 2009), the music and art they enjoy (DiMaggio\nthey wear (Gillath, Bahns, Ge, & Crandall, 2012). This\nanalysis suggests that when people engage in social\ninteractions, some of their behaviors and cultural prac-\ntices are infused with social class and, as a result, accu-\nrately communicate social class position to observers.\nAlthough several studies indicate class differences in\nand language use (e.g., Labov, 2006) and inform this\nwork a great deal, relatively few examine the social class\nsignaling accuracy of these behaviors (see Table 1). For\ninstance, early work by Davis (1956) found that photo-\ngraphs of living rooms allowed observers to accurately\njudge the occupation status and education of individuals.\nIn the realm of appearance, researchers found that social\nclass can be accurately perceived by strangers based on\nTable 1.

Two additional studies con-\nducted by an author of this manuscript also bear out this\nsignaling prediction: In the first, 50 university student\ndyads (n = 100) were recruited to a laboratory setting\nwhere they had a 5-min \"get acquainted\" interaction with\na stranger (Kraus & Keltner, 2009). In the second, a study\nof cultural practices online, the 20 most recent Facebook\nphotographs were collected from a sample of 113 univer-\nsity students and adults from an online crowdsourcing\nplatform (i.e., MTurk; Becker, Kraus, & Rheinschmidt-\nSame, 2017). In both studies, participants provided infor-\nmation about their own family social class by reporting\ntheir annual income, parental educational attainment,\nand self-perceived position on a 10-rung ladder repre-\nsenting ascending levels of income, education, and occu-\npation status (Adler, Epel, Castellazzo, & Ickovics, 2000).\nA separate sample of observers then watched the first 60 s\nof the \"get acquainted\" interaction or viewed the Face-\nbook photographs and estimated participant social class\non the same 10-rung society ladder. Across both studies,\nan overall composite metric of social class computed by\naveraging the z-scored index of each individual social\nclass item was significantly positively correlated with per-\nceptions of social class made by observers based only on\nMoreover these associations held after accounting for the\nrace and gender of participants.\nFor the purpose of this article, we reanalyzed the data\nfrom these prior studies to determine how well observers\nperformed in estimating social class above chance guess-\ning. For this analysis, observer estimates were divided\ninto four quartiles and two halves based on prior research\nindicating that the United States is divided into four social\nclass categories (i.e., lower, working, middle, and upper\nclass), but that about 90% of people identify with the two\nmiddle categories (Hout, 2008). The overall metric of par-\nticipant social class was also divided into quartiles and\nhalves. We then compared observer estimates to partici-\npant overall social class. The observer estimates were\nconsidered to be correct if the quartile or half chosen by\nobservers matched that of participants, whereas mis-\nmatches were incorrect (e.g., Hertenstein, Holmes,\nMcCullough, & Keltner, 2009). The results of this analysis\nare shown in Figure 2: When compared to chance guess-\ning (i.e., 25% for quartiles, and 50% for halves), observers\nperformed significantly better than chance when estimat-\ning the correct social class quartile, x2(1)Behavior\n=\nusing 60s of recorded behavior or Facebook photo-\ngraphs. Short dynamic bursts of behavior and cultural\npractices shared through photographs on Facebook are\nsufficient to accurately signal social class.\nOne of the most pervasive domains of person percep-\ntion is the voice, and much research supports the utility of\naspects of speech--including word choice and linguistic\nand paralinguistic vocal patterns--in signaling various\nforms of social status. For instance, people modulate their\nvocal pitch to make it more consistent with that of high\nstatus individuals (Gregory & Webster, 1996), and power-\nful people use lowered pitch along with other vocal cues\nto suggest their physical dominance and authority (Hall\neven the linguistic and paralinguistic content of speech, is\nof considerable utility for perceiving the social class of\nspeech style varies by region and cultural background, it\nis also determined by social class: For instance, studies\nfind that students from lower social class backgrounds are\nmore likely to speak using nonstandard dialects than rela-\ntively upper class individuals (Fogel & Ehri, 2000). As\nwell, discrimination occurs more often against individuals\nin the United States with nonstandard dialects (Gluszek &\nDovidio, 2010), and people from traditionally low status\ngroups in society sometimes code switch away from non-\nstandard speech to more standard forms in order to blend\nin while in high status contexts (Brannon & Markus, 2013;\nspectrum, the material resources and opportunities\nafforded by high social class (Kraus etal., 2012; Oishi &\nTalhelm, 2012) allow individuals to travel and to interact\nwith others who are well traveled, thereby contributing to\nless locally defined and more standard patterns of speech.\nCorrect Quartile Correct Half\nPercent Correct\nChance Behavior Facebook\nSpeech Across Modalities\nFig. 2.The tendency for observers to guess the correct social class\nquartile (left) and half (right) of participants based on observing 60 s of\nbehavior, 20 Facebook photographs, listening to seven isolated spoken\nwords, or across all signaling modalities. The light grey bars indicate\npercentages expected if observers are guessing at rates indistinguish-\nable from chance. In all cases, observers showed above chance accu-\nracy in perceiving social class.\nIn one example of the social stratification of linguistic\ncues, Labov (1972) found that New York City department\nstore clerks used different pronunciations for the \"r\" in\nwords like \"floor\" and \"fourth\" based on social class mea-\nsured in terms of the prestige of each of the stores. Upon\nbeing asked to repeat their pronunciations, all clerks\ntended to emphasize the \"r\" sound in the words more\nthan they did in spontaneous speech--a behavior indi-\ncating conscious awareness of the class signaling impli-\ncations of their speech (Labov, 1972). In other direct\nevidence for signaling of social class through speech,\nGiles and Sassoon (1983) asked participants to mimic a\nCockney or standard English accent, finding that Cock-\nney accents were judged lower in social class than stan-\ndard English ones.\nThe above analysis suggests that speech style is an\naccurate signal of social class even when the semantic\ncontent of speech is held constant. In a new study, we\nsought to test the very limits of this assertion by exposing\nthe brief speech of individuals (i.e., seven words spoken\nout of context) to a separate panel of observers with the\nprediction that observers would accurately judge social\nclass based solely on speech style.\nTo test this hypothesis we used a sample of individual\nspeakers from across the United States recorded reading\none of two literary passages by the International Dialects\nof English Archive (http://dialectsarchive.com). Of the\nstates in the United States, 213 reported their educational\nattainment and occupation status, and these speakers\ncomprised our sample for the signaling analysis. We then\ncreated isolated speech recordings for seven spoken\nwords--(i.e., \"and,\" \"from,\" \"thought,\" \"beautiful,\" \"imag-\nine,\" \"yellow,\" and \"the\") chosen because they occurred\nin both read passages--for each of the speakers and pre-\nsented these recordings to a separate U.S. panel sample of\nobservers recruited as part of Qualtrics panels (n = 568).\nJust as in the prior studies, our observer sample estimated\nspeaker social class using a 10-rung ladder representing\nascending levels of social class in society (M = 5.85, SD =\n0.68). We then compared averaged observer estimates of\nsocial class to a standard composite (M = -0.02, SD =\n0.87) of speaker educational attainment, coded based on\nfour ascending categories (1 = did not finish high school,\n2 = high school graduation or some college, 3 = four-year\ncollege graduation, 4 = advanced degree), and occupa-\ntion status, coded using an established four digit occupa-\ntion status coding scheme (Ganzeboom, De Graaf, &\nTreiman, 1992). See the online Supplemental Material for\nmore detail on the samples, stimuli, and analyses.\nThe results support our prediction that speech style is\na social class signal. Observers provided judgments of\nspeaker social class that were significantly positively cor-\nMoreover, this association held after accounting for\nspeaker characteristics--race, gender, and vocal pitch--\nas well as geographic region characteristics--zip code\nlevel population density, median income, and high school\ntions of social class were also significantly positively\nassociated with actual speaker social class in three of the\nfour Census defined regions of the United States (all but\nWe also examined how observer estimates of social\nclass performed relative to chance using the prior quar-\ntile and half analysis. Splitting the sample for this analysis\nappeared to be valid: For instance, the bottom half of\nspeakers had an average educational attainment of 1.83,\nroughly equivalent to an education of high school gradu-\nation and some college, and an occupation code of\nand service workers (5000). The top half of the speaker\nsample had an average educational attainment of 3.38,\nconsistent with obtaining a four-year college degree, and\nstatus of professional athletes and journalists (1500). As\nFigure 2 illustrates, observers showed above chance\nsocial class based only on their speaking style--evident\nupon listening to just seven words spoken out of context.\nMoreover, the overall chance accuracy estimate across\nthe modalities of social class signaling (see Fig. 2, right-\nmost bars) was significant, x2(1)Quartile\nOverall, these studies across diverse domains of\nspeech and behavior provide some preliminary yet prom-\nising evidence suggesting that social class is rapidly and\naccurately perceived in the early stages of social percep-\ntion. Several future directions are suggested by this\nresearch: For instance, does accuracy of social class per-\nception improve linearly with the addition of more\nbehavioral information about social class? Based on prior\nresearch, it is possible that diminishing returns in social\nperception accuracy occur for social class due to the\nonset of confirmation biases (Nickerson, 1998). Likewise,\nthough we demonstrate that the information passed on in\nthe initial stages of impression formation is sufficient for\nclass signaling, data using more sensitive time measure-\nments might be able to determine precisely when accu-\nracy in class signaling emerges in the social perception\nprocess (e.g., at the level of seconds or milliseconds). It\nis also interesting to speculate about the other modalities\nof social perception where class signals are communi-\ncated. Given health disparities between high and low\nsocial class individuals (Adler etal., 1994), perhaps phys-\nical features that reveal health are also a reliable indicator\nof social class as preliminary work suggests (Bjornsdottir\nSocial class signals are also the result of two processes--\nperceiver judgments and target behaviors--and thus far\nstudies have only started to examine the specific contribu-\ntion of each process to accurate class signaling. Experi-\nments that systematically constrain target behavior, by for\ninstance, carefully controlling the context and conditions\nfor speech (Labov, 1972), can better tease apart both the\nspecific behaviors that elicit class signals and the minimal\nconditions necessary for perceivers to judge social class. In\nthis vein, signal detection theory methods are needed to\ndetermine how sensitive social class perceptions are to\nLastly, one of the central claims of this analysis is that peo-\nple experience economic inequality principally through\nthis process of sending and perceiving social class signals\nin daily interactions and comparatively less in terms of\nmacroeconomic societal shifts in wealth and markets. One\nimplication of this logic is that in countries or cultures\nwhere societal economic inequality is lower, signals of\nsocial class might actually be harder to discern than in\ncountries like the United States where inequality is height-\nened (e.g., C\u00f4t\u00e9, House, & Willer, 2015).\nSocial Class Signals Augment\nGroup Boundaries\nHaving detailed evidence suggesting that social class is\nperceived early on in the social perception process, we\nnow turn to the potential consequences of the accuracy\nof social class perceptions for groups in society. We make\nthree specific predictions for how class signals augment\ngroup boundaries--by facilitating the sorting of individu-\nals into social class groups, activating social class stereo-\ntypes, and enhancing conflict between the haves and\nhave nots in society.\nSignals of social class create group boundaries by sort-\ning individuals into social class categories. The sorting of\npeople in society based on social class is readily appar-\nent from a cursory examination of social life. Schools and\nneighborhoods are often segregated in terms of social\nclass, with many explicit home lending policies favoring\nneighborhood separation based on social classes (Desmond,\n2016). People's romantic preferences also seem to follow\nalong social class lines, as the educational attainment,\nannual income, and occupational prestige of romantic\npartners tends to be highly positively correlated (Schwartz,\n2013). Social class sorting is also supported by low levels\nof economic mobility in places like the United States,\nwhere the chances of moving up or down in the social\nclass hierarchy are constrained, particularly relative to\npeople's lay estimates (Davidai & Gilovich, 2015; Kraus &\nTan, 2015). This sorting is one of the likely reasons why\npeople from differing social class backgrounds develop\nunique norms and cultural models for behavior and\nself-expression discussed earlier (Stephens, Markus, &\nIn addition to the historical structural barriers that con-\ntribute to the sorting of social class in society (Desmond,\n2016), we contend that social class signals expressed and\nperceived in interactions with others facilitate this sorting\nprocess. Specifically, we assert that social class signals are\ncausal in the maintenance of structural social class\nboundaries because they reduce class mobility and limit\ncross-class contact. Several lines of evidence are sugges-\ntive of this prediction: The notion that similarity enhances\nliking and relationship formation is a core principle in\nrelationship science (Bergeron & Zanna, 1973; Montoya,\nHorton, & Kirchner, 2008). When individuals accurately\nsignal and perceive social class in interactions with oth-\ners, signals that communicate differences in social class\nare likely to create barriers for relationship formation\nacross class boundaries. In this fashion, class signals are\nparticularly strong in determining the likelihood of rela-\ntionship formation and in constraining access to net-\nworks of influence and opportunity and to individuals of\nsimilar (higher) social class upbringing.\nThe first work directly assessing this prediction was\nconducted by Bergeron and Zanna (1973). In their study,\nPeruvian university students read opinion pieces that\nwere manipulated to be written by someone who shared\ntheir social class (i.e., attended their same university, an\nelite social club, or a neighboring university) or who did\nnot (i.e., a member of the Peruvian indigenous popula-\ntion not attending college). Participants reported desiring\nto form a relationship with opinion writers who shared\ntheir social class far more than they did the relatively\nlower class indigenous writers not attending college, and\nthis effect was independent of participants' level of agree-\nment with the arguments in the opinion piece (Bergeron\n& Zanna, 1973). In more recent experimental evidence,\ndescribing a potential interaction partner using upper\nclass signals (e.g., plans to travel to Europe during the\nsummer) led to greater affiliation motivation among\nupper class participants, whereas describing a partner\nusing lower class signals (e.g., plans to get a job over the\nsummer to help with family bills) led to greater affiliation\nmotivation among lower class participants (C\u00f4t\u00e9, Kraus,\nPiff, Beerman, & Keltner, 2014). Aligning with this\nresearch, several correlational studies find that first gen-\neration college students report feeling more alienated\nfrom university environments than do their continuing\ngeneration counterparts--a finding that suggests that sig-\nnals of social class on college campuses, which are pre-\ndominantly populated by people from highly educated\nfamilies, reduce feelings of belonging among relatively\nlower class individuals (e.g., Bufton, 2003; Ostrove &\non job hiring finds a similar pattern: Interviews reveal\nthat top-tier business firms rely on social class informa-\ntion in extracurricular activities and club memberships to\nseek out higher social class applicants (Rivera, 2016), and\nexperiments find that men described as working class\nwere less likely to receive a hypothetical job offer for a\nhigher class managerial position relative to middle-class\nClass signals also create group boundaries through\nstereotyping--that is, social class signals activate unique\nstereotypes about people from distinct ends of the eco-\nnomic spectrum. Though the accuracy of stereotypes is a\nmatter of some controversy (McCauley, Jussim, & Lee,\n1995), several converging lines of evidence suggest that\nthe use of stereotypes in person perception aid in the\nformation of group boundaries and the expression of\nprejudice and discrimination (Fiske, 2005; Fiske et\nal.,\n2002). Studies also indicate that signals of social class are\nused as a basis for activating stereotypes. In the original\nstudies of the stereotype content model by Fiske and col-\nbased on how others in society view the groups on\nwarmth and competence. The studies found that social\nclass was a reliable predictor of stereotype content across\nstudies and samples--the rich were viewed typically as\nlow in warmth but high in competence, whereas the\npoor were viewed as both low in warmth and compe-\ntence (Fiske etal., 2002). It is important to note that the\nstereotype content association of high competence to\nhigh social class has been replicated across 37 cultures\n(Durante etal., 2013) and, in particular, when assessing\nthe stereotypes using social class signals: In one exam-\nple, signals of wealth in Italian print media were associ-\nated with ratings of individuals as higher in competence\n(Durante, Volpato, & Fiske, 2010). In other research,\nmore or less expensive houses were used to judge the\ncompetence of occupants (Oldmeadow & Fiske, 2012).\nJust as class signals separate individuals from different\nclass backgrounds and activate stereotypes, they are also\nthe tinder for class conflict. Specifically, signals of social\nclass increase conflict between individuals of different\nsocial class groups because they make salient that\nresources are unequally shared between individuals in\nsociety. Though people across countries and cultures\nhave different expectations for the ways in which\nresources are shared, visible inequalities such as those\nthat are made apparent by social class signals violate\nassumptions about the generosity of neighbors and the\nfairness of current economic systems. For instance, prior\nresearch indicates that residents of poor neighborhoods\nare impacted psychologically by visible class signals--\nexperiencing worse health outcomes when they live\nadjacent to rich neighborhoods than they do living\nadjacent to poor neighborhoods (Pellowski, Kalichman,\nMatthews, & Adler, 2013). To the extent health is related\nto group conflict (e.g., Gallo & Matthews, 2003), this\nresearch is suggestive of the possibility that social class\nsignals have the capacity to increase conflict between the\nclasses.\nSeveral studies support the notion that the presence of\nclass signals contribute to rises in class conflict. On air-\nplanes, the odds of air rage, defined as extreme antiso-\ncial behavior reported during commercial airline flights,\nincrease when class signals are visible--through the\npresence versus absence of a first class cabin, or through\nboarding the plane at the front of the aircraft where the\nfirst class cabin is located versus boarding at the rear\nwhere it is not (DeCelles & Norton, 2016). In laboratory\nresearch, class signals were directly manipulated during a\ncompetitive real estate negotiation, where two strangers\nrole-played as a buyer or seller of a biotechnology plant\n(Kraus & Mendes, 2014). Prior to the negotiation, one of\nthe two participants was assigned to upper class clothing\n(i.e., a business suit), lower class clothing (i.e., sweats\nand t-shirt), or their own neutral clothing before engag-\ning in the negotiation with a neutrally clothed participant\nunaware of the clothing change (Kraus & Mendes, 2014).\nIn the study, negotiation pairs where signals of social\nclass were manipulated experienced significant differ-\nences in profits, concessions, and physiological states\nassociated with threat vigilance between players whereas\nno differences emerged in pairs where class signals were\nnot manipulated (Kraus & Mendes, 2014). In a more\ndirect experimental test of this conflict hypothesis, par-\nticipants were exposed to pictures of high or low wealth\nbefore answering questions about their aggressive ten-\ndencies. Participants exposed to high wealth signals in\npictures felt temporarily lower in social class and were\nmore likely to feel aggressive in general--particularly\ntoward a relatively upper-class PhD student who ostensi-\nbly designed the wealth stimuli (Greitemeyer & Sagioglou,\n2016). Though much of this research does not involve\nspecific interclass conflicts, the findings themselves are\nsuggestive of the role of signals of social class in provok-\ning aggressive states for individuals and potentially for\nsocial groups around class lines.\nTaken together, we have amassed some initial evi-\ndence supporting our second prediction that class signals\ncreate group boundaries between the haves and have\nnots in society by sorting people into social classes, acti-\nvating stereotype content, and enhancing class conflicts.\nThese early findings are supportive of our theoretical\npredictions and suggest several avenues of future\nresearch. For instance, in many of the reviewed experi-\nments, participants are exposed to class signals in con-\ntrolled laboratory settings (e.g., reading about a\nhypothetical job candidate)--it will be instructive to\ndetermine whether perception of class signals during\nmore naturalistic social perception elicits the same group\nprocesses. As well, some of the prior research indicates\nthat signals of higher social class are particularly strong\nin eliciting conflict between social classes (DeCelles &\ning in future research to examine if symbols of wealth and\npoverty exert asymmetric influences on class boundaries.\nPeople perceive others on a variety of group dimen-\nsions, including social categories like race and gender\nthat have clear physical characteristics (e.g., skin color,\nsecondary sexual characteristics) that individuals use\nduring social perception. How social class group bound-\naries and stereotypes inform, and are informed by, per-\nceptions of other categories is an important area of future\nthis regard, the potential permeability of social class\ngroups is a domain where social class may differ from\nother categories: Aspirational motivations of relatively\nlower class individuals might lead these individuals to\nidentify less with their social class group or even to stra-\ntegically adjust their behavior to signal the social class to\nwhich they aspire. More broadly, thinking of group\nboundaries in terms of social class has the potential to\ninform theories of intergroup relations by both adding a\nsocial category upon which individuals define their social\ngroups and by highlighting the intersections of these cat-\negories. For instance, research on stereotype content sug-\ngests that the valence of racial stereotypes depends on\nsocial class (e.g., Fiske & Dupree, 2014).\nWould people desiring upward mobility benefit from\nmodifying their own signals to appear as if they belong\nto the class they aspire to--as is attempted by the char-\nacter Eliza Doolittle in the play Pygmalion by George\nof this possibility. For instance, the aforementioned\nresearch on stereotyping suggests that shifting one's\nsocial class signals to be more in line with higher social\nclass individuals will elicit others' judgments of height-\nened competence (e.g., Fiske etal., 2002). In the afore-\nmentioned sartorial symbols manipulation study, people\nwho were assigned a business suit earned higher profits,\nmade fewer concessions, and were perceived as more\npowerful in a dyadic negotiation relative to their interac-\ntion partner, who was unaware of the clothing assign-\nment (Kraus & Mendes, 2014). These data suggest that\nmodifying one's class signals in aspirational ways has\nimmediate benefits; however, the sustainability of these\nmodifications is a matter of future empirical inquiry\nindicate that awareness of one's lower status relative to\nothers is cognitively demanding (Johnson, Richeson, &\nFinkel, 2011) or likely to elicit stereotype threat (Croizet\nsuggest that conscious modification of class signals will\ndisrupt individual cognitive performance at least until the\nbehaviors become habitual.\nClass Signals Perpetuate Economic\nInequality\nThe evidence we have reviewed thus far suggests that\nclass signals are accurately perceived in brief social behav-\nior and facilitate the creation of class boundaries. In this\nfinal section, we detail the ways in which class signaling\nprocesses have the potential to actually perpetuate the\neconomic conditions they arise from. We predict that class\nsignals increase economic inequality maintenance by elic-\niting dehumanizing judgments of those at the bottom of\nthe class hierarchy and strategic sharing patterns that\nfavor sharing resources with those who already have\nresources over those without, as well as justifying ideolo-\ngies that elicit perceptions of economic structures as fair,\nlegitimate, mobile, and merit-based.\nBeliefs about people who occupy the lowest positions\non the social class hierarchy include that these individu-\nals are both untrustworthy in social relationships and\nincapable of changing their own states (Fiske et\nal.,\n2002). Thus, class signals that elicit judgments that one is\nat the bottom of the economic hierarchy are likely to\nelicit patterns of social perception suggesting that indi-\nviduals are simultaneously incapable of achieving desired\nlife outcomes and more likely to harm others. This mix of\nsocial judgments leads perceivers to scorn extremely low\nstatus groups in society (Fiske, 2011) and to discount\ntheir mental states and human characteristics (Cikara,\nBruneau, & Saxe, 2011)--a pattern we and others refer to\nIn one illustrative study of this dehumanizing process\ndirected at the poor, Harris and Fiske (2006) showed\nphotographs of people from various groups in society.\nPictures of homeless and drug-addicted individuals, those\nat the very bottom of the economic spectrum elicited\nself-reports of disgust--an emotion associated with\nintense dislike and avoidance of outgroups (Harris &\nFiske, 2006). In a study with similar methods, photo-\ngraphs of the poor were less likely to activate the medial\nprefrontal cortex of perceivers, a brain region associated\nwith considering the mental states of others (Harris,\nCikara, & Fiske, 2008). Signals of lower social class appear\nto reduce the extent that we consider the minds of the\npoor.\nAligning with this dehumanization perspective, social\nclass signals are likely to elicit strategic patterns of\nresource sharing. Part of the utility of signaling status in\ninterpersonal life is the capacity to weigh the costs and\nbenefits of cooperation (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1993;\nKraus & Keltner, 2009). In this vein, sharing resources\nwith a person with low economic standing may be per-\nceived as risky behavior because such a sharing relation-\nship has few direct economic benefits for the sharer.\nBased on this analysis, one possible consequence is that\nvisible class signals perpetuate inequality in society by\ndiscouraging resource sharing with those that have less\nin favor of sharing with others of similar class standing.\nSeveral lines of evidence support this assertion. In an\nexperiment directly testing whether visible class signals\ninfluence strategic sharing, researchers created miniature\nsocieties in an experimental economic game where par-\nticipants shared resources with each other across time\n(Nishi, Shirado, Rand, & Christakis, 2015). In the study,\nsome societies were manipulated to have individuals\nwith visible resources whereas in other societies resources\nwere invisible. When resources were visible, participants\nshared their resources with other resource-rich individu-\nals, thereby perpetuating economic inequality. In con-\ntrast, when resources were invisible, participants shared\nregardless of the resources of their partners, thereby\nreducing economic inequality (Nishi etal., 2015). These\nfindings suggest that visible class signals perpetuate eco-\nnomic inequality by eliciting strategic resource sharing\npatterns. In other research, higher income individuals\ngave less in a single trial dictator game to an anonymous\nother when living in states that were more unequal or\nwhen exposed to high levels of economic inequality\n(C\u00f4t\u00e9, House, & Willer, 2015). These results suggest that\nawareness of social class differences elicits lower levels\nof resource sharing among the wealthy.\nFinally, we assert that signals of social class can also\nactivate basic dissonance processes that perpetuate eco-\nnomic inequality. Cognitive dissonance occurs when\npeople are forced to reconcile conflicting attitudes or\nand economic inequality is an economic state that fre-\nquently elicits dissonance processes (Kraus & Tan, 2015;\nPelham, & Carvallo, 2002). In essence, when levels of\neconomic inequality widen, beliefs that society is fair and\njust are directly challenged. These dissonance processes\nassociated with economic inequality, in part, explain why\npeople underestimate levels of economic inequality\n(Norton & Ariely, 2011), class mobility (Davidai & Gilov-\nich, 2015), and CEO pay relative to the average worker\nEvidence we have reviewed thus far indicates that class\nsignals are perceived rapidly and accurately, activate class\nstereotypes, and augment class boundaries. Many of these\npsychological consequences of class signaling are likely\nto elicit uncomfortable social comparisons about one's\nstanding in society relative to others (Buunk etal., 2003).\nThrough this process, we suggest that class signals are\nalso likely to elicit economic dissonance processes that\nlead to the justification of economic inequality--particu-\nlarly for those at the top of the economic hierarchy who\nstand to gain the most from the current economic system.\nThough no study to date has examined the role of class\nsignals in particular in eliciting specific justifying ideolo-\ngies, several studies indirectly illustrate this in laboratory\nsettings. In one set of studies, temporarily manipulating\nan individual's relative standing to be higher than other\npeople in an economic game led to seeing the economic\ngame itself as fairer (Brown-Iannuzi, Lundberg, Kay, &\nPayne, 2015). In another study, asking participants to\nthink of someone way below them on a social class lad-\nder in society elicited beliefs that social class mobility was\nhigher in society than it actually was (Kraus & Tan, 2015).\nTo the extent that class signals activate these same com-\nparison processes, we expect these signals to elicit similar\njudgments of unequal economic systems as more fair,\nmobile, merit-based, and justified.\nThe above evidence suggests that class signals activate\nindividual and group processes that perpetuate economic\ninequality. Several lines of future research are necessary\nto more rigorously test this theoretical prediction. For\ninstance, much of this work relies on laboratory studies\nin which class signals are artificially made visible (Nishi\net al., 2015) or brought to mind (Brown-Iannuzi etal.,\n2015). How actual class signals activate these same pro-\ncesses as they are expressed in everyday social interac-\ntions remains a promising area of future research. For\ninstance, the concealment of visible social class is a rea-\nson used to justify school uniform policies in more than\n20% of schools in the United States (Ball, Bowe, &\nGewirtz, 1996). Do uniforms reduce social class signaling\nand class conflict, or alternatively, do the myriad and\nsubtle ways in which behaviors signal social class render\nsuch uniform policies ineffective in concealing social\nclass?\nAlso, little is known about the mechanisms that might\ncounteract the ways that class signaling perpetuates eco-\nnomic inequality. It is possible, for instance, that elevat-\ning compassionate responses to the needy, such as by\neliciting judgments of high self\u00adother similarity with\nlower class others (Oveis, Horberg, & Keltner, 2009), will\ncountervail the psychological processes related to eco-\nnomic inequality maintenance. However, the evidence\nwe have reviewed thus far suggests that barriers to the\nexperience of compassion across social classes are sig-\nnificant: People of higher social class standing view lower\nsocial class others as outgroup members who are less\nhuman, less warm, and less competent than their same\nclass counterparts and each of these perceptions is likely\nto create a compassion barrier. Given these patterns, pol-\nicies that aim to improve the lives of the poor by relying\non wealthy individuals and corporations to act compas-\nsionately, with the best interests of lower class individuals\nin mind, do not rest on the available empirical evidence\nClass Signals as Everyday Inequality\nIn this review, we argue that the global rising tide of eco-\nnomic inequality is experienced at the interpersonal\nlevel. We contend that subtle differences in the ways in\nwhich people behave toward and even speak about the\nhaves and have nots of society are perceived rapidly and\naccurately and that, as a consequence of these percep-\ntions, social class divides sectors of society and economic\ninequality is perpetuated. We support this theoretical\nposition with basic research studies from the psychologi-\ncal and economic sciences that examine class signaling in\nthe context of observational studies of visible economic\ninequality (DeCelles & Norton, 2016), as well as con-\ntrolled laboratory experiments (Nishi et al., 2015).\nIf our theoretical predictions are accurate, how might\nsocial class signals shape society? One prediction derives\nfrom the daily experience of relatively lower class indi-\nviduals who, according to our theory, will see themselves\nas chronically lower in societal status relative to others\nacross the domains of their lives. A consequence of these\nchronic perceptions might be widespread disengagement\nfrom politics as lower class individuals come to distrust a\npolitical system that ignores their own daily economic\nstruggles. We see some evidence for these political trends\ncurrently in the United States where lower class individu-\nals participate less in general elections than their rela-\ntively upper class counterparts (Census.gov; Laurison,\ngress and current Presidential candidates have the high-\nest disapproval ratings on record (Enten, 2016). To the\nextent that social class signals contribute to these trends\nin politics is an empirical question worthy of further\nresearch.\nFor relatively lower class Whites, daily perceptions of\nsubordinate societal status are also likely to sow inter-\ngroup conflict, particularly with respect to other tradi-\ntionally disadvantaged groups (cf., Gilens, 1999): When\nnew immigrants, refugees, women, or ethnic minorities\nreceive (or are simply perceived to receive) benefits from\nthe government that are not explicitly shared by lower\nclass Whites, these benefits have the potential to create\nrealistic group conflict (e.g., Bobo, 1983) because gov-\nernment policies seem to respond to one kind of injus-\ntice (e.g., racial discrimination) and not another (e.g.,\nconditions of poverty). One example of this dynamic is\nthe belief among Whites that Blacks are the sole and ille-\ngitimate beneficiaries of welfare (Gilens, 1999). Wide-\nspread concern about taking on Syrian refugees across\nthe United States and Europe and the existence of a cur-\nrent U.S. President who has openly expressed racism and\nwhite supremacy (Kharakh & Primack, 2016) are also\nboth potential examples of realistic conflict playing out in\ncurrent events. To the extent that these broad societal\ntrends are influenced by everyday signals of social class\nis an empirical question worth scrutiny.\nThe reviewed evidence suggests a few additional\nfuture empirical directions of note. In particular, there are\nseveral implications for the process of class mobility\nhighlighted by our theory: The evidence for class signal-\ning suggests that one possible barrier to upward social\nclass mobility is that social class is perceived rapidly and\naccurately in basic person perception and that these\njudgments may elicit assessments of one's lower compe-\ntence that could impact promotion and hiring decisions\n(Rivera & Tilcsik, 2016) or feelings of belonging at a uni-\nversity that are so crucial for academic achievement and\nstriving (Stephens, Hamedani, & Destin, 2014). As such,\nperhaps individual differences in code switching apti-\ntude, the ability to switch between group contexts and to\nan individual's capacity to move up the class hierarchy.\nHow societal institutions--like schools and employers--\ncan reduce the impact of class signaling, or alternatively,\nweigh those signals in admission and hiring decisions is\nalso a crucial area of future inquiry.\nRelated to this point, the theoretical model we advo-\ncate for here relates to past research examining the psy-\nchological experience of individuals at the bottom of the\nclass hierarchy. This research indicates that lower social\nclass individuals are more vigilant of threats in their envi-\nronments (Gallo & Matthews, 2003), exhibit reduced\nexecutive functioning (Mullainathan & Shafir, 2013), and\nexperience poorer health and well-being outcomes rela-\ntive to their more advantaged counterparts (Adler etal.,\ncould uncover the extent that class signals are causal in\neliciting these patterns, and some research is suggestive\nof this possibility: As we mentioned previously, environ-\nments where inequality is more visible elicit greater\nthreat-related aggressive tendencies (DeCelles & Norton,\nhealth outcomes for the poor (Pellowski etal., 2013).\nOverall then, the impact of economic inequality is both\nsignificant and widespread. Significant because it predicts\nthe health and well-being of members of society, and\nwidespread because of the ways in which people can\nexperience inequality in the briefest of social interactions\nwith strangers, while boarding airplanes, and in travel\nbetween schools and neighborhoods. Although societal\neconomic inequality has received growing empirical and\npublic attention, the everyday experience of that inequal-\nity is a largely unexamined phenomenon in need of\ngreater scrutiny: Macro-economic policy changes may not\nreceive widespread public support, regardless of their\nbenefits, if those policies do not also articulate the ways\nin which they contend with social class dynamics in daily\nsocial interactions. To wit, passage of the UK referendum\nto leave the European Union occurred with the support of\nrelatively lower class individuals whose concerns cen-\ntered more on the importance of allocating resources to\nnational programs, and less on the impact that leaving\nmight have on the economic fortunes of banks and multi-\nnational corporations (Barr, 2016). How nations, cultures,\nand societies respond to economic inequality is a conten-\ntious and complex issue with significant social and eco-\nnomic implications for societies and, as we have argued,\nthe daily social and psychological experiences of indi-\nviduals who populate them.\n"
