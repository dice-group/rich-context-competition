Thus it has been\nwidely recommended as a key public health policy [1,3,4]\nin the United States (US): for instance, adults should en-\ngage in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical\nactivity (e.g., brisk walking) on five days of the week.\nHowever, according to the recent statistics from the Be-\nhavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) [5],\nonly half of US adults meet the recommended level\nof physical activity and about 25% of adults do not en-\ngage in any physical activity during their leisure time.\nMore importantly, the proportions have not changed\nO R I G I N A L P A P E R S B. CHOI et al.\n(e.g., reading books, sports activities, social participation,\nand political activities), but in contrast, those who have\na \"passive job\" (a combination of low control and low\ndemands), would undergo a process of \"skill atrophy and\nunlearning\" [10, p. 94]. This group would be least active\nin the leisure activities. In addition, those who had \"low\nstrain\" jobs (a combination of high control and low de-\nmands) or \"high strain\" jobs (a combination of low con-\ntrol and high demands) would have intermediate levels\nof the leisure activities. In a national Swedish study [6],\nsports activities during leisure time were more prevalent\nin those who had high control, high demands, and an ac-\ntive job (vs. passive job).\nOther theories have focused on the internal process of how\npeople change behavior [11\u00ad13]. These theories posit that\nfor successful adoption of healthy behaviors, a person\nneeds to be highly motivated and also to have skill and\nability to actualize a well-conceived plan for the behavior\nagainst barriers in reality.\nIn sum, the above theories imply that job control, psycho-\nlogical job demands, and an active job (vs. passive job)\nwould be associated with LTPA in a working population.\nEmpirical evidence:\npsychosocial working conditions and active LTPA\nEmpirical evidence for these associations has been in-\nconclusive. Some studies have supported the associations\nfor high job control [6,14\u00ad18], high psychological job\nies have not supported the associations for high job con-\ntrolling for possible confounders such as socioeconomic\nstatus, physical effort at work, and working hours. Further-\nmore, to our knowledge, few studies [15] have examined\nthe associations in US workers from diverse occupations\nand industries.\nThe aim of this study is to examine whether psychosocial\nwork characteristics are associated with active (moderate\nor vigorous level) LTPA in middle-aged US workers, using\na recent US national dataset.\nmuch during the last fifteen years. The reasons for this\nsituation are not well understood and there may well be\nimportant unidentified social and environmental deter-\nminants of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA). This\nstudy explores the role of psychosocial work character-\nistics such as job control, psychological job demands,\nand their combinations as occupational determinants\nof LTPA in US workers.\nTheories: the relationship between work and LTPA\nA number of sociologists [6\u00ad9] have postulated that work\ncharacteristics could affect leisure-time activities of work-\ners and, generally, there would be a similarity rather\nthan an antithesis between work and non-work activities\n(called \"spill-over hypothesis\" vs. \"compensation hy-\npothesis\"). Meissner [7] suggested, in a study on manual\nworkers at a Canadian wood-product manufacturing fac-\ntory, that \"the design of industrial work creates or pre-\nvents opportunities for the development or maintenance\nof discretionary and social skills. When choice of action is\nsuppressed by the spatial, temporal, and functional con-\nstraints of the work process, worker capacity for meeting\nthe demands of spare-time activities which require discre-\ntion is reduced. They engage less in those activities which\nnecessitated planning, coordination, and purposeful ac-\ntion\" (p. 260). In the study, Meissner [7] reported that\nthose who had high job discretion engaged more frequent-\nly in sports activities during their leisure time, in contrast,\nthose who had low job discretion engaged more frequently\nin sedentary activities at home (e.g., going for a drive, TV\nwatching) during their leisure time.\nKarasek [6] also proposed a similar, but more sophisti-\ncated hypothesis based on the two concepts -- job con-\ntrol (opportunities at work for learning and decision\nmaking) and psychological job demands (degree of men-\ntal work demands). According to the active-passive hy-\npothesis of the demand-control (DC) model [6,10], those\nwho have an \"active job\" (a combination of high control\nand high demands) would develop \"more skills through\nthe trial/failure/success learning process\" [10, p. 93] and\nan active personality (\"feeling of mastery or confidence\",\np. 98). Thus, they would be most active in leisure activities\ngender. However, in the follow-up, less-educated per-\nsons and non-whites were relatively more likely to have\ndropped out of the study. For the MIDUS II study, 4963\npersons (males, 47% and females, 53%) completed a tele-\nphone interview only (N = 931) and both the interview\nand mailed questionnaires (N = 4032). For this analysis,\nwe first restricted study subjects to those (N = 2292) who\ncompleted both the interview and mailed questionnaires\ning a paid-job (at least one hour per week at a main job)\nin the MIDUS II survey (N = 2469), and were aged less\nand 1018 females) who had valid information on the expo-\nsure and outcome variables (see below) were chosen for\nthis analysis.\nMain exposures -- job control, psychological job\ndemands, and their combinations\nBoth job control and psychological job demands were as-\nsessed by self-administered questionnaire items, similar\nto the ones of the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) [24].\nJob control was measured with five items about skill dis-\ncretion (2 items; e.g., \"How often do you learn new things\nat work?\") and decision authority (3 items; e.g., \"How of-\nten do you have a choice in deciding how you do your tasks\nat work?\"). Psychological job demands were measured\nwith three items about work intensity, workload, and time\npressure (e.g., \"How often do you have enough time to\nget everything done?\" -- reverse scored). More detailed\ninformation about the items is available elsewhere [25].\nThe items had a five-point Likert type of response set: all\nof the time (1) to never (5) and were summed up for scal-\ning-scoring. The Cronbach alphas of job control and psy-\nFor analysis, the two scale scores were divided into four\ngroups based on their quartiles. The lowest groups of job\ncontrol and psychological job demands scale scores were\nchosen as the reference for analysis (see below).\nThe four quadrants of the DC model -- active, low strain,\nhigh strain, and passive jobs -- were created by two differ-\nent methods: a) based on the medians of job control and\npsychological job demands (hereafter called \"four-group\nMETHODS\nStudy population\nData from the National Survey of Midlife Development\nin the United States (MIDUS) II study [23] were used\nfor this study.

They were drawn from four sub-\nsamples: (a) a national random-digit-dial (RDD) sample\n(N = 3487); (b) oversamples from five metropolitan ar-\neas (N = 757); (c) siblings of individuals from the RDD\nsample (N = 950); and (d) a national RDD sample\nof twin pairs (N = 1914). The response rates of the four\nsubsamples ranged from 60% to 70%. The four subsam-\nples were very similar to one another in terms of the dis-\ntributions of age, education, and gender [23]. The socio-\ndemographic characteristics of the RDD subsample were\ncomparable to those of a US population representative\nsample, the October 1995 Current Population Survey\n(http://www.census.gov/cps).

Working conditions were measured by ques-\ntionnaire items: physical effort at work (1 item), coworker\n(2 items) and immediate supervisor (2 items) support,\nand no coworkers (2 items) and immediate supervisors\n(2 items). More detailed information about the items is\navailable elsewhere [25]. In addition, hours of work per\nweek at a main job ( 40 hrs and > 40 hrs per week) and\nother paid jobs (yes vs. no) were also self-reported.\nThe following health conditions and health behaviors were\nmeasured: major depression assessed by the telephone in-\nterview, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders III-R [35]; chronic diseases (those\nwho have experienced or been treated for any of the fol-\nlowing during the past 12 months: arthritis, sciatica, recur-\nring stomach trouble or diarrhea, persistent foot troubles,\ntrouble with varicose veins, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and\nhernia; or those who have ever had heart problems or ever\nhad cancer); obesity (body mass indexes based on self-re-\nported height and weight information,  30 kg/m2) [36];\nsmoking (current smokers vs. non-smokers); alcohol con-\nsumption (moderate drinking -- up to two drinks per day\nfor men and one drink per day for women [37] during\nthe past month and heavy drinking -- more than mod-\nerate drinking vs. no drinking); and stress-induced over-\neating (those who endorsed either of the following two\nitems about \"how you respond when you are confronted\nwith difficult or stressful events in your life\": \"I eat more\nthan I usually do\" and \"I eat more of my favorite foods to\nmake myself feel better\").\ndefinition\"); and b) based on the quartiles of job control\nand psychological job demands (resulting in 16 possible\nmisclassification of the four quadrants of the DC model\naround the medians of job control and psychological job\ndemands.

It is quite\nconsistent with the contemporary minimum recommenda-\ntion of physical activity for US adults [1,3,4]: at least 5 days\nof week for moderate physical activity and at least 3 days\nper week for vigorous physical activity.

They had a 6-frequency based response set (sev-\neral times a week, once a week, several times a month,\nonce a month, less than once a month, and never). A pre-\nliminary analysis revealed little seasonal (summer vs. win-\nter) variation in responses to the vigorous and moderate\nphysical activity items: Spearman correlations were 0.90\nand 0.87, respectively.

In this study, high job control and\nits combinations with psychological job demands (active\njobs) were identified as possible facilitators of active LTPA\nin the US workers. However, some discrepancies in this\npattern of results were observed in stratified analyses\nby sex and education level. Particularly, in a subsample\nof male workers with only high school or lower education,\nwork hours greater than 40 hours per week and annual\nless active LTPA, while psychosocial work characteristics\nwere not associated with active LTPA. Psychological job\ndemands alone were not associated with active LTPA.\nThese results, if confirmed in prospective analyses, would\nindicate a new avenue for promoting active LTPA in mid-\ndle-aged US workers, i.e., increasing workers' on-the-job\nlearning opportunities and workers authority on their\ntasks. However, the lack of a beneficial effect of high job\ncontrol on men with lower levels of education needs to be\nexplored further.\nactive LTPA in the final model in which health conditions\nand health behaviors were also controlled for (Table 3),\nwith an odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI))\nassociated with active LTPA, as in the bivariate analysis.\nActive job (vs. passive job) based on the four group\ndefinition was significantly associated with active LTPA,\nafter controlling for other working conditions:\ntion was non-significant when additionally controlling\nfor socio-demographic variables (particularly education\nand annual household income) (Table 4).

The one exception\nwas low physical effort at work. It was not a significant con-\ntributor when controlling for socio-demographic variables\n(particularly education and annual household income)\n(Model 3 in Table 3).\nMultivariate associations with active LTPA\nby gender and education\nWe replicated the above multivariate analyses after strati-\nfying the data by sex and education. For a simpler analy-\nsis, we combined together the high and middle education\ngroups (called higher education group). So four sub-sam-\nples were created for the higher/low education groups\nin each of men and women (see Table 5).\nThere were no statistically significant interactions between\nsex, education, and psychological job demands on ac-\ntive LTPA (data not shown here).

However, the study\ndid not provide information about any variation in LTPA\namong the three non-active jobs (active, high strain, and\nlow strain), which would be useful for more fully explor-\ning the active-passive hypothesis of the DC model for\nactive LTPA.\nImplications for theories and policies\nStrictly speaking, this study did not support the active-\npassive hypothesis in that the prevalence of active LTPA\nwas greater in low strain jobs than in active jobs, which\nis a deviation from the predicted gradient of LTPA along\nthe active-passive axis. In other studies, LTPA was also\nmost prevalent in low strain jobs among the four quad-\nThese findings indicate that not only the active-passive\nhypothesis, but also the \"strain\" hypothesis (a low strain\njob would be least stressful while a high strain job would\nbe most stressful to workers) of the DC model may play\na role in active LTPA of workers. That is, the accumula-\ntion of strain in a high strain job could inhibit workers\nfrom engaging in LTPA. Landsbergis et al. [40, Figure 1]\nillustrated how the two distinct hypotheses could explain\nthe same health behavior via different mechanisms (work\nstrain vs. learned passivity) in workers. If the two mecha-\nnisms work together in reality and the relative importance\nof each mechanism could be determined in context, it\nmight be difficult to expect a clear gradient of LTPA along\nthe active-passive axis of the DC model in empirical stud-\nies. Future longitudinal epidemiological studies in which\nqualitative methods [41] are also employed to investigate\nthe two mechanisms in detail would be needed for testing\nthe above speculation.\nOn the other hand, this study implies that other work-\nrelated factors such as longer work hours and low annual\nhousehold income are important occupational determi-\nnants of LTPA and may be more important than the psy-\nchosocial work characteristics in less-educated male work-\ners. The importance of time and money [8] as material\nresources for off-the-job participation should not be ig-\nnored. Overtime, along with shift work and second job,\nComparisons with other studies\nThe results of this study were similar to those of the only\nother previous US study [15] from 32 worksites in Min-\nnesota, that is job control and active jobs were associated\nwith LTPA, but psychological job demands were not as-\nsociated with LTPA. Our study has some advantages over\nthe previous study. First, this study was based on a na-\ntional US survey, thus its results could be more generaliz-\nable to the US working population. Second, this study ad-\ndressed as its main outcome specifically the contemporary\nrecommended minimum level of physical activity for US\nadults [3,4]. In addition, this study revealed that associa-\ntions could be gender- and social status-specific. Thus its\nresults would be more informative in evaluating and estab-\nlishing public health policies for US adults.\nThe results of this study for job control and psychologi-\ncal job demands and LTPA are also consistent with those\nof the majority of non-US studies. Five studies [6,14\u00ad18]\nsupported the association between job control and LTPA\nat least in either men or women. Although one Japanese\nstudy [20] in 12 rural communities generally did not sup-\nport the association, it also reported a significant associa-\ntion between job control and LTPA in a subsample with\nfemale workers (farming and forestry, and fisheries). One\nstudy [12] from the United Kingdom did not support\nthe association, but limited variation in job control existed\namong its study subjects, which might make it harder to\ndetect an association. Only one study [6] reported a bivari-\nate association between high psychological job demands\nand LTPA. However, none of the other studies [12,14,\nish study [16] reported that a high level of psychological\njob demands (hectic job and psychologically demanding\njob) was a risk factor for sedentary LTPA in women.\nIn this study, although the association between active\njobs (vs. passive jobs) and active LTPA was supported\nin the whole sample, it was not supported in two out\nof the four subsamples. Similarly, the association has been\ninconsistent across the other studies or between men and\nsis [39] from the Whitehall II study reported that \"pas-\nsive jobs\" (vs. all non\u00adpassive jobs) is a risk factor for\nO R I G I N A L P A P E R S B. CHOI et al.\nrepresents certain racial and ethnic groups (e.g., blacks)\nand people with low level of education. Thus, interpreta-\ntions of the study results should be made in consideration\nof the \"selective\" characteristics of study subjects. Third,\nself-reported measures of psychosocial work character-\nistics and active LTPA could be vulnerable to self-report\nbias. However, the measures of job control and psycho-\nlogical job demands in this study were quite similar to\nthose of the JCQ, which has been extensively validated\nin several working populations including the US [49].\nAlthough the meanings of some items of the JCQ psy-\nchological job demands scale (work fast and work hard\nitems) [49,50] could be interpreted differently by social\nstatus (white collar vs. blue collar), our psychological job\ndemands measure did not include such items. In addi-\ntion, we minimized this possibility via a stratified analy-\nsis by education level and adjustment for physical effort\nat work. In addition, the information from single items\nbased on either a sweat episode or heart rate/breath-\nin this study, were validated against the information from\nlong physical activity questionnaires or a physical activity\nmonitor in US adults. So we do not believe that such self-\nreport bias, if any, would significantly bias our results.\n"
