LTPA was divided into four categories: (1) no LTPA; (2) irregular LTPA; (3) regular moderate intensity LTPA;\nand (4) regular vigorous intensity LTPA. OA was grouped as (1) high OA and (2) low OA.

Logistic regression revealed that compared to those who engage in no LTPA and have low levels of OA, the likelihood\nlower for those who have irregular LTPA and have high levels of OA, and about 50% lower for all those who have regular LTPA\nthrough moderate or vigorous activity levels regardless of OA level.\nCONCLUSION: When considering disease free adults above 20 y of age employed in high and low activity occupations, a high\nlevel of occupational activity is associated with a decreased likelihood of being obese.\nKeywords: obese; work; physical activity; cross-sectional; NHANES\nIntroduction\nIn Healthy People 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) established a national objective to reduce\nthe proportion of adults who are obese (body mass index,\nBMI ` 30) to 15%.1 According to data from the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III), one-third of the US population is overweight2\nand over one-\u00aefth of the population is considered obese.3\nObesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)\nand is commonly found in conjunction with other CVD risk\nfactors such as hypertension,4 type 2 diabetes,5,6 andaor\nhypercholesterolemia.7\nThere is little doubt that obesity in the United States has\nreached epidemic proportions8 and that each year there are\nsubstantial health care costs associated with obesity-related\npathologies.9 Many experts attribute the high prevalence of\nobesity to inactivity. Evidence from epidemiological and\ninterventional research shows that those engaged in higher\nlevels of physical activity have lower stores of body fat.10 An\nassociation between recreational activity and body weight\nwas seen by Williamson et al11 when analyzing 10 y follow-\nup data of men and women from NHANES I. After 10 y, BMI\nwas signi\u00aecantly higher in the lowest activity group com-\npared to those in the highest activity group.11 In addition to\nprotection from obesity, physical activity has other well-\nestablished positive effects on health.12 \u00b1 18 While physical\ninactivity during leisure-time is commonly associated with\nobesity, the amount of physical activity accumulated\nthrough occupational activity should also be considered.\nThe effects of occupational activity on pathologic condi-\ntions have been under investigation for some time.19 \u00b1 26 To\nour knowledge, there have been no studies investigating the\ninteraction between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and\noccupational activity (OA) and corresponding prevalence of\n*Correspondence: GA King, Kinesiology Program, The University of Texas\nE-mail: gking@utep.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nobesity. Based on the available literature, it can be hypothe-\nsized that those with the lowest levels of LTPA and OA will\nhave the highest prevalence of obesity while those with the\nhighest levels of LTPA and OA will have the lowest preva-\nlence of obesity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to\nassess the prevalence of obesity and its association with\nvarying levels of LTPA and OA.\nMethods\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a\nperiodic survey conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics. The third NHANES was conducted from 1988\nthrough 1994 and was the seventh in a series of surveys\nbased on a complex, multistage sample plan. It was designed\nto provide national estimates of the health and nutritional\nstatus of the United States' civilian, non-institutionalized\npopulation over the age of 2 months. A detailed description\nof the data collection has been previously published.27\nPhysical activity assessment\nDuring a comprehensive interview, respondents were asked\nto identify speci\u00aeed exercises in which they participated\nduring their leisure-time (jogging or running; riding a bicycle\nor exercise bicycle; swimming; aerobic dancing; other dan-\ncing; calisthenics or \u00afoor exercises; gardening or yard work;\nand weight lifting). They were then requested to specify the\nnumber of times they participated in an identi\u00aeed activity in\nrelation to the past month. Responses were standardized as\n`times per week' using the conversion factors 4.3 weeks per\nmonth and 30.4 days per month, then rounded to the\nnearest whole number. Those responses of 100 times per\nmonth or more were categorized as `100  '. The frequency of\nperformance of other reported exercises, sports or physically\nactive hobbies was also recorded. After administering the list\nof speci\u00aeed physical activities, interviewers probed for other\nexercises, sports or physical activities not mentioned.3 Infor-\nmation related to duration of activities was not collected and\nlimits this study.\nLTPA was divided into four categories using frequency and\nintensity as classi\u00aecation criteria. Each LTPA was classi\u00aeed\naccording to intensity level as de\u00aened by the Compendium\nof Physical Activities28 using the metabolic equivalent (MET)\nlevel corresponding to an individual activity. As previously\ndescribed by Pate et al,29 activities requiring between 1 and 3\nMETs were classi\u00aeed as `low intensity,' activities requiring\nbetween 3 and 6 METs were classi\u00aeed as `moderate intensity,'\nand those activities requiring 6 METs and above were classi-\n\u00aeed as `vigorous intensity.' Individuals who answered `no' to\nall LTPA questions were coded as having `no LTPA' and those\nwho participated in LTPA between 1 and 4 times per week of\nany intensity were coded as having `irregular LTPA.' Respon-\ndents, who participated in \u00aeve or more bouts of LTPA per\nweek were coded as `regular LTPA'. The `regular LTPA' group\nwas subdivided into those engaging in moderate (regular\nmoderate LTPA) and vigorous (regular vigorous LTPA) inten-\nsity activity. The de\u00aenition of regular LPTA ( ! 5 bouts per\nweek) was chosen to correspond with the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of\nSports Medicine (ACSM) frequency recommendation for\nphysical activity (`on most, if not all, days of the week').30\nOccupational activity assessment\nThe NHANES III database contains 498 reported occupations\nclassi\u00aeed into one of 235 different industrial categories based\ntions were then recoded within the NHANES III database\ninto 40 occupation categories. For this study, all individuals\nof a six-member committee independently examined each of\n498 occupations and grouped into those containing (a) high\noccupational activity (HOA), (b) low occupational activity\n(LOA), or (c) uncertain, based on the occupation description\nof the US Department of Labor.32,33 An occupation was\nlabeled as `uncertain' if the activity level was too ambiguous\nto classify. A nominal group process was used to gain 100%\ncommittee consensus on both HOA and LOA occupations. A\ntotal of 119 occupations in 17 occupation categories were\npositively identi\u00aeed as either HOA or LOA (7 and 10 cate-\ngories, respectively). Table 1 shows the occupation categories\nused for analysis.\nSample\nThe NHANES III database contains information on 33 994\nfor this study. Of those eligible, 16 284 completed both the\nhome interview and the clinical exam. Those individuals\ndiagnosed with heart disease, cancer, degenerative joint\ndisorders, or other pathologic conditions that may limit\nLTPA or work were excluded from the analysis. Inclusion of\napparently non-healthy individuals could have possibly\nskewed the data of the no LTPA and LOA groups, making\nTable 1 Occupation categories based on 1980 US census bureau\nclassi\u00aecation\nLow occupational activity High occupational activity\nExecutives, administrators and managers Waiters and waitresses\nManagement-related occupations Cleaning and building service\noccupations\nEngineers and scientists Farm and nursery workers\nTeachers Construction trades\nSecretaries, stenographers and typists Construction laborers\nInformation clerks Laborers, except construction\nRecords processing occupations Freight, stock and material\nmovers (hand)\nMaterial recording, scheduling and\ndistributing clerks\nMiscellaneous administrative support\noccupations\nMotor vehicle operators\nObesity prevalence\nGA King et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\ndifferences between groups unreliable. Elimination of\nunhealthy people allowed for a cleaner assessment of a\npossible direct association between total physical activity\nand obesity status and helped minimize selection bias\nerror. Additionally, only those individuals currently\nemployed in one of the 17 occupational categories identi\u00aeed\nas LOA or HOA (Table 1) were included in the study. A \u00aenal\nsample population of 4889 individuals was identi\u00aeed\nas meeting the requirements for this study. Individuals\nwere then classi\u00aeed as non-obese (BMI ` 30 kgam2) or\nobese (BMI ! 30 kgam2) as de\u00aened by the World Health\nStatistical analysis\nAnalysis of the data set was performed using the statistical\nprograms SAS and SUDAAN.35,36 All analyses incorporated\nsampling weights and the complex sampling design adopted\nby NHANES III.27,37 Age-adjusted prevalence rates were cal-\nculated using the direct method and were based on the total\nUS population for 1980. The dependant variable was obesity.\nThe primary independent variable was physical activity,\n(combinations of LTPA and OA levels). Eight possible com-\nbinations of LTPA and OA were coded for analysis. Other\nindependent variables that were statistically controlled\nincluded age, gender, race-ethnicity, socioeconomic status,\nsmoking status, alcohol consumption, and urbanization\nclassi\u00aecation. To determine the likelihood of obesity inde-\npendent of statistically controlled variables, a logistic regres-\nsion model was applied to the dataset. Each independent\nvariable was weighted and standardized to the general US\npopulation and analyzed with all other variables being con-\ntrolled. The referent group for gender was men; age was 20 \u00b1\n29 y; race-ethnicity was non-Hispanic white; income\nwas b $50 000; smoking status was non-smoker; urbaniza-\ntion classi\u00aecation was urban; and alcohol consumption was\nlight. The no LTPA and LOA group served as the referent\ngroup for the LTPA and OA interaction.\nResults\nTable 2 shows the sample size and the age-adjusted obesity\nprevalence rates within the disease-free adult population\nemployed in high and low activity occupations for gender,\nage, race-ethnicity, income and OA level. As a whole, 16.8%\nand 19.1% of women being obese (Table 2). The prevalence\nof obesity increased through age 59 and then began to\ndecline (Table 2). The prevalence of obesity was higher in\nnon-Hispanic blacks (23.4%) and Mexican Americans\nin the lowest annual income bracket had the highest pre-\nvalence of obesity (21.5%), while those in the highest\nincome category had the lowest obesity prevalence\n(15.9%); (Table 2). The prevalence of obesity was higher in\nthose with LOA levels (17.4%) compared to those with HOA\nThe prevalence of obesity within the age-adjusted disease-\nfree adult population above 20 y of age employed in high\nand low activity occupations for OA level and LTPA are\nshown in Table 3. Overall, 20.4% of those engaging in no\nLTPA were obese and the prevalence of obesity decreased\nLTPA, regular moderate LTPA, and regular vigorous LTPA,\nrespectively, Table 3). In relation to LTPA levels, 23.8% of all\nthose with LOA and engage in no LTPA were shown to be\nobese compared to 13.6% of all those with HOA and engage\nin no LTPA (Table 3; Figure 1).\nThe overall logistic regression analysis model was found\nto be highly signi\u00aecant (P ` 0.0001). The logistic regression\n(Table 4) revealed that the likelihood of being obese was\nlinked to other socio-cultural and lifestyle factors. The like-\nlihood of being obese increased with age up to about age\n60 y. Compared to non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks\nwere 68% more likely to be obese, and Mexican Americans\nwere 49% more likely to be obese. Annual income was\nunrelated to obesity prevalence in any income category\ncompared to those whose income was b $50 000 except for\nlikely to be obese. Additionally, it was found that current\nsmokers were less likely to be obese than ex- or non-smokers\nand neither urbanization classi\u00aecation or alcohol consumption\nin\u00afuenced the likelihood of being obese.\nTable 2 Sample size and obesity prevalence for gender, age, race-\nethnicity, income and occupational activity level of the disease-free adult\npopulation above 20 y of age employed in high and low activity\noccupations\nObesity prevalence (%)\nn % (s.e.)\nGender\nAge (y)\nRace-ethnicity\nOccupational activity\nLOA  low occupational activity; HOA  high occupational activity.\nObesity prevalence\nGA King et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nThe likelihood of being obese was strongly associated with\nLTPA and OA (Table 4). Those who engaged in no LTPA and\nhad HOA were 42% less likely to be obese compared to those\nwho engaged in no LTPA and had LOA. The likelihood of\nbeing obese for those who engaged in irregular LTPA and had\nLOA was similar to those who engaged in no LTPA and had\nLOA. Those who engaged in irregular LTPA and had HOA\nand those who engaged in regular LTPA with moderate or\nvigorous activity were about half as likely to be obese than\nthe no LTPA and LOA group. The greatest reduction in the\nlikelihood of being obese was seen in the regular moderate\nLTPA and LOA group (73%) compared to the no LTPA and\nLOA group (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nIt appears that a physically active occupation has a protec-\ntive effect on the likelihood of being obese for the disease-\nfree adult population above 20 y of age employed in high\nand low activity occupations independent of gender, age,\nrace-ethnicity, socioeconomic status, smoking status, urba-\nnization classi\u00aecation and alcohol consumption. For those\nindividuals who engage in no LTPA or irregular LTPA, the\nlikelihood of being obese can be reduced by as much as one-\nhalf with a physically active occupation (Table 4).\nThe major \u00aending of this study is seen with the interac-\ntion between LTPA and OA. Having a highly active occupa-\ntion reduced the likelihood of being obese by 42% even\nwithout participation in any LTPA (Table 4). The likelihood\nof being obese was similar between those who had sedentary\noccupations and engaged in either no LTPA or LTPA less than\nperson participating in irregular LTPA, a highly active occu-\npation reduced the likelihood of being obese by almost 50%\ncompared to those who were sedentary during both work\nTable 3 Age-adjusted obesity prevalence by leisure-time physical activity level (LTPA) for selected occupational activity (OA) level of the disease-free\nadult population above 20 y of age employed in high and low activity occupations\nObesity prevalence (%)\nNo LTPA Irregular LTPA Regular LTPA moderate Regular LTPA vigorous\nn % (s.e.) n % (s.e.) n % (s.e.) n % (s.e.)\nOccupational activity\nNo LTPA  ` 1 boutaweek; irregular LTPA  between 1 and 4 boutsaweek; regular LTPA  ! 5 boutsaweek with moderate (regular moderate LTPA) or vigorous\n(regular vigorous LTPA) activity.

Once the frequency of LTPA was suf\u00aecient\nto meet the CDCaACSM recommendations ( ! 5 bouts per\nweek), the likelihood of obesity remained about 50% less\nregardless of the level of OA, emphasizing the importance of\nregular physical activity.\nIt should be noted that the actual intensity level of an\noccupation was not measured and the energy cost of an\noccupation was not quanti\u00aeed. The methods used to cate-\ngorize occupations classi\u00aeed each only as being of a generally\nhigh or low activity level. The conversion of OA from a\ncategorical to a continuous variable would most likely\nstrengthen the in\u00afuence of OA on obesity prevalence.\nIt is also important to point out that the duration of\nLTPA was not reported within the survey and therefore, it\nis impossible to quantify total energy expenditure. The\ndiscrepancy in odds ratio between the regular moderate\nLTPA and regular vigorous LTPA groups (OR 0.27, 95% CI\ncompared to no LTPA and LOA) may possibly be the result\nof differing total energy expenditures related to the dura-\ntion of activity rather than the intensity of the activity.\nSince individual group differences were not empirically\ntested, comparisons can only be made to the referent\ngroup. However, based on the overlapping 95% CI of the\nregular moderate LTPA and regular vigorous LTPA, these\ngroups do not appear to be signi\u00aecantly different from\neach other.\nAn additional limitation is the categorization of irregular\nLTPA, de\u00aened for this study as one to four bouts of physical\nactivity per week. It could be argued that a person who\nparticipates in physical activity four times per week is a\nregular exerciser. We de\u00aened LTPA categories based on fre-\nquency of participation to coincide with the CDCaACSM\nphysical activity guidelines for frequency as most days of the\nweek. This was interpreted to mean a majority of days of the\nweek (\u00aeve or more). The results of this study show that the\nlikelihood of being obese is similar between the no LTPA and\nirregular LTPA groups with sedentary occupations (OR 0.78,\nclassify LTPA categories and emphasizes the important ben-\ne\u00aets of a physically active occupation and the bene\u00aets of\nregular activity during leisure-time.\nPrevious studies have used the NHANES database as a\nnationally representative sample of the US popula-\nthe effects of OA and LTPA in a currently employed US\nnational sample while controlling for several confounding\nvariables. Previous studies of NHANES III report the preva-\nlence of physical inactivity as 22% (17% for men and 27% for\nwomen)3,38 and a number of socio-cultural variables appear\nto in\u00afuence the prevalence of LTPA. Previously it has been\nreported that physical activity levels are higher in younger\ncompared to older individuals, higher with increased socio-\neconomic status, and that ethnic minorities tend to have a\nhigher prevalence of inactivity compared to non-Hispanic\nbetween the prevalence of physical inactivity and social\nclass derived from occupation, education and income. In\nthe sample we analyzed, the prevalence of no LTPA is\napproximately 10% lower for currently employed non-His-\npanic blacks and Mexican Americans compared to all non-\nHispanic blacks and Mexican Americans in the general US\npopulation.38 It is possible that the socio-cultural in\u00afuence\nof employment may induce the differences in the prevalence\nof physical inactivity seen between the general US popula-\ntion and the current sample of those employed in occupa-\ntions with high or low levels of physical activity, although\nthis was not tested in this study.\nTable 4 Odds risk ratio for obesity among disease-free adults employed\nin high and low activity occupations\nVariable Odds ratio Lower Upper\nGender\nAge (y)\nRace-ethnicity\nSmoking\nUrbanization classi\u00aecation\nAlcohol consumption\nNo LTPA  ` 1 boutaweek; irregular LTPA  between 1 and 5 boutsaweek;\nregular LTPA  ! 5 boutsaweek with moderate (regular moderate LTPA) or\nvigorous (regular vigorous LTPA) activity. LOA  low occupational activity;\nHOA  high occupational activity.\nObesity prevalence\nGA King et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nSimilar to physical inactivity, the prevalence of obesity is\nsuggested to be inversely related to education, socioeco-\nnomic status, and cultural in\u00afuences.2,40 Analysis of the\nNHANES III database shows that for the general US popula-\ntion above age 20 y, the prevalence of obesity\n(BMI b 30 kgam2) was reported to be approximately 20% for\nmen and 25% for women.3 Our study found the prevalence\nof obesity for the disease-free adults above 20 y of age\nemployed in high and low activity occupations to be\nprevalence of obesity within the present sample was\nexpected because only disease-free individuals were included\nin the analysis. The elimination of those with obesity related\npathologies (for example hypertension, diabetes, heart dis-\nease) most likely removed a portion of the obese population.\nAlso, a majority of the currently employed population main-\ntained occupations too ambiguous to classify as having high\nor low activity levels. The elimination of ambiguous occupa-\ntions again most likely remove a portion of the obese\npopulation but should have also removed a proportional\nnumber of the non-obese population and should not have\naffected the \u00aenal sample. The logistic regression model\napplied in this study found race-ethnicity to in\u00afuence obe-\nsity prevalence while income did not, independent of age,\nsmoking status, urbanization classi\u00aecation, alcohol con-\nsumption and occupation. While no causal in\u00afuence can\nbe drawn from these \u00aendings, these data suggest that there\nare other underlying factors that in\u00afuence the prevalence\nof obesity between race-ethnicity groups besides those\ncontrolled for in this study.\nA number of previous studies have focused on all-cause or\nCVD mortality and morbidity rates or cardiovascular event\nthose previous studies, body composition was reported as a\ncontributing variable rather than the major variable of\ninterest. This is the \u00aerst study to compare the combined\neffects of varying levels of physical activity during work and\nleisure-time on the prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor\nfor CVD and contributor to a number of chronic pathologies.\nAs with other cross-sectional data of this type, causality\ncannot be determined. While it may be hypothesized that\nlower activity levels lead to obesity, it is also possible that\nobese individuals select less active jobs and leisure-time\npursuits. In light of this, the information from this study\nmay facilitate health promotion planners to develop work\nsite intervention activities and programs towards those\nworkers within a company at the greatest risk of obesity\nand obesity-related pathologies.\nThere is little question as to the importance of physical\nactivity for long-term weight management and our study\nprovides further evidence that the positive effects of activity\nare from the accumulation of total daily energy expenditure.\nThe results of this study do not discount the importance of\nregular LTPA and everyone should be encouraged to engage\nin regular exercise. What is suggested by this study is that\nactivity derived through a physically active occupation can\nreduce the likelihood of being obese, especially for those\nwho participate in little or no physical activity during their\nleisure-time. For those individuals who do not engage in\nLTPA, the likelihood of being obese can be reduced by about\nhalf if they maintain a physically active occupation.\nReferences\n1 US Department of Health and Human Services.
