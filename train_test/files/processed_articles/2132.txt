It has\nbeen hypothesized that students who follow healthy habits\nregarding exercise and nutrition decrease their chances of\nbecoming obese in adulthood (Liou, Liou, & Chang, 2010).\nSome school policymakers and nurses believe that the adop-\ntion of a supportive school environment (SSE) program, one\nthat includes increased fruits and vegetables available at the\ncafeteria and a variety of available forms of exercise and re-\ncreation, increase opportunities for students to practice healthy\nhabits and decrease their chances of developing obesity\n(Cassady, Vogt, Oto-Kent, Mosley, & Lincoln, 2006; Vitale,\n2010). Body mass index (BMI) is the current standard\nmeasure of obesity in adolescents (Lin & Lam, 2011; Liou\net al., 2010). However, a standardized BMI z score often is\nconsidered a more accurate measure of an individual teen's\nMultiple observational studies have examined these hypotheses\nwith conflicting results (Liou et al., 2010).\nAn observational study, like an experimental study, is\nan empirical study conducted to explain a cause-and-effect\nrelationship between two variables (Cochran, 1965; Little &\nliterature, the term ``quasi-experimental study'' is used more\ncommonly than observational study to describe a study\nthat lacks the critical causal element of random assignment\n(Guo & Fraser, 2010). In Clayton, Chin, Blackburn, and\nEcheverria's (2010) prospective quasi-experimental study, a\ndifference was found in obesity rates between groups after\na healthy habits program was offered at school.

Randomized and multilevel randomized control\ntrials to study the effect of healthy habit interventions on\nadolescents' BMI (de Heer, Koehly, Pederson, & Morera,\net al., 2010) were equivocal in findings.\nTo estimate the causal effect of students' healthy habits\non their development of obesity in young adulthood and\nthe effect of an SSE on students' practice of healthy habits, a\nmultilevel potential outcomes model is required to account\nfor the natural nesting of the teenage students within the\nschools they attend.

Multilevel modeling also allows\nfor variance component estimates to be examined explicitly\nat each level of the proposed model (Albright, 2007; Albright\nA potential outcomes framework at each level of the\nmultilevel model allows for causal inference regarding these\nfactors and not simply comparison across groups (Pearl,\nmechanism of treatment assignment that observational stud-\nies and most random experiments usually do not. Assign-\nment to treatment in an observational study is not random,\nalthough sampling from a population of interest often is;\nwhereas assignment to treatment in random experiments is\nassigned randomly, yet sampling from the population of in-\nterest is not a random process (Little & Rubin, 2000). Pro-\npensity score estimates allow for potential outcomes inference\nby accounting for manipulation of treatment assignment.\nThere can be no causal inference without manipulation of\nRubin's (1974) counterfactual causal model approaches\ncausal modeling with a fundamental assumption of poten-\nRubin, 1974). This theory asserts that there is one potential\noutcome associated with each treatment a subject may receive.\nFor the following example, Y denotes an individual subject's\npotential outcome and Z denotes treatment assignment. If\nthere are two alternate treatments (a binary treatment con-\ndition), then each subject has two potential outcomes repre-\nsented commonly in the potential outcomes literature as\nY(0) and Y(1). Specifically, Y(0) is the outcome for a subject\nwho does not receive the treatment (i.e., Z = 0), whereas\nY(1) is the outcome if the subject does receive the treatment\n(i.e., Z = 1). However, one never gets to observe both of\nthese potential outcomes, as the subject can receive only one\ntreatment at a time (Rubin, 2004). Therefore, the causal\neffect Y(1) j Y(0) cannot be estimated for an individual,\nbut only an average effect for a group of people.\nIn a randomized experiment, the observed outcomes of\nthe subjects in the sample can be used to estimate an average\ntreatment effect conditioned on treatment assigned. An un-\nbiased estimate of the average treatment effect E[Yi\nYi\n(0)] = E[Yi\n(1)] j E[Yi\n(0)] within an observed population\nsample is the difference in observed outcomes in the two\ndistinct treatment groups. Therefore, in a randomized exper-\niment, if Z stands for treatment assignment, then the aver-\nage treatment effect E[Yi\n(1)] j E[Yi\n(0)] can be estimated as\nE[Yi\n(1)] = E[Yi\n= 1] and E[Yi\n(0)] = E[Yi\ncan then obtain an unbiased estimate of the average treat-\nment effect by estimating E[Yi\n(1)] with Y\nj\nand E[Yi\nwith Y\nj\n.\nThe assumptions of the potential outcomes model are ig-\nnorability of treatment assignment and stable unit treatment\nvalue. Treatment assignment is ignorable when the potential\noutcomes are independent of the treatment variable, as is\nthe case with randomized assignment to treatment (Rubin,\n2004). The stable unit treatment value (SUTVA) is the as-\nsumption that there is only one potential outcome for each\nsubject associated with the policy or treatment adopted,\nwith no effect on an individual subject's potential outcome\ndue to the policy or treatment given another subject (Rubin,\n1986). The assumption of SUTVA at the school level is\nplausible because schools in the proposed nationally sam-\npled data set are located in distinct communities with dif-\nferent geographic conditions; have various combinations of\nsocioeconomic levels, governmental resources, and political\naffiliations in the community profiles; and span the conti-\nnental United States. Here, an assumption that the identities\nand treatment assignments of other schools are uninforma-\ntive about student i's outcomes holds (SUTVA assumption\nat the school level).\nHowever, Rubin (1990) cautioned that SUTVA becomes\nproblematic when treatments are given to children who in-\nteract with one another, as in an observational study wherein\nstudent-level treatment is nested within school-level program\nadoption. To account for the possible violation of a strict\ninterpretation of SUTVA at the student level within a multi-\nlevel setting, the Hong and Raudenbush (2006) relaxed\nform of SUTVA can be applied. For a binary treatment, let\nzi\n= 1 if student i practices healthy habits and zi\n= 0 if the\nstudent does not. Then, given N units overall in a school,\nthere is a 1 \u00c2 N vector of possible treatment assignments\n, ..., zN\n) = (zi\n, z_i\n), wherein z_i\nvector of treatment assignments with zi\nremoved, for\nZi\n2f0; 1g; i \u00bc 1; :::; N. Under these set conditions, subject i\nhas 2N potential outcomes, Yi\n(z), corresponding to all pos-\nsible treatment assignments of the N subjects.\nA contrast between any two of the 2N potential outcomes\nfor a given subject is a causal effect. The SUTVA is a dis-\ntinctive case wherein Yi\n(z) K Yi\n(zi\n, z_i\n) = Yi\n(zi\n), demonstrat-\ning that an individual student's potential outcome, given all\nother student treatments, remains the same under SUTVA.\nTo summarize the school program adoption information in\na way that will be useful for average causal estimates, the\nimpact of z (treatment assignment) on a single subject's po-\ntential outcome can be modeled as operating through zi\n(individual's treatment assignment) as well as through a\nsimple function of z_i\n, which will be denoted as v(z), the\ntreatment assignments of all other students within an indi-\nvidual's school, except the individual's assignment. This is\nrepresented as\n^\nYi\n\u00f0z\u00de K ^\nYi\n\u00f0zi\n; z\u00c0i\n\u00de \u00bc ^\nYi\n\u00bdzi\n; v\u00f0z\u00de \u00f01\u00de\nE{Y[z,v(z)] jY[z\u00b6,v(z\u00b6)]} is a generic causal estimand,\nwherein z and z\u00b6 are alternative treatment assignments for\nan individual and z and z\u00b6 are alternative treatment as-\nsignments for all individuals within that group (Hong &\nRaudenbush, 2006). For the purposes of the SSE policy, let\nv(z) = 1 if a school is an SSE policy school and v(z) = 0 if\nthis is not the case. Now, Y(z,v(z)) can take on four pos-\nTherefore, the potential outcomes for an individual\nstudent i attending a school j, denoted by Yij\n(zij\n, vj\n), could\ntake on four values: Yij\nFor example, Yij\n(1,1) represents the potential outcome of a\nstudent i who practices healthy habits from an SSE school,\nand Yij\n(1,0) is the potential outcome of a student i who\npractices healthy habits from a non-SSE policy school.\nThrough the use of the relaxed form of SUTVA outlined\nabove and the propensity score estimates for a potential\noutcomes framework of causal estimates (Rosenbaum &\nCopyright @ 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nRubin, 1984) outlined in the next section, causal effects of\ntreatment on a student-level outcome variable of interest\ncan be estimated. This causal modeling methodology allows\nschool assignment and peer treatments to affect potential\noutcomes within a framework that accounted for the natural\nnesting of the data and did not violate assumptions required\nfor these estimates.\nSupportive school environment policies are not assigned\nat random to schools, and students within schools are not\nassigned at random to be practice of healthy habits, so the\nignorability of treatment assignment assumption must be\nconsidered. A propensity score is the conditioning on covar-\niates of an observed probability for receiving the treatment.\nAs such, if there is no hidden bias, then the conditional dis-\ntribution of treatment assignment is uniform and treatment\nassignment is ignorable (Rosenbaum, 2002).\nLet X be a vector of student-level covariates and W be a\nvector of school-level covariates. W includes the school-level\naggregates of student-level covariates such as the demographic\nmakeup of students attending a school. Causal inferences\nare possible if treatment assignments are ignorable within\nlevels of covariates (wherein X = x and W = w) for schools\nsuch that\nE\u00bdY\u00f0z; 3\u00dejZ \u00bc z; V \u00bc v; X \u00bc x; W \u00bc w\n\u00bc E\u00bdY\u00f0z; v\u00dejX \u00bc x; W \u00bc w \u00f02\u00de\nIn this case, the conditional average causal effect E[Y(z,\nv)|X = x,W = w] j E[Y(z\u00b6, v\u00b6)|X = x, W = w] is equivalent\nto the observed data estimand, E[Y(z,v)|Z = z, V = v, X = x,\nW = w] j E[Y(z\u00b6,v\u00b6)|Z = z\u00b6, V = v\u00b6, X = x, W = w].

Conditioning on covariates, schools adopting\na policy (V = 1 or V = 0) is influenced by W (school-level\ncovariates) with a probability Q = Q (W); thus,\nIf the assignment of schools to a zero or non-SSE policy\nis ignorable given the observed school-level pretreatment co-\nvariates W, then an unbiased estimate of school j's propensity\nof selecting an SSE policy, Qj\n, can be made as a function of Wj\n.\nLet q be the probability that a student practices healthy\nhabits according to the school SSE policy within the school\nthat student attends. This could be written as\nIf student practice or nonpractice of healthy habits, under\nan SSE or a non-SSE policy, is ignorable given the observed\nstudent-level pretreatment covariates X and the school-level\ncovariates W, then student i's propensity of practicing\nhealthy habits in school j, denoted by q1ij\nif the school has\nadopted an SSE policy and by q0ij\notherwise, can be esti-\nmated as functions of Xi\nand Wj\n. Hence q1\n(X, W) and\n(X, W), wherein\n; X; W\u00de\nA student's probability of practicing a specific treatment\n(practice of healthy habits or nonpractice of healthy habits)\nunder a specific school program (SSE or not) can be expressed\nas P(Z = z, V = v|X, W) = P(Z = z|V = v, X,W)P(V = v|W).\nIf these potential outcomes are considered carefully, it is\nclear that not all of the four potential outcomes are defined\nfor some of the students. A student who may practice healthy\nhabits in an SSE policy school may not have such a propen-\nsity in a non-SSE, and another student may never practice\nhealthy habits (even within a school with an SSE policy).\nMonotonicity, described by Angrist (1990), is applied here\nas the assumption that the probability of practicing healthy\nhabits in an SSE policy school is always greater than or\nequal to that within a non-SSE policy school. To address\nthis natural distinction into subpopulations of students, the\nmonotonicity assumption regarding the student level propen-\nsity score estimates (q1\n), wherein q1\ndenotes a stu-\ndent's probability of practicing healthy habits under an SSE\npolicy and q0\ndenotes the student's probability of practicing\nhealthy habits under a non-SSE policy was applied. As mono-\ntonicity is plausible in this case, three subpopulations of\nstudents of interest can be identified within the data set,\nnoted as Subpopulations A, B, and C. The potential outcomes\nand the causal effects of interest for each of these subpopu-\nlations are listed in Table 1.\nThis results in the following causal estimands: The aver-\nage causal effect of practice of healthy habits relative to non-\npractice of healthy habits, conditioned on the covariates (X\nand W), under a non-SSE policy for students in Subpop-\nulation A (students with propensity of practicing healthy\nhabits in a non-SSE school), may be expressed as\nAlso, the average conditional practice of healthy habits ef-\nfect under an SSE policy for students in Subpopulation A and\nthose in Subpopulation B.

(b) What are the\ncausal effects of a student's practice of healthy habits in a\nnon-SSE on the student's BMI?

The\nWave I covariates that were hypothesized to affect either of\nthe treatment variables at their corresponding level or the\noutcome variable of interest were included in the propen-\nsity score estimates for the assumption of ignorability of\ntreatment assignment to hold (Gelman & Hill, 2006).\nThese variables at the school level included measures of\nparents' average socioeconomic status, school district avail-\nable resources in dollars and space, teacher and adminis-\ntrator demographics, geographic location of school, and\ntype of neighborhood (rural, urban, suburban; Table 2). At\nthe student level, the covariates used in the propensity score\nestimates included student age, gender, ethnicity, number\nof people in household, club affiliation, measures of self-\nworth, body image, behaviors regarding alcohol and tobacco,\nfriends' behaviors regarding alcohol, grades, and parental\ninfluence regarding teen's choices and daily habits (Table 3).\nq\nTABLE 1.

The goal of balancing is to verify that subclassifi-\ncation on the estimated propensity score removes any initial\nbias on confounders. Balance on covariates was checked\nusing multiple two-way analyses of variance, wherein treat-\nment (SSE school assignment or practice of healthy habits,\nfor Q and q, respectively) was one factor, the propensity\nscore strata to which the individual was assigned was a second\nfactor (coded as a categorical variable with four levels), and\neach of the covariates (or confounders) was a dependent\nvariable. These balancing steps were repeated until balance\nwas achieved or until no further improvement in balance\ncould be made (Yanovitzky, Zanutto, & Hornik, 2005).\nHowever, reliance on significance testing to check for\ncovariate balance is sensitive to sample size (Shadish, Clark,\nThe minimum value of the logit of q1\n(constructed from\nthe data set) for the practice of healthy habits students\nattending SSE schools was then used as the cutoff point to\nidentify students from Subpopulation C (students unlikely\nto practice healthy habits even in an SSE). These students\nwere omitted from the causal analysis, because they did not\nhave the potential outcomes related to the causal question\nof interest. Students whose logit of q1\nwas above the cutoff\nvalue were considered to belong to Subpopulations A or B\n(students who have a propensity to practice healthy habits)\nand were combined into a subpopulation of AB.\nSimilarly, students from non-SSE policy schools whose\nlogit was below the minimum cutoff for any practice of\nhealthy habits students were excluded from the sample used\nin the causal estimates, leaving only students from Subpop-\nulation A (students with a propensity to practice healthy\nhabits even in non-SSE policy schools).\nAfter the initial estimate of causal effects by propensity\nscore stratification, the clustering of students within schools\nwas modeled with two hierarchical linear models using HLM\n6 software.

Balance was achieved on over 95% of\nthe school-level pretreatment covariates. On the basis of\nthe logit of the Q estimate, the sample of schools (n = 164)\nwas divided into five strata. The results of the analysis are\ndisplayed in Table 4.

Students who had\nlower propensity estimates to practice healthy habits were\nmore likely to be students born outside of the United States,\nwatched more hours of television, ate less meals per week\nwith parents, had more friends who drank alcohol\nregularly, and made their own choices regarding time to\nsleep on school nights.\nStudent propensity for practice of healthy habits within\nan SSE school, q1\n, was estimated through a logistic\nregression model for children attending SSE schools only.\nBalance was achieved on 95% of the student-level pretreat-\nment covariates believed to effect the treatment or outcome\nvariable. A graph representing the distribution of students\naccording to the propensity score estimates of practicing\nhealthy habits from an SSE school is presented in Figure 3.\nOn the basis of the logit of the q1\nestimate, the sample of\nstudents (n = 1,495) was divided into five strata. There was\na higher propensity for students who practiced healthy\nhabits to have more frequent medical and dental exams, to\nFIGURE 1.

The value of j3.341 was used as the cutoff\npoint to identify the 20 non-healthy habits students in SSE\nschools belonging to Subpopulation C, because there were\nno practice of healthy habits students with a logit less than\nor equal to j3.341. The minimum value of the logit of\nq\n(j2.43 ) was used as the cutoff point to identify the\n21 students attending non-SSE schools belonging to Sub-\npopulation C, bringing the Subpopulation C total sample\nsize to 42. The remaining sample size for students in\nSubpopulation AB in SSEs was 1,475, and the sample size\nfor students identified as belonging to Subpopulation A in\nThe raw difference in the average BMI score outcome was\nobserved across strata for students in Subpopulation AB in\nnon-SSE schools, and an estimate of the overall differences in\nBMI was calculated (Table 5). The mean differences in BMI\nwere not significant within the strata. The raw difference in\nthe average BMI score outcome was observed across strata\nfor students in Subpopulation A in SSE schools, and the\naverage mean difference was not significant (Table 6).\nThe causal estimands of interest %z0\nwere then\nobtained with a hierarchical two-level regression model,\nstudents at Level 1 within school at Level 2 (Tables 7 and 8).\nThe raw difference results in BMI outcomes were supported\nwith the causal estimates of the effect of practicing healthy\nhabits obtained with the hierarchical linear model estimates.\nThe causal effect of practicing healthy habits within a non-SSE\nschool, %z0\n, for students in Subpopulation A was 0.16 (SE =\n0.14).

To obtain these causal\nestimates, the distribution of covariates between the units\nof comparison at both school and student levels and the\nnatural clustering of students within schools was consid-\nered in the potential outcome models with a relaxed form\nAt the school level of this data, the estimated distribution\nof the logit for adopting an SSE policy allowed for com-\nparison between types of schools. Most schools were non-\nSSE; the SSE-identified schools appear to have a dichotomous\ndistribution, with approximately half of the schools profiling\nas private schools with high SES and resources and the other\nhalf profiling as larger public schools with lower income and\nresources. The private schools have tuition resources, and the\nfederally and state funded programs may be funding the\nlarger, economically less-advantaged public schools, resulting\nin the emergence of these two profiles of SSE schools.\nAt the student level of the sample, there were two\npropensity score estimates obtained empirically, the first\nfrom children attending non-SSE schools. The\nstudents within the non-SSEs who practiced healthy habits\ndid differ from their non-healthy habits practice peers on\nmany covariates of interest, but a strong profile did not\nemerge. The second student-level estimate, q1\n, was obtained\nempirically from students who attended SSE schools. The\nstudents within these schools also differed when compared\nbetween students who practiced healthy habits and those\nwho did not.\nThe results, although not statistically significant, sup-\nport the finding that SSE has a positive effect on students\nwith a propensity for practicing healthy habits in SSE and\nnon-SSE schools. Random assignment to treatment allows\nfor causal inference if the sample size is sufficient (Pearl,\n2003). This study had a larger sample size, in both levels of\nthe treatment, than previous multilevel randomized control\ntrials that studied the effect of exercise and eating habits on\nadolescents' BMI and BMI z scores and unlike the random-\nized studies accounted for ignorability of treatment assign-\nment at both levels of the model (DeBar et al., 2011; de Heer\nfindings may be due to low power as the Level 2 sample size\nwas only n = 18 for SSE schools. However, one strategic\nadvantage of propensity score estimates for causal inference,\nover simple matching and regression techniques, is that it\nprovides a one-factor covariate comprised of all other\nhypothesized predictor covariates, allowing for stratification\nq\nTABLE 5.

A dependent measure\nmore proximal in time than the 6-year lag BMI used in this\nanalysis would add to causal inference estimates. Body mass\nindex is not considered by some experts to be the best\nmeasure for adolescent obesity, so a standardized BMI z\nscore may be a more accurate measure of an individual\nteen's obesity (Rausch et al., 2011). However, although BMI\nand BMI z score are the most current measures of childhood\nobesity, these are not direct measures of body fat. Other\nmeasures such as percentage of body fat and bioelectrical\nimpedance analysis are being proposed by some obesity\nresearchers as more valid obesity assessment tools (Boylan\net al., 2010). Alternative or multiple obesity measures should\nq\nTABLE 8.

A continuous measure-\nment level of SSE as opposed to a binary assignment may be\nhelpful in adding information regarding the causal effect of\nvarying levels of SSE on students' BMIs. The results obtained\nwith this research cannot be generalized to students in Sub-\npopulation C. Subpopulation C will require a different causal\nmodel. Although small (n = 41), this subpopulation needs\nto be considered in healthy habits policy and program\nadoption research to decrease adulthood obesity. A further\nlimitation of this research was that most variables at both\nlevels were from self-reported survey data, with the exception of\nmeasured heights and weights for the outcome BMI variable.\nMultilevel modeling can be achieved with multiple types\nof software, such as HLM, Mplus, MLwiN, SAS PROC\nMIXED, STATA, R, and IBM SPSS 19 and 20. Versions of\nHLM, like MLwiN and R, are available for free, an ap-\npealing consideration when allocating research funding.\nHLM allows for specification of the model at each level\nseparately, such as at the student and school levels, and does\nnot require the researcher to derive a single equation spec-\nification (Singer, 1998). This can be quite helpful to the\nnonexpert quantitative researcher by providing explicit\nnotation of the theorized variables at each level and avoid-\ning the common omission of cross-level interactions. HLM\ndoes derive and display the singular multiple-level equation,\nin addition to the individual-level equations. HLM, like\nMLwiN, does not require command input in syntax, making\nit appealing to many nonstatistician researchers. There are\nmanuscripts and books available that provide a thorough\ndiscussion of the various software products available to model\nmultilevel research (Albright, 2007; Albright & Marinova,\nMultilevel modeling accounts for the natural clustering\nof students within schools and can be used to estimate the\nvariance components at each level of the model, allowing\nresearchers to examine distinct phenomena and socio-\necological factors. However, multilevel modeling without\na causal framework will not produce cause-and-effect rela-\ntionship answers. The inclusion of propensity score estimates\nat both levels of the model, with a relaxed form of SUTVA at\nthe student level, can meet the assumptions required to es-\ntablish a cause and effect relationship.\nPropensity score estimates for causal inference need to\nbe used in consideration of potential limitations. Ignorability\nof treatment assignment is an untestable assumption for all\ncausal inference modeling and may be violated if an unob-\nserved relevant covariate is omitted from the model (Pearl,\nregarding plausibility of assumptions being tenable, but\nconfidence in causal conclusions must be viewed by their\nconsistency with findings of other evidence in addition to\nhow sensitive the conclusions are to reasonable devia-\ntions. Propensity score estimates, like experimental stud-\nies, work better with larger samples, as a covariate in a\nsmall sample may be unbalanced enough between two\ngroups to make the samples nonequivalent (Rubin, 1997).\nBalancing can be observed with a variety of methods on ob-\nserved covariates only (Yanovitzky et al., 2005 ). The SUTVA\nassumption may not be tenable in multilevel settings. This\nviolation can be addressed by a relaxation of SUTVA as done\nin this study. The primary limitation with propensity score\nestimates, as with all causal inference, remains the inability\nto test if a relevant covariate was eliminated from the model\nevidence over multiple studies supports causal conclusions.\nCause-and-effect relationships in a multilevel setting are\noften the relationships nurse researchers want to test. Various\nconstraints of resources, ethics, and political opposition often\npreclude the design of treatment effect studies that meet the\nassumptions for causal inference. Propensity scores can pro-\nvide these estimates in observational settings and can be\nproduced with the use of spreadsheet software that has basic\nstatistical functions, making a causal modeling approach of\nanalysis readily available to most researchers. q\nThe author thanks the Educational Psychology Department at the\nGraduate Center CUNY for its approval of this study and Dr. David\nRindskopf, PhD, a distinguished professor at the Graduate Center of\nthe City University of New York, for his suggestions in the design of\nthis study and in the analysis of the data.\nThe author has no funding or conflicts of interest to disclose.\nCorresponding author: Patricia Eckardt, PhD, School of Nursing, Health\nSciences Center, Level 2, Room 247, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook,\nReferences\nAlbright, J.
