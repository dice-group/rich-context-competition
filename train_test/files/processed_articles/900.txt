Social support and social networks have been shown to exert significant effects on health and functioning among\nelderly persons. Although theorists have speculated that the strength of these effects may differ as a function of sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics and prior health status, few studies have directly tested the moderating effects of these variables.\nMethods. Longitudinal data from the MacArthur Study of Successful Aging were used to examine the effects of structural\nand functional social support on changes in physical functioning over a 7-year period, measured by the Nagi scale, in a sample\nof initially high-functioning men and women aged 70 to 79 years. Multiple regression analyses were used to test the main ef-\nfects of social support and social network variables, as well as their interactions with gender, income, and baseline physical per-\nformance.\nResults. After controlling for potential confounding effects, respondents with more social ties showed less functional de-\ncline. The beneficial effects of social ties were stronger for respondents who were male or had lower levels of baseline physical\nperformance.\nDiscussion. The effects of social support and social networks may vary according to the individual's gender and baseline\nphysical capabilities. Studies of functional decline among elderly persons should not ignore this population variation in the ef-\nfects of social networks.\nTHE aging of the United States population, recent develop-\nments in medical treatment, and improvements in health\nbehaviors have resulted in a dramatic increase in the elderly\npopulation. Unfortunately, many elderly people experience\nfunctional disabilities that compromise their quality of life, so\nthe added years of life can be marred by physical impairment.\nAs a consequence, preservation of functional independence in\nelderly persons has become an important goal of medical re-\nsearch. Although it was once commonly believed that func-\ntional decline was inevitable in old age, recent studies have re-\nvealed that some elderly people seem to be protected from\nfunctional decline, and a significant proportion of impaired el-\nderly people regain physical functioning (Beckett et al., 1996;\nSubsequent studies have identified the demographic, medi-\ncal, behavioral, and psychological characteristics associated\nwith maintenance of functional independence. Compared with\nelderly people who experience functional decline, \"successful\nagers\"--those who experience little or no decline--are more\nlikely to be male, White, free of chronic disease, and have high\nlevels of education and income (Mor, Wilcox, Rakowski, &\nStrawbridge, Cohen, Shema, & Kaplan, 1996). Those who\npractice healthy behaviors such as physical activity (Seeman et\nrefrain from unhealthy behaviors such as smoking (Parker,\nThorslund, Lundberg, & Kareholt, 1996) and heavy alcohol\nconsumption (Scherr, LaCroix, Wallace, & Berkman, 1992)\nalso are likely to age more successfully. In addition, psychoso-\ncial factors such as self-efficacy (Mendes de Leon, Seeman,\nlack of depression (Strawbridge et al., 1996), and good self-\nrated health (Mor et al., 1994) are associated with more suc-\ncessful aging.\nSocial support and social networks also are associated with\nhealth outcomes in elderly persons, including a lower risk of\nmortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer mortality, and func-\nThoits, 1995). These protective effects of social networks may\nresult from several processes. These include provision of access\nto information about health and health care services (Bloom,\n1990), encouragement of healthy behaviors (Bovbjerg et al.,\n1995; Mermelstein, Cohen, Lichtenstein, Kanmark, & Baer,\n1986), encouragement of health care utilization (Bleeker,\nLamers, Leenders, & Kruyssen, 1995), provision of tangible\naid (Thoits, 1995), provision of emotional support to facilitate\ncoping with life stress (Thoits, 1995), enhancement of feelings\nof self-esteem and control (Krause & Borawski-Clark, 1994),\nand influences on neuroendocrine or immune functioning\n(Seeman, Charpentier, Berkman, et al., 1994; Uchino, Cacioppo,\nAlthough the main effects of social variables on health have\nbeen documented, the extent to which these effects may vary\nacross population subgroups is not known. Three variables that\nmay moderate the effects of social support/social networks on\nhealth are income, gender, and level of physical functioning, as\ndescribed below.\nIncome\nSocial support may have stronger benefits for elderly people\nwith low income. People with low income may have greater ex-\nposure to health threats including inadequate or unsafe housing\nconditions, crime-ridden neighborhoods, and inadequate nutri-\ntion (Robert & House, 1996). These people may have a greater\nneed for social support and they may suffer more when they\nlack adequate social support. Conversely, elderly people with\nadequate income are able to afford health care, assistive de-\nvices, nutritious food, travel, and entertainment, and they are\nable to pay others to help them with household tasks. Therefore,\nelderly people with adequate income may be able to compen-\nsate for a lack of social support by paying for appropriate hous-\ning, household help, or travel to visit distant relatives or friends.\nThis may result in an interaction between social support and in-\ncome; lack of social support may lead to more negative health\neffects among people with low income.\nGender\nThe effects of social support also may differ by gender. Many\nelderly women may have devoted significant portions of their\nlives to caretaking and developing supportive friendships, so\nthey may be more accustomed to marshaling social support net-\nworks and asking for help. Many elderly men, in contrast, may\nhave devoted significant portions of their lives to career\nachievement, so they may not have developed supportive social\nnetworks or the skills to marshal social support. This gender\ndifference in social networks can lead to two different predic-\ntions about the nature of gender differences in the effects of so-\ncial support on health. First, because women may be more\nskilled at marshaling social support, the effects of social sup-\nport may be stronger for women, because women are better\nprepared to recruit social network members to provide instru-\nmental or emotional support in the appropriate ways at the ap-\npropriate times. Men, in contrast, may be reluctant to ask for\nsupport, or they may seek it less skillfully than women do. This\nwould lead to the prediction that social support would have\nstronger effects for women, because women are able to obtain\nand use it more effectively.\nConversely, social support may have stronger effects for\nmen. Because many men are unaccustomed to marshaling so-\ncial support when they need it, those men with low levels of so-\ncial support may be especially isolated, which may put them at\nespecially high risk for negative health outcomes. Women with\nlow social support, however, may be able to compensate for so-\ncial isolation by forming new social contacts or strengthening\nweak ones. This scenario would predict that social support\nwould show stronger effects for men, because there would be a\ngreater disparity in health between people with low and high\nsocial support among men than among women.\nIt is not clear whether there are gender differences in the ef-\nfects of social support on health outcomes. Some studies have\nfound more beneficial effects for men (Barer, 1994; House,\nRobbins, & Metzner, 1982; Umberson, Wortman, & Kessler,\n1992); some have found more beneficial effects for women\n(Tower & Kasl, 1996); and some have found no gender differ-\nmost research on gender differences in the effects of social sup-\nport has focused on mortality or psychological distress; few\nstudies have used functional status as an outcome variable.\nHealth Status\nSocial support/social networks also may have stronger ef-\nfects for elderly people who are in poorer health. The support\nand assistance provided by social network members might be\nmore valuable for elderly people with lower levels of physical\nfunctioning, because these individuals require more assistance.\nElderly people with high levels of physical functioning are\nmore able to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), and\nthey do not have to cope with the severe emotional conse-\nquences of chronic illness and functional limitations.\nTherefore, the buffering effects of social support and social\nnetworks may be especially powerful for those elderly people\nwho have impaired physical functioning and who need to cope\nwith the physical and psychological consequences of their lim-\nitations. The combination of poor physical functioning and\nlow social support may have especially harmful consequences\nfor health.\nTo date, most studies of social influences on health have con-\ncentrated on main effects; few have investigated whether these\neffects vary by gender, income, or health status. The present\nstudy examines two functional aspects of social ties (instru-\nmental support and emotional support) and two structural as-\npects of social ties (marital status and number of other social\nties) in relation to changes in self-reported physical functioning\nover a 7-year period. More specifically, this study investigates\nwhether the strength of these relationships varies by gender, in-\ncome, or health status. Analyses were performed to answer two\nresearch questions:\n1. Are social support and social network characteristics associ-\nated with decline in self-reported physical functioning over a\n7-year period?\n2. Do the associations between social network characteristics\nand physical functioning differ according to gender, income,\nor baseline health status?\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe data used in this study are from the MacArthur Studies\nof Successful Aging, a longitudinal study of relatively high-\nfunctioning men and women ages 70-79 years. As described\nby Berkman et al. (1993), participants were subsampled on the\nbasis of age and physical and cognitive functioning from three\ncommunity-based cohorts of the National Institute on Aging's\nEstablished Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the\nElderly (EPESE) in Durham, North Carolina, East Boston,\nMassachusetts, and New Haven, Connecticut (Cornoni-Huntley\nin the study to minimize the effects of age on subsequent analy-\nses of factors associated with the maintenance of health and\nfunctioning.\nOf the 4,030 men and women who met the age criterion,\n1,313 were identified as high functioning on the basis of four\ncriteria of physical functioning (no ADL disability, no more\nthan one reported mild disability on eight items tapping gross\nmobility and range of motion; ability to hold a semitandem bal-\nance for at least 10 seconds; and ability to stand from a seated\npositionfivetimes within 20 seconds) and two criteria of cogni-\ntive functioning (scores of 6 or more correct on the 9-item Short\nPortable Mental Status Questionnaire [Pfeiffer, 1975] and abil-\nity to remember at least three elements on a delayed recall of a\nshort story).\nOf the 1,313 men and women classified as high functioning,\nsent. Baseline data were collected between May 1988 and\nDecember 1989. The cohort was reinterviewed between\nviewed at baseline, 273 (23%) died before the follow-up inter-\nview (32% of the men and 16% of the women). Of those who\nsurvived, complete data on physical functioning at both base-\nline and follow-up were available for 850 respondents. These\n850 respondents, who represent 93% of those who were alive at\nfollow-up and 71 % of the original sample, constitute the sam-\nple used in this analysis.\nMeasures\nDependent variable.--The outcome measure used in this\nas measured by the Nagi physical functioning scale (Nagi,\n1976). This scale measures the respondent's perceived diffi-\nculty in performing five tasks: pushing/pulling large objects,\nstooping/kneeling, lifting/carrying 10 pounds, reaching/extend-\ning arms, and writing/handling small objects. The Nagi score\nrepresents the number of tasks that the respondent rated as\n\"some difficulty,\" \"a lot of difficulty,\" or \"unable to do.\" Nagi\nscores can range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating more\nimpairment. Because the baseline sample was restricted to indi-\nviduals with Nagi scores of 0 or 1, the change in Nagi score\ncould range from -1 (a 1-point improvement in functioning) to\n5 (a 5-point decline in functioning).\nMeasures ofsocial support and social networks.--Measures\nof both structural and functional aspects of social networks\nwere included as predictors of impairment. Structural measures\nincluded marital status (married vs not married) and number of\nsocial ties, other than the spouse. Functional measures included\nemotional support and instrumental support. These constructs\nwere measured separately for the respondent's spouse, children,\nand friends/relatives, and the three scores were averaged to\ncreate a single score for each type of functional support.\nEmotional support was measured based on the reported fre-\nquency with which the respondent's social network members\n\"will listen when you have a problem\" and make the respon-\ndent \"feel loved and cared for.\" Instrumental support was mea-\nsured based on the reported frequency with which network\nmembers \"help with daily tasks\" and \"provide information.\" As\npreviously reported (Seeman, Charpentier et al., 1994), these\nmeasures exhibit adequate test-retest reliability.\nCovariates.--To control for confounding, variables found to\nbe associated with social support and/or health status in previ-\nous studies were evaluated as potential covariates. Correlation\nanalyses were conducted to determine which of these variables\nwere associated significantly with the dependent variable, and\nthese variables were retained for inclusion in subsequent multi-\nple regression analyses.\nDemographic variables included age, gender, ethnicity\n(White vs Black), education (high school graduate vs less than\nhigh school), and income (less than $10,000/year, over\n$10,000/year, or unknown). The education variable was di-\nchotomized because its distribution was skewed. For income,\nthe \"unknown\" category was included because a substantial\nproportion of the respondents (9%) either refused to provide in-\ncome information or said they did not know their income.\nRather than excluding these respondents from the analysis, we\ncreated dummy variables for income less than $10,000/year\nand income missing.\nBaseline physical andpsychological health status variables\nwere included as covariates because older adults in poor health\ntypically require and receive higher levels of social support\n(Wilcox, Kasl, & Berkman, 1994) and are at higher risk of\nfunctional decline (Seeman et al., 1995). These included a\nphysical performance measure derived from tests of balance,\ngait, chair stands, foot taps, and manual ability (described in de-\ntail by Seeman, Charpentier, et al., 1994) and number of preva-\nlent chronic conditions at baseline. Depressive symptoms were\nmeasured with the depression subscale of the Hopkins\nSymptom Checklist (Derogatis, Lipman, Rickels, Uhlenhuth,\nHealth behaviors such as alcohol use, smoking, and physical\nactivity also were included as covariates. Smoking was ex-\npressed in pack-years. Levels of physical activity were assessed\nbased on self-reported frequency of current leisure- and work-\nrelated activity. Each activity mentioned was classified as light,\nmoderate, or strenuous based on intensity codes (described by\nSeeman et al., 1995). Summary scales were derived by multi-\nplying the frequency of activity (5 categories, ranging from\nnever to 3+ times/week) by the intensity and summing over all\nactivities. To assess alcohol use, respondents were asked how\nmany days in the past month they had consumed beer, wine, or\nliquor, and how many drinks they had at a time. These re-\nsponses were used to create an estimate of the amount of ethyl\nalcohol consumed in the past month (Armor, Polich, &\nAnalysis\nThe model-building process involved several steps. First,\ncorrelations were computed between the dependent variable\n(change in Nagi impairment) and each hypothesized covariate\n(demographic and health status variables). The covariates that\nwere significantly correlated with change in Nagi impairment\nwere included along with the four social support/social network\nvariables in a multiple regression model predicting change in\nNagi impairment, to determine the effects of social support/so-\ncial networks after controlling for the covariates. Finally, to de-\ntermine whether the effects of the social support/social network\nvariables were moderated by gender, income, or physical health\nstatus, interaction terms were added to the model. There were\n12 interaction terms, representing the 4 social support/social\nnetwork variables crossed with the 3 potential moderators.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows the baseline demographic characteristics of the\ndard deviation = 2.7 years). The mean change in Nagi impairment\nwas 0.82 impairments (standard deviation = 1.36 impairments).\nSeveral variables differed significantly by gender. The\nwomen in the sample were older than the men (t = 2.37,\n.0005), and showed larger changes in Nagi impairment (t =\nsignificantly by gender.\nThe correlations between each hypothesized predictor vari-\nable and functional decline are shown in Table 2. Several of the\nhypothesized covariates were correlated significantly with func-\ntional decline. These included age, gender, income, baseline\nchronic conditions, alcohol use, physical activity, physical per-\nformance, and depressive symptoms. These variables were re-\ntained for inclusion in the multiple regression described below.\nIn addition, the correlations between the social support/social\nnetwork variables and functional decline were assessed. Marital\nstatus was correlated significantly with functional decline, and\nthe correlation between emotional support and functional de-\ncline approached statistical significance (/? = .0798).\nTable 3 shows the results of the multiple regression analyses\npredicting change in Nagi impairment. In this model, the ef-\nfects of each covariate and social support/social network vari-\nable are controlled for the effects of the other variables. Only\nthose covariates found to be significantly correlated with\nchange in Nagi impairment were retained for inclusion in the\nmultiple regression model. Interaction terms were added to the\nmodel, as described in the Methods section, to evaluate the po-\ntential moderating influences of gender, income, and baseline\nphysical functioning.\nSocial support/social networks.--The only social support/so-\ncial network variable significantly associated with functional\ndecline was number of social ties at baseline, which was associ-\nated with less functional decline. The main effects of the other\nsocial support/social network variables were not associated sig-\nnificantly with functional decline, after controlling for the other\nvariables.\nSome of the social support/social network variables were in-\ntercorrelated. However, these associations were only modest, so\nmulticollinearity is not a problem. Instrumental support was\ncorrelated positively with emotional support (r = .34, p <\nties (r = .22, p < .0005). Emotional support also was correlated\npositively with number of social ties (r =. 19, /? < .0005).\nAlthough marital status was associated significantly with\nfunctional decline in the correlation analyses, additional step-\nwise analyses (not shown) indicated that it became nonsignifi-\ncant after depressive symptoms, income, and age were added to\nthe model. Number of social ties was not associated signifi-\ncantly with functional decline in the correlation analyses, but it\nbecame significant after controlling for income, depressive\nsymptoms, age, physical activity, and emotional support.\nTable 1.

The interaction\nbetween gender and number of social ties (p < .05) is shown in\nFigure 1. Overall, respondents with larger numbers of social\nties at baseline reported less functional decline. As shown in\nFigure 1, the association between number of social ties and\nfunctional decline was stronger for men than for women. In\nother words, although social ties were beneficial for respon-\ndents of both genders, they had a stronger protective effect for\nmen than for women. The largest gender differences in func-\ntional decline were observed at the highest levels of social ties.\nThe interaction between baseline physical performance and\nnumber of social ties (p < .005) is shown in Figure 2. Although\nbaseline physical performance was analyzed as a continuous\nvariable in the regression analyses, it is shown as a dichoto-\nmous variable to simplify the illustration. This interaction indi-\ncates that the association between number of social ties at base-\nline and subsequent functional decline was stronger for\nindividuals who were below the mean on baseline physical per-\nformance. Social ties were protective regardless of baseline\nphysical performance, but they were especially protective for\nrespondents with low levels of baseline physical performance.\nBecause the analyses focused on changes in Nagi impair-\nment, they did not include the 273 respondents who died before\nthe 1995 follow-up interview. To confirm the effects with a less\nrestricted sample, we ran a similar analysis on the entire base-\nline sample, using mortality as the dependent variable. The re-\nsults of this analysis were consistent with the analyses of Nagi\nimpairment (data not shown).\nTable 3.

Change in Nagi impairment, according to baseline physical perfor-\nmance and number of social ties.\nDISCUSSION\nThese results indicate that the effects of social ties on the risk\nof functional decline in elderly persons are moderated by gen-\nder and baseline physical performance. Specifically, social ties\nhad a stronger protective effect for men and for respondents\nwith low levels of baseline physical performance.\nOur finding that social support/social networks had a\nstronger effect on functional status for men than for women is\nconsistent with other research findings for other health out-\ncomes. A number of prospective studies have reported stronger\neffects for social support and/or social networks with respect to\ncardiovascular and all-cause mortality for men (Berkman et al.,\nparticular, the harmful effect of widowhood on cardiovascular\nmorbidity and mortality has been shown to be stronger among\nmen than among women (Berkman et al., 1993). Because older\nmen who are widowed or socially isolated are at high risk for\nfunctional decline and mortality, this high-risk group should be\na target for health promotion interventions. Studies also are\nneeded to determine what causes elderly men to become so-\ncially isolated, and how this social isolation and its associated\nharmful health effects can be prevented.\nThe stronger protective effect of social ties among respon-\ndents with low levels of baseline physical performance also has\nimportant implications for interventions to promote successful\naging. Social ties appear to be most important for elderly peo-\nple with more limited physical ability. This suggests that inter-\nventions to increase social support, such as arranging group ac-\ntivities for elderly people or pairing them with \"buddies\" in the\ncommunity, may be especially powerful for those elderly peo-\nple who already have some physical impairment or activity lim-\nitations. However, because of their restricted mobility, these\nolder adults may pose the greatest challenge for health promo-\ntion programs and services. Greater efforts are needed to imple-\nment social activities that are accessible and can be enjoyed by\npeople with physical impairments.\nWe had hypothesized that income also would moderate the\neffects of social support/social networks on functional decline.\nHowever, the moderating effects of income were not signifi-\ncant. Although higher income was associated with less func-\ntional decline in the correlational analysis, the main effect of in-\ncome became nonsignificant in the multiple regression model,\nand none of the interaction terms involving income were signifi-\ncant. This suggests that the associations between income and\nfunctional status found in other studies (Berkman & Gurland,\n1998) may be explained in part by differences in social support\nand social networks, and that social support may be a mediator,\nrather than a moderator, of the association between income and\nhealth status among elderly persons. Elderly people with higher\nincomes, for example, may be more able to remain integrated\nwithin a social network, because they are able to afford trans-\nportation and activities.\nThe significant interactions found in this study indicate that\nthe beneficial effects of social variables are not equally strong\nfor all elderly people. Although many previous studies have ex-\namined only the main effects of social variables, the present re-\nsults indicate that the benefits of social variables may differ for\nmen and women, and they may differ according to an individ-\nual's level of physical functioning. If studies evaluate only the\nmain effects of social variables on health, they may fail to de-\ntect important subgroup differences in the effects of social sup-\nport and social networks. Health promotion interventions for el-\nderly people should focus on those elderly people who are most\nat risk of suffering harmful health effects as a result of social\nisolation. The results of this study suggest that men and people\nwith physical impairments may be especially in need of inter-\nventions to enhance social support and social networks.\nLimitations\nBecause this is a study of an initially high-functioning co-\nhort, the generalizability of these findings may be limited.\nWhile this study suggests that social ties are more protective for\npeople with lower levels of physical performance, all respon-\ndents in this study did in fact have relatively high levels of phys-\nical functioning, as evidenced by their lack of impairment in\nADLs. This study does not clarify what the effects of social ties\nwould be for elderly people with more severe functional limita-\ntions, because the initial selection criteria guaranteed that these\nindividuals were not represented in the baseline cohort.\nNevertheless, the significant moderating effect of physical per-\nformance found in this study indicates that even modest differ-\nences in physical performance within a high-functioning sam-\nple were associated with differential effects of social ties. One\nmight hypothesize that the variation in effects would be even\nstronger in a cohort that included more severely impaired re-\nspondents.\nAnother possible limitation is that the data used in this study\nare based on respondents' self-reports of their physical func-\ntioning and social networks. Although attempts were made to\ncontrol for variables that may confound the relationship be-\ntween social variables and physical functioning (e.g., depres-\nsive symptoms, health behaviors, baseline health status), other\nvariables not included in these analyses may have biased the\naccuracy of respondents' self-reports. Potential confounding\nvariables that have been associated with both social networks\nand health outcomes include personality factors such as cynical\nhostility (Everson et al., 1997) and health behaviors other than\nthose measured here (Lauver, Nabholz, Scott, & Tak, 1997).\nDespite these limitations, these data provide important infor-\nmation about the effects of social support and social networks\non physical functioning in elderly persons. More specifically,\nthey highlight the fact that previously observed main effects\nmight obscure important population variation in the effects of\nsocial ties and social support on health outcomes. As shown in\nthese analyses, factors such as gender and baseline physical\nperformance appear to moderate social network effects. Greater\nattention needs to be given to describing and understanding the\ncomplex interaction between social networks and individual\ncharacteristics if we are to gain the requisite understanding to\ndesign effective interventions to promote more successful\naging.\n"
