The paradox is that many Americans' careers do not fit this image. Here, we examined how the structure\nof the career, as compared to only those circumstances proximate to retirement, is importantfor understanding ca-\nreer endings. Based on labor force histories drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, we ob-\nserved that the occupational roles held through the mid and late career combine additively to influence retirement\nand disability experiences, with different conditions of work coming into play depending on the career stage. Occu-\npational roles in the mid career also have long-term, indirect effects, operating through the onset of health prob-\nlems and the adequacy of pension benefits. Although retirement and disability are not hinged to occupational mo-\nbility per se, these career endings are sensitive to major discontinuities in the career and work role in terms of\nunemployment and laborforce mobility.\nTI ^HE idea of a long and stable career rewarded by retire-\nX ment is a fixture of the American social ethos and polit-\nical economy. Individuals regard retirement as a right or\nnatural consequence of a lifetime of work commitment.\nPrivate pension systems, especially guaranteed benefit\nplans, reinforce this belief by rewarding employment\ntenure. Social Security pension benefits also reward stable\ncareers, basing benefit levels on earnings from contiguous\nquarters of labor force participation. The fact that retire-\nment is regarded as a natural part of the career is due in\npart to the mutual advantages that workers, employers, and\nthe state accrue through lower turnover (and its costs) and\nincreased productivity by workers.\nThe paradox is that the work careers of many Americans\ndo not fit this image. Over their careers, workers frequently\nchange jobs both within and between firms (e.g., DiPrete &\nKrecker, 1991). A significant number of Americans also ex-\nperience unemployment at some point in their work lives\nlosses and gains in the circumstances and rewards associ-\nated with their jobs (e.g., Blau & Duncan, 1967; Tolbert,\n1982). Although these experiences are age-patterned with\nsubstantially greater mobility occurring early in the career,\nmobility remains an important aspect of the career even\namong middle-aged and older workers (e.g., Spenner,\nThis discrepancy between the ideal career and many\nAmericans' experiences points to the important role the\nwork career has in producing variation in the timing and\ncharacter of the work-to-retirement transition. Here, we in-\nvestigate the alternative ways in which work careers poten-\ntially influence career endings. Special attention is given to\nthe trajectories of occupational incumbency and career mo-\nbility. As we demonstrate below, career endings are linked\nboth to the patterning of occupational roles held over the\ncareer and to major discontinuities in the work role. Trajec-\ntories indicative of career advancement magnify ties to the\nlabor force, reducing retirement chances. Conversely, tra-\njectories showing low levels of attainment weaken workers'\nbonds to the labor force, increasing retirement chances.\nHow careers end and the timing of career endings are a\nreflection of the stratification of occupational achievement\n(Hayward, Grady, Hardy, & Sommers, 1989; Hayward,\nHardy, & Liu, 1994). Jobs with little autonomy, mundane\nwork tasks, and high physical demands propel workers out\nof the labor force through retirement and disability. The\ndisruption of the work role through unemployment hastens\nthe end of the work career. These late-life work circum-\nstances index the attractiveness of continued work activity\nand the demand for older workers. It is axiomatic, however,\nthat older workers are rarely \"born into\" those positions\nheld late in life. For most workers, these positions are the\noutcomes of a lifetime of career achievement. The general\nquestion for this study is whether only the person's current\nwork circumstances are relevant to predict retirement be-\nhavior, or whether retirement also is sensitive to earlier ca-\nreer experiences and thus patterned by both current and\nearlier work circumstances. If the latter is true, then knowl-\nedge of the structure of careers is important for understand-\ning retirement.\nAlthough most prior research has focused on contextual-\nizing career endings in terms of late-life work circum-\nstances, there are both substantive and theoretical reasons\nto suspect more far-reaching career effects. For example,\nempirical evidence contradicts the commonly held notion\nthat older workers experience little career mobility. Among\nover 20% changed employers and approximately 35%\nchanged occupations. Of those who changed occupations,\nthe proportions moving upward and downward in terms of\noccupational status were roughly equal (Tolbert, 1982).\nThis same pattern holds at a highly aggregate level. At least\na quarter of older incumbents in 1-digit census occupational\ncategories moved to other occupations. The volume of\nmovement ranged from 29% of professionals to 54% of\nnonfarm laborers (Parnes & Less, 1985). The key lessons\nfor this study are that (a) there is considerable variation in\nthe age-vulnerability of careers, and (b) older workers are\nheterogeneous in terms of how they arrived in their occupa-\ntional positions. To show that retirement differs by current\noccupation is no guarantee that retirement is in fact\nprompted by the immediate work environment. The full\nconsequences of occupational achievement must be sought\nby tracing the effects of occupational positions held through-\nNeither prior research nor current theory provides a clear\nstandard of how to model the effects of a career on retire-\nment behavior. We approach the development of a theoreti-\ncal framework with several goals in mind. First, it is impor-\ntant to identify the effects of specific qualities of the work\ncareer to understand the mechanisms connecting career\nendings with career achievement. Second, given the dynam-\nics of careers, it is important to separate the effects of the\nimmediate work environment from prior circumstances to\nassess whether one or both influences retirement. Third, it\nis necessary to consider how occupational positions com-\nbine over the career to influence career endings.\nThese goals are rooted in Spilerman's (1977) definition\nof a career. Individuals' career achievements are deter-\nmined, in part, by career lines, the properties of which in-\nclude entry portals, number of available positions, and\ntransfer opportunities to better (or worse) jobs or alternative\ncareer lines. These properties are age-patterned, which ac-\ncounts for the sequence of jobs individuals hold over the\ncareer. These sequences, in turn, determine career trajecto-\nries of job qualities and rewards. Comparisons of job quali-\nties for different points in the career can be used to make\ninferences about career advancement or unraveling.\nTraditionally, career achievement has been indexed by\nsociologists in terms of occupational status. In studying the\nconsequences of occupational position for individuals,\nhowever, the use of a single global measure such as occupa-\ntional status does not lend itself to sorting out the mecha-\nnisms by which the achievement of social positions affects\nsome outcome such as retirement. This study follows the\nresearch tradition of Kohn and Schooler (e.g., 1983) and\nadopts the premise that the structural conditions of work\nrather than the status assigned to work mediate the effects\nof social position on retirement. Phrased in terms of the re-\nsearch problem stated above, retirement is hypothesized to\nbe an outcome of the career trajectory where the trajectory\nreferences the conditions of work over the career.\nThe conditions of the work environment are referenced\nin terms of structural imperatives (i.e., factors defining the\nday-to-day qualities of work activity; Kohn & Schooler,\n(a) occupational self-direction (e.g., the substantive com-\nplexity of work, closeness of supervision, and routiniza-\ntion); (b) job pressures (e.g., strength demands and environ-\nmental conditions); (c) extrinsic rewards and risks (e.g., the\nrisk of unemployment, employment regulations, and earn-\nings); and (d) position in the organizational structure (e.g.,\nownership, and supervisory status). All four dimensions of\nthe work environment have been linked to the retirement\nprocess (e.g., Hayward et al., 1989). Retirement rates are\nelevated for persons in jobs with low self-direction (e.g.,\njobs with low levels of complexity, authority and high lev-\nels of routinization) and considerable job pressures (e.g.,\njobs which are physically and environmentally demanding).\nRetirement also is affected by the job's extrinsic rewards\nand risks (e.g., generous pension benefits and compulsory\nretirement regulations increase retirement rates) and posi-\ntion in the organizational structure (e.g., retirement rates are\nlow among self-employed persons compared to persons\nworking in larger bureaucratized firms). Retirement is em-\nbedded in the organization of work. Here, we amend this\nidea by inserting temporal structure into the relationship.\nWe consider how retirement is embedded in the organiza-\ntion of work over the career.\nAlthough little research has examined career effects on\nretirement (an important exception is the work of Elder &\nPavalko, 1993), related research suggests that occupational\npositions in both mid and late life influence career endings,\nwith different structural imperatives coming into play de-\npending on the career stage. This body of research suggests,\nfor example, that imperatives such as substantive complex-\nity and physical and environmental demands have the great-\nest effect in the later stages of the career (e.g., Spenner,\n1988a), whereas mid career effects accrue from the job's\nextrinsic rewards and risks and position in the organiza-\ntional structure (e.g., Mutran & Reitzes, 1989; Quinn,\nThe importance for retirement of structural imperatives\nexperienced in the late career is based partly on the empiri-\ncal observation that some work conditions, especially con-\nditions reflecting the substantive complexity of work and\njob pressures, show increased variability in the mid to late\ncareer as workers continue to be sorted (or sort themselves)\ninto jobs. As variability in substantive complexity occurs\nover the career, for example, so do the opportunities for\nadult intellectual and personal development (Spenner,\n1988a). Substantively complex environments provide older\nworkers with the opportunities to practice or exercise their\nintellectual abilities. Practice in later life generates greater\nbenefits in terms of maintaining one's level of ability com-\npared to younger ages (i.e., the lack of exercise is more\nharmful at older ages). Retirement-aged workers in substan-\ntively complex jobs thus are more likely to maintain their\nintellectual abilities and interests in their jobs compared to\nsame aged workers in less complex jobs, accentuating oc-\ncupational differences in both the value of older workers to\nemployers and older workers' own evaluation of work and\nnon-work alternatives. The strongest effects of substantive\ncomplexity on retirement, therefore, should come from\nthose jobs held as persons move into the prime retirement\nages. We also expect that the physical and environmental\ndemands from jobs held late in the career are likely to ele-\nvate retirement. Workers' age-related declines in health are\nlikely to magnify the challenges of these job pressures.\nWe expect that the structural imperatives of mid career\noccupations operate principally through the traditional ex-\nplanatory factors of retirement: health status and pension\ncharacteristics. Health is sensitive to working conditions\nsuch as substantive complexity and physical and environ-\nmental demands. Occupations lacking complexity or char-\nacterized by high levels of job stress have higher rates of\nmortality (Moore & Hayward, 1990) and heart disease\n(e.g., Karasek, Theorell, & Schwartz, 1988; Karasek,\n1990). Greater physical and environmental demands also\nelevate the chances of mortality (Behrman, Sickles, &\ntal disorders and impaired working capacity (Ostlin, 1988),\nand heart disease (Johnson, Hall, & Theorell, 1989;\nKarasek et al., 1988). The long-term consequences of these\nworking conditions, then, may be health-mandated career\nexits at older ages.\nWorkers' retirement pensions stem from extrinsic rewards\nand risks and the worker's position in the organizational\ntrinsic rewards and risks include the chances of unemploy-\nment, employment rules and regulations, and earnings. Over\nthe course of the career, extrinsic rewards and risks give rise\nto earnings trajectories and job tenure. Earnings trajectories\ninfluence pension benefit levels, and job tenure governs pri-\nvate pension eligibility. Illustrative of positional effects is\nthe contrast in pension wealth stemming from careers devel-\noped inside and outside large bureaucratic firms. Bureau-\ncratic firms are capable of supporting private pension pro-\ngrams. Self-employed persons, in contrast, bear the brunt of\naccumulating private pension wealth through personal sav-\nings and higher Social Security taxes because there is no\nemployer contribution. This latter factor negatively affects\nprivate pension wealth by constraining discretionary sav-\nings. Self-employment over the major part of the career\ntherefore is likely to delay retirement.\nThe dynamic quality of the career makes it important to\nconsider how career endings are related to trajectories in-\ndicative of a bettering or worsening of working conditions\n(Elder & Pavalko, 1993). Careers can unravel through job\nloss or a worsening of working conditions through down-\nward occupational mobility. Career building can occur via\nimprovements in working conditions. Career unraveling at\nolder ages is expected to reduce older workers' preference\nfor continued work, especially given the availability of re-\ntirement options defined by public and private pension sys-\ntems. Career building at older ages is expected to have the\nopposite effect. Here, an improvement in working condi-\ntions is likely to heighten older workers' preference for\ncontinued work, although there are clearly diminishing re-\nturns with age.\nOccupational moves denoting a worsening of work condi-\ntions thus are expected in increased retirement rates, whereas\nmoves to better working conditions are expected to have the\nopposite effect. The greater the magnitude of change in\nworking conditions, ceteris paribus, the greater the impact on\nretirement rates. For example, moves resulting in less self-\ndirection and greater pressures are expected to increase the\nrisk of retirement, net of an individual's position, since such\nmoves potentially signal career unraveling. We also consider\nthe possibility that events signaling unraveling may influ-\nence retirement indirectly by impairing health status and re-\nducing access to and/or the real value of pensions.\nThis study is a cohort-based prospective analysis of the\nNational Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of Older Men. The\nNLS is a nationally representative sample of men aged\nally until 1983. The NLS was designed to map the labor\nforce experiences of middle-aged men as they entered the\nspans an important period in retirement research. Although\nmost of the post-WWII decline in men's labor force partici-\npation rates occurred prior to this period (Hayward, Crim-\nzation of the retirement transition underwent significant\nchanges. Retirement rates escalated as did reentry rates,\ncausing a contraction in the main career and an expansion\nof post-retirement labor force activity for both men and\nwomen (Hayward, Crimmins, & Wray, 1994; Hayward,\nchanges were prompted in part by the liberalization of pub-\nlic and private pension plans and the increased respectabil-\nity of retirement in the population (Parnes & Less, 1985),\ngeneral conditions that remain part of the fabric of today's\nretirement decision making.\nOn entering this period, 34% of the NLS cohort identi-\nfied a white-collar occupation as their longest job (Parnes\nemployment at this point was concentrated in craft and la-\nthe cohort reporting farm occupations as their longest job.\nThis latter estimate of farm employment as the longest job\nis doubtlessly unique to this cohort compared to more re-\ncent cohorts given the long-term historical decline in farm\nemployment over this century. Very little change occurred\nin employment mobility as the cohort moved through the\nbust cycles--as noted above roughly 80% of men aged\n55-59 years reported working with the same employer at\nthe beginning and end of three 5-year intervals spanning the\nhigher volumes of occupational mobility were reported for\nthese ages, though occupational stability over a 5-year in-\nterval declined only marginally from 63 to 59%. Despite\nboth improvements and declines in occupational status by\nindividuals over the observation period, overall levels of oc-\ncupational upgrading continued as the cohort entered the\nprime retirement years. Particularly evident was the growth\nof men working in managerial occupations among white-\ncollar workers, the heavy decline in farm employment with\nthe dispersal of workers into other blue-collar jobs, and the\ngrowth of service employment fueled by men leaving oper-\native and laborer occupations.\nThe NLS cohort is unique in at least one other important\nrespect compared to current and future cohorts of persons\nfacing retirement. During most of the observation period,\nrelatively few older women had lifelong work careers, and\nthose women who did were concentrated in a handful of oc-\ncupations. The NLS men's retirement decisions, therefore,\nare more typically framed in terms of \"his\" labor market\nexperiences and rewards rather than some combination of\nhusbands' and wives' characteristics. Among the more re-\ncent cohorts of workers approaching retirement, however,\nwomen's greater access to private pensions and a higher\nprevalence of lifelong work careers has elevated both the\nimportance of considering women's retirement in its own\nright and the imperative of framing both men's and wom-\nen's retirement decisions within the larger context of the\nhousehold (e.g., Henretta, O'Rand, & Chan, 1993).\nThe analysis here rests on the subsample of men ob-\nserved to be in the labor force at some point during the 17-\nyear observation period. This restriction allows us to accu-\nrately identify the \"at risk\" population and to establish\ncovariate values temporally prior to exiting the labor force.\nThose men in 1966 not in the labor force and who never\nreenter are excluded from this analysis. Histories of labor\nforce behavior are constructed based on men's movements\nout of, and perhaps back into, the labor force over the ob-\nservation period. Should individuals exit and then reenter\nthe labor force, they rejoin the retirement risk set. An indi-\nvidual's history ends at the age at which he left the survey\neither through death or attrition. The histories are compiled\ninto an exposure interval file where the interval is one year\nin length. All exposure intervals are defined such that indi-\nviduals are on average exact age x (e.g., 62.0) at the begin-\nning of an interval, and events (including censoring) are as-\nsumed to occur in the middle of the interval. Censoring\nrefers to individuals in the risk set who leave observation\nbecause of sample attrition or death prior to being observed\nto exit the labor force. In all, the subsample generated\nThe work-to-retirement experiences of workers are de-\nfined in terms of changes in labor force status over the 1-\nyear exposure interval. The NLS allows us to determine the\nage at which persons exited the labor force and whether the\nexit was mandated by the inability to work (i.e., disability).\nPersons employed or looking for work in the survey week\nare classified as being \"in the labor force.\" Persons not cur-\nrently working and not looking for work are classified as\nbeing \"out of the labor force.\" Disability is based on re-\nspondents' reports that they are unable to work for health\nreasons. Nondisabled persons out of the labor force are la-\nbeled heuristically as retired.\nThe operational definition of retirement is an unsettled\nissue (Ekerdt & DeViney, 1990). An alternative approach is\nto use self-identification (e.g., do individuals define them-\nselves as retired?), although this sometimes confuses labor\nsupply with a social identity. In addition to labor force exit\nand self-identification, other possible criteria include pen-\nsion receipt, separation from a career job, and reduced\nwork effort. Cross-classification on these criteria shows\nconsiderable overlap among men--though no comparable\nanalyses are available for women (e.g., 75-85% of men are\nconsistently classified across multiple criteria), and alterna-\ntive definitions typically have no effect on the substantive\nresults (e.g., Diamond & Hausman, 1984; Palmore,\nBurchett, Fillenbaum, George, & Wallman, 1985). Multiple\ncriteria are sometimes used to define retirement status.\nHowever, multiple criteria introduce difficulties in making\ninferences about when events happen because criteria need\nnot share the same temporal paths. Here, our reliance on\nlabor force status in combination with the inability to work\nprovides the means to identify the cessation of work. Infor-\nmation on part-time work and prior labor force exits are in-\ncluded as explanatory covariates to link exiting events with\nreduced work effort and labor force mobility.\nThe total number of retirement and disability events in\ning data, the number of events in the analysis reduces to\nmissing data are minimized largely by imputing missing\nvalues using a hot deck imputation routine. Procedures are\ndescribed in detail in Moore and Hayward (1990). Despite\nusing an imputation procedure, some missing data still re-\nsulted because of an insufficient number of cases with valid\nvalues matching the characteristics of the missing case.\nA disproportionate share of retirement and disability\nexits are single career ending events. Of all the retirement\nevents, approximately 74% reference the only retirement\nevent in a person's life (although substantial numbers of re-\ntirees reenter the labor force and perhaps exit through death\nor disability); 95% of disability exits reference the only dis-\nability event.\nThe distinction between retirement and disability as rea-\nsons for exiting the labor force is important for several rea-\nsons. First, disability explicitly references health-mandated\nlabor force exits, (i.e., persons report being unable to work\nfor health-related reasons), and is thus a largely involun-\ntary act. Although health status may prompt a person to re-\ntire (e.g., Hayward et al., 1989), the retiree, unlike a dis-\nabled worker, is nonetheless capable of working. Second,\nand related to this first point, different processes govern\nthese events (e.g., Hayward et al., 1989). A range of fac-\ntors influence the retirement decision including occupa-\ntion, health status, pension wealth, income, education, and\nself-employment. A much narrower set of factors directly\ninfluences disability (e.g., health status and income) with\nthe occupational position held proximate to disability only\nplaying a major role indirectly through an individual's\nThe longitudinal quality of the NLS makes it possible to\ncharacterize career mobility during the later stages of the\ncareer, since information on occupation, unemployment,\nand employer changes is collected at each observation\nwave. Information about the longest job (e.g., occupation\nand tenure) and the first job after the completion of school\nalso, is available at baseline, providing markers of achieve-\nment spanning the entire career. The NLS contains items\nmeasuring the traditional determinants of retirement such\nas financial information, health, pension coverage, and de-\nmographic characteristics. Table 1 shows the variables used\nin the analysis.\nThe fourth edition of the Dictionary of Occupational Ti-\ntles (DOT) is used to measure the nature of work in the oc-\ncupation.

The substantive complexity factor\ncorresponds closely to Spenner's definition of occupational\nself-direction. Occupations ranking high on substantive\ncomplexity involve working with data, require extensive\ntraining, and are characterized by abstract, creative, and\nnonrepetitive work. The other three factors reference differ-\nent types of job pressures. The manipulative skills factor\nrepresents the extent to which work in an occupation in-\nvolves working with things and requires aptitudes such as\nmotor coordination, finger dexterity, and eye-hand-foot co-\nordination. The physical and environmental demands factor\ntaps strength requirements and usual physical activities\n(e.g., stooping, kneeling, climbing) as well as the environ-\nmental conditions surrounding the work activity (e.g., tem-\nperature, presence of fumes, etc.). The social skills factor\nreferences the extent to which work involves dealing with\npeople and whether or not it requires the physical capabili-\nties of talking, hearing, and seeing. How the DOT factors\ndifferentiate the quality of work and the work environment\nacross major occupational groups is shown in Table 2,\nwhich reports the mean values of the scales for 1-digit cen-\nsus occupations.\nThe DOT information is assigned to NLS respondents\nbased on their 3-digit occupational code. As persons change\noccupations over the observation period, new DOT infor-\nmation is assigned to reflect the changes in the work en-\nvironment. This results in a set of occupational histories\nprofiling mid and late career changes in the substantive\ncomplexity of work, physical and environmental demands,\nsocial skill requirements, and manipulative skill require-\nments. Because historical information is not available on\nthe changing nature of work within occupations, we assume\nthat an occupation's ranking relative to other occupations\non these dimensions does not vary significantly over the ob-\nservation period.\nOther time-varying measures of the structural imperatives\nshown in Table 1 are taken directly from self reports.

Information is available to measure job tenure\nindicating the level of employment stability. We measure po-\nsition in the organizational structure using information on\nthe respondent's class of worker status. This allows us to dis-\ncriminate between employed persons in the private and gov-\nernment sectors from self-employed workers.\nMETHOD\nOur prior discussion makes clear the importance of spec-\nifying a model that includes indicators of the structural im-\nperatives experienced over the career. Career events also are\nintegral to understanding retirement by virtue of the fact\nthat events sometimes involve changes in the nature of\nwork or the interruption of the career through unemploy-\nment and labor force status changes. The model's basic\nform is taken from the work of Mare (1990) and Moore and\nHayward (1990). This approach expands the traditional\nstatic notion of occupation to encompass both longest and\nlatest occupation to distinguish the effects of the current\nwork environment from older workers' main occupational\nwork experience. The form of this model also is designed to\ncontrol for possible (negative and positive) retirement se-\nlection effects. For example, as discussed previously, ef-\nfects of the current occupation could potentially be at-\ntributed both to the effects of exposure or to some type of\nretirement-related selection into the occupation. After ear-\nlier socioeconomic statuses are controlled, however, the net\neffect of the current occupation is relatively purged from\nHere, the longest occupation is measured at baseline,\nwhile the latest occupation is measured from 1966 until the\nrespondent left observation. Given the number of occupa-\ntions individuals potentially hold over the career, our focus\non the longest and latest occupations is necessarily a sim-\nplifying strategy. Attention to the longest occupation when\nrespondents were 45-59, however, has certain conceptual\nmerits because it taps the notion of the main career occupa-\ntion prior to entry into the prime retirement ages.\nOur basic analytic model takes the following elementary\nform.\nZ is a vector of occupational characteristics pertaining to\nthe person's longest occupation, including indicators of\nsubstantive complexity, physical demands, and environ-\nmental conditions. Wit) is a vector of time-dependent occu-\npational characteristics comparable to Z pertaining to the\nlatest occupation. U(t) is a vector of time-dependent career\nevent characteristics referencing mobility in and out of the\nlabor force, unemployment, and employer changes between\nates indexing traditional retirement determinants such as\nhealth status and pension coverage. And Y(t) is a vector of\nindividual measures referencing sociodemographic and\nbackground characteristics, some of which are time depen-\ndent. The dependent variable in this model is the (log of\nthe) risk of a retirement or disability, where the risk refers\nto the instantaneous probability of an event occurring at\ntime t.\nThe parameters, f$m\n, represent the main effects of\noccupational incumbency over the mid and later portion of\nthe career on the (log of the) risk of retirement or disability.\nIf both estimates are statistically significant, support is indi-\ncated for the idea that occupational positions in both mid\nand late life pattern career endings, net of factors such as\nunemployment, prior labor force mobility, and so on. Occu-\npational mobility or the change in occupational environ-\nments is captured through a set of interaction terms, (V The\nvector of parameter estimates, po\n, further identifies the ef-\nfects of career mobility or discontinuity as reflected by un-\nemployment and movements in and out of the labor force.\nFinally, based on the parameter estimates, pJq\n, we assess\nwhether occupational effects change surrounding mobility\nevents. For example, we test explicitly whether the effect of\noccupational environmental conditions changes after a per-\nson has already experienced retirement and subsequently\nreentered the labor force.\nThe analysis begins by estimating a reduced form model\nincluding the explanatory variables indexing the characteris-\ntics of the longest job and the sociodemographic and family\nbackground characteristics. The reduced form model allows\nus to assess the total effect of occupational incumbency in\nthe longest job (net of the sociodemographic factors). Then,\nthe vectors referencing current occupational conditions and\ncareer mobility events are included in the model. Finally, the\nfull model introduces the traditional retirement determi-\nnants, health status and pension coverage. Comparisons of\nthe full model with earlier models provide the means to as-\nsess the indirect effects of career structure through the tradi-\ntional retirement determinants.\nA pseudo continuous-time hazard modeling approach is\nused to estimate the models. Hierarchical model tests of al-\nternative baseline hazard functions indicate that a third\norder, polynomial function provides the best fit for both the\nretirement and disability events.\nFINDINGS\nTo better understand how career structures influence\ncareer endings, we begin by examining the frequency of oc-\ncupational mobility at the end of the career. The row mobil-\nity counts shown in Table 3 are based on person-years of\nexposure. The frequencies illustrate that both advancement\nand attainment are common features of older men's careers.\nOn average, 42% of exposure in the late career is spent in\noccupations other than the longest occupation (the sum of\nthe off-diagonal elements divided by total exposure). This\nbasic pattern holds regardless of whether mobility is con-\nstrained to only pre-retirement experiences (estimates not\nshown) or whether the full span of late life activity is con-\nsidered. Occupational mobility is not an infrequent occur-\nrence for many older workers. Employment mobility is also\nnot an unusual occurrence. Prior to exiting the labor force,\napproximately 38% of exposure is spent in a different firm\nfrom that reported for the longest job (estimates not\nshown). Employment mobility occurs both for those who\nremain occupational stable as well as for those changing\noccupations, although employer mobility is more strongly\nassociated with occupational changes (in both directions)\nthan occupational stability.\nThe highest rate of occupational retention is among pro-\nfessionals (71%), reflecting both the attractiveness of work\nand the fact that downward mobility is the only alternative.\nThe lowest rates of retention are found in the farm and non-\nfarm laborer occupations (43% and 46%, respectively).\nWell over half of the exposure for workers in these occupa-\ntions is spent elsewhere before the end of the career. It is\nnot surprising that most mobile workers do not move very\nfar, staying within the blue-collar/white-collar boundaries\n--a finding similar to Blau and Duncan's (1967) research\non younger workers.\nTo assess whether occupational origins (i.e., the longest\noccupation in 1966) are associated with the occupational\ndestinations of older workers, we calculated crude ratios of\nTable 3.

For example, the ratio for retention in professional\noccupations is calculated as: (cell frequency/row marginal\nfrequency)/(column marginal frequency/total frequency)\nwere done both for the matrix shown in Table 3 and a pre-\nretirement mobility matrix, and the pattern of results was\nalmost identical (results not shown although the estimates\nare available on request). It is not surprising that occupa-\ntional inheritance (i.e., the expected ratios in the diagonal of\nthe matrix exceeded 1.0) was greater than expected for all\nof the occupational groups. However, despite the amount of\nexposure in the off-diagonal cells, the effects of the longest\noccupation on upward and downward mobility were not es-\npecially strong. A total of eight out of ninety off-diagonal\ncells (four cells denoting upward mobility and four denot-\ning downward mobility) had a stronger than expected rela-\ntionship. Thus, a substantial amount of mobility in the late\ncareer does not appear to be patterned by the longest occu-\npation. Among white-collar workers, downward mobility\nwas exemplified by professionals moving into managerial\npositions, and managers moving into sales occupations.\nMen in sales occupations, however, also moved into man-\nagerial positions at a relatively high rate. Among blue-collar\nworkers, upward mobility occurred by laborers moving into\noperative and service occupations, and farm laborers mov-\ning into service positions. Farm laborers also moved into la-\nborer occupations. Other cases of downward mobility were\nfarmers moving into farm laborer occupations and opera-\ntives moving into laborer occupations.\nThe frequency of retirement and disability events also is\nshown in the occupational cross-classification in Table 3.\nOne common pattern is that downward mobility is associ-\nated with higher rates of retirement (i.e., number of events\nwithin a cell divided by the exposure within a cell). Less\nclear is whether the converse also is true. Upward mobility\nis not associated consistently with lower retirement rates. If\nanything, upward mobility is associated with slightly higher\nretirement rates. While one must be cautious about inferring\ntoo much from these data, the patterns suggest that occupa-\ntional mobility, whether upward or downward, increases re-\ntirement rates. Occupational stability, except among farm\nlaborers, extends the overall length of work life.\nDisability rates are highest for blue-collar workers com-\npared to white-collar workers. The highest disability rates\nare for laborers followed by farm laborers and service\nworkers. The off-diagonal elements are difficult to evaluate\ngiven the sparse data, but downward mobility seems to be\nassociated with a higher rate of disability. Examples in-\nclude men exiting craft occupations for jobs as operatives\nor laborers, and operatives moving to service positions.\nThe multivariate models provide the explicit tests of the\nalternative hypotheses of career structure effects. We focus\nfirst on the results showing how the structural imperatives,\noccupational self-direction and job pressures, combine over\nthe career to affect exiting behavior. As shown in Table 4,\nthe results for the additive models indicate that these occu-\npational features influence both retirement and disability,\nalthough different features come into play depending on the\ncareer stage. As hypothesized, net of the longest occupa-\ntion, the substantive complexity and physical demands of\nthe current occupation significantly influence the risk of re-\ntirement (see Model 3). Men approaching retirement in jobs\nallowing little autonomy, whose tasks are relatively boring\nand mundane, and who work in physically demanding jobs\nhave elevated risks of retirement. These same features of\nthe longest job, however, have no independent effect. These\ncharacteristics of the work environment thus come into play\ndirectly only in jobs held proximate to the retirement event.\nMore surprising is the finding that persons whose longest\noccupation involved significant personal communication\nand dealing with people (e.g., teachers, postal clerks, insur-\nance agents, managers, and sales workers) showed lower\nrates of retirement net of the characteristics of the current\noccupation (see Models 1, 2, and 3). The specific mecha-\nnism is ambiguous, although several post hoc explanations\nare plausible. These types of occupations, for example, im-\npose few barriers for older workers and may imbue workers\nwith a general type of human capital providing a range of\nopportunities in the late career. Alternatively, these types of\noccupations may foster strong work-based social networks\nor social capital which increase workers' long-term ties to\nthe workplace. Both arguments are consistent with the\ncrude estimates that can be gleaned from Table 3. There,\nmanagerial occupations, which rank very high in social\nskill requirements, have very low rates of retirement (crude\nrate = .073 compared to the overall crude rate of .086). So,\ntop, do individuals who work in sales occupations continu-\nously in the late career (crude rate = .061).\nTurning to how these structural imperatives affect dis-\nability, the results suggest generally that self-direction re-\nduces the chances of a health-mandated exit. Model 1 im-\nplies long-term effects; Model 2 implies more immediate\neffects. And, when current health status is introduced in\nModel 3, changes in the parameter estimate of substantive\ncomplexity illustrate that low levels affect a health-man-\ndated exit through health limitations developed on the job.\nThis finding reinforces a growing body of research linking\nautonomy and creativity in the work environment to indi-\nviduals' health and functioning (Moore & Hayward, 1990;\nModel 1 also suggests that the physical and environmen-\ntal demands in the longest occupation elevate the chances\nof disability. Indeed, this is the job factor that most com-\nmonly comes to mind as a precursor of disability. However,\nafter characteristics of the current occupation and labor\nforce mobility are controlled, the physical and environmen-\ntal demands of the longest job no longer have a significant\neffect. The surprise here is the lack of a dominant effect--\neither long-term or short-term--of physical and environ-\nmental demands on disability.\nAlthough disability is not sensitive to physical and envi-\nronmental demands, manipulative skill requirements in\nboth the longest and current jobs have substantial effects.\nManipulative skill requirements in the longest occupation\nreduce the chances of disability (Models 1, 2, and 3), a re-\nsult consistent with a practice or exercise effect where re-\nTable 4.

However, once manipulative skill requirements in\nthe longest job are controlled, these same requirements in\nolder workers' current occupation have the opposite effect.\nThey increase rather than decrease the risk of disability (see\nModels 2 and 3), suggesting that extensive manipulative\nskill requirements of jobs held late in the career have a\n\"wear and tear\" effect on older workers. The results thus\nsuggest that both a practice effect and a \"wear and tear\" ef-\nfect are operating to influence disability, but the effects\ncome into play depending on the stage of the career.\nThe results also demonstrate the importance of the struc-\ntural imperatives, extrinsic rewards and risks and position\nin the organizational structure, for retirement and disability.\nNet of the measures of occupational self-direction and job\npressures, mandatory retirement regulations significantly\nincrease the chances of retirement. Pension coverage also\ninfluences retirement as does current earnings. The earnings\neffect is consistent with earnings' association with pension\nbenefit levels. Although these effects, in and of themselves,\nare not novel, the presence of these effects in combination\nwith the effects of the other structural imperatives illus-\ntrates the variety of ways in which the work environment\naffects retirement behavior.\nA persistent feature of the longest occupation affecting\nretirement is the class of worker. Self-employment substan-\ntially lowers rates of retirement. This relationship is rela-\ntively unaffected when the class of worker of the current\njob is controlled. Moreover, there is no net effect of the\nclass of worker of the current job. This pattern suggests that\nself-employment delays retirement not so much as a conse-\nquence of individuals' adjustments of their labor supply in\naccordance with their health (i.e., an effect that would be\nembodied in the class of worker of the current job) but as a\nconsequence of lower lifetime pension wealth. Unlike\nworkers who make their careers in the private and govern-\nment sectors, self-employed workers bear the burden of\nsaving for retirement.\nThe relative lack of retirement options for self-employed\nworkers also is evident in their high rates of disability. In\nModel 1, self-employment in the longest occupation has\nlong-term consequences for disability. However, when class\nof worker in the current job is controlled, this aspect of the\nlongest occupation is no longer significant. Controlling for\nself-employment in the longest occupation, persons who are\ncurrently self-employed face elevated risks of disability\n(Model 2). This is due largely to the higher prevalence of\npoor health among these workers (Model 3), suggesting that\nself-employment may be a work destination of \"last resort\"\nfor some workers. Self-employment, however, does not ap-\npear to \"accommodate\" the health problems of older workers.\nNot shown in Table 4 are the results testing the two sets\nof interactions contained in the analytic model. One set of\ninteractions allowed us to assess whether the effects of the\ncurrent occupation differed depending on whether workers\nhad ever exited the labor force (and reentered). We tested\nfor this effect and observed that none of the estimates were\nstatistically significant. The effects of the characteristics of\nthe current occupation, therefore, do not differ significantly\nfor persons with continuous work experience compared to\npersons whose current occupation references a post-retire-\nment job. A second set of interactions was considered to\ntest for the effects of occupational mobility on retirement\nand disability. In no instance were any of the interactions of\nlongest and current occupational characteristics statistically\nsignificant, denoting that occupational mobility per se does\nnot influence retirement behavior.\nAlthough occupational mobility per se affects neither re-\ntirement nor disability, other forms of career mobility are\nimportant explanatory factors. Most obvious are the effects\nof unemployment over the career and changes in labor\nforce status. Mobile workers have the highest rates of re-\ntirement. A history of unemployment places workers at\ngreater risk of retirement and the effect increases monotoni-\ncally. As the number of unemployment episodes increases,\nso too does the risk of retirement. A history of movement in\nand out of the labor force also leaves an indelible mark.\nWorkers who have experienced a labor force exit have a\nsignificantly higher chance of retirement relative to stable\nworkers (see Model 3). Employment mobility (i.e., in the\nform of short job tenure) operates in the opposite manner\non retirement. Retirement is postponed for older workers\nwith short tenure. With the closure of retirement options\ncomes higher rates of disability. Short tenure delays retire-\nment primarily through inadequate pension coverage, while\nit leads to disability through the onset of health problems\non the job.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIs the retirement process only a product of the immediate\ncircumstances prior to retirement, or is it embedded in the\nbroader context of the career? On balance, the results of\nthis study support the latter view. The longest occupation\nheld in the mid career combines with occupational roles\nheld in the last stages of the career to influence both retire-\nment and disability. As hypothesized, the specific structural\nimperatives of occupations affecting retirement and disabil-\nity differ depending on the career stage. Net of the charac-\nteristics of one's current position, self-employment and\ngreater social skill requirements of the longest occupation\nlower the chances of retirement. The longest occupation's\nmanipulative skill requirements and substantive complexity\nalso influence the retirement process by reducing the\nchances of disability. Net of the longest occupation, high\nphysical demands and low levels of substantive complexity\nin late career occupations elevate retirement chances. So\ntoo do mandatory retirement regulations and pension bene-\nfits. And, a high level of manipulative skill requirements in-\ncreases the risk of disability. The combination of effects\ndemonstrates the importance of characterizing occupational\npositions in multidimensional terms and taking into account\nthe temporal patterning of positions in order to sort out how\ncareer structures influence the retirement process.\nWe hypothesized that occupational self-direction and job\npressures of jobs held late in the career would influence re-\ntirement to a greater extent than these same features of mid\ncareer occupations. This expectation holds for the most\npart. We also suggested that if such factors have a long-\nterm effect that it would operate through the traditional de-\nterminants of health status and pension characteristics. The\nresults are consistent with this perspective. The substantive\ncomplexity of the longest occupation, for example, nega-\ntively affects disability through the eventual development of\nhealth problems on the job in occupations ranking low on\nthis scale. As noted above, this same feature in the late ca-\nreer reduces the chances of retirement. In the first instance,\nsubstantive complexity (or its absence) gives rise to health\nproblems that eventually mandate labor force withdrawal.\nIn the second instance, substantive complexity defines the\nrelative attractiveness of work and non-work alternatives\nfactoring into the retirement decision. This structural im-\nperative thus combines over the career to influence both\nvoluntary and involuntary career endings.\nThe majority of the effects of the longest occupation op-\nerate through the onset of health problems. We noted the\neffects of physical demands and substantive complexity\nabove. Manipulative skill requirements in the longest job\nhave a protective effect, while these same requirements in\noccupations held later in the career increase the risk of dis-\nability. The key exception to this pattern is the effect of self-\nemployment in the longest occupation. Its effect is consis-\ntent with the argument that self-employed persons are\ndisadvantaged in terms of pension wealth, and hence access\nto retirement, relative to persons working the private and\ngovernment sectors. At the risk of over interpreting the gen-\neral pattern of results, it appears that the long-term effects\nof organizational position operate primarily through pen-\nsion benefits, whereas the long-term effects of occupational\nself-direction and job pressures are felt through the onset of\nhealth problems.\nThe results provided no support for the idea that retire-\nment is hinged to occupational mobility. However, the\nchances of retirement and disability are increased by unem-\nployment and labor force mobility. Retirement and disabil-\nity also are sensitive to employer shifts. Shifts delay the\nonset of retirement while increasing the risk of disability.\nMobility between occupations, therefore, does not seem to\ncarry the same consequences as movements in and out of\nwork and between jobs. In part, this may reflect differences\nin what these events mean in terms of fundamental changes\nin the work role. Unemployment and labor force mobility,\nfor example, both represent major discontinuities in the ca-\nreer and work role. Occupational mobility, at least as experi-\nenced by this sample, does not signal a similar major change\nin the work role. Some support for this idea is provided in\nTable 3 where most moves are short distance moves.\nAt a general level, the results highlight the fact that retire-\nment and disability are not unique labor force behaviors\ncontingent only on one's circumstances in the late career.\nRather, these career endings are the outcomes of the trajec-\ntories of occupational incumbency and labor force mobility.\nKnowledge of both aspects of career structure is thus im-\nportant for understanding the retirement process. The results\nof this study also suggest that knowledge of career struc-\ntures is integral to understanding the broader spectrum of\ncareer achievement. Prior research has tended to focus only\non aspects of workers' current work environment for pro-\nmotion chances, occupational mobility, and wage changes.\nLike retirement, however, these aspects of achievement may\nbe sensitive to the pathways by which workers arrive in\ntheir current positions.\nThe broader substantive implication of these findings is\nthat future changes in the work-to-retirement transition will\nbe sensitive to those changes in career patterns now occur-\nring in American society. Increasingly, researchers and pol-\nicy makers are documenting significant changes in career\npatterns, especially the increase in employment uncertainty\nand the decline in job tenure, brought about by industrial re-\nstructuring, shifts in consumer demand, and technological\nchange. These changes undoubtedly will have a ripple effect\non future shifts in retirement patterns. Although the exact\nform of these changes is uncertain, the results shown here\nindicate the likelihood of growing variability in the work-to-\nretirement transition.\nMany of the recently observed changes in career patterns,\nespecially those brought about through economic restructur-\ning, raise the specter of a withering away of traditional con-\ntracts, both implied and explicit, linking workers and em-\nployers. How, or if, these contracts are being rewritten is not\nyet clear. Simultaneously, the sanctity of Social Security\ncontract between workers and the state is in doubt. The age\neligibility criteria already have been changed for future co-\nhorts, and a significant number of younger Americans lack\nconfidence in the longer term viability of the Social Secu-\nrity system.\nIt is tempting to surmise that retirement is becoming \"de-\ninstitutionalized.\" However, this may not be the case. As\nyet, though the character of the traditional social contracts\nmay be changing, none of the key institutional actors ap-\npears to have abandoned retirement as a reward for a life-\ntime of work commitment or a means of social control. In-\nstead, the diversity of the work-to-retirement transition may\nrepresent a broadening of the institution of retirement. In-\ncreasingly, the institution is reflective of the assortment of\npathways forged and contested by the key institutional ac-\ntors, the state, employers, and workers themselves.\n"
