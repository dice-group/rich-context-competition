Two hundred and fifty patients were issued with questionnaires and\nunderwent a physical examination and blood test.Risk factors for ED were identified using\nunivariate and multivariate analyses.\nResults: In total, 222 participants returned valid questionnaires (89% response rate), underwent a\nphysical examination and blood test, and were included in the study. The most common\ncardiovascular diseases were hypertension (n \u00bc 142; 64%), coronary heart disease (n \u00bc 90; 41%)\nand angina pectoris (n \u00bc 78; 35%). Most patients (n \u00bc 144; 65%) had two or more cardiovascular\ndiseases. Age, smoking, body mass index, total cholesterol level, hypertension and the ratio of total\ncholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly associated with ED. Domestic\nlocation, level of education, participation in physical activity, diabetes and drinking alcohol were not\nassociated with ED.\nConclusions: Common risk factors for cardiovascular disease are associated with ED in patients\nwith cardiovascular disease. This study furthers understanding of the risk factors for ED in Chinese\npatients with cardiovascular disease and paves the way for further research into the prevention of ED.\n",

This research\nprovides data on the relationship of these\ninterrelated diseases from a fast developing\ncity in China.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nThis study recruited patients with cardio-\nvascular disease who visited the inpatient\nDepartment of Cardiovascular Medicine at\nthe Xi'an Jiaotong University First\nAffiliated Hospital, Xi'an, China between\nsample size and power were not predeter-\nmined as this was a time-specified study. All\nparticipants had at least one of the following\ncardiovascular diseases: hypertension (con-\ntrolled by medication); coronary heart dis-\nease (diagnosed by cardiac catheterization\nstudy and treadmill); arrhythmia (confirmed\nby electrocardiogram); angina or myocar-\ndial infarction. All participants had normal\nthinking ability, independent judgement,\nclarity of thought, ability to answer ques-\ntions and were willing to co-operate in the\nstudy. Patients were excluded if they abused\nalcohol, were diagnosed with a psycho-\nlogical disease including psychological ED,\nhad high lactation hyperlipidaemia, primary\ngonadal syndrome, a pituitary tumour,\nbilateral or unilateral cryptorchidism, tes-\nticular inflammation, severe anaemia, a\nprostate tumour, a genital mutilation\ndeformity, a spinal cord injury, urinary\ngenital mutilation, sexual maldevelopment,\nsex hormone disease, thyroid disease, an\nendocrine system disease such as hyperthy-\nroidism, systemic lupus erythematosus, a\nconnective tissue disease, a malignant\ntumour, a blood system disease, severe\nliver or renal damage or a sexually trans-\nmitted disease. Patients were also excluded if\nthey were critically ill or were unable to\nindependently complete the investigation.\nStudy procedures\nParticipants answered a questionnaire, pro-\nyears), marital status, level of education,\neconomic situation, lifestyle, occupation,\nfamily, smoking status, alcohol consump-\ntion, level of physical activity and medical\nhistory (presence of hypertension, diabetes,\nhyperlipidaemia, coronary artery disease,\narrhythmia, peripheral vascular disease and\ncerebrovascular illness). All participants\nunderwent a general examination at which\nblood pressure, height, weight, waist and hip\ncircumference and other indicators were\nmeasured; routine blood and urine labora-\ntory examinations were also performed to\ndetermine liver and kidney profile, total\ncholesterol level, ratio of total cholesterol\nto high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-\nterol, fasting plasma glucose level, random\nblood glucose level and blood glucose level\n2 h after an oral glucose tolerance test. Body\nmass index (BMI) was calculated from\nheight and weight data. Blood pressure\nwas classified as normal, mild hypertension,\nmoderate hypertension or severe hyperten-\nsion according to the 2010 Guidelines for the\nPrevention and Treatment of Hypertension\nin China.10 Diabetes mellitus (DM) was\ndiagnosed according to the American\nDiabetes Association11 as a fasting plasma\nglucose !7.0 mmol/l, a random blood sugar\nafter an oral glucose tolerance test.\nErectile dysfunction was diagnosed if\npatients reported that they were unable to\nreach the erectile level necessary to perform\nsexual intercourse or had difficulty main-\ntaining an adequate erection, and were\nunable to attain a satisfactory sex life for\n!6 months prior to the date of diagnosis. As\npart of the questionnaire, participants com-\npleted the International Index of Erectile\nFunction 5 (IIEF-5).12 ED was classified as\nsevere if the IIEF-5 score was 7, moderate\nif the IIEF-5 score was 8\u00ad11, moderate to\nEthics statement\nBefore the study began, the Xi'an Jiaotong\nUniversity Ethics Committee approved the\nstudy plan, the method of obtaining\ninformed consent from all participants and\nthe statement of written informed consent.\nThe study met all ethical principles for\nmedical research involving human partici-\npants and did not invade the patients'\nprivacy.

The data obtained from hospi-\ntalized patients have high stability and\naccuracy, thus the use of hospitalized\npatients is an effective way to avoid infor-\nmation bias.13 In addition, standardized\nsurvey processes were used, with uniform\ndiagnostic criteria and reliable data filtering\nto reduce the risk of mixed bias and to\nincrease the validity of these results.\nA previous report suggested that the\nincidence of ED in patients with cardiovas-\ncular disease was similar in urban and rural\nareas.14 With the ongoing development of\nthe Chinese economy, the difference between\nurban and rural areas will continue to\ndecrease, and cardiovascular disease will\nFigure 1.

A low level of physical exercise,\nobesity and high blood cholesterol are all\nrisk factors for ED.17\nAs societies develop, the average lifespan\nincreases,18 and the health-related quality of\nlife as individuals age becomes of increasing\nconcern.19 ED shows a close relationship\nwith old age.20 The perception among the\nTable 3.

This is consistent with the\nresults of existing research results in China\nand abroad. A meta-analysis by Tengs and\nOsgood showed that smoking was an\nimportant factor in ED,29 and the Zhang\nQingjiang study reported that the incidence\nof ED was 42.3% in individuals who\nsmoked >20 cigarettes/day.24 In this study,\nno statistically significant relationship was\nfound between alcohol consumption and\nED, which supports the report of Nicolosi\nObesity increases the risk of cardiovascu-\nlar disease and can also affect the function of\nthe endocrine system.31 BMI is a simple\nheight-to-weight ratio, which, with the body\nfat percentage content, has major relevance\nto CHD.32 Obesity is an independent risk\nfactor for coronary heart disease and\nrisk of coronary heart disease in patients\nwith high blood pressure, diabetes and\ndyslipidaemia.35 Here, BMI was signifi-\ncantly associated with ED in patients with\ncardiovascular disease. There are several\nmechanisms by which obesity may increase\nthe risk of ED. The high blood pressure,\nhigh blood sugar and high blood cholesterol\nassociated with obesity will accelerate the\nformation of atherosclerotic plaques, which\nwill have an effect on penile artery endothe-\nlium and blood flow dynamics.36 Endocrine\nfactors, such as reduced testosterone ketone\nsecretion, and increased female hormone\nsecretion can also impact ED.37 Obesity\nTable 5.

In addition, a large amount of fat\nin the abdominal area and around the fat\npad at the base of the penis can be an\nobstacle to sexual performance.38\nStudies on the relationship between\nmetabolism of blood lipids and erectile\nfunction are common both in China and in\nother countries.39 Gholami et al.40 concluded\nthat hyperlipidaemia not only affects the\nvascular smooth muscle tissue of the penis,\nbut also affects the peripheral cavernous\nnerve. Seftel et al.41 reported that between\nUSA had hyperlipidaemia-related ED.\nA decrease in high density lipoprotein an\nelevation of total cholesterol/HDL are both\ncorrelated with ED42 and are important risk\nfactors for ED.43 Results of the present study\nfurther indicate that the ratio of total chol-\nesterol to HDL cholesterol is a risk factor\nfor ED.\nHypertension may also be caused by\nmental and neurological factors,44 problems\nwith the renin-angiotensin system,45 sodium\nretention (which leads to increased extracel-\nlular water and increased heart output\nvolume),46 or genetic factors.47 Results of\nthe present study showed that 76.1% of\npatients with essential hypertension had ED\nand that hypertension was a risk factor\nfor ED.\nUnivariate logistic regression analysis\nshowed that DM was not significantly\nassociated with ED, which may have been\ndue to the good control of blood sugar levels\nby the patients with DM involved in this\nstudy.\nOne limitation of this study was that the\nsample size and power were not\npredetermined.\nIn conclusion, this study confirms\nthat risk factors for cardiovascular disease,\ni.e. economic situation, smoking, hyperten-\nsion, coronary heart disease, diabetes and\ntotal cholesterol are also risk factors for ED.\nThis study furthers our understanding of\nthe risk factors for ED in Chinese patients\nwith cardiovascular disease and paves the\nway for further research regarding preven-\ntion of ED.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors had no conflicts of interest to declare\nin relation to this article.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
