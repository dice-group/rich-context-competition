Such supplements\ncontributed significantly to total daily dietary intakes of\nvitamins and minerals.\nConclusions: A large number of US children and ado-\nlescents use vitamin and mineral supplements, which for\nmost may not be medically indicated. Such supple-\nments contribute significantly to total dietary intakes of\nvitamins and minerals, and studies of nutrition should\ninclude their assessment. Since vitamin and mineral\nsupplement users report greater health care access, health\ncare providers may be in a position to provide screening\nand counseling regarding dietary adequacy and indica-\ntions for supplement use.\nmineral (VM) use is common\nintheUnitedStates.1-3 Therea-\nsons for VM supplementa-\ntion appear to be multifacto-\nrial and such supplements are largely\ndeemed unnecessary if one has a varied\ndiet.4-6 Still, almost $2 billion is spent an-\nnuallyonVMsupplements,andtheyarethe\nthird most common category of medica-\ntions used in the United States.7 Multivita-\nminpreparationsforolderchildrenandado-\nlescents are not regulated by the Food and\nDrug Administration and may result in ad-\nverse effects ranging from nausea, vomit-\ning, and abdominal pain to increased cere-\nbrospinal pressure, liver abnormalities, and\nneuropathy.8 TheAmericanAcademyofPe-\ndiatrics does not recommend supplemen-\ntal vitamin use for healthy children older\nthan 1 year who consume a varied diet.\nSupplemental vitamins are only recom-\nmended for certain groups of children, eg,\nthose with chronic diseases, eating disor-\nders, malabsorption, and liver disease and\nobese children in weight loss programs.8\nResearch focusing on the association of\nVM use with nutrition practices and physi-\ncal activity has been conducted mainly in\na theoretical framework that examine the\nrelationship of VM use with food secu-\nrity and health care access are limited.

Constructs of the HBM have successfully\nbeen applied to explain and improve preventive health\nbehaviors and health care use behaviors in adults, such\nas folate consumption for the prevention of neural tube\ndefects and calcium supplementation for the preven-\ntion of osteoporosis.12-15 According to this model, an in-\ndividual will take a health-related action if he or she feels\nand expects that it will help avoid a negative condi-\ntion.16 Constructs of the HBM include perceived suscep-\ntibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and per-\nceived barriers to performing the action. The HBM may\nexplain why some individuals may choose to use VM\nsupplements (perceptions that one's diet is inadequate,\nVM deficiency affects health, or using VM supplements\nwill benefit health or stimulate appetite; individual fi-\nnancial ability to afford VM supplements; and health care\nprovider guidance with respect to the need for VM\nsupplementation).\nBased on theoretical constructs of the HBM, we pos-\nited that VMs might be used to ameliorate the adverse\neffects of less healthy nutrition, lower food security, and\nlower levels of physical activity or as insurance against\nbarriers to full health care access. Using data from the\nSurvey (NHANES), we tested the following hypotheses:\n(1) VM use is higher in children and adolescents with\nunhealthy nutrition habits compared with those with\nhealthy nutrition habits, (2) VM use is higher in chil-\ndren and adolescents who experience lower food secu-\nrity compared with those who experience greater food\nsecurity, (3) VM use is higher in children and adoles-\ncents with lower levels of physical activity compared with\nthose with higher levels of physical activity, (4) VM use\nis higher in children and adolescents who have lower\nhealth care access compared with those who have higher\nhealth care access, and (5) VM use is higher in under-\nweight children and adolescents compared with those who\nare not underweight.\nMETHODS\nally representative data on comprehensive dietary supplement\nuse in the United States. Sampling weights were used to pro-\nduce population estimates, and subgroups oversampled in-\ncluded those with low incomes as well as African American in-\ndividuals, Mexican American individuals, and adolescents.17 The\nsurvey entailed administration of a questionnaire, a house-\nhold interview, and a medical examination. Signed consent was\nprovided by parents of all children, and adolescents addition-\nally signed an information form.\nyears, who had parent- or guardian-reported response to the\nVM supplement intake question and measured height and\ninterview component were approximately 82% and comple-\ntion rates for the medical examination component were 77%.17\nIntake of VM in the NHANES database was measured by deter-\nmining whether the child had used any VM supplements in the\n30 days prior to the interview, as well as the frequency and du-\nration of supplement use. Parents were shown a card with ex-\namples of multiple types of VM supplements. Interviewers ad-\nditionally recorded names of supplements from container labels.\nIf a container was unavailable, the interviewer asked for the ex-\nact name of the product. If the exact name was unknown, gen-\neral category of VM supplement was assessed. Trained NHANES\nnutritionists subsequently matched and categorized supple-\nment databases on standardized classification rules.17\nDemographic characteristics of subjects included age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity, country of birth, poverty status, and food secu-\nrity. We stratified the age variable into the following 3 catego-\nries: 2 to 4 years (preschool age), 5 to 11 years (school age),\nand 12 to 17 years (adolescents). We categorized poverty sta-\ntus into the following 3 categories: living below the poverty\nlevel (1 poverty income ratio), near poor (1 to 2 poverty\nincome ratio), and nonpoor (2 poverty income ratio). Food\nsecurity data were classified within the NHANES as food\nsecure, marginally food secure, food insecure without hunger,\nand food insecure with hunger. Additional information on\nfood security in the NHANES relates to receipt of food assis-\ntance in the form of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program\nfor Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits, food\nstamps, and reduced-price or free school meals.\nMedical and health care access factors included current health\nstatus, long-term health problems, health insurance coverage,\naccess to a routine place for health care, place used most often\nfor health care, number of times health care was received over\nthe past year, and length of time since last health care visit. We\nused measured height and weight to calculate age- and sex-\nspecific body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilo-\ngrams divided by height in meters squared). We then classi-\nfied BMI as underweight (fifth BMI percentile), healthy weight\nNutrition behavior was assessed during the NHANES inter-\nview by the number of times per week restaurant food was eaten,\nnumber of times per month dark-green vegetables were eaten,\nand frequency of milk consumption in the past 30 days. The\nfrequency of milk consumption was reported as never, rarely\n(less than once a week), sometimes (once a week or more but\nless than once a day), or often (once a day or more). Nutrient\nintake was determined from foods and beverages reported in\nthe 24-hour dietary recall. Intake of micronutrients com-\nmonly present in multivitamin and mineral supplements was\nadditionally considered. The intake of each nutrient variable\nwas categorized into terciles prior to analysis.\nPhysical activity was assessed during the NHANES inter-\nview by determining the frequency and duration of walking or\nbicycling over the past month for those 12 years and older. The\nlevel of self-reported physical activity in the past month was\nclassified in the NHANES database as vigorous (causing heavy\nsweating or a large increase in breathing or heart rate for at least\n10 minutes) or moderate activity (causing light sweating or a\nslight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate for at least\n10 minutes). Subjects were also asked to compare their level\n\u00a92009 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nof physical activity with others of the same age. Sedentary ac-\ntivity was assessed by asking about the number of hours per\nday of television/video viewing and computer use.\nData were analyzed using SAS for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc,\nCary, North Carolina) and SUDAAN (Research Triangle Insti-\ntute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina), a statistical pack-\nage that accounts for the complex survey design of the NHANES.\nAll analyses were weighted and adjusted for nonresponse to be\nrepresentative of the US population. 2 Tests were used to com-\npare the prevalence of VM use by sociodemographic, health sta-\ntus, health care access, nutrition, and physical activity charac-\nteristics. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine\nassociations of VM use with age, sex, race/ethnicity, country\nof birth, and poverty. In addition, independent associations with\nnutritional factors, food security, physical activity, and health\ncare access were assessed controlling for race and poverty\ninteractions.\nRESULTS\nold children and adolescents in our sample had taken a\nVM supplement (Table 1). Almost half of children and\nadolescents took VM supplements daily.\nSociodemographic Characteristics\nand Food Security\nPrevalence of VM use was significantly higher in younger\nage groups, with the prevalence in 2- to 4-year-olds,\nsignificant difference in VM use by sex. Non-Hispanic\nwhiteindividualswerestatisticallysignificantlymorelikely\nto be users of VM supplements and non-Hispanic Afri-\ncan American individuals were least likely to be VM us-\ners. Children and adolescents born in the United States\nand those living in households with higher incomes were\nmore likely to use VM supplements. Users of VM supple-\nments were more likely to live in households that were\nfully food secure or experienced food insecurity with hun-\nger than in households that were marginally food se-\ncure or food insecure without hunger. Additionally, us-\ners of VM supplements were more likely to live with adults\nwho were fully food secure or experienced food insecu-\nrity with hunger than with adults who were marginally\nfood secure or experienced food insecurity without hun-\nger. Analysis of child and adolescent food security dem-\nonstrated a statistically significant relationship with VM\nuse; the prevalence of VM supplement use was highest\namong those whose food quality and quantity remained\nunaffected (36.1%) and declined if children or adoles-\ncents were marginally food secure (26.2%), experi-\nenced reduced food quality or quantity (23.9%), and ex-\nperienced food insecurity with hunger (15%). Users of\nVM supplements were significantly less likely to receive\nfood assistance in the form of WIC benefits, food stamps,\nand reduced-price or free school meals (Table 1).\nHealth Status and Health Care Access\nUse of VM supplements was significantly higher in chil-\ndren and adolescents whose health status was reported as\nthose whose health status was reported as good (26.7%)\nor fair/poor (28.3%). There was no association of VM\nsupplement use with self-reported long-term health im-\npairment. Use of VM supplements showed a statistically\nsignificant relationship with BMI category; the preva-\nlence of VM use was highest among those who were un-\nderweight (41.6%) and declined in those who were a\n(28.6%). Those with health insurance coverage were more\nlikely to use VM supplements compared with those with-\nout health insurance. Children and adolescents who re-\nported having a routine place to go for health care were\nsignificantlymorelikelytouseVMsupplementsthanthose\nwithout a routine place to go for health care. Use of VM\nsupplements was more prevalent in children and adoles-\ncents whose usual source of health care was a physician's\noffice or freestanding health maintenance organization\n(38.5%), compared with those whose usual source of care\nwas a community health center (24.6%) or an emergency\ndepartment(18.0%).Analysisofthenumberoftimeshealth\ncare was received over the past year demonstrated a sta-\ntistically significant relationship with VM use; the preva-\nlence of VM supplement use was highest among those who\nreceivedhealthcare4ormoretimesinthelastyear(39.1%)\nand was lowest if no health care was obtained in the last\nyear (25.3%). Children and adolescents who reported re-\nceiving health care services more frequently over the past\nyear(4timesperyear)alsoreportedmoreVMuse.Those\nwho reported their last health care visit to have occurred\nin the past year were significantly more likely to use VM\nsupplements than those who had health care visits 2 or\nmore years ago (Table 2).\nNutrition and Physical Activity\nUse of VM supplements was lowest in children and ado-\nlescents who never ate restaurant food or ate it less than\nweekly (29.3%), compared with those who ate restau-\nrant food 1 or more times a week (35.9%). There was no\nrelationship of VM supplement use with frequency of\ndark-green vegetable consumption. Use of VM supple-\nments was significantly associated with frequency of milk\nconsumption in the past 30 days. When dietary intakes\nof specific nutrients were assessed, those with higher di-\netary fiber intake, lower-tercile total fat, and lower- and\nmiddle tercile cholesterol intake reported higher VM use.\nThere was no difference in VM use with respect to di-\netary intake of energy, protein, carbohydrates, total sug-\nars, and total saturated fat. Those with higher intakes of\nmicronutrients commonly present in VM supplements,\nnamely vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin\n, folic acid, vitamin B12\n, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and\nzinc, all had greater reported VM use.\nSubjects 12 years and older who participated in vigor-\nous physical activity in the past month and who reported\nthat they were more physically active compared with oth-\ners of the same age were significantly more likely to use\n\u00a92009 American Medical Association.

However, in\ncontrast to what we expected to find, children and ado-\nlescents with healthier nutrition, more active lifestyles,\ngreater food security, and greater health care access were\nmore likely to use VM supplements.\nPublished literature supports the high prevalence of VM\nuse. More than half of all 3-year-olds in the 1991 Longi-\ntudinal Follow-up to the 1988 National Maternal and In-\nfantHealthSurveyusedaVMsupplement.9 Consistentwith\nour study's findings, children who received supplementa-\ntiontendedtohaveeatingproblemsorpoorappetites.Moth-\ners who gave their children supplements were more likely\nto be non-Hispanic white, married, and older and have\nhighereducationandgreaterhouseholdincomethanmoth-\nerswhodidnotgivetheirchildrensupplements.9 Datafrom\nthe 1981 Child Health Supplement to the National Health\nInterview Survey (NHIS) demonstrate that approximately\n50% of children from birth to 6 years of age received a VM\ndren aged 2 to 6 years received VM supplements in the pre-\nvious 2 weeks.1 Results from the Fourth Child and Ado-\nlescentTrialforCardiovascularHealthstudydemonstrated\nthatoneinfour12thgradersusedVMsupplements.4,11 Con-\nsistent with our findings, other studies have demon-\nstrated that adolescents who use VM supplements tend to\nhave more healthful diets, lower television viewing, greater\nlevels of physical activity, greater participation in team and\norganized sports, and less obesity than those who do not.4,5\nMore recently, Picciano et al20 examined dietary supple-\nment use among infants, children, and adolescents in the\netary supplement use was associated with higher family in-\ncome, not participating in the WIC program, a smoke-\nfreeenvironment,lessscreen-viewingtime(television,video\ngames, and computer use), and lower BMI. The associa-\ntion of dietary supplement (specifically VM) use with nu-\ntrition, food security, physical activity, and health care ac-\ncess was not examined.20 Therefore, analyses of other\nnational data sets show demographic and lifestyle charac-\nteristicassociationssimilartothoseinourstudy,withhigher\nVM use among non-Hispanic white individuals and those\nwith higher socioeconomic status, healthier diets, and level\nof physical activity as well as those with less obesity.\nDixon et al21 analyzed the Third NHANES to deter-\nmine if dietary intakes and serum nutrient levels dif-\nfered between adults from food-insufficient and food-\nsufficientfamilies.Afteradjustingforfamilyincome,adults\nfrom food-insufficient families had lower intakes of milk\nproducts, fruits and vegetables, energy, calcium, vita-\nmin E, vitamin B6\n, iron, and zinc. Our study did not find\nany association between adult or child food security and\nVM use after controlling for poverty.\nStrengths of our study are that the NHANES yields a\nnationally representative sample and provides respon-\ndent sampling weights to account for nonresponse and se-\nlection bias. The in-person interview and rigorous meth-\nodsofclassifyingVMsupplementsenablehigh-qualitydata\ncollection. We acknowledge the following limitations of\nthis study: (1) We did not include other dietary supple-\nment use in our analyses; the rationale for focusing on VM\nsupplementswasthatpublisheddatademonstratethatVMs\nare the most commonly used dietary supplements both in\nchildren and adults.2 (2) Analysis of individual compo-\nnents of VM preparations was beyond the scope of this\nstudy.(3)TheNHANESdatauseashortreferenttimeframe\nof the past 30 days to assess VM supplement use. Al-\nthough this time frame is used to increase accuracy of self-\nreport and for comparability with other NHANES data, it\nmay not provide a complete picture of VM use. For ex-\nample, the short time frame may not capture episodic use\nof VM supplements, such as supplemental vitamin C use\nduring viral upper respiratory tract infections, if the most\nrecent infection was prior to the 30-day period. (4) Since\nNHANES data are cross-sectional, analyses of VM supple-\nment use with the lifestyle and health conditions mea-\nsured in NHANES cannot presume causality, but only an\nassociation. In spite of these limitations, we believe that\nthe results of our study offer guidance to health care pro-\nviders on the extent of data gathering and counseling\nneeded regarding diet, physical activity, and VM supple-\nment use during clinical encounters.\nOur study indicates that children and adolescents who\nmay face the greatest risks for VM deficiencies, such as\nthose with less healthy nutrition and activity patterns,\ngreater obesity, lower income, lower food security, poorer\nhealth, and lower health care access, use VM supple-\nments the least. There exist multiple competing de-\nmands for limited financial resources in families facing\nfinancial disparities, and purchasing VM supplements to\nmitigate the ill effects of a suboptimal diet might not take\nprecedence for such families. Thus, although individu-\nals' perceptions within the framework of the HBM may\nplay a role in their intentions to use VM supplements,\nmodifying factors, such as financial ability to purchase\nVM supplements, as depicted in the Figure, may super-\nsede such intentions. We also note that sociodemo-\ngraphic factors influencing VM supplement use are simi-\nlar to those affecting health behaviors related to\nIndividual\nperceptions\nModifying\nfactors\nLikelihood of\naction\nPerceived\nsusceptibility or\nseriousness of disease\n(poor nutrition and\nlack of physical\nactivity adversely\naffects health; VM\ndeficiencies adversely\naffect health; food\ninsecurity may\nincrease risk of VM\ndeficiency)\nPerceived threat of\ndisease (underweight\nchildren and\nadolescents can have\nVM deficiencies)\nHigher income\n(financial ability to\npurchase VM\nsupplements)\nCues to action\n(parental knowledge\nof indications of VM\nsupplement use,\nrecommendations by\nhealth care provider\non medical indications\nfor VM use)\nPerceived benefits\nvs barriers to\nbehavior change (VM\nsupplements prevent\nVM deficiency; backup\nin case diet does not\nprove adequate)\nLikelihood of behavior\nchange (using VM\nsupplement)\nFigure.

Because of greater health care access of VM supple-\nment users, health care providers are well positioned to\nscreen patients regarding nutritional quality of their diet\nand VM supplement use. Health care providers can then\ncounsel parents that the American Academy of Pediatrics\ndoes not recommend use of VM supplements in children\nand adolescents with varied and healthy diets. It is impor-\ntant to counsel parents of underweight children that use\nof VM supplements is not a substitute for a physiologi-\ncally appropriate diet. Our study also suggests that since\nVM supplements contribute significantly to total dietary\nintakes of vitamins and minerals, epidemiologic and clini-\ncal studies of nutrition should include assessment of VM\nsupplement use. Further qualitative research is needed to\nexplore the relative importance of factors that influence\nparental decision to use VM supplements for their chil-\ndren, especially in those groups of children who face the\nhighest risks of VM deficiencies.\nCorrespondence:UlfatShaikh,MD,MPH,UniversityofCali-\nforniaDavisSchoolofMedicine,2516StocktonBlvd,Room\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design: Shaikh\nand Byrd.
