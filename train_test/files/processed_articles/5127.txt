The present study aimed to\ninvestigate differences associated with age\nand gender in the incidence of hyperplasia in\nindividual cervical vertebrae as seen on CT\nmultiplanar reconstruction images.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nData from consecutive patients presenting\nwith neck discomfort who had undergone\n64-section spiral CT of the cervical spine\nat the Department of Radiology, Taian City\nCentral Hospital, Shandong Province, China,\nwere retrieved retrospectively. Patients with a\nhistory of trauma of the cervical spine, infect-\nive or inflammatory conditions of the spine,\ncervical tumours, dysplasia, metabolic disease\nor surgical procedures of the cervical spine\nwere excluded from the study.\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nEthics Committee of the Taian City Central\nHospital, Shandong Province, China. The\nrequirement for patient consent was waived\ndue to the retrospective nature of the study.\nImage analysis\nAll patients had undergone a 64-section\nspiral CT scan of the cervical spine in a\nsupine position with the head advanced\nusing a SOMATOM Sensation 64 CT scan-\nner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The\nscanning parameters used were a tube cur-\nscan slice of 3.0 mm, a scan interval of\n3.0 mm, a sharp kernel (B60s) and a field\nscanning, three-dimensional reconstruction\nwas performed using a slice thickness of\nCervical hyperplasia was defined as the\npresence of one or more of the following\nfeatures on the CT scan: lip-like or lace-like\nappearance of the anterior, posterior, super-\nior or inferior edge of the vertebral body,\nlace-like appearance , osteophytes or a bone\nbridge formed by fusion of two adjacent\nosteophytes.6 CT scans were analyzed inde-\npendently by two experienced radiologists\n(Q.K. and S.L.) who were blinded to each\nother's assessment and to the patient's\ninformation. Any discrepancy was resolved\nby discussion.\nStatistical analyses\nData was presented as the number of\npatients or as the mean \u00c6 SD. Associations\nbetween age and gender and the presence of\nhyperplasia in different cervical vertebrae\nwere analyzed using one-way analysis of\nvariance and the 2-test. A P-value < 0.05\nwas considered to be statistically significant.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS software version 17 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA).\nResults\nA total of 580 patients were included in the\nfemale. They ranged in age from 13 to\nwere seen on computed tomography\n(Figure 1). The distribution of hyperplasia\nin the individual cervical vertebrae is given\nin Table 1. Hyperplasia occurred with the\nhighest frequency in C2 (25%), followed by\nsignificantly more likely to occur in C1 and\nC2 than in the other cervical vertebrae\n(P < 0.05). The incidence of hyperplasia\nwas higher in females than in males in C1,\nThe mean\u00c6 SD ages of patients with\nhyperplasia according to the cervical vertebra\naffected are given in Table 2 and Figure 2.\nThere was a significant difference (P< 0.05) in\nthe age of patients according to the cervical\nvertebra affected, with patients with C2 hyper-\nplasia being the youngest, followed by patients\nwith C1 hyperplasia, while patients with C7\nhyperplasia were the oldest (Table 2). In\npatients with C2, C1 or C7 hyperplasia, male\npatients were significantly younger than\nfemale patients, while in patients with C3,\nC4, C5 or C6 hyperplasia, female patients\nwere significantly younger than male patients.\nFigure 1.

(d) Cervical sagittal multiplanar reconstruction image in a\n66-year-old female showing hyperplasia of C1, C2, C5 and C6.\nDiscussion\nHyperplasia of the upper cervical spine\nvertebrae and of the posterior edge of\nvertebrae in the lower cervical spine are\ndifficult to detect using plain film X-rays.5,7,8\nIn contrast, CT multiplanar reconstruction\nis able to show the detailed structure of the\nvertebral bodies5,9\u00ad13 and was therefore used\nin the present study to document hyperpla-\nsia of the cervical vertebrae.\nPrevious studies have reported that hyper-\nplasia of C1 and C2 (the atlas and axis) is seen\nmostly in patients with cervical spine\nthe last of the cervical vertebrae to develop\nhyperplasia of C1 and C2 was seen at a\nconsistent with previous studies, and occurred\nat a younger age in male compared with\nfemale patients. In addition, hyperplasia\noccurred with the highest frequency in C2,\nwhich is in contrast to previously published\nreports. However, in most of the previously\nreported studies, conventional plain film X-\nrays were used, in which the upper cervical\nspine overlaps with maxillofacial structures.\nAs a result, such films only show the distance\nbetween the odontoid process of the axis and\nthe lateral mass of the atlas, with mild bone\nhyperplasia being poorly demonstrated.5,7,8\nIn the present study CT multiplanar three-\ndimensional reconstruction was used, which\nis the gold standard for the detection of\nosteoarthritis of C1 and C2.10 In addition,\nfew studies have focused on the C1/C2 region,\nalthough these joints make a significant con-\ntribution to the mobility of the spine.16\u00ad18\nThe present study revealed that C2 is the\nearliest and the most frequently affected ver-\ntebra in cervical hyperplasia, followed by C1.\nTable 2.

Gender distribution of hyperplasia in\nindividual cervical vertebrae as seen on computed\ntomography.\nVertebra\nMale\nFemale\nAll patients\nData presented as number of patients (%).\nThis may be explained by the anatomical\nrelationships of the cervical vertebrae and\ntheir movements. The cervical spine moves\nmore than 600 times each hour,2 with consid-\nerable impact on the atlas and axis. C1 and C2\nare highly specialized vertebrae that provide\nconsiderable mobility for the skull and cer-\nvical spine in terms of rotation, flexion and\nextension.19 A greater degree of rotation is\npossible at the atlanto-axial joint than between\nthe other cervical vertebrae. Rotation occurs\naround the odontoid process, with a range of\nmovement of about 45. As a whole, the neck\ncan rotate up to 90, half of which occurs at\nthe atlanto-axial joint,20,21 with the other half\nbeing due to rotation of the other cervical\nvertebrae. Once the head and upper cervical\nvertebrae have rotated by 20\u00ad30, the lower\ncervical vertebrae then rotate in order to\ncomplete the entire 90 rotation. The atlas\nand axis are therefore involved early in\ncervical movements and are responsible for a\nlarge part of the activity range of the neck.\nThe present study also found that C7 was\nthe last vertebrae to show hyperplasia. This\nmay due to the fact that C7 mobility is less\nthan that of the other cervical vertebrae.\nIn the present study, hyperplasia in C1,\nC2 and C7 occurred at a younger age in\nmales than in females, whereas hyperplasia\nin C3, C4, C5 and C6 occurred at a younger\nage in females than in males. In addition, the\nincidence of hyperplasia was higher in\nand C7. The reasons for these differences are\nnot clear and warrant further study.\nOne major weakness of the present study\nis its retrospective design, with the possibil-\nity of selection bias. In addition, the study\nfocused on bone hyperplasia and did not\nconsider changes to the intervertebral discs\nor early cystic degenerative changes in the\nodontoid process,3 and the hyperplasia was\nnot graded. The study also did not analyze\nother factors that may affect bone hyperpla-\nsia, such as occupation and hormone levels.\nLastly, the study did not investigate the\nrelationship between hyperplasia seen on\nCT images and clinical symptoms.\nIn conclusion, the present study showed\nthe pattern of development of cervical verte-\nbra hyperplasia, with associated differences\nin age and gender. C2 was the most fre-\nquently affected vertebra, with a female\npredominance. These findings may be helpful\nfor the early recognition of cervical hyper-\nplasia and highlight the importance of pro-\ntecting the atlanto-axial joint in daily life.\nMale, no hyperplasia\nMale, hyperplasia\nFemale, no hyperplasia\nFemale, hyperplasia\nTotal, no hyperplasia\nTotal, hyperplasia\nAge (years)\nFigure 2.
