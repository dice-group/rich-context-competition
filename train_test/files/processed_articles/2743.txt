Results have immediate implications because of the\nongoing implementation of new nutrition standards for\nthe National School Lunch Program.\nObjective: To determine if state laws with stricter school\nmeal nutrition standards are inversely associated with ado-\nlescent weight status, while controlling for unmeasured\nstate-level confounders.\nDesign: Quasi-experiment.\nSetting: Public schools.\nParticipants: Four thousand eight hundred seventy\neighth-grade students in 40 states. Students were cat-\negorized by type of school lunch they usually obtained\n(free/reduced price, regular price, or none).\nInterventions: State laws governing school meal nu-\ntrition standards. States with standards that exceeded US\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) school meal stan-\ndards were compared with states that did not exceed USDA\nstandards. The parameter of interest was the interaction\nbetween state laws and student lunch participant status,\nie, whether disparities in weight status between school\nlunch participants and nonparticipants were smaller in\nstates with stricter standards.\nMain Outcome Measures: Body mass index percen-\ntile and obesity status.\nResults: In states that exceeded USDA standards, the\ndifference in obesity prevalence between students who\nobtained free/reduced-price lunches and students who\ndid not obtain school lunches was 12.3 percentage\nstates that did not exceed USDA standards. Likewise,\ndifferences in mean body mass index percentile between\nthose student populations were 11 units smaller in states\n4.3). There was little evidence that students compen-\nsated for school meal laws by purchasing more sweets,\nsalty snacks, or sugar-sweetened beverages from other\nschool venues (eg, vending machines) or other sources\n(eg, fast food).\nConclusions and Relevance: Stringent school meal\nstandards that reflect the latest nutrition science may\nimprove weight status among school lunch participants,\nparticularly those eligible for free/reduced-price\nlunches.\nLunchProgram(NSLP)was\nprove students' nutritional\nintake by providing school\nmeals in accordance with standards set by\ntheUSDepartmentofAgriculture(USDA).\nSince then, the NSLP has grown to be an\nintegral component of the diet of school-\nagedchildrenthroughouttheUnitedStates.\nyear, nearly 32 million children in the\nUnited States received NSLP lunches,1 and\nthe program provides free and reduced-\npricelunchestostudentswhoqualifybased\non their household income.\nThe program has faced criticism, how-\never, after several independent studies re-\nported that NSLP lunches did not meet the\nUSDA nutrient-based standards.2-6 Some\nstudies also suggested that students' par-\nticipation in the NSLP was positively as-\nsociated with weight gain or risk of obe-\nsity.7-10 The association between NSLP\nparticipation and obesity is likely due to\nselection bias11-13 because the NSLP is in-\nherently designed to benefit low-income\nFor editorial comment\nAuthor Aff\nPolicy Cent\nHealth Rese\nTaber, Chri\nChaloupka\nof Political\nChriqui), H\nand Admin\nPublic Heal\nand Depart\n(Dr Chalou\nof Illinois a\nAuthor Affiliations: Health\nPolicy Center, Institute for\nHealth Research and Policy\n(Drs Taber, Chriqui, Powell,\nand Chaloupka), Department\nof Political Science\n(Dr Chriqui), Health Policy\nand Administration, School of\nPublic Health (Dr Powell),\nand Department of Economics\n(Dr Chaloupka), University\nof Illinois at Chicago, Chicago.\n\u00a92013 American Medical Association.

Variation\nin state laws presents an opportunity to assess whether\nupdated federal school meal standards have the poten-\ntial to reduce childhood obesity or, conversely, if there\nare unintended consequences of which schools must be\ncognizant.\nEstimating the causal effect of state laws is method-\nologically challenging because laws are not randomly as-\nsigned. As Harper et al18 illustrated in a recent study on\nstate medical marijuana laws, states with varying laws dif-\nfer with respect to unmeasured characteristics that may\nbias results if they are associated with the outcome of in-\nterest. An example would be states enacting school meal\nlaws because they have higher obesity prevalence. Clini-\ncal epidemiology studies face a similar challenge when\npatients are prescribed a treatment because they are sicker,\nmaking it appear as though treatment is associated with\npoor health.19 It can create the appearance that interven-\ntions have a negative impact unless investigators design\na study to control for such characteristics.\nThis observational study sought to assess whether state\nschool meal laws that contained provisions similar to 2012\nUSDA standards were inversely associated with student\nweightstatus.Weusedaquasi-experimentaldesigntocon-\ntrol for state characteristics that would bias a conven-\ntional cross-sectional analysis. We also explored whether\nschool meal laws were associated with increased consump-\ntion of foods and beverages in other venues (eg, school\nvending machines), as an unintended consequence. Such\n\"competitive foods\" are not currently subject to NSLP\nguidelines, tend to be unhealthy, and have been widely\navailable in schools.5,6,20 Competitive foods are not tar-\ngeted by school meal laws but may be indirectly affected\nif students compensate for school meal nutrition stan-\ndards by obtaining unhealthy foods elsewhere.21,22\nMETHODS\nCodified state statutory and administrative (ie, regulatory) laws\ngoverning school meals were compiled as part of the Bridging\nthe Gap research program.23 Laws were obtained from the West-\nlaw and LexisNexis legal research databases using primary le-\ngal research methods, including a combination of Boolean key\nword searches of the full text and reviews of the tables of con-\ntents and indices of statutory and administrative codes.24 Laws\nwere double-coded by 2 trained, master-level coders and veri-\nfied against secondary-source state law data to ensure com-\nplete collection and coding interpretation.25-29 For these vari-\nables, the interrater agreement was 99% accurate; the 1%\ndiscrepancy is for a random miss by 1 reviewer.\nFor purposes of this study, states were classified based on\nwhether laws applicable at the middle-school level for the 2006-\n2007 school year contained nutrition standards that exceeded\nUSDA standards at the time (which had not been updated since\n1995.) States that exceeded USDA standards did so by encour-\naging or requiring a specific number of fruits/vegetables; that\nat least half of all grains sold/served were whole grains; reduc-\ntions in products that contain trans fats; and/or restrictions on\nmilk to 1% or skim milk. These provisions were among the\nschool meal provisions that the USDA announced in January\n2012.17 Examples of laws are provided in the eAppendix (http:\n//www.jamapeds.com).\nStudent data were obtained from the Early Childhood Longi-\ntudinal Study, Kindergarten Class (ECLS-K).30 The ECLS-K is\na cohort study that began collecting data from a nationally rep-\nresentative sample of kindergarten students in fall 1998 and\nstudied them through 7 rounds of data collection. The law data\nwere merged to individual-level ECLS-K data based on state-\nlevel geocode identifiers obtained under special agreement. States\ncannot be listed because of data license restrictions. Analyses\nin this study used only student data collected in spring 2007,\nwhen most students were in eighth grade, because the law data\nproved by the institutional review board of the University of\nIllinois at Chicago.\nAmong the 7050 public school students who participated\ncause their principal reported that no students participated in\nlunch programs (n=40), they resided in a state with fewer than\n5 observations (n=10), or they were missing data on school\nlunch programs (n=150), height or weight (n=440), lunch par-\nincluded 4870 students in 40 states. Missing data were equally\ncommon in states with different school meal laws but more com-\nmon among boys, racial/ethnic minorities, and students who\nresided in urban areas, were of low socioeconomic status (SES),\nor were obese (P.05).\nThe primary outcomes of interest were body mass index\n(BMI) percentile and obesity status. Body mass index percen-\ntile measures each student's BMI relative to a reference popu-\nlation composed of children of the same age and sex in the United\nStates to account for developmental differences between boys\nand girls of different ages.31 Body mass index was calculated\nfrom height and weight data obtained by ECLS-K staff using a\nShorr board and digital scale, respectively (BMI was calcu-\nlated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared).\nStudents were categorized as obese if their BMI was greater than\nor equal to the age- and sex-specific 95th percentile of the 2000\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts.31\nOther ECLS-K data used in this study were obtained through\ninterviews with parents/guardians and questionnaires com-\npleted by students in class. Parents reported whether their child\nobtained lunch at school and, if so, whether they were eligible\nfor a free/reduced-price lunch. Parents also reported their edu-\ncation, occupation, and household income and their child's race/\nethnicity. Students reported several diet behaviors including\nin-school purchasing of sweets, salty snacks, and sugar-\nsweetened beverages (SSBs); fast food consumption; and over-\n\u00a92013 American Medical Association.

Each dietary variable was measured by\nasking students to report how many times they purchased/\nconsumed each food/beverage group in the past week. Several\nexamples of sweets, salty snacks, and SSBs were provided in\nthe questionnaire. Students also reported several measures of\nphysical activity including hours of television watched per day\nand days of physical activity in the past week.\nAll analyses used generalized estimating equations with an ex-\nchangeable correlation matrix and identity link to control for\nstate-level clustering. Analyses were conducted using Stata ver-\nsion 11 (StataCorp).\nGeneralized estimating equation models were designed to\nestimate the association between laws and differences in the\noutcomes of interest (eg, probability of obesity) between stu-\ndents who obtain lunch at school and those who do not, ie, the\nparameter of interest was the interaction between state law and\nstudent lunch participant status. We focused on this interac-\ntion, not the main effect of state law, for 2 reasons: (1) to as-\nsess whether stronger laws are associated with smaller dispari-\nties in weight status between school lunch participants and\nnonparticipants and (2) the interaction provides a less biased\nestimate of the effect of state laws. As discussed earlier, com-\nparing states with laws to states without laws does not provide\na valid estimate of the causal effect due to unmeasured differ-\nences between comparison groups. The interaction between laws\nand student lunch participant status, conversely, is less likely\nto be confounded by state characteristics such as obesity preva-\nlence or competitive food laws that are common to all stu-\ndents. Students who do not obtain lunch at school essentially\nserve as a secondary control group, or a proxy of what stu-\ndents who are exposed to strong laws would have experienced\nhad they not been exposed, because these 2 groups are other-\nwise exposed to many of the same state characteristics.32\nHours of television watched per day and days of physical\nactivity were included as covariates to control for the possibil-\nity of selection bias, which could occur if healthier school meal\nstandards attract students who generally engage in healthy\nweight-related behaviors. Models also controlled for race/\nethnicity, sex, school locale (suburban vs nonsuburban), and\nan SES index that included data on parental education, paren-\ntal occupation, and household income.30\nAs described earlier, a secondary objective was to assess\nwhether students compensated for stringent school meal stan-\ndards by purchasing more foods and beverages from other ven-\nues. All models were reestimated using fast food consump-\ntion, SSB consumption, and in-school purchasing of sweets, salty\nsnacks, and SSBs as outcomes.\nRESULTS\nStudents who received free/reduced-price lunches tended\nto be of lower SES, were less likely to be non-Hispanic\nwhite, and were less likely to live in suburban areas than\nstudents who purchased full-price lunches at school or\nthose who did not obtain lunch at school (Table 1). The\ndifferences between the latter 2 groups were smaller, but\nthe distribution of SES was slightly higher for students\nwho did not obtain lunch at school (eg, 37.8% were in\nthe upper SES quintile, compared with 24.9% of stu-\ndents who purchased lunch at school).

States that ex-\nceeded USDA standards had slightly higher mean obe-\nsity prevalence (age 10-17 years) and poverty rate but\nalso had higher median income and higher percentage\nof adults with a bachelor degree. The exact number of\nstates in each category cannot be reported because of data\nlicense restrictions.\nTable 2 illustrates the differences between students\nof different lunch participant status in dietary behav-\niors, obesity prevalence, and mean BMI percentile. The\nunadjusted prevalence of obesity was 11 percentage points\nhigher among students who obtained free/reduced-\nprice lunches at school compared with students who did\nnot obtain lunch at school. The prevalence remained 3.7\ntrolling for state fixed effects, race/ethnicity, sex, locale,\nand SES index. For each in-school purchasing behavior,\nthe adjusted mean was highest among students who pur-\nchased full-price lunches at school, whereas adjusted\nmeans for overall consumption of fast food and SSBs were\nhighest among students who obtained free/reduced-\nprice lunches.\nThe magnitude of differences in weight status be-\ntween students of different lunch participant status var-\nied considerably between states with different school meal\nlaws (Figure). In states that did not exceed USDA stan-\ndards, students who obtained free/reduced-price lunches\nwere almost twice as likely to be obese than students who\ntively), whereas the disparity between groups was mark-\nedly reduced in states that exceeded USDA standards\nin Table 3 likewise indicate that adjusted differences\nin weight status between school lunch participants and\nnonparticipants were smaller in states that exceeded USDA\nstandards.

Over-\nall, there was little evidence that students in states that\nexceeded USDA standards purchased more foods or bev-\nerages from other school or nonschool venues. Esti-\nmates differed slightly between students who obtained\nfree/reduced-price lunches vs those who obtained regular-\nprice lunches, because their respective parameter esti-\nmates were in opposite directions from the null for both\nsweets and salty snacks.

The results of\nthis study suggest that in states with laws that encour-\naged or required a specific number of fruits/vegetables,\nreductions in trans fats, 1% or skim milk, and/or a mini-\nmum proportion of whole grains, students who ob-\ntained school lunches had a more favorable weight sta-\ntus, particularly among participants eligible for a free/\nreduced-price lunch.

None of the state laws\nused in this study were identical to 2012 USDA stan-\ndards,buteachincludedprovisionsthatarecurrentlybeing\nimplemented in schools nationwide. The evidence in this\nstudy suggests that ongoing changes to school meal stan-\ndards have the potential to reduce obesity, particularly\namong students who are eligible for free/reduced-price\nlunches,thoughadditionallongitudinalresearchisneeded\nto confirm this. Longitudinal studies could also exam-\nine whether any effects of school meal reforms change\nover time as new standards are integrated.\nThis study also examined the possibility that students\ncompensated for school meal laws by purchasing or con-\nsumingmorefoodsandbeveragesfromothervenues.Policy\nresistanceisacommonphenomenonthatoccurswhenpoli-\ncies trigger behavioral or environmental changes that ne-\ngate the policy.35 Overall, there was little evidence of com-\npensation, but even modest positive associations between\nlaws and in-school purchasing among students who pur-\nchased a full-price lunch may explain why the associa-\ntion between state laws and weight status was weaker in\nthis population. Such feedback mechanisms would be con-\nsistent with previous school nutrition policy evaluation\nstudies.36 Purchasing and consumption are also vulner-\nable to measurement error,37 and questions did not in-\nclude information on volume that was purchased. Future\nstudies could use more precise instruments (eg, 24-hour\nrecall) to assess whether stringent school meal standards\nare associated with increases in intake from other sources\nor lower participation in school lunch programs. Early me-\ndia reports suggested that some students protested new\nUSDA standards,38 but to our knowledge, this topic has\nnot been studied rigorously.\nIdentifying compensatory mechanisms is particu-\nlarly important because of the widespread availability of\ncompetitive foods in schools.5,6,20 Unless school meal\nlaws are accompanied by nutrition education and initia-\ntives to limit energy-dense competitive foods and bev-\nerages, then even the most stringent school meal stan-\ndards may be undermined by competitive foods.\nStudying the comprehensive effect of school meal and\ncompetitive food laws is an important topic for future\nresearch. This study was unable to analyze school meal\nand competitive food laws in conjunction because of\nthe small number of states that exceeded USDA stan-\ndards, but there will be future opportunities to do so as\npolicymakers continue to target both domains. States\nand districts have strengthened competitive food and\nHunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 requires the develop-\nment and implementation of nationwide nutrition stan-\ndards for competitive foods in schools that participate\nin federal meal programs.40 Studying the comprehen-\nsive effect of policies across domains will require exam-\nining how different intervention targets interact with\neach other and with the broader environment.41\nResults of this study should be interpreted cautiously\nbecause of several limitations. Foremost, the cross-\nsectional design makes it impossible to conclude whether\ndifferences in weight status were caused by school meal\nlaws. The study design cannot account for state-level vari-\nables that affect students who obtain free/reduced-price\nlunches differently than students who do not obtain school\nlunches (eg, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Pro-\ngram42). The small number of states in the intervention\ngroup further increases the risk of state-level confound-\ning. The quantity of missing data may have biased re-\nsults, as missing data were associated with several demo-\ngraphic characteristics and weight status. The lack of data\non school meal content makes it further difficult to ascer-\ntain whether any differences in weight status were attrib-\nutable to state laws, and implementation of state laws may\nhave varied within the state because of district policies or\nvarying degrees of adherence. Timing of implementation\nmay have varied, too, as we do not have comparable data\nUSDA standards included some, but not all, of the 2012\nupdates to USDA standards, and specific standards, eg, re-\nduced trans fats or 1% or skim milk, varied from state to\nstate, making it impossible to analyze whether one stan-\ndard had more of an impact than another.\nThe evidence supporting stringent school meal stan-\ndards is far from conclusive, but this study provides\npromising signs of the potential for the USDA updated\nstandards to improve student weight status. Previous\nstandards had not been updated since 1995 and did not\ninclude specific provisions that were consistent with\nthe latest nutrition science. State laws that require\nschools to provide meals that are consistent with the\nDietary Guidelines for Americans would complement\nthe updated USDA school meal standards and enhance\nthe potential of federal and state initiatives to reduce\nobesity.\nCorrespondence: Daniel R.
