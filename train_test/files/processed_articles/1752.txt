One simple approach\nto multivariate analysis is to reduce the number of traits analyzed\nthrough factor analysis. This popular method of summarizing multi-\nvariate data is essentially an extension of multivariate multiple\nregression that permits the specification of latent variables to assess\nthe effects of variables that are thought to exist, but which have not\nbeen measured. Typically, some or all of the observed variables are\nspecified to regress onto one or more latent factors. These factors\ntherefore summarize the covariance between the observed variables.\nNon-shared variance and measurement error are subsumed into an\nadditional set of latent variables (residuals), which are specific to each\nof the observed variables.\nHowever, factor scores \u00ad or any other weighted combination of the\ntraits \u00ad combine both factor-level and trait-specific effects, and\nwhereas genetic association with a latent factor is inherently pleio-\ntropic, association with a residual variance component is not. Should\nthese two types of effect counteract then false negatives (type II errors)\nmay occur. Lange et al1 have implemented a multivariate association\nanalysis based on a principal component analysis within the FBAT-PC\nsoftware. Similarly, the Lange et al2 FBAT-GEE approach allows testing\nfor association to multiple phenotypes using an omnibus approach,\nwhich results in a multivariate test with degrees of freedom equal to\nthe number of phenotypes being tested. However, both FBAT-PC and\nFBAT-GEE require family-based data. In addition, these approaches\ndo not distinguish between factor-level and trait-level association. In\nthis study, we present a maximum likelihood approach, which\ncombines both latent and variable-specific tests and which may be\nused with either individual or family data.\nWithin the combined maximum likelihood-based approach, we model the full\nmultivariate covariance structure by maximizing the natural log of the normal\ntheory likelihood of the data:\nL \u00bc P\nN\nj\ni\n\u00f0yi\u00c0mi\n\u00de\n\u00bd \nwith respect to\nP\ni and mi, where k is the number of data observations for\nfamily i (in the univariate case ki is equal to the number of family members for\nwhom data are collected; in the case of a sample of unrelated individuals, k is\nequal to the number of variables with observed data for that individual; and in\ngeneral ki\n\u00bc\nP\nni\nmiq\nwhere miq is the number of variables observed on\n1Genetic Epidemiology, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia; 2Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, Virginia\nCommonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA; 3Department of Psychiatry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA; 4Department of Human Genetics, Virginia\nCommonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA; 5Department of Psychology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA; 6Department of Biological Psychology, Free\nUniversity, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n*Correspondence: Dr SE Medland, Genetic Epidemiology, Queensland Institute of Medical Reseach, PO Royal Brisbane Hospital, 300 Herston Rd, Herston, Brisbane,\nwww.nature.com/ejhg\nindividual q in family i and ni is the number of individuals in family (i);\nP\ni is\nthe expected covariance matrix among the variables for family i, yi is a vector\nof observed scores obtained for the k variables for family i, mi is the\nvector of expected means for family i and N is the number families. The\ncovariance matrix\nP\ni may be user-specified to allow for alternative models;\nif the data were collected from a family-based sample, then the variance may\nbe decomposed into genetic and environmental components, and simul-\ntaneous tests for linkage, heritability or other variance components could be\nincorporated.\nAgainst this multivariate background, we estimate the following three mean\neffects models:\n The first specifies an association with the latent trait: yj1\n\u00bc\nm+F  bal\ngj\n, where m is the grand mean, F is a full matrix v by 1\ncontaining the estimated factor loadings, bal is a 1 by 1 matrix\ncontaining the estimated allelic effect and gj represents the geno-\ntype of individual j, coded as the number of reference alleles at the\nlocus minus 1.\n The second, alternate, model of the mean effects allows for\nvariable-specific association at the level of the individual trait:\n\u00bc m+gj\n bar\n, where bar is a v by 1 matrix containing the\nestimated allelic effects for each of the k phenotypes.\n The null model yj0\n\u00bcm, in which no association effects are\nestimated.\nThe minus twice log-likelihoods of the two alternate models are compared with\nthe null model using likelihood ratio w2-test with degrees of freedom equal\nto the number of parameters being tested; one in the case of the factor-level\n1) and v for the variable-specific test (wn\n2). As the two tests provide\ncomplementary information, it is suggested that the results of both tests should\nbe reported. As discussed below, conducting both factor-level and variable-\nspecific tests results in an inflated type I error rate, which may be corrected by\napplying a Bonferroni correction to the factor-level and variable-specific tests.\nAdjusted P-values may be obtained by multiplying the observed P-values, by the\nBonferroni correction factor.\nIn the case of family data, allelic effects may be partitioned into between (bb)\nand within (bw) family effects at either the latent or variable-specific level\n(eg bbal and bbar).3 For a test of association robust to population stratification,\nthe within-family test may be used, in which case these three models may be\nparameterized as follows, for the jth sib from the ith family:\n\u00bc m+F  bbal\nAbi\n+F  bwal\nAwij\n\u00bc m+bbar\nAbi\n+bwar\nAwij\n\u00bc m+bbar\nAbi\nwhere Abi is the derived coefficient for the between-families additive genetic\neffect for the ith family, and Awij is the coefficient for the within-families\nadditive genetic effect for the jth sib from the ith family, as summarized in\nTable 1. Alternatively, in the absence of population stratification, a between-\nfamilies test in which the bw parameters are constrained to equal the bb\nparameters may be used, in which case:\n\u00bc m\nSimulations studies\nTo examine the type I error and power of the combined multivariate\n(CMV) approach, data were simulated in R under nine scenarios. In each\nscenario, covariation between variables was due to a single factor, which\nloaded on all variables. Algebraically, this covariation may be written as\nF*F\u00a2, where F is a full matrix v by 1, where v is the number of variables.\nUncorrelated residuals were added as D*D\u00a2, where D is a v by v diagonal\nmatrix. The factor loadings and residuals for each scenario are summarized in\nTable 2. Data from unrelated individuals (N\u00bc1000) were simulated for six (a\u00adf)\nscenarios; in the remaining three (g\u00adi), data for full sib-pairs (Npairs\nwere simulated.\nData for each of the nine scenarios were simulated under six association\nmodels: (1) Null effect (to assess type I error); (2) single-variable association;\n(3) factor-level association; (4) residual-level association in which all variables\nare equally associated; (5) a mixed effects model and (6) a contrasting effects\nmodel. A total of 5000 replicates were simulated for each association model\nusing a single SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) with a 0.2 minor allele\nfrequency throughout.\nTo compare the power of the CMV approach to univariate analyses of factor\nscores or sum scores (SSs), we computed the following: a SS; a `regression' (aka\nThompson) factor score,4 in which the sum of squared discrepancies between\ntrue and estimated factors over individuals is minimized and a `Bartlett' factor\nscore (BFS),5,6 in which the sum of squares of the unique factors over the range\nof items is minimized. Using the raw multivariate data for each replicate, we\nran the CMV association test and univariate association tests of (i) the SS, (ii)\nthe Bartlett and (iii) the regression factor scores (RFS). For the sibling data\nfrom scenarios g\u00adi, a between-families test of association was used.\nTo examine the effect of missing phenotypic data on the power of the CMV\napproach, two additional conditions were investigated using data simulated\nunder the parameters from scenario i. In the first simulation, 10% of the data\nfor each variable were set to missing. Missing status was randomly assigned\nacross individuals and variables. In the second simulation, the third variable\nwas randomly set to missing for half of the participants to mimic a situation in\nwhich not all participants were assessed on all variables. Each of these missing\ndata scenarios was simulated for unrelated individuals under the single-variable\nand factor-level association models (described in association models 2 and 3 in\nTable 2). A total of 5000 replicates were simulated for each case using a single\nSNP with a 0.2 minor allele frequency. Although the effects of missingness are\nnot exhaustively explored, it is expected that the results of these simulations will\ngeneralize to other situations in which data is missing at random (and missing\ncompletely at random), including the case of sib-pairs in which missingness\nmay be correlated.\nAll analyses were conducted using Mx,7 a freeware structural equation\nmodeling program. The scripts used in these analyses are available from\n(www.vipbg.vcu.edu/~sarahme/WriteMx) and may be modified to explore\nother conditions.\nApplied example\nTo illustrate the explanatory strengths of the CMV approach, we applied it to\ndata from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health;\nhttp://www.cpc.unc.edu/Add Health). This nationally representative longitudi-\nnal study is designed to assess the causes and consequences of health-related\nbehaviors of adolescents initially recruited in grades 7 through 12 as they\ntransition into adulthood.\ncollected, which were used to genotype polymorphisms in the dopamine\nOMIM *126450; for details of the sample processing and genotyping see\nTable 1 Example scoring of Abi and Awij in a sibling pair (following\nFulker et al3)\nGenotype Genotypic effect Abi Awij\nPhenomic approach to multivariate allelic association\nSE Medland and MC Neale\nEuropean Journal of Human Genetics\nHaberstick and Smolen8). The DRD2 Taq1A1 (T) allele has been associated\nwith a range of substance use phenotypes including alcoholism,9,10 nicotine use\nand cessation.11\u00ad13 In addition, the degree of pleasure gained from the effects of\npsychostimulants has been found to correlate with the density of dopamine D2\nreceptors in the striatum,14 which is in turn associated with DRD2 Taq1A1.15 In\nthis study, we consider association between the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism\nand initiation (ever-use) of three substances: marijuana, tranquilizers and\nstimulants, using data from 864 Caucasian males.\nThe characteristics of the sample are summarized in Table 3. The phenotypic\ndata were analyzed employing a multifactorial threshold model, which specifies\nthat ordinal data represent subdivisions on an underlying normal distribution\nRESULTS\nType I error\nAs shown in Table 4, across scenarios the factor-level and variable-\nspecific tests showed the expected type I error rates for when\nconsidered individually. The distributions of the P-values for the\nfactor-level and variable-specific tests were uniform (see Supplemen-\ntary Figures 1\u00ad4). The CMV approach resulted in an inflated type I\nerror, mean a\u00bc0.084. To control for this inflation in type I error rates,\nwe adopted an a level of 0.025 for each of the factor-level and variable-\nspecific tests, which resulted in a slightly conservative test, mean\na\u00bc0.043. This reduced a level was used in all further analyses. The\nconservative nature of the CMV approach is due to the covariation\nbetween the factor-level and variable-specific tests. However, as the\nmagnitude of this covariation is dependent on the factor structure of\nthe observed data, researchers may either estimate an exact Bonferroni\ncorrection for their data through permutation or simulation, or adopt\nthe slightly conservative a level of 0.025.\nPower\nFigures 1a\u00adc summarize the results of the power analyses for the five\nassociation models under the nine multivariate scenarios. In each case,\npower is shown for the CMV approach and for univariate analyses of\nthe SS (SS), RFS and BFS.\nTable 2 Multivariate background and association scenarios used in the type I error and power analysis simulations\nMultivariate background\n3-variable simulations 5-variable simulations\nScenario\nHigh loadings\n(a) Unrelated individuals;\n(g) sibling pairs\nMixed loadings\n(b) Unrelated individuals;\n(h) sibling pairs\nLow loadings\n(c) Unrelated individuals;\n(i) sibling pairs\nHigh loadings\n(d) Unrelated individuals\nMixed loadings\n(e) Unrelated individuals\nLow loadings\n(f) Unrelated individuals\nAllelic effectsa\naNote: Given a minor allele frequency of 0.2 allelic effects of 0.13 and 0.18 account for 0.5% and 1% of the variance, respectively.\nTable 3 Characteristics of the Add Health Sample\nHardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium test w1\nPolychoric correlations Stimulants Tranquilizers Marijuana\nStimulants 1\nMultivariate analysis Factor loadings Residual loadings\nPrevalence of initiation by genotype\nDrug Full sample TT TC CC\nPhenomic approach to multivariate allelic association\nSE Medland and MC Neale\nEuropean Journal of Human Genetics\nThe situations in which the association affected all variables, either\nat the factor level (association model 3) or to an equal extent across all\nvariables (association model 4), all the four association tests per-\nformed well. In these scenarios, the slightly conservative nature of the\na correction for the combined tests is evident as a slight loss of power,\nwhich is most obvious when the factor loadings are high. However, the\npower of the sum and factor score analyses decreases sharply as the\npattern of association effects diverges from that of the factor loadings\n(association model 2, 5 and 6). This effect is seen most clearly in\ncontrasting effects simulations (association model 6), in which the\ndirection of association differs between variables. For the univariate\nanalyses of the sum and factor scores, the power to detect this type of\nallelic effect is very low and often does not differ from chance. This is\nconsistent with previous work that has shown that multivariate\nlinkage analyses are most powerful when the covariation induced by\na QTL differs in direction from the background correlation.17\nAs might be expected, of the three univariate analyses, the SS was\nthe least powerful across situations, whereas the BFS outperformed the\nRFS. Conversely, across the range of situations considered here, the\nCMV approach is robust and generally has equal or greater statistical\npower than the univariate analyses of summary measures. As shown in\nTable 5, an overall missingness rate of 30% resulted in an approximate\nHowever, when the `true' association effect was at the level of the\nfactor, a substantial missingness (50% of variable 3) had only a minor\nimpact on the power to detect association, resulting in a reduction in\nApplied example\nTo show the CMV approach, we analyzed association between the\nDRD2 TaqIA polymorphism and initiation (ever-use) of three sub-\nstances \u00ad marijuana, tranquilizers and stimulants \u00ad using data from\n864 Caucasian males. Marijuana, tranquilizer and stimulant initiation\nwere moderately correlated and all three loaded strongly on a common\nfactor (Table 3). There was no evidence of factor-level association\n\u00bc0.06). However, a significant association was obser-\nved at the variable-specific level (w3\nbStimulants\nsuggest that the T-allele increases the risk of stimulant use, but\ndecreases the risk of tranquilizer and marijuana use, which is con-\nsistent with the patterns of prevalence by genotype shown in Table 3.\nInterestingly, in these data the differences in the direction of the allelic\neffects at the variable-specific level cancel each other out at the factor\nlevel. To determine whether these results would have been evident\nfrom univariate analyses, we conducted post-hoc analyses of each\nvariable. The association between stimulant use and DRD2 was\nnominally significant (at the 0.05 level) before correcting for multiple\ntesting (w1\ndence for association with either tranquilizer (w1\nmarijuana use (w1\nassociation for the different drugs would remain significant following\nBonferroni correction. The increase in power associated with the\nmultivariate analysis within an association framework is analogous\nThese results may seem counterintuitive given the published\nreports9,12,19 that the DRD2 A1 (T) allele is a risk allele for a range\nof different substance use phenotypes and that the majority of\ncovariation in substance use phenotypes can be explained by common\netiological factors. However, the effects of stimulants (including\nelevated activity, mood and euphoria) are markedly different from\nthose of tranquilizer and marijuana use (which typically include\nrelaxation, lethargy, mild euphoria and anxiety-reduction). To the\nextent that individuals with higher D2 receptor density, which is\nassociated with DRD2 Taq1A1 (T-allele),15 are more likely to report\nthe effects of a psychostimulant drug (methylphenidate which, like\ncocaine, blocks the dopamine transporters) as unpleasant,14 it is\npossible that individuals with T-alleles may be more likely to try\ndrugs that are perceived to increase exhilaration and animation than\nthose that are thought to have the opposite effect. Although this\nassociation has yet to be replicated, the finding illustrates the increased\nexplanatory power of the CMV approach.\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough univariate analysis of a factor score can detect an association\nat the factor level and univariate analyses of each phenotype in turn\nmay detect allelic effects, the need to correct for multiple testing is\ndisadvantageous. Furthermore, such a procedure does not exploit the\ngain in power derived from multivariate analysis. The suitability of the\ncurrent approach to some extent depends on the phenotypes under\nanalysis. The performance exceeds that of alternatives when the\nphenotypic covariance arising from other genetic and environmental\ninfluences differs from that generated by the QTL.17 We expect that\nthe multivariate approach will prove useful in the analysis of complex\ntraits that involve behavioral, psychological or other factors that are\ninherently difficult to measure. It should be especially valuable when\nanalyzing data that contain missing values, perhaps due to a structured\ndata collection format, or when a subsample has been chosen for more\ndetailed or expensive assessments. Extension of the method to factor\nmixture models would provide a natural framework for the analysis of\ntraits such as migraine and ADHD, in which symptom patterns\nsuggest the presence of subtypes. The framework is directly suitable\nfor repeated measures of either one trait or many, and can be used in\nsituations in which there is measurement non-invariance.20,21\nTo facilitate application of the CMV approach, we have developed a\nperl script, which can be downloaded from (www.vipbg.vcu.edu/\n~sarahme/WriteMx). This script can be used with either family or\nindividual data. It reads standard Merlin .ped and .dat files, and writes\na data file and customized scripts for running the analysis in Mx\nTable 4 Type I errors for the nine simulation scenarios\nUnrelated individuals \u00ad 3 variables\nUnrelated individuals \u00ad 5 variables\nSibling pairs \u00ad 3 variables\nCMV, combined multivariate approach; FL, factor-level test; VS, variable-specific test.\nFor the combined multivariate approach, the type I error is defined as probability of observing a\nsignificant association, for either the FL or VS test at the given alpha level.\nPhenomic approach to multivariate allelic association\nSE Medland and MC Neale\nEuropean Journal of Human Genetics\nSingle variable\nScenario d - Unrelated lndividuals - 5 Variables - High Factor Loadings\nScenario a - Unrelated lndividuals - 3 Variables - High Factor Loadings\nScenario b - Unrelated lndividuals - 3 Variables - Mixed Factor Loadings\nScenario e - Unrelated lndividuals - 5 Variables - Mixed Factor Loadings\nScenario c - Unrelated lndividuals - 3 Variables - Low Factor Loadings\nPower\nFactor Level\nPower\nResidual Level\nPower\nMixed pattern\nPower\nContrasting pattern\nPower\nSingle variable\nPower\nFactor Level\nPower\nResidual Level\nPower\nMixed pattern\nPower\nContrasting pattern\nPower\nSingle variable\nPower\nFactor Level\nPower\nResidual Level\nPower\nMixed pattern\nPower\nContrasting pattern\nPower\nSingle variable\nPower\nFactor Level\nPower\nResidual Level\nPower\nMixed pattern\nPower\nContrasting pattern\nPower\nSingle variable\nPower\nFactor Level\nPower\nResidual Level\nPower\nMixed pattern\nPower\nContrasting pattern\nPower\nScenario f - Unrelated lndividuals - 5 Variables - Low Factor Loadings\nSingle variable\nPower\nFactor Level\nPower\nResidual Level\nPower\nMixed pattern\nPower\nContrasting pattern\nPower\nFigure 1 (a) Power to detect association (defined as the proportion of tests significant at an a of 0.05) under multivariate backgrounds a, b and c, for\nassociation models 2\u00ad6 (described in Table 2).

Mx allows full user specification; as such\nthe approach described here can easily be extended to allow for\nanalysis of multiple factors, and scripts showing this extension can\nbe downloaded from (www.vipbg.vcu.edu/~sarahme/WriteMx). In\naddition, the method can be extended to accommodate data from\ndifferent types of relatives (parents, grandparents etc).\nThe current implementation within Mx has some limitations. It is\nnot presently possible to impute missing genotypes within the CMV\napproach, and at present individuals with missing genotypes will be\nexcluded from the analysis. However, pre-imputed genotypes can\neasily be analyzed within Mx, and information regarding the precision\nof imputation can be incorporated through the use of mixture\nmodeling. In addition, Mx can analyze either continuous or ordinal\n(binary and/or polychotomous) data. However, there is no straight-\nforward general approach to the joint analysis of binary and contin-\nuous variables in the current version of Mx, although it is practical to\ndo this when the number of patterns of missing continuous variables\nis small. An R-language Open Source version of the software, currently\nunder development, will implement this functionality directly. In\nthe meantime, one solution to this problem is to transform conti-\nnuous variables to ordinal, using deciles and conduct a multivariate\nordinal analysis.\nTo summarize, this article has three main contributions. First, it\nintroduces an integrated model for allelic association, which permits\ntesting for association to either a common factor or to a set of\nvariable-specific components. The approach improves the explanatory\npower of analysis, analogous to that derived from using pathway-\nbased association approaches to complement traditional single SNP\nanalysis.22 Second, it presents freely available software that facilitates\nthe use of the combined association approach by producing scripts\nand data for Mx analysis from Merlin format ped and dat files. Third,\nit illustrates the approach using substance use data from the Add\nHealth study. We encourage researchers to look beyond diagnosis or\nSS analyses when working with complex traits in the hope that doing\nso will lead to the identification of novel susceptibility genes and a\ndeeper understanding of the ways in which identified variants influ-\nence behavior and complex traits.\n"
