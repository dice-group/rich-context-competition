After the use of chemical weapons in a suburb of Damascus\nhad been attributed to the Syrian government, the United Kingdom, France and the United\nStates showed resolve to respond with punitive military strikes against Bashar-al-Assad's\nregime. In line with an emerging convention (Mello, 2017; Strong, 2015), the Cameron\ngovernment asked parliament to approve a strong response, including possible military\naction. To Cameron's surprise, the House of Commons voted against the government\nDepartment of Political Science and Public Administration, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The\nNetherlands\nCorresponding author:\nWolfgang Wagner, Department of Political Science and Public Administration, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,\nEmail: w.m.wagner@vu.nl\nSpecial Issue Article\n122 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(1)\nmotion (Kaarbo and Kenealy, 2016). After the British government had declared that it\nwould refrain from any military strike, the French and American governments followed\nsuit. It is no exaggeration to conclude that the House of Commons is responsible for the\nnon-use of force against the Syrian government in 2013.\nThe 2013 House of Commons vote seems a perfect illustration of the effects of parlia-\nmentary involvement on the substance of security policy. What is more, the episode seems\na textbook example of the institutionalist version of the democratic peace theory, according\nto which domestic actors, such as parliaments, constrain the executive in its use of force.\nHowever, much of this literature has taken its cues from the US system of checks and bal-\nances where Congress is more independent of the executive and legislative\u00adexecutive rela-\ntions are frequently antagonistic, especially if the president's party differs from the majority\nin Congress. In parliamentary systems, by contrast, the majority party or coalition of parties\nforms a functional unit with the government and open confrontation between parliament\nand government is a rare exception. In parliamentary systems, the executive typically either\ndisciplines the parliamentary majority to support its policies or avoids a vote in anticipation\nof an absent majority (on the executive rationale behind parliamentary votes, see Strong in\nthis Special Issue). From this perspective, the 2013 House of Commons episode is untypical\nbecause it first and foremost indicates that the government misjudged the degree of dissent\nwithin the governing majority (Kaarbo and Kenealy, 2016).1\nIn parliamentary systems, open confrontation between parliament and government is\nexceptional, therefore parliamentary influence on deployment decisions should not be\nequated with the former voting against proposals of the latter. Instead, the power of parlia-\nments should manifest itself in the pattern of liberal democracies' participation in military\ninterventions. As government decides in the shadow of parliament's war powers, and\nbecause war powers differ across democracies, we should see countries with weak parlia-\nments use military force more often than those where prior parliamentary approval is\nrequired. Participation patterns are a better way to study the effect of parliamentary involve-\nment on security policy than the actual exercise of legislative veto powers. By studying pat-\nterns of participation across 25\u00ad35 countries in five military missions, this article contributes\nto a systematic understanding of the effect of parliamentary involvement on security policy\nand thus to the second guiding question for this Special Issue (Mello and Peters).\nThis article finds modest evidence for such a parliamentary peace and suggests that it\ndepends on the character of the military mission in question. If a mission is framed as a\ntest case of alliance solidarity, as was the case with Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)\nand the Iraq War, domestic institutional constraints can be trumped by alliance politics. If,\nhowever, countries enjoy more discretion in deciding on the use of force, domestic con-\nstraints such as parliamentary war powers have a tangible impact on government policy.\nThe next section discusses the state of the art on the `parliamentary peace' (Dieterich\net al., 2015). It outlines the causal mechanisms that specify why parliamentary control is\nexpected to make the use of force less likely and reviews the empirical evidence thus far.\nI then present the research design of this study and discuss the empirical findings. My\nanalysis of liberal democracies' (non-)participation in military interventions in 1999\ncountries with a parliamentary ex ante veto power are indeed less likely to contribute to a\nmilitary mission than countries without one. However, a closer examination of individual\nmissions demonstrates that such a pattern is only statistically significant for two of them:\nOperation Allied Force (Kosovo) and Operation Unified Protector (Libya). In contrast,\ncountries with a parliamentary ex ante veto power were just as likely to join OEF, the Iraq\nWar and the air campaign against Daesh as countries without.\nState of the art\nParliamentary peace: rationale and causal mechanisms\nThe idea that parliaments constrain governmental decisions on using force has a long\npedigree. In the summer of 1914, British MPs founded the `Union of Democratic Control'\nout of frustration over the government's secret de facto commitment to come to the\ndefence of France. This commitment contradicted the official British policy to avoid an\nentanglement in a war on the continent. The founders of the Union, among whom were\nRamsay MacDonald and Norman Angell, asked that `no treaty, arrangement or undertak-\ning shall be entered upon in the name of Great Britain without the sanction of parliament'\nyears later, the same spirit was midwife to the War Powers Resolution\n(WPR) in the United States. The WPR obliges the President to consult with members of\nCongress before introducing US armed forces into hostilities. Moreover, the use of force\nmust be stopped after 60days unless Congress decides to extend the deployment, effec-\ntively providing Congress with an ex post veto power. The resolution had met the stern\nopposition of President Nixon who used his veto to block it. However, both houses over-\nrode the veto with the two-third majorities required. The WPR was brought forward in a\nclimate of `deep distrust of the Presidency' (Franck and Weisband, 1979: 35) among\nmembers of Congress and the public more broadly. To a large extent, this mistrust was fed\nby the President's conduct of the war in Vietnam.\nSeveral mechanisms have been identified that link institutional constraints (and parlia-\nmentary control in particular) to a less bellicose policy.2 A first causal mechanism echoes\nveto player theory, according to which any veto player makes any decision less likely for\nthe simple reason that an additional actor needs to agree.3 However, as pointed out above,\nthe implicit assumption that parliament has preferences independent of the executive con-\ntradicts the logic of parliamentary systems, according to which the government and the\nparliamentary majority form a functional unit.4 This logic makes the embarrassment of a\nveto, such as the 2013 House of Commons veto on Syria, highly unlikely. However, even\nthough the juxtaposition between the government and its majority in parliament, on the\none hand, and the opposition, on the other, often trumps legislative\u00adexecutive relations in\na parliamentary system, they do not do so always and entirely. First, backbenchers within\nthe governmental majority parties may be difficult to discipline, especially on questions\nof using military force, which is often considered a moral issue. Second, governments\noften aim at a broad consensus in support of their policies that includes at least the major\nopposition party/parties. This consensus is often the case with military interventions,\nwhich are seen and presented as transcending party politics. In both cases, a parliamen-\ntary veto power encourages the government to reach out, address concerns and ultimately\ncompromise to secure broad support.\nAs a second causal mechanism, checks and balances slow down the decision-making\nprocess. Bruce Russett emphasised that this slowdown can buy time for a diplomatic\nsolution (Russett, 1993: 40). With a view to the House of Commons' vote on Syria in\n2013, one could add that the requirement to consult parliament can also cool down belli-\ncose emotions: Prime Minister Cameron responded to the use of chemical weapons in a\nsuburb of Damascus with calls for punitive air strikes against the alleged perpetrator, the\nSyrian government. The British press supported such punitive action.5 Although there are\nseveral reasons for the government's defeat in the House of Commons (Kaarbo and\nKenealy, 2016), the parliamentary debate provided the space for doubts to be voiced and\nforced the government to address them.\n124 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(1)\nThird, institutional constraints influence the type of conflicts that leaders pick and the\nway that they are fought. Siverson (1995) has argued that the mere count of war participa-\ntions does not tell the full story because it does not distinguish between Germany in World\nWar II (with 1.8million battle deaths), on the one the hand, and the United States in the\ncounting war participations, Siverson (1995) suggests examining the lethality of conflicts,\nunderstood as the logged number of casualties per 10,000 people. Comparing democracies\nwith non-democracies, he indeed finds support for the hypothesis that wars initiated by\ndemocracies are significantly less lethal than those initiated by non-democracies. Students\nof `democratic victories', that is, the finding that democracies tend to win the wars they\nfight, draw on the same causal mechanism Reiter and Stam (2002), for example, argued\nthat democracies tend to win the wars they fight because democratic constraints make\nleaders pick only conflicts they are confident of winning.\nOf course, the same rationale that distinguishes democracies from non-democra-\ncies also applies to differences among democracies with different levels of institu-\ntional constraints. Indeed, Saideman and Auerswald (2012) argue that institutional\nconstraints tend to make governments impose caveats, that is, restrictions on how\ntheir troops can be used in a military mission. With a view to Germany's contribution\nto Afghanistan, they argue that `the necessity of maintaining parliamentary support\nseems to explain why casualty aversion is THE top priority for German officers in\nAfghanistan, guiding decisions on helicopters, operations, and the like' (Saideman\nThe discussion above shows that parliamentary control of military missions does not\nmake participation in military missions impossible. Especially if there is broad support\nfor the use of force in parliament and among the public, parliament is unlikely to veto the\nuse of force. More typically, however, public support is modest and decision-makers are\naware that an initial wave of support (the `rally around the flag effect') can melt away the\nlonger the mission takes and the higher the number of casualties (Mueller, 1973). We\ntherefore expect that countries with a parliamentary veto power are, ceteris paribus, less\nlikely to participate in a military intervention.\nData and findings\nAlthough this question has attracted growing interest in the wake of the democratic peace\ndebate, our knowledge about the actual effects of parliamentary war powers on govern-\nments' decisions to use military force is remarkably limited.\nprocesses on the use of force between democracies with autonomous executives, on the\none hand, and executives facing strong legislatures, on the other. While all three find sup-\nport for the general notion that institutional constraints by parliaments matter, they also\nhesitate to claim a general relation between strong parliament and conflict avoidance\nbecause parliament is not always less hawkish than the executive. Among the three\nauthors, Auerswald comes closest to a general proposition that different institutional sys-\ntems impact on the likelihood of conflict initiation by the executive. Even if a legislature\nis initially in favor of conflict, Auerswald argues, institutionally constrained executives\nwill be reluctant to engage in conflict because they are aware of the inherent risks of such\nan endeavour. However, strong executives run a lower risk of domestic defeat and are\ndepth case studies, a second group of scholars run statistical analyses to examine the\nhypothesis that the likelihood of a state initiating conflict decreases as legislative control\nover foreign policy increases. Reiter and Tillman (2002) examine conflict initiation by 37\ndemocracies over the period 1919\u00ad1992 with country-years as units of analysis. As a\nproxy for legislative control, Reiter and Tillman (2002) use treaty ratification power.\nTheir findings are mixed. Although there is a statistically significant correlation between\nlegislative power over treaty ratification and the initiation of so-called Militarized\nInterstate Disputes, the variable becomes insignificant if only conflicts involving the use\nof force are included. Clark and Nordstrom (2005) have confirmed these findings.Aweak\nspot in Reiter and Tillman's (2002: 816) study is their assumption that `legislative involve-\nment in treaty ratification is likely to extend to other areas of foreign policy'. Because\nbetter data on parliament's war powers were missing, this assumption was the only way\nto study a relatively large number of democracies over a relatively long period of time.\nThe dearth of data on actual war powers was overcome in the late 2000s. Dieterich\net al. (2010, 2015) collected data on the actual competences and practice of parliaments\nof 25 members of the European Union at the time of the 2003 Iraq War. They find strong\nevidence for a `parliamentary peace [...] [H]igh parliamentary war powers are associated\nwith reduced war involvement. Countries with a high degree of parliamentary war powers\nwere significantly less militarily engaged in the Iraq War' (Dieterich et al., 2015: 100).\nWagner et al. (2010) collected data on parliamentary war powers in 49 democracies\nbetween 1989 and 2004, including countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas and\nOceania. They find that parliamentary veto power over military deployments is relatively\nwidespread, albeit still restricted to a minority of democracies.\nAfghanistan 2001) and countries (e.g. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United\nStates). Mello uses fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis as a method to identify\nconfigurations of variables that impact on a government's decision to participate in a mili-\ntary intervention. Using data from Dieterich et al. (2010) and Wagner et al. (2010), Mello\n(2014: 186) finds `no cross-case pattern [...] for parliamentary veto rights'. For the\nKosovo intervention, Mello finds that the absence of parliamentary veto power is a neces-\nsary condition for participation. However, for the Iraq War, Mello finds that constitutional\nrestraints explain the non-participation of numerous states better than parliamentary veto\npower. In addition, several parliaments that could have vetoed participation did not do so.\nHaesebrouck (2016a, 2016b) has used a very similar research design to examine the con-\ntributions of liberal democracies to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon\n(UNIFIL) and to the air strikes against Daesh. As regards to UNIFIL, he finds that `the\npresence of parliamentary veto [...] is associated with the absence of large contributions'\n(Haesebrouck, 2016b: 152). With a view to the air strikes against Daesh, he finds that a\nlegislative veto `is a relevant condition, irrespective of partisan politics' (Haesebrouck,\n2016a: 15). However, the `prospect of legislative meddling did not inhibit participation if\nthe combination of a strong threat and high alliance value provided states a strong incen-\nTesting the parliamentary peace thesis\nThis section tests the parliamentary peace thesis empirically. I selected five cases of mili-\ntary missions on the basis of criteria that have been established by major works in the\n126 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(1)\nOnly military missions after the end of the Cold War are included, to which several liberal\ndemocracies made a sizable military contribution (excluding unilateral and minilateral\ninterventions as well as many UN-led peace operations). In addition, decisions to partici-\npate must have been politically controversial (excluding many small and low-risk opera-\ntions), and there must have been variance in liberal democracies' involvement. Based on\nthese criteria, the following missions are included in this study: (1) Operation Allied\nForce against targets in Serbia and Montenegro in 1999 to force Milosevic to stop vio-\nlence against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo (therefore, usually referred to as `Kosovo\nWar'), (2) OEF in Afghanistan in 2001 to fight Al Quaida in response to the 9/11 terrorist\nmassive violence by Gaddafi's government against civilians was feared and (5) the cam-\npaign against Daesh in Iraq and Syria since 2014.6\nIn all of these missions, some democracies decided to participate whereas others\ndecided against participation. If the parliamentary peace thesis holds, countries with a\nparliamentary ex ante veto power should be overrepresented among the non-participants\nwhereas countries without parliamentary veto power should be overrepresented among\nthe participants.\nAs discussed above, four of the five cases studied here have already been examined\nwith a view to the impact of parliament on (non-)participation in military missions:\nKosovo and Afghanistan have been analyzed by Mello (2014), Iraq by Mello (2014) and\nDieterich et al. (2015) and the strikes against the so-called Islamic State by Haesebrouck\n(2016a, 2016b). This article not only adds an analysis of Operation Unified Protector\n(Libya 2011), it also extends the analysis to additional liberal democracies that were\nexcluded from the studies by Mello (2014) and Dieterich et al. (2015). Finally, in contrast\ntheoretic methodology that treats parliamentary war powers as a possible necessary or\nsufficient condition in combination with other factors. Instead, this article follows\nDieterich et al. (2015) in gauging the influence of parliamentary war powers on (non-)\nparticipation in military missions by cross-tabulating the two variables. This difference in\nmethodology, however, is not meant to deny the advantages of a set-theoretic approach.\nInstead, cross-tabulation is best understood to complement a set-theoretic approach and\nthus allow for a triangulation of the question that this article shares with those by Mello\nThe parliamentary peace thesis only applies to democracies. In order to identify\ndemocracies, I rely on the Polity dataset, which has been widely used in International\nRelations and conflict studies.7 The dataset includes an 11-point democracy scale (0\u00ad\n10) and an 11-point autocracy scale (0\u00ad10). A country's regime type (`combined Polity\nscore') is then measured by subtracting its autocracy score from its democracy score,\nyielding a 21-point scale (from -10 to +10). The Polity team itself considers states with\na Polity score of 6 or higher as democracies (Marshall and Cole, 2014: 20). However,\nstudents of democracy and peace have often used a higher cutoff point to identify\ndemocracies. In order to include only countries whose democratic credentials are\nstates that score 8 or higher. This cutoff point is plausible as it excludes countries such\nas Ukraine, Kyrgystan or, at times, Turkey whose democratic credentials have not been\nbeyond doubt and that are thus difficult to compare with `mature' democracies, such as\nthe United Kingdom or the Netherlands.\nIn addition, I follow democratic peace custom by excluding `politically irrelevant'\ncases, that is, countries that are very unlikely to participate in one of the military inter-\nventions under study in the first place. In studies of inter-state war, a shared border or\nthe involvement of a major power are typically taken as indicators of political relevance\nbecause both make armed conflict a real possibility.8 Of course, geographical distance\nhas lost importance in the era of the `wars of choice' under study here. Indeed, some\ndistant states (e.g. Australia) have joined the coalitions intervening in some of the con-\nflicts studied here. Nevertheless, it seems clear that the non-participation of a Latin\nAmerican country in, for example, the intervention in Libya, weighs differently than\nthe non-participation of a European country as the former has a much lower baseline\nprobability to even consider participation in the first place. To exclude states that are\nunlikely to intervene anyway, I limit my study to states that are either full members of\nNATO or linked to NATO via the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme because the\npurpose of the latter has been to allow NATO states to cooperate operationally with\nnon-members.9\nIt is beyond the scope of this article to discuss any of the military missions and the\n(non-)participation of particular liberal democracies in detail. For the interventions in\nKosovo/Serbia,Afghanistan and Iraq, I follow the coding by Mello (2014) where possible\nand add the cases missing in his sample.10 Data on the participants and non-participations\nin air strikes against Daesh are taken from Haesebrouck (2016a); data on Operation\nUnified Protector are based on International Institute for Strategic Studies (2012).\nTo distinguish countries with and without parliamentary veto power over military mis-\nsions, I updated and extended the PARLCON dataset that is also used in the studies of\nEstonia, Latvia, Moldova, Montenegro and Serbia have been added.11\nTo examine the parliamentary peace thesis, I carried out a set of cross-tabulations.\nWhere the number of cases is small and cells in the contingency tables are filled with only\nfew entries, Fisher's exact test is the best way to analyse whether parliamentary ex ante\nveto power is correlated with non-participation in military missions in a statistically sig-\nnificant way.\nFindings\nTables 1 to 6 display cross-tabulations for the military missions studied.\nThe data show that for all missions together, there is support for the parliamentary\npeace thesis: whereas a majority of intervening states has no parliamentary ex ante veto\npowers, the majority of non-intervening states has such a veto, and this difference is sta-\ntistically highly significant. However, this finding does not hold for every individual mis-\nsion. The correlation between war powers and (non-)participation is statistically\nLibya and at the 0.1 level for the campaign against Daesh. However, for OEF and Iraq,\nthe expected pattern is not present, let alone statistically significant.\nAmong the findings on individual missions, the one on Iraq is the most surprising as it\ndirectly conflicts with the study by Dieterich et al. (2015), who found strong evidence for\na parliamentary peace. A closer look reveals that the difference in findings does not pri-\nmarily result from the addition of countries that were not members of the EU (and thus\nexcluded by Dieterich et al., 2015). Instead, the difference results from the use of Mello's\ndata on (non-)participation that include the period between May and August 2003, which\n128 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(1)\nTable 1.

(2015). In this period after the declared end of major\ncombat operations, countries with parliamentary veto powers such as Estonia, Macedonia,\nLatvia, Lithuania and Romania contributed troops--against the expectation of the parlia-\nmentary peace hypothesis. Proponents of the parliamentary peace may point out that\ncountries which contributed troops in the period between March and May 2003 partici-\npated in a war of aggression that lacked the authorisation from the United Nations Security\nCouncil. In contrast, countries joining the coalition after May 2003 could refer to an\nappeal by the United Nations Security Council to help rebuild the country and contribute\nto security and stability. Although this change in international legal status does not lower\nthe risks for the troops on the ground, as subsequent casualties demonstrate, it impacts on\npublic support in liberal democracies. The finding on the 2003 Iraq operation is thus best\nunderstood as a qualification, rather than a rejection, of the parliamentary peace.\nThe pattern of findings across missions suggests that the character of the mission has\nan impact on whether parliamentary war powers constrain government participation. At\nthe same time, the variation across missions makes it unlikely that relatively stable factors\nsuch as military capabilities or government system can account for this variance.12\nWhat sets the missions in Kosovo and Libya apart from OEF and the Iraq War is their\njustification as humanitarian interventions. In 1999, air strikes against targets in Serbia\nwere justified by the necessity to stop the violence by Serbian forces against ethnic\nAlbanians in Kosovo. Similarly, the 2011 strikes against Libya were based on United\nNations Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 that invoked the Responsibility to\nTable 5. 2011 Operation Unified Protector (Libya).\nParticipants Non-participants Total\nEx ante veto\npower\n4: Denmark, Spain, Sweden,\nTurkey\n13: Albania, Austria, Croatia,\nFinland, Germany, Ireland, Latvia,\nLithuania, Macedonia, Moldova,\nMontenegro, Serbia, Switzerland\nNo ex ante\nveto power\n11: Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada,\nFrance, Greece, Italy, Norway,\nthe Netherlands, Romania, the\nUK, the US\n7: Czech Republic, Estonia,\nHungary, Poland, Portugal,\nSlovakia, Slovenia\nFisher's exact test (two-sided): p=0.041\nParticipants Non-participants Total\nEx ante veto\npower\n1: Denmark 15: Albania, Austria, Croatia, Finland,\nGermany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania,\nMacedonia, Moldova, Montenegro,\nSerbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland\nNo ex ante\nveto power\n6: Belgium, Canada,\nFrance, the Netherlands,\nthe UK, the US\n12: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia,\nGreece, Hungary, Italy, Norway,\nPoland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia,\nSlovenia\nFisher's exact test (two-sided): p=0.090.\n130 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(1)\nProtect (Adler-Nissen and Pouliot, 2014) after statements by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi\nled to fears of an imminent massacre of civilians. In contrast, the justifications for OEF\nand the Iraq War emphasised self-defence: OEF started a day after an ultimatum, issued\nby the US government to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to hand over the leadership\nof al Qaida, elapsed. On 18 September, Congress had authorised the US President `to use\nall necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organisations, or persons he\ndetermines planned, authorised, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on\nSeptember 11, 2001, or harbored such organisations or persons'.13 Prior to this, the North\nAtlantic Council of NATO decided that the attacks `shall be regarded as an action covered\nby Article 5'14 in case they were directed from outside the United States. On 2 October,\nthe North Atlantic Council noted that the attacks indeed were externally directed and\ntherefore considered an attack against all members of NATO.\nHumanitarian and self-defence rationales blend in the justification of air strikes against\nDaesh in the case of the imminent threat to the Yazidis in northern Iraq. Thus, a humani-\ntarian motive was the main trigger for air strikes in 2014. At the same time, however, the\ninitial air strikes were justified with a reference to a request from the Iraqi government\nthat had asked for support in its efforts to defend itself against Daesh (Ruys and Verlinden,\n2015). Moreover, later extensions of the air strikes against targets in Syria followed a self-\ndefence rationale that was fuelled partly by Daesh's use of Syrian territory as a base for\noperations against the Iraqi government, partly by the invocation of (collective) self-\ndefence by the French government after the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015.\nThe limited impact of parliamentary war powers on (non-)participation in (collective)\nself-defence missions can be attributed to the efforts of states to signal their support for key\nallies, either out of genuinely felt solidarity or in anticipation of future support in return as\nwell as to the political pressure that key proponents of intervention exert on reluctant states.\nAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States left little doubt that it was `willing\nand able to take successful military action against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda without\nallied support' (Davidson, 2011: 131). However, many liberal democratic governments\nexpressed their readiness, if not eagerness to actively support the United States in its war\nagainst terror. OEF became the umbrella for a broad coalition of states that wanted to join\nan intervention in Afghanistan. The extent to which support resulted from genuinely felt\nsolidarity or from opportunism, that is, in anticipation of reciprocal future support from\nthe United States, is difficult, if not impossible to determine. In any case, to the commu-\nnity of liberal democracies, it was clear that their participation was not militarily neces-\nsary but of potentially high symbolic value.As a consequence, `alliance value'(Davidson,\n2011), that is, an assessment of the importance of ties with the United States, played a key\nrole in decision-making. The German case may serve as an illustration. After his declara-\ntion of `unconditional solidarity', Chancellor Schr\u00f6der was determined to contribute\ntroops to OEF. Given widespread opposition in the governing coalition, the only way to\nhave his parliamentary majority endorse this decision was to link the deployment vote to\na motion of confidence. With 336 to 326 votes, the decision to participate in OEF was the\ntightest in more than 140 deployment votes.\nAfter two years, self-defence was again invoked by the United States while preparing\nfor the war against Iraq.15 In contrast to the immediate aftermath of 9/11, however, the\neagerness among allies to participate was rather low, and the Bush administration resorted\nto a comprehensive set of carrots and sticks to create what critics called a `coalition of the\n(2008) has argued that this policy of economic linkage has often been effective.\nFurthermore, Newnham (2008: 197) argues that some states such as the Baltic countries,\nparticipated in the Iraq War to secure US support in a future conflict with Russia. Although\nsome states, most prominently France and Germany, resisted the pressure, many others,\nespecially in central and eastern Europe, seized the opportunity to demonstrate transatlan-\ntic solidarity (Schuster and Maier, 2006).\nTo be sure, alliance politics also played a role for OperationAllied Force and Operation\nUnified Protector. The former in particular was widely seen as a test for NATO in its 50th\nyear of existence, and Germany's abstention in the UN Security Council vote on authoris-\ning force against Libya was certainly frowned upon. Nevertheless, neither the United\nStates nor other proponents of intervention exerted much pressure on liberal democracies\nto make a military contribution.\nConclusion\nThis article provides modest evidence for a parliamentary peace. Taking five prominent\nmilitary missions of the past twenty years together, countries with a parliamentary ex ante\nveto power are less likely to contribute to a military mission than countries without one.\nHowever, a closer examination of individual missions demonstrates that such a pattern is\nonly statistically significant for three of them: Operation Allied Force, Operation Unified\nProtector and, though only on the 0.1 level of statistical significance, the campaign against\nDaesh. In contrast, countries with a parliamentary ex ante veto power were just as likely\nto join OEF and the Iraq War as countries without such a veto.\nProponents of the parliamentary peace may of course point to the limited number of\ncases and the skewed distribution between participants and non-participants in some mili-\ntary missions, all of which make statistically significant correlations less likely. At the\nsame time, however, the findings reported here echo the studies reviewed above: the\neffect of parliamentary war powers is not robust and unconditional; instead, it depends on\ncontext conditions. Whereas Mello has identified government ideology, that is, the party\npolitical composition of government, as an important factor that interacts with institu-\ntional constraints, this article argues that the character of the respective mission qualifies\nthe effect of parliamentary war powers. If a mission is framed as a test case of alliance\nsolidarity, as was the case with OEF and the Iraq War, domestic institutional constraints\ncan be trumped by alliance politics. If, however, countries enjoy more discretion in decid-\ning on the use of force, domestic constraints such as parliamentary war powers have a\ntangible impact on government policy.\nOpen confrontation between parliament and government is rare in parliamentary\nsystems and thus in the vast majority of countries studied in this article. Although the\n2013 House of Commons vote that prevented the British government from striking\nSyria is a highly visible demonstration of parliamentary war powers, it is also decep-\ntive. A more typical manifestation of parliamentary influence on decisions to use\narmed force are governments refraining from a military mission in the shadow of a\nparliamentary veto in case support is weak or absent. Although governments can\nalways decide to whip the MPs of their party/parties into supporting the government\nline, such action is politically costly and more likely to be taken under international\npressure than in its absence.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n132 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(1)\nNotes\n 1. Another rare episode is the March 2003 vote by the Turkish parliament to not allow the United States to\nuse Turkey as a base for the Iraq War (Kesgin and Kaarbo, 2010).\n 2. An alternative perspective holds that democratic institutions do not constrain but `facilitate information\nrevelation by improving a government's ability to send credible signals of its resolve'(Schultz, 1999, with\n 3. Veto player theory was developed by George Tsebelis (1995, 2002).Although democratic peace theory has\ndeveloped a very similar argument, reference to Tsebelis' work is hardly ever made.\n 4. A noteworthy exception is minority governments, which for this reason are expected to be less likely to\nuse military force (Maoz and Russett, 1993: 626). Empirical results, however, have been contradictory\ngovernments to be `more likely to initiate conflict because they lack the parliamentary majority to demon-\nstrate domestic economic competence'.\n 5. For example, the Economist showed Assad's face on its cover and titled `Hit him hard!'.\n6. Space constraints do not allow an in-depth discussion of these missions here. For a discussion of the\ninterventions in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, see Mello (2014); for Iraq, see also Oktay (this issue) in\nthis Special Issue; for Libya, see Adler-Nissen and Pouliot (2014); for the campaign against Daesh, see\n 7.

For the concept of political (ir)relevance, see Russett (1993: 74). The concept resembles the `possibility\nprinciple', suggested by Mahoney and Goertz (2004) according to which cases should be excluded if the\noutcome under study is impossible.\n 9. The countries under study here by and large coincide with those analysed in Mello (2014) and Haesebrouck\n(2016a). However, I add Lithuania, Slovenia and Switzerland to the Kosovo War study, Moldova and\nSwitzerland to the Afghanistan case study and Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova and Switzerland to the Iraq\nWar study. At the same time, I exclude Australia, Cyprus, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and\nTaiwan because they did not participate in Partnership for Peace (PfP) as well as Luxemburg and Iceland\nbecause of their military insignificance.\n10. Mello's coding of (non-)participation differs from the one in Dieterich et al. (2015) because the time\nperiod under study is much shorter in the latter study. I dichotomised Mello's data with all states coded 0.6\nor higher on Mello's scale as `participants' and all states coded 0.4 or lower as non-participants.\n11. In addition, based on recent research by Fabrizio Coticchia and Francesco Moro (2017), Italy has been\nrecoded as not having a parliamentary ex ante veto power.\n12. The relevance of military capabilities for conflict behavior has been widely acknowledged; the type of\ndemocratic government, especially the distinction between presidential and parliamentary systems has\npossibility that less stable factors such as public opinion account for (some of) the variance. However,\ndata on public opinion of good quality are missing for a substantial number of countries under study in this\narticle.\n13.

In contrast to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), however, self-defence was not the only justification\nbrought forward by the United States. In addition, the Bush administration argued that a series of UN SC\nresolutions allowed for the use of force.\nReferences\nAdler-Nissen R and Pouliot V (2014) Power in practice: Negotiating the international intervention in Libya.\nAuerswald D (1999) Inward bound: Domestic institutions and military conflicts.
