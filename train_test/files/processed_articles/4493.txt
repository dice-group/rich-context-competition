The purpose of\nthe study was to generate new practical knowledge of CL for her, so that she might subsequently improve her teaching\npractice. A thematic analysis of the interview and descriptive data revealed that the incorporation of CL helped promote a\ncomfortable environment and reduce the effects of the hierarchical authority of the instructor. While facing new challenges,\nthe class also co-constructed its own knowledge about the reading content, language concepts, and cultural matters by\nworking as a collaborative group. These findings are represented in the form of a performative text that invites readers to\nactively engage with the study's findings.\n",

This\nchange required students to learn how to learn differently in\na traditional academic environment. For example, instead of\nrelying on her expertise alone, the instructor asked students\nto engage in dialogue with other students and her, about vari-\nous interpretations of readings, related language concepts,\nand aspects of Japanese culture. Their goal was to jointly\nconstruct new knowledge about these topics, knowledge that\nindividual members of the class were unlikely to construct\non their own. To understand how course participants experi-\nenced this change in pedagogy and its potential as a compo-\nnent of her future classroom teaching and learning strategies,\nthe instructor conducted an ethnographic action research\nproject. Following is a brief description of related literature\nand theory, the research method, findings, and discussions of\nresults and implications of the study.\nCL\nCL permeates the discourse of teaching and learning in\nhigher education and is widely accepted as a legitimate peda-\ngogy, especially by those who value peer-to-peer learning.\nFor example, Dillenbourg (1999) defines CL as \"a situation\nin which two or more people learn or attempt to learn some-\nhaps the best known proponent of CL in the higher education\nclassroom, views CL as a kind of non-foundational learning\nprocess in which students work in groups or with members\nof knowledge communities that are larger and more complex\nthan their own. The purpose of CL in this case is re-accultur-\nation; that is, students change their membership from one\nlearning culture to another through negotiating and modify-\ning the language and values established from the original\ncommunity and becoming fluent in the language of the new\ncommunity. For example, a college-bound, high school grad-\nuate may have learned how to learn in a K-12 situation but\nmay not have anticipated different ways of learning required\nin college, especially how knowledge is created. The aim of\nCL in this case would be for the student to transition success-\nfully from his or her K-12 education into the broader aca-\ndemic community and the ways of knowing characteristic of\nthe discipline he or she chooses to study.\nAccording to Bruffee, students in higher education should\nbe expected to examine critically their taken-for-granted\n1The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMegumu D.

For Bruffee, this\nprocess is best supported by \"abnormal discourse\" (Rorty,\nWilliams, & Bromwich, 1980) that enables students to\nestablish knowledge or justify beliefs collaboratively by\nchallenging each other's biases and presuppositions; by\nnegotiating collaboratively toward new paradigms of perception,\nthought, feeling, and expression; and by joining larger, more\nexperienced communities of knowledgeable peers through\nassenting to those communities' interests, values, language, and\nBruffee and other widely cited writers about CL (e.g.,\nespecially concerned that students come to value their own,\ncollaboratively developed knowledge and rely less automati-\ncally on their assumptions about the authority of knowledge.\nThis extends to discipline-specific knowledge, including\nknowledge held by an instructor considered a representative\nof his or her discipline. However, nearly all CL scholars posi-\ntion the instructor apart from their students in this regard and\nnone identifies the instructor as a purposeful co-constructor\nof knowledge alongside the students (Johnson, Johnson, &\nout, this positioning by the instructor can profoundly affect\nthe nature of students' interaction with them and other stu-\ndents. This brings into question how free students really are\nin terms of their ability to co-construct knowledge outside\nlimits set by the instructor.\nPeters and Armstrong (1998) proposed a typology of\nteaching and learning that positions the instructor's relation-\nship to students differently according to type of teaching and\nlearning involved. Their typology consists of three types of\nteaching and learning. Type I (T-I) involves \"teaching by\ntransmission, learning by reception\"; Type II (T-II) is called\n\"teaching by transmission, learning by sharing\"; and Type III\n(T-III) is \"collaborative learning\" (Peters & Armstrong,\nClosely resembling Freire's (1970) banking concept, T-I\nrepresents a traditional type of teaching and learning. The\nfocus of T-I is on the subject matter that reflects philosophy\nand expertise of the teacher and members of his or her disci-\npline. The teacher is the primary source of information, and\nthe flow of information primarily goes from teacher to stu-\ndent. Thus, the primary mode of discourse is monologue and\nthe focus is on individual student learning. Examples of T-I\ninclude lecture accompanied by demonstration, drill, and\nT-II involves more interaction among students who are\nseen as already having knowledge and experiences that they\nmay use to help them develop new knowledge. As in T-I, the\nfocus is on individual learning and the teacher still serves as\nthe primary source of information. Information flows from\nteacher to student and student to teacher, and student to stu-\ndent as they learn by sharing within small groups. The pri-\nmary mode of discourse is discussion. Lecture followed by\ndiscussions exemplifies this type (Peters & Armstrong,\nIn T-III, the teacher and students work together to co-con-\nstruct new knowledge. The teacher becomes a member of the\ngroup, and communication flows from member to member,\nmember to group as a whole, and group to member. Thus,\nindividual members learn, and the group as a whole learns.\nThis conception of CL is rooted in a social constructionist\nview of knowledge (Gergen, 1999). In this perspective,\nknowledge is generated within relationships from which\nhumans derive their conceptions of what is real, rational, and\ngood.\nThe primary mode of discourse in T-III is dialogue.\nAlthough they may have specific knowledge of the topic, the\ninstructor is not presumed sole expert in the classroom.\nStudents are expert in their own lives, including, in some\ncases, prior experience with the subject matter. Whereas in\nT-II the instructor facilitates works from the outside, in T-III\nhe or she facilitates from the inside of the group. Group and\nindividual members learn through critical reflection on past\nexperience as well as what Sch\u00f6n (1983) calls reflection in\naction. Because of its interactive nature and inclusiveness,\nT-III appears strongly related to what Garrison, Anderson,\nand Archer (2010) call a community of inquiry (cf. Skinner\nEven though each type of teaching and learning is distinc-\ntive in terms of its purpose and other dynamics, the typology\nshould be viewed as a set or grouping of types, not as a hier-\narchy, continuum, or stages of teaching and learning. One\ntype is no more or less important than the others at any given\ntime in the classroom experience. An instructor could use all\nthree types across multiple class sessions or one, two, or\nthree types in one session. The goal is to achieve a balance in\ntypes, with each serving in harmony with the other two\nStudents and instructors already know how to act and\nwhat to expect of one another in T-I classrooms and, in some\ninstances, T-II settings. However, studies show that T-III can\nbe particularly difficult for students to learn how to negotiate\nsuccessfully, especially in the beginning of a T-III experience\n2001). It appears that students need time to adjust to different\nworking relationships with each other and the instructor after\na lifetime of mostly T-I and T-II classroom experiences\n(Burress, 2013). Instructors may also struggle with T-III in\nterms of their own goals and interests, such as the need to\nshare responsibility for the learning process with students\nmore so than in T-I and T-II learning (Cross, 1999).\nAccording to a review of literature by Slavich and\nZimbardo (2012), T-III helps students \"restructure their own\nknowledge and understanding of concepts . . . recognize gaps\nBurress and Peters 3\nin their understanding, synthesize, communicate, and discuss\nideas in ways that advance conceptual understanding, (and\nengage in) modeling of effective problem solving strategies\"\n(p. 574). T-III extends these benefits to instructors, yet little\nis said in the literature about the instructor's role as purpose-\nful co-learner. However, it is clear that instructors have\nopportunities to reveal their ways of thinking and learning\nabout the subject matter, including ways of knowing preva-\nlent in their discipline. These opportunities allow instructors\nto model the processes of critical thinking, joint construction\nof knowledge, and dialogical communication, while facilitat-\ning students' participation in the process.\nOther studies report positive learning experiences and\noutcomes in classroom settings across several disciplines.\nFor example, Merrill (2003) examined her own and her stu-\ndent's experiences with CL in a community college informa-\ntion technology course. Her ethnographic analysis indicated\nthat CL was helpful in creating a comfortable learning envi-\nronment, building relationships between members, and\ndeveloping an understanding of differing perspectives among\nparticipants. Similarly, Gray (2008) engaged her freshman\ncomposition class in CL alongside both T-I and T-II. A the-\nmatic analysis of her data revealed that engagement in CL\nhelped her students gain confidence as writers, learn their\nwriting strengths and weaknesses as well as those of others,\nand improve their writing skills. CL also provided increased\nopportunities for the creation of an open, comfortable, and\nsafe classroom environment characterized by critical reflec-\ntion and idea generation.\nFinally, Li (2011) investigated how a group of her Chinese\nuniversity students made meaning of their CL experiences as\nthey engaged in an Intensive English reading course. The\nstudents were 19 to 20 years of age, and their English profi-\nciency was intermediate to high. Based on a phenomenologi-\ncal analysis of students' interviews and class reflections and\nher field notes, Li concluded that the incorporation of CL\nhelped promote positive interpersonal relationships among\nstudents, increase their confidence in speaking English,\nimprove their engagement in learning, and change their\nthinking about teacher and student roles. Li's study is of par-\nticular interest because her course shares some features of\nthe course that was the focus of the present study: for exam-\nple, both courses involved learning of a second language, the\nintroduction of an unfamiliar way of teaching and learning,\nand students who were at the intermediate level of language\nproficiency.\nTo our knowledge, no other research has investigated for-\neign language classroom settings, including Japanese, to\nexamine student and teacher engagement in CL as defined in\nthis article. Nevertheless, the aforementioned research and\nthe first author's graduate studies in CL gave impetus to her\ndecision to incorporate CL in the intermediate Japanese lan-\nguage course she facilitated in 2009 and to study how she\nand the students experienced the process. Her research ques-\ntion was \"How do students and instructor experience the\ninclusion of CL (T-III) as one type of teaching in the interme-\ndiate Japanese language course?\" The following is a discus-\nsion of how the study unfolded.\nContext of the Study\nThe intermediate Japanese language course consisted of 26\nundergraduate students, ages 19 and 20. The majority were\nnative English speakers and were traditional students who\nenrolled in the university immediately after high school. The\ngroup met for a 50-min session 4 times a week for one\n14-week academic semester. The instructor decided to add\nCL to her usual T-I and T-II repertoire. The latter types\nincluded lectures or presentations used to introduce new\nvocabulary and grammar patterns, as well as discussions of\nthese grammar patterns and their usage and conjugations\n(lecture and drill sessions). The instructor reasoned that CL\nwould not be appropriate pedagogy for these aspects of the\ncourse as they typically involved right or wrong answers and\nthat T-I and T-II were better suited. On the other hand, the\ninstructor reasoned that CL would be particularly applicable\nto sessions in which assigned readings, such as biographic\nliterature, were discussed. Knowing that CL is a process that\nengages students and instructor in joint construction of new\nknowledge, it seemed especially suited to readings involving\ncontroversial issues and cultural matters that generally did\nnot call for right or wrong answers. In addition, as her stu-\ndents had already attained the intermediate level of language\nproficiency, the instructor believed that she and her students\ncould go beyond the development of basic language skills to\nexplore and construct knowledge through readings and dia-\nlogue about the Japanese language and culture.\nIn the reading sessions of the course, students and instruc-\ntor sat in a large circle and engaged in dialogue (Bohm, 1996;\nIsaacs, 1999), in both Japanese and English, about assigned\nreadings that they previously read in small groups. To engage\nin dialogue means to be sensitive to what is happening in the\nmoment of discourse, develop shared meanings, and act in\nways that nurture participants' ways of being together, such\nas listening, reflecting, and valuing (Isaacs, 1999). Dialogue\nalso involves mindfully attending to and cultivating knowl-\nedge that is being constructed by individual participants and\njointly with others. Therefore, the instructor positioned her-\nself as part of the group, and she and students assumed\nmutual responsibility for joint construction of new knowl-\nedge. The process of dialogue began with the instructor's\nopen-ended questions to students, such as \"What stood out to\nyou about this reading?\" \"Which part of the reading did you\nfind particularly striking or resonating?\" and \"Which part\ndid you continue to struggle to understand?\" Students were\nencouraged to ask their own open-ended questions to other\nstudents and the instructor. The group then considered these\nquestions in terms of all aspects of the reading materials,\nincluding language, cultural matters, and specific contents of\nthe readings. The questions asked by students and the\n4 SAGE Open\ninstructor encouraged various responses and these responses\nled to additional questions, responses, and reflections.\nInstead of looking for predetermined answers or relying on\nthe instructors' expertise, participants allowed discourse to\nemerge spontaneously from their moment-to-moment expe-\nriences and diverse voices. The instructor encouraged stu-\ndents to communicate in Japanese as much as possible to\nfurther develop their language skills.\nMethod\nThe instructor decided to study her own and her students'\nexperiences with CL in the course for three reasons: (a) the\nexperience was new to all participants, including the instruc-\ntor, and she assumed that the most direct route to understand-\ning participants' experience was to seek their first-person\nreports of the experience; (b) the action research by Gray\nimprove their respective teaching practices, and it seemed\nreasonable to assume that the instructor in the present\ninstance would benefit from a similar undertaking; and (c)\nher findings could contribute to related literature.\nTo examine the students' and her own experiences in the\nCL reading sessions, the instructor selected a qualitative\nresearch method known as performance ethnography\n(Conquergood, 1998). The purpose of utilizing this method\nwas not only to capture how students experienced CL but\nalso to represent the findings in a style more accessible than\nconventional approaches that rely on summary displays of\nfindings.\nData sources consisted of the instructor's field notes and\nindividual phenomenological interviews with volunteer stu-\ndents. Following Bogdan and Biklen's (2007) suggestion,\nthe field notes consisted of two kinds of notations: descrip-\ntive and reflective. The instructor's field notes were used to\nportray the participants and the research setting, describe\nparticular events and activities during the CL reading ses-\nsions, as well as capture the instructor's thoughts and feel-\nings about the method, related ethical dilemmas and conflicts\n(e.g., relational concerns), and her frame of mind (e.g., her\nown assumptions and beliefs) while conducting the study.\nAll students were invited to participate in the study, and\nseven of them volunteered. This number of participants fell\nwithin the acceptable range of participants (n = 6-12) in phe-\nnomenological studies as established by Thomas and Pollio\n(2002). None of these participants had engaged in CL in\nclassroom settings prior to this study. For the interview data,\neach of the seven volunteer study participants and instructor\nmet for an approximately 1-hour, audio-recorded interview\nabout each student's experience with the CL reading ses-\nsions. The interview followed a phenomenological proce-\ndure described by Thomas and Pollio (2002). It began with\nthe question, \"What was your experience with our CL read-\ning sessions like?\" This question was designed to make pos-\nsible a broad range of descriptive responses while also\nfocusing the students on the topic of their CL experiences.\nThis was followed by some probing questions that were\nderived from the participants' responses to the first question\nand subsequent responses. Probing questions or requests\n(e.g., \"Please say more about that . . . \") were designed to\nincrease the richness of a participant's description of his or\nher experience. Instead of being in control of the direction of\nthe interview, the instructor/interviewer approached the pro-\ncess from the \"humble stance of perpetual learner\" (Thomas,\n2005, p. 73). Overall, the goal of the data collection was to\nobtain from the students a rich description of the CL experi-\nences from their individual perspectives.\nAfter the interviews were completed, the instructor tran-\nscribed interview recordings into a Word document for\nanalysis. She then iteratively engaged with the data, read-\ning and re-reading the transcripts for salient themes to the\npoint of redundancy. Seeking to identify key themes of\nexperience that surpassed the variations presented in indi-\nvidual accounts, she attended to broad patterns--first\nwithin each individual's data and then across the data set. In\nthis process, in vivo codes (the actual words used by the\ninformant) were utilized to demarcate shifts in meaning and\ndescribe areas of significance to the experience within the\ndata, as well as sociologically constructed codes (this sum-\nmary glosses over what the informant seemed to be describ-\ning) to identify recurring patterns and organize the data set\n(Coffey & Atkinson, 1996). Theme redundancy occurred\nafter analysis of six transcripts; therefore, the seventh tran-\nscript was not analyzed. The instructor also read her field\nnotes to gain additional insights into the contextual back-\nground of the themes. The second author assisted with the\nthematic analysis, providing an additional perspective and\ninterpretation of the data.\nFindings\nThe back-and-forth interpretation and dialogue resulted in\nidentification of four themes: (a) learning environment, (b)\nprocess and outcomes of learning, (c) responsibilities for\nteaching and learning, and (d) resistance to engaging in dia-\nlogue. Below is a brief description of each of these themes.\n1. Learning environment: The physical surroundings,\npsychological or emotional conditions, and social or\ncultural influences affecting the teaching and learn-\ning of a course participant and the group.\n2. Process and outcomes of learning: Actions taken\n(what and how) individually and collectively in an\neffort to achieve the goal of CL, that is, co-construc-\ntion of new knowledge. What was gained, improved,\nconstructed, and achieved as a result of the CL\nexperience.\n3. Responsibilities for teaching and learning: The\nauthority and power one has to manage and direct the\ncourse of his or her learning. The relationship of\nBurress and Peters 5\npower between the group members, both the students\nand the teacher, as a classroom community.\n4. Resistance to engaging in dialogue: Hesitation,\nreluctance, or refusal of a participant to engage in\nclass dialogue either in English or Japanese.\nTo afford greater access to the meaning of these themes,\nthey were organized and represented in the form of a perfor-\nmative text (Madison, 2008). In this research context, perfor-\nmance refers to \"an interpretive event involving actors,\npurposes, scripts, stories, stages, and interactions\" (Denzin,\n2003, p. 8). The text was constructed based on the thematic\nstructure of the findings as well as the manner that students\nand instructor engaged in a dialogical conversation in the\nJapanese classroom. The text was edited to make it more\nreadable than would be the case if verbatim quotes taken from\ntranscripts and notes were used instead. However, the original\nvoices of the participant interviews and in the instructor's\nfield notes were maintained as much as possible. The purpose\nwas to make the verbal exchanges as authentic as possible as\nthe participants were imaginarily situated in a circle where\nthey interwove their utterances into a dialogical conversation.\nUpon construction of the text, the relationship was ensured\nbetween the text and the findings by relating all parts of the\ntext back to the themes to which they corresponded.\nAs the data were collected and analyzed, the authors prac-\nticed recursive reflexivity (Pillow, 2003). This proved espe-\ncially helpful to the first author/instructor. Even though she\nattempted to suspend her assumptions and biases during the\nanalysis, she also recognized that her relationship with the\nstudents might have affected various aspects of the study. For\nexample, she ascribed grades in the course during the same\ntime as the interviews. This is one instance in which the\npower differential between students and instructor had to be\nacknowledged. During the interviews, the instructor worked\nto minimize this effect by emphasizing to the participants her\npromise of no harm or penalties based on any aspect of their\nparticipation or lack of participation. Nevertheless, one can-\nnot assume that this attempt completely freed the interviews\nfrom the power dynamic of the teacher\u00adstudent relationship.\nIndeed, the study's findings and the performative text may\nrepresent only a \"partial truth\" (Clifford, 1986) as it is situ-\nated in this context.\nThe following script, based on the performative text, is\nintended to help readers experience CL in a way similar to\nwhat the students and instructor experienced in the class-\nroom. We invite readers to engage actively with the text in\nmultiple ways, such as by reading it silently or, preferably, by\nreading it aloud. The reader of this article might also enlist\nothers to play various characters' parts while listening to the\ntext. It may also help to imagine oneself playing the role of\ninstructor, or as a director of the scenes presented in the text.\nThe point is to find ways to engage in the experience repre-\nsented by the performative text. Links to the participants'\nthematic experiences will be discussed later in this article.\nA Performative Text\nAn introduction of the characters is provided below, fol-\nlowed by a script of their performance.\nThe Characters\nEdward:\nA Caucasian male in the senior year of a\nLanguage and World Business program. He\nstudied in Japan as an exchange student dur-\ning his senior year of high school. Edward\nenjoys poems and writes them for self-expres-\nsion, such as his determination and\nindependence.\n Grace:\nAn Asian American female in the junior year\nof a StudioArt program. She is also a member\nof the honors program. When leaving the\nclassroom, Grace hopes to communicate bet-\nter with her Japanese grandmother in\nJapanese.\n Kita:\nA Caucasian female in the senior year of a\nLinguistics program. She is the founder and\norganizer of the Japanese movie night group.\nKita's effort to develop the language skill--\nby speaking with her friends and writing diary\nentries in Japanese--is remarkable.\n\nMike:\nA Caucasian male in the senior year of an\nArchitecture program. He is also an honors\nstudent and is thrilled that his long-time\ndream, attending a graduate school in Tokyo,\nwill finally become a reality in a few months.\nRochelle:\nA Caucasian female in the junior year of a\nLanguage and World Business program. She\nis a close friend of Kita, and both of them are\nactive members of the course. Rochelle finds\ntime in her busy schedule to practice yoga\nand watch Asian dramas.\n Walter:\nA Caucasian male pursuing a double major in\nTheater and History. He attends pilot training\nto be certified to fly helicopters and looks for-\nward to teaching English in China upon\ngraduation.\n Meg: \nThe teacher and a native speaker of Japanese.\nAs a doctoral student specializing in CL, she\nbegan practicing CL in her Japanese language\ncourses and is learning to become a better\nfacilitator of CL.\nAct\nEdward, Kita, Mike, and Walter are gathered in a classroom,\ntalking about a TV show that was aired the prior evening as\nthey await the arrival of others. They are here to have a dia-\nlogue about their experiences with the CL methodology in\ntheir Japanese course. Soon Meg enters the room, briefly\n6 SAGE Open\ngreeting the students while also trying not to interrupt the\nongoing conversation. After catching a breath, she glances at\na watch on her wrist and asks the students to rearrange the\ntables and chairs to create a small circle conducive to dia-\nlogue. As they sit in a circle, Grace and Rochelle enter the\nroom hastily and join the group. Meg then briefly describes\nthe purpose of today's meeting and begins the dialogue by\nasking the group a question.1\nMEG: So what are our CL reading sessions like for\nyou? Is there anything that stands out?\nGRACE:(After a brief silence) One thing that stands\nout to me is the learning environment. It's\nreally comfortable as compared to the other classes\nI've taken in college.\nWALTER: I think that's because engaging in CL\nhelps us learn about each other and build our\n7 relationships.\nROCHELLE: Yeah, and that's not just between us,\nstudents, but also with you (looking at Meg).\nMEG: That's interesting because when I see us\ninteract (pointing to Grace and herself) and you\ntwo interact (pointing to Grace and Mike), I'm con-\nstantly reminded of what different types of\n13 relationships we have.\nROCHELLE: I think it's like an authority versus\npeer kind of thing. But then, I do think having\nyou sit with us changes the dynamics. Obviously,\nyou (Meg) are still the teacher, but it does\ninvolve you more with us and involve us more with\nyou.\n19 MEG: It does, doesn't it?\nGRACE: Yes, it's nice to share knowledge with the\nteacher as well as the classmates in a way\n22 that we don't usually get to.\n24 MEG: I'm glad to hear that.\nGRACE: I think our safe feeling also comes from us\nknowing or assuming that we are not being\n27 graded when we are sitting in the circle.\n29 WALTER: Say more, Grace?\nGRACE: Yeah, in other Japanese classes I've taken,\nthe teacher was usually at the front of the\nroom, asking us questions in Japanese, and we had to\nanswer in Japanese. In this kind of\nsituation, there is stress for us students because it is\nas if the teacher is firing questions off, and\nwe feel like we have to get it right. In a sense, it's like\nbeing graded for each response. That's\n35 pretty scary (laughter).\nWALTER:(Laughter) I can definitely relate to that.\nIt feels like we are being acknowledged,\ninstead of graded, in the CL circle. I mean, I feel our\nopinions about something matter just as\n39 much as our ability to speak or use the language.\nEDWARD: Besides the "
