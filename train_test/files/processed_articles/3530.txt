Such tau aggregate\nis found to be hyperphosphorylated and often proteolytically\nfragmented. Similarly, tau is degraded following TBI (trau-\nmatic brain injury). In the present study, we examined the dual\nvulnerability of tau to calpain and caspase-3 under neurotoxic\nand neurodegenerative conditions. We first identified three\nnovel calpain cleavage sites in rat tau (four-repeat isoform) as\nFragment-specific antibodies to target the major calpain-\nmediated TauBDP-35K (35 kDa tau-breakdown product) and\nthe caspase-mediated TauBDP-45K respectively were\ndeveloped. In rat cerebrocortical cultures treated with\nexcitotoxin [NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)], tau is signifi-\ncantly degraded into multiple fragments, including a\ndominant signal of calpain-mediated TauBDP-35K with\nminimal caspase-mediated TauBDP-45K. Following apopto-\nsis-inducing EDTA treatment, tau was truncated only to\nTauBDP-48K/45K-exclusively by caspase. Cultures treated\nwith another apoptosis inducer STS (staurosporine), dual\nfragmentation by calpain (TauBDP-35K) and caspase-3\n(TauBDP-45K) was observed.

Besides tau\nhyperphosphorylation, proteolytic processing of tau was\nsuggested to facilitate tau deposit formation (Zemlan et al.,\nis also degraded following acute TBI (traumatic brain injury)\nand with neurotoxin exposure in vitro and in vivo (e.g.\ntau BDP (breakdown product) can be detected in neuronal\nculture media following neurodegenerative challenge and in\nCSF (colony-stimulating factor) from human TBI patients.\nSeveral studies have also reported increased levels of tau\nprotein in CSF from brain-injured patients (Zemlan et al.,\nischaemic stroke (Bitsch et al., 2002). A cleaved form of tau\nwas specifically identified in the hippocampus, cortex after in\nvivo kainite administration and a rat model of TBI (Zemlan et\ninvolved in c-tau formation has not been elucidated.\nThere are two cellular cysteine proteases (calpain and\ncaspase-3) that are capable of tau processing.

Park and\nFerreira (2005) reported that calpain could in fact produce\nalso showed that autophagy inhibition in rat brain also\ncause tau proteolysis by calpain. Yet, specific calpain cleavage\nsites in tau protein have never been reported. Tau is also\ncleaved by caspase-3 in cultured neuronal cells under the\napoptotic paradigms that mimic neurodegeneration (Canu\nwas further determined that tau was cleaved by caspase-3 in\nvitro at two major cleavage sites: between Asp25 and Gln26\nnot conserved. Tau truncated at Asp421 is also found as a\ncomponent of neurofibrillary tangle of Alzheimer's brain\nIn TBI and ischaemic brain injury, axons are highly\nvulnerable neuronal structures to mechanical and chemical\ninsults (e.g. sodium and calcium homoeostasis disturbances)\nand excitotoxicity to the brain. Evidence of axonal damage\nfollowing TBI has been documented extensively, and prolonged\nand sustained loss of white matter (Gale et al., 1995; Bramlett\nand Dietrich, 2002) and increased demyelination (Ng et al.,\nunderlying biochemical mechanisms are not completely\nunderstood. Structurally, the damaged axon undergoes\nprogressive changes including swelling, vacuolization and,\noccasionally, disconnection and fragmentation. Ultrastructural\nfeatures, such as neurofilament compaction, misalignment and\ndisassembly, microtubule loss, increased axolemmal permeab-\nility and mitochondrial swelling and disruption of cristae also\ncascade of mechanical and biochemical events that have only\nrecently begun to be elucidated. Increased permeability of the\naxolemma and subsequent Ca2+ influx initiate the activation of\nvarious proteases and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to\ndegradation of the axonal cytoskeleton and disturbances in\nbeen documented following TBI in humans (Adams et al., 2000),\nbut not in rodents. While TAI is recognized as an important\npathological component of acute brain injury, the precise\nbiochemical mechanisms of TAI are unknown. The microtubule-\nassociated tau is preferentially localized in the axon (Binder et\nassociated with axonal disruption (Higuchi et al., 2002).\nIn the present study, we sought to elucidate the major tau\ncleavage sites produced by calpain. We also test the hypothesis\nthat tau protein might be differentially susceptible to proteolytic\nattack by calpain and caspase-3 respectively depending on the\ntype of neurotoxic or neurodegenerative conditions.\nIn vivo model of TBI\nA CCI (controlled cortical impact) device was used to model\ninjured brain tissue including hippocampus and cortex. Adult\nIN, U.S.A.) were anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane in a carrier\nO (4 min), followed by maintenance anaesthesia\nof 2.5% isoflurane in the same carrier gas. Core body tem-\nperature was monitored continuously by a rectal thermistor\nprobe and maintained at 37\u00a11\u00b0C by placing an adjustable\ntemperature-controlled heating pad beneath the rats. Animals\nwere mounted in a stereotactic frame in a prone position and\nsecured by ear and incisor bars. A midline cranial incision was\nmade, the soft tissues reflected and a unilateral (ipsilateral to\nsite of impact) craniotomy (7 mm diameter) was performed\nadjacent to the central suture, midway between bregma and\nlambda. The dura matter was kept intact over the cortex. Brain\ntrauma is produced by impacting the right cortex (ipsilateral\ncortex) with a 5 mm diameter aluminium impactor tip (housed\nin a pneumatic cylinder) at a velocity of 3.5 m/s with a 1.6 mm\ncompression and 150 ms dwell time (compression duration).\nThese injuries are associated with different magnitudes of local\ncortical contusion and more diffuse axonal damage. Velocity\nwas controlled by adjusting the pressure (compressed N2\n)\nsupplied to the pneumatic cylinder. Velocity and dwell time\nwere measured by a linear velocity displacement transducer\n(ShaevitzTM model 500 HR; Lucas, Detroit, MI, U.S.A.) that\nproduced an analogue signal that was recorded by a storage-\ntrace oscilloscope (BK Precision, model 2522B; Placentia, CA,\nU.S.A.). Sham-injured control animals underwent identical\nsurgical procedures but did not receive an impact injury.\nAppropriate pre- and post-injury management was maintained\nto ensure compliance with guidelines set forth by the University\nof Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the\nNational Institutes of Health guidelines detailed in the Guide\nfor the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

For the left hemisphere,\nthe same tissue as the right side was collected. For Western-\nblot analysis, the brain samples were pulverized with a small\nmortar and pestle set over dry ice to a fine powder. The\npulverized brain tissue powder was then lysed for 90 min at\ncocktail (Roche Biochemicals). The brain lysates were then\ninsoluble debris, snap-frozen and stored at 285\u00b0C until used.\nRat primary cerebrocortical culture and\nneurotoxic challenges\nCerebrocortical cells harvested from 1-day old Sprague\u00adDawley\nrat brains were plated on poly-L-lysine coated on six-well\nculture plates (Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH, U.S.A.) according\nto a previously cited method (Nath et al., 1998) at a density of\n(Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) with 10% fetal bovine\nserum in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 10% CO2\nat 37\u00b0C. After 5 days in culture, the medium was changed to\nDMEM with 5% horse serum. Subsequent media changes were\nperformed thrice a week. Experiments were performed on days\n10 to 11 in vitro when astroglia had formed a confluent\nmonolayer beneath morphologically mature neurons.\nNeurotoxic challenges and pharmacologic intervention.\nIn addition to untreated controls, the following conditions were\nh as an excitotoxic challenge (Nath et al., 2000); apoptotic\ninducers STS (staurosporine) (0.5 mM; Sigma, St. Louis, MO,\nU.S.A.) that activates calpain and caspase-3 for 24 h (Zhang Z\net al., 2009); the Ca2+ chelator EDTA (5 mM; Sigma) for up to\n24 h as a caspase-dominated challenge (Waterhouse et al., 1996;\nFor pharmacological intervention, cultures were pretreated 1 h\nbefore the STS, EDTA or NMDA challenge with the calpain\ninhibitor SNJ-1945 (Senju Pharmaceuticals, Kobe, Japan)\nor the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD (OMe)-FMK (R&D,\nMinneapolis, MN, U.S.A.).

In\naddition, 2 mM EDTA was added for caspase-3 and the\nmixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. The protease reaction\nwas stopped by the addition of PAGE-sample buffer.\nGeneration of calpain and caspase-3-specific\nTauBDP-antibodies\nTo ascertain whether tau fragments detected originated from\ncalpain or caspase-3 proteolysis, we raised TauBDP-45K\n(caspase) and TauBDP-35K (calpain)-specific antibodies. A\nsynthetic peptide (Cys-C6\n-SIDMVD-COOH) based on tau C-\nterminal of tauBDP-45K generated by caspase-3 (Chung\n-Cys)\nbased on the new N-terminal of the calpain-mediated\nTauBDP-35K were custom made (California Peptide, Napa,\nCA, U.S.A.). A C6\nlinker and N-terminal cysteine were\nintroduced for the subsequent coupling of the peptide to\nKLH (keyhole limpet haemocyanin) protein using a sulfo-link\ncross-linking reagent (Pierce). After coupling efficiency\ndeterminations, peptides were dialysed, concentrated, and 2\nmg of conjugated protein was used for multiple antigen\ninjections into two rabbits. After 3 months, collected serum\nsamples from the rabbits were subjected to affinity\npurification using the same synthetic peptide coupled to\nsulfo-linked resins (Pierce).

Figure 4(A) shows\nNMDA, EDTA and STS treatments all caused extensive neurode-\ngeneration in vitro. Figure 4(B) further shows that, while NMDA\ninduced a mixed necrosis/apoptosis phenotype, while both STS\nand EDTA produced a robust apoptosis phenotype.\nWe then investigated the relative contributions of cal-\npain and caspase-3 in the fragmentation of tau in cultured\nneurons under several neurodegenerative conditions. With\nNMDA treatment, tau is significantly degraded into multiple\ncalpain-mediated TauBDP-35K with minimal caspase-\nmediated TauBDP-45K (Figure 5, top three panels).\nWhen caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD; 20 mM) was added to the\nNMDA condition, no significant changes of tau breakdown\npattern were observed. In contrast, when inhibitor (SNJ-1945;\n20 mM) was added to the NMDA condition, it significantly\nreduced the lower-molecular-mass fragment, including com-\nplete blockade of the calpain-mediated TauBDP-35K (Figure 5,\ntop and third panels), and yet some high-molecular-mass\nfragments (425\u00ad48K) persisted. Interestingly, when a blot was\nprobed with the anti-caspase-mediated TauBDP-45K antibody,\nTauBDP-45K/48K were detected in the calpain inhibitor-NMDA\nco-treatment lane (Figure 5, second panel).

For tau fragmentation analysis, neurotoxin challenges were undertaken in the\nabsence of presence of either calpain inhibitor SNJ-1945 (20 mM) or caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (20 mM). After 24 h, cell lysates\nwere harvested for protein and immunoblotting analysis with total tau monoclonal antibody (top panel), antibody specific to\ncaspase-mediated TauBDP-45K (second panel), antibody specific to calpain-mediated TauBDP-35K (third panel) or aII-spectrin\nmonoclonal antibody (bottom panel). Results shown are representative of three separate experiments.\nMC Liu and others\n30 E 2011 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\naII-spectrin (Wang, 2000) was probed, it clearly showed that\nNMDA-yielded prominent calpain-mediated SBDP150/\n(Figure 5, bottom panel). These fragments are strongly\ninhibited with their respective protease inhibitors (SNJ and\nZ-VAD). Taken together, these results suggest that in NMDA\nparadigm, calpain is the dominant pathway in tau fragmenta-\ntion with a more minor contribution of caspase.\nWhen the neuronal culture was treated with apoptosis-\ninducing EDTA, tau was truncated only to TauBDP-48K/45K,\nas confirmed by total tau blot and caspase-mediated anti-\nTauBDP-45K blot (Figure 5, top two panels). Both fragments,\nas expected are caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD) sensitive, but\ninsensitive to calpain inhibitor (SNJ-1945) (Figure 5). Thus,\nEDTA challenge produced a straight caspase-dominant tau\nfragmentation condition. The aII-spectrin breakdown pattern\nagain confirmed the presence of caspase-mediated SBDP120,\nbut not calpain-generated fragment SBDP145 (Figure 5,\nbottom panel).\nWhen the culture was treated with another apoptosis inducer,\nSTS, a balance of higher-molecular-mass (45--48 kDa) and low-\nmolecular-mass (35 and 15 kDa) TauBDPs were observed\n(Figure 5, top panel). The 48/45K fragments were caspase-\nmediated, as confirmed by the tau-45K fragment-specific\nantibody blot as well as its sensitivity to caspase inhibitor (Z-\nVAD) (Figure 5, second panel). Similarly, the involvement of\ncalpain was confirmed by the TauBDP-35K-specific antibody\nand its sensitivity to calpain inhibitor SNJ-1945 (Figure 5, third\npanel). Importantly, the presence of calpain inhibitor strongly\nelevated the TauBDP-48K/45K by both total tau blot and anti-\nTauBDP-48/45K blot (Figure 5, second panel), suggesting the\ndual involvement of both calpain and caspase. This is also\nconsistent with aII-spectrin breakdown pattern. Calpain inhib-\nthe caspase inhibitor blocked the SBDP120, but not SBDP145. It\nis noted that both inhibitors failed to block the formation of\nof almost identical molecular mass (Wang, 2000) (Figure 5B,\nbottom panel). Taken together, with STS treatment produces a\nneurodegenerative paradigm where there is a dual and balanced\ncontribution of both calpain and caspase in tau fragmentation.\nImmunoblot analysis of tau protein integrity in\nrat brain after experimental TBI\nTBI is a risk factor for subsequent development of AD. Thus,\nwe were interested in the tau fragmentation process under\nthis acute neurodegenerative condition. We hypothesize that\nsuch tau fragmentation might have downstream conse-\nquences leading to tauopathy and possible development of\nAD. We subjected rats to CCI (controlled cortical impact), an\nexperimental model of TBI, as previously established (Pike\net al., 1998). We then harvested cortical and hippocampal\ntissues for immunoblotting examination with antibodies\nagainst total tau protein (Figure 6), specific to calpain-\nmediated TauBDP-35K and caspase-mediated TauBDP-45K\nrespectively (Figure 7). We have previously detected signifi-\ncant aII-spectrin breakdown products in the traumatic\nIn the nai\n\u00a8ve cortex, tau protein was detected by immuno-\nblots as a cluster of bands approx. 52\u00ad68 kDa, most likely\nrepresenting the various isoforms and phosphorylation states\nof tau protein (Figure 6). Sham (24 h after craniotomy) did\nnot significantly generate TauBDPs. Next, we examined the\ntemporal profile of TBI-induced tau proteolysis in the rat\ncortex. In the rat ipsilateral cortex of the TBI group,\nimmunoblots revealed that TauBDP-35K and TauBDP-15K\naccumulated relatively rapidly, followed by the delayed\nappearance of TauBDP-25K (Figure 6A). When the density\nof two TauBDPs of the TBI group was compared with the\nnai\n\u00a8ve group, the results showed that the TauBDP-15K\nincreased rapidly, as early as 2 h after TBI, and sustained\nover 48 h, followed by its resolution for 3\u00ad14 days\n(Figures 6A and 6B). On the other hand, TauBDP-25K, while\nsignificantly elevated in 2\u00ad6 h, did not reach its peak until 48\nh and this level was sustained until at least 7 days (Figure 6B).\nOther fragments (such as TauBDP-45K) can be observed, but\nthey are minor fragments (Figure 6A). Furthermore, we\nroutinely performed b-actin blots as controls and found\neven sample loading (see Figure 6A). In addition, in the\ncontralateral cortex, no tau proteolysis was observed in all\nthree groups, even when tau immunoblots were intentionally\noverdeveloped (results not shown).\nThe rat hippocampus is another highly vulnerable region\nfollowing experimental TBI. In the nai\n\u00a8ve and sham hippocam-\npus, tau is expressed again as a cluster of isoforms of 52\u00ad68 kDa\n(Figure 6C). In the rat ipsilateral hippocampus of the TBI group,\ntau immunoblots revealed the accumulation of two fragments\n(Figure 6C). When the density of TauBDP-35K and TauBDP-15K\nof TBI group was compared with the nai\n\u00a8ve group, the results\nshowed that both TauBDPs rose as early as 2\u00ad6 h after TBI,\npeaked at 1\u00ad2 days and were sustained over 5 days (Figure 6D).\nTo further distinguish if any of these fragments were\nderived from calpain and/or caspase proteolysis, we employed\nthe two tau-fragment-specific antibodies. In the injured\ncortex, we found robust signals of calpain-mediated TauBDP-\nIn contrast, we only observed a faint caspase-mediated\nTauBDP-45K signal (from 1 to 7 days) on overexposure of the\nblot development (Figure 7A). In the injured hippocampus,\nthe TauBDP-35K signal was again very robust from 6 h to\n7 days, while TauBDP-45K was not detectable (Figure 7B).\nThese results suggest that CCI-induced neurodegeneration\nis accompanied by the formation and accumulation of\ncalpain-mediated TauBDPs with only minor contributions to\ncaspase-generated tau fragments in the injured cortex.\nIn addition, we also sought to compare tauBDP-35K\nformation with calpain-1 and calpain-2 temporal activation\nprofiles. To do this, we employed anti-activated calpain-1\nnew-N-terminal (anti-NH2\n-LGRHENA) antibody (A), or pro-\ncalpain-2 N-terminal (anti-SHERAIK) antibody.

Calpain-1 has an early\npeak on day 2 and 3 and subsided afterward, while calpain-2\nalso peaked on day 2 but was sustained to 3 and 5 days\n(Figure 8). The calpain-1 activation matches very well with the\nappearance of TauBDP-35K (calpain-specific) that also peaked\nat day 2 and 3 in injured cortex (Figure 7). Taken together, these\nresults argue that calpain-1 might be the major isoform\ncleaving tau.\nSuppression of TauBDP-35K by calpain inhibitor\nadministration in vivo\nFinally, to ascertain that the prominent TauBDP-35K generated\nafter CCI was indeed calpain-mediated, we administered a\ncalpain-specific inhibitor agent (SNJ-1945) (Shirasaki et al.,\nbolus) immediately after CCI. Cortical tissue was probed with\na TauBDP-35K-specific antibody (Figure 9). Densitometric\nanalysis shows that SNJ-1945 was effective in suppressing\nt test).\nDISCUSSION\nTau protein is a major neuronal microtubule-associated\nprotein primarily localized in the axonal compartment of\nneurons (Kosik and Finch, 1987). Owing to the presence of\nseveral alternative splicing sites and multiple phosphorylation\nsites, tau protein usually appears on immunoblots as multiple\nbands of approx. 52\u00ad68 kDa. Under normal conditions, tau\npromotes tubulin assembly and stability and is involved in\naxon elongation and transport (Garcia and Cleveland, 2001;\nAvila et al., 2004). Tau interacts with microtubules at the\ntubulin-binding domain to induce tubulin assembly, stabilizes\nthe polymer and minimizes microtubule disassembly\n(reviewed by Garcia and Cleveland, 2001; Drubin and\nKirschner, 1986). Tau abnormality is linked to several neuro-\ndegenerative disorders referred to as `tau pathologies', a\nheterogeneous group of age-dependent cognitive disorders,\nmost notably AD and CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy;\nreviewed by Garcia and Cleveland, 2001). Axonally specific\nmicrotubule-associated protein tau is an important factor in\nAD as tau aggregate is found in a form of neurofibrillary\ntangle. Besides hyperphosphorylation, proteolytic processing\nof tau was suggested to facilitate this tau deposit formation\nSimilarly, tau is degraded following acute TBI and with\nneurotoxin exposure (e.g. Methamphetamine) (Warren et al.,\nproteases (calpain and caspase-3) are capable of tau\nprocessing. In addition, there is now mounting evidence that\nrepeated concussion (or mild TBI) experienced by impact sport\nathletes (e.g. football and hockey players and boxers) can lead\nto a brain disorder called CTE \u00ad a tauopathy disease not\ndissimilar to the tau pathological component of AD (McKee et\nal., 2009). In addition, there are epidemiological data linking\nprior TBI (especially among males) to increased risk of\ndeveloping AD later in life (Van Den Heuvel et al., 2007; Kiraly\nand Kiraly, 2007). Thus, it is possible that tau fragmentation\nin acute brain injury will somehow facilitate or enable tau\naggregate deposit formation (Yoshiyama et al., 2005; Uryu\nCalpain and caspase-3 cysteine proteases are important\nmediators of cell death and dysfunction in numerous CNS\n(central nervous system) diseases and injuries, including TBI\nFigure 8 Examination of autolytic activation of calpain-1 and calpain-2\nin rat cortex following TBI\nWestern blot of nai\n\u00a8ve and cortex CCI time course samples similar to those in\nFigure 6.

Tau is vulnerable to both of these proteases\ncaspase-3 on rat tau has been mapped out at the C-terminal\ncalpain produces multiple fragments including a neurotoxic\nfragment of 17 kDa (Park and Ferreira, 2005), but exact calpain\ncleavage sites remained elusive.\nIn the present study, the primary objective was to examine\nthe relative vulnerability of tau to calpain and caspase-3\nattack under neurotoxic and neurodegenerative conditions.\nWe first identified three major calpain cleavage sites in rat\nthen developed fragment-specific antibodies to target the\nmajor calpain-mediated TauBDP-35K as well as the major\ncaspase-mediated TauBDP-45K respectively (Figure 3).\nIn rat cerebrocortical culture treated with excitotoxin\n(NMDA), tau is significantly degraded into multiple fragments,\nincluding a dominant signal of calpain-mediated TauBDP-35K\nwith minimal caspase-mediated TauBDP-45K (Figure 4). When\ncultures were treated with apoptosis-inducing EDTA, tau was\ntruncated only to TauBDP-48K/45K, which are both caspase\ninhibitor sensitive. Cultures treated with another apoptosis\ninducing STS, dual fragmentation by calpain (TauBDP-35K) and\ncaspase-3 (TauBDP-45K) was observed (Figure 5).\nOur results revealed that 52\u00ad68 kDa tau protein in lysate\nfrom nai\n\u00a8ve rat hippocampus was degraded in vitro into main\nand large fragments (TauBDP-45/48K) by caspase-3. Thus, the\ncalpain-mediated tau protein fragmentation pattern in vitro\nwith in vivo tau proteolysis after TBI (Figure 6). We also noted a\nTauBDP-15K in vitro, in cell culture and in vivo (Figures 3, 5 and\n6) might correspond to the 17 kDa calpain fragment reported\npreviously (Park and Ferreira, 2005). In addition, the antibody\nspecific to the calpain-mediated TauBDP-35K readily detected\nthis fragment in both injured cortex and hippocampus for\nsustained post-TBI intervals (Figure 7). Since the controlled\ncortical impact device targets the cortex, there was more focal\ninjury in the ipsilateral cortex tissue than in the hippocampal\ntissue, which was impacted indirectly by contusive force. As a\nresult, there is more extensive tau proteolysis in the cortex than\nin the hippocampus (Figure 7). Equally importantly, TauBDP-\n35K generated after CCI was suppressed by systemic admin-\nistration of calpain-specific inhibitor agent (SNJ-1945)\n(Figure 9). These results are consistent with those reported by\nb-amyloid-induced tau cleavage in hippocampal neurons.\nRegarding the contribution of caspase to tau fragmentation\nin vivo, we know that rat tau is cleaved by caspase-3 between\nthis cleavage produced large TauBDPs of 45K/48K (Figure 3),\nalmost indistinguishable from the intact tau clusters, it was\ndifficult to ascertain whether these fragments were detected\nin TBI using total tau antibody (Figure 5). Therefore, we\ndeveloped an antibody (anti-TauBDP-45K) that only detected\nthe caspase-3 generated new tau C-terminal (SSTGSIDMVD-\nCOOH), but does not recognize the intact tau or calpain-\nproduced TauBDPs (Figures 2 and 3). Using this fragment-\nspecific antibody, we observed that the caspase-3-generated\nTauBDP-45K/48K was readily detected during in vitro caspase-\n3 digestion (Figure 3), but was only minimally detected in\ninjured cortex in vivo after TBI (upon overdevelopment of the\nblot) (Figure 6). Taken together, these results strongly suggest\nthat tau protein is primarily attacked in vivo by calpain with\nonly minor contributions by caspase-3 following TBI in rats.\nThis is in contrast to chronic neurodegenerative paradigms\nwhere tau is cleaved more prominently by caspase-3 (Canu\nKrishnamurthy and Sneige, 2002). In addition, more minor\ncaspase-3 activity in our TBI model could in fact be due to\nsome inhibitory pathway for caspase. Also, caspase-3 expressed\nat high levels in brain from fetal rats and rat pups, but is down-\nregulated in adult rats (Shimohama et al., 1999), possibly\nexplaining the low TauBDP-45K levels in vivo after brain injury\n(Figure 6), while in rat in vitro cultures (14 div), there was more\ncaspase-3 participation (Figure 5).\nIn summary, following acute brain injury, tau protein is\npredominantly vulnerable to calpain attack following acute\nTBI with minor contributions by caspase. Yet, in cultured\nneurons, different acute neurotoxic challenges result in\nvarious degrees of calpain and caspase contributions in tau\nfragmentation. Thus, caution should be exercised when\nstudying tau fragmentation. Employing calpain- and cas-\npase-generated tau fragment-specific tools will add to the\nfidelity of such tau fragmentation analysis. In addition, if\npreserving tau integrity is a therapeutic goal, depending on\nthe pathological condition, one might consider the use of\ncalpain and/or caspase inhibitory agents. Lastly, to study the\npossible linkage between acute head trauma and subsequent\ndevelopment of tauopathy (CTE and AD), it will be very\nimportant to examine if the calpain-generated TauBDP-35K,\nin addition to caspase-generated TauBDP-45K, can be\ndetected in aggregated tau or neurofibrillary tangles. These\nefforts are now ongoing in our laboratories.\nK.K.W. and R.L.H. hold equity in Banyan Biomarkers Inc. a\ncompany commercializing technology of detecting brain injury\nbiomarkers.
