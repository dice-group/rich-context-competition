We ask whether respondents' recording behaviour differs depending on\nwhether individuals who do roll the die lose or win. We argue that winners may attach a\nmore positive feeling to the survey than losers and therefore exhibit more commitment\nto the diary, e.g. by reporting better quality data. Beyond providing evidence on the\neffect of conducting up-front experiments in representative surveys our results also\ncontribute to the literature on incentives.

Discussion Papers represent the authors' personal opinions and do not\nnecessarily reflect the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank or its staff.\n1 Introduction\nBehavioural economists and psychologists often do experiments with convenience\nsamples (e.g. college students), but recently there is growing interest in embedding\nbehavioural experiments in representative surveys. This is one of the many promising\nnew directions in which survey methodology has been evolving.\nThe results of such experiments have been analysed at great length, but little is known\nabout the impact of running a behavioural experiment and its outcome on participants'\nattitude towards the survey and ultimately on data quality in other parts of the study,\ne.g. the classic questionnaire part. Depending on the set-up of the experiments, there is\nscope for the experiment to induce biases and measurement error in the collected data.\nOur paper provides evidence on this issue. We link our experiment to the literature on\nthe role of incentives in surveys. Our incentive experiment differs from the existing\nliterature in two important respects. First, we do not focus on participation incentives,\nbut on incentives randomly assigned to participants between two stages of the\ninterviewing process, i.e. between a regular questionnaire and self-administered diary\ncollecting data on payment transactions. We will therefore be able to assess whether\nincentives have an effect on data quality given participation. Second, our participants\nare aware that others have received a different incentive. Thus, they might be upset if\nthey receive nothing or, on the contrary, be very pleased if they win a prize. This\npositive or negative attitude towards the survey \u00ad on top of the monetary value \u00ad should\nresult in more pronounced effects of the incentive on data quality, measured along\nvarious dimensions. We consider different indicators of item non-response: transactions\nwhich are not reported at all as well as incompletely reported transactions. Another\nmeasure of data quality is the rounding of transaction amounts.\nThe basis for our analysis is a risk aversion experiment, which is run between a standard\nquestionnaire type data collection and a self-administered one week diary on\nconsumers' point-of-sale expenditures. In the experiment the consumers have the choice\nbetween receiving a sure payment of 10 euro and participating in a game. If they opt for\nplaying the game they roll a die and either win 20 euro if it shows 4, 5, 6 or nothing if it\nshows 1, 2, or 3. The consumer's choice to play or not to play is a measure of risk\naversion. For players, the risk experiment is also an incentive experiment, with a\nrandom assignment of an extra incentive if they win and a loss of 10 euros if they lose.\nOn top of the monetary value, \"winning\" the game may induce a positive attitude\ntowards the survey. Both the monetary incentive itself and the positive attitude from\nwinning should lead to better data quality in the diary.\nWe find that the behavioural experiment seems to have some impact on consumers'\ncommitment to the survey diary in that they record more transactions, but it does not\ninduce a bias on the key qualitative results. This is good news for survey practitioners\nand analysts alike.\n2 Related Literature\nIn this section we review the literature on the effects of incentives on data quality. We\nare not aware of any studies that address directly the effect of behavioural experiments\nas such on data quality in subsequent data collection and thus we focus on the incentive\naspect of our experiment.\nThe study by Bonke and Fallesen (2010) on Danish data comes closest to what we are\ndoing in this paper. Bonke and Fallesen (2010) study how different incentives, paid out\nthrough a lottery, explain people's participation rates, choice of survey mode\n(CATI/CAWI) and data quality in a large scale Danish survey on time-use and\nconsumption. What makes the study particularly interesting for us is that they\ninvestigate data quality in the survey diary context. However, in contrast to our study,\ntheir participants are not aware that there are lotteries with varying prizes. They find a\nstrong effect of incentives on response rates as well as mode choice, but no effect per se\non data quality. Neither item non-response in the regular questionnaire of their study,\nnor the number of reported activities or consumed goods and services in the diary differ\nsignificantly with the incentives provided, if they analyse both CATI and CAWI\nrespondents. They do find some positive effects of incentives with respect to data\nquality for CATI interviewees only. That the impact of incentives on data quality may\nbe rather limited has also been documented by other scholars. Davern et al. (2003) and\nShettle and Mooney (1999) investigate the impact of incentives on classic measures of\ndata quality like item non-response and the number of edited variables/cases. They find\nthat (prepaid) monetary incentives do not matter for data quality. Similarly Tzamourani\nand Lynn (2000) show that there is no clear effect of incentives on data quality,\nconcluding that \"... the incentives did not affect the respondents' answers in any way,\nthat is they did not induce bias in the responses.\" (p.16) G\u00f6ritz (2005) documents for a\nweb-based survey that if respondents are offered an incentive that is contingent on\ncompleting all relevant questions in the questionnaire, their reporting behaviour in terms\nof number of omitted questions and other quality indicators does not differ from that of\nrespondents not offered the incentive. The same seems to hold for web-based studies\nWhether incentives have a positive, negative or any effect at all on respondents'\nreporting behaviour is nonetheless still an open question. Studies by Lynn and Sturgis\nfound \u00ad contrary to the studies cited above \u00ad that incentives do have an effect on\nreporting behaviour and data quality. Lynn and Sturgis (1997) experimented with\nincentives in surveys involving diaries. They find a significant effect of incentives on\nthe number of events recorded in the diary. Goldenberg and Ryan (2009) report that in\nthe US Consumer Expenditure Diary Survey respondents receiving a pre-paid monetary\nincentive of $20 or $40 reported more expenditures and also performed better on other\nindicators of data quality. A similar result is reported by Goldenberg et al. (2009) for the\nsame type of incentives used in the Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey. Singer et\nal. (2000) show that for some households, paying an incentive reduces item non-\nresponse. However, the effect is very small: \"Only 7 percent is explained by both the\ndemographics and the incentives, and incentives alone explain less than 1 percent of the\nvariance in item nonresponse.\" (Singer et al., 2000: 180). They also find an impact of\nincentives on the distribution of responses. Respondents receiving an incentive seem to\nbe in a better mood (see also Schwarz and Clore, 1996) and report more optimistic\nexpectations. Willimack et al. (1995) summarize their findings: \"In addition, evidence\nsuggests greater response completeness among responding incentive recipients early in\nthe interview, with no evidence of increased measurement error due to the incentive.\"\n(p. 78). James and Bolstein (1990) find that what they call \"large\" prepaid incentives of\n$ 2 lead respondents to expend more effort on completing questions in the mail survey.\nThey measure greater effort by the length of the respondents' answers, the number of\ncomments and number of words written. Interestingly they also find that large\nincentives increase \"... comments that were more favourable towards the survey\nsponsor\" (p. 346), which signals a stronger commitment to the survey. James and\nwhich have also found that respondents receiving monetary incentives have a tendency\nto provide more comments and more complete responses. A similar result has been\n3 Data and Variables\nIn this section we describe the Bundesbank's Payment Survey and the behavioural\nexperiment we ran in more detail. We also provide some information about respondent\ncharacteristics. Furthermore, we discuss various measures of data quality in payment\ndiary survey which might be affected by the incentives.\n3.1 The Bundesbank's Payment Survey\nIn 2014 the Bundesbank conducted the third wave of its payment behaviour survey\ncalled \"Payment Behaviour in Germany\". The survey was run by the market research\ninstitute MARPLAN on behalf of the Deutsche Bundesbank. The face-to-face\ninterviews with the respondents were conducted between May and July of 2014.2 In\ntotal 2,036 persons participated in the survey. The survey is representative for the\nGerman population aged 18 and older.\nThe survey consists of two main parts, a CAPI interview and a drop-off paper and\npencil diary3, which was handed out to participants after the completion of the\ninterview.4 While the interviews contained questions on topics like the ownership and\nusage of payment instruments, cash withdrawal behaviour, perceived risks of payment\ninstrument usage, and respondents' demographics, the diary collected information on\nactual transactions over a period of seven days and specifically refers to direct payment\ntransactions at the point-of-sale, i.e. all transactions apart from recurrent transactions\nlike rent payments, insurance fees, telephone and utility bills. The information collected\nin the paper and pencil diary includes the euro amount of each transaction, the location\nwhere the transaction took place (16 different locations including \"retail purchases for\nday-to-day needs\", \"filling stations\", \"restaurants\", \"e-commerce\", \"payments to private\nindividuals\", etc.) and the payment medium used to settle it (cash and a list of eleven\ncashless payment methods, e.g. debit cards, credit cards, e-payment schemes, payment\nschemes via mobile phone, contactless card payments). Additionally, respondents had to\nprovide information on cash withdrawals in the diary. The diary contains space for up to\neight transactions for each day and some spare pages if more than eight transactions\noccur on one day. At the top of each page of the diary the respondents were asked to fill\nin the date and then all transactions pertaining to this date. The printed diary also\ncontains a page with an example of how to fill in the diary and the interviewers\n2 The sample for the survey was drawn using a random-route procedure developed by the Association of\nGerman Market and Social Researchers, the so-called \"ADM\" (see Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik, 2003, on random\nroute samples). This design implies that at a first stage small geographical areas are randomly drawn from\nthe population of all geographical areas in Germany using pps-sampling. In a second step a random\nstarting point is drawn which is linked to a specific pre-defined (walking) route the interviewer has to\nfollow in order to reach the households. Finally within each household one interviewee is selected using\nthe last birthday rule. When designing the random sample of areas (first stage), care was taken to ensure\nthat consumers from all 16 federal states (L\u00e4nder) were included in the gross sample.\n3 Respondents were also offered to fill in the diary using an application on their smartphone. Less than\ntwo percent of respondents chose this option.\n4 To spread the interviews and collected diary data across the whole survey period, the addresses/random\nstarting points were not given to the field at one point in time, but rolled out continuously, with new\naddresses/starting points in the field each day. This procedure ensures that interviews are conducted on all\ndays of the week (including weekends and holidays), which implies that payment diaries were also started\non each day of the week. In practice we see that more respondents started on Wednesdays (19%)\ncompared to Sundays (9%).\nexplained the procedure of recording transactions to the respondents when they handed\nover the diary.\nRespondents received incentives both for answering the survey and for filling in the\ndiary. After completion of the CAPI interview the interviewer gave the respondents a\npen, a notepad and a package of shredded banknotes. A monetary incentive of 10 euro\nwas sent to everyone who answered the payment diary and returned it to the market\nresearch institute. All these incentives were paid to respondents independent of the\noutcome of the experiment. They do thus not confound our analysis.\nA novel feature of the 2014 survey was an experiment which is supposed to elicit\nrespondents' risk aversion. The experiment was run after the face-to-face interview and\nadministered by the interviewers to all respondents.5 Respondents were free to choose\nwhether they wanted to participate in the experiment. Out of the 2,036 persons\ncompleting the CAPI, 1,952 respondents (almost 96%) decided to take part in the\nexperiment. 6 Therefore we can rule out considerable bias in the group of participants\ndue to response rate bias. Consumers who took part in the experiment were given the\nchoice to receive 10 euro or participate in a game. If they opted for playing the game\nthey rolled a die and either won 20 euro if it showed 4, 5, or 6, or nothing if it showed 1,\n2, or 3. The expected value of the game is 10 euro and the \"assignment\" of consumers\nto one of the two states is obviously random if the die is fair and interviewers do\nadminister the experiment correctly. 982 consumers out of 1,933 participating in the\nexperiment took the 10 euro and 951 consumers rolled the die (see Table 1). The share\nof winners is about 10 percentage points higher than expected, at almost 60%.\nTable 1 - Overview of sample sizes\nAll observations\nSafe present Roll die\nOf which:\nlosers winners\n5 In contrast to many other behavioural experiments, no subgroup of respondents was selected, i.e. the\nexperiment is carried out using a representative sample of the population.\n6 19 participants had to be excluded because they either did not return the diary or they returned a diary\nwithout any transactions, so that we work with a sample of 1,933 consumers.\nIt cannot be ruled out that the interviewers deviated from the instructions and e.g.\nallowed the respondents to role the die several times or they simply paid out the 20 euro\nregardless of the number on the die. If it were the case this would mean a deviation from\nan experimental setting with randomly assigned outcomes. Unfortunately it cannot be\nchecked ex-post why the realized and expected values do not match.7\nTo make sure that no bias with respect to observable socio-demographics exists\nbetween winners and losers we run a series of t-tests (for results see Table A1 in the\nAppendix). All but one come up negative, indicating that the composition of the two\ngroups is very similar. As expected there are significant differences in socio-\ndemographics between those respondents who take part in the game and those who do\nnot.8 Players are younger, more likely to be male and have on average a higher income.\nWe also run probit regressions with the decision to roll the die (yes/no) as well as the\noutcome of the roll of the die (win/lose) as dependent variables, and socio-demographic\nvariables as explanatory variables (see Table A2 in the Appendix). They broadly\nsupport the results of the individual t-tests. In addition, we use the CAPI interview to\ncheck whether winners and losers differ in their self-assessed risk preferences, their\ntechnological literacy and their approach towards new payment methods (see Tables A3\nand A4 in the Appendix). We do not find any significant differences between the groups\nin any of our various measures of these concepts. In contrast, participants taking the safe\npresent are significantly more risk-averse and prudent than those who role the die,\nwhich supports the validity of the experiment. What is more, they are less\ntechnologically literate (less likely to use the internet and electronic devices) and are\nmore conservative in their payment behaviour (less open to payment innovations, less\nlikely to possess a credit card or use e-payment schemes).\nWe have also checked for interviewer effects. In the decision to roll the die or not, these\neffects exist (see Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix). Respondents who had female\ninterviewers were more likely to roll the die.9 Interestingly, female respondents with\nmale interviewers were most likely to take the safe present and male respondents with\nfemale interviewers were least likely to do so. We do not find significant interviewer\n7 The survey agency checked with respondents after the interview whether the interviewers actually\nconducted the experiment or just kept the money for themselves and whether the interviewers correctly\nnoted the result of rolling the die. Respondents confirmed that the experiment had been offered and that\nthe results had been recorded correctly. This is not a thorough check of whether consumers were allowed\nto roll the die more than once, however. Unfortunately, it is not possible to identify ex-post those\ninterviewers who did not follow the instructions because the average number of interviews per\ninterviewer is only nine. Thus, the law of large numbers does not apply and a deviation of an\ninterviewer's share of winners or losers from the 50% mark is not necessarily a sign of misbehaviour.\n8 For literature on the link between socio-demographic characteristics and risk aversion see e.g. Eckel and\n9 Female interviewers are also younger than male interviewers on average.\neffects on winning and losing in the game, although the share of winners (both male and\nfemale) is slightly higher when the interviewer was female.\n3.2 Measures of data quality\nA key decision we had to take is how to measure data quality in payment diary\nsurveys.10 We follow the literature cited above and look among other things at measures\nrelated to item non-response. Item non-response can come in the form of a missing\nanswer for an individual transaction or a missing transaction. We use the \"share of\nincomplete transactions\" as our measure of (classic) item non-response of the first type.\nA transaction is incomplete if any of the required information regarding the transaction\nis missing.\nWhile classic item non-response is easy to detect and measure, transactions missing\ncompletely are harder to examine. Usually no reference statistics are available which\nwould allow the researcher to detect underreporting of transactions. A comparison of\nthe total number of transactions or activities reported by consumers with incentives and\nthose without has thus been used as an indirect measure (e.g. Fricker and Tourangeau,\n2010, Axhausen et al., 2002). We follow this literature and look at the total number of\ntransactions reported for each day and their structure with respect to payment methods\nand transaction size.11 For cash purchases we have an additional way to assess indirectly\nthe \"completeness\" of the diary. Using the information on the initial cash balance before\nthe first transaction is recorded in the diary, as well as cash purchases and withdrawals\nthroughout the diary period we can calculate each consumer's \"hypothetical\" cash\nbalance at the end of the diary period and compare it with the figures they report\ndirectly. If there are significant deviations this would indicate either under-reporting or\nover-reporting of cash payments or withdrawals, respectively.12\nFinally we assess the data quality by looking at the share of rounded values (see e.g.\nFricker and Tourangeau, 2010). The share of rounded values should be an indicator of\nless commitment to the survey, as providing an exact figure can be burdensome for\nconsumers.\n10 Issues related to unit non-response and response rate biases (see e.g. Bonke and Fallesen, 2010, p. 24)\nare not considered. The reason is that only 7 out of 958 participants who rolled the die did not return the\ndiary or returned an empty diary. Thus, we focus on the 951 remaining respondents in our analysis.\n11 Distinguishing transactions by types is comparable to Fricker and Tourangeau (2010)'s classification of\nactivities into different types, like basic daily activities and other activities.\n12 One problem with this measure is that we cannot be certain that the initial cash balance and the final\ncash balance are reported without error themselves.\n4.1 Number of transactions\nThe first indicator of data quality we look at is the number of transactions. We find that\nwinners record significantly more transactions on the first two days and the last day of\nthe diary period than respondents who did not win (see Figure 1 and Table A5 in the\nAppendix). The higher number of transactions on the last day can be interpreted as an\nindicator of a strong/enduring commitment to the survey instrument, if one assumes that\nthe willingness to record transactions declines as the diary period progresses.\nFigure 1 \u00ad Number of transactions per person per day\nNotes: *, **, *** mean difference is significant at the 90%, 95% or 99% level (one-\nsided t-test).\nIn order to rule out that socio-demographic variables or the day of the week confound\nthe analysis in Figure 1, we further examine the number of transactions reported \u00ad both\nthe total number and the numbers on days 1 and 2, respectively \u00ad and the likelihood of\nreporting any transactions on day 1 and day 2 using regression analysis. Columns (I),\n(II) and (III) in Table 2 confirm that winners report more transactions in total and on the\nfirst two diary days, even after controlling for consumers characteristics like age,\ngender, income and household size as well as the day of the week (where applicable).13\nThe estimated coefficient for \"WINNER\" of 0.057 in column (I) corresponds to a\ndifference in the number of transactions between winners and losers of almost 0.6, as\n13 The estimation results for the control variables as well as definition of the control variables are reported\nin Tables A8 and A19 in the Appendix.\n\n\n\n\n      \nZ Z \n\n\n \ncan be seen from Table A9 in the Appendix. For the first and second day of the diary\nthe difference between winners and losers also remains significant at conventional\nlevels. This result is mainly driven by the fact that the share of diaries without any\ntransactions on days one and two is significantly lower for winners than for participants\nnot winning the 20 euro (see columns IV and V in Table 2).14\nTable 2 - Results of estimations on number of transactions and empty diaries\n(I) (II) (III) (IV) (V)\nVariable Total\nnumber of\nTA (count)\nNumber of\nTA on day\nNumber of\nTA on day\nEmpty\ndiary on\n(dummy)\nEmpty\ndiary on\n(dummy)\nNegative Binomial Probit\nWINNER\nControl\nVariables\nIncluded (see Tables A8 and A19 for results and definitions)\nalpha\nNotes: *, **, *** mean coefficient is significant at the 90%, 95% or 99% level. Robust\nstandard errors are given in brackets. TA is transactions.\nIn Figure 1 and Table A5 we look at a specific day and test whether the number of\ntransactions reported differs between winners and losers. Instead, one can also look at\nwinners and losers separately and examine whether the number of transactions reported\nper day changes during the diary week for. Tables A6 and A7 in the Appendix show\nthat on the first survey day the number of reported transactions is significantly higher\nthan on the other days for both winners and losers. Winners also report significantly\nmore transactions on days two and three than on the following days. Losers report more\ntransactions on day three than in the rest of the week, while day two does not differ\ngreatly from days four, five, six, or seven. In sum, both winners and losers show a\nstrong initial commitment to the diary, but it appears to be even higher for winners than\nfor losers.\n14 In contrast, the higher number of transactions for winners on the last day of the survey period is driven\nby differences in the average number of transactions for those individuals who reported any transactions\nat all.\nOne could argue that the higher number of transactions for winners is not due to the\nhigher commitment of winners, but can be traced back to an income effect. In that case,\nwinners would simply feel \"richer\" due to receiving 20 euro and therefore spend more\nand have more transactions than they if they had not received the money. We do several\ntests to investigate this income effect. If the income effect existed, it should be larger for\nconsumers with a low income than for those with a high income. Consequently, the\ndifference in transactions reported between winners and losers should be larger for\nrespondents in the lowest income category compared with those in higher income\nclasses. We test this assumption by including an interaction variable\nWINNER*INCOME in our regressions on the number of transactions reported and the\nshare of empty diaries, which allows us to identify the effect of winning on the quantity\nof transactions reported in each income category. The results can be found in Table A10\nin the Appendix. Confidence intervals for the predicted outcomes (number of\ntransactions and share of empty diaries) can be found in Table A11. Figure 2 gives a\ngraphical presentation of the estimated number of transactions in the diary week for\nwinners and losers in different income categories. The respective confidence intervals\nare also shown. As one can see, winners with low income report only slightly more\ntransactions than losers in the same income category. The difference is far from being\nstatistically significant. In the middle income category, winners report significantly\nmore transactions than losers (the difference is 1.2 transactions). Consequently, the\nhigher number of transactions reported by winners in the estimation without interaction\nterms can mainly be traced back to middle income participants, not to those respondents\nfor whom a potential income effect is expected to be largest.\nFigure 2 - Predictions of number of transactions for winners and losers, by income\ncategory\nIf winners immediately spent the 20 euro they receive (in addition to their normal\nspending), their amount spent during the diary week should be higher than the amount\nspent by losers all else equal. As the 20 euro are most likely spent in cash, we look at\nthe amount of cash disbursed during the week.15 However, if participants simply feel\n\"richer\", they could also spend the amount by cashless means of payment. Therefore we\nalso consider the total amount of spending during the diary week. As there are a few\ncases of transactions with very high amounts, which should be regarded as outliers, we\ndo not consider t-tests of differences in means and simple OLS regression appropriate.\nInstead, we use robust regression (using the Stata command rreg) and median\nregression. Results are presented in Table A12 in the Appendix. All regressions show\nthat there is no statistically significant difference between winners and losers in total\nspending and cash spending. Although the estimated coefficients for winners are\npositive, they are far below 20 euro. Again, this leads us to conclude that income effects\ndo not drive our results on the quantity of data reported in the payment diaries.\n15 Below we will also show that the cash share calculated based on the diary data is not statistically\ndifferent between winners and losers.\nPredicted Number Of Events\nAdjusted Predictions of WINNER*INCOME with 95% CIs\nTo sum up, we find that winners report more transactions than losers, in particular on\nthe first and second diary day. These differences are neither driven by socio-\ndemographics of the respondents, nor by income effects. Whether the high engagement\non the first diary days leads to more accurate reporting or gives room to survey\nexuberance, i.e. respondents report transactions that did not actually take place on that\nday, is an open issue. Based on the evidence we present here it e.g. cannot be ruled out\nthat consumers either report older payments on day one or change their behaviour and\ndeliberately buy something so they do not have to leave the first days' page of the diary\nempty.\nTo shed some light on this latter issue we analyse the structure of payments for each day\nfor the two groups of consumers. If the structure differed significantly this would be an\nindication of the winners reporting specific or special payments on days one and two.\n4.2 Type and size of transactions\nTo investigate whether winners report specific or special payments on days one and\ntwo, we first look at cash transactions as a specific type of transaction. Figure A1 in the\nAppendix shows that while no clear decreasing pattern exist with respect to the overall\nnumber of cash transactions recorded by the consumers participating in the experiment,\ndays one and two exhibit the highest average number of cash transactions for winners.\nHowever, day one also sticks out for losers. Cash transactions thus follow a similar\npattern as the total number of transactions described in Section 4.1. Consequently, the\nhigher number of cash transactions could simply be a \"sample size\" effect and not\ninduce a bias in the analysis of payment behaviour, which is mainly concerned with the\nshare of cash transactions. A higher absolute number of cash transactions for winners\nwould induce a bias only if it were disproportionally higher than in a situation in which\nthey had lost. Put differently, if participants who win report more cash and more non-\ncash payments, no distortions should occur. In order to identify possible distortions, we\ncompare the cash shares of the two groups of consumers across days.\nFigure 3 and Table A13 in the Appendix show that the difference with respect to the\ncash share between those who win and those who lose is insignificant on each of the\nseven diary days as well as for the whole diary week. Moreover, it is sometimes positive\nand sometimes negative, and alternates for the first two days.16\n16 A similar picture emerges if we calculate the share of cash transactions for each day by first grossing up\nall cash transactions and dividing this number by the total number of transactions on the respective day,\ncompared to first calculating the share of cash transactions for each individual and then taking the\naverage, as we did in Figure 3. The additional results are available upon request.\nFigure 3 \u00ad Share of cash transactions per person per day\nNotes: Calculated for individuals with more than zero transactions on given day.\n*, **, *** mean difference significant at the 90%, 95% or 99% level (two-sided t-test).\nWe also see that the cash share shows a high fluctuation between days for winning\nconsumers, while the consumers who lose exhibit the \"typical\" pattern, i.e. the cash\nshare is highest on day one (see Schmidt, 2014). We do not find significant differences\nin the reported cash shares between day one and all other days of the diary week \u00ad\nneither for winners nor for losers. Taking this together there is no evidence for a\ndisproportional reporting of cash payments on days one and two for winners.\nAnother classic categorisation of transactions is by their size (see e.g. Bagnall, 2015).\nThere is evidence that small value transactions are underreported in diary surveys. A\nhigh and stable number of small value transactions can therefore be interpreted as a sign\nof good quality.17 A higher number of small value transactions below 5 euro and in\nparticular also a higher share among all transactions for winners would suggest that\nthese consumers do exhibit a stronger commitment to the survey. In our study, the\ndifference in the share of small value transactions between winners and losers is not\nsignificant (see also Figure 4 and Table A14 in the Appendix). Interestingly, the share\nof small value transactions below 5 euro is higher for consumers losing in the\nexperiment on day one, but lower overall. This could indicate that winners record\nrelatively more small value transactions as the diary progresses than losers. However,\n17 Small value transactions (below 5 euros) are in essence a subgroup of cash transactions, because almost\nall those transactions are conducted in cash (see Bagnall, 2015, and Deutsche Bundesbank, 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       dZ\nZ Z \nthe differences between winners and losers are insignificant overall and on all individual\ndays.\nFigure 4 - Share of small value transactions (below 5 euro) per person per day\nNotes: Calculated for individuals with more than zero transactions on given day.\n*, **, *** mean difference significant at the 90%, 95% or 99% level (two-sided t-test).\nA third related way to describe the structure of transactions is by the average amount\nspent per transaction (see Table A15 in the Appendix). One can see that the average\ntransaction size is slightly higher on the first three days and the last day of the diary\nperiod than on days four to six. However, none of the differences between days is\nsignificant \u00ad neither for winners, nor for losers, nor for both groups combined. In\naddition, the differences in average transaction size between winners and losers are\ninsignificant for each diary day and for all days taken together. This is evidence that the\nhigher number of transactions reported on the first days of the diary do not induce a bias\non the results. In other words, should participants report transactions from before the\ndiary period on the first diary day, those transactions do have a similar structure as the\n\"real\" transactions. In addition, one does not find a significant under-reporting of small\nvalue transactions as the diary period progresses.\n4.3 Final cash balance\nIdeally we would be able to compare the recorded pattern of payments with the actual\npayment pattern and calculate the measurement error directly. This is of course not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       dZ\nZ Z \npossible. We can make use of a specific feature of the diary, however. The diary asks\nrespondents to open their wallet and count the amount of cash in their wallet before they\nmake the first transaction in the diary period. They then record all their (cash) purchases\nand cash withdrawals for the diary period and are again asked to count the money in\ntheir wallet at the end of the diary period. Using the information on the initial cash\nbalance and cash purchases and withdrawals we can calculate each consumer's \"cash\nflow\" and in particular their \"hypothetical\" cash balance at the end of the diary period.\nThe latter can then be compared to the balance they reported after counting the money\nin their wallet. We assume the final cash balance reported to be of good enough quality\nto be used as a benchmark and interpret deviations between the two measures to be\nrelated to an over- or underreporting of cash withdrawals and cash purchases rather than\nmeasurement error on the cash balance reported at the beginning of the diary.18 We\ncalculate both the difference between the hypothetical cash balance and the actual as\nwell as the absolute value of the difference. Table 3 shows some descriptive statistics\nand Figure 5 shows the distribution for winners and losers.\nTable 3 - Descriptive statistics of the actual difference in cash balances and the\nabsolute value of the difference in cash balances, in euro\nDifference in cash balances Absolute difference cash balances\nLosers Winners Losers Winners\nStandard\ndeviation\nWe first test whether the differences in the cash balances of winners and losers come\nfrom the same distribution. A simple t-test reveals that there are no significant\ndifferences between the mean difference in cash balances between winners and losers.\nFurthermore, we cannot reject that the two samples have the same median and variance.\nThe hypothesis that the two samples come from the same distribution cannot be rejected\nwhen the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test is performed. All tests performed show the\n18 Differences between actual and hypothetical cash balances can also occur due to missing values. When\nrespondents do not report the payment instrument they used or the amount they paid, the transaction is\ndisregarded in the calculation of the hypothetical cash balance.\nsame qualitative results both for the difference in cash balances and its absolute value.\nIn sum, there appear to be no differences between winners and losers with respect to this\nindicator of data quality.\nFigure 5 - Kernel density estimation of the difference between \"hypothetical\" and\nreported cash balances at the end of the diary period, in euro cents\n4.4 Incomplete transaction data\nIn the previous sections we have looked at item non-response with respect to completely\nmissing transactions. In this section we focus on the classic item non-response\nmeasures, i.e. missing information on recorded transactions. In the payment diary\nrespondents were asked to answer several questions concerning each single transaction.\nBesides the amount, the payment instrument used and the location where the transaction\ntook place, respondents were also asked about various circumstances that might have\ninfluenced their payment choice. Up to eight variables pertain to one transaction. Giving\nall the requested information requires reading the diary carefully and remembering the\ntransaction precisely. This can be burdensome for respondents.\nDensity\nDifference between \"hypothetical\" and reported cash balances\nWinners\nLosers\nKernel density estimate\nFigure 6 - Share of incomplete transactions per person per day\nNotes: *, **, *** mean difference is significant at the 90%, 95%, or 99% level (two-\nsided t-test).\nFigure 6 and Table A16 in the Appendix show that the share of incomplete transactions\nis around 35% on average. There are slightly fewer incomplete transactions for winners\nthan for losers. The shares of incomplete transactions do not differ significantly overall\nor for any of the individual days of the diary.\nFigure 6 also shows that both winners and losers report more incomplete transactions as\nthe diary week progresses. Pairwise t-tests on the shares of incomplete transactions on\nthe first and second day compared to all other days of the diary show significant\ndifferences (results not reported).\nReporting precise amounts in the diary can be a burden for consumers. They have to\nremember the exact amount or keep the receipt, for example. Thus, many people round\nthe reported transaction values in the payment diaries. In the 2014 Bundesbank payment\ndiary, we see that on average about one quarter (28%) of all transactions per person per\nday are rounded.19 Figure 7 and Table 17 in the Appendix show that this rate is only\nmarginally higher for consumers who win the 20 euro. Consumers winning and those\nlosing in the experiment both show increasing rates of rounded values as the diary\nprogresses, under-scoring the value of this measure as a quality indicator.20 Overall the\n19 Rounding is defined here as rounding to full euro amounts.\n20 T-tests of the differences between day one and the other days produce significant results for some of\nthe days. However, one has to keep in mind that only the shares of rounded values of those respondents\nwho report transactions on both days of the comparison can be included in the calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       dZ\nZ Z \ndifference between the two groups with respect to rounded values is not significant,\nwith the exception of day 5.\nFigure 7 - Share of rounded transaction values per person per day\nNotes: *, **, *** mean difference is significant at the 90%, 95%, or 99% level (two-\nsided t-test)\n4.6 Robustness Checks\nAs Table A1 shows, there are no significant differences in socio-demographics between\nwinners and losers in the experiment. We therefore assumed throughout this paper that\ndifferences between winners and losers in the quality indicators are not driven by socio-\ndemographic factors, but by the random outcome of the role of the die. In order to make\nthis assumption more robust, we run a series of regressions with our quality indicators\nas dependent variable, the outcome of the role of the die (winner or loser) as\nindependent variable and various socio-demographics as control variables. We find that\nbeing a winner does not have a significant effect on any of the quality measures (see\nTable 4 and Table 18 in the Appendix). This indicates that the higher quantity of\ntransactions reported on the first days does not affect qualitative aspects of the results,\nsuch as the share of cash transactions, the share of small transactions, the average\ntransaction amount, the share of transactions with incomplete transaction information\nand the share of rounded transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       dZ\nZ Z \n\nTable 4 - Results of estimations on various measures of data quality\n(I) (II) (III) (IV) (V)\nShare of\ncash TA\nShare of\nsmall TA\nAverage TA\namount\nShare of\nincomplete\nTA\nShare of\nrounded TA\nControl\nVariables\nIncluded (see Table A18 and A19 for results and definitions)\nNotes: *, **, *** mean coefficient is significant at the 90%, 95% or 99% level.

TA is transactions.\n5 Conclusions\nIn this paper we analyse the effect of an experiment performed as part of a\nrepresentative national survey on participants' recording behaviour in a subsequent one-\nweek payment diary. In the experiment participants rolled a die and had the chance to\nwin 20 euro depending on the number on the die. We interpret this as a random\nassignment of a monetary incentive, where in contrast to most other incentive\nexperiments the person receiving the incentive (winners) knows that they received a\nhigher incentive than some of the other participants. The experiment itself could thus\nstimulate positive feelings in winners and negative feelings in losers towards the survey\nand the diary in general. Consequently, we expect winners to report higher quality data\nin the diary than losers. On the downside, winning the money could lead to survey\nexuberance, i.e. inducing respondents to report transactions that did not actually take\nplace or took place before the diary started.\nWe measure data quality with several indicators: the number of transactions recorded,\nthe share of cash transactions, the share of low value transactions (below 5 euro), the\nshare of rounded transactions values, the share of transactions with incomplete\ninformation and the concordance of hypothetical and actual cash balances at the end of\nthe diary week. We find that the experiment seems to have some impact on consumers'\ncommitment to the survey diary. The impact on data quality and on the key qualitative\nresults is rather limited, however. Results show that winners report significantly more\ntransactions than losers, in particular on the first, second and last day of the diary. More\nspecifically, there are fewer diaries without any transactions on the first or the second\nday for winners. We can rule out that the larger number of transactions recorded on the\nfirst days is due to an income effect induced by winning 20 euro. Neither of the other\nquality measures differs significantly between winners and losers. Furthermore the low\nvariation between the two groups of the cash share and the share of small value\ntransactions indicate that important findings from the diary, such as the overall cash\nshare of point-of-sale transactions and the share of transactions within certain value\nranges, are not biased by the outcome of the experiment.\nWe find evidence that some indicators of data quality deteriorate as the diary week\nprogresses. On the first and second day, respondents round less and report more\ncomplete transactions.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to look into the effects of behavioural or\npsychological experiments with monetary rewards carried out during a representative\nnational survey. Including experiments in such surveys is a rather new and promising\napproach, considering that previously behavioural experiments were often carried out\nwith a non-representative part of the population (e.g. students). However, up to now\nlittle is known on how such experiments influence participants' attitude towards the\nsurvey to which the experiment is linked. Our research indicates that including an\nexperiment does not affect the survey's data quality negatively.\nWe were mainly concerned with the incentive effects of the experiment, both monetary\nand non-monetary. Whether other features of the experiment also play a role for\nrespondents' reporting behaviour is still an open issue. It is feasible to assume that the\ndesign and administration of the experiment by the interviewers could potentially\nconfound and even counteract the incentive effects. More research on these issues is\nnecessary.\nReferences\nAxhausen, K. W., A. Zimmermann, S. Sch\u00f6nfelder, G. Rindsf\u00fcser, and T. Haupt\n(2002).
