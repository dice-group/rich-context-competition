    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common complication in most malignancies. Despite its frequent occurrence,\ncurrent knowledge of MPE remains limited and the effect of the management is still unsatisfying. Traditional Chinese medicine\n(TCM) external treatment has unique advantages, such as quicker efficacy and fewer side effects. Objective. To observe the effects\nand safety of Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment (TCM herbal ointment) in MPE. Design. This was a placebo-controlled double-blinded\nrandomized study. A total of 80 patients were enrolled, of which 72 were randomized to receive Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment or\nplacebo at an allocation ratio of 1:1. Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment or placebo was applied on the thorax wall for 8 hours daily. The\nintervention lasted 2 weeks. Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment consisted of Astragalus membranaces , Semen pharbitidis \n, Cassia twig , Pericarpium arecae , Curcuma zedoary , Borneol ), and other substances.\nIn both groups, diuresis and drainages were used as needed. Outcomes covered the quantity of pleural effusion evaluation, TCM\nSymptom Scale, Karnofsky Performance Scale, and safety indicators such as routine blood test, blood biochemistry test, and\nresponse table of skin irritation. Results. Of 72 patients randomized to receive Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment or placebo along with\nsymptomatic treatment, the response rate was documented as 42.4% for the treatment group and 25.0% for the placebo group\n(P = .138). As for the TCM symptom scale, the treatment group showed improvement in chest distress (P = .003), fullness and\ndistention (P = .042), shortness of breath (P < .001), no statistical significance in palpitation (P = .237), and pain (P = .063), whereas\nthe placebo group did not show statistical significance in any of the 5 symptoms. Major adverse events related to the treatment,\nmainly skin irritation, were distributed equally. Conclusions. Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment showed a potential of reducing MPE, and\nit could alleviate symptoms of dyspnea. Thus, it may be appropriate as a supplementary intervention for MPE. There were some\nflaws in the study design. A larger scale and better designed trial is advocated.\n",

Despite\ngreat advances in cancer treatment in the past decades, man-\nagement for MPE remains palliative. The usual treatment\noptions are (a) observation while awaiting treatment response\nto underlying malignancy, (b) repeated thoracentesis, (c)\npleurodesis, (d) indwelling pleural catheter placement, and (e)\npalliation of symptoms with opioids and oxygen in terminal\npatients.1-5 The therapeutic goals of MPE treatment should not\nonly be fluid removal but also symptom relief (especially\nfrom breathlessness), improvement in QoL, and maximizing\ntime outside of hospital.5 Because most procedures are con-\nfined by limitations and complications, strategies for MPE\nmanagement should be made with deliberation.\nExternal treatment is an important technique with a long\nhistory and extensive application in broad disciplines in tradi-\ntional Chinese medicine (TCM). It has been applied in MPE\nand other complications of malignancies for several years.6-13\nIn the past decade, TCM external treatment has been success-\nfully used in malignancy complications in our clinical practice.\nMeanwhile, studies of external treatment for cancer complica-\ntions showed promising outcomes.14-17 Some studies showed\nthat Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment, a TCM herbal ointment of\nexternal treatment, had some effect on decreasing MPE.16,17\nThe aim of this study was to observe the effect of Kang'ai\nXiaoshui ointment on MPE, in the hope that it could provide\nsome higher level evidence for external treatment in MPE.\nMethods\nDesign\nThis study was a multicenter, parallel, double-blinded, ran-\ndomized, placebo-controlled trial. It was aimed to observe\nthe safety and efficacy of Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment, a\nTCM herbal ointment for external treatment on MPE.\nEthics\nThe trial was performed with the approval of the Ethics\nCommittee of China-Japan Friendship Hospital for Drug/\nsigned an informed consent form before randomization and\ntreatment.\nParticipants\nA total of 80 patients were enrolled, of which 72 were ran-\ndomized to receive Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment or placebo\nin an allocation ratio of 1:1.\nEligible patients had to meet the following inclusion cri-\nteria: (a) patients with malignant tumor confirmed by\npathology or cytology; (b) patients with pleural effusion\ndetected by sonogram or X-ray; (c) cancer cells can be\nfound from subjects' pleural effusion sample or subjects\ndiagnosed with pleural metastasis; (d) no history of intra-\nperitoneal chemotherapy and/or intraperitoneal immuno-\ntherapy within 3 weeks; (e) no severe dysfunction of heart,\nliver, or kidney; (f) age 18 to 80 years; (g) patients are able\nto participate in study procedures and QoL evaluations; and\n(h) patients understand and agree to receive the treatment,\nand sign information consent form.\nExclusion criteria were the following: (a) patients with\nskin ulceration or severe hypersusceptibility and (b) patients\nundergoing radiotherapy/chemotherapy or had radiother-\napy/chemotherapy within 1 month.\nThe subjects were enrolled from 1 of the following 3\ncenters: China-Japan Friendship Hospital (Center 1),\nBeijing University of Chinese Medicine Third Affiliated\nHospital (Center 2), and Beijing Hospital of Traditional\nChinese Medicine (Center 3).\nOutcomes and Response Assessment\nPrimary outcome was the quantity of pleural effusion evalua-\ntion, which was assessed by imagological examination (sono-\ngram or X-ray).18,19 The other primary outcome was TCM\nSymptom Scale20 (Supplementary Table 1, available online at\nhttp://ict.sagepub.com/}supplemental). Secondary outcomes\nwere drainage quantity of pleural effusion/body surface and\nKarnofsky Performance Scale (KPS). There were safety indi-\ncators such as routine blood tests, blood biochemistry test, and\nresponse table of skin irritation. All indicators were evaluated\nbefore enrollment and weekly after randomization.According\nto maximum of effusion depth, our rating scale defined depth\nless than 5 cm as Small, 5 cm to 10 cm as Moderate, more\nthan 10 cm as Large. Complete response (CR) was defined as\nplural effusion having disappeared and symptoms relieved\ncompletely. Partial response (PR) was defined as plural effu-\nsion having decreased more than 1 grade and symptoms\napparently relieved. No change (NC) was defined as no plural\neffusion decrease and no relief of symptoms. Response was\ndefined as CR + PR.\nIntervention\nKang'ai Xiaoshui ointment or placebo 10 g was applied on the\nlateral thorax wall of the effusion side and covered with dress-\ning for 8 hours daily. In both groups, diuresis and drainage\nwere used as needed.The intervention lasted 2 weeks. Kang'ai\nXiaoshui ointment is a hospital preparation of China-Japan\nFriendship Hospital. The formula consisted of Astragalus\nmembranaces , Semen pharbitidis ,\nCassia twig , Pericarpium arecae ,\nCurcuma zedoary , Borneol ), and other\nsubstances. The placebo composition was starch and pigmen-\ntum. It was prepared by the Pharmaceutical Department of\nChina-Japan Friendship Hospital, as was the placebo. The\nointment and placebo were packed in sealed identical bottles\nthat contained a supply for about 1 week. The patients were\nrandomized to begin therapy after the enrollment and baseline\nassessment and after signing the consent form.\nRandomization and Blinding\nRandomization was used to allocate patients 1:1 to each treat-\nment arm. It was stratified with centers, and with block size of\n6. Randomization was made with SAS 9.1.3. Labels with con-\ntinuous code, which represented randomization and interven-\ntion arms, were pasted on the corresponding bottles. Every\ncode had 3 copies of the label pasted on the corresponding\nbottles. The randomization and codes were kept by an inde-\npendent personnel blinded to the patients and researchers.\nSample Size Considerations\nThe sample size calculations were based on the results of\nprevious studies. We assumed that the effect rate of Kang'ai\nXiaoshui ointment was 60%, while that of placebo was\nparticipants in each arm. Considering 20% as the noncom-\npletion rate, the sample size was 35 for each arm.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used 2-sample t tests or the Wilcoxon test for continuous\nvariables and 2 or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.All tests\nwere with a .05 significance level. Statistical analyses were\ndone using SAS software version 9.1.3. A third party\n(Guoxinzeding International Medical Technology Co,\nBeijing, China) did the statistical analysis independently.\nResults\nA total of 72 patients with malignancies were randomized.\nThirty-seven patients were male. The mean age of the patients\n2 groups were well matched for baseline characteristics (Table\n1). All patients stayed in the same group as assigned. Of these,\n65 were eligible for analysis, 33 of the treatment group and 32\nof the placebo group, as shown in the flow diagram in Figure 1.\nOf the 7 cases of noncompletion, 4 were lost to follow-up. Two\nceased due to adverse events, and 1 patient declined the inter-\nvention and requested chemotherapy (Supplementary Table 2,\navailable online at http://ict.sagepub.com/supplemental).\nTreatment Outcomes\nOf the 72 patients randomized to receive TCM herbal ointment\nor placebo along with supportive treatment, 65 were eligible\nfor analysis. Twenty-two were reported as PR, 43 were NC,\nwith no CR was reported. The response rate was documented\nand 25.0% (8/32) in those receiving placebo. There was a trend\nthat the treatment group was more effective than the placebo\nTable 1.

However, in relieving symptoms of chest distress,\nfullness and distention, and shortness of breath, the treatment\ngroup showed statistical significance, while the placebo group\nshowed no significant differences in any of the 5 symptoms.\nSymptoms of heart palpitation and pain in the treatment group\nshowed no statistical significance (Table 3). No thoracentesis/\ndrainage was conducted throughout the treatment. In the treat-\nment group, mean KPS was 69.4 and the median was 70 at\nbaseline. In the last interview, the mean KPS was 71.9 and the\nmedian was 70. There was no statistical significance of KPS\nwithin the treatment group (P = .277). In placebo group, the\n70. There was no statistical significance (P = .599).\nFigure 1. Flow Diagram of Enrollment.\nTable 2.

There was no severeAE. The comparison ofAEs in\nthe 2 groups had no statistical significance (12 vs 12, P =\n.723). Of all AEs, 9 were considered as related or possibly\nrelated to intervention (4 in the treatment group, 5 in the pla-\ncebo group), most of which were skin irritation or allergy.\nTwo cases led to ceasing the intervention, while the other 7\nwere merely mild skin reactions. The incidence of interven-\nBlood routine and biochemical tests showed no statisti-\ncally significant differences in both groups.\nDiscussion\nMalignant pleural effusion, as a common complication for\nmalignancies, portends a poor prognosis and affects\npatients' QoL.3,4 The therapeutic goals of MPE treatment\nshould take fluid removal and symptom relief into account.\nDespite great advances in cancer treatment, management\nfor MPE remains palliative.1-5\nRestricted by complications and some other factors, the\nmanagement for MPE remains intractable.\nThis randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-\ncontrolled study was performed to investigate the efficacy\nof Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment, a TCM herbal ointment for\nexternal treatment, in dealing with MPE. It was planned to\nprovide some high level of evidence. However, the effect on\neffusion volume showed no statistical significance between\nthe treatment group and the placebo group, which was not\nin accordance with the results of previous studies.16,17 After\nwe reviewed the design and process, we found some flaws\nin the study that might lead to a negative outcome. However,\nwe still consider this study as a meaningful one. So we will\npay some attention to discussing those flaws in hopes of\nhelping formulate a better design.\nThe response rate was documented as 42.4% in the treat-\nment group versus 25.0% in the placebo group, which showed\nno statistical significance (P = .138). Most probably, this lack\nof statistical significance is caused by a too small sample size\n(36 for each arm), as we were overly optimistic in evaluating\nthe effect of the ointment observed in a pilot trial17 for sample\nsize calculation. If we take the data of this study to recalculate\nsample size, the result will be as follows: set  = 0.05, 1 -  =\nFortunately, there was no thoracentesis and drainage\nduring the study. In this study, thoracentesis or drainage\nwould be a confounding factor that severely influenced the\nresponse, but it was allowed by the protocol, which was a\nflaw in the study design. To eliminate the confounding, sub-\njects who need thoracentesis or drainage should be excluded.\nTable 3.

Comparison in group: Wilcoxon signed rank test.\nThe protocol allowed using either X-ray or sonogram to\nevaluate the effusion amount. However, there was no con-\nsensus on pleural effusion grading of sonograms. Based on\nclinical experience and feasibility, a grading criterion was\ndiscussed and agreed through a Delphi method by the chiefs\nof Ultrasonography Departments of all enrollment centers.\nAccording to maximum of effusion depth, the grading crite-\nrion defined depth less than 5 cm as Small, 5 cm to 10 cm as\nModerate, and more than 10 cm as Large.\nIn this study, the results of evaluation such as CR, PR, or\nNC were based on the grading criterion mentioned above.\nThis criterion was different from the criterion that is usually\nused in other studies, and had not been validated. Moreover,\nthe observation period in this study was 14 days, shorter than\nother studies. Therefore, effect of a longer treatment period\nremains to be seen. Furthermore, since the treatment goal for\nMPE includes improvement in QoL and maximizing time\noutside of hospital, it seems to be more valuable for a future\nstudy to observe the duration of effusion decrease, times and\ndrainage or thoracentesis in a certain span of time.\nAs TCM naturally concerns patients'subjective feelings, we\ndesigned the TCM Symptom Scale. However, the validity of\nthe scale might be weakened. For example, chest distress, full-\nness and distention, and shortness of breath are 3 TCM symp-\ntoms that describe dyspnea from different aspects. They may\nhelp TCM doctors with syndrome differentiation and treatment\ndecision. As there was no TCM syndrome differentiation\ninvolved, the 3 symptoms could be replaced by dyspnea.\nOtherwise, patients would be confused. We intended to observe\npalpitation and pain that was caused by effusion, but confound-\ning of heart disease and cancer pain could not be ruled out.\nIn consideration of this add-on study design, it would be\nbetter to record the disease condition of cancer, which might\nhelp identify confounding caused by cancer remission.\nConclusion\nKang'ai Xiaoshui ointment showed a potential for reducing\nMPE and could alleviate symptoms of dyspnea. Thus, it\nmay be appropriate as a supplementary intervention for\nMPE. There were some flaws in the study design. A larger\nscale and better designed trial is advocated.\nAuthors' Note\nWu Feize and Liu Meng are co\u00adfirst authors.
