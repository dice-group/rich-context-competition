Thus, evolutionary psychologists have proposed that women\nhave evolved a preference for men who show signs of not just an ability to invest in offspring,\nbut also a willingness to invest in offspring (Buss, 1989; La Cerra, 1995). Various investigations\nhave provided support for this proposal. For example, Kenrick, Sadalla, Groth, and Trost (1990)\nfound a sex difference in mate preferences concerning family orientation (wants children, is kind\nand understanding) at increasingly committed levels of relationship involvement.\nIn her dissertation, La Cerra (1995) used photographs of the opposite sex in various\ncontexts to test the proposition that women have an evolved preference for men who show signs\nof a willingness to invest in offspring. Using within-subjects, Latin-square designs, La Cerra\nWomen More Than Men Attend to Indicators of Good Character\nexposed men and women to pictures of same-sex and opposite-sex models in a variety of\nconditions. She found support for a domain-specific capacity in women to assess and respond\npositively to indicators of a man's willingness to invest in offspring. First, La Cerra\ndemonstrated that women responded more positively to a man interacting with a happy baby than\nto a man standing alone, and more negatively to a man ignoring an unhappy baby than to a man\nstanding alone. Further, La Cerra demonstrated that (1) the effects were unique to women's\nratings of men (they did not replicate with men's ratings of women); (2) the effects were specific\nto the mating domain (they did not appear when evaluating an opposite-sex person as a friend or\nneighbor, nor did they appear in evaluations of same-sex individuals as a friend or neighbor); (3)\nthe positive effect of seeing a man interact with a baby was not a product of a general preference\nfor \"domesticity\" (women rated a man vacuuming as even less attractive than a man standing\nalone); and (4) the positive effect of seeing a man interact with a baby was not a product of a\nmore general sensitivity to demonstrations of compassion (women rated a man interacting with\nthe baby as more attractive than they rated a man engaged in caretaking of an elderly person).\nLa Cerra's (1995) findings were never published in a peer-reviewed outlet; thus, although\nwell-known among evolutionary researchers, her findings on the domain-specific nature of\nevaluations of parental investment cues beg replication and extension. In fact, in two recent\nstudies, Brase (2006) found substantially less support than she did for a domain-specific capacity\nin women to assess men's willingness to invest. Although women in Brase's studies responded\npositively to pictures of men interacting with a baby, their positive reaction was not limited to\nthe mating context (it occurred when they evaluated men as potential friends and neighbors, as\nwell); moreover, the women responded just as positively to pictures of men showing compassion\nto an elderly person as they did to pictures of men interacting with a happy baby. Brase's\nfindings did document some differential sensitivity of women in assessing behavioral cues, with\nthe result that there are now contrasting findings in the literature.\nThe current studies were undertaken to test further the proposition that females have a\ndomain-specific capacity to assess men's willingness to invest in offspring. We extended\nprevious research by (1) using pre-rated models of varied attractiveness levels and (2) utilizing a\nmore conservative, between-subjects design. In addition, in our second study, we (3) designed\nnew dependent measures and (4) tested the moderating effects of individuals' sociosexuality and\nbeliefs about sex-role equality on ratings of models' attractiveness in the varied contexts.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 46 male and 57 female undergraduates at a regional public institution\nparticipated in Study 1. The students ranged from 18 to 47 years of age, with only one participant\n3.97). Some students participated in partial fulfillment of course credit.\nMaterials and Procedure\nWomen More Than Men Attend to Indicators of Good Character\nHalf-body (torso and up) shots of the adults used as targets in Study 1 were pre-rated by\n20 opposite sex judges as similarly, slightly attractive (male M = 1.81, female M = 1.93; scale\nranged from 1 to 5, and neither target received a rating of 4 or 5). As displayed in Figure 1,\ntargets were photographed in each of two contexts: interacting with a happy baby and ignoring a\nbaby in distress.\nFigure 1. Study 1 stimuli.\nStudy 1 was a 2 x 2 between-subjects design with baby context (interacting or ignoring)\nas the independent variable and sex of participant (male or female) as the subject variable.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to condition, and viewed a color picture of the opposite sex\nin one of the two baby contexts. Upon receiving the questionnaire, participants viewed the\npicture of the target. Then, similar to that done by La Cerra (1995), participants turned to the\nnext page and used a 7-point scale to rate how physically and sexually attractive they found the\nperson in the photograph to be as a neighbor, friend, short-term sex partner, long-term\nrelationship partner, and marriage partner (1 = Very Unattractive, to 7 = Very Attractive). Next,\nparticipants used a 5-point scale to rate their perceptions of how honest, kind, loyal, agreeable,\nand loving the target was (1 = Not At All, to 5 = Extremely). Participants were debriefed in\nwriting upon their completion of the questionnaire. The entire procedure took approximately five\nminutes.\nWomen More Than Men Attend to Indicators of Good Character\nResults\nBecause participants' evaluations of the target as a long-term dating partner and marriage\npartner were largely overlapping (Cronbach's ! = .95), these evaluations were averaged into one\nlong-term partner score. Participants' evaluations of the target's personality traits were also\nhighly reliable (! = .93) and thus averaged into one personality score. A significance level of .05\nwas adopted for all tests reported below.\nParticipant age was not related to attractiveness ratings (all ps > .36). Overall, across\nevaluation contexts (long-term romantic partner, short-term sex partner, friend, neighbor) and\nbaby contexts (interacting, ignoring), men and women gave similar ratings of the target's\n1.45; ! = .96). Across evaluation contexts and participant sex, participants who viewed the target\ninteracting with a happy baby gave higher attractiveness ratings than did those who viewed the\nEffects of Sex and Context on Ratings of Target's Attractiveness\nFigure 2 displays the effects of picture context on men's and women's ratings of the\ntarget's attractiveness as a long-term romantic partner (top left panel), short-term sex partner (top\nright), friend (bottom left), and neighbor (bottom right).\nAttractiveness as a long-term romantic partner.\nFirst, two-way analyses of variance revealed a strong main effect of picture condition:\nParticipants who viewed the target ignoring the baby rated the target as less attractive than did\np < .001.

As displayed in the bottom right panel of Figure 2, the\nnegative effect of ignoring a baby was similar in magnitude for the two sexes.\nEffects of Sex and Context on Ratings of Target's Personality\nThe pattern for participants' ratings of the target's personality was similar to that found\nfor ratings of the target's attractiveness. First, a two-way analysis of variance revealed a\nsignificant main effect of the manipulation on ratings of the target's personality, F(1, 99) =\noverall than was the target who interacted with the baby. Second, across picture conditions,\nmen's and women's ratings of the target's personality did not differ, F(1, 99) = 2.98, p = .09.\nThird, participant sex and baby context interacted to affect ratings, F(1, 99) = 7.63, partial \"2 =\n.07, p < .01. Men who viewed the target ignoring the baby rated the target less positively (M =\n2.89, SD = .81) than did men who viewed the target interacting with the baby (M = 3.68, SD =\n.71). Men and women responded similarly to the target who was interacting with the baby, t(51)\n= -.82 p = .42, whereas men rated the ignoring baby target more positively than women did, t(48)\nDiscussion\nConsistent with the hypothesis that women have an evolved sensitivity to cues of a man's\nwillingness to invest in offspring, women's judgments of a man's attractiveness as a long-term\npartner were negatively affected by seeing him ignore a baby in distress. However, our findings\nsuggest less domain-specificity in women's sensitivity than reported previously (La Cerra,\n1995). Women's attractiveness ratings were affected not only in the long-term mating evaluation,\nbut also in the short-term mating and non-mating (i.e., friend and neighbor) evaluation domains.\nGiven the logic of parental investment theory, it is not surprising that women's ratings of a\nman's long-term attractiveness were negatively affected by seeing him ignore a baby in distress.\nPerhaps somewhat surprising is that their ratings of a man's short-term sexual attractiveness\nWomen More Than Men Attend to Indicators of Good Character\nwere also negatively affected. After all, men chosen as short-term partners are not expected to\ninvest on a prolonged basis, particularly in offspring. However, some research suggests that\nengaging in short-term mating often functions as a strategy for acquiring a long-term mate\n(Greiling and Buss, 2000); thus, the two mating domains are likely not independent of each other\nin the female mind.\nIn further contrast to La Cerra's findings, men's ratings of the target's long-term\nattractiveness also were significantly affected by picture condition. On one hand, because women\nhave parental certainty, they might invest reliably in offspring and, as such, one might not expect\nthere to have been selection pressure for men to have evolved to be sensitive to behavioral cues\nregarding women's willingness to parentally invest. On the other hand, women's degree of\nnurturance and devotion to their offspring varies tremendously, and if such variation historically\nwas related to differential child outcomes, then men may have evolved to be sensitive to\nbehavioral cues regarding women's willingness to care for children. Although our effect sizes\nsuggest that men were not as strongly affected as women were by viewing a target ignore a baby\nin distress, the finding warrants discussion and attempted replication.\nImportantly, men's ratings of a woman's short-term sexual attractiveness were not at all\naffected by context in the evaluation of the target's attractiveness as a short-term sex partner.\nThis non-finding accords with past research showing that men's standards for various\ncharacteristics such as kindness and intelligence drop in the selection of a sex partner (Kenrick,\nIntroduction\nIn Study 1, extended previous research by using a conservative, between-subjects design.\nHowever, we lacked a direct test of the possibility that women may respond positively to the\nmale interacting with the baby because women have a general preference for men who are\n\"domestic\" or helpful around the house. In Study 2, we tested this possibility by creating a third\ncondition in which the participant was pictured alone vacuuming.\nStudy 1 also lacked a measure of individual differences in sexual strategy, or sociosexual\norientation. We hypothesized that within each sex, a more restricted sexual strategy (being\noriented toward long-term, committed mateships) would be associated with a greater sensitivity\nto the effect of interacting vs. ignoring a baby, and that a more unrestricted sexual strategy would\nbe associated with a lower sensitivity. In Study 2, then, we included the Sociosexual Orientation\nInventory (SOI; Simpson and Gangestad, 1991) as a measure of sociosexuality.\nOne might suggest that women's strong negative reaction to a man ignoring a baby is the\nproduct of traditional sex-role socialization processes that instruct women to find a man who will\nbe a good father. This explanation, however, needs to be unpacked in order to be tested. First, we\nassume that being a `good father' means more than just providing resources; it also means being\nwilling to contribute time and energy directly to the care and instruction of one's children. Under\nthis assumption, it is just as likely that men are socialized to find a woman who will be a good\nmother as it is that women are socialized to find a man who will be a good father. Second,\nindividuals who hold traditional views about sex roles tend to agree with statements that\nemphasize the importance of the wife rather than the husband handling the children and\nhousework. Thus, one might predict that holding traditional views about the sexes is associated\nWomen More Than Men Attend to Indicators of Good Character\nwith less sensitivity to males' behavior with a baby. Individuals with sex-egalitarian views, on\nthe other hand, tend to agree with statements that characterize both female and male as\ncaregivers; one could argue that women's sensitivity to cues of a man's willingness to invest is\nthe result of being socialized according to modern sex-egalitarian ideals. If that is the case, then\nwomen who score higher in sex-role egalitarianism (i.e., lower in traditional sex-role\nidentification) should be more susceptible to the negative effect of images of a male ignoring a\nbaby. In Study 2, we included a measure of sex-role beliefs to determine whether they were\nrelated in any way to the negative effect of ignoring a baby on people's perceptions of the target.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 70 male and 115 female undergraduates from two regional public institutions\nparticipated. The participants ranged from 18 to 49 years of age, with only one participant over\nstudents participated in partial fulfillment of course credit.\nMaterials and Procedure\nThe method of creating stimuli and collecting data for Study 2 was the same as for Study\n1. The adult targets used in Study 2 were both pre-rated by 15 opposite sex judges as moderately\nattractive (male M = 6.46, female M = 5.60; scale ranged from 1 to 9, and neither target received\na score below 4), although the male was pre-rated as more attractive than was the female, t(34) =\n-2.61, p < .05. In addition, the male and female targets were pre-rated as similar in age (male M\n= 22.60 yrs, female M = 22.90 yrs). As displayed in Figure 3, male and female targets were\nphotographed while interacting with a happy baby and ignoring a baby in distress. Targets were\nalso photographed in a third context, vacuuming alone (the \"domestic\" condition).\nStudy 2 was a 3 x 2 between-subjects design with picture context (interacting, ignoring,\nor being domestic) as the independent variable and sex of the participant as the subject variable.\nEach participant was randomly assigned to one of the three picture conditions. First, participants\nviewed a color picture of the opposite sex target in one of the three conditions. Then, participants\nturned to the next page and used a 7-point scale (1 = Disagree Strongly, to 7 = Agree Strongly) to\nindicate their agreement with five statements about their attraction to the person in the\nphotograph as a sex partner (e.g., \"This man[woman] is sexually attractive,\" \"I am sexually\nattracted to this man [woman],\" \"I would be willing to have sex with this man [woman]; ! = .93),\nand three statements about their attraction to the person as a long-term relationship partner (e.g.,\n\"This man [woman] would be a desirable marriage partner,\" \"I would be willing to develop a\nlong-term romantic relationship with this man [woman];\" ! = .89). We generated these items in\nan attempt to more closely parallel the thoughts someone might entertain when viewing a\nmember of the opposite sex. Rating the target's sexual attractiveness as a potential neighbor, for\nexample, as conducted in Study 1 and in previous research, seemed awkward. Scores on the\nsexual attraction and long-term relationship composite variables were moderately correlated (p <\nNext, participants used a 5-point scale to rate their perceptions of how honest, kind, loyal,\nagreeable, loving, and motherly/fatherly the target was (! = .92; 1 = Not At All, to 5 =\nWomen More Than Men Attend to Indicators of Good Character\nExtremely). Finally, participants completed the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI;\nSimpson and Gangestad, 1991) and the Larsen and Long Sex Role Egalitarianism Scale (Larsen\nand Long, 1988; ! = .80). Participants were debriefed in writing upon their completion of the\nquestionnaire. The entire procedure took approximately 15 minutes.\nFigure 3. Study 2 stimuli.\nResults\nParticipant age was not related to sociosexual orientation (p = .18), nor to attractiveness\nratings (all ps > .20). Overall, across evaluation contexts (long-term relationship attraction,\nsexual attraction) and baby contexts (interacting, domestic, and ignoring), men reported more\n1.20; female M = 3.69, SD = 1.28). Across evaluation contexts and sex, participants who viewed\nthe target ignoring the baby reported lower levels of attraction to the target (M = 3.41, SD = 1.34)\nthan did either those who viewed the target interacting with the baby (M = 4.35, SD = 1.30, p <\ntwo groups did not differ from each other.\nEffects of Sex and Context on Attraction to Target\nWomen More Than Men Attend to Indicators of Good Character\nFigure 4 displays the effects of picture context on men's and women's ratings of long-\nterm relationship attraction (left panel) and sexual attraction (right panel) to target. For ratings of\nlong-term relationship attraction, a two-way analysis of variance revealed a strong main effect of\nignoring the baby reported less long-term relationship attraction (M = 3.11, SD = 1.33) than did\neither those who viewed the target interacting with the baby (M = 4.20, SD = 1.44, p < .001) or\nthose who viewed the target being domestic (M = 4.01, SD = 1.08, p < .001); the latter two\ngroups did not differ from each other. The analysis also revealed a significant interaction\nFigure 4, no pair-wise mean comparisons for men were significant; however, women who\nviewed the target ignoring the baby reported lower levels of long-term relationship attraction\nthan did either those who viewed the target interacting with the baby (p < .001) or those who\nviewed the target being domestic (p < .001). Women who viewed the man interacting with the\nbaby did not report more long-term attraction relative to those who viewed him vacuuming.\nFor ratings of sexual attraction, a two-way analysis of variance revealed a strong main\n4.81, SD = 1.32) reported more sexual attraction to the target than did women (M = 3.75, SD =\npartial \"2 = .05. That is, participants who viewed the target ignoring the baby reported lower\nlevels of sexual attraction (M = 3.73, SD = 1.48) than did those who viewed the target interacting\nwith the baby (M = 4.56, SD = 1.39, p < .01); no other comparisons were significant. We\nconducted one-way analyses of variance with follow-up comparisons to look at the effects of\npicture condition for each sex separately. As displayed in Figure 4, no pair-wise mean\ncomparisons for men were significant. However, women who viewed the target ignoring the\nbaby reported less sexual attraction than did women who viewed the target interacting with the\nbaby, p < .01. No other comparisons were significant; again, women who viewed the man\ninteracting with the baby did not report any more attraction relative to those who viewed him\nbeing domestic.\nEffects of Sex and Context on Ratings of Target's Personality\nFor perceptions of the target's personality, a two-way analysis of variance first revealed a\nmen (M = 3.28, SD = .80) perceived the target more positively than did women (M = 3.00, SD =\n< .001, partial \"2 = .31, with all pair-wise comparisons significant.

Third, the analysis of variance\nrevealed that the pattern of the effect of the manipulation was different for women than for men,\nfor each sex separately showed that among men, those who viewed the target ignoring the baby\nrated the target less positively (M = 2.89, SD = .76) than did those who viewed the target\ninteracting with the baby (M = 3.86, SD = .59), p < .001; and those who viewed the target being\nWomen More Than Men Attend to Indicators of Good Character\ndomestic also rated the target less positively (M = 3.11, SD = .69) than did those who viewed the\ntarget interacting, p < .01. Men's personality ratings of the female target did not differ for the\nignoring and domestic conditions. Among women, those who viewed the target ignoring the\nbaby rated the target less positively (M = 2.15, SD = .80) than did either those who viewed the\ntarget interacting with the baby (M = 3.62, SD = .81, p < .001), or those who viewed the target\nbeing domestic (M = 3.34, SD = .71, p < .001). Women's personality ratings of the target male\ndid not differ for the interacting and domestic conditions.\nFigure 4.

We first investigated links between sociosexuality and susceptibility to the\nmanipulation by including SOI score as a covariate in the analyses of variance reported above.\nNo significant effects were found for sociosexuality, either as a main effect or in interaction with\nsex and picture condition.

We also found that women's, but not men's, long-term romantic attraction to an\nopposite-sex model is negatively impacted by seeing that model ignore a baby in distress. Given\nwomen's parental certainty and overall likelihood of investing in offspring relative to men's, it is\nlikely that men have not evolved to be as sensitive as women to the opposite sex's willingness to\ninvest in offspring. And in line with this logic of parental investment, in Study 2 men's level of\nlong-term attraction to the female model was not impacted by seeing her ignore a baby. The\ndiscrepant results--that context did impact men's long-term evaluations of attractiveness in\nStudy 1, but did not in Study 2--beg explanation. In Study 2, we used a female model of above-\naverage (rather than slight) attractiveness. It is possible that, at least in momentary reflections\nsuch as in this study, surrounding contexts become essentially irrelevant to the average man\nevaluating a female who exceeds some minimum threshold of attractiveness. Perhaps, beyond\nsome minimum threshold yet to be defined, a man will ignore or discount other potentially\nvaluable traits in a mate. Future research might vary model attractiveness systematically to more\nclearly determine whether the attractiveness level of a female target moderates the influence of\ncontexts.\nIn this study, we also documented that women who viewed a male interacting with a baby\ndid not respond significantly more positively to him than did women who viewed him\nvacuuming (although the means were consistently in that direction). These findings corroborate\nBrase's (2006) conclusion that women's positive evaluations of men interacting with a baby may\nbe less domain-specific than suggested by previous research (La Cerra, 1995). However, as one\nreviewer of this paper noted, it also is possible that demonstrated willingness to vacuum, itself,\nserves as a cue of willingness to help with children.\nFinally, Study 2 documented that the effects of sex and picture condition are not\nmoderated by either individual differences in sociosexual orientation or beliefs about sex-role\nequality. Restricted men were no more negatively affected by the female target ignoring a baby\nthan were unrestricted men; and unrestricted women were no less affected by it than were\nrestricted women. Brase (2006) also found no moderating effects of sociosexual orientation. The\noverall pattern of findings raises the possibility that men's and women's responses to the\ndifferent stimuli may also be robust to individual differences in primary personality traits.\nThere are, however, other potential moderators of the effects documented in the current\nstudies. Because men are unreliable parental investors, women's perception of a man's\nattractiveness as a long-term mate should be sensitive to variables (besides behavior with a baby)\nthat are reliably associated with differences in parental investment. For example, highly\nattractive men \u00ad those having symmetrical and masculine features \u00ad have been shown to invest\nrelatively little in offspring compared to other men. Perhaps when the male target is highly\nsymmetrical and masculine, women will be less negatively impacted by seeing him ignore a\nbaby in distress because (1) he is not \"expected\" to invest, and (2) his lack of investment might\nbe outweighed by his higher likelihood of carrying \"good genes.\" Future research might\nWomen More Than Men Attend to Indicators of Good Character\ninvestigate the negative effect of ignoring a baby using male targets of varying degrees of\nsymmetry and masculinity.\nWomen's menstrual cycle phase when viewing a male target also might moderate the\nimpact of context on women's ratings of men's attractiveness. Given that women find masculine\nand symmetrical (\"good genes\") features especially attractive when they are ovulating\n(Gangestad and Thornhill, 1998; Penton-Voak and Perrett, 2000), women may be somewhat less\nsensitive to baby context--particularly if the target male is highly sexually attractive--when they\nare in the high fertility phase of their cycle.\nGeneral Discussion\nIn two different studies, using a between-subjects design and two independent sets of\nstimulus materials, we documented that women's evaluations of a man as a long-term and short-\nterm sex partner are negatively impacted by viewing that man ignore a baby in distress. In these\nsame studies we documented that men's evaluations of a woman as a potential sex partner are\nnot affected by viewing her ignore a baby in distress. In one of the two studies, men's\nevaluations of the woman as a long-term partner were not affected, either. Overall, our pattern of\nfindings suggests that women may be sensitive to cues of a man's willingness to invest in\noffspring, and this sensitivity is not moderated by sex-role beliefs or sexual permissiveness.\nBecause women did not respond differently to men interacting with a baby and men vacuuming,\nwomen's positive evaluations of the man interacting with the baby may be a product of a more\ngeneral sensitivity in women to good character--signs of kindness and compassion in all\nrelationship partners (e.g., friends and neighbors in addition to mates); however, it could also be\nthat helping with domestic chores is a reliable indicator of willingness to help with children. The\nfinding that women did not respond differently to the man smiling at a baby and the man\nvacuuming with a neutral facial expression does rule out the possibility that smiling drove the\nhigh ratings given to the interacting with baby target.\nOur findings should be interpreted with caution due to our limited subject populations of\nyoung college students. That said, the participants varied widely in their sociosexual orientation,\nand the targets they viewed, particularly in Study 2, were just a little older than themselves\n(about the same age of any romantic partners they themselves would likely be pursuing).\nMoreover, Brase (2006) utilized an internet sample of people of varying ages and documented\nfindings similar to ours. The current series of studies supports the general conclusion that women\nmore than men display sensitivity (and men more than women indifference) to an opposite-sex\ntarget's behavior toward a baby.\n"
