    "abstract": "Abstract\nGender stereotyping and gender role development is one of the debatable concerns to sociologists especially those who\nare interested in sociology of gender. This study attempts to investigate the role of family inculcating gender stereotyping\nin Pakhtun culture and its impact on gender role development conducted in public-sector universities of Malakand Division,\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The data were collected through in-depth interview method using interview guide\nas a tool of data collection. A sample size of 24 respondents consisting male and female students and teachers (8 samples from\neach university through purposive sampling technique) was selected from three universities in the region, that is, University\nof Malakand, University of Swat, and Shaheed Benazir Bhutto University Sharingal (main campus). The collected information\nhas been analyzed qualitatively where primary information has been linked with secondary data for further elaboration\nand attainment of grounded facts. The study reveals that gender stereotyping and gender role formation are sociocultural\nand relational constructs, which are developed and inculcated in the institutional network, social interaction, and social\nrelationships especially in family. The study indicated that in family sphere, gender stereotyping and gender role formation are\nthe outcome of gender socialization, differential familial environment, and parents' differential role with children. The study\nrecommends that gender-balanced familial environment, adopting the strategy of gender mainstreaming and positive role of\nmedia, can overcome gender stereotyping and reduce its impacts on gender and social role formation.\n",

Each cul-\nture assigns certain roles and standardized patterns of\nbehavior to its members that allow them to organize their\nlives in a consistent and predictable way. In normative\norder, cultures and societies prescribe normative role\nbehavior and ease-down interaction of individuals (Lindsey,\n2010). Normative role behavior is collectivistic that delim-\nits individual freedom and tie them to predetermined rights\nand duties as well as expectations. The socially constructed\nand culturally defined realities are closely associated with\nthe development of stereotypes that are predetermined\nnotions or images, which define various spheres of activi-\nties including gender.\nStereotyping is the act of judging someone on the basis\nof one's perception of the group to which that person\nbelongs. In other words, it is \"the unconscious or conscious\napplication of (accurate or inaccurate) knowledge of a\ngroup in judging a member of the group\" (Agars, 2004,\np. 104). A stereotype is a view that is held by one or more\nindividuals about a group to make overgeneralization of the\ncharacteristics of that group (Bell, 2007). Through stereo-\ntyping, people are categorized according to the characteris-\ntics they have in common, including gender, age, race,\nethnicity, language, religion, and so on. In sociological dis-\ncourse, stereotyping is closely associated with prejudicial\njudgment characterized by rigid and irrational generaliza-\ntion about an entire community of people. More specifi-\ncally, gender stereotypes are deep-rooted perceptions of the\n1University of Malakand, Lower Dir, Pakistan\nCorresponding Author:\nArab Naz, Associate Professor and Chairman, Department of Sociology,\nUniversity of Malakand, Chakdara, Lower Dir, Chakdara 2500, Pakistan.\nEmail: arab_naz@yahoo.com\nGender Stereotyping in Family: An\nInstitutionalized and Normative\nMechanism in Pakhtun Society of Pakistan\nMuhammad Hussain1, Arab Naz1, Waseem Khan1,\nUmar Daraz1, and Qaisar Khan1\n Keywords\nfamily, gender stereotyping, gender socialization, differential familial environment, gender role development, sociocultural\nand institutionalized mechanism\nCreative Commons CC BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page (http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\n2 SAGE Open\ncharacteristics of male and female, which support the con-\ntinuity of specific gender roles (Suter, 2006).\nBased on gendered division of labor and social roles, men\nand women are often represented stereotypically according\nto the traits they are assumed to possess by virtue of their\nbiological makeup (Lindsey, 2010). Several studies point to\nstereotyping on the basis of their sex-related characteristics\n(Sanders & Peterson, 1999). It is viewed that gender stereo-\ntypes are formed during the process of learning and commu-\nnication in which sociocultural and interactional factors play\nthe role of key socializing agents (Leaper & Friedman,\n2007). The factors and agents also include family as a basic\nand primary source of gender socialization (J. E. Jacobs,\n1991) where social roles are assigned based on gender\nizing agency transmits simplistic labels and deep-rooted\nmessages considered specific for a feminine woman and a\nmasculine man. In family, different role models are assigned\nto women and men according to what is traditionally attrib-\nuted to each sex. Similarly, on the basis of a set of physical\nqualities and psychological characteristics defined by family,\nsociety labels tasks which are known as gender stereotypes.\nIn many societies, masculinity is identified with competi-\ntiveness, aggressiveness, and independence, whereas femi-\nnine stereotypes revolve around a set of beliefs that define\nwomen as caring, altruistic, affective in interpersonal rela-\ntionships, child friendly, emotionally expressive, sensitive\nand empathetic, and above all submissive and passive\n(Ridgeway & Balkwell, 1997). Based on the argument, this\nstudy then attempts to investigate the role of family institu-\ntion in nurturing gender stereotypes among Pakhtuns. The\nstudy mainly focuses on the role of family in preserving,\nreinforcing, and thus perpetuating gender differentiation,\ngender socialization, gendered division of labor, and parents'\ndifferential treatment that inculcate gender stereotypes and\nresultantly affect gender role development.\nStatement of the Problem\nAs a male-dominated patriarchal society, Pakhtuns1 segre-\ngate gender roles according to the social order. Along with\nsex differences in perceived qualities, a socially shared and\nculturally defined set of expectations about gender behavior\nexists according to which individuals behave (Javaid, Omer,\n& Jabeen, 2012). Dichotomous stereotypical images regard-\ning gender roles are common, and role development is less\nnatural and more sociocultural based on predetermined\nnotions. Masculine roles are instrumental that link family to\nthe external world, whereas females manage domestic activi-\nties. The projection of sexism in the traditional and patriar-\nchic familial environment of Pakhtuns plays a substantial\nrole in providing a conducive environment to stereotypical\ndichotomy.\nThe development of gender stereotyping is not haphazard\nor automatic, rather facilitated by various sociocultural and\nrelational factors. The foremost among them is family, which\nplays a significant role in the development of gender stereo-\ntypes, and because of physical and social proximity, social-\nization, raring, and caring, the role of women is often\nstereotyped (Lindsey, 2010). In Pakhtun society, family\ninstitution operates under the influence of patriarchy2 along\nwith customs and traditions manifested in awarding more\nspace to men. For instance, the birth of male child is sym-\nbolic of increased family power and is thus celebrated,\nwhereas female birth does not bring such celebrations (Naz\n& Rehman, 2012). Similarly, key decisions related to mar-\nriage, mate selection, and other familial issues are dominated\nby men. The normative social order restricts women and\ntends to favor men to become the guardians and the rulers.\nPatriarchy protects male ideology and nurtures negative gen-\nder values. This study then is an attempt to investigate famil-\nial factors that contribute to stereotyping and highlights\ninstitutional mechanism for reinforcing and preserving gen-\nder stereotypes among Pakhtuns. It also attempts to explore\nthe impact of stereotyping on gender role development.\nMethod\nThis research study is qualitative in nature based on both sec-\nondary and primary information. For secondary information,\na thorough review of literature has been carried out where\ngender stereotypes are highlighted in a thematic manner. The\nprimary data are gathered from students and teachers of pub-\nlic-sector universities of Malakand Division.\nTo enrich the findings of the study, the primary data also\ninclude in-depth interviews through interview guide. A total\nof 24 interviews were conducted in the three universities, 8\nfrom each including University of Malakand, University of\nSwat, and Shaheed Benazir Bhutto University, Sharingal.\nSelected through purposive sampling, a gender-balanced rep-\nresentation from each university was ensured, that is, 2 male\nstudents, 2 male teachers, 2 female students, and 2 female\nteachers.3 Besides, the collected information related to the\nstudy has been analyzed qualitatively where primary infor-\nmation has been linked with secondary data for further elabo-\nration and attainment of grounded facts.\nAreas of Analysis Based on Primary and\nSecondary Data\nGender Socialization and Gender Stereotyping\nSocialization is the process through which a child becomes\nan individual respecting his or her environment's laws,\nnorms, and customs. Gender socialization is a more focused\nform of socialization; it is how children of different sexes are\nsocialized into their respective gender roles (Giddens, 1993)\nand taught what it means to be male or female (Morris,\n1988). Gender socialization begins at the moment of birth,\nand from the time when people ask one and the simple\nHussain et al. 3\nquestion, is it a girl or a boy (Gleitman, Fridlund, & Reisberg,\nare primarily learned through the dominant agencies of\nsocialization, such as family, peer, school, and so on, which\nare considered \"teachers\" of the society.\nThrough socialization, one can learn what is appropriate\nand improper for both genders (Crespi, 2004). To sociolo-\ngists, socialization is a process through which individuals\nlearn the way of life that includes culture and other capabili-\nties acquired by humans as members of the society (Booysen\nPopenoe, Cunningham, & Boult, 1998). Moreover, it is a\nlifelong process where individuals are believed to accumu-\nlate knowledge of the rules and regulations, norms and val-\nues, attitudes, customs, and other role requirements that are\nacceptable to their society and culture (Haralambos, 1985).\nIn this connection, every society presents a prescription\nregarding the content that individual members have to con-\nform to, to become active members of the society. Similarly,\nthrough socialization, individuals are inducted to social\nworld to learn gender appropriate role.\nIn this regard, gender role is learned through the process\nof socialization where individuals learn behaviors and atti-\ntudes prescribed by the society. Through this process, a par-\nticular culture and society shapes and reshapes the type and\nkind of men and women they like them to be (Hensline,\n1996). Similarly, each and every society of the world pre-\nscribes particular behaviors and attitudes for men and women\nappropriate in different situations, which constitute gender\nnorms in the form of prescriptive guidelines and resultantly\nform gender roles (Doyle & Paludi, 1991). With regard to\ngender role development, social learning perspective links it\nwith a lifelong learning process, which is carried by social-\nization through social institutions such as family, peers,\nmedia, and religion. Furthermore, it is carried out through\nobservation, imitation, and reinforcement mechanism that\nprovide a ground for character building and role formation\nIn familial environment, people learn specific sets of gen-\nder role requirements and responsibilities in accordance to\ntheir relevant social statuses. In addition, people also learn to\nrecognize the pressure of external forces that compel them to\nconform to, even when they do not accept the role definitions\nothers have for them. Children learn the traditional gender\nroles where such roles help to sustain gender stereotypes, for\nexample, males are believed to be aggressive, independent,\nand task-oriented, whereas females are assumed as more sen-\nsitive, emotional, people-oriented, and dependent. In this\nregard, extracts have been taken from field information as\nevidence material to the secondary data mentioned. The field\ndata reflect different views of the interviewees that come in\nsupport to the secondary data, while somehow it has con-\nfounded the literature. The question regarding socialization\nwas asked as follows: \"When and how did you start knowing\ngender stereotyping?\"\nIn response to the questions, different opinions and\nresponses were recorded having unanimity and disagreement\nat some points. In this regard, majority of the respondents\nreflected that knowing the stereotyping usually starts at the\nearly childhood. In such type of situations, children face a\nkind of taunt and social stigma while indulging in tasks of\nopposite gender, that is, playing Gudyani (Dolls), Chindro,\nMirgaaty,4 and so on, as such games are viewed as feminine.\nAmong the respondents, extractions have been taken from\nthe interview of Respondent 13 (male student) where he\nexpresses,\n. . . I used to play the traditional games at the early childhood\nwithout observing the masculine or feminine games. I had my\nfemale cousins who were my ultimate friends and we had to play\ngames such as Gudyaani (Dolls), Chindro, Mirgaaty, etc. In\nmost of the cases, my father observed me and daunted me\nseverely for playing such type of womanly games. I was\ndiscouraged to mix-up with females as it was against the cultural\npatterns and traditions of the family as well as community.\nThis sort of compulsion over children creates a sense and\nidentity of their gender where they are directed through ste-\nreotypic socialization that male children should not join the\ncompany and games related to females, and females should\navoid masculine activities. Besides, in response to the next\nquestion that when and where do gender stereotypes form,\nthe respondents reflected in majority that mostly gender seg-\nregation occurs at the early puberty or teenage. It was added\nby the respondents that the gender segregation occurs at the\ntime when two opposite sexes, that is, boys and girls, come\nin contact or gather with one another, which is mostly forbid-\nden by the family and community. In this connection, the\ncommunal perception is highly taken into consideration.\nRespondent 9 (male student) tells,\n. . . Since the very early age, I used to visit the traditional Mela\n(mostly celebrated at Eids) in my village along with other\nmembers of the family especially the female relatives. In this\nway, I confronted a strong and strict communal rejection for\ndoing so when few of community members complained my\nfather after our visit. My father severely scolded me and even\nslapped me many times that it was a bad job I had involved in.\nAt the same time (while meeting the consequences) I realized\nthat male and female are the two different streams that are not\nallowed to be mixed up. Since that, I hear the resilience of those\nslaps and avoid the mixing up with opposite gender as it is a kind\nof sin.\nResultantly, the discussion so far in terms of literary and\nempirical information reflects that socialization is mostly cul-\ntural in nature, which is inculcated to the followers inside fam-\nily and community. Cultural transmission and inculcation is an\nancestral process that is reinforced through imitation and mod-\neling of the socializing agencies, particularly parents inside\nthe family. In the same manner, the new generation in the area\n4 SAGE Open\nunder study has been acknowledged with gender-specific roles\nsince their birth that continues throughout their life span. In\nthis regard, the concluding field information leads to a smaller\ntheory that differential gender socialization and compulsive\nfamilial environment create gender differences that become\ngender stereotypic and finally develop gender role.\nDifferences Between Boys and Girls and Gender\nStereotyping\nGender differences are developed through the process of\nsocialization where such differences are strengthened during\nchildhood as well as adolescence. For example, before the\nage of 3 years, there are fascinating differences between boys\nand girls that further create differences in their interaction. In\nthis way, boys mostly attempt to dominate, control, and try to\nfind out the answer of the question \"Am I better than you?\"\nand they try to present themselves as being strong and inde-\npendent. Similarly, they also establish their dominant social\nstatus; even then, they try to continue and use the masculine\nautonomy to maintain their position in the long run.\nContrary to boys, girls try to establish and sustain their\nrelationships where they often ask the question, \"Do you like\nme?\" because boys and girls want to adopt and do different\nthings; they start to avoid each other at the age of 3 or 4\nyears. At the age of 6 years, girls mostly do not like the rough\nand tough male-type play and dislike boys' dominance, and\ntherefore, they choose the girls as playmates instead of boys.\nIn childhood, boys mostly do not like girls' games. Indeed,\nboys are not ready to adopt feminine characters and even feel\nshame to do so, whereas this is not the case with girls. In this\nway, boys always want to be active and competitive, and\nseem less interested to win friends and make relationships\nThe facts in terms of gender differences have prevalence\nin the area under study as well, although this research has\nidentified some other areas that are missing in the prevalent\nliterature such as gender differences in games, domestic\nactivities, peers' participation, and so on. In this regard, the\nquestions asked in terms of gender differences were as fol-\nlows: What are gender differences, and are they different or\nstereotyped? And, how do biological characteristics deter-\nmine and influence gender role?\nTo examine the difference in light of primary data, the\nrespondents were interviewed where their response has been\naccounted and explained. The gender differences are empha-\nsized by the respondents in a high number, that differences\ndo found in the area among boys and girls. The differences\nare mostly cultural and psychological where the behavioral\naspects also have a dominant role. The Pakhtun generation is\ninculcated with identification of such differences since birth\nthough socialization.\nIn light of gender differences, males are labeled with to\nshow Ghairat or bravery which inculcated by the elders\nthrough storytelling of the forefathers. They must act in a\ntraditional manner keeping the decorum of their culture in\nmind. On the contrary, females are taught with emotionality\nand delicacy through examples from the past. In addition,\nfemales mostly urge on this outlook including their physique\nin terms of delicacy while keeping the traditional norms.\nAlthough they are less likely involved in beautification of\nthemselves, as it is against the customary law, yet traditional\nSinghaar (makeup) is observed. Males in this category are\nfound to show aggression and bravery to reflect their domi-\nnance and supremacy. Through this way, they take the bridle\nof leadership and thus form a patriarchic structure. Females\non the contrary are taught to be submissive and obedient.\nTo authenticate the statement, interview (with Respondent\n7, female teacher) has interesting information regarding\ngender differences. As a female teacher, she expresses,\n. . . of all the other obligations that a Pakhtun female has to obey\nand follow, I was less likely taught about the gender differences.\nAs the environment of my home is educated and most of the\nmembers are cooperative and open minded. I have taken my\neducation in coeducational institution and having an employed\nstatus. Instead of all these facilitations, I have been restricted\nand internalized with the gender differences. I have been\ninculcated with the femininity, obedience, submission and\ndistance from the opposite gender. In most cases, I had to mix-up\nwith my colleagues in some kind of parties and functions, where\nI was strictly discouraged to attend such gatherings where I had\nto submit my will and obeyed. In this way, I learned and realized\nthe statement \"Do as the Romans do,\" if I was to be part of the\nculture, community, and family. Currently, I believe that both\nthe males and females are two sides of a stream that go parallel\nto a long way, but can't meet.\nThe field information shows that gender differences are\nnot natural but rather the production of sociocultural pack-\nages where such packages are practiced in different institu-\ntions especially in family. In a family, through socialization,\nparents enact stereotypic images regarding male and female\nwhere children learn all such differences and internalize\nthem. At early ages, individuals do not know about gender\ndifferences where they are on the disposal of their parents;\nchildren know about their gender as male or female, and\nadopt roles that their parents prescribe to them.\nIn addition, it has been cleared from the findings of\nresearch studies conducted so far along with current study\nthat there are differences between males and females, where\nsuch differences are strengthened and internalized by both\ngenders through the process of gender socialization. In famil-\nial environment, parents are the primary influence on gender\nrole development in the early years of one's life (Kaplan,\nother groups, is characterized by a specific way of living\nferences through a process that is surely biological but also\nrelational and social. Family is the social and symbolic\nplace where difference in general and sexual difference in\nHussain et al. 5\nparticular are believed to be fundamental and at the same\nIn concluding remarks, it has been observed from second-\nary and field information that gender socialization is a means\nto create gender differences whereby individuals learn about\ntheir gender and adopt roles, which are viewed as gender\nappropriate. In the course of socialization carried out in family\nat early age, parents take in consideration the stereotypic\nimages of such differences while treating their children as\nboys and girls where individuals are socialized differently\nunder the socially and culturally defined notions--stereotypes.\nIn this way, the proposed research assumption that \"differen-\ntial family environment, parental socialization and gender\nsocialization in family lead to the development of gender ste-\nreotyping which further puts stress on traditional masculine\nand feminine gender roles\" is proved valid and authentic.\nParents' Role in Inculcation of Gender\nStereotyping\nResearch studies show that parental behavior toward their\nchildren, either overt or covert, is the primary influence on\ngender role stereotyping development in early life (Crespi,\nin children's socialization and provide a suitable environ-\nment in family where they contact with their children in a\nface to face interaction. Parents teach stereotypes through\ndifferent ways and behaviors in daily life, for example, the\nway they use to dress their children and decorate their chil-\ndren's rooms, the toys they give their children to play with,\nand their own attitudes and behavior toward them that\nincrease the inculcation of gender stereotyping (Hetherington\nIn family, parents take in consideration the emotionality of\ntheir children whenever they make conversations with them,\nand similarly, they discuss matters differently with sons and\ndaughters (Dunn, Bretherton, & Munn, 1987). In this context,\nparents especially mothers talk more with their daughters and\nencourage them for more supportive and affiliative speech\nand remarks in relation to others as compared with sons\n(Leaper, Anderson, & Sanders, 1998; Leaper, Leve, Strasser,\n& Schwartz, 1995). Contrary to this, mothers encourage inde-\npendence and autonomy in their sons (Pomerantz & Ruble,\n1998), and they rarely discuss same matters with their daugh-\nters (Fivush, 1989). In regard of father and mother role in\ngender socialization and stereotyping, Leaper (2000) identi-\nfied that mothers as compared with fathers used to encourage\ncollaborative play with sons and daughters, but similarly, they\nfavor affiliative play with daughters; they are encouraged for\nsupportive and responsive interaction with others, whereas\nthe reaction of fathers was negative especially with their sons\nfor cross-gender behavior.\nIn addition, parents share their thoughts, experiences, and\nbehaviors with children and provide resources in the com-\nmunity to assist them in developing healthy gender attitudes\n(Sales, Spjeldnes, & Koeshe, 2010). Parents also socialize\ntheir children through storytelling, which is one of the domi-\nnant ways of socialization whereby children learn regarding\ntheir gender and gender role. Through storytelling, children\nare familiarized with the valued attributes and personal traits.\nIn this regard, Fiese and Skillman (2000) have highlighted\nmany patterns of storytelling for the development of gender-\ntyped characteristics, values, and related traits among chil-\ndren. These studies also identified that parents especially\nfathers used to tell the stories of bravery, success, and\nachievement to their sons, whereas mothers especially told\nthe stories of emotions, expression, relationship, and support\nto their daughters (Fiese & Skillman, 2000).\nFurthermore, it has also been identified that the emotion-\nality level of men and women is different where women are\nviewed as emotionally passive, whereas men having mascu-\nline attributes are aggressive. In this way, through the pro-\ncess of socialization, gender stereotypes are developed and\ninculcated inside family where parents treat their children\nwith an internalized stereotypic manner to enact their sons\nwith anger, strong, and agentic, whereas girls with passive,\nweak, and delicate. This stereotypic socialization defines and\ndecides different and separated spheres both for male and\nfemale and resultantly provides a ground for gender role\ndevelopment. In the context of current research study, gender\nstereotyping is socially constructed reality as supported by\nthe literature, which is deep-rooted in the sociocultural norms\nof Pakhtun society. Under this gender stereotypic mecha-\nnism, in Pakhtun traditional society, men are viewed as earn-\ners to support their families and are involved in buying and\nselling, agricultural activities and jobs, and so on, and there-\nfore are appreciated and encouraged both by parents and\ncommunity members (such notion is supported by majority\nof interviewees). Similarly, the parents (teachers) were asked\nhow they treat their children where their replies show that\nbeing parents living in traditional areas, they consider and\neven teach their sons to be active, aggressive, brave, domi-\nnant, and independent, whereas daughters are prescribed\nwith to-do household chores and are supposed to be submis-\nsive, weak, and dependent (viewpoint of teachers in major-\nity). Such viewpoints and the obtained findings reflect the\ninculcation of gender stereotypes facilitated by parents' role\nand behavior, which they have with their children. Among\nthe respondents, the ideas of Respondent No 13 (male stu-\ndent) have interesting elaborations, which reflect,\n. . . I am a traditional and pure Pakhtun and love to follow\nPakhtunwali as my code for which I feel honored. My father has\nbeen telling me the past and old stories of our grandparents, their\nlives, their culture, their activities and so on. I have been told\nwith the old Hujra (guest house) system where decisions were\nused to be taken for conflicts by an elder who was my\ngrandparent. Since my childhood, I have conceptualized the\npicture of those brilliant personalities in my mind and I try to act\nlike them somehow at times. During my childhood and teenage\nI used to draw beard and moustaches on my face through a\n6 SAGE Open\nmarker and pencil, wore his Paghrhi (turban), handed his Kontai\n(stick) and sit in Hujra. Some of my village-mates were asked to\nbe the servants and the remaining were the parties having\nconflict on land or other matters for which I made the decisions.\nSuch acting has been so deeply internalized in my mind that\nthose personalities have become my role models and I believe\nthat all Pakhtun males should be like them. Pakhtun must be\nbrave, aggressive, decision-maker, fighter, muscular and\nun-fearing of any threat or situation.\nThe findings observed so far from the extracts of inter-\nviews explicitly indicate that the stereotypic images--\nnotions such as anger, bravery, boldness, cooperativeness,\ndecision making, and so on--related to males and females\nare not inherent but rather developed among individuals\nthrough the process of socialization. The family or parents\nteach their children in a way to give them an impression to\nexhibit such type of masculine characteristics as members of\nsociety and culture.\nSimilarly, however, field information reflects that a\nPakhtun female should be of contrary nature where she has\nto be passive, low tuned (while talking), caretaker of others,\ncooperative, shy, and so on (views of respondents in major-\nity) In addition, similar views have been documented from\nthe extracts (of interview) of Respondent 21 (female inter-\nviewee) as\n. . . we have been taught under the rules of Pakhtunwali in family\nthat women are born in the four walls; they have to live inside\nthe four walls and after death to be again buried in the four walls\nof the grave. Such inculcation reflect the strict observance of\nPurdah (veil) on female folk as we (all females in the family)\nhave to keep distance from male members whether relatives or\noutsiders. In addition, it has been emphasized on us to cool,\ncalm and less talkative when males (particularly elders) are at\nhome, while strictly directed to keep the tone of voice at lowest\nlevel when talking at home. Further, we have to submit our wills\nin decisions taken for family or individuals that also include our\npersonal matters such education, mate selection, employment or\nproperty. In this connection, our familial and cultural norms\nhave been settled and we are obeying them whole heartedly.\n(Similar remarks also noted from the extractions of interviews\nWhile analyzing the mentioned facts about both cases, it\nis clear that men (among Pakhtun) are lying at the dominant\nedge, whereas women at the low. Men are the decision mak-\ners for the whole community being elder of the village,\nwhereas women are unable even to decide their own personal\nmatters. Such are the stereotypical images that have been\nemerged from the prevalent normative structure in collabora-\ntion with customary law of the culture. Resultantly, these\nimages are inculcated and internalized by the young genera-\ntion of Pakhtun society where parents play a dominant role.\nIt is clear from the aforementioned discussion that parents\nplay a key role in the development of gender and gender role\nin early years of life. Parents encourage their children for\ngender appropriate activities, such as they emphasize on girls\nto play with dolls and boys with trucks as supported by\nresearch studies (Eccles, Jacobs, & Harold, 1990). In addi-\ntion, parents send predetermined messages to children that\nthey think will give signals to sexes for gender appropriate\nrole (Arliss, 1991). Parents also adopt different ways to\nspeak and play differently with boys and girls. They use\nreward if the children conform to and punishment if the chil-\ndren intent to break the normative order of gender roles, for\nexample, when a boy plays with dolls, he is discouraged and\nsimilarly, a general statement is made that boys are emotion-\nally strong and should not adopt feminine games and charac-\nparents do not send any messages intentionally, it is enough\nfor children to notice the differences between sexes by\nobserving the adults in surrounding; thus, they observe and\nnotice others and accordingly behave. In this connection, the\nprevalent stereotypic knowledge, that is, men are instrumen-\ntal, aggressive, and tough, whereas women are emotionally\nexpressive and submissive, is enough for children to act like-\nwise. Finally, the findings drawn from field information and\nsecondary data validate the assumption that differential\nparental socialization inside family leads to the development\nof gender stereotyping and gender role formation.\nDifferential Treatment in Family and Gender\nStereotyping\nThe available literature and secondary sources highlighted\nthat gender stereotypes are deeply rooted within the realm of\nsociocultural structure and are transferred to next generation\nthrough the process of socialization (Basow, 1992). In this\nregard, most of the traditional societies have made strong\ndistinctions between the traits and attributes associated to\ngender, whereas this is not the case with few developed soci-\neties (Davidson & Gordon, 1979). Children in familial envi-\nronment are socialized differently, where the parents try to\nprepare their offspring for appropriate gender roles. In this\nconnection, Basow (1992) extracted from her research find-\nings that due to differential treatment in family, children\nbehave and develop their role differently. For example, in\nmost of the traditional cultural setups, boys are discouraged\nto cry; they are also prepared to be emotionally strong in\npainful and unfavorable situations. An expression of bravery\nand strength is given by resembling them to tigers where it is\nassumed that tigers do not cry, whereas this is not the case\nwith girls, because they are considered weak. Keeping such\nnotions in view, boys being strong and brave are socialized to\nbe competitive and success-oriented (Booysen & De Witt,\n1995). Furthermore, parents use their internalized differen-\ntial treatment while socializing their children, which means\nthat their beliefs and values will affect their parenting skills.\nWhat knowledge and beliefs regarding gender and gender\nrole parents have acquired will be transferred consciously or\nunconsciously to their children. In this regard, to clarify the\nHussain et al. 7\ntheme of current research study regarding differential treat-\nment and gender stereotyping in the context of family, views\nof the respondents are illustrated as follows:\n. . . In our traditional family system, males and females are\ntreated differently. Our parents tend to encourage male children\nto be active and girls to be passive. Most of our parents are very\nclose to their sons as compared to daughters. (Interviewees 7,\nThere seems an obvious demarcation between male and\nfemale segments pertaining to treatment by the parents. In\nthis regard, views of one of the female respondents have\nbeen elaborated as follows, where she expresses,\n. . . treating male and female differently is a passion as well as\nfashion in the current scenario of cultured and traditionally\nfounded societies. Although I have not been deprived of the\nrights that are deemed necessary in my survival, growth and\nwell-being yet if I analyze my life critically there seems some\nkind of discriminative treatment with us. I (even all the females\nin my home) am treated differently than my brothers and other\nmale members at home in different aspects of life. Here I would\nexpress that discrimination in serving the food to males earlier\nthan that of males is discrimination as it hits the sense of\ninferiority. In addition, we have always been suggested and\ndirected while selecting a dress for us where males had the\nauthority to wear what they desired for. Besides, I have observed\nan obvious difference in my schooling where I hadn't any say to\nselect the institution and field for my studies which solely in the\nhands of my elder males. The most irritating and important\ndecision of life is considered as mate selection to whom we are\nliable to spend the whole life, is thoroughly out of our access\nwhere males have the authority in this context. On the basis of\nsuch differences, it is obvious that there is a gendered culture in\nour society that restricts our mobility and movement as well and\nmakes the female segment a dependant and oppressed stream.\nSimilarly, an example can be extracted from the work of\nBasow (1992), where she argued that it is evident that par-\nents' differential treatment and reaction affect children's\nbehavior in the future endeavors of life; for example, par-\nents have been observed reacting negatively to their chil-\ndren, especially girls, whenever the girls are observed in\nmasculine character and boys in feminine character.\nDeferential treatment of parents has also been observed in\ncase of toy selection that the buy for boys and girls, while\nits intensity becomes high and significant, whenever par-\nents prefer to assign household activities to girls and out-\ndoor chores to boys.\nFurthermore, in most of the research studies, it has also\nbeen observed that parents' differential behavior with boys\nand girls in a single familial environment sharpen the preva-\nlence of gender differences in daily life. Mostly, the parents\nfollow the traditional, already defined, and socially con-\nstructed notions, that is, stereotypes while socializing children,\nwhere these stereotypes represent the collective knowledge,\ncustoms and traditions, and convictions and conventions of the\nsociety concerned (Macrae, Stangor, & Hewstone, 1996).\nThrough the help of this projection, individuals learn to\ndevelop a stereotypic belief regarding the group with whom\nthey belong, which in the long run affect their behavior or role.\nSuch stereotypic behavior is learned, transmitted, and changed\nin the course of socialization. With respect to socialization,\nfamily reinforces the existing stereotypic knowledge to the\nyoungsters.\nThe aforementioned discussion indicates that gender dif-\nferences are not biological, but rather sociocultural and rela-\ntional, where these differences are primarily identified and\nthen inculcated in family. Likewise in other societies and\ncultures, family is considered one of the basic and primary\nsources of socialization where children, youngsters, and\nadults are socialized. Family holds the responsibility to teach\nindividuals about gender appropriate behavior and guide\nthem regarding the cultural and societal expectations of the\nsex-typed activities. Inside family, boys and girls are social-\nized differently under the existing socially and culturally\ndefined patterns regarding males and females. Furthermore,\nthey are trained to adopt specific masculine and feminine\nroles; these gender roles are assigned to them under the pre-\nvailing stereotypic image of males and females, which are\nconsidered constant and pervasive.\nThe information obtained from secondary sources and\nfield data validate the proposed assumption that differential\nfamilial environment, parental socialization, appreciation,\nand discouragement lead to the development of gender ste-\nreotyping and role formation. This assumption also adds\nknowledge to the Social Learning Theory which focuses\nupon gender socialization, imitation, as well as reward and\npunishment that find children while living in family.\nDivision of Labor in Family and Gender\nStereotyping\nIn the course of gender socialization, parents treat their chil-\ndren differently and assign them different tasks considered\nappropriate to their gender. In this context, parents follow the\nalready defined notions--stereotypes that are constant and\npervasive in each and every society and culture of the world.\nFurthermore, in family sphere, activities are divided between\nmales and females on the basis of their gender where males\nare supposed to handle outdoor activities such as farming,\nbusiness, shopping, and other having masculine or energetic\ncharacteristics, whereas female are assumed to handle\ndomestic chores such as cooking, washing, sweeping, and\ntaking care of youngsters. This sort of division of labor is\nalso prevalent in Pakhtun society where on the basis of pre-\ndetermined notion--stereotyping regarding males and\nfemales--they are viewed fit for certain activities. Among\nPakhtuns, this division seems very much unique because of\nits strict nature where both genders are restricted to follow\nthe expected pattern of behavior as well as the larger societal\n8 SAGE Open\nexpectations. The domestic sphere, which is specified only\nfor females, is highly emphasized, and their participation in\noutdoor activities is strongly discouraged. Similarly, male\nmembers in Pakhtun society are directed to be the followers\nof masculine expectations and not to be indulged in feminine\nactivities.\nRelevant to findings extracted from secondary data, filed\ninformation analyzes the mentioned phenomenon addressing\nPakhtun culture with its uniformity and variability. In the\ncontext of cultural uniformity, just like other cultures,\nPakhtuns also exhibit the patterns related to division of labor\nbetween two genders; they confine women to domestic\nchores and men to outdoor activities. However, as far as the\nvariability is concerned, Pakhtun culture has certain different\nand unique ways to assign domestic sphere merely to women,\nand activities out of house are regarded as men-oriented with\nstrong prohibition for both genders not to participate in the\nsphere of opposite gender (supported by majority of respon-\ndents). Furthermore, to validate the argument about stereo-\ntypic division of labor in Pakhtun familial sphere, views of\nthe interviewed respondents are illustrated where they were\nof the opinion that\n. . . family is the place where we are socialized and come to\nknow about their gender as male and female. To them, gender\nrole identification is carried out through clear and strict division\nof labor where parents prescribe certain activities specific for\nboys and girls.These activities are considered gender appropriate\nin our culture. Under this division of labor males are supposed to\nhandle outdoor activities like farming, shopping, business,\nearning etc while females are confined to domestic chores like\ncooking, washing, take care of youngsters, helping mothers, etc.\nrespectively)\nIn this connection, Interviewee 15 (male respondent)\nreflects unique information where the division of labor\nexpresses the gender stereotyping in the area. He expresses,\n. . . I have been taught to behave as a traditional Pakhtun following\nall the codes of Pakhtunwali and obliging the expected role. In\nresponse, I persevered not to compromise on my manly-Pakhtun\noutlook and deal things and situations as expected. At some\nstages I feel the situation of my sisters very pathetic and poignant\nwhere they work from dawn to dusk having no "
