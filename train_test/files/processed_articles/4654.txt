This specific study\nwas motivated by the combined scientific and journalistic\ncuriosity to hear the \"voices\" of women around the world on\ntimely and urgent matters in which they play central roles.\nThe effect of migration on women's lives in general is one\nof these concerns. The purpose of the present study is to\ndevelop a preliminary and overall understanding of the topic\nin the Japanese context as the country is facing simultane-\nously major demographic challenges such as becoming a\nsuper-aged society and facing the lowest fertility rate in the\nworld. It implies multiple societal, health, and economic\nWomen's Employment in Japan\nThe female full-employment rate in Japan is very low com-\npared with other OECD (Organisation for Economic\nCo-Operation and Development) countries (OECD iLibrary,\n2013). This low female employment rate includes career and\nnoncareer track employment (OECD iLibrary, 2013).\nFurthermore, during the past two decades, the Japanese\neconomy has experienced deflation (http://web-japan.org/\nfactsheets/en/pdf/e04_economy.pdf). Urgent questions are\nbeing raised in Japan regarding the low ratio of women in\nfull-time employment within the total workforce. A substan-\ntial increase in the full-time employment of women in remu-\nnerated activities would entail more taxable incomes\nnecessary to face the financial need of a super-aged society\n(Elborgh-Woytek et al., 2013). In fact, the government is\nconsidering reducing and even abolishing the spousal tax\nent tax system, the head of the household, usually the hus-\nband, can obtain a spousal income tax deduction if their wife\nearns less than \u00a51.41 million a year. In addition, the wife is\nnot required to pay a premium to become eligible for the\nnational pension plan if she earns less than \u00a51.3 million a\nyear (Miyamoto, 2016). As a result, many women are not\nencouraged to seek full-time employment. Boosting female\nemployment implies also inspiring women to develop\ncareers, become executives, and find themselves in leader-\nship roles. To facilitate this development, Prime Minister\nAbe even promotes eradication of waiting lists for day care\ncenters by the end of 2017, employment of at least one\nwoman to an executive position in listed companies as well\n1The Swedish Red Cross University College, Huddinge, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nSt\u00e9phanie Paillard-Borg, The Swedish Red Cross University College, P.O.\nEmail: pais@rkh.se\nImmigration, Women, and Japan--A Leap\nAhead and a Step Behind: A Qualitative\nJournalistic Approach\nSt\u00e9phanie Paillard-Borg1 and Jessica Holmgren1\n Keywords\ncase study, demographic transition, immigration, Japanese super-aged society, women's employment.\n2 SAGE Open\nas the option for women to get their old job back after mater-\nnity leave (Kodera, 2014). Christine Lagarde, director of the\nInternational Monetary Fund, supports this approach and\nbelieves that women can \"save\" Japan through joining\ncareer-track jobs that would boost economic growth\n(Kingston, 2013). Some would argue that women already are\ntaking on the task as they care for all sorts of responsibilities\nranging from \"being mothers, wives and caregivers for\nelderly relatives to employees, volunteers and household\nIncreased women's employment rate as well as a more\nliberal immigration law, facilitating the entry in the country\nof foreign domestic workers (http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/\nChilddomesticlabour/lang\u00aden/index.htm), has been dis-\ncussed at the highest level of the Japanese government\n(\"Japanese Women and Work,\" 2014). In fact, Prime Minister\nAbe highlighted in his political structural reform the urgency\nof increasing labor mobility. This reform combines the revi-\nsion of the Japanese traditionally restrictive immigration law\nand low female employment. Its objective is to raise the\ncountry's gross domestic product (GDP), but these two main\nissues are still very sensitive (Sanda, 2014). \"We would like\nto proactively consider how to use foreign domestic workers\nfrom the perspective of women's empowerment and eco-\nnomic growth\" stated Prime Minister Abe in April 2014\n(\"Government's Foreign Home Helper,\" 2015). This politi-\ncal, economic, and immigration strategy is a way to tackle\nthe consequences of a super-aged society. It is proposed that\nforeign domestic workers could potentially ease strains on\nJapanese families, in particular help Japanese women with\nthe burden of domestic responsibilities, child, and elderly\nwould therefore boost their chance of career development\nImmigration to Japan\nUntil now, the Japanese government had insisted in principle\nthat it would not accept unskilled workers as it did not want to\nmaintain foreign workers into problematic working conditions\nand as such, foreigners could not, as a rule, obtain a long-term\nvisa as domestic workers. The exceptions were for those\nemployed by diplomats, non-Japanese nationals with a high\nincome, or those married to a Japanese citizen or with another\npreexisting residency qualification (\"Government's Foreign\nHome Helper,\" 2015). In Japan, domestic workers are mostly\nimmigrant women from Southeast Asia. The strict immigra-\ntion policy, described above, has made it historically difficult\nfor these women to immigrate to Japan. Time-limited working\nvisas have been delivered traditionally to women \"entertain-\ners\" or job training assimilated to low-paid jobs (Roberts,\n2008). The outlook of gaining a long-term legal status in Japan\nas an unskilled worker is low. In addition, the prospect of\nacquiring employment in a Japanese household is socioeco-\nnomically difficult for several reasons. First, domestic work is\nnot widely socially accepted in Japan compared with other\nAsian countries. Even household help by Japanese to Japanese\nis not common, as many Japanese perceive that working as a\ndomestic worker is somewhat shameful, but also hiring help to\ncare for loved ones can be perceived as dishonorable (Sanda,\n2014). Second, the language barrier can also be, in some cases,\nan important issue for these unskilled workers. Third, it is\ncostly for a middle-class Japanese family to hire a domestic\nworker (Sanda, 2014). According to a survey by the Nomura\nResearch Institute (NRI), the main reasons for not hiring\ndomestic workers was the cost and the reluctance to bring a\nstranger into the home (\"Government's Foreign Home\nLegitimate concerns from human rights defense groups\nare raised in regard to the legal status, working conditions,\nand rights of those foreign women domestic workers\n(Llewelyn & Hirano, 2009; \"Overwork Cited in Deaths of\nficking, as Japan has been on United Nations Watch list, is\none of the many dangers for these women (Noguchi, 2006).\nA more generous immigration policy might mitigate the\nproblem as long as the laws are clear and in accordance to\ninternational labor law protection for foreign workers and\nhuman rights. By not having a well-defined and stringent\nprotection law, the risk of creating abuse of all kinds is highly\nprobable (Noguchi, 2006). From a Japanese perspective, a\nreasonable degree of apprehension regarding immigration is\npresent and is associated with worsening of public security\nassociated to criminality, \"social costs\" related to education,\nreduced wages connected to competition (\"EDITORIAL,\"\n2016). The potential increase in labor mobility encouraging\nthe employment of foreign domestic workers could be per-\nceived as a threat toward the employment of unskilled\nJapanese workers who have already very low wages\n(\"Government's Foreign Home Helper,\" 2015; Sugimoto,\n2010). Nevertheless, the demand for such workers will prob-\nably keep increasing due to the rapid growth of the elderly\npopulation and its needs. This situation is under serious scru-\ntiny by the Abe's government and needs an urgent sustain-\nable approach. That is why the present government sees the\nimmigration to the country and employment of foreign\ndomestic workers as a mean to anticipate and respond to the\nurgent demand within elderly care. In the near future, the\ndemand will probably be higher than the supply (Kato &\nMiyamoto, 2015).Already, an increasing number of Japanese\npeople, most often women but also men, had to quit their job\nand start caring for elderly relatives (Sanda, 2014).\nFurthermore and in accordance with the widespread con-\ncerns regarding immigration, not only unskilled but also\nskilled workers such as nurses, usually from Southeast Asia,\nare often refused the right to immigrate to Japan due to\npolitical pressure by the Japanese labor unions (Sanda,\n2014). Indeed, the government imposes a difficult and chal-\nlenging examination for foreign nurses, which, among other\ndifficulties, requires high Japanese language competency\nPaillard-Borg and Holmgren 3\n(\"Issues Relating to Foreign Workers in Japan,\" 2004). With\nincreased immigration, Japan would be expected to move\nfrom a homogenous and exclusionist society to a heteroge-\nneous and inclusive one which would shake the whole social\norganization, fear widely exploited historically by conserva-\ntive political groups (Komai, 1995). Of significance,\nJapanese women seem to be more in favor toward immigra-\ntion in general than men as well as Generation Y more in\nfavor than Generation X and previous generations (Llewelyn\nEconomists and social scientists see the issues of female\nemployment, immigration, and demographic changes as\ninterconnected, influencing one another, and being poten-\ntially linked to solutions for a more sustainable future.\nHowever, very little is known about the thoughts of Japanese\nwomen and their own desire to join the workforce and accept\nforeign domestic help to care for their children and elderly\nfamily members. Indeed, to our knowledge no study has\nbeen combining, through an in-depth interview, the explora-\ntion of the following two intertwined factors: the boost in\nJapanese female employment and the increase in immigrant\nfemale domestic workers to Japan. The context of this study\nis a Japanese megapolis with a focus on the work distribution\nbetween low-skilled immigrant women compared with their\npotentially higher skilled Japanese counterparts.\nAim\nThe aim of this study was to explore, from the perspective of\na Japanese woman, the intertwined issues of female immi-\ngration to Japan and the need for foreign domestic workers,\nand Japanese women's employment as the country is facing\nmajor demographic and societal changes.\nMethod\nTo fulfill the aim, a case study with an in-depth interview\nwas performed and analyzed by content analysis with a\nmethodological departure in journalistic interviewing. Under\nthis particular type of interview, the research questions\u00ad\nissues are expected to be refined continuously as new and\npreviously unexpected aspects of the phenomenon come to\nlight, a process that Partlett and Hamilton (1976) called pro-\ngressive focusing. Indeed, the qualitative research in journal-\nism allows to start out the investigation of a given topic with\na preliminary idea, and then to reveal more significant issues\nthan originally thought (Hartin Iorio, 2004). The product of\nthis type of interview permits then the qualitative case study\nresearch to capture the complexity of a phenomenon within\nits real-life context (Paillard-Borg & Str\u00f6mberg, 2014). A\ncase study is suitable when the case represents something\nunique worth documenting and analyzing (Yin, 2003).\nThe study had for starting point the major global demo-\ngraphic transition that is currently taking place in the world\ncharacterized by an aging of the population and a dropping\nfertility rate. Japan was chosen for its front line position in\nthis demographic change accompanied by a strict immigra-\ntion policy and a low women participation in the labor force.\nThe Case\nA 48-year-old Japanese woman, called Yuka for the purpose\nof this study, was interviewed. She was divorced and mother\nof an 11-year-old child. She owned a successful business\nwith an international profile in the center of Tokyo. She\nspoke good English and had studied and lived in the United\nStates for many years. She lived in a house near her office\nwith her child and a female Filipino domestic worker.\nYuka answered very early during the interview that she\nconsidered herself as a single mother and benefited from the\nhelp of a domestic worker as her parents and closest family\nlived in another city, Osaka. Therefore, Yuka explained that\nshe did not have the option to receive the help of her parents\nin taking care of her daughter. She also commented that the\nchoice of a Filipino domestic worker became a natural alter-\nnative as her Filipino family friend had recommended to her\nsome potential domestic workers when her daughter was\nborne. It was then an option that she welcomed as she knew\nthat she wanted to continue her career. It had been asked to\nYuka if she had the knowledge of the employment of native\nJapanese domestic workers by her friends and acquaintances.\nShe admitted that she did not know any such working\narrangement. She commented that she was aware only of the\nemployment of domestic workers from Southeast Asia.\nThe unique quality of the case was her distinctive and\nunique profile of being exposed, due to her background and\nwork responsibilities, to both the Eastern and Western cul-\nture on a daily basis and therefore her ability to be critical\nand have a global vision of the topic of interest. She had the\nability to \"zoom in\" the Japanese culture and at the same\ntime \"zoom out\" in order to share her global understanding\nof the situation.\nData Collection\nIn January 2014, the main author was visiting Tokyo for the\npurpose of scientific research and had the opportunity to meet\nYuka. The data were collected through an in-depth interview\nafter informed consent was obtained. The interview lasted\napproximately 90 minutes in a private space at the workplace\nof Yuka. It was recorded, transcribed verbatim, checked\nagainst the original recording, and edited for accuracy. The\ninterview session began by asking Yuka to introduce herself\nand describe her marital and familial status, her working situ-\nation, education, and living condition. Then, nonleading\nquestions were asked about her own experience and general\nperception regarding economic-based migration to Japan,\nmore specifically the employment of female foreign domestic\nworkers as well as the role of Japanese women in the labor\nforce. Supplementary questions were asked with the purpose\n4 SAGE Open\nof clarifying some answers, such as \"Can you give me exam-\nples?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Interesting, please could you\ndevelop?\" \"You are telling me that . . . is it right or would you\nlike to add something that I missed?\" and so forth, that aimed\nto cover various aspects of her own experience, perception,\nand opinion about issues related to immigration and foreign\ndomestic work and women's employment.\nData Analysis\nThe data were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. The\ndata analysis is similarly reflexive and interactive as research-\ners continuously modify their treatment of data to accom-\nmodate new data and new insights about those data\nitative description method, two themes and six subthemes\nwere identified (Table 1).\nEthical Considerations\nThe data collection and presentation of the findings are sub-\nject to the principles of international ethical standards for\nconducting interviews with an informant capable of giving\ninformed consent to voluntarily participate in a study with a\ndescriptive design. Guidelines from Swedish Law (The\nSwedish Code of Statutes, 2003) were followed. The rele-\nvant ethical guidelines were applied such as autonomy,\nintegrity, and confidentiality of the informant and her sur-\nroundings when describing the result in accordance with The\nWorld Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (The\nResults\nIn this case study with a qualitative journalistic approach,\ntwo main themes, family permanency and group cohesive-\nness, and six subthemes presented below were identified.\nFamily Permanency\nExpectation. It was expressed several times by Yuka that mar-\nried women were expected primarily to be housewives. She\nexplained further that these women were sometimes employed\npart-time in low-paid jobs but that full-time career-related\nemployment was not common when the children were small.\nShe also said that it was expected that men would work full-\ntime and support the family financially. According to Yuka,\nthose expectations were tacit and not openly discussed. She\nadded that the precarious national economy, as Japan had\nbeen in recession for the last 20 years, had reinforced gender\nstereotyping in term of familial responsibility\nthere is some interest for more homogeneity between genders,\npredominantly coming from women, but for now people want to\nfeel safe and the home represents security for many people and\ntherefore we are expected to do what we are supposed to do\"\nMotherhood. Yuka repeatedly expressed that \"being a mother\"\nand \"acting as a mother\" was central in the life of Japanese\nwomen and it gave them a strong sense of identity. Two main\nrecurrent comments were made related to motherhood. The\nfirst one was the increasing wish from women to work part-\ntime mostly for the purpose of getting a social network. The\nsecond comment was the priority in their life of taking care of\ntheir child or children. Yuka concluded that, according to her\nobservations and despite the \"Japanese tradition,\" most inter-\nnational women she had met as well as Japanese women\nexpressed similar ambiguous and dual needs in regard to their\nrole as mothers. They wished to be available for their children\nwithout stress when they were small but also wished to work\nsome hours outside the home. She disclosed that she was\naware that most women she socialized with had no particular\nfinancial pressure and were privileged. However, she added\nthat in large cities like Tokyo, there was an increasing number\nof young female professionals who enjoyed their profession\nand wished for a career \" . . . then if they also want children\nand continue working, they have no choice and need to accept\nthe involvement of domestic workers . . . if their husband\nagrees to it of course.\"\nPrivacy. The privacy and the intimacy of the family life were\ndescribed as central in Japan. According to Yuka, it was\nuncommon for even wealthy Japanese families to have\ndomestic workers to take care of family members, and one of\nthe reasons was the risk to jeopardize family privacy \" . . .\naccepting somebody in your home and in your private life is\ndifficult. For mothers, it is very difficult as they are worried.\"\nHowever, she added that when domestic help was recruited,\nthose relatively wealthy families privileged foreign domestic\nemployment mainly from Southeast Asia. One motive was\nsurprisingly the advantage of the language barrier. As the\nJapanese language is difficult to master and understand for\nforeigners, it offers more privacy to these families.\nGroup Cohesiveness\nEconomy. Anxiety and reflections in regard to \"money\" and\nfinances were common during the interview. Yuka explained\nthat domestic help was unaffordable for most Japanese\nTable 1. The Themes and Subthemes Identified From the Data.\nThemes Subthemes\nFamily\npermanency\nExpectation\nMotherhood\nPrivacy\nGroup\ncohesion\nEconomy\nFear\nPride\nPaillard-Borg and Holmgren 5\nfamilies and only willing wealthy families could afford it so\nfar. According to Yuka, it reflected a clear social\u00adeconomic\ndilemma. When asked about the issues of national economy\nand immigration into the country, Yuka stated that she was\naware of the need for foreign skilled and unskilled workers\nbut that the nation, in general, was no ready or at least not\nopen to that possibility yet. She explained that it was largely\ndue to the recession that had been taking place for two\ndecades: \" . . . people are worried about the economy, they\nare aware of the world around Japan . . . but the world com-\ning to Japan and taking jobs and therefore increasing unem-\nployment is worrisome.\"\nFear.Yuka described multiple types of fears. One of them\nwas the fear of losing the Japanese traditions and values with\nthe arrival of immigrants to the country. The worry about\nincreased criminality was also a recurrent theme during the\ninterview as liberal immigration was synonym of criminality\nand danger. It was expressed several times that the Japanese\npeople rationalized their fear of immigration based on the\nperceived failure of the Western countries on the matter.\nPride.Pride was also an important theme during the inter-\nview. Pride was expressed in term of the \"higher sense of\nmorality in Japan compared to other countries\"; she added\nthat she believed that Japanese treated foreigners well: \" . . .\nbut in general in Japanese families, they treat foreign domes-\ntic help quite ok. It is not like in some countries . . . we are\ncivilized . . . \" According to Yuka, Japan was unique about\nhow well it treated its foreign workers and that she was proud\nof it. Another sense of pride explained by Yuka was that Jap-\nanese were \"too proud to work as domestic workers.\" Yuka\nexplained that this strong sense of pride prevented Japanese,\neven the unemployed ones sometimes to work as domestic\nworkers.\nDiscussion\nThe main findings of this study, family permanency and\ngroup cohesiveness, can contribute to understand the com-\nbined and controversial issues of immigration to Japan, most\noften of female domestic workers and female Japanese\nemployment from the perspective of a Japanese woman. The\nresults, based on the interview of a woman with a unique\nprofile, reveal the complexity surrounding the role of women\nliving in a country facing a super-aged society and a major\nsocietal mutation. The context of Japan is unique as it is an\nisland constantly under the threat of major natural disasters\ncausing thousands of deaths at a time and where national and\ncommunity identity is essential for its survival (Matthews,\n2003). The complex motivations behind individual and\ngroup actions in different cultural settings caused by natural\ndisasters are rarely analyzed and understood (Schlehe, 2008).\nAs any vulnerable group, the threat of the \"outsider\" is con-\nstant. Criminality, violence, and perversity of the social\nnorms are the implicit and explicit fears linked to immigra-\nvulnerability of Japan to its natural environment probably\nreinforces its need for traditions and social consistency. The\npivotal role of women in societies and the global feminiza-\ntion of migration emerge as the most important points based\non the main findings of this study, family permanency and\ngroup cohesiveness.\nThe Pivotal Role of Women\nAn increasing number of Japanese women, especially in\nurban settings, are questioning the lack of gender equality\nand choosing a career path instead of building a family; how-\never, in this \"modern Confucian family,\" women's traditional\nplace in the society is still highly valued (Makita, 2010;\nNorth, 2009). These conflicting and ambiguous expectations\nfrom the women themselves and the society in general chal-\nlenge family permanency and group cohesiveness. It appears\nthrough this study that Japanese women find themselves\nnowadays at a crossroad between the past and the future as\nwell as the Eastern and Western civilizations. As confirmed\nby Yuka, women are still central in the Japanese social order\nincarnating multiple roles ranging from \"mother, wife,\nhousehold manager and caregiver to elderly relatives\"\nsciously act as the guardians of the Japanese social consis-\ntency (Butterfield, 2014), while the symbols of patriarchal\nprestige continue to be very present (North, 2009). Traditions\ncolored by gender displays maintain the certainties of his-\ntorically contextualized gender identities and reproduced\ngender inequality (North, 2009). However, the pivotal role of\nwomen in informal care is present in many cultures. Women\nare often the glue holding social relations together and play a\ncentral role as friends, daughters, sisters, mothers, and grand-\nmothers throughout all stages of the life course (Bracke,\nChristiaens, & Wauterickx, 2008). Therefore, the role of the\nfemale domestic workers caring for Japanese families could\nalso become a pivotal role allowing Japanese women to work\noutside the home and still building a family and caring for\nthe elderly under the same roof.\nThe Global Feminization of Migration\nThis study has identified how the entangled issues of female\nimmigration and employment of Japanese women are closely\nrelated to the importance of family permanency and group\ncohesiveness in the Japanese society. Even though these\nresults cannot be generalized, it lifts the importance of these\nchallenges to a global level. Although the issues of immigra-\ntion and the role of women in the society are relatively new\nin Japan, it has been taking place for a long time in both the\ndeveloped and developing world. Globalization has acceler-\nated these issues and has made them even more complex\n(Browne & Braun, 2008a). As a world community, we\n6 SAGE Open\ncannot only discuss the impact of societal changes at a\nnational level but need to pursue a global perspective.\nTherefore, it is important to gain a better knowledge about\nthe increasing number of immigrant women coming to\ndeveloped nations to fulfill the workforce needs (Browne &\nBraun, 2008b). At the same time, it is crucial to examine in\nwhich way the migration of these immigrant women to Japan\nor other high-income countries impact their community\ncohesiveness and family permanency (Adanu & Johnson,\nfor Migration, 2013). In addition to the impact of migration\non their own community and family, it is relevant to wonder\nabout the condition of these immigrant women in the host\ncountry. Indeed, by empowering native women, Japanese\nwomen in the context of this study, immigrant women risk\nbecoming \"second-class citizens\" as they are triply disad-\nvantaged by race/ethnicity, their status as nonnationals, and\ngender inequalities. These concerns are legitimately feared\nby human rights organizations (Lee, 2005). The dynamic of\nimmigration and women's role are complex and need to be\nconsidered as much as possible with a global perspective\nwithout being fragmented. The feminization of migration\nremains among the least understood trends in migration lit-\nerature according to Hofmann and Buckley (2013). Most\noften, the issues related to female migration are investigated\nunilaterally through the situation of women migrants coming\nto a host country. In this study, the feminization of migration\nhas a bilateral interest as it lifts the importance of the interac-\ntion between the phenomenon of female migration and its\npotential impact on the lives of native women in relation to\nfamily permanency and group cohesiveness.\nConclusion\nJapan has the uniqueness to be a leap ahead in term of its\ndemographic challenges as well as its highly developed soci-\nety, and simultaneously a step behind in regard to the weight\nof ancestral traditions. The findings of this study show the\nintertwined issues of female immigration and employment of\nJapanese women. It appears that Japanese women find them-\nselves nowadays at an intersection between the past and the\nfuture as well as the East and the West. Furthermore, it\nemerges that the pivotal role of women in the Japanese soci-\nety and the global feminization of migration has a bilateral\ndynamic, in other words how the situation of some women\ncan impact other women in relation to family permanency\nand group cohesiveness.\n"
