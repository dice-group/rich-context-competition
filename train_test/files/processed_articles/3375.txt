    "abstract": "Abstract\nPeople with chronic illnesses can benefit from self-management education. However, those\nbenefits are said to decay over time (there is some evidence that this `decay of impact'does occur),\nand the reinforcements used to prevent that decay appear to be ineffective. We hypothesize that\nthe reinforcements appear to be ineffective because decay of impact occurs only in a subgroup of\nthese programs' participants, so any benefits of reinforcements in that subgroup are concealed by\nwhole-group summary statistics. We also hypothesize that reinforcements can benefit those who\nneed them \u00ad those who would otherwise have decay. One approach to testing these hypotheses\nrequires analysis of individual-level data, which is uncommon in this field. Some useful data could\ncome from studies that have already been completed, but the strongest evidence will require\nprospectively designed tests in future trials. If the hypotheses are false, then time and resources\nspent on reinforcements can be saved or redirected. If the hypotheses are true, then\nreinforcements can be implemented with less waste and they can be made more effective.\nThese programs can also be improved to better fit their users' needs, and there can be a new basis\nfor evaluating the programs' effectiveness.\n",

We\ndiscuss how the hypotheses can be tested,\nand we indicate some implications for\nresearch and for practice if they are true.\nIn the context of health education in\ngeneral, improvement followed by deterior-\nation (i.e. `decay of impact') was described\n35 years ago,6 and with regard to self-\nmanagement education it is still considered\nto be important.7 Decay after self-\nmanagement education is not universal.8\nStill, even though it has not been a primary\nobject of study, decay does seem to be\ncommon.9\u00ad15 To prevent or mitigate that\ndecay, reinforcements (`booster sessions')\nNonetheless, in the context of education\nfor self-management of chronic illnesses,\nreinforcements have been studied only occa-\nsionally, and their use has received almost no\nevidence-based support. In two studies of\narthritis self-management education, reinfor-\ncement had no effect.16,17 After a diabetes\nself-management intervention,18 telephone\nfollow-up did result in improvement on a\nbiological measure (lipid ratio) but it `did not\ngenerally produce meaningful incremental\neffects'. In that study, reinforcement was\ncounterproductive on psychosocial measures\n(particularly on the Chronic Illness\nResources survey), that is, it `appeared to\nproduce less improvement. . . than conditions\nnot receiving the telephone follow-up'. In a\ndifferent diabetes self-management program,\n`automated telephone reinforcement did not\nimprove the effectiveness' of the interven-\ntion,19 and neither did reinforcement via a\ndiscussion group for peer support.20 In the\nlatter study, two results were the opposite of\nwhat one would expect: patients who were\nrandomized to not receive reinforcement\nreported greater relief from health-related\ndistress, and the reduction in their depression\nwas also greater. In a pilot study of Internet-\nbased support for self-management of dys-\npnea, patients with chronic lung disease did\nnot benefit from a booster.21 This is not\nintended to be an exhaustive and systematic\nreview. The six studies cited above were found\nduring a search for evaluations of reinforce-\nments after chronic-illness self-management\nprograms. The format, timing, and content of\nthe self-management programs and of the\nreinforcements tested have certainly been\ndiverse, as have the populations studied and\nthe outcomes measured (see Appendix), and\nthe number of studies is small. Even with\nthose caveats in mind, evidence published to\ndate, overall, does not lead to the conclusion\nthat reinforcements are more useful than\nnon-reinforcement: in the context of self-\nmanagement education for people with\nchronic illnesses, claims that reinforcements\nare necessary and beneficial have little or no\nempirical basis.\nAre reinforcements to prevent or miti-\ngate the decay of impact really needed? If\nthey are needed, why have they not con-\nsistently resulted in better outcomes than\nnon-reinforcement? In this context, we cite\nthe statement by Lorig et al.22 indicating\nthat these programs' effects may appear to\nbe small because of important differences\namong the participants: `It should be noted\nthat the population is very heterogeneous\nfor disease, age, education and symptom\ndistribution. Thus group changes and\nmean effect sizes tend to be modest.'22\nThat explanation implies that the effect\nsizes will not be small if they are not based\non whole-group means. For example, there\nmay be subgroups with very small effects\nor perhaps zero effects, which would dilute\n(partly hide, efface, or obscure) large\neffects in other subgroups. If that is true,\nthen larger effects will be measured when\nhomogeneous subgroups are analyzed sep-\narately. Consistent with that idea, some\nanalyses of subgroups of patients have\nalready led to findings of potentially\nimportant differences between subgroups\n(such as Reeves et al.,23 Swerissen et al.,24\nSmeulders et al.25 and Nolte et al.26). In\none of those studies, three subgroups were\ndefined by their pattern of change after the\nintervention: substantial improvement, no\nchange, and substantial decline.26 A pos-\nsible fourth subgroup, one with decay of\nimpact, has not been studied, but it could\nexplain why some reinforcements appear to\nbe ineffective.\nThe hypotheses\nIf a subgroup of patients has decay of\nimpact, that pattern of change could\nbe hidden by other patterns of change in\nother subgroups. Furthermore, if effective\nreinforcements are given both to patients\nwho need them and to those who do not,\nthen the benefit to those who do need them\nwill be diluted by the lack of benefit to those\nwho do not. Therefore, we hypothesize that\ndecay of impact occurs in only a subgroup of\npatients. We also hypothesize that reinforce-\nments can benefit the patients who are most\nlikely to have decay of impact.\nThese hypotheses may be relevant to a\nvariety of interventions. While the preva-\nlence of decay and the need for reinforce-\nment could well differ between programs,\nwhat studies of those programs have in\ncommon is that whole-group summary\nstatistics can conceal large effects in sub-\ngroups. Imagine a health-education pro-\ngram that increases the frequency of\naerobic exercise. Its effect might last for 1\nyear in some patients and for only 3 months\nin others. In that case, even a successful\nreinforcement given 3 months after the\noriginal intervention would appear to have\nlittle or no effect unless data from the\nsubgroup at risk for decay of impact are\nanalyzed separately.\nTesting the hypotheses\nThese hypotheses can be tested using indi-\nvidual-level data. The first step is to cat-\negorize individual patients according to their\npattern of change: decay of impact,\nimprovement-only, deterioration-only, and\npossibly others. Each patient's classification\nwill depend on that patient's data rather\nthan on group data, and therefore the most\nuseful measures will be those with high\nUsing data that are as reliable as possible,\nthe researcher can classify each patient into\na pattern-defined subgroup.\nThe next step is to describe the prevalence\nand magnitude of the decay of impact.\nEvidence against the first hypothesis would\nbe a finding that none or almost none of the\npatients had decay of impact. In contrast,\nevidence consistent with that hypothesis\nwould be, for example, a finding that some\npatients had decay of impact and others did\nnot, and a finding that differences in long-\nterm outcomes between the decay-of-impact\nsubgroup and other subgroups are large. If\nmore than a few patients do have decay of\nimpact, and if that decay is large, then the\nnext step will be to look for demographic,\nclinical, and other predictors of having that\npattern of change, so that patients who are\nat a high risk of having decay of impact can\nbe identified before the decay begins.\nMany studies of these interventions have\nincluded only 2 waves of measurement, and\nfew have lasted longer than 6 months, but\nstudies of the decay of impact must include\nat least 3 waves of measurement and they\nmay also require longer follow-up.\nStudies of health-education programs can\ntake years of work and large budgets, but it\nmight be possible to test these hypotheses\nnow. If the outcome measures are suffi-\nciently reliable, and if the pitfalls of post hoc\nthen the hypotheses might be tested with\nexisting data from long-term studies that\nhave already been completed. The statistical\npower of those tests could be increased by\ncollaborative re-analysis of raw data.31,32\nRetrospective and exploratory\napproaches to testing the hypotheses could\nbe supplemented by approaches based on\nanalogies with theory and evidence from\nother contexts. One example is Rothman's\nclear distinction between a change in behav-\nior and maintenance of a new behavior.33 In\nthat theory, maintenance depends on satis-\nfaction with outcomes, so patients who are\ndissatisfied with short-term outcomes of a\nself-management program would be pre-\ndicted to have decay of impact, at least\nwith regard to health-related behaviors.\nAs another example, if the decay of\nimpact after these interventions is analogous\nin important ways to relapse after treatment\nfor addiction, then the large body of work\non predicting and preventing relapse (as\nreviewed by Hendershot et al.34) could be\napplied to predict who will have decay of\nimpact and also to design effective reinforce-\nments. Imagine again a health-education\nprogram that increases the frequency of\naerobic exercise. Some of the patients who\nexperienced that benefit might `backslide' in\nparticular situations: e.g. they might not\nmaintain their new exercise regimen after a\ntiring day at work, or when a family member\nneeds extra attention, or during an acute\nexacerbation of their chronic condition.\nEach such instance of decay of impact\ncould be analogous to relapse in a `high-\nrisk situation,' which has been a main focus\nof relapse-prevention research. In addition\nto high-risk situations, there are `back-\nground factors that determine an individ-\nual's `set point' or initial threshold for\nrelapse,' and one is self-efficacy,34 which is\nalso emphasized in many self-management\ninterventions for people with chronic ill-\nnesses, so it would be reasonable to test\nwhether self-efficacy and changes in self-\nefficacy can be used to predict decay of\nimpact. Another of those background\nfactors is social support: it is known to be\nimportant in relapse (as reviewed in\nWitkiewitz and Marlatt35) and its role in\ndecay of impact is worth studying.\nProspectively designed tests of both\nhypotheses can be included in future studies.\nIf the first hypothesis is supported, and if\npatients who are likely to have decay can be\nidentified early enough, then the second\nhypothesis can be tested. That is, the effects\nof reinforcements can be measured after\nthey are given only to those patients who are\npredicted to have decay, or, better still, to a\nrandomly selected group of them. The\nsecond hypothesis may be more difficult to\ntest than the first, at least in part because, as\nnoted above, self-management programs\nand reinforcements are diverse. There are\nmany possible combinations of frequency,\nformat, and content of reinforcements, but\nonly a few of them are likely to be rigorously\ntested, so it will be important to design\ncandidate reinforcements carefully. Here\nagain, previous findings and a reasonable\ntheoretical framework could be useful.\nRegarding timing, the work of Hennessy\net al.14 on education for HIV/AIDS preven-\ntion shows how analysis of the decay of\nimpact can inform decisions about when\nreinforcements should be given. Regarding\ncontent, relapse-prevention theory gives a\nlogical basis for testing reinforcements\ndesigned to maintain and enhance self-\nefficacy. Also, if Rothman's theory33 is\ncorrect (and recent research on weight loss\ndoes support it, e.g. Sciamanna et al.36) then\nreinforcements that merely repeat the con-\ntent of the original health-education pro-\ngram might be less effective than\nreinforcements that focus on `perceived sat-\nisfaction with received outcomes.'33\nAfter the hypotheses are tested\nEven if almost no patients are found to have\nsubstantial decay of impact, those who take\npart in these programs would still benefit,\nas the idea that reinforcement is unnecessary\nwould be supported, and resources that are\nnow used for reinforcements could be saved\nor redirected.\nIf, on the other hand, reinforcements are\nboth needed and effective for a subgroup of\npatients, therewillbeimplicationsforresearch,\nand also for how those reinforcements are\ndesigned and implemented. Overall, one goal\nwould be to minimize the costs of planning and\nimplementing reinforcements by offering them\npreferentially to the patients who are likely to\nneed them most. Another goal would be to\noptimize the target subgroup, format, timing,\nand content of reinforcements.\nWhile the reinforcements can be opti-\nmized, the original intervention might also\nbe improved to better fit the needs of\npatients who are likely to have decay of\nimpact. This would alter the criteria by\nwhich these programs are evaluated: more\nsuccessful programs would be those after\nwhich very few of the patients at risk for\ndecay of impact actually have it, and pro-\ngrams in which the decay is small.\n"
