    "abstract": "Abstract\nDespite older adolescence being a risk period for the development of mental health concerns, mental health service\nengagement is low among 16- to 18-year-olds. As therapeutic attendance is linked to clinical outcome, it is important\nto understand engagement in this population. There is a paucity of research looking specifically at the older adolescent\nengagement phenomenon. Previous qualitative research into adolescent experiences has provided rich and detailed results.\nInterpretative phenomenological analysis was chosen as the methodological approach. Ten 16- to 18-year-olds were recruited\nfrom two London-based child and adolescent mental health services. Each young person was interviewed to understand\nhis or her personal experience of engaging in mental health services, and associated engagement barriers and facilitators.\nInterviews were transcribed and underwent analysis. Analysis revealed ten subthemes subsumed within four superordinate\nthemes: engagement begins at help seeking, strength of inner resolve, evolution of the self and in the clinic room. Themes\nare discussed in detail. Conclusions are drawn in relation to previous theory and research. When considering 16- to 18-year\nunderstandings of the engagement phenomena, key elements include clinician and service developmental appropriateness,\nnegotiation of developmental tasks in relation to engagement, experience of the physical building environment, and\nawareness of service policy. Suggestions for clinical practice in relation to engagement facilitators and threat are made, and\nrecommendations for future research proposed.\n",

A large propor-\ntion of service \"dropouts\" occur around 16 to 18 years old\n(Singh, Paul, Ford, Kramer, & Weaver, 2008). Traditionally,\nchild and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) pro-\nvide interventions for young people up to 18 years. To ensure\nappropriate service provision, policy suggests CAMHS are\nresponsive to client's developmental stage (Department for\nChildren, Schools and Families [DCSF] & Department of\nEngagement in services may be an important part of effec-\ntive mental health treatment (YoungMinds, 2014). Elements\nhypothesized to be part of engagement (e.g., King, Currie, &\nPetersen, 2014), such as the therapeutic relationship (Shirk &\nKarver, 2003), may be linked to treatment outcome. For older\nadolescents, service engagement could be a challenge (Royal\nCollege of Psychiatrists, 2012).Alongside experiencing mental\ndistress, they may also be faced with societal (e.g., stigma;\nEisenberg, Downs, Golberstein, & Zivin, 2009), familial\nsures. In addition, 16 to 18 years is a potential time of transition\nbetween CAMHS and adult mental health services (AMHS),\nwhich may impose its own challenges (National Institute for\nHealth and Care Excellence [NICE], 2016; Singh, Evans,\nDespite this, little is known theoretically and specifically\nabout 16- to 18-year-old engagement. Definitions have been\nproposed for children, families, and the whole adolescent age\nrange(e.g.,Cunningham,Duffee,Huang,Steinke,&Naccarato,\n1Canterbury Christchurch University, Tunbridge Wells, UK\n2South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nAlex Hassett, Canterbury Christ Church University, Runcie Court,\nBroomhill Road, Southborough TN3 0TF, UK.\nEmail: alex.hassett@canterbury.ac.uk\nExperiences of Engaging With Mental\nHealth Services in 16- to 18-Year-Olds: An\nInterpretative Phenomenological Analysis\nSiobhan Jones1, Alex Hassett1, and Irene Sclare2\n Keywords\nengagement, adolescents, mental health services\n2 SAGE Open\nturning up\" (Gopalan et al., 2010) or \"dropping out\" (Johnson,\nMellor, & Brann, 2008). More comprehensive definitions\nincorporate multiple elements such as behavioral (e.g., atten-\ndance) and attitudinal (e.g., emotional investment in treatment)\ncomponents (Staudt, 2007), as well as considering the facilitat-\ning role of the therapeutic relationship (see King et al., 2014,\nbelow). However, definitions lack consensus (Kim, Munson, &\nMcKay, 2012), and are not specific to the older adolescence.\nHelp-seeking definitions also incorporate elements of engage-\nment, such as seeking professional help (e.g., Rickwood,\nDeane, Wilson, & Ciarrochi, 2005), meaning the overlap\nbetween the two is apparent but undefined. Theoretical prog-\nress may be hindered because of unclear definition (Drieschner,\nModels applicable to adolescent engagement are limited\nbut some have been developed. King et al. (2014) proposed a\nchild and adolescent motivational model. This focuses on\nongoing engagement within treatment, from a therapeutic\nrelational perspective, considering hope and confidence to be\nkey. Both client and therapist bring emotional, behavioral,\nand cognitive elements to engagement, suggesting responsi-\nbility for engagement is not solely with one party. This model\nis not specific to older adolescents, and the fluctuating nature\nof engagement (Donnellan, Murray, & Harrison, 2012) is not\naccounted for.\nBroome, Joe, and Simpson (2001) developed a model for\nyoung people who experience substance misuse. Multifaceted\nelements of engagement are incorporated such as \"background\nfactors\" (e.g., family), treatment readiness, and session attri-\nbutes (e.g., therapeutic involvement). The generalizability of\nthis model outside of a substance-misuse population may be\nlimited. Barriers to treatment, for children, adolescents, and\ntheir families, have also been considered. The ecological point\nof view model (McKay, Gonzales, Stone, Ryland, & Kohner,\n1995), coming from a family therapy perspective, suggests\nthat barriers can exist at multiple levels (e.g., individual, com-\nmunity), acknowledging the role of the \"ecosystem\" in\nengagement. The Barriers to Treatment Model (Kazdin,\nHolland, & Crowley, 1997) proposes difficult familial rela-\ntions with therapists may contribute to treatment termination.\nThese models highlight the role of families in engagement;\nhowever, they do not focus on the unique experiences of 16- to\n18-year-olds, where families, communities, and so forth may\nbe positioned differently. Research suggests adolescents may\nprefer peer support (e.g., Raviv, Raviv, Vago-Gefen, & Fink,\n2009). Indeed, peers and perceived impact on self-esteem\n(e.g., threats to self-esteem model; Fisher, Nadler, & Whitcher-\nThe above models were developed through a process of\nscoping review, interview through predetermined outcome\nmeasures, or interview with parents (see Broome et al., 2001;\nappears consultation with adolescents was absent. These con-\nceptualizations are markedly adult centric in understanding,\nand, therefore, lack an adolescent-specific phenomenological\nfocus. Attempting to understand young people through adap-\ntations of developmentally inappropriate models may hinder\ntheoretical progress (Weisz & Hawley, 2002).\nEmpirical research related to the adolescent engagement\nphenomenon has been extensive. However, this tends to\nfocus on individual elements related to engagement, such as\nbeliefs and expectations (e.g., Rickwood, Deane, & Wilson,\ninterventions (see Kim et al., 2012, for review), disengage-\nment (e.g., Schimmelmann, Conus, Schacht, McGorry, &\nfor review), rather than engagement in its entirety from the\nadolescent perspective. The closed, measure-led, and adult-\ncentric nature of these studies may have limited exploration\nof the engagement phenomena beyond that prescribed by\nthe selected questionnaires and the research investigators.\nInvestigating older adolescent understandings of engage-\nment as a whole, including the barriers and facilitators sug-\ngested above, from the young person's perspective\n(YoungMinds, 2005), may allow for a deeper exploration,\nand understanding.\nSome related research has adopted a more adolescent-led\napproach. These studies tend to use a qualitative methodol-\nogy and have generated interesting and rich results. Harper,\nDickson, and Bramwell (2014) investigated young people's\nexperiences of a 16- to 18-year-old mental health service as\na whole. Themes emerged around young people valuing ther-\napeutic relationships and the service meeting developmental\nneeds. Adolescent understandings of engagement experi-\nences were not explicitly discussed. Bury, Raval, and Lyon's\n(2007) interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA)\ninvestigation looked at adolescent experiences throughout a\ncourse of psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Engagement\nthemes were evident but not explored in depth. The article\nsuggested paying attention to client views of psychotherapy,\nand issues around control and power might help improve ini-\ntial engagement. This study focused on one therapeutic\nmodality and did not take into account wider issues such as\nservice provision, which may also affect engagement\nUsing IPA as part of a mixed-methods investigation,\nKapur et al. (2014) looked directly into service engagement\namong two young people who experienced voice hearing,\nand their parents. Superordinate themes included battling\nwith mental health services and frustration with received\ncare. However, one participant was 11 years old, and parent's\nexperiences were included, meaning the study was not\nwholly older adolescent specific. In addition, the focus was\nlimited to one specific mental health presentation. As illus-\ntrated, the use of qualitative methods may facilitate in-depth\nand rich investigations to occur (Smith, Flowers, & Larkin,\n2009), including when recruiting adolescent participants\nJones et al. 3\nTo date, in-depth exploration of 16- to 18-year-old under-\nstandings of their service engagement experiences, facilita-\ntors, and barriers, has not been conducted. Research into\nolder adolescent-specific understandings will contribute to a\nlacking evidence base. To ensure services are responsive to\nthe population they serve, it is essential to understand the\nunique needs and views of the targeted client group.\nInvestigation could contribute to the effective development\nof older adolescent tailored services, which may positively\naffect therapeutic outcomes. By engaging young people\neffectively in services, we may be able to prevent more seri-\nous and enduring problems later on in life (Birchwood &\nResearch Aims and Questions\nThe need for further investigation is highlighted by three\ncoexisting issues: the rise in mental health concerns in older\nadolescence, the high service drop rate at this age, and the\npaucity of research into 16- to 18-year-old engagement. The\ncurrent study aimed to explore older adolescent sense making\nof their engagement experiences, barriers, and facilitators, to\ncontribute to a sparse understanding. Research questions\nwere as follows:\nResearch Question 1: What is the 16- to 18-year-olds\nunderstanding of their experience of engaging in mental\nhealth services?\nResearch Question 2: What is their understanding of\ntheir experience of engagement facilitators and engage-\nment barriers?\nMethod\nResearch Design and Methodology\nTo aid in-depth exploration of the 16- to 18-year-old engage-\nment phenomena, a nonexperimental, descriptive design was\nchosen. Due to the paucity and \"adult-led\" nature of previous\nresearch, and taking example from prior study designs that\ngenerated rich data, a qualitative methodology was used.\nIPA (Smith, 1996) was chosen as the methodological\napproach. Informed by philosophical understandings of phe-\nnomenology, hermeneutics, and ideography (Smith et al.,\n2009), IPA enables insight to be developed into specific sub-\njective meanings and interpretations people make of an expe-\nrienced phenomena. This meant in-depth understanding of\nthe 16- to 18-year-olds idiosyncratic sense making of their\nengagement experience could be generated.\nParticipants\nInclusion and exclusion criteria were developed to facili-\ntate recruitment of a homogeneous sample (Hefferon &\nGil-Rodriquez, 2011) while ensuring an understanding of\nengagement could be ascertained across adolescent expe-\nriences. The reason for focusing on the 16- to 18-year-old\nstage is that this is the period, when societally, adolescents\nbegin to be defined as \"adult\" and, alongside this, separa-\ntion from caregivers is an increasingly prominent issue. It\nis, therefore, important to understand how this relates to\nengagement with services, especially as previous models\nof help seeking/engagement (also mentioned in the\n\"Introduction\" section) have highlighted the importance\nof caregivers in accessing help. Research has also sug-\ngested that there is a shift developmentally, across adoles-\ncence, when it comes to help seeking/engagement\nInclusion criteria were as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 engaged with mental health services at interview.\nEngagement was defined as having been offered, and\nwas attending appointments (e.g. McKay & Bannon,\nExclusion criteria were as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 active psychosis,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 significant developmental delay, and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 significant risk issues\nTen participants (Table 1) were recruited from two CAMHS\nservices in London. All adolescents approached were inter-\nviewed and none ceased participation in the study. A small\nnumber of participants allowed for in-depth, rich data gather-\ning and analysis. The sample size was in line with recom-\nmendations (Smith et al., 2009) and commensurate with\nprevious IPA research (e.g., Colton & Pistrang, 2004; Huws\nEthical approval. Ethical approval was requested and granted\nby an NHS Research Ethics Committee. Research and devel-\nopment, and CAMHS research approval, was granted by the\nrecruiting NHS Trust. The British Psychological Society\n(BPS; 2013) code of human research ethics was followed.\nRisk precautions.All interviews took place during clinic\nhours and the researcher familiarized themselves with ser-\nvice risk protocol. Participant's clinicians were made aware\nof interview timings. Due to the potentially sensitive nature\nof the interview content, participants were informed of avail-\nable support if they became distressed after leaving the ser-\nvice building.\nRecruitment. Recruitment took place over 6 months. The\nresearcher advertised the study in team meetings. Partici-\npants who met inclusion/exclusion criteria were identified by\ntheir clinician, and invited to take part at their next therapy\nsession. If the adolescent showed interest, they were asked\n4 SAGE Open\nby their clinician to provide verbal consent for their contact\ndetails to be passed on to the researcher. Initial contact was\nmade by telephone. Participants were invited to attend an\nintroductory session (after a therapy session for participant\nease) to read through the participant information sheet (PIS)\nand ensure they understood enough about the study to make\nan informed decision to participate. This was ascertained\nby asking them to repeat back what they understood about\nthe study and their participation. If this was demonstrated,\nparticipants were invited back for a second meeting to sign\nthe consent form and be interviewed. All participants dem-\nonstrated understanding and were invited back. A \u00a310 high\nstreet voucher was given for participation.\nInterviews.Data collection was via 1:1 semistructured\ninterview. This provided a tentative framework but allowed\nfor open conversation about the engagement phenomena,\nencouraging the participant to set the parameters of the\ndiscussion. The interview questions revolved around the\nfollowing key areas: the young person's experience of\ncoming to the service; what they felt helped them to keep\ncoming back and what would make them not want to attend\nthe service. To ensure adolescent understanding of the\nschedule, PIS, and consent form, a group of five 16- to\n18-year-olds, from a local school, were consulted. Two\nCAMHS-based clinical psychologists reviewed the final\nschedule to ensure relevance to the research questions. At\nthe beginning of each interview, participants were reminded\ntheir participation was voluntary and were free to leave at\nany time. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed for\nanalysis, and anonymized. Interviews lasted between 30\nTable 1.

CAMHS = child and adolescent mental health services; CBT = cognitive behavioural therapy.\nJones et al. 5\nAnalysis\nTranscripts were analyzed following IPA protocol (Smith\net al., 2009). To become familiar with the data, transcripts\nwere read while listening to the audio recording. This allowed\nfor linguistic or verbal nuances to be ascertained. Transcripts\nwere then reread to ensure full immersion in the data, gather-\ning an overall understanding of how different sections were\nconnected and emerged.\nAlongside the data, detailed notes were made on descrip-\ntive, conceptual, and linguistic understandings and explora-\ntions.Thehermeneuticcyclewasexperiencedasinterpretations\nwere made on participant understandings of their engagement\nexperience, while remaining close to the original meaning.\nThe initial noting was read through closely and themes\ndeveloped. These emerged by focusing on discrete chunks of\ndata, while keeping in mind the interview as a whole. The\ndeveloped emergent themes attempted to reflect the com-\nplexity of the data while drawing out key ideas.\nEmergent themes were typed into a word document, in\nchronological order. Through a process of abstraction, themes\nwere moved around the page, drawing together related items.\nEmerging patterns were developed into superordinate themes.\nThe iterative nature of analysis was experienced, returning to\nthe original transcript to ensure superordinate themes reflected\nthe original data.\nTo move onto the next transcript, ideas from the previous\ninterview were bracketed by noting assumptions and ideas\ndeveloped from the analysis. This process was repeated for\nall transcripts.\nAll emergent and superordinate themes were printed, cut\nout, and laid on a large surface. Themes were moved around,\nusing the abstraction process, until patterns and commonali-\nties emerged. The hermeneutic and double-hermeneutic\ncycle was experienced as higher order concepts were devel-\noped and variance among individuals noted. Concepts were\ntyped out and quotes collected from the transcripts. Following\nrecommendations (Smith et al., 2009), the recurrence of the\nhigher order concepts was considered in table form. Themes\nthat did not occur in 50% of participants, or above, were\nremoved. Remaining overarching, and embedded themes,\nwere retained. Smith et al. (2009) state the analytic process\nmay continue into the writing of results. Themes were recon-\nsidered and revised as writing continued.\nQuality Assurance\nTo ensure quality and validity, Mays and Pope's (2000) crite-\nria was followed. To assess analytic reliability, investigator\ntriangulation took place. Four transcripts were analyzed and\ncoded separately by two research supervisors. These were\nchecked against the original coding by the main researcher.\nThere was no full disagreement on emergent themes. Minor\ndiscrepancies around theme meanings were discussed to\nensure intercoder reliability (Yardley, 2000).\nThe role of prior assumptions and personal characteristics\nwere reflected upon and discussed with a research supervi-\nsor. The impact of age difference was considered. It was\nobserved that some participants mentioned difficulties with\nopening up to adults, fearing judgment. In addition, the\nresearcher had prior assumptions, from personal and profes-\nsional experience, that adolescents may have been reluctant\nto engage with the interview process. By participating in the\ninterview, the adolescent was experiencing a separate\nengagement process with the researcher. It was wondered\nhow this may have affected the participant, and researcher's\nresponses, especially in the earlier stages of the interview.\nAs interviews progressed, positioning and power dynam-\nics between researcher and adolescent were noted. Reflexive\nconversations focused on how participants may have\nexpressed, or altered, their opinions about clinicians or ser-\nvices. They may have assumed the researcher would feed-\nback to his or her clinician, or alter his or her perception of\nthe participant (despite being informed of the confidentiality\nprocess), giving more socially desirable responses.\nBefore recruitment began, a bracketing interview was\nconducted with a trainee clinical psychologist about personal\nor professional assumptions and experiences. This bracket-\ning interview, discussion with supervisors, and keeping a\nresearch diary were used to reflect on and work with these\nassumptions. Following each interview and transcript analy-\nsis, notes were made, to allow for biases or assumptions to be\ndiscussed or thought through. The limitations of this process\nble it can be to \"truly\" bracket off assumptions.\nAttention was paid to cases, or sections of transcripts,\nwhich \"deviated\" from emerging themes, by disconfirming\nor contradicting analysis. This aided a process of broadening\nand refining themes.\nResults\nAnalysis resulted in four superordinate themes, which sub-\nsumed 10 subthemes (Table 2). Superordinate themes were\nengagement begins at help seeking, strength of inner resolve,\nevolution of the self, and in the clinic room.\nTheme 1. Engagement Begins at Help Seeking\nThis superordinate theme conceptualizes engagement as\nbeginning at help seeking. All 10 participants discussed their\nhelp-seeking journey to aid sense making of their engage-\nment experiences. The boundary between the two may be\noverlapping for adolescents.\nReliance on adult "
