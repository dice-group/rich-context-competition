Kessler, PhD\nContext: There is growing recognition that bipolar dis-\norder (BPD) has a spectrum of expression that is sub-\nstantially more common than the 1% BP-I prevalence tra-\nditionally found in population surveys.\nObjective: To estimate the prevalence, correlates, and\ntreatment patterns of bipolar spectrum disorder in the\nUS population.\nDesign: Direct interviews.\nSetting: Households in the continental United States.\nParticipants: A nationally representative sample of 9282\nEnglish-speaking adults (aged 18 years).\nMain Outcome Measures: Version 3.0 of the World\nHealth Organization's Composite International Diagnos-\ntic Interview, a fully structured lay-administered diag-\nnostic interview, was used to assess DSM-IV lifetime and\n12-month Axis I disorders. Subthreshold BPD was de-\nfined as recurrent hypomania without a major depres-\nsive episode or with fewer symptoms than required for\nthreshold hypomania. Indicators of clinical severity in-\ncluded age at onset, chronicity, symptom severity, role\nimpairment, comorbidity, and treatment.\nResults: Lifetime (and 12-month) prevalence esti-\nand 2.4% (1.4%) for subthreshold BPD. Most respon-\ndents with threshold and subthreshold BPD had life-\ntime comorbidity with other Axis I disorders, particu-\nlarly anxiety disorders. Clinical severity and role\nimpairment are greater for threshold than for subthresh-\nold BPD and for BP-II than for BP-I episodes of major\ndepression, but subthreshold cases still have moderate\nto severe clinical severity and role impairment. Al-\nthough most people with BPD receive lifetime profes-\nsional treatment for emotional problems, use of anti-\nmanic medication is uncommon, especially in general\nmedical settings.\nConclusions: This study presents the first prevalence es-\ntimates of the BPD spectrum in a probability sample of\nthe United States. Subthreshold BPD is common, clini-\ncally significant, and underdetected in treatment set-\ntings. Inappropriate treatment of BPD is a serious prob-\nlem in the US population. Explicit criteria are needed to\ndefine subthreshold BPD for future clinical and re-\nsearch purposes.\nprevalence of bipolar dis-\norder (BPD) in population\nsurveys using structured di-\nagnostic interviews and\nstandardized criteria is approximately\nspite this comparatively low prevalence,\nBPD is a leading cause of premature mor-\ntality due to suicide and associated medi-\ncal conditions, such as diabetes mellitus\nand cardiovascular disease.9,10 Also, BPD\nThe recurrent nature of manic and depres-\nsive episodes often leads to high direct and\nThe large discrepancy between rates of\nBPD found in large-scale community sur-\nveys1-8 and those derived from prospec-\ntive longitudinal studies15 suggests that life-\ntimeprevalenceestimatesfromcommunity\nsurveys may underestimate the true preva-\nlence of BPD.

Therefore, the societal burden of BPD might be far\ngreater than currently estimated because of the lack of\ninclusion of subthreshold BPD.\nThe purpose of this study is to present the rates and\ntreatment patterns of bipolar spectrum disorder in the\n  (NCS-R),17 a\nstudy of a nationally representative sample of the United\nStates.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe NCS-R is a nationally representative survey of mental dis-\norders in English-speaking household residents 18 years and\nolder in the continental United States. Interviews were con-\nApril 2003. Verbal informed consent was obtained before data\ncollection. Consent was verbal rather than written to maintain\nconsistency with the baseline NCS. The response rate was\n70.9%. Respondents were given a $50 incentive for participa-\ntion. A probability subsample of hard-to-recruit predesignated\nrespondents was administered a brief telephone nonrespon-\ndent survey, and results were used to weight the main sample\nfor nonresponse bias. Nonrespondent survey participants were\ngiven a $100 incentive. The human subjects committees of\nHarvard Medical School and the University of Michigan, Ann\nArbor, approved these recruitment and consent procedures.\nThe NCS-R interview was administered in 2 parts. Part I\nincluded a core diagnostic assessment of all respondents\n(N=9282). Part II included questions about correlates and\nadditional disorders administered to all part I respondents who\nmet the lifetime criteria for any core disorder plus a probability\ndetailed discussion of NCS-R sampling and weighting is pro-\nThe NCS-R diagnoses are based on Version 3.0 of the World\nHealth Organization's Composite International Diagnostic In-\nterview (CIDI),19 a fully structured, lay-administered diagnos-\ntic interview. The DSM-IV criteria were used to define mania\n(duration 1 week), hypomania (duration 4 days), and ma-\njor depressive episode (MDE). The requirement that symptoms\ndo not meet the criteria for a mixed episode (criterion C for ma-\nnia/hypomania and criterion B for MDE) was not operational-\nized in making these diagnoses. Respondents were classified as\nhaving lifetime BP-I if they ever had a manic episode and as\nhaving lifetime BP-II if they ever had a hypomanic but not\nmanic episode and ever had an episode of MDE. The number of\nlifetime episodes of mania/hypomania and MDE may be over-\nestimated because we did not assess mixed episodes and the\nrapid cycling subtype of BPD.\nClassification of subthreshold BPD included any of the fol-\nlowing: (1) recurrent subthreshold hypomania (2 criterion\nB symptoms and all other criteria for hypomania) in the pres-\nence of intercurrent MDE, (2) recurrent (2 episodes) hypo-\nmania in the absence of recurrent MDE with or without sub-\nthreshold MDE, and (3) recurrent subthreshold hypomania in\nthe absence of intercurrent MDE with or without subthresh-\nold MDE. The number of required symptoms for a determina-\ntion of subthreshold hypomania was confined to 2 criterion B\nsymptoms (from the DSM-IV requirement of 3, or 4 if the\nmood is only irritable) to retain the core features of hypoma-\nnia in the subthreshold definition. Recurrent hypomania or\nsubthreshold hypomania in the absence of intercurrent MDE\nwas included in the definition because it is part of the DSM-IV\ndefinition of BPD not otherwise specified. For the present\nstudy, we define the BPD spectrum as a lifetime history of\nBP-I, BP-II, or subthreshold BPD as defined previously herein.\nAll diagnoses excluded cases with plausible organic causes.\nAge at onset of manic/hypomanic episodes and of MDEs was\nassessed using retrospective self-reports at the syndrome level.\nRespondents classified as having lifetime BPD were defined as\n12-month cases if they had an episode of MDE, mania, hypo-\nmania, or subthreshold hypomania at any time in the 12 months\nbefore interview. Persistence was assessed by asking respon-\ndents to estimate the number of years in their life in which they\nhad a manic or hypomanic episode and, separately, the num-\nber of years in which they had an MDE. Clinical reappraisal\ninterviews for BPD using the lifetime nonpatient version of the\nStructured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)20 were ad-\nministered to a probability subsample of 50 NCS-R respon-\ndents. This was a special clinical reappraisal sample that fo-\ncused exclusively on BPD and was distinct from the larger clinical\nreappraisal sample used to assess the validity of more com-\nmon DSM-IV disorders.21\nThe CIDI cases were oversampled in the BPD clinical reap-\npraisal sample, and the data were weighted for this over-\nsampling. As described in more detail elsewhere,22 CIDI-SCID\nconcordance was excellent for any BPD (ie, BP-I, BP-II, or sub-\nthreshold BPD), with a  of 0.94, a positive predictive value\n(percentage of CIDI cases confirmed using the SCID) of 0.88,\na negative predictive value (percentage of CIDI noncases con-\nfirmed as not being cases using the SCID) of 1.0, and nonsig-\nnificant McNemar test findings (2\ntest evaluates whether the CIDI prevalence estimate differs sig-\nnificantly from the SCID prevalence estimate. Concordances\n() for individual diagnoses were lower but still acceptable: 0.88\nfor BP-I, 0.50 for BP-II, and 0.51 for subthreshold BPD, whereas\ntively. Negative predictive values were consistently greater than\n0.99, and the McNemar test value was consistently nonsignifi-\nSymptom severity was assessed in 12-month cases using a\nself-report version of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)23\nfor mania/hypomania and the Quick Inventory of Depressive\nSymptomatology Self-Report (QIDS-SR)24 for MDE. The YMRS\nwas based on a fully structured respondent report version de-\nveloped for parent reports.25 Severity was assessed for the month\nin the past year when symptoms of either mania or depression\nwere most severe. Standard YMRS and QIDS-SR cutoff points\nwere used to define episodes as severe (including original YMRS\nand QIDS-SR ratings of very severe, with ratings in the range\nYMRS and 6-10 on the QIDS-SR), or not clinically significant\n(0-8 on the YMRS and 0-5 on the QIDS-SR). We did not col-\nlect data on differences in the accuracy of recall for the 12 months\nused in the present study compared with those of the QIDS-SR\n(30 days) and the YMRS (7 days).\nRole impairment in 12-month cases was assessed using the\nSheehan Disability Scale.26 As with the YMRS and the QIDS-\nSR, in the Sheehan Disability Scale, the respondents were\nasked to focus on the 1 month in the past year when their\nmania/hypomania or MDE symptoms were most severe.\nRespondents rated the degree to which the condition inter-\nfered with their home management, work, social life, and per-\nsonal relationships using a visual analog scale from 0 to 10\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.

Organic exclu-\nsion rules and diagnostic hierarchy rules were used in making\nall diagnoses. As detailed elsewhere,21,27 blinded clinical re-\npeated interviews using the nonpatient version of the SCID20\nwith a probability subsample of NCS-R respondents found gen-\nerally good concordance between CIDI/DSM-IV diagnoses of\nanxiety, mood, and substance use disorders and independent\nclinical assessments. Impulse-control disorder diagnoses were\nnot validated because the SCID clinical reappraisal interviews\ndid not include an assessment of these disorders.\nLifetime and 12-month treatment were also assessed by the spe-\ncialty of the health care professional, including psychiatrists,\nother mental health professionals, general medical providers,\nhuman services professionals, and complementary and alter-\nnative medicine providers. Specific medications were also col-\nlected for those who endorsed treatment during the past 12\nmonths. Mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, and antipsychot-\nics were classified as appropriate medications for BPD. Anti-\ndepressants and other psychotropic medications in the ab-\nsence of antimanic agents were classified as inappropriate.\nTwelve-month treatment was assessed separately for respon-\ndents with 12-month BPD and for those with lifetime but not\n12-month BPD (ie, maintenance treatment). Appropriateness\nof medication was examined separately for those being treated\nby a psychiatrist and a general medical provider.\nnon-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other), educational level (less\nthan high school, completed high school, some college, and com-\npleted college), and occupation (professional, technical, service-\nclerical, and labor) for the average expected hours of work per\nSubgroup comparisons were used to study lifetime prevalence\nand persistence of BP-I, BP-II, and subthreshold BPD. Age-at-\nonset distributions were estimated using the 2-part actuarial\nmethod implemented using a software program (SAS 8.2; SAS\nInstitute Inc, Cary, NC).28 The actuarial method differs from\nthe more familiar Kaplan-Meier29 method in using a more ac-\ncurate way of estimating the timing of onsets in a given year.30\nThe actuarial method, similar to the Kaplan-Meier method, as-\nsumes constant conditional risk of onset at a given year of life\nacross cohorts. Persistence was examined by calculating means\nand interquartile ranges of reported years in episode, number\nof lifetime episodes, and the proportion of lifetime episodes that\nwere manic/hypomanic vs MDE. Comorbidity was assessed by\ncalculating odds ratios between BPD and other CIDI/DSM-IV\ndisorders. Clinical severity, severity of role impairment, and treat-\nment were examined by calculating distributions within the BPD\nsubgroups. Because the NCS-R sample design used weighting\nand clustering, all statistical analyses were performed using the\nTaylor series linearization method,31 a design-based method\nimplemented using a software system (SUDAAN version 8.01;\nRTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC). Significance\ntests of sets of coefficients were performed using Wald 2 tests\nbased on design-corrected coefficient variance-covariance ma-\ntrices. Statistical significance was evaluated using 2-sided design-\nbased .05-level tests.\nRESULTS\nLifetime prevalence estimates are 1.0% for BP-I, 1.1% for\nBP-II, 2.4% for subthreshold BPD, and 4.4% overall\n(Table 1). Sex-specific (male and female) prevalence es-\nBP-II, and 2.6% and 2.1% for subthreshold BPD. Ap-\nproximately one third (36.7%) of subthreshold cases have\na history of recurrent subthreshold hypomania in the pres-\nence of MDEs, whereas 41.9% have a history of recur-\nrent hypomania in the absence of recurrent MDEs. The\nremaining 21.4% have a history of recurrent subthresh-\nold hypomania in the absence of MDEs. Twelve-month\nprevalence estimates are 0.6% for BP-I, 0.8% for BP-II,\nand 1.4% for subthreshold BPD.\nMean retrospectively reported age at onset of the first\nmanic/hypomanic or major depressive episode is some-\nthan for subthreshold BPD (22.2 years). The interquar-\ntile range (25th-75th percentiles of the cumulative age-\nat-onset distribution) is between the late teens and the\nearly 40s for all 3 disorders, with the increase in cumu-\nlative lifetime prevalence being fairly linear in that age\nrange (Figure). Persistence, indirectly indicated by the\nratio of 12-month prevalence to lifetime prevalence, is\nTable 1.

More detailed analysis (results\navailable on request) showed that low persistence of sub-\nthreshold BPD is limited to participants without a his-\ntory of MDE. The ratio of lifetime manic/hypomanic epi-\nsodes to total episodes is in the range of 0.5 to 0.6 for\nrespondents with lifetime BP-I or BP-II and consider-\nably higher (0.8) for subthreshold BPD due to the inclu-\nsion of hypomania in the absence of MDE. Twelve-\nmonth ratios are similar to lifetime ratios.\nThe sociodemographic correlates of BPD in the NCS-R\nare modest in magnitude but fairly consistent across the\nBPD spectrum. Bipolar disorder is inversely related to age\nand educational level and is elevated in previously mar-\nried individuals compared with the currently married\n(only for subthreshold BPD) and in the unemployed-\ndisabled compared with the employed.

Odds ratios of BPD with individual dis-\norders are uniformly significant and generally higher\nthreshold BPD (2.2-5.0). An exception is odds ratios\nwith substance use disorders being much higher for\nBP-I than for either BP-II or subthreshold BPD.

The direct association between increasingly re-\nstrictive definitions of BPD and the indicators of clinical\nvalidity, including number of episodes, chronicity, symp-\ntom severity, impairment, comorbidity, and treat-\nment,1,34-36 provides evidence of the underlying dimen-\nsional nature of bipolar illness. For example, the severity\nof work impairment increased from 19.8% for subthresh-\nseverity of manic/hypomanic episodes rose from 31.5%\nLikewise, the mean age at onset ranged from 18.2 years\nthreshold BPD subgroup, and the estimated average num-\nII, and 32.0 for subthreshold BPD. Although these\nretrospective estimates may reflect recall bias to some ex-\ntent, they are still within the range of estimates reported\nin prospective studies and family studies.37,38 Since the\nmean age at onset of BPD occurs at one of the most criti-\ncal periods of educational, occupational, and social de-\nvelopment, its consequences often lead to lifelong dis-\nability. Not only does the disorder begin at an early age\nbut affected individuals spend an average of a decade of\ntheir lives in episodes of illness.\nThe prevalence estimate of subthreshold BPD in the\nNCS-R is broadly consistent with the findings of 2 large\ncommunity epidemiologic surveys in Europe.39,40 How-\never, it is likely to be a lower bound because we did not\ninclude reduced duration of hypomanic episodes. The\nNCS-R results clearly document the clinical significance\nof subthreshold BPD, as most subthreshold cases had mod-\nerate-severe symptom profiles and role impairment based\non standard rating scales. As might be expected, there was\nlower episode persistence and a lower severe-moderate ra-\ntio in subthreshold vs threshold cases. Consistent with pre-\nvious research,15 the proportions of those with depres-\nsive episodes that were rated as severe were higher for BP-II\nthan for BP-I and lower for subthreshold BPD. The more\nstriking results from the perspective of subthreshold BPD\nare that the clinical severity, role impairment, and comor-\nbidity of subthreshold BPD are all high and, indeed, com-\nparable with those of nonbipolar major depression re-\nported in previous NCS-R analyses.41 The findings on the\nclinical significance of subthreshold BPD strongly argue\nfor inclusion of the BPD spectrum concept in the diag-\nnostic classification system.\nAfter controlling for time at risk,42 the high magni-\ntude of comorbidity of threshold BPD with other men-\ntal disorders is consistent with previous clinical43,44 and\nassociation between BPD and substance abuse has been\nwell-established, the high magnitude of comorbidity be-\ntween BPD and anxiety disorders, particularly panic dis-\norder, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, has not been widely recognized.48,49\nDespite the higher disorder-specific comorbidity of thresh-\nold than subthreshold BPD, comorbidity with at least 1\nother disorder was nearly as common in subthreshold\nthat the generally lower bivariate comorbidity of sub-\nthreshold than threshold BPD is due to lower multimor-\nbidity (ie, comorbidity with multiple conditions).50 This\npervasive comorbidity across the BPD spectrum is sug-\ngestive of disturbances in multiple regulatory systems and\nshould be a topic for future research.\nTable 5.

However, treatment\nin the year before the interview was lower than lifetime\nthreshold (36.7%) cases, and only a few received appro-\n8.1% for subthreshold BPD). Appropriate maintenance\nmedication of currently asymptomatic lifetime cases was\neven lower than inappropriate maintenance medication\nold BPD). The proportions receiving inappropriate medi-\ncation (primarily antidepressants in the absence of an-\ntimania agents) were considerably higher than those\nreceiving appropriate treatment (31.4% for 12-month\ncases and 25.1% for asymptomatic lifetime cases), espe-\ncially in patients undergoing general medical treatment\natic lifetime cases). Appropriate medication use was much\nhigher and inappropriate medication use lower in pa-\ntients receiving psychiatric treatment than those receiv-\ning general medical treatment, although fewer than half\nof the psychiatric patients took appropriate medica-\ntomatic lifetime cases). The high use of inappropriate\nmedications is a concern given the dangers associated with\nthe use of antidepressants in the absence of mood stabi-\nlizers to treat BPD.51 Note that the treatment percent-\nages represent patients who took medications. The num-\nber of patients who were prescribed but did not take\nmedications was not recorded in the survey. It is pos-\nsible that higher proportions were prescribed antimanic\nagents but did not take them because subjective distress\nis far lower in mania/hypomania than in depression.11\nThe present results reinforce the argument of other re-\nsearchers16,34-36 that clinically significant subthreshold BPD\nis at least as common as threshold BPD.
