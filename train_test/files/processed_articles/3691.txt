    "reduced_content": "Clinical Report\nChanges in brain activation\nduring sedation induced\nby dexmedetomidine\nWon-Ho Kim1,*, Dongrae Cho2,*,\nBoreom Lee2, Jae-Jin Song3 and Teo Jeon Shin4\n Keywords\nAdrenergic alpha-2 receptor agonists, anesthesia, consciousness, dexmedetomidine, electroence-\nphalography, sedation\nIntroduction\nDexmedetomidine (DEX) is widely used\nas a sedative.1 DEX has little effect on\nrespiratory function, making it useful in\nsituations for procedures performed within\nthe airway, such as dental procedures.\nUnlike other sedatives, which act on\ngamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) recep-\ntors, DEX acts as an a2-adrenergic agonist\non autoreceptors, presynaptic receptors and\npostsynaptic receptors. DEX acts on a2\nreceptors in neurons that emanate from the\nlocus coeruleus (LC),2\u00ad3 producing a seda-\ntive effect resembling the electroencephalog-\nraphy (EEG) pattern of non rapid eye\nmovement (NREM) sleep II.4 The different\nsite of action of DEX compared with other\nsedatives suggests that DEX may have a\ndifferent anaesthetic mechanism. However,\nalthough DEX has been widely used to\nsedate patients, few studies have been per-\nformed to elucidate the mechanisms of\nDEX-induced sedation by examining\nchanges in cortical activation.\nSedation can be considered as the state\nbetween consciousness and the loss of con-\nsciousness. According to information inte-\ngration theory, consciousness requires the\nintegration of scattered information pro-\ncessed in different brain areas.5,6 As such,\nanaesthetic-induced impaired consciousness\nis likely to induce changes in cortical activity.\nPrevious studies have shown that different\nlevels of altered consciousness are associated\nwith modulation of activity in multiple brain\nregions.7,8 Understanding potential cortical\ndifferences during sedation may be useful\nfor understanding the neural correlates of\nimpaired consciousness. Functional neuroi-\nmaging studies have shown that DEX\nprimarily disturbs long-range thalamocorti-\ncal interactions.4 However, time-varying\nDEX effects on cortical activity cannot be\nevaluated using neuroimaging methods that\nprovide the highest spatial resolution, such as\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI). In addition, the brain modulates its\nfunctioning in specific frequency bands,9 and\nconsciousness impairment is closely related\nto disturbances in brain function in different\nfrequency bands.5 Even though interactions\nbetween distant brain areas are modulated in\nspecific frequency bands, the cortical effects\nof DEX on comprehensive brain networks in\nvarious frequency bands has not yet been\ninvestigated.\nIn the current study, we analysed differ-\nences in cerebral cortex activity between\nawake and sedated states induced by DEX,\nusing standardized low resolution electromag-\nnetic tomography (sLORETA). sLORETA\nlocalizes cerebral electric activity obtained\nthrough EEG recordings from multiple chan-\nnels to specific brain regions, as a functional\nbeen used to investigate the neurophysio-\nlogical correlates of various diseases.\nHowever, few attempts have been made to\ninvestigate the neural correlates of sedation\nusing this technique.\nThus, in the current study, we aimed to\ninvestigate changes in cortical activity\nduring DEX sedation, to examine the poten-\ntial neural correlates of DEX-induced con-\nsciousness impairment.\nMaterials and methods\nParticipant recruitment\nA sample of 20 healthy participants ranging\nin age from 20\u00ad40 years were enrolled in this\nstudy. All participants provided written\ninformed consent, and approval was given\nby the Institutional Review Board of the\nCollege of Dentistry at Seoul National\nUniversity. Each participant was instructed\nto fast for at least 8 hours prior to the\nexperiment. Participants with significant\nmedical diseases or laboratory abnormal-\nities were excluded from the study.\nEEG recording and dexmedetomidine\ninfusion\nParticipants were acclimated to a room\nshielded against sound and electric fields,\nwhere EEG was recorded. Thirty-two elec-\ntrodes were attached in the standard 10-20\ninternational placement after fitting an\nappropriate EEG cap that best matched\nthe head circumference of the participant.\nEEG recording was referenced to an average\nEEG, while keeping the impedance of all\nelectrodes below 5 k\n. Data were stored on\na PC at a sampling rate of 2048 Hz during\nthe entire experiment. After obtaining EEG\nrecordings for 5 min with eyes closed,\nDEX was administered with a 0.5 mcg/kg\nloading bolus over 10 min, followed by a\n0.5 mcg/kg/hr infusion until unconscious-\nness was reached. During the DEX infusion,\ncuff blood pressure, electrocardiogram,\npulse-oximetry, and capnography were\nmonitored. The bispectral index (BIS) was\nalso monitored for objective evaluation of\nsedation depth. We instructed participants\nto keep their eyes closed during the entire\nexperiment, and defined loss of consciousness\nas the loss of response to a verbal request\nto grasp the hand every 30 seconds. We\nstopped DEX administration when partici-\npants reached unconsciousness. Recovery of\nconsciousness after discontinuing DEX infu-\nsion was evaluated as a positive response to\nverbal requests to grasp the hand, or spon-\ntaneous eye opening. EEG was continuously\nrecorded until the participant regained full\nconsciousness evaluated by either the return\nto baseline BIS value or a positive response\nto the question ``Are you feeling the same\nas before, when you were sitting in the\ndental chair?''\nEEG preprocessing\nThree 1-minute epochs of EEG data were\nselected for analysis from all participants in\ntwo conditions, awake and sedated. During\nDEX injection, we selected the 3 minutes of\nEEG recording 30 seconds before the loss of\nconsciousness. All episodic artefacts were\ncarefully removed from the EEG signal by\nmanual inspection. The data were prepro-\ncessed by down-sampling to 256 Hz with\na 0.5 Hz high-pass filter, a 70 Hz low-pass\nfilter (fast Fourier transform filter applying\na Hanning window) and a 60 Hz notch\nfilter (64th-order finite impulse response\n[FIR] notch filters). EEG data pairs were\nbaseline corrected to the average reference.\nIn addition, independent component ana-\nlysis (ICA) was performed to minimize\nartefacts from micro muscle movement,\nblinking, electrical noise and pulses from\nthe carotid artery.\nSource localization analysis\nStandardized low-resolution brain electro-\nmagnetic tomography (sLORETA),10 a\nfunctional imaging method using certain\nelectrophysiological and neuroanatomical\nconstraints, was conducted to estimate\nsources in the brain from electrical activity\nat the scalp in each of the following\nsix frequency bands: delta (1.5\u00ad4 Hz), theta\nsLORETA gives a single linear solution to\nthe inverse problem of functional cortical\nlocalization based on extracranial measure-\nments12 and generates images of standardized\ncurrent density with no localization bias.10\nThe localization accuracy of sLORETA has\nbeen repeatedly validated by combining it\nwith other localization methods, such as\nstructural magnetic resonance imaging\nStatistical analyses\nTo identify potential differences between the\nawake and sedated states induced by DEX\ninfusion, voxel-by-voxel analysis using\nsLORETA was performed for the six fre-\nquency bands, with between-condition com-\nparisons of the current density distribution.\nStatistical nonparametric mapping (SPM) of\nsLORETA images was performed for each\ncontrast using sLORETA's built-in voxel-\ntions) and employing a log-F ratio statistic\nfor independent groups with a threshold\nResults\nAmong 20 subjects, EEGs obtained from\ntwo subjects were contaminated with exces-\nsive artefacts, which could not be removed\neven by applying sophisticated preprocess-\ning techniques. Therefore, data from these\nparticipants were excluded from subsequent\nanalyses.\nThe mean dose of DEX was 33.6 mcg.\nThe mean baseline BIS was 93.2 during\nawake state and 77.3 during DEX induced\nsedation, respectively.\nDEX-induced sedation was associated\nwith cortical activity changes in different\nfrequency bands. Compared with the base-\nline state, increased activity was found in the\ncuneus (BA 18) in the delta frequency band,\nthe posterior cingulate cortex (BA 23) in the\ntheta frequency, the cingulate gyrus (BA 24)\nin the sigma frequency band, and the cuneus\n(BA 18) in the gamma frequency bands, and\nwas most prominent during DEX-induced\nsedation (Figures 1 (a), (b), (d), (e)).\nIn contrast, relative to the awake state,\ndecreased activity was observed in the\nfusiform gyrus (BA 20) in the alpha fre-\nquency bands, and was most promin-\nent during DEX-induced sedation, which\nwas lateralized to the left. (Figure 1-c).\nMeanwhile, no significant differences were\nobserved in the beta2 and beta3 frequency\nbands during DEX induced sedation. The\ncortical areas demonstrating significant\nchanges during DEX-induced sedation for\neach frequency band are described in detail\nin Table 1.\nDiscussion\nWe found that DEX induced cortical activ-\nity changes during an impaired conscious-\nness state. To the best our knowledge, this is\nthe first study to investigate sedation-related\ncortical activity changes in each brain fre-\nquency band, with which the brain regulates\nits functioning.9\nWe utilized an inverse modelling tech-\nnique to determine which areas in specific\nfrequency ranges were disturbed in the brain\nduring DEX sedation. This inverse model-\nling method (sLORETA) is based on the\nnotion that individual neurons are synchro-\nnized with adjacent neurons, and this\nenables electrical source localization.11,18\nThrough localizing the sources of electric\nactivity, sLORETA statistically computes\nthe difference in cerebral electrical activity\nbetween two states, and visualizes statistical\nresults in a three dimensional distribution.\nThis three dimensional distribution of stat-\nistical differences is displayed as a current\ndensity distribution in the solution space,\nallowing for the detection of changes in\nbrain activity more easily.11,18 However, few\nstudies have attempted to investigate the\nmechanisms underlying impaired conscious-\nness using sLORETA, despite its advan-\ntages, such as its simplicity and graphical\nrepresentation of brain activity differences\nbetween two conditions. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first study to investigate the\nmechanisms underlying DEX sedation using\nthe sLORETA technique.\nThe default mode network (DMN) has\nbeen investigated as an anatomical and\nfunctional mechanism for maintaining\nattention and consciousness.19 In addition,\nthe common midline core (CMC), which\nincludes the midline precuneus/cuneus, pre-\nfrontal cortex, and other brain areas, is\ncommonly targeted by general anaesthetic,\nFigure 1. Statistical nonparametric mapping (SnPM) of sLORETA images for each band (a) delta (b) theta\n(c) alpha (d) sigma (e) gamma.\nresulting in anesthesia.20 The DMN is\nreported to be activated in situations where\nattention to external environments is not\nnecessary. The DMN consists of multiple\ninteracting subsystems within the brain.\nAlthough the precise function of the DMN\nremains unclear, it is thought to play a\ncritical role in internally-directed cognition.\nThe DMN is activated during non-stressful\nresting states, such as autobiographical\nmemory and planning for the future.\nDMN disturbance is also associated with\nthe development of neuropsychiatric dis-\neases, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizo-\nphrenia, autism, depression and attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder.21 In the\nDMN, the posterior cingulate cortex\n(PCC) acts as a hub, and is functionally\nconnected to other brain areas.22 The cur-\nrent results revealed that cortical activity\nTable 1. Cortical areas demonstrating significant changes during DEX-induced sedation for each frequency\nband.\nFrequency\nband MNI coordinates (x y z)\nVoxel\nvalue\nBrodmann\narea Structure\nDelta\ngyrus\nTheta\nAlpha\ngyrus\nGamma\ngyrus\nchanges associated with DEX sedation\ninvolved significant alterations in PCC,\nwhich acts as a hub within the DMN.\nDEX also caused changes in brain activity\nin other areas of the DMN (precuneus,\nangular gyrus), although these changes did\nnot reach statistical significance (data not\nshown). Considering the roles of the DMN\nand CMC in regulating consciousness and\nmental states, DEX may be likely to induce\nchanges in both DMN and CMC activity,\nleading to impaired consciousness.\nIn accord with this hypothesis, DEX-\ninduced sedation was associated with sig-\nnificant changes in cortical activity in the\nPCC, an area that acts as a hub among\nDMN and CMC structures. However, cor-\ntical activity in this area was augmented\nrather than suppressed, contrary to our\nexpectation. These results appear to contra-\ndict those of previous studies demonstrating\nimpaired activity in these brain areas during\ngeneral anesthesia.20,23 It remains unclear\nwhy DEX sedation was associated with\nincreased cortical activation in these areas.\nHowever, a recent study may provide an\nexplanation for increased brain-specific\nactivity appearing somewhat contradictory\nin a DEX-induced sedative state, as dis-\ncussed below.\nIn line with the current results, a previous\nstudy reported that functional connectivity\nof the PCC to other brain area increases\nduring propofol sedation.24 In the awake\nstate, the arousal center in the brainstem\ninhibits PCC function.24 During sedation, as\nthe connection from the arousal center to\nthe PCC weakens, the PCC paradoxically\nincreases functional connectivity to other\nbrain areas. The PCC acts as a hub within\nthe DMN brain network22 and connects to\nother brain areas, such as the cuneus and\nanterior cingulate cortex, in which increased\nactivation during sedation was observed\nin the current study. Taken together,\nthese findings suggest that the increased\nactivity we observed in these regions may\nhave resulted from disinhibition during sed-\nation, making robust connections more\nprominent. From the perspective of infor-\nmation integration, the synchronized brain\nnetwork may impair the efficiency of infor-\nmation processing.25 In clinical practice,\nimpaired responses to external stimuli,\nsuch as verbal, auditory, and visual stimuli\nare commonly observed under sedation.\nIncreased activation during sedation may\nbe related to impaired and delayed responses\nto stimuli during sedation.\nIn the alpha frequency bands, we\nobserved decreased cortical activity in the\nauditory cortex (AC) and the fusiform\ngyrus, where significant cortical activity\nalterations were observed during sedation.\nThe fusiform gyrus is involved in processing\nword recognition and visual information,26\nwhile AC activation is associated with audi-\ntory stimulation. The PCC plays an import-\nant role in auditory perception.27 Perceived\nauditory stimulation is a prerequisite for\nword recognition,28 and one study reported\nthat event-related potentials during auditory\nstimulation are significantly affected in the\nalpha frequency range.29 The present study\ndemonstrated deactivation in temporal\nbrain areas in the alpha frequency bands\nwhich may explain the delayed response to\nverbal stimuli. In the current study, all sub-\njects showed a delayed response to verbal\nstimuli that were presented to evaluate the\nlevel of consciousness before unconscious-\nness was exhibited. Considering the import-\nance of the fusiform gyrus in regulating visual\nperception, DEX may also impair the effi-\nciency of visual stimulus processing, leading\nto blurred or double vision30 during sedation,\neven though the subjects in the present\nexperiment were instructed to close their eyes.\nInterestingly, the deactivation in the\nalpha frequency band was lateralized to the\nleft. Alpha oscillation is involved in higher\ncognitive processes, such as memory and\nconsciousness.31 A left-lateralized neural\nsystem distributed in the frontal, parietal,\nand temporal lobes is thought to be involved\nTherefore, the DEX induced left-lateralized\ndeactivation we observed in the alpha fre-\nquency band may suggest that the neural\nnetwork required for high-level verbal and\nmemory processing can be separated during\ndeep DEX sedation.\nAlthough the current study revealed sev-\neral neural correlates that may be associated\nwith DEX-induced sedation, there are sev-\neral limitations that should be addressed in\nfuture studies. First, we focused on changes\nin cortical activity during DEX sedation.\nHowever, a change in brain activity does not\nguarantee alterations in brain network prop-\nerties. Even without changes in brain activ-\nity, functional connectivity between different\nbrain areas may be altered.24 It is therefore\nnecessary to identify changes in the EEG\ndynamics associated with sedation induced\nby DEX. Further studies should be con-\nducted to clarify this point in more depth.\nSecond, changes in cortical activity, as\nshown in this study, may represent different\npatterns during different levels of sedation.\nPrevious studies have shown that DEX\ninduces changes in sleep-like EEG patterns\nand causes a slight increase in power in the\ntheta, alpha and beta bands.35\u00ad37 Indeed, we\nhave shown that DEX changes the activity\nof the cerebral cortex in these frequency\nbands. However, the activation pattern of\nthe cerebral cortex may vary with each\nfrequency band depending on the depth.\nInvestigating cortical activity during DEX\ninfusion at a constant level of effect-site\nconcentration may be helpful for elucidating\nthe mechanisms underlying different levels\nof impaired consciousness. Furthermore,\nEEG changes between different levels of\nsedation should also be compared with\nbetter understand transitional changes\nfrom consciousness to unconsciousness.\nIn summary, the current results revealed\nchanges in cortical activity in different fre-\nquency ranges during DEX sedation. These\nalterations may explain the mechanisms\nunderlying DEX sedation, potentially\nenabling the tracking of changes in levels\nof consciousness as an objective marker\nduring DEX administration.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Promising-\nPioneering Researcher Program through\nSeoul National University (SNU) in 2015 and\nthe Basic Science Research Program through\nthe National Research Foundation of Korea\n(NRF), funded by the Ministry of Education\nReferences\n1.
