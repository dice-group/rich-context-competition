Using a modified Sternberg working memory paradigm to investigate the\ncombined effects of emotional stimuli with working memory, participants were exposed to\nexperimental stimuli comprising pictures that represented positive, neutral and negative emotions.\nWorking memory ability was measured using reaction time and accuracy, and emotion-processing\nability was measured using pupil diameter.\nResults: Out of 36 participants (18 patients with minor depression and 18 controls), there were\nno statistically significant between-group differences in response time and accuracy. Positive stimuli\nevoked changes in pupil diameter that were significantly smaller in patients with minor depression\nversus controls, but changes in pupil diameter evoked by negative stimuli were not significantly\ndifferent between the two groups.\nConclusions: Healthy subjects showed a stronger emotional response to positive emotional\nstimuli than patients with first onset and previously untreated minor depression, but there were no\ndifferences in response to negative emotions. There were no statistically significant between-group\ndifferences in terms of speed of cognitive response, but this may have been due to the relatively\nsmall samples sizes assessed. Studies with larger sample populations are required to further\ninvestigate these results.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1The International WIC Institute, Beijing University of\nTechnology, Beijing, China\n2The Beijing International Collaboration Base on Brain\nInformatics and Wisdom Services, Beijing, China\n3The Beijing Key Laboratory of MRI and Brain Informatics,\nBeijing, China\n4Mood Disorders Center & China Clinical Research\nCenter for Mental Disorders, Beijing Anding Hospital,\nCapital Medical University, Beijing, China\n5Center of Depression, Beijing Institute for Brain\nDisorders, Beijing, China\n6Beijing Key Laboratory for Mental Disorders, Beijing,\nChina\n7Department of Life Science and Informatics, Maebashi\nInstitute of Technology, Maebashi City, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nShengfu Lu, The International WIC Institute, Beijing\nUniversity of Technology, Ping Le Yuan 100, Chaoyang\nEmail: lusf@bjut.edu.cn\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

Most cognitive impairment\nresearch has focused on patients with mild\nor moderate depressive symptoms, with little\nresearch regarding first-onset and untreated\ndepressive disorder. In patients with depres-\nsion, cognitive dysfunction, such as reduced\nworking memory, is thought to occur\nbecause of cognitive control impairment.23\nThe prefrontal lobe and anterior cingulate\n(including ventrolateral prefrontal cortex\nand dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) comprise\nthe centre of cognitive control and executive\nfunction.24 In healthy individuals, activation\nof the prefrontal cortex leads to reduced\nactivity in the negative emotion processing\nregions, such as the amygdala,25 suggesting\nthat this cognitive control region has a\nregulatory role in processing negative emo-\ntions. Patients with depression who com-\npleted a colour-word Stroop task,26 which\nrequires cognitive control, were shown to\nhave a greater probability of error and\nsignificantly decreased event-related poten-\ntial N2 and N450 amplitudes compared with\nhealthy controls, and these changes\noccurred in the left dorsolateral prefrontal\nand dorsal anterior cingulate regions.27 In a\ndigital sorting task that required cognitive\ncontrol, patients with depression exhibited\nsignificantly decreased dorsolateral pre-\nfrontal cortex activity compared with\nhealthy controls, suggesting that brain dis-\norders related to cognitive control functions\nin patients with depression result in a failure\nto effectively adjust and control emotional\nprocessing regions.28 Patients with depres-\nsion, who were directed to successively\ncomplete two independent tasks,29 showed\nexcessive activation of the emotion process-\ning brain regions during an emotion pro-\ncessing task versus healthy controls, whereas\nduring a digital scheduling task, cognitive\ncontrol brain regions were insufficiently\nactivated. When emotion processing was\ncombined with task performance in an\nexperimental paradigm,30 brain regions\ninvolved in emotional processing were\nrevealed to be excessively activated in\npatients with depression, whereas cognitive\ncontrol brain regions were insufficiently\nactivated. Cognitive control and emotional\nprocessing brain regions are thought to\ncontrol and regulate each other,31 and\nmajor depressive disorder is often accom-\npanied by working memory deficits caused\nby competition for resources generated\nbetween emotional and cognitive process-\ning. Decreased cognitive control ability\nleads to inadequate distribution of cognitive\nand attention resources for cognitive tasks.32\nDespite a large number of studies into\nemotional damage and working memory in\ndepression, several deficiencies exist: most\nstudies focus on major depressive disorder,\nwith few studies into first-onset and\nuntreated depressive disorder (mild/moder-\nate depressive symptoms); the majority of\nstudies examine emotional processing and\nworking memory issues as separate elem-\nents, rather than in combination; previous\nstudies have focused on the working\nmemory system (executive function, execu-\ntive function templates, and voice and visual\nspace templates), with less attention to the\nmemory function system (memory encoding\nand retrieval); and research has focused on\nemotional processing functions, with limited\nstudies investigating processing capacity for\nexternal emotional stimuli.\nResearch into working memory suggests\nthat patients with major depressive disorder,\nwhose work and daily life has been affected,\ndo not have complete damage to working\nferent manifestations of work, studies and\nlives of patients with non-severe versus\nsevere depression, the present authors\nhypothesized that working memory is par-\ntially and mildly damaged in patients with\nnon-severe depression. Some studies suggest\nthat cognitive dysfunction does not improve\ninfers that there would be no relationship\nbetween cognitive impairment and depres-\nsion severity.36\u00ad39 In addition, patients with\nmajor depression show impairments in cog-\nnitive control and executive func-\nprocess information should affect cognition\nability and behaviour. Patients with depres-\nsion tend to insufficiently process positive\ninformation but excessively process negative\ninformation,1 therefore, the present authors\nhypothesized that the performance of emo-\ntionally impaired patients with first-onset\nand untreated depressive disorder is char-\nacterized by a reduced capacity for external\npositive-emotion processing and excessive\ncapacity for negative-emotion processing.\nIn the present study, patients with first-\nonset and previously untreated minor\ndepression were compared with healthy\nsubjects, using a modified Sternberg work-\nemotional stimuli with working memory to\ninvestigate emotional experience and work-\ning memory abilities. Working-memory\nability was measured using reaction time\nand accuracy, and emotion-processing\nability was measured by changes in pupil\ndiameter, as mental activities associated\nwith emotions can lead to changes in pupil\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective case-control study sequen-\ntially recruited patients with first-onset and\npreviously untreated depressive disorder\n(minor depression group) attending the out-\npatient clinic at Beijing Anding Hospital,\nCapital Medical University, Beijing, China.\nSex-, age- and education-matched healthy\nsubjects were recruited from the local popu-\nlation in Beijing via advertisements, and the\nstudy was conducted between December\nsion were screened by a psychiatrist (LF\nand BbF) using the Mini International\nNeuropsychiatric Interview44 and diagnosed\naccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders, Fourth\nEdition (DSM-IV) criteria.45\nInclusion criteria for patients with minor\nyears and right-handed; (2) met the DSM-IV\ndiagnostic criteria for depression and diag-\nnosed with mild or moderate depression;\nDepression Rating Scale (HDRS),46 which\nwas used to assess the degree of depression;\n(4) were undergoing treatment for the first\ntime and had no history of taking anti-\ndepressants or drugs that affected nervous\nsystem function prior to treatment; (5) had\nno suicidal tendencies and could work, study\nand live normally; and (6) had normal or\ncorrected-to-normal vision with no colour\nblindness or other eye disease, and could\ncomplete the eye movement experiment.\nExclusion criteria included concomitant\ndelirium, dementia and other cognitive dis-\norders, and substance misuse. Inclusion\ncriteria for the healthy controls were as\nhanded; (2) scored < 5 on a self-assessment\nbased on the quick inventory of depressive\nsymptomatology-self report (QIDS-SR16\nand <4 on the Beck Depression Inventory;48\n(3) had no history of mental illness; and (4)\nhad normal or corrected-to-normal vision\nwith no colour blindness or other eye\ndisease.\nThis study was approved by the Ethics\ncommittee of Beijing Anding Hospital,\nCapital Medical University, China. All par-\nticipants provided written informed consent,\nand received compensation for their\nparticipation.\nExperimental materials\nSixty pictures were selected from the\nInternational Affective Picture System49\nbased on the level of valence and arousal.\nPositive pictures were selected to have high\nvalence and high arousal levels (mean\nhad low valence and high arousal (mean\ndaily necessities, such as life and work\nscenes, buildings, transportation, and geom-\netry figures that did not easily induce emo-\nwere processed using Adobe Photoshop\nsoftware, version 6.0 (Adobe Systems\nCorporation, San Jose, CA, USA); and the\nlution were consistent between the pictures.\nExperimental paradigm and procedure\nThe present study applied a modified\nand substituted three types of pictures (to\nstimulate positive, neutral and negative\nemotions) for the string of numbers conven-\ntionally used as cues. To sufficiently induce\nthe participants' emotions, each cue\nincluded four pictures of the same type of\nemotional category, which were presented to\nthe subjects once. The experiment included\nthree types of cue: positive, negative and\nneutral emotion pictures. The target stimu-\nlus was a picture, and participants were\nasked to determine whether the target pic-\nture had appeared in the cue.\nThe experimental procedure followed\nseveral steps. First, a `\u00fe' sign appeared at\nthe center of a 17-inch liquid crystal display\nindicate that the stimulus pictures would\nappear. The cue was presented for 10 s, and\nparticipants were instructed to carefully\nwatch the pictures and remember them.\nAfter 5 s for memory retention, a target\npicture appeared on the screen, and partici-\npants were asked to determine whether it\nhad appeared in the cue. If it had appeared\nin the cue, participants were instructed to\nclick the left button; otherwise, they clicked\nthe right button. Finally, a `*' symbol\nappeared on the screen, indicating that the\nparticipants should rest for 2 s. After this\ntime, the next trial began.\nThe experimental equipment comprised a\ncorneal reflection eye tracker (Tobii T120\nEye Tracker; Tobii Technology, Danderyd,\nSweden), with a sampling frequency of\n120 Hz. The experimental materials were\ndisplayed on the liquid crystal display\nscreen using a Microsoft IE6.0 browser\n(Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, USA),\nand the distance between the display screen\nand participants was 60 cm. As the cue was\npresented, the Tobii T120 eye tracker rec-\norded pupil diameter at each fixation point\nas participants viewed the pictures, and\nreaction time and accuracy as participants\nresponded throughout the task. Participants\nwere required to keep their heads still, and\nthere were no other physical constraints.\nTo study the brain's ability to process\npositive and negative emotional stimuli,\ndifferences in pupil diameter changes\nevoked by positive and negative emotional\npictures were analysed in patients with\nminor depression and control groups using\nthe following calculations:\nAssuming that there were m fixations in\ntask j of participant i, the pupil diameter size\nof the k (k \u00bc 1, 2,. . ., m) fixation point Fijk\nis\nPTijk\nin participant i, which was calculated\nfrom the following equation\nPTijk\n\u00bc Leftijk\n\u00fe Rightijk\nwhere Leftijk\nis the left pupil diameter of the\nfixation and Rightijk\nis the right pupil diam-\neter of the fixation. Thus, the mean pupil\ndiameter in task j for participant i was as\nfollows:\nPTij\n\u00bc\nX\nm\nPTijk\nAssuming the PSi\nis the change in pupil\ndiameter evoked by the r positive emotional\npicture stimuli of participant i based on\nequation (1) and equation (2), the pupil\ndiameter change for the l negative emotional\npicture stimuli, PNi\n, would then be calcu-\nlated by the following two equations:\nPSi \u00bc PSir \u00c0 PRi \u00f03\u00de\nPNi \u00bc PSil \u00c0 PRi \u00f04\u00de\nwhere the PRi\nis the mean pupil diameter of\nparticipant i evoked by all of the neutral\nemotion picture stimuli.\nStatistical analyses\nData are presented as mean \u00c6 SD, and stat-\nistical analyses were conducted using SPSS\nsoftware, version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,\nUSA). Reaction time and accuracy were\nanalysed based on emotional category (posi-\ntive, neutral or negative). Pupil diameter\nchanges (difference in pupil diameter\nbetween emotional and emotion-neutral\nstates) were analysed based on type of\nemotion (positive or negative). A mixed-\nmodel analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 2\n(group: minor depression, healthy con-\ntrols) \u00c2 3 (within-subject factor stimulus\nmaterial: positive, neutral, negative)\nrepeated measures was conducted to analyse\naccuracy and reaction time. Using a two-\nsample t-test, between-group differences in\npupil diameter changes were compared. In\naddition, a Bayesian analysis was con-\nducted,50 and Pearson's correlation coeffi-\ncient was used to assess pupil diameter\nchanges that correlated with accuracy and\nreaction time.\nTo correct for outliers, trials for which\nreaction times were either > 3 SD from each\nparticipant's mean (calculated separately for\neach trial type) or <400 ms were excluded\n(a standard procedure used to trim reaction-\ntime data), which removed approximately\n1.25% of the trials. The resulting means for\nthe corrected trials were used in the present\nanalyses. A P-value < 0.05 was considered\nto be statistically significant.\nResults\nDemographic and clinical data\nA total of 18 patients with first-onset and\npreviously untreated minor depressive dis-\norders and 18 healthy controls were\nincluded, and the two groups were matched\nby sex, age and education.

No other\nstatistically significant correlations were\nobserved.\nDiscussion\nReaction time and accuracy are thought to\nbe behavioural indicators of working\nmemory damage in patients with major\ndepressive disorders.16,18 In the present\nstudy, overall working memory capacity\n(reaction time and accuracy) of patients\nwith minor depression was not significantly\ndifferent from healthy controls, suggesting\nthat working memory function (including\nencoding, maintaining and retrieval) in\npatients with minor depression may not be\nimpaired. These results were inconsistent\nwith the authors' hypothesis that working\nmemory is partially and mildly damaged in\npatients with non-severe depression, but\nwere consistent with a study that found\npatients with major depressive disorder had\na normal capacity for cued recall and rec-\nognition.14 The present study showed that\nmean reaction times in patients with minor\ndepression were not significantly different\nfrom healthy controls, however, this lack of\nstatistical significance may have been due to\nthe small sample size investigated. The pre-\nsent results suggest that information pro-\ncessing in general may not be slower in\npatients with minor depression versus\nhealthy individuals, however, further inves-\ntigation with a larger sample size is required\nto confirm this.\nExpansion and narrowing of pupil diam-\neter has been shown to reflect emotional\nchanges in humans.42,43 Positive pictorial\nstimuli, containing happy emotional\ninformation, will cause a happy emotional\nexperience, resulting in increased pupil\ndiameters. Negative pictorial stimuli, con-\ntaining sad or frightening emotional infor-\nmation, will evoke unpleasant emotional\nexperiences, resulting in decreased pupil\ndiameters.

The pre-\nsent study found that when patients with\nminor depression viewed positive pictures,\nchanges in pupil diameter were significantly\nsmaller than those of healthy individuals,\nbut there was no such between-group differ-\nence when participants viewed negative pic-\ntures. These results suggest that patients\nwith minor depression have limitations in\nprocessing information from external posi-\ntive visual stimuli, which may result in an\ninsufficient ability to experience pleasurable\nemotions. Patients with minor depression\ndid not present limitations in processing\ninformation from external negative visual\nstimuli, however, suggesting that the nega-\ntive emotional experience did not differ from\nhealthy individuals in the present study. This\nfinding partially concurred with the authors'\nhypothesis that patients with first-onset,\nuntreated depression have a reduced capa-\ncity for external positive-emotion processing\nand excessive capacity for negative-emotion\nprocessing. Two factors may explain this\npartial agreement: First, the present research\nincluded patients with first-onset and previ-\nously untreated mild or moderate depressive\nsymptoms; and secondly, changes in pupil\ndiameter during an emotional experience\nwere calculated using the participants' pupil\ndiameters during their own emotional\nexperiences minus their pupil diameters in\na neutral emotional state, which reflected the\nresults of processing external emotional\nstimuli (the inherent unconscious negative\nautomatic processing of patients with\ndepression was excluded). For healthy indi-\nviduals, pupil diameter size during an emo-\ntional state is the result of external\nemotional stimulation,42,43 and pupil diam-\neter size during a neutral experience reflects\nthe normal pupil diameter.51 In patients\nwith depression, pupil diameter during the\nemotional state is the summation of pupil\ndiameter caused by external emotional\nstimulation and pupil changes caused by\ninternal negative emotion processing.51\nPupil size during the neutral state is the\nsummation of pupil diameter during normal\nbehaviour and pupil changes caused by\ninternal unconscious negative automatic\nprocessing. Thus, from the view of cognitive\nsubtraction, regardless of healthy control or\ndepression group, changes in pupil diameter\ncan only reflect the processing of external\nemotional stimulation.\nIn patients with depression, imaging\nstudies have shown that negative emotion-\nprocessing brain regions are enhanced, with\nexcessive processing of negative emotions\ncompared with healthy controls.52 This\nresult52 is produced by direct comparisons\nbetween patients with depression and\nhealthy controls, reflecting the additional\ninherent and automatic unconscious nega-\ntive emotional processing in patients with\ndepression, and does not contradict the\nconclusions that patients with minor depres-\nsion do not tend to handle external negative\nvisual stimuli excessively. Thus, patients\nwith depression tend to process external\nnegative stimuli based on their inherent\nautomatic processing of negative stimuli,\nwhich strengthens the activities of negative-\nprocessing brain regions in patients with\ndepression compared with healthy individ-\nuals.52 Furthermore, changes in pupil diam-\neter can only reflect the processing of\nexternal negative stimuli and the experience\nthis evokes. The subjective experience of\npatients with severe depression is shown to\nbe reduced for both positive and negative\nemotional stimuli, whereas the subjective\nexperience of patients with mild depression\nis reduced only for positive emotional\nstimuli.53 The manifestations of emotional\ndamage in patients with severe depression\nhave been shown to indicate a reduced\nability to process positive emotions and\nmaintain the activity of brain areas, whereas\nnegative emotional processing and brain\nactivity maintenance are normal.54 These\nstudies support the present finding that\nemotional damage in patients with non-\nsevere depression results from a lack of\npositive emotion processing capacity rather\nthan excessive negative emotion processing.\nAnhedonia, the diminished capacity to\nexperience pleasure, is related to dysregula-\ntion of the brain's reward systems, and\ntogether with sensitivity to pressure, is\nthought be an endophenotypic characteristic\nfor major depression.55 The present study\nshowed that, although patients with minor\ndepression and healthy controls did not\ndiffer in terms of negative emotional experi-\nence, patients with minor depression had\na significantly lower positive emotional\nexperience compared with healthy controls.\nThis finding suggests that anhedonia is not\nonly an endophenotypic feature of major\ndepressive disorders, but also of moderate or\nmild depressive disorders: That is, anhedo-\nnia may be one of the core symptoms of\ndepression.\nFinally, analysis of the correlation\nbetween degree of emotional experience\nand working memory in the present study\nshowed that change in pupil diameter\nevoked by positive stimuli in patients with\nminor depression was strongly correlated\nwith memory accuracy in relation to positive\ninformation. The positive emotional experi-\nence in patients with minor depression was\nsignificantly lower than in healthy controls,\nsuggesting that the lower the positive emo-\ntional experience, the lower the memory\naccuracy of positive information. In con-\ntrast, changes in pupil diameter evoked by\nnegative stimuli were not significantly cor-\nrelated with memory accuracy relating to\nnegative information; the lack of signifi-\ncance may have been due to the relatively\nsmall sample size investigated. Studies of\nmood-congruent memory have suggested\nthat, compared with healthy controls,\npatients with depression remember more\nnegative stimuli that are consistent with\ntheir depressive mood, and remember less\npositive stimuli that are inconsistent with\ntheir mood.56 Increased memory for nega-\ntive information with mood-congruency and\ndecreased memory for positive informa-\ntion with mood-inconsistency are basic\nmanifestations of memory capacity in\npatients with depression.57,58 The present\nresults are consistent with published studies,\nand showed that non-major depression also\nhad a mood-congruent memory effect,\nwhich may indicate that mood-congruent\nmemory effects are one of the core features\nof depression.\nThe present study has several limitations:\nFirst, comparisons were only made between\npatients with first onset and previously\nuntreated minor depression and healthy\ncontrols, and the present results were indir-\nectly compared with results of previous\nfindings in patients with major depression,\nwhich may affect the interpretation of the\nfindings; Secondly, the limited sample size\nmay have affected the statistical validity. For\nexample, correlation analyses may not have\nresulted in an unbiased estimate of prob-\nability, although the sample size in the\npresent study was comparable to a similar\npublished eye-tracking study;59 Thirdly, the\nstudy of cognitive control and executive\nfunction was based on analysis of cognitive\nbehaviours (reaction time and accuracy)\nrather than direct imaging of brain function.\nFuture research should include a larger\nsample size, a comparator group of patients\nwith severe depression, and provide imaging\nevidence, such as functional magnetic res-\nonance imaging data.\nThe present study revealed that first-\nonset and previously untreated patients\nwith mild or moderate depressive symptoms\nmay have different working memory\nresponses compared with healthy controls.\nIn terms of emotional experience, healthy\ncontrols showed a stronger emotional\nresponse to positive emotions than patients\nwith minor depression, whereas there was no\nsignificant between-group difference for\nnegative emotions. Consistent with previous\nstudies of major depressive disorder, first-\nonset and previously untreated mild or\nmoderate depression showed a mood-\ncongruent memory effect.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work is supported by the National Basic\nInternational Science & Technology Cooperation\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China\nthe Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) from\nJapan Society for the Promotion of Science\nBeijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals\nClinical Medicine Development of Special\nScience and technology achievement transform-\nation and industrialization projects funds\nReferences\n1.
