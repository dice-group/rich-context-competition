In cross-sectional analyses, these symptoms were associated most strongly with\nblack race, lower income and education, less exercise, and more depressive symptoms.

Cooper, Day, and Curry (1974)\nfound a higher frequency of deafness among per-\nsons with paranoid psychosis than in controls with\naffective psychoses.\nIn recent years, however, the association between\nsensory impairment and paranoid symptoms has\npublished studies examining the association be-\ntween sensory (vision and hearing) impairment and\nlate-life psychosis with paranoid features. Though a\nmajority of the investigations supported the postu-\nlated association between hearing impairment and\nlate-onset paranoid disorder, there were method-\nological limitations in these studies, such as the ab-\nsence of a longitudinal perspective. These investiga-\ntors also reported findings from a case-control study\nin which a blind assessment of visual and hearing\nimpairments was used to explore this postulated\nassociation. Due to an overall high level of sensory\ndeficits among older psychiatric patients, no true\ndifferences in sensory deficits could be found be-\ntween persons with paranoid psychoses and those\nwith other psychiatric disorders.\nThere is an area neglected in the study of paranoid\nsymptoms -- that these so-called symptoms may\nexpress an accurate view of the environment for\ncertain populations in society. For example, older\npersons living in inner city environments, where\ndrug abuse dominates the culture, may have more\nthan ample reason to perceive that environment as\nhostile. Regardless of the etiology of paranoid symp-\n70 The Gerontologist\ntoms, a study of the natural history and correlates of\nthese symptoms can be useful to understanding\ncommunity-dwelling elders.\nTo our knowledge, there are no longitudinal stud-\nies in the literature relating sensory impairment to\nthe onset of paranoid symptoms. We therefore ana-\nlyzed data from the Piedmont Health Survey of the\nElderly (Established Populations for Epidemiologic\nStudies of the Elderly Project [EPESE/Duke]) in order\nto determine the influence of self-reported visual\nand hearing impairment at baseline upon paranoid\nsymptoms three years later in a controlled analysis.\nWe hypothesized that paranoid thoughts at follow-\nup would be associated with previously self-reported\ndeficits in hearing and vision, even controlling for\nphysical and cognitive status and paranoid thoughts\nat baseline.\nMethods\nSample\nThe data for this study derive from the Established\nPopulations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly\nProject (EPESE) at Duke University Medical Center.\nThe population survey at Duke was part of a multicen-\nter, collaborative epidemiologic investigation of\nhealth status in the physical, social, and cognitive\nfunctioning of persons 65 years of age and older living\nin four communities: East Boston, Massachusetts;\nIowa and Washington Counties, Iowa; New Haven,\nConnecticut; and five counties in the north-central\nPiedmont of North Carolina (Cornoni-Huntley et al.,\n1990). The North Carolina study sample consists of\nselected from Durham, Granville, Vance, Warren, and\nFranklin counties of North Carolina, with each of the\ncounties contiguous with at least one other county in\nthe catchment area. Durham County is predominantly\nurban, whereas the remaining four counties are pre-\ndominantly rural. The population of Durham County\nis approximately equal to the combined population of\nthe four rural counties. There is a high proportion of\nblacks in all five counties, ranging at the time of the\n1980 U.S. Census, from one-third in Durham County\nto nearly two-thirds in Warren County.\nIn order to optimize both racial differences (blacks\nversus non-blacks) and urban/rural differences, the\nsample was drawn in order to interview approxi-\nmately equal numbers of subjects from the urban\nand rural counties and equal numbers of blacks and\nnon-blacks. Forty-eight percent of the sample were\nfrom Durham County, and 52% were from the rural\ncounties. Fifty-four percent of the sample were\nblack, and 46% were non-black (almost exclusively\nwhite).\nA four-stage, stratified sampling design was used.\nIn the first stage, primary sampling units consisting\nof 450 zones of approximately equal population size\nwere selected from each 1980 census block, block\ncluster, and enumeration district. In the second\nstage, a land area within each zone was selected\nbased on population density, and all households\nwithin that selected land area were enumerated or\nlisted (n = 26,183). The housing units were stratified\nby race and residence. The third stage involved\nscreening all listed household units for occupants\naged 65 or older. At the fourth stage, the Kish proce-\ndure was used to select one person aged 65 or older\n(n = 4,162) from each eligible household (Kish,\nto-face interviews, and 162 contributed abbreviated\nproxy interviews with a close acquaintance or family\nmember. The proxy interviews did not include the\nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale\n(CES-D), so proxies were removed from the analyses.\nAn additional 69 respondents did not answer one or\nboth of the paranoia items from the CES-D, and these\npersons were also omitted from all analyses. The\nbaseline analyses included 3,931 subjects. At follow-\nple members alive, were interviewed.\nMissing data varied for different items in the ques-\ntionnaire, but were minimal except for income status\n(752 respondents did not provide income data).\nMeasures\nParanoid symptoms were measured by two items\nfrom the CES-D, \"People were unfriendly\" and \"I felt\nthat people disliked me\" (Radloff, 1977). All ques-\ntions from the CES-D were included verbatim from\nthe original version of the questionnaire. Response\noptions, however, were collapsed to a yes/no format\nfor reporting the presence or absence of a symptom\nduring the week preceding the interview. The overall\ncorrelation of CES-D scores determined by usual\nmethods of scoring and the modified approach was\nvery high (Blazer, Burchette, Service, & George,\n1991). In a previous study, the psychometric proper-\nties of the CES-D, including its factor structure, were\ndetermined in a community sample of married men\nand women (Ross & Mirowsky, 1984). The factors\nwere, in large part, generalizable across both men\nand women and included factors of depressed affect,\nenervation, lack of positive affect, and interpersonal\nproblems. We repeated this analysis and found the\nfactors to be almost identical to those previously\nreported, with virtually no variability by gender or\nrace. Two items loaded on the \"interpersonal prob-\nlems\" factor, i.e., \"I felt that people disliked me\" and\n\"People were unfriendly.\" These two items were\nincluded in the CES-D to tap the paranoid tendencies\nin mood disorders. The general perception that\n\"People dislike me\" is a phenomenon of one core\nparanoid symptom, i.e., suspiciousness. The general\nperception that \"People are unfriendly\" is a phe-\nnomenon of a second core paranoid symptom, i.e.,\nhypersensitivity, which notices any slight, real or\nimagined. In more recent versions of the psychiatric\nnomenclature, paranoid symptoms are not consid-\nered as central to any but the most severe mood\ndisorders, such as a severe major depression with\npsychotic features, a disorder which would be ex-\ntremely rare in community samples of older adults\n(DSM-IV, 1994). In the Duke EPESE sample, the two\n\"interpersonal problem\" items are not highly correl-\nated with the remainder of the CES-D (.30 for \"People\ndislike me\" and .29 for \"People are unfriendly\"), yet\nthey were highly related to each other. Therefore, in\nthese analyses, we used a positive response to either\nof these items as evidence of paranoid symptoms.\nThe remaining 18 items of the 20-item CES-D scale\nwere used to estimate depression as a control\nvariable.\nSensory deficit variables were constructed as fol-\nlows. Hearing deficit was measured dichotomously\nand was counted as positive if the respondent an-\nswered \"no\" to the item: \"[With/without a hearing\naid] can you usually hear and understand what a\nperson says without seeing his face if that person\ntalks in a normal voice to you in a quiet room?\" Visual\ndeficit was measured on a continuous scale (range 0-\n6), as the sum of six items which asked, [When\nwearing eyeglasses/contact lenses] \"can you see well\nenough to recognize a friend (1) across a street, (2)\nacross a room, (3) who is an arm's length away, (4) if\nyou get close to his face, (5) to read ordinary newspa-\nper print, and (6) to read large print such as newspa-\nper headlines?\"\nThe other variables utilized were measured as fol-\nlows. Age was determined by both self-report of age\nand report of date of birth. When inconsistencies\narose, date of birth was used to measure age. Race\nwas determined by both observation and report of\nrace. Cognitive impairment was determined by using\nthe Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire\n(Pfeiffer, 1975). Physical disability was determined by\nitems derived from three physical disability scales,\nthe Katz scale (an activity of daily living scale), the\nNagi Scale (a functional limitations scale), and the\nRosow and Breslau Scale (a mobility scale; Katz &\nStressful life events were determined by asking\nwhether a series of stressful events had occurred\nduring the previous year.\nAnalyses\nWe first developed a series of bivariate analyses\nusing the presence or absence of paranoid symptoms\nat baseline and follow-up and tested the significance\nof differences across the variables of interest using chi-\nsquare and t-test statistics. Then a logistic regression\nanalysis using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) soft-\nware was performed, which regressed Wave 2 para-\nnoia status on Wave 1 paranoia status on all indepen-\ndent variables and covariates measured at baseline.\nResults\nIn Tables 1 and 2, the characteristics of the total\nsample are presented. Differences in the characteris-\ntics of individuals demonstrating paranoid symptoms\n(compared to those without these symptoms) are\npresented for each wave. Of the 3,931 subjects avail-\nable for study at Wave 1, 2,936 subjects remained in\nthe sample at Wave 2. Paranoid symptoms were more\nfrequent in bivariate analyses among persons with\nhearing problems, among females, among blacks,\nand among persons not married at Wave 1. These\ntrends continued to Wave 2, except for differences\nby gender disappearing. However, 69% of the sub-\njects who reported paranoid symptoms at the first\ninterview did not report those symptoms at the fol-\nlow-up interview. Therefore, paranoid symptoms ap-\npear not to persist as a trait over the follow-up inter-\nval, even though the prevalence and cross-sectional\ncorrelates are similar at both interviews.\nIn Table 2, vision problems, older age, less educa-\ntion, lower income, impaired activities of daily living\nmobility (Rosow & Breslau, 1966), smaller social net-\nworks, less social interaction, presence of negative\nlife events, depressive symptoms, and cognitive im-\npairment were all associated with paranoid symp-\ntoms at both waves. (The Katz activities of daily living\n[ADL] was not significant at Wave 2, although the\ntrend was similar.)\nTable 1. Characteristics of Total Sample.

As can be seen, in\nthese cross-sectional models, neither hearing nor\nvision problems are associated with paranoid symp-\ntoms. In addition, many of the variables found to be\nassociated with paranoid symptoms in bivariate anal-\nyses were not associated in the multivariate logistic\nanalysis. Depressive symptoms, black race, less edu-\ncation, lower income and lower functioning on the\nRosow-Breslau scale remain associated with para-\nnoid symptoms.\nIn Table 4, paranoid symptoms at Wave 2 are re-\ngressed on paranoid symptoms at Wave 1 in two\nmodels, one containing vision problems and one\nhearing problems. As can be seen, paranoid symp-\ntoms at Wave 1 are a strong predictor of paranoid\nsymptoms at Wave 2, as are education and depres-\nsive symptoms. Vision problems at Wave 1 exhibited\na weak but positive relationship to paranoid symp-\ntoms at Wave 2.\nIn order to control for potential bias, we per-\nformed some additional analyses (data not shown).\nFirst, we compared the association of hearing prob-\nlems with paranoid symptoms (using alternately self-\nreported and interviewer-rated hearing problems).\nThe regressions were virtually identical. Second, we\nfound that among those subjects interviewed at\nWave 2, paranoid symptoms at Wave 1 did not distin-\nguish between subjects lost to follow-up and sub-\njects reinterviewed at Wave 2.\nDiscussion\nSample\nIn this study, we provide the first published data\nassessing the associates of paranoid symptoms at\nfollow-up in a community sample by self-reported\nTable 3.

A weak but\npositive association was found between baseline vis-\nual impairment and paranoid symptoms at follow-up.\nAs noted earlier, one explanation for paranoid\nsymptoms in late life is a persistent paranoid thought\nstyle over time. These data partially substantiate this\nhypothesis. The strongest predictor in the models of\nparanoid symptoms at Wave 2 is paranoid symptoms\nthree years earlier at Wave 1. Overall, however, para-\nnoid symptoms did not increase in frequency among\nthose persons followed-up three years later, and\ntwo-thirds of those subjects who reported paranoid\nsymptoms at Wave 1 did not report them at Wave 2.\nGiven the relatively short follow-up interval, it is\ndifficult to determine whether age in fact is associ-\nated with increased symptoms. In cross-sectional\nanalyses, age did exhibit a significant positive associ-\nation with paranoid symptoms.\nAs has been demonstrated elsewhere (Christen-\nson & Blazer, 1984), cross-sectional studies usually\nfind an association of paranoid symptoms with cog-\nnitive status, psychiatric symptoms, social network,\nand functional impairment. This was true in the bi-\nvariate analysis in this study. However, in a multivari-\nate analysis of the Wave 1 data, social support mea-\nsures, age, gender, marital status, negative life\nevents, and cognitive impairment were no longer\nassociated with paranoid symptoms. The effect of\ncognitive impairment may be lessened by controlling\nfor depressive symptoms. This attenuation of the\nrelationship with paranoid symptoms may also be\ntrue of negative life events and social support. Race\ncontinued to be a strong correlate of paranoid symp-\ntoms in multivariate analyses of the Wave 1 data, but\nwas not a significant predictor of paranoid symptoms\nin the longitudinal analyses. Perhaps paranoid symp-\ntoms are state phenomena in both blacks and non-\nblacks, yet phenomena determined by different fac-\ntors depending upon race. In blacks, paranoid\nsymptoms may represent an appropriate response to\na hostile environment rather than a psychopathic\ntrait.\nThere are a number of strengths to this study. First,\nthe sample is a large one and is equally distributed\nbetween blacks and non-blacks and urban and rural\nresidents. Follow-up was excellent for a community\nstudy, and there were no apparent differences be-\ntween individuals who were interviewed at follow-up\nand those lost to follow-up. In addition, a number of\nfactors which could contribute to paranoid symp-\ntoms other than the independent variables of inter-\nest (difficulty hearing and seeing) were available in\nthe data. These included measures of cognitive im-\npairment, functional impairment, and depressive\nsymptoms. The CES-D scale is useful for exploring\nthe relationship between paranoid symptoms and\ndepressive symptoms, given that the two items\nwithin the CES-D used to assess paranoid symptoms\nload on a separate factor, are highly related to each\nother, and correlate less with other items in the\nscale.\nOn the other hand, some problems are inherent in\nthe study design. First, only two items were used to\nassess paranoid symptoms, i.e., \"People were un-\nfriendly\" and \"I felt that people disliked me.\"\nThough these items or similar items are frequently\nused in scales to assess interpersonal difficulties in\nparanoid thinking, they also may be based in reality.\nThe prevalence of paranoid symptoms using these\nitems, 9.5% at baseline and 8.1% at follow-up, is\nsomewhat higher than has been recorded for para-\nnoid symptoms in previous community surveys (2-\n4%). The estimate is significantly higher than the\ncommunity-based estimates of schizophrenic disor-\nders in late life (which are usually well below 1% in\ncommunity samples in older adults).\nA second problem is that hearing problems were\nbased on self-assessment. The Kappa value between\nself-assessment and assessment by the interviewer\nwas moderate (.36). The models did not change,\nhowever, when interviewer-rated rather than self-\nreported hearing problems were used. We recognize\nthat self-reported hearing problems cannot be auto-\nmatically assumed to represent true difficulties with\nhearing, nor does lack of report of hearing problems\nnecessarily assure that hearing problems are not\npresent. Another problem might be that assessment\nof visual problems was based on a scale that included\nmultiple items, rather than simply asking whether\nthe subject suffered from visual impairment or not\n(in contrast to the assessment of hearing difficulties).\nUsing EPESE data from other sites, Salive et al. (1992)\nfound that, while there was some discordance, self-\nreports of visual acuity correlated well with the mea-\n74 The Gerontologist\nsured activity. Therefore, the concordance between\nself-report and interviewer report (or measurement)\nvaries by the sensory modality measured.\nFinally, the reader must not equate the findings in\nthis paper with the considerable literature on the\nrelationship between perceptual problems and late\nlife paraphrenia (or schizophrenic disorders in late\nlife). Though there clearly is an association between\nschizophrenia-like disorders and endorsement of\nitems used in this survey, persons responding posi-\ntively on the items used in this study include many\nmore individuals than would have been identified\nwith a standardized interview for psychiatric disor-\nders. Even so, we believe it important to explore the\ncorrelates and temporal relationships of paranoid\nsymptoms in community samples, irrespective of\ndiagnosis.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.
