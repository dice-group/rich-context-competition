Introduction\nTobacco use is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States [1]. An\nestimated 20.8% of American adults (18 years of age) currently smoke cigarettes [2] and annually,\ncigarette smoking results in approximately 443,000 deaths [3]. The annual economic cost of smoking\nin the United States is estimated at $193 billion ($96 billion in direct health care expenditures and $97\nbillion in lost productivity) [3,4]. Both current smokers and former smokers experience higher health\ncare utilization and incur higher medical expenditures than never smokers [5-9]. Data from\nrandomized, controlled clinical trials indicate that differences in outpatient and inpatient health care\nutilization by smoking status exist [10]. They observed that former smokers increased their average\noutpatient visits by approximately two visits during the first year of cessation, while outpatient health\ncare use was relatively unchanged among continuing smokers [10]. Within four years of cessation,\nhowever, both inpatient and outpatient health care utilization were significantly lower among former\nsmokers than those who continued smoking. Another study found that higher health care utilization\nand costs appear to begin prior to cessation due to a major health event that may have prompted\ncessation [11]. Increases in health care utilization during the first year of cessation may be due to\nfollow-up care for an acute health event or recurrence of the acute health event that led to the decision\nto quit smoking [11].\nSocio-demographic characteristics are important determinants of health care utilization in the\nUnited States and need to be considered when assessing the relationship between smoking and health\ncare utilization. For example, women are more likely to utilize health care than men, as are elderly\npersons with lower levels of income/less education, and those with health insurance [12]. Most other\nstudies on health care utilization and smoking have looked at selected populations such as members of\nhealth care management organizations (HMOs) [6-11,13].\nImportant to note are recent changes in patterns of smoking. For example, cigarette smoking among\nadults has decreased dramatically during the last 40 years [2] and widespread implementation of\neffective tobacco control programs and policies has been found to be effective at reducing initiation,\nincreasing smoking cessation, and reducing exposure to secondhand smoke [14,15]. In addition, the\nnumber of effective cessation therapies now available has increased over time along with insurance\ncoverage for effective cessation treatments [16,17]. At the same time more tobacco products are being\nintroduced into the marketplace than ever before, and smokers are more likely to use multiple tobacco\nproducts which will have an additional impact on their health [4,15,18-22]. Patterns of who is quitting\nand when they quit may be changing, and these changes in the populations of current and former\nsmokers may be affecting their health care utilization.\nThe purpose of the current study was to assess disparities in health care utilization by smoking\nstatus among a national sample of adults. It is important to look at this question in a population-based\nstudy because samples from HMOs tend to be among healthier people and of higher economic status\nthan the general population. It is also important to use recent national data because of the multiple\nchanges in smoking status.\n2. Methods\nTo estimate health care utilization by smoking status of U.S. adults, we used 1999\u00ad2004 National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. NHANES is a nationally-representative\nsurvey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assess the health and\nnutritional status of adults and children in the United States through interviews and direct physical\nexaminations. The surveys contain information on current and past smoking behaviors, health care\nutilization, and demographic characteristics of the study population. The sample size in this study\nconsisted of 15,332 adults (18 years of age) and the data for the analyses was weighted.\nSelf-reported inpatient utilization was measured by whether respondents were hospitalized in the\npast year and by the number of times respondents were hospitalized in the past year. Self-reported\noutpatient utilization was measured by whether respondents had an outpatient visit with a medical\nprovider in the past year and by the total number of visits respondents had in the past year. For the\nanalysis, the number of inpatient admissions and outpatient visits were each grouped into two levels.\nFor inpatient utilization, we looked at those who indicated that they had been hospitalized and also\nwho indicated that they had been hospitalized 2 times in the past year. Outpatient visits were also\ncategorized as those who had an outpatient visit in the past year and those who indicated they had 4\noutpatient visits in the past year. Respondents were asked whether they had smoked at least 100\ncigarettes in their entire life to classify their smoking status. Those who answered \"yes\" were asked\nwhether they now smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all. For our analysis, current\nsmokers were those who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and, at the time of the\ninterview, reported smoking either every day or some days. Former smokers were those who reported\nsmoking at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime but currently did not smoke. We grouped former\nsmokers into four categories based on the length of time since they quit smoking (<2 yrs, 2\u00ad4 yrs, 5\u00ad9\nyrs, and 10 yrs). Never smokers were those who reported never having smoked 100 cigarettes during\ntheir lifetime. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between\nsmoking status (current, former, and never smoker) and health care utilization controlling for the\nfollowing respondent demographic characteristics: gender, race/ethnicity, age, education, poverty level\n(based on year of survey), and health insurance coverage using SUDAAN 9.0.1 (Research Triangle\nInstitute, Cary, North Carolina). Our referent groups for smoking status and demographic\ncharacteristics included never smoker, male, Non-Hispanic white, those 18\u00ad24 years old, those with\nmore than a high school education, those living at or above poverty level, and those with no health\ninsurance coverage. We used the Wald statistic to determine whether the odds ratios were statistically\n3. Results\nnever smokers and 25.0% were former smokers. Among all respondents, 3.3% reported quitting less\n10 years prior to the survey.\nTable 1 shows the distribution of demographic characteristics of current, former, and never\nsmokers. Current (54.1%) and former (50.8%\u00ad57.1%) smokers included a higher proportion of men\nthan never smokers (40.8%). The highest proportion of respondents were Non-Hispanic whites.\nCurrent smokers were younger than never smokers and former smokers who quit smoking for >2\nyears. Over one-half of never and former smokers had more than a high school education; this\nproportion was higher than that of current smokers (39.1%). Current smokers were more likely to have\nincomes below the poverty level (18.9%) and to have no health insurance coverage (30.1%) than\nFormer smokers who quit smoking less than 2 years prior to the survey had a higher proportion of\nhospitalization in the past year (19.6%) compared with current smokers (10.7%), never smokers\n(12.9%). Among those who had been hospitalized in the past year, current smokers (22.9%) and never\nsmokers (21.1%) had been hospitalized 2 times. Regardless of smoking status, the majority of\nrespondents had at least one outpatient visit in the past year. However, 23.3% of current smokers had\nno outpatient visits in the past year, compared with 8.3%\u00ad17.9% of those in the other groups. Among\nthose who had an outpatient visit in the past year, former smokers were more likely to have 4\nTable 1.

Discussion\nAdjusted multivariate analyses confirmed that former smokers who quit within the last two years\nhave more hospital visits than never smokers. We also found that both former smokers and current\nsmokers have more outpatient visits than never smokers. The health and economic burden caused by\ncigarette smoking in the United States has been well documented [3,4,13,19,21,23]. Findings from our\nanalysis show that current smokers were more likely to be hospitalized than never smokers. The\nanalysis also showed that among those who had an outpatient visit in the past year, current smokers\nwere more likely to have 4 outpatient visits than never smokers. Smoking has been found to have\nadverse health effects such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease [1]. Therefore,\ncurrent and former smokers are likely to have higher rates of hospitalization and outpatient visits than\nnever smokers.\nAmong former smokers, we observed that inpatient and outpatient utilization (having been\nhospitalized, having had an outpatient visit, and among those who had an outpatient visit having >4\nvisits in the past year) was higher during the period immediately (<2 years) after quitting than other\nperiods. Other population-based studies and studies among HMO populations also have observed that\nformer smokers accrue higher health care costs during the period immediately after quitting which\ndissipates within a period of 1\u00ad4 years [10,13,24]. This phenomenon may be due to the fact that people\nwho recently quit may have experienced major health events that have prompted them to quit smoking\nThis study has some limitations. Estimates of cigarette smoking were based on self-reporting and\nwere not validated with biochemical tests. However, self-reported smoking status has validity when\ncompared with measured serum cotinine levels and yields similar population prevalence estimates\n[26]. Nevertheless, there is the potential for recall bias as to when the smokers actually quit. The\nlonger the period of time since quitting, the more likely their recollection bias may be [27]. However, a\nstudy of middle-aged adults observed that they were able to accurately recall their smoking status of\n20 years earlier and those who did not accurately recall their smoking status were more likely to\nmisclassify themselves as never smokers than former smokers (which may have biased the results in\nour study towards the null) [28]. Secondly, since the data were from cross-sectional yearly surveys, it\nwas not possible to analyze respondents' past health care utilization in order to establish causality.\nThirdly, we did not examine the relationship between smoking patterns (either daily/some day or\namount of cigarettes consumed) and health care utilization among current smokers. Current smokers\nrepresent a heterogeneous group and include persons who have just started to smoke, persons with\nestablished patterns of nondaily smoking and established daily smokers. Blacks, Hispanics, younger\nsmokers, and smokers with higher levels of education are more likely to be nondaily smokers than\nother socio-demographic groups [29]. They are also less likely to have emphysema or cancer than\ndaily smokers [29]. Future analyses should examine the relationships between smoking patterns and\nhealth care utilization among both current and former smokers (i.e., total duration of smoking, age of\ninitiation, and for current smokers the amount that they smoke). Despite the limitations, our use of a\nnationally-representative sample in our study strengthens our understanding of the relationship\nbetween smoking and health care utilization. Our findings are consistent with the results of other\nstudies that have found smoking to increase hospitalization and outpatient utilization.\nSmoking cessation has health benefits for persons of all ages [28]. For example, our results showed\nthat the likelihood of being hospitalized in the past year was similar for former smokers of >2 years\nand never smokers. For those who continue to smoke, increased health care utilization translates into\nhigher medical costs--therefore making smoking cessation beneficial to reducing the health-related\nand economic burden on the individual and society. Each year smoking costs $96 billion in direct\nhealth care expenditures, not to mention $97 billion in productivity losses. Specifically, smoking-\nrelated diseases such as lung cancer, COPD, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are\ncostly [4,30]. Approximately 70% of adult smokers in the United States report that they would like to\nquit smoking and 44% actually attempt to quit each year [2,31]. Treatments for tobacco dependence\nare effective and multiple attempts at quitting and repeated interventions are often needed for\nindividuals to completely stop smoking [21]. Therefore, smokers should be encouraged to utilize\navailable treatments including counseling and anti-smoking medications. The public health community\nshould assist smokers--including young adults--in their attempts to quit so that more smokers can\nquit before they experience adverse health problems [1,32]. Persons who quit before 35 years of age\nhave similar life expectancy as those who have never smoked [33].\nAlthough the number of effective cessation treatments has increased over time, most smokers are\nnot using these methods [34]. Sixty-nine percent of smokers report being advised by their physician to\nquit, while 22% of smokers engage in behavioral counseling (e.g., quitlines, group therapy, etc.) or use\neffective smoking cessation medications which are associated with slightly higher cessation rates\n[35,36]. Quitlines, which provide free smoking cessation counseling, are now available in every state\nand can be accessed by calling 1-800-QUIT NOW. Comprehensive tobacco control programs\nincluding, increasing the price of cigarettes, clean indoor air laws, mass media campaigns, insurance\ncoverage for cessation therapies, and health system changes (to remind providers to counsel for\ntobacco use cessation) have also been shown to be effective in increasing cessation.[4,15,37]. Cigarette\nsmoking has decreased dramatically over the past 40 years; the decrease, however, has slowed in past\nfew years [2]. Widespread comprehensive tobacco programs should further decrease the prevalence of\nsmoking and associated health care utilization and costs [38].\nReferences\n1.
