Human epidemiological\nstudies that use birth weight as a proxy for fetal malnutrition fail to identify specific aspects of maternal nutrition\nresponsible for programming.\nMethods and Results--We examined how maternal nutrition during pregnancy and infant birth weight relate to systolic\nand diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) in 2026 Filipino adolescents. Data were collected prospectively during the Cebu\n(Philippines) Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. Women were assessed at 30 weeks gestation, and children\nwere followed from birth through adolescence. Regression models were used to examine how the mothers' total energy\nintake, percentage of energy from protein and fat, triceps skinfold thickness during pregnancy, and infant birth weight\nrelate to adolescent BP, controlling for current age, height, and body mass index and other potential confounders.\nMaternal triceps skinfold thickness was significantly inversely related to SBP among boys and to DBP in boys and girls.\nMaternal nutrition variables attenuated but did not eliminate an inverse birth weight\u00adSBP relationship in boys. SBP was\nsignificantly inversely related to the mothers' percent of dietary energy from protein in boys. Among girls, SBP and\nDBP were inversely related to the mothers' percentage of calories from fat. There was no evidence of confounding of\nthese relationships by current diet, maturation status, physical activity, or socioeconomic status.\nConclusions--Maternal diet composition and energy stores in the form of subcutaneous fat have long-term effects on\nKey Words: blood pressure  adolescents  pregnancy  nutrition\nThere is considerable evidence for an inverse relationship\nbetween birth weight and blood pressure (BP) later in\nlife.1 Because fetal growth is largely a reflection of nutrient\nand oxygen supply to the fetus, it is widely assumed that\nprenatal nutrition is the most important programming stimu-\nlus.2 The fetal programming hypothesis has led to the hope\nthat the risk of hypertension and other chronic diseases in\nfuture generations might be reduced through improvements in\nmaternal nutrition during pregnancy.3 Birth weight is the\nmost commonly used measure of the quality of the prenatal\nenvironment, but it is widely recognized as an imperfect\nproxy for fetal nutrition. It is at best a sensitive but nonspe-\ncific indicator of fetal growth reflective of a range of genetic,\nhormonal, and nutritional factors. At present, the best evi-\ndence that nutrition is an important programming stimulus\ncomes from studies of rats, showing that maternal protein\nrestriction during pregnancy leads to reduced birth weight\nand elevated BP in offspring.4,5\nDespite promising leads in animal models, few studies\nhave directly tested the fetal nutrition hypothesis in humans\nby assessing the role of maternal nutritional status or dietary\nintake during pregnancy. Several studies used maternal an-\nthropometry to indicate nutritional status during pregnancy.\nClark and colleagues6 found that maternal weight gain be-\ntween 18 and 28 weeks gestation was inversely related to\noffspring BP among women with below-median triceps\nskinfold thickness at 18 weeks gestation. Godfrey et al7\nsimilarly found an inverse relation between maternal skinfold\nthickness during pregnancy and offspring BP in Jamaican\nchildren. In contrast, the study by Laor and colleagues8 of BP\nin Jewish military conscripts found no evidence for an\nassociation between BP and birth weight, maternal body mass\nindex (BMI) before pregnancy, or weight gain during\npregnancy.\nSeveral studies have used the \"natural experiment\" of\nfamine to test the hypothesis, but results have generally been\ncontrary to expectations. Prenatal exposure to the Leningrad\nSiege was found not to relate to adult BP.9 In the Dutch\nFamine Study, individuals exposed to famine in utero did not\nhave elevated BP as adults, but their adult BP related\ninversely to birth weight.10,11 A recent study from this cohort\nfound an inverse association between BP and the ratio of\nprotein to carbohydrates in the mother's diet during the third,\nbut not the first or second trimester, as reflected in ration\nFrom the Department of Nutrition, Schools of Public Health and Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (L.S.A.); the Department of\nAnthropology, Emory University, Atlanta, Ga (C.W.K.); and the Office of Population Studies, University of San Carlos, Cebu, Philippines (J.B.).\nCorrespondence to Linda S.

Thus, the few\nstudies that include measures of maternal nutritional stress or\nnutritional status during pregnancy provide mixed support for\nthe hypothesis that maternal nutrition is key to programming\nin humans.\nOur study examines the relationship of size at birth to BP\nin Filipino adolescents, with and without considering indica-\ntors of maternal nutritional status and dietary intake during\npregnancy. Our detailed longitudinal data also allow us to test\nfor potentially confounding variables such as current lifestyle\nfactors. Finally, we assess the contribution of current mater-\nnal BP.\nSurvey Design and Sample\nData come from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition\nSurvey (CLHNS). This ongoing community-based survey\nstudy area is Metro Cebu, the second largest metropolitan\narea of the Philippines. The 33 communities randomly\nselected for the survey include densely populated urban and\nperiurban neighborhoods and more isolated rural villages in\nthe mountains or nearby islands.\nAll pregnant women in the selected communities were\ninitially invited to participate and were included in the\nlongitudinal study if they gave birth between May 1, 1983,\nlow (3%), but no data are available on those who declined\nparticipation. Women were measured and completed a single\n24-hour dietary recall during a baseline survey at a mean of\n304 weeks gestation. Although numerous follow-up sur-\nveys compose the CLHNS, the present analysis focuses on\nsurvey when adolescents were 14 to 16 years of age.\nAs indicators of the mother's nutritional status during\npregnancy, we used triceps skinfold thickness and dietary\nintakes of protein, fat, and total energy at 30 weeks gestation.\nInfant length was measured within 6 days of birth by trained\nproject staff using custom length boards. For hospital births,\nbirth weight was measured with hospital scales. Infants born\nat home were measured by birth attendants provided with\nSalter hanging-type scales and trained in their use. Gesta-\ntional age was estimated from the mothers' reports of last\nmenstrual period date. If this was unknown, if pregnancy\ncomplications occurred, or if the infant weighed 2.5 kg at\nbirth, gestational age was determined by the Ballard meth-\nod.13 BMI was calculated as a measure of relative weight.\nAnthropometric assessments in adolescents included\nweight; height; arm, waist, and hip circumferences; and\ntriceps and subscapular skinfolds. Dietary intakes were mea-\nsured with two 24-hour recalls on consecutive days, and the\nmean was used in analyses. Energy and nutrient intakes were\ncalculated from Philippines Food Composition Tables pro-\nduced by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the\nPhilippines. We included total energy and protein intakes in\nour models. Physical activity was measured by Caltrac\naccelerometer. Activity levels were categorized into high,\naverage, and low, representing thirds of the distribution of\n24-hour Caltrac accelerometer counts. Adolescents were\nasked about their smoking history and current smoking. BP\nwas measured in triplicate with a mercury sphygmomanom-\neter after a 10-minute seated rest, and the mean was used in\nanalyses. The same interviewer measured the adolescent's\nand the mother's BP. The mother's BP during her pregnancy\nwith the index child was not measured. Household socioeco-\nnomic status is represented by total household income and\npossession of a television. We expect socioeconomic vari-\nables to affect BP primarily through more proximate deter-\nminants, such as nutritional status and diet, but we include\nthem in analyses to account for other unmeasured determi-\nnants of BP (such as stress levels).\nadolescents were located and included in the 1998 follow-up\nsurvey. Of these, 2026 had birth and current measurements,\nand they form the main analysis sample. Slightly fewer\nsubjects (n1881) had maternal BP data. Birth weight and\nlength and BP in adolescence were not significantly different\nin those with and without missing data. When data were\nsurveyed before boys. Consequently, boys are 1 year older\nthan girls. All analyses are stratified by sex.\nAnalysis Methods\nSystolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) were analyzed as\ncontinuous variables by ordinary least-squares regression. We\nfirst examined the relationship of birth characteristics to\nadolescent BP, controlling for current age, height, and BMI.\nWe sequentially added maternal nutritional and BP variables.\nWe tested for confounding by current diet, activity, and\nsocioeconomic status of the adolescents, but because none of\nthese variables were shown to be confounders, we excluded\nthem from the final models.\nResults\nCharacteristics of study participants are given in Table 1.\nCebu adolescents are relatively short and thin compared with\nUS adolescents. Compared with the new National Center for\nHealth Statistics reference,14 mean height z scores were\nhad a BMI below the 10th percentile. This BMI distribution\nreflects delayed maturation relative to the US populations and\na higher prevalence of undernutrition. Median age at men-\narche was 13.1 years.15 No girls reported currently smoking,\nbut 5.5% of boys reported currently smoking regularly. Low\nbirth weight (2.5 kg) occurred in 10.0% of the analysis\nsample, and 20.4% were small for gestational age (birth\nweight for gestational age below the 10th percentile of a\ncommonly used reference population). We have no data on\nprepregnancy BMI. On the basis of weight 2 months after\ngiving birth, 15% of women had a BMI suggestive of\nchronic energy deficiency (BMI18.5).\nThere was no significant crude relationship of birth weight,\nlength, or gestational age to SBP or DBP in boys or girls.\nGestational age had no significant main effect, nor did it\nAdair et al Maternal Nutrition Programs Adolescent BP 1035\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nmodify the effects of birth weight or length, so it was dropped\nfrom subsequent models. The adolescent's current diet, ac-\ntivity, maturation status, household socioeconomic status, and\nhousehold socioeconomic status during the mother's preg-\nnancy were not consistently associated with BP, nor did they\nsubstantially alter the relationship of birth or maternal char-\nacteristics to BP. Accordingly, we focus on results from 4\nmodels. Model 1 includes birth weight and length and current\nage, height, and BMI. Model 2 adds maternal anthropometry\nduring pregnancy, model 3 adds maternal diet during preg-\nnancy, and model 4 adds current maternal BP. Results for\nSBP and DBP are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.\nSystolic BP\nIn boys, there was a significant inverse relationship of birth\nweight to SBP only after control for current height, age, and\nBMI (Table 2, model 1). As expected, SBP was highly related\nto current age, height, and BMI in both boys and girls.\nMaternal height and triceps skinfold thickness during\npregnancy were significantly inversely related to SBP in\nboys. Addition of maternal pregnancy variables in model 2\nattenuated but did not eliminate the birth weight\u00adSBP rela-\ntionship. Birth size and maternal anthropometric variables\nwere unrelated to SBP in girls. The relationship of maternal\ndiet variables during pregnancy differed in boys and girls\n(model 3). In boys, percent of dietary energy from protein\nwas inversely related to SBP, whereas in girls, a higher\npercentage of calories from fat was significantly associated\nwith lower SBP. The relationship of the mothers' height and\nskinfold thickness during pregnancy to SBP remained virtu-\nally unchanged when birth weight and length were omitted\n(not shown). The mother's SBP was significantly related to\nSBP in boys and girls (model 4), suggesting either a genetic\neffect or an unmeasured effect of a shared environment.\nAs judged by the R2 values, birth and maternal nutritional\ncharacteristics played a minor role. Birth weight, however, is\nsignificantly positively related to height and BMI in adoles-\ncence and thus may have direct and indirect effects on BP.\nDiastolic BP\nAmong girls, birth length was inversely related to DBP after\ncontrol for current size. This weak relationship was un-\nTABLE 1.

There\nwas no relationship of birth size to DBP in boys. Maternal\nskinfold thickness during pregnancy was inversely related to\nDBP in boys and girls, independent of birth weight and\nlength. A higher fat content in the mother's diet during\npregnancy was significantly associated with lower DBP in\ngirls, but there were no significant maternal diet\u00adBP relation-\nships among boys. The mother's DBP was significantly\nassociated with boys' and girls' DBP in adolescence.\nDiscussion\nThe inverse relationship of size at birth with BP at later ages\nis now well established by substantial animal and human\nepidemiological evidence, although in humans, the relation-\nship is weakest during adolescence.1 Animal models of\ndietary restriction during pregnancy implicate inadequate\nmaternal nutrition as the critical determinant of altered\nphysiology leading to elevated BP. Evidence from human\nstudies of maternal nutrition during pregnancy, however, is\nsparse. Godfrey et al7 found an inverse relationship of\nmaternal triceps skinfold thickness at 15 weeks of pregnancy\nwith SBP in a small sample of 10- to 12-year-old Jamaican\nchildren, but Laor et al8 found no relationship of maternal\nanthropometry during pregnancy with BP in a large study of\n17-year-old Israeli youths. Our study shows that low maternal\nfat stores at 30 weeks gestation are associated with higher\nSBP and DBP in adolescent boys. Consistent with other\nstudies,1 we also observed an inverse relationship of birth\nweight to SBP in boys. The SBP\u00adbirth weight relationship,\nhowever, was attenuated (but not eliminated) when maternal\ntriceps skinfold thickness was taken into account. The signif-\nicant association of maternal triceps skinfold with BP, inde-\npendent of birth weight, suggests that maternal nutrition is\nindeed an important programming stimulus. Our earlier\nCLHNS studies show that maternal height and triceps skin-\nfold thicknesses during pregnancy significantly predict infant\nbirth weight and length.16 Our BP results, however, suggest\nthat important aspects of maternal nutrition during pregnancy\nare not fully captured by birth weight. At the same time, the\nmarginal birth-weight relationship with SBP in boys after\nmaternal nutrition is accounted for suggests that birth weight\nserves as a marker for factors unrelated to the aspects of\nmaternal nutrition measured in this study.\nThere are several possible explanations for this finding.\nFirst, our limited measures of maternal nutrition during\npregnancy most likely leave much variation in these factors\nunmeasured. The birth-weight effect in boys might have been\nfurther reduced if we had more comprehensive measures of\nmaternal nutritional status. Alternatively, birth weight may be\na proxy for some nonnutritional aspect of the maternal or fetal\nenvironment. For example, fetal exposure to maternal glu-\ncocorticoids triggered in response to stress reduces fetal\ngrowth in rats and permanently programs activity of the\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in offspring, with effects\non postnatal BP regulation.17\nLittle is known about which specific aspects of maternal\ndiet serve as programming stimuli. Most animal models of\nfetal programming of BP impose maternal dietary protein\nrestriction during gestation,5 although one study18 imposed a\n30% energy restriction. The generalizability of these results\nto human populations may be limited, because highly re-\nstricted protein or energy intakes in the absence of other\nnutrient deficiencies are not typically seen in humans. We\nexamined total energy intakes and the relative contribution of\nprotein and fat in the maternal diet during pregnancy. Among\nadolescent boys, SBP was inversely related to the mother's\npercentage of energy intake from protein during late gesta-\nTABLE 3.

This is consistent with\nanimal models that document elevated BP in the offspring of\nrats fed a protein-deficient diet during pregnancy.5,19 In girls,\nSBP and DBP were inversely related to the mother's percent-\nage of energy intake from fat during pregnancy.\nIn a study of Aberdeen adults, Campbell et al20 found\ndifferent effects of the mother's carbohydrate intake on BP,\ndepending on the level of animal protein in the diet, with\nlow-carbohydrate, high-protein intakes related to reduced\nplacental size and increased BP later in life. These relation-\nships diverge from our findings, which suggest a BP-lowering\neffect of maternal protein intake during pregnancy, as indi-\ncated by the percentage of calories derived from protein. Our\nfindings are consistent with the recent observations of Rose-\nboom and colleagues,12 who find evidence for an inverse\nassociation between the ratio of protein to carbohydrates in\nthe maternal diet during the third trimester and offspring BP\nbut no association between total calories, protein, fat, or\ncarbohydrates and offspring BP. Our findings are similar in\nshowing a lack of association of total maternal energy intake\nwith offspring BP but an inverse association with percentage\nof calories from protein. These results suggest an effect of\ndiet composition rather than total intake. Given the potential\nfor future public health preventive measures through altered\nmaternal diet during pregnancy, there remains a need to\nclarify the role of the macronutrient and micronutrient com-\nposition of the maternal diet and its consequences for off-\nspring physiology.\nWe find marked sex differences in relationships of early\nexposures to BP. Other studies find inconsistent sex differ-\nences: some find effects in boys, others in girls, but as yet, no\nphysiological models have been proposed to explain these\nfindings. Among adolescents, maturational stage, insulin\nresistance, and sex steroid levels are believed to alter BP\nduring puberty.21 Inclusion of maturation variables did not\nreduce sex differences in our results, nor did maturation status\nmodify or confound the relationship of birth weight or\nmaternal nutritional status with adolescent BP. Measurements\nof sex steroids are needed, however, to clarify the physiolog-\nical basis for sex differences in relationships between prenatal\nexposures and later risk for cardiovascular disease.\nThe present study helps fill important gaps in the fetal\nprogramming literature. First, few studies have been con-\nducted on adolescents in a developing country context, where\nfetal programming may have the greatest importance. In\ncountries undergoing a nutrition transition, high rates of fetal\ngrowth retardation in previous decades are now being fol-\nlowed by substantial improvements in socioeconomic status\nand a concomitant increase in exposure to cardiovascular\ndisease risk factors, such as sedentary lifestyle and increased\nenergy and fat intakes, which are contributing to increasing\nobesity prevalence.22 Our results suggest that maternal nutri-\ntion during pregnancy and fetal growth outcomes have\nlong-term implications for BP regulation in a population\nrelatively early in the nutrition transition.\nSecond, other studies have raised questions about the\ndegree to which the relationship of maternal nutrition or birth\nweight to BP is confounded by exposure to other risk factors\nin the period between birth and the measurement of BP. We\nobserved no confounding by the adolescent's diet, activity,\nmaturational status, or indicators of socioeconomic status.\nThird, our study may contribute to the debate surrounding\nthe possible role of genetic factors with common influences\non fetal growth and BP regulation23 by assessing the role of\nthe mother's BP. Although we do not directly assess specific\ngenetic factors, our inclusion of maternal BP provides indi-\nrect evidence of a possible role of genetics. Inclusion of\nmaternal BP in multivariate models strengthened associations\nbetween birth length and BP in girls and between maternal\nnutritional status and BP in boys. Thus, although there may\nbe some genetic determination of BP (as shown by the\npositive association of maternal and adolescent BP), the\nassociations that we document are not likely to be explained\nby genetic factors with common effects on BP and our\nperinatal predictor variables.\nIn summary, this study supports the hypothesis that\nmaternal nutritional status during pregnancy has long-term\nimplications for offspring BP regulation in humans. Low\nmaternal energy stores during pregnancy predict higher\nSBP and DBP in adolescent boys. Although inconsistent in\nboys and girls, the inverse association of maternal protein\nintake and offspring BP is consistent with findings in\nanimal models and deserving of further exploration in\nhuman populations.\n"
