Caffrey2\n Introduction\nAlbuminuria is an important and independent risk\nmarker for cardiovascular disease in the general popula-\ntion and, more specifically, in patients with hypertension\nand diabetes mellitus (1-3). Whether albuminuria is a con-\ntributory factor in atherothrombosis or merely a marker\nremains unclear. However, evidence suggests that com-\nmon pathophysiologic processes such as endothelial\ndysfunction, chronic low-grade inflammation, and trans-\nvascular leakage of macromolecules may underlie the as-\nsociation between microalbuminuria and cardiovascular\ndisease (4). Microalbuminuria is also considered an early\nsign of intrarenal vascular dysfunction and a potent\nmarker for the subsequent development of progressive\nkidney disease (5-7).\nAlbuminuria is associated with increases in all-cause\nand cardiovascular mortality in uncomplicated hyperten-\nsives and type 2 diabetics (8, 9). When combined as indi-\ncators of renal dysfunction, decreased glomerular\nfiltration rate and albuminuria predict both all-cause\nand cardiovascular mortality (10). In the Prevention of\nRenal and Vascular End Stage Disease study conducted\nin the Netherlands, a 2-fold increase of albuminuria\nfor cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality,\nrespectively (1).\nThe Prevention of Renal and Vascular End Stage\nDisease study proposed that albuminuria-associated\nnoncardiovascular deaths might represent greater fatali-\nties due to malignant neoplasms, although specific etiol-\nogies were not analyzed. Little is known regarding the\nassociation of albuminuria with cancer mortality.

The objective of this study was to test the\nhypothesis by evaluating the relationship between albu-\nminuria and cancer mortality using the large-scale\nnationally representative sample from the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III,\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy design and population\nNHANES III was conducted by the National Center for\nmultistage, and cluster sampling design to obtain a rep-\nresentative sample of the non-institutionalized civilian\nU.S. population. Detailed survey operations manuals,\nconsent documents, and brochures of the NHANES are\navailable on the NHANES web site (11). The NHANES\nIII was reviewed and approved by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics Institutional Review Board. Of\nNHANES III interview and examination between 1988\nand 1994, the current analysis was limited to non-\nHispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Mexican\nAmericans by excluding 266 participants identified as\nother race. Participants with previous history of malig-\nnancy (n = 547), missing data for follow-up information\n(n = 19), and other covariates (e.g., urinary albumin mea-\nsurement, n = 664) were also excluded from the cohort.\nwomen) in the analyses represent an estimated U.S.\n50 and older after adjusting for sample weights.\nBaseline demographics\nIn NHANES III, data were collected at all study sites\nby trained personnel according to standardized pro-\ncedures. Information on age, sex, and smoking status\nwas self-reported. Subjects with serum cotinine values\n>14 ng/mL were classified as current smokers, otherwise\nas nonsmokers (13). Subjects were classified as diabetic\nbased on a self-reported diagnosis, prescribed medication\nfor diabetes (insulin or oral agents), or a fasting plasma\ntension was assigned if the subjects reported taking\nprescribed medication for hypertension, a physician di-\nagnosis of hypertension, or if the systolic blood pressure\nwas 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure was\n90 mm Hg. Three to four blood pressure (BP) determi-\nnations were made using a mercury sphygmomanometer\nfrom the right arm by a physician. Averaged systolic and\ndiastolic blood pressure determinations were obtained.\nBody mass index (BMI) was defined as body weight\n(kg) divided by the square of the body height (m2). Blood\nwas sampled, processed locally, stored, and then shipped\nto central laboratories for analysis (12).\nDefinition of albuminuria\nA spot urine sample was collected to determine uri-\nnary albumin using a solid phase fluorescent immunoas-\nsay, capable of measuring values below the limit of\ndetection by the dipstick method (16). Urine creatinine\nwas analyzed using the Jaff\u00e9 reaction. The urinary albu-\nmin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR in mg/mmol) was calcu-\nlated by dividing the urinary albumin value by the\nurinary creatinine concentration for each subject. The\npresence of albuminuria was defined as UACR >2.5\nmg/mmol in men and >3.5 mg/mmol in women (17).\nSerum creatinine was measured by means of the mod-\nified kinetic Jaff\u00e9 reaction, and standardized serum creat-\ninine values were calibrated by using an enzymatic\ncreatinine assay traceable to a gold standard reference\nmethod (18). The glomerular filtration rate was calculat-\ned from the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD)\nStudy equation: MDRD estimated glomerular filtration\nAfrican American; ref. 19). The presence of chronic\nkidney disease was defined as MDRD eGFR <60 mL/\nCancer mortality follow-up\nSeveral of the most common cancers were selected for\nanalysis. Lung, colorectal and prostate were examined in\nthe current study based on cause of death codes from the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision\n(ICD-10). Cancer mortality was analyzed for all-cause\ncancer (ICD codes: C00-C95), lung cancer (ICD codes:\ntate cancer (ICD codes: C61). Cancers other than lung\ncancer, colorectal cancer, or prostate cancer (in men) were\ndefined as other types of cancer. Follow-up for each\nparticipant was calculated as the difference between the\nNHANES III examination date and the end of follow-up\nfirst). Those found alive were right-censored at the last\ndate known alive or at the end of the follow-up. For\ncancer-specific analysis, those who died from other\ncancers were also right-censored at the time of death.\nStatistical methods\nContinuous variables were reported as median (inter-\nquartile range) and categorical data in percentages. For\noutcome measurements, the Cox proportional hazard\nmodel with the Efron method was used to calculate the\nRR, also known as hazard ratio (HR). RRs were deter-\nmined for mortality risk associated with albuminuria\nfor all-cause and cause-specific cancer (lung, prostate, co-\nlorectal, and other types of cancer). Possible confounding\nfactors, such as age, race/ethnicity, smoking, BMI, hyper-\ntension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease were added\nto adjust the association of albuminuria with cancer\nAlbuminuria and Cancer Death\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nmortality. Except for age and BMI, all variables were fit\nas categorical terms, which were coded as indicator\n(dummy) variables. For instance, two indicator variables\nwere created to code for three race/ethnicity categories:\nnon-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Mexican\nAmericans. Statistical analyses were conducted using\nthe Taylor series linearization and were adjusted for\nsampling weights to obtain unbiased national estimates\nin all analyses. Two-tailed P < 0.05 values were accepted\nas statistically significant.\nResults\nThe baseline demographics of study subjects (2,996\nmen and 3,116 women) are presented in Table 1. Ex-\ncept smoking (both men and women) and BMI (men\nonly), all demographic and clinical variables were sta-\ntistically different between those with and those with-\nout albuminuria (P < 0.05) for both sexes. In general,\nalbuminuria tended to be more prevalent among the\nelderly and subjects with chronic kidney disease, hy-\npertension, or diabetes. Albuminuria was also associat-\ned with race/ethnicity such that albuminuria was more\ncommon in non-Hispanic blacks. Although statistically\ndifferent and suggestive of a marginal reduction in re-\nnal function, it is unclear whether the higher serum cre-\natinine and lower MDRD eGFR are biologically\nsignificant differences.\ndied of cancer (all-cause) in an average follow-up of\nresponds to age-adjusted mortality rates (year 2000 U.S.\nstandard population) of 3.2 for lung, 0.94 for colorectal,\n1.1 for prostate, and 3.7 for other cancers for men and\nfor women per 1,000 person-years, respectively (data not\nshown). As shown in both Kaplan-Meier survival curves\n(Figs. 1 and 2 for men and women, respectively) and uni-\nvariate Cox proportional hazard regression (Table 2),\nsubjects with albuminuria are at increased mortality risk\nfrom all all-cause cancer, prostate cancer (men only),\nand the collected cancers other than lung, prostate, and\ncolorectal cancers, as compared with those without albu-\nminuria for both sexes. For instance, the RR of all-cause\ncancer deaths were 83% higher among men with albuminuria\nthan those without it [RR, 1.83; 95% confidence interval\nTable 1.

In comparison, there is not\neven a suggestion of an association of albuminuria with\nlung and colorectal cancer mortality in women.\nSimilar results were obtained by applying the multi-\nvariate model which included adjustments for age,\nrace/ethnicity, smoking, BMI, and hypertension, dia-\nbetes, and chronic kidney disease status. However, the\nresulting RRs were generally reduced by approximately\n20% to 40%, and none of the associations reached statis-\ntical significance. For instance, the risk for all-cause\ncancer mortality associated with albuminuria decreased\ncant in men (Table 2). Indeed, age and smoking are two\nof the most important factors in cancer deaths. In this\ncohort, age was significantly associated with increased\ncancer mortality for all-cause and cause-specific cancers\nregardless of sex except lung cancer in women (P = 0.10;\ndata not shown). On the other hand, smoking is a sig-\nnificant risk factor for all-cause and lung cancer for both\nsexes, and other types of cancer deaths for men. Of\nnote, neither albuminuria nor smoking were related to\ncolorectal cancer death for men or women.

Of note, there is a positive association\nbetween log-transformed UACR and prostate cancer in\nconsistent positive associations between log-transformed\nUACR and cancer deaths observed in women, none of\nthe results are significant (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nThe results of the present study showed that albuminuria\nwas associatedwith increased risk of cancer deaths from all-\ncause, lung, and prostate cancers in men from the United\nStates ages 50 and older. The association was not significant\nfor any type of cancer in women of the same age group.\nOne prior report from the Troms\u00f8 Study showed that\nUACR at baseline was correlated with subsequent cancer\ndiabetes or previous cancer had the first diagnosis of\ncancer in 10.3 years of follow-up. Each SD-higher rise\nin the log-transformed UACR was associated with a RR\nthe highest quintile were 8.3- and 2.4-fold more likely to\nreceive a diagnosis of bladder and lung cancer, respec-\ntively (6). Our study again examined the relationship\nbetween UACR and a variety of cancer mortalities, with\nsimilar results.\nDespite the growing regard for albuminuria as a para-\nneoplastic and inflammatory phenomenon, the underly-\ning mechanisms for the association between albuminuria\nand cancer incidence/mortalities are largely unknown\n(21-24). Chronic inflammation triggers endothelial dys-\nfunction leading to albuminuria (25) and may provide a\ncommon link because inflammation is associated with\nboth increased cancer (26) and cardiovascular risk (4).\nThe renin-angiotensin system may participate in generat-\ning the increased cancer risk associated with albuminuria.\nAngiotensin II has been implicated in the development or\ninvasion of several kinds of cancer (27). Angiotensin could\nexert mitogenic activity through angiotensin II type I\n(ATII-I) receptors and ATII-I receptor expression is higher\nin cancerous prostate (28).\nThe current data analysis showed a positive associa-\ntion between albuminuria and all-cancer mortality in\nTable 2.

There was a dose-responsive relationship be-\ntween albuminuria and prostate cancer death in men.\nThe RR of prostate cancer deaths increased by 1.40-fold\nwhen the log-scale of albuminuria increased by 1. In\nstark contrast with male counterparts, there was no\nsignificant association between albuminuria with both\nall-cause and cause-specific cancer deaths in women.\nThe moderating influence of sex could be attributed to\nprostate cancer in men and the differential risks of lung\ncancer between men and women. Although the preva-\nlence of lung cancer in men has been decreasing, it has\nbeen increasing in women. The biology of lung cancer\ndiffers between the sexes, attributed in part to differences\nin growth factor receptors, endocrine influences, enzy-\nmatic clearance of toxins, the susceptibility to DNA dam-\nage, and the capacity for DNA repair, all of which may\ncontribute to the observed differences in treatment out-\ncomes (29). The finding in the current study of an associ-\nation between albuminuria and lung cancer mortalities in\nmen, but not in women, further shows a sex difference in\nthe development and prognosis of lung cancer.\nAlbuminuria is a marker of many underlying diseases,\nincluding cardiovascular disease. In the study group, the\nestimated prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular dis-\nease (positive response to the questions: \"Doctor ever\ntold you had a heart attack\" or \"Doctor told: congestive\nwomen). After further adjustment for cardiovascular dis-\nease, the associations between albuminuria and cancer\ndeaths were generally reduced 5% to 10% and there\nwas no positive association between pre-existing car-\ndiovascular disease with cancer mortalities. Similarly,\nalthough serum cholesterol has been found to be posi-\ntively associated with albuminuria (30), baseline choles-\nterol was not associated with cancer mortalities.\nOne of the major limitations of this study is that de-\nspite biological plausibility, the current evidence sup-\nports only an association, and not causation, between\nalbuminuria and cancer mortality. In addition, the use\nof single albumin measurements may not adequately\nassess normal within-person variations and may bias\nour findings toward the null (31). The small sample size\nfor many cancer case subpopulations limits the ability to\ndetermine whether the association between albuminuria\nand cancer is a general oncogenic effect or is attributed to\none or more specific cancers. Thus, it is also difficult to\ndevelop a predictive model based on albuminuria unless\nother markers (e.g., prostate-specific antigen and serum\ncalcium levels) are also incorporated (32).\nIn conclusion, the presence of albuminuria increases\nthe risk of cancer death, especially all-cause, lung, and\nprostate cancer in men over 50 years of age. The associ-\nation was independent of other conventional risk factors,\nsuch as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic\nkidney disease. The association was not apparent in\nwomen and the sex specificity of the observation clearly\nneeds to be resolved. Further study is also needed to ex-\nplore whether albuminuria contributes to prostate cancer\nor is merely a predictive marker of its subsequent inci-\ndence and/or progression. Understanding the underly-\ning biological mechanisms in this regard will determine\nthe prospect of using renal interventions in the manage-\nment of prostate cancer.\nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest\nThe authors indicated no potential conflicts of interest.\n"
