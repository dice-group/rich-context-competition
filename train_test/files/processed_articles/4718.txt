After their marriage, Fuller,\nher husband, baby, and her latest manuscript, written about\nthe revolution, were on their way back to the United States\nwhen their ship hit a sandbar and they all drowned (Capper,\n2007).

Analytical psychology\nemphasizes the psychological need for spirituality as opposed\nto a metaphysical conception of spirituality. This differs from\nSigmund Freud's psychoanalytic focus on sexual develop-\nment and Alfred Adler's individual psychology related to\npower issues. Jung's beliefs about the unconscious were dif-\nferent from other theorists. Besides the personal unconscious,\nproposed by Freud, Jung posited and described the collective\nbelieved that dreams, active imagination, and symbolic activ-\nity were the road to the unconscious. Mythology and alchemy\nwere also salient to his ideas about human development and\nthe unconscious (von Franz, 2000). Another major contribu-\ntion of Jung's was his explanation of the anima, the feminine\nside of man, and the animus, the masculine counterpart of a\nJung's life and works, we suggest the following sources:\nSimilarities Between Fuller and Jung\nThere are at least five similarities between Margaret Fuller\nand Carl Jung's beliefs and writings. These include their\n(a) nativist orientation, (b) beliefs in dreams and the uncon-\nscious, (c) references to literature, (d) emphasis on spirituality,\nand (e) ideas about gender. Each of these is presented here.\nNativism\nBoth Fuller and Jung were nativists. It is important to note that\nnativists are different from empiricists and constructivists.\nAccording to empiricists, knowledge comes from outside the\nindividual. The empiricist view is similar to the blank slate\nmodel of development in which individuals are born without\nknowledge. Knowledge is taught from the outside and moves\ninward (Skinner, 1974). Constructivists are neither empiri-\ncists nor nativists (Kamii, 2000). They believe humans have\nthe potential for constructing their own knowledge but knowl-\nedge is not inherently present in the individual (Kamii, 2000;\nPiaget, 1952). However, nativists believe that knowledge and\nindividual purpose are inborn (Hollis, 2005).\nBoth Fuller and Jung's writings emphasized a nativist\nview of development. Fuller's works were rich with refer-\nences to nativism, although many of them were subtle. For\nexample, Fuller (1845) said, \"The tree cannot come to flower\ntill its root be free from the cankering worm, and its whole\ngrowth open to air and light\" (p. 10). Less subtle was her\nstatement, \"You would not learn through facts of thought or\naction, but express through them the certainties of wisdom\"\n(p. 10). Finally she suggested, \"As soon as the soul can\naffirm clearly that a certain demonstration is wanted, it is at\nJung's (1973) manuscripts were also filled with references\nto nativism, although he did not use the term nativism. Jung\n(1966) said, \"The meaning and purpose of the process is the\nrealization, in all its aspects, of the personality originally hid-\nden away in the embryonic germ-plasm; the production and\nunfolding of the original, potential wholeness\" (p. 110). Late\nin his life Jung reported, \"Perhaps my unconscious is forming\na personality that is not me, but which is insisting on coming\ngested that his work was driven from inside him. \"I was com-\npelled from within, as it were, to formulate and express what\nEdward Edinger, a Jungian analyst, believed that the term\nessentialist described Jung's life and works as readily as the\nterm nativist. He said Jung was an essentialist and not an\nexistentialist. Existentialists think they construct themselves.\nAldridge et al. 3\nEssentialists believe they find themselves. They discover what\nis inherently present within themselves (Edinger, 1984).\nDreams\nBoth Fuller and Jung were profoundly influenced by the vivid\ndreams they experienced from childhood through adulthood\ndetail the effect of early dreams on Margaret Fuller. \"As a\nwoman of thirty, she still recalls the child's dreams with great\nvividness\" (p. 16). Certain themes were repeated in Margaret\nFuller's dreams. For example, \"When at last she went to sleep,\nit was to dream of horses trampling over her\" (Anthony, 1920,\np. 18). Another dream was about trees dripping with blood.\nThe blood developed into a lake or pond and continued to\nrise until it reached her head (Anthony, 1920). \"Often she\ndreamed of following to the grave the body of her mother, as\nshe had done that of her sister, and wake to find the pillow\nMargaret Fuller developed a personality from her dreams\nshe identified as \"Leila\" (Anthony, 1920). Fuller would turn\nto Leila in the night:\nAt night I look into the lake for Leila. If I gaze steadily\nand in the singleness of prayer, she rises and walks on\nits depths. Then know I each night a part of her life;\nI know where she passes the midnight hours. (Anthony,\nFuller's dreams became more real to her than what hap-\npened to her in the external world (Wade, 1940).\nEarly in life, Jung also had a dream or vision that changed\nhis life from that point forward. Jung recalled,\nI saw before me the cathedral, the blue sky. God sits on\nHis golden throne, high above the world--and from\nunder the throne an enormous turd falls upon the spar-\nkling new roof, shatters it, and breaks the wall of the\nAnalogous in some ways to Fuller's Leila, Jung devel-\noped what he called a No. 2 personality. Jung described the\ninterplay between his two personalities:\nThe play and counterplay between personalities No. 1\nand No. 2, which has run through my whole life, has\nnothing to do with a \"split\" or dissociation in the ordi-\nnary medical sense. On the contrary, it is played out in\nLiterary References\nNumerous parallels can be found in Margaret Fuller's and\nCarl Jung's literary references. They developed their ideolo-\ngies using a wide body of literature including mythology, The\nBible, and more specifically, Goethe's writings and Kant's\nworks.\nFuller and Jung lectured and wrote extensively on the sym-\nbolic in mythology. Fuller developed a set of seminars called\nConversations, \"which she gave annually\" (Brown, 1964,\np. 52). In her first seminar,\nMargaret chose Greek mythology for her subject, using\nthe forms of Grecian myth and fable to express sym-\nbolically the relations between the human constitu-\ntion and nature. Thus Jupiter stood for Will; Mercury\nfor Understanding; Bacchus \"the abandonment\" of\nGenius; Venus, instinctive womanhood; and Diana, chas-\nFuller also compared Greek and Egyptian mythology and\noften referred to mythological symbolism in her conversa-\ntions and writings (Chevigny, 1994). For Fuller,\nWhat was a seed, or a root, merely, in the Egyptian\nmind, became a flower in Greece,--Isis, and Osiris,\nfor instance, are reproduced in Ceres and Proserpine,\nwith some loss of generality, but with great gain of\nbeauty; Hermes, in Mercury, with only more grace of\nform, though with great loss of grandeur; but the loss\nof grandeur was also an advance in philosophy, in the\ninstance, the brain in the hand being the natural con-\nsequence of the application of Idea to practice,--the\nJung also placed a strong emphasis on the symbolic in\nmythology. Jung and Kerenyi (1963) believed \"that mythol-\nogy is held to explain itself and everything else in the universe\nnot because it was invented for the purpose of explanation but\nbecause it possesses among other things the property of being\nexplanatory\" (pp. 4-5). Mythology is often the primary source\nof explanation when science cannot provide an answer to our\nmost salient questions. \"Mythology is not simply a mode of\nexpression in whose stead another simpler and more readily\nunderstandable form might have been chosen, only not just\nthen, when it happened to be the only possible and appropri-\nate one\" (Jung & Kerenyi, 1963, p. 3). From mythology, Jung\nexplored the archetypes of the collective unconscious and\ndescribed the universal nature of mythology. The divinities of\nmythology \"can best be understood as eternal forms, the great\nReferences to Biblical personalities, particularly as they\nrelated to gender or archetypes, were used extensively in the\ndisdain forAdam but with highest regard and reverence for the\nMadonna. She wrote,\nAdam accuses woman to his God, and records her dis-\ngrace to their posterity. He is not ashamed to write that\n4 SAGE Open\nhe could be drawn from heaven by one beneath him,\none made, he says, from but a small part of himself.\nBut she said of the Virgin Mary, \"No figure that has ever\narisen to greet our eyes has been received with more fervent\nreverence than that of the Madonna\" (p. 44).\nJung (1969b) also wrote a plethora of passages referring to\nBiblical stories and images, explaining them in psychological\nterms. He explored the paradox of the Garden of Eden where\nGod pointed out the tree of life, precipitating the fall of Adam\nand Eve (Jung, 1969b). Jung further explored Job's relation-\nship with God in the \"Answer to Job\" (Jung, 1969b). He also\ndiscussed the Virgin Mary and her independence from man.\nJung said,\nThus Mary, the virgin, is chosen as the pure vessel for\nthe coming birth of God. Her independence of the male\nis emphasized by her virginity as the sine qua non of\nthe process. She is a \"daughter of God\" who, as a later\ndogma will establish, is distinguished at the onset by\nthe privilege of an immaculate conception and is thus\nfree from the taint of original sin. (p. 398)\nGoethe and Kant were Fuller's primary literary guides\n(Brown, 1964). Fuller was so inspired by Goethe that she\ntranslated many of his German writings into English (Fuller,\n1839). \"As she proceeded with her researches on Goethe,\nshe discovered more and more areas of which she knew\nremained her chief literary guide\" (p. 35). Fuller took several\nideas from Goethe and made them part of her philosophy.\nSpecifically, \"Goethe and some of her early experiences\nencouraged her to believe in fate and to attempt to probe\ninto its mysteries\" (Brown, 1964, p. 67). She also believed,\nlike Goethe, that everyone has a daemon that must be\nacknowledged. The daemon works through one's character\nbut cannot be contacted or analyzed. Furthermore, Goethe's\nbelief in self-culture \"completely satisfied her\" (p. 131).\n\"With Goethe, she held that character must be built from\nJung also made numerous references to Goethe, particu-\nlarly to Faust (Jung, 1989). However, Jung's fascination\nwith Goethe and his writings extends further than just ideol-\nogy.According to a legend, Jung was a descendant of Goethe.\nJung explained, \"The story goes that Sophie Ziegler had an\nillegitimate child by Goethe, and that this child was my\ngrandfather, Carl Gustav Jung. This was considered virtually\nan established fact\" (Jung, 1989, p. 35). In his writings, Jung\ncontinually referred to Faust and how it affected his soul.\nJung said of Faust,\nIt poured into my soul like a miraculous balm. Here at\nlast, I thought, is someone who takes the devil seriously\nand even concludes a blood pact with him--with the\nadversary who has the power to frustrate God's plan to\nPerhaps the most profound statement Jung made about\nGoethe also related to Faust. Speaking of his No. 2 personality,\nJung wrote,\nFor Goethe too, therefore--and this was my great\nconsolation--No. 2 was a reality. Faust as I now real-\nized with something of a shock, meant more to me\nthan my beloved Gospel according to St. John. There\nwas something in Faust that worked directly on my\nfeelings . . . The insight was not only comforting to\nme, it also gave me an increased feeling of inner secu-\nrity and a sense of belonging to the human community.\nI was no longer isolated and a mere curiosity, a sport\nof cruel nature. My godfather and authority was the\nImmanuel Kant was also referenced extensively by\nboth Fuller and Jung. Fuller's ideal of Transcendentalism\nwas inspired by Kant's (1781) Critique of Pure Reason.\n\"Transcendentalists were individualists to the core, fanatics\nfor freedom, brought together at intervals by the intellectual and\nreflective temper of their minds and by a fondness for discus-\nsion and analysis\" (Wade, 1940, p. 57). Transcendentalists also\n\"believed in the power of intuition. They thought every man\nand even some women harbored a divine spark . . . They called\nthis divine spark `reason.' Sometimes this was an inner light;\nCarl Jung relied on Kant's (1788) Dreams of a Spirit Seer\nto answer some of his questions on spiritualistic phenomena.\nAnd, when Jung was deep in his medical studies, he still found\ntime to read Kant. Jung says, \"I was able to study Kant only on\nsome hard thinking\" (p. 70). Jung's fascination with Kant had\na lot to do with his interest in metaphysical experience. The\nreading of Kant was able to challenge Jung's thinking, par-\nticularly as Kant's thinking related to Schopenhauer's work.\nAfter reading Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781), Jung\nbelieved he had found a major flaw in the Schopenhauer's\nthinking. Jung reported,\nSchopenhauer had committed the deadly sin of hypos-\ntatizing a metaphysical assertion, and of endowing a\nmere noumenon . . . with special qualities. I got this\nfrom Kant's theory of knowledge, and it afforded me\nan even greater illumination, if that were possible.\nFuller and Jung's Emphasis on Spirituality\nSpiritual development and the quest for wholeness were\nintegral parts of the lives and works of both Fuller and Jung\nAldridge et al. 5\nboth of them through difficult times and doubt before each\ndeveloped their own specific notions about God and religion.\nFor Margaret Fuller, \"the ideal truths of Christian experience\nwere what was important, not the religious institutions. The\nreligious instinct was where she centered her religious life\"\nabout Fuller's spiritual search that,\nIt was a tumultuous search, but she felt closest to reli-\ngious fulfillment when she experienced a clear note of\nsecurity in her very soul. No prop will do. The soul\nmust do its own immortal work, and books, friends,\nmeditations fly from us only to return, when we can do\nMargaret Fuller found her own way separate from a fixed,\norganized religion. Brown (1964) explained Fuller's position\non organized religion. Margaret Fuller said,\nI will not loathe sects, persuasions, systems, though\nI cannot abide in them one moment, for I see that by\nmost men they are still needed . . . I would learn from\nthem all . . . But let me set no limits from the past, to\nfrom \"Credo\" in Memoirs, II, 91)\nFinally, for Margaret Fuller, \"God was a constantly evolv-\ning `spirit uncontainable and uncontained'that kept all matter\nevolving in a search for perfect forms. She believed that the\nreligious experience was a constant search for a closer per-\nFuller's lectures and writings on spirituality were also\ninfluenced by her feminism. \"Fuller herself refused to defer to\nmale theologians . . . Moreover, Fuller influenced the message\nof many antebellum male religious leaders\" (Lott, 2001, p. 3).\nShe did not \"start a marginal religious movement. Instead, as\nher contributions to the New York Tribune between 1844 and\n1846 will demonstrate, Fuller worked to present her theol-\nogy or personal religion within the dominant culture without\nCarl Jung discussed spirituality from a psychological per-\nspective. He described the psychological need for the God\nimage. Jung (1969b) explained, \"To gain an understanding\nof religious matters, probably all that is left us today is the\npsychological approach\" (p. 89). The history of the religion\nof a culture is as telling of that culture as their government.\n\"Any religion which is rooted in the history of a people is as\nmuch an expression of their psychology as the form of politi-\ncal government, for instance, that the people have devel-\nFuller and Jung's Ideas About Gender\nBoth Fuller and Jung had much to say about feminine and\nmasculine qualities. Fuller wrote extensively about social\nfeminist issues, gender differences, and her theory of gender\nmultiplicity (Fuller, 1845). Beyond her social feminist writ-\nings, Fuller believed that a woman had two distinct qualities\n(von Mehren, 1994). She called these the muse and Minerva\nqualities of women. Muse is the Great Goddess and is also\ndefined as the receptacle of the Holy Spirit (de Vries, 1984).\nMinerva is the virgin goddess of wisdom and a favored\nchild of Zeus (Graves, 1996). The soul, to Fuller, was with-\nout gender. However, when gender was added, the muse\nquality emerged. \"When a soul is `modified' as woman, it\nflows, it breathes, it sings, rather than deposits soil or fin-\nweakening and painful effects of the overdevelopment of the\nmuse side of women, Fuller called for a greater emphasis on\nthe intellectual Minerva side to free women from becoming\nvictims of their overstimulated sensibilities\" (von Mehren,\nFuller also posited that there is no man that is totally mas-\nculine and no female that is totally feminine. Speaking of what\nwomen required, she suggested,\nWhat a woman needs is not as a woman to act or rule but\nas a nature to grow as an intellect to discern, as a soul to\nlive freely, and unimpeded to unfold such powers as\nwere given her when we left our common home. (von\nThus, Fuller believed that a woman should have a bal-\nance between the muse and Minerva sides of her nature\nAlthough Fuller discussed the nature of gender in the 19th\ncentury (Fuller, 1845), Jung explained the dilemma of gender\nexpression to one of the cultural tendencies of our time: the\nurge to live a completer life, a longing for meaning and fulfill-\nment, a growing disgust with senseless one-sidedness, with\nunconscious instinctuality and blind contingency\" (p. 130).\nJung equally discussed gender as it was affected by war.\n\"While man turns his hand to repairing the outer damage,\nwoman . . . sets about healing the inner wounds, and for this\nshe needs, as her most important instrument, a psychic rela-\nare far more `psychological' than men. A man is usually satis-\nfied with `logic'alone\" (p. 125).According to Jung, \"woman's\npsychology is founded on the principle of Eros, the great\nbinder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling\nLogos and Eros are posed as opposites and, since,\naccording to the law of Enantiodromia, over-dependence\non one principle constellates its opposite, the man\nrigidly defensive of a Logos position is besieged by\nthe corresponding psychic principle activated in his\nunconscious by images of anima. (Samuels, Shorter, &\n6 SAGE Open\nBoth Fuller and Jung spoke of Eros and Logos, although\nthey often used different terms to describe these qualities in\nboth male and female.\nAlthough there are similarities in Fuller and Jung's discus-\nsions of gender, Fuller appeared to have been more progres-\nsive in her beliefs and writings about gender. For example,\nJung said,\nIf one lives out the opposite sex in oneself, one is liv-\ning in one's own background, and one's real individu-\nality suffers. A man should live as a man and a woman\nas a woman. The contrasexual element in either sex, is\nalways dangerously close to the unconscious. (Jung,\nHowever, Jung's views on gender were enigmatic. Most\nof Jung's followers were women and Jung collaborated\nwith women and encouraged many to become analysts\nDifferences Between Fuller and Jung\nBoth Fuller and Jung were prolific writers. Fuller's publica-\ntions were fewer, probably because she died at age 40 and\nbecause she was a scholarly woman in a predominantly male\nworld. Jung lived to be 86 years old and his writings were\npublished in numerous volumes of his Collected Works\n(1973). There were obviously many differences in the con-\ntent and purpose in the publications of an American feminist\nTranscendentalist of the 19th century and a Swiss psychia-\ntrist and theorist of the 20th century. This section deals with\njust the major differences in the beliefs or ideologies between\nFuller and Jung. We believe the three most salient include\ndifferences in focus (social justice vs. psychological develop-\nment), where responsibility for problems originates, and how\nto deal with the daemon that resides in each human.\nSocial JusticeVersus Psychological\nDevelopment\nFuller and Jung included both sociological and psychological\nissues in their writings. However, Fuller wrote more about\nsocial justice pieces related to the context of women's lives\nin the 19th century. The plight of women's opportunities and\nsocial status were major themes in Fuller's Woman in the\nThose who think the physical circumstances of woman\nwould make a part in the affairs of national government\nunsuitable, are by no means those who think it impos-\nsible for the negressess to endure field work, even dur-\ning pregnancy, or the sempstresses to go through their\nkilling labors. (p. 24)\nShe worked and wrote for equality and justice for every\nwoman. \"We would have every arbitrary barrier thrown down.\nWe would have every path laid open to woman as freely as\nwere aimed at social justice--not only for women but also\nfor the people enslaved of her time and those without rights\nJung also wrote of social justice but believed that we make\nthe social world better through the psychological development\nof each individual--that is, through the process of individua-\ntion (Jung, 1964). von Franz, one of Jung's closest collabora-\ntors said, \"an unconditional devotion to one's own process of\nindividuation . . . brings about the best possible social adaption\"\non each person's individual work with his or her own psychol-\nogy and movement toward individuation. Jung compared the\nhuman race with an individual's development. He said,\nIf . . . we regard mankind as one individual, we see that\nthe human race is like a person carried away by uncon-\nscious powers; and the human race also likes to keep\ncertain problems tucked away in separate drawers. But\nthis is why we should give a great deal of consideration\nto what we are doing, for mankind is now threatened by\nself-created and deadly dangers that are growing beyond\nWhere Responsibility for Problems Originate\nArguably, Fuller (1845) was more likely to make men respon-\nsible for problems in women's development and Jung (1954)\nappeared quicker to place blame on the mother for her\nchildren's problems. Fuller argued,\nIt may be said that man does not have his fair play\neither; his energies are repressed and distorted by the\ninterposition of artificial obstacles. Ay, but he himself\nhas put them there; they have grown out of his own\nimperfections. If there is a misfortune in woman's lot,\nit is in obstacles being interposed by men, which do not\nmark her state; and if they express her past ignorance\ndo not her present needs. (p. 37)\nWhenever a young child exhibits the symptoms of a\nneurosis one should not waste too much time examin-\ning his unconscious. One should begin one's investi-\ngations elsewhere, starting with the mother; for almost\ninvariably the parents are either the direct cause of the\nchild's neurosis or at least the most important element\nAnalysis of the Daemon\nBoth Fuller and Jung believed, like Goethe, that everyone\ndaemon and what to do with it was discrepant in the writings\nAldridge et al. 7\nof Fuller and Jung. As previously mentioned, Fuller believed\nthat the daemon works through one's character but cannot be\ncontacted or analyzed (Fuller, 1845). A daemon is more con-\ntemporarily compared with a soul's companion, or angel, or\nfate (Hillman, 1996). However, Jung discovered ways to\napproach the daemon through dream analysis and active\nimagination (Jung, 1973). Jung also made references to\napproaching the daemon. Jung referred to Eros as a daemon\n(Jung, 1966). Still, Jung talked about how he would approach\nthe daemon. For example, Jung (1989) explained, referring\nto Eros as a daemon that \"I might, as many before me have\nattempted to do, venture an approach to this daemon, whose\nrange or activity extends from the endless spaces of the heav-\nens to the dark abysses of hell\" (p. 353). Plato too spoke about\neach human soul choosing a particular destiny, a mythical,\ncomplete, guarded essence of life formed within that is to be\nfound as if in an acorn, a personal daemon that dredges up\nAccording to Samuels et al. (1986), \"Jung was well\naware of the reality of evil in human life\" (p. 138). Jung also\ndescribed the shadow, which is the \"negative side of the per-\nsonality\" (p. 183) or that which a person does not wish to be.\nFuller, who died 25 years before Jung was born, did not\nrefer to the shadow. However, her reference to the daemon\nas a precursor to the term shadow will be discussed in the\nnext section.\nFuller's Ideas as a Precursor\nto Many of Jung's Basic Concepts\nMargaret Fuller accomplished much in the 40 years of her life,\ninspiring numerous scholars from the mid-19th century into\nthe 21st century (Knight, 2010). In this section, we explore six\nof Fuller's ideas that we believe were precursors to many of\nJung's basic tenets, including active imagination, typology,\nthe anima and animus, archetypes, the shadow, and the pro-\ncess of individuation. So far in this article we have begun with\nMargaret Fuller's beliefs and writings and compared them\nwith Carl Jung's. We now begin with Carl Jung's concepts and\ndefinitions and attempt to demonstrate how Fuller's similar\nideas predated Jung's. We chose to present the information in\nthis order because many of the concepts, terms, and defini-\ntions that Jung used were not available or defined during\nFuller's lifetime.\nActive Imagination\nJung first described active imagination in relation to dreams\n(Jung, 1935). Active imagination was defined as \"a process\nof dreaming with open eyes\" (Samuels et al., 1986, p. 9).\nActive imagination is not the same thing as daydreaming.\nDuring daydreaming the fantasies are part of an individual's\nconscious intent. However, in active imagination, uncon-\nscious contents are active in a waking state. \"Such fantasies\nask for the co-operation of conscious life\" (Samuels et al.,\n1986, p. 9). Barbara Hannah, who worked closely with Jung\nand von Franz, circumambulated Jung's active imagination\nand described how it can be used to confront the unconscious\n(Hannah, 1981). \"In every case, the goal is to get into touch\nwith the unconscious, and that entails giving it an opportunity\nto express itself in some way or other\" (Hannah, 1981, p. 17).\nSometimes a dream image will occur and active imagination\ncan be used in waking life to continue the dream work.\nIn our discussion of dreams, we described Fuller's encoun-\nter with a dream image she referred to as \"Leila.\" Fuller\nreported her dreams of Leila and (what Jung called) her active\nimagination with Leila that followed. Fuller said of Leila,\nIn the day she lives among men; she observes their\ndeeds, and gives them what they want of her, justice or\nlove . . . In the night she wanders forth from her huan\ninvestment, and travels amid these tribes, freer movers\nin the game of spirit and matter, to whom this man is a\nsupplement. I know not then whether she is what men\ncall dreaming, but her life is true, full, and more single\nFuller returned again and again to Leila because she\nexplained,\nI find her always to have retreated into the secret veins\nof earth. Then glows through her whole being the fire\nthat so baffles men, as she walks on the surface of the\nearth; the blood-red, heart's-blood-red of the universal\nheart, with no care except to circulate as the vital fluid;\nand it would seem waste then for her to rise to the sur-\nFuller's interactions with Leila indicated that Leila's voice\ncame from the unconscious. Her communication with Leila\nwas in the form of active imagination and not from the con-\nscious effort of daydreaming.\nTypology\nJung was inspired to consider typology from his interactions\nand observations of Freud and Adler. Jung (1989) reported,\n\"What with the sexual interpretation on the one hand and the\npower drive of dogma on the other I was led, over the years,\nto a consideration of the problem of typology\" (p. 155). He\nlater explained,\nI was busy with preparatory work for Psychological\nTypes . . . This work sprang originally from my need\nto define the ways in which my outlook differed from\nFreud's and Adler's. In attempting to answer this ques-\ntion, I came across the problem of types. (Jung, 1989,\nJung continued by describing the basic attitudes of intro-\nversion and extraversion, which are the functions of con-\nsciousness. There are feeling and thinking which influence\n8 SAGE Open\nhow people make decisions. Simply put, some people make\ndecisions primarily from the head whereas others are more\nlikely to make decisions from the heart. There are also sens-\ning and intuition, which involve how people take in infor-\nmation. Some people process the world through their senses\nwhereas others take in information from \"inside their heads\"\nAlthough Jung's exploration of typology was inspired by\nthe differences he noticed among himself, Freud, and Adler,\nFuller's discovery of typology began with her investigation\nof her own feminine nature and that of other women. In the\nprevious section titled \"Fuller and Jung's Ideas about Gender,\"\nwe presented Fuller's description of the muse and Minerva\nqualities of women. However, we did not explain that these\nqualities also refer to typology. The muse quality is analogous\nto Jung's conception of the feeling function, whereas Minerva\nis a metaphor for the thinking function. In other words,\nFuller discovered the feeling and thinking functions before\nAnima/Animus\nSamuels et al. (1986) described the anima as \"the inner figure\nof woman held by a man\" and the animus as \"the figure of\nman at work in a woman's psyche\" (p. 23). Men may easily\nrecognize the anima in literature or in film but not in them-\nselves. Also, women may want to be equal with men but\nremain true to their femininity precipitating conflict with the\nanimus within. \"Possession by either anima or animus trans-\nforms the personality in such a way as to give prominence to\nthose traits which are seen as psychologically characteristic\nA particularly good example of how the anima is expe-\nrienced as an inner figure in a man's psyche is found in\nthe medicine men and prophets (shamans) among the\nEskimo and other arctic tribes. Some of these even wear\nwomen's clothes or have breasts depicted on their gar-\nments, in order to manifest their inner feminine side--\nthe side that enables them to connect with the \"ghost\nland\" (i.e., what we call the unconscious. (p. 186)\nvon Franz continued to explain that\nJust as the character of a man's anima is shaped by\nhis mother, so the animus is basically influenced by\na woman's father. The father endows his daughter's\nanimus with the special coloring or unarguable, incon-\ntestably \"true\" convictions--convictions that never\ninclude the personality of the woman herself as she\nFuller's theory of gender multiplicity can be seen as a\nforerunner of Jung's discovery of the anima and animus.\nFuller, less specifically than Jung, described the feminine and\nmasculine as being present in every woman and man (von\nMehren, 1994). Fuller explained the conflict within herself\nregarding the feminine and masculine. She lamented,\nMy history presents much superficial, temporary trag-\nedy. The woman in me kneels and weeps in tender\nrapture; the man rushes forth, but only to be baffled.\nYet the time will come, when, from the union of this\ntragic king and queen, shall be born a radiant sovereign\nAlthough Fuller did not use the terms anima or animus,\nher writings were full of metaphors that referred to one or\nthe other. She referred to the anima when she said of the\npoet, \"we may yet conceive that it was the image of a queen\nbefore the poet's mind that called up this splendid court of\nwomen\" (Fuller, 1845, p. 54). She even analogously described\nthe negative anima in men and the negative animus in\nwomen when she exclaimed, \"to men, the woman seems\nan unlovely siren; to women, the man an effeminate boy\"\nArchetypes\nAccording to Jung (1969a), \"The term `archetype' occurs as\nearly as Philo Judaeus, with reference to the Imago Dei (God\nimage) in man\" (p. 4). An archetype \"is the inherited part of\nthe psyche; structuring patterns of psychological performance\nlinked to instinct; a hypothetical entity irrepresentable in itself\nand evident only through its manifestations\" (Samuels et al.,\n1986, p. 26). There are virtually hundreds of archetypes which\ninclude the witch, queen, king, jester, orphan, and sage. Primitive\ntribal lore, mythology, and fairy tales are all expressions of the\narchetypes (Jung, 1969a). The structures are the same but\nthe contents are individual.\nFuller did not use the term archetypes but her ideas and\nwritings were full of archetypal images. In fact, in Woman\nin the Nineteenth Century, Fuller (1845) included multiple\nappendices, which are rich with archetypal material, espe-\ncially literary references. Fuller also referred to the queen,\nking, and sage as represented in human behavior and relation-\nships (Fuller, 1845). And, in her writings on art and litera-\nture, she discussed archetypal images, but did not use the\nterm archetypes in her descriptions (Fuller, 1846).\nThe Shadow\nJung described the shadow as that which a person does not\nwant to be (Jung, 1969a). The shadow is \"the sum of all the\nunpleasant qualities one wants to hide, the inferior, the\nworthless and primitive side of man's nature\" (Samuels et al.,\nabout the shadow. Jung gave the example of the woman\nwho thought all of her friends were inferior and caused her\nproblems, not realizing it was her attitude that caused the\nproblems.\nAldridge et al. 9\nFuller's beliefs and writings about the daemon predated\nAlthough Fuller's description of the daemon was not identical\nto Jung's explanation of the shadow, they can be taken as anal-\nogous.As we have already conveyed, Fuller thought everyone\nhad a daemon but the daemon could not be contacted directly\nor analyzed (1845). According to Jung, the personal shadow\ncan be brought to consciousness but is exceptionally resistant.\nThe shadow is one of the most challenging entities for an ana-\nlyst or analysand.\nIndividuation\nAccording to Samuels et al. (1986), individuation \"is the key\nconcept in Jung's contribution to the theories of personality\ndevelopment\" (p. 76). Simply put, individuation is the pro-\ncess of a person becoming who she was created to be. It is a\nperson's quest for wholeness that is unique to each individual\nbut must always be experienced in relation to the world and\nto other people (Jung, 1969b). According to Jung, \"individu-\nation does not shut out from the world, but gathers the world\nto oneself\" (Samuels et al., 1986, p. 77). However, individu-\nation is not egocentric or selfish. It is true that a person may\nhave to leave the tribe to become individuated but through\nthe process the individual must bring something useful back\nto society.\nAgain, Fuller's beliefs and writings were about individu-\nation. True again, she did not use the term individuation but\nFuller believed every person should become all she could be.\nFuller's writings emphasized individuation in women and\npeople enslaved during the antebellum times in which she\nlived (Fuller, 1845). She also explicitly described the imped-\niments to individuation a woman faced based on culture,\nreligion, and society. She explained,\nThe severe nation which taught that the happiness of\nthe race was forfeited through the fault of a woman,\nand showed its thought of what sort of regard man\nowed her, by making him accuse her on the first\nquestion to his God; who gave her the patriarch as a\nhandmaid, and by the Mosaical law, bound her to\nallegiance like a serf; even they greeted, with solemn\nrapture, all great and holy women as heroines, proph-\netesses, judges in Israel; and if they made Eve listen to\nthe serpent, gave Mary as a bride to the Holy Spirit.\nMore salient than Fuller's beliefs and writings about what\nJung later referred to as individuation, was Fuller's personal\nexample of the individuation process (Anthony, 1920). Fuller\nremains one of the greatest exemplars of individuation in the\n19th century. She left the \"tribe\" but through her own strug-\ngles brought something back to society. In this article, we\nhave reviewed some of the contributions Margaret Fuller made\nto the world. Probably more important, though, was who she\nbecame. Her beliefs and writings have inspired feminists,\nsocial activists, intellectuals, educators, psychologists, and\nWas Jung Inspired by Fuller?\nWas Carl Jung influenced by the beliefs and writings of\nMargaret Fuller and, if so, how did this occur? There are five\npossible answers to this question. First, Jung could have\ndirectly copied or plagiarized Fuller's works. We found no\nevidence of this in our research. However, Jung's ideas were\nso closely aligned to many of Fuller's beliefs that we had to\nconsider this as a possibility. Jung and Fuller were both flu-\nent in German and English and it is possible that Jung read\nFuller's writings in either language. Both must have read\nPlato's work.\nA second possibility is unintentional plagiarism. We con-\nsider this possibility because Jung suggested this as a possi-\nbility that can occur when a person is writing (Jung, 1964).\nJung reported that a writer can actually plagiarize without an\nawareness of it. He said, \"it can sometimes be shown con-\nvincingly that what he has written bears a striking similarity\nto the work of another author--a work that he believes he has\nnever seen\" (p. 23). Jung explained in detail an example that\ninvolved Nietzsche. He said,\nI myself found a fascinating example of this in\nNietzsche's book Thus Spake Zarathustra, where the\nauthor reproduces almost word for word an incident\nreported in a ship's log for the year 1686. By sheer\nchance I had read this seaman's yarn in a book pub-\nlished about 1835 (half a century before Nietzsche\nwrote); and when I found the similar passage in Thus\nSpake Zarathustra, I was struck by its peculiar style,\nwhich was different from Nietzsche's usual language.\nI was convinced that Nietzsche must also have seen\nthe old book, though he made no reference to it. (Jung,\nWe do not know whether Jung actually read Fuller's texts\nbut do propose the possibility that he at one time came across\nher works and may have remembered some of her ideas.\nA third possibility is that Fuller and Jung were both influ-\nenced by archetypal ideas. Archetypes appear in all literature\nand both of them were inspired by forces greater than their\nown personal experiences. Ideas that were similar between\nFuller and Jung could be attributed to universals that have\nappeared in literature throughout history.After all, Fuller and\nJung made connections between their ideas about dreams,\nspirituality and gender with mythology, The Bible, and con-\ntemporary thinkers and writers of their day.\nA fourth idea, related to the third, has to do with the 100th\nto Blair (1975), Japanese monkeys, Macaca Fuscata, were\nbeing studied. The monkeys enjoyed the taste of sweet pota-\ntoes that scientists left for them. A young female called Imo\nfound that washing them made them taste better. She taught\nthis behavior to her mom and other monkeys. Then, one day\nmonkeys everywhere began to wash sweet potatoes before\neating them. The theory of the 100th monkey is that when a\ncertain number of a species, let's say 100, are able to do\nsomething then it becomes a part of that species' behavior,\na critical consciousness. Related to Fuller and Jung, their\nideas and beliefs could have been influenced by the num-\nbers of individuals who were contemplating and thinking\nmany of the same things. In fact, Myers (1985) described\nthe 100th monkey story in relation to one of Jung's major\nconceptions--the collective unconscious.\nFinally, some may believe that there are few connections\nbetween Margaret Fuller's and Carl Jung's beliefs and writ-\nings. After all, many of their ideas are similar to other schol-\nars' beliefs and their writings have been compared with a\nplethora of other works. Still, we find the beliefs and works\nof Fuller and Jung to be remarkably similar even if their lives\nand times were considerably different.\nConclusions\nMany of Jung's analytical psychology tenets were similar\nto Fuller's beliefs and writings. Although both have been\ncompared with others, we found no published works that\ncompared Carl Jung with Margaret Fuller. We have com-\npared and contrasted the beliefs and written works of\nFuller and Jung. Similarities included dreams, literature,\nspirituality, and their interests in gender. Differences were\nfound in their writings as well. Fuller's texts appeared to be\nfocused on social justice, whereas Jung's sources addressed\nsocial issues but from a psychological perspective. When it\ncomes to who should take responsibility for problems that\narise, it is not surprising to note that Fuller believed the\nman was to blame whereas Jung tended to consider the\nwoman to be a source of the troubles. It is interesting to\nwonder about the anima and animus in practice in both of\ntheir writings. Although they both agreed that all humans\nhave a daemon, Fuller and Jung had different ideas on how\nto deal with it.\nManyofFuller'sbeliefspredatedJung'sideas.Specifically,\nFuller described active imagination, typology, aspects of\nthe anima and animus, the shadow, archetypes, and the\nindividuation process, although she did not use these terms.\nFinally, we have questioned whether Jung was familiar\nwith Fuller's writings and how much of his theories can\nbe attributed to her influence. Clearly, more investigation\nbetween the beliefs and writings of Margaret Fuller and\nCarl Jung needs to occur. We anticipate further amplifica-\ntion and debate on the beliefs and published works of Fuller\nand Jung.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAldridge, J.
