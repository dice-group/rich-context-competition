I leverage an original survey of state legislative candidates to determine\nwhether women devote more time to their campaigns. I find that women on the whole, and those who had previously\nbeen elected to a political office in particular, invested more of their personal time into the campaign than men. This\ndifference is driven by the fact that women are more likely to forgo employment during the election. These findings\nsuggest that women are more likely than men to arrange their personal obligations in such a fashion that they can run\nstronger campaigns.\n",

Women face stereotypes and double standards in\nmedia coverage of their candidacies, but there is little evi-\ndence that, in the aggregate, women perform worse than\nmen in terms of either fundraising or vote totals. One poten-\ntial reason for the apparent gender parity in these areas is\nthat women wait for races in which they stand a good chance\nof winning, and demonstrate higher average \"quality\" as\ncandidates, which allows them to outpace any gender-\nIn this article, I engage the related question of whether\nwomen devote more of their personal time to their cam-\npaigns than men and whether they set aside other obliga-\ntions to do so. I find that women do indeed devote more of\ntheir personal time to the campaign effort, largely because\nthey work less at non-campaign jobs during the election.\nGender and campaign effort\nBoth prospective candidates (Lawless and Fox, 2010) and\nthe public at large (Dowling and Miller, 2015) view women\ncandidates as disadvantaged relative to men, and women are\nless likely to see themselves as well-qualified to run for\noffice (Lawless and Fox, 2010). The widely held perception\nthat women fare worse as candidates fuels a wide gulf\nbetween the two genders in terms of political ambition,\nwhich in turn results in fewer women entering politics\nconventional wisdom about the electoral prospects of\nwomen candidates, once incumbency is accounted for the\nwomen who do enter races raise as much or more money\nthan men (Burrell, 2008), and non-incumbent women not\nonly perform on par with men in terms of vote percentage\nning races for state and local offices at rates similar to men\n(Lawless and Fox, 2010). It is certainly possible that men\nand women perform equally well because the latter do not\nface gender-related disadvantages as candidates. However,\nthere is a robust literature suggesting that women face dou-\nble standards in media coverage (Carroll and Dittmar, 2010;\n1996). Voters apply stereotypes as well, viewing women as\nbetter-suited to the policy arena of \"women's issues\" such as\nabortion or child care (see Burrell, 2008; Herrnson et al.,\nGoing all-in: gender and campaign\ncommitment\nMichael G Miller\n Keywords\nwomen and gender, elections, behavior, state politics\nBarnard College, Columbia University, USA\nCorresponding author:\nMichael G. Miller, Department of Political Science, Barnard College,\nEmail: mgmiller@barnard.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nStereotypes about women's policy competence do appear to\naffect how voters evaluate them (Dolan, 2010), and Koch\n(2002) found that voters' judgment of women candidates as\nmore liberal can make them appear to be farther from the\nvoter's ideal point than they actually are.\nThere is an emerging explanation for why, if women\ncandidates do face gender-related disadvantages, they still\nperform comparably to men in the aggregate. For instance,\ndespite the gender gap in ambition, women looking to move\nfrom the state legislature to Congress display more strate-\ngic behavior than men, entering races when political condi-\ntions are especially conducive to their candidacies (Fulton\net al., 2006). Women might be so calculating out of a belief\nthat they must be exceptionally well-prepared if they are to\novercome the perceived gender-based disadvantage. The\nresult is that among the candidates who actually begin a\ncampaign, women enjoy an advantage in average candidate\nquality, which leads to aggregate gender parity with men on\nobservable outcomes such as vote totals or money raised\novercome the negative effects of stereotypes by being bet-\nter candidates.\nOne heretofore unexamined aspect of \"being better\" is\nwhether women devote more of their personal time to legis-\nlative campaigns. I engage a simple question: Do women\ncandidates spend more time on their campaign than men?\nSince candidates' personal effort pays dividends for chal-\nlengers in terms of votes (Miller, 2016), it stands to reason\nthat the strongest candidates will be those willing to commit\nmore of their time to the campaign. This is particularly true\nin state legislative elections, which compared with the more\nprofessionalized, media-driven environment of a congres-\nsional campaign are more likely to require personal effort on\nthe part of the candidate, such as field canvassing or phon-\ning (Hogan, 1997). Candidates looking to wage a high-qual-\nity state legislative campaign should therefore be more\nlikely to wait for a time when they can fully commit to the\nrace. Thus, if women believe they must out-work their male\ncounterparts, they should be more likely to relinquish non-\ncampaign obligations such as outside employment, and\nshould invest more of their personal time in the campaign\nrelative to men. Given the observed strategic behavior of\n\"quality\" women candidates, this effect should be especially\nacute among women who have previously been elected to a\npublic office, such as school board or city council.\nData and method\nI employ original survey data from the major-party, lower-\nhouse candidate populations in 18 states during the 2008 gen-\neral election. Initial contact was made in early October, with\ncollection ceasing in early December. The included states are:\nAlaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii,\nIowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New\nMexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and\nWisconsin. These states are geographically diverse and range\nin ranking of Squire's (2007) index of legislative profession-\nalization from third (Wisconsin) to forty-third (Maine),\naccounting for a broad range of conditions in which state leg-\nislative campaigns are conducted. The survey was deployed\nin several waves via three media: mailed instruments, an elec-\ntronic interface, and telephone. Of 2,971 candidates in the\npopulation, the survey yielded 1,022 responses overall, for a\nresponse rate of 34.4%, which is consistent with previous sur-\nveys of candidate populations (Francia and Herrnson, 2003;\nHowell, 1982). I retain survey data from candidates who\nfaced major-party opposition and who responded to the rele-\nvant behavioral questions. There were 820 such candidates in\nthe sample, of which 273 were incumbent members of their\nrespective state houses. I supplement the survey data with\ninformation about each candidate's vote totals and fundrais-\ning performance, obtained from the appropriate regulatory\nagencies of each state. The survey instrument and sample\ninformation can be found in Miller (2014).\nRespondents were asked a series of questions about their\ndemographics, attitudes, and political experience, but two\nmeasures are particularly important to the present analysis.\nFirst, respondents entered the number of hours that they\npersonally devoted to a number of activities \"during the\nfirst week of October\". Specifically, candidates quantified\nthe number of hours they spent on fundraising, public\nspeeches, field activity, electronic campaigning, media\nrelations, research, strategy, phoning voters, sending mail-\nings, and the courting of interest groups.1 The bulk of my\nanalysis compiles these activities into additive indices of\neither \"total time\", reflecting the total number of weekly\nhours that candidates reported personally devoting to their\ncampaign, or separates time into fundraising, field activi-\nI also asked candidates to categorize their occupational\nstatus (outside of legislative responsibilities) during the\ncampaign as \"not working\", \"employed part-time\", or\n\"employed full-time\".2 Candidates are grouped into catego-\nries based on their answer to this question, via indicator\nvariables for whether the candidate was in a given work\ncategory. Similarly, candidates are placed into three \"expe-\nrience\" categories: Incumbents, candidates who have previ-\nously been elected to a political office, and those with no\nprior office-holding experience. In tandem, the measures of\nthe candidates' weekly hours and his/her responsibilities\noutside of the campaign yield insight into the extent to\nwhich the candidate was committed to the race on a daily\nbasis, and as political experience has been often-utilized as\na shortcut measure of candidate quality (Jacobson, 1989;\nVan Dunk, 1997), it seems prudent to account for experi-\nence in the analysis of campaign commitment.\nTo gauge whether women spent more time campaigning,\nI employ negative binomial models in which the (rounded)\nnumber of hours that a candidate reported devoting to the\ncampaign serve as the dependent variable.3 Likewise, I uti-\nlize logistic regression models of the binary outcome of\nwhether a candidate was in a particular work category. The\nindependent variable of interest in all models is an indicator\ncoded 1 if the candidate was a woman. I show at least two\nspecifications of each model: a binary regression of the\ndependent variable on the gender indicator, as well as a\nmultivariate specification with theoretically relevant con-\ntrols. All multivariate models also include state fixed\neffects. In the logistic regression models of whether a can-\ndidate was in a particular work category, I also include mul-\ntiplicative interaction terms to test for the possibility that\neither experience or incumbency moderates the relation-\nship between gender and propensity to work.\nThroughout, I employ the political experience catego-\nries as a control variable. Where relevant for a given model,\nI include as controls indicators for the candidate's political\nparty, self-identified race, and whether the election was for\nan open seat or occurred in a multi-member district. I also\ninclude observed characteristics of the legislative district,\nsuch as the percentage of the two-party general election\nvote that the candidate's party had received in the previous\n(2006) general election, as well as others obtained from\nLilley et al. (2007), such as urbanity, (logged) population,\nand (logged) household income.\nResults\nI first consider the amount of time that candidates reported\ndevoting to their campaign, by their level of experience.\nFigure 1 depicts the mean number of hours that candidates\nspent on fundraising, \"field\" activities such as canvassing\nor sign-posting, and all other campaign activities.4 Within\nevery experience category, women reported spending more\nweekly hours on their campaign than men. The difference\nis substantively small among inexperienced candidates,\nIncumbent women, however, devoted 47.2 hours to their\ncampaign: exactly 5 hours more than incumbent men. An\neven larger gap is evident among experienced challengers.\nNon-incumbent women with political experience spent\n47.9 hours on their campaign on average. This figure is\nhigher than any other candidate category, and is over 7\nhours more than experienced men devoted to their cam-\npaigns. Figure 1 is therefore consistent with the notion that\nwomen who entered a state legislative campaign did so\nstrategically, investing more time in the effort than men\nwith similar backgrounds.\nTable 1 contains negative binomial regression coeffi-\ncients for models which explore the relationship between\ngender and campaign time in greater detail.5 The dependent\nvariable in these models is the (rounded) number of weekly\nhours that the candidate reported spending on the cam-\npaign. Given the results depicted in Figure 1 above, Model\n5 unsurprisingly returns a positive, statistically significant\ncoefficient for the variable indicating the candidate is a\nwoman, suggesting that among experienced candidates,\nwomen devote more of their personal time to the campaign.\nThe same is true in Model 1, which employs data from all\ncandidates.\nHowever, both models capture only the bivariate rela-\ntionship between gender and effort. When the appropriate\ncontrols are included in the even-numbered models, the\ncoefficient for the female indicator becomes substantively\nsmaller, and in no case achieves statistical significance.\nThat said, the predicted number of hours spent on the cam-\npaign from the even-numbered models in Table 1 closely\nmirrors the pattern observed in Figure 1. When the other\nvariables are held at their mean levels for each gender,\ninexperienced women are predicted to spend about 48\nhours on the campaign: about 2 hours more than inexperi-\nenced men. The difference is much higher for experienced\nwomen, who outwork their male counterparts by a margin\nbent women is about 5.5 more than male incumbents.\nTaken together, the models in Table 1 suggest that\nwomen devote more time to their campaigns, possibly\nbecause they are less likely than their male peers to work\nduring the campaign. Such a relationship would be consist-\nent with the idea that women feel a greater need to eschew\nother obligations so they can focus on running a strong\nrace. Figure 2 depicts the percentage of candidates, by gen-\nder and experience, who worked either full-time or part-\ntime, or who did not work during the campaign, and\ndemonstrates that regardless of their experience level, men\nwere more likely to report working full-time than women.\nIndeed, a majority of non-incumbent men worked full-time\nduring the election, while a majority of women in all three\ncandidate groupings worked less than full-time. As with the\nanalysis of campaign time, the largest gap between men\nand women appears among candidates with political expe-\nrience: While more than 60% of experienced men worked\nFigure 1. Weekly hours devoted to campaign activities, by\nexperience and gender.\n4 Research and Politics \nfull-time, only 27% of women with political experience\ndid, and experienced women were almost twice as likely as\nexperienced men to not work at all during the race.\nIt is worth noting that Figure 2 is also consistent with the\nnotion that experienced women opt out of work by strategic\ncalculus. If women were more likely than men to not work\nby virtue of unobserved factors such as family structure or\nwealth, the rates of non-work should be comparable for\nwomen across experience categories. However, women\nwith political experience were almost twice as likely as\ninexperienced women to not work at all during the cam-\npaign. This stark difference implies that the propensity to\nfocus on the election is not driven solely by gender; rather,\nit is consistent with the premise that \"high-quality\" women\ncandidates choose to put other obligations aside during the\ncampaign.\nTable 2 contains logistic regression coefficients for\nmodels of two dependent variables: whether the candidate\nTable 1.

All four additive models are suggestive that\nwomen are significantly more likely to either not work or to\nwork less than full-time. Models 11 and 14 include interac-\ntion effects intended to test whether political experience\nmoderates the apparent relationship between gender and\nwork status. One of the two interaction terms is significant\nin each model, suggesting that political experience is indeed\na moderating force.\nTo aid in interpretation, I now turn to Figure 3, which\ndepicts the predicted probabilities of not working obtained\nfrom Model 11 (left pane), and the predicted probabilities\nof working less than full-time obtained from Model 14\n(right pane) for candidates of both genders and all three\nexperience levels. In addition to the point estimate of the\npredicted probability, Figure 3 also depicts 90% confidence\nintervals. The predicted probability of not working (left\npane) is higher for women than men at all three experience\nlevels. However, the difference is substantively meaning-\nless for inexperienced candidates, and the confidence inter-\nvals for incumbent women and men display substantial\noverlap. The space between women and men is larger,\nabout 18 points, for experienced candidates, indicating\nonce again that the probability that an experienced woman\nchooses not to work is significantly higher than it is for\nexperienced men.\nTable 2.

Again, women appear more probable than men to\nwork less than full-time at each experience level. Moreover,\nwhile the gap is substantively small for incumbents, it is\nlarge for both experienced and inexperienced challengers.\nIndeed, the predicted probability of working less than full-\ntime is roughly 21 and 35 points higher for inexperienced\nand experienced women, respectively, relative to men.\nTaken together, my analysis is therefore strongly sugges-\ntive that women with political experience devote more\neffort to their campaigns than men on a weekly basis\nbecause they are also more likely to forgo employment dur-\ning the election.\nDiscussion/conclusion\nPrevious research has argued that women overcome gen-\nder-related disadvantages by being better candidates. I\nengage a related but open question: Do women candidates\nexpend more effort on their campaign? I find that women\ncandidates devote more time to their campaign because\nthey are more likely to forgo working at a job during the\nelection. In tandem with existing work (namely, Fulton\n2012), these findings provide further evidence that women\nbelieve that in order to win, they must be better candidates\nthan men. My results suggest that this belief is especially\nstrong for women who have previously held elected office.\nWhile the survey data do not support definitive conclusions\nabout why experienced women are particularly likely to\ninvest more of their time in the campaign, my findings are\nconsistent with the notion of a more strategic \"quality\"\nwoman candidate who enters a race under favorable condi-\ntions and works hard to affect the desired result (see Fulton\net al., 2006). Eschewing full-time work may just be another\nsymptom of women being particularly good at \"picking\ntheir spot\". That said, further research should more fully\nexamine the strategic considerations of women entering\npolitical races, and experienced women in particular.\nMy analysis is not without limitations. One potential\nissue is the reliability and/or internal validity of self-reported\ncampaign time, which serves as a dependent variable for a\nportion of my analysis. Although retrospective self-report-\ning of work time has been demonstrated to be fairly accurate\n(Jacobs, 1998), it is possible that candidates might have\ninflated the number of hours they reported devoting to their\ncampaign, since doing so would make them appear to be\nmore \"hard-working\". Fortunately, such an inflation, assum-\ning that it occurred in a relatively uniform fashion, would\naffect only the intercept in a regression equation, and would\nbias neither the coefficients nor the standard errors in the\nmodels reported above. Moreover, the mean level of self-\nreported weekly campaign time was about 47 hours, which\nseems plausible in a contested state legislative election. As\nsuch, there is no obvious reason to doubt the results of my\nanalysis on the basis of self-reported time alone.\nIt is also possible that rather than eschewing work stra-\ntegically in order to campaign harder, women are simply\nless likely to have work obligations to begin with. The fact\nthat experienced women displayed such aberrant behavior\nrelative to women who lacked political experience, how-\never, is not consistent with this narrative. If time flexibility\ndrives the entry decision, then it seems reasonable to expect\nboth inexperienced and experienced women to exhibit\nhigher (relative to men) rates of sub-full-time employment.\nHowever, only women with political experience, who\nshould be most likely to make strategic decisions about the\ncampaign, display higher rates of non-employment than\nmen. So while it is possible that causation flows in the\nopposite direction, I believe it is unlikely given the data\npresented above. Future work could directly engage the\nstrategic considerations that women make before they enter\nthe race, perhaps by soliciting responses about income,\nwealth, or family structure.\nFigure 3.
