Although infants born with anen-\ncephaly die shortly after birth, infants born with spina bifida can\nlead full and productive lives, albeit often with serious dis-\nabilities. Research has shown that folic acid, a water-soluble B\nvitamin, can prevent 70% of folic acid\u00adpreventable NTDs\nwhen taken before and during early pregnancy (2\u00ad4). In 1992,\nthe US Public Health Service issued a recommendation that all\nwomen capable of becoming pregnant consume 400 lg folic\nacid/d to reduce the risk of having a child born with an NTD (5).\nThis recommendation was followed by a US Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) mandate to fortify enriched cereal grain\n(6). It was estimated that this level of fortification would provide\non average an additional '100 lg folic acid/d (7\u00ad9). Indeed,\ndietary data analysis from the National Health and Nutrition\nwomen of reproductive age reported receiving on average an\nthe Institute of Medicine published a review of data current at\nthat time on folic acid and recommended that all women capable\nof becoming pregnant should consume 400 lg folic acid/d from\nfortified foods and supplements, or both, in addition to con-\nsuming a diet high in folate-rich foods (11).\nAccording to surveillance systems with prenatal ascertain-\naffected each year by an NTD in the United States, with a total\nwith anencephaly (12). There were racial-ethnic disparities in\nthe rates of NTDs; Hispanic women had higher rates than other\nrace-ethnicities. Williams et al (13) noted that, before fortifica-\ntion, Hispanic women had a prevalence rate of 10.34 births af-\nbirths for non-Hispanic white women. These rates decreased\n1 From the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities,\nNational Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA (HCH, JM, ALF, MEC,\nCAB, CEP, and OD); the Division of Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurveys, Planning Branch, National Center for Health Statistics, Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, MD (C-YW); and the De-\npartment of Statistics, Iowa State University, Ames, IA (ALC).\n2 The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and\ndo not necessarily represent the official views of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\n3 Reprints not available.

In addition to the differences\nin rates of NTD prevalence, Yang et al (10) found differences in\nfolic acid consumption, with a lower proportion of Hispanic\nwomen consuming !400 lg folic acid from fortified foods and\nsupplements than non-Hispanic white women. This was con-\nsistent with other findings indicating that Hispanic women were\nthe least likely to report awareness of folic acid and consump-\ntion of supplements containing folic acid (14).\nBecause of the persistence of the racial-ethnic differences in\nNTD prevalence rates, even after fortification of enriched cereal\ngrains with folic acid, it was hypothesized that fortification of\na product that could specifically target Hispanic women might\nincrease their overall average intake of folic acid and thus reduce\ntheir risk of NTDs. Similarly, a targeted approach might not\nunduly increase the average daily folic acid intake of the general\npopulation, for those segments of the population for whom the\nintervention was not intended (ie, males).\nTo address this strategy, researchers investigated whether\ncorn masa flour, which does not have a standard of identity as\ndeveloped by the FDA, could be used as a vehicle for a targeted\nfolic acid\u00adfortification program. Corn masa flour is a key in-\ngredient in many traditional Latin American cuisines, including\ncorn tortillas, enchiladas, and tamales. Corn masa flour food\nitems are reported to be consumed in appreciable quantities in\nthe Latin American diet, particularly among Mexicans and\nCentral Americans (15). A model was developed to assess the\npotential effect of additional folic acid fortification of corn\nmasa flour on the folic acid intakes of Mexican Americans,\nspecifically Mexican American women, and that of the general\nUS population.\nmultistage probability design. The survey captured a nationally\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian US\npopulation. Respondents participated in a household interview\nand a physical examination. For this analysis, we did not include\nindividuals who were pregnant and those whose dietary interview\ndid not meet minimum required standards for data quality (16).\nAdditionally, analyses reported by race-ethnicity were restricted\nto non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican Amer-\nican respondents because of the small number of individuals of\nother racial and ethnic groups. All participants in NHANES\nprovided written informed consent.\nModeling of folic acid intake from corn masa flour\nModeling possible folic acid intake from fortified corn masa\nflour entailed 4 main steps: 1) identification of foods that con-\ntained corn masa flour, 2) determination of the proportion of\ncorn masa flour per food item, 3) determination of the amount of\nadditional folic acid derived from corn masa flour fortified at\ncreation of model variables with the additional folic acid intake\nfrom fortified corn masa flour.\nTo identify foods that could contain corn masa flour, 4\nresearchers independently reviewed '6940 foods listed in the\nHispanic. Each individual's list was compared for similarities and\ndifferences in identifying foods. Foods were excluded if they\ncontained words such as white flour or if the conventional\nproduct used was a white flour tortilla (eg, burritos). Foods were\nincluded in the initial list if there was a good possibility that they\ncontained corn masa flour. The resulting list of foods was then\nreviewed by an international manufacturer of corn masa flour to\nvalidate whether the foods identified did indeed contain corn\nmasa flour. Foods identified by researchers and validated by an\ninternational manufacturer of corn masa flour were included in\nthe analyses, which resulted in 87 foods from the food code list\n(Appendix A).\nTo determine the proportion of corn masa flour present in each\nfood, each food item was identified in the MyPyramid Equiv-\nalents Database for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)\neach food product were identified (eg, non-whole-wheat grains,\nvegetables, or fruit). Because this database did not specifically list\ncorn masa flour as an individual component of food products, the\nnon-whole-wheat grain component was used as a proxy. For most\nof the foods identified and analyzed, the entire grain component\nwas listed as nonwhole grains. For purposes of this analysis, corn\nmasa flour was considered a non-whole-grain based on its\nmanufacturing process, called nixtamalization--a process that\ninvolves steeping dried corn in hot water and exposing it to\ncalcium hydroxide or lime (17). This process hydrolyzes the\npericarp and removes it from the grain. The aqueous solution is\nthen drained, and the remaining nixtamal is washed several\ntimes, removing seed coats, tip caps, excess lime, and any other\nimpurities (17, 18). It was assumed that most identified food\nproducts would use corn masa flour as the major flour or grain\ningredient, thus making the non-whole-grain component a rea-\nsonable proxy.\nTo determine the total grams of flour in each food item, the\ntotal grain ounce equivalents, made up of both nonwhole grains\nand whole grains, were multiplied by 16 g. MyPyramid Equiv-\nalents Database documentation used 16 g as a standard amount of\nflour in 1 ounce equivalent for many of the foods in the grains\ngroup. Sixteen grams of flour is found in a slice of commercial\nwhite bread weighing 26 g. From this, the proportion of non-\nwhole-grain grams per food item, the proxy for the amount of\ncorn masa flour, was determined. A sample calculation follows:\nFood item A\nTotal grain ounce equivalents: 3.5\nNonwhole grain ounce equivalents: 2.0\nWhole grain ounce equivalents: 1.5\nfood item A\nBecause the proportion of nonwhole grain ounce equivalents\na ratio of the nonwhole grain ounce equivalents per gram of food\nfor each food item from the MyPyramid Equivalents Database\nfollows:\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nNonwhole grain ounce equivalents: 1.6\nProportion of nonwhole grain ounce equivalents per gram of\nProportion of nonwhole grain ounce equivalents from 2001\nnonwhole grain in food item B\nFolic acid fortification was simulated by adding an additional\n140 lg folic acid per 100 g corn masa flour. On the basis of the\npreceding example, food item A would have had an additional\n44.8 lg folic acid added from corn masa flour (32 g nonwhole\nan individual would have consumed with folic acid fortification\nof corn masa flour included the estimated or expected intake from\nfortified corn masa flour plus the actual reported folic acid intake\nfrom foods and supplements.\nFolic acid intake from foods\nEstimated intakes of folic acid in foods were obtained by using\nThe USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies\n(FNDDS) version 1.0 was used to calculate all nutrient intakes for\nmost current database for nutrient composition of foods, in-\ncluding folic acid found in fortified foods. A detailed description\nof the FNDDS is published elsewhere (http://www.ars.usda.gov/\nFolic acid intake from supplements\nthe participant was asked about his or her use of dietary sup-\nplements, including single vitamins, multivitamins, minerals,\nherbs, and other similar nutritional substances over the past\nmonth. The interviewer recorded the name of each product and\nmatched it to a list of known products. After the survey,\nNHANES staff obtained label information for each reported\nsupplement to determine the ingredients. A participant was\nclassified as a user of a dietary supplement containing folic acid\nif he or she reported taking such a supplement at least one time\nduring the past month. Folic acid intake was calculated for each\nsupplement on the basis of folic acid content, the number of\ndays a supplement was taken, and the quantity of the supple-\nment taken per day during the previous month. The average\ndaily folic acid intake for each supplement was calculated, and\nthe values were totaled across all supplements taken by each\nparticipant to yield the average daily amount of supplemental\nfolic acid consumed (10). This estimate was added to the\namount of folic acid consumed from foods for each day of\nintake for each individual.\nStatistical analysis\nAnalyses were conducted by using the modeled folic acid\nintake to determine the potential contribution fortified corn masa\nflour would have on folic acid intake. It has been reported that\nestimates of nutrient intake based on one day's worth of intake\ndo not account for possible within-person variation (18, 19).\nTherefore, PC-SIDE version 1.02 (Iowa State University, Ames,\nIA) was used to estimate usual nutrient intakes, which takes into\naccount both between- and within-person variation when a sub-\nsample of the population has !2d worth of intake as in\nindependent days of intake information. If we can assume that\nthe day-to-day variability in intakes did not change between\nwaves, then we can use the within-person variance estimate\nentire combined sample. Detailed descriptions of this method\nare given elsewhere (19, 20). We used PC-SIDE to calculate the\ndistributions (medians, percentiles, and proportions ,400 lg) of\nfolic acid intakes for women aged 15\u00ad44 y by race-ethnicity\n(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican Ameri-\nAmerican women who reported consuming corn masa flour. A\nsecond analysis was conducted to calculate the distributions\n(medians and percentiles) of folic acid intakes for the total US\npopulation by sex, race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, and Mexican American), and age (1\u00ad3, 4\u00ad8, 9\u00ad\ncalorie intake by race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, and Mexican American) were calculated by using PC-\nSIDE.

We log-transformed BLUPS to\nnormalize the distribution and calculated the difference in the\nlogs of BLUPS [log(modeled intake) \u00ad log(actual intake)] to\nestimate the predicted relative percentage changes in usual daily\nfolic acid intake due to corn masa flour fortification. This method\nwas used because direct comparisons of medians was difficult\nwithout a good estimate of the SE of the difference. Differences\nin proportions were tested by using 2-tailed t tests.\nWe used 4-y dietary weights for all analyses, as recommended\nby the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (16).

Individuals whose dietary interviews did not\nmeet the minimum required standards for data quality for day 1\nand day 2 (n \u00bc 2,206) and women who reported being pregnant\nat the time of the survey (n \u00bc 571) were not included in the\nanalyses. Most of those individuals excluded for poor data\nquality on their dietary interview were either infants or children\naged ,2 y whose reported consumption of breast milk limited\nthe ability to quantify the total caloric and nutrient intake (n \u00bc\n323). The remaining individuals did not complete the dietary\ninterview (n \u00bc 1,703) or did not have reliable dietary intake data\n(n \u00bc 180). Individuals who were excluded because of unreliable\ndietary intake data or who did not complete the dietary interview\nwere evenly split by sex and fairly evenly distributed by age\ngroups; however, more non-Hispanic whites were excluded.\nFinally, 2 individuals were excluded who had reported daily\nfolic acid intakes .93 mg. This resulted in a final sample size of\nHispanic white, 11.8% were non-Hispanic black, 8.7% were\nMexican American. 4.7% were other Hispanic, and 4.7%\nwere other races or ethnicities, including multiracial (weighted\npercentages). All ages of individuals were examined.\nIn addition, a separate analysis of women aged 15\u00ad44 y (n \u00bc\nwomen with dietary interviews who did not meet the minimum\nrequired standards for data quality and 587 pregnant women were\nnot included.

Almost no change in folic acid intake from actual to\nmodeled values was observed for non-Hispanic white and non-\nHispanic black women (Figure 1A and 1B); however, an in-\ncrease in the distribution of Mexican American women's usual\ndaily folic acid intake after corn masa flour fortification was\nobserved (Figure 1C).\nThe total usual daily folic acid intake for the US population by\nsex, race-ethnicity, and age from all fortified foods and sup-\nplements compared with the modeled intake with the addition of\nshown in Table 3.

Therefore, these individuals were\nexcluded in the analyses presented.\nDISCUSSION\nCorn masa flour fortification modeling predicted that the\noverall usual folic acid intake of Mexican Americans, specifi-\ncally, Mexican American women, was increased by this type of\nfortification effort. The results suggest that Mexican American\nwomen aged 15\u00ad44 y increased their usual daily folic acid intake\nby 19.9%, and fewer Mexican American women would be\nconsuming less than the daily recommended intake of 400 lg.\nFor Mexican American women who reported consuming corn\nmasa flour on either day 1 or day 2 of the survey, this relative\npercentage increase in usual daily folic acid intake could have\nbeen as high as 33.9%. The disparity between usual daily folic\nacid intakes among non-Hispanic white and Mexican American\nwomen also could have been reduced, despite the higher reported\nuse of supplements containing folic acid among non-Hispanic\nFIGURE 1.

Consuming 400 lg folic acid alone has been\nshown to reduce the risk of NTDs (4). A positive shift in the\ndistribution of folic acid intake by fortifying corn masa flour\ncould provide significant public health benefits, with a specific\nemphasis on the health of pregnancies among Mexican Ameri-\ncan women.\nFood fortification is a long-standing public health intervention\nthat affects a large number of people without requiring specific\nbehavior changes. US folic acid fortification of enriched cereal\ngrain products is credited with an increase in red blood cell folate\nconcentrations and a 26% decrease in the prevalence of NTDs\nwithin the United States (12, 21). Some research has also in-\ndicated that folic acid might play a role in reducing the risk of\nother diseases or conditions, such as other birth defects (22, 23),\nsome cancers, cardiovascular disease, and stroke (24\u00ad26);\nhowever, more research is needed to know for sure. Along with\nthese benefits, concerns have also been raised about the potential\nfor adverse effects of high levels of folic acid, such as the ex-\nacerbation of neurologic effects from exposure to very high\ndoses of folic acid (11), increased risks of certain cancers (27),\nand cognitive decline (28, 29). Given the possible wide range of\neffects that folic acid might have on different segments of the\npopulation, it is not surprising that additional folic acid fortifi-\ncation efforts to reduce NTDs should now address how other\nsubgroups of the population would be affected. Whether a corn\nmasa flour fortification program could effectively target the\nMexican American population, specifically Mexican American\nwomen, and the effect of corn masa flour fortification on other\nsegments of the US population are discussed below.\nFortification, as an intervention, has been found to be effective\nat reaching a wide range of individuals regardless of income,\neducational level, or region (30). Fortification efforts can also be\ntargeted to very specific populations by focusing on food\nproducts uniquely consumed by specific population subgroups\n(31). Our results suggest that Mexican Americans appeared to be\ntargeted more effectively by corn masa flour fortification than\ndid other race-ethnicities. Specifically, the median usual daily\nintake of folic acid by Mexican American women would be\nmuch closer to that of non-Hispanic white women. Nevertheless,\nwith corn masa flour fortification, the median usual daily intake\nfor Mexican American women would still be below the rec-\nommended 400 lg of folic acid. Mexican American women\ndence suggests that specific genotypes more common among\nMexican Americans might necessitate additional folic acid in-\n33.9% relative increase in the median usual daily intake of folic\nacid would shift the entire distribution and provide substantial\nprotection to Mexican American women merits further in-\nvestigation.\nThe entire US population saw a shift to the right in its median\nusual daily folic acid intake. This was seen more markedly among\nMexican Americans (16.8%) than among non-Hispanic whites\n(4.0%) and non-Hispanic blacks (3.6%) or within age groups\n(ranging from 0% to 5.5%) (Table 3). This suggests that corn\nmasa flour fortification could increase the median usual daily\nintake of folic acid among Mexican Americans and would not\nappear to substantially affect other segments of the population.\nMedian total usual folic acid intakes with (modeled) and without (actual) folic acid fortification of corn masa flour for the\nUS population by sex, race-ethnicity, and age: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001\u00ad20041\nRelative percentage\nActual usual\nintake\nModeled usual\nintake\nlg/d %\nSex\nRace-ethnicity4\nAge group\n1 Usual intakes have taken into account both within- and between-person variation.\n2 The relative percentage change is the antilog of the log of modeled individual usual intakes minus the log of the\nactual individual usual intakes.\n4 Race-ethnicity subanalyses were restricted to non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans.\n5 Significantly different from Mexican Americans, P , 0.001.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nThis study had several limitations. The USDA FNDDS does\nnot categorize foods by individual food commodities (eg, corn\nmasa flour, white flour, oil, cheese, and milk); therefore, we had\nto identify foods that could possibly contain corn masa flour.\nTo address possible imprecision, researchers independently re-\nviewed the complete list of food products and validated it with an\ninternational manufacturer of corn masa flour. The proportion of\ncorn masa flour in each food product was obtained by a USDA\ndata set (MyPyramid Equivalents Database), which reported the\nequivalents of different food groups (ie, grains groups and fruit\ngroups) within each food product. Corn masa flour was not\nspecifically identified in the database; however, it was assumed\nthat most of the grain used in each product would be corn masa\nflour. If there were other flours used in the food products, such as\nwhite or whole-wheat flour, the analyses would have over-\nestimated the proportion of corn masa flour in each product and\nthe potential intake of folic acid from the fortified corn masa flour.\nReported consumption of corn masa flour on either day 1 or\nday 2 of the survey was 56% among all Mexican Americans and\n28% among all women aged 15\u00ad44 y. Although these percentages\nsuggest a moderate consumption of corn masa flour in the United\nStates, other data suggest that corn masa flour consumption is and\ncontinues to be a large component of the diet among Hispanics in\nthe United States. A study that assessed the sources of nutrient\nintakes among low-income Hispanic women and children found\nthat 29.4% of women and 21% of children reported consuming\ncorn tortillas (which are made from corn masa flour) based on\na 24-h recall (37). This estimate was much lower than our es-\ntimate for Mexican American women consuming corn masa\nflour products (60%), most likely because our definition of corn\nmasa flour products included more than just corn tortillas. Data\nfrom the USDA's Economic Research Service indicated that US\nper capita consumption of corn flour and meal has increased by\n178%, compared with only 32% for wheat flour, during the\nthat corn masa flour is widely consumed among Mexicans and\nCentral Americans (15, 39, 40). Based on the increase in per\ncapita consumption of corn flour and meal in the United States\n(38) and the documented high level of consumption of corn\nmasa flour among Hispanics (15, 39, 40), the proportion of the\npopulation exposed to corn masa flour, especially among the\nHispanic population, will remain fairly high within the United\nStates.\ncurrent version of the FNDDS to analyze the nutrient content of\nfoods; however, 2 different versions were used for the analysis\nseparately to determine whether there were any significant dif-\nferences between data for these periods. Although the 2 versions\nof the FNDDS did not appear to affect the analysis, there was not\nan independent validation or comparison of the accuracy of the\nestimated intakes for folic acid. The analysis used the appropriate\nand most up-to-date version of the FNDDS; however, new\nproducts are always entering the market, making the food-\ncomposition database difficult to keep updated (41, 42). This\ncould have resulted in missing new products or coding new\nproducts as products that no longer existed, which could have\nmisrepresented the nutrient intake of the US population. Addi-\ntionally, analyses are based on the level of folic acid reported in\nFNDDS. It has been suggested that the actual amount of folic\nacid in foods could differ from what is allowed by the FDA and\nlead to an underestimation of folic acid intake (43\u00ad45). Dietary\nfolic intake data used in the analysis were collected by using\n24-h recalls, which are subject to systematic underreporting\n(46). However, the differential effect of this underreporting on\nspecific food components and on population subgroups is not\nwell understood. Nonetheless, these analyses showed no dif-\nferences in reported total usual energy intake by race-ethnicity,\nwhich suggests that if a bias were present, it was not limited to\none race-ethnic group. Additionally, daily folic acid supplement\nintake was calculated by using an indirect method that assumed\nthat use over 1 mo could be applied to two 24-h recalls. This\ncalculation might not represent daily amounts for persons who\ndo not take supplements consistently.\nin the number of women of childbearing age who report con-\nsuming 400 lg folic acid/d to 80% to reduce their risk of NTDs\n(47). On the basis of modeling, Mexican American women can\nincrease their folic acid intake by consuming fortified corn masa\nflour products. Nevertheless, the median usual daily folic acid\nintake for Mexican American women aged 15\u00ad44 y remains\nwell below the recommended 400 lg folic acid/d, even with\ncorn masa flour fortification. However, the addition of fortified\ncorn masa flour could cause a small upward shift in overall usual\nmedian consumption of folic acid for the entire US population\nand a larger upward shift among Mexican American women.\nThe shift in folic acid intake among Mexican American women\nwould reduce the disparity of folic acid intake between Mexican\nAmerican and non-Hispanic white women. Although it is diffi-\ncult to estimate the exact benefit that corn masa flour fortifica-\ntion could have on the prevalence of NTDs among Mexican\nAmerican women, the increased consumption of folic acid would\nshift some women to a level of protection not apparent without\ncorn masa flour fortification.\nWe thank Quanhe Yang (National Center on Birth Defects and Develop-\nmental Disabilities, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) for his help-\nful comments on the analyses and Jeanne I Rader (Center for Food Safety and\nApplied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration) for her helpful comments\non the manuscript.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--HCH: conceived of,\nplanned, and conducted the analyses and drafted the article; MEC: assisted\nin the analyses; and HCH, JM, ALF, MEC, CAB, CEP, C-YW, ALC, and OD:\ncritically discussed the results and provided input in the analyses, writing, and\nediting of the manuscript.
