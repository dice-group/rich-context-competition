The broadening of these deficits was\naccompanied by a substantial increase of foreign trade. The stock of foreign direct\ninvestment (FDI) also has been growing at double digits rates in most years since the start\nof the transition process. This study analyses the link between these developments and\nexamines the possible effect of FDI on the trade balance in the long run.\nIn an initial step, estimations are made with macro data in order to identify the overall\nimpact of foreign direct investment. On the aggregate level, clear effects of inward FDI on\nthe trade balance could not be identified. Both exports and imports are stimulated by direct\ninvestment. However, a great deal of information is lost by aggregating the data. The\nDeutsche Bundesbank's micro database direct investment (MIDI) makes it possible to link\ndata on FDI and trade separately for countries and sectors. Thus detailed information on\nthe specific sectoral relationship can be made available.\nBased on these data, an FDI enhanced gravity model indicates that there are important\ndirect and indirect effects of FDI on trade. For the manufacturing sector as a whole the\nresults point to a complementary relationship with both exports and imports. The net effect\non the trade balance is again unclear. Differencing according to the degree of technological\nintensity shows that in the high-tech industries the link between FDI and trade is\nparticularly close. Exports are highly stimulated by the domestic activity of foreign firms\nand the influence of FDI in other high-tech branches even exceeds the direct effect. From\nthis one can conclude that technological spill-over or the conglomeration of human capital\nare important mechanisms which link FDI to the trade balance. With regard to imports we\nrather observe a substitution of domestically produced for imported goods. FDI in sectors\nwith a low intensity of technology has no appreciable impact on trade.\nWith respect to the external economic relations with Germany those countries that attract a\nsignificant amount of FDI in sectors with advanced technologies indeed tend to realise\nsurpluses or moderate deficits in the bilateral trade balance. Economies with low inward\nFDI levels and a high proportion of low-tech industries, however, exhibit more pronounced\ndeficits. Against this background the prospects for an external economic consolidation in\nthe Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic are quite auspicious.\nThese countries reveal a relatively high share of FDI in the metal industry, machinery,\ninformation and communication technologies or the car industry.\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nDie acht L\u00e4nder Mittel- und Osteuropas, die im Mai 2004 der Europ\u00e4ischen Union\nbeigetreten sind, weisen hohe Handels- und Leistungsbilanzdefizite auf.

Auch die\nBest\u00e4nde an ausl\u00e4ndischen Direktinvestitionen (ADI) wiesen in den meisten Jahren seit\nBeginn des Transformationsprozesses zweistellige Wachstumsraten auf. Die vorliegende\nStudie untersucht den Zusammenhang zwischen diesen Entwicklungen und analysiert\nm\u00f6gliche langfristige Effekte ausl\u00e4ndischer Direktinvestitionen auf die Handelsbilanz.\nIn einem ersten Schritt werden Sch\u00e4tzungen mit Makrodaten durchgef\u00fchrt, um den\nEinfluss von Direktinvestitionen auf den Au\u00dfenhandel insgesamt zu erfassen.

Sowohl Exporte als auch\nImporte werden durch ausl\u00e4ndische Direktinvestitionen gef\u00f6rdert. Ein gro\u00dfer Teil der\nInformationen geht allerdings durch die Aggregation der Daten verloren. Die Mikro-\ndatenbank Direktinvestitionen (MIDI) der Deutschen Bundesbank macht es m\u00f6glich,\nDaten zu Direktinvestitionen und Au\u00dfenhandel gesondert nach L\u00e4ndern und Sektoren\nzusammenzuf\u00fchren und so detaillierte Informationen \u00fcber den spezifischen Zusammen-\nhang auf Sektorebene zu gewinnen.\nAuf Basis dieser Daten deuten die Ergebnisse eines um ADI erweiterten Gravitationsan-\nsatzes auf wesentliche direkte und indirekte Effekte von Direktinvestitionen auf den\nAu\u00dfenhandel hin. F\u00fcr das Verarbeitende Gewerbe insgesamt best\u00e4tigt sich eine\nkomplement\u00e4re Beziehung von ADI zu Exporten und Importen. Der Nettoeffekt auf die\nHandelbilanz ist auch hier nicht eindeutig.

Exporte werden\ndurch die Beteiligung ausl\u00e4ndischer Firmen erheblich gef\u00f6rdert, wobei der Einfluss von\nDirektinvestitionen in anderen high-tech Branchen sogar gr\u00f6\u00dfer ist als die direkten Effekte.\nDaraus l\u00e4sst sich schlie\u00dfen, dass technologische \u00dcbertragungseffekte oder die An-\nsammlung von Humankapital wichtige Mechanismen f\u00fcr das Zusammenspiel von Direkt-\ninvestitionen und Au\u00dfenhandel darstellen. Auf der Importseite ist hingegen eher eine\nSubstitution durch lokal produzierte G\u00fcter zu beobachten. Direktinvestitionen in Branchen\nmit geringer Technologieintensit\u00e4t haben keinen nennenswerten Einfluss auf den\nAu\u00dfenhandel.\nF\u00fcr die Wirtschaftsbeziehungen mit Deutschland zeigt sich in der Tat, dass jene L\u00e4nder,\ndie einen hohen Bestand deutscher Direktinvestitionen in high-tech Sektoren aufweisen,\nim bilateralen Warenverkehr tendenziell \u00dcbersch\u00fcsse oder moderate Defizite erzielen.\nDagegen haben L\u00e4nder mit einer schwach ausgepr\u00e4gten Pr\u00e4senz deutscher\nDirektinvestoren und einem hohen Anteil von Direktinvestitionen in Sektoren mit geringer\nTechnologieintensit\u00e4t st\u00e4rker ausgepr\u00e4gte Defizite zu verzeichnen.

The development of the current account is explicitly\nmentioned in Article 121 (1) EC as a criterion for sustainable convergence and has to be\nexamined in the convergence reports of the ECB and the European Commission.\nUnsustainable current account positions imply possible repercussions to the real exchange\nrate or other key economic variables and are therefore of special interest. In an earlier\nstudy we have identified the macroeconomic determinants of current account deficits. A\nmajor result was that the current account deficits are being influenced mainly by factors\nthat are connected with the stage of economic development, primarily buoyant\ninvestment.1 Even if this result is basically positive for the future current account\ndevelopments, essential risks remain and consist in possible set backs of the catching-up\nprocess and in the long-run effects of direct investment inflows.\nThis paper therefore focuses on the role which foreign direct investment plays for the\nexternal position of the eight new EU member states. Since the start of the transition\nprocess the central and east European EU countries have been attracting ever increasing\namounts of FDI. In most years the annual growth rates have been in double digits. At the\nsame time, trade with the EU has been intensified immensely. The purpose of this study is\nto ascertain whether there is a link between these developments and to examine the\nprospects of future trade balance developments that can be expected as a consequence of\nforeign direct investment in the long run.\nThe interplay between FDI and trade greatly depends on the motives behind the investment\nof multinational enterprises (MNEs). Corporate behaviour results in trade and investment\n*) We are indebted to J\u00f6rg Breitung for his advice in econometric questions. For helpful comments we also\nwant to thank Ulrich Grosch, Heinz Herrmann, the participants of the research meeting of the Deutsche\nBundesbank, the participants of the Bundesbank Workshop in Potsdam, the participants of the Wilton Park\nConference in Warsaw as well as the participants of an ECB Seminar on this issue. Of course, all remaining\nerrors are ours.\nflows that can be examined by means of gravity models.2 The main purpose of the analysis\nis to verify to what extent foreign direct investment is complementary or substitutive to\nexports and imports and whether it affects the trade balance positively or negatively. A\nnegative relationship between inward foreign direct investment and the trade balance is\nmainly to be expected if the subsidiaries primarily serve as marketing companies. By\ncontrast, positive effects are likely to predominate if foreign direct investment increases\nthe output of export goods and import substitutes. Outward direct investment by domestic\nenterprises may also have positive or negative effects on the trade balance.\nIn an initial step, panel estimations for the eight countries are made at the aggregate level\nin order to identify the total impact of foreign direct investment. However, a great deal of\ninformation is lost by aggregating the data. The Deutsche Bundesbank's micro database\ndirect investment (MIDI) makes it possible to link bilateral data on FDI and trade\nseparately for countries and sectors.3 Sectors are an appropriate level of aggregation, since\nthey form relatively homogenous groups of firms without being too sensitive to outliers.\nFurthermore, not only direct but also indirect effects can be taken into account. These arise\nwhen direct investment affects the competitiveness or growth of other sectors through\nexternalities, technological spill-over effects or changes in the relative factor endowment.\nSection II sets out the current account situations as well as developments in foreign direct\ninvestment and trade flows in the eight central and east European economies. Section III\nprovides an overview of the relevant literature. In section IV empirical analyses are\nundertaken both at the macroeconomic level and by means of sectoral data. Section V\nshows implications for the trade balances of the central and east European member states.\nSection VI summarises and draws conclusions concerning EMU enlargement.\nII The current account situations as well as developments of FDI and\ntrade in the EU member states of central and eastern Europe\nThis section provides a brief overview of the current account and trade balance situations\nin the eight central and east European EU member states and shortly describes the\ndevelopments in direct investment and foreign trade. Figure 1 shows that the current\naccount deficits in four EU member countries of Central and Eastern Europe exceeded 8%\n2 For the theoretical basis of gravity models see Anderson (1979) and Deardorff (1984).

In Estonia and Latvia they even amounted to around 12% of GDP. In\nmost countries deficits in the trade balances were higher than in the current account, since\ncurrent transfers, especially EU payments, more than compensated for the negative income\nbalance. Only in the Czech Republic and Hungary net income payments exceeded current\ntransfers and attributed substantially to the current account deficit.\nFigure 1. Current accounts and trade balances for the eight central and east\ntrade balance\ncurrent account\nSource: Eurostat, NewCronos; IMF, International Financial Statistics.\nIn the following we focus on trade effects of FDI, since this link clearly dominates the\nrelationship between FDI and the current account.4 Figure 2 shows the flows of imports\nand exports as well as the stock of inward FDI (FDI_IN) and outward FDI (FDI_OUT) for\nWhen seen in the aggregate, trade flows are much more important than the stock of foreign\ndirect investment. This is particularly true at the beginning of the period under review\nwhen exports and imports accounted for about four times the aggregated direct investment\nstocks.

While the annual growth rates of foreign direct investment are mostly in\n4 The presumable impact on future income payments is ignored in this study, since this would go beyond the\nscope of the paper.\ndouble digits,5 foreign trade rose continuously but to a lesser extent than FDI.\nConsequently, in 2003 direct investment stocks were already accounting for about 60% of\nexports and imports. High rates of growth can also be seen in the case of direct investment\nby the central and east European EU member states abroad even if the level is low. At the\ncurrent end it still accounts for less than 5% of exports and imports.\nFigure 2. Exports, Imports and FDI stocks of EU-8 (EUR billion)\nSources: UN, World Investment Report; IMF, International Financial Statistics.\nIII Review of the literature\nOver a lengthy period of time the theory of direct investment developed independently of\ninternational trade theory and ignored the influence of multinationals on the structures of\nforeign trade and the trade balance. However, these approaches could hardly explain\nempirical findings such as the growing importance of horizontal direct investment between\n5 The decrease in 2003 was solely due to changes in the valuation and resulted from depreciations of the\nnational currencies vis-\u00e0-vis the euro. At constant prices and exchange rates this year showed an increase,\ntoo. The sharp rise in foreign direct investment is in part due to liberalisation measures which have probably\neased the inflows of capital \u00ad as well as the outflows \u00ad during the period under review. Another reason is the\nimportant role played by privatisation and the associated M&A activities, especially in the initial phase of the\ntransformation process. Greenfield investment became more important later.\neconomies with comparable levels of income in times of dwindling trade barriers. The\nreorientation of trade theory at the beginning of the 1980s \u00ad to encompass product\ndiversification, increasing returns to scale and imperfect markets \u00ad made it finally possible\nto combine trade theory and theory of multinationals.\nDrawing on empirical findings, Markusen (1984) developed stylised facts about\nmultinationals and linked these consistently - under the heading \"Knowledge Capital\nModel\" - to the specific characteristics of firms and countries.6 He comes to the conclusion\nthat multinationals foster the international division of labour and that foreign direct\ninvestment \u00ad unlike portfolio investment \u00ad has to be seen as a complement to trade in\ngoods.7 While Markusen concentrated on horizontal direct investment, Helpman (1984)\nand Grossman/Helpman (1991) investigated the impact of vertical direct investment, which\ninvolves the fragmentation of the production process in dependence of varying factor\nendowments. Differing factor costs determine the choice of the most favourable place to\nlocate production. As in the models developed by Markusen, a complementary relationship\ncan also be expected here.\nThe simultaneous inclusion of vertical and horizontal direct investment is analytically\ncomplex and occurs for the first time in the studies undertaken by Markusen (2002) and\nMarkusen et al (1996). One of the results of these types of model is that, depending on\ncountry-specific characteristics, direct investment and trade can be mutually replaceable or\ncomplementary. For example, FDI lowers the volume of trade if trade barriers and the\nsimilarity of standards are substantial. By contrast, an increase in trade volumes can be\nexpected, if the obstacles to trade are low and the country characteristics are rather\ndifferent.\nThe question whether FDI is substitutive or complementary to trade can eventually only be\nanswered by empirical studies. However, the empirical literature on direct investment and\n6 1. Fragmentation/transportation: multinational enterprises make intensively use of human capital.\nKnowledge-based services can be provided at various locations at little cost. Human capital can therefore be\nconcentrated in areas away from the actual place of production. 2. Skilled labour intensity: in contrast to the\nproduction of finished products, the values arising from human capital depend on the availability of well\nqualified manpower. 3. Jointness: values created on the basis of specialised know-how serve as inputs in\nmultiple production processes and represent a kind of public good in the firm. In connection with this there\nare \"multi-plant economies of scale\", ie the input factor is used at various locations without its marginal\nproductivity being reduced as a result. By contrast, increasing returns to scale at the enterprise level would\nargue in favour of concentration and for a decision in favour of exports. See, in particular, Markusen (1995).\n7 This contradicts the results of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, which assumes substitutive relationship\nbetween trade in goods and trade in factors of production. Markusen (1984) makes it clear, however, that his\nresult is due to the specific assumptions made in the model. He supposes that the trade in factors of\nproduction is a prerequisite for achieving gains from trade and increasing the volumes of traded goods.\nforeign trade is just as complex as the theoretical models. For the new EU member states in\ncentral and eastern Europe Hoekman/Djankov (1997) come to the conclusion that - with\nthe exception of Poland - no significant correlation exists between direct investment and\nthe structure of the export markets. By contrast, Zemplinerova (1997) finds out that in the\nCzech Republic firms with foreign participation are more export oriented than domestic\nfirms. As Brenton/Di Mauro/L\u00fccke (1999) illustrate for various country groups in central\nand eastern Europe, however, more is also imported at the same time. According to\nHolland/Pomerantz (2003) the impact of direct investment on the trade balance of the new\nEU members (with the exception of Cyprus and Malta) is more or less neutral because\nimports and exports increase at the same rate. Lankes/Venables (1997) argue on the basis\nof surveys that the main goal of foreign direct investment in central and eastern Europe is\nto serve the domestic markets more adequately.\nFocusing on direct investment of German firms Marin/Lorentowicz/Raubold (2003)\nanalyse 1500 FDI projects in Eastern Europe and find a high share of intra firm exports to\nthe parent company in those sectors in which Eastern Europe is commonly seen to have a\ncomparative advantage and where the relocation of production makes particular sense.8 A\nrecent survey of Becker/J\u00e4ckle/M\u00fcndler (2005) based on FDI and employment data\nsupports the assumption that German FDI in Central and Eastern Europe is predominantly\nof a vertical nature. This is also confirmed by a survey undertaken by the German\nChamber of Industry and Commerce [DIHK] (2005) according to which German direct\ninvestment as a whole is primarily influenced by sales motives whereas in the central and\neast European EU member states efficiency seeking is the most often cited motive for FDI.\nThe paper at hand is different from the cited studies in that regressions on the aggregate\nlevel that are designed to capture the overall impact of FDI on trade are complemented by\nsectoral estimates that are able to identify direct and indirect effects in the bilateral\nrelationships between the home and the host country. One might expect that in sectors,\nwhere competitiveness is mainly determined by production costs, FDI usually entails the\nrelocation of specific production stages and primarily affects trade within the same sector.\nIn those branches, on the other hand, where the quality and the variety of products play an\nessential role, the motives for FDI may be more complex and intra-sectoral spill-over\neffects can also be important. Consequently - and in analogy to country-specific effects\ncited by Markusen et al (1996) - sector-specific effects can also entail complementary or\nsubstitutive relationships between FDI and trade which are diluted by aggregating the data\nn the macro level. The analysis of these linkages is possible by matching the micro\no\n8 According to the authors these are SITC 6 and 7 (manufacturing classified chiefly by material as well as\nmachinery and transport).\ndatabase direct investment (MIDI) of the Deutsche Bundesbank with the external trade\ndatabase of the German federal statistical office. In contrast to studies based on surveys we\ncan do this for the entirety of officially registered activities. Furthermore, we concentrate\non the relatively homogenous panel of the eight new EU member states in Central and\nEastern Europe. Doing so we enlarge our database in opposite to individual country studies\nwithout mixing countries with very different economic backgrounds. Admittedly however,\nthe trade-off between the number and the homogeneity of data cannot be totally solved.\nIV FDI and trade of the central and east European EU member states\n4.1. Estimations at the aggregate level\nThe empirical study on the impact of FDI on trade is based on a panel of the eight central\nand east European EU member states. The period under review is from 1994 to 2004. In\norder to eliminate valuation effects and to reduce the problem of simultaneity the estimates\nare done with constant values.9 In an initial step, the analyses are carried out at the\nmacroeconomic level. The regression equation to be estimated for the exports and for the\nimports is:\nt\n,\ni\nt\n,\ni\n-\nt\ni,\nt\n,\ni\nt\n,\nOECD\nt\n,\ni\ni\n,\nt\n,\ni\nOUT\n_\nFDI\nIN\n_\nFDI\nRER\nGDP\nGDP\n\n\n\n\n\n +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\nt\n,\ni\nt\n,\ni\n-\nt\ni,\nt\n,\ni\nt\n,\nOECD\nt\n,\ni\ni\n,\nt\n,\ni\nOUT\n_\nFDI\nIN\n_\nFDI\nRER\nGDP\nGDP\n\n\n\n\n\n +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\nwhere EXP and IMP are the central and east European economies' real exports and imports\nrespectively.

The gross value added in the OECD countries\n) serves as a proxy for the size of the external markets. The other variables are\nRER as the real effective exchange rate10, FDI_IN as the stock of inward FDI and\nFDI_OUT as the stock of outward FDI.11 All variables are logarithms. For 1\n9 FDI denominated in US-dollar is deflated with the US GDP deflator.

Other data are from the Eurostat NewCronos database and the\nIMF International Financial Statistics database. See the annex for further information. The estimations were\ncarried out using Eviews 5.1.\n10 The indirect quotation of the exchange rate is used, ie a rise in the variable means an appreciation.\n11 We use lagged FDI values that indicate the capital stock at the end of the previous year. This makes it\npossible to isolate long-term production effects of FDI on the trade balance from one-time transactions that\noccur in the context of the investment activity. From an economic point of view it might also be reasonable\nto increase the lag even further in order to account for the time span that lies between the initial investment\na plus sign is expected and for 3\na minus sign. The signs for 4\nare\nuncertain a priori and have to be established empirically.\nUnit root tests indicate that the individual time series are non stationary.12 We therefore\nrun a two-steps Engle-Granger procedure.13 Furthermore, existing empirical and\ntheoretical studies suggest that the explanatory variables are not strictly exogenous.14 To\ntake account of a possible endogeneity, a dynamic OLS (DOLS) procedure was chosen. A\nfixed effect estimator with fixed country as well as time effects was used both for the\nexport and import equation. The heteroscedasticity error structure was corrected by a\nrobust White estimator.15\nIn Table 1 the results for the export and import equations are shown. The GDP has a plus\nsign and is significant at the 1% level in both estimations. World output is captured by the\ntime fixed effects.16 Somewhat surprisingly, a real effective appreciation not only entails\nhigher imports, but is also positively correlated with exports. This might be due to the fact,\nthat the real exchange rate tends to appreciate during the catching-up process without\naffecting price competitiveness.17\nand the start of production. This argument, however, mainly holds for greenfield investment, but not\nnecessarily for mergers and acquisitions. The econometric results also give support to a one-year lag.\nMaddala/Wu (1999) were used, but do not obtain uniform results owing to the short observation period.\n13 See Engle/Granger (1987). The stationarity of the residuals of a fixed effects OLS regression was tested\nusing the panel cointegration tests of Pedroni (1995) and Kao (1997). According to the test of Pedroni both\nthe export and the import equation are clearly cointegrated. The test of Kao verifies cointegration only for\nthe export equation, but is not able to reject the null of no cointegration for the import equation. In a second\nstep, an error correction estimation was carried out. The error correction term is significantly negative. To\nthat extent, the time series move towards the long-term equilibrium. See Kremers et al (1992).\n14 For trade effects on direct investment see, for example, the empirical studies by Kreinin et al (2000) and\nPetri/Plummer (1996). In the present paper such relationships are eliminated through the use of lagged direct\ninvestment stocks. But the endogeneity problem cannot entirely be ruled out for GDP and the real exchange\nrate. For example, Frankel/Rose (2000) assume that foreign trade will have a significant effect on income.\nEndogeneity is also treated in detail by Maxwell et al (1995). He found no uniform results from his sample\nof 46 developing countries. However, he does identify variables which influence the direction of the existing\ncausality. He shows, for example, that a large amount of debt reduces the likelihood that the financial\naccount affects the current account. Conversely, a high growth rate and a high ratio of private-sector credit to\nGDP increases the likelihood that the current account determines the financial account. The more developed\nthe foreign exchange markets, the more likely it is that direct investment is exogenous.\ndifferences themselves were used as explanatory variables for GDP and RER. In view of the restricted\nnumber of observations, the insignificant fixed effects were excluded from the estimation.\n16 World output only changes in time, but not for the individual countries. Including it explicitly in the\nestimation together with fixed time effects would yield singular matrices.\n17 This phenomenon is closely linked to the so called Balassa-Samuelson effect. For a discussion of real\nappreciation in the new EU member states see for example Fischer (2002).\nTable 1.

Such spill-over\neffects can arise, for example, in the course of technology transfers and improve the\ncompetitiveness of the economy as a whole.19\nThe stocks of inward FDI also stimulate imports. This could be a sign that fairly large\nvolumes of the parent company's intermediate products flow into the subsidiary's output\nor that the foreign firms draw on established business relationships with foreign partner\nfirms for intermediate products. Another explanation could be that the aim of the direct\ninvestment of the parent company is to acquire better access to the markets of the host\ncountry.\n18 For the significance of direct investment as an export platform see also Ekholm et al (2003). According to\nHanson et al (2001), the importance of an economy as an export platform is promoted when trade restrictions\nare low and the domestic market is rather small.\n19 Markusen (1997) sees the main advantage of direct investment in the fact that a country is provided with\nthe necessary inputs to produce more efficiently. According to Ethier/Markusen (1996), direct investment\nmakes the transfer of know-how easier. This is essential for dynamic comparative advantages and for the\nlong-term improvement of competitiveness. Borenstein et al (1998) are among those who point out the\nempirical relationships between direct investment and growth. They show that direct investment increases\nthe marginal productivity of capital, fosters technical progress and thereby stimulates the growth of an\neconomy. Balasubramanyam et al (1999) also speak of direct investment as an engine of economic growth.\nHowever, Aitken/Harrison (1999) come to the conclusion that with respect to Venezuela the aggregate effect\nof foreign direct investment for the economy as a whole will probably tend to be low because, although the\nproductivity of the foreign enterprises increases, that of domestic firms is impaired. The 6th Structural Issue\nReport of the ECB (2005) highlights the stimulating effects of high-tech FDI for the catching-up process of\nIreland.\nThe direct investment stocks of the central and east European EU member states abroad\nhave a positive effect on exports, although their importance is much less pronounced than\nin the case of inward FDI. Imports, on the other hand, are not significantly influenced.\nAccording to the estimations carried out, no clear effects of inward FDI on the trade\nbalance can be identified. Both exports and imports are stimulated by direct investment.\nThis is in accordance with the results of Holland/Pomerantz (2003) for Poland, Hungary,\nthe Czech Republic and Slovenia, who cannot find a net effect of FDI on the trade balance,\neither.\nFontagn\u00e9/Paijot (2000) point out that the results at the aggregate level may represent a\npurely statistical phenomenon. Altzinger (1998) also deals with the loss of information\narising from macroeconomic estimations. To that extent, it seems appropriate to add\nestimations at the sectoral level where differing linkages between FDI and trade can be\ncaptured. This is especially important for the evaluation of future structural adjustments\nbetween sectors during the catching-up process. On the other hand, sectoral data are less\nsensitive to outliers than firm level data. Furthermore, direct and indirect effects can be\ntaken into account separately at the sectoral level. Besides, Lipsey/Weiss (1984) assume\nthat sectoral estimations reduce the simultaneity problem.20\n4.2. Estimations at the sectoral level\nEstimates on the sectoral level are only possible for the bilateral economic relationships\nbetween the eight countries under consideration and Germany. Sectoral data of overall FDI\nare either incomplete or not detailed enough to conduct an econometric study. Since\nGerman firms have played a pioneering role in establishing affiliates in central and eastern\nEurope, the economic relations of the eight EU member states with Germany might\nnevertheless give an idea of future external economic patterns with other partners, too.\nIn this section we focus on trade in manufactured goods for two reasons: First, the\nmanufacturing sector is the most important playing field for German firms in central and\neastern Europe. Second, trade in commodities and services both feature some\nparticularities which make it difficult to compare them with each other and with\n20 In addition to the endogeneity problem, there is also a simultaneity problem, ie a kind of spurious\nregression which arises from the fact that the two variables are influenced by other variables such as the state\nof development of the host country. See Tadesse/Ryan (2004), Frankel et al (1995) and Poon/Thompson\nmanufactured goods.21 Trade in commodities is usually determined by the availability of\nnatural resources. International transactions in services, on the other hand, often are\ndifficult to be interpreted in terms of exports or imports.22 In the following we differentiate\nbetween eight manufacturing industries.23\nFigure 3 shows foreign trade with Germany and inward FDI from Germany for the eight\ncentral and east European member states in the eight industries.24 By far the highest\ninvestment level can be identified in the production of vehicles and transport equipment as\nwell as in the chemical industry including the manufacturing of rubber synthetics and\nmineral products. In these sectors German firms were engaged with about 5 billion and 4\nbillion euro, respectively, in 2003. A considerable amount of FDI can also be observed in\nthe information and communication technology (ICT) sector amounting to just under 2\nbillion euro. In all the other sectors German FDI barely exceeded 1 billion euro during the\nobservation period. The development of FDI is quite steady in all the sectors which is in\nline with the observation of total FDI on the macroeconomic level (Figure 1).\nLooking at trade flows, production of vehicles and transport equipment together with ICT\ngoods is again the most important sector, closely followed by machinery. Interestingly, in\nall these sectors the initial trade balance deficits vis-\u00e0-vis Germany have diminished over\ntime. In ICT and the car industry the eight central and east European countries have even\nbecome net exporters. The growth of exports usually took off in the second half of the\nobservation period, whereas the dynamic of imports does not show uniform patterns in the\nindividual sectors. In the chemical industry, the trade deficit has continuously widened as a\nresult of muted export growth and a steady increase of imports. In other sectors, namely\ntextiles and clothing or manufactured wood and paper, the countries under consideration\nhave realised trade surpluses vis-\u00e0-vis Germany during the whole observation period.\n21 A specific study on the relationship between FDI and cross-border financial services on the base of the\nBundesbank's micro database direct investment (MIDI) has been conducted by Buch/Lipponer (2004).\n22 Reported income of insurances, eg, is equivalent to the balance of insurance contributions received and\npayments for insured losses. Consequently, the values in the statistics are much lower than the underlying\ntransactions and can even be negative. Furthermore, their volatility is widely determined by exogenous\nincidents and not by economic fundamentals.\n23 The match between the SITC systematic for foreign trade and the NACE, Rev. 1.1 classification of the\nEuropean Union, which is relevant for FDI data, is described in the annex. Trade data are from the German\nFederal Statistical Office, FDI data from the micro database of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Other data used in\nthe estimations stem from Eurostat. For further details see the annex.\n24 Outward FDI of the new member states in Germany is not included, since it is negligible.\nFigure 3.

In order to investigate the\nrelationship in more detail we run panel regressions for the time from 1994 to 2004 with\nthe eight manufacturing sectors listed above and the eight central and east European EU\nmember countries. We employ an FDI enhanced gravity model with industrial production\nat constant prices (IND) of the individual countries and Germany.25 Relative unit labour\ncosts in the manufacturing sector (ULC) are used as a measure of price competitiveness.26\nt\n,\nk\n,\ni\n-\nt\ni,\n-\nt\ni,\n-\nt\ni,\nt\n,\ni\nt\n,\nD\nt\n,\ni\nk\n,\ni\n,\nt\n,\nMF\n,\ni\nu\nIN\n_\nFDI\nIN\n_\nFDI\nIN\n_\nFDI\nULC\nIND\nIND\nEXP\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n,\nk\n,\ni\n-\nt\ni,\n-\nt\ni,\n-\nt\ni,\nt\n,\ni\nt\n,\nD\nt\n,\ni\nk\n,\ni\n,\nt\n,\nMF\n,\ni\nv\nIN\n_\nFDI\nIN\n_\nFDI\nIN\n_\nFDI\nULC\nIND\nIND\nIMP\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere MF indicates the manufacturing sector, PS the primary sector and SV stands for\nservices. Whereas 4\ncapture the direct effects of inward FDI (FDI_IN) on trade\nwithin the manufacturing sector, 5\nindicate the role of spill-over from FDI in\nother sectors.27 Unit root tests suggest again a non stationarity of the data. Likewise the\nestimations on the macro level we therefore run the two-step Engle-Granger procedure and\nuse the DOLS fixed effect estimator.28\nIn a first step we analyse separately the effects on trade in manufactured goods stemming\nfrom FDI in the manufacturing sector (FDI_MF), in the primary sector (FDI_PS) and in\nservices (FDI_SV). Whereas a close relationship within the manufacturing sector might\nindicate a fragmentation of production, spill-over effects from the primary sector can result\nfrom complementary trade of equipment. Finally, the impact of FDI in services possibly\nreflects more general consequences of a deeper economic integration.\n25 The distance to Germany is captured by the fixed effects. Explicitly incorporating it into the regressions\nyields singular matrices.\n26 Relative unit labour costs are defined as the ratio of nominal unit labour costs in country i to the\nrespective value in Germany. Since national unit labour costs are calculated in national currency, they are\ndeflated with the nominal exchange rate against the euro (DM until 1998).\n27 Outward FDI of the new member states in Germany is again ignored. The other variables are the same as\nin equations (1) and (2).\n28 Unit root tests for the individual variables are again of lower reliability because of the short time span.\nFor the DOLS estimates we use cross section weights in order to take account of heteroscedasticity and draw\non panel corrected standard errors to consider contemporaneous correlation. AR-terms correct for serial\ncorrelation.\nTable 2. DOLS estimates for manufactured exports and imports with spill-over from\nthe primary and the services sector\nIND\nULC\nFDI_MF(-1)\nFDI_PS(-1)\nFDI_SV(-1)\n*** (**) [*] means significance on the 1%- (5%-) [10%-] level; t-values in parentheses.\nTable 2 presents the results for the sectoral export (EXP_MF) and import (IMP_MF)\nequations.29 They are consistent with the outcomes on the aggregate level (Table 1).\nGenerally, there is a positive link between trade and industrial production at home or\nabroad, but only the impact of industrial production in a given acceded country on its\nimports is significant. Higher relative unit labour costs negatively affect exports and lead\nto higher imports. FDI in manufacturing stimulates both exports and imports of\nmanufactured goods. Cross-sectoral impacts from FDI in the primary sector are also\nsignificant. Direct investment in services, however, is found to influence only imports, but\nnot exports. This result might point to the role of marketing companies or the influence of\nGerman banks which make accessible foreign funds and hence facilitate imports. In their\ndescriptive survey of German FDI and employment in foreign affiliates\nBecker/J\u00e4ckle/M\u00fcndler (2005) also find evidence of growing importance of market\noriented FDI in central and eastern Europe.\n29 The residuals of fixed effects OLS estimations are stationary according to the tests of Pedroni (1995) and\nKao (1997). The error correction term in the error correction model is significant and also points to the\nexistence of a co-integration relationship.\nAll in all, the net effects of FDI on the trade balance are still unclear. FDI in the primary\nand the manufacturing sectors seems to stimulate trade as a whole. FDI in the services\nsector tends to passivate the trade balance.\nIn a next step we now want to analyse in more detail the link between trade and FDI within\nthe manufacturing sector which is the most important playing field of German FDI in\nCentral and Eastern Europe. We therefore differentiate between direct effects that occur\nwithin the same industry and cross-sectoral repercussions that reflect interdependencies\nbetween the individual branches. Since industrial production and unit labour costs are not\navailable on the sectoral level for the whole sample we furthermore use aggregated data for\nmanufacturing (without construction) and concentrate the sectoral analysis on the impact\nof FDI on trade:\nt\n,\nk\n,\ni\n-\nt\nk,\n-\nMF\ni,\n-\nt\nk,\ni,\nt\n,\ni\nt\n,\nD\nt\n,\ni\nk\n,\ni\n,\nt\n,\nk\n,\ni\nu\nIN\n_\nFDI\nIN\n_\nFDI\nULC\nIND\nIND\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n,\nk\n,\ni\n-\nt\nk,\n-\nMF\ni,\n-\nt\nk,\ni,\nt\n,\ni\nt\n,\nD\nt\n,\ni\nk\n,\ni\n,\nt\n,\nk\n,\ni\nv\nIN\n_\nFDI\nIN\n_\nFDI\nULC\nIND\nIND\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith k indicating the individual industry of the manufacturing sector.\nTable 3. DOLS estimates for manufactured exports and imports on the sectoral level\nIND\nULC\nFDI_MF(-1)\n*** (**) [*] means significance on the 1%- (5%-) [10%-] level; t-values in parentheses.\nTable 3 shows that FDI has sensible positive effects on exports in the same industry\n(FDI_SEC). This outcome might again reflect a fragmentation of production which is\nmotivated by cost reduction. However, positive spill-over from FDI in other manufacturing\nsectors (FDI_MF) seems to be even more important.30 The impact of FDI on imports is\nalso positive within and across industries. These cross-section effects point to the existence\nof substantial economic links between individual industries.\nIn a last step we therefore try to get some additional insight into the nature of spill-over\nwithin the manufacturing sector. In the literature technology transfers of foreign affiliates\nto domestic firms are often cited to be a driving force in the catching-up process of\nreforming countries. If this phenomenon also plays a role in the new EU member states it\nshould be possible to identify differences between individual industries in dependence of\ntheir technology intensity. In order to get an acceptable compromise between the number\nof observations and the homogeneity of the cross-sections we define a high-tech and a low-\ntech sector, each comprising four industries.\nTable 4. DOLS estimates for exports and imports in the high-tech industries\nIND\nULC\n*** (**) [*] means significance on the 1%- (5%-) [10%-] level; t-values in parentheses.\nAlbeit the classification of the chemical industry is not straightforward, in this study we\nadd it to the low-tech sector which also includes the production of food, beverages and\ntobacco, the textile and leather industry and the manufacturing of paper or wood. On the\n30 These findings are in line with the results of Blattner (2004) for South-East Asia, but are in contrast to the\nother hand, the metal industry, machinery, the information and communication technology\nand the production of vehicles and transport equipment are defined as high-tech\nmanufacturing.\nIn Table 4 the macro variables only have a significant effect on high-tech imports, but no\nimpact on exports can be verified. This is probably due to the limited correlation between\nthe aggregates and the underlying variables which represent the developments in the\nvarious branches. With regard to FDI, where idiosyncratic data for the individual industries\nare used, significant trade effects can be detected from FDI in the same industry\n(FDI_SEC) and from FDI in other high-tech industries (FDI_HIGH).31 FDI in the high-\ntech sector as a whole (FDI_SEC+FDI_HIGH) clearly has a positive impact on the trade\nbalance in high-tech goods. This net effect is primarily due to a positive spill-over on\nexports and negative cross-effects for imports. With regard to exports technology transfers\nmight play a role. A similar mechanism is the conglomeration of human capital induced by\npioneering firms. Conglomeration effects might also be responsible for import substitution\nin the high-tech sector, when intermediate goods which were previously imported are now\nproduced in the same country. FDI in the low-tech sector also stimulates exports, but has\nno significant effect on imports.\nThe close link between FDI and trade that could be established for the manufacturing\nsector as a whole and the high-tech industries in particular, cannot be affirmed for the low-\ntech sector (see Table 5). Only a positive direct effect of FDI on imports in the same\nindustry and a negative indirect impact of FDI in the high-tech sector on imports in the\nlow-tech sector is confirmed.\n31 Due to the reduced number of observations we use dummies for countries and for sectors instead of fixed\neffects for each cross section. As before we use cross sections weights and cross-section SUR panel\ncorrected standard errors to take into account heteroscedasticity as well as contemporaneous correlation. AR-\nterms correct for serial correlation.\nTable 5. DOLS estimates for exports and imports in the low-tech industries\nIND\nULC\n*** (**) [*] means significance on the 1%- (5%-) [10%-] level; t-values in parentheses.\nSummarising, the sectoral analysis indicates that there are important direct and indirect\neffects of FDI on trade. For the manufacturing sector the results point to a complementary\nrelationship with both exports and imports. The net effect on the trade balance is unclear.\nThe same is true for FDI in the primary sector which stimulates trade as a whole. FDI in\nservices, on the other hand, only has a significant impact on imports, whereas no effect on\nexports can be detected. The negative impact on the trade balance might be due to the\npresence of distributing companies. Differencing according to the degree of technological\nintensity shows that in the high-tech industries the link between FDI and trade is very\nclose. Exports are highly stimulated by the domestic activity of foreign firms and the\ninfluence of FDI in other high-tech branches exceeds the direct effect. From this one can\nconclude that technological spill-over or the conglomeration of human capital are\nimportant mechanisms which link FDI to the trade balance. With regard to imports we\nrather observe a substitution of domestically produced for imported goods in the high-tech\nsector. FDI in sectors with a low intensity of technology has no appreciable impact on\ntrade.\nV Implications for the trade balances of the central and east European\nEU member states\nThe empirical analysis has shown that FDI can play an important role for the sustainability\nand a future reversal of current trade balance deficits in the central and east European EU\nmember states. This is especially true for countries, who attract FDI in technologically\nadvanced sectors such as the metal industry, machinery, information and communication\ntechnologies or the automobile industry. Figures 4 and 5 show the link between inward\nmanufacturing FDI, high-tech FDI and the trade balance for the eight central and east\nEuropean countries vis-\u00e0-vis Germany and the world.\nFigure 4. Inward FDI and trade balances vis-\u00e0-vis Germany for the eight central\nand east European member states (% of GDP)\nSource: Eurostat, Deutsche Bundesbank.\nFor the external relations with Germany Figure 4 backs the econometric results that those\ncountries that attract a significant amount of FDI in sectors with advanced technologies\ntend to realise surpluses or only moderate deficits in the bilateral trade balance. Economies\nwith low inward FDI levels and a high proportion of low-tech industries, on the other\nhand, exhibit the highest deficits. Turning to Figure 5 it becomes evident that the overall\nshare of high-tech industries in manufacturing FDI is below the respective values of FDI\ncoming from Germany. This might explain, to some extent, why all the eight countries\nunder consideration run overall trade balance deficits.\nGiven the level and structure of FDI and based on the experience in the bilateral external\nrelationships of the individual countries with Germany one could argue the current trade\ndeficits of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic are\nless worrisome and will diminish over time, whereas the situation in the Baltic States is\nmuch less favourable.\nFigure 5. Inward FDI and trade balances worldwide for the eight central and east\nEuropean member states (% of GDP)\n* Sectoral FDI data for Hungary and Slovenia are not available.\nSource: Eurostat.\nVI Conclusion\nGiven the large trade and current account deficits in some of the new EU member states\nthe sustainability and the likely development of their external economic situation becomes\nan important criterion to assess their aptitude to enter the European Monetary Union. To a\ncertain extent trade and current account deficits are normal or even desirable for reforming\ncountries, since the catching-up process can be significantly enhanced by the inflow of\nforeign capital and technologies. In this context FDI plays a crucial role.\nEconomic literature describes a multitude of links between FDI and trade making it\ndifficult to predict the likely development of trade patterns with respect to FDI inflows.\nThe empirical analysis with aggregated and sectoral data indicates that in the eight central\nand east European EU member states FDI and trade are positively correlated. So far, our\noutcomes are in line with previous findings in the literature, even if results for overall FDI\nare less clear than studies that focus on German FDI.\nAdditionally, the sectoral analysis has shown that indirect effects are at least as important\nas direct effects. Especially in the high-tech sector technological spill-over and the\nconglomeration of human capital seem to be important factors for the export performance.\nThe important differences that are revealed between sectors and industries are of high\nrelevance for the assessment of the sustainability of existing trade deficits and for\neconomic policy.\nAgainst this background the data suggest that the prospects for the Czech Republic,\nHungary, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic look quite auspicious. These countries reveal a\nrelatively high share of FDI in the metal industry, machinery, information and\ncommunication technologies or the car industry. Hungary and the Slovak Republic already\nnow display surpluses in their trade with Germany. Since the economic integration of the\ncentral and east European EU countries with other EU member states often lag somewhat\nbehind their relationship with Germany one might expect a general relaxation of their\nforeign trade positions. The Baltic States, however, where the engagement of foreign\ninvestors in these branches is rather low, cannot expect a significant improvement of their\nforeign trade positions from this side.\nAnother aspect, which was not explicitly addressed in this paper, are possible third country\neffects of FDI which arise when a country becomes an export platform of foreign firms.\nThis \"Irish\" strategy would further strengthen the important role of FDI in the catching-up\nprocess and potentially help to overcome problems of excessive trade deficits. An\nempirical analysis of this phenomenon for central and eastern Europe requires a more\ndetailed and complete database than is available at time and remains a topic of future\nresearch.\nAnnex\nA1 Data sources\nVariable Source Unit/calculation Observations\nAggregated exports and\nimports of goods and\nservices\nEurostat Euro, converted into US-$ Czech Republic (2004),\nIMF, International Financial\nStatistics\nUS-$ All remaining observations\nSectoral exports to and\nimports from Germany\nGerman Federal Statistical\nOffice, external trade\nstatistics\nGDP IMF, International Financial\nStatistics\nConstant prices at levels of\nPoland, Czech Republic\nEurostat, NewCronos Constant prices at levels of\nAll remaining observations\nIndustrial production IMF, International Financial\nStatistics\nConstant prices at levels of\nPoland, Czech Republic\nEurostat, NewCronos Constant prices at levels of\nAll remaining observations\nAggregated FDI United Nations, World\nInvestment Report\nUS-$ All observations\nSectoral FDI from Germany Deutsche Bundesbank, MIDI DM (until 1998)/Euro All observations\nGDP deflators for US-$\ndenominated GDP and FDI\nIMF, International Financial\nStatistics\nIndex All observations\nGDP deflators for euro\ndenominated GDP and FDI\nEurostat, NewCronos Index All observations\nUnit values of exports and\nimports\nReplaced by GDP deflator Czech Republic, Latvia,\nEurostat, NewCronos Index All remaining observations\nUnit values of exports to and\nimports from Germany,\ndenominated in euro\nEurostat, NewCronos Index All observations\nNominal exchange rate IMF, International Financial\nStatistics\nExchange rates of national\ncurrencies vis-\u00e0-vis DM\nAll observations\nReal effective exchange rate\n(CPI, against 25 countries)\nEurostat, NewCronos Index All observations\nLabour costs, industry\nwithout construction\nEurostat, NewCronos Monthly labour costs per\nemployee; national currency\nAll observations\nEmployment, industry\nwithout construction\nEurostat, NewCronos millions All observations\nA2 Manufacturing Sectors and Classifications32\nSector NACE, Rev. 1 SITC-Rev. 3 Description\nfood products, beverages and tobacco\nwood, furniture, paper, paper products, other\nmanufacturing\nchemical products, rubber, plastics, fuel products,\nmineral products\nmachinery; radio, television and communication\nequipment; medical, precision and optical instruments\n32 A perfect match between the product classification for goods (SITC, Rev. 3) and the activity classification\nfor FDI (NACE, Rev. 1) is not possible.
