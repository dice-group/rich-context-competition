    "abstract": "Abstract\nFeng Shui, still popularly practiced today, was closely related to philosophy, natural science, geography, environmental\nscience, architecture, metaphysics, and astrology in ancient China. It is basically divided into the Form School and the\nCompass School. The latter deals with numerology, calculation, orientation, and time. Luo Shu [], associated with the\neight trigrams [], being an ancient Chinese magic square, forms the foundation of the Compass School. The original Luo\nShu, a 3 \u00d7 3 magic square, was not unique in ancient China but the extension of it to a total of 18 to 36 standard charts was\nunique, which are still used by all Compass School Feng Shui masters. In this article, modern linear algebra, developed only\nin the mid-19th century, is employed to prove that there is a strong coherence between the 36 charts if they are treated\nas 36 matrices and such correspondences conscientiously agree with ancient theories of Feng Shui. This article may help to\nform a scientific base for the systematic understanding, development, and further research of Luo Shu\u00adrelated applications.\n",

In the book, on page\n57, two drawings were depicted, namely, He Tu (the River\nDiagram) and Luo Shu (Luo River Writing). Accordingly,\nthese two names were mentioned in Lun Yu (Conversations\nand Discourses of Confucius) written in the fifth century\nBCE and then Yi Jing (Book of Changes). But there was no\ndetail about the two diagrams mentioned in Lun Yu, that is,\nthe exact arrangement of the dots on the diagram.\nAccording to Ho (2003), in the Mingtang chapter of Dai\nDe's Da Dai Liji (Record of Rites by the Elder Dai), a work\ndated approximately to the year 80 CE showed the arrange-\nment of numbers from \"1\" to \"9\" in three sets, that is, 2-9-4,\n7-5-3, and 6-1-8. These three sets of numbers, as can be seen\nin a later paragraph, resemble Luo Shu closely. Prof. Ho had\nbeen a 40-year research associate of Prof. Needham, Head of\nDepartment of Chinese of The University of Hong Kong\nthese numbers was not explained in the Da Dai Liji, probably\nassociated with the nine halls at which the Zhou emperors\nwas generally agreed that the two diagrams had dominated\nChinese thought since ancient times.\nThe first printed version of He Tu and Luo Shu appeared\nin the Song Dynasty, written by the famous Daoist Chen\nCE-1198 CE), disciple of the famous Confuciust, Zhu Xi\ncalled the \"Original Luo Shu\" throughout this article. Ho\nHe Tu does not qualify as a modern magic square and has been\nput aside by modern scholars studying Chinese magic squares .\n. . . However, to the traditional Chinese mathematician, the two\nfigures are of equal importance, both mystically and\nphilosophically.\n1World Institute for Scientific Exploration HK Branch, Hong Kong\n2Science Academy of Chinese Culture, Hong Kong\nCorresponding Author:\nAlbert Ting Pat So, Asian Institute of Built Environment, 3/F Oxford\nCommercial Building, 494-496, Nathan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong.\nEmail: alberttpso@gmail.com\nLuo Shu: Ancient Chinese Magic Square\non Linear Algebra\nAlbert Ting Pat So1,2, Eric Lee1, Kin Lun Li2,\nand Dickson Koon Sing Leung2\n Keywords\nLuo Shu, magic square, numerology, linear algebra, Feng Shui\n2 SAGE Open\nIn this article, the discussion is focused on Luo Shu.\nIn his book, on pages 5 and 6, Ho discussed the impor-\ntance of the three cosmic boards () to the Chinese his-\ntory and pointed out two out of these three boards were\nmainly concerned with the Luo Shu magic square. It is\nbecause these boards were believed to be secretly manipu-\nlated by the Astronomical Bureau to assist the emperors to\npredict astronomical events as well as human actions.\nThe three cosmic boards are Tai Yi ( or ), Dun\nJia (), and Liu Ren (). Tai Yi was the origin of the\nmost popular Flying Stars method used nowadays. On page\n25 of his book, Ho further discussed the principle of move-\nment within the nine palaces, known to the practitioners of\nthe art as feigong (flying palaces or flying stars in the modern\nterm). The movement could either be in a clockwise direc-\ntion (shunfei, that is, forward flying) or in an anticlockwise\ndirection (nifei, that is, backward flying). In this way, 18\nvariations of the Luo Shu are produced, as detailed by Smith\nThese 18 charts, including the original Luo Shu--the first\none shaded in Table 1--are called standard charts that are\npopularly used by contemporary Feng Shui masters of the\nCompass School. In some schools of Qi Men Dun Jia, 18\nmore charts are used, resulting in a total of 36 standard\ncharts. But as seen in a later section of this article, 27 out of\nthe 36 charts could be easily produced by the 9 standard \"for-\nward flying\" charts developed from the original Luo Shu.\nOne immediate observation of the original Luo Shu is that\nany three numbers along a row, a column, or a diagonal,\nwhen added together, give a sum of \"15.\" This fact was also\nwell known in the western world.\nThe discovery of the original Luo Shu was not unique in\nancient China. Magic squares were found in old Persia\naround the 10th century CE from the manuscript of Buzjani,\na mathematician (Hogendijk & Sabra, 2003). They were also\nknown to Islamic mathematicians in Arabia as early as the\n7th century CE. These squares are not only limited to an\norder of 3, while orders of 4, 5, and higher are also available.\nThe 3 \u00d7 3 magic square has been a part of rituals in India\nsince Vedic times and is still used today; the Ganesh yantra\nof ancient India is a 3 \u00d7 3 magic square. The 4 \u00d7 4 magic\nsquare was displayed in the Parshvanath Jain temple by 10th\ncentury CE. However, it seems that there was no special\napplication in terms of divination of such magic square out-\nside China in the ancient times. And furthermore, as dis-\ncussed in following sections, there are 35 additional\nvariations of Luo Shu, and all these 36 variations are useful\nin Feng Shui study, though 18 of them are more popular\nnowadays. Nothing on such variations was found elsewhere\nexcept in ancient China. Once the Luo Shu is varied, the\ncharacteristic of \"added together equals 15\" immediately\ndisappears. That may explain why variations did not draw\nattention outside China.\nRegarding the exact date of existence of Luo Shu, a recent\narchaeological discovery in the spring of 1977 confirmed\nthat it existed well before 80 CE as described in Da Dai Liji.\nArchaeologists discovered a tomb of the Western Han\nDynasty built around second century BCE at the City of\nFuyang in the province of Anhui, China. Inside the tomb,\nseveral of the oldest astronomical instruments were unearthed\nand Luo Shu was printed on one panel called \n (Divination Pan of the Supreme Unity moving around\nNine Palaces), shown in Figure 3. With the mentioning of\nLuo Shu in Yi Jing, we have confidence in believing that Luo\nShu existed long before 500 BCE. Then, two modern appli-\ncations of Luo Shu and the extended standard charts are to be\nbriefly discussed.\nApplications of Luo Shu and Its\nExtended Charts in the Compass\nSchool\nThe previous section was mainly on historical development\nfrom a cultural perspective. For Feng Shui study and applica-\n(1991). The practice of Feng Shui could roughly be catego-\nrized into two schools, namely, the Form School and the\nFigure 2. Luo Shu writing.\nFigure 1. He Tu diagram.\nSo et al. 3\nflow. Mountains and ridges are believed to be the source of\nQi, the name of energy or natural force in all schools of\nChinese studies, including medicine, martial arts, and meta-\nphysics. The Qi flows down from high mountains and is dis-\npersed by wind and stopped by water. So, a good site,\naccording to the Form School, should have tall mountains at\nthe back and flowing river in the front. By the two sides,\nthere should be low ridges, called azure dragon on the left\nand white tiger on the right. Air movement, but not strong, at\nthe site is necessary and the river should be concave to the\nsite with flowing water. In other words, a dead pond of water\nis not favorable. The Form School deals with the form only,\nand therefore, it has no temporal concern. The Compass\nSchool concerns both space, in terms of directions, and time.\nAfter a good site is selected, the Compass School directs\nFeng Shui masters to determine the orientation or facing\ndirection of the building as well as the best time to erect the\nbuilding. It therefore involves the extensive use of the com-\npass, as the name tells, which is professionally called \"Luo\nPan\" in Feng Shui study. The whole circle of 360 is divided\ninto 24 sectors, called mountains. Each mountain has a span\nof 15, as shown in Figure 4. Here, two applications of the\nCompass School are briefly introduced.\nFlying Stars method is the analysis of Qi and the subse-\nquent patterns generated in accordance with the geomagnetic\nTable 1. Eighteen Variations of Luo Shu.\nForward flying\nBackward flying\nFigure 3. Divination pan of the supreme unity moving around\nnine palaces. Figure 4. The compass--Luo Pan.\n4 SAGE Open\ndirectional patterns that affect the building structures in\nwhich we live and work. A detailed discussion on the Flying\nStars method could be found in Skinner (2003). Although Qi\nmay technically be more than merely a geomagnetic force, it\nis traditionally believed to be illustrated by geomagnetic and\nother physical forces, like air flow patterns and so forth.\nTo dwell in a house, it is essential to determine the best\nlocations for all doors and the allocation of main rooms to\nharness the beneficial distribution of Qi. The stars referred to\nhere are not real stars up in the sky; they are merely numbers\nof Luo Shu moving around the nine, 3 \u00d7 3, palaces. Fortune\ncycles, totally nine, of 20 years each are used to determine\nthe number placed at the central palace. The seventh Fortune\nCycle commenced on February 4, 1984 (The Year of Jia-Zi\n[] in the Sexagenary cycle) and ended on February 3,\n2004, to be precise. Now, we are within the eighth Fortune\nthe sequence of numbers in the original Luo Shu, the proper\nsequence of placement of stars, or the flying trajectory, is\naccording to a standard pattern, as shown in Figure 5. By\ncomparing the first chart of Table 1 and Figure 5, readers\ncould immediately notice the logic of this flying trajectory.\nFigure 6 shows the chart for the current eighth Fortune Cycle,\nwhich is created by putting the number or star \"8\" at the cen-\ntral palace, and other numbers are placed according to Figure\n5. This chart refers to the period of time under study, called\nthe Time Chart. The original Luo Shu's arrangement with\n\"5\" at the central palace is called Earth Chart. Figure 5 shows\nthe forward flying trajectory while a backward flying trajec-\ntory is also possible as shown in Table 1.\nThen, the facing direction of a house built within the\nperiod of time and the sitting direction (180 opposite to the\nfacing direction) of that house generate two more charts. The\noriginal Luo Shu was associated with directions, with \"9\"\npointing south, \"1\" pointing north, \"3\" pointing east, and \"7\"\npointing west. It has been an established convention that\n\"south\" is always put at the top of a chart and \"north\" at the\nbottom, which is analogue to the emperor sitting in his palace\nin northern China, say at Beijing, and looking south over his\nown nation. Based on the facing or sitting directions, two\nnumbers at the corresponding palaces will be put at the cen-\ntral palace and therefore two more charts are produced and\nmerged together, like the one shown in Figure 7 where there\nare three stars in each palace.\nFigure 7 shows the full Flying Stars chart (three charts\ncombined together) of a house built within the seventh\nfacing east. The star \"5\" at the eastern palace of the Time\nChart is brought to the upper right-handed corner of the cen-\ntral palace, thus forming the Facing Chart, and the star \"9\" at\nthe western palace (sitting direction) of the Time Chart is\nbrought to the upper left-handed corner of the central palace,\nthus forming the Sitting (also called Mountain) Chart. The\nlogic of placement (forward or backward) of other stars in\nthe Facing and Sitting Charts is beyond the scope of this\narticle. Based on these three charts, Feng Shui masters could\ntell whether the house in general is auspicious or not and\ncould even make comments on the use of every room corre-\nsponding to each of the nine palaces.\nIn the Flying Stars method, there are two types of charts\nthat are believed to be auspicious besides other concerns, as\nshown in Figures 8 and 9. In Figure 8, all stars in every palace\nbelong to one of three configurations, namely, \"1-4-7,\" \"2-5-\n8,\" or \"3-6-9,\" sequence being flexible. These three configu-\nrations are called \"The Three Big Trigrams .\"\nHowever, this is just one version, the most popular version,\nin fact, of the theory of \"The Three Big Trigrams.\" There are\nFigure 5. Placement of numbers (stars) in the nine-palace chart.\nFigure 6. Time chart of eighth Fortune Cycle.\nFigure 7. Final flying stars chart of a house facing east built\nwithin the seventh Fortune Cycle.\nFigure 8. Facing south-west built in eighth Fortune Cycle.\nSo et al. 5\nFigure 9, every star of the Time Chart when added to the\ncorresponding star of the Sitting Chart always gives \"10,\"\nsuch configuration being called \"Combined to Ten.\"\nThese two configurations are important in our further\nelaboration.\nThis article is not on the Flying Stars method. Readers are\njust reminded to pay attention to the 18 to 36 possible stan-\ndard charts merged together, the special \"Three Big\nTrigrams,\" and \"Combined to Ten.\"\nAnother application of Luo Shu is called Qi Men Dun Jia,\nwhich was widely used in the war fields by generals in the\nancient times to determine the best time and bearing to attack\nand retreat. In addition to the three charts in Flying Stars\nmethod, Qi Men Dun Jia uses four charts altogether, super-\nimposed on top of one another or merged together as in\nFlying Stars method, called Heaven (), Earth (),\nMan (), and Spirit (). All the 18 standard charts of\nFlying Stars method are used while two more types are\nsometimes added for every forward flying chart. That is, to\nrotate the chart either +90 or -90 with the central star\nunchanged as the pivot of rotation. Figure 10 shows the orig-\ninal chart with say \"4\" at the central palace, that is, the Time\nChart of the fourth Fortune Cycle; Figure 11 shows that\nrotated by +90; Figure 12 shows that rotated by -90. In this\ncase, 18 more charts are added, with a total of 36 standard\ncharts.\nAccording to the method of Qi Men Dun Jia, every year is\ndivided into 4,320 sets () under 18 categories, half belong-\ning to Yin and half belonging to Yang. But the variation in\nsets is slightly different year by year. Each set can be repre-\nsented by four charts, chosen from the 36 standard charts\nmentioned above, and Feng Shui masters refer to the charts\nto give comments and divine.\nReaders are once again recommended to pay attention\nonly to the configuration or structure of these standard charts\nas the discussion on them is the key issue of this article.\nThese 18 to 36 standard charts have been used by Feng Shui\nmasters for centuries. In this article, they are treated not as\ncharts or grids or palaces, not as magic squares anymore, but\nas matrices of modern linear algebra. Before we discuss the\nresults arisen from such treatment, let's have a quick review\non several characteristics of matrices, including determi-\nnants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, and their geometric\nmeanings on a three-dimensional coordinate system.\nA Review on Useful Techniques in\nLinear Algebra\nIntroduction to Determinants\nIn linear algebra, a determinant is a value associated with a\nsquare matrix, normally denoted by det(A) where A is the\nsquare matrix. It is an important parameter if the matrix is\nused to present the coefficients of a system of simultaneous\nlinear equations or if the matrix corresponds to a linear trans-\nformation of a vector space. A geometric interpretation can\nbe given to the determinant of a square matrix with real\nentries. The absolute value of the determinant gives the scale\nfactor by which area or volume (or a higher dimensional ana-\nlogue) is multiplied under the associated linear transforma-\ntion while its sign indicates whether the transformation\npreserves orientation. It is given by the following equation.\nA =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n( ) =\n= + + -\na b c\nd e f\ng h i\na b c\nd e f\ng h i\naei bfg cdh ce\n; det A\ng\ng bdi afh\n- - .\nIntroduction to Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues\nThe eigenvectors and eigenvalues were developed by Cauchy\n(a French mathematician) in his study in quadratic form in\n1826. He found that an eigenvalue problem had resulted\nfrom solving a quadratic problem. The eigenvectors and\neigenvalues have been widely adopted in engineering prob-\nlems. It has been adopted in the design of power system\n(Fereidouni, Vahidi, Mehr, & Tahmasbi, 2013), structural\nFigure 9. Facing south built in seventh Fortune Cycle.\nFigure 10. Original chart of fourth Fortune.\nFigure 11. Original chart of fourth Fortune rotated by +90.\nFigure 12. Original chart of fourth Fortune rotated by -90.\n6 SAGE Open\nengineering (Kong & Huang, 2013), medical imaging\n(Hyvonen, Nandakumaran, Varma, & Vasu, 2013), fluid\nmechanics (Pochyly, Malenovsky, & Pohanka, 2013), and so\nforth. The eigenvectors of a square matrix have the property\nthat multiplying the square matrix to its eigenvectors is\nequivalent to applying multiples to the eigenvectors. These\nmultiples are called eigenvalues.\nIt can be mathematically described by the equation\nAv v\n=  , where A is the square matrix, v is the eigenvector,\nand  is the eigenvalue, which is in fact the multiple to the\neigenvector. To obtain the eigenvector of A, the above equation\ncan be written as A I v 0\n-\n( ) =\n . If the eigenvector is nonzero,\nwe must have det .\n-\n( ) =\n 0 By solving this equation, the\nvalues of  representing the eigenvalues can then be obtained,\nfrom which the corresponding eigenvectors can also be com-\nputed by putting the values of  back into A I v 0\n-\n( ) =\n .\nReaders may refer to any standard textbook on linear algebra\nfor the detailed study of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\nGeometrical Interpretation of Eigenvectors and\nEigenvalues\nThe eigenvectors and eigenvalues have been widely used in\nprincipal component analysis (Jolliffe, 2002). We consider a\n3-by-3 matrix as the covariance matrix of a set of data scat-\ntering in the three-dimensional (3D) space. It should be noted\nthat the covariance matrix must be a symmetric matrix. This\napproach uses a 3D ellipse to fit the distribution of such data\nin the 3D space. The three principal axes of the ellipse are in\nfact the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The square\nroot of an eigenvalue represents the spread in the direction of\nthe corresponding eigenvector. The geometrical meanings of\nthe following three symmetric matrices are discussed.\n( ) ,( ) ,( )\na b c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\nq\nq \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\nMatrix (a) is a diagonal matrix of which all diagonal ele-\nments are identical. It means that the spreads of the data\nalong the axes of the Cartesian coordination system are the\nsame. Therefore, the geometry of the data spread estimated\nby the eigenvalue analysis is represented by a 3D sphere.\nMatrix (b) is also a diagonal matrix, but the elements on the\ndiagonal of the matrix are not the same. It means that the data\nspread along different axes of the Cartesian coordination sys-\ntem are different. Therefore, the geometry of the data spread\nis represented by a 3D ellipse, but the axes of the ellipse are\nparallel to the axes of the Cartesian coordination system.\nMatrix (c) is similar to matrix (b) but some of the off-\ndiagonal elements are nonzero. However, the matrix is still\nsymmetric on both sides of the diagonal. The geometry of the\ndata spread is still a 3D ellipse, but the three principal axes of\nthe ellipse are no longer parallel to the axes of the Cartesian\ncoordination system.\nThe origin of the three principal axes coincides with the\norigin of the coordination system but rotated around a pivot at\nthe origin. The above geometrical interpretation from the\neigenvectors and eigenvalues are restricted to a symmetric\nmatrix only. However, the eigenvalues are not necessarily\nreal. Sometimes, we may obtain imaginary eigenvalues as the\nroots of the equation det A I\n-\n( ) =\n 0 are not necessarily\nreal.\nIn a 3D space, the three roots (i.e., the eigenvalues of the\nmatrix) are either all real numbers or one real number with\ntwo imaginary numbers, which are conjugate to each other.\nThe eigenvectors can still be obtained from the eigenvalues\nalthough two of the eigenvalues may be imaginary numbers.\nBy taking the dot product of any two eigenvectors, the result\nis not necessary to be zero. It indicates that the three princi-\npal axes are not necessary to be orthogonal to each other.\nAlthough the geometrical interpretation of the eigenvectors\nand eigenvalues with imaginary number(s) is not easy to\ninterpret, obtaining the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the\nmatrices (i.e., the standard charts) may possibly form a basis\nfrom a mathematical perspective to analyze the relations\nbetween the charts.\nMathematical Basis of 36 Luo Shu\nVariations\nGenerating 17 Standard Charts From One Luo\nShu's Original Chart\nBy revisiting Table 1, the 17 standard charts could easily be\ngenerated from the original Luo Shu in two simple equa-\ntions. This was also mentioned in Ho's (2003) book in\nplain text. One basic technique adopted by the famous\nGreek philosopher, Pythagoras, has to be used here. He\nreduced all higher numbers to the original 10 numerals by\nsuccessively adding the digits together until a single digit\nwas reached. Let's build a function, Py(x or X) here to\nmemorize him, x being an integer and X being a matrix\nwhere the function applies to every element within. As an\n14:3 was reduced by some scholars to the number,\nPythagoreans, the number \"9\" refers to mankind. Let's rep-\nresent any standard chart by the symbol, FS(x+) or FS(y\u00ad).\nHere, FS, a function to create a matrix, means Flying Stars;\nx and y are the integers placed at the central palace; + or\n- means whether the flying trajectory is either forward or\nbackward, respectively.\nFS x\nx x x\nx x x\nx x x\n+\n( ) =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n+ + +\n+ + +\n+ + +\n\n\nPy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{ }\n, , , , , , , , ;\nSo et al. 7\nFS( )\nx\nx x x\nx x x\nx\n- =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n+ + +\n+ + +\n+\nPy -\nx x\nx\n+ +\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere , , , , , ,\n, , , .\n{ }\nAs a numerical example, the chart of the third Fortune\nCycle is given by\nFS( )\n+ =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPy\n=\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPy\n\n\n\n.\nDeterminant of the 36 Standard Charts\nAs discussed in the section \"A Review on Useful Techniques\nin Linear Algebra\" of this article, the determinant of a matrix\nhas a very important meaning related to the behavior of the\nmatrix. The determinants of the 36 standard charts are shown\nin Table 2. The following symbols are valid.\nFS\nFS\nx\nx\n\u00b1\n( )\n\u00b1\n( )\n,0o means the determinant (Det) of\nwithout a\nany rotation about the central palace\nmeans th\no\nFS x\u00b1\n( )\ne determinant of\nrotated clockwise by 90 as in Fi\no\nFS x \u00b1\n( ) g\nmeans the determinant of\nrotate\no\nFS\nFS\nx\nx\n\u00b1\n( )\n\u00b1\n( )\nd\no\nIt can be seen that the determinants of all FS without rota-\ntion but with 1, 4, or 7 at the central palace are identical to\neach other. That applies to other FS with 2, 5, or 8 and then\n3, 6, or 9. The equivalence is also extensible to the two FS\nwith rotations, if the negative sign is ignored.\nOne more observation is that the result is constantly equal\nto \"9\" when the function Py is applied to the absolute value\nof the determinant of any FS. That reminds us of the discus-\nsionon\"TheThreeBigTrigrams\"inthesection\"Applications\nof Luo Shu and Its Extended Charts in the Compass School,\"\nthe Pythagorean number \"9\", and the implication of the fig-\nure \"144,000\" in the Bible. Perhaps the evaluation of deter-\nminants could help to strengthen the currently most popular\ntheory of \"The Three Big Trigrams,\" which should be \"1-4-\nTo show that such equivalence is not generic with any\nmatrix similar to FS, every matrix of the first row in Table 2\nis rotated merely by 45, which has not been used in any\nschool of Chinese metaphysics, and the determinant of each\nmatrix is calculated, as shown in Table 3.\nTable 3 is for reference only, showing that the equivalent\nand elegant values of determinants of the 36 standard Charts\ndo not seem to be coincident or by luck because the proper-\npeared in Table 3.\nEigenvalues and Eigenvectors\nWe would like to propose a hypothesis here. Suppose the\nmatrices of the standard charts represent a geometrical space\nof independent vectors and coordinates, then, the eigenval-\nues and eigenvectors of all these matrices may give us some\nhints. As the numbers in the 36 standard charts are not sym-\nmetrical, a simple conversion is proposed here. All numbers\nare subtracted by \"5.\" In other words, the original system of\n3, 4}. It looks more symmetrical here. However, we do not\nmean that by doing so, the matrices will become symmetrical\nby themselves. After all, the numbers have long been called\nstars and that may mean Feng Shui masters have been treating\nTable 2. Determinants of 36 Standard Charts.\nTable 3. Determinants of Nine Standard Charts Rotated by 45 Clockwise.\n8 SAGE Open\nthem as symbols rather than pure numbers. We just propose\nto use a new set of symbols to replace the old symbols. Let's\ncall them FS\u00ad5 where 5 =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\nFor example,\nthe original Luo Shu\nnow becomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\nTable 4 shows the determinants, eigenvectors, and eigen-\nvalues of FS(x+,0)\u00ad5; Table 5 shows the determinants, eigen-\nvectors, and eigenvalues of FS(x\u00ad,0)\u00ad5; Table 6 shows the\ndeterminants, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues of FS(x+,90)\u00ad5,\nthat is, forward flying but rotated clockwise. Table 7\nshows the determinants, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues\nof FS(x+,270)\u00ad5, that is, forward flying but rotated\nanticlockwise. Most eigenvalues and eigenvectors are complex\nnumbers with a real part, Re, and an imaginary part, Img.\nFirst of all, determinants are checked. It can be seen that\nin all four tables, there are just three values of determinants,\nmuch simpler than before, that is, -54, 0, and 54. Except 0,\nthe Py of the other two, when taken absolute, is also equal to\nserved in and across all four tables, regarding the determi-\nnants, from Tables 4 to 7.\nRegarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, there are\nseveral observations.\ni. In all four tables, there is an extremely high level of\nsimilarity between these two parameters of eigenval-\nues and eigenvectors, corresponding to the following\nFS(4)-FS(6), within the same table. Here, the angle\nof rotation and (-5) are ignored for simplicity of\nexplanation. Although they are not 100% identical,\nthe magnitudes of the eigenvectors of these pairs are\nidentical, the difference being the direction only, pos-\nitive or negative. Readers could double check the real\nTable 4.

Just for the purpose of illustration, the determinants,\neigenvalues, and eigenvectors of nine matrices, still\nwith -4 to +4 at the central palace but other eight\nnumbers randomly placed, are shown in Table 8. As\nexpected, all those behaviors of similarity disappear.\nThat once again demonstrates that the 18 to 36 stan-\ndard charts of Luo Shu were not arbitrarily created or\nproduced by luck.\nConclusion\nIn this article, the importance and history of Luo Shu have\nbeen briefly reviewed, with an introduction to two methods\nwithin the Compass School of Feng Shui that heavily rely on\nthe operation of 18 or up to 36 variations of the Luo Shu. Then,\nit is hypothesized that Luo Shu, as a magic square, could be\nviewed as a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix, and such matrix could be further\nextended to 18 or 36 variations. The significance of two types\nof variations possessing patterns, including \"The Three Big\nTrigrams\" and \"Combined to Ten\" was also highlighted.\nObservations on similarity between different charts in terms of\ndeterminants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors have been con-\nfirmed and discovered. Such similarity may find its roots in\nancient literature on the Compass School of Feng Shui. The\nauthors are not certain how ancient Chinese knew about that as\nthey would not have any knowledge on modern algebra.\nThe extremely high level of similarity between Tables 6 and\n7 may explain why only 18 standard charts are popularly used\nin contemporary Flying Stars Method while the remaining 18\nare only used in some limited schools of Qi Men Dun Jia\nMethod. In fact, most modern Qi Men Dun Jia schools only\nTable 8.

That may be due to the\nhigh degree of dependence between the additional 18 standard\ncharts, resulting in a lower degree of freedom for applications.\nOne more simple and final observation is that all nine\n\"backward flying\" charts could be generated by the nine\n\"forward flying\" charts merely by rotation and vice versa.\nThe general formulae are shown below.\n( , ) ( , ),\n( , ) ( , ).\nx x\nx x\n- = +\n+ = -\no o\no o\nHaving recalled that the 36 standard charts were devel-\noped long time ago, it should not be something created just by\nluck or by chance. The main contribution of this article is to\nestablish the mathematical basis of studying Luo Shu and its\nvariations. With the use of the language of modern mathemat-\nics, the research of this area of ancient Chinese philosophy\nand metaphysics could be more conscientious and scientific.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nFereidouni, A.
