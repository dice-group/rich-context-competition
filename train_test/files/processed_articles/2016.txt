    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has recommended that no more than 5\u00ad15% of total dietary energy\nshould be derived from solid fats and added sugars (SoFAS). The guideline was based on USDA food pattern modeling\nanalyses that met the Dietary Reference Intake recommendations and Dietary Guidelines and followed typical American\neating habits. This study recreated food intake patterns for 6 of the same gender-age groups by using USDA data sources\nand a mathematical optimization technique known as linear programming. The analytic process identified food\nconsumption patterns based on 128 food categories that met the nutritional goals for 9 vitamins, 9 minerals, 8\nmacronutrients, and dietary fiber and minimized deviation from typical American eating habits. Linear programming Model\n1 created gender- and age-specific food patterns that corresponded to energy needs for each group. Model 2 created food\npatterns that were iso-caloric with diets observed for that group in the 2001\u00ad2002 NHANES. The optimized food patterns\nwere evaluated with respect to MyPyramid servings goals, energy density [kcal/g (1 kcal = 4.18 kJ)], and energy cost (US\n$/2000 kcal). The optimized food patterns had more servings of vegetables and fruit, lower energy density, and higher cost\ncompared with the observed diets. All nutrient goals were met. In contrast to the much lower USDA estimates, the 2\nmodels placed SoFAS allowances at between 17 and 33% of total energy, depending on energy needs. J. Nutr. 141:\n",

Providing most of the\nnonessential energy and few nutrients, SoFAS are said to be the\nroot cause of dietary imbalance (1). The 2010 Dietary Guide-\nlines Advisory Committee set SoFAS allowances at between 5\nand 15% of energy intakes, depending on energy needs (1).\nSoFAS allowances have replaced discretionary calories,\nfeatured in the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (1\u00ad5).\nCalculations of discretionary energy had been based on modeled\nfood patterns (6) that met known nutrient needs, promoted\nmoderation and balance, and took American food habits into\naccount (7). Following a decision framework used to develop the\nFood Guide Pyramid (8), USDA researchers adjusted food group\namounts when needed until a pattern either met the nutritional\ngoals or came within a reasonable range (4). Decisions were\nbased on the researchers' judgments of which food groups might\nreasonably provide the nutrients in question when the nutri-\ntional goals were not met (4). Further alterations were made to\nmake food patterns conform better to educational goals (4,8).\nAn alternative approach to translating nutritional goals into\nfood patterns is based on nonlinear or linear programming (LP)\nbeen used to create the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) (2,15) and other\nUSDA food plans at different levels of cost (16\u00ad18). LP models\ntake into account, simultaneously, nutritional goals, American\neating habits, and cost constraints (19\u00ad21). This study recalcu-\nlated SoFAS allowances in modeled food patterns that met\nnutritional goals and took existing food selections into account.\nFollowing Britten et al. (4), separate food patterns were created\nfor 6 gender-age groups. For each group, modeled patterns were\ncreated for 2 energy levels: recommended and observed.\nMaterials and Methods\nIn the present study, procedures used to develop MyPyramid food\npatterns (4) were followed (Fig. 1).\nEstablishing energy levels\nand .50 y.

The number of foods consumed by NHANES\nments, electrolyte solutions, chewing gum, and foods with an energy\ndensity , 10 kcal/100 g (e.g. water, coffee, tea) were excluded. Nutrient\ncomposition of foods was obtained from the USDA Food and Nutrient\nIndividual foods consumed by each age-gender group of NHANES\nparticipants were aggregated into 128 food categories, 39 food\nsubgroups, and 9 major food groups. The groupings largely followed\nthe USDA coding system in FNDDS. The number of food categories\nvaried from 85 to 128, whereas the number of food subgroups varied\nfrom 35 to 39. Consistent with the original Pyramid food groupings, the\n9 major food groups were fruits; vegetables; meat, poultry, and fish; eggs;\ndry beans, legumes, nuts and seeds; milk, yogurt, and cheese; bread,\ncereal, rice, and pasta; fats and oils; and sweets. FNDDS food codes and\nsubcodes may better correspond to what people eat in America than do\nmore idealized food groupings developed by Marcoe et al. (25) and used\nin the Britten (4) process.\nEstablishing nutrient profiles and unit price (US$/100 g) of food\ncategories\nNutrient profiles for each food category were calculated based on a\nweighted average of the nutrient contribution of each food, as based on\nthe FNDDS 1.0 nutrient composition data (26) and frequency of\nassigned based on the relative amounts consumed. Values for solid fat\nand added sugar embedded in foods were obtained from the MyPyramid\nEquivalents Database (28) for USDA Survey Food Codes (version 1.0).\nThe amount of added sugar in grams was calculated using a conversion\nNational food prices per 100 g of food, edible portion, were obtained\ndatabase (29). The price per 100 g for each food category was calculated\nbased on the weighted average of the unit price of each food. The weights\nwere assigned based on the amounts consumed.\nEstablishing nutritional goals\nAge- and gender-specific DRI values (30\u00ad33) were used for fiber, vitamins\nA, C, and E, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-6, folate, and vitamin\nB-12 and for calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium,\nzinc, potassium, and sodium. Because the potassium standard (4.7 g/d) is\ndifficult to meet (4) it was relaxed to 90% of adequate intake (AI) (i.e.\n4.23 g/d) following procedures adopted by the Thrifty Food Plan (15).\nPopulation-wide standards were used for protein, total carbohydrates,\ntotal lipids, SFA, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, cholesterol, and added\nsugar (24). These nutritional goals are summarized in Table 1.\nEstablishing consumption constraints\nGender- and age-specific consumption constraints were placed on food\ngroups and subgroups and on each food category. Optimized amounts\nfor the 9 food groups were flanked by the 10th and 90th percentiles of\nthe observed consumption in the referent age-gender group (Table 1).\nUpper bounds for food subgroups and food categories were set by the\n75th percentile of observed consumption of the referent age-gender\ngroup (Table 1).\nStringent criteria were imposed on introducing unfamiliar foods into\nthe optimized food patterns. If a given food group or category was not\nconsumed at all by a given age-gender group, it was not included in the\noptimized food intake patterns for that group.\nThe LP models\nModel 1 produced optimized food patterns for the 6 gender-age groups\nby setting energy intakes at the recommended levels (4). Model 2\nFIGURE 1 Process used to develop food intake patterns consistent\nwith DRI recommendations and Dietary Guidelines [modeled after\nBritten et al.

The LP models are\nsummarized in Figure 2.\nDecision variables and objective function. The LP model was based\non 85\u00ad128 food categories (i.e. decision variables). The objective function\nmeasured the deviation between current consumption and the optimized\nfood pattern for that age-gender group. The objective function was the\nsum of the absolute relative deviation (Dj\n) from each food subgroup j:\nDj\n\u00bc\n\n\n\n\n+\ni\u00bcIj\nQij\nj\n.\nQobs\nj\n\n\n\nTo apply LP, the objective function was transformed into a linear\nfunction using a method based on goal programming, as described\nelsewhere (17,20). For this purpose, new decision variables (2 <+) P1\nto\nPj\nto NJ\n, which represented the positive and the negative\ndeviations from observed food subgroup quantity, were substituted to\nthe absolute deviations Dj\n. The final linear function called F9 was\nexpressed as the sum of deviational variables (Fig. 2).\nDeviational variable constraints. The new decisions variables called\nPJ\nand NJ\nwere obtained adding a constraint (for each j), which defined\nthe deviation between the observed amount of a food subgroup j and the\namount of the same food subgroup in the optimized food pattern.\nEnergy constraints. In Model 1, the energy constraint was fixed equal\nto the energy requirement as established by the USDA for each age-\ngender group, following Britten et al. (4). In Model 2, the energy\nconstraint was fixed equal to the average observed energy intake for that\ngroup in the NHANES dataset.\nNutrient recommendations. Nutritional goals or constraints, outlined\nin Table 1, ensured for each food pattern the achievement of the DRI for\nfibers, 9 vitamins, 9 minerals, proteins, total carbohydrates, total lipids,\nlinoleic acid, linolenic acid, cholesterol, SFA, and added sugars.\nConsumption constraints. Consumption constraints, gender and age\nspecific, ensured that the optimized food patterns did not deviate too\nmuch from the usual eating habits of the American population. Each\nfood category was limited to the 75th observed percentile whereas each\nfood subgroup and food groups was limited to the observed 90th\npercentile of the observation distribution depending on gender-age\ngroups. All optimized food patterns were computed with the Simplex\nmethod, which is implemented in the \"proc optlp\" procedure available\nin the Operational Research package of SAS version 9.2 (2009, SAS\nInstitute).\nEvaluating model performance\nThe first set of analyses, conducted with Models 1 and 2, measured\ncompliance with MyPyramid goals. The observed diets and the food\npatterns were therefore converted into the MyPyramid food groups:\nfruits, vegetables, grains (whole and refined), meats and beans, milk and\nmilk products, and oils. The second set of analyses, conducted with\nModel 2, addressed dietary energy density, and energy cost. For each age-\ngender group, dietary energy density (kcal/g), daily cost (US$/d) and\nFIGURE 2 Description of the LP model.\nSolid fats and added sugar allowances in U.S. diets 335\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nenergy cost (US$/2000 kcal) were computed for the observed diets and\nthe optimized food patterns. Two kinds of energy density calculation\nwere used. Energy density based on all foods (including liquid foods) was\ncalled total energy density (kcal/g), whereas energy density based on\nsolid food only (34) was called solid energy density (kcal/g). In the 3rd set\nof analyses, SoFAS energy for each model and for each of the 6 food\npatterns were calculated as percentages of total daily energy (3,4).\nAll food patterns were expressed in percentage of DRI. Nutrients\nwere identified as limiting when the amount of nutrient in the optimized\npattern was exactly equal to the DRI.\nResults\nEach modeled food pattern satisfied the DRI for 9 vitamins and 9\nminerals and was within the recommended ranges for protein,\ncarbohydrate, fats, and essential fatty acids. Values for added\nsugars, SFA, cholesterol, and sodium were at or below the\nrecommended levels (Table 1).\nModel 1: recommended energy levels. In all 6 patterns, fruit\nand vegetable servings were close to or in excess of MyPyramid\nrecommendations (Table 2). Model 1 favored vegetables and\nfruit more than any other food group. By contrast, numbers of\nservings for milk, yogurt, and cheese were below MyPyramid\nvalues. Servings of meat, poultry, and fish were below\nMyPyramid values for the 20- to 30-y age groups and above\nrecommended values for older adults. Total grains servings\n(including whole grains) were low, in part because the grains\ngroup was high in sodium and low in potassium.\nThe present estimates placed SoFAS at between 273 and\n606 kcal/d, which contrasted with the estimates of SoFAS in\nMyPyramid food patterns ranging from 132 to 362 kcal/d (Table\nModel 2: observed energy levels. Food patterns that were\nisoenergetic with the observed diets were created by Model 2.\nThe observed consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains,\nand milk, yogurt, and cheese fell short of MyPyramid recom-\nmendations, whereas refined grains and meat products were\nconsumed in excess (Table 3).

Consistent with previous reports (1,2), SoFAS\naccounted for between 32 and 39% of total daily energy intakes.\nFood patterns for men, optimized using Model 2, had more\nservings of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and fewer\nservings of refined grains and meats. The number of servings for\nmilk and milk products increased for older men . 50 y. In\nnutritionally adequate diets, SoFAS allowances were between\nrelative to observed values.\nFood patterns for women had more servings of fruits,\nvegetables, and whole grains. For women in all age groups, the\noptimized food patterns contained more servings of meats and\nmilk and milk products. SoFAS allowances were between 261\nobserved values.\nOther characteristics of food patterns. The observed solid\nenergy density decreased with age group (range, 2.2 to 1.9 kcal/g\nfor men and 2.1 to 1.8 kcal/g for women), whereas the observed\nenergy cost per 2000 kcal increased with age group (from US\npatterns that were isocaloric with observed diets were lower in\nenergy density and higher in daily diet costs and energy costs.\nImprovement in diet quality without a difference of energy\nTABLE 2 Comparisons of MyPyramid recommendations with servings derived by Model 11,2\nMen Women\nMyPyramid Model 1 MyPyramid Model 1 MyPyramid Model 1 MyPyramid Model 1 MyPyramid Model 1 MyPyramid Model 1\nMyPyramid food groups4\n1 MyPyramid recommendations data come from Britten et al.

The USDA food patterns (4)\nmet almost all nutrient goals, with the exception of potassium,\nsodium, and vitamin E. These can be regarded as limiting\nnutrients. Potassium, sodium, and vitamin E were also the limiting\nnutrients in the present models (Table 5). For calcium and sodium,\nthe optimized diets were at exactly 100% DRI. Vitamin A was a\nlimiting nutrient only for men. The present modeling analyses\nwould suggest that calcium, potassium, vitamin E, and fiber may\nbe nutrients of concern in the American diet.\nDiscussion\nBased on the present LP model, optimized food patterns that\nmeet all nutrient requirements contained up to 33% of energy\nfrom SoFAS, depending on energy level. The present estimates\nintakes, values in sharp contrast with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines\nAdvisory Committee SoFAS allowances of 5\u00ad15% of energy (1).\nThe present LP models were in strict compliance with\nexisting U.S. recommendations and guidelines. For example,\nthe maximal amount of added sugars in the optimized food\npatterns was between 6.4 and 21.5% of total energy, below the\n25% guidelines set by the IOM for the US (24). There are\nconcerns that this value may be overly lax (35). It may be\nworthwhile to recalculate SoFAS using the stricter 10% guide-\nline for added sugars, as set by the WHO (36) and the French\nauthorities (37). However, even then, the likely SoFAS allowance\nis going to be higher than the 5\u00ad15% limit, due to the presence of\nsolid fats in many nutrient-dense foods.\nThe LP methodology (9,10) offers an alternative approach to\nfood pattern modeling (4). The present food patterns met all\nnutritional goals within prespecified energy needs, either\nrecommended (Model 1) or observed (Model 2).

The present\nmodel supports the notion that Americans need to make major\nchanges in their food patterns to achieve nutritionally sound\ngrains].\nThe present LP model differed in some important respects\nfrom past procedures (2,4,38). First, the principle that food\npatterns had to resemble American food selections, also\nespoused by the TFP and by Britten et al. (4), was strictly\napplied. Setting the objective function to minimize distance from\nthe current consumption, similarly to TFP modeling, is the\nstandard way to respect existing eating habits, an ostensible\nUSDA goal. Consumption constraints prevented the model from\nselecting food categories that were never consumed by the\nreferent population. Only those foods that were actually\nconsumed by the different age-gender groups in the NHANES\ndata were allowed to enter into the model and strict limits on\nconsumption amounts were set to guard against unrealistic\ndeviations from current eating habits. By contrast, the TFP had\nallowed for 10-fold increases in the consumption of selected\nfoods, raising the question whether its low cost targets were\nachieved at the expense of ignoring both cultural and social\nnorms (2). Britten et al. (4) allowed for a quadruple increase in\nthe consumption of whole grains and a doubling in the\nconsumption of dark green and orange vegetables and dry\nbeans (4).\nSecond, the present LP model applied nutritional constraints\nfor 9 vitamins, 9 minerals, dietary fiber, and 8 macronutrients\n(including added sugars), based on recommendations issued by\npliance with MyPyramid servings was an output variable, as\nwere energy density and energy cost. Britten et al. (4) first\nidentified appropriate amounts from each food group and then\ncross checked them against amounts of energy, 9 vitamins, 8\nminerals, 7 macronutrients, and dietary fiber (3,31). The\namount of \"discretionary energy\" (equated to SoFAS) was\ncalculated as the difference between total energy requirements\nand the energy that had to be consumed to meet nutrient needs.\nThe present LP model treated SoFAS embedded in each food as\nan output variable while simultaneously taking into consider-\nation all other nutrient needs.\nThird, the present model used between 85 and 128 food\ngroupings instead of 12 (4), making for more granular food\nchoices. Nutrient composition of food groupings was weighed\nby amounts consumed, a procedure also used by others\n(15,25,27). The present food categories largely resembled the\n96 mutually exclusive food categories, also based on aggregating\npublished by the National Cancer Institute (40).\nTABLE 5 Optimized food patterns from the Model 1 expressed in percent of DRI1\nNutrients Nutrient goals Unit\nMen Women\n1 Model 1 was based on the energy requirement.\n2 Nutrient goals were gender-specific.\n3 Nutrient goals were age-specific.\n4 Nutrient goals were gender and age-specific.\n5 In all of the 6 age-gender groups, RDA of vitamin E and potassium AI were not fulfilled in MyPyramid recommendations. In the present study, 90% of AI for potassium was used\nas a requirement.\n6 1 mg of vitamin E = 1.5 IU of vitamin E.\n7 For men aged .51y and women between 20 and 50 y, the RDA of iron was not reached by MyPyramid recommendations.\n8 Total energy.\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nThere were also similarities between prior studies and the\npresent results. The present model identified a number of\nlimiting nutrients, notably calcium and sodium at all energy\nlevels, and potassium, fiber, and vitamin E at some energy levels\nas highlighted by Britten et al. (4) and Wilde et al. (2).\nSoFAS are not discrete entities of known energy value.\nRather, SoFAS are embedded in different foods from every food\ngroup (7). To minimize SoFAS, the consumer is steered toward\nfat-free milk, low-fat cheeses, extra lean meats or fish, whole\ngrains, fresh fruit and vegetables (steamed, boiled, baked, or\ngrilled). However, the similarity between the present results and\nprevious LP models (2) suggests that the SoFAS allowances may\nbe too stringent for selected nutrient guidelines to be achieved\n(38). For example, Gao (41) showed that, depending on energy\nlevel, compliance with MyPyramid recommendations (including\nthose on discretionary energy) may be incompatible with\nachieving DRI for sodium or vitamin E (2,41).\nSome study limitations need to be noted. Dietary intakes\nwere based on 24-h recall, which precluded the individual long-\nterm food selections from being taken into account. Hence,\noptimized food patterns were developed for population sub-\ngroups rather than individuals, a procedure also followed by the\nUSDA (4). Finally, the model was limited to food intakes from\nmay be required to better address current dietary recommenda-\ntions and guidelines.\nIn conclusion, SoFAS allowances can and should be reduced\nfrom the existing level of 39% to 17\u00ad33%, depending on energy\nneeds. Based on the current dietary recommendations and\nrespecting American eating habits, the present LP model\ncreated food patterns than met all nutrient guidelines while\npermitting much more SoFAS than the MyPyramid diet allows.\nAccording to this LP model, that finding may mean the\nnutrition science community should consider making SoFAS\nrecommendations more permissive, with the proviso that the\npresent resetting of SoFAS allowances is not an invitation to eat\nmore. Rather, SoFAS allowances are best spent by making a\nbroader variety of nutrient dense food choices from every\nMyPyramid food group.\n"
