    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study compares Italian mothers' and Ecuadorian immigrant mothers' daily family routines. Thirty mothers took part in\nwith ages ranging from 18 to 46 years and having lived in Italy for an average of 15 years), with children ranging in age from\n4 to 8 years. The objective is to highlight the differences and similarities between the daily routines and family relations that\ncharacterize the lives of each of the two groups of participants. The instruments employed in service of these aims were\nin-depth interviews and diaries. The results showed similarities regarding the routines of Italian and Ecuadorian families.\nHowever, a relevant difference emerged regarding their perceptions of social support. Specifically, Italians receive more\nsocial support from their parents than do Ecuadorians, who are supported more by other relatives or by friends.\n",

Routines are particular to each family and reflect their\nmotivational and cultural models as moral values and norms\nand also their cognitive expectations about reality, as in their\nbeliefs about family life or parenthood. Routines influence the\ncultural systems that drive emotions and motivations and that\nare shared by family members and reinforced by intergenera-\ntional transmission. The \"custom complex,\" the practices and\nmeanings shared and transmitted from generation to generation,\nacquires a very important role in constructing the feelings of\npeople within the community (Mistry & Wu, 2010). Routines\nare individual aspects of family organizations that provide a\nspecificmeaningtothegroupanditsactivities(Fiese,Hammons,\n& Grigsby-Toussaint, 2012; Migliorini, Cardinali, & Rania,\n2011). Routines are defined as models of interaction and behav-\nior including two or more family members; because of their rep-\netition and stability over time, they provide predictability and\nspecific meaning for groups (Budescu & Taylor, 2013). Thus,\nfamily routines are daily practices that are regularly repeated\nwithin families (meals, bedtime, housework) that in fact\ncharacterize it, making it unique (Fiese, 2006). Routines are\nmodified following family life cycle transitions, so that they\nallow families to better accommodate changes.They are charac-\nterized by instrumental communication and define activities and\ntasks that people are expected to perform in a group, such as\nspecific family celebrations, different traditions of celebrating\nbirthdays or holidays, and interactive practices of daily life.\nSome characteristics of family routines are similar in different\nfamilies or cultural contexts but do not necessarily have the\nsame meaning or the same functions. For example, gender roles\nand beliefs about children's autonomy are influenced by cultural\nmodels that express themselves in different ways in the daily\nroutines of families from different cultures (Spagnola & Fiese,\n2007). Daily life is not just the background against which family\ninteractions develop but is also a protective factor that promotes\nfamily well-being (Passini, Melotti, Palareti, & Emiliani, 2003);\nincreasing feelings of safety, belonging, stability, cohesion, and\n1DISFOR, Department of Education Science, University of Genoa, Italy\nCorresponding Author:\nNadia Rania, DISFOR, Department of Education Science, University of\nEmail: nadia.rania@unige.it\nDaily Family Routines of Italian and\nEcuadorian Immigrant Mothers in\nEveryday Life: A Qualitative Approach\nUsing Diaries and Interviews\nNadia Rania1, Laura Migliorini1, Stefania Rebora1,\nand Paola Cardinali1\n Keywords\nroutine, family relations, diary, interview\n2 SAGE Open\nsatisfaction; and empowering children's social skills (Spagnola\n& Fiese, 2007) and their mental and physical health (Worthman,\nFamily Routines With Young Children\nRoutines are factors that mediate and interact with the ele-\nments that characterize children's development and with the\nevolution of the entire family. Most family activities and rou-\ntines change over time, evolving with children's growth and\ndevelopment. Fiese (2006) affirms that the routines of fami-\nlies with young children become more regular, for example,\nmealtimes, weekend activities, and negotiating new routines\nsuch as reading a story before bedtime or playing games\ntogether (Fiese, 2006). Another change that follows the\narrival of a child is the introduction of the grandparent figure,\nwho is able to materially and psychologically support the\nparents, playing the role of a \"stress buffer\" (Botcheva &\nFeldman, 2004). Grandparents help parents manage their\nchildren, making up for the lack of a welfare state (Stevenson,\nHenderson, & Baugh, 2007), in particular in families in\nwhich the mother has a job. They are figures whom parents\ntrust and who can care for their grandchildren with compe-\ntence and effectiveness (Gerard, Landry-Meyer, & Guzell\nRoe, 2006). Routines help to structure children's acceptable\nsocial behaviors. In the preschool period, children and par-\nents begin to negotiate some daily routines, for example, per-\nsonal cleanliness, bedtimes, and behavior during meals\n(Spagnola & Fiese, 2007). It must be highlighted that the\nroutines'structure and the parent\u00adchild interactions and rela-\ntionships cannot be ascribed solely to personality traits or to\nthe behaviors of other people; they are also the result of\nmutual interactions with the social and cultural contexts of\nfamilies' countries of origin (Izquierdo et al., 2006; Keller\nAs maintained by Worthman (2010), culture has a large\ninfluence on constructing everyday experiences during\ndevelopment; it becomes embodied through \"natural\" nur-\nturing. Spagnola and Fiese (2007) demonstrate that pre-\nschool children have more influence on the family unit\nbecause they are old enough to become more active partici-\npants in the daily course of family life and routines. In fact,\nduring this period the family's attention shifts from the cou-\nple toward their child (Fiese, Hooker, Kotary, & Schwagler,\n1993). The preschool period seems to be a critical time for\nfamily development; during this period, there is an increase\nin mealtime and weekend routines (Fiese et al., 1993). The\nimportance of mealtime and bedtime routines for the fami-\nlies of young children emerges from studies, and indeed,\nthese routines are used to communicate to children the rules\nabout social engagement and how to face and organize daily\nactivities. As was already stated, routines originally aimed to\nachieve daily tasks, but it is not unusual for them to take on\nan emotional connotation and a resulting change in rituals\nbecause simple activities acquire meaning. For example,\nbedtime is not only about getting children to fall asleep, but\nis also an occasion to spend quality time with them, to be\ntogether, cuddling and showing affection (Spagnola & Fiese,\n2007). Mealtimes are another family routine that is associ-\nated with better child mental and physical health (Flores,\nTomany-Korman, & Olson, 2005; Munoz, Israel, &\nAnderson, 2007). For example, during mealtimes, children\nhave the opportunity to develop their language skills; during\ndinner, families discuss the events of the day, talk about past\nstories, make plans for the future and so on (Spagnola &\nFiese, 2007), all of which exposes children to rich language,\nnarratives, explanations, and cultural rules about speech\n(Aukrust, 2002; Ely, Gleason, MacGibbon, & Zaretsky,\n2001). The presence of a number of people during meals\nallows the language to become richer and more complex than\nin a dyadic situation (Blum-Kulka & Snow, 2002). The con-\nversation during mealtimes can explicate the family's emo-\ntional climate because it is characterized by verbal and\nnonverbal affective expressions and offers the opportunity to\ntalk about feelings, affect, and empathy (Herot, 2002). One\nmore routine that is important for families with young chil-\ndren is reading books together; this can support the develop-\nment of literacy skills and sets the stage for enjoying their\nschool years (Fiese, Eckert, & Spagnola, 2006). Rosenkoetter\nand Barton (2002) suggest that the routine of joint book read-\ning promotes later academic success. This routine not only\ninvolves regular engagement with family members but also\ncuddling, explicitly, through the reading of a favorite story,\ntaking turns repeating familiar statements, adding personal\ntouches to the story and so on. This allows children to per-\nceive book reading as a positive event, a positive experience\nthat will be useful during school years. In the lives of young\nchildren, routines also improve socialization skills and repre-\nsent an opportunity to build \"scaffolding\" to positively sup-\nport children's development. They enable children to\nstructure their behavior toward achieving goals and then\npresent the opportunity to offer praise and encouragement\nHowever, within the theoretical framework that has been\noutlined, and considering the breadth of the work on this\nissue, there are few studies of routines in the contexts of\nmigration. Few studies investigate the everyday lives of fam-\nilies, which is an important component of family well-being.\nThe entire migratory process, in fact, could represent a\npotential factor of family vulnerability.\nFamily and Migration\nWestern countries, and societies in general, are now living in a\nglobal and multicultural context (Cushner, 2008) in which\nembedded people directly experience mutual cultural influ-\nences between the people in their daily lives. Migration, in fact,\nis considered, from a community psychology perspective, an\necological transition that involves vast changes in the contexts\nof interactions (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Garcia-Ramirez et al.,\nRania et al. 3\n2005). The recent multiethnic dimensions of individual coun-\ntries, and of Western societies in general, animate various stud-\nies about immigrants' integration (Dandy & Pe-Pua, 2010). In\nthese contexts, immigrant groups often find themselves in the\nminority position, which has implications for the ways in which\nthey adapt and negotiate their ethnic and cultural identities\n(Soon, 2002; Yij\u00e4l\u00e4, L\u00f6nnqvist, Jasinskaja-Lahti, & Verkasalo,\n2012). In addition, native families are involved in a process of\nmutual exchange that occurs when different cultural groups\ncome into contact with each other (Van Oudenhoven & Ward,\n2013), and indeed, acculturation processes produce changes in\nboth migrant populations and the host communities (Larsen,\nVazov, Krumov, & Schneider, 2013; Rania, Migliorini,\nCardinali, & Rebora, 2015; Rania, Migliorini, Rebora, &\nThe migration experience should be read in the particular\nsituations in which it is placed; each family that migrates, in\nfact, participates in a variety of contexts that may represent\nconditions of inclusion or exclusion, areas that are character-\nized by different ethnic and/or social classes, education lev-\nels, religions, and so on. These factors make up a particular\necological niche (Super & Harkness, 1986) that corresponds\nto a set of protective or risk factors and to processes of nor-\nmality or specific difficulty. People who move to a new\ncountry are also exposed to important changes and life stress-\nors associated with the search for home or work, the recogni-\ntion of skills acquired in the country of origin, and the\nidentification of resources and services that allow them to\nintegrate into the new situation without excessive psycho-\nlogical or emotional costs (Kelaher, Williams, & Manderson,\n2001). The migration experience is generally a highly stress-\nful event for many reasons from the need to learn a new lan-\nguage in a short time to facing possible discrimination; in\nthese cases, the stress related to the new environment adds to\nthe stress of family life (Baccallao & Smokowsky, 2007).\nAdapting to a new culture has been identified as a phenom-\nenon of culture shock. Culture shock is the transition from a\nfamiliar to an unfamiliar environment in which old behavior\npatterns become ineffective (Lysgaard, 1955). The stages of\nadaptation are euphoria (honeymoon), disillusionment,\nadjustment, and integration (Beamer & Varner, 2003).\nIndividual adaptation to the new cultural context may be\nfavored by positive feelings and satisfaction about a person's\nown situation and the sense of self-efficacy he or she per-\nceives in the context, that is, the individual's ability to\ndevelop relationships with people who belong to the host\nculture (Moghaddam, Taylor, & Wright, 1993).\nAccording to Ward (1996), the intensity of the stress and\ndifficulties related to the new contexts for immigrants depend\non how much the original culture differs from the host cul-\nture; this difference may be moderated by contact with the\nhost culture and by factors such as language skills, motiva-\ntion, and supportive social inclusion. The process of mutual\nadaptation that follows is a basic human need; individuals\nmust regain equilibrium and the sense of security and\nbelonging that is so strongly connected with psychological\nand social well-being.\nMigration also carries within it some changes: family\nstructure linked to migratory movements (starting order and\nreunions), the distance from the country of origin, and the\nconsequent maintenance of two memberships, the transna-\ntional families (Boccagni & Lagomarsino, 2011; Herrera,\nCarrillo, & Torres, 2005), and the family structure tends to\nbecome larger than the nuclear family structure that held in\nthe country of origin (Donati, 2014; Ghiringhelli & Marelli,\n2011). The migration process can reflect extreme situations\nin which minors are alone in the migration, following a\nfamiliar mandate, and this condition presents a peculiar fra-\ngility. For this reason, institutions create services that support\nunaccompanied children in the attempt to replace the absence\nof their families (Rania, Migliorini, Sclavo, Cardinali, &\nThe literature has given importance to the cultural parent-\ning model related to children's education and growth\nPenderi & Petrogiannis, 2011). Adult migrants bring with\nthem ideas, values, and expectations that may differ greatly\nfrom the cultural patterns shared by members of the host\nsociety (Bornstein & Cote, 2004; Garc\u00eda Coll & Pachter,\n2002). They possess implicit knowledge about educating\nchildren, including development goals, care practices, com-\nmunication styles, and values, and they are involved in a pro-\ncess of encounter-clash with the attitudes and parenting\nbehaviors of the new country (Gratier, 2003). These styles,\nobjectives, and care practices create knowledge and beliefs\nthat tend to remain unchanged for a time when families\nchange their physical environments and cultural references\neven when circumstances in the receiving country are differ-\nent from those in the country of origin.\nThe challenge for these families is to attempt to bring\ntogether different meanings and cultural knowledge related\nto parenting styles and child care practices, attempting to\nmanage their ambivalence between the desire to keep their\ncultural interpretation and the desire to acquire those of the\nhost society. A phenomenon present in the literature is the\nrole reversing in the processes of socialization in the new\ncontext where a child or adolescent takes care of typical roles\nand responsibilities of adulthood, becoming a familiar pat-\ntern that may be dysfunctional (Scabini, Regalia, Giuliani,\nhave noted that the belief systems of immigrant parents tend\nto resemble those used in the country of origin from previous\ngenerations. That is, ideas, beliefs, and care and socialization\npractices appear to represent cultural patterns that are rela-\ntively resistant to change. However, a number of other\nresearchers have noted that the attitudes, values, and behav-\niors of immigrant families are influenced by processes of\nacculturation and integration within the host cultures (Berry,\n4 SAGE Open\nThe Context of the Study\nEcuadorian migration in Italy dates back to 1970 and the\nhighest increase attendance Ecuadorian registers in the sec-\nond half of the nineties. Available data show that between\nimmigration in Italy is characterized by the prevalence of\nfemale employed mainly in the field of social services and\npeople. The presence of Ecuadorian is consolidating with\nan increase of the second generation and long-term resi-\ndence permits, as well as an increase in family reunifica-\ntion. In sociodemographic composition of Ecuadorian\nimmigration, it is possible to identify three profiles, which\nmay be corresponding to several stages of the migration\ncycle: the first migrants (mainly women), children reunited,\nand reconstituted families (Boccagni & Lagomarsino,\n2011). The present study was conducted in Genoa, a city of\nLiguria region (Italy). In Genoa, Ecuadorians are the larg-\nest of immigrant groups. On January 1, 2011, the most\nnumerous cultural groups (in thousands) in Italy were\n(452.424), but Liguria does not reflect this cultural break-\ndown; in fact, the cultural group with the largest presence is\npopulation in Italy). North Italy, with 81% of admissions, is\nthe first goal of the Ecuadorian community, with a higher\nincidence of more than 16 percentage points compared to\nthe overall immigrant population (65%). The first three\nregions of settlement are Lombardia (44.5%), Liguria\npopular Italian region among Ecuadorians, in particular,\nmost of them choosing to live in Genoa (16.753; Istituto\nnazionale di statistica [ISTAT], 2012). Not surprisingly,\nmost of the Ecuadorian immigrants come from the city of\nGuayaquil, where there is a huge presence of Italians from\nGenoa who migrated there at the end of the 19th century. In\nthe 1990s, Ecuador survived a socioeconomic crisis that\ndrained the middle class and supported an exodus. Studies\nconducted in Genoa have noted that from the beginning of\nthe Ecuadorian migration phenomenon in Italy, the women\nled the way in the migration (Pagnotta, 2003), to be joined\nby their husbands and children later (Queirolo Palmas,\n2004). These women were accustomed to finding employ-\nment as housemaids and especially as in-home nurses\nbecause of the large number of elderly people living in\nstudies conducted on immigrant women in Italy, they\nunderline the characteristics of Ecuadorian culture and they\ndeepen the different gender role in the family structure.\nBoccagni and Lagomarsino (2011) focus on the dynamics\nof transnational motherhood of Ecuadorians, who have to\nmanage the difficult balance to cover two different but\ncomplementary roles: breadwinner and caregiver at a\ndistance.\nThe Research\nObjectives\nThis study aimed to explore, applying cross-cultural\napproach, the similarities and differences between Italian\nand Ecuadorian mothers in routines and family relations that\nare generally investigated in cultural psychology. The study\nwas specifically focused on culturally determined family\nroutines and lifestyles, which provided a global perspective\non a regular family day, including the habits and behaviors in\nspecific daily situations (e.g., taking the children to school or\npicking them up, dinner organization). The analysis of the\nfamilies' routines allowed us to understand how parental\nroles are structured and how couples share domestic tasks.\nFurthermore, it enabled us to understand how the routines\nhelped to know the roles of the people who provided social\nsupport in daily life and child care.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThirty mothers living in Genoa took part in the present study,\neach with a child below 10 years of age. This family phase\nwas chosen because family routines are particularly impor-\ntant for the development of young children (Spagnola &\nfirst immigration and did not speak Italian before arriving in\nGenoa. There was little difference between the groups with\nregard to the number of children (M = 1.7 Italians, M = 1.6\nEcuadorians) and age (M = 6.5 Italians, M = 8.5 Ecuadorians).\nSome of the foreign participants were recruited through the\nchurch, which plays a large role in the Ecuadorian commu-\nnity in this city, and more were identified through snowball\nsampling; after the interviews, many mothers provided the\ncontact details of friends who agreed to take part in the\nresearch. The Italian participants were recruited through\ntheir children's schools. The majority of Italian participants\nwere married (n = 12), only 1 was separated and 2 were\ncohabiting. Similarly, most of the Ecuadorian mothers were\nmarried (n = 9) or cohabiting (n = 4); 1 was divorced and 1\nwas a single mother, and their partners were also Ecuadorian.\nIn the Italian group, 8 participants had a job and 7 were\nunemployed. Similarly, in the Ecuadorian group, 8 partici-\npants were employed, primarily as domestic workers, and 7\nwere unemployed. The education qualifications possessed\nby the most participants in both groups was high school\ngraduation (Italians n = 9, Ecuadorians n = 11). Three Italian\nand 3 Ecuadorian mothers had college degrees, and 3 Italian\nmothers and 1 Ecuadorian mother possessed a middle school\ndegree. Generalizing these data, it was possible to affirm the\nhomogeneity of the two participant groups.\nRania et al. 5\nMeasures\nThis study had a multimethod approach that used different\nself-report techniques (diaries and in-depth interviews) to\ninvestigate the same participants about the same topic\n(Kremer-Sadlik, Fatigante, & Fasulo, 2008; Overall &\nSibley, 2010), but in reading about the object families from\ndifferent points of view, with the diaries, the researcher\nfocused on routines and practices during interactions, and\nthrough the interviews, the researcher was able to access the\ninternal representation of the relationship and how people\nmake sense of personal experiences.\nDiary method. In the present research, two types of written\ndiary, each completed only once, investigated the partici-\npants' and their families' habits on a regular weekday and a\nregular weekend, providing a view of Italian and Ecuadorian\nfamilies' current routines. The main dimensions investigated\nwere family routines and lifestyles. The diary's grid was\ndivided into three main areas: morning, afternoon, and eve-\nning (Kremer-Sadlik et al., 2008). Participants were also\nasked to provide the times and places where activities took\nplace and details of the people who took part in the activities\nIn-depth interviews.The in-depth interviews followed the\nEcocultural Family Interview (EFI; Weisner, Coots, & Bern-\nheimer, 1997), which collates narrations about people's daily\nroutines to document the culture and specific ecology of a\ncommunity. The interviewee was invited to rethink his or her\nregular day, describing the actions, customs, feelings, and\nreason that underlie the routines. The dimensions investi-\ngated were family routines and lifestyles. The interview\nbegins by asking the mother if she can tell \"typical day\" and\nthen it is deepened themes that emerge spontaneously from\nconversation.\nProcedure\nThis research was conducted following the ethical norms\nstipulated by the AIP (Italian Psychology Association). The\nmeeting place (usually the school the children attended or the\nchurch) and time of interview varied according to the moth-\ners' availability. Interviews were conducted by an Italian\nresearch team, in the Italian language, without the need for\nan interpreter, and they were usually 1 hr in duration. Before\nthe interview, each participant received an informed consent\nform that contained a brief explanation about the research\nand informed potential participants that the interview would\nbe audio-recorded and the data processed and anonymized; it\nalso assigned a code to each participant that allowed her\ninterview to be aggregated with those of the other mothers\nduring the analysis, in compliance with Italian Law on\nasked each participant to fill in a diary that allowed for\nsystematizing the information that emerged during the\ninterviews.\nData Analysis\nDiary. The data from the diaries were codified by two inde-\npendent judges. They used grids for each diary type (week-\ndays and weekends) that separated the Italian and Ecuadorian\nparticipants. The data were organized in two tables to facili-\ntate comparison between the immigrant and Italian mothers\nduring weekdays and weekends.\nIn-depth interviews. The in-depth interviews were codified by\ntwo independent judges following the constant comparison\nanalysis technique (Leech & Onwuegbuzie, 2011) within a\ngrounded theory approach (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The\njudges applied the protocol analysis separately, and after-\nward met to compare the identified categories and select\nthose that best accounted for the different points of view to\nobtain a common categorization using NVivo 9 software data\nanalysis (2010). In the event of discord between the two\njudges, they discussed the item to reach agreement.\nResults\nBelow are the results of the routines and lifestyles that were\ninvestigated through the diaries and the interviews. Two\nadditional areas are also presented: parental roles and the\nsharing of tasks and social support, both of which emerged\nduring the deeper investigations of the families' routine life-\nstyles through the interviews.\nFamily Routine and Daily Lifestyles\nData analysis highlighted the most significant moments in the\nfamilies' daily routines, from waking the children until the\nmoment they went to sleep. In the following tables, some\nexamples are presented of diary entries for weekdays (Table 1)\nand weekends (Table 2) from the mothers in both groups.\nOn weekdays, the women in both groups awoke in the\na few cases, the Ecuadorians woke up very early (5.45\na.m.). Italians have breakfast with their children more\noften, whereas Ecuadorians eat alone, although the number\nof mothers who had breakfast with the entire nuclear family\nwas the same in both groups. The majority of time, mothers\nin both Italian and Ecuadorian families take the children to\nschool and pick them up. In both groups, most mothers are\nemployed, although others do housework in the mornings.\nand Ecuadorians were equally distributed across all possi-\nble options: having lunch alone, with children, or with the\nnuclear family. The Italian lunch is a complete meal con-\nsisting of pasta and a main dish; Ecuadorian mothers pre-\nferred to eat Italian food most frequently, generally\n6 SAGE Open\nincluding pasta; some of them alternated between Italian\nand ethnic food, and in a few cases, participants stated that\nthey ate exclusively traditional dishes or fast food. In the\nafternoons, it was again mothers who mainly picked the\nchildren up from school, and the children in both groups do\nhomework or play outdoors; Italian children played sports\nfor both Italians and Ecuadorians is mainly spent with the\nnuclear family. Italian mothers prefer to eat only one course,\npasta or a main dish, whereas the Ecuadorian mothers more\noften alternate their traditional dishes with Italians ones or\nprefer to eat Italian food. After dinner, the mothers of both\nallow their children time to play or watch television. In\nfamilies interviewed from both cultural backgrounds, it is\nthe mother who usually puts the children to bed by 10:30\np.m. Italians cuddle and talk with the children, tell them a\nstory or pray; Ecuadorians did not report any particular\nroutine, just that some mothers prefer to tell a story or pray\nwith the children.\nOn the weekends, both groups awake between 7:00 a.m.\nand 9:00 a.m. Italians have breakfast with the family more\noften than Ecuadorians, who are accustomed to having\nbreakfast only with their children. On Sunday mornings,\nmost Italian and Ecuadorian families go to church, and in\nalmost the same number of cases, Italians report that they go\ngroups, Sunday lunch involves the entire nuclear family, and\nin the Ecuadorian group, if possible, the grandparents are\nalso present.

The narrations revealed that nearly always,\nthe mothers (Italian and Ecuadorian) were responsible for\nwaking the children up, cooking breakfast, and taking them\nto kindergarten--both working mothers and housewives--\nas was corroborated by the data collected in the diaries: \"In\nthe morning, I wake up at 7:00 a.m. and cook breakfast for\nmy children\" (Ecuadorian02); \"In the morning, we get up, I\ncook breakfast, we eat it, and after, I take the children to\nschool\" (Italian12). In some cases, the grandparents helped\nout by taking the children to kindergarten, more among the\nItalian mothers than the immigrants. \"We leave for work at\n7:00 a.m., so my parents come to our home and take the\nchildren to school; they do that every morning\" (Italian05).\nOnly a few Ecuadorian mothers preferred to share accompa-\nnying the children to school with their husbands: \"Sometimes\nI take her to school, and sometimes my husband; it depends\non our tasks\" (Ecuadorian01). Some Italian mothers used\nthe school bus service (Italian01: \"I see off my son to take\nthe school bus; it is really near to my home\"). As was also\nhighlighted in the diaries, mothers are also the protagonists\nof managing the afternoon activities. The results showed\nthat Italian children were more committed to sports activi-\nties than were the immigrant children (Italian09: \"Almost\nevery afternoon, we are busy because of the sports; they\nplay football and volleyball\"). Similarly, Italian children go\nout to play more often, accompanied by their mothers\n(Italian11: \"They need to vent in the afternoon; that's why I\ntake them to the park or the beach to play until 6:30 p.m.\"),\nor they go to the cinema (Italian14: \"I often take her to the\ncinema or the theater. She really likes it\") or to catechism\n(Italian06: \"Once a week, I take her to catechism\") and\nchurch meetings (Italian05: \"We go to the Jehovah's\nWitnesses' meetings. They have to be put in contact with\nGod\"). Only a very small number of both groups referred to\ntaking their children to play with friends (Italian01: \"In the\nafternoon, I often accommodate in my home my children's\nfriends, or I take them to their friends' houses to play\ntogether\"). The dinner routine characterized the final part of\nthe day; it was described by the mothers in both groups as an\nimportant moment that allowed the family to meet together\nand talk about the experiences of the day (Ecuadorian12:\n\"We have dinner together; it is a moment to talk and share\nwhat we did during the day.\" Italian10: \"Yes, we have din-\nner together every day; it is an important moment for the\nfamily\"). The participants referred to the \"sacrifices\" they\nmade in managing the daily routines. A large number com-\nplained that they had hectic lives and had no time for them-\nselves (Italian02: \"It is normal to make sacrifices for the\nfamily. I stay all the day with my children, and I realize that\nis difficult to go to the hairstylist or to the doctor\"). Others\nstressed how their lives were now entirely centered on their\nchildren (Italian08: \"Your life as a parent changes. For\nexample, the schedule, at 9:00 p.m. you are almost going to\nsleep, which is more suitable for children\"). Some mothers\nwho were interviewed highlighted how difficult things\ncould be because their parents lived in another country\n(Ecuadorian15: \"Becoming a mother stops everything! My\ndaughters are my life, but they stopped everything, also\nbecause I don't have help. I have to manage everything:\nwork, home, children. Everything, everything, every-\nthing!\"). One more difficulty that emerged was finding the\ntime for their relationships and their husbands, without the\npresence of children, a difficulty that was noted more by\nthe Italians than the Ecuadorians (Italian09: \"I have not been\nalone with my husband since the honeymoon. I desire to\ntake a trip of a couple of days with him, without children.\nThis kind of freedom is the only sacrifice that I perceive\").\nIn addition, mothers in both groups reported feeling\noppressed by the economic commitment necessary to ensure\ntheir children's material well-being (Italian12: \"If you live\nwith a salaried worker, you stupidly give up something for\nyourself to buy that for your daughter\"; Ecuadorian07: \"I\ngive up many things! I didn't buy a coat for one year. Before\nI bought clothes for me; now I think primarily of my\nchildren\").\nParental Roles and Sharing of Tasks\nThe family routine that generally involves fathers is the\nshared game that usually occurs at home during the final part\nof the day (Ecuadorian13: \"Mostly she plays with her father.\nIt is an important moment for my husband, and he wants to\nenjoy it, and they play and laugh a lot!\" Italian14: \"Since\nalways, it is my husband who plays with the children. I think\nthat fathers are born to do that\"). Many mothers, mostly\nEcuadorian, said that they frequently play with their children\n(Ecuadorian08: \"Maybe we draw or we cook together; if she\nwants we play Monopoly\"), and a few mothers said that they\nplay together (Italian03: \"We play Ring a Ring o'Roses or\nother games such as little puzzles . . . she has fun\"). There was\nalso one child who played alone (Ecuadorian06: \"He plays\nalone almost always, with the PlayStation\"), and one mother\nreported playing with her children on rare occasions\n(Italian01: \"I had more time to play with them before; now\n8 SAGE Open\nthere is my job, and then to care about the house . . . I don't\nhave much time\"). Some Italian women referred to frequently\norganizing play dates that allow their children to play with\ntheir friends (Italian05: \"The days that they are free, I try to\nensure that they always have company to play with. I invite\nhome their friends, or I take my children to their friends'\nhouses\"). Furthermore, as in the case of games, putting chil-\ndren to bed was often a father's task in both groups\n(Ecuadorian11: \"Usually his father makes him fall asleep; it is\nhis task\"; Italian04: \"Usually her father at 9 o'clock takes her\nto her room and she falls asleep\"), although some Italian and\nEcuadorian couples did that together (Italian07: \"Me and my\nhusband usually bed down children together to do it faster\";\nEcuadorian10: \"Together we prepare her for sleep, baby bot-\ntle, diaper\"). Families manage this in different ways; physical\ncontact was important (Ecuadorian10: \"She falls asleep in my\narms\"; Italian08: \"She needs contact; she needs to touch me\nto fall asleep\"), as was reading stories (Ecuadorian03: \"They\nsleep when I read them a story\"; Italian15: \"When they were\nyounger, I read them tales; now that they are grown, they read\nby themselves\"). In particular, some children were in the\nhabit of spending a large part of the night or the entire night in\nthe parents' bed, and it emerged that in some cases, the par-\nents did not want to give up this practice (Ecuadorian14: \"He\nfalls asleep only if he is in my bed with me, and then I take\nhim to his bed\"; Italian13: \"He still sleeps with us . . . he is\ncuddled by mum and dad, actually more by dad, who wants\nour child to sleep with us, and says: `Until we can do that'\").\nSome mothers said that they sent their children to sleep with\na simple exchange of kisses and saying goodnight (Italian07:\n\"We are lucky; they simply want a kiss and then fall asleep\nwithout problems\"; Ecuadorian15: \"My eldest daughter\ncomes to say goodnight before going to bed, and we kiss each\nother\"). However, some other interviewees reported on this\nmoment as an opportunity to play with their children\n(Italian03: \"We lie together in bed playing, and then he falls\nasleep\"; Ecuadorian14: \"He usually falls asleep alone, play-\ning with his cars\"), to talk (Italian14: \"It is a beautiful moment\nbecause we talk about the day spent\"), or to say a prayer\ntogether (Ecuadorian03: \"They lie down and we pray\ntogether\"; Italian13: \"Before going to sleep, we say a prayer\nto thank God for the day\"). For some Ecuadorian children, the\nroutine of going to sleep includes listening to music\n(Ecuadorian13: \"She washes herself, and later she listens to\nmusic to fall asleep\"), watching television (Ecuadorian08: \"I\nuse the timer on the television, 30 minutes and then every-\nbody is asleep\"), or having a shower (Ecuadorian05: \"His\nritual before going to sleep is take a shower; he wants me to\nwash him\"). As a result, some Ecuadorian mothers said that\ntheir children needed a great deal of time to fall asleep\n(Ecuadorian04: \"It is not easy for my son to fall asleep; it usu-\nally takes him 30 minutes\"), and a few Italians affirmed that\ntheir children are used to falling asleep on the couch (Italian12:\n\"It is easy to get her to fall asleep; you just have to lay her on\nthe couch\").\nSocial Support in Daily Routines\nIn terms of the support that they received with respect to\nchild care, although they were the predominant figures in the\ndevelopment of daily routines, the mothers related how they\nreceived support from their husbands (Ecuadorian10: \"My\nhusband is really helpful. He says to me: `Don't worry about\nthat, I will do it'\"; Italian08: \"It is something natural. We\nnever make a firm division of tasks; we help each other\"),\ntheir grandparents (especially Italians; Italian03: \"We try to\ndo everything by ourselves, but for every need, we know that\nwe can count on our parents\"), and other kin or friends, usu-\nally compatriots (especially Ecuadorians): \"Usually I ask for\nhelp from the mothers of my children's classmates, who are\nItalian and Ecuadorians mothers. They escort my children\nfrom school to home. We help each other mutually.An Italian\ngirl really helped me when my children were younger and\ndidn't go to kindergarten, I didn't know who to trust them\nwith!\" (Ecuadorian08)\nSome Italian mothers are supported in family routines by\na babysitter (Italian11: \"This year, I asked for help from a\nbabysitter, because I cannot do more\").\nHowever, not all participants reported being helped by\nsomeone in managing their children. Indeed, approximately\nhalf of them stated they were nearly alone; they could not rely\nupon their husbands, mostly because of work (Ecuadorian11:\n\"Nobody helps me. Until this moment, I did everything by\nmyself\"). It is important, however, to stress that a small num-\nber of mothers considered themselves more suited to caring\nfor children (Italian14: \"I do everything, mostly because men\nare not able to understand\").\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThis work has allowed us to deepen the analysis of family\nroutines in a context of migration that has been little studied\nin the literature. Comparing the family lifestyles of Italian\nand Ecuadorian immigrants reveals competence in family\nsystems regarding building routines in this delicate stage\nwith young children, who are important representatives of\nfamily well-being. During the transition to parenthood and\nthe phase of the life cycle with young children, balancing the\nparental role, work, and family is a crucial developmental\ntask (Feldman, Sussman, & Zigler, 2004).\nAnalyzing these routines has allowed us to combine the\npresence of events, child care, and regular activities and, at\nthe same time, the perception of how these are conducted by\nthe family components. Furthermore, the functions that rou-\ntines play in the coordination of multiple lines of activities\nwereanalyzedinworkingmothersbyAlbyandZucchermaglio\n(2014). In fact, in analyzing the daily routines, the everyday\nactions and the meanings attributed to them, it is possible to\naccess the implicit aspects of culture (Axia & Weisner,\n2000). Furthermore, investigating routines allowed for the\nindirect analysis of family processes, such as the balance of\nRania et al. 9\nroles, family cohesion, and support, all of which are impor-\ntant elements of family life.\nIn everyday practice, people rework the categories of man\nand woman and their attributions, even though gender cannot\nbe considered to be tied to a specific context but pervades our\nwhole life. In family settings, gender features are confirmed\nand/or changed as \"social construction.\" A family can be\nconsidered a particular community of practices in which\nthese processes are embedded. Addressing the issue of gen-\nder within the family itself is a complex issue for a number\nof reasons. First, in recent decades, one is confronted with\ndeep changes related to being a family and to parenting\n(Migliorini & Rania, 2008) that are not always followed by\ncultural and social changes. Second, recent decades have\nseen an increase in women working outside of the home,\nwith demands from both the employment and the family con-\ntexts. This condition has contributed to increased stress and\nrole overload (Higgins, Duxbury, & Lyons, 2010).\nIn the present article, through the analysis of the diaries\nand in-depth interviews, we underlined similarities and dif-\nferences between Italian and Ecuadorian mothers in manag-\ning their daily routines and caring in their parental roles. The\nmost important result that emerges is the similar matrifocal\nelement of the family units, indeed mothers complied with\nself-report techniques. The main element that appeared from\nour interviews was the prevalence of women in all the activi-\nties that were examined, for both Italians and Ecuadorians, as\nwas also reported in a study by Pinto and Coltrane (2013). In\nmost cases, mothers reported that they had the main role in\nthe child and family care practices and in the domestic work,\nin line with the study by Zajczick and Ruspini (2008).\nThe data seem to reveal that the main commonality\nbetween the groups of participants was the traditional gender\nrole perspective: Women are devoted to family tasks and\nmanage the housework, and men earn the income (Evertsson\n& Nermo, 2004). However, the mothers confirmed that the\nfather figure was involved more in affective and emotional\ndimensions, for example, with bedtime routines and games;\nthis is consistent with recent researches realized in Italian\ncontext with working mothers and fathers (Alby & Di Pede,\nresults prefigure one area that is associated with affective\nfather figures that in the scientific literature is generally asso-\nciated with the role of the mother (Scabini & Cigoli, 2012).\nThese data can be understood in the light of recent studies\nabout the involvement of fathers (Yoshida, 2012). However,\nTanturri and Mencarini (2009) underline, with their research,\nthat the children care is a mainly female task, while the\nItalian father's participation is restricted to certain activities.\nFurthermore, children care by fathers is high only in few\nfamilies. The data of present work, in line with several\nItalians recent studies (Alby & Di Pede, 2014; Alby et al.,\n2014), propose the image of a paternity slowly changing and\nthat is being redefined: new fathers seem to be more involved\nin the care of the children but mainly in recreational and\nexecutive activities, whereas mothers have a more active and\norganizational role than fathers.\nAccording to the mothers who were interviewed, grand-\nparents were the second most present figures in managing\nthe children's routines, although in the diaries, grandparents\nwere not named by a large number of mothers. In that regard,\nwe hypothesized that mother perceived grandfather and\ngrandmother social support more than daily routine states in\ntheir diary. Their presence was especially identified in the\nItalian group in line with Balsamo (2003). In general,\nEcuadorian mothers could not count on their own parents'\nsupport because they lived in their country of origin; there-\nfore, these mothers relied more on brothers, brothers-in-law,\nand friends, who were considered an additional source of\nhelp and support and were usually compatriots, as was found\nin previous studies (Chelpi-den Hamer, 2008). Nevertheless,\none Ecuadorian participant enjoyed the help of her own par-\nents because they lived near her family in the host country.\nGrandparents provide material and social support to their\nfamilies; they help to raise children and reduce the stress of\nthe work\u00adfamily balance (Colombo & Sciortino, 2008;\nGerard et al., 2006). In the literature, feeling balanced across\nwork and family life is important because it is related to\nmany well-being outcomes (Milkie, Kendig, Nomaguchi, &\nDenny, 2010). Beliefs and attitudes related to gender are an\nimportant factor in the analysis of the determinants of moth-\ners' and fathers' involvement in child care and housework\ntasks (Tognetti, 2011). This was demonstrated by husbands\nwith egalitarian beliefs who performed more housework than\ndid men with a traditional view of gender roles (Bulanda,\nIt is worth noting that the activities in which the mother\nfeels supported by the partner were not always undertaken\nexclusively by the partner; indeed, the fathers were not\nincluded in completing the diary entries. When the husbands\nhelped, it was not part of their own daily tasks but concerned\nroutines that the spouses did together, and in some cases, the\nhusband replaced the spouse if she was occupied at that\nmoment, as was found by Kroska (2004). Despite the percep-\ntion of receiving support from their husbands, most mothers\nin both groups reported feeling overloaded because of the\ndifferent roles they filled every day (Higgins et al., 2010); the\nmothers also referred to the little time they had to devote to\nthemselves and as couples (Carnielli Howat-Rodrigues,\nSuemi Tokumaru, Novaes de Amorim, Garcia, & Izar, 2013).\nThisresearchthusindicates,forbothItaliansandEcuadorians,\na mixed model of managing family roles--against the tradi-\ntional family model--with an imbalance of care tasks being\nallocated to women but also more balanced child care.\nThe research also shows the dynamics of family relation-\nships in terms of gift debt recognition (Scabini & Cigoli,\n2012). Gift is seen as the expression of an act of trust that\ngives rise to tie; it, as the unconditional principle of exchange,\ncoexists with debt, which is the mirror opposite of giving,\nwhich involves an imbalance of parents toward their children.\nThe data in this study highlighted how the similarities between\nItalian and Ecuadorian families could be justified considering\nthat the two groups belong to Latino culture (Badillo, 2006)\nand also the permanence of Ecuadorians in Italy. Ecuadorians\ncan be considered culturally adapted according to the classic\ncultural adaptation model. Furthermore, cultural adaptation\ncould have resulted in Ecuadorians' assimilation into the host\ncommunity's way of life. However, this gives the risk of the\npartial loss of cultural identity, which was found in the family\nroutines and practices that were common to the two groups\nand that emerged in this research.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThis work focused on Ecuadorian immigrant women, but it\nwould be interesting to extend it to other cultural groups. In\naddition, this study is centered on women's experiences, by\nself-report techniques, and it would be interesting to extend\nit to investigating the opinions of male figures about life in\nItaly and the previous and present habits of immigrant\nfathers. Furthermore, the possibility to implement the par-\nticipants should be enhancing the generalization of findings.\nAn additional suggestion for future research, given that the\nparticipants in this work had lived in Italy for many years,\nwould be to investigate a group of Ecuadorian mothers who\nhad only lived in Italy for a short time. Finally, considering\nhow integration emerged regarding languages, food, and\nreligion--typical elements of ethnic identity for foreign\nparticipants--it would be interesting to investigate these\naspects of immigrant families' previous lives in their origin\ncountries. Furthermore, future research could be designed\nwith participant observations, to focus on practiced family\nrather than only on represented one.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlby, F., & Di Pede, S.
