Using the same\nangiographic equipment for diagnostic and\ntherapeutic purposes could eliminate the\nconsiderable time expended to transport\npatients between imaging modalities.\nAlthough requiring substantial volumes of\ncontrast medium (CM), FD-PBV imaging is\nthe approach best suited for patients with\nacute ischemic stroke.\nCT perfusion (CTP) imaging--one of\nthe techniques widely applied to assess per-\nfusion abnormalities of patients with acute\nstroke--is expected to improve patient out-\ncomes using thrombolysis. CTP has certain\nadvantages over MR perfusion, although\nSasaki et al.11 reported that radiation expos-\nure during CTP may be unexpectedly high.\nTherefore, low-dose protocols with de-\nnoising techniques are essential to maintain\nthe radiation dose at <200 mGy. The quan-\ntitative characteristics of CTP data, how-\never, are unreliable. Man et al.12 compared\nPCT and MRI perfusion and found that the\nmean transfer time and CBF values are\naffected by the deconvolution method used\n(p < 0.05), whereas CBV values remain\nunchanged. When applying these various\nthresholds, however, the predicted ischemic\ncore and penumbra were similar with the\ntwo methods. Thus, the predicted ischemic\ncore and penumbra are similar with these\nmethods when using different thresholds,\nspecific for each deconvolution method.\nThe aim of this study was to determine\na concentration of intra-arterial injectable\nCM optimal for quantifying FD-PBV\nimages, thereby reducing overall CM usage.\nMaterials and methods\nPatients\na total of 10 patients (9 women, 1 man) with\nyears) qualified for this retrospectively\nstudy as each had a single unruptured\naneurysm (average diameter, 5.7 mm,\nrange, 3\u00ad12 mm). Two of the aneurysms\nwere atop the basilar artery (BA-Top), six\ninvolved the internal carotid\u00adposterior com-\nmunicating artery (IC-PCA), one was at the\nmiddle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation,\nand one affected the anterior communicat-\ning artery (ACA) (Table 1). Patients were\nscheduled for FD-PBV and MRI perfusion\nstudies within <24 h after granting informed\nconsent. Measuring the perfusion with MRI\nis a morphological evaluation that provides\nfunctional information and improves the\ndiagnostic ability and treatment orientation.\nThis study was compliant with the Health\nInsurance Portability and Accountability\nAct. Our institutional ethics committee\napproved the study prior to initiating data\ncollection. The study was performed accord-\ning to the guidelines of our facility.\nContrast value for comparison of right\u00adleft\ncommon carotid artery\nFD-PBV acquisitions were obtained via a\nsystem (Artis zee BA Twin; Siemens AG\nHealthcare, Erlangen, Germany). The\nC-arm set gained upfront entry to the right\nand left common carotid arteries (CCAs)\nand the heart. The lateral C-arm set centered\non the whole skull, with the pig-tail catheter\ntip placed at the aortic valve. We positioned\nthe catheter at the ascending aorta and\nstarted the native run, after which the\nbolus-watching angiogram (as described in\nreference 10) and the injection of contrast\nmedium were initiated simultaneously.\nWhen the veins and sinus were visible, we\nstarted the full run. The contrast values for\ncomparing the right\u00adleft CCAs involved\ntwo-dimensional digital subtraction angiog-\nraphy (2D-DSA), using a power injector\n(Press Pro; Nemoto Co, Tokyo, Japan), and\narranging the FD-PBV time delay. Injector\ninfusion conditions included a diluted CM\nvolume of 12 mL, a radiographic delay time\nof 0 sec, and a 6.0-mL/sec injection rate.\nThe CM (Iopamidol 300; Bayer HealthCare,\nOsaka, Japan) of choice was diluted to 28%,\nmeaning that there were mixtures of 3.36\nContrast values for the right and left\nCCAs were measured five times, based on a\ncircular region of interest (ROI), and\nexpressed as the mean \u00c6 standard deviation\n(SD). We determined the ratios of the right\nand left CCA contrast values at the various\nCM dilutions. In addition, we determined\nthe duration of scan delay according to the\ncontrast values, including the time to the\ntransverse sinus (TS), using color-coded\nDSA imaging13 (iFlow software: syngo X\nWorkplace, Siemens AG Healthcare).\nFD-PBV quantitation\nFD-PBV was generated from 400 radio-\ngraphic images with a 5122 matrix (pixel\nsize 0.15 mm2) obtained during rotation of\nthe X-ray source approximately 200 within\n6 sec. Data sets were transferred to a com-\nmercially available workstation (syngo\nX Workplace, Siemens AG Healthcare) for\npost-processing. The proprietary software\nincluded smoothing algorithms:14,15 bin-\nning, 4 \u00c2 4; kernel, smooth.

For PBV image process-\ning,16 the subtracted data were normalized\nwith an input function automatically esti-\nmated from the histographic analysis of\nthe vascular tree. We then performed\ncolor-coding with a standard color table to\ngenerate the PBV color-coded maps for\nvisualization and interpretation. The PBV\nvalues are expressed in units of ml/1000 ml\nof cerebral tissue. PBV values for the ROI\nanalysis were converted to more commonly\nused units of ml/100 g using a simple con-\nversion factor that takes into account the\ncerebral tissue density (1.05 g/ml).\nMR-CBV quantitation\nMRI perfusion was performed in the trans-\nverse plane by gradient-echo sequences using\na 1.5-T MRI scanner (Signa; GE Medical\nSystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) with echo\nplanar sequence parameters as follows: TR/\nsignal bandwidth, 1470Hz/pixel. Prior to\nscanning, an 18-gauge intravenous catheter\nwas placed at the antecubital fossa for con-\ntrast administration. Imaging took place\nduring the first pass of a standard bolus\ndose (0.1mmol/kg) of gadopentetate dime-\nglumine (Eisai Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), with\nMRI perfusion images acquired at 1-sec\nintervals. Then, 13mL was injected at\n3.0 mL/sec and flushed with 30mL of saline\nvia an MRI-compatible power injector\n(SONIC SHOT50; Nemoto Kyorindo Co\nLtd, Tokyo, Japan).\nPost-processing for MR-CBV image cal-\nculations was performed with a Perfusion\nMismatch Analyzer17 devised by the Acute\nStroke Imaging Standardization Group\u00ad\nJapan. The arterial input function to decon-\nvolve the dynamic tissue response curve was\ndetermined automatically. Semi-quantitative\noutput perfusion maps of the cerebral blood\nvolume (CBV) were obtained for clinical\ninterpretation. Three ROIs (ACA, MCA,\nposterior cerebral artery (PCA) territories)\nwere assessed by the workstation or by\nperfusion mismatch analysis (PMA) in each\nhemisphere to include all tissues and vessels.\nIt covered the same proportion of gray/white\nmatter for both a normal CBV range and that\nof the threshold of an infarct.

When laterality was\nnot present, the CM volume was circulated\nequivalently in the right\u00adleft brain. The\nsymmetrical appearance of the CM is\nshown in Figure 1.\nRoyalty et al.6 described use of a 60%\nCM dilution injected intravenously at\n3.5 mL/sec, although an 8-sec radiographic\ndelay proved excessive. There was already\nsignificant enhancement of the basilar artery\nat the time of the initial image acquisition in\nthis canine study. In a clinical study, Lin\net al.10 also used a 60% CM dilution given\nvia an arterial injection at 1.5 mL/sec.\nThe time to maximum opacification of the\nsuperior sagittal sinus in 34 patients was\n6.0 \u00c6 2.1 sec. In our cohort, intra-arterial\ninjection of diluted CM at 6 mL/sec required\nopacification of the superior sagittal sinus,\nand the related standard deviation was less\nthan that cited by Lin et al.10. The time\nrequired for the superior sagittal sinus to\nreach full opacity might vary according to\nthe total amount used, the dilution of the\nCM administered, and the positioning of\nthe angiographic catheters. Thus, we antici-\npate that a 9-sec radiographic delay would\nallow sufficient whole-brain dissemination\nof CM (Figure 1).\nRegarding the injection rate, Rumberger\net al.19 investigated varying intravenous\ninjections to determine whether faster injec-\ntion was preferable for a set volume of CM\nand whether diluted CM, injected at an\nFigure 3.

In a study of\nswine, Ganguly7 determined that a higher\nintra-arterial injection rate produced better\nresults, presumably due to better flow and\nimproved mixing of CM in the carotid\narteries and less loss of iodinated contrast\nin subclavian arteries at the higher flow\nrates, which at most were 4-6 mL/sec.

Thus, a laterality differential of the CBV was not seen for either cerebral\nhemisphere, as shown in Figure 1.

To compare FD-PBV with MR-CBV could enable a\nrelatively fixed-quantity evaluation.\nAbbreviations: CBV, cerebral blood volume; FD, flat-panel detector; PBV, parenchymal blood volume; RGB,\nred/green/blue\nthe relations are marginal. Greater clarity\nmay be achieved by enlisting a larger patient\npopulation (e.g., !30 subjects). Lin et al.13\nreported that the ability to measure CBV in\nthe angiography suite facilitated the follow-\ning situations: (1) when there is a significant\ndelay between the diagnosis and the begin-\nning of the endovascular procedure; (2) if a\nprocedure has been too long or unsuccessful,\nthe operator can assess the evolution of the\ninfarct core; (3) being able to identify\nthe prognostic factors and rule out hemor-\nrhage immediately after finishing the pro-\ncedure. If we want to use this new imaging\nmodality as a first-line tool, we should use\na pig-tail catheter (which is potentially dan-\ngerous) instead of an intravenous approach,\nwhich is minimally invasive. Measurement\nof the CBV and cerebral flow in an angiog-\nraphy room might be a useful tool for\nemergency cases, such as a patient with\nacute stroke.\nReducing the amount of CM in both\ndiagnostic and interventional procedures is\nan important issue, especially for elderly\npatients. FD-PBV affords easy laterality\nof imaging,5\u00ad8 depending on the position of\nthe catheter and acquisition timing, among\nother factors. The contrast values of the\nright\u00adleft CCA may be symmetrical using\nCM at low concentrations and a high injec-\ntion rate. At our facility, we always\nhave CM (100 mL) ready when DSA for\ncerebral endovascular treatment is sched-\nuled. Should the patient suffer a cerebral\nevent or need an FD-PBV study, CM may\nbe added. FD-PBV imaging enables evalu-\nation of both the physiological and cerebral\nperfusion states of patients in the angiog-\nraphy suite before, during, and after thera-\npeutic interventions.\nAll color maps17 delineating FD-PBV\nand MRI-CBV were based on default ran-\nges--whether software- or PMA-generated.\nIn Figure 3, FD-PBV images at 16% CM\ndilution showed an increase in the red ratios\nand a decrease in blue ratios, with the green\nratio unchanged. Compared with its 20%\ncounterpart, the 16% CM dilution was\ninadequate for color-scale depiction of FD-\nPBV. In Figure 2, if we think in images ``G'',\n``H'', ``I'', and ``J'', only image noise is\nvisible--nothing else. Thus, the color ana-\nlyzed showed a different malignancy at\n!20% CM concentration. In the future, we\nbelieve that this application will be devel-\noped so that MR-perfusion-CBV and CT-\nperfusion-CBV are equivalent.\nRoyalty et al.6 obtained qualitative and\nquantitative measurements of CBF and\nCBV via C-arm CT acquisition, injecting\ngraphic delay time was detailed, and CM\nwas simply flushed by the saline. Cigarroa\net al.,20 however, determined an upper limit\nfor CM volume based on the following\nformula,21 to preclude a high incidence of\nnephropathy:\nCM limit \u00bc\n5 mL contrast=kg body weight\n\u00f0 \u00de\n \nserum creatinine mg=dL\n\u00f0 \u00de\nThus, we must reduce the CM volume\nduring cerebral endovascular treatments.\nLimitations\nLimitations of this study include a small\npatient group, so the outcomes are useful\nonly as a reference for initial comparisons.\nIn addition, although this study concluded\nthat a CM dilution to 20% resulted in no\nlaterality differential of FD-PBV imaging,\nwith left\u00adright quantitative ratios approach-\ning values of 1:1, we did not compare the\nasymmetry in the PBV images--only the\nCM ratio at the CCA. Therefore, it is\ndifficult to reach conclusions. We also used\nMR perfusion imaging as a control, which\nvaries among individuals and is affected by\nseveral factors. Higher correlation with the\nMR-CBV image does not mean it is better.\nFinally, it has become increasingly evident\nthat color mapping is of limited value as a\nresearch tool.\nConclusions\nWe investigated serial reductions in CM\nconcentrations for use in FD-PBV imaging.\nThe most important goal is not to create an\nasymmetrical image. At 20% CM dilution,\nno imaging laterality differential was\nobserved, with the left\u00adright quantitative\nratio approaching 1:1. Therefore, this study\nmay support a reduction of CM if the results\ncan clearly show that the doses are optimal.\nDisclaimers\nThis study received no external funding.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nNotation of prior abstract publication/\npresentation\nAn abstract of this study was presented at the 31st\nJapanese Society for Neuro-endovascular Therapy,\nReferences\n1.
