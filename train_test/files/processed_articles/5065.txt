Angiotensin II (AngII)\nplasma levels are clearly involved in vascular endothe-\nlium alterations and atherogenesis, and contribute to the\nprogression of target organ damage.1\u00ad8 Drugs inhibit-\ning the RAAS, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme\ninhibitors (ACE-is) and angiotensin receptor blockers\n(ARBs), have been shown to be effective in reducing\nblood pressure (BP) and hypertension-associated tar-\nget organ damage,9 particularly heart failure (HF),10\u00ad12\ncoronary artery disease (CAD),13,14 left ventricular\nhypertrophy (LVH)15,16 and chronic kidney disease\nCombination therapy with aliskiren versus\nramipril or losartan added to conventional\ntherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes\nmellitus, uncontrolled hypertension and\nmicroalbuminuria\nEgidio Imbalzano1, Mirko Scarpelli1, Giuseppe Mandraffino1,\nMichele Creazzo1, Giuseppina Lizio1, Giovanni Trapani1, Giuseppe\nDattilo2, Andrea Dalbeni3, Carmelo Tomasello1, Maria Adriana\nSardo1 and Antonino Saitta1\n Keywords\nDirect renin inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, renin\u00adangiotensin\u00adaldosterone system, hypertension,\nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors\n1Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy, University of\nMessina, Italy\n2Department of Cardiology, University of Messina, Italy\n3Department of Internal Medicine, University of Verona, Italy\nCorresponding author:\nEgidio Imbalzano,Dipartimento di Medicina Interna eTerapia Medica,\nA.O.U.Policlinico G Martino \u00ad University of Messina,Messina,98100,Italy.\nEmail: eimbalzano@unime.it\nOriginal Article\n(CKD).17 A treatment that includes an ACE-i or an ARB\ncan contribute to cardiorenal protection effects; how-\never, these drugs act by blocking the RAAS at different\nlevels. In addition, they are not able to completely block\nRAAS activity because of the reactive rise in renin\nrelease induced by the withdrawal of the feedback inhi-\nbition exerted by AngII (the so-called short feedback\nloop), as evidenced by a reactive increase in plasma\nrenin activity (PRA), a well-established cardiovascular\nrisk marker,18 providing an incomplete cardiorenal\nThe central role of the RAAS in the pathogenesis of\ndiabetic nephropathy is accepted because several studies\nhave shown that ACE-is and ARBs can significantly\nreduce diabetic nephropathy.20\u00ad25 Blockade of the RAAS\nwith ACE-is or ARBs may be delayed; however, this delay\ndoes not avoid the progression of diabetic nephropathy\nade with ACE-is and ARBs offers no additional benefit in\npatients with hypertension as well as normal renal and left\nventricular function; indeed, PRA increases consistently\nwith the dual blockade.19 The ONTARGET study showed\nthat the combination of telmisartan and ramipril, despite\nreducing BP by a few millimetres of mercury more than\ntherapy with either ramipril or telmisartan, was associated\nwith more adverse events.28,29 More recently, a new anti-\nhypertensive class, the direct renin inhibitors (DRIs), was\nintroduced;30 In fact, renin is the first and primary enzyme\ninvolved in the RAAS cascade. Since the early 1980s, sev-\neral compounds have been synthesized to test the effects of\na blockade of renin enzyme activity (e.g. enalkiren,\nramikiren and zankiren). However, none of these reached\nthe clinical arena, because of their low inhibiting activity,\nlack of oral bioavailability and short half-life. Aliskiren\n(Novartis) is the first DRI suitable for oral administration,\nerful renin inhibitor which is highly specific for human\nrenin. It inhibits the enzyme activity of renin at the onset of\nthe conversion cascade of the RAAS, thus avoiding the\nactivation of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I and con-\nsequently into AngII.31\nBy blocking the first and rate-limiting step in the\nRAAS, aliskiren reduces PRA by at least 70% and buffers\nthe compensatory increase in PRA observed with ACE-is\nand ARBs.19 The combination of a DRI and an ARB or an\nACE-i is an effective approach for lowering BP and avail-\nable data indicate that such combinations favourably affect\nproteinuria, left ventricular mass index and brain natriu-\nretic peptide levels in patients with albuminuria, LVH and\nFour different trials evaluated the potential cardiorenal\neffects of aliskiren on morbidity and mortality.33 One of\nthese, the ALTITUDE, was halted by the recommendation\nof its Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) because of a\nhigher event rate.34 The recently published ASTRONAUT\ntrial reported post-discharge mortality and HF\nreadmissions among patients with acute HF and reduced\nleft ventricular ejection fraction treated with aliskiren or\nplacebo in addition to standard therapy.35\nThe ATMOSPHERE trial is currently evaluating the\neffects of an additional treatment with aliskiren in patients\nwith chronic HF.36 The APOLLO trial (to date at phase 3)\nwill provide new information regarding the role of\naliskiren administered with or without additional therapy\nwith a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in\nelderly subjects (65 years) with systolic BP (SBP) from\nity of DRI to prevent major cardiovascular (CV) events,\nas well as its impact on global measures of physical, exec-\nutive and cognitive function (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:\nwhich subclass of patient will derive benefit from the com-\nbination therapy of aliskiren with an ACE-i or an ARB.\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact\non BP and on urinary albumin excretion of a dual RAAS\nblockade strategy in hypertensive patients with type 2 dia-\nbetes mellitus (T2DM), impaired renal function (IRF),\nmicroalbuminuria (MA) and uncontrolled hypertension,\ndespite the administration of an optimal antihypertensive\ntherapy, already including an ACE-i or an ARB; the study\ndesign included the addition of aliskiren to a conventional\ntherapy with an ACE-I or an ARB, compared with the addi-\ntion of ramipril or losartan to a therapy already including an\nARB or anACE-I, respectively. Furthermore, the short-term\nsafety of these dual blockade strategies was also evaluated.\nWe want to underline that our study was completed\nbefore Novartis announced the termination of the\nALTITUDE study due to the unexpected increased inci-\ndence of renal impairment, non-fatal stroke, hyperkalae-\nmia and hypotension. Moreover, the patients enrolled in\nthe ALTITUDE study presented with adequate BP levels.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nat the Hypertension Care Centre of the University of\nMessina, Italy. Each patient underwent a complete history\nand physical examination, blood sampling for routine\nblood chemistry, 24 h urine collection (to measure creati-\nnine clearance and albumin excretion), electrocardiogra-\nphy and echocardiography. Patients with secondary\nhypertension, acute cardiovascular (myocardial infarction\n(AMI) or unstable angina) or cerebrovascular (transient\nischemic attack (TIA) or stroke) disease, which occurred\nwithin the previous 12 months, were excluded from the\nstudy. We also excluded patients with left ventricular dys-\nfunction (ejection fraction 40%), creatinine clearance\nmEq/l. Glycosylated haemoglobin was also assessed.\n958 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nWe included 126 hypertensive patients (65 males and\nand MA, defined as urinary albumin excretion 30 mg/24h\nAll patients included in the study were receiving the\nmaximum tolerated dosage of any ACE-i or any ARB for\nat least six months before inclusion. During the study\nperiod, the subjects were allowed to continue their previ-\nous pharmacological treatment with their antihypertensive\ndrugs, eventually including diuretics, -blockers, CCBs, or\nany other antihypertensive drug, without dose adjustment.\nBiometric parameters, including weight and height, were\nmeasured in the morning under fasting conditions; accord-\ningly, the body mass index (BMI) was estimated. All\npatients provided written informed consent, and the study\nprotocol was approved by local ethical review boards. The\nstudy was conducted in accordance with good clinical\npractice and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki\n(2002) of the World Medical Association.\nStudy design\nThe aim of the study was to assess and compare the effi-\ncacy and safety of add-on therapy with aliskiren versus\nlosartan (ARB) or ramipril (ACE-i) in hypertensive\npatients with a very high cardiovascular risk profile, due to\nconcomitant presence of T2DM, IRF and uncontrolled\nhypertension, despite the current administration of optimal\nantihypertensive therapy, which includedACE-is orARBs.\nSee Figure 1. Patients were randomly assigned to receive\n24 weeks of treatment with aliskiren (Group A; 63\npatients), or losartan or ramipril (Group B; 63 patients),\naccording to whether a patient was already receiving treat-\nment with an ACE-i or an ARB, respectively. In Group A,\nwe added aliskiren 150 mg to the previous therapy (T0),\nwhile in Group B we added ramipril 5 mg or losartan 50\nmg. Drug up-titration was mandatory for SBP or diastolic\nand losartan from 50 to 100 mg; no further dose adjust-\nments were allowed until the end of the observation period.\nIf the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by CrCl\ndecreased by more than 30% from baseline within four\nweeks after initiation of aliskiren, we would have decreased\nor discontinued ACE-i or an ARB.38 The dosage of oral\nantidiabetic drugs or insulin was adjusted as needed. BP\nvalues, MA, CrCl and clinical chemistry were evaluated at\nBlood pressure measurement\nClinical BP measurement was performed at our hospital in\nsupine position after at least 10 min of rest. Three measure-\nments were performed with a mercury sphygmomanometer\nand averaged, according to current recommendations.38\nEvaluation of CrCl and albuminuria\nEach enrolled patient underwent a 24 h urine collection to\nevaluate CrCl and MA. CrCl was calculated according to\nthe standard formula: (urinary creatinine \u00d7 24h urinary\nvolume)/(serum creatinine \u00d7 1440); MA was evaluated by\nstandard immunoturbidimetric assay.\nStatistical analysis\nThe Kolmogorov Smirnov test verified that several varia-\nbles had a non-normal distribution; consequently, given\nalso the relatively small size of our sample, we chose a\npermutation test-based analysis. This subset of non-\nparametric statistics, widely used in biomedical research,\nis considered preferable to the classic non-parametric\napproach39 since it is based on more realistic foundations;\nfurthermore, it is intrinsically robust and the resulting\ninferences are credible because they estimate the entire\ndata distribution and exploit all information contained in\nthe sample.40 Accordingly, data were expressed as mean \u00b1\nstandard deviation (SD). Comparisons were conducted\nFigure 1. Study design.\nwith the Nonparametric Combination test (NPC-test),\nwhich is based on a simulation or resampling procedure\nthat is conditionally dependent on the data; thus, it pro-\nvides a simulated estimate of the permutation distribution\nMoreover, in order to verify the results obtained with\nthis approach, we integrated the statistical analysis with a\ntraditional non-parametric approach (median and IQR);\nconsequently, the comparisons between the variables were\nconducted with the Mann\u00adWhitney U test. Comparisons\nbetween different observation times were carried out with\nthe Wilcoxon test. The correlations among the variables\nwere assessed with Spearman's test. To perform the statis-\ntical analyses, we used the SPSS statistical package (SPSS\nV. 17.0, Chicago, IL), and the NPC test 2.0 (Statistical\nsoftware for multivariate permutation tests; Methodologica\nsrl, Treviso).\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nTable 1 presents the characteristics of the study population\nat baseline.

None of these patients were discontinued from\nthe trial because of hyperkalaemia, or an increase in base-\nline plasma creatinine > 30%. Furthermore, our study\nshowed that the addition of aliskiren to a previous conven-\ntional antihypertensive treatment that included a RAAS\nantagonist, either an ACE-i or an ARB, had a greater effect\nin reducing SBP than the addition of either ACE-i or ARB;\nfurther reduction of SBP by approximately 4 mmHg was\nfound with the former regimen.\nNo difference was observed in DBP reduction between\nthe two groups.\nFigure 2.

In this study\naliskiren showed higher SBP reduction with ramipril.\nMoreover, when used in combination with ramipril,\naliskiren provided a significant additional reduction in both\nSBP and DBP. Another eight-week, randomized, controlled\ntrial42 compared valsartan, aliskiren and their combination\nmoderate hypertension. This study showed that the combi-\nnation of aliskiren and valsartan at maximum recommended\ndosages provides greater reduction in BP values compared\nwith monotherapy with valsartan or aliskiren alone.\nWe must stress that these results were obtained in a\nclinical setting of mild to moderate residual hypertension\nin T2DM patients, where a significant degree of pressure\nreduction is hard to achieve, especially in a limited time-\nframe. A recent 24-week, open-label, single-arm study\nshowed that the combination therapy of aliskiren and a\nRAAS blocker in CKD patients who were already being\ntreated with ACE-is or ARBs for more than six months had\na favorable effect on reducing residual proteinuria and BP\nreduction.44 Another recent study43 confirmed the efficacy\nand safety of aliskiren in a real-life setting. Aliskiren is\napproved for treatment of hypertension, but has also shown\nrenoprotective potential in normotensive patients with\nstudy were receiving the maximum dosage of an ACE-i or\nARB for at least six months before inclusion. To date, this\nis the optimal treatment to reduce albuminuria and delay\nthe progression of CKD.38 After 24 weeks we observed a\nsignificant reduction of urinary albumin levels in both\ngroups. In GroupA, we observed a higher reduction of MA\nthermore, in both study groups we observed, after an initial\ndecrease at four weeks, a significant improvement of GFR\nestimated with CrCl at 24 weeks with respect to baseline\n0.001); however, no difference was detected in CrCl vari-\nation between the two groups. Adjunctive therapy with\naliskiren appeared to provide a more beneficial improve-\nment of diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive patients, as\nmarked by urinary albumin excretion, compared with\nother treatment protocols that are considered to be the gold\nstandard.38 The renal protective effects of aliskiren could\nbe related to its organ-specific mechanism of action.18 A\ndirect renin inhibition with aliskiren provides a greater\nintrarenal protective effect than other RAAS antagonists.47\nThe results of our study show that the multi-level blockade\nof the RAAS represents a good therapeutic strategy, and\nconfirms the efficacy and safety of aliskiren. These results\nare consistent with those of other and larger randomized\nclinical trials. The AVOID study recruited 599 patients\nwith hypertension, T2DM and proteinuria who were\nalready receiving the maximum recommended renoprotec-\ntive treatment with losartan (100 mg daily) and exhibited\nan optimal management of hypertension; enrolled patients\nwere randomized to receive adjunctive treatment with\naliskiren (300 mg daily) or placebo. In the group treated\nwith aliskiren, a significant reduction of albuminuria,\ncompared with placebo, was observed. This benefit\nappeared to be independent of systemic BP reduction.24\nAdjunctive therapy with aliskiren appears to be a unique\nopportunity for patients at high cardiovascular risk. These\npatients usually show a poor response to conventional anti-\nhypertensive treatment. It is likely that the double block-\nade of RAAS with DRI and an ACE-i or an ARB can help\nus to better understand the pathogenesis of hypertension. If\nso, it would provide a more effective therapeutic strategy\nin preventing hypertension-related diseases; consequently,\nit would delay the progression towards the end-organ dam-\nage. More long-term data are needed to confirm the effi-\ncacy and safety of this regimen in these patient populations.\nThe ASPIRE HIGHER programme was undertaken to\nevaluate potential cardiorenal effects of aliskiren over a\nspectrum of conditions in 14 different studies involving\n(AVOID, ALLAY and ALOFT) evaluated surrogate end-\npoints and confirmed the favourable effects of adding\naliskiren to standard treatment. The ASPIRE HIGHER\nprogramme also included four morbidity and mortality tri-\nals.33 One of these, the ALTITUDE, was halted by a rec-\nommendation from its DMC.34 The basis of the DMC\nrecommendation was futility (i.e. no prospect of demon-\nstrating the treatment benefit anticipated in the protocol),\nas well as safety concerns. These concerns included renal\ndysfunction and hyperkalaemia. Doubling of serum creati-\nnine occurred in 4.8% of the aliskiren group vs. 5% of the\nplacebo group (p= NS). ESRD or renal death occurred in\n2.8% of the aliskiren group vs. 2.5% of the placebo group\n(p= NS). Hyperkalaemia occurred in 39% of the aliskiren\ngroup vs. 29% of the placebo group, and severe hyper-\nkalaemia was observed in 21% vs. 16%. It was assessed\nthat there were no cases where the increase in potassium\nneeded dialysis, but there was one case where raised potas-\nsium levels were specified as the cause of death. Other\nmain concerns were hypotension and an excess of non-\nfatal strokes. In response to these findings, it has been rec-\nommended that dual aliskiren and ACE-i/ARB therapy not\nbe used in patients with both hypertension (the current\nindication for aliskiren) and diabetes or moderate to severe\nrenal dysfunction. The recently-published ASTRONAUT\ntrial35 reported that the addition of aliskiren to standard\ntherapy in patients with acute HF and reduced left ven-\ntricular ejection fraction (LVEF) appeared to improve\npost-discharge outcomes and biomarker profiles; it was\ngenerally well-tolerated in non-diabetic patients. In con-\ntrast, diabetic patients receiving aliskiren appeared to have\npoorer post-discharge outcomes.\nThe ATMOSPHERE trial is currently being conducted\non patients with chronic HF.36,48 We want to stress that, in\nthe population enrolled in ALTITUDE, BP was well-\ncontrolled at baseline, and patients were randomized to\nreceive aliskiren 150 mg or placebo in addition to their\nconventional treatment (including a maximum dose of\nACE-i orARB).After four weeks of treatment, the patients\nwere force-titrated to receive aliskiren 300 mg. In contrast,\nall of the patients enrolled in our study had poor BP control\nat baseline, and aliskiren was up-titrated to 300 mg only if\nthe BP target was not achieved at the fourth week. This\nstudy design allowed a low dropout rate and a lower inci-\ndence of side effects compared with other studies.\nFurther larger clinical studies are ongoing, and they\nmay add further insight regarding aliskiren safety and effi-\ncacy; furthermore, they may increase understanding\nregarding the mechanisms underlying its cardiorenal pro-\ntective potential. The APOLLO Trial should provide new\ninformation regarding the role of aliskiren (with or without\nadditional therapy with a diuretic or a CCB) in elderly sub-\ning major CV events and on global measures of physical,\nexecutive and cognitive function (ClinicalTrials.gov iden-\nanalysis of ALTITUDE, and the outcomes of the other\nlong-term studies (ATMOSPHERE, ASTRONAUT and\nAPOLLO) will help us to identify the subgroup of patients\nthat could obtain an advantage from dual RAAS blockade\nwith DRI and ACE-I or ARB.\nStudy limitations\nThe major limitation of our study is the small sample size\nthat limits our ability to determine statistical significance.\nConclusions\nThe addition of aliskiren to the standard therapy provides\ngreater reduction of BP and urinary albumin excretion than\nadding an ACE-i (ramipril) to an ARB and vice versa\n(losartan to ACE-i). The dual blockade of RAAS can be\nassociated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia com-\npared with monotherapy; therefore, we recommend that\nthis therapeutic strategy requires closer monitoring of\nrenal function and serum potassium levels.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors\nReferences\n1.
