    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe paper presents my first findings and reflections on how ordinary people may opportunistically and unpredictably\nrespond to Internet censorship and tracking. I try to capture this process with the concept of `hacking multitude'.\nWorking on a case study of the Turkish government's block of the social media platform Twitter (March 2014), I argue\nthat during systemic data choke-points, a multitude of users might acquire a certain degree of reflexivity over ubiquitous\nsoftware of advanced techno-capitalism. Resisting nai\n\u00a8ve parallels between urban streets and virtual global streets, the\narticle draws on Fuller's `media ecologies' to make sense of complex and dynamic interactions between processes and\nmaterialities, strategies of communication and mundane practices. Such a dense space is mostly invisible to network and\ntraffic analysis, although it comes alive under the magnifying lens of digital ethnography. As the Turkish government tried\nto stop protesters on both the urban and the Twitter spheres, alternative material configurations and new hybrid\nformations and practices emerged. I try to bring this process alive following the traces \u00ad that is, a combination of digital\ndata and materialities \u00ad of a social space between the protest for Twitter access, the `digital coup' and the interactions\nthat this situation determined. In the final section, I briefly explore two research trajectories which can further develop\nmy initial formulation of a `hacking multitude'. I argue that a generalisation of hacking/multitude is problematic for the\npolitical, cultural or economic processes more directly associated with Big Data.\n",

(Jon Gilmore, founder of the Electronic\nFrontier Foundation)\nCon-text\nTen days before Turkish local elections, on 20 March\n2014, PM Tayyip Erdogan blocked access to Twitter:\nallegations of Erdogan's corruption had circulated on\nthe social media platform, receiving little notice outside\nTurkey. This dramatically changed when they eventu-\nally tried to stop people from tweeting altogether. Mr\nErdogan firstly deployed a well-known discourse\naround social media as `bad', since they can corrupt\npeople's morality.1 This is a strategy of placing media\noutside the sacred sphere: social media in particular,\nwith their inherently global audience, resemble a for-\neign invasion tearing apart the fabric of society.2\nThe blockage on Twitter began [at] circa 11 pm. All of a\nsudden users started to talk about how some of their\nfriends couldn't log in on Twitter. After a couple [of]\nhours I also couldn't log in, so I followed the news on\nmy Facebook timeline. (Online interview)\nGoldsmiths, CUCR, University of London, London, UK\nCorresponding author:\nPaolo Cardullo, Goldsmiths, CUCR, University of London, Laurie Grove\nEmail: p.cardullo@gold.ac.uk\nBig Data & Society\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution\nof the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (http://www.uk.\nsagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\nDespite the block imposed on Twitter, hashtags con-\ncerning Turkey censorship started to trend from the\nnext day, so attracting more users: tweets and\nunblocked social media increasingly showcased alterna-\ntive workarounds, initiating a `hacking game' which\nI follow below.\nThe paper narrates this Internet censorship attempt\nand its circumvention, following two main leads.\nDrawing from diverse data points, I first suggest that\nthe combination of denial of service, social media prac-\ntices and hackers' intervention started a learning curve\nin people being affected by the ban. A certain degree of\nusers' reflexivity and the resulting repository of techno-\nlogical expertise are crucial to the workings of a\n`hacking multitude'. In the first instance, `multitude' is\nintended as a mass of ordinary Internet users whose\ndaily media practices, opportunistically and unpredict-\nably, are means of digital and informational production\nThe second reflection this paper wants to start is\naround the implications that a potential generalization\nof hacking practices might have for the political, cul-\ntural or economic processes more directly associated\nwith Big Data. My initial findings show that new\nsocial and material assemblages started producing\ndata over and beyond Twitter. I will foreground traces\nof this generative social space which, I contend, is made\ninvisible in the Big Data flow.\nIn order to grasp the complexity of this emerging\nmedia system, which has not a single entity responsible\nfor it nor is it simply imposed from above, I draw on\nFuller's reworking of the term `ecology': a `massive and\ndynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings\nand things, patterns and matter' (Fuller, 2005: 2). To\nunderstand the multi-layered, non-linear, unfolding of\nmedia ecologies, Fuller suggests attending to the live-\nness of the event, to participate in the interactions of\nthese systems `with no control sample'. Partly, the\nevents narrated here are an attempt to bring this pro-\ncess alive. The story unfolds using tweets and photo-\ngraphs as they became available on Twitter during a\nmassive stand against censorship, which I followed\nthroughout. My narrative juxtaposes moments of med-\niatic synthesis, made of Big Data configurations, and\nsome `basic practices of how people construct the social\ntices are generally hidden in aggregate statistics, but\nthey become more intense under the magnifying lens\nof digital ethnography.\nIn the second part of the paper, I integrate online\ndata with online interviews of Turkish Twitter users.\nI haven't been directly involved in the observation of\nthe Turkish protests from the streets.3 However, I man-\naged to reach some protagonists of the events I narrate,\nthanks to intense snowballing, following and\nnegotiations on the terms of our online interaction\n(e.g. encrypted conversations), through specific mailing\nlists, social media and forums. These interviews there-\nfore contain for me a wealth of details and perspectives\nfrom the `field'.4\nIn the end, I develop the concept of a `hacking multi-\ntude'. I argue that basic practices of hackerdom and\ntheir potential recurrence in the economies of digital\ninformation can become, at least temporarily, crucial\nelements in the architecture of the Internet. Ultimately,\nthey can change the morphology of data itself. In so\ndoing, a social process of collaboration, learning and\nreflexivity starts appearing, at least with regard to con-\ntestation of Internet access.\nThis article focuses on Turkey because, differently\nfrom many other countries that experienced the so-\ncalled `Web 2.0 Revolutions', it has a potential critical\nmass of users where digital devices and social media\nplatforms are part of many people's everyday life.\nTurkey ranks 4th in number of Facebook members\nand 11th in terms of Twitter users: the exponential\nincrease in social media users is also due to traditional\nmedia being heavily centralised and censored (Furman,\nforthcoming). Twitter became popular in Turkey on the\nwave of #OccupyGeziPark uprising:\nTV and other media did not cover the events: mobile\nphones became the TV, photos were published on\nTwitter and other websites. Citizen journalism became\nthe de facto news agency for all. (Online interview)\nMuch has been written on the connections between\nsocial media and recent street protests. Castells suggests\nthat the Internet creates protests. Speaking about a trad-\nition of `techno-euphoria and techno-determinism'\n(Fuchs, 2013), he argues that the Internet is `a necessary\nthough not sufficient component. . . decisive to social\nsome see an instrument essential for designing the chore-\nography of the assembly during street protests\n(Gerbaudo, 2012), and generally being an effective mega-\nphone (Murthy, 2013). Developing a politics of presence\nmarginal groups `the physical space of the city is no\nlonger enough. The urban street is revived and extended\nto the global mediated street'. A large-scale research on\nthe 2011 London riots, `Reading the Riots', however,\nfound that there was no significant evidence of Twitter\nbeing central to the organisation of the riots. Despite the\nmoral panic around social media that the events\nsparked, their analysis of over 2.5 million tweets shows\nthat the popular platform was rather used to organise\npost-riot clean-up operations.5 Social media are not the\n`mirror of the power structures we find in society'.\n2 Big Data & Society\nAn evaluation of the effects of digital insurgency on\nthe Turkish political landscape is beyond the scope of\nthis paper. There are, however, some open questions,\nparticularly during transformative moments, around\nhow data is made manifest to us and the processes\nthat make this data possible. How is the morphology\nof digital data being changed by the evolving political\nlandscape? To what extent can a generalised form of\ndigital disobedience effectively change the consistency\nand relevance of Big Data, such as Twitter traffic ana-\nlysis or grouping by hashtag? Moreover, what config-\nurations would users form in relation to their online\nprivacy and their right to use the Internet in a scenario\nof state surveillance? What kind of social alliances are\nforged during circumvention of Internet censorship?\nAccording to De Landa, our `mathematical technology'\nwas always incapable of modelling self-organising phe-\nnomena: `non-linearities were eliminated as much as\npossible from mathematical models, making non-\nlinear effects like chaos ``invisible''' (De Landa in\ndata points, such as tweets, photographs and inter-\nviews, rather allows the fine grain of a social process,\nwhich the very notion of `data flow' hides, to come\nalive.\nGovernments, such as Egypt, China or Pakistan,\ngenerally have had good or modest results in imple-\nits impact on protests is ultimately uncertain.\nCensorship attempts are incomplete and evolving too:\nin Turkey, for instance, tougher measures are now\nbeing introduced, involving controversial spying soft-\nware and more centralised administration of the\nInternet.6 There are more dedicated studies on this\nup governments' adoption of paid `trolls' in order to\nshift public opinion on social media.7 In my view, this is\na sign that censorship and filtering alone, although on a\nmassive scale, cannot address the full dynamism of\nmedia ecologies of digital communication.\nGovernments too need media practices, they need to\nplay on the same ground of, and in fact they hack,\nthe `hacking multitude'.\nMaterialities\nI will now start unfolding the ecology around the\n`digital coup'. This is made of institutional constraints,\nwhich I sketched in the introductory section, Big Data\nrepresentations, discussed in the next section, and mate-\nrialities. A focus on materialities \u00ad as both media prac-\ntices and physical infrastructures \u00ad not only\ndemonstrates that data does not simply flow at a\npush of a button but also shows how social space\ncomes alive in the choke-points of such a `flow'.\nInitially, the Twitter ban in Turkey was a simple\nblock at domain level. Domain Name Service (DNS)\nis a distributed and hierarchical system which trans-\nlates human readable hostnames (www.twitter.com)\ninto the numeric IP address required to resolve that\nphone book of the Internet, which indexes IP\naddresses for website. Unlike a phone book, DNS\ncan be quickly updated, allowing a service's location\non the network to change without affecting end users,\nwho continue to use the same host name. DNS is\norganised in a hierarchical fashion with 13 very power-\nful root name servers at the top level. `Copies' of these\nsuper-servers are distributed worldwide via a network\naddressing and routing methodology which sends\nrequests to the topologically nearest node in a group\nof potential receivers. This has accelerated a decentra-\nlised service, with the deployment of physical (rather\nthan logical) root-servers outside the US: for example,\nCardullo 3\nOpenDNS is a distributed service over geographically\ndispersed servers, claiming a `self-healing network\nacross three continents' (OpenDNS.com).\n`Self-healing' is a relevant concept here. If any regional\nserver is affected by outage or block, the whole traffic can\nbe re-routed to the nearest (physical) location. In this\nconfiguration, the Internet is typically represented as a\ncomplex `network of networks':\nThe block was simply directing users to a web page\nwhich said `Twitter is banned via jurisdiction', which\nwas not. Telecom companies adjusted their DNS ser-\nvers in order to advertise that page as Twitter. Many\npeople switched DNS servers. (Online interview)\nThis simple geopolitics of the Internet reminds us of\nCastells' vision. The network is seen from the perspec-\ntive of nodes and set in the context of online freedom\nfrom `attacks', malware software or censorships.\nHowever, Castells' configuration `leaves unresolved\nthe relative causal weight of everyday context versus\noperations of networks or people's positioning within\nMaterial practices and non-humans are constitutive\nparts of Internet ecologies. They produce digital data\nvia their relentless labour. They are the network too,\npart of the everyday context in which networks operate.\nI will discuss practices in the second part of the paper,\nwith lots of details and stories that came out from my\nonline interviews with some Turkish tweeps. Materials\nmake the main argument of this section: a physical\narchitecture of the Net starts to appear. This has been\nunveiled by the very block that meant to make it\nunavailable to the wider public in the first place.\nObservers' eyes were by now set on any statistical\nindicators that could capture what was going on in\nTurkey: How successful was the block? Did traffic\nreveal an adequate response from users?\nBig numbers\nI now discuss some metrics around the popularity of\nTwitter in Turkey and around Twitter hashtags that\nwere trending during the `digital coup'.9 I present\nbelow two groups of quantitative indicators, as they\nbecame available during the period of observation.\n1. Hours after the attempt at blocking Twitter, news\ngrew under the headline/hashtag: #Twitteris\nBlockedinTurkey, and similar. The infographic\nbelow was circulated over 4000 times (considering\nonly direct re-tweets) on the same day Occupy\nWall Street NYC produced it.\nPart of the online world seemed to identify them-\nselves with Twitter users being blocked in Turkey,\nwhile Turkish users became aware of being `trending'\non the platform. Infographics' powerful message is to\n4 Big Data & Society\nsample and aggregate large swathes of users and to\nmake representations speak for an imagined commu-\nnity of people. They are not just aesthetically appealing\nforms of visualisation of often dry data. Digital com-\nmunication fabricates data, but data enacts `people'. It\ncreates instances of ontological consistency of a subject\n(Ruppert, 2011). In this sense, hashtags are powerful\nforms of aggregation, although they are rather weak\nfor measuring belonging. The crucial thing is that\nTwitter transforms grouping by hashtags into `trends',\nby the way of publishing metrics on their popularity.\nTrend is per se a piece of information insomuch as it\ncirculates on more traditional media, which monitor\nTwitter metrics as an approximation of the interest in\na certain subject. Communication therefore becomes\ndata, which is turned into information: a circular repe-\ntition of the same.\n2. Traffic analysis from diverse sources suggested that\nrestrictions had failed to stop digital insurgency\nagainst censorship. Mikko Hypponen, Chief\nResearcher at F-Secure,10 shared a graph which\nshows an increase of 138% on the volume of\ntweets from Turkey in the immediate hours after\nthe ban: this is equivalent to `some 17,000 tweets\nLooking at some indirect indicators, there are rea-\nsons to believe that a vast part of the contribution to\nthe trend on the social platform was coming from\nTurkey itself. Twitter's popularity in Turkey is gener-\nally very high. Turkish is ranked as the eighth language\nspoken on the social media platform, accounting for\nthe 2% of all tweets exchanged globally (Leetaru\net al., 2013); the Turkish president, Abdullah Gul,\nwho famously tweeted after the ban imposed by his\ngovernment, is ranked third in the league of Twitter\nfollowers among world leaders (with a staggering\n4.2 million followers)12; with a percentage of Twitter\nusers higher than the US (79% vs. 73%), Turkish\ntweeps are at the top of the world chart.13\nDespite providing a useful entry point in the discus-\nsion of online censorship, traffic analysis does not\nreveal the complexities of how data is generated in\ntransformative moments. Big Data analysis gives the\nimpression that measures to circumvent the block had\nspread fast, reflecting a more generalised political\nopposition in Turkey. My contention is that new\nsocial and material assemblages were conditioning \u00ad\nand were in turn conditioned by \u00ad this new data flow,\nin a dialectical and non-linear manner. While the paper\ndoes not specifically investigate what this meant for\nTurkish society and its changing political landscape, it\nattempts to foreground traces of this generative social\nspace made invisible in aggregate analysis.\nSmall numbers\nIn order to capture this emerging process, we need to\nequip ourselves with other tools. I first build on my\ndirect engagement as an active tweep during the\nevents I narrate here. Drawing on the anthropological\nscholarship emerging in response to the Internet (Hine,\nwith discourse/content analysis of: tweets, photographs\ncirculated on the platform, and links included in tweets\n(few thousands overall). I then circulated my research\nblurb on mailing lists and social networks, managing to\ninterview some Turkish Twitter users who actively took\npart in the events.14 These interviews are therefore\ndirect accounts from the `field', the social space between\nthe Turkish block of Twitter and users' attempts to\ncircumvent such censorship.\n`Digital ethnography' is here intended as a method\nwith multiple data points to allow for immersion in\nCardullo 5\nthe experience of another culture (Underberg, 2013),\na protest culture in this case. Digital ethnographers'\ntoolkit to study the Internet evolves with every setting,\nkind of data, subject and site, as these become available\nor useful to her: `Unlike big data studies which often\naggregate data across single platforms, ethnography\ncan explore how events in one place are made meaning-\nful, in surprising and contingent ways, in another' (Hine,\n2013). While digital ethnography helps the researcher to\nconnect with the `field' under observation, sociological\ndiscourse analysis allows imagination and reciprocity\nbetween otherwise seemingly distinct realities, the vir-\ntual and the actual. Discourse analysis in digital ethnog-\nraphy explores the way in which accounts are made\nconvincing while maintaining the critical distance of\nthe ethnographer. At the same time, `the analyst presents\nherself as a competent cultural member', adding validity\nThe relation between what appears to happen online\n\u00ad increasingly conveyed by Big Data metrics (number\nof followers, friends, likes, shares, etc.) \u00ad and how social\nlife is constructed everyday \u00ad undeniable domain of\nethnographic tradition \u00ad is a tricky balance in digital\nethnography. It requires attending to both detailed\nonline observation and to the awareness that most of\nthis material is already present as digital data. In the\nnext section, I try to foreground the social space around\nthe Twitter ban. This `social' emerges in a contingent\nprocess of Internet surveillance from a nation state and\nspreads through streets and digital media, in the con-\ntext of daily engagement with communication technol-\nogy, production of digital data and political opposition.\nRe-text\nBy now, the problem became how to communicate\nalternative DNS numbers and instructions to Turkish\npeople who were unable to connect to Twitter in the\nfirst place.\nThe info [about DNS] was all over Facebook and even\nthe mainstream newspapers had articles that would give\nguidelines.\nThe word [about VPN] got around fast on the day\nTwitter was blocked. Facebook posts were already cir-\nculating beforehand.\nMy friends and colleagues asked me if I could access\nYouTube and/or Google, and also how to do it. I\nhelped them to change settings. The advice rapidly\nspread far and wide via friend-to-friend network.\nOne [of] my colleagues sent an email about a simple\nguide for using VPN and proxies. (Online interviews)\nThese extracts foreground a vernacular element of\nproximity in experiencing a global network: friends,\ncolleagues, word-of-mouth and face-to-face inter-\nactions. Importantly, workarounds were also repeated\non physical walls and other material objects. Their mes-\nsage was in the form of an alpha-numeric string, such as\nthe now ubiquitous 8.8.8.8, Google DNS sequence.\nGoogle DNS servers were written on walls and leaflets.\n(Online interview)\nQ: How wide spread was the attempt to reconnect to\nTwitter? A: It was very widespread, everyone wanted to\ndo it, even my mum. People were putting DNS num-\nbers on their windows. (Skype interview)\nThis is when part of Turkey seemed to familiarise them-\nselves with the rules of a game few had thought they\nneeded to play: only one of my interviewees had tried\nto circumvent censorship during a previous YouTube\nban. Crucially, they all say that they will definitely do\nthe same in future.\nPhotographs that circulated on Twitter help to\nrender this climate of growing awareness around\nInternet freedom.\nIt is a contention of visual sociology scholars that\nphotographs give texture to place and help to\nstrengthen arguments (Knowles and Sweetman, 2004).\nMaybe because they carry and reproduce a reservoir of\naffective responses (Terranova, 2004). They are com-\npressed, edited, aligned with text, they irremediably\nbecome `poor images': `The poor image is a copy in\nmotion. Its quality is bad, its resolution substandard.\nAs it accelerates, it deteriorates' (Steyerl, 2009). Large\nnumbers of photographs started circulating on Twitter\nand other media, becoming a phenomenon in itself.\nPhotographs are digital data too, a combination of\n6 Big Data & Society\npixels and bits. They, however, need to be emphasised,\nsince they disappear from view when aggregated in\ntrending hashtags. Photographs are important because\nthey evoke context: specific people, places or events.\nThey provide a sort of `existence proof', a reminder\nof people in `flesh and blood' (Becker, 2002). I would\nargue that this material dimension is somehow lost in\nBig Data analysis.\nI selected some photographs from the usual deluge\nof Twitter data, while following live the `digital coup' in\nTurkey. They are presented here as episodic vignettes,\nexactly like ethnographers would use extracts of long\ninterviews, or a network analyst would isolate particu-\nlar tweets out of thousands. Triangulated with other\ndata, they will hopefully give the reader a heuristic\ngrasp on this composite scenario: a banknote,\n10 Turkish Liras, with the Google alpha-numeric\ninscription; a restaurant menu outside an al-fresco\npatio, with iPhone and Google DNS instructions; a\nfew citizens gathering around a poster which explains\nhow to re-connect to Twitter.\nI find this latest photo particularly helpful in revealing\nwhat a `hacking multitude' might be and how it might\noperate. This is for three reasons.15 First, the photograph\nspeaks of a localised protest, in Istanbul here and now: it\nimmediately gives the context, which photography can so\neffectively evoke. Second, it recalls the experience of\nInternet censorship, its affective dimension. Notes written\non walls, such as directives or instructions, convey the\nstate of emergency proper of transformative moments.\nThere is here a sense of suspension: we do not know\nwhat exactly these people are going to do with their\nCardullo 7\nnew workaround, whether they will be able to successfully\nactivate it for their own purposes, or if they are already\nspreading the news to others. In other words, this image\nrecalls `wirelessness', `an experience trending toward\nengagement with things, objects, gadgets, infrastructures\nand services, and imbued with indistinct sensations and\npractices of network-associated change' (Mackenzie,\n2011: 5). Importantly, `wirelessness' is not a pure sensa-\ntion of transition through digital networks and devices, a\nflow at a push of a button, but an experience made of\nattempts, errors and repetitions (Mackenzie, 2008). I\nwould argue that in moments of suspension between\nactions and networks, the multitude's reflexivity and its\npotential for social interactions might be set in motion. Its\ninherent virtuality is a relevant concept: it is in the nature\nof a multitude to unpredictably respond to an evolving\nFinally, the photograph reminds us of the ordinariness\nof the Internet. By-standers here look like ordinary\npeople: frankly, quite boring compared to mainstream\nrepresentations of hackerdom (e.g. the terrifying\nAnonymous). They appear intent at modifying their com-\nmunication tools, ordinary mobile phones (`ordinary' as\nused by Raymond Williams, as for mundane, vernacular,\n`of the people'). This is crucial for understanding what a\n`multitudo' is. Its Latin root `multis', which we translate\nin English as `many', mistakenly points to a vast number\nof people. If that was the case, we would circularly fall\ninto a Big Data logic: the more data comes, the more\ntruthful data appears to be. Rather, I use multitude as\n`mob', `rabble' or `throng', that is an indistinct and\nunclassifiable group of individuals.16\nAfter failing to adopt pressure directly on Twitter,\nwhich appeared to stand for the `freedom of speech',17\nthe Turkish government managed to block requests\nnegotiated via Google-owned or any other public\nDNS. Similar to what happens in China,18 they heigh-\ntened the level of censorship, moving the block to IP\nlevel. There are few ways of doing this, but such a dis-\ncussion is beyond the scope of this article. The import-\nant thing is that public DNS was now not effective,\nbecause no Internet Service Provider in Turkey could\nreach Twitter by IP address any longer. When Turkey\nmanaged to block Twitter at IP level, more articulated\nresponses became necessary in order to avoid the ban.\nCrucially, these had to be learned.\nVPN time! (tweet)\nThe hacking game\nI will now briefly explain the functioning of VPN and\nTOR, emphasising first their popularity and then social\naspects around their implementation.\nVirtual Private Network means that a user can\nsecurely connect to a computer by using a technique\ncalled `tunnelling'. The VPN client communicates over\nthe public Internet and sends the computer traffic\nthrough an encrypted connection to a VPN server.\nUsing this connection, VPN customers can securely\naccess the Internet from their remote device, bypassing\nany filtering included in their Internet Service Provider's\npolicy. VPNs are usually offered as a pay-per service, so\ntrust is regulated by the terms of provision of such a\nservice. Therefore, there are a few drawbacks in this\nmethod: reliance on private traffic, difficulties in setting\nup secure client\u00adserver connections and security flaws\n(e.g. institutional controls on the provider).\nTOR, The Onion Router, is both a free software and\nan open network that help users stay anonymous and\ndefend themselves against traffic analysis.19 TOR\nbounces signal at least three times in several random\nrelays, to make it anonymous. For efficiency, TOR\nuses the same circuit for no longer than 10 minutes.20\nMoreover, each hop in the network exchanges an\nencryption, or `onion skin', around the original trans-\nmission. TOR is not just an application, but an ever-\nchanging network of proxies, made of random relay\nservers and strong encryptions. It provides a continuum\nin which the degree of privacy is generally a `function of\nthe number of participating routers versus the number\nof compromised or malicious routers' (Wikipedia).21\nTOR shreds to pieces the idea that the Net is con-\ntrollable in any single nation. It is not secure, but it is\nanonymous. VPN is not anonymous, but it is probably\nmore secure (if you trust the service provider). To put it\nbluntly, while VPN is a solution favoured by business\n(it is a paid-for service, after all), TOR is the obvious\nchoice of `hackers' (it is Free and Open Source, in fact).\nMost of my interviewees had embraced VPN as their\nfavourite method for going online, and they generally\nreported a hassle-free experience. Importantly, none of\nthem had ever used such tools before.\nI decided to download VPN Unlimited on my Android\nphone. It was easy to operate and didn't seem to cause\ntoo much speed or reliability issues.\nActually it was pretty easy. Through my friends'\nadvices I downloaded two VPN applications to my\nmobile phone. (online interviews)\nA participant, who describes themselves as `a source\nwith inside knowledge',22 shared some metrics on\nTwitter traffic from Turkey. Although not possessing\nany `hard numbers', the informant estimates that\n`around 20% of the total number' of Turkish Twitter\naccounts connected from a non-Turkish Internet\nProvider (indirect evidence of people connecting via\n8 Big Data & Society\nTOR or foreign VPN providers). Moreover, `around\n50\u00ad80% of this traffic remained there two months\nafter the ban was lifted, which was a little surprising'.\nThis attitude to maintain some control over their\nInternet privacy, even after the events, is confirmed\nby all interviewees (mostly VPN users):\nI currently use an open DNS number and have access to\nblocked sites,23 but I'm considering to buy a yearly plan\non TunnelBear [VPN] so that I can browse privately.\nIn case of any future blockage especially on social net-\nworks, yes I will definitely use VPN services again.\nQ: Are you going to use VPN again? A: If there is fur-\nther blockage, yes.\nQ: Will you use TOR again? A: Still running and will\ndo! Q: What's your experience? A: Experience? I fell in\nlove with it! (Online interviews, emphases added)\nWhile VPN statistics are largely private, TOR\nProject publishes all network traffic on their website24:\nthere is a sharp increase in TOR traffic after censorship\nblocks in Turkey (blue dots) and a progressive reduc-\ntion, confirming the release of censorship after the elec-\ntions (red dots).\nTOR actually works. It is in fact easy to set up as a\nrelay, in a way that users can share their bandwidth\nwith the anonymous network. It is even easier if a\nuser wants to just access the network without hosting\nany part of it, by installing a modified version of\nFirefox called TOR Browser Bundle, TBB.\nTBB is fool proof. It is easy to use. No need to install\nand configure software as TBB is ready to run. So\nmany people began to switch to TOR or TBB. It was\nTwitter, forums and Bulletin Board Systems that made\nTOR famous. TBB was the key for its adoption.\n(Online interview)\nI contend that the expertise and reflexivity which tech-\nnology users acquire cannot simply vanish. Multitude's\nability to learn, store and eventually perform,\nunacknowledged, the fruit of its immaterial labour is\nabsolutely crucial (see Virno, 2003). From my first find-\nings on the Turkish case study, I would additionally\nargue that many Internet practices transverse through\nlines of activism, use and production of digital data, so\nto encompass a broader, non-technology savvy multi-\ntude of users. These create, maintain and amplify the\n`informational milieu' (Terranova, 2004) which\nsupports more conventional hacking practices. For\ninstance, users participate in a newsletter, ask for help\nor spread `proper' hackers' workarounds through social\nnetworks or over material surfaces25:\nI worry about the population's huge percentage who\ndoes not know English. I kindly request a TOR\nbrowser pack in Turkish language for this. I hope\nyou guys share the same responsibility as I feel . . . I\ncan provide my service for translating every text in\nthe browser to Turkish. (TOR-talk mailing list, 26\nCardullo 9\nHere there is a demand, an offer for help and an initi-\nation of a dialogue with `you guys', presumably TOR\ndevelopers and `proper' hackers. Alleyne's distinction\nof three main strands of activities which characterise\n`hackers' comes in useful here: open/clandestine prac-\ntices, hacktivism and hardware hacking (2011). He sug-\ngests an `integrated sociological understanding of\nhacking', which comprises these diverse set of practices:\nThe hack is no longer the exclusive act of the hacker.\nWhen we make a web mash-up, a music or video\nremix . . . we are also part of a blurring of the lines\nbetween hackers and everyone else . . . We are all hack-\nAt times this collaboration becomes more manifest\nin spaces of the everyday. My main participant from\nthe TOR-talk mailing list, who defines themselves as a\n`help desk, system and network administrator', narrates\nthis vivid account of his progressive involvement in the\nTurkish events:\n. . . The majority were Twitter users with their Twitter\nnicknames asking for help to access Twitter via\nTOR . . . Second round of TOR questions were how to\nmake it fast . . . Some users came up with questions\nabout cloaking of TOR. It put me in a situation that I\ndid not anticipate. I thought it was the end, but it turned\nout to be not. People began asking for hidden\nservices26 . . . I got a particular email message from\nsomeone. S/he offered to pay for my service. That was\nall. I discarded it because I was overwhelmed with all\nTOR, DNS, VPN questions. Same person contacted me\nvia email again. It was the same mail sent again. I again\ndiscarded it. Same mail got into my inbox a few days\nlater. The email was from a non-profit organization. I\nwas asked not to disclose their name and location. They\nwere short on cash and wanted to set up a hidden service\nfor their interest groups which was vital for them. They\noffered appraisal and blessings nothing more. I accepted\nit. (Online interview, my emphases)\nThis account again manifests the sense of ordinariness\n(e.g. not encrypted requests with their Twitter handle)\nand the escalation to more complex hacking practices\nwhich require learning and support.\nFollowing the new hashtag #GoogleDN\nSisBlockedinTurkey, my narrative of a `hacking multi-\ntude' became clearer by the hour. It was supported by\nan increasing frequency of reflexive comments\nregarding the weird game being staged live on the\nInternet.\nEvery Turkish citizen has become some kind of Internet\nexpert/amateur hacker after the ban. (tweet, Istanbul)\n[The] whole Turkey will be computer geeks:)\n(tweet, Istanbul)\nThese comments seem to foresee an indistinct mass of\npeople, a multitude in fact, ready to take some control,\nat least temporarily, on a complex regime of communi-\ncation. The content of communication, the message\nitself, takes a back stage:\nI checked my personal and company Twitter accounts'\nnewfeeds. Although it was like a ghost town after a\ncouple of days, we decided to continue to tweet from\nthe company's official account. (Online interview)\nDespite my objectives are other than unpacking links\nbetween technological networks and activism, I find it\nsymptomatic that Twitter felt `like a ghost town'. This\nobservation supports the thesis that, after all, Twitter\nmight not be central to urban protests. For my focus,\nthough, it is more important that my participant and\nhis colleagues `decided to continue to tweet'. Here,\nform prevails over meanings, it evades codification.\nThe necessity to be present beyond data choke-points,\nwhich undeniably pushed Twitter trends, unmasks the\nperformative aspect of data itself. In the above vignette,\nthere is a clear disconnection between how the network\nis imagined (`citizen journalism', trends, global audi-\nence) and how it is experienced (`a ghost town').\nTowards a `hacking multitude'?\nTwo propositions\nMy preliminary findings around Internet censorship in\nTurkey show that an extensive attachment to the possi-\nbility of acting beyond restrictions started appearing.\nNot that this is always possible or that everyone wants\nto do it, of course. However, Turkish users' responses\ngive the sense of a growing contention around the `net-\nwork of networks'. This is partly due to the Internet\ngrowing more complex and articulated, certainly\nbeyond traditional national jurisdictions.27 In my\nstudy, there is some evidence \u00ad the spike in TOR metrics,\nthe leaked insight that part of Turkish users' traffic was\nfrom an ISP outside Turkey and the qualitative data col-\nlected from online interviews and from Twitter \u00ad that\ntactics of resistance to Internet censorship are learned\nand amplified in unpredictable ways. In this final section,\nI briefly explore two research trajectories which can fur-\nther develop the initial formulation of a `hacking multi-\ntude'. They foreground some implications that this\ngeneralization might have for the political, cultural or\neconomic processes more directly associated with data.\n1. There is a solid argument in cultural studies around\nthe ubiquitous presence of software in everyday\n10 Big Data & Society\naspects of our lives (Kitchin, 2011). This presents a\nwhole set of issues around power (Lash, in Beer,\nvalue. Differently from traditional media audiences\n(TV, radio and papers), social media consumers are\nin fact also producers of data. We routinely share,\ntag, like and comment, so contributing to Big Data\nmetrics. These actions are almost automatic, they\nhave become part of daily routines, they maintain\nthe flow, both as data and as practices of `evil\nuses of the Internet now involve some kind of `pro-\nsumption', a form of free labour in the production of\npens when there is a disruption to everyday produc-\ntion/consumption of data, such as a censorship\nattempt? To what extent is a `hacking multitude'\nable to disrupt, change, or maintain data flow?\nAnd how is the concept of `flow' in itself useful\nwhen set against non-linear and unpredictable\nprocesses of techno-tweaking?\n2. This opens to a second tenet. If digital labour impli-\ncates a social process of learning, a sort of `geo-\nlogical stratum' of technological knowledge (Hardt\nsort of collective learning curve, a repository for\nactions and resistance whenever the situation pre-\nsents itself. I attempted to follow some of the excite-\nment brewing around the Twitter ban in Turkey:\nWhenever they ban something, we learn something\nnew. (tweet, Istanbul)\nEveryone has to learn now about VPN, DNS, and how\n[the] Internet works. (tweet, Istanbul)\nThe relentless learning from practices of digital labour\nforegrounds the possibility that software and digital\ntechnologies can be used in more competent and reflex-\nive ways. The Turkish example brings some evidence\ntowards this kind of argument, but more research is\nneeded, especially around perception of TOR or other\ndata encryption systems from the perspective of every-\nday users. To the extent that circumvention of censor-\nships and protection of own privacy might become a\n`hacking game' for a multitude of users, production,\ncirculation and consumption of digital data can\nbecome widely affected with regard to its volume, var-\niety and velocity. Moreover, by generating and replicat-\ning content over a banned platform, users of social\nmedia create data with a higher intensity of affect,\nboth locally and across the globe. The text and photo-\ngraphs analysed here convey the experience of `hacking'\nfrom an everyday perspective: the sense of enthusiasm,\nfrustration and radicalisation implied in the participa-\ntion in a `hacking game'. Some of the individuals who\nmanaged to avoid Twitter censorship in Turkey,\neagerly circulated insights learned during their digital\nlabour. They shared tips and enjoyed a newly acquired\nstatus of `hackers', among friends, colleagues and social\nmedia followers.\nIt feels like fighting against Agent Smiths in [the]\nMatrix movie. (tweet, Istanbul)\nConcluding remarks\nIn trying to make sense of what happened in the Twitter-\nsphere when the Turkish government blocked access to\nthe platform, I started looking at some Big Data metrics.\nThese are in the form of infographics and statistics on\nTwitter traffic and trends. A solely quantitative analysis\nof Twitter data would give the impression that data flows\nseamlessly. But at a closer analysis, I would argue that the\nmetaphor of `flow' does not capture the immaterial forms\nof digital communication, par excellence: the sharing of\nbits in the form of a 140-character tweet. What became\nvisible during the `digital coup' were rather the material-\nities of social media systems \u00ad both the technological\nworkings of the Internet with switches and routers, and\nthe hacking practices of some of its users.\nCensorship in Turkey gave space to a diffuse response\nthat moved beyond the technological, what I try to cap-\nture with the concept of a `hacking multitude'. The battle\nfor presence on Twitter filtered down to inventive pub-\nlics that probably had little to do with microblogging.\nGraffiti, banknotes, restaurant boards and so on were\nmore than the circulation of a piece of information;\nthey appear to be a legitimising stance towards\nInternet freedom. Although difficult to quantify in met-\nrics of traffic, this social space cannot be neglected.\nThe composite scenario I engaged with suggests that\nthere is a social, sensorial and affective dimension to the\nway in which we produce, defend ourselves from, or con-\nsume, the deluge of digital data. This dimension is emer-\ngent, plural and unstable, like data itself. Ruppert et al.\nargue that `digital data is itself a materiality that is\n``alive,'' embodied and mobile', it actualises `relations\nand connections that are otherwise beyond perception\nand thus inherent to the very imagining of social relations'\nness is a trans-disciplinary effort, beyond the statistical\nanalysis of its occurrence. In the second part of the\npaper, I focused on individual responses by way of ana-\nlysing some tweets, photographs and the content of online\ninterviews. Digital ethnography and sociological dis-\ncourse analysis are the methods I use to try to capture\nthis media ecology made of pixels, tweets, censorship,\nalgorithms, bits and devices, but also of feelings, skills and\nfrustrated attempts. This methodological approach\nattains to the particular and, therefore, to Small Data.\nWorking across \u00ad rather than simply mixing \u00ad quan-\ntitative and qualitative methods,28 I started a reflection\non an evolving scenario. The good thing about power-\nful visualisations, such as infographics, is the heuristic\nimpression they give of a growing, and otherwise hardly\naccountable, exchange network (Ruppert et al., 2013:\n36). However, it is the granularity of data itself, its\n12 Big Data & Society\nparticular composition and diversity, which makes vis-\nible ordinary users' reactions. A `multitude', in my\nfocus. Within this varied ensemble of data, a privileged\nplace belongs to photographs circulated by Turkish\nTwitter users. Photographs make explicit the intercon-\nnections between Big Data (in this case, tweets, trends\nand hashtags) and other communication systems (in\nthis case, graffiti, banknotes, other social media and\nleaflets). These interconnections are performed in\nspaces of the everyday and possibly loaded with\naffect.29 They are `the social'. However, they are invis-\nible in aggregate metrics of flow.\nIn the final part of the paper, I sketched the contours\nof what I emphatically called a `hacking multitude'. This\nidea nests on a more general argument on Internet free-\nInternet relations `Access Contested', pointing to a\n`patchwork of competing interests and values' which\nwill eventually define the Internet of the future. Similar\nto my argument, he talks of a `multitude of actors'.\nDifferently, he privileges institutional actors with a\nstake in cyberspace policies and practices on either side\nof the coin. These include giant corporations, civil soci-\nety groups and `public opinion'. It is in this novel recon-\nfiguration of cyberspace that we need to set localised\nactions of ordinary people, such as forms of encryption\nor bandwidth sharing. These practices might look\ningenuous. However, they form a sort of collective\nrepository of a multitude that, creatively and opportun-\nistically, reacts to censorship and surveillance of the\nInternet. They naively expose how this communication\nand data creation system is open to modification.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author declares that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit\nsectors.\nNotes\n1. `Twitter is a menace to society, to all societies. All kinds of\nimmorality takes place there, families get separated; this is\nagainst the party's conservative agenda'; `All our national,\nmoral values have been put aside' (various sources).\n2. `Twitter and all \u00ad none of them are bigger than our nation'\n(Speech in Bursa, Turkey; Reuters http://tiny.cc/ssucnx).\n3.
