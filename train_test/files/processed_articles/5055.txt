Work-related suicides, sometimes occurring in\nthe workplace itself, have left their mark on several large\ncompanies. A group of experts commissioned by the Ministry\nof Labor has examined these risks and how to define and\nmeasure them (Gollac, 2011). Employees have, in principle,\nbeen afforded greater protection in legislation and collective\nagreements. For all that, European surveys have uncovered a\nnumber of worrying factors linked to new forms of work\nintensification. In the service sector, the relationship with the\ncustomer is often highlighted as one of these risk factors.\nThe present article is based on a case study of bus drivers\nin urban environments. We intend to explore what could be\nseen as a paradox: a real improvement in the job of bus driver\nwith shorter working times, but an increase in absenteeism\ndue to illness and work-related accidents.\nThe article is structured around two central issues. The\nfirst concerns the new forms of work intensification to which\nbus drivers are subject. The second concerns the resources\nthat are available to bus drivers and whether or not they make\nuse of them. Following Hirschman (1970), various forms of\nexit can be identified although they are limited in France by\nthe importance of the lifetime employment model in firms\ndominated by internal labor markets. The ability of employ-\nees and their representatives to use the new protective rights,\nwhich can be likened to a form of voice, is also limited and\nin the cases studied the new rights do not seem to offer any\nconvincing improvement.\nAfter a general presentation of the job of bus driver and a\nreview of the literature on the main risks and health conse-\nquences, we present our theoretical framework, which is based\non a socio-economic approach. Then, having outlined the\nFrench legal framework and our methodology, we will examine\nour results on the new forms of intensification and arduousness\naffecting bus drivers'work. We will then consider the resources\nthat employees and their organizations deploy or fail to deploy.\nBus Drivers' Working Conditions: A\nBrief Overview\nThis category of workers is of interest for several reasons.\nIt is large and includes women doing the same job as men.\n1Aix Marseille University, LEST, CNRS, France\nCorresponding Author:\nPhilippe M\u00e9haut, LEST, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, 35 avenue Jules\nEmail: philippe.mehaut@univ-amu.fr\n\"A plus Dans le Bus\": Work-Related\nStress Among French Bus Drivers\nNathalie Louit-Martinod1, C\u00e9cile Chanut-Guieu1,\nCathel Kornig1, and Philippe M\u00e9haut1\n Keywords\nbus drivers, psycho-social risks, France, protective rights\n2 SAGE Open\nIt faces significant safety issues as it involves the transport\nof people. The job has an \"industrial\" dimension as it\ninvolves driving a vehicle while complying with a series of\nnorms, particularly with regard to time schedules. Bus driv-\ners can also be said to be shift workers, alternating early\nmorning, mid-day, and evening/night shifts, as in large fac-\ntories. However, it is also a service activity, with drivers in\npermanent contact with passengers. Drivers must divide\ntheir time and attention between the road and the inside and\noutside of the bus to ensure that passengers obey the rules\nThere has undoubtedly been an improvement in the tech-\nnical equipment: The driver's cab is better designed and the\nbuses have air conditioning and modern communications\nsystems. In France, a reduction in working time following\nthe introduction of the 35-hr week has also been applied to\nbus drivers. Nevertheless, the health indicators are deterio-\nrating and seem to suggest that these workers have suffered a\ndeterioration in their health and well-being at work. Thus,\nacross France as a whole, time off for accidents at work and\nwork-related ill health has increased in the passenger trans-\nport sector (20 days for sickness, 5.2 for accidents and work-\nrelated ill health in 2013). The same applies, more generally,\nincreasingly heavily on the companies that employ them and\nhave repercussions for the drivers themselves, their work is\nbeing subjected to ever greater control and monitoring, both\ninternally and externally. And yet drivers are still in sole\ncharge of their vehicles, in non-confined jobs (as defined by\nHatchuel, 2002). However, they have to deal with new uncer-\ntainties linked to the customer relationship and to their work-\ning environment. These new forms of intensification might\nexplain why certain indicators of well-being at work have\ndeteriorated.\nThe Physical and Mental Risks of Bus\nDriving: A Literature Review\nBus drivers as an occupational group have long attracted\nconsiderable attention. One of the reasons for this attention\nlies in their responsibility toward the traveling public. Tse,\nFlin, and Mearns (2006), for example, carried out an exten-\nsive literature survey covering a period of 50 years. And in\nFrance, since the beginning of the 20th century, the RATP\n(R\u00e9gie Autonome des Transports Parisiens; the Paris public\ntransport operator) has been conducting psycho-technical\ntests to evaluate aspiring drivers' skills and aptitude.\nRecognized and Fairly Well-Documented Physical\nRisks\nThere is an extensive literature on the main physical risks\n(accidents or illnesses) to which bus drivers are prey. A not\ninsignificant share of this literature comes from the world of\nmedicine or ergonomics. Although they are still sometimes\ncontested (cancers linked to pollution; Soll-Johanning, Bach,\n& Jensen, 2003), the physical risk factors and the subsequent\ndamage to health have been identified, a fairly broad consen-\nsus on them has been reached, and preventive measures have\nbeen put in place. Tse et al. (2006) list them (see also Thierry,\nChouani\u00e8re, & Aubry, 2008, for a more general survey of\nprofessional drivers).\nWe will make only brief mention of them here. Our analy-\nses and observations have confirmed these main risk factors\n(notably through analysis of the causes of absences because\nof workplace accidents and/or occupational disorders).\nThe factors listed here are those linked to the material\nworking conditions: prolonged periods of sitting, driving\ngestures and postures, state of the roads, and vehicle suspen-\nsion and noise, which combine to produce a series of prob-\nlems, notably musculoskeletal disorders (lower back pain,\ndamage to shoulders and elbows, falls when getting off bus)\nand heart conditions.\nAlso listed are pathologies associated mainly with the\norganization of working time and the organic disorders\nlinked to shift work, including sleep problems, gastro-intes-\ntinal complaints, and tiredness.\nStress, Psycho-Social Risks, and Assaults\nHere too, the literature is consistent. In their model, Tse et al.\nidentify violence and traffic jams as risk factors attributed to\nthe \"physical environment,\" in the same way as the previous\ntance of risk factors linked to physical assaults (which we put\nin the same category as stress and other psycho-social risks,\nas they are different from pathologies directly linked to the\nvehicles, the physical working conditions, the organization\nof working time, etc.). Several studies, a high share of them\nby doctors, measure the psycho-physiological disorders\nrelated to stress (adrenaline levels, etc.), particularly in com-\nparisons between men and women (Aronsson & Rissler,\nconclusions regarding the impact of traffic jams and increases\nin certain biological parameters indicative of stress.\nTheoretical Approach\nWe take a different approach, focusing mainly on the way by\nwhich drivers are able to mobilize organizational resources\n(individual and collective) to cope with the new (or increas-\ning) factors of stress.\nHirschman (1970), with his notions of exit, voice, and\nloyalty, provides an analytical framework that can be used to\naddress this question. This framework has been mainly built\nto analyze consumer's strategies (and/or strategies of the\nusers of organizations such as political parties). However, it\nhas been also used in the socio-economics of labor (Gazier,\n1991) to explain quit or voice processes among workers\nLouit-Martinod et al. 3\nenduring poor wages or bad working conditions, to under-\nstand union's strategies. In this article, the bad working con-\nditions are only related to the stress. The notion of voice\nmust be extended to include all forms of collective action,\nincluding the role of bilateral, institutional committees. In\nthese committees, unions are present but not alone. The\nnotion of exit also needs to be somewhat reorganized. In the\nFrench context of internal labor markets (typical for bus\nfirms) and high levels of unemployment, quitting is not a\nresource. And the labor turnover is rather low. However,\ninternal mobility, changing from one route to another or from\nbus driving to other positions, constitutes a highly codified\nset of resources and opportunities on which bus drivers can\nbuild careers with the company, and avoid some of the risky\njob places. As emphasized in Hirschman book, as well as in\nother, more labor-oriented analyses, quit and voice must be\ncombined and not opposed. Moreover, as we will see, some\ninternal \"quitting strategies\" are regulated and sometimes\nderiving from the voice power. This is a way of understand-\ning how driver's rights are (or not) mobilized and of bridging\nthe gap between medical and psychological analyses and\nmore sociological and economic approaches\nComing now to some of these more socio-organizational\napproaches, the most frequently used model is that devel-\noped by Karasek (1979). Quite apart from its academic suc-\ncess, its simplicity means it has been taken up by many\nmanagement consultants to measure psycho-social risks.\nThis was the case in one of the companies investigated, inci-\ndentally. Nevertheless, this model is mainly based on the\nsituation in manufacturing companies and occupations and\nseems to us less well suited to analyses of service companies\nand occupations. While some variables are fundamental,\nsuch as support (from peers or management, which we\nencountered in our case studies), drivers engage in more\ninteraction with passengers in the co-production of the ser-\nvice (De Bandt & Gadrey, 1994) and, more broadly, with the\nexternal environment (in the case of \"non-confined\" drivers\nin Hatchuel's sense of the term (Hatchuel, 2002) than with\ntheir peers or with management. Gimeno, Benavides, Mira,\nMartinez, and Benach (2004) suggest that bus incidents and\nregulating actions have an impact on psychological risks;\nhowever, the impact of passengers' behaviors is not signifi-\ncantly correlated. However, other studies, many of them case\nstudies with more of a sociological slant, emphasize the\nimportance of rudeness and violence for drivers' health\nSliter, Jex, Wolford, & McInnerney, 2010) and for the vari-\nous mediators who may or may not enable drivers to with-\nstand the tension. Thus, Gandibleux and Dartois (2006)\nemphasize the importance of factors such as traffic jams and\nrudeness for drivers' stress. Contradictory demands (driving\nstyle/commercial considerations, schedules/quality of inter-\naction with passengers, etc.) give rise to tensions linked to\noccupational identity that may also affect driving style and\ncause physical and mental problems. In that sense, we are\nclose to the emotional labor approach to service work\nis an often underestimated part of bus drivers' work and of\ntheir pride (and difficulties) in serving passengers in the pub-\nlic space.\nHowever, understanding the change in the public space\nneeds also a broader perspective, including the consequences\nof the changing economic regulations of the urban trans-\nports. Hasle (2007) has investigated how the privatization of\nurban transport has changed the relationships between com-\nmissioning bodies, on one hand, and subcontractors and their\nemployees, on the other. Responsibilities for health and\nsafety issues have become blurred, which is likely to affect\ndrivers' health. In a long-term investigation of a large trans-\nport company, Gallenga (2011) reveals the tensions gener-\nated by new public management and the increase in the\nnumber of unsafe situations drivers experience.\nThese are the avenues we intended to pursue in the\nremainder of this article. Our aims are first to gain a better\nunderstanding of the complex causes and forms of work\nthese general forms apply to a particular case, that of bus\ndrivers in subcontractor companies bound by public procure-\nWe can then develop our own re-interpretation of\nHirschman to combine exit and voice strategies, focusing\nonly on the way in which, within the firm, bus drivers cope\nwith the psycho-social risks linked to the relationship with\ncustomers and road users in a new economic context.\nProtection Against Psycho-Social Risks:\nThe French Legal Framework\nIt is only fairly recently that the law in France, as in the rest\nof the European Union, has provided protection against psy-\ncho-social risks. As early as 1946, after all, the World Health\nOrganization had declared that \"Health is a complete state of\nphysical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the\nabsence of disease or infirmity\" (World Health Organization,\nment of legislation rendering bullying at work illegal that\nworkers' mental health was protected in the same way as\ntheir physical health. It is true that the notion itself is difficult\nto define, encompassing as it does various forms of suffering\nat work: bullying, violence, stress, depression, burn-out, and\nso forth. And in fact, with the exception of bullying, there is\nno legal definition of these risks. This has not prevented\nFrench trade unions and employers' associations, faced with\na rise in mental health problems in the workplace and spurred\nframework agreements), from seizing on the question and\nnegotiating two national intersectoral agreements, one on\nworkplace stress (2008) and the other on bullying and vio-\nlence (2010). Nevertheless, while these agreements certainly\nraised awareness and set out a general framework for action,\n4 SAGE Open\nthey are not very restrictive. After all, they cannot achieve\ntheir full effect unless they are incorporated into company\nagreements that put in place concrete risk prevention mea-\nsures. To that end, and following several suicides among\nworkers in a large, formerly state-owned telecommunica-\ntions company, the Ministry of Labor in 2009 encouraged\ncompanies with more than 1,000 employees to start negotia-\ntions on workplace stress or risk being included in a blacklist\nto be published on the Internet.\nUnder pressure from the \"bad boys,\" this \"blacklist\"\nremained in the public domain for just one day. It was\nreplaced by a list of companies that had signed agreements,\nor at least put in place action plans. Thus, one of the compa-\nnies investigated (TramBus) drew up an action plan in con-\nsultation with the workforce representative bodies and the\ntrade union delegates. However, it would seem that, in gen-\neral, the social partners have not really taken up these issues.\nAt the same time, the prevention of psycho-social risks was\ndeclared a priority by the government in its Health in the\nquestion have been produced by researchers (Gollac, 2011;\nLachmann, Larose, & Penicaud, 2010; Nasse & L\u00e9geron,\nWhat obligations do employers have with regard to these\nrisks? In France, the answer to this question is to be found in\ncase law, where the legislation has been interpreted strictly.\nThe transposition into French law of Framework Directive\nsures intended to promote improvements in workers' health\nand safety led the legislature to impose an obligation on\nemployers to put in place prevention policies in the work-\nplace. It was incorporated into French law with the following\nwording: \"Employers shall take all the measures necessary\nto ensure the safety and to protect the physical and mental\nFrench Labour Code). Furthermore,\nThe obligation to maintain employees' health . . . requires\nemployees to put in place a company health policy. The\ncompany's responsibility in matters of health and safety shall no\nlonger be confined to limiting absences from work and cases of\nThus, the principle underlying the legislation is no longer the\nreparation of damage caused but rather the prevention of\ndamage. The new principle manifests itself notably in the\nobligation placed on employers to compile a single risk\nassessment document that takes psycho-social risks in par-\nticular into account. And in the past 10 years, employers'\nresponsibilities in health and safety matters have been fur-\nther extended by French case law. The United Kingdom's\nHealth and Safety at Work Act, which states that \"It shall be\nthe duty of every employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably\npracticable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his\nemployees,\" was judged to be compliant with the 1989\nDirective by the European Court of Justice (EJC; June 14,\nemployers in many other countries are obliged to use \"best\nendeavours\" in safeguarding health and safety in the work-\nplace (Lerouge, 2014). However, the French courts have\nturned this obligation on employers to prevent harm into a\nperformance obligation. In other words, while employers in\nthe United Kingdom and many other European countries are\nobliged to provide the means to safeguard health and safety,\nFrench employers are under an obligation to achieve certain\nresults. This performance obligation on employers, which\nemerged originally out of cases brought under social security\nlegislation by victims of asbestosis and their families (nota-\nbly SA Everite v. Andr\u00e9 Gerbaud, Cour de cassation, February\nticularly in cases of bullying. This process continued with an\nimportant decision in Snecma v. The CGT trade union (Cour\nCourt declared \"that he [the employer] is forbidden, in exer-\ncising his right to manage, to take measures that have the\naim or the effect of compromising employees' health and\nsafety.\" Thus, the Cour de Cassation (the final court of appeal\nin France) took the view that a form of organization an\nemployer decides to introduce can be suspended by the\ncourts on the grounds that it might harm employees'physical\nand/or mental health even though no damage has yet been\nobserved. Thus, \"the health imperative prevails over the right\nto manage, which may be set aside if it is used intentionally\nto compromise an employee's health or is used in such a way\nthat his or her health is compromised\" (Verkindt, 2008,\np. 520). While sole responsibility rests with the employer,\nworkforce representative bodies can play an important role\nin matters of health and safety at work.\nIn accordance with national and international standards,\nemployees' health and safety form part of the remit of all\nemployee representatives (Verkindt, 2007). However, it is\nthe committee for health, safety, and working conditions\n(CHSCT in French), which, as a specialized institution, has a\nmajor role to play in the fight against psycho-social risks in\nFrance. This role has been growing constantly in recent\nyears, as issues related to health in the workplace have grown\nin importance. Companies or establishments with at least 50\nemployees have to establish a CHSCT. In smaller organiza-\ntions, it is the workforce representatives, where there are any,\nwho carry out some at least of the committee's duties. The\ncommittee is made up of the managing director, who in law\nis the chair, and a delegation elected by the workforce. Other\nmembers include the company doctor and the head of health\nand safety, acting in an advisory capacity. Finally, the health\nand safety inspectorate and officials of the social security\norganizations' prevention services must be informed of all\ncommittee meetings and may attend them. The CHSCT's\nbrief is \"to contribute to the protection of employees' health\nthis end, the committee is charged with analyzing working\nLouit-Martinod et al. 5\nconditions and occupational hazards and has to be consulted\nby the employer prior to any significant change to the system\nof work organization. The CHSCT must meet at least once\nevery 3 months at the request of the managing director, as\nwell as after any serious accident and if at least two of its\nmembers request a meeting. The CHSCT may call on experts\nof its own choosing, particularly in the event of a serious\nhazard within the company or a proposed reorganization that\nwould significantly modify working conditions or health and\nsafety conditions. The employer is responsible for paying the\nexperts.\nMethod\nThis article is based on research (Askenazy, Cartron, &\nin a large French group, one division of which provides\nurban passenger transport services, primarily bus services.\nin this division during our survey. The number of employees\nis growing, mainly through the acquisition of independent\ncompanies.\nStatistical data for a period of 7 years derived from human\nresources (HR) reporting provide a series of indicators on\nsize of workforce, HR policy (e.g., intensity of employee\ntraining), turnover, and absence rate (and the main causes of\nabsence: illness and workplace accidents). It is well known\nthat these data could sometimes underestimate the situation\n(no declaration of workplace accident . . .). In our two big-\ngest firms, they are carefully monitored by the CHSCT.\nNevertheless, we will see later that there are indices of under-\nestimation. Data reveal a similar increase in illness and acci-\ndents for all transport firms, albeit at a slightly lower level.\nFive companies in the division were analyzed in depth. They\nare of varying size and operate in large urban areas and\nmedium-sized towns. One of the criteria for selecting them\nwas the variety of absence rates, which is an indicator usu-\nally regarded in the literature as reflecting varying levels of\nill health, or a certain degree of well-being or malaise at\nwork.\nIn each of the five companies, we analyzed the main doc-\numents relating to their economic situation and their charac-\nteristics in terms of HR and policies on health and safety at\nwork.\nA total of 23 drivers were subjected to analysis while car-\nrying out all or part of their duties. Positioned behind the\ndriver, the observer(s) systematically compiled a register of\nthe constituent elements of the drivers' work and their\nexchanges with users (e.g., counting the number of times\nthey verbally greeted passengers getting on the bus).\nIncidents with passengers as well as with other road users\n(congested roads, refusal to give way, etc.) were counted.\nThe results were summarized in an \"observation file.\"\nFollowing these analyses of the drivers at work, interviews\nwere conducted with them (34 in total; 11 were not observed\nwhile at work). All the drivers who were followed and inter-\nviewed were volunteers, recruited by a poster campaign. The\ninterviews took about an hour each and focused on the inter-\nviewees' career trajectories, the various aspects of the occu-\npation, their work, their health, and their relationships with\ncolleagues and management. They all followed a common\nsemi-structured interview protocol.\nThirty interviews were also carried out in the five firms\nwith managerial and supervisory staff (director, HR manag-\ners, service quality managers, and the drivers' immediate\nsupervisors). These interviews were of variable duration (1\nhr minimum, sometimes 2 or 3) and focused on the various\nfacets of HR management and health and safety policy. In the\ntwo largest firms, a total of nine interviews were also con-\nducted with employee representatives, including members of\nthe CHSCT.\nAll the interviews were analyzed through a thematic com-\nputer tool, and by cross analyses of our team.\nIn the following section, we present some of our results on\nwork intensification and the socio-organizational responses.\nNew Forms of Work Intensification:\nBus Drivers and Their Onerous\nWorking Conditions\nThe main pathological conditions from which bus drivers\nsuffer are well known. We are focusing here rather on the\nrisks--the stressors--arising out of the various forms of\nwork intensification and onerous working conditions associ-\nated with the customer relationship and, more broadly, with\nworking in an urban environment. We are, after all, dealing\nwith a paradoxical situation. First, the drivers we inter-\nviewed, and particularly the older ones, were eager to point\nout that the vehicles they drove had improved, particularly\nthe ergonomics of their cabs and the vehicles' suspension.\nThat's improved dramatically in 50 years . . . Before, there were\nmassive steering wheels, no heating . . . It was hard. (Driver)\nSecond, working time for French bus drivers has been cut\nfollowing the introduction of the 35-hr week.\nHowever, absence rates are rising. New types of work-\nrelated accident are emerging. There are strong indications of\nmalaise despite the active preventive policies implemented\nby management. This makes it necessary to explore in what\nrespects and in what ways the new forms of work intensifica-\ntion may generate stress, malaise, and new psycho-social\nrisks.\nBudgetary Tensions Impact on Working\nConditions\nThere is growing pressure from transport authorities to limit\noperating costs. This pressure manifests itself through the\n6 SAGE Open\nprocess of competitive tendering that takes place when con-\ntracts come up for renewal. However, it can also manifest\nitself during the term of a contract when routes are being\nreorganized (shift from little used to heavily used routes) and\nthe transport authority refuses to take account of any new\ncosts that are incurred while a contract is in force.\nThis pressure is reflected in particular in the stricter man-\nagement of manning levels and equipment in a context in\nwhich passenger numbers are rising. More specifically, it\nmay lead to\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a reduction in front-line supervisory staff, which con-\ntributes in part to the emergence of a feeling of isola-\ntion and lack of management support\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a reduction in the number of relief drivers, which in\nturn reduces flexibility in case of absence\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 tighter management of the ratio of the number of\nbuses to services, which ultimately affects work, job\ncontent, and working conditions\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a tendency to concentrate services on \"profitable\"\nroutes, that is, high-density routes (high passenger\nvolumes, heavy traffic, etc.), which drivers often see\nas nerve-racking\nWhen a driver's got a few kilometers under his belt, they put\nhim on the profitable routes, the high-density ones, where the\njob is more arduous. (Secretary of CHSCT)\nThe buses on route X are cattle trucks. The articulated buses take\nThe optimization of vehicle numbers and of journey times\nreduces the room for maneuver in case of unforeseen prob-\nlems (breakdowns, diversions, road works, traffic jams, etc.)\nand increases drivers' work rates and their workloads. This\ntends in turn to reduce \"breathing\" times and to aggravate\ndriver fatigue and stress:\n. . . You can't greet passengers in the same way on the busy\nroutes, when there's always people getting on and you have to\nsell them tickets straight away and then get moving again,\nyou're always playing catch-up . . .\nThe atmosphere is a bit tense in the center of town, where there's\na lot of people, a lot of stress and it's hot . . . whereas as you get\nfurther away toward the final destination, the passengers are\npolite, they say goodbye unprompted from the back of the bus.\n(Drivers)\nUrban Policies Influence Workloads\nThe pressure in favor of heavily used routes, already alluded\nto above, cannot be explained solely by a concern with prof-\nitability. Traffic congestion in town centers and growing con-\ncern about environmental degradation are further factors\ndriving the expansion of public transport. TramBus and\nSouthBus operate in cities where these are all crucial issues.\nTramBus has put in place a bus lane system throughout the\ncity center. This has enabled the company to increase service\nfrequency and, in principle, cut down on disputes with car\ndrivers. At peak times, however, service frequency is so high\nthat the bus lanes become choked and the endless lines of\nbuses threaten, paradoxically, to block all other traffic. They\nalso put pedestrians at increased risk. For SouthBus, which\noperates in a city between sea and mountains, the heavy car\ntraffic on a number of main routes impedes regular bus flows,\nwhich is a source of tensions with passengers as well as with\nmotorists.\nQuality Control Is Being Tightened, With\nParadoxical Effects\nThe pressure from transport authorities to raise service qual-\nity has tended to intensify. The indicators have proliferated,\nboth within companies and without. They may give rise to\ncontradictory demands. Thus, increasingly stringent punctu-\nality requirements, which are more closely monitored thanks\nto the permanent use of geolocation, sometimes encourage\ndrivers to cut their break times, to drive less smoothly to the\ndetriment of passenger comfort or to carry out tasks concur-\nrently, such as giving change while starting off in order not to\nfall behind schedule.\nAlthough new electronic payment systems have tended to\nreduce the use of cash and standard tickets, drivers who, on\nFrench one-man buses act as conductors as well and are\ntherefore responsible for handing out tickets and change and\nchecking passengers have tickets, are often also subject to\nparadoxical demands. Checking passengers is more difficult\nwhen the bus is more or less overloaded or when it is late. It\ncan also give rise to disputes with passengers. Nevertheless,\npart of the operating companies' revenue depends on their\nability to make passengers pay. Teams of inspectors regularly\nboard buses, but this can also be a source of tension, as the\nfollowing observation demonstrates: Second time inspectors\nhave boarded the bus during the observation period. Five\ninspectors board the bus, the police stay outside. A couple\ntraveling without tickets start to lay into the inspectors, the\nman swearing at them (\"arsehole\"). The female driver\nwatches and the bus remains stationary, until the chief\ninspector says \"Drive on,\" before finishing booking the pair\ndespite the fact that they wanted to get off. \"You can let them\noff at the next stop.\" Normally, they (the inspectors) should\nlodge a complaint, it's a lack of respect. \"You (the observers)\nchose the right bus!\"\nNevertheless, drivers retain permanent responsibility\nfor checking passengers. For many of them, particularly\nthe older ones, this is an integral part of their public ser-\nvice mission and of fairness between passengers.\nSometimes, however, they have to dispense with it, and on\noccasions are even implicitly instructed to do so by their\nsupervisors.\nLouit-Martinod et al. 7\nLet it go, yes. For me, it's the inspector's job. They just have to\nask if it's validated. It's not worth going any further. (Interviewer:\nThat's what you tell them. Or is it what the company tells them?)\nIt's what I say to them, but it's a personal thing. (Unit manager)\nAlthough compliance with quality criteria is part of a cer-\ntain \"pride in public service,\" those criteria can at the same\ntime be a source of heightened tension.\nThe Increased Use (Currently Ongoing) of Direct\nGeolocation by Customers Is Causing Anxiety\nNew technologies adopted to improve service quality and\npassenger information are also changing passengers' rela-\ntionship with drivers. This is the case, for example, with the\ndisplay of waiting times at bus stops, as well as information\nreceived on smartphones. \"They leave home at the last min-\nute, just as I'm passing by\" (Driver). \"They question us more\nif we're late\" (Driver). These new tools are being received\nwith a certain degree of doubt, not to say fear. Geolocation\nalso facilitates increased monitoring of drivers and their\ncompliance with schedules. In four of our cases, it is com-\nbined with a radio link with a control center that enables\noperators to not only enquire about the reasons for any delays\nbut also to help drivers in the event of an incident (by calling\nthe police, for example). Thus, these new technologies have\ntwo contrasting aspects.\nRudeness and Aggression: How Can Drivers\nRemain in Sole Charge of Their Vehicles?\nAs in many service activities involving direct contact with\nthe public, the relationship between bus drivers and passen-\ngers, or between bus drivers and other road users, can some-\ntimes be strained. These relationships are well-known\nstressors (Gandibleux & Dartois, 2006) and sometimes give\nrise to illness and/or accident reports.\nThe boundary between what clearly constitutes aggres-\nsion and what constitutes rudeness is often difficult to estab-\nlish. Andersson and Pearson (1999) suggest that \"incivility is\nlow intensity deviant behaviour with ambiguous intent to\nharm the target, in violation of workplace norms of mutual\nrespect\" (p. 457). Analysis of drivers' statements on this\nquestion made during the interviews we conducted clearly\nreveals the difficulty of defining this notion and the differ-\nences in individuals' perceptions of (and reactions to)\nincidents.\nThree of the five networks tend to be regarded as quiet.\nNevertheless, even on these, the overwhelming majority of\ndrivers we met reported that they had been exposed to rude\nbehavior by passengers, ranging from indifference \"you\ndon't even exist\" via impoliteness (not saying hallo, asking\nfor a ticket while speaking on a mobile phone) to various\nforms of damage to the vehicle.\nRelations with customers have deteriorated since the complaints\nsystem was put in place. The customer's king now.\nThat reflects society, people are always in a hurry, increasingly\nself-centered, you sense it in some people. But if it really got too\nunpleasant, I'd think about quitting, doing something else. For the\nmoment, they're isolated cases, I don't lose it with people every\nday. I called the depot on the voice link and explained the problem.\nWe talk things over and I think it's good, there's a psychological\ntrick we can use because we can put the voice link through the\nloudspeakers and when the drivers call we can use this facility and\ntry to put the frighteners on. It wasn't planned at all, the guy on the\nvoice link just told me the inspectors were all busy and that he was\nsending the police . . . The girls got off straightaway. But they\nthrew stones at me when I started off again. People really love\nthrowing stones at buses. They were just pebbles, there was no\ndamage to the bus, I got a move on, I saw them again some time\nafterwards . . . So there you are, there are a few little things you\ncan do on the radio to help with safety on the bus. (Drivers)\nIncidents of verbal and physical aggression (swearing,\nspitting, and sometimes punches) were reported to us on\nthese quiet networks as well as on routes on the fourth net-\nwork, which is regarded as more problematic.\nYes, there've been some spitting incidents, I've been spat on\ntwice. . . . I got a relief driver in and made a formal complaint\nstraightaway. There was no wriggling out of it. After that, there\nwas another incident, more sexual this time . . . One morning I\nfound myself alone with just one man on the bus, but I hadn't seen\nhim, he was already playing with himself, he came up to me with\nhis trousers round his ankles, penis in his hand, and he tried to\ntouch me. That's when things really kicked off! I opened the door\nand told him to get off. I made a formal complaint, spent hours\nand hours at the police station . . . Well, they caught him . . . We\nhave to deal with that kind of thing as well. (Female bus driver)\nHowever, these situations are difficult to quantify because\nof the vagueness of the underlying notions.\nCareful examination of the work-related accident reports\nat Trambus shows that a lot of them concern incidents involv-\ning \"the head,\" without it being possible to identify whether\nthe harm caused was the result of a fall, a blow, or serious\nstress. Another factor (and one that is revealing of this diffi-\nculty) is the inadequacy of the information provided by driv-\ners. In three of the five networks, where management has\nintroduced \"incident cards,\" there has been a steady decrease\nin the number of cards being filled out, even though all the\ndrivers'statements confirm the extent of passenger rudeness.\nDrivers seem to have become accustomed or even resigned\nto these incidents, particularly because management often\nfile the cards away under the heading \"no action.\"\nRudeness, Also Outside of the Bus\nAlthough there are frequent references in the literature to the\ncustomer relationship, much less is said about the relationship\n8 SAGE Open\nwith other road users. However, it is clear from the observa-\ntions and interviews that this is an important stressor. Traffic\njams, which cause delays, are a frequent occurrence and can\nincrease annoyance among passengers. This is particularly\nthe case at TramBus and SouthBus.\nRight, now, there's no doubt, given the increase in cars, if we\ndon't quickly develop areas where buses can circulate easily,\nit's going to get more and more difficult. It's a worry, because\nin order to be able to move at all, you're obliged to force your\nway through from time to time, so you know you're going to\nupset someone at some point. There are people who'll let you\njostle your way through, you just say sorry and it's OK, but\nothers, you have to give them a toot on your horn to ask them\nto wait and they fly off the handle straightaway . . . So I think\nthe traffic has an enormous effect on our working conditions.\nBadly parked cars, even in dedicated bus lanes, force us to\nmaneuver round them. Someone once suggested I should lodge\na complaint . . . (Interviewer: Had something serious\nhappened?) I had positioned myself badly at an intersection\nand as it was choked up I was stopping other people going\nwhen they had a green light. This individual was hurling insult\nafter insult, I just closed the window and let him rant. He\ncontinued swearing like a trooper, I got going and a little\nfurther on a guy said to me: \"The maniac who was swearing at\nyou, he set off behind you and he jumped the lights and\ntomorrow he'll be summoned to the police station. Do you\nwant to press charges for insulting behavior?\" He was a police\nsuperintendent, a superintendent in plain clothes who had\nwitnessed the scene . . . (Driver)\nDrivers make frequent reference to such acts of rudeness\nor aggression by road users against them. Accidents can also\nbe traumatizing (a pedestrian was run over by a TramBus\nvehicle just prior to our visit) and may also give rise to penal-\nties or sanctions (a MediumBus driver who caused an acci-\ndent was threatened with dismissal but was defended by his\ncolleagues and the trade union).\nTaken together, the factors described above are conspiring\nto change the job, a development often referred to in terms of\ndeterioration, loss of identity, and various forms of work\nintensification giving rise to psycho-social risks. This may\npartly explain the diffuse sense of unease and anxiety that is\nreflected in, among other things, an increase in absence rates,\nas well as other types of reaction.\nExit and/or Voice: What Resources\nDo Drivers and Their Organizations\nDeploy or Fail to Deploy?\nAdopting while revisiting Hirschman's long-established cat-\negories, we turn now to an analysis of the various resources\nand strategies deployed by drivers and their representatives.\nWe begin by examining the various forms of individual exit\nbefore turning to the forms of voice, which draw mainly on\nthe resources available to French workers under the terms of\ncollective agreements or labor legislation.1\nForms of Exit Revisited\nIn Hirschman's approach, the principal exit option is the pos-\nsibility of leaving the firm.\nLeaving the firm.LittleBus and, to a lesser extent, CarBus\ndemonstrate this exit option. In formal terms, LittleBus has\nthe best results for absences, with low levels of illness and\nwork-related accidents. It is also the company whose drivers\nseem to lodge the fewest complaints. However, the highest\nshare of absences is attributed to \"other causes.\" Moreover,\nlabor turnover is very high (Table 1). LittleBus operates in a\n\"difficult\" suburban area. However, its drivers have numer-\nous alternative employment opportunities because of the\nproximity of a major airport (a lot of buses operate in and\naround it) and of a large transport operator serving the whole\nof the urban area that can offer better employment conditions\nand pay. Although we were unable to track the drivers who\nleft, the high level of turnover can certainly be interpreted as\nreflecting a desire on the drivers' part to improve their work-\ning and employment conditions. CarBus differs from the\nother operators in having a high share of part-time employ-\nees (school buses and medium-distance inter-city routes).\nCarBus is undergoing considerable changes (growth, incor-\nporation of urban routes, and a radical change in its pricing\nstructure, which has led to a very sharp increase in passenger\nnumbers and a change in the passenger populations). The\ncompany management referred to the heightened tension this\nhas generated for drivers and the increasing attractiveness for\nthem of the urban routes, which give them full-time employ-\nment and better pay.\nFirm\nSize (number\nof employees)\nLabor\nturnover\nAbsences due to\nsickness (days per\nemployee)\nAbsences due to\naccidents (days\nper employee)\nTotal absences\n(excluding maternity/\nparental leaves)\nLouit-Martinod et al. 9\nChanging job through internal mobility.For the other three\ncompanies, stability prevails. Against a background of high\nunemployment and an absence of other employers in the\ntransport sector, opportunities for external mobility are few\nand far between. These companies have all retained their\nstrong internal labor markets, with open-ended employment\ncontracts and pay rises determined by seniority. To that\nextent, they have inherited the public sector norms that\napplied to the sector before the rapid development of\nprivatization.\nSo what forms does \"internal exit\" take? We identified\nthree main ones, the products both of company agreements\nand more informal internal practices.\nChanging route. The first is the possibility of changing route\nwithin the context of the \"annual subsidies\" to the routes,\nwhich are essentially determined by seniority. In this way,\nemployees can move from being just \"drivers\" (i.e., not\nassigned to a particular route) to being assigned to a particu-\nlar route, after which they can change routes in order, for\nexample, to avoid the most overcrowded ones or those going\nthrough areas regarded as potentially troublesome.\nNo, on route x. I wanted to drive articulated buses . . . But it's\ntrue that the people who use the buses on route x are not great\n. . . I was beginning to get depressed, to be aggressive, they\nwere aggressive to me so I responded in kind, and I didn't like\nworking under those conditions and so I asked to change.\n(Female bus driver)\nTramBus is an interesting case. Besides its bus services,\nthis company also operates a tram system. The tram drivers\nare separated from passengers in their own cab at the front of\nthe tram and have less contact with traffic. Consequently,\nswitching from bus to tram is a form of exit strategy; such a\nmove also provides access to a job regarded as being of higher\nstatus or more \"dignified,\" including by management.\nNevertheless, as noted before, the scope for choice in this\narea is declining as the allegedly \"easier\" low-density routes\ndisappear. Moreover, these changes of route are governed by\nimplicit rules, with seniority being the main criterion\nenabling drivers to make the switch.\nChanging occupation.\nThe second form of internal exit\ninvolves having recourse to the so-called \"incapacity\" or\n\"unfitness\" mechanism. A driver declared unfit to drive\n(temporarily or permanently) by the company doctor must be\nredeployed internally as a matter of priority if a position is\navailable (in the absence of any alternative job, he or she\nmay legally be dismissed). We encountered such situations\nmainly at TramBus and SouthBus, both large companies\nwith a strong trade union presence. At TramBus, extensive\nuse is made of declarations of unfitness to drive without dis-\nmissals; the system is virtually co-managed by the union. At\nthe time of our observations, almost 100 drivers had been\ndeclared unfit to drive and were employed in other positions,\nwhether in the workshops or offices or on park maintenance.\nTo increase the scope for internal mobility, the company had\nbrought back in house certain non-core activities that had\npreviously been outsourced. When interviewed, some driv-\ners still in post pointed out the ambiguities of these positions\nand even criticized what they regarded as nothing but \"career\nstrategies.\" However, in a company with a chronic budget\ndeficit, this situation was becoming untenable. One year\nafter our investigation, management decided to abandon the\nlifetime employment policy and initiated procedures for dis-\nmissing the drivers declared unfit. At SouthBus, without\nbeing quite as problematic, declarations of unfitness to drive\ngave rise to a dispute with the company doctor. Some over-\nweight employees had been declared unfit to drive; the doc-\ntor's judgments were rejected by both management and the\ntrade unions.\nHe declared that the buses weren't designed to take drivers\nabove a certain weight, off the top of my head I think it was 140\nkilos or 130 kilos, but you can't just declare a limit like that. At\nour place, if he did that, he'd be getting rid of half the workforce.\nBending the rules. Somewhere between exit and voice, some\ndrivers try to circumvent the contradictory directives stem-\nming from the instructions they receive, some of which they\nregard as inappropriate. At the risk of being sanctioned, they\nalter or even disregard these instructions.\nThis applies, for example, to the rules governing access to\nthe buses:\nFor me, if they get on through the rear door . . . (Interviewer: So,\nyou don't care about that . . . do you do it?) Yes. I do it, because\nI don't want to see them. I open the rear door first, and then the\nfront door. You shouldn't do it, but well . . . (Driver)\nThere's a rule about the interior of the buses, we can't apply it.\nBaby buggies and pushchairs have to be folded up and babies\ncarried. If we started doing that, we'd never get going . . .\n(Interviewer: So you don't do it.) No. You can't You can't. And\nwe go through the estate, there are women with double or triple\nbuggies. What're we supposed to do? Are they going to carry all\nthe babies in their arms? No. (Driver)\nIt also applies to the way in which drivers react to rudeness\nand aggression. In our five cases, the instructions to drivers\nare the same: Do not respond and do not move from the cab.\nSome drivers obey the instructions. For others, who intend to\nremain \"in sole control of their buses,\" that rule has to be\nbent, particularly to obtain passengers' respect.\nWe don't have any instructions. Well, no, actually, we're\nsupposed to keep our mouths shut so as not to get into an\nargument. That's a bit much, because if we just keep our mouths\nshut, we look like wimps to the passengers and that lot, they'll\neat us alive. And you won't be able to get any respect . . . So, I\ndo open my mouth a bit. Particularly on one route, where the\npassengers are often regulars. If they do that to you once, the\nnext time they'll spit in your face and the time after they'll take\na pop at you. Things start to get out of control, you have to have\nrespect. We're not inspectors, but we make our own rules in\nsome situations because they never come out here and we always\nhave the same passengers. That's my own personal project. I\ndon't only have friends. Normally we should keep our mouths\nshuts, avoid arguments and don't get into any disputes. (Driver)\nOver and above these forms of individual resistance, the\ndrivers have various forms of collective recourse at their\ndisposal.\nVoice: Use of the Legal Levers by Employees and\nTheir Representatives\nAgainst this background, what courses of action are avail-\nable in law and collective actions to drivers and their repre-\nsentatives? If as we have seen, external quit is not frequent\n(except for LittleBus), \"internal quits\" are used. But what\nabout the voice strategy?\nImplementation of the right to leave one's post.When an\nemployee has reasonable grounds for thinking that a work\nsituation constitutes a clear and present danger to his life or\nhealth or he observes that the protection system is defective,\nhe must alert the employer immediately and may leave his\npost (article L. 4131-1 of the French Labour Code). It is\nknown that this right is regularly invoked by bus drivers in\nthe event of physical attacks on themselves or their col-\nleagues. Such incidents are, incidentally, generally reported\nin the media. Thus, all SouthBus drivers returned to the depot\nduring a brawl between inspectors and passengers a year\nbefore we visited the company. Nevertheless, drivers in the\nsame company report that, if they are attacked, the radio link\nis now cut and the other drivers are not informed of the inci-\ndent: \"before, when there was an attack, all the buses went\nback to the depot. Now, since we're no longer informed of\nattacks . . . the buses just keep going\" (Driver).2 While the\nright to leave one's post is more readily accepted when there\nis a danger to physical health, its legitimacy in the case of\npsychological danger is acknowledged in case law. However,\nthe only cases mentioned in our interviews followed physical\nassaults.\nThe CHSCTs: Using all legal means of action.The CHSCTs'\nremit and the fact that the social partners are equally repre-\nsented on them make them the locus for social dialogue on\nworking and employment conditions. According to a mem-\nber of the CHSCT at SouthBus, \"It's not a bargaining body,\nwe're there to work together and move things on.\" CHSCTs\nseem, after all, to be perceived as a real partner on questions\nof health and safety at work, on which a certain degree of\nconsensus is apparent. In fact, in both the companies in\nwhich we were given access to a certain number of company\ndocuments, the CHSCTs function properly and are active.\nThe interviews in the other companies reveal the same degree\nof commitment. The quarterly meetings are held, annual\nreports compiled, and surveys carried out. The smooth run-\nning of the committees is reflected in the establishment of\nworking groups to examine specific issues or the appoint-\nment of a member to carry out a specific task. Thus, the sin-\ngle hazard risk assessment document was launched at\nTramBus with the participation of CHSCT members and\nworking groups meet to examine the causes of workplace\naccidents. On some issues, the groundwork can also be laid\nwith the company doctor or nurse (TramBus and\nSouthBus).\nIn the view of some managers, this mode of operation is\nmore productive than plenary meetings mainly because the\nindividuals concerned feel more committed. Thus, at\nSouthBus each of the elected members is allocated an area of\nresponsibility and has to report on progress every quarter to\nthe other members of the CHSCT. This co-construction is\nparticularly significant in this company, which has adopted a\nfairly informal modus operandi. Thus, we discovered that an\nagreement on the prevention of workplace hazards and health\nand safety at work provides for the establishment of a com-\nmittee for monitoring safety issues within the CHSCT (which\nis responsible for determining its composition and the fre-\nquency of its meetings). Now it emerges from the interviews\nthat, while the CHSCT is regularly informed and \"consulted\"\non working and employment conditions, it is not necessarily\nthis committee that is involved. Similarly, the annual reports\nrecord that \"only\" six extraordinary meetings were held in 3\nyears, whereas some members of the CHSCT said they met\nafter each incident. The chair and secretary meet very regu-\nlarly (about once a month, or even more often) to discuss\nhealth and safety issues or to make site visits although there\nis not necessarily any written record of their discussions or\nvisits. In their view, this way of working enables them to\nconnect the information gathered with conditions on the\nground. Together, they familiarized themselves with the sin-\ngle hazard risk assessment document, the arduous work\nforms, and exposure to chemical hazards forms. However,\nthe CHSCT has never implemented the notification proce-\ndure or ever asked for expert reports.\nThe CHSCTs also operate fairly systematically on their\nown initiative with regard to all health and safety matters,\nwhether it be compliance with safety standards, the cleanli-\nness of company premises, the state of the public highways\nor, of course, workplace accidents. This approach is usually\nbased on enquiries carried out by CHSCT members (\"as\nsoon as something happens in the company, even at the\nweekend, we're the first to be alerted . . . we immediately\nsend a standard letter and launch an enquiry . . .\"), or even on\nexpert reports. This is notably what the CHSCT at TramBus\ndid when a new form of work organization was introduced\nthat changed the length of the working day. The employer\nLouit-Martinod et al. 11\ntook the view that an expert report was not required and\nreferred the case to the courts. However, the case was dis-\nmissed, on the grounds that the proposal was complex and\nthat it altered the duties of many workers and the share of\nsubcontracting and hence the routes allocated to TramBus\nemployees and their shift start times. Finally, the expert\nreport commissioned by the CHSCT was used by the CHSCT\nand the union to discuss and change some routes.\nBesides these actions, the CHSCT at TramBus does not\nhesitate to resort to law.After all, the co-construction approach\ncomes up against its limits when the company does not fulfill\nitslegalobligationstoprotectitsemployees'health.According\nto a member of the CHSCT, \"first there's social dialogue, we\ntry to put something together, but if we're talking to someone\nwho doesn't want to speak with us or enter into dialogue, . . .\nthen it's legal action\" (Secretary of CHSCT). Thus, co-con-\nstruction is abandoned in favor of protest, with the CHSCT\nbecoming one of the arenas in which conflict finds expression\nand the initiator of numerous legal actions pursued with vigor\nand described as \"models\" of trade union action by the major-\nity trade union. Several legal cases have been brought alleg-\ning obstruction of the CHSCT's work, notably because of a\nlack of consultation before the introduction of a number of\nchanges to work organization. Thus, for example, when man-\nagement hired outside consultants to analyze the circum-\nstances surrounding accidents and other incidents and\nestablished a psychological support system for employees\nwho had experienced or were living with work-related stress,\nwithout having consulted the CHSCT, the CHSCT referred\nthe case to the courts. Its objective was to have the company\nordered to stop acting in this way, in particular because the\nconsultant in charge of providing psychological support was\nallegedly \"of debatable competence.\" This question of com-\npetence was also a component of a conflict between the man-\nagement and the occupational doctor (member of the CHSCT)\nwho was obliged later to quit the company. The judge found\nthat the CHSCT and the company medical department had\nnot been informed of these consultations. He ordered the\nemployer to suspend the consultant in charge of providing\npsychological support, despite the fact that a significant num-\nber of workers were availing themselves of his services. In\nour interviews with nurses, we heard some very contradictory\nopinions of this consultant and the CHSCT initiative, which\nwas sometimes regarded as purely negative. However, in our\n16 interviews of drivers, only one (a woman) quoted this fact,\nwith a clear reference to the lack of qualification of the con-\nsultant as said by the CHSCT.\nThe trade unions: Negotiation on psycho-social risks still\ninadequate. Besides taking legal action and offering advice\nto employees, the trade unions obviously have a role to play\nin terms of voice by negotiating at company level on matters\nof health and safety at work, and more particularly on psy-\ncho-social risks (Lerouge, 2010). Not everyone shares the\nsame vision of the approach to be adopted in preventing such\nrisks (Dedessus-Le-Moustier & Lerouge, 2011). In contrast\nto other sectors, however, the adoption of a prevention policy\nis a fairly long-standing issue in urban transport companies\nbecause of the risk of physical aggression toward drivers.\nThus, such prevention policies have been the object of sev-\neral agreements in the companies investigated. However, the\nagreements seldom take into account the psychological\naspect of the risks. The policies adopted still largely reflect\nthe standard \"tertiary prevention\" approach to health in the\nworkplace, in which the focus is more on mitigating the\neffects through agreements that seek to reduce absence rates\n(even when including specific measures on health and\nsafety), rather than on a \"modern\" policy of preventing risks,\nparticularly psycho-social risks. These agreements, which lie\nsomewhere between sanction and incentive, are not intended\nto improve working conditions and hence health and safety\nat work but rather to reduce absence rates. Thus, agreements\non profit sharing or career development include absences in\ntheir methods of calculation. For example, the SouthBus\ncompany agreement ties the overall level of profit sharing to\nthe reduction in absence rates (i.e., the fall in the number of\ndays' sick leave). This criterion, in conjunction with others\n(number of tickets sold, quality of service), is supposed to\nreflect the company's performance. The amount an individ-\nual employee actually receives is modified by his or her own\nlevel of absence, with a deduction being applied pro rata for\neach day of absence. Similarly, the TramBus career develop-\nment agreement states that \"obtaining the increments [which\ngive rise to pay increases] is dependent on attendance\nrecord.\" Interestingly, these agreements could lead to contra-\ndictory behaviors, such as choosing not to declare illness or\nstress, to keep the best premium.\nNevertheless, agreements on the prevention of occupa-\ntional risks have been concluded. At TramBus, a 2002 agree-\nment includes a clause committing the management to\nimprove safety at work, particularly with regard to dealing\nwith the psychological consequences of attacks. In terms of\nthe chronology of the legal changes, this clause (which was\nan annex to a wider agreement following a major strike about\npay and working time) could be said to be a \"pioneering one\"\n(p. 10). However, 10 years afterward, with new interlocutors\nand in a new context, we were unable to find any evidence of\nwhat had been done. Furthermore, in 2010, although it had\nnot been possible to conclude an agreement, an action plan\non psycho-social risks was adopted in consultation with\nworkforce representatives and trade union delegates.\nSimilarly, an agreement concluded in 2011 at SouthBus sets\nout the legal arrangements relating to the CHSCT, while pro-\nviding for the establishment of a committee for monitoring\nsafety issues, the right to notification, the right to leave one's\npost, and employee safety training and announcing the adop-\ntion of a policy for preventing psycho-social risk and stress\nat work. And even though the focus here is more on rectifica-\ntion than prevention, mention should also be made of agree-\nments on physical incapacity.\nConclusion\nThus, despite a reduction in working time in France and an\nindisputable improvement in the hardware, bus drivers are\nstill exposed to significant risks. Absences due to sickness\nand accidents at work are on the rise. Corroborating indica-\ntions of a deterioration in well-being have been recorded,\neven though the majority of those we met also noted that\nemployment conditions and pay tended to be fairly good.\nHowever, it is also known that in certain occupations, mostly\nmale-dominated and with a certain degree of professional\npride, there may be forms of denial or resistance in the face\nof stress and psycho-social risks (Bouffartigue, Pendari\u00e8s, &\nthe companies we investigated for employees to refuse assis-\ntance from a psychologist.\nOur results demonstrate how complex forms of work\nintensification, not all of which are the sole responsibility of\nthe employing company, can be new risk factors. The cus-\ntomer relationship, which in some cases has deteriorated, has\naltered the nature of the job. Our results also highlight a\ndimension that has received little attention in the literature,\nnamely, the relationship with other road users. Traffic jams\nand inconsiderate behavior by other drivers are regarded as\nall the more stressful as they are the product not of the ser-\nvice relationship with the customer but of a job that entails\nworking in an open environment that is sometimes perceived\nas becoming more and more difficult. This leads to a feeling\nof powerlessness as this open environment is only very par-\ntially within the employer's control.\nFaced with deteriorating situations, the majority of driv-\ners find the means to adopt within themselves and in the\nresources provided by their employer. Commitment to and\npride in the job remain, particularly because the pay and the\norganization of working time are still attractive.\nHowever, difficult situations still have to be faced,\nwhether individually or collectively. Some of these, as we\nhave seen, can be resolved by the exit response. This does\nnot usually involve quitting the company; rather, employees\nseek to construct opportunities to change route or job or to\ncircumvent the rules when the conditions are no longer\nbearable.\nOthers can be resolved through recourse to law or to the\nemployee representative bodies, a response more akin to\nvoice. This solution was commonly used in the large compa-\nnies investigated, but less so in the smaller ones. French law\nand institutions offer a fairly wide range of resources to sup-\nport the expression of employee voice. However, attempts to\nmake use of these resources often come up against the vague-\nness of the notion of psycho-social risk and the lack of debate\non this issue.\nThe obligation placed on employers in France to achieve\ncertain results with regard to safety has led them to put in\nplace prevention policies. Employee representatives should,\ntherefore, concern themselves more with these questions, as\nthey will not thereby diminish the employer's responsibility.\nAmong these representative bodies, the CHSCTs should\nfocus more on the question of psycho-social risks, notably\nthrough the single risk assessment document, which has been\nlittle used to date in the companies investigated. This should\ntake the form, in particular, of more training on these issues\nfor CHSCT members. Nevertheless, it be should be noted\nthat at the time the present article was written, French\nemployers and trade unions were engaged in vigorous\ndebates on the employers' proposal that these bodies should\nbe abolished to make them a committee of the works council.\nSimilarly, the law stipulates that the works council must be\nconsulted on general problems relating to working and\nemployment conditions and can put forward proposals. It\nshould, therefore, also be a key actor in the prevention of\npsycho-social risks. Finally, employee discussion sessions\ncould be introduced. After all, some drivers bemoaned the\nlack of opportunities to discuss the difficult situations they\nhave experienced with their colleagues. These free expres-\nsion sessions could be organized by the CHSCT or the works\ncouncil. This would also enable the CHSCT to meet more\nemployees as some CHSCT members did mention that one\nof the difficulties inherent in the job was that they were\nunable to see drivers as often as possible (in contrast to an\nactivity in which all the workforce is on-site).\nFinally, employee training is often put forward as a key\nissue (Baril-Gingras, Bellemare, & Brun, 2007). Although it\nis provided and is appreciated in all the companies investi-\ngated, it is sometimes perceived as a little artificial (simula-\ntion of assaults, for example) and not grounded in the\nfeedback received from drivers and the opinions they voice.\nThis is, more broadly, a key question for many authors, about\npsychological risks (Detchessahar, 2013) and the way by\nwhich they could be discussed, said, and by this way more\nprecisely defined.\nAs far as future research is concerned, some key questions\ncould certainly be investigated in greater detail. The first,\nfrom a comparative perspective, would be the various ways\nin which different national forms of public procurement\naffect the relationship between transport firms, the local\nauthority, and workers. The consequences for working con-\nditions will probably be different, depending on whether the\nsubcontracting affects a single route or an entire network. A\nsecond focus for further research would be to produce quan-\ntitative indicators of the new forms of intensification that we\nhave pinpointed through qualitative case studies. Last but not\nleast, it would be of interest to have more longitudinal data\non bus drivers'careers to understand what they had done pre-\nviously and what exit or voice solutions they adopted during\ntheir working lives.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nLouit-Martinod et al. 13\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research,authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nresearch was sponsored by the Paris School of Economics, through\na research agreement with LEST (Laboratoire d'Economie et de\nSociologie du Travail), the Institute of Labour Economics and\nIndustrial Sociology.\nNotes\n1.
