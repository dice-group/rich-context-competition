Follow-up data collection was\nsupported by the National Institute on Aging (P01-\nstrain the psychosocial resources (e.g., social support, feelings of control, optimism) that can be\nused for managing challenges [2]. Moreover, repeated encounters with stress may reduce the\nnumber of opportunities that individuals with low SES have to either develop or replenish their\npsychosocial resources [3]. With both more stressful experiences and fewer psychosocial re-\nsources with which to cope, worse health outcomes may ensue [4].\nDispositional optimism--or the generalized expectation that good rather than bad events\nwill occur [5]--has been characterized as a health asset. In other words, optimism can be con-\nsidered a psychosocial resource that may protect health over the life course [6,7]. This is based\nin part on a growing body of research indicating that optimistic individuals have reduced risk\nof heart disease and all-cause mortality compared with less optimistic individuals [8\u00ad10]. Sev-\neral investigators have also reported that optimism appears to be associated with social status,\nwith findings in non-U.S. cohorts suggesting higher optimism is associated with higher SES\n[11,12]. As a result, optimism has been put forward as a potential psychosocial resource that\nmay explain in part why higher social status is associated with better health [4,13\u00ad15].\nOptimism can serve as a mechanism by which social advantage leads to better health only if\nit is itself systematically patterned and produced by income, education, and race/ethnicity such\nthat those with greater social advantage have higher levels of optimism. However, although op-\ntimism is only partly heritable [16], relatively little is known about its distribution across the\nsocial structural factors that are so strongly linked to health disparities--hereafter called struc-\ntural factors [5]. This is partly because epidemiological cohorts do not typically assess disposi-\ntional optimism; they more often assess other psychological assets (i.e., indicators of positive\npsychological functioning) such as life satisfaction and positive affect. Limited research indi-\ncates greater optimism is associated with higher SES (most often indicated by education)\namong older community members [12] and adolescents or young adults [13,17,18]. But no re-\nsearch has systematically examined optimism's association with key structural factors contrib-\nuting to social disparities in health among U.S. adults including race/ethnicity, education,\noccupational class and prestige, and income.\nIn addition to prior work in British and Finnish cohorts suggesting that low SES is associat-\ned with viewing the future less optimistically [11,12], research with other indicators of psycho-\nlogical health suggests that while they may seem intensely personal, they are in fact patterned\nby structural factors. For example, low SES individuals are more likely to experience higher lev-\nels of depression and anxiety with greater frequency [19\u00ad21]. Moreover, life satisfaction is asso-\nciated with social advantage [22,23] such that greater satisfaction is linked with more\neducation and higher income [24\u00ad27]. Whites also tend to report being more satisfied than\nBlacks and Hispanics in the U.S. [26]. In sum, prior work indicates substantial social disparities\nin some of the most commonly assessed indicators of psychological health.\nThus, there is reason to suspect that dispositional optimism is similarly patterned by the\nstructural factors that influence access to resources and are linked with health disparities. We\nposit that optimism may be associated with disparities-related factors because these factors\nprovide a context for either developing or restricting optimistic tendencies. For example, opti-\nmistic people expect favorable outcomes, persist at goals, use effective coping strategies, and\nengage with attainable goals or disengage from unattainable goals [28]. Higher levels of educa-\ntion may foster such skills, as well as the opportunity for positive feedback loops to develop\nabout goal attainment that validate optimistic perspectives. By contrast, poverty and/or the ex-\nperience of being a racial or ethnic minority may suppress optimistic tendencies because indi-\nviduals encounter more demanding environments and have fewer resources to combat\nchallenges [20]. Because they are more frequently exposed to unpredictable and difficult situa-\ntions, individuals of low SES are more likely to develop a schema that the world is threatening,\nand therefore interpret ambiguous events with more negative and fewer positive attributions\nSocial Disparities in Optimism, Life Satisfaction, and Positive Affect\nno role in study design, data collection and analysis,\ndecision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\n[29]. Such experiences are unlikely to routinely foster upward spirals of optimism. Notably,\nSES is frequently perpetuated across generations [30,31], and this may extend to the corre-\nsponding cognitive and affective processes that are associated with lower social status [20].\nThus, in addition to understanding optimism's association with structural factors, it is also use-\nful to consider whether optimism is associated with the educational attainment of one's parents\nor responsive to social mobility.\nTaken together, our primary aim was to investigate dispositional optimism's association\nwith a set of social structural factors related to health disparities: gender, race/ethnicity, educa-\ntion level (of the participant and his or her parents), occupational class, occupational prestige,\nand income. Consistent with previous research, we expected that higher social position\n(e.g., higher levels of education and income) would be associated with greater optimism. We\nalso considered age-related patterning as health-related social disparities widen with age [32].\nFor comparative purposes, and because satisfaction and positive affect are more often included\nin large epidemiological cohorts, we also considered whether social patterning in optimism is\nsimilar to patterning with these psychological assets. Although numerous studies have consid-\nered the distribution of life satisfaction or positive affect across social indicators, few have com-\npared these patterns with those for optimism. Given the moderate to high correlations between\nthese psychological assets [33], we expected them to be similarly distributed. However, evi-\ndence that they are not similarly distributed might suggest that unique psychological assets are\nnot equally relevant for understanding how social disadvantage translates into\nhealth outcomes.\nA secondary aim was to use a life course perspective to investigate the association of each\npsychological asset with intergenerational continuity and change in educational attainment.\nEvidence from a Finnish cohort suggested that optimism was associated with intergenerational\ntrajectories of social mobility such that individuals with persistently high SES (present in child-\nhood and adulthood) were more optimistic than individuals with persistently low SES or who\nbecame upwardly or downwardly mobile [11]. We sought to replicate that finding with educa-\ntional achievement in U.S. participants, and to examine whether satisfaction and positive affect\nwere similarly influenced by intergenerational trajectories. To our knowledge, limited research\nhas considered whether different psychological assets are influenced by social mobility.\nMethods\nParticipants\nParticipants were men and women from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study.\nMIDUS was initially designed to investigate behavioral, psychological, and social factors\nin aging individuals. The first phase (MIDUS I) began in 1995 and included a national ran-\ndom-digit-dialing sample, oversamples from five metropolitan areas, siblings of the random-\ndigit-dialing sample, and a national random-digit-dialing sample of twin pairs (total N =\n7,108). Individuals were eligible to participate if they were non-institutionalized, spoke English,\nand were 25\u00ad74 years old. A longitudinal follow-up began an average of 9 years later in 2004\n(MIDUS II); 4,963 of the original MIDUS I respondents participated in MIDUS II [34]. A new\nsample of Blacks was also recruited from Milwaukee to participate in MIDUS II (N = 592). Our\nanalyses were based on MIDUS II data so Milwaukee participants could be included and be-\ncause a well-validated measure of dispositional optimism was assessed then. Thus, the initial\nsample of 5,555 included main MIDUS II and Milwaukee participants.\nThe analytic sample for the current analyses was further reduced by 1,140 participants miss-\ning data on optimism, life satisfaction, and positive affect. The three psychological assets were\nassessed with self-administered questionnaires returned by mail, so fewer participants\nSocial Disparities in Optimism, Life Satisfaction, and Positive Affect\ncompleted them compared with the primary phone interview. However, among participants\nwho completed the measures of psychological assets, the vast majority completed all items and\nover 98% completed at least two thirds of the relevant items in each measure (n = 4,415).\nAmong these participants, some were missing data on structural factors. Where possible, miss-\ning data on structural factors at MIDUS II was replaced with MIDUS I data. Thus, sample sizes\nalytic sample. Included versus excluded participants tended to be women who were older,\nwhite, educated, of a higher occupational class, and with higher household incomes. As a result,\nestimates of social disparities in the psychological assets may be conservatively estimated in\nthis sample. All respondents provided written informed consent. Original data collection was\napproved by institutional review boards at the University of Wisconsin Madison, University of\nCalifornia Los Angeles, and Georgetown University. Secondary data analyses were approved\nby the institutional review boards at Chapman University and Harvard School of Public\nHealth.\nMeasures\nSocial structural factors. Social structural factors were self-reported by participants at MIDUS\nII except for parental education, which was self-reported at MIDUS I for non-Milwaukee par-\nticipants. If social structural information from MIDUS II was not available, information from\nMIDUS I was used when possible. The social structural factors included gender (men, women),\nrace/ethnicity (white, black; other races were excluded), highest level of education attained by\neither the participant's mother or father, and highest level of education attained by the partici-\npant (each coded as less than high school, high school diploma, some college, college degree or\nmore). In addition, we assessed occupational class (managerial/professional, technical/sales/\nclerical/service, manual; homemakers and individuals not currently working were excluded if\ntheir previous job was unknown) and Duncan's socioeconomic index (SEI) as an indicator\nof the status of participants' current job or previous job if retired [35]. SEI was standardized\n(M = 0, SD = 1). Standardized scores of +1 (e.g., public administrators with SEI = 54.35), 0\n(e.g., postmaster with SEI = 39.84), and-1 (e.g., apparel salesperson with SEI = 25.37) approxi-\nmated high, average, and low prestige occupations, respectively [36]. Finally, we assessed\nhousehold income in U.S. dollars, which was further categorized into quintiles ($0 to\nFollowing previous work [11,37], we created four trajectories of social mobility across gener-\nations for the 1,959 participants whose parents had either less than a high school diploma or a\ncollege degree or more. We excluded participants whose parents were moderately educated to\nfocus on effects of either upward or downward social mobility, or stable SES from extreme so-\ncial-class origins. Intergenerational trajectories of education were categorized as persistently\nhigh (high parental education and participant education; n = 592, 30.22%), downwardly mobile\n(high parental education and low participant education; n = 292, 14.91%), upwardly mobile\n(low parental education and high participant education; n = 932, 47.58%), and persistently low\n(low parental education and participant education; n = 143, 7.30%).\nPsychological assets. Dispositional optimism was defined as generally having favorable ex-\npectations for the future. Although this is the most common way to define optimism, other def-\ninitions exist. These include, for example, explanatory style optimism and pessimism (i.e., the\npattern of attributions that individuals make about events in their lives) [38], unrealistic or\ncomparative optimism (i.e., an individual's belief that he or she is more likely to encounter\nSocial Disparities in Optimism, Life Satisfaction, and Positive Affect\npositive events and less likely to encounter negative events than others) [39], and situation-\nspecific optimism (i.e., having favorable expectations for a specific event) [40]. Despite using\nthe term \"optimism\", these three other definitions are weakly to moderately correlated with\ndispositional optimism and are considered distinct constructs [5,39,40]. In this study, disposi-\ntional optimism was assessed with the valid and reliable six-item Life Orientation Test-Revised\n[41]. Example items are \"I expect more good things to happen to me than bad\" and \"I hardly\never expect things to go my way\" (1 = agree a lot to 5 = disagree a lot). Although past work has\noccasionally derived subscales from the three positively-worded ( = .68) and the three nega-\ntively-worded items ( = .80; in the present study, the subscales were correlated r = -.44), we\nfollowed recommendations to use all six items to more fully characterize optimism [42,43] and\nto achieve higher internal consistency. An optimism score was derived by reverse coding items\nas necessary and then summing responses such that greater numbers reflected greater opti-\nmism (possible scores ranged from 6\u00ad30). Following MIDUS data conventions, if at least three\nitems were completed, a missing value was imputed with the mean value of the other items. In-\nternal consistency reliability in the present sample was good ( = .79).\nLife satisfaction, defined as judgments about life in general or specific life domains [44], was\nassessed with six previously validated items [45,46] that asked participants to rate their satisfac-\ntion with work, health, relationship with spouse/partner, relationship with children, financial\nsituation, and life overall (0 = the worst possible to 10 = the best possible). The two items regard-\ning relationship satisfaction were first averaged together and subsequently averaged with the\nremaining items for an overall life satisfaction mean [46]. Following MIDUS data conventions,\nif at least one item was completed, a mean score was computed with greater numbers reflecting\ngreater satisfaction (possible scores ranged from 1\u00ad10). Internal consistency reliability in the\npresent sample was acceptable ( = .72).\nPositive affect (colloquially known as happiness) was assessed in response to six items refer-\nring to the question: \"During the past 30 days, how much of the time did you feel. . .\" Items\nincluded \"cheerful\", \"in good spirits\", \"extremely happy\", \"calm and peaceful\", \"satisfied\",\nand \"full of life\" (1 = all of the time to 5 = none of the time) [47]. Following MIDUS data con-\nventions, a mean positive affect score was computed if at least one of the six items was complet-\ned. Greater scores reflected more positive affect (possible scores ranged from 1\u00ad5). Internal\nconsistency reliability in the present sample was excellent ( = .91). We also examined\npositive affect assessed with the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule [48] and the Mul-\ntidimensional Personality Questionnaire [49,50], but patterns were similar so results are\nnot discussed.\nStatistical Analyses\nDescriptive analyses were first conducted. Differences in mean psychological assets according\nto each individual structural factor were then examined with analyses of variance (ANOVAs),\nwhich indicate whether at least one level of social strata differs from the others. We also con-\nducted focused contrast analyses that tested a linear trend to reflect the expected social gradient\n[51]. These contrast analyses yielded Fcontrast\n(which provides the significance level for the line-\nar trend) and rcontrast\n(which provides the magnitude of effect for the linear trend). Multivariate\nmodels with all structural factors simultaneously predicting the individual psychological assets\nwere also conducted. The psychological assets were also examined in relation to social mobility\ntrajectories using ANOVAs. Because of sibling and twin pairs in the data, we conducted gener-\nalized estimating equations for primary analyses. Findings were nearly identical (data not\nshown), suggesting that clustering in the data did not bias parameter estimates. We present the\nunadjusted findings for easier interpretation.\nSocial Disparities in Optimism, Life Satisfaction, and Positive Affect\nResults\nSample characteristics\nParticipants tended to be white, have a high school education or more, be employed in manage-\nrial/professional or technical/sales/clerical/service positions, and have an average level of occu-\npational prestige (Table 1).

However, in general, par-\nticipants tended to report levels of psychological assets above the midpoint on each rating scale\n= 0.72). For example, the average participant experienced positive affect some or most of the\ntime. The three psychological assets were correlated (optimism and satisfaction r = .44; opti-\nmism and positive affect r = .44; satisfaction and positive affect r = .52).\nSocial disparities in psychological assets\nThe social structural patterning of the three psychological assets is shown in Table 2. Men and\nwomen did not differ in reported levels of optimism, satisfaction, or positive affect. The psy-\nchological assets were associated with race/ethnicity. Optimism and life satisfaction were sig-\nnificantly higher among Whites relative to Blacks. In contrast, Blacks reported higher positive\naffect relative to Whites. Optimism also seemed to be strongly patterned by other SES indica-\ntors. For example, optimism's association with education in one's family of origin was robustly\ngraded such that participants who had a parent with a college degree or more were the most\noptimistic compared to those who had a parent with a high school diploma or less. However,\nsatisfaction did not vary based on parental education. Moreover, a social gradient was not evi-\ndent for positive affect in the context of parental education. Counter to expectation, partici-\npants whose most highly educated parent did not complete high school reported the highest\nlevels of positive affect. Participants' own education level was significantly and positively asso-\nciated with optimism and satisfaction. Individuals with a college degree or higher reported\nbeing the most optimistic and satisfied compared with less educated individuals. For optimism\nin particular, the association was strikingly linear such that with each increase in education\nlevel, there was an associated increase in optimism. By contrast, positive affect was not signifi-\ncantly associated with participants' level of education.\nThe highest levels of optimism and satisfaction were evident among individuals with mana-\ngerial or professional occupations (i.e., the highest occupational class). Furthermore, both opti-\nmism and satisfaction had a linear relationship with occupational class such that manual\noccupations (i.e., the lowest occupational class) had the lowest levels and managerial occupa-\ntions (i.e., the highest occupational class) had the highest levels. By contrast, positive affect did\nnot differ by occupational class and a linear trend was not evident. Greater occupational pres-\ntige was also linearly associated with higher levels of optimism and satisfaction, but positive af-\nfect did not differ by occupational prestige. A similar pattern was evident for income.\nOptimism and satisfaction had a linear association with income such that individuals with the\nhighest income reported the greatest optimism relative to their less wealthy counterparts. Posi-\ntive affect was not significantly associated with income.\nMultivariate models that included all of the structural factors simultaneously showed nearly\nidentical patterns as the univariate models presented in Table 2 (data not shown). The percent\nof variance explained by all structural factors was 9% for optimism, 12% for satisfaction, and\n4% for positive affect.\nTrajectories of social mobility across generations\nDifferent patterns of optimism, life satisfaction, and positive affect emerged for trajectories of\nsocial mobility across generations (Fig. 1). Individuals with persistently higher education across\ngenerations had significantly greater optimism than the upwardly mobile, downwardly mobile,\nand persistently lower educated (post-hoc comparisons p < 0.05). Individuals with persistently\nlower education were the least optimistic relative to the other groups (post-hoc comparisons\np < 0.05). Satisfaction demonstrated a similar pattern with the persistently higher educated\nSocial Disparities in Optimism, Life Satisfaction, and Positive Affect\nTable 2.

We examined dispositional optimism's social structural patterning in the context of a\nsocial disparities framework and compared findings on optimism with two more commonly\nassessed measures of psychological assets in epidemiological cohorts: life satisfaction and posi-\ntive affect. Our hypothesis that social disparities in optimism would be evident was largely sup-\nported (although associations were modest), which is consistent with the reserve capacity\nframework [4]. Greater levels of optimism were evident among more socially advantaged indi-\nviduals--that is, those without minority status who had more education, higher occupational\nclasses and prestige, and larger incomes.\nConsistent with previous findings [25], optimism, satisfaction, and positive affect did not\ndiffer between men and women. However, the patterning across other social structural factors\ntended to vary, with optimism and life satisfaction generally similar (except in relation to pa-\nrental education). Whites reported the greatest optimism and satisfaction, whereas Blacks re-\nported the greatest positive affect. The highest optimism and satisfaction levels were evident\namong college-educated participants, but positive affect was not associated with educational at-\ntainment. Consistent with other studies, optimism was also greatest among participants with at\nleast one college-educated parent [52,53], although this association was of a smaller magnitude\nthan the other statistically significant findings. In contrast, life satisfaction and positive affect\nwere not linearly associated with parental education.\nWe also found that optimism and life satisfaction were patterned by occupational class such\nthat individuals with professional or managerial jobs were the most optimistic and satisfied.\nOccupational prestige also had a clear gradient with optimism and satisfaction whereby more\nprestige correlated with more optimism and satisfaction. This was not the case with positive af-\nfect, which conflicts with previous findings (but this could be due to differences in methodolo-\ngy including single sex samples and ecologic momentary assessment methods) [3]. Finally,\nconsistent with past work [54,55], optimism and satisfaction each demonstrated a positive, lin-\near association with income. Although we did not find a statistically significant association be-\ntween positive affect and income, previous studies report small associations and suggest\nincome's relation with affect is smaller and more unstable than with satisfaction [56].\nWhen examining intergenerational social mobility, the most optimistic and satisfied indi-\nviduals were those with high levels of education across generations (i.e., parent and participant\nwere both college-educated). These findings are consistent with those from Heinonen and col-\nleagues [11] who studied Finnish youth into adulthood, although they also found that the\ndownwardly mobile were more optimistic than the upwardly mobile and the persistently low.\nIn our sample of mostly middle-aged U.S. adults, those who were upwardly mobile were more\noptimistic and satisfied than the downwardly mobile. We also found that individuals with per-\nsistently high levels of education across generations did not differ in positive affect from those\nwith persistently low levels of education, the upwardly mobile, or the downwardly mobile. To\nour knowledge, only one other study has examined links between satisfaction and social mobil-\nity [57], and no studies have examined positive affect.\nand upwardly mobile, as well as the persistently low and the downwardly mobile. For positive affect, only the\ncomparison between the upwardly mobile and the downwardly mobile was significantly different.\nNote. Only participants with low or high parental education were included in these analyses (i.e., participants\nwhose parents were moderately educated were excluded).\nSocial Disparities in Optimism, Life Satisfaction, and Positive Affect\nDispositional optimism, life satisfaction, and positive affect are sometimes used as inter-\nchangeable markers in studies examining psychological factors in relation to physical health.\nOur findings suggest that such practices should be avoided, particularly if studies are investi-\ngating a possible role for psychological assets in explaining social disparities in physical health.\nThese measures are not proxies for one another as they have different associations with SES.\nOptimism was consistently related with structural factors, which is in line with the reserve ca-\npacity framework. Namely, higher levels of dispositional optimism were evident among more\nadvantaged members of society: white, college-educated individuals with higher occupational\npositions, prestige, and income. Satisfaction had a similar pattern, with the exception of paren-\ntal education. Compared with optimism and satisfaction, positive affect seemed to have unique\nassociations with status [56]. This could be because positive affect taps the emotional aspect of\nwell-being whereas optimism and satisfaction are cognitively-oriented. Alternatively, perhaps\nbecause affect has evolved to signal whether a particular stimulus may be beneficial or harmful,\nthe utility of positive affect may cut across different levels of SES. Moreover, optimism and sat-\nisfaction may be patterned similarly because they reflect more enduring characteristics com-\npared with positive affect, which may be subject to transient influences. Or, optimism's (and to\na lesser extent satisfaction's) emphasis on fulfilling meaningful goals versus positive affect's em-\nphasis on enjoying pleasure may be more strongly tied to social structural status and capacity\nto attain goals. Having the educational, financial, and other resources associated with higher\nstatus may further enable greater striving and more hopefulness about the future. Although\nthese speculations extrapolate beyond the current data, they could be investigated in future re-\nsearch designed to examine the association between psychological assets and structural factors\nimplicated in opportunities (or the lack thereof) across the life course.\nThe correlational design of the current study prohibits causal conclusions and the size of the\nreported associations could be considered small according to conventional guidelines. Howev-\ner, reported associations are comparable to other findings [58] and even very small effects can\nhave a large impact at the population level [59], especially if effects stemming from SES and\npsychological assets accumulate across the life course [60]. This study captures structural fac-\ntors at only a single point in time, so it is unclear whether a recent change in status (e.g., chang-\ning from employed to unemployed) is associated with changes in psychological assets. In\naddition, educated individuals were more likely to participate in MIDUS II [34], so reported as-\nsociations may be conservative due to selective attrition. Although study participants ranged in\nage from 30\u00ad85 years, most were middle aged. And, despite supplementing the sample with\nBlacks, the current sample was primarily White and numbers were not large enough to investi-\ngate other racial or ethnic groups separately. Generalization to more diverse samples may not\nbe warranted, although evidence suggests that optimism and other psychological assets are uni-\nversal phenomena [61,62]. In addition, findings related to intergenerational social mobility\nwere based only on education, not other status indicators such as employment status, occupa-\ntional class, or income [63,64]. Moreover, educational attainment in earlier generations may\nnot correspond exactly to education attainment in subsequent generations (e.g., a high school\ndiploma for somebody in the early 20th century may be equivalent to a college degree for some-\nbody in the mid to late 20th century).\nDespite these limitations, this is one of the first studies to broadly examine dispositional op-\ntimism in relation to one's socioeconomic position among mostly middle-aged U.S. men and\nwomen. Findings indicate that optimism is contoured by social structural factors related to op-\nportunity (i.e., race/ethnicity, education, occupational class and prestige, income, and social\nmobility), perhaps because such factors provide the context in which optimistic tendencies are\nshaped, developed, or used. Although associations between structural factors and optimism at\nfirst appear modest, they may have meaningful implications at the population level or as effects\nSocial Disparities in Optimism, Life Satisfaction, and Positive Affect\naccumulate across the lifespan. Indeed, the 4-point spread in optimism scores evident for the\nhighest versus lowest levels of participant education has been shown to translate into a 16% re-\nduced risk of myocardial infarction and a 30% reduced risk of heart disease-related mortality\n[9]. Thus, even apparently small differences in optimism can have critical health implications.\nWe also compared the patterning of optimism with two other widely assessed psychological\nassets, which has not been done previously. Although dispositional optimism is not routinely\nassessed in surveillance studies, findings reported here suggest that it may reveal unique in-\nsights about effects of social structure on health (among other pathways), and should be con-\nsidered for inclusion in future assessments. Moreover, given links between optimism and\nimproved mental and physical health [6,65], assessment of optimism may provide additional\ninsight into social disparities in health or other factors that shape capacity for positive adapta-\ntion in the context of adversity [66]. Because optimism and satisfaction appear to be related to\nsocial structural influences and health, they may be useful targets for both policy-oriented as\nwell as individual-level intervention strategies for improving population health. Furthermore,\nincreasing educational opportunities and otherwise reducing social disparities may not only\nimprove physical health, but may also foster greater psychological assets.\n"
