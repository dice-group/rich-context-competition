We examined associations\nbetween personality traits of the five-factor model (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and\nopenness to experience) and the risk of death from all causes through individual-participant meta-analysis of 76,150\nparticipants from 7 cohorts (the British Household Panel Survey, 2006\u00ad2009; the German Socio-Economic Panel\n(54.4% women) died (mean age at baseline = 50.9 years; mean follow-up = 5.9 years). Only low conscientiousness--\nreflecting low persistence, poor self-control, and lack of long-term planning--was associated with elevated mortal-\nity risk when taking into account age, sex, ethnicity/nationality, and all 5 personality traits. Individuals in the lowest\ntertile of conscientiousness had a 1.4 times higher risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.18,\n1.58) compared with individuals in the top 2 tertiles. This association remained after further adjustment for health\nbehaviors, marital status, and education. In conclusion, of the higher-order personality traits measured by the five-\nfactor model, only conscientiousness appears to be related to mortality risk across populations.\nmeta-analysis; mortality; personality; psychology; survival analysis\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; GSOEP, German Socio-Economic Panel; HILDA, Household, Income and Labour Dynamics\nin Australia; HR, hazard ratio; MIDUS, Midlife in the United States.\nEditor's note: An invited commentary on this article\nPersonality is associated with various health outcomes\n(1\u00ad4), and some studies suggest that personality differences\nmay also predict mortality risk (5\u00ad8). Personality represents\nenduring individual dispositions in domains of emotional\nreactivity, behavioral tendencies, and cognitive styles (9, 10).\nMortality risk, in turn, quantifies the total illness burden that\naccumulates from multiple health risk factors. Thus, investi-\ngating associations between personality traits and mortality may\nprovide insight into the most important links between per-\nsonality and overall health (9, 11).\nHowever, as illustrated by a recent literature review on per-\nsonality and mortality (10), few studies have examined mor-\ntality risk by using all the major dimensions of personality\nvariation at the same time. With some notable exceptions (6,\n12\u00ad14), these studies have been based on nonrepresentative\nand relatively small samples (10, 15) (i.e., data that are par-\nticularly vulnerable to chance findings and publication bias).\nGiven these limitations, currentlyavailable evidence is not yet\nsufficient for evaluating the public health relevance of per-\nsonality dimensions in explaining mortality differentials.\nTo undertake an assessment of the association between\npersonality and mortality, we pooled individual-participant\ndata from 7 cohort studies and performed a meta-analysis to\nexamine whether personality traits of the five-factor model\nAmerican Journal of Epidemiology\n\u00a9 The Author 2013.

The five-factor model is a widely\naccepted and validated conceptualization of personality (16),\nand it includes 5 higher-order personality traits--extraversion,\nneuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to\nexperience--that are assumed to capture the main dimensions\nof personality variation among individuals.\nWe searched the datacollections of the Inter-UniversityCon-\nsortium for Political and Social Research (http://www.icpsr.\numich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/) and the Economic and Social\nData Service (http://ukdataservice.ac.uk/) to identify eligible\nlarge-scale prospective cohort studies on personalityand mor-\ntality. The studies had to include information on participants'\nvital status and personality assessed with at least the brief 15-\nitem questionnaire based on the five-factor model. We located 7\nsuchdatasets,asfollows:theBritishHouseholdandPanelSurvey\nconsin Longitudinal Study graduate sample (n = 6,674); and\nthe Wisconsin Longitudinal Study sibling sample (n = 3,969)\n(22). These are well-characterized, longitudinal cohort studies\nwithlargesamplesizes.Allofthestudieswereapprovedbythe\nrelevantlocalethicscommittees.Associationsbetweenperson-\nality and all-cause mortality have been reported previously in\nthe MIDUS sample (12) but not in the other data sets. Meth-\nodological details of the cohorts are provided in the Web\nAppendix, available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/.\nIn all studies, personality was assessed by using standard-\nized questionnaire instruments based on the five-factor model\nof personality (16). The instruments measure 5 higher-order\npersonality traits that sum up individual variation in several,\nmore specific, lower-order personality dispositions. Extraver-\nsion reflects characteristics such as social assertiveness, socia-\nbility, and sensitivity to positive emotions; neuroticism is\nassociated with low emotional stability, sensitivity to neg-\native emotions, and anxiety proneness; agreeableness measures\ncooperativeness, altruism, and trust toward other people; con-\nscientiousness is expressed as self-control, orderliness, and\nadherence to social norms; and openness to experience cor-\nrelates with curiosity, broad-ranging interests, and open-\nmindedness.\nCovariates included in the analyses were ethnicity/nationality\n(0 = white or non-Hispanic and 1 = other; except in the HILDA\nSurvey and the GSOEP Study, in which 0 = native born and\n1 = non\u00adnative born); education (0 = primary level/less than\nhigh school, 1 = secondary level/high school, and 3 = tertiary\nlevel/higher degree); marital status (0 = married/cohabiting\nand 1 = single); leisure-time physical inactivity (0 = moderate\nor high physical activity and 1 = low or no physical activity);\ncurrent smoking (0 = nonsmoker and 1 = smoker); heavy alco-\nhol consumption (frequent alcohol consumption or alcohol\nproblems, depending on the study); and obesity (body mass\nindex (weight (kg)/height (m)2) 30 calculated from self-\nreported height and weight).\nAssociations between personality traits and mortality were\nestimated by using Cox's proportional hazards model. On the\nbasis of Schoenfeld residuals, we found no violation of the\nproportional hazards assumption for any personality trait in\nany cohort (all P > 0.08). Hazard ratios were calculated for both\ncontinuously coded standardized personality scores (mean = 0;\nstandard deviation, 1) and for personality scores categorized\ninto quintiles. Personality traits were examined both separately\nand after mutual adjustment, and all models were furtheradjusted\nfor sex, age at baseline, and ethnicity/nationality. To examine\nthecombinedrolesofsmoking,physicalinactivity,alcoholuse,\nand obesity, wecreatedacategorical sum scoreof the 4dichot-\nomous indicators of these variables and used this in the anal-\nysis.Analysesincludingothercovariateswerecarriedoutwith\nslightly smaller sample sizes because of missing covariate data.\nTo explore potential sources of heterogeneity in the associa-\ntions, we undertook the proportional hazards models in dif-\nferent subgroups separately in each cohort, and the results from\nthese subgroup analyses were then pooled. Although explor-\natory, these analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing.\nIn sensitivity analyses, we fitted proportional hazards models\nby using cubic splines to examine potential nonlinear associ-\nations between personality traits and mortality risk in more\ndetail than was allowed by categorization of personality scores.\nEach trait modeled with cubic splines was examined sepa-\nrately, adjusting for the other 4 personality traits (coded as\nlinear covariates), as well as sex, age, and ethnicity/nationality.\nThe pooled analysis for these models was carried out with\n1-step meta-analysis, that is, by first pooling the data and then\nfitting the models, stratified by study. Cubic splines with 3,\n4, and 5 knots were examined; the results are presented for\nthe 3-knot models because additional knots did not substan-\ntially improve the model fit.\nAll models were first fitted separately within each cohort,\nand the results from the individual cohorts were then pooled\nby using random-effects meta-analysis. Standard errors in\ncohorts based on household sampling were calculated by using\na robust estimator method to take into account the non-\nindependence of individuals from the same households. Het-\nerogeneity in the effect sizes was examined on the basis of\nI2 estimates. Meta-analysis was conducted by using the metan\npackage of Stata, version 12.1, software (StataCorp LP, College\nStation, Texas).\nRESULTS\nDescriptive statistics for the cohorts are presented in Web\nsubjects were women. In total, there were 3,947 deaths during\n(mean follow-up = 5.9 years; lack of information on exact\ndates of death in the MIDUS Study precluded exact calcula-\ntion). Kaplan-Meier plots of cumulative mortality risk in the\ncohorts are shown in Web Figure 1, and correlations between\npersonality traits are reported in Web Table 2.\nAssociations between continuous personalityscores and mor-\ntality risk showed that low conscientiousness was the only per-\nsonality trait independently associated with higher mortality\nrisk (Figure 1). This association was observed across studies\nfairly consistently, albeit not in all studies. In the pooled anal-\nysis, a conscientiousness score 1 standard deviation below\nthemeanwasassociatedwitha14%highermortalityrisk(haz-\nother personality traits, lower extraversion, higher neuroticism,\nand lower agreeableness were also associated with elevated\nmortality risk (model 1 in Web Table 3). Neuroticism and\nagreeableness were no longer associated with mortality when\nadjusted for conscientiousness (model 2 in Web Table 3), and\nonly conscientiousness remained associated with mortality when\nall personality traits were included in the model (Figure 1; model\n3 in Web Table 3). Adjustment for baseline health behaviors\nand obesity accounted for one-fifth of the association between\nlow conscientiousness and mortality risk (Table 1), whereas\neducation and marital status attenuated the association by less\nthan 10%. Together, the covariates attenuated the hazard ratio\nof conscientiousness by 31%.\nThere was moderate to large heterogeneity in the effect\nsizes across studies for conscientiousness (I2 = 73%), extra-\nness (I2 = 65%). The initial heterogeneity for openness to\nexperience (I2 = 70%) was reduced to 0% when the GSOEP\ncohort was excluded from the analysis. To examine whether\ninteraction effects between different personality traits accounted\nfor any of the heterogeneity, we examined all the possible trait\ncombinations (e.g., whether the association between extra-\nversion and mortality risk was dependent on the other 4 per-\nsonality traits). Of the 70 interaction effects tested, only 5 were\nstatistically significant at conventional levels (data not shown),\nand none of these was sufficiently consistent across studies.\nWe did not pursue these exploratory analyses further because\nwe had no specific hypotheses regarding trait interactions.\nSubgroup analysis\nSubgroup analyses indicated that the association between\nhigher conscientiousness and lower mortality risk did not differ\nby sex, ethnic/national majority versus minority, age, educa-\ntional level, number of behavior-related health risks, or self-\nreported general health at baseline (Web Table 4). For the other\n4 personality traits, the above subgroup analyses also suggested\nno systematic sources of heterogeneity in the effect sizes (Web\nTable 4). Of the 40 interaction tests undertaken, only 2 were\nstatisticallysignificant (P < 0.05),andbothinvolvedgeographical\nlocation; conscientiousness was not associated with mortality\nalthough higher extraversion was associated with lower mor-\n0.98) but not in the European or US samples. However, these\nresults need to be interpreted in light of the fact that the Aus-\ntralian estimate was based on only 1 study, and that 38 other\ninteractions were tested at the same time with no adjustment\nfor multiple testing.\nTests for nonlinearity\nIn the pooled analysis based on quintiles of personality scores\n(Figure 2), low conscientiousness was the only personality trait\nindependently associated with higher mortality risk.

Differences in mortal-\nity risk were largest when comparing individuals who scored\nbelow versus above the mean of conscientiousness and were\nsmaller among individuals scoring above the mean; catego-\nrization of individuals into low (the lowest tertile) versus high\n(2 of the highest tertiles) conscientiousness in each cohort\nhigher mortality risk in participants with low compared with\nhigh conscientiousness in the total sample.\nRegression analyses based on cubic splines suggested that\nscores for extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness to\nexperience that were below the mean level, and scores for neu-\nroticism and agreeableness that were above the mean level, might\nbe more strongly related to mortality risk than theresults based\non overall linear association across the total range of personality\nscores (Web Figures 2\u00ad6). When assessed with linear models\nthat allowed the associationstovary below versus above the mean\nlevel of personality score, the association for conscientious-\nness was slightly stronger below the mean (HR = 0.85, 95%\nthe respective mean levels for each trait were weakly associ-\nated with higher mortality risk, whereas no associations were\nobserved for neuroticism and agreeableness scores below the\nmean level (P for difference of below vs. above the mean = 0.07\nfor both personality traits; Web Table 5).\nReverse causality\nDeteriorating health in the years before death might\ndecrease conscientiousness, and such reverse causal effects\ncouldbiastheassociationbetweenconscientiousnessandsub-\nsequent mortality risk. To evaluate reverse causation bias, we\nexamined whether the hazard ratio of conscientiousness was\naffected when deaths occurring near the time of personal-\nity assessment were excluded from the analysis (the MIDUS\ncohort was excluded because of lack of information on date\nof death). The association remained largely unchanged when\ncensoring from the analysis all 621 deaths occurring within 1\n0.85, 0.96) of the personality assessment. This finding pro-\nvides evidence against bias due to reverse causality.\nDISCUSSION\nWith a pooled sample of more than 76,000 individuals from\nthe United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Aus-\ntralia, this is the first individual-participant meta-analysis of\npersonality and mortality. Our findings suggest that low consci-\nentiousness is associated with an increased risk of death from\nall causes. Individuals in the lowest tertile of conscientiousness\nhad a 37% higher mortality rate than individuals in the 2 higher\ntertiles of conscientiousness. The other 4 personality traits--\nextraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, and openness to\nexperience--were not consistently associated with mortality\nFigure 1.

The present finding on low conscien-\ntiousness and elevated mortality risk is in agreement with a pre-\nvious literature-based meta-analysis of nearly 9,000 individuals\nfrom 20 studies, in which conscientiousness-related traits were\nassessedwithdifferentmeasures(15).Thepresentstudyincludes\nunpublished studies and is based on a larger sample, adding to\nthe previous meta-analysis and suggesting that the association\nbetween conscientiousness and mortality risk may be weaker\nthan previously estimated. The previous meta-analysis (15)\nreported a pooled odds ratio estimate of 0.64 (transformed\nfrom a correlation-based effect size of r = -0.11, 95% CI:\n-0.17, -0.05), and another literature review reported a similar\npooled estimate of r = -0.09 (equal to an approximate OR of\n0.72) between conscientiousness and mortality risk (10). Thus,\n0.94)per1\u00adstandarddeviationincrementinconscientiousness\nestimated in our analysis is only about one-half to one-third\nof the previously estimated effect magnitudes. This differ-\nence is similar to previously observed discrepancies between\neffect sizes in published versus unpublished data in other\ndomains of psychosocial risks (25).\nTo test whether biological and behavioral mechanisms\nunderlie the associations between low conscientiousness and\nmortality risk, we adjusted the analyses for current smoking,\nphysical inactivity, heavy alcohol use, and obesity. The 21%\nreduction in mortality risk after this adjustment suggests that\ntheassociationofconscientiousnesswithmortalityismediated\nin part via well-established biological and behavioral factors\n(26\u00ad28). It has been hypothesized that highly conscientious\nindividuals are more likely to follow social norms and public\nhealth recommendations concerning health behaviors (29).\nGiven that conscientious individuals also have higher levels\nof self-discipline, it is reasonable to assume that they are also\nmore likely to adhere to health and treatment recommendations\nprovided by health professionals (30).

Interventions in children and adolescents have\nbeen effective in increasing self-control, a subcomponent of the\nbroader conscientiousness trait, by an average of 0.30 standard\ndeviations (41, 42). Assuming, again hypothetically, that the\nlong-term effects of such early interventions were 0.20 standard\ndeviations, and that these interventions were successfully tar-\ngeted at the lowest one-third of the conscientiousness distri-\nbution, one could expect the proportion of individuals with low\nconscientiousnessto drop to approximatelyone-fourth (assum-\ning normal distribution) and the mortality rate thereby to\ndecrease by 2.7% (proportion shift = [(PA\n\u00ad PB\n) \u00d7 (HR \u00ad 1)] /\n\u00d7 (HR \u00ad 1) + 1], with PA\nThese crude calculations suggest that the decline in the popu-\nlation mortality rate from reductions in low conscientiousness\nwould be equal in magnitude to decreasing smoking preva-\nlence by 3 percentage points (from 20% to 17%) or to increas-\ning moderate physical activity by 13 percentage points (from\n50% to 63%) in current populations. However, evidence on\nthe feasibility of long-term interventions to change personal-\nity is limited.\nMany early theories of personality and health have empha-\nsized the role of negative emotionality (i.e., high neuroticism)\nand interpersonal hostility (i.e., low agreeableness) in precip-\nitating poor health (1). A literature-based meta-analysis of per-\nsonality and all-cause mortality (10) suggested an increased\nwith 1 standard deviation of difference in negative emotion-\nality (or high neuroticism) and an increased relative risk of mor-\ndeviation of difference in disagreeableness/hostility (or low\nagreeableness). Surprisingly, we observed no differences in mor-\ntality risk associated with the overall variation in neuroticism or\nagreeableness, so our findings provide little support for these\nhypotheses of personality and health with respect to mortality.\nHowever,therewassomeevidencetosuggestthatveryhighneu-\nroticism may be associated with an elevated risk of death; this\nmight reflect the heightened mortality risk associated with\nclinical depression and other mental health problems (3, 40,\n43). Very high agreeableness also had aweak association with\nhigher mortality, which is in contrast to most previous find-\nings suggesting that a higher level of interpersonal hostility\n(i.e., low agreeableness) might be harmful for health (1, 10).\nGiven this unexpected direction of the association and the\nnumber of tests conducted, the nonlinear pattern for agreeable-\nness identified by our analysis may represent a chance finding.\nThe present findings for openness to experience are in contrast\nto a recent meta-analysis of 11 published studies (representing\nto experience is associated with lower mortality risk with an\nodds ratio of 0.88 (transformed from acorrelation-based effect\nsize of r = 0.051). Among the present cohorts, higher openness\nto experience was associated with lower mortality risk in only\n1.06). In the future, a more detailed analysis comparing the\nspecificpersonality measures,theirassociationswithotherpre-\ndictors of mortality (e.g., socioeconomic status), contextual\nfactors, and potential publication bias would be helpful to\nincrease understanding of these discrepancies in findings\nacross studies.\nOur study does not exclude the possibility that the \"Big\nFive\" personality traits may be associated with more specific\nphysical and mental diseases even if they are not associated\nwith mortality risk (1). Ourstudy is also limited by the fact that\npersonality was assessed by using only the 5 higher-order per-\nsonality traits but not their more specific lower-order sub-\nscales (16). It is possible that some of the higher-order traits\nare too broad to identify mortality differences associated\nwith more specific lower-order personality trait subscales.\nLiterature-based meta-analyses may be subject to publication\nbias resulting from selective reporting of positive findings. The\ncurrent data were pooled from all eligible large-scale longi-\ntudinal studies that we were able to locate from 2 publicly avail-\nable databases before performing any statistical analyses on\nthe individual cohorts. Thus, our sampling of the studies min-\nimized publication bias. There was evidence of heterogene-\nity in effect sizes across studies, suggesting that some of the\nvariation in effect sizes may reflect true differences between\nstudies rather than random sampling error. Stratified analy-\nses for conscientiousness suggested no effect modification\nby sociodemographic characteristics, including sex, age, and\neducation.

The magnitude of this association\nappears to be weaker than previously estimated (15), which\nmay reflect heterogeneity in cohort characteristics, differences\nin the personality instruments used to assess conscientious-\nness, and/or potential publication bias. Although personality\nhas been considered as a potential target for early-life inter-\nventions (41, 42), more detailed information on the feasibil-\nity, costs, and benefits of such interventions compared with\nother interventions directed at specific health behaviors is\nneeded to further evaluate the significance of personality var-\niation as an opportunity to improve population health.\n"
