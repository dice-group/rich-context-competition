Although high-\nspending areas have more physicians per capita, it is not\nknown whether this disparity fully explains the differ-\nences in spending or whether individual physicians in\nhigh-spending regions have a greater tendency to inter-\nvene for their patients. We sought to measure the ten-\ndency of primary care physicians to intervene across re-\ngions that differ in their levels of local health care\nspending.\nMethods: We used data from the Community Track-\ning Study Physician Survey, a telephone survey of a na-\ntionally representative sample of 5490 primary care phy-\n(response rate 59%). Local health care spending in phy-\nsicians' communities was determined by assigning each\nparticipating physician to 1 of 306 US hospital referral\nregions. The tendency of physicians to intervene was mea-\nsured by evaluating their responses to 6 clinical vi-\ngnettes in which they were asked how often they would\norder a test, referral, or treatment for the patient de-\nscribed.\nResults: In 5 of the 6 vignettes, physicians in high-\nspending regions were more likely to recommend inter-\nventions than those practicing in low-spending regions.\nFor example, for a 35-year-old man with back pain and\nfoot drop, physicians in high-spending regions would rec-\nommend magnetic resonance imaging 82% of the time,\ncompared with 69% for physicians in low-spending re-\ngions (P.001). For a 60-year-old man somewhat both-\nered by symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, phy-\nsicians in high-spending regions would make a urology\nreferral 32% of the time, while those in low-spending re-\ngions would do so only 23% of the time (P.001). Our\nfindings that physicians in high-spending regions have\na greater tendency to intervene persisted in analyses strati-\nfied by physician specialty (family/general practice vs in-\nternal medicine).\nConclusion: Varying rates of health care spending\nacross the United States reflect the underlying tendency\nof local physicians to recommend interventions for their\npatients.\nnition that health care\nspending varies widely\nacrosstheUnitedStates.Per\ncapita Medicare expendi-\nture in the areas of highest spending is\ndouble that in the lowest-spending areas,\neven though in some cases these repre-\nsent neighboring areas. Because higher\nspending does not appear to result in bet-\nter outcomes or quality of care,1,2 there is\nintense interest in understanding the rea-\nsons for the wide variation in utilization\nof services. Average illness severity var-\nies little across regions1; therefore, atten-\ntion has focused increasingly on the role\nof physicians who, through their actions\nand recommendations, control most health\ncare resources and thereby direct most\nhealth care spending.\nThere are, however, competing expla-\nnations of how physicians might contrib-\nute to higher health care spending. On the\none hand, high-spending areas have more\nphysicians per capita,3 and on average, pa-\ntients in these areas each see a greater num-\nber of physicians.1 Even if each physi-\ncian's shared ordering pattern is identical\nto those in lower-spending areas, utiliza-\ntion (and spending) per capita would be\nhigher in areas with a greater number of\nphysicians. On the other hand, physi-\ncians in high- and low-spending regions\nmay have entirely different ordering pat-\nterns. Specifically, physicians in high-\nspending areas may be more prone to in-\ntervene--to order tests, referrals, and\ntreatments--for individual patients.\nWe sought to determine whether phy-\nsician behavior is at least in part respon-\nsible for widely varying spending and\nutilization patterns across the United\nStates--that is, to what extent individual\nphysicians in high-spending regions have\na greater tendency to intervene for indi-\nvidual patients.\nAuthor Affiliations: VA\nOutcomes Group, White River\nJunction, Vt (Drs Sirovich,\nWelch, and Fisher); and the\nCenter for Evaluative Clinical\nSciences at Dartmouth,\nHanover, NH (Drs Sirovich,\nWelch, and Fisher and\nMr Gottlieb).\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

We then\nused data from a national physician survey to examine the ten-\ndency of physicians practicing in regions with different spend-\ning levels to intervene (to order tests, referrals, or treatment)\nin specific clinical situations.\nWe analyzed data from the second round of the Community\nphone survey of a nationally representative sample of physi-\ncians conducted for the Center for Studying Health System\nChange. The survey uses a complex design that includes 60 com-\nmunity sites and a small, independently drawn national sample.5\nUsing the master files of the American Medical Association and\nthe American Osteopathic Association, the CTS sampled ac-\ntive nonfederal physicians (n=12 280) in a variety of clinical\nspecialties who spent at least 20 hours per week in direct pa-\ntient care. Physicians in training were excluded.\nBecause the present study focuses on clinical decisions en-\ncountered in adult primary care, we included only primary care\nphysicians (identified by the CTS specialty designations family/\ngeneral practice and internal medicine) who care for adult pa-\ntients (n=5490). All physicians were surveyed by telephone be-\naveraged 21 minutes. The overall response rate was 61%; the\nresponse rate among all primary care physicians was 59%. Ad-\nditional information on the CTS Physician Survey can be found\nMEASURES\nExposure: Local Spending\nWe used as our measure of local spending the End-of-Life Ex-\npenditure Index (EOL-EI),1,2 a previously derived measure based\non health care expenditures in the last 6 months of life. The\nEOL-EI is calculated as age-, sex-, and race-adjusted spending\n(measured with standardized national prices) on hospital and\nphysician services provided to Medicare enrollees in their last\n6 months of life. We elected to use EOL-EI to compare spend-\ning across different regions of the United States because it is\nvery closely related to overall spending1,2 but unrelated to ill-\nness (every patient included in the measure had the same life\nexpectancy of exactly 6 months). In previous work, members\nof our research team have shown that the greater than 2-fold\ndifferences that exist across US regions in the intensity of care\nat the end of life are highly predictive of differences in overall\nspending but unrelated to differences in patient preferences at\nthe end of life8 or illness level.1,9\nWe calculated the mean EOL-EI for each of 306 US hospi-\nthen sorted in order of increasing EOL-EI and divided into quin-\ntiles of approximately equal population size based on the en-\ntire Medicare population aged 65 or older. Mean EOL-EI (cal-\nculated for each quintile by weighting each HRR according to\nits Medicare population) ranged from $9074 in the lowest quin-\ntile to $14 644 in the highest quintile. Based on the county of\nhis or her primary practice location, each physician was as-\nsigned to an HRR and in turn to a quintile of health care spend-\ning. Results are displayed using 3 categories for the exposure\nvariable: low spending (the lowest quintile of EOL-EI), mod-\nerate spending (the middle 3 quintiles combined), and high\nspending (the highest quintile of EOL-EI).\nOutcomes: Physician Practice Intensity\nOur analyses were based on responses to 6 clinical vignettes\nfrom the CTS Physician Survey. Vignettes were developed to\npresent discretionary decisions commonly encountered in out-\npatient practice--decisions that do not have a clear \"correct\"\nresponse.10,11 In each question, physicians were presented with\na vignette and a proposed intervention (a treatment, referral,\nor diagnostic evaluation) and were asked, \"For what percent-\nage of such patients would you recommend [an interven-\ntion]? Consider all your patients with similar clinical descrip-\ntions.\" Physicians could respond with any numerical percentage\nbetween 0% and 100%. Summary measures included in\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 represent the mean percentage of pa-\ntients for whom physicians in a given spending quintile would\nrecommend an intervention.\nAll reported tests for trend were based on linear regression in\nwhich the individual physician's response was the dependent\nvariable and the independent variable was spending in the phy-\nsician's region, expressed as a continuous variable. All analy-\nses used the appropriate weights and clustering information pro-\nvided by the CTS to account for sampling probability and\nnonresponse, such that the results presented here are repre-\nsentative of the population of nonfederal physicians providing\ndirect patient care to adults within the continental United States.\nAll analyses were carried out using SUDAAN statistical soft-\nware, version 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Tri-\nangle Park, NC).\nRESULTS\nThe sample of primary care physicians consisted of both\nfamily/general practitioners (57%) and general inter-\nnists (43%). Most were male (76%), middle-aged (mean\nage, 47 years), and board certified in their specialty (80%).\nThe most common practice setting was a solo or 2-per-\nRegions in the quintile of highest spending averaged\nThe supply of hospital beds and physicians of all spe-\ncialties was more abundant in regions of higher spend-\ning, with the exception of family practitioners, whose\nnumbers declined as local spending increased.\nPhysicians' clinical practice intensity varied accord-\ning to local health care spending. In 5 of 6 vignettes, pri-\nmary care physicians in high-spending regions were more\nlikely to recommend interventions than those practic-\ning in low-spending regions (Figure 1). The sole excep-\ntion was a vignette in which physicians across all spend-\ning levels were equally likely to order a cardiology\nconsultation for a 50-year-old man with new-onset ex-\nertional chest pain and positive results on an exercise tol-\nerance test.

For example, the average physi-\ncian in a high-spending region would recommend cho-\nlesterol-lowering therapy for 53% of men whose only car-\ndiac risk factor was a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol\nfor physicians in low-spending regions. As shown in\nFigure 2, the association between area-level spending and\nphysician practice intensity was observed for both family/\ngeneral practitioners and general internists.\nCOMMENT\nThis study shows that widely differing levels of health care\nspending across the United States reflect the tendency of\nlocal physicians to recommend interventions for patients.\nIn high-spending areas, physicians would order further\nevaluationortreatmentforapproximately10additionalpa-\ntients of every 100 patients seen compared with physi-\ncians in low-spending areas. This finding held true for ev-\nery clinical situation save one, in which the overwhelming\nmajority of physicians in all areas would have referred a\nmiddle-aged man with chest pain and abnormal findings\non an exercise tolerance test to a cardiologist.\nSeveral concerns may be raised about the present study.\nFirst, because the measure of our exposure--local spend-\ning--was based on utilization of Medicare services, it\nmight not accurately reflect spending for the remainder\nof the population (ie, persons younger than 65 years).\nHowever, prior studies have shown strong correlations\nat the area level between practice patterns for the popu-\nstate level between Medicare spending and total per capita\nhealth care spending.14\nSecond,ourfindingscouldbeinfluencedbysurveynon-\nresponse. However, the response rate of 59% compares fa-\nvorably with rates from other national telephone surveys\nFurthermore, for nonrespondents to account for the as-\nsociation between local spending and physicians' ten-\ndencytointervene,theirnumberandcharacterwouldhave\nto vary systematically with local spending.\nFinally, some may be concerned with the use of clini-\ncal vignette responses to measure physicians' tendency\nto intervene for patients. Ideally, practice intensity would\nbe determined by ascertaining physicians' ordering and\nprescribing habits for actual (identical) patients. How-\never, because individual patients and panels of patients\ndiffer from provider to provider, a comparison of prac-\ntice intensity based on actual practice is not feasible. Clini-\ncal vignettes provide a measure of actual clinical prac-\ntice that is inherently case-mix adjusted: every provider\nis \"seeing\" the same patient, portrayed in each vignette\nby an adequately rich patient description. Similar meth-\nods of presenting hypothetical patient scenarios form the\nbasis of other important provider comparisons, notably\nmedical board-certifying examinations.21-23 Moreover, the\nvalidity of using clinical vignettes as a method of assess-\nPatients for Whom Physican Would\nRecommend the Intervention, Mean %\nLow Moderate High\nRegional Spending Level\nConsider a 50-year-old man with a 1-month history of exertional chest pain.

All rights reserved.\ning actual physician practice has been demonstrated in\na number of studies comparing vignette responses to pro-\nvider behavior with standardized patients.24-26\nOthers have suggested that physicians in different geo-\ngraphic areas practice differently. Early work showed that\nthe aggressiveness of a physician's proposed treatment\nplan (in response to clinical vignettes) was directly as-\nsociated with the per capita number of physicians in his\nor her practice area (itself a close correlate of health care\nspending).27 Prior work has also shown that physicians'\nreported treatment and testing preferences for breast can-\ncer surgery28 and cardiac catheterization29 vary mark-\nedly across regions. Nevertheless, although it has long\nbeen estimated that physicians' decisions govern the way\nthat 90% of each health care dollar is used,30 uncer-\ntainty has remained about whether differences in health\ncare spending across regions reflect differences in phy-\nsician behavior. Our findings demonstrate that they do.\nWhile we have shown that physicians who practice\nin areas of higher local health care spending are more\nprone to intervene, we are unable to distinguish among\n3 potential explanations: (1) more aggressive physi-\ncians may be attracted to certain areas; (2) physicians may\nadopt the practice style (or standard of practice) of the\ncommunity where they locate; or (3) characteristics of\nthe market itself, such as greater difficulty maintaining\ntarget incomes in a more competitive marketplace, could\nlead to a lower threshold for referral and test ordering.\nDetermining which of these factors is primarily respon-\nsible should be the subject for further investigation.\nIt is unlikely that physician behavior is the sole expla-\nnation for higher levels of spending in some areas. Hav-\ning more specialists or more hospital beds in an area, for\nexample, likely plays a role in higher levels of local spend-\ning. It is also possible that--notwithstanding similar end-\nof-life preferences--differences in patient expectations and\ndemands across different regions impact the level of local\nhealth care spending via direct influence on physician de-\ncision making. However, in the present study we have been\nable to show that, when faced with the same patients, phy-\nsicians in higher-spending areas are more likely to inter-\nvene, and this undoubtedly accounts for some portion of\nthe higher spending seen in some US regions.\nPatients for Whom Physician Would\nRecommend the Intervention, Mean %\nLow Moderate High\nRegional Spending Level\nCardiology\nReferral for\nChest Pain\nInternal Medicine\nFamily Practice\nInternal Medicine\nFamily Practice\nInternal Medicine\nFamily Practice\nInternal Medicine\nFamily Practice\nInternal Medicine\nFamily Practice\nInternal Medicine\nFamily Practice\nTreatment\nfor Elevated\nCholesterol\nLevel\nUrology\nReferral\nfor BPH\nMRI for\nBack Pain\nPSA Screening\nOffice Visit for\nVaginal Itch\nFigure 2.
