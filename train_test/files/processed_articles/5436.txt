    "abstract": "Abstract\nGiven the potential attitudinal and behavioral impact of Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) conspiracy beliefs, it\nis important to understand their causes and moderators. Here, two explanations for the variation in these beliefs are\nengaged: the first is the choice among elites to frame AGW using the phrase `global warming' (GW) as opposed to\n`climate change' (CC); the second is partisan motivated reasoning. A theory is then developed about the role of trust in\nmoderating the impact of the two frames on AGW conspiracy beliefs. In the case of CC, which is perceived as less severe\nthan GW (and is therefore less identity threatening among Republicans), it is hypothesized that trust will moderate hoax\nbeliefs among Republicans. In the case of GW, where the implications of existence beliefs have policy consequences that\nare more unpleasant, motivated reasoning will `win out', and trust will not moderate conspiracy endorsement among\nRepublicans. The results from an original question framing experiment are consistent with the author's hypotheses.\nWhilst trust is a welcome commodity to those looking to persuade citizens to support AGW-ameliorating policies, it is\nnot a cure-all, especially in the face of elite partisan cues that edify pre-existing attitudes/identities and arouse a strong\ndesire to engage in motivated reasoning.\n",

However, contemporary elite\nbattles, with Republicans in the USA usually leading the\nopposition to Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) poli-\ncies, demonstrate a heightening partisan polarization\nthrough both policy stances and rhetoric (Dunlap and\n2010). Over the same period, American public opinion on\nmany different aspects of the AGW challenge has become\nsimilarly polarized: Republicans have sustained a low level\nof concern and low support for government-led policy\nresponses to AGW over the last two decades, while\nDemocrats have consistently become more concerned and\nsupportive of policy interventions over time (Dunlap et al.,\nattitudes polarized, but contemporary political debate on\nAGW has also seen a rise in AGW conspiracy theories\n(CTs) (Boussalis and Coan, 2016; Elsasser and Dunlap,\nthe right (e.g., Smith and Leiserowitz, 2012).\nConspiracies and misinformation are politically and\nsocially significant (e.g., Nyhan and Reifler, 2010; Oliver\nmation and conspiracies surrounding climate change are\nconsequential for myriad reasons (e.g., Uscinski et al.,\n2017), namely the clear linkage between conspiracy theory\nbelief and behaviors affecting the political system.

Here, I\nengage two explanations \u00ad elite framing of the terms `global\nwarming' (GW) as contrasted with `climate change' (CC)\nand partisan motivated reasoning \u00ad for the belief that AGW\nis a conspiracy or hoax. I then develop a theory about the\nmoderating role of trust, not only in AGW conspiratorial\nideation but also across GW and CC frames.\nFrank Luntz, elite framing, and the\nCC/GW distinction\nIt is impossible to understand fully the causes of beliefs\nabout the existence and/or seriousness of AGW without\naccounting for the different ways in which the AGW\nissue has been strategically framed by increasingly polar-\nized political elites in order to affect attitudes (e.g.,\nthe first explanation is elite-driven partisan polarization\nthe issue of AGW (McCright and Dunlap, 2011; Dunlap\nIn 2002, pollster and strategist Frank Luntz advised the\nBush Administration to frame its discussion of AGW using\nthe term `climate change' instead of `global warming'.\nLuntz (2002) suggested this because CC was naturally\noccurring and therefore `less frightening'. The logic behind\nLuntz's recommendation was to broaden the consensus in\nthe public that climate change was not that big of a deal. In\nhis strategy memo to Republican leaders, `Mr. Luntz urges\nthat the climate change term be used instead of global\nwarming because \"while global warming has catastrophic\ncommunications attached to it, climate change sounds a\nmore controllable and less emotional challenge\"' (Lee,\n2003). The recommendation was based in part on the pol-\nicy implications of the GW frame (the solution for which\nwould be much stricter anti-pollution regulations that\nwould affect businesses) versus CC (a naturally occurring\nfluctuation in temperature for which fewer, if any, policy\nfixes are needed). Thus, elite discourse conducted through\nthe CC frame would be less likely to lead to division on the\nissue inside the Republican coalition, leading to fewer\ncalls for policies antithetical to Republican values.\nPolitical operatives like Luntz know that the framing of an\nissue matters because it clarifies and condenses the issue for\nthe public (e.g., Nelson et al., 1997). In fact, framing experi-\nments confirm Luntz's assertions (but see Dunlap, 2014; Villar\nand Krosnick, 2011). For example, compared to CC, people\nare more concerned and worried about GW (Whitmarsh,\n(Whitmarsh, 2009), and are less likely to believe in its exist-\nThe role of partisanship and motivated\nreasoning in the AGW discourse\nHowever, the framing research described above obscures\nthe role that partisanship plays in the effect of strategic\nAGW framing on individuals' attitudes. Partisan framing\nis a conditioning factor in the delivery of information that\ndirects reasoning about that information: party elites can\npolarize the discourse by structuring the frames around an\nfact, compared to CC, GW evokes stronger ratings of neg-\native affect, greater worry, and greater perceptions of per-\nsonal and family threat among Democrats than Republicans\nKrosnick, 2011). In contrast, the gap in the belief in the\nexistence of GW versus CC is greater for Republicans than\nDemocrats, with Republicans being more likely to deny\nthe existence of GW than CC (Schuldt et al., 2011; Schuldt\nresponses is consistent with motivated reasoning: people\nwill engage in reasoning processes such as selective-expo-\nsure, counter-arguing, and outright denial in the face of\nidentity-threatening or counter-attitudinal information in\norder to protect, bolster or defend their pre-existing atti-\nWhen it comes to the impact of AGW seriousness and\nexistence beliefs on environmental attitudes and partisan\nidentity, Republicans would be expected to be more\nlikely to engage in motivated reasoning than Democrats.\nSpecifically, Republicans are less supportive of pro-\nenvironment policies than Democrats (e.g., Dunlap\net al., 2016). As such, Republicans would be expected to\nengage in motivated AGW conspiracy endorsement to a\ngreater extent than Democrats (e.g., Smith and\nLeiserowitz, 2012), to protect their pre-existing (anti-)\nenvironmental policy attitudes.2\nIt also stands to reason that Republicans would be more\nsensitive to the differences between the GW and CC frames\non conspiracy endorsement than Democrats. Given that\nGW evokes, on average, stronger feelings of worry, per-\nsonal threat and associations with severe weather than CC,\nbelief in the existence of GW would have more severe\nenvironmental policy implications in the direction anti-\nthetical to Republicans' pre-existing policy attitudes.\nConsistent with this reasoning, Republicans are less likely\nto believe that GW, rather than CC, exists, whereas\nDemocrats (for whom the policy and identity implications\nare more consonant with their pre-existing attachments\nand beliefs) do not distinguish between the two frames\nwith regard to existence beliefs.3 In summary, based on\nmotivated reasoning, the `default' is that Republicans\nshould be more likely than Democrats to believe that AGW\nis a hoax, doing so to bolster/protect their pre-existing atti-\ntudes and identities. Moreover, this motivated reasoning\namong Republicans should be stronger when the CT is\nSaunders 3\nframed as GW than as CC, because GW is more identity-\nthreatening to Republicans than CC.\nResearch has demonstrated that Democrats and\nRepublicans alike are willing to suspend disbelief and\nendorse CTs on all sorts of topics in the service of identity\nand attitude protection, thus demonstrating the power of\nmotivated reasoning (e.g., Miller et al., 2016). To believe\nthat AGW is an elaborate hoax, for example, one must\nbelieve in a vast conspiracy of elected and appointed gov-\nernmental officials, scientists, academics and journalists,\nall coordinating to perpetrate an elaborate lie for decades\nunwarranted conspiracy beliefs). If partisan-motivated rea-\nsoning affects AGW conspiracy beliefs similar to how it\naffects endorsement in other CTs, is there anything that\ncould moderate this process?\nThe moderating role of generalized\ntrust in motivated AGW conspiracy\nendorsement\nKunda (1990) argued that motivated reasoning (`direc-\ntional reasoning' in her language) was not as ubiquitous as\nmany contemporary scholars and observers perceived it to\nbe: `People do not seem to be at liberty to conclude what-\never they want to conclude merely because they want to...\nThey draw the desired conclusion only if they can muster\nup the evidence necessary to support it' (Kunda, 1990:\nin a balancing act between wanting to protect and bolster\ntheir attitudes/identities, and wanting to maintain an `illu-\nshine a spotlight on a heretofore under-examined factor\nwhich might moderate motivated reasoning, especially in\nthe context of conspiracy endorsement \u00ad generalized trust\n(in people, the media, and politicians and other political\nactors).\nWhy trust? As Hetherington (1998) argued, trust is more\nthan just an indicator of how much people like politicians,\npolitical institutions, and the like. Trust is an important\npolitical and social commodity. Interpersonal trust and trust\nin government are positively related to civic engagement\nand, thus, social capital (Brehm and Rahn, 1997). Trust in\ngovernment also fosters inter-party cooperation among\npolitical leaders (Hetherington and Rudolph, 2015). Trust\nis also negatively correlated with conspiracy endorsement\nin general (Miller et al., 2016). Not only does conspiracy\nendorsement require some level of suspension of disbelief,4\nit also requires a low level of trust in people, the media and\npolitical institutions to do, at best, the right thing (or, at the\nvery least, to not engage in secret plots that involve lying to\nthe public in perpetuity).\nWith regard to the AGW conspiracy theory specifi-\ncally, I argue that Republicans who might otherwise be\nmotivated to believe that AGW is an elaborate hoax (to\nprotect their partisan identity or pre-existing policy atti-\ntudes) will be less likely to be able to `muster up the evi-\ndence necessary'5 to do so if they also believe that people\nand political actors are trustworthy. This gives rise to\nHypothesis 1:\nH1: Trust will moderate AGW hoax beliefs for\nRepublicans (as trust increases, hoax beliefs will\ndecrease). For Democrats, as trust increases, belief in\nthe hoax will either also decrease or be unchanged\n(given the likely floor effect in hoax beliefs for\nDemocrats).6\nMiller et al.'s (2016) finding that trust moderates moti-\nvated conspiracy endorsement across a wide range of CTs\nimplies that trust could be a `cure-all'. But is trust powerful\nenough to mitigate conspiracy endorsement when the\nimplications for pre-existing attitudes and identities are\nstrong and salient? In other words, trust has promise as a\nmitigating factor regarding motivated conspiracy endorse-\nment; does it also have limits?\nWith regard to AGW hoax beliefs, the effect of trust may\nbe more nuanced than previous research suggests.7 As\nreviewed above, the desire to engage in motivated conspir-\nacy endorsement when the issue is framed as being about\nGW is likely to be stronger for Republicans (compared to\nthe CC frame) because the policy and identity implications\nare much more unpleasant. Therefore, I hypothesize that\nthe two-way interaction between generalized trust and\nparty identification (H1) will be qualified by a three-way\ninteraction between trust, party identification and hoax\nframe. Specifically, generalized trust will moderate moti-\nvated conspiracy endorsement among Republicans when it\ncomes to CC, but will not have a similar moderating effect\nwhen it comes to GW. In the balancing act between iden-\ntity/attitude protection (motivated reasoning) and maintain-\ning an illusion of objectivity (thus rejecting that trustworthy\nactors would engage in conspiracies), maintaining an illu-\nsion of objectivity will `win out' with regard to CC (when\nRepublicans' identities are less threatened), whereas iden-\ntity/attitude protection will `win out' with regard to GW\n(when Republicans' identities are more threatened). Hence\nI offer Hypothesis 2:\nH2: For Republicans, trust will have a larger negative\neffect on the belief that CC is a hoax than the belief that\nGW is a hoax. For Democrats, trust will have either no\neffect (because of the potential floor in endorsement) or\na negative effect on both the CC and GW question\nframes.\nDescription of study and measures\nTo test these hypotheses, I analyzed an original online sur-\nvey experiment of 2316 Republicans and Democrats\n4 Research and Politics \nadministered between 21 November and 13 December\n2013 via Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The\nuse of MTurk in social science research is growing in popu-\nlarity because it provides access to more demographically\ndiverse samples of the US voting-age population than other\ncommonly-used convenience samples, and provides high-\nquality data (e.g., Clifford et al., 2015; Huff and Tingley,\nExperimental manipulation and dependent\nvariable\nRespondents were randomly assigned to receive one of two\nCT question frames: `Some people believe that [global\nwarming/climate change] is a hoax. Others do not believe\nthis. What do you think?' Responses were coded such that\n1 = `definitely not a hoax', 2 = `probably not a hoax', 3 =\n`probably is a hoax', and 4 = `definitely a hoax', which\nRepublicans) respondents were assigned to the GW condi-\nassigned to the CC condition.\nExplanatory variables\nThe primary explanatory variables of interest are party\nidentification and generalized trust. For party identifica-\ntion, the standard seven-point partisanship measure was\nrecoded into a Republican dummy variable with `leaners'\ncoded as partisans (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat; pure\nIndependents were dropped from the analyses).\nThe trust index is an average of responses to four ques-\ntions (coded on four-point scale ranging from 0\u00ad1 such\nthat higher numbers equal greater trust) which assessed\nhow much of the time respondents thought that (1) the fed-\neral government, (2) law enforcement, (3) the media and\n(4) people in general can be trusted to do what is right\nTo isolate the effects of trust, analyses below control for\nthe following (all coded to range from 0\u00ad1): political\nknowledge, authoritarianism, efficacy, need for cognition,\nneed for evaluation, assessment of federal power, religios-\nity, education, income, gender, age, ethnicity/race and the\nUsing OLS, I estimated the two-way interaction between\nparty identification and trust to test H1 (that the party iden-\ntification effect on AGW hoax belief will be moderated by\ngeneralized trust, regardless of question framing). The\ninteraction is positive and statistically significant (b =\nthe shape of the interaction. Consistent with H1, general-\nized trust is negatively associated with hoax beliefs among\nowing to a floor effect on hoax beliefs). Generalized trust\nmoderates AGW hoax beliefs among Republicans.\nModel 2 in Table 1 reports the test of H2 (that for\nRepublicans, trust will have a larger negative effect on the\nbelief that CC is a hoax than the belief that GW is a hoax.\nFor Democrats, trust will have either a flat or negative\neffect on both the CC and GW question frames). The inter-\naction between party identification, trust, and question\nframe is positive and statistically significant (b = 0.47, se\n= 0.20). The shape of the interaction confirms H2 (see\nFigure 2).12 Among Democrats the trust slopes for GW and\nCC hoax frame are both negative and not statistically\nsignificantly different from one another (b = -0.03,\nse = 0.06 for the `trust x question'frame interaction among\nDemocrats). Among Republicans, the effect of trust on\nbelief that CC is a hoax is negative and quite large (b =\nquestion drops from 0.61 to near 0 when moving across the\nfull range of the trust scale. In contrast, the trust effect on\nGW hoax beliefs among Republicans is negative, but not\ntrust slopes are statistically significantly different, one\nfrom the another (b = 0.49, se = 0.18 for the `trust x ques-\ntion' frame interaction among Republicans). In the case of\nCC, which sounds less threatening and less severe than\nglobal warming, trust mitigates hoax beliefs. In contrast, in\nthe case of GW, where the implications of belief have\nmuch more unpleasant policy consequences, motivated\nreasoning `wins out', and trust does not mitigate conspir-\nacy endorsement among Republicans.14\nTo clarify these differences further, Figure 3 shows the\ndifferential (GW minus CC) between the effect of trust\nbetween the two frames across partisans. Figure 3 demon-\nstrates a completely flat, insignificant finding for Democrats\nacross the experimental conditions, while showing a\ntrust Republicans when the GW frame is used instead of the\nCC frame. Among high trust Republicans, an increase of\nis used instead of the CC frame.\nDiscussion\nTo summarize, I argue that the strategic framing choices\nmade by Republican elites rely on the motivated reasoning\nof their partisans to reinforce and perpetuate the belief that\nAGW is a hoax. Under the conditions that activate moti-\nvated reasoning, it is likely that it has become more and\nmore difficult for Republican voters to support policies that\n(and candidates who) would take steps to address the AGW\nissue. Moreover, I find that trust moderates AGW hoax\nbeliefs among Republicans, but only under the less iden-\ntity-threatening CC frame.\nSaunders 5\nWith regard to CT beliefs in general, these findings raise\nan interesting proposition: perhaps identity threat is a key\nto understanding the conditions under which motivated CT\nbelief are going to be the strongest, and when factors such\nas trust may mitigate such beliefs. Research on the anteced-\nents of CT beliefs has yet to address systematically the\nimpact of the ways in which CTs vary (e.g., the number of\npeople involved, the time horizon for the conspiracy,\nwhether the theorized conspiracy is with regard to a dis-\ncrete event or is more wide-ranging) on the strength and\npersistence of endorsement (but see Grimes, 2016; and\nKeeley, 1999). The research reported here suggests that the\ndegree to which a CT implicates people's attitudes and/or\nidentities may affect the motivation to believe the CT in\ngeneral, and the ways in which variables such as trust mod-\nerate such beliefs. With regard to AGW CT beliefs in par-\nticular, as discussed more extensively above, these findings\nreinforce the existing evidence that partisans' beliefs are\nstrongly affected by elite cues on this issue \u00ad the frames\nthat Republican elites use to talk about GW/CC matter.\nThe findings about trust presented here also offer a\npotential path to reconciling conflicting findings (e.g.,\nabout whether or not the CC versus GW frame conditions\nthe effect of partisanship (Democrat versus Republican) on\nbelief in the existence of AGW. Whereas Schuldt and col-\nence beliefs is larger for the GW than the CC frame, Dunlap\n(2014) found no impact of the GW/CC frames. None of\nthose studies took trust into account as a potential modera-\ntor of beliefs; perhaps, if they had, their results might have\nbeen more consistent across the studies. Future research\nshould explore whether the evidence of trust effects noted\nTable 1.

Three-way interaction between party identification, question frame, and trust.\nFigure 3. The difference in the marginal effects of the GW/CC treatment across partisans.\nSaunders 7\nhere, with regard to belief in conspiracy theories, general-\nize to questions about the existence of AGW that do not\nexplicitly raise the spectre of conspiracy.\nIn conclusion, for those looking for ways to persuade\nthose who believe in the extremely cynical scenario that\nAGW is a hoax to think otherwise, attempts to increase\ntrust combined with strategic use of the climate change\nframe are likely to be most fruitful. However, given the\nrecent notable declines in trust in our institutions and others\n(Hetherington and Rudolph, 2015), the prospects for\nincreasing trust appear quite dim. Conversely, for those\nlooking for ways to reinforce beliefs that AGW is a con-\nspiratorial hoax and/or persuade others to follow their\ncause, the prescription is simpler, if not more harrowing.\nHetherington and Rudolph (2015) showed that political dis-\ntrust in the electorate and between partisan elites had con-\nstrained the policy options available to legislators in our\npolarized political environment. As such, there is no need\nto attack AGW head on in order to accomplish the goals of\nsubverting pro-AGW policy attitudes in the electorate;\nundermining trust and facilitating partisan motivated rea-\nsoning (through the strategic use of the GW frame) should\nbe sufficient. Furthermore, the tendency for people to seek\nout information that confirms their predispositions means\nthat they rarely venture outside of their ideological echo\nchambers (Feldman et al., 2014). Thus, CTs (such as that\nAGW is a hoax) have a self-reinforcing quality. As such,\nmuch of the research on the antecedents and consequences\nof CT endorsement leads to the unfortunate conclusion that\nthese beliefs are close to intractable and may only be\nresponsive to Republican elite persuasion, and barring that,\nlife experience and the observation of ecological tragedy.\n"
