A total of 30 fathers were recruited from a support/mentoring\ngroup and from the general population to complete a semi-structured, audio-taped interview. A content analysis revealed\nthat both groups of fathers were committed to maintaining a relationship with their children, and that by being present,\nthey protected their children, helped them emotionally and financially, helped in their overall development, acted as a role\nmodel, and shared parenting responsibilities with their children's mothers. Factors that facilitated parenting for resident and\nnonresident fathers included receiving proper guidance about fathering, a positive mother-father relationship, support from\nfamily, and church. Inhibiting factors were more prevalent for nonresident fathers that included mothers obstructing the\nfather-child relationship, negative views/remarks about them as fathers, father-child visitation that is contingent upon child\nsupport, and fathers' financial difficulties. The findings suggest a need for coparenting counseling, faith-based interventions,\nand employment services to address the complex socio-economic challenges that fathers face.\n",

Yet, according to the\nU.S. Census Bureau, a third of their children grow up with-\nout biological fathers in their lives (U.S. Census Bureau,\n2012a). When fathers are absent or uninvolved in their chil-\ndren's lives, this may have deleterious effects on their chil-\ndren's psychosocial development (Flouri, 2005). These\nchildren are more likely to live in poverty, drop out of school,\nand engage in risky behaviors like using alcohol, tobacco,\nand illicit drugs (Nock & Einolf, 2008; Rosenberg & Wilcox,\n2006). In addition, they are more likely to enter the juvenile\njustice system and more likely to be incarcerated later in life\ninvolvement contributes positively to numerous psychoso-\ncial and developmental outcomes in children (Lamb, 2010,\nResearch shows that fathers can be as competent as moth-\ners in their direct (e.g., caretaking) and indirect (e.g., finan-\ncial support) parenting (Lamb, 2010). However, fathers face\na number of barriers with parenting their children, including\nlack of parenting skills, personal problems, issues with the\nchildren's mothers, and societal impacts such as economic\nchallenges. There is a fair amount of research about barriers\nto father involvement that often reveal others'negative views\nabout fathers' contributions and potential (Malm, Murray, &\nD'Aunno, & Thornton, 2005). Typically, these studies con-\nsist of data solicited from the children's mothers, social ser-\nvice workers, or other sources--but not from the fathers.\nThis study explored resident and nonresident fathers' per-\nspectives about factors that facilitated or inhibited their abil-\nity to play a positive and active role in their children's lives.\nLiterature Review\nFatherhood Roles\nIn our society, fathers are often viewed negatively in regard\nto nurturing and emotional support, because these roles are\n1University of Illinois at Chicago, IL, USA\n2University of North Carolina at Greensboro, NC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nTanya M.

Some researchers have\nfound that some fathers do not have a relationship with their\nchildren because the children's mothers limit fathers' oppor-\ntunities to engage with their children (Allen & Hawkins,\nwith their own beliefs and expectations for relationships with\ntheir children. Before men become fathers, they form their\nideas about fathering based on the way their own fathers par-\nented them (Coakley, in press; Lamb, 2010; Marsiglio,\n2004). Fathers either want to emulate their own fathers' par-\nenting because they admire their fathers' way of parenting or\nthey reject their fathers' way of parenting because it had a\nnegative impact on their childhood. Men thus form their\nideas about the type of parent they want to be. They might\nidentify as a father in a good relationship with the children's\nmother jointly raising their children. Or they might identify\nas someone who will have unconventional parenting strate-\ngies as a single or nonresident father. If fathers do not have\npositive examples of successful parenting, they often con-\ntinue a cycle of absenteeism or poor parental involvement.\nTheir conceptualizations thus help explain differences in the\nlevel of involvement fathers have with their children\nTypically, fathers assume the role of protector and bread-\nwinner. However, they are increasingly supporting their fam-\nilies in a nontraditional caregiving role. Some researchers\nassert that the distinctiveness of gender-specific roles is\nimportant, while others contend that the characteristics of the\nfather as a parent are more important than the characteristics\nof the father as a man (Lamb, 2010). Once men become\nfathers, their perspective on fathering and fatherhood is\ninfluenced by their personal experiences, which include their\nrelationships with their children and the children's mothers.\nMother-Father Relationship\nA father who has a good relationship with the mother of his\nchildren is more likely to be involved, spend time with his\nchildren, and have children who are psychosocially and emo-\ntionally healthier (Rosenberg & Wilcox, 2006). Similarly, a\nmother who feels affirmed by her children's father and is\nhappy with the relationship is more likely to be a good\nmother. The quality of the mother-father relationship thus\naffects the parenting behavior of both parents. In good rela-\ntionships, they are more responsive, affectionate, and confi-\ndent with their infants; more self-controlled in dealing with\ndefiant toddlers; and better confidants for teenagers seeking\nadvice and emotional support (Rosenberg & Wilcox, 2006).\nConversely, research shows that children are more likely to\nbe anxious, withdrawn, or antisocial when their father dis-\nplays anger toward their mother or refuses to cooperate or\ncommunicate with her (Gable, Crnic, & Belsky, 1994;\nFathers who treat the mothers of their children with respect\nand deal appropriately with conflict in the relationship are\nmore likely to have boys who understand how they ought to\ntreat women and are less likely to act aggressively toward\nfemales. Girls with involved, respectful fathers see how they\nshould expect men to treat them and are less likely to become\ninvolved in violent or unhealthy relationships. In contrast,\nhusbands who display anger or use the silent treatment are\nmore likely to have children who are anxious, withdrawn, or\nIt is imperative that fathers interact with mothers amica-\nbly because mothers are considered to be the \"gatekeepers\"\np. 68; Schoppe-Sullivan, Brown, Cannon, Mangelsdorf, &\nSokolowski, 2008). For instance, mothers have the power to\ncontrol the overall manner in which children are raised,\nincluding the amount of contact they have with their fathers.\nAccording to the Center for Research on Child Well-Being\n(2007), mothers' perceptions of fathers' trustworthiness\ninfluences fathers' involvement with their children. Fathers\nwhom mothers deem untrustworthy to care for their children\nare less engaged in activities with their children than fathers\nwho are considered trustworthy. Thus mothers play a crucial\nrole in facilitating the father\u00adchild relationship (Arendell,\nEconomic Challenges\nHistorically, U.S. social welfare policy and programs, such as\npublic assistance, have provided financial assistance to chil-\ndren and families who live in poverty. Very few Federal pro-\ngrams are specifically targeted to assist fathers. Because of\nsocietal expectations for men to assume the role as a financial\nprovider and to be self-sufficient (Harris & Marmer, 1996),\nthe inclusion of men in social welfare policies entails holding\nthem accountable for financially supporting their children.\nThis may be due to the popular opinion in society that moth-\ners are biologically bound to carry out the role of caretaker to\ntheir offspring, and thus are more deserving of government\nassistance to support their children than fathers in similar situ-\nations (Coakley, 2013). The emphasis of public policy is\nmainly on identifying the fathers of children in care to enforce\norders for child support payments (Day & Lamb, 2004).\nThis is unfortunate, because single fathers comprise\nnearly 1.7 million of the U.S. population of fathers, and\nmany experience problems that are economically based. The\nrecent economic recession had a devastating effect on non-\ncustodial fathers, many of whom had difficulties securing\nfull-time employment during the recession. According to the\n2010 U.S. Census report, the number of men working full-\ntime jobs throughout the year was 6.6 million lower than in\n2007 (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, Smith, & U.S. Census Bureau,\n2011). This is important to note because employment and\nincome are the strongest predictors of payment of child sup-\nport (Nelson, 2004): Thus, fathers who are unemployed or\nwho have low incomes are more likely to be penalized for\nnonpayment of child support.\nRoberts et al. 3\nPrevious research has indicated that fathers encounter\nvarious barriers to parenting their children. Some barriers are\npersonal or interpersonal, and some are imposed by society,\nsuch as economic challenges. We explored resident and non-\nresident fathers' perceptions about these factors believed to\nfacilitate or inhibit their ability to play a positive and active\nrole in their children's lives.\nMethod\nStudy Design and Sample\nThis was a cross-sectional, qualitative study of 30 fathers\nfrom two North Carolina counties. The Institutional Review\nBoard from the authors' university approved all study proce-\ndures for the requirements of human participants. Data were\nconsisted of resident and nonresident fathers from a fathers'\nsupport/mentoring group and fathers from the general popu-\nlation recruited using convenience and snowball sampling\nmethods. All fathers were at least 18 years old and had at\nleast one child age 18 years or younger.\nRecruitment\nThe Guilford County Fatherhood Coalition assisted with\nrecruitment by distributing study flyers to members in their\nvoluntary fatherhood support/mentoring groups. In addition,\nparticipants recommended the study to their acquaintances\nwho also were fathers. Potential participants contacted the\nresearchers by telephone or email, leaving their names and\ntelephone numbers. The researchers contacted the fathers by\ntelephone and read the consent form to them over the phone.\nThe interviewer then sent the informed consent form to them\nvia U.S. mail or email if the fathers wanted to participate in\nthe study. Participation was strictly voluntary.\nData Collection\nPrior to their participation, the fathers were read the informed\nconsent form by the researcher again, in person. They were\nasked to sign it if they still agreed to participate. Next, the\nfathers were asked 10 questions regarding their socio-demo-\ngraphic background, including race, age, and marital status.\nThen an audio-taped, semi-structured interview was con-\nducted either on campus in a private conference room, or in\nthe privacy of the participants' homes, if they preferred.\nParticipants answered the 10 open-ended questions regard-\ning their views on fatherhood and factors in their lives that\nhad helped them as a parent or created barriers to parenting.\nThe interviews lasted, on average, 30 min. Participants were\ngiven a US$10 gift card to Walmart on completion of their\ninterview and a father resource guide of helpful community\nsupports for parenting education, counseling, support groups,\nchild support information, and employment information.\nData Analysis\nThe criteria used to help substantiate the trustworthiness of\nqualitative findings include credibility, or accurately describ-\ning and interpreting participants'accounts, variability of par-\nticipants' accounts, neutrality/unbiased methods, and\nperceptions of their experiences, the interview process was\ndesigned to make participants feel comfortable talking\nopenly and honestly. Most of the interviews took place in\nparticipants' homes, and participants were further assured\nthat this was a confidential study and their identifiable infor-\nmation would not be shared. In addition, one African\nAmerican male research assistant interviewed all of the\nfathers who were mostly African American to encourage\ntheir full disclosure about sensitive issues concerning race\nand culture and fatherhood.\nWe used an etic approach (Strauss & Corbin, 1988) to con-\nceptualize the study categories. This approach coincided with\nour objective to ensure that important categories from previ-\nous literature about fathers (e.g., barriers to involvement) were\nincluded so that themes regarding fathers' viewpoint about\ntheir parenting experience could emerge. A content analysis\nwas conducted by counting all occurrences of each theme\nacross the resident and nonresident household statuses.\nAll audio-taped interviews were transcribed verbatim.\nThe transcriptions were reviewed a second time by the\nresearch assistant to ensure that there were no deviations\nfrom the script that would have biased the results. Variability\nof data was achieved, as all themes that emerged were\nincluded.\nThe data were analyzed using grounded theory (Strauss &\nCorbin, 1988). We used two levels of coding and categoriz-\ning the data, using a computer word processor (Marlow,\nfirst author identified \"meaning units,\" fitted them into cate-\ngories where the group had similar meaning, and assigned\nnames to those categories (Marlow, 2010). Codes were then\nassigned to the categories and refined and reorganized as\nneeded. The second level of coding that helped to interpret\nthe data also was done with a word processor. The second\nauthor retrieved meaning units from each of the interviews\ninto categories by copying and pasting the selected text from\nthe transcriptions. Next, the categories were compared and\ncontrasted to integrate them into themes. The themes were\nsaturated once the responses from latter interviews fit easily\ninto our existing categories. Information about the study data\ncan be obtained by contacting the second author.\nResults\nSociodemographic Characteristics\nThis was primarily a low income, young southern African\nAmerican sample, most of whom were nonresident fathers\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

Thirteen were married or partnered\nand 1 identified as \"other\" (3.3%). Sixty percent were\n30 years old and younger. The majority of fathers did not\nhave a college degree. Approximately a third of resident\nfathers and a third of nonresident fathers were employed full-\ntime, and more than half earned less than US$20,000 per\nyear. Many fathers (43.3%) identified having a specific reli-\ngion or belief; most fathers felt that they had a good relation-\nship with their children's mother. A description of resident\nand nonresident fathers' characteristics is in Table 1.\nInterview Findings\nImpact of fathers' presence in their children's lives. There were\nsix themes that emerged from fathers' descriptions of their\nimpact: (a) support children emotionally/convey that fathers\ncare, (b) provide for children financially, (c) help children\ndevelop into successful adults, (d) share parenting responsi-\nbilities with mother, (e) role models for their children, and\n(f) protect children (see Table 2).\nThe vast majority of fathers expressed a desire to be a part\nof their children's lives while describing the impact of their\npresence in their children's lives. These descriptions were\nnot limited to explaining traditional role activities. Instead,\nfathers' viewpoints help us understand the rationale behind\ntheir use or application of different roles in response to chil-\ndren's particular needs. For instance, fathers felt that both\nparents should be allowed to tap into their own nurturing and\ngender-neutral qualities when raising their children. One\nfather said,\nIf my children need to be kissed, I kiss them. If they need money,\nI will try to give them that. If they need to be held, I will hold\nthem. But, in my household the mother give the soft emotions\nand I give the hard emotions such as teaching how to defend or\ntake care of themselves.\nSimilarly, a second father stated, \"If a child needs loving,\nthen that's the responsibility of the father.\" Another father\nexplained how a father's presence helps his children's devel-\nopment and preparation as an adult:\nI mean, to me it means everything. Without my daughter having\na father or anybody not having a father they already are in lack.\nMeaning that whether a father has a daughter that's to show a\ndaughter how a real man is suppose to be and to make sure she\nknows what not to look for. And as a son, a father having a son,\npart of the job is to teach him how to be a man and how to carries\nhimself so I think fatherhood is very important um, and if a child\nstarts off without a father they're already in lack.\nIn addition, fathers noted the importance of modeling\nrespectful communication and behavior in front of the chil-\ndren so that they could grow up with a positive view about\nrelationships, as well as develop positive self-worth. One\nnonresident father described this:\nIt's important to keep that [mother\u00adfather] relationship intact as\nfar as, a reasonable relationship, not so much as, anything\nRoberts et al. 5\nemotional, but just reasonable. \"Hey, look I'm here to pick up\nmy child,\" or \"I'm here to pick up so and so I'll bring her back\nat a certain time.\" Vice versa and it's okay and you go about your\nway. And in a relationship, like I am, it's important just because\nI just want to make sure that my daughter is getting a positive\nscenery of what to do. With her growing up and with what she's\nsuppose to see and what she's supposed to see with a mother and\nfather that get along together and so that she can grow and have\na healthy relationship as she gets older.\nFactors that facilitate good fathering.Seven themes emerged\nfrom fathers' descriptions of factors that facilitated good\nfathering: (a) early and proper guidance about fatherhood,\n(b) emotional support, (c) good communication/good rela-\ntionship with the children's mother, (d) caretaking help,\n(e) coparenting/working together on behalf of child, (f) spiri-\ntual guidance, and (g) economic assistance (see Table 3).\nSeveral resident and nonresident fathers mentioned that a\nvariety of sources such as their family, others, church, and\neven television shows like the Cosby Show helped shape\ntheir role in fatherhood by providing them with these facili-\ntating factors. In regard to what has helped him become a\ngood father, one father stated, \"Well, first and foremost, my\nown father.\" Fathers also felt that family support was an\nimportant factor that facilitated fathering. In addition to\nreceiving help and encouragement from their parents, these\nfathers reported that their grandparents, aunts, uncles, broth-\ners, cousins, and their children's maternal family members\nwere supportive. Below are two fathers' views:\nYes, I have my family. My mom she's very supportive and my\ngrandparents . . . my grandmother. Now they're very supportive\nof me. So those are my two main supports. I don't really have\nmy child around a whole lot of people as far as different types of\npeople. My mom and my grandparents . . . grandma are the two\nmain supports that I have.\nFamily, her family is very supportive. My family is very\nsupportive. We actually have a great network of friends and\nthat's hard to, to have like, between her family, my family, and\nboth of our friends, we have a huge group of people that help\nraise our kids. So, it's a blessing.\nResident and nonresident fathers desired to have emo-\ntional support from their family and friends, and one father\nreported needing to receive compassion and understanding\nfrom the children's mothers:\nActually, I had recently been terminated from my previous job\n. . . She supported me through this little time, even though I was\nreceiving unemployment she was still there to tell me it was\nokay. Push me to go hard, push me to find something better for\nmyself and it's not just supporting me financially, but it's\nsupporting you emotionally and spiritually.\nWhile some fathers felt that support was there, others felt\nthey lacked support to become a good father. One said,\nKind of learned it on my own. Like, my dad he wasn't really\nthere when I was younger so it was just like I know the feelings\nthat I had coming up, so like, why would I want someone else to\nhave those same feelings coming up.\nWhen they did not have a father or father figure in their\nlife growing up, they sought other means for learning their\nfatherhood role. A second father noted,\nI pretty much learned from other people. Just interacting with\nother parents, you know. I come across people that may have\ntheir kids with them in public or you know, going to events that\ninvolve a lot of parents with their kids. Ask questions if I'm not\nsure of something or try to get an understanding on how to\nhandle being a parent in my position.\nAnd a third said,\nThe best example is probably my neighbor's father, 'cause I\ndidn't meet my pops until I turned 13. And I always like, me\nbeing a father, I always think back to what would he do in that\nsituation. 'Cause I feel like he was the best example that I've had\nas a father.\nThe quotes below illustrate fathers' religious or spiritual\nsupport toward good fathering, as well as support from spiri-\ntual leaders to shape their parenting. They expressed that the\nTable 2.

Some fathers who did\nnot have a father involved in their lives relied on church fig-\nures to teach them how to be a strong support for their chil-\ndren. One said,\nMainly my relationship with Christ. I learned a lot just from\nhim. Love and you know, from a son to father love through\nChrist. And my love to my daughter, you know that unlimited\nlove that he gives to me, that I feel for my daughter. You know,\nI understand true love when I have that relationship with Christ.\nThat answers that . . . and my pastor as well, he preaches heavy\non being a father being, a real man and a man of Christ.\nAnother father said,\nChurch, church, church, church. It's big in my household. Every\nSunday we are in church, rain, sleet, or snow. On Wednesdays,\nBible study. Kids are in the choir because you got to have that\nfoundation, you know what I'm saying . . . Social services, they\ndo Medicaid but other than that, the food stamps. I provide for\nthem, but, church is the physical and like a second father to\nthem, you know what I'm saying. I tell them all the time, if I'm\nnot here, go to church. If for some reason you don't have me in\nyour life, stay in church, you know what I'm saying. Because\nthat's going to steer you the right way.\nFactors that inhibit good fathering.Six themes described the\nbarriers to fathering: (a) economic challenges, (b) mothers\npreventing father-child contact/custody issues, (c) others'\nnegative talk and views about fathers'ability, (d) seeing poor\nexamples of what fatherhood entails, (e) fathers not prepared\nto care for child/receiving little information about parenting,\nand (f) mother-father poor relationship/inability to work\ntogether (see Table 4).\nFathers understood the importance of having a positive\nrelationship with the mother of their children. However,\nsome felt that if they could get along with the mother of their\nchildren, it should not affect their relationship with their\nchildren. One nonresident father talked about overcoming\nhis possible barrier:\nWe do not get along, if I don't do what she says or tells me or\nrequest for me to do, I don't have access to my children. I'm\nblessed because I'm starting to realize that my children know the\ntruth #1, and #2 it doesn't matter because they still love daddy\nbecause daddy tries. Even though me and mommy are separate,\ndaddy tells you to come over and spend the night, then he picks\nyou up--daddy, and is involved in your life. So the real difficulty\nis between a mom being angry or upset. Regardless if she still\nloves daddy or not or loves me or not, it's just about using her\nanger to stop me from seeing my children.\nSome nonresident fathers discussed being subjected to the\nmothers'gatekeeping to see their children. Often, fathers had\nto endure some kind of unwanted interaction with the mother.\nThey expressed the need to have a relationship with the child\neven if it did not include the mother. This did not necessarily\nimply that fathers disliked the children's mothers. Rather, the\nfathers yearned for a relationship with their children and pre-\nferred to deal with their children only. One said,\nWhen I call or if I do decide to go by the house. Being told you\ncan't see your kids or \"no, your kids can't visit you,\" by the\nmother. There is only but so much you can do, I mean, you can't\njust up and call the police and say, \"hey I'm not able to see my\nkids can you get my kids out the house for me?\" Especially, if\nyou don't have any type of custody arrangements, you know,\nthose type of things . . . You have to go to court for those matters.\nAlso, I can't physically just go in the house and take them even.\nYou know, there is consequences with that. That's what's been\nor who's been holding me back from my children.\nAnother nonresident father reported a similar challenge:\n. . . probably about the only obstacle I can think of--for any\nfather-- is not being allowed to see your children. When you're\nnot allowed to see your children that's a very big obstacle. I\nmean, you have to be able to speak to them. You have to be able\nto spend time with them. And I'm not talking about just around\nthe mother or anyone else but you need time with them alone.\nPersonally, that's my only obstacle is not being allowed to see\nmy kids.\nA third nonresident father noted, \". . . I decided to buy my\ndaughter a phone so we could talk to each other whenever\nbecause I did not like waiting for her mother to let me call\nher.\"\nSome fathers felt they had adequate contact or visitation\nwith their children with support from the children's moth-\ners--albeit conditional support in some instances for non-\nresident fathers. That is, they reported that their ability to\ninteract or have a relationship with their children was contin-\ngent on whether the children's mothers were pleased with the\nfathers' financial contributions or just happy in general with\nthe relationship between the parents. Fathers stressed that if\nRoberts et al. 7\nparents cannot get along with each other, that does not mean\nthey cannot have a relationship with their children.\nFurthermore, they thought that it was important for fathers to\nbe able to communicate with the mothers about their chil-\ndren, and set aside issues they had with each other. Some\nnonresident fathers also shared their frustration about unrea-\nsonable demands from the children's mothers regarding\nchild support. One said,\nI do take care of my child, you know. I do give her things other\nthan child support. But no, I think that having some conversations\nwith her she expects me to pay more. Even though I live so far\naway and only work part time and going to school. She expects\nme to pay more.\nAnother nonresident father reported a similar experience:\nInitially she didn't [support me] because I told her I couldn't pay\nchild support because didn't have a job. And once I got child\nsupport and was paying it she started being more receptive to\nme. And it wasn't like I didn't want to see my child because I\ncouldn't pay. And I don't feel like I should have to pay to see my\nchild. But, at the same time I know that there is a financial\nobligation to see my child and that's my responsibility and I\ndon't mind that. But, if it was not for me paying my child\nsupport, she wouldn't be so supportive.\nSummary of Comparisons Across Household\nStatus\nMore often, resident fathers reported having a positive view\nof the children's mothers in regard to what is needed to\nfacilitate good fathering (see Table 3). They stated that the\nmothers supported them, and in hypothetical terms,\nexplained how challenges could be worked out between\nthem in order to set a good example for the children.\nConversely, nonresident fathers usually referred to specific\nexperiences that had occurred or a current situation that\ncould be exacerbated. Their accounts regarding problematic\nrelationships with the children's mother about child support\nalso included statements about how it would affect the chil-\ndrenorjeopardizethefather-childrelationship.Furthermore,\nnonresident fathers reported more frequently than resident\nfathers that they had experienced financial problems and\nhad challenges with child support payments. Resident\nfathers, on the contrary, did not see the child support as a\nrelevant issue for them. Though, one resident father spoke\nabout having financial issues as it related to him needing to\nprioritize spending choices. But, he did not indicate that it\nhad the potential to negatively affect the mother-father or\nfather-child relationship.\nNonresident and resident fathers felt that it was very\nimportant to have a good relationship with the children's\nmother. However, unlike the nonresident fathers, resident\nfathers did not speculate about it adversely affecting their\nfather-child relationship or visitation. The tone of\nnonresident fathers' interviews was more negative in regard\nto the mother-father relationship and their financial chal-\nlenges that they felt ultimately could affect the father-child\nrelationship. Moreover, they felt that if they did not pay child\nsupport, then their children's mothers would talk poorly\nabout them and not allow them to visit their children. Only\none married father's responses reflected those of the nonresi-\ndent fathers. He reported that one of his babies' mother cre-\nated obstacles for him. Mothers preventing father-child\ncontact/custody issues, economic challenges, and others'\nnegative talk and views about fathers' ability were the barri-\ners most frequently reported by nonresident fathers com-\npared with resident fathers (see Table 4).\nWanting to spend time with their children to fulfill various\nfatherhood roles was common for resident and nonresident\nfathers. However, resident fathers spoke of this phenomenon\ncasually, without having to consider barriers to enjoy the\nsplendor of those roles. Nonresident fathers, however,\nreferred to spending time with their children as a phenome-\nnon that could only be enjoyed if they could overcome obsta-\ncles from their children's mothers.\nDiscussion and Implications\nNontraditional Father Roles\nOur findings indicated that most of the fathers in this study\nwere very engaged in their children's lives, which is similar\nResident and nonresident fathers further reported various\nbenefits to their being present in their children's lives. The\nfrequencies of their reports did not differ much across house-\nhold status. In addition to the widely accepted roles of pro-\nvider and protector, fathers also viewed themselves as having\nqualities of caregivers, role models, mentors, and nurturers.\nHowever, they had serious concerns about how their chil-\ndren's mothers and their family members perceived them as\nfathers when they did not live up to their role as provider.\nAccording to Lamb (2010), when parents assume less sex-\nstereotyped roles, it leads to children placing less importance\non sex-stereotyped roles and children having two involved\nparents rather than just one--and a high level of involvement\nfrom both parents. This creates opportunities for both parents\nto become fulfilled because they engage in activities that\npromote closeness with their children. Nevertheless, fathers\nin the present study acknowledged that their definition of\ninvolvement and types and level of support they provided\nmight not be considered sufficient by others' or society's\nstandards.\nThere is a clear need to educate the public, social service\nagencies, and fathers' families about the multifaceted father-\nhood role. This is particularly important because society has\nheld on to preconceived notions about fathers as primarily\nbreadwinner and protector, making it difficult to accept the\nidea that they deserve government assistance to raise their\n8 SAGE Open\nchildren and support their families. Educating the public can\nbring more realistic views of the fatherhood role and the\ntypes of services needed for fathers to support their children\nand families (Rosenberg & Wilcox, 2006).\nParent Socialization\nNonresident fathers, compared with resident fathers, stated\nmore frequently that early and proper guidance about father-\nhood and emotional support facilitated good fathering (see\nTable 3). Our findings indicated that fathers learned positive\nways to parent from a variety of sources and in a number of\nways. Some fathers reported learning from their own fathers,\nwho talked to them about becoming a man and the responsi-\nbilities of fatherhood. They expressed more often an appre-\nciation for receiving information about manhood or having\nman-to-man talks with positive male relatives and nonrela-\ntives (e.g., church mentors) than with various females.\nAlthough fathers reported that their mothers had been sup-\nportive, only two mentioned that they learned about father-\nhood from their mothers. This lends some credence to the\npopular notion that mothers can't teach a boy how to be a\nman. Furthermore, this finding is noteworthy as it is esti-\nUnited States headed by single-mothers (U.S. Census\nIn regard to other facilitators of good fathering, several\nfathers said that they were mentored by men in church about\nfatherhood responsibilities, and spoke extensively about\nchurch, God, Christ, the Bible, and spirituality. Given this\ndiscovery, faith-based services might thus be an alternative\nnatural resource to men who are leery about seeking outside\nassistance for their personal problems. Most church services\nare free or virtually free, which is a huge bonus for young\nfathers and fathers with low incomes. In addition, because\nplaces of worship are usually local and familiar, they can\nreach out to help fathers who have limited resources.\nThere was no mention from the fathers in this study about\nlearning about fatherhood from a formal class, books, DVDs,\nor the internet--methods that are more readily available\ntoday than ever. They may have failed to use these methods\nbecause they involve costs that many fathers might not be\nable to afford. Or they might have used these methods and\nneglected to say so during the interview. In addition, fathers\nrecruited from a father support/mentor group did not state in\ndefinitive terms that their present support/mentor group\nfacilitated good fathering. Although some reported that non-\nrelative males helped them, there is no way of knowing if\nthat included the facilitators or members in their group.\nIn the present study, only two fathers said that they had a\nneed for parent education or better parenting skills. However,\nbased on their overall disclosures about casually acquiring\nfragments of information about parenting and seeing poor\nexamples of what fatherhood entails, there may be a need for\nfathers to learn proper ways to parent their children to pro-\nmote their healthy development. This is an area for future\nexploration, as the present study did not solicit that informa-\ntion. Nevertheless, we speculate that parenting education for\nmales could provide them with a more accurate view of\nfatherhood responsibilities and roles and enhance parenting\nknowledge and skills (Hook & Chalasani, 2008).\nFinancial Programs\nOne of the most critical barriers that emerged from this study\ninvolves fathers' financial challenges. Nonresident fathers\nreported that when they did not have the finances to pay child\nsupport, their right to spend time with their children was\njeopardized. This finding is supported by previous research\nthat found that mothers were more likely to refuse visitation\nif they did not receive financial support from the fathers\n(Fagan & Barnett, 2003). Social workers should consider a\ncomprehensive socio-ecological approach to address barriers\nthat males face when parenting. For example, to address\nfathers' financial challenges, programs in a few states are\nevaluating the effects of modified child support payment\nrequirements on father involvement and children's outcomes.\nHowever, it is unlikely that this will be an option in the near\nfuture for the vast number of men in the United States.\nTherefore, linking fathers with financial assistance services\nis a realistic temporary solution, and linking them to employ-\nment services that lead to meaningful job placement would\nbe an effective long-term solution: 13.3% of the nonresident\nfathers in this study were unemployed, much higher than the\nnational unemployment rate for adult men (7.3%; U.S.\nCoparenting\nSimilar to previous studies on coparenting and the\nmother-father relationship, nonresident fathers in this study\nhave also noted the barriers mothers create around child vis-\nfathers expressed feelings of exasperation and little hope\nabout interacting with the children's mother to be a part of\ntheir children's lives. The majority of fathers wanted to have\na special time when they could bond with their children with-\nout the mother looking down on them or influencing the chil-\ndren to have negative opinions of them. Fathers said,\nhowever, that regardless of barriers created because they had\na negative relationship with their children's mother, they\nhad a desire and obligation to do whatever they could to visit\nand have a relationship with their children. Social workers\ncan play a role as family counselors by enabling fathers to\nwork with a mediator when things cannot be worked out\namicably between the mother and father.\nSeveral of the nonresident fathers in this study reported\nthat they preferred to have little or no dealings with their\nchildren's mothers when they visited their children or made\narrangements to pickup or interact with their children.\nStrained relationships were reported as a potential challenge\nto fathers'involvement with their children. Fathers may need\nRoberts et al. 9\nto learn how to coparent, an approach that places the mother\nand father in equal parenting positions, strengthens families,\nand helps minimize mother-father arguments (Allen &\n2011). Fathers can also overcome negative mother-father\nrelationships by gaining an understanding of the situation of\ntheir children's mother. In addition, nonresident fathers who\nare no longer in a romantic relationship with their children's\nmother could benefit from information about dealing with\nstressful situations that might lead to their walking away\nwhen they cannot handle a situation, or reacting inappropri-\nately, which might result in their being incarcerated.\nSheppard, Sims-Boykin, Zambrana, and Adams (2004)\nadvocate for interventions with fathers and mothers together,\nrather than addressing only fathers' issues, because both par-\nents are important for children's development.\nLimitations\nThese findings are limited by the use of a convenience sam-\nple. Furthermore, some fathers were participating in a\nfathers' support/mentoring group at the time of the study or\nthey were friends with someone who was participating in the\ngroup. Therefore, it is likely that they were more knowledge-\nable than many fathers about the supports available to them\nor parenting strategies. They might therefore be more asser-\ntive with advocating for helpful family or financial resources\nthat they feel they needed or minimizing challenges in the\nmother-father relationship compared with those who were\nnot associated with a fathers' support/mentoring group.\nAlso, this sample was comprised mainly of African\nAmerican fathers; thus, the role of culture likely influenced\nthe findings. As we stated earlier, minority men have been\ndisproportionately affected by unemployment and low\nincome compared with Caucasians (DeNavas-Walt et al.,\ninhibit their parenting.\nIn addition, understanding how the composition of the\nfathers' childhood household would have influenced their\nperspectives about their roles went beyond the scope of the\ndata. Future studies should include items about whether they\ngrew up in single-parent households and whether they were\nmale or female headed, as well as their current living and\nformal custodial arrangements.\nFinally, the sample size also adds some limitations.\nAlthough it is typical to have a small sample in qualitative\nstudies, it is important to note that all the characteristics of\nfathers, such as race/ethnicity or income level, were not rep-\nresented here. Therefore, we cannot state definitively that the\nfindings apply to those fathers whose characteristics were\nnot represented.\nConclusion\nDespite these limitations, the study provides useful insights\ninto fathers'views of their parenting. Resident and nonresident\nfathers in the study strongly desired to raise their children and\ncontribute positively to their development. However, barriers\nto fathering are much more complex for nonresident fathers.\nTherefore, in their efforts to keep fathers engaged in success-\nfully raising their children, social workers must understand the\ndifferential effects that household status, as well as other cul-\ntural factors, have on parenting supports and barriers.\n"
