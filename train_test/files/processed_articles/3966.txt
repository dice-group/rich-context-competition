    "abstract": "Abstract\nModern International Relations theory has consistently underestimated the depth of\nthe problem of anarchy in world politics. Contemporary theories of globalisation bring\nthis into bold relief. From this perspective, the complexity of transboundary networks\nand hierarchies, economic sectors, ethnic and religious ties, civil and cross-border\nwars, and internally disaggregated and transnationally connected state actors, leads to\na complex and multidimensional restructuring of the global, the local and the uneven\nconnections in between. We ought to abandon the idea of `high' and `low' politics,\n`inside' and `outside' once and for all. This does not remove the problem of anarchy\nbut rather deepens it, involving multidimensional tensions and contradictions variously\ndescribed as `functional differentiation', `multiscalarity', `fragmegration', disparate\n`landscapes', the `new security dilemma' and `neomedievalism'. Approaching anarchy\nfrom the perspective of plural competing claims to authority and power forces us to\nthink again about the nature of global order and the virtues of anarchy therein.

These combine in a single, ideal-type institutional\nstructure characterised as `sovereign' (Krasner, 1999). States, especially modern nation-\nstates, have been described as `arenas of collective action' domestically and effective\nunit actors able to make `credible commitments' internationally (Spruyt, 1994). This\nperception has led, in particular, to what has been called the `levels of analysis distinc-\ntion' (Hollis and Smith, 1990), with the state as the axis combining levels in a `two level\ngame' (Putnam, 1988), an image of world politics in which anarchy exists at the third,\nhighest level of politics, which lacks that which the state has: government.\nThis `interstate' system has been seen as fundamentally anarchic in the specific sense\nof lacking a coherent governmental structure above and beyond the states that compose\nit. As a result, international politics is torn between, on the one hand, disorder, stalemate,\nthe dominance or hegemony of particular states and their alliances, and on the other\nhand, various forms of fragile often transient cooperation. This conceptualisation leads\nto a fundamental `security dilemma' in which the attempt of particular nation-states to\nstrengthen their own security can lead to a vicious circle in which other states respond in\nkind, leading to the breakdown of cooperative arrangements and reducing security all\nround, leading to increasingly suboptimal outcomes, especially war and even the break-\nIn this article, we challenge this view of anarchy by drawing on a range of theories\nemanating from the study of globalisation that question the nature of the state, not in\norder to dismiss anarchy but rather to reframe its contours and to explore the implications\nof seeing anarchy as central to all social processes. Globalisation theories focus not\nmerely on non-state actors per se but rather on the restructuring of international relations\n\u00ad better identified as `world politics' \u00ad around more complex, multilayered and overlap-\nping structures; institutions and processes that challenge and increasingly undermine the\ncapacity of states and the interstate system to control, manage or shape what goes on in\nthe world. These processes often lead to the disaggregation of the state itself (Slaughter,\n2004), while not leading to effective forms of global government (Hameiri and Jones,\nWe develop an account of anarchy that links three important contributions to the anar-\nchy debate: the relativisation of order inAshley's (1988) deconstructive critique, the func-\naccount of the generative force of capital in the global process of uneven and combined\ndevelopment, and intersocietal multiplicity. We move towards a neopluralism of intersect-\ning and crosscutting forces (Cerny, 2010; cf. Prichard, 2013) that are functionally differ-\nentiated, but lacking in directionality, and existing in a fundamentally anarchic social\nstructure, one which has been ushered in by global capital and is rapidly undercutting the\nnation-state and increasing anomie and `derangement' of actors whose benchmarks are\nincreasingly undermined and confused (Durkheim, 2006 [1897]; see also Karatziogianni\nand Robinson, 2017). Where we go further is in arguing that processes of globalisation, in\nessence, represent the ongoing crystallisation and consolidation of a multilayered, multi-\nnodal anarchy, in which actors act to generate patterns of order not simply within the\ninstitutions of the state but more often outside those institutions on a number of diverse\nand variegated levels and networks both old and new, drawing states into wide ranging\nand shape-shifting processes of `complex interdependence' (Cerny, 2014b; Keohane and\nNye, 2000 [1977]). We argue that anarchy becomes the ontological condition for all poli-\nand criss-crossing of the state by complex, overlapping structures and processes, many of\nwhich are historically unprecedented, suggest we think again about the depth of this anar-\nchy and the conceptual, constitutional, political and social questions it implies.\nConceptualising diversity versus convergence in\nthe new anarchy\nGlobalisation is all too often perceived to be a structurally homogenising process, merely\nleading to `diversity within convergence' and requiring new forms of intergovernmental\ncooperation or `global governance'. Dimensions of homogenisation are said to include\neconomic globalisation, the ideological hegemony of neoliberalism, socio-cultural con-\nvergence, technological innovation and change, liberal internationalism and global gov-\nernance, and the emergence of a particular kind of so-called `flat world', as advanced by\nNew York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman (2005; for a trenchant critique, see\nAronica and Ramdoo, 2006). Normative calls for a world state follow this logic. A world\nstate is widely seen to be the only means by which order and justice can be maintained at\na global level (Albert et al., 2012). The political integration of large parts of the world\neconomy, the integration of distribution and logistics, a supposed convergence in identity\nand the externalising of social and environmental costs by multinational corporations, all\ndemand some sort of central or at least ideologically coordinated response mechanism,\nas argued in the extensive literature on `global governance' (cf. Joseph, 2012).\nHowever, supposed global-level developments are challenged by tensions and contra-\ndictions across multiple dimensions in the global political economy. Theorists have\nidentified these processes using the evocative concepts of `functional differentiation',\n`multiscalarity', `deterritorialisation', disparate `landscapes', `neomedievalism' and `frag-\nmegration', increasing uncertainty in the international system and the likelihood of multi-\nple equilibria or alternative possible outcomes. Each questions the plausibility of a single\ncentre of power feasibly coordinating all others. The result is an undermining of the land-\nmarks of modernisation without a clear direction forward.\nThe concept of functional differentiation, taken from sociological theory, posits that\nthe differentiation of social structures, previously a cause of embedded conflict and\ninstability, becoming increasingly interdependent as they merge into an overarching ver-\ntical structure. These differentiated structures become more co-dependent and comple-\nmentary\u00admore`functional'\u00adinamodernisingworld(Durkheim,1984).Asmodernisation\nand other forms of development take place, the more integrated they become and the\nmore likely social orders are to combine complex social bonds, political institutions and\nprocesses, and economic structures like markets and firms, in single-overarching units.\nIn this context, political units are characterised more and more by differentiation accord-\ning to the `functions' that particular substructures and crosscutting infrastructures and\nprocesses play in society, the economy and, indeed, political life (Albert et al., 2013).\nBut at the same time, pulling against these trends, social bonds are increasingly frac-\ntionated and multicultural, often localised, regionalised and, indeed, dispersed through\nmaterial and immaterial transborder linkages, such as information and communications\ntechnology, social media, migration and diasporas, and religious and ethnic, rather than\n`national', identities. Awareness of what is happening across the world is, thus, leading\nto an uneven mixture of convergence and diversity, the breakdown (and reinvention) of\nold and the formation of new bonds and identities.\nPerhaps, the best known form of functional differentiation is economic, including mul-\ntinational firms, financial markets and institutions, as well as an increasing transnational\ndivision of labour among linked production processes or `supply chains'. The integration\nand differentiation of these structures make them prone to systemic, rather than localised\nshocks, as witnessed in the recent financial crisis. Nevertheless, in the context of a world\nthat is increasingly characterised by complex interdependence, states, domestic political\nsystems and public policymaking are vulnerable to crosscutting and intersecting independ-\nent variables they cannot control, ranging from terrorism to financial crises to the rapid\ngrowth of economic and social inequality. A recent cartoon in the New Yorker magazine\ndepicts a lone protester holding up a sign saying, `We are being controlled by the random\noutcomes of a complex system' (30 March 2015). In the structural environment of a Third\nIndustrial Revolution, and the complex forces undermining neoliberal globalisation and\nthe state, whether ideological, social or material, the tendency is towards asserting an\nauthoritarian form of neoliberalism (Bruff, 2014), echoing processes afoot in the 1930s.\n`Multiscalarity' focuses on the scale of social, political and economic structures and\nprocesses, and posits that in a globalising world, an uneven variety of both old and new\nscales of interaction are crystallising and consolidating (see the debates on this issue in\nBrenner et al., 2003). Different publics experience the scale of politics in different ways,\noften transnationally, or translocally, sometimes both, as in the case of the Occupy\nMovement, footloose high finance and `high politics'. Political agency is no longer\ndefined by interest groups seeking out the levers of state power, because these levers are\nseen to be largely impotent or politically suspect (Holloway, 2002).\nRelated to this turn from the state is `deterritorialisation'. From this perspective, struc-\ntural homogeneity between state and society in specific geographical/territorial locations,\ncrucial to the unitary coherence of the nation-state, is being undermined by cross-border\nlinkages (Scholte, 2000). In particular, the kind of strong, secure borders that are supposed\nto characterise the sovereign nation-state is increasingly recognised as being impossibly\nporous, challenged around the world, and in many cases becoming, or have always been,\nmore analogous to fluid, pre-modern `frontiers' (see also Hald\u00e9n, 2017). This recognition\nhas shaped the battleground of the campaign for British `exit' from the European Union\n(EU), the proliferation and threat of further border walls, all offering a utopian conception\nof the state as a hermetically sealed container of unified community, often harked back to\nin debates about the state's `hollowing out' (see Jessop, 2013 for a critical discussion).\nShoring up the state, in this context, is inevitably received as illiberal.\nThe concept of disparate `landscapes' also captures the fundamental paradox in glo-\nbalisation theory. On one hand, we have Friedman's idea that the world is increasingly\n`flat' and that globalisation is a homogenising force across borders. This is, of course,\npartly true at particular levels and with regard to particular functional categories such as\nfinancial markets and institutions. On the other hand, it is increasingly argued that glo-\nbalisation is characterised by a growing divergence and uneven interaction between `flat'\nand `rugged' landscapes, where politics and society are increasingly dissolved and scat-\ntered, more and more difficult to control and manage, with developmental processes in\none area having unintended consequences in others (Root, 2013). There is also a spec-\ntrum of mixed landscapes between the two. General Colin Powell said ofAmerican inter-\nventionism in the 1990s `We do deserts. We don't do mountains', while missing out the\nintervening complexities. Indeed, it has become increasingly clear to military strategists\nthat the old models of engagement have ceased to be of relevance, with urban and guer-\nrilla warfare leading to a reinvention of the use of force. The socio-economic roots of\nsocial conflict notwithstanding, religious and ethnic fractionalisation, terrorism and the\nlike, exacerbate conflicts between `centralising elites' and reinvented `tribes' (Ahmed,\nThe concept of `neomedievalism' has been employed in International Relations theory\nsince the 1970s at least but has remained in the background, even at the highpoint of the\nseems more and more apposite to talk of the complex interaction not only of `competing\ninstitutions with overlapping jurisdictions' (Cerny, 1998; Minc, 1993) but also of localities,\nregions and different social and economic groups, transnational authority and loyalty struc-\ntures too. The increasing privatisation of the use of force (Abrahamsen and Williams, 2010),\nthe localisation and globalisation of rule and the reach of the use of force, raises questions\nabout whether this complexity will lead to endemic conflict, on one hand, or a `durable\ndisorder' in which key actors are increasingly engaged in various forms of `brokerage' in\norder to smooth over the underlying dysfunctionality of the system, on the other. Peter H.\nWilson (2016), in his pioneering study of the Holy Roman Empire, concludes by comparing\nthe Empire with its multiple levels of authority and conflict with today's EU. But what is\ntrue of the EU is even truer of the world political `system' as a whole. The globalisation of\nthe neoliberal world order has fundamentally transformed the structures of sovereignty,\nwhere the monopoly of force and the claims of legitimate sovereign authority are increas-\nor subterranean interlinkages of informal, non-governmental social agents, structures and\nprocesses, including the pluralisation of social movement activism, push the generative pro-\ncesses of global order, processes that are radically distinct from forms of industrial revolu-\ntionary political subjectivity current only 50 years ago (Chesters and Welsh, 2005;\nKaratziogianni and Robinson, 2017). If a mass class consciousness is to arise, it is unlikely\nto be in the areas of de-industrialisation and service sector economies (Ness, 2015).\nQuestions of the virtues of statehood are especially pronounced in areas where no\nsuch thing exists. Recent scholarship has suggested that up to 80% of the world's popula-\ntion lives in areas of limited or failed statehood. Thomas Risse (2011) and colleagues\nthese areas, the state's monopoly of force simply does not reach, either because sub- or\nnon-state actors undermine any state monopoly on violence or because no such monop-\noly of force existed to begin with. For Risse (2011), `areas of limited statehood are an\nalmost ubiquitous phenomenon in the contemporary international system and also in\nhistorical comparison' (2011: 6), forcing non-state actors to provide public goods, secu-\nrity and welfare. Whether in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, in\nSomalia, the mega cities that shape the planet, or its rural hinterlands, the absence of a\nWeberian state is a perennial feature of life at the margins. This fact of modern life for\nmost of the world's population characterises what Colin Ward once labelled `anarchy in\naction' (Scott, 2009; Ward, 1973), that is, the pursuance of the good without a state.\nAttempts to universalise the liberal western model of the good through extractive neo-\ncolonial processes, on one hand, and the extension of liberal imperium on the other, in a\nword, globalisation, is precisely the problem.\nOne way to conceptualise these processes is to think of them in terms of what James N.\nRosenau (1990) called `fragmegration', what we call `the dialectic of globalisation and\nfragmentation'. This is not merely a state of affairs. It is an ongoing process. States are no\nlonger (if they ever were) at the wheel of control. They are whipsawed between quasi-\nglobalised financial elites at one end of the spectrum and reinvented tribal groups like\nIslamic State at the other. The EU, for example, is in continual structural quasi-crisis, try-\ning to deal centrally with plural tensions between the local and the transnational. In the\nUnited States and in the rest of the developed and developing worlds, economic growth\nmay well be slowing down as the Third Industrial Revolution runs out of steam (Gordon,\nstark structural contradiction that states have facilitated. Most worrying is the evidence\nthat this is a global phenomenon, with Chinese growth slowing too, while `developing'\nregions are no longer catching up and indeed are in growing crisis (Taylor, 2016).\nFinally, austerity and the erosion of the rights of labour are undermining the mid-\ntwentieth century social contract on which the welfare state and liberal democracy have\nbeen based. Political leaders in unstable states are either engaged in attempting to restore\nauthoritarian repression, as in Russia, China, Egypt, Turkey, even in the United States, or\nare ensnared in the breakdown of the political system, as in Brazil, Venezuela and a range\nof African countries. The number of what are called `failed states' is increasing but the\nplurality of ways in which they are doing so is cause for alarm. The `fragmentation of\nglobal governance architectures' is not leading to coherent structuration at an `interna-\nIn sum, the role of the state in the west has changed fundamentally in recent years.\nPolitical actors have pluralised and no longer see the state as the main vehicle through which\nto realise their interests. The state has also divested or outsourced its social, economic and\npolitical responsibilities, while `concealing'(Lindsey, 2014) the deep state and its core func-\ntions. Military and security expenditures rise, even when their use is outsourced.\nWhither the state?\nAccording to the standard modernisation thesis of state and global order, authoritative\ninstitutions bring together the diverse scales of political, social and, to a large extent,\neconomic life into a single structural complex for organisational management and\ncontrol. These are also central to the development of core social bonds and identities, and\neconomic development, especially in the context of the Second Industrial Revolution.\nThe state, whether or not it was effectively centralising in command terms, has neverthe-\nless been seen as centripetal in the evolution of sociopolitical life, especially in the ideas\nand perceptions that shape that life (see also Badie and Birnbaum, 1983).\nThis conceptualisation of the state has, of course, dominated not only state-building\nprocesses themselves but also the perception among mass publics that states, despite\ntheir disadvantages, are normatively the best way to organise political life, especially in\nthe context of the historical longevity of national identities and the development of\nnational pride (Anderson, 1991). Furthermore, state-building has long been associated at\nleast since the Enlightenment with notions of progress and the evolution of modern\nhuman society, both natural and conventional, whether liberal, capitalist or socialist.\nToday, the state has not, of course, become irrelevant or insignificant, but disenchantment\nwith the providential rhetoric of the enlightenment is the norm. Rationalities of marginal\nutility have transformed statehood into a marketising, commodifying process, not simply a\nregulatory state but an ordoliberal/neoliberal state promoting a new model of `entrepre-\nneurial man'. The neoliberal state in particular, dominant in political culture in leading capi-\ntalist states since the 1970s, sees people themselves as in essence quasi-Hayekian,\npersonalised enterprises in permanent competition with each other (Cerny, 2016b; Dardot\nand Laval, 2013 [2009]), rather than the social animals of most other versions of political\nthought. Second, the state has become a promoter of financialisation rather than welfare or\nsocial democracy, prompting the financialisation of society itself, replacing decommodify-\ning welfare and public services and undermining the potential for what has been called the\n`entrepreneurial state' concerned with providing public goods (Block and Keller, 2011;\ndemocracy has been replaced by the supposed `democratisation of finance' and `financial\ninclusion' (see Litan and Rauch, 1998; Shiller, 2003), supporting (while re-regulating) the\nfinancial system through ostensible deregulation and crisis, indebting the poorer classes\nrather than redistributing (Cerny, 2014a). Third, the state, by shifting economic policymak-\ning to `independent'central banks, has become, through such policies as quantitative easing,\na `monetary Keynesian'rather than a `fiscal Keynesian'institution.\nFourth, the state itself in its traditional international `realist' guise, that is shaping and\nmanaging the overall system through diplomacy and, crucially, war \u00ad for example,\nthrough balances and imbalances of power \u00ad has become increasingly vulnerable and\nimpotent in the face of both local and transnational forces and movements. Intervention\nhas become ineffective and counterproductive in the face of what has been called a grow-\ning but diverse set of conflicts between reinvented tribes and centralising elites (Ahmed,\n2013). Fifth, and finally, the state itself has become a globalising agent \u00ad a `competition\nstate', promoting its own disaggregation (Genschel and Seelkopf, 2015; Cerny, 1997). In\nsum, one of the ironies of the development of liberal internationalist world order is that\nthe processes of `global governance' are increasingly fragmented and beyond the con-\nscious direction of any one political power (Cerny, 2016a; McKeon, 2017a). While their\nform is predominantly liberal, the longevity of this liberalism is not guaranteed.\nTo conclude, the state has become a key abettor of its own involvement in and subor-\ndination to the new anarchy, caught up in transnational, crosscutting webs of power and\nstructural change that it can neither manage nor control (Cerny, 1990). The very over-\narching structural anarchy that once seemed to make states into Waltz's (1979) `unit\nactors' has ironically served to undermine that status in complex and diverse ways. How\nwe respond to this new anarchy is the key challenge of our time.\nDimensions of the new anarchy: From levels to networks\nIn the absence of the Weberian, let alone the Hobbesian state, we are compelled to rethink the\nstructural form of the global. This is not well-charted territory. How then should we concep-\ntualise `international relations' in the absence of a formal analytical hierarchy of state and\nnon-state and with the complex plurality of non-state actors at the centre of our analysis?\nWe are typically compelled to see world politics in terms of levels or `images', moving\nupwards from individual motivations as a cause of social order, to the internal affairs of a\nstate or the structures of politics, to the relatively autonomous and emergent structures of\n`the international'seen as an interstate system \u00ad Waltz's `third image'(Waltz, 1959). Waltz's\nimages of world politics, and the generation of an autonomous international domain, were a\nreflection of the post-imperial state system that came about between 1945 and the early\n1970s. Bipolarity, great power politics and the proliferation of post-colonial states made the\n`third image'realistic in a way that it would not have been but 30 years earlier.\nThis account of levels remains ingrained in our conceptual framing of world politics\nbut is increasingly outdated. It is a radical and misleading oversimplification. World poli-\ntics is now more adequately understood as a complex set of relations between individuals\nand social groups, from classes to vested interests, tribes to religions that relate across\nstate and regional boundaries, mediated at different speeds by different technologies,\nsocial bonds and identities (see also Prichard 2017, this issue). These forces pull against\none another and reconstitute politics in unforeseen ways. These relations can be vertical,\nbetween constitutionally ordered superiors and inferiors; horizontal, across civil society;\nor diagonal, that is relations of power constituted between social groups and host or for-\neign states, or multinational corporations and publics in foreign countries.\nOne way to think about the new architecture of world politics, then, is through mate-\nrialising networks of agency that crystallise as functional material or ideological nodes\nthat are relatively enduring and emergent properties (Lawson, 2012; see also Ashworth,\nconstituted by the material relations within which they are situated and shaped by the\nideological forces which give these processes meaning. The situated activities of people\nand `things' constitute the global through their purposeful interactions, interactions\nwhich take place in very distinct rooms, places and times, and sometimes with very dis-\ntant co-actors, and mediated by specific material technologies, processes and capital,\nimpinging causal `objects' in their own right. In this respect, the global is made through\nthe everyday behaviours of people but people that are differentially capacitated. Material\nand ideological structures precede these interactions, shaping and changing them imper-\nceptibly, but they are themselves changed, in turn, by the ways in which concrete actors\nact, a process called `structuration'. The morphological character of these emergent\nsocial structures (Archer, 1995), relatively ossified technologies and practices that\nemerge from the stabilised interactions of peoples, against which others must push, is\nalways instantiated in the activities of individuals in their social groups, even if the\ncausal forces most salient to those practices were first established thousands of miles\naway and by groups and networks sustained by people they may never meet. For exam-\nple, franchising, social movement mimicry, combating climate change or earning a liv-\ning are all social practices through which the global is recreated and also challenged.\nFrom this perspective, levels are an oversimplification. It is sociologically and methodo-\nlogically more productive to consider all social relationships as constituted horizontally,\nalways through concrete traceable causation, whether material or ideological, through actors\nthat interact in developing and maintaining particular institutions and structures over time.\nSo, for example, while semi-dematerialised price mechanisms by which markets and institu-\ntions relate to each other and to the wider economy, society and polity, shape our interac-\ntions, they do so through people and material processes that connect them (Coole and Frost,\n2010; Srnicek, 2013). They do not take place `above'or `below'us, as the three-level image\nof world politics suggests (Waltz, 1959) but through our interactions with the computers,\nlogistics and groups of people next to us (Latour, 2005: 178). The process is itself non-linear\nand causally complex, and for methodological and analytical reasons we should conceptu-\nalise these relations as a dialectical spectrum of the `flat'and the `rugged'\u00ad horizontal, medi-\nBy way of illustration, the development of what has been called a `bailout state'(Taibbi,\n2013) underlines the way actors and political processes can only increasingly react to\nprice changes that are independently produced by market and institutional transactions,\nmany of which are automated. Actors' social positioning shapes their range of possible\nresponses to material processes. A key contemporary change is that the state is no longer\nthe key determinant of that positioning. Other globalising trends include the development\nof information and communications technologies that circle the globe, while also creating\nthe potential for backlashes of diverse kinds as awareness of global-level problems, ine-\nqualities and instabilities spreads. Notions of `above'and `below'might lead us to believe\nthat there are domains that exist according to distinct logics, beyond the reach of everyday\nactors, but our approach suggests that this way of seeing things is flawed, analytically and\ndescriptively. It is through our everyday practices that the global is instantiated. None of\nthis is to deny the very real social and material hierarchies that structure social life, nor\nthat social life is a universal domain directly accessible to all people. It is through co-\naction that we are able to `reach'these otherwise inaccessible planes, with emergent struc-\ntures prohibiting our access differentially and in intersecting ways. Our framework for\nanalysis simply suggests that `flattening the social', as Latour (2005) puts it, and then\ntracing how new forms of uneven fragmentation emerge, opens up new ways of identify-\ning agency in the structures of its own reproduction.\nThis approach also decentres the state by placing it alongside other social groups \u00ad\nrather than above the social and below the international (for more, see Prichard 2017, this\nissue). This anarchises our social ontology, and also makes the social more anarchic,\nopening up the possibility of radical agency, by bringing more realism into the theory of\nstate agency. Attempts to consolidate and centralise power and authority, to develop\nnotions of levels and social hierarchy, to extend the reach of the state, have all been the\nmission of modernity (Scott, 1998). And yet the entropic characteristics of social life\ncontinually militate against this.\nThe key to understanding processes of organisation, manipulation and problem solv-\ning in any sociopolitical structural context is the way strategically situated actors are able\nto mobilise and manage material resources, influential contacts, ideologies and mind\nsets, and knowledge in order to take advantage of and exploit the constraints and oppor-\ntunities, especially points of access, embedded in those structures in the pursuit of their\npreferred outcomes, whether monetary, status-oriented or power-wielding. Thinking\nabout social interaction as strategic positioning in webs of complex social interdepend-\nence demands we think about order itself in plural ways as the emergent product of\ncomplex, mutually constituting processes.\nThe new anarchy and some perennial problems:\nAn agenda for debate\nTransformations in the power of state and capital are reconstituting world politics. This\nprocess of reconstituting needs a normative corollary, a new constitutional moment. The\nnew republicanism points the way here (see, for example, Pettit, 1997). The new repub-\nlicanism contrasts with the liberal constitutional moment in three important ways. First,\nliberal constitutionalism develops legal institutions to prevent arbitrary interference in\nthe private pursuits and property of individuals and nations. Non-interference leaves\nexisting distributions of property and power intact since it prohibits interference in his-\ntoric distributions of both (Nozick, 1974). The new republicanism, by contrasts, rests on\nthe principle of non-domination. Where existing distributions of power and privilege are\nrecognised to precipitate arbitrary domination of one individual or group by another,\nthen a `constitutional provision', an institutionalised third party, is introduced to regulate\nand counter that dominating relationship (Pettit, 1997: 68). The radical wing of this new\nconstitutionalism draws on an abolitionist heritage, proclaiming the institution of private\nproperty to precipitate such an arbitrary but constitutionally defended mode of structural\ndomination (Gourevitch, 2015), and that constitutional provisions must include things\nlike people's tribunes and radical modes of participatory democracy (McCormick, 2011).\nThese new Marxist accounts are becoming increasingly otherworldly. The radical plu-\nralisation of politics and power pulls against the re-composition of the nation-state, seen as\na central bulwark against entrenched economic power. But this republican moment can be\npushed further. The radical pluralisation of global power, and the constituencies of global\norder, suggests the need for a form of political and economic order that is equally decentred\nbut capable of constraining power. Daniel Deudney's model of republican federalism points\nthe way here. For Deudney, constellations of power can be mutually constrained both\nupwards and downwards by the pluralisation and federalisation of political control, or what\nhe calls the implementation of negatives on power, or `negarchy'(Deudney, 2007). Pushing\nthis further, anarchists of all hues have pushed the federal moment into the political eco-\nnomic domain, arguing for the consolidation of workplace democracy and the re-territorial-\nisation of political control to account for the plural social groups through which we realise\nour political agency, whether towns, regions or clubs (Prichard, 2013; Proudhon, 1979).\nRather than a remedy for a bygone era, the radical pluralisation of political order sug-\ngests precisely the opposite. Whether Proudhon in the 1870s, Mitrany in the interwar\nyears (Ashworth, 2017), or Murray Bookchin half a century later, the antidote to the\nconsolidation of state and economic power, was a form of radical political and economic\ndisaggregation and re-federalisation that could re-harness complexity in the interests of\nall (Bookchin, 1974). The object is to pluralise `constitutional provisions' ad infinitum.\nLet us consider the merits of this proposition in three areas, inequality, insecurity and\nglobal economic power.\nFirst: inequality. In today's world, the extensive scale of financial globalisation has\ndramatically increased the inequalities between the rich and poor. This is at the heart of\ncurrent debates about the `99%' and the `1%'. In this multinodal world, the extensive\nnetworks of finance enable these actors to control outcomes in ways that states can either\npromote \u00ad as in support for particular institutions or financial centres such as London or\nNew York \u00ad or attempt, generally ineffectually, to regulate. A lack of centralisation makes\ncontrol less effective, so the argument goes, while a hollowing out of political and legal\ninstitutions has led to many a pundit to draw parallels with late 1930s European politics.\nPolitical and legitimacy crises are being met with Rousseauean responses (e.g. Bickerton\net al., 2006), calling for the reaffirmation of popular sovereignty at precisely the time at\nwhich these unified publics are least visible, and their creation leads to a crass populism.\nIf we conceptualise economic and political power as disaggregated and decentralised,\nnetworked and plural (or neoplural), rather than centralise political power in response, we\nmight then decentralise, disaggregate and federate it (Prichard 2007, 2013). Relinking the\neconomy with public power might be better facilitated through a cooperative economic\nmodel, reintroducing democratic control over workplaces and neighbourhoods, towns and\nregions, negotiating title as well as the terms of political participation (Prichard 2010).\nThis would need to run in tandem with the strengthening of labour laws and unions, diver-\nsifying power and constraining it where it is actualised: in the workplace and through\nFor example, across Northern Europe, but particularly in Iceland, Pirate Party activ-\nists have campaigned on platforms of radical `liquid'democracy (Blum and Zuber, 2016;\nCammaerts, 2015). Here, policies are `crowd sourced' and developed through active\ndiscussion between politicians and publics, incorporating real-time online evaluation of\nproposals and policy, and mimicing and drawing on elements of the radical activism of\nthe general assemblies and spokes councils of the Occupy camps. The successful attempt\nto crowd source a new Icelandic constitution between 2011 and 2012 is one example of\nthis (Landemore, 2015, 2016) but this process could be extended to constitutionalise\nevery emergent political organisation, from cities to regions, to industrial unions, all\ngenerated through this neoplural world order, and then aggregated through further con-\nstitutional means. Alongside the democratic control of the workplace, this reconstituti-\nnalisation might meet problems of control and legitimacy, while giving the people the\nmeans to redress questions of economic inequality by taking control of their labour and\npolitical power. Taking control of the new `silk roads' (Frankopan, 2015) of economic\ninteractions \u00ad the logistical supply chains of world economic order \u00ad by the workers\nwould link (or disrupt) localities across vast spaces.\nSecond: security. This pluralisation of political constituencies could alternatively be read\nas exacerbating the conceptualisation of politics as between `tribes' and `centralising elites'\nor the `reinvention of tradition'\u00ad the restructuring and even direct manipulation of histories,\nidentities and narratives (Hobsbawm and Ranger, 1983) \u00ad in reaction to globalising trends,\nincluding the distortion of religion and the rebirth of populist nationalism. These tendencies\nclash with centralising and modernising logics of development, exacerbating tensions\nbetween great powers and recipient states, producing new imperial logics, new client and\npuppet states and economic-industrial command structures. We see this in the Ukraine, the\nSouth China Sea, Bolivia/Chile, in Africa and particularly in Afghanistan, where national\nboundaries merely exacerbate what are fundamentally local, tribal and regional disparities\nand antagonisms, often not merely the revival of precolonial distinctions but manipulated\npseudo-traditions such as `making American great again'.\nIn the absence of meaningful public power, and the absence of constraints on the power-\nful, whether media barons, industrialists, politicians or religious leaders, the manipulation\nof publics is inevitable. The disaggregation of publics suggests new counterpowers that\nmight be reconstitutionalised through decentralising constitutional provisions. This is the\nquintessence of Deudney's concept of negarchy, where powers (conceptualised in material\nand ideological terms) are constrained by countervailing powers, and then federated.\nThird: global capital. In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, there is growing personal,\npublic and corporate indebtedness rather than deleveraging (Farrell et al., 2008; Fuller,\n2016). Derivatives and securitisation still drive the debt economy which dwarfs the\nequity market. Market `flexibility'outruns regulators and policymakers, while in the real\neconomy foreclosures, debt defaulting, debt strikes and simple miscalculations mean\nanother major crisis is only one systemic shock away. In the context of increasing ine-\nquality and continued and unnecessary austerity policies, finance for the sake of capital\nis probably unfit for purpose. In 2008, the state was arguably an effective firebreak, but\nonly at the expense of the public, who had to carry the burden of multi-trillion bailouts\nof the financial sector.\nOn one hand, diversifying risk in this context might be better achieved by socialising\nproperty through the cooperative control of the economy, bringing local power and transna-\ntional linkages to bear on the governance of the market, rather than through centralisation.\nThe answer to bad regulation might therefore be not more or less regulation, but diversified\nand locally controlled regulation, in a framework that puts decision-making in the hands of\nthose most likely to be affected by crashes \u00ad an economic subsidiarity to match the political\nprinciple so common in debates in the EU (F\u00f6llesdal, 1998). This would be to develop a set\nof economic counterpowers developed from the ground up. This might involve a plethora of\ndecision-making bodies in the short term, but in the medium term this demands a participa-\ntory process of economic decision-making (e.g. Albert, 2003). Here, people can reclaim\ncontrol of the economy through cooperatives, transnational labour unions, peasant solidarity\nstruggles like La Via Campesina and innumerable others. On the other hand, such develop-\nments may prove overly idealistic in the face of the new structural complexities and uneven\ndynamics of twenty-first-century world politics. Only time will tell.\nConclusion\nThe new anarchy is populated by uneven, unequal and only dimly perceived social, eco-\nnomic and political forces and processes. Will the emerging structuration process lead to\na new, less pluralistic balance of forces, a `transnational neopluralism' (Cerny, 2010)?\nCan this new constellation be constitutionalised in all its plural complexity?\nFrom the perspective sketched here, transnational neopluralism consists in uneven\ncrosscutting and interlinked horizontal networked relationships, between individuals and\ngroups, across multiple sites of power. It currently revolves around what Lindblom (1977)\ncalled the `privileged position of business', further entrenched in an interdependent, glo-\nbalising world. This is an anarchy ushered in, ironically, by neoliberal globalisation, a\ncomplex, internally paradoxical political process, neither an inevitable progression to a\nworld polity nor a subordinate dimension of the interstate system. The state's role in this\nprocess has been one of both facilitator and unwitting casualty, leaving the way open to\ncolossal financial interests and the reactive challenge of civil society, which has to bear the\nburdens of this seismic post-Cold War change. In this context, a return to the institutions of\nstate sovereignty is a Quixotic even reactionary enterprise. The `sovereignty' Krasner\ncalled `organised hypocrisy'is turning into a different kind of hypocrisy through the dialec-\ntic of globalisation and fragmentation, with new forms of fascism more likely to predomi-\nnate if the state and capital combine against the majority, scapegoating the foreign and\ndeploying the military industrial complex to sustain historic privileges of race and class.\nAlternatives to the nation-state are sorely needed, and conceptualising an alternative\nglobal constitutionalism, that is a non-dominating and universal, is an historic challenge.\nMuch of modern political thought and international political theory is premised on a\nmove from anarchy to order, where the latter is understood in terms of statism. We need\nto rethink this move, foregrounding the new pluralism of the global order and consider\nconstitutionalising order in anarchy. If we do not, then the dialectic of globalisation and\nfragmentation will lead at worst to increasing conflict and anomie, at best to muddling\nthrough a `durable disorder' (Minc, 1993).\nReferences\nAbrahamsen R and Williams MC (2010) Security beyond the State: Private Security in International\nPolitics.
