The data reveal that\nthis lack of insurance is associated with lower rates of employer-based and privately\npurchased coverage. Even after controlling for a large number of insurance-related factors,\nHispanics have rates of health insurance coverage that are lower than those of either\nnon-Hispanic blacks or whites. This serious lack of health insurance coverage among\npreretirement-age Hispanics has serious implications both for health, because the lack of\ninsurance represents a major barrier to health care, and for the adequacy of retirement\ncoverage, because private insurance represents an important supplement to Medicare.\nKey Words: Health and retirement survey, Hispanic health insurance coverage,\nBarriers to health care, Medicare, Medicaid, Older Latinos\nThe Extent of Private and Public Health\nInsurance Coverage Among Adult Hispanics1\nRonald J. Angel, PhD,2 and Jacqueline L. Angel, PhD2\nThe United States, unlike most other developed\nnations of the world, does not provide comprehen-\nsive and universal health care for its citizens as a\ncitizenship right. Rather, in this country, for those\nunder 65, the state plays only the role of provider of\nlast resort, and for the majority of individuals health\ncare must be purchased on the open market. As a\nconsequence, the quantity and quality of medical\ncare that one receives is determined by one's ability\nto pay, and because medical care for anything but the\nsimplest problems is prohibitively expensive, access\nto health insurance is crucial to ensuring adequate\nhealth care to individuals and their families (U.S.\nGeneral Accounting Office, 1992). In the U.S., there-\nfore, understanding differences in access to health\ninsurance is crucial to understanding differences in\naccess to health care. Health insurance represents a\nreal form of wealth because, like money, it allows\none to acquire the goods and services necessary for a\nhealthy and productive life.\nHistorically, Hispanics have had the lowest rates of\neither public or private health insurance coverage of\nany racial or ethnic group in the United States (U.S.\nno health insurance of any sort, compared to approx-\nimately 13% of non-Hispanic whites and 20% of\nblacks (National Council of la Raza, 1992). The core of\nthe problem consists of very low rates of private or\nemployer-based health insurance among Hispanics.\nwhites reported owning private health insurance,\n1This research was supported in part by the National Institute on Aging,\n2University of Texas at Austin. Address correspondence to Ronald Angel,\nPhD, Population Research Center, The University of Texas-Austin, 1800\nwhereas less than half of Hispanics (48%) reported\nany private insurance of any sort (National Council of\nWhat is most surprising is that this lack of private\ninsurance among Hispanics is not compensated for\nby public insurance (U.S. General Accounting\nOffice, 1992). Even though they are a relatively young\npopulation with high fertility rates and low overall\nceived Medicaid compared to 25% of blacks (Na-\ntional Council of la Raza, 1992). Although rates of\nhealth insurance coverage are low for Hispanics as a\npopulation, they differ greatly depending upon spe-\ncific nationality group. Among Hispanics, Central\nand South Americans and Mexican Americans have\nthe lowest levels of health insurance coverage (ap-\nand 79% of other Hispanics had some form of health\ninsurance (National Council of la Raza, 1992).\nThis lack of health insurance among Hispanics is\npart of a package that includes low levels of educa-\ntion, high rates of unemployment and underemploy-\nment, jobs that do not provide health benefits, and\nresidence in states such as Florida and Texas that\nhave highly restrictive Medicaid eligibility require-\nments (Dunkelberg, 1992). The consequences of a\nlack of health insurance are serious because in the\nUnited States a lack of health insurance represents a\nmajor barrier to health care (U.S. General Account-\ning Office, 1992). In conjunction with poverty and\nbarriers related to language, culture, and geographic\nlocation, the lack of insurance has serious implica-\ntions for the health and well-being of Hispanic Amer-\nicans (Chesney, Chavira, Hall, & Gary, 1982; Estrada,\nTrevino, & Ray, 1990; Guendelman, & Schwalbe,\ntion is only getting worse because the number of\nuninsured Hispanics is increasing at the same time\nthat the number of uninsured blacks and non-\nHispanic whites is decreasing (National Council,\n1992). If these trends continue as the result of em-\nployer inability to provide health care and attempts\nby the federal and state governments to control the\nrise in the cost of medical care, the health and well-\nbeing of an ever-growing number of both young and\nolder Hispanics may be placed in jeopardy.\nAlthough the problem of a lack of adequate insur-\nance is most serious among the young, among older\nindividuals, Hispanics are also the least likely to be\ninsured. Although estimates vary, it is clear that a\nsubstantial fraction of Hispanics over the age of 65 do\nnot participate in Medicare. Of those who do, a\nsmaller fraction have private health insurance to\ncover the costs that Medicare does not cover. Data\nfrom the 1990 census and from other specialized\nsurveys indicate that although less than 1% of non-\nHispanic white elderly individuals and 2% of black\nelderly individuals reported no health insurance, a\nsubstantial fraction of Hispanics over the age of 65\nreport that they have no health insurance (Andrews,\nData from a survey of Hispanics aged 65 and older\nsponsored by the Commonwealth Fund during the\nmid-1980s and recently collected data from a study of\nMexican Americans over the age of 65 in the five\nSouthwestern states (Markides, Rudkin, Angel, &\nEspino, in press; Westat, Inc., 1989) reveal that, al-\nthough in comparison to non-Hispanic whites a\nhigher proportion of all Hispanic groups report no\nhealth insurance, certain subgroups, such as\nforeign-born Mexican Americans have particularly\nlow rates of coverage. Among foreign-born Mexican\nAmericans, over 12% report that they have no insur-\nance of any sort. Hispanics, as well as blacks, are also\nmore likely than non-Hispanic whites to rely on Me-\ndicaid or Medicare alone and report that they do not\nhave private Medigap or supplemental insurance\npolicies. This lack of private health insurance has\nimportant implications for health care use among\nHispanics because the difference between what Me-\ndicare pays and the actual cost of physician and\nhospital services can be burdensome, especially for\nindividuals on fixed incomes.\nOne of the most obvious reasons for lower rates of\nhealth insurance coverage among Hispanics is their\nhigher rate of nonparticipation in Social Security. In\nported receiving Social Security, compared with 88%\nof blacks and 93% of non-Hispanic whites (National\nCouncil of la Raza, 1992). Although these figures may\nbe exaggerated, they probably reflect significant se-\nlective nonparticipation among Hispanics. There are\nmany other possible reasons for lower rates of non-\nparticipation in Medicare among older Hispanics and\nfor the lack of private Medigap insurance among\nHispanics generally. For Mexican Americans, citizen-\nship status may represent a barrier (Estrada et al.,\n1990). Many older Mexican Americans may never\nhave become legal residents of the United States. For\nthose who do not speak English, which is quite com-\nmon among older cohorts, access problems may\nkeep them from seeking medical care or participat-\ning in Social Security (Andersen, Lewis, Giachello,\nThe Consequences of a Lack of Private\nHealth Insurance\nIn the United States, an older individual who lacks\nprivate health insurance is dependent on Medicaid\nto pay the deductibles and cost sharing charges that\nMedicare does not cover (Angel, 1994). In the ab-\nsence of private Medigap or supplemental insur-\nance, the coinsurance and deductibles associated\nwith Medicare can represent significant barriers to\nhealth care (Rowland & Lyons, 1987). For the impov-\nerished elderly, Medicaid covers the cost of long-\nterm care and also provides Medigap insurance cov-\nerage that pays the costs that Medicare does not\ncover, which can be quite substantial (Feder,\nRowland, Holahan, Salganicoff, & Heslam, 1993). For\nexample, in 1992, under Medicare part A, which\ncovers hospital costs, an elderly individual was re-\nquired to pay a deductible of $652 and to pay a\nportion of the cost of long stays as part of a cost-\nsharing provision. Under part B of Medicare, which\ncovers physician services and ambulatory care, a\nperson had to pay an annual premium of $382, and a\nindividuals with incomes below 100% of poverty,\nMedicaid pays the Part B premium and the cost-\nsharing part of Part A.\nEven with its limited coverage, therefore, Medicaid\nprovides an important safety net for older Americans\n(Rowland, Feder, Lyons, & Salganicoff, 1992). Each\nyear, large numbers of older persons spend down\ntheir assets and become destitute paying for nursing\nhome care (Burwell, Adams, & Meiners, 1990). Oth-\ners are poor enough to qualify for assistance from\ntheir initial entry into a long-term care facility (Wie-\nner & Hanley, 1992). For both groups, Medicaid as-\nsumes the burden of paying for long-term care\nShort, Kemper, Cornelius, & Walden, 1992; Spence\n& Wiener, 1990). It is clear that in the absence of the\nMedigap coverage provided by Medicaid, more indi-\nviduals would forego medical care, and most poor\nindividuals would have to manage in the community\nrather than enter a nursing home when they became\nseriously disabled.\nThe reasons for high rates of nonparticipation in\nMedicare by older Mexican Americans are, as yet,\npoorly understood. Because most estimates of the\nnumber of uninsured individuals are based on self-\nreports of insurance coverage, we cannot even be\nsure they reflect the true state of affairs. Yet both\nanecdotal evidence and a growing body of empirical\nevidence find surprisingly similar levels of nonpartic-\nipation, suggesting that there may be a great deal of\nunmet need for health care among elderly Mexican\nAmericans and other minority elderly individuals in\nthe community. Such a possibility has important im-\nplications for health care financing reform and for\nhealth care policy generally.\nThe vast majority of Americans over the age of 65\nhave private Medigap policies to cover the physician\nand hospital charges that Medicare does not pay. For\nthe most part, this coverage represents the extension\nof employer-sponsored plans or privately purchased\nMedigap policies. For the majority of retired Ameri-\ncans, therefore, their health insurance package con-\nsists of Medicare as the core, and supplemental pri-\nvate policies. A certain fraction have privately\npurchased long-term care insurance policies, al-\nthough these remain fairly rare. For poor elderly\nindividuals, their health insurance package consists\nof Medicare as the core and Medicaid as the supple-\nment. For those who do not qualify for Medicaid and\nwho have no private insurance, the alternatives are\nlimited. Either they must pay for what Medicare does\nnot cover out of pocket or they must do without\nservices.\nWho Falls Through the Cracks?\nThe income and health insurance situation of older\nindividuals is best understood from a life-course per-\nspective in which one's economic and insurance situ-\nation in later life is related to the nature and course of\none's working life (Smith, 1995). In the United States\nthe principal source of health insurance for working-\nage individuals and their families is employment. Yet,\nmany marginal jobs do not provide health insurance,\nand a disproportionate number of Hispanics hold\nunder the age of 65 had health insurance provided by\nan employer or a relative's employer. Among non-\nHispanic whites approximately 70% had employer-\nbased policies and among blacks, slightly more than\n46% had such coverage (National Council of la Raza,\n1992). Of course, jobs that do not provide insurance\nto working-age individuals are unlikely to provide\ncoverage to workers once they retire.\nThe health care safety net, therefore, appears to be\nseriously frayed for blacks and certain Hispanic\ngroups. In what follows, we examine the health in-\nsurance profile among Hispanics and identify certain\nfactors that are associated with lower rates of insur-\nance coverage among these groups. As the review of\nprevious research revealed, there are large differ-\nences between specific nationality groups both in\nthe extent and type of coverage, as well as in factors\nassociated with both public and private insurance\ncoverage. The following analyses are based on the\nlargest possible sample of Hispanics and include\nindividuals of all ages. Unfortunately, the number of\nCuban-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other Hispan-\nics is simply too small to support separate analyses or\neven the estimation of stable coefficients in pooled\nanalyses. Rather than dropping them from the analy-\nsis or pooling them with Mexican Americans for\nwhom there are sufficient numbers for separate anal-\nyses, we treat them as a separate pooled category,\nother Hispanics.\nBefore proceeding, it would be useful to speculate\non the quality of self-reported data concerning\nhealth insurance. For the most part, individuals tend\nto know little about the details of their health insur-\nance coverage until they use it. Although we are not\nfocusing on such details as of copayments or deduct-\nibles, it is likely that many people, even those who\nare financially informed, are not fully aware of the\ncoverage options included in their plans. Nonethe-\nless, for present purposes, self-reports provide infor-\nmation on broad levels of coverage.\nAnalytic Approach\nIn order to assess the extent and type of insurance\ncoverage among Hispanics, we employ the first wave\nof the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), a nation-\nally representative longitudinal study of employ-\nment, income, assets, health, and retirement plans\nof a sample of pre-retirement age individuals begun\nspouses. The total sample consists of 12,654 individ-\nHispanics. In addition to much other data, informa-\ntion was collected on demographics, physical health\nand disability, income amounts and sources, assets,\nand health insurance coverage. Information on\nemployer-based plans, privately purchased plans,\nMedicare, Medicaid, and Veterans and Civilian\nHealth and Medical Program of the Uniformed Ser-\nvices (CHAMPUS) coverage was obtained. A great\ndeal of information on the nature of the coverage\nwas also provided by the financially knowledgeable\nrespondent.\nIn the following analysis we treat the family as the\nunit of analysis. In the vast majority of cases, health\ninsurance policies cover a worker and his or her\nspouse so our approach is to characterize the health\ninsurance coverage of the insured unit. Although\nindividuals outside of the target age range of 51 to 61\ndo not constitute a representative sample of individ-\nuals, the households in which they reside are a repre-\nsentative sample of households, and in the following\nanalyses the household is our unit of analysis. We are\nalso concerned with characteristics of the primary\nhealth insurance plan because the vast majority of\nhouseholds have either none or one. For couples,\nour approach required combining spouse records to\nmake it possible to relate insurance coverage to\ncharacteristics of both spouses. In the following de-\nscriptive analyses, all statistics are weighted to reflect\npopulation level parameters.\nWe begin our examination of the data by first\nexamining the basic economic situations of the vari-\nous groups. Table 1 shows that, in comparison to\nnon-Hispanic white households, Hispanic and black\nhouseholds have both extremely low assets and low\nincomes. This is particularly true for Mexican Ameri-\ncans who consistently fare the worst in terms of\nhealth insurance coverage. Female-headed house-\nholds are particularly disadvantaged in comparison\nto male-headed or couple-headed households.\nClearly, these disadvantaged groups are unlikely to\nbe in a position to purchase their own private health\ninsurance on the open market or to be able to bear\nthe cost of expensive medical care.\nTable 2 presents information on the type of health\ninsurance coverage reported by the household re-\nspondent. Again, the information is presented sepa-\nrately for male- or couple-headed households and\nfor female-headed households. In this and the fol-\nlowing analysis we include VA and CHAMPUS cover-\nage in the private category, which includes\nemployer-based coverage. Exploratory analyses re-\nvealed that these individuals are similar to those with\nprivate insurance and that there are few enough so\nthat almost any categorization produces the same\npatterns. What is particularly striking in this table is\nthe high proportion of blacks and Hispanics who\nreport no health insurance of any sort. Among Mexi-\ncan Americans, 40% of male or couple-headed\nhouseholds and nearly 40% of female-headed house-\nholds report no health insurance. Again the table\nmakes it clear that the core of the problem lies in very\nlow rates of private health insurance. Mexican Amer-\nicans are the least likely of any group to be covered\nTable 1.

The lack of private health insurance is\nassociated with a greater reliance by blacks and His-\npanics on Medicare and Medicaid. Not surprisingly,\nblack and Hispanic female-headed households are\nparticularly dependent on Medicaid.\nTable 3 presents information on various aspects of\nhealth care coverage among those who are em-\nployed or who own a health insurance policy. The\nstatistics are again presented separately for the com-\nbined category of male- or couple-headed house-\nholds and female-headed households. The first line\nin each panel refers to whether or not the employer\noffers any retirement health plan. Of course, not all\nemployers offer a health plan even to their current\nemployees, and the next sections of the table refer\nonly to those employees with a plan. The final group\nof statistics within each headship panel refer to pri-\nvate health insurance the household has purchased\nfor itself and again only refers to a subset of the total\nsample, those with privately purchased coverage.\nThe statistics in this table reveal certain differences\namong aspects of health insurance coverage for the\nvarious groups, but no really clear pattern emerges.\nWhat is again noticeable is that Hispanics are much\nless likely than either blacks or non-Hispanic whites\nto have private health insurance. They are also less\nlikely to report that their retirement plan includes\nhealth care coverage. Despite these differences,\nhowever, what this table in conjunction with the\nprevious table really shows is that although Hispan-\nics may suffer some disadvantage in the type of\ninsurance they have, the real difference between\nHispanics and other groups is in the likelihood that\nthey will have health insurance at all. Once one is the\nmember of an employer-based insurance pool, the\nTable 3.

The big difference between Hispanics and\nblacks and non-Hispanic whites, therefore, is in ac-\ncess to even basic coverage.\nBecause it is clear that employment is a major\nfactor in determining health insurance coverage, in\nTables 4 and 5 we examine the employment charac-\nteristics of the various groups, again separately for\nmale- or couple-headed households and for female-\nheaded households. Table 4 refers to male- and\ncouple-headed households and shows that a smaller\nfraction of blacks and Hispanics are employed. Em-\nployment among Mexican American wives is particu-\nlarly low. The table also reveals that a larger fraction\nof black and Hispanic husbands report a work-\nrelated disability. Perhaps reflecting their younger\nage, a smaller fraction of Hispanic males than either\nblacks or non-Hispanic whites are retired.\nA rather large fraction of non-Hispanic white males\nreport t!iat they work more than 40 hours a week, a\npattern that is consistent with a professional lifestyle\nand higher incomes. Longer hours can represent\neither overtime in blue collar jobs or professional\nnorms of dedication to a profession. In any case, it is\nlikely that this pattern reflects white males' greater\naccess to high quality health insurance. The data on\noccupation support this possibility. A larger fraction\nof non-Hispanic white males than either blacks or\nHispanics are employed as managers and profession-\nals. Indeed only slightly over 7% of Mexican Ameri-\ncans are managers or professionals. Conversely, a\nlarger fraction of blacks and Hispanics than non-\nHispanic whites are employed in protective, health,\npersonal services, or farming or are unemployed or\nin the armed forces. These data, therefore, clearly\nshow significant occupational differences that are\nassociated with differential access to health insur-\nance coverage. Table 5, which refers to female-\nheaded households, reveals similar patterns, but\nwith lower overall rates of employment for female\nheads of household.\nThese descriptive findings suggest that lower em-\nployment rates, as well as employment in jobs that\nmay not provide health insurance at least partially\naccount for differences between Hispanics and non-\nHispanic whites. In order to test the extent to which\nlower black and Hispanic insurance rates are ex-\nplained by other insurance-related economic and\nhousehold factors, we employ a multinomial logistic\nregression in which the dependent variable is a four-\ncategory descriptor of the household insurance pro-\nfile. The four categories are: (1) private or employer\nbased insurance (including VA and CHAMPUS); (2)\npublic insurance only, which includes Medicare or\nMedicaid; (3) both private or employer and public\ninsurance; and (4) no insurance at all. In order to\naccount for all possible differences between black,\nHispanic, and non-Hispanic white households, we\ninclude a large number of insurance-related vari-\nables as well as other characteristics of the husband\nand wife. These include race and Hispanic ethnicity\n(Mexican American and other Hispanic), age, educa-\ntion, and nativity status of the household head,\nhousehold income, employment status of the hus-\nband and wife, the disability status of both husband\nand wife, the retirement status of both husband and\nTable 4.

The occupational categories are\nprofessional/managerial; sales, clerical, and admin-\nistrative; service, cleaning and food preparation;\nprotective services, health, and farming; mechani-\ncal, construction, and self-employed. In the multino-\nmial regression, the reference for these categories is\nunemployed. Dummy variables are included to indi-\ncate missing data on each variable for both the hus-\nband and wife.\nIn Table 6, the reference category is having no\ninsurance, and each of the equations expresses the\nprobability of having each of the first three types of\ninsurance as opposed to none. In these models, a\nnegative coefficient reflects an increased likelihood\nof having no insurance as opposed to having each of\nthe other three combinations. Because female-\nheaded households are so different from couple-\nheaded households, these models refer only to cou-\nples. The basic patterns that emerge for single female\nheads, however, are basically similar to those for\ncouples. Because the entire model contains a large\nnumber of coefficients, only those that are signifi-\ncant are presented.\nOur only real objective in this table is to determine\nif this large group of insurance-related variables ac-\ncounts for differences in insurance coverage be-\ntween the various groups. The model indicates that,\nafter controlling for the other insurance-related fac-\ntors, there is no statistically significant difference\nTable 6.

Note that\nbetween non-Hispanic blacks and whites in the\nprobability of any form of insurance coverage. For\nHispanics, however, the situation is entirely differ-\nent. Even after controlling for the large number of\ninsurance-related correlates, Mexican Americans are\nstill much less likely than non-Hispanic whites or\nblacks to have private health insurance or a combina-\ntion of public and private. Other Hispanics are both\nless likely to have private insurance and more likely\nto rely solely on public health care coverage.\nDiscussion\nThe Health and Retirement Study, therefore, adds\nanother piece of evidence to a growing body of\nliterature that shows extremely low levels of health\ninsurance coverage among Hispanics and especially\namong Mexican Americans. This serious lack of in-\nsurance in the years prior to retirement means that a\nlarge fraction of Hispanics will have no supplemental\ninsurance once they do retire. Individuals who are\ninadequately insured prior to retirement are unlikely\nto be any better off after retirement. In light of the\nsubstantial burden that the copayments and deducti-\nbles associated with Medicare can represent for indi-\nviduals on a limited income, this trend suggests that a\nlarge proportion of older Hispanics may have only\nminimal coverage (Rowland & Lyons, 1987). Evidence\nwe cited earlier indicates that a larger fraction of\nHispanics than non-Hispanics do not participate in\nMedicare, and it may well be that cost is a major\nreason.\nAt a very practical level, this lack of insurance has\nserious consequences for health because the lack of\nhealth insurance is a major barrier to obtaining nec-\nessary medical care (Aday, Andersen, & Fleming,\nsured Hispanics increased at the same time that the\nnumber of uninsured blacks and non-Hispanic\nwhites decreased (National Council of la Raza, 1992).\nThe increasing fiscal crisis in health care and the\nrestrictions to access that are likely to be put in place\nto deal with it can only make this situation worse.\nBecause we do not have universal public health care\ncoverage in the United States, employment is the\nmajor source of health insurance for working-age\nindividuals and their families. For the poor, Medicaid\nserves as the health care safety net. For the working\npoor who hold jobs that do not provide health insur-\nance and who do not qualify for Medicaid, there are\nfew alternatives. For those whose incomes must be\nused for basic subsistence, medical care is often a\nluxury or something that can only be obtained as\ncharity.\nThe tie between employment and health insurance\nis clearly the major factor in determining low rates of\ninsurance coverage among blacks and Hispanics\nand, especially, among Mexican Americans. The HRS\ndata clearly show low rates of insurance associated\nwith employment disadvantages for all groups. Yet,\neven after controlling for employment status, Mexi-\ncan Americans still have lower levels of health insur-\nance coverage than either non-Hispanic blacks or\nwhites. The reasons for this remain unclear. Numer-\nous barriers to health care have been identified\namong Hispanics, including language difficulties,\ncultural distance between provider and patient, and\na greater reliance on local networks of friends and\nrelatives (Markides, Levin, & Ray, 1985; Valdez,\n1993). To the extent that these factors reduce medical\ncare use, they may also reduce health insurance\ncoverage. For individuals without a great deal of\ncontrol over their lives, the very concept of insur-\nance may seem foreign. For the poor, health insur-\nance is, after all, a luxury that must take a back seat to\nmore basic survival needs. For those with little in-\ncome and no employer-based coverage, a fatalistic\nview of health and health care is not unrealistic.\nOlder, traditionally oriented Hispanics are members\nof cohorts that simply did not expect to be insured\nfor health care, and both cultural expectations and\nreference group factors may lower participation even\nin universal programs like Medicare. Future research\nwill have to focus on the specific cultural, organiza-\ntional, and personal factors associated with the\ngreatly lowered Hispanic health insurance coverage\ndocumented here. As we move into a managed care\nenvironment, understanding both financial and non-\nfinancial barriers to health care for Hispanics be-\ncomes ever more important.\nUnfortunately, although the total oversample of\nHispanics in the HRS is large, the number of Hispanic\nhouseholds with complete insurance information is\nmuch smaller, and the amount of missing informa-\ntion on other variables further reduces the effective\nsample size for multivariate analyses. What would be\nof particular use would be a close examination of\nnationality differences among Hispanics and the abil-\nity to relate those to nativity, migration history, and\nstate of residence, as well as to detailed health status.\nThe HRS data further our appreciation of the impor-\ntant differences between specific Hispanic national-\nity groups. Our analyses revealed large differences\nbetween Mexican Americans and other Hispanics.\nClearly, the possibility of a more detailed analysis of\nPuerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, and other national-\nity groups would be a welcome addition.\nFuture waves of the HRS will allow us to answer\nsome very interesting questions concerning the tran-\nsition from work to retirement and its association\nwith health among Hispanics. They will also make it\npossible to examine changes in health insurance\ncoverage as one moves from work to retirement.\nWave one, however, clearly sets the stage by show-\ning us the magnitude of the difference between the\nextent of health insurance coverage among Hispan-\nics, blacks, and non-Hispanic whites. Even if a por-\ntion of the difference is due to reporting error, these\ndata clearly identify a growing social problem that we\nwill have to address in the years to come.
