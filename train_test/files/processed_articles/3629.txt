Ten years later, countries\nhave to ask themselves how common their external tariff\nreally is. In 2014, countries applied unilateral exemptions on\nmore than a hundred tariff lines, among which were highly\ntraded goods such as vehicles, rice, and cement. The Union's\nDirector General for Customs and Trade, Peter Kiguta, com-\nplains about this practice in an interview with the author\n(Interview 91): \"If the tariff keeps changing, this year it is\nlike this, this year this country asks for that, then this instabil-\nity brings unpredictability for investors and trade.\" This phe-\nnomenon is part of a larger issue in trade policy. Trade\npolicy-making is rarely driven by considerations of welfare,\nbut is a popular tool for redistribution among different inter-\nHowever, when a country enters a CU, a level is added to\nthe process of negotiating tariff levels. Tariff levels towards\nnonmember states are now determined in negotiations among\nthe member states of the CU. Interest groups that were influ-\nential in one state might not be in another while other groups\nmight be able to align their positions across countries.\nSimilarly, interstate bargaining and the CU's institutional\nrules and structures will shape the way that tariffs are set.\nClearly, CUs provide interesting case studies for the field of\ninternational political economy (IPE) to study the forces\nbehind trade policy-making. However, the relatively small\nnumber of existing CUs has limited the number of case stud-\nies thus far. Especially, little attention has been paid to the\nadvances on the African continent. This article will address\nthe East African Community's (EAC) CU in particular, as it\nhas often been referred to as the most advanced regional eco-\nnomic community (African Development Bank, 2014) and\nmay serve as a model for other CUs on the continent.\nThis article will study the political economy of the EAC's\ndiscussing how interest group behavior has contributed to\nthe instability of the CET in this period. Since 2005, coun-\ntries have made increasing use of CET exemption schemes.\nGuided by domestic interests, they often unilaterally applied\na different tariff rate from the CET and avoided the task of\nconsensus-formation on regional CET levels.\nBoth the changes of essential tariff lines in the CET and\nthe wide use of exemption schemes indicate that the CET\n1Hertie School of Governance, Berlin, Germany\nCorresponding Author:\nTobias B\u00fcnder, Hertie School of Governance, Pettenkoferstra\u00dfe 7,\nEmail: tobias.bunder@gmail.com\nHow Common Is the East African\nCommunity's Common External Tariff\nReally? The Influence of Interest Groups\non the EAC's Tariff Negotiations\nTobias B\u00fcnder1\n Keywords\nEast African Community, Customs Union, Common External Tariff, interest groups, business membership organizations\n2 SAGE Open\nplays an important role in protecting certain interests. The\narticle will ask how the instability in the CET can be explained\nand why member states tend to fall back into national exemp-\ntion schemes for some industries, but agree on regional CET\nchanges for others. The article shows that domestic interest\ngroups are effective in proactively influencing member states\nin their stance on external tariffs. The EAC's institutional\nstructure enables states to make use of exemption schemes\nand to put national over regional interests in CET negotia-\ntions. A regional approach to tariff-setting is only taken if\ndomestic interests overlap or transnational industries put\npressure on governments to stick to harmonized CET levels.\nIn its analysis, the article will track lobbying behavior\nfrom the domestic to the regional level. The article will apply\na qualitative approach predominantly drawing on data gath-\nered by the author in 25 key informant interviews. To start,\nthe article will give an overview of the relevant literature.\nSubsequently, the article will explain the framework of anal-\nysis and its methodology. Diving into the case study, the\narticle will provide background information on the EAC CU\nand its CET. As a next step, the article will turn toward the\ndiscussing interest groups in the founding Member States of\nKenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, and then turn to the dynamics\nof CET negotiations on the regional level.\nLiterature Review\nTraditionally, the study of international institutions and\nagreements looked at the level of interstate bargaining (Lake,\n2009). However, literature shows that multiple factors of\ndomestic politics shape the national position in the interna-\ntional arena (Aklin, Arias, Deniz, & Rosendorff, 2015).\nAmong them, interest group politics plays an important role.\nThis literature review will discuss the underlying structures\nof interest group competition in trade policy-making and\ninterest group involvement in political processes, and present\nsome insights on interest group politics on the regional level.\nFoundations of Interest Group Competition\nTo understand the dynamics of interest groups within trade\npolicy debates, one has to outline how losses and gains from\ntrade policy are distributed. Trade theories can give a first\nhint. The Heckscher\u00adOhlin model predicts that trade patterns\ndepend on the factor endowments of an economy. Building on\nthese insights, the Stolper\u00adSamuelson theorem suggests that\ntrade liberalization will benefit the owners of the relatively\nabundant factor and leave the owners of the relatively scarce\nfactors worse off. Resulting from this theory is a class-based\ndivision of policy preferences where owners of capital would\nmostly clash with labor over liberalizing or restricting trade\n(Rogowski, 1990). This seems to have been a reasonable\nassumption in many industrialized countries like the United\nThe major challenge to the Stolper\u00adSamuelson theorem\ncomes from the Ricardo-Viner model. Due to the immobility\nof capital and labor, all actors' preferences for trade policy\ndepend on the industry in which they are situated. Thus, con-\nflict is not along class lines or production factors, but along\nsectors. In a study of industrialized economies, Hiscox\n(2002) finds that trade conflicts have moved from class lines\nto sectors with decreasing factor mobility since the mid-20th\ncentury. Mayda and Rodrik (2005) also present evidence for\nthe Ricardo-Viner model. Conflicts also often occur within a\nsector between manufacturers and traders at different stages\nof the value-chain, which the article will also discuss in the\ncase of the EAC. Underlying all models is the assumption\nthat interests are defined by economic gain. However, other\ndrivers for trade preferences of individuals exist like the\ndegree of nationalist sentiments (Mansfield & Mutz, 2009)\nor a population's education levels (Hainmueller & Hiscox,\n2006). Likewise, other interest groups like civil society orga-\nnizations or international donors in a developing country set-\nting are often overlooked.\nInterest Groups in Trade-Policy Processes\nThe extent to which interest groups may influence trade\npolicy outcomes depends on how they are organized and\nintegrated into policy-making. Grossman and Helpman\npetition between lobbying activities of different groups.\nThis might include legitimate behavior (e.g., researching\non effects of trade policy options), as well as illegal aspects\n(e.g., bribing ministers to protect special interests). The lat-\nter may be especially strong where institutions are weak\nThe main focus of trade policy analysis on this level has\nbeen on firms and industries. The organizational strength of\nconsumers is limited by the free-rider problem and the wide-\nspreadofpotentialwelfaregains(Baldwin,1989).Consumers\nmay only exert an influence on trade policy through their\nvoting behavior. In contrast, firms are often well-organized\nentities that have resources and channels to engage in policy\ndiscussions and are directly affected by policies. The strength\nof industry lobbies depends on the motivation of the largest\nfirm (Bombardini, 2008) as well as industry characteristics\nlike a large capital stock, an inelastic demand function, a\nsmall number of capital owners, and that the industry is geo-\ngraphically concentrated. The immobile factors in the manu-\nfacturing sector seem to be more concentrated in developing\ncountries (Hung & Quyen, 2007) than the mobile factor.\nHence, capital and land are often better organized in devel-\noping countries than labor or small-scale farmers. In devel-\noping countries, firm heterogeneity determines their\ninvolvement in policy-making: Factors like employment\nsize, government ownership, age, or participation in business\nassociations matter for lobbying influence (Hall & Deardorff,\nDomestic political institutions will affect trade policy-\nmaking by aggregating the preferences of interest groups and\ndetermining if and how these groups can turn their interests\ninto policy. Here, political systems matter with some evi-\ndence pointing to stronger business influence in democracies\nthat, the type of representative framework plays a role.\nLobbying tends to target different institutions depending on\nwhether the country follows a majoritarian or proportional\nrepresentation system parties (Grossman & Helpman, 2001;\nPersson & Tabellini, 2002). Yet, the structure of domestic\ninstitutions in the EAC only partially reflects the political\nrealities including issues like ethnic voting, corruption, or\noverly dominant political leaders. Thus, the article will not\ngo deeper into this issue when analyzing interest group poli-\ntics in trade policy-making.\nInterest Groups on a Regional Level\nMoving up from the domestic level, the article will also\nstudy the influence of regionally organized interest groups\non the CET negotiations. The European Union (EU) provides\nan advanced case study of the impact of interest group influ-\nence in a regional integration context. Moravscik (1998) sees\ndomestic interest groups as the main driver of EU integra-\ntion. Transnationally organized lobby groups often helped to\nbuild bargaining agreements (Moravscik, 1993). With regard\nto trade policy-making, D\u00fcr (2008) finds that EU trade pol-\nicy strongly reflects the preferences of economic interest\ngroups. Business groups that are active on multiple levels of\nEU policy-making and target domestic as well as regional\nprocesses are the most successful in getting their voices\nheard (Eising, 2004). Resource-rich groups are the most\neffective lobbying groups in the EU context. Likewise, busi-\nness associations tend to be more active on the regional level\nthan civil society or other nonbusiness groups (D\u00fcr & Mateo,\nmainly successful in targeting technical aspects of policy\nrather than more fundamental political directions. Yet, over-\nall there is no clear tendency in the literature if integration\nhas given interest groups better or worse access to political\nprocesses (Eising, 2008). This article may contribute to the\noverall discussion by discussing evidence from both the\ndomestic and regional level in the EAC.\nThoughts on Research Method and\nModel\nThe article will connect the instability in the CET to the poli-\ntics of interest groups discussed above. Given the very lim-\nited number of studies on interest group politics and the EAC\nCET available, the article will adopt an exploratory approach\nExploratory research can be a helpful approach to gain\ninsights into previously unstudied fields and understand\nactors and processes in the background. Unlike confirmatory\nresearch, it cannot test hypotheses, but helps to form assump-\ntions and ideas (Stebbins, 2001). Thus, this article will limit\nitself to setting out bold assertions (Emmel, 2013) for its\nanalysis. It will then present and discuss evidence for and\nagainst those assertions gathered with exploratory methods.\nThe research is built around 25 semistructured expert\ninterviews that the author conducted in Kenya, Tanzania, and\nUganda. The existing literature on the EAC CU is limited and\nfocuses mainly on trade and welfare effects of the CU (Buigut,\nnegotiation dynamics and industry-specific details, the author\nneeded to collect new data. Expert interviews are considered\nan effective tool in exploratory research, as they provide fast\naccess to an unknown field and provide a high insight in\naggregated and specific knowledge (Bogner, Littig, & Menz,\npersons who have privileged access to information about\ngroups of persons or decision processes at stake.\nIn exploratory research, the selection of cases or inter-\nviewees cannot be random, but rather follows a purposeful\nsampling strategy, as one wants to analyze the richest and\nthe case of this article, the author talked to representatives of\nministries responsible for trade, revenue authorities, and pri-\nvate sector stakeholders and selected other experts on the\ntopic in all three countries. In addition, interviews were held\nwith key officers at the EAC Secretariat as well as with the\nEast African Business Council. While some key informants\nwere selected based on their positions within organizations,\nothers followed by a snowballing method (Bogner et al.,\n2009) meaning that already interviewed experts allowed\naccess to additional interviewees.\nInterviewing experts as a layperson, as often the case in\nexploratory interviewing, involves an asymmetry in knowledge,\nwhich makes it difficult for the interviewer to follow a struc-\ntured set of questions (Bogner & Menz, 2009). Thus, the author\nused a basic set of interview themes tailored to the organization\nand position of the interviewees. It is important to understand\nthat such exploratory interviews cannot generate completely\nobjective data. Hence, the article relies on anecdotal evidence\nderived directly from the expert interviews, which the author\ndirectly cites from the transcripts. To mitigate this pitfall of\nexploratory research, the author triangulated interview state-\nments by asking for confirmation from other interviewees or\nfinding supportive information in the literature.\nThe author asked all interview partners for their consent to\nbe interviewed, recorded, and quoted in this article with their\nname. Those who did not want to be named are referred to as\nan anonymous representative of their organization. The\nappendix provides an overview of all interviews conducted.2\nFinally, for reasons of scope, resources, and political instabil-\nity, the author did not manage to visit Rwanda and Burundi.\nDue to their small economic size and their presence in transi-\ntion schemes, their omission should not distort results.\n4 SAGE Open\nIn the next section, the article will first outline the phe-\nnomenon it seeks to explain: the instability in the EAC's\nCET (composed of unilateral exemptions and CET changes).\nSubsequently, it will explore evidence on how interest group\nbehavior contributes to the observed CET instability both on\ndomestic and on regional level. Looking at the domestic\nlevel, the research will be guided by the following bold\nassertion:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 If domestic interest groups are strongly organized and\nlobby on tariff policy, government is more likely to\nlook out for special interests in tariff-setting leading to\nmore CET instability.\nNext, the article will explore why states use unilateral exemp-\ntions in some cases and regional solutions in others. Thus,\nthe article will look at both regional CET negotiation struc-\ntures and the role of regional interest groups following two\nbold assertions:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 If tariff-setting is intergovernmental, domestic interest\ngroups will have a higher impact on tariff negotiations.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 If regional interest groups are actively lobbying,\ncountries are more likely to prioritize regional solu-\ntions leading to less CET instability.\nThe EAC CU and the CET\nDesign of the CU and the CET\nThe EAC dates back to colonial times when the British colo-\nnial administration treated the region as one, building rail-\nway lines and establishing a CU in 1919 between what is\nnow Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania (Reith & Boltz, 2011). In\n1967, the newly independent countries formed the first EAC.\nstructural and ideological conflicts (Kibua & Tostensen,\nAfter Uganda settled internal conflicts and Tanzania moved\naway from socialism in the 1990s, the three EAC states\nrestarted cooperation efforts culminating in the formation of\nIt is governed by the Customs Union Protocol (EAC,\n2004b). Countries eliminated tariffs on intraregional trade\nand have introduced a CET. All EAC states are members of\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), but had large room to set\ntariff levels, as their bound tariffs lay far above the applied\nrates. Nonetheless, negotiating the specifications of the CET,\nthe countries had signed up to the idea of open regionalism\naiming at a trade-friendly CET (Interview 9).\nThe EAC CET has three tariff bands: 0%, 10%, and 25%.\nAs an orientation, the first category incorporates raw materi-\nals and capital goods and the second intermediate products.\nThe third band includes most final goods and agricultural\ncommodities produced in the region. Agricultural goods\nattract a simple average tariff of 20.2%, while nonagricul-\nis a list of sensitive products that included 58 tariff lines at\nlist contains mostly agricultural goods as well as a selection\nof locally manufactured items. The list's items were widely\nproduced in the region and should hence receive special pro-\ntection from imports.\nThe CU Protocol included one exemption to the CET, the\nduty-remission scheme (DRS): For the purpose of export pro-\nmotion, countries can annually announce a selection of com-\npanies that may import specific products duty-free as input\nfor manufacturing. In some cases (e.g., sugar for industrial\nuse), industries were chosen jointly as a region. Moreover,\ncountriesapplyforso-called\"staysofapplication.\"Originally,\nthose were meant to smooth the implementation of the CET\nand stay at some pre-CET levels for a transition period. Yet, it\nbecame accepted practice to use the channel to derogate from\nCET for other reasons. Theoretically, states have to prove that\nthey cannot source enough of a product regionally to be\nallowed to apply a lower tariff rate or convince the other\ncountries that their industry needs special protection for a\nlimited time. In practice, derogations are rarely based on evi-\ndence. EAC stakeholders see this third channel as especially\nproblematic and open for abuse (Interview 9).\nAny change of CET or a unilateral derogation of the CET\nhas to be approved by the Council of Ministers, the main\nexecutive body of the EAC. Member states prepare their\npositions on the annual tariff negotiations in consultation\nwith domestic stakeholders. Regional negotiations begin\namong technical staff. However, the political level regularly\nmakes amendments to their recommendations. Political\nvetoes are powerful as the EAC works with consensus-based\ndecision-making. The EAC Secretariat has no supranational\npower in trade and serves predominantly as a facilitator for\nthe negotiations and gives advice on what would be benefi-\ncial for the Community.\nFinally, countries have kept several national support\nschemesthatarenotregulatedonregionallevel.Governments\ndo not have to notify Partner States which industries receive\nrebates. Especially Kenya's \"Tax Remission for Exports\nOffice (TREO)\" has been named as causing distortions of the\nregional market. Yet, this article will focus only on the dero-\ngation channels that are accounted for in the CU. The lack of\nregional oversight makes it hard to analyze schemes like\nInstabilities in the CET\nThis section will give an overview of the instability in the\nCET stemming from both unilateral exemptions and CET\nSecretariat (Interview 1) argue that only a fraction of tariff\nlines have been unstable since the beginning of the CU.\nHowever, the changes incorporate many of the most impor-\ntant tariff lines for local industry and traders like steel,\ncement, transport equipment, and even some agricultural\ncommodities. Private sector representatives also complain\nthat the CET is being undermined by exemptions and changes\n(Interview 15; Interview 16). It is difficult to plan for the\nlong term if tariffs can change every year. The Secretariat's\nDirector General for Trade, Peter Kiguta, worries, \"For me\nas DG, I like to see stability in the CET. That it is predictable.\nThat would let EAC have a better environment for trade and\ninvestors\" (Interview 9).\nLooking at Figure 1, one can see that the total instability\nhas increased since the founding of the CU. For further anal-\nysis, it is also interesting to focus on which industries have\nbeen in the center of the fluctuations and in which countries\nnational approaches occur especially frequently.\nIn Table 1, one can see that unilateral derogations from\nthe CET have strongly increased from only about 15 to 20\n2015, respectively. Similarly, changes to the regional CET\nhave also been made more frequently.\nLooking at the type of goods featured in Table 1, one can\nidentify several categories that appear prominently. First, the\nagricultural commodities of wheat, barley, rice, and sugar\ncan be found in the unilateral derogations as well as in the\nDRS. However, industrial goods make up the major share of\nderogations. Three product categories appear to be especially\ninteresting to single out for analysis: paper and paper prod-\nucts, cement, and iron and steel products. Paper has been in\nthe DRS of all countries to provide their processing indus-\ntries with cheap inputs. In 2014, 36 tariff lines of paper prod-\nucts were reclassified from final to intermediate goods. Yet,\nKenya as well as Tanzania immediately applied unilateral\nexemptions. Iron and steel products saw a similar develop-\nment. After a short period of unilateral import protection in\nthe Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, the CET was increased on\n17 tariff lines. Though, countries also made further unilateral\nchanges to iron and steel tariff lines. Kenya, Tanzania, and\nUganda unilaterally increased tariffs on additional products\nfor which no regional consensus could be reached. Cement\nused to be initially on the list of sensitive items, but was\nWhen asked to name sectors with regionally active interest\ngroups, interviewees regularly came back to paper, cement,\nand iron and steel products. Accordingly, the subsequent dis-\ncussions in this article will often refer back to these indus-\ntries and discuss connections between these product lines\nand interest group behavior.\nOverall, each derogation and CET change appears very\nselective and industry- or even product-specific rather than\nbeing part of a greater trade policy agenda. This indicates\nthat tariffs have increasingly been used to cater for domestic\nor regional interest groups. The subsequent analysis will take\na closer look at this relationship.\nAnalysis\nDomestic Level\nThis section will discuss several explanatory factors for the\ninstability of the CET within domestic politics of tariff nego-\ntiations before moving on to study the regional negotiation\ndynamics. It looks at evidence around the first bold assertion\npresented earlier: If domestic interest groups are strongly\norganized and lobby on tariff policy, government is more\nlikely to look out for special interests in tariff-setting leading\nto more CET instability. The article will first give an overview\nof major interest groups and their preferences on tariffs in the\nthree countries. Thereafter, it will analyze how interest groups\nare organized domestically and to which degree that has\nhelped them to realize their preferences in tariff negotiations.\nMapping domestic interest groups and their tariff preferences.To\nunderstand the landscape of interest groups, one has to estab-\nlish how the interests in tariff levels are distributed among\nstakeholders. For this, we look at the manufacturing sector,\nthe agricultural sector, and government interests. Most man-\nufacturing industries favor higher tariffs on goods similar to\ntheir production profiles, as they struggle to compete on\nprice with imports. A competition between interests in manu-\nfacturing arises between vertically integrated companies and\nprocessing companies. A product of Producer A might be an\ninput for Producer B. Producer A is interested in higher tar-\niffs to protect it from imports. Producer B, however, prefers\nto import the same product cheaply and would like to see\nlower tariffs. Kiguta (Interview 9) states that this was the\nmajor line of conflict in the negotiations for the CET. Several\nindustries identified in the section \"Interest Groups on a\nRegional Level\" as having a highly unstable CET experience\nthis upstream versus downstream conflict.\nThis was, for example, the case for the regional paper\nindustry. A small number of paper producers in Tanzania and\nKenya managed to secure high tariffs on imports of raw\nFigure 1. Data: EAC gazettes.\nNote.

In the iron and steel industries, a similar development\ntook place. The steel value-chain has four major production\nsteps (Interview 12): Most of the smaller producers in the\nthree countries are active in processing intermediate steel\nproducts into construction material like roofing sheets or\nwire mesh. Yet, a few larger companies are engaging in the\nproduction of such intermediates from raw iron and steel.\nThese manufacturers have long been lobbying for protective\ntariffs, but politicians kept tariffs at 10%, mostly for the ben-\nefit of downstream processors, the construction industry and\ntheir electorate, which tends to be particularly price-sensitive\nin low-income countries.\nFor the agricultural producers, the interests are more\nhomogeneous. While there are larger producers in wheat or\nsugar, most farms are small scale. However, all groups\ndepend on protection through tariffs. Lower tariffs on the\nimport of staple produce such as beans or maize would\nthreaten the livelihood of many. In this sense, food is more\nsensitive than manufactured products, as the majority of pop-\nulation works in agriculture in all three countries (ILO,\n2012). Competition between interest groups enters via the\nfood-processing industries, which are interested in cheap\nimports of wheat, sugar, and barley. To give producers cheap\naccess to these inputs without opening the door for consumer\nimports, all countries use the DRS for these goods in most\nyears. In addition, Kenya has been derogating from the CET\nnearly every year since its existence by applying lower tariffs\non rice and wheat, while Tanzania and Uganda did the same\nfor wheat alone. This could be linked to urban consumers'\ninterests in lower food prices which can be enabled by reduc-\ning import tariffs on selected staple food.\nThinking about different interest groups among produc-\ners and consumers, one has to take into account the particu-\nlar interests of governments regarding tariffs, too. Two\naspects could be especially relevant in this regard: consid-\nerations of public revenue and private interests of govern-\nment officials. Revenue aspects were at the center of the\ndiscussions of the CU, but ended up not being highly influ-\nential. Since the existence of the CU, the shares of customs\nand other import duties of total government revenue have\ndecreased in all three countries. Yet, there was consensus\nduring the initial negotiations that revenue aspects should\nnot motivate CET decisions and undermine the policy of\nopen regionalism (Interview 9). The countries accepted that\nthey had to look for alternatives to replace revenue losses\nfrom lower tariffs (Interview 17). While certain tariffs, for\ninstance, on vehicles (Interview 18), are still important\nfrom a revenue perspective, the influence of these consider-\nations has fallen. For example, cement used to be on the\nsensitive list with a rate of 55% and produced much reve-\nnue due to high consumption. Yet, its tariff rate has been\ngradually reduced, as the affordability of construction proj-\nects increased in importance.\nAn expert from the EU who was involved in the negotia-\ntions on the EAC-EU Economic Partnership Agreement\n(Interview 23) suggested that vested interests of govern-\nments are a decisive factor in EAC trade policy-making. It is\ndifficult to pinpoint where these interests are located exactly,\nbut it is possible to highlight some sectors in each country\nthat are prone to private investments by government offi-\ncials. Transparency International's Country Director for\nKenya, Samuel Kimeu (Interview 10), argues that Kenyan\npolicy-makers often use trade policy to protect their own\nbusiness investments. Top statesmen in government and\nopposition are often family members of business leaders.\nKimeu further argues, \"In any conversation about trade there\nis an uncle that will be missed\" (Interview 10). Kenyan poli-\nticians often come from Kenya's richest families that have\ninvested in agriculture, as well as into certain areas of manu-\npresident, Uhuru Kenyatta, in office since 2013, and his fam-\nily dominate the regional dairy market, for example. Jensen,\nStrycharz, and Keyser (2010) argue that vested interests are\nparticularly visible in this area. Dairy received stable protec-\ntion in the CET with yoghurt and cheese as the only products\nto be added to the sensitive list since 2015.\nIn Tanzania and Uganda, politicians are less invested in\nproductive industries (Interview 20). Political stability in\nKenya brought about elite networks in which business and\npolitical power are often combined in a family or single per-\nson (Spooner & Ngunyi, 2006), while politicians in Uganda\nand Tanzania have acquired wealth more recently. That also\naffects in which sectors politicians have become economi-\ncally active. In Uganda, the civil war of the 1980s has stopped\npoliticians from moving into long-term manufacturing\ninvestments. They are rather interested in real estate, tour-\nism, or the transport sector (Interview 20; Interview 2). In\nTanzania, socialism made it difficult for politicians to\nbecome players in business for a long time. Nowadays, poli-\nticians'personal interests can be found in construction, trans-\nport and mining, as well as in former state-owned companies,\nespecially in cash crops like sugar, for example (Cooksey &\nKelsall, 2011). In comparison, the degree of proximity\nbetween private and public sector in Kenya is unique.\nBagabo's (Interview 2) opinion gives you a glance into this\nrelationship: \"When you are negotiating [with Kenya] you\ndon't know if you are talking to the government or the pri-\nvate sector.\" Their closeness may allow private sector play-\ners a better access to the negotiation table than in Tanzania or\nUganda.\nThis section has given an overview of different stakehold-\ner's preferences in tariff-setting, showing that manufacturing\ninterests are less homogeneous than in agriculture and that\nrevenue interests have lost importance for governments,\nwhile their members' private business interests may affect\ntariff levels substantially. Based on this landscape of interest\ngroups, the article will continue to study how the level of\norganization of these groups contributed to CET instability.\n8 SAGE Open\nOrganization of interest groups. In this section, the article will\nanalyze how the interest groups discussed above are orga-\nnized and how that corresponds to the extent to which they\nbenefit from tariff-setting.\nIn Kenya, unilateral tariff increases imply higher protec-\ntion from imports for a wide array of manufacturing indus-\ntries including iron and steel processors, paper manufacturers,\nor fishing net producers. The number of unilateral tariff dero-\ngations has been higher than in the other two countries com-\nbined (see Table 1). Even though its manufacturing sector is\nthe biggest in the EAC, with 12% of value-added to national\nGDP and 7% of overall employment, it still makes up only a\nsmall share of the economy. Thus, the sector receives a dis-\nproportional amount of import protection. Part of the reason\nmay be that the Kenyan manufacturers are strongly orga-\nnized and are highly engaged in the negotiations of the CET.\nThe Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) is the sole\nrepresentative for the manufacturing sector, and almost all\ncompanies channel their lobbying efforts through the asso-\nciation (Interview 19; Interview 15). KAM is described as\npolitically well connected, having strong technical capaci-\nties, and usually being the first private sector actor for the\ngovernment to consult (Interview 24; Interview 2; Interview\n17). Kenyan public sector representatives have unanimously\nstated that KAM is the most influential domestic negotiation\npartner on tariff issues (Interview 13; Interview 17). All\nmajor CET changes favoring Kenyan industry can be traced\nback to KAM lobbying efforts. Thus, the organizational\nstrength of manufacturers in Kenya helps to explain CET\nchanges to manufacturing's favor.\nAgricultural tariffs have experienced less instability.\nKenya unilaterally decreased tariffs on wheat and rice in\nmany years and allowed companies to import cheap sugar for\nindustrial processing. Generally though, the tariffs remained\nquite high. Yet, the Kenya National Farmers' Federation\n(KENAFF) is less engaged in tariff negotiations compared\nwith KAM. The Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA)\nrepresents agricultural interests on the CET, but in KEPSA,\nagriculture is just one among many sectors (Interview 21).\nThe stable high tariff protection for farmers is more likely to\nbe connected to the political importance of agriculture in\nKenya. With 59% of the working population in agriculture,\nfarmers are a decisive electoral block that needs to be satis-\nfied. The voice of consumer groups is completely missing in\ntariff negotiations in Kenya, but politicians have an interest\nin keeping essential goods affordable to appeal to voters.\nThis could help to explain the constant application of a\nbelow-CET rate on rice which is cheaper to import from Asia\nthan from EAC partners (Interview 17).\nIn the case of Tanzania, the number of unilateral deroga-\nwell as iron and steel processors received some tariff protec-\ntion. This corresponds to the observation that no interest\ngroup involved in the tariff negotiations is well organized.\nThe main representative for the manufacturing sector is the\nConfederation of Tanzanian Industries (CTI). Yet, compared\nwith KAM, the organization has been less successful in unit-\ning the manufacturing sector. A source at CTI (Interview 14)\nstated that they compete with the Chamber of Commerce,\nIndustry and Agriculture (TCCIA) and the Tanzanian Private\nSector Foundation (TPSF) over which organization speaks\non the industry's behalf on tariff issues. As a result, CTI\nindustrial companies with more than 10 employees are part\nof CTI. This creates free-rider problems and prevents a har-\nmonized lobbying approach. Moreover, government is seen\nas less reliable and proactive in engaging with private sector\norganizations on tariff matters. For instance, CTI complained\nabout the government agreeing to a CET increase on iron\nproducts that were inputs for most local processors without\nconsulting CTI on such a proposal. According to CTI, some\nfirms thus prefer to lobby via their private connections with\npolitical decision-makers (Interview 14). In these cases, it\nmight be easier for the government to protect cronies with\nnontariff measures that also shield companies against Kenyan\ncompetition. CTI sees Tanzania's local content clause on\ntobacco for cigarette manufacturing as an example for that\npractice (Interview 14).\nLike in Kenya, agricultural interest groups are not as\ninvolved in discussions about tariffs, but tariff levels have\nremained consistently high with some exceptions: Wheat\nand sugar for industrial production were repeatedly imported\nat a below-CET rate. Moreover, the government issued zero-\nwithout gazetting at the EAC to decrease consumer prices\nmuch to the disarray of local farmers (Cooksey, 2016). Yet,\nmost stakeholders are small-scale farmers and have limited\ncapacity to organize (Interview 6). Their political interest is\nmainly represented through associations of producers of\nexport-oriented cash crops like horticulture, tobacco, or cof-\nfee (Interview 2), as well as in the case of small-scale farm-\ners working in outgrowing schemes for politically better\nconnected food-processing industries like sugar, for exam-\nple. Nonetheless, given that 73% of Tanzanians work in agri-\nculture, there is a political motivation for keeping agricultural\ntariffs high even without organized pressure. Thus, for\nTanzania, the role of organized interest groups in tariff-set-\nting is less clear. Special interests find their way into the\nnegotiations, but rather via more informal networks. For\ninstance, Bagabo (2012) states that the unilateral tariff reduc-\ntions on heavy-duty vehicles were mainly due to pressure\nfrom powerful importers with direct links to government.\nFinally, in Uganda, unilateral tariff increases were rare\nbesides protection for some iron and steel products. However,\nUganda has had the highest number of unilateral decreases\nevery year making imports cheaper. With the background of\nUganda being landlocked and dependent on imports, the\nassociation of traders, Kampala City Traders' Associations\n(KACITA), was observed to be influential in negotiations\nlobbying for lower tariffs (Interview 9; Interview 11). The\nUganda Manufacturers' Association (UMA) is also involved\nin the tariff discussions, but faces capacity constraints. For\ninstance, a board member of Roofings, the largest Ugandan\nmanufacturer of steel products, told the author that he had\npersonally to sponsor UMA delegations to be able to join\nregional tariff discussions. In the end, the only national excep-\ntions achieved in the negotiations protected several products\nof Roofings. Due to the weakness of associations, large com-\npanies are also more prone directly to approach government.\nPaul Bagabo, a local trade policy analyst, argues in an inter-\nview: \"The firms no longer see the apex body as important. If\nyou have an issue, you go directly. President Museveni will\nhandle it at that level . . . Most of the powerful private sector\npeople have access to him\" (Interview 2).\nAgricultural groups appear also as less strongly orga-\nnized. A notable exception here is the sugar sector which is\nwell-connected in Uganda (Interview 25). In general, similar\nto Kenya and Tanzania, the political importance of agricul-\nture helps to keep agricultural tariffs high (Interview 11).\nTo conclude this section, let's revisit the bold statement\nfrom the beginning: If domestic interest groups are strongly\norganized and lobby on tariff policy, government is more\nlikely to look out for special interests in tariff-setting leading\nto more CET instability. The analysis has found some evi-\ndence in its favor: In Kenya, where manufacturing was well\norganized, CET derogations to the group's benefit occurred\nfrequently. In Uganda, organized traders coincide with a\nlarge number of import-easing derogations. However, the\narticle also showed that tariff levels have been very favorable\nto other interest groups that did not show high organizational\ncapacity: In agriculture, high tariffs are politically important\ndue to the large share of rural voters in all countries.\nMoreover, a large share of fluctuations in the CET seems too\nspecific to be a result of organized group lobbying and might\nbe better explained by informal relationships between indi-\nvidual companies and political decision-makers. Finally,\nspecial interests of government individuals are harder to\ndetect, but highly influential in the negotiations nonetheless.\nRegional Level\nIn the previous section, the article showed that tariff prefer-\nences in all EAC countries are heavily influenced by domes-\ntic interest groups. All countries have strong domestic\ninterests on their mind when entering the annual CET nego-\ntiations. Subsequently, the author will demonstrate how the\ninstitutional structures of the EAC enable countries to stick\nto these national positions and how regionally active interest\ngroups affect negotiations.\nInstitutional structure and derogations. The article will turn to\nits second bold assertion: If tariff-setting is intergovern-\nmental, domestic interest groups will have a higher impact\non tariff negotiations. This section will show how the\nintergovernmental character of tariff negotiations allowed\nfor the CET instability to evolve, as it strongly facilitates\ninfluence of lobbying on the domestic level.\nAll decision-making in the EAC remains completely\nintergovernmental: The full authority for trade issues lies\nwith the EAC Council of Ministers (EAC, 2004b). While the\ntariff negotiations are conducted on the level of technical\nexperts, the ultimate decision is taken by the national\nMinisters or even Heads of States. This creates a bottleneck\nprone to the influence of special interest groups which are\nwell connected with high-level decision-makers. Moreover,\nall countries have to agree to any small amendment of the\nCET: Every change of individual tariff lines needs full con-\nsent from all member states. Thus, CET negotiations are\ncharacterized by a quid pro quo of national exemptions.\nThere are several examples for this practice. In 2014, the\nlines making inputs cheaper for converters across the region.\nIn 2015, the tariff on 17 iron and steel tariff lines increased\nfrom 10% to 25% protecting local manufacturers of these\nproducts. While these were steps toward more regional solu-\ntions, countries immediately undermined the agreements.\nKenya and Tanzania continued to apply high tariffs on paper\nto protect politically well-connected paper manufacturers.3\nOn iron and steel, all countries unilaterally derogated depend-\ning on the production profiles of their own companies\n(Interview 12; Interview 16) leading to the spike in overall\nderogations notable in Figure 1. Hence, derogations and\nexemption are used to build consensus. Tanzania could agree\nto CET reductions without ceasing to protect its politically\nimportant paper manufacturer. Similarly, countries could\nsettle for the lowest common denominator like in the iron\nand steel case, as they have the security of falling back to the\nexemption schemes.\nWhile derogation and the use of the DRS are a tool to\nbuild consensus, countries need consent to use them. For\ninstance, in the case of paper, Tanzania could not simply\ndecide to continue to apply higher tariffs, but needed the con-\nsensus of all other states. Theoretically, that would give the\nCouncil of Ministers the opportunity to allow derogations\nonly in rare and extreme scenarios, as specified in the\nProtocol. According to the EAC Secretariat (Interview 1;\nInterview 9), countries have to prove that they cannot source\nenough of a product at an acceptable quality and price in the\nregion before applying a lower tariff. However, in practice, a\nform of logrolling takes place in the Council with respect to\nCET decisions (Interview 2): Countries will rarely veto the\nrequest for an exemption, as each country has several similar\ndemands every year. The practice of mutually accepting uni-\nlateral CET derogations goes back to the negotiations of the\nCU when Kenya and Tanzania gave into a last minute\ndemand by Uganda's president Museveni even before the\nProtocol had been signed (Interview 2). Since then, it became\nvirtually impossible to argue against national derogations.As\nthere is no supranational authority on tariff-setting, the\nexisting decision-making structures and accepted practices\nenable the pursuit of national interests and give room to\ninterest groups to affect CET policies by lobbying their\nnational representatives on the domestic level only. Anthony\nWeru (Interview 21), of the KEPSA, suggests that lobbyists\nhave understood that there is no need to lobby regionally\nwhen national decision-makers have means to achieve\nalmost all their objectives:\nOf course, EAC is intergovernmental when it comes to\ndiscussions. Decisions are made by government officials, so you\nget them at the domestic level. By the time they will be moving\nto Arusha, even the ministry will be interested in protecting its\nprivate sector.\nRegional lobbying and mutual interests.The previous section\nhas outlined reasons why EAC Partner States manage to\npush for their national preferences and use exemption\nschemes. Nevertheless, harmonized CET changes have hap-\npened in several cases. As unilateral derogations could be\nconnected to domestic lobbying, regional solutions might be\nlinked to the pressure of regional interest groups. Accord-\ningly, this section discusses the final bold assertion: If\nregional interest groups are actively lobbying, countries are\nmore likely to prioritize regional solutions leading to less\nCET instability.\nMost of the CET changes observed have affected manu-\nfactured goods like iron and steel products, paper, or cement.\nManufacturing is still in its infancy in East Africa, but some\nof the larger industries have reached enough capacity to\norganize on regional level. Interviewees listed the iron and\nsteel manufacturers, paper converters, sugar refineries, and\ncement producers as being especially active on the regional\nthe CET on raw paper products, which was popular with\npaper converters. In 2015, the EAC increased the CET on a\nwide range of iron and steel products. Those were the first\ntwo incidences of a comprehensive use of CET to support\nregionalinsteadofnationalindustryinterests.Representatives\nof the EAC Secretariat argue that this can mainly be contrib-\nuted to the regional approach of the industries:\nYou would not believe it, but all the [iron and steel] associations\nin Partner States had the regional approach. They all told us the\nsame things. Even when they are not manufacturing a product\nthey say there is a potential and you should protect. (Interview 1)\nIn the case of cement, the outcome is less obvious, as the\nCET did not change to the industries' favor. However, the\nindustries' regional lobbying efforts lead to regional debates\nabout CET levels on their products. The level of cement tar-\niffs was one of the most contentious debates in the CET\nlobby effort of the industry (Interview 16). The EAC even\nconducted a study that proposed an increase in cement tar-\niffs, but Partner States ultimately decided against it.\nRegional lobbying uses two approaches: On one hand,\nnational associations have harmonized their proposals on tar-\niff levels to their respective domestic ministries. On the other\nhand, the regional association works through the umbrella\nlobby, the East African Business Council (EABC), which\ncan also submit official proposals on the CET to the negotia-\ntors. All in all, every important debate about wider CET\namendments can be connected to the effort of a regional\nindustry lobby. This finding supports what the article already\nsaw on domestic level: Private sector groups can actively\ninfluence CET levels. Yet, most industries may find it easier\nor less costly to lobby domestically. The existence of the\nexemption regime makes this option more likely to succeed.\nIndustries that managed to organize regionally tend to be\ncharacterized by larger companies that have invested in mul-\ntiple EAC countries and a concentrated number of investors\n(Interview 1; Interview 16). Especially, Kenyan companies\nhave established subsidiaries in Tanzania and Uganda.\nRoofings, Uganda's largest iron and steel company, stated\nthat they used to focus on domestic lobbying, but started to\ncooperate with regional players after they started to invest in\nneighboring countries (Interview 12). In cement, several\ninvestors have shares in companies across the region. For\nexample, the French company Lafarge owns shares in all\nthree countries (Lafarge, 2016). Thus, being active in multi-\nple countries facilitates regional organization, but also means\nthat a distorted CET through derogations makes it harder to\noperate across countries. Hence, a regional presence\nincreases a firm's preference for a stable CET and against\nnational exemptions.\nIn agriculture, regional lobby groups also exist but are\noverall less involved in CET negotiations. Nonetheless, there\nare fewer cases of unilateral derogations by states than in\nmanufacturing. While in manufacturing production profiles\ndiffer more strongly and national interests diverge, farmers\nacross the region grow similar crops facilitating govern-\nments' agreement on protective tariffs.\nConclusion\nSince its introduction in 2005, the EAC's CET has been\nincreasingly destabilized by unilateral derogations from the\nCET in a wide range of strongly traded tariff lines. This\ninstability in the CET worries private sector and EAC repre-\nsentatives alike. The article has discussed how the influence\nof domestic interest groups may affect tariff negotiations and\nthe resulting CET instability.\nCountries enter tariff negotiations with a strong domestic\nfocus. Governments look out for organized business groups\nand other vested interests. Institutions are susceptible to spe-\ncial interests, and personal networks play an important role\nfor the outcome of policies. Kenya especially has a well-\norganized manufacturing sector that manages to align its\ninterests with decision-makers in government. Yet, the pref-\nerences of large and well-connected industries are accounted\nfor in the tariff negotiation positions of all countries.\nLikewise, all governments seem to be interested to keep\naverage agricultural tariffs high to protect a large rural elec-\ntorate despite repeated derogations for particular sectors like\nrice or sugar. Vested interests of government representatives\nalso reflect in tariff fluctuations.\nThe strong influence of domestic interest groups projects\nitself to the regional level. Discussing CET levels, govern-\nments focus on securing protection for their specific local\nindustries rather than considering what is best for the regional\neconomy. Countries are willing to destabilize the CET to\nsecure national tariff preferences by using exemption\nschemes to an extent that was never foreseen in the CU\nProtocol. Unilateral derogations from the CET have become\nan accepted tool to reach consensus in tariff negotiations. As\nthere is consensus-based decision-making in the EAC, each\ncountry has the power to block decisions if it does not get its\nwill. Accordingly, countries have developed a practice of\nlogrolling from the start. Requests for derogations from the\nCET are usually granted, no matter if the criteria are fulfilled.\nNonetheless, in some cases, regional considerations tri-\numphed over the protection of national interests. This is true\nfor most of the agricultural tariffs, where domestic interests\noverlap and countries agree that the CET should remain high\nand stable to protect farmers and serve as an incentive to\ninvest in the sector. In manufacturing, a harmonized approach\nto tariff levels mostly occurred where industry has managed\nto organize regionally and prefers a harmonized tariff over\nnational protectionist schemes.\nFinally, future research on the EAC CET could also take\ninto account other explanatory factors. Interviewees raised\nissues like the impact of ideology, international market\nprices, or international trade negotiations on CET dynam-\nics. Yet, the results of the paper already offer an interesting\ninsight into the deeper integration dynamics. While lack-\ning ownership of the private sector was one of the key rea-\nsons for failure of the first EAC, it now actively shapes\nEAC politics. Behind all major changes in CET (e.g.,\npaper, steel), the article detected evidence for proactive\nlobbying of private sector groups. The future success of\nthe EAC CU will depend on how well the member states\nand the Secretariat balance the involvement of the private\nsector in the negotiations between lack of interest and\nlobby capture.\nAppendix\nList of Interviewees.\nNo. Name Institution Position\nLocation of\ninterview\nDate of\ninterview\n1 Alexander, Ally &\nTindamanyire, Donald\nEAC Secretariat Customs Officer/Customs\nOfficer\n2 Bagabo, Paul Freelance Researcher, consultant on EAC\ntrade affairs\n3 Bitegeko, Janet Agricultural Council of\nTanzania\nExecutive Director Dar es Salaam,\nTanzania\n4 Felician, Goodfrey Tanzania Revenue Authority Tariff Officer Dar es Salaam,\nTanzania\n5 Ekadu, Francis & Auku,\nGerald\nTransparency International\nUganda\nProgramme Coordinator/\nProgramme Officer\n6 Kafanabo, Buberwa BEST-Dialogue Project Officer, Agri Sector Dar es Salaam,\nTanzania\n7 Kapkirwok, Jason &\nTorrero, Eugene\nTrade Mark East Africa Senior Director/Country\nDirector, South Sudan\n8 Kidulele, Gloria Tanzania Ministry of Industry\nand Trade\nTrade Officer Dar es Salaam,\nTanzania\n9 Kiguta, Peter EAC Secretariat Director General Customs and\nTrade\n10 Kimeu, Samuel Transparency International\nKenya\n11 Kolou, Francis Uganda Ministry of Trade and\nIndustry\n13 Mwambia, Wanyambura Kenya National Treasury Director Economic Affairs Nairobi, Kenya 8.1.2016\n14 Myenyelwa, Akida Confederation of Tanzanian\nIndustries\nPolicy & Advocacy Specialist Dar es Salaam,\nTanzania\n(continued)\nNo. Name Institution Position\nLocation of\ninterview\nDate of\ninterview\n15 Ndunge, Wambui Kenya Association of\nManufacturers\nExecutive Officer, Policy\nResearch and Advocacy\n16 Njenju, Adrian East African Business Council Trade Economist Arusha, Tanzania 26.1.2016\n17 Ochola, Kenneth Kenya Revenue Authority Deputy Commissioner ,\nCustoms Services\n18 Ogwapus, Annet Uganda Revenue Authority Supervisor International Affairs Kampala, Uganda 13.1.2016\nKikuu, Kiili\nKenya Private Sector\nAssociation/Corporate and\nRegulatory Solutions\nSenior Program\nOfficer/Managing\nDirector\n22 Anonymous Tanzania Ministry of Industry\nand Trade\nRepresentative of Department\nof Industry\nDar es Salaam,\nTanzania\n23 Anonymous European Union Representative from the EPA\nnegotiation team\n24 Anonymous Kenya Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs and Trade\nNote.
