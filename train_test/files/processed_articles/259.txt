Nested in\nthe intervention arm, a randomized trial compared HS\nwith and without a prenatal component.\nSetting: Five primary care clinics in an integrated de-\nlivery system in the Pacific Northwest.\nParticipants: A consecutive sample of 439 pregnant\nwomen(80%ofeligible)wereenrolled.Follow-updatawere\nobtained for 78% when the child was 30 months old.\nIntervention: Families in intervention clinics received\nHS services, including developmental and behavioral\nadvice and risk factor screening. In addition, those ran-\ndomized to prenatal services received 3 home visits dur-\ning pregnancy.\nMain Outcome Measures: Assessed by telephone in-\nterview in the 3 domains of child health and develop-\nment, parenting practices, and parental well-being.\nResults: Intervention was associated with positive out-\ncomes in timely well-child care, immunization rates,\nbreastfeeding, television viewing, injury prevention, and\ndiscipline strategies. Prenatal initiation of services was\nassociated with larger expressive vocabularies at age\n24 months. Mothers who received the intervention\nreported more depressive symptoms, but there was no\nincrease in the proportion with clinically significant\ndepression.\nConclusions: For members of an integrated delivery sys-\ntem, the HS intervention was associated with positive ef-\nfects on children's health and parenting practices.

The content\nof the prenatal visits included informa-\ntion about fetal and infant development,\nhome safety, and the material needs of\nnewborns and infants.9 Families who re-\nceived PP services continued to receive the\nstandard HS intervention from the same\nHSS during the postnatal period.\nOur tests of this intervention package\nfound no incremental benefits of PP (com-\npared with HS only) on parental well-\nbeing, knowledge, or parenting practices\nwhen the infants were 3 months of age.8\nHowever, families who received PP were\nmore satisfied with their pediatric care and\nwere less likely to disenroll from the health\nplan in the 12 months following the child's\nbirth.

A quasi-experimental design was used\nto compare intervention families with families who re-\nceived the health plan's usual complement of pregnancy\nandpediatricservices.Withininterventionclinics,anested\nrandomized trial compared PPHS with HS only.\nMETHODS\nThis clinical trial was conducted from July 20, 1998, through\nNovember 7, 2003, in a large integrated delivery system that\nprovides services to approximately 550 000 people located in\nthe Pacific Northwest. Three clinics received the intervention\nwhile 2 other geographically distant clinics served as compari-\nson sites. Within intervention clinics, enrolled families were\nindividually randomized to receive services beginning prena-\ntally (PPHS) or postnatally (HS only). Data analysis was per-\nRecruitment was by review of obstetrical records in the sec-\nond trimester, followed by a letter of invitation, telephone screen-\ning, and an enrollment visit with study staff. To be eligible, preg-\nnant women had to be at less than 22 weeks' gestation at study\nenrollment, younger than 45 years, English speaking, and plan-\nning to use a study clinic for pediatric care. Enrollment oc-\nvidual randomization was performed centrally, stratified by\nclinic, and blocked in groups of 4.\nINTERVENTIONS\nFour master's-level trained HSSs provided most of the interven-\ntion program's services. Two HSSs had backgrounds in nursing,\none in clinical social work and one in mental health practice. All\nreceived additional training and ongoing education in early child\ndevelopment and in specific aspects of HS.9 Key clinicians and\nother personnel from intervention clinic sites also received in-\ntervention-related training. Enrollees randomized to HS were eli-\ngible to receive postnatal home visits from an HSS; developmen-\ntal advice and parent-initiated telephone support; developmental\nassessments conducted in tandem with scheduled well-child care,\nthe Reach Out and Read literacy program, and other risk-based\nscreening services9; and parenting classes delivered by HSSs.\nThePPparticipantsbegantheinterventionbyreceiving3home\nvisits with their HSS when they were at approximately 20, 27,\nand 34 weeks' gestation.10 The conceptual framework for PP drew\non findings of the psychological transition to parenthood,11 in\nwhich adjustment to the maternal role requires renegotiation of\nthe current family structure to incorporate the unavoidable\nchanges that accompany the birth of a baby. In keeping with this\nframework, the 3 home visits were structured to help parents\ncreateasafe,knowing,andwelcomingenvironmentfortheirnew-\nborn.9 In addition, the PP participants received screening and\nintervention for targeted risk factors, such as smoking, depres-\nsion, and domestic violence. The HSS who provided prenatal ser-\nvices continued to provide the standard package of HS services\nfollowing the birth of the infant. Comparison clinic enrollees re-\nceived the health plan's standard package of well-child pediat-\nric care, outreach, and support services.\nThe Group Health Cooperative Human Subjects Review\nCommittee reviewed the study. Informed consent was ob-\ntained from all participating families.\nMost outcome data were collected by telephone interview of\nmothers at enrollment to the study (at 16-20 weeks' gesta-\ntion), at 7 to 10 days post partum, when enrolled children were\n3 months of age, and again when these children were at 30\nmonths of age. Data on language acquisition were obtained by\nmailed questionnaire at age 24 months. Health plan utiliza-\ntion data were extracted from administrative databases.\nThe overall intervention goal was to improve child health\nand developmental attainment by supporting appropriate parent-\ning practices. Herein, we present findings grouped into the fol-\nlowing 3 domains: child health and development, parenting prac-\ntices, and parental well-being.\nChild Health and Development\nWe used immunization delivery and attainment of timely age-\nappropriatewell-childcareasintermediatehealthoutcomes.Well-\nchild visits occurring within 60-day windows centered around\nmonths were counted as \"timely\" preventive care. Among those\ncontinuously enrolled for the first 2 years of life, the health plan's\nstandard Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set mea-\nsure was used to identify children whose immunizations were up-\nto-date at age 24 months (4 diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and\npertussis vaccines [or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids with acel-\nlular pertussis vaccines], 3 oral polio vaccines or inactivated po-\nliovirus vaccines, 1 measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, 2 Haemophi-\nlus influenzae type b vaccines, and 3 hepatitis B vaccines).12\nWhen enrolled children were 24 months old, parents com-\npleted a questionnaire that included elements of the short and\nlong forms of the MacArthur Communicative Development In-\nventories13 assessing single-word expressive vocabulary, word\ncombining (2 words), use of 3 or more word endings, and\nmean length (in morphemes) of the child's 3 longest phrases.\nParental perception of child behavior problems was as-\nsessed at 30 months by telephone using 3 subscales from the\nChild Behavior Checklist.14 These included aggressive behav-\nior, sleep problems, and symptoms related to an anxious or de-\npressed mood.\nParenting Practices\nThe PP and HS interventions promoted parental knowledge of\nchild development, self-efficacy, and developmentally support-\nive parenting practices. Table 1 gives an overview of the con-\ntinuous measures used to assess these constructs. For parent-\ning practices, we used established scales of nurturing behavior15\nand parenting sense of competence.16 We developed and used\na brief measure of self-efficacy for pediatric health care (Table 1).\nOther measures of parenting practices reported herein in-\nclude frequency of activities to promote child development (in-\ncluding reading or playing with the child), maintaining rou-\ntines around bedtime and meal times, and limiting television\nviewing. The proportion of mothers initiating breastfeeding and\nengaging in any breastfeeding beyond 6 months is reported.\n\u00a92006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nMothers' reports of child injury prevention practices were\nsummed to create a 5-point index that reflected the presence\nof a functioning smoke detector (1 point), regular use of a car\nseat (1 point) in the correct position (1 point), and absence of\nfirearms in the home (2 points) or safe storage of any firearms\nreported (1 point). We also asked about the use of 4 common\nhousehold safety items (safety latches, electrical outlet covers,\nstair gates, and poison control center telephone number).\nMothers were asked about specific discipline strategies. The\nproportion reporting any unusually harsh discipline (ie, slap-\nping on the face or spanking with an object) is reported.\nParental Well-being\nThe PP and HS interventions offered screening and referral for\nmaternal depression along with general social support from the\nHSS. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed using a modi-\nfication of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression\nScale17 (Table 1); the scores are reported herein along with the\nproportion of respondents who reported \"feelings of sadness\"\nthat were discussed with someone in the pediatric practice.\nOther measures of maternal well-being included self-\nreported use of any illicit drug and the presence or absence of\nsignificant physical domestic violence in the preceding 12\nmonths (\"Did your partner hit you, shove you, or kick you?\").\n\"Problem drinkers\" were identified according to accepted defi-\nnitions based on reported alcohol consumption.18 Exposure to\nenvironmental tobacco smoke was assessed as the proportion\nof households with current smokers.\nSample size estimates indicated that 100 enrollees per study\ngroup were needed for analysis of our primary outcomes at 30\nmonths. For example, with a total sample of 300, we could de-\nthe outcome measured was continuous.\nWe based all analyses on initial group assignment and made\nadjustments to minimize differences due to the quasi-\nexperimental design. We used generalized linear models with\nrobust variance estimates to account for within-clinic cluster-\ning effects. To identify a parsimonious and consistent set of co-\nvariates for use in adjusted analyses, we examined all demo-\ngraphic data collected. No enrolled family had missing data at\nbaseline for these variables. One variable was selected from any\nhighly correlated pairs. Covariates were included if they dif-\nfered statistically between the intervention and comparison\ngroups at baseline or if inclusion in an analytic model caused\npoint estimates of effect size to vary by more than 10%. Based\non these criteria, maternal education, family income, and sta-\ntus as a first-time parent were used as covariates in our ad-\njusted analyses. To account for norms used in scoring lan-\nguage outcomes, these were also adjusted for the child's sex\nand age at the time of the assessment. For all outcomes mea-\nsured at baseline, we used statistical adjustment for these base-\nline scores, providing a test of the intervention's effect on change\nafter enrollment.\nFor dichotomous outcomes, rate ratios (RRs) from Pois-\nson models are presented. For continuous outcome variables,\nwe report adjusted linear regression coefficients. All estimates\nare reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All analyses\nwere performed using Stata 8.0 (StataCorp LP, College Sta-\ntion, Tex).\nRESULTS\nWomen who agreed to participate in the study (N=439)\nrepresented about 80% of those who were eligible.10 Par-\nticipants in the intervention groups (PPHS vs HS only)\nTable 1.

Parenting support programs have been\nshown to have positive effects among families with young\ninfants at high psychosocial risk.20-25 Our results suggest\nabenefitfromtheuniversalprovisionofparentingandchild\ndevelopment support services to an unselected sample of\nfamilies with health coverage, who ranged from the afflu-\nent and employed to those at greater socioeconomic and\npsychosocial risk. This is a meaningful result.\nThere was no difference in response to the interven-\ntion according to the HSS assigned (data not shown). All\nwere experienced master's-level clinicians. Whether para-\nprofessionals with other backgrounds could produce simi-\nlar outcomes is unknown and should not be assumed.26\nDose-response analyses are an appealing strategy to iden-\ntify the intensity of intervention required to elicit de-\nsired effects; however, they are not applicable in this trial.\nThe intervention was clinic based, involving office staff,\nproviders, and systems of care. The effect of these changes\nin the milieu of care cannot easily be delineated from the\neffect of countable visits or encounters with the HSS.\nDespite the noted improvements in child health and\nparenting practices, the intervention was associated with\nsome undesirable effects. Intervention recipients re-\nported more depressive symptoms and a diminished\nparenting sense of competence that stemmed from less\nsatisfaction in the parenting role. Whether this reflects\nan increase in symptoms or an increased accuracy and\nwillingness to identify and report symptoms is un-\nknown. Differences in neither baseline rates of depres-\nsion nor maternal education explain these findings. For-\ntunately, the number of depressive symptoms in any group\nwas low when enrolled children reached 2\u00bd years old.\nNevertheless, more investigation of the interaction among\nthe intervention, parenting experience, and maternal men-\ntal health outcomes seems warranted.\nA major objective of this study was to test a new model\nfor delivering HS services capitalizing on the strengths\nof an integrated delivery system. To do so, we added a\nprenatal component. Despite increased member satis-\nfaction and decreased health plan disenrollment in the\nearly postnatal period, the only long-term health ben-\nefits from PP seemed to be (1) greater compliance with\nthe 24-month well-child visit, with a concurrent im-\nprovement in immunization status, and (2) modestly in-\ncreased vocabulary production and word combination at\n24 months. Paradoxically, these developmental attain-\nments were seen in a group that reported more depres-\nsive symptoms, more television viewing, and less daily\nreading to the children. These findings in the PPHS arm\ncannot be explained using the data available to us.\nThere are several potential limitations in this trial. Al-\nthough we were gratified to achieve a 78% retention rate\nin the study during 3 years, there remain significant dif-\nferences in the demographic composition of nonrespon-\ndents in the intervention group compared with the UC\ngroup, and within the randomized treatment groups as\nwell. The comparisons between the combined interven-\ntion and UC groups were limited by the quasi-\nexperimental design. Although we adjusted for several\nTable 5.

These must be weighed\nagainst costs of the intervention, its effects on utiliza-\ntion, provider satisfaction, and satisfaction of health plan\nenrollees.
