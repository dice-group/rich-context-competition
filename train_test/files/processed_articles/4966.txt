    "abstract": "Abstract\nImmigration to the United States has been a major catalyst for population growth and is the significant factor in the changing\nracial/ethnic composition of our population. The specific changes in the racial/ethnic mix in United States in recent times\nare due in large part to a surge in immigration from diverse sending countries. However, much of the terminology that\ncontinues to be used in the context of higher education to describe diversity in the student populations are anachronistic\nand serves actually to occlude true diversity. We argue that variables such as country of birth of the student, the country of\norigin of the parent, and parental educational achievement, all have significant impact on the academic progress and success\nof undergraduate underrepresented minority students. These are variables that should be used to disaggregate the traditional\nracial and ethnic categories, to really serve the needs of the increasingly diverse student body. These are not data typically\ncollected by institutions of higher education, but without which appropriate needs assessments and targeted interventions\ncannot occur.\n",

It is beyond the scope of this article to review and/or\nsummarize this history. While terms such as multicultural\neducation, culturally sensitive pedagogy, and diversity and\ninclusivity are widely used throughout the abundant litera-\nture, research assessing the academic achievement gap, as\nwell as the intervention programs directed toward ameliorat-\ning its known contributing factors, continues to use outdated\npopulation categories such as \"Latino,\" \"Hispanic,\" and\n\"Black\" as racial/ethnic and cultural descriptors that fail to\nreflect the compositions of ethnically diverse populations as\nthey occur today. How do we then explain or justify the use\nof these restrictive terms to describe highly complex multi-\ncultural/multiethnic diverse populations and their subethnic\ngroups? Such questions have recently become the focus of\nattention as these restrictive terms inaccurately define the\nethnic composition of today's increasingly diverse U.S.\nundergraduate college student populations. The use of such\nrestrictive and unmatched terms obscures what these confin-\ning categories attempt to describe, and subsequently creates\nmore ambiguity as to what \"diversity\" actually represents in\nboth smaller simplex and larger complex categories of multi-\nethnic populations. It is our opinion that these monolithic\ndescriptors of the college undergraduate minority student\npopulations, in fact, constrain the definition of diversity and\nlimit any valid extrapolations on data targeted to design\ninterventions for educational reform. Thus, the term diversity\nas it is used today to label these very diverse multiethnic and\nsubethnic groups inadequately represents all ethnicities in\n1Department of Psychology, State University of New York College at Old\nWestbury, NY, USA\n2SUNY Neuroscience Research Institute, State University of New York\nCollege at Old Westbury, NY, USA\n3Department of Sociology, State University of New York College at Old\nWestbury, NY, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nB.

Treating the increasingly diverse college\nundergraduate student population with a \"one prescription\nfor education fits all approach\" may serve only to maintain,\nor perhaps even widen, the current academic achievement\ngap.\nIn the current context of intense scrutiny regarding educa-\ntional outcomes and assessment in the U.S. public under-\ngraduate 2- and 4-year colleges, the use of descriptors (e.g.,\nLatino, Hispanic, or Black) lacks sensitivity to the true\nchanges in today's diverse college student populations. In\naddition, these descriptors are ineffective in guiding educa-\ntional assessment and further reform processes geared toward\nunderstanding and ameliorating the disparities that continue\nto exist in public colleges and universities. The call for the\ndisaggregation of data is not new. Traditionally, Asian stu-\ndents are not perceived as an \"undeserved minority\"; in fact,\nthey are often seen as \"the model minority,\" suggesting that\nthey are more academically successful and do not face the\nacademic challenges experienced by other racial/ethnic\nminority groups. However, an accruing body of research\nindicates that the \"Asian\" category is not a monolithic group.\nThe academic success of some subethnic groups such as\nChinese, Korean, and Japanese are very different from other\nsubethnic groups such as Cambodian and Laotian, where\nacademic performance is actually lower, drop-out rates are\nhigher, and college completion rates are reduced. The aggre-\ngation within the \"Asian and Pacific Islander\" category ren-\nders these subethnic groups invisible (see Chang, Park, Lin,\nincreasing the sensitivity in assessing subethnic Asian popu-\nlation needs occurred in 2007, where the University of\nCalifornia moved to change its undergraduate application to\nreflect the diversity of its student body by disaggregating the\n\"Asian American and Pacific Islander\" category the follow-\ning year, expanding from its original eight to now 23 catego-\nries. Until all subethnic group data are disaggregated and\nevaluated within the same context, the reporting of diversity\nin the college education system will remain ambiguous.\nThe Definition of the Term \"Diversity\"\nWithin the Literature Remains\nObscure\nThe achievement gap among increasingly diverse student\npopulations and equity concerns are no less profound, nor\nless pressing, for institutions of higher education across the\nnation. However, research and writing in postsecondary edu-\ncation seems not to recognize the need to \"fine-tune\" termi-\nnology and to recharacterize the diverse student populations\nto suitably parse out and further differentiate the \"true diver-\nsity\" of the current and future multiethnic public undergradu-\nate student populations. This is particularly problematic in\nthe continued use of the term underrepresented minority\n(URM), which often translates as the broad categories of\nBlack and Hispanic students when discussing issues of\nrecruitment, funding, and support of students in specific cur-\nricular areas such as the science, technology, engineering,\nand mathematics (STEM) fields in postsecondary\neducation.\nA recent study on the efficacy of developmental pro-\ngrams' (i.e., services for the underprepared college students;\nalso known as remedial, foundational, guided, or transitional\nprogramming) success as measured by student degree com-\npletion in community colleges, noted multiple academic\nachievement gaps and recommended for more sensitive\nassessment, placement, and reformations in pedagogy.\nHowever, the report continued to use broad descriptive terms\nsuch as \"African-American,\" \"Latino,\" and \"White\" to\ndescribe URM student plurality (Center for Community\nCollege Student Engagement [CCCSE], 2016). While the\nreport was scattered with multiple photographs representing\na widely diverse URM student population comprised of\nvarying racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds, none of the\nsuggested recommendations recognized, nor addressed with\na more refined analysis, the diversity represented in those\npictorial representations. Much of the literature on college\nstudent educational outcomes continues to present data in\naggregation. A recent report from the Association of\nAmerican Colleges & Universities (AAC&U), tracking the\npriorities and trends in higher education, shows that while\nmember institutions have adopted changes with priorities\ndirected toward successful advancement for all students, few\ndisaggregate data on student characteristics (e.g., race/eth-\nnicity) to accurately track student achievement of adopted\ninstitutional learning outcomes (Hart Report, 2015). This\nreport indicated that while a majority of institutions (70%)\ntracked the achievement of learning outcomes, only 16% of\nthem disaggregate the data by variables such as race/ethnic-\nity, 9% by income levels, and even less by the undergraduate\nstudent's parent's educational attainment (6%). This latter\nvariable is arguably an important predictor of the undergrad-\nuate student's ability to complete their degree, which remains\noften overlooked.\nMany public educational institutions collect data only\nwith the five Office of Management and Budget (OMB) cat-\negories for their student populations. The OMB aggregates\ndiversity by using a minimum of five categories: White,\nBlack or African American, American Indian or Alaska\nNative,Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.\nInterestingly, when searching for reports and their readouts\nwithin the literature, in many instances, the data are actually\nfurther aggregated rather than disaggregated. The widely\nused category of URM is a case in point, which aggregates\ntogether Black and Hispanic categories making extrapola-\ntions for each individual subethnic group undecipherable.\nThe response to a query about race or ethnicity is a mea-\nsure of \"identity\" and \"self-construction,\" both of which\nMukherji et al. 3\nhave important psychological consequences and further\naffects the many aspects of an individual's cognitive func-\ntioning. These issues are at the heart of ethnic and cross-\ncultural psychology, both burgeoning fields well beyond the\nscope of this article to delineate further. However, one true\nchallenge for current and ongoing research in these respec-\ntive fields must address the issue of \"disaggregation\": break-\ning down large categories like Black, Hispanic, Asian, and so\non, even URM for that matter, into smaller more appropriate\nsubethnic categories such as Central American, South\nAmerican, South Asian, African, and so on. Moreover, if and\nwhen appropriate, these data require further parsing by the\nstudent's parental country of origin. Due to increased subeth-\nnic group variability, the true \"identity\" of each of these sub-\nethnic groups are currently masked within the aggregated\ndata. As previously mentioned, it is impossible to have evi-\ndence-based assessments and targeted interventions in\nSTEM or other fields of education, without access to disag-\ngregated data. Perez and Hirschman (2009) traced changes in\nthe U.S. Census categories of race or ethnicity and the effects\nof that type of data disaggregation on the concept of identity.\nTheir research suggested that the blurring of boundaries\nbetween traditional racial/ethnic categories due to interracial\nmarriages (i.e., the \"multiracial blending\" of America) has\nresulted in the dual effects of both reducing the salience of a\ngiven race and/or ethnicity in American society and \"racial-\nizing\" disadvantaged multiracial blends of subethnic groups.\nTherefore, the educational institutions must be very consci-\nentious, careful, and yet critical of determining the best and\nmost appropriate approaches for disaggregating data without\nracializing these subethnic groups.\nWe argue that disaggregating data in the postsecondary\ncontext, particularly at 2- and 4-year public institutions, would\nreveal important factors contributing to the academic achieve-\nment gap such as parental educational background, and parent\nand student nativity. This information would be of particular\nimportance when discussing potential future predictive ana-\nlytic-based educational interventions addressing the academic\nachievement gap for specific \"minority\" populations. These\ntypes of ethnic background variables appear to have signifi-\ncant effects on retention, academic persistence, and achieve-\nment. Thus, disaggregating diversity data regarding the\nvariables affecting academic performance is paramount for\nassessing the precise needs of specific subethnic populations\nwithin the larger racial/ethnic categories to design effective\nevidence-based programs, which target the exact needs of\nthese distinct populations. To illustrate this timely issue, we\nwill discuss the State University of New York (SUNY), argu-\nably the largest and most diverse public university system in\nthe United States, and SUNY Old Westbury (SUNY-OW), its\nmost diverse campus. The types of disaggregated data argued\nfor in this article are currently not being collected by SUNY,\nnor to our knowledge, at most other postsecondary public col-\nlege institutions nationally. In the absence of this disaggre-\ngated data, given the rapidly increasing diversity within the\nstudent body, we argue that meaningful, evidence-based, and\ntargeted interventions cannot occur. Moreover, given our\nnation's immigrant history, knowing more about student\nparental nativity and country of origin may better inform us\nabout our undergraduate student population than previously\nconsidered, as will be argued below.\nParental Nativity and Country of\nOrigin: A More Sensitive Form of\nDiversity\nImmigration to the United States has been a major catalyst\nfor population growth, as well as its by-product, of increas-\ning the various and diverse changes comprising the racial/\nethnic composition of the U.S. population. During the past\n50 years, immigration accounted for over half of the total\nU.S. population growth, and is projected to account for 88%\nremain. Since 1965, the racial and ethnic composition of the\ncountry has changed dramatically: The Hispanic U.S. popu-\nlation increased from less than 1% to 6%; the non-Hispanic\nWhite population decreased from 85% to 62%, and the Black\npopulation remained relatively the same from 11% to 12%,\nduring the same time period. By 2060, the United States will\nsee an even greater change in the population; Hispanic or\nLatinos are expected to climb to 29% of the U.S. population,\nand Asians to 9.4%. The change is attributable not only to the\npost-1965 surge in immigration but also the aging of the\nWhite native population in the United States (U.S. Census\nBureau, 2012). It is projected that immigration patterns will\ncontinue to change the racial/ethnic group composition of\nthe country in the future (Pew Research Center, 2015) and as\nsuch require the field to move in the direction of data\ndisaggregation.\nThe specific changes in the larger racial/ethnic groups are\ndue, in large part to a surge in diversity of sending countries.\nalmost 16% of the U.S. population will have been born out-\nside the United States, according to projections made by the\nU.S. Census Bureau (2014). The upswing in immigration is\nlargely a direct result of the Hart Celler Act passed in 1965,\nwhich dramatically changed the number and composition of\nimmigrants entering the United States. In 1960, prior to the\nHart Celler Act, 84% of immigrants were of European ori-\nMexicans (28%) accounted for the largest share of immi-\ngrant groups in the United States, followed by Asians\nAmerican countries as their country of origin (Pew Research\nWhile these numbers are dramatic and shifting, they\nobfuscate an important point, which is the diversity within\n4 SAGE Open\nlarger multiethnic and racial groups. In 1980, the push for\nofficial Census (OMB) panethnic group classifications came\nin large part from Latino groups calling for remediation of\nundercounting (i.e., the effect of which is to lower federal aid\ndependent on population size; Anderson, 2015b). Today,\nhowever, the placement of new immigrant's groups into\nlarge panethnic or racial categories masks and further dilutes\nthe diversity within multiethnic groups (Itzigsohn, 2004;\nOkamoto, 2003). For example, while Mexicans (and their\nchildren) make up the majority of Latinos in the United\nStates today, Mexican immigrants are relative newcomers to\nNew York and joined existing Latino groups such as\nAsians are an even more multiethnic group, spanning diverse\nreligions, languages, cultures, and vast geographic regions\n(Okamoto & Mora, 2014). Black immigrants are often\ngrouped with African Americans, but their immigration his-\ntory and their cultural backgrounds vary significantly from\nthat of African Americans, as do their experiences with sys-\ntemic racism (Kasinitz, Mollenkopf, & Waters, 2002;\nKasinitz, Mollenkopf, Waters, & Holdaway, 2008; Lieberson\n& Waters, 1988). As a result of this classification scheme,\nwhich was introduced by the U.S. Census and adopted by the\nmajority of governmental and nongovernmental institutions,\nwe lose the ability to understand important markers of dis-\ntinction that are specific to country of origin, including, but\nnot limited to, gender roles, educational values, religious\naffiliation, family and marriage arrangements, as well as\nvarying levels of social, cultural, and human capital that\ndiverge across regions.\nIn New York State, for example, unlike the majority of the\nUnited States, Puerto Ricans are the largest Latino subethnic\ngroup, followed by Dominicans and Mexicans (Krogstad &\nLopez, 2014). Due to the unique ties that Puerto Rico has\nwith the mainland United States, the lived Latino experience\nof Puerto Ricans varies greatly from that of Mexicans. Puerto\nRicans have legal status, are more likely to speak English,\nand have access to social services and embedded networks.\nMexicans, who recently arrived to New York, are less likely\nto speak English, have fewer financial assets and less access\nto government resources (Bergad & Klein, 2010). Mexicans,\nwhile fewer in number than Puerto Ricans, are the fastest\ngrowing Latino immigrant group in the New York area. As a\nwhole, foreign-born Mexicans have some of the lowest edu-\ncational attainment rates among Latinos in the New York\narea (Bergad, 2013). This suggests a likely correlation\nbetween low educational attainment rates of young Mexican\nimmigrants and a combination of factors specific to mem-\nbers of this group's national origin such as the lack of paren-\ntal and peer support and low human capital levels. The rise in\nMexican migration to the New York area and the particular\nchallenges members of this subethnic group face further\nunderscore the need for data disaggregation among public\ncolleges and universities that will likely see an increase of\nmembers from this subethnic group in the coming years.\nA number of factors negatively affect educational attain-\nment in subethnic student populations such as college readi-\nness and retention among immigrant students, many of which\nare country of origin specific. Larger racial and ethnic cate-\ngories such as Latino or Asian obscure premigration struc-\ntural barriers to education such as country of origin political\ninstability or economic development. Overall, immigrants\nfrom more politically stable countries outperform their\nimmigrant peers who hail from destinations with a history of\npolitical upheaval (Dronkers & de Heus, 2012). Similarly,\ngross domestic product (GDP) levels have been positively\ncorrelated with academic success among immigrants (Levels,\nDronkers, & Kraaykamp, 2008). The term Latino encom-\npasses not only U.S.-born students of Latino heritage but\nalso immigrants from more than 33 countries. Yet within\nLatin America, national economic development varies\nwidely from the Southern Cone to the Caribbean. Grouping\nall immigrants from Latin America into one large panethnic\n\"Latino\" category limits our understanding of premigration,\ncountry-specific human capital. This results in a \"one size\nfits all\" approach to pedagogical curriculum and programs,\nwhere we argue a tailored approach is much more likely to\nensure success for a larger number of immigrant undergradu-\nate college students.\nWhile social scientists have long pointed to cultural capi-\ntal as a significant variable in educational attainment and\nindicates the importance of understanding how country-\nspecific cultural capital works as a meditating factor in\nimmigrant educational attainment. Prior research suggests\nthat cultural factors specific to styles of learning, as well as\nfamilial and communal social pressure to excel, largely\naccount for the educational success of many Chinese and\nKorean immigrants (Zhou & Kim, 2006). However, when all\nAsian subethnic groups are lumped into one larger category,\nthe success of Chinese and Korean immigrants conceals the\nexperiences of other less-advantaged Asian subethnic groups\nin the United States, such as immigrants from Cambodia,\nLaos, or Vietnam. Members of these groups are more likely\nto have arrived to the United States as refugees (or are chil-\ndren of refugees) with fewer socioeconomic resources and\ncultural capital which results in reduced ability to excel\nwithin the U.S. educational system (Ngo & Lee, 2007).\nIntersectionality is a term first introduced by Kimberl\u00e9\ntity should be understood multidimensionally (i.e., the over-\nlap of institutionalized power structures in society operate to\ncreate a \"whole\" which is larger than its constituent or com-\nponent parts). For example, one cannot fully understand the\nexperience of a Black woman without understanding that the\nforces of discrimination, which operate at the level of race or\ngender independently, intersect to create a systemic structure\nof oppression or domination, which is greater than their sim-\nple additive components. The term intersectionality is used\nin this article to emphasize that not including factors such as\nMukherji et al. 5\nparental education, nativity, immigration status, and immi-\ngrant generation and using only the lens of the standard eth-\nnic categories, fails to capture the true multidimensionality\nof the undergraduate student population and does not veridi-\ncally reflect students' experiences within the current educa-\ntional system.\nThe intersectionality of premigration structural factors, as\nwell as, pre- and postmigration cultural and social capital\ndirectly affect immigrants' educational achievement. A\nnuanced and targeted approach to elucidate how different\nsubethnic groups are affected by the intersectionality of these\nvariables in today's diverse world is inevitable and abso-\nlutely necessary to ensure the appropriate integration, college\nreadiness and retention, and educational success of U.S.\nimmigrant undergraduate students.\nParental Education and First-\nGeneration College (FGC) Students:\nMore Diverse Than Previously\nConsidered\nFGC students are typically defined as students whose parents\nnever attended college. A National Center for Educational\nStatistics (NCES; 2010) study found that even when control-\nling for variables such as prior high school academic prepa-\nration, demographic background, postsecondary credit\nproduction or performance, FGC students were less likely to\nearn a bachelor's degree as compared with students whose\nparents had college education. They complete fewer under-\ngraduate college credits, earn lower grades, need more reme-\ndial assistance, and are more likely to withdraw prior to\ncompleting their degrees. As compared with students whose\nparents obtained college degrees, FGC students were twice\nas likely to leave college without earning a degree, 43% ver-\nsus 20%, respectively. FGC students, even among those who\nenter college expecting to earn a bachelor's degree attending\n4-year institutions, are more likely to leave (29%) as com-\npared with those with college-educated parents (13%), and\nthey are less likely to earn a degree (47%) than those with\nparents holding a college degree (78%). Only 26% of FGC\nstudents who enroll in undergraduate colleges complete\ndegrees (i.e., after 8 years), as compared with those whose\nStudents who are non-White and/or from low-income\nfamilies are disproportionately represented in the FGC\ngroup. FGC students experience complex familial, cultural,\nsocial, and economic pressures related to being the first in\ntheir families to go to college, and these pressures have unde-\nniable psychological consequences. Research indicates that\nFGC students, as compared with their non\u00adfirst-generation\ncounterparts, are both academically and psychologically\nunderprepared for college. They lack knowledge of the \"ori-\nenting\" information pertaining to college: how to access\ninformation about financial assistance and other forms of\nsupport before they get into college, and then upon arrival,\nthey have additional difficulty acclimating themselves to the\nroutines and expectations of \"college student life\"; they tend\nto delay entering postsecondary institutions, often for finan-\ncial reasons, and many continue to work full-time, even after\nenrollment, which further delays the time to degree comple-\ntion (for more detailed analyses, see Tym, McMillion,\nOther research indicates that FGC students are less likely to\nreceive support from their family (and community) to attend\n2- and 4-year public colleges. Families of FGC students may\noften discourage them from going to college, sometimes for\nfinancial reasons, which leads to a sense of alienation from\ntheir family support structures. In addition, this may raise FGC\nstudent doubts about being \"college material\" and generalize\nover to self-question whether or not they will succeed in col-\nlege. This leads to a sense of disorientation, isolation, and an\nless able to connect their current academic performance with\ntheir expectations for the future, especially if they have no prior\nfamily role model or reference model. For FGC students, there\nis also a sense of cultural dislocation and/or disconnect with the\nU.S. college experience (for a discussion of cultural capital\ndeficit,seeStephens,Fryberg,Markus,Johnson,&Covarrubias,\n2012). Students whose parents have gone to college are typi-\ncally brought up to see college as a \"continuation\" of their aca-\ndemic and social experience. For FGC students, going to\ncollege may often be seen as a break from communal or social\nroles, norms, and expectations from their cultural background\n(Engle, Bermeo, & O'Brien, 2006). These FGC student\n\u00adspecific needs provide ample evidence that early intervention,\nas well as social and psychological support programs, are effec-\ntive in promoting their readiness and retention in college\nincreasing their success toward degree completion.\nThere is one important caveat that needs to be made here:\nthe FGC versus non-FGC student may be an over-simplifica-\ntion, and there is still considerable ambiguity in the defini-\ntion of the term first generation. For example, is an FGC\nstudent defined as having parents without a college degree?\nAlternatively, is an FGC student defined as having at least\none parent with a college degree? What if one or both parents\nattended college, but did not complete or graduate with a\ndegree? Thus, there is considerable variability (and ambigu-\nity) in the current literature as FGC is currently used. Thus,\nthe term FGC moving forward requires operational defini-\ntion refinement and over generalization of its current inter-\npretation is cautionary.\nStudent Nativity: Generation as\nAnother Important Form of Diversity\nHowever, while there is a positive association between\nparental achievement and the academic success of the diverse\n6 SAGE Open\ncollege student, as pointed out above, there is an intersec-\ntionality of the racial/ethnic category, academic achievement\nof the parent, the immigrant generation of the person (i.e.,\nwhether they are the first generation of their family to be\nborn in the United States) and parental country of origin, that\nneeds to be examined as well. The flow of immigrants into\nthe country in recent decades has divided the group of \"new\ncomers or nontraditional students\" to the country into two\ndistinctively different groups, with strikingly dissimilar\ncharacteristics. As the flows of immigrants from diverse\nregions and countries of origin are so unique, the links\nbetween immigrant status and postsecondary success are\nvery complex and highly dependent on the country of origin\nof the parents. Moreover, this evidences that aggregating\ndata from such populations is inappropriate.\nBaum and Flores (2011) discussed the children of more\nrecent immigrants in the context of postsecondary education.\nSimilar to the situation for native-born youth from low-\nincome backgrounds and whose parents do not have college\nexperience, children of immigrant backgrounds face many of\nthe same barriers to enrollment and success in college.\nHowever, there is wide variation in the patterns of educa-\ntional outcomes, which are related to the immigrant genera-\ntion of the child (i.e., student) and the country of origin of\ntheir immigrant parent. To summarize the detailed analysis\nof Baum and Flores (2011), they point out that on \"average,\"\nthe children from immigrant families were just as likely as\nnative-born children to have a parent (i.e., father) with a col-\nlege education. This \"average\" finding, however, obscures\nthe fact that foreign-born fathers from regions such as India,\nPakistan, Bangladesh, Africa, Iran, and Korea were nearly 8\ntimes more likely to have a college degree as compared with\nthose fathers who were born in Laos, Cambodia, or the\nCaribbean and Mexico. As discussed earlier, parental educa-\ntion has an important academic influential effect on the suc-\ncessful outcomes for the child and should be included in data\ndisaggregation.\nBaum and Flores (2011) additionally summarized a body\nof data and pointed out that first-generation immigrant (FGI)\nstatus also has a significant effect on college enrollment and\nattrition. FGI children are defined as foreign-born children of\nimmigrants and second-generation immigrants as U.S.-born\nchildren of immigrants. Research indicates that FGI students\nhave higher likelihoods of enrolling in college than native-\nborn children. They also point to significant differences in\neducational attainment differences between immigrants from\ndifferent regions of nativity. Black immigrants are less likely\nthan native-born Blacks, to possess some characteristics that\nmay impede their educational success: They are more likely\nto be from two-parent families and/or attend better schools\n(Baum & Flores, 2011). Other research indicates that immi-\ngrants are also more likely to come from racially and socio-\neconomically heterogeneous neighborhoods (Jargowski &\nrelated to attitudes toward education, cultural identity, and\ntraditions regarding the primacy of education, all of which\nincrease the probability of success for their children, and\nthese vary markedly with the countries of origin of parents of\nimmigrant children.\nIn an analysis of immigrants and their children, Rumbaut\nDifferences in nativity (of self and parents) and in age and life\nstage at arrival, which are criteria used to distinguish between\ngenerational cohorts, are known to affect significantly the modes\nof acculturation of adults and children in immigrant families,\nespecially with regard to language and accent, educational\nattainment and patterns of social mobility, outlooks and frames\nof reference, ethnic identity and even their propensity to sustain\ntransnational attachments over time. (p. 1164)\nIn summary, the body of research points to a wide variety\nof factors influencing educational outcomes within the three\nmain broad categories of Black, Hispanic, and Asian. This\nbody of research supports the need to identify a more granu-\nlar data set about students entering postsecondary educa-\ntional institutions: parental academic achievement (i.e.,\nwhether the student is FGC), immigrant generation of the\nstudent (i.e., whether they are native-born or foreign-born\n[FGI]), and countries of origin of their parents.\nRedefining College Student Diversity:\nIn September 2015, SUNY, which is arguably the largest and\nmost diverse public institution of higher education, released\na Diversity Brief (SUNY, 2015), stating,\nDespite the evidenced-based definition and application of\ndiversity promulgated today, in practice, institutions across the\ncountry, including those within SUNY, continue to struggle to\nfully meet diversity goals and/or to take steps necessary to\nprepare for projected demographic shifts . . . (p. 1)\nThe Diversity Brief (which defines URM with the tradi-\ntional categories of Black and Hispanic) goes on to acknowl-\nedge that while SUNY has made gains in the recruitment of\nlast decade, there remains a significant gap between the\nretention and graduation rates of these URMs when com-\npared with their White and Asian counterparts. Pell grant\nfunding is a measure of student financial need, and 56% of\nSUNY URM students are Pell grant recipients. Despite these\nsupport systems, URM students and Pell grant recipients\nhave the lowest retention and graduation rates among SUNY\nstudents. Low graduation and retention rates for URMs are\nproblematic not only for SUNY but is an issue of national\nconcern.

In addition,\nSUNY is in the process of including a question about paren-\ntal academic achievement in their new SUNY-wide Common\nApplication form. The SUNY application form does solicit\ninformation about Hispanic/Latino identification, and in a\nfollowing question asks about \"background\" country (i.e.,\nprovides the following choices: Central America, Cuban,\nDominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South American, and\nother Hispanic/Latino).\nGiven the aforementioned discussion about the sources of\nthe population growth with respect to specific countries of ori-\ngin, this information can be used to provide targeted interven-\ntions to subethnic groups comprising the nontraditional college\nstudent population. However, in contrast to the SUNY catego-\nries for Hispanic/Latino identification, there is only one cate-\ngorical response for Black or African American. We believe\nthat despite the intent of this data collection tool, some impor-\ntant information is \"lost in the data.\" A recent Pew report\n(Anderson, 2015a) points to the fact that Black immigrant\npopulations have more than quadrupled since 1980. Jamaica\nand Haiti are the two largest countries of origin from which\nBlack immigrant populations have come to the United States,\nand account for 18% and 15% of the Black immigrant popula-\ntion, respectively. Moreover, immigrants from Africa have\nconstitute 36% of the foreign-born Black population.\nThis information about country of origin (i.e., nativity of\nstudent or parent) is important to consider as the data indi-\ncate that when compared with immigrants overall, foreign-\nborn Blacks speak English at a higher rate; immigrants from\nAfrica have higher levels of educational attainment (i.e., a\ncollege degree) than Americans overall (30%). However,\nBlack immigrants from Central and South America, as well\nas the Caribbean, have significantly lower rates of educa-\nReport goes on to point out that in the New York metropoli-\ntan area, which is an important catchment area for SUNY,\nforeign-born Blacks make up 28% of the Black population.\nWe are therefore arguing that the single response category\nfor Blacks, which conflates race with country of origin,\nmasks important information, which would be directly\nrelated to students' academic performance and success.\nIn addition, a more recent report (Lopez & Gonzalez-\nBarrera, 2016) points out, as we have earlier, that for U.S.\nHispanics, self-identity is a complex issue. Among Latinos\nwith Caribbean roots, according to the Pew Report, nearly a\nquarter (24%) identify as Afro-Latino, Afro-Caribbean, or\nAfro-(i.e., country of origin). There is no category, currently\nin the SUNY application for these students to respond to that\nmatches their self-identification. This form of subethnic\ngroup data disaggregation is critically important as the Pew\nReport suggests that people identifying as Afro-Latino are\nless likely to have a college education (24% as compared\nwith 37% of Latinos overall) and also have lower incomes\noverall as compared with other Latinos.\nWe argue that adding response categories related to the\nimmigrant generation of the student, as well as parental and\nstudent countries of nativity, with a more detailed desegrega-\ntion of racial/ethnic identification would be very useful\ninformation to parse the differences in the student popula-\ntion. These parameters can and should be used in predictive\nanalytics in college education, which could then lead to sen-\nsitive needs assessment, targeted interventions and\napproaches to pedagogy in the classroom, and in other forms\nof support structure. Early identification of these factors will\nallow for development of fine-tuned interventions that can\nbe directed toward the appropriate student ethnic populations\nfor optimizing outcomes.\nStudent Diversity at SUNY-OW:\nA Truly Representative Sample\nPopulation\nSUNY-OW is one of 14 comprehensive public liberal arts\nundergraduate colleges in all of SUNY. It is the most student\ndiverse campus of the entire SUNY system, with 64% stu-\ndent diversity (URM, Asian, and International student body)\nas compared with the entire SUNY system-wide aggregate\nstudent diversity of 34.2%. SUNY-OW has the highest per-\ncentage of URM student enrollment (53.3%), more than\ndouble the SUNY-wide URM student enrollment of 23.2%\nHowever, SUNY-OW currently does not institutionally col-\nlect data that would disaggregate the subpopulations within\nthe categories of Black, Hispanic, or Asian, or information\nabout their immigrant generation of its students, or countries\nof nativity of students or their parents. Anecdotally, we are\nconscious of the wide subethnic group diversity that exists in\nthe backgrounds of our students. In an informal study con-\nducted by the authors during Fall 2015, a small sample of\nstudents (n = 271) enrolled within psychology classes were\nasked to indicate whether or not they were born in the United\nStates, and if not, where they were born. They were asked\nabout their parental nativity (i.e., where their parents had\nbeen born) and if foreign-born, their country of origin and\nthe number of years each parent had been in the United\nStates. The results of this informal survey revealed that the\n8 SAGE Open\nmajority of the sample (75%) had one or more parents born\nin a country other than the United States. In addition, one in\nfour of the sample of students had been born in a country\nother than the United States (see attached survey).\nThere is an important issue to raise in this context: while\nself-identification by the dimensions of race/ethnicity or\nnativity is done by most people fairly routinely, \"FGI\" or\n\"first generation to college\" is not a label that students read-\nily apply to themselves. Anecdotally, the authors of this arti-\ncle have found this to be true of our first-generation students\nat SUNY-OW. To the extent that students may not consis-\ntently self-identify as FGC/FGI, they do not perceive the dif-\nficulties they may experience in their adjustment to the\ndemands of an academic environment to their FGC/FGI sta-\ntus. Furthermore, as they do not attribute their difficulties to\nsuch causes, they do not seek out available services nor are\nthey able to reach out to other FGC/FGI students, who share\nthose same background factors as they, to lessen their sense\nof isolation. Based on this insight, we at SUNY-OW have for\nthe past year been engaged in a series of efforts to raise\nawareness of those factors shared by FGC/FGI students that\npresent barriers to success among our student body and the\nwider college community. Last March, we held our inaugural\nFirst Generation Student Conference with faculty, students,\nadministration, and staff. In addition to external speakers\nwho presented information about best practices for support\nand intervention with FGC students, there also was opportu-\nnity for institutional self-reflection and identification of\nexisting support structures and resources yet to be identified.\nOne of the most powerful outcomes from the conference was\nthe verification of the sense of isolation felt by FGC/FGI stu-\ndents, of which we had had anecdotal evidence. SUNY-OW\nhas instituted an awareness campaign which includes estab-\nlishing a webpage on the college website with information\nabout available resources specifically for FGC/FGI students,\na regular series of conversations with FGC/FGI students and\nfaculty who are themselves FGIs and of whom many are first\ngeneration to college in their families. SUNY-OW has a\nFreshman Year Experience (FYE) program dedicated to\nintroducing students to the social justice mission of the col-\nlege. In the first semester, all freshmen (less than 24 college\ncredits) enroll in a seminar, The Ethics of Engagement:\nEducating Leaders for a Just World. In their second semes-\nter, all first-year students must participate in a community\naction, learning and leadership program that is a course\nembedded community-based learning program. Last year,\nFYE staff and administrators conducted surveys with our\nfreshmen cohort for early identification of FGC/FGI stu-\ndents. This year, the authors of this article are collaborating\nwith the FYE administrators and staff, and have begun a for-\nmal study consisting of online surveys, structured interviews,\nand focus groups to collect data on nativity, countries of ori-\ngin, parental educational background, and generational sta-\ntus to disaggregate the data in a more meaningful way.\nThrough such an approach, we aim to disaggregate subethnic\ngroup data to develop appropriate predictive analytics for\ncollege students. We know these factors play a significant\nrole in our students' academic achievement, persistence, and\nmotivations for degree completion and aspirations beyond a\ncollege degree. Thus, fine-grained analyses on the associa-\ntions of our students' background demographic factors with\nother parameters related to academic performance and reten-\ntion will enable us to develop targeted interventional pro-\ngrams for our diverse undergraduate students.\nConclusion and Future Considerations\non College Student Diversity Needs\nIn summary, it is of critical importance to truly operational-\nize the term diversity in the context of today's multicultural\nundergraduate student population as it relates to their aca-\ndemic achievement. At SUNY-OW, we are honored to con-\ntribute to this special edition on student diversity for SAGE\nat a time when our school is celebrating its 50th Anniversary\nas one of the most diverse public 4-year undergraduate col-\nleges with a socially conscious curriculum (i.e., Ethics of\nEngagement: Educating Leaders for a Just World) within the\ncountry (Anker & Feder-Marcus, 2013). We want to promote\nan increasing national dialogue on social consciousness and\nfurther to disaggregate data on diversity. We are currently\ndoing so within our college, in the hopes of becoming a pio-\nneering example within our increasingly diverse nation. It is\nour opinion that disaggregating URM data will increase the\nsocial sensitivity in identifying factors that will close the aca-\ndemic achievement gap and promote educational equality for\nall the diverse groups, which create our great nation. The\nneed to move away from the OMB categorization of \"diver-\nsity\" is timely, as the number of diverse URM students is\nrapidly increasing and major governmental programs such as\nthose in the STEM fields critically rely on this information.\nSimilarly, the new \"terms/descriptors\" which would evolve\nfrom the disaggregated data should be monitored and updated\nto reflect changing diversity predicted over the next 10 to 20\nyears, to really serve the needs of our nation's increasingly\ndiverse college student body. Perhaps Lechat (2001) had said\nit best . . .\nequity concerns arising from the enormous diversity that\nstudents represent--in culture, language, prior educational\nexperiences, home situations, learning styles, attitudes toward\nlearning, and future aspirations. This diversity requires a level of\nindividualization that traditional education has never been\ndesigned nor equipped to provide. The twin mandates of equity\nand accountability have made it imperative that educators base\ndecisions on accurate and meaningful data about student\nlearning and achievement.
