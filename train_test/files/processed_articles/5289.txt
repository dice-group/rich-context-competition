In addition, according to Teresa and\nCartoon,5 the incidence of shivering during\ncesarean section is as high as 57%. Patient-\ncontrolled intravenous analgesia is com-\nmonly used after cesarean section. As most\nanalgesic drugs are opioids, however, they\noften trigger nausea, vomiting, and other\nadverse puerperal reactions after cesarean\nsection.\nCurrently, ondansetron is widely used\nduring cesarean section, and numerous related\nhigh-quality studies have been published. To\ndate, however, there has been no meta-\nanalysis of ondansetron used during cesarean\nsection under spinal anesthesia. We therefore\nconducted a meta-analysis to investigate the\nefficacy and safety of ondansetron during\ncesarean section under spinal anesthesia.\nMaterials and methods\nInclusion criteria\n.

The two groups,\nFigure 3. Studies reporting the incidence of (a) hypotension, (b) shivering, and (c) bradycardia with\nondansetron administration.\nhowever, differed little in their incidences of\npruritus, hypotension, or shivering.\nOndansetron is a potent, highly select-\nive serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonist. It\ncan prevent the combination of 5-HT\nreleased by activated platelets with 5-HT3\nreceptors in the vagal nerve endings of the\nleft ventricle, attenuate Bezold\u00adJarisch\nreflexes produced by left ventricular mech-\nanoreceptors stimulated by 5-HT, inhibit\nfurther expansion of peripheral blood ves-\nsels, and increase venous return, thereby\nreducing the incidence of hypotension.27,28\nOwczuk et al.29 observed that intraven-\nously injecting 8 mg ondansetron 5 min\nbefore spinal anesthesia can curb the reduc-\ntion of systolic blood pressure without affect-\ning the diastolic blood pressure or heart rate.\nSahoo et al.14 reported that intravenous\ninjection of 8 mg ondansetron 5 min before\nspinal anesthesia can significantly reduce the\nincidences of hypotension, nausea, and\nvomiting in puerperae undergoing spinal\nanesthesia and reduce the use of\nvasoconstrictor drugs. Ondansetron is struc-\nturally similar to 5-HT3 and has a high\nselectivity of dense region in the 5-HT3\nreceptor. It can block vomiting reflexes\ncaused by the 5-HT3 receptor-induced vagal\nstimulation and inhibit 5-HT release in the\nfourth ventricle caused by vagal excitement,\neffectively controlling vomiting. Several stu-\ndies have demonstrated that ondansetron can\nsignificantly reduce the incidence of post-\noperative nausea/vomiting.30\nGiving ondansetron to prevent pruritus\nand shivering is still debatable. A possible\nmechanism for initiating pruritus is opioid\nspread via cerebrospinal fluid to the head,\nwhere it acts on the medulla oblongata and\nspinal L receptors or 5- HT3 receptors.\nOndansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor\nantagonist, is commonly used to prevent or\ntreat nausea/vomiting after surgery and\nchemotherapy. Several clinical studies have\nconfirmed8,31 that it can effectively control\npruritus due to intrathecal injection of mor-\nphine. In the present study, ondansetron did\nFigure 4. Studies reporting nausea and vomiting with ondansetron administration.\nnot effectively prevent skin pruritus caused\nby intrathecal injection of sufentanil, pos-\nsibly because the ondansetron had not yet\nreached the location to make the difference.\nIn addition to medulla oblongata and\n5-HT3 receptors, opioids have many other\nways to produce pruritus. Ondansetron can\neffectively prevent morphine- or fentanyl-\ninduced skin pruritus. Yazigi et al.32\nbelieved that ondansetron's antagonism\ncannot be used effectively as sufentanil has\nhigher fat solubility than the former two\ndrugs, thus acting on the medulla oblongata\nand spinal cord more rapidly.\nShivering is a common complication of\nanesthesia. Currently, the mechanism of\npostoperative shivering is not entirely clear.\nIt may relate to dysfunctional temperature\nregulation, or it may be associated with\nthe recovery sequence of the nerve center\nafter anesthesia. One study showed that\n5-HT secreted by the hypothalamus plays\nan important role in thermoregulation.33 In\nanimal models, intravenous injection of\n5-HT into mice can induce hemangiectasis,\ncausing shivering,34 suggesting that the\n5-HT system plays an important role in\ncontrolling postoperative shivering. Studies\nhave shown that 5-HT3 antagonists play a\npart in preventing postoperative shivering,\nand its mechanism may be associated with\ninhibition of 5-HT in the preoptic anterior\nThe adverse reactions of ondansetron\noften present as neurological symptoms\n(e.g., headache, dizziness) or digestive symp-\ntoms (e.g., abdominal discomfort, abnor-\nmally elevated alanine aminotransferase),\nbut the overall incidences are relatively low.\nThere are some limitations of this sys-\ntematic review. (1) The included studies\ndiffer in regard to the patient's position,\nthe anesthesia puncture points, measure-\nment indicators, and use of drugs--each of\nwhich could affect the conclusions of this\nstudy. (2) The heterogeneity of the included\nstudies is distinct, which may influence the\nreliability of the meta-analysis. (3) RCTs\nincluded in some subgroup analyses were\nnot enough. (4) Some RCTs did not give\nenough information to judge the scientific\nrationality of the trial, and there was a\npossibility of implementation biases and\nmeasurement biases. Meanwhile, as we\nonly covered the published literature, the\nsearch strategy and publication bias could\nalso affect the results of this study.\nIn summary, ondansetron can effectively\nreduce the incidences of nausea, vomiting,\nand bradycardia during spinal anesthesia for\ncesarean section, and its safety is relatively\ngood. Because of the small sample size of\nthis study, this conclusion remains to be\nconfirmed by studies with a larger sample\nsize and multi-center studies.\n"
