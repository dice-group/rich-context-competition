A self-administered\nquestionnaire purposely designed for the present study was presented to a quota sample of 400 women employed in\nMalta. Statistical analyses revealed that (a) the most important work motivators are \"financial independence\" and \"earning\nmoney for basic necessities\"; (b) the 16 proposed work motivations could be grouped under two internally consistent and\nunidimensional factors, namely, \"personal and professional development\" and \"social and economic well-being\"; and (c)\nthat the intention to continue to work in the future was associated with a higher level of \"education,\" and greater levels of\nwork motivation related to \"personal and professional development\" and \"social and economic well-being.\" The findings are\ndiscussed and the study provides 10 important recommendations for Maltese labor market policy makers and employers\naimed at boosting the participation of working women. These include a more supportive support system for working\nmothers, flexible educational and training opportunities, and tighter enforcement of laws to prevent gender discrimination\nand harassment at the place of work and nonobserved economic activity. The study concludes by providing some interesting\navenues for further research.\n",

The strategic goal for the\nfirst decade was to create a positive strategy that combines\ncompetitiveness and social cohesion, so that the EU becomes\n\"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based econ-\nomy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth\nwith more and better jobs and greater social cohesion\"\n(European Trade Union Confederation, 2006). To meet these\ngoals, the targets set by the EU included an overall employ-\nover 60%, an employment of 50% among older workers, and\nan annual economic growth of 3%.\nThis empirical study, which is based in the Republic of\nMalta, seeks to gain a better understanding and assessment\nof the work motivations of Maltese female workers.

The Maltese economy is\nhighly dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing, tourism,\nTo respond to the targets set by the EU, the Maltese gov-\nernment launched a series of initiatives and programs in an\nattempt to boost women's participation in the Maltese labor\nmarket. These include fiscal incentives concerning National\nInsurance and tax rates, extended maternity leave, the shar-\ning work\u00adlife responsibilities program, and the setting up of\nthe National Commission for the Promotion of Equality\n(NCPE) to screen the labor market and make sure that gender\nequality regulations are adhered to.

The gender imbalance becomes even more disturbing\nwhen one looks at the percentage of women on corporate\nboards of large listed companies, with Malta standing at the\nbottom of the league across all EU member states with 3%.\n(European Commission, 2012a). This suggests that Malta\nneeds to strive to implement new and more effective policies\nin an attempt to reach EU's 2020 objective set by the Europe\n2020 strategy--that of increasing the number of women (and\nTo increase the female employment rate, apart from\nattracting the unemployed and the inactive to the labor mar-\nket, it is also important to retain those who are already\nengaged. This empirical study seeks to gain a better under-\nstanding of those factors that motivate Maltese women to\nengage in the labor market and to recognize the difficulties\nthat Maltese employed women have to face to work. In the\nlight of the findings that emerge, the study will set out to\ngenerate recommendations aimed at better guiding policy\nmakers when devising strategies to boost the participation\nrates of women in the Maltese labor market. The study con-\ncludes by providing some interesting avenues for further\nresearch.\nLiterature Review\nTheories of Work Motivation\nWork motivation has been defined as \"a set of energetic\nforces that originate both within as well as beyond an indi-\nvidual's being, to initiate work-related behavior, and to deter-\nmine its form, direction, intensity, and duration\" (Pinder,\nemerged and here we review four broad categories--the\nneeds-based, cognitive process, behavioral and job-based\ntheories. These will be described briefly due to space limita-\ntions and because comprehensive reviews of work motivation\ntheories are overwhelmingly available (e.g., Grant & Shin,\nNeeds. The needs-based theories posit that employees have a\ndrive to satisfy a variety of needs through their work. Accord-\ning to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1943), employees strive\nto satisfy physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem and\nself-actualization needs that are hierarchically ranked, and\nonce a lower need is satisfied, it no longer serves as a motiva-\ntor. In the ERG Theory, Alderfer (1969) grouped Maslow's\nfive basic human needs into three--existence (E), relatedness\n(R), and growth (G) --which however do not necessarily\nneed to be satisfied in hierarchical order. The Need for\nAchievement Theory (McClelland, 1961) focuses on indi-\nviduals who strive to achieve their goals and advance in their\norganization and identifies three main categories of achieve-\nment motivation--affiliation, authority, and achievement.\nBehavioral. Behavioral theories focus on observable behavior\nnot on psychological processes. The Organizational Behav-\nior Motivation Theory, also known as The Reinforcement\nTheory, was developed by B. F. Skinner in 1938. He extended\nIvan Petrovic Pavlov's classical conditioning (stimulus lead-\ning to response) by identifying two types of behavior--the\nrespondent (classical conditioning mechanism, with limited\napplications and use) and the operant (response leading to\nstimulus, and hence behavior is actually learnt). This theory\nsuggests that an individual will behave in a manner that helps\nhim or her to avoid potential negative outcomes and achieve\nagreeable outcomes. Thus, proper management of reinforce-\nment helps chance the direction, level, and persistence of an\nindividual behavior, and hence, to motivate employees, orga-\nnizations need to indulge in systematic reinforcement of\ndesirable work behavior.\nCognitive process.Cognitive process theories postulate that\npeople set goals and strategize ways to attain them on the\nbasis of needs, values, and the situational context. According\nstrike a balance between the ratio of inputs to outcomes in\nexchange relationships. It describes how and why employees\nreact when treated unfairly (e.g., through withdrawal or vio-\nlence on others). Vroom's Expectancy Theory (1964) pro-\nposes that employees choose to invest in courses of action\nafter weighing their relative utilities; hence, employees work\nharder if their efforts lead to valued rewards. The Goal Set-\nting Theory, presented by Locke and Latham (1990), which\nis considered to be the \"single, most dominant theory in the\ngoals to motivate, they must have clarity (i.e., be specific,\nmeasurable and time-bound), be challenging but realistic,\nrequire commitment (the harder the goal, the greater the\ncommitment required), provide feedback opportunities (to\nclarify expectations, adjust goal difficulty, and gain recogni-\ntion) and have attainable task complexity. Bandura's Social\nan interaction of personal psychological processes, behavior,\nand the environment. People learn by observing others, and\nBandura established that the following four steps are neces-\nsary in the modeling process: attention (to something new),\nretention (remember what you paid attention to), reproduc-\ntion (translate description into actual behavior), and motiva-\ntion (the \"will\" to imitate the model). According to this\ntheory, employees with high self-esteem anticipate success\nand show more effort and persistence, require feedback and\nadopt more effective task strategies (patterns of behavior\nBezzina et al. 3\nproduced to reach a particular goal) than others. It has been\nacknowledged that the social cognitive theory is helpful in\nunderstanding, predicting, modifying, or changing individ-\nual and group behavior (Jones, 1989). The Self-Determina-\ntion Theory, which comprises five mini theories (see\nVansteenkiste, Niemiec, & Soenens, 2010), posits that when\nthe three basic psychological needs of employees--namely,\nautonomy (choice and discretion), competence (capability\nand efficacy perceptions), and relatedness (feelings of con-\nnectedness and belongingness with others)--are satisfied,\nemployees tend to be more intrinsically motivated and inter-\nnalize external goals and objectives (Deci & Ryan, 2000).\nMore recent research suggests that intrinsic and extrinsic\nmotivations often coexist (Adler & Chen, 2011). In addition,\nwhen intrinsic and prosocial motivations interact, employees\nshow higher levels of persistence, performance, and creativ-\nJob-based. According to job-based theories, the key to find-\ning motivation through one's job is to derive satisfaction\nfrom the job content. Herzberg's Motivator-Hygiene Theory\n(1959) posits that high levels of hygiene factors such as pay,\nstatus, working conditions, and job security do not create sat-\nisfaction but can only reduce dissatisfaction. The motivating\nfactors that create satisfaction include recognition, responsi-\nbility, advancement, autonomy, opportunities for creativity,\nand the work itself. The Job Characteristics Theory (Hack-\nman & Oldham, 1980) identified five core job characteristics\n(skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and\nfeedback) that vary as a function of three critical psychologi-\ncal states (experienced meaningfulness at work, responsibil-\nity for outcomes and knowledge of results), which in turn\ninfluence work outcomes such as job satisfaction, perfor-\nmance quality and absenteeism. Within this context, job\nenlargement, job rotation, and job enrichment emerge as\nthree possible ways of enriching the motivational content of\njobs by adding variety and challenge.\nAll the theories of work motivation have their own\nstrengths and limitations and despite efforts to develop an\nintegrated model of motivation, it remains to be seen whether\nthis is desirable or even possible. In line with this, Grant and\nShin (2012) put forth the following recommendation:\nOur own view is that given the complexity of psychological,\nsocial, and situational influences on motivation, researchers are\nbest advised to develop, test, and elaborate middle-range\ntheories (Weick, 1974) that are problem-driven--designed to\nexplain particular phenomena and outcomes, rather than seeking\nFactors Affecting Female Participation Rates\nVarious factors have been proposed in the literature that\nencourage or hinder women to engage in the labor market.\nIn this subsection, we provide an overview of the foreign\nliterature on gender roles attitudes, work\u00adlife balance, flex-\nible work-arrangements, and the role of significant others in\nsupporting working mothers. We then focus on initiatives\nthat have been proposed or implemented to reduce gender\ndisparity in employment participation rates.\nGender roles and attitudes. Traditionally, the role of the hus-\nband was that of the main breadwinner (or primary economic\nprovider) while the role of women was primarily as home-\nmakers (Davis & Greenstein, 2009). In the case of neo-tradi-\ntional marriages, although the men and women work, men\nand women are expected to have goals aligned to work cen-\ntrality and family centrality, respectively; this being in sharp\ncontrast with an egalitarian gender role orientation mind-set,\nwhere men and women can aspire equally to both roles\n(Fletcher & Bailyn, 2005). Although it was expected that\ngender role attitudes would eventually be eradicated in the\nnew millennium, particularly in the western world, studies at\nthe start of the millennium showed otherwise (Sj\u00f6berg,\nvided evidence of linkages among marriage structure, gender\nideology, and workplace attitudes and behaviors, thereby\nunmasking a pocket of resistance to the gender revolution.\nThey found that employed husbands in traditional and neo-\ntraditional marriages (a) viewed unfavorably the presence of\nwomen at the workplace, (b) perceived that organizations\nwith a higher number of female employees operated less\nsmoothly, (c) that organizations with female leaders are\nunattractive, and (d) that they deny female employees the\nopportunities for promotion. Desai et al. (2012) argued that\nthe posture of these men, who represent a potentially large\nand influential group, is unlikely to change until the structure\nof their marriage changes, something that is highly improb-\nable. In an interview, Desai, as cited in Casserly (2012),\nargued that hope lies in the hands of the new generation of\nmothers and sons. She recommends to stay-at-home mothers\nto show their children that even they can participate in the\nso-called masculine domain finances whilst ensuring that the\nhusband shares in the feminine domestic chores.\nWork\u00adlife balance and flexible working arrangements.Studies\nshow that stress related to the conflict between work and\nfamily has been increasing (Grzywacs, Almeida, & McDon-\nald, 2002) and more evident in patriarchal societies (Aziz &\nCunningham, 2008). In the EU, a strategy to reduce imbal-\nance was the introduction of the Working Time Directive,\nwhich implemented a maximum 48-working time budget\n2003). The European Quality of Life Survey (Anderson,\nMikuli\u00e7, Vermeylen, Lyly-Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4inen, & Zigante, 2009)\nfound that although Europeans were generally satisfied and\nhappy with life, the countries in South-Eastern Europe such\nas Greece and Croatia had the most problems with work\u00adlife\nbalance. Crompton and Lyonette (2006) found that, apart\nfrom Scandinavian countries, there was no evidence that\n4 SAGE Open\nstate policies in Europe had an absolute impact on men in\ntaking a larger share of domestic work. In this regard, more\nand more women are trying to find working time arrange-\nments that are flexible rather than high powered careers, to\ncombine family commitments and paid work; however, this\nresults in poorer job content, reduced training opportunities,\ndiminished promotion opportunities, and fewer entitlements\nto social protection (Connolly & Gregory, 2008; Lyonette,\nBaldauf, & Behle, 2010; McDonald, Bradley, & Brown,\nalthough women are able to juggle their work and family\nlives just as much as men, they feel guiltier of doing so,\nregardless of age, marital status, socioeconomic status or\nwhether they had children, and even after statistically adjust-\ning for work\u00adfamily conflict. Women perceive their employ-\nmentaspreventingthemfromfulfillingfamilyresponsibilities\nand they have negative feelings about boundary spanning\nwork demands (e.g., answering a work-related e-mail or\nphone call), and this role blurring (which emphasizes over-\nlapping versus incompatible role domains), which is distinct\nfrom work\u00adfamily conflict, \"may have negative consequences\nfor well-being\" (p. 53).\nSignificant others in supporting working mothers. An important\nrole in encouraging and supporting mothers to work is that\nplayed by significant others (often referred to as \"strong\nties\") such as fathers, grandparents, close friends and older\nchildren, particularly when it comes to take care of their\nlighted the importance of the relationship with \"weak ties\"\nsuch as employers. The attitude of employers toward family-\nfriendly measures and social relationships at work were cru-\ncial to enable lone mothers to sustain their employment. She\nfound that informal cooperation from employers and col-\nleagues, as in the case when children were sick, was \"a com-\nmon theme in managing work, and far more important than\nany statutory rights or formal agreements\" (p. 10).\nInitiatives to reduce gender disparity. Organizations have been\ndepicted as playing a key role in generating and sustaining\ninequality in the workplace (Fernandez & Mors, 2008). Vari-\nous initiatives to reduce gender disparities in the workplace\ninclude maternity leave programs (Kelly & Dobbin, 1999),\nmerit-based pay practices (Castilla, 2008), and job-training\narrangements (Kalev, 2009); Kalev, Dobbin, and Kelly\n(2006) found that practices designed to moderate managerial\nbias through training and feedback were the least effective,\npractices designed to reduce the social isolation of women\nand minority workers to be moderately effective, while pro-\ngrams designed to establish organizational responsibility for\ndiversity were the most effective, yet they only produced\nmodest effects.\nHakim (2004) argued that there are four important factors\nthat a country must adapt to increase the female involve-\nment in the labor market. These are: (a) ideological reform:\npromotions to make females aware of the importance of\nemployment participation; (b) legislation: increasing female\nemployment involvement and favoring a free market policy;\n(c) fiscal policy: altering tax rates that are attractive to cur-\nrent and prospective female employees, and (d) institutional\nchange: employers offering employees flexi-time or working\nfrom home possibilities, and with schools providing child-\ncare provision after school hours.\nSlocum and Hellriegel (2009) recommended the follow-\ning approach: (a) meet basic human needs, (b) design jobs\nthat motivate people, (c) enhance the belief that goals can be\nreached, and (d) treat people equitably. They also add the\nimportance of making sure that employees do the type of\nemployment they applied for, rather than duties that make\nthem feel underutilized, and to help them be innovative so\nthat they move away from routine jobs.\nThe European Commission has recently adopted gender\nquotas, which would see women represent 40% of nonexecu-\ntive board member positions in public companies by 2018\nand private companies by 2020. As the Commission put it\n\"opening the doors to senior positions will act as an incentive\nfor women to enter and stay in the workforce, helping to raise\nfemale employment rates . . . and to achieve the targets set by\nWomen and Work in the Maltese Context\nAccording to the National Commission for Promotion of\nEquality [NCPE] (2011), the working environment in Malta\nis characterized by a combination of gendered welfare\nregime, strong patriarchal social structures, strong family\ntraditions and Catholic faith. In addition, the Maltese welfare\nsystem is a compromise between the Mediterranean (charac-\nterized by traditional gender roles--providing husband and\ncaring wife), the liberal (comprehensive social welfare) and\nthe corporatist-conservative (which encourages mother-\nhood). The gendered welfare state links with the culturally\nconstructed ideology, which is still strong in the Maltese\nislands. Despite incentives for women to engage in the labor\nmarket, these characteristics are potentially presenting a hos-\ntile environment for Maltese women. Reference is made by\n41% of inactive women in Malta reported that they did not\nwork due to \"other family or personal reasons\" while an\ninsignificant number of men indicated this reason for being\ninactive. This scenario clearly questions the relevance of\nAnglo-American literature to Maltese workers' work moti-\nvation and work ethic. In this section, we overview the major\nfindings related to work motivation and work hindrances that\nemerged from Maltese studies.\nThe NCPE (2011) also study provides a comprehensive\noverview of the Maltese literature on work hindrances and\nhighlighted multiple disadvantages that Maltese women\nface in the Maltese labor market. These include (a) the gen-\nder gap in pay, with lower pay rates for women, (b) lower\nBezzina et al. 5\nqualification levels of women despite a significant increase\nin tertiary education for women in the last decade, (c) lower\npercentages of inactive women participating in training and\neducation when compared with inactive men and corre-\nsponding EU27 figures, (d) a downward trend in vulnerable\nemployment since the economic crisis of 2008, which his-\ntorically has been dominated by women, (e) lack of aware-\nness of employees rights by employers, and (vi) short school\nhours.\nNCPE (2011) conducted a descriptive study with inactive\nMaltese women and found that 65% of those surveyed\nclaimed that they would prefer to raise their children them-\nselves and to give up paid employment rather than using a\nchildcare facility. In addition, 40.5% claimed that if they\nleave their children for long hours at a childcare facility, they\nfeel that they are actually abandoning their children and\nhence they are not good mothers. In all, 75% of the 61.5%\nwho plan to seek work were mainly motivated by money,\nand 54.5% were interested in part-time work to help them\nattend to work and family life. A total of 68% of respondents\nwere not aware of government incentives aimed at helping\ninactive women to work, while many felt that such govern-\nment incentives were offensive as they underestimated their\nrole as homemakers and mothers. The NCPE (2011) study\nwith labor inactive women concluded that such incentives\nwould not work unless there was a change in culture.\nBorg and Vella (2007) set out to identify the work aspira-\ntions of Maltese working women. They found that employ-\nment helps women to enhance their quality of life and of\ntheir dependents, to gain financial independence, to enhance\nskills and personal development, to be productive and to feel\nsatisfied that they are contributing to society. More recently,\nBorg (2011) argued that by working, women become more\nindependent as they are more able to satisfy their own needs\nand to enhance their standard of living, Moreover, work\nallows women to gain self-confidence that helps in nurturing\ntalent and socialization and provides mothers with the oppor-\ntunity to inspire their children and to instill in them a positive\nattitude toward working from a young age.\nMethod\nThe Research Gap in Malta\nAs mentioned earlier, the specific context of Malta and the\nrelatively hostile environment for women to work raises\nquestions on the relevance of the Anglo-American literature\nfor Malta. Although quite a few studies have been conducted\nin Malta on work motivations and hindrances, the majority\nof them lack methodological rigor, or else the data analysis\nthey conducted was quite simplistic as it generally consisted\nof a basic descriptive summary with the use of counts, per-\ncentages, and/or means. In addition, most of the research\nconclusions drawn are in the form of suggested explanations\nwith little empirical basis.\nIn view of the above, the primary aim of this empirical\nstudy is to gain a better understanding of the work motiva-\ntions of Maltese female workers. This study will extend the\nMaltese literature on work motivation by examining the\nunderlying dimensions of work motivation among Maltese\nfemale workers. The study also attempts to identify the work\nhindrances faced by working women (as previous Maltese\nstudies focused exclusively on the unemployed or the inac-\ntive) in an attempt to provide useful recommendations that\nmight better guide Maltese labor market policy makers in\ntheir quest to increase the employment rate of women in\nMalta. In this study, any explanations that we provide are\nsupported by empirical evidence.\nThe Research Questions\nThis empirical study attempts to answer the following five\nresearch questions:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Research Question 1: How important are the various\nwork motivation factors for employed women in\nMalta?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Research Question 2: What are the underlying\ndimensions (or components) of work motivation of\nemployed women in Malta?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Research Question 3: Can the work motivation com-\nponents adequately predict the intention of women to\nkeep on working in the future (at least up to the retire-\nment age), after controlling for the demographic\nvariables?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Research Question 4: What are the main challenges\nthat Maltese female workers face to work?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Research Question 5: What should be done by\nMaltese policy makers to increase the participation\nrate of women in the Maltese labor market?\nThe study is exploratory in nature and so no hypotheses\nhave been set.\nPopulation and Sample Characteristics\nTable 1 exhibits a breakdown of the female working popula-\ntion in Malta by age and occupation, according to the \"Labour\nThe Labour Force Survey was used because the Census of\nyet been published by the National Statistics Office.\nThe National Statistics Office was not in a position to\nprovide us with the names and contact details of the\nemployed women due to the Malta Statistics Authority Act\n(Malta Statistics Authority, 2000). Hence, with no sampling\nframe available, we had to resort to a nonprobability sam-\npling technique, namely, quota sampling. Quota sampling is\nsimilar to stratified sampling but leaves the choice of the\nelements to the discretion of the researcher (Hair, Money,\n6 SAGE Open\nSamuoel, & Page, 2007). Although the elements are not\nselected at random, the representativeness of quota sam-\npling is still reasonable to high (Saunders, Lewis, &\nThornhill, 2012). In determining sample size for this study,\nwe focused on those variables in the questionnaire that were\nlikely to have the greatest variability (De Vaus, 2002)--\nthese being the dichotomous categories (e.g., YES vs. No).\nUsing the confidence interval of a proportion dialog box in\nthe \"Java Applets for Power and Sample Size\" (Lenth,\nwomen, a 95% degree of confidence, a 5% margin of error\nand a true sample proportion of 50% (assuming a worst-case\nscenario for the percentage belonging to a specified cate-\ngory). The required minimum sample size with the preset\ncriteria was 383, and this was rounded up to 400. In select-\ning the 400 participants, we sought help from our network of\nfriends from the Malta Employers Association and from the\nTrade Unions who voluntarily agreed to help us in the\nprocess.\nAfter establishing contact with the participants, the vast\nmajority (72%) provided us with their e-mail address, and\nwe forwarded to them a link to our survey on surveymonkey.\ncom. The other respondents preferred to provide the\nresponses via a telephone interview (24%) or using tradi-\ntional mail (4%). The respondents were informed that there\nwere no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answers to the statements and\nthat the individual responses would be used by researchers to\nsee the \"big picture.\" Confidentiality was guaranteed and the\nrespondents were assured that all information gathered was\nto be used solely for research purposes. All data were col-\nlected during July 2012. Table 2 exhibits the population and\nsample distributions by age and occupation.\nThe Survey\nBefore constructing the survey, three focus groups were con-\nducted with 10 active women, 10 inactive women, and 10 rela-\ntives living in households with working women. The members\nhad different ages that ranged from 18 to 64 and occupied\nvarious roles in the labor market. The moderators tried to elicit\nthe primary motives for working from the group members\nwithout influencing them. The participants declared that they\nwere more than happy to discuss the topic and to present their\nviews on the subject. The sessions were transcribed, but we\nassured the participants that their names would not be dis-\nclosed in any way to guarantee confidentiality. From these\nfocus groups, 16 distinct work motivations emerged: (a) finan-\ncial independence, (b) earning money for basic necessities (or\nday-to-day needs), (c) meeting people and making new friends\n(socialization), (d) keeping busy, (e) for skill/ability utiliza-\ntion, (f) to gain a sense of achievement, (g) to feel responsible\nfor their work, (h) to be recognized for their work, (i) to\nenhance their self-esteem, (j) for career advancement, (k) to\nsupervise or guide others, (l) to climb up the social ladder, (m)\nto be creative/innovative, (n) to do something different from\nhousework (variety), (o) to enjoy a more comfortable lifestyle,\nand (p) to escape from personal problems and/or bad habits\n(protection). We did not attempt to classify these motivators as\nintrinsic or extrinsic due to the general difficulty in identifying\npurely intrinsic and extrinsic factors and the nature of the\ninteraction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivators. Instead,\nwe subjected the responses pertaining to these 16 statements to\nexploratory factor analysis, to identify the underlying latent\nstructure of work motivation for employed women in Malta.\nThe survey consisted of three sections. Section A con-\nsisted of the 16 statements related to the work motivations\nand respondents were requested to indicate their level of\nagreement with each statement on a standard five-point\nscale ranging from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\"\n(e.g., \"A job gives me the opportunity to provide for the\nday-to-day needs\"). Section B consisted of the following\ntwo open-ended responses: (a) What are the main chal-\nlenges that you face to work? (b) What strategies would\nyou like to see implemented by policy makers to increase\nthe chances that you will keep on working in the future and\nalso to attract new women to the Maltese labor market?\nFinally, in Section C, the respondents were requested to\nprovide demographic information regarding their age, mar-\nital status (single and never married, married or other),\nnumber of children (as dependents), occupation, level of\nTable 1.

They were also requested\nto rate their intention to continue to work in the future (at\nleast up to the retirement age) on a dichotomous scale with\n\"No\" (coded as \"0\") and \"Yes\" (coded as \"1\") categories.\nData Analysis Procedure\nFor the closed-ended responses of the survey, we started by\ndetermining, via descriptive statistics, how important the 16\nproposed reasons to work (which emerged from the focus\ngroups) were in motivating Maltese women to work. Then,\nthe responses to 16 work motivation statements were sub-\njected to exploratory Factor Analysis, to investigate the\nunderlying factor structure of the work motivations of\nMaltese female workers. Finally, hierarchical binary logistic\nregression was used to investigate which of the work motiva-\ntion factors (as suggested by Factor Analysis) emerged as\nsignificant predictors of the intention of Maltese women to\ncontinue to work in the future (at least up to the retirement\nage) after controlling for any effects of the demographic\nvariables (i.e., age, education, number of children, employ-\nment type, and marital status). The above statistical analyses\nwere conducted in the IBM SPSS V20 package.\nFor the open-ended responses, a thematic approach was\nadopted to analyze the primary data in an attempt to identify\nkey themes that would prove to be helpful in identifying\nstrategies for attracting and retaining female workers to the\nlabor market and in providing some interesting avenues for\nfurther research.\nResults\nHow important are the various work motivation factors\nfor employed women?\nWith the scale for each statement ranging from \"1\" (for\nstrongly disagree) to \"5\" (for strongly agree), descriptive sta-\ntistics of the responses to the 16 work motivation statements\nrevealed that the respondents:\n1. strongly agree (median = 5) that a job gives them the\nchance to pay for basic necessities and to be finan-\ncially independent;\n2. agree (median = 4) that a job gives them the opportu-\nnity to socialize, to utilize their skills/abilities, to gain\na sense of achievement, to be responsible/account-\nable for their work, to enjoy a more comfortable life-\nstyle, to keep busy, to enhance their self-esteem, to\nadvance in their career, to be recognized for their\nwork, to be creative in their work, and to climb the\nsocial ladder;\n3. neither agree nor disagree (median = 3) that work\ngives them the opportunity to escape from problems\nor bad habits, and to supervise (or guide) other\nworkers.\nA summary of descriptive statistics is presented in Table 3.\nWhat are the underlying dimensions (or components) of\nthe work motivation of employed women in Malta?\nFactor analysis is a method for investigating whether the\ninformation provided by a large number of variables can be\ncondensed into a smaller set of unobservable factors or com-\nponents (Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 1998). In pre-\nliminary analysis, we examined the statistical assumptions of\nFactor Analysis. The Bartlett Test of Sphericity, Approx. 2\ntaken overall) were statistically significant. In addition, the\nKaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin (KMO = .908) measure of sampling\nadequacy was acceptable (Hair et al., 1998). Hence, the\nFactor Analysis proceeded.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that there\nwere two eigenvalues (or s) greater than \"1,\" with Factor 1\nmotivation. After applying Direct Oblimin (an oblique fac-\ntor rotation that extracts correlated factors), Factor 1 com-\nprised nine work motivation aspects (skill/ability utilization,\nsense of achievement, for career advancement, supervision,\nTable 2.

Rotation converged in 5 iterations; Factor loadings greater than \u00b1\n0.3 are presented in bold.\ncreativity, recognition, self-esteem, responsibility, and social\nstatus), while Factor 2 comprised the remaining seven work\nmotivation aspects (financial independence, socialization,\nkeeping busy, escape, earning money for basic necessities,\nenjoying a more comfortable lifestyle, and variety from\nhousework). A summary of the Pattern matrix factor load-\nings is presented in Table 4.\nFactor 1 was interpreted as Personal and Professional\nDevelopment while Factor 2 was interpreted as Social and\nEconomic Well-being. There was a substantial correlation\nbetween the factors (r = .56). No variable loaded significantly\non more than one factor (i.e.,  .30). Reliability analysis\nrevealed that the internal consistency reliability of the Factor 1\nN = 7) measures were acceptable as they both exceeded .7\n(Hair et al., 1998). Therefore, we concluded that the two work\nmotivation components that emerged from Factor Analysis\nwere internally consistent and unidimensional.\nCan the work motivation components adequately predict\nthe intention of women to keep on working in the\nfuture (at least up to the retirement age), after control-\nling for the demographic variables?\nPreliminary analysis, via zero-order correlations, revealed\nthat the intention to continue working in the future was:\na. significantly correlated with \"personal and profes-\nsional development\" (r = .43, p < .01), \"social and psy-\nchological well-being\" (r = .33, p < .01), level of\neducation (r = .36, p < .01), and number of children as\ndependants (r = -.18, p < .01), single but never married\nb. not significantly correlated with the employment cate-\ngories--full-time (r = .02, p = .67), full-time with\nreduced hours (r = -.01, p = .78), and part-time (r =\n-.01, p = .79)--and two of the three civil status catego-\np = .02), which comprises those who are divorced,\nwidowed, separated, or had their marriage annulled.\nBinary logistic regression is a statistical technique that is\nsimilar in many respects to multiple regression analysis, but\nis more appropriate when the criterion variable is qualitative\nor binary (Cramer, 2003). In hierarchical binary logistic\nregression, it is possible to know what additional proportion\nof variance in intention to continue to work is explained by\nthe two work motivation components after external factors\nsuch as demographic variables are controlled. Intention to\ncontinue working in the future (No = 0, Yes = 1) was included\nas the dependent variable, while the two work motivation\ncomponents and five demographic variables of age, educa-\ntion, number of children as dependants, employment type\n(a categorical variable) and marital status (a categorical vari-\nable) were included as covariates. Here, the demographic\nvariables were entered together in the first step, while the\nwork motivation components were entered together in the\nsecond step.\nPrior to the interpretation of hierarchical binary logistic\nregression results, a summary of which is presented in\nTable 5, a residual analysis was conducted. All DFBETAs\nwere less than 1, the leverage statistics were close to the\nTable 3.

Hence, according to the guidelines pro-\nvided by Field (2009), there was no evidence of isolated\npoints that might have fitted the model poorly or exerted an\nundue influence on the logistic regression model.\nWhen the constant was entered into the model (Block 0),\nthe regression weight for the constant in Step 0 was statisti-\ncation table indicated that 79% of the cases were correctly\nclassified and hence, the proportional by chance accuracy\nfor 24.9% of the variability in intention (based on Nagelkerke\nR2). The classification table indicated that 81.3% of the cases\nwere correctly classified at this stage.\nWhen the work motivation components were introduced,\nwere entered into the model. The work motivation compo-\nnents accounted for an additional 21.5%, resulting in a total\nNagelkerke R2 of 46.4%, and an overall holdout accuracy\nrate of 86.5%. Therefore, it was concluded that the probabil-\nity of working in the future (at least up to the retirement age)\nwas associated with (a) a higher level of education,\n(b) a greater motivation for Personal and Professional\nDevelopment, and (c) a greater motivation for Social and\nEconomic Well-Being.\nThe final overall accuracy of classification of the model\n(86.5%) exceeded the proportional by chance accuracy\nutility of the logistic regression model (Hosmer &\nWhat are the main challenges that Maltese female work-\ners have to face to work?\nThe responses to this open-ended question could be\ngrouped under the following seven headings: (a) not being\naccepted to work in male dominated jobs, (b) facing a lot of\nresistance from male colleagues at work, (c) difficulty when\ncompared with their male counterparts to get promoted at the\nplace of work, and hence a lower salary, (d) difficulty in\nfinding suitable and affordable childcare facilities for chil-\ndren, (e) time management related to work and family\nresponsibilities, (f) difficulty to find a job with reduced hours\nand flexi-time, and (g) husbands or partners who do not give\na helping hand at home and so the work at home has to be\ndone by the women irrespective of whether they work.\nWhat should be done by Maltese policy makers to increase\nthe participation rate of women in the Maltese labor\nmarket?\nThe recommendations provided by the respondents\ncould be grouped under the following seven headings: (a)\nenforce harassment laws at the place of work, (b) increase\nopportunities for flexi-time and reduced hours, particularly\nfor parents with young children, (c) longer school hours,\n(d) more affordable childcare centers and close to the place\nof work, (e) to continue investing in education, and provide\nadditional support to women to keep studying beyond a\nfirst degree or a postgraduate diploma, (f) increase tax\nincentives for working mothers, and (g) enforce laws to\nensure that no-one abuses of social assistance so that there\nwill be a better distribution of social assistance to those\nwho deserve it.\nTable 5.

These are: for financial indepen-\ndence; to pay for basic necessities (or day-to-day needs); to\nmeet people and making new friends (socialization); to keep\nbusy; for skill/ability utilization; to gain a sense of achieve-\nment; responsibility; recognition; to increase self-esteem; for\ncareer advancement; for supervision; to climb up the social\nladder; to contribute to the economy of the country; to be\ncreative; variety from housework; to enjoy a more comfort-\nable lifestyle; and to escape from personal problems or bad\nhabits (protection). The study confirms the findings by Borg\nand Vella (2007) that employed women are primarily moti-\nvated by financial independence, but they are also highly\ninterested in their career, social status, self-esteem, among\nothers. This is clearly a sign that we are in the right direction,\nparticularly in view of the fact that the Maltese context has\nbeen described as a hostile environment for working women\nThe most important contribution of the present study is that\nit provides empirical evidence that the 16 work motivations of\nMaltese female workers could be grouped into two internally\nconsistent and unidimensional components, namely, \"personal\nand professional development\" and \"social and economic\nwell-being.\" This classification was very logical and it solved\nthe original problem that we had, prior to conducting the factor\nanalysis, in grouping the 16 motivations into intrinsic or\nextrinsic. This mainly resulted from general difficulty in iden-\ntifying purely extrinsic and extrinsic factors and due to the\nnature of the interaction between the two.\nThe study also shows that those who have a greater inten-\ntion to continue working in the future (at least up to the\nretirement age) had a higher level of education and reported\na higher motivation for \"Personal and Professional\nDevelopment\" and for \"Social and Economic Well-Being.\"\nEducation provides many opportunities to acquire a range of\nskills and abilities, and in overcoming the ever-increasing\ncompetition in today's job market. This is because education\npays in higher earnings and lower employment rates (Baum,\nThe fact that work motivations produced a significant impact\non the intention to continue working has important implica-\ntions for organizations. The work motivations of female\nemployees may be enhanced at the workplace through orga-\nnizational strategies and managerial practices. This would\nnot only benefit the women in achieving their motivational\ngoals but also the companies in overcoming the shortages of\nskilled labor resulting from ageing populations that are put-\nting an increasing brake on economic growth (European\nFinally, this study identified that the main challenges that\nfemale workers face to participate in the labor market are\nmainly related to (a) discriminations at the place of work\n(lower pay, fewer promotions gap, and harassment), (b) a\nstrong culturally constructed ideology in the Maltese islands\n(husbands or partners who do not participate in home chores\nor disapprove of their wife/partner working), and (c) an inad-\nequate support structure (lack of affordable childcare cen-\nters, relatively short school hours, difficulty to find employers\nwho commit to flexible work arrangements). Based on these\nfindings, we propose the following recommendations to\nlabor market policy makers and employees:\n1. To increase the supply of childcare centers and with\nextended opening hours to accommodate those work-\ning on a shift basis. In addition, it is important that\nthese childcare centers are located close to the places\nof work, particularly in areas where there is a large\nconcentration of employees.\n2. To enact policies to increase childcare availability:\nCompanies employing a sizable number of employ-\nees should be encouraged to have in-house facilities\nfor childcare or to make agreements with childcare\ncenters nearby.\n3. To increase school hours to accommodate office\nhours: Extra school hours could include extracurricu-\nlar activities such as football nurseries and dance les-\nsons. Alternatively, students may have the chance to\ndo their homework at school in the presence of a\nqualified learning assistant. However, although Malta\nhas one of the lowest rates of school hours in the EU,\nthe Malta Union of Teachers has been against the\nextension of school opening hours.\n4. Invest further in education and training: There needs\nto be increased public awareness of the factors under-\nlying low female participation in Malta and the ben-\nefits of working legally. The government of Malta\nneeds to invest further in tailor-made vocational\ntraining and nonformal education for the needs of\nwomen who would like to be productively employed\nand to reduce the skills gap. It would also make more\nsense if courses targeted for mothers are offered dur-\ning school hours rather than during the evening. In\naddition, if we ever want to have more women on\ncorporate boards of listed companies, as recom-\nmended by the European Commission (2012a), edu-\ncational policy makers need to provide additional\nsupport to women to help them to keep studying\nbeyond a first degree or a postgraduate diploma. As\nBezzina (2010) put it, if Maltese society succeeds in\nidentifying and nurturing talented persons, regardless\nof gender, that would help boost our economy.\n5. Amendments to Educational Policy: In line with the\nNCPE (2011) study, it is clear from the present study\nthat cultural issues need to change to combat the hos-\ntile environment women have to face to work. In this\nregard, we recommend amendments in the educa-\ntional policy whereby new \"learning\" is provided\nfrom a young age to change the existing attitudinal\nenvironment that distinguishes between the roles\n\"assigned\" to men and women in society. In addition,\nthe suggestion made by Desai (as cited in Casserly,\n2012) is relevant to the Maltese case--to recommend\nto mothers to show their children that even they can\nearn money and/or have a career (traditionally con-\nsidered as pertaining to the male domain), whilst\nensuring that their boys as well as their husbands\nshare in domestic chores (traditionally considered as\npertaining to the feminine domain).\n6. Provide incentives to companies that offer family-\nfriendly measures such as teleworking and flexible\nhours, to help women better reconcile family and\nwork responsibilities, particularly in view of the fact\nthat most of the companies in Malta have a negative\nattitude toward such measures. Hewlett (2009) pro-\nvides evidence that a number of international firms\nthat committed to flexible work arrangements coped\nbetter with tough times during the economic reces-\nsion (via reduced payroll costs) while the employees\nwho opted for these arrangements had more control\nover their destiny, resulting in a win-win situation\nfor employees and employers.\n7. Promoting men in the family sphere: The traditional\ngender ideology, with women as caregivers and men\nas breadwinners is still strong in Malta (NCPE,\n2011). More initiatives similar to the \"sharing work\u00ad\nlife responsibilities\" program (a social marketing\ncampaign funded by the EU) are needed to challenge\ntraditional roles and to promote the benefits of men's\ninvolvement in the family. In addition, policy makers\ncould consider introducing the father to the picture\nwhen it comes to maternity leave. After all, the father\nalso bears child-bearing responsibilities and paternity\nleave could possibly reduce discrimination against\nwomen in the recruitment stage as such leave is cur-\nrently only associated with women.\n8. Awareness and practicality of measures. Measures\nthat are introduced should be heavily communicated\nand promoted to ensure that females are aware of\nthem. At the same time, such measures need to be\npractical and do not involve a lot of bureaucracy for\nwomen to benefit from them.\n9. Trade-off between welfare and work--increase mini-\nmum wage? The respondents reported that the mini-\nmum wage is so low that it is not worth working.\nHowever, raising the minimum wage, as some sug-\ngested is not as simple as it might seem. This pro-\nposal needs to be studied further. An industrial impact\nanalysis could be conducted to determine whether\nfirms are in a position to absorb the additional costs,\nor whether this would reduce Malta's competitive-\nness resulting in many jobs being lost (Bezzina,\nFalzon, & Zammit, 2012). The respondents' concern\non the low pay is not limited to Malta. In a foreign\nstudy, Edin and Lein (1997) found that employed\nlone mothers spent substantially more each month to\nkeep their families together (with childcare, commut-\ning or double tax on earnings) than welfare recipients\ndid, and \"instead of achieving their goals, they were\ngetting further and further behind in their bills\" (p. x).\nOur recommendation here is that if we want to see\nmore women engage in the labor market, we need to\nprovide women with jobs that act like ladders not\nchutes. In addition, prevention of nonobserved eco-\nnomic activity should not only increase tax revenue\nbut also a means to support lawful entrepreneurship\nand employment.\n10. 10.Fighting Discrimination and Harassment:\nAlthough there are sufficient laws in place to safe-\nguard against discrimination and harassment,\nenforcement needs to be strengthened. It is the criti-\ncal responsibility of the government to promote\nadherence to the law by discovering and punishing\npersons who violate the established rules.\nTo stand a better chance of being implemented success-\nfully, all the above measures and recommendations need to\nbe part of a new integrated strategic labor market plan. More\nclose collaboration between the government and the private\nsector is required. Having the government striving to pro-\nmote effective policies and the private sector not willing to\ncollaborate will not yield any benefits.\nConclusion\nThere are some limitations to the findings, however, that\nmust be noted. First, this study focused exclusively on female\nworkers and thus excluded men, an equally important seg-\nment of the labor force. Second, the findings were based on\na quota sample of employed women, and so the sampling\ncharacteristics might not have represented the population\nwell. Third, the study was based on self-reports. It could be\nthat some respondents might have encountered difficulty to\nanswer with objectivity and precision on a five-point Likert-\ntype scale, or might have given answers that were desired,\nand this might have biased in some way or other the findings.\nFourth, to avoid problems associated with a lengthy ques-\ntionnaire, we only asked a single question related to each\nwork motivation aspect, and hence we are not in a position to\ntest the reliability of the individual work motivation aspects\nassessed. We did however test the reliability and validity of\nthe two work motivation constructs that emerged from this\nstudy. Finally, the study was conducted in the specific social,\ncultural, and economic context of Malta. Hence, the find-\nings/implications of this study might not lend themselves to\ngeneralizations over other cultures and societies.\nDespite these limitations, this study contributes to a better\nunderstanding and assessment of the work motivations of\nMaltese workers, particularly for Malta where such research\nis lacking. It addresses 10 practical recommendations that\ncould better guide Maltese labor market policy makers in\ntheir quest to attract more women to the labor market, whilst\nensuring that those who are currently working continue to\nwork in the future (at least up to the retirement age).\nFollowing this study, interesting avenues for further\nresearch emerge. Researchers interested in examining fur-\nther the work motivations of women (employed, unem-\nployed, or inactive) might wish to combine an interpretative\napproach with a quantitative analysis like this one to tease\nout the intricacies of individual and group behaviors and\nmotivations. This study could be extended by examining\nwork motivations by occupation, to identify the specific\nneeds of each distinct occupational group. Finally, there is a\nneed for research that examines strategies for increasing\nwomen's participation in the labor market so that societies\ndo not continue to underutilize the many talents and skills\nthat women bring to the workplace. Such research would\nbetter inform theory and practice.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nreceived financial support for the research from the University of\nReferences\nAbela, A., Abdilla, N., Abela, C., Camilleri, J., Mercieca, D., &\nMercieca, G.
