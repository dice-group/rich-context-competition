Based upon standardized questionnaire\nassessments of nationally representative samples of school-attending youths drawn in Panama, the five Spanish\nindicate that higher levels of religious practice are inversely associated with the earliest stages of tobacco and\ncannabis experiences (i.e., the first chance to try and the first actual use) but not so for alcohol. To illustrate, for\neach unit increase in levels of religious practice behaviors, there was an associated reduced occurrence of the\nfirst chance to try tobacco (odds ratio = 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.94). Occurrence of first actual use\nof tobacco and cannabis was not associated with levels of religious practice behaviors among youths exposed to\nthe opportunity to try these drugs. As such, these behaviors apparently have not strengthened resistance. Rather,\nautarcesis may be at work, functioning to shield youths from drug exposure opportunities.\nadolescent; alcohol drinking; cannabis; leisure activities; religion; tobacco\nAbbreviations: aOR, adjusted odds ratio; CI, confidence interval; KR , Kuder-Richardson 20 estimate of Cronbach's ; OR,\nodds ratio; PACARDO, acronym for the countries comprising the study (Panama, Central America, Dominican Republic).\nThe main aim of this study is to estimate the degree to\nwhich engagement in religious activities might shield or\notherwise protect youths from the earliest stages of drug\ninvolvement versus an alternative resistance-strengthening\nmechanism of protection. Background for this research\nincludes more than a century of epidemiologic studies on the\ntopic of health and religion (e.g., denominational affiliation:\nCatholic vs. Protestant and so on). During the 20th century,\nthe concept of religiosity was broadened to encompass a\nbehavioral facet (e.g., frequency of church attendance) and a\npsychological facet (e.g., level of personal commitment to\nthe deity), as well as religion-associated diet or health prac-\ntices such as circumcision (1).\nReligiosity in these facets has links to an array of mental\nhealth-related conditions and behaviors, including drug\ninvolvement (1\u00ad8). For example, Miller et al. (3) studied a\nlarge epidemiologic sample of adolescents in the United\nStates and found lower occurrence of drug-related clinical\nproblems among youths with high values on religious devo-\ntion. We appreciate religiosity as a multidimensional\nconstruct that encompasses, at minimum, both behavioral\nfacets and psychological facets (1, 3, 8). Nonetheless, epide-\nmiologic studies of health and religiosity often have\nneglected this multidimensional character; religiosity is\noften assessed by a single interview or questionnaire item\n(9). Even when religiosity is conceptualized and measured as\na multidimensional concept, investigators tend to examine\none dimension at a time, neglecting the other dimensions of\nreligiosity (3, 10). Beyond issues of conceptualization and\nmeasurement of religiosity, another important issue in this\nline of research involves possible reciprocities such as might\narise when effects of drug use include disengagement from\npreviously valued facets of religiosity. These reciprocities\nbecome especially challenging when investigators study reli-\nCorrespondence to Dr. James C.

Drug exposure opportunities typically occur\nat or near the time of a young person's first chance to try a\ndrug. Borrowing the useful concept of \"autarcesis\" from the\nearly days of infectious disease epidemiology (13), our\nthesis is that adolescent religious practice behaviors may\nhave autarceologic properties, functioning to shield youths\nfrom risk of harm, especially when there is a tangible\n\"agent\" in the pathogenesis, etiology, and natural history of\na health condition. If religious behaviors are associated\ninversely with the occurrence of youthful drug use, one\npossibility is that these behaviors strengthen resistance once\na chance to try the drug occurred (e.g., resistance against\npeer pressure to try drugs). A second possibility is that these\nbehaviors have shielded the youths from chances to try\ndrugs. It is in this second sense that these religious behaviors\nwould be serving an autarceologic function that can be\ndistinguished from the separate resistance-strengthening\nfunctions often stressed in drug prevention programs.\nAnalogous to standard epidemiologic case-control study\nprocedures with a focus on the most recent incident cases of\ndisease and nondiseased controls, our study focus is upon\n\"recent-onset\" cases of drug involvement (i.e., youths who\nfirst had a chance to try drugs within the 0\u00ad23 months prior\nto recruitment) and corresponding controls (i.e., youths who\nnever have had a chance to try these drugs). This approach\nprovides odds ratio estimates of the suspected protective\nassociations and places some constraints upon the possible\nreciprocal processes through which actual drug use might\ninfluence religious practice behaviors or other dimensions of\nreligiosity. The resulting odds ratio estimates are an approx-\nimation of estimates that might be achieved in a prospective\nstudy on this topic (14).\nSubjects\nOur epidemiologic data are from a study conducted during\ntries of Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras,\nNicaragua, Costa Rica), and la Republica Dominicana. The\nstudy takes its name as an acronym for these countries (PA +\nCA + RDO) and is referred to as the \"PACARDO\" project;\nit has been described in prior detailed reports (15). In brief,\nthis project involved an application of multistage probability\nsampling methods, which yielded a self-weighting sample of\nschools, and youths attending these schools, within each\ncountry. Within each sampled school, 1\u00ad3 classrooms were\nsampled at random from a roster of all classrooms with\npupils who were 16 years of age. All designated sample\nclassrooms participated. In aggregate, there was close to 100\npercent school-level participation (96 percent). The research\nprotocol included \"passive\" parental consent (via letters sent\nhome) and active youth assent. A total of 12,797 school-\nattending youth respondents participated in the PACARDO\nsurvey project as the lead assessor read aloud each\npreworded standardized item; more than 98 percent of\neligible youths participated (15). The protocol was approved\nby institutional review boards for human subjects' protection\nin each country and at Johns Hopkins University.\nThe standardized items of the PACARDO questionnaire\nwere subject to a translation, back-translation, and harmoni-\nzation process that involved all the leaders on the research\nteams, as well as pilot testing within these seven Latin Amer-\nican countries. The assessment plan involved a visit to each\nclassroom by a pair of trained assessors, who worked to\ndevelop trust and rapport, secure youth assent, and admin-\nister the anonymous questionnaire during an hour-long\nsession while the teacher was absent from the classroom.\nThe questionnaire included separate modules to assess the\nadolescent behavioral repertoire and drug experiences.\nFor this study, we excluded 1) 43 respondents (0.5\npercent) whose questionnaires indicated an age less than 12\nyears or more than 20 years for focus on school-attending\nyouths' experiences within these countries; 2) 97 respon-\ndents who reported use of \"cadrina\" (a nonexistent drug);\nand 3) 68 participants whose responses about the behavior\nrepertoire exhibited illogical patterns (e.g., having the same\nparticipation frequency on all the items in the behavioral\nrepertoire assessment). The mean age of the resulting 12,589\nrespondents was 16 years, one half of the respondents were\nrespondents attended private school (31.7 percent).\nAssessment of drug involvement\nThe primary response variables of interest have been\nassessed by standardized anonymous questionnaire items on\nadolescent drug involvement in relation to alcohol, tobacco,\nand illegal drugs (e.g., cannabis). For each drug, \"age of the\nfirst chance to try\" and \"age of first use\" were assessed sepa-\nrately by questions in the following form (English transla-\ntion): \"Regarding the drug cannabis, how old were you when\nyou first had the chance to try cannabis?\" and \"How old were\nyou when you first used cannabis?\" The time elapsed since\nonset of drug exposure opportunity (in years) was estimated\nby taking differences: age at assessment minus age at first\nchance to try a drug. Using these standardized items and\ndifference scores, we identified recent-onset youths (differ-\nence = 0 or 1), youths with no such drug experiences, and\nthose whose experiences were in the more distant past\n(difference > 1). Youths with onset in the more distant past\nhave been excluded from the analyses to constrain the poten-\ntial reciprocities and other influences discussed in our intro-\nduction. In the present study, the focus is upon the three most\ncommonly consumed drugs in this study population\n(alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis). For these drugs, most\nyouths with past exposure opportunity (difference > 1)\nalready started use of one or more drugs (e.g., 83 percent of\nrespondents with past alcohol opportunity had started using\nalcohol), and in this circumstance, the level of religiosity\nmight depend on the drug taking rather than vice versa.\nHence, in order to approximate estimates that might be found\nin a future prospective study, we focused our study solely on\nthe recent-onset youths, which constrains this possibility.\nMeasures of religiosity\nIndividual-level religiosity has been assessed by three\ndomains of standardized survey items: religious practice\nbehaviors, denomination, and devotion. To assess religious\nbehavioral repertoire as part of the more general adolescent\nbehavioral repertoire, we used the 25-item Behavioral\nRepertoire Self-rating Scale of Johanson et al. (16). This\nstandardized measurement evaluates how the youths allo-\ncated their time across a variety of activities. On this scale,\nthe four items on religious behavioral repertoire ask about\nthe time allocated to \"praying/reading the Bible,\" \"going to\nchurch,\" \"going to a religious revival,\" and \"going to a reli-\ngious retreat.\" Each item had eight response categories,\nranging from \"not even once this year\" to \"more than once\neach day.\" Prior latent variable analyses for discrete categor-\nical response variables disclosed that a religious activities\ndimension is one of five main dimensions of the adolescent\nbehavioral repertoire as measured in this study (17). This\nlatent structure analysis also yielded a standardized factor\nscore for the religious practice behavior dimension, with an\nWith respect to the denominational facet of religiosity,\nthree main subgroups were formed: \"Catholic (reference\ngroup),\" \"Protestant or other religions,\" and \"none,\" on the\nbasis of each youth's response to a single question: \"What is\nyour religion?\" For assessment of the psychological facet of\nreligiosity, the youths have been sorted into two groups\naccording to their responses to two standardized binary\nitems, one on the importance of going to church on Sundays\nand one on the importance of participating in church activi-\nties. One subgroup has a higher level of religious devotion\n(two positive responses reported), and the other subgroup\nhas a lower level of religious devotion (only zero or one\npositive response to these items).\nPotentially confounding covariates under study\nThe school type (public/private) is from administrative\nrecords, and all other potentially confounding variables were\nassessed by self-report. We sorted these variables into three\nmain groups: Group I, the religious denomination and reli-\ngious devotion variables already described in the section on\nreligiosity; Group II, exogenous sociodemographic covari-\nates, not likely to be influenced by drug use (age, sex,\nparental education); and Group III, covariates that might be\nendogenous with respect to drug use, including levels of\nconduct problems, deviant peer affiliation, family attention,\nfamily drug use, school adaptation, and four main dimen-\nsions of adolescent behavioral repertoire (other than the reli-\ngious practice dimension). The possibly endogenous\nconstructs include the following: 1) conduct problems,\nassessed by 19 binary items (e.g., damaging other people's\nbelongings), with the Kuder-Richardson 20 estimate of\nCronbach's  (KR ) = 0.83; 2) deviant peer affiliation by a\ntoring using nine binary items such as, \"Are your parents or\nguardians often aware of where you are and what you are\ndoing?\" (KR  = 0.70); 4) family drug use by four binary\nitems on illegal and legal drugs such as, \"During the last 6\nmonths, has any family member (mother, father, or sibling)\nused tobacco (yes or no)?\"; 5) school maladjustment by an\n11-item scale with items such as, \"Do you cut school more\nthan two days a month (true or false)?\" (KR  = 0.73); and\n6) social withdrawal by eight items such as, \"Have you been\nrejected by friends and other young people (yes or no)?\" (KR\n = 0.62). The four other main dimensions of the adolescent\nbehavioral repertoire are a socializing activities dimension\n(e.g., going out on a date), a sports-related activities dimen-\nsion, a home-based activities dimension (e.g., spending time\nwith family), and a gender-associated socialization activities\ndimension (e.g., taking care of children).\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive analyses first were used to characterize youths\nwith and without recent-onset drug experiences in relation to\nthe sociodemographic variables under study. In data anal-\nyses after the first data exploration steps and latent variable\nanalyses, we regressed the occurrence of recent-onset drug\nexperiences on three measures of religiosity (i.e., religious\npractice behavior, religious devotion, and religious affilia-\ntion), with the above-listed covariates held constant. The\nordinary multiple logistic regression model fails to address\nthe interdependent character of the PACARDO samples; for\nexample, the respondents' drug experiences within the same\nschool were more similar than those of students randomly\nsampled from different schools. For this reason, we turned to\na series of generalized linear models with the logistic link\nand a generalized estimating equations approach, building a\nmarginal model to account for the interdependence of\nresponses within the same school (18, 19). Here, an\nexchangeable correlation structure has been assumed as a\nstarting specification for the model, but a robust estimation\napproach guards against misspecification errors in this\nrespect. The strength of association between religiosity and\nrecent-onset drug experience is estimated by an odds ratio;\n95 percent confidence intervals and p values convey the\nprecision of these estimates and strength of the evidence.\nThe generalized linear model (logit link) was implemented\nRESULTS\nschool-attending youths had just had the first chance to try\nalcohol and 1,956 had recent onset of alcohol use.

A sizeable number\nof youths had a past history of the chance to try the drug but\ndid not start actual use of the drug until recently. As depicted\nin table 1, the mean age of these drug-experienced youths\n(and the drug-naive youths) is about 15\u00ad16 years.

Additional subsidiary\nanalyses were conducted with a focus on the youths who had\nexperienced the most recently incident drug experiences\n(i.e., age at assessment equal to the age at first drug exposure\nopportunity). Whereas the resulting estimates are not shown\nin a table, these analyses disclosed a pattern of associations\nlinking religiosity and drug involvement not appreciably\ndifferent from the patterns summarized above.\nDISCUSSION\nThe main findings from this study of religiosity and\nyouthful drug involvement may be summarized as follows:\n1) higher levels of religious practice behaviors are inversely\nassociated with the earliest stages of tobacco and cannabis\nexperiences (i.e., the first chance to try and the first actual\nuse); 2) youths with higher levels of religious devotion are\nless likely to have exposure opportunity to alcohol, as well as\nthe first actual use of alcohol; this is not the case for tobacco\nor for cannabis; 3) as compared with Catholic affiliates,\nbeing a Protestant or a member of some other religion is\ninversely associated with recent-onset experiences of\nalcohol and tobacco; 4) for youths without religious affilia-\ntion, there was an excess occurrence of cannabis use; and 5)\nreligious practice behaviors and levels of religious devotion\nare not associated with a rapid transition from the chance to\ntry alcohol or tobacco to the first use of these drugs. Rather,\nit appears that these facets of religiosity are inversely associ-\nated with youthful tobacco and cannabis involvement by\nvirtue of reduced occurrence of the first chance to try these\ndrugs. This finding is consistent with the idea that religious\npractice behaviors may have protective effects that shield\nyouths from contact with the chance to try tobacco or\ncannabis (i.e., consistent with \"autarcesis\" mechanisms), but\nthese behaviors do not necessarily influence the youth's\ndecision to consume the drugs once the opportunity to do so\nhas occurred (i.e., inconsistent with the separate \"resistance-\nstrengthening\" mechanisms).\nSome potential limitations of this study should be consid-\nered before detailed discussion. First, a major issue involves\nspecification of the survey population in relation to school-\nattending youths. School attendance is determined by several\nfactors, including teenager attributes, household characteris-\ntics, and environmental contexts, some of which also have\nbeen found as correlates for religious engagement as well as\nresult, there are limits when generalizing these findings to\nnonschool samples, such as dropouts, or nonattending\nyouths. In addition, because of cultural, geographic, societal,\nand racial/ethnic compositional differences, we cannot\nassertively generalize these findings outside the region of the\nseven PACARDO countries. Replication elsewhere is\nneeded. We also note that the within-country sample sizes\nwere too small for replication of all these analyses at the\nindividual country level; results on the epidemiology of\nyouthful drug involvement for the individual countries have\nbeen presented elsewhere, although not with a focus on reli-\ngiosity issues (15).\nSecond, an important methodological issue in the present\nstudy is that all the information is assessed by self-report.\nSome studies have shown that self-report of alcohol and\nother drug use from adolescent samples is basically reliable\nnumber of bioassays have been developed to measure drug\ntaking within days or months of actual use (29), but these\ntests do not entrap the time interval of interest here (0\u00ad23\nmonths prior to survey), nor do they reflect exposure to first\nchances to try each drug, which was our primary topic of\ninquiry (i.e., drug opportunity). In addition, these biologic\nmethods may not yet be feasible in large-sample cross-\nnational survey research.\nThird, we held constant most of the prominent peer and\nparental influences on adolescent drug involvement by\nregression modeling. In future research, it should be possible\nto improve the measurements and to hold constant even\nmore suspected confounding variables (e.g., youth confor-\nmity with family rules about behaviors). Finally, perhaps the\nmost serious methodological issues in this study can be\ntraced to its cross-sectional and nonexperimental design,\nwhich creates opportunities for errors in the specification of\ntemporal sequences and which opens up opportunities for\nreciprocal influences. Because of potential reciprocities in\nthese associations, it will be useful to examine these relations\nin the context of longitudinal research with multiple points\nof measurement for drug experiences and multidimensional\nreligiosity. Nonetheless, estimates from cross-sectional and\nretrospective research are invaluable as a step forward\ntoward prospective and longitudinal studies.\nNotwithstanding limitations such as these, our study in\nseven Latin American countries suggests that links between\nreligiosity and drug-related experiences depend upon the\nfacet of religiosity, the drugs under study, and stage of drug\ninvolvement, a pattern of findings consistent with prior work\nin the United States (3, 30). For example, we found that\n\"psychological religiosity\" was inversely associated with the\noccurrence of alcohol initiation and the odds of alcohol\nopportunity, the earliest stage of drug experiences. However,\nfor the behavioral facet of religiosity (religious practice), the\nobserved links are mainly with tobacco and cannabis experi-\nences. The association between religious practice and\nalcohol experiences is quite modest in these study data,\nperhaps because alcoholic beverage consumption is often\nintegrated within family and community life in Latin\nOn this basis, one may surmise that more frequent practice\nof religious behaviors can 1) help shield youths from drug-\nusing youths and 2) bring youths into spheres of adult (e.g.,\npastoral) influences that may serve their own protective\nfunctions (32). Here, also, it is pertinent that the observed\nassociation between religion/religiosity and drug experi-\nences might be due to selective processes associated with\npersonal characteristics (e.g., personality traits) (23, 33).\nTwin studies have suggested that religiosity in the form of\nreligious upbringing and religious practice might shape the\nReligiosity and Adolescent Drug Involvement 1187\ndisplay of personality traits (e.g., sensation seeking) and also\nmight modify liabilities to initiate drug use (34, 35).\nIn sum, there are numerous theories and mechanisms\nposited to explain the presumed beneficial effects of reli-\ngious practice or beliefs on mental health and behavior (36,\n37), but this study's evidence is more consistent with our\nthesis about the \"shielding\" mechanisms of behavioral autar-\ncesis and less consistent with \"resistance-strengthening\"\nmechanisms. If the effects of religiosity are operating via\n\"resistance\" mechanisms at the point of the chance to try\ndrugs, then we should be seeing an inverse association that\nlinks higher levels of religiosity with lower conditional prob-\nability of drug use, once the chance to try drugs has occurred.\nInstead, the pattern of evidence is one of null associations\nwith this conditional probability. Inverse associations, when\nobserved, pertain to the occurrence of the first chance to try\nthe drug (i.e., consistent with \"autarceologic\" shielding).\nIt is possible that the autarceologic functions of religious\npractice behaviors with respect to the first chance to try\ndrugs may be due to time displacement. For example,\nadolescents who attend church-related services on a regular\nbasis may have fewer opportunities to get in touch with peers\noutside this particular social network, because of preoccupa-\ntion with religion-related activities. In this situation, the salu-\ntary effects of religious behaviors may actually be partially\ndue to the mediational effects of attenuated affiliation with\npeers who have started to use drugs and greater participation\nin pro-social behavior. Multiwave longitudinal data are\nneeded to assess these conceptualizations about processes\nand sequences that link the multiple dimensions of religi-\nosity with these earliest stages of drug involvement in\nadolescence.\n"
