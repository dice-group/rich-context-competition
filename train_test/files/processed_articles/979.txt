There was also a long-term\nreduction of vegetable consumption that has now stabilised. Intake of animal foods\nincreased slowly before 1979 and more quickly after the economic reforms occurred.\nWhile the total energy intake of residents has decreased, as has energy expenditure,\nlarge changes in the composition of energy have occurred. The overall proportion of\nenergy from fat increased quickly, reaching an overall average of 27.3% and 32.8% for\nurban residents in 1997. Over a third of all Chinese adults and 60.1% of those in urban\nareas consumed over 30% of their energy from fat in 1997. Large shifts towards\nincreased inactivity at work and leisure occurred. These changes are linked with rapid\nincreases of overweight, obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases (DR-\nNCDs) as well as total mortality for urban residents.\nConclusions: The long-term trend is a shift towards a high-fat, high-energy-density\nand low-fibre diet. The Chinese have entered a new stage of the nutrition transition.\n",

In the past two decades, the annual\ngrowth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) was\nmore than 8%, the highest rate in recent world history1.\nChina has achieved remarkable economic progress and\nhigh levels of education, but a rapid evolution of the\nChinese diet has accompanied these economic shifts and\nrelated social changes. A longer, more detailed history of\nthe Chinese nutrition transition is available2.\nThe classic Chinese diet includes cereals and vegetables\nwith few animal foods. It is a diet that many scholars\nconsider most healthful when adequate levels of intake\nare achieved3. Earlier research by these authors has shown\nrapid changes in the diets and body composition of\neating pattern shifts, intakes of cereals and many lower-fat,\nmixed dishes are being replaced, animal foods are\nbecoming popular, and the consumption of edible oils is\nincreasing quickly. This shift in the composition of diet\nand corresponding body composition has been\naccompanied by many positive and some negative\nchanges. Infectious diseases and hunger, important causes\nof death in the 1950s, no longer affect most of the\npopulation. Although malnutrition and nutrition\ndeficiency diseases are still problems that should not be\noverlooked, the burden is shifting to diet-related, non-\ncommunicable disease (DR-NCD) with a rapid increase in\nthe prevalence of obesity. Fertility and mortality,\nparticularly infant and child mortality, are declining;\nrespiratory diseases are rapidly receding in importance;\nand life expectancy has reached high levels. Heart\ndiseases, cerebrovascular diseases and cancer are now\nthe major sources of mortality.\nThere are five periods of dietary pattern change in China\nthat fit together to mark shifts in the stages of the nutrition\ntransition in China6. This paper shows that China is\ntransforming very rapidly from the pattern of the earliest,\nreceding famine stage, to that of the present, DR-NCD\nfood production was inadequate and low cereal con-\nsumption patterns existed. The second period was a sharp\nthe famine linked with The Great Leap Forward7. The third\ncame after the liberalisation of food production, when the\nannual economic growth rate was over 10%. After this\nrapid growth, further economic improvement led to a shift\nin energy requirements and the structure of the Chinese\ndiet shifted; this is the fifth period presented in Popkin\n*Corresponding author: Email popkin@unc.edu\net al.4 (1993). This paper explores the long-term shifts in\nthe nutrition transition through these stages and the full\nimplications of these changes in the Chinese diet.\nSubjects and methods\nDietary data\nData were obtained from three sources. First, data from the\nwere used to analyse the long-term transitions in dietary\nand nutrition in China.

From the third\nsource, the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS),\ndietary data were collected by a combination of the\nweighing method and three consecutive 24-hour recalls.\nCNNS and CHNS data are used for the short-term analyses.\nPhysical activity data\nThe CHNS collected detailed data on occupation, work\ncharacter, labour force, work time and other items related\nto physical activities. Physical activity was classified into\nthree categories: light, moderate and vigorous11. The\nownership of television (TV) sets was also analysed to\nreflect the shift in physical activities.\nAnthropometric data\nData from both CNNS and CHNS were used; both surveys\nmeasured height and weight12,13.

Diseases are classified\naccording to WHO's International Classification of\nDisease, Injuries, and Causes of Death, version 9 (ICD-9).\nResults\nFood consumption pattern\nThe shift in the Chinese diet follows a classic Westernisa-\ntion pattern. The economic progress, linked in part to\nliberalisation of food production controls and the\nintroduction of a free market for food and food products,\nis linked to these important shifts in diet15. This study\nfocused on shifts in key, separate components of the\nChinese diet.\nCereals\nLong-term. There are really five different periods of\nchange in the past. The first period was between 1949 and\n1957 when food production was inadequate and low\ncereal consumption patterns existed. There is a lack of\ndata on cereal consumption during the second period\nconsumption during the famine linked with The Great\nLeap Forward7. Per capita intake of cereals increased\nisation of food production when the annual economic\ngrowth rate was over 10%, China began to import cereals.\nAs a result, per capita intake of cereals increased by 60 kg\nwithin six years; 10 kg each year, or a 27.4 g increase each\nday. Further economic improvement led to a shift in\nenergy requirements, the structure of the Chinese diet\nshifted, and cereal consumption has declined slowly since\nShort-term. Both CNNS and CHNS data show that the\nintake of cereals decreased considerably during the past\ntwo decades in both urban and rural areas and among all\nincome groups. During the eight-year period from 1989 to\n1997, the total mean intake of cereals decreased by\ndecrease in the low-income group was the highest\nin middle- and high-income groups (86 and\nThe shift away from coarse grain consumption such as\nmillet, sorghum and corn is a key component of this\nchange.

The intake level and the increase in the high-\nincome group were almost three times those in the low-\nincome group.\nComposition of energy and micronutrients in the\ndiet\nLong-term\nTrends of energy intake were similar to those of cereals.\nTotal energy intake increased before 1985; then began to\nin 1992. Among the energy components, there was little\nchange in the proportion of energy from protein, but the\nproportion of protein from animals increased consider-\nably. Only 3.1% of protein came from animal foods in\nremarkably: energy from fat increased twofold (11% vs.\n22%), energy from carbohydrates decreased from 77% to\n66%, and energy from animal foods increased from 4.9% to\nShort-term\nCHNS data show the shift away from carbohydrates to fat\nin the diet.

Large changes in\ntechnology in the workplace and in leisure activities are\nlinked with rapid declines in physical activity. Economic\nactivities are shifting towards the service sector, particu-\nlarly in urban areas16. The proportion of urban adults\nworking in occupations where they participate in vigorous\nactivity patterns has decreased, and increased where the\nactivity pattern is light. In rural areas, however, there has\nbeen a shift towards increased physical activity linked to\nresidents holding multiple jobs and more intensive effort.\nFor rural women, there is a shift towards a larger\nproportion engaged in more energy-intensive work but\nthere are also proportions where light effort is increasing.\nIn contrast, the proportion of rural men engaged in light\nwork effort has decreased slightly.\nTV set ownership increased considerably during this\neight-year period, especially in rural areas and among\nTable 1 Shifts in energy sources for 20- to 45-year-old adults\nPercentage\nof energy\nfrom fat\nPercentage\nof energy\nfrom carbohydrates\nA new stage of the nutrition transition in China 171\nhouseholds owned a TV set. Clearly, TV ownership\nrepresents a major, potential source of inactivity.\nBody composition\nThere has been a profound increase in the body mass\nindex distribution of Chinese adults, particularly at BMI\nobese. These rates increased fourfold to 14.1% and 1.3%,\nrespectively, in 1997. The prevalence was much higher in\nand this was especially true in large cities. In 1992, more\nthan 40% of urban residents in Beijing were overweight\nand obese, which would be a serious public health\nproblem9. In the past 15 years, there has been an increase\nof almost one percentage point per year (0.93) in the\nprevalence rate, equal to an additional 12 million\noverweight and obese cases each year.\nAt the same time, there is still a meaningful proportion\nof adults with low BMI who face chronic undernutrition\n(Table 2). CHNS and CNNS data show that this proportion\ndecreased by 0.4 percentage points yearly during the\nMorbidity\nCHNS blood pressure data show a modest increase in\n30\u00ad65 years. Hypertension is greater among males and\nurban residents, which is not surprising given the greater\nobesity found in urban areas. Interestingly, the prevalence\nof hypertension in males in urban areas decreased slightly\nincreased among all other groups, especially in rural males.\nMortality of degenerative chronic diseases\na rise since then in urban areas. It increased by 34.7 per\nnoteworthy, as it seems to be concurrent with the increase\nin DR-NCDs related to the circulatory system and cancer.\nThe 1999 specific mortality of infection and parasite\ndiseases in rural areas, for example, was one-seventh of\ndiabetes in urban areas increased fivefold in 1999\nDiscussion\nIn the half-century since Chinese independence, there\nhave been five major periods related to the stages of the\nnutrition transition. The country was transformed from\none facing famine and extreme food shortages to one\nwhere the food supply addressed basic needs; food intake\nof key food types (cereals, vegetables, animal foods) as\nwell as total energy intake increased. Continuing the shift\ntowards a reduction of malnutrition between 1985 and\n1990, total energy began to decrease, and food diversity\nand animal food intake increased considerably. After 1990,\nChina entered a later stage of the transition as obesity\nbegan to increase, energy density of the diet increased\nconsiderably, and cereal intake decreased considerably.\nDR-NCDs began to increase rapidly.\nWhat is the basis for stating a new stage of the\nnutrition transition was reached?\nFirst, the overall 1999 death rate among urban residents\nincreased to a higher rate than in the early 1970s primarily\nfrom DR-NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes\nand cancers. Mortality rates of rural residents are still\nimproving (lowering), but we expect these rates will also\nshift upwards in the next several decades. Farmers have\nbecome richer in many regions of the country and the rural\ndiet is following the same shift towards animal products\nthat urban areas followed (i.e. reduced carbohydrate and\nincreased edible oil and total fat). Adult obesity in rural\nareas is beginning to increase. Cancer and cardiovascular\ndisease will soon become the major causes of mortality in\nrural China.\nSecond, China is facing simultaneous challenges of\nmalnutrition and overnutrition. In past decades, the\ngovernment tried its best to solve the malnutrition problem\nand made great progress. However, the prevalence of\nmalnutrition is still very high: 35% of pre-school children\nwere stunted; 20% of pre-school children, 22% of school\nchildren and adolescents, and 8% of adults were suffering\nfrom undernutrition18. On the other hand, the prevalence\nof overweight and obesity has risen to a relatively high\ndegree.

In China, the prevalence of such households was 8%.\nThird, marked shifts in the Chinese diet have been\nshown.
