A study using data from the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Harris,\n2009) found that sexually inexperienced adolescents were\nmorelikelytohavehadsexualintercourse(definedasvaginal\nintercourse) at follow-up if their peers were also sexually\nexperienced (Sieving, Eisenberg, Pettingell, & Skay, 2006).\nFurthermore, a number of studies have shown that various\nphenomena, such as smoking, obesity, alcohol use, loneliness,\ndepression, spread in adult social networks (Cacioppo, Fowler,\nRosenquist,Murabito,Fowler,&Christakis,2010).Thiskindof\nsocial network influence may be even more prominent in ado-\nlescents(Mednick,Christakis,&Fowler,2010)giventheimpact\nof social influence on their behavior. However, no studies have\ndirectly examined the relationship between social networks and\nthedevelopmentofsame-sexattractioninadolescents.Thus,itis\nunclear whether social network influence generalizes to all\naspects of romantic and sexual relationship development or\napplies only to specific behaviors and attitudes.\nMost research on the development of early romantic rela-\ntionships has focused on heterosexual relationships and there-\nfore less is known about the development of same-sex romantic\nor sexual relationships. There is limited evidence that the devel-\nopmentoftheserelationshipsmaybedifferentfromthoseofhet-\nerosexuals (Rotherbam-Borus, Reid, Rosario, & Kasen, 1995).\nIn contrast with strong peer influences on heterosexual activity,\nRotherbam-Borus et al. (1995) found no peer influence on gay\nmaleadolescentsexualbehavior.Fewhavefurtherexaminedthe\ndevelopment of romantic or sexual relationships among same-\nsex individuals; however, there exists a substantial body of lit-\nerature which instead focuses on the origin of same-sex attrac-\ntion.Same-sexorientationhasbeenrelatedtobiologicalfactors,\nincluding genetics and neuroendocrine differences. Sexual ori-\nentation appears to have a genetic influence (Bailey & Bell,\nhave suggested genetic rather than family environment influ-\nences (Bailey & Pillard, 1991; Bailey, Pillard, Neale, & Agyei,\n1993). Additionally, some evidence suggests that male sexual\norientationisinfluencedbyageneontheXchromosome(Hamer,\nalthough other studies have found contradictory evidence\nroendocrine theory proposes that homosexual individuals have\nbeen exposed to atypical levels of hormones in development,\nresulting in sex-atypical neural differentiation (MacCulloch\n& Waddington, 1981). In support of this perspective, LeVay\n(1991) found that for one hypothalamic nucleus, gay men\nwere more similar to heterosexual women than to heterosex-\nual men. This study aims to contribute to the limited body of\nknowledgeexaminingthedevelopmentofromantic orsexual\nrelationships among same-sex individuals, beyond these\nmore extensively studied biological factors.\nIn the present study, we used nationally representative data\nfromAddHealthtoexaminewhethersame-sexromanticattrac-\ntionsspreadthroughsocialnetworks,andwecomparedthis\neffect to the spread of desire to have a romantic relationship and\nself-reportedsexualactivity.Giventhepowerfuleffectsofsocial\ninfluenceacrossotherdomainsofadolescentbehavioranddevel-\nopment, we might expect that adolescents would be more\nlikelytoreporthavinghadaromanticattractiontosomeoneof\nthesamesexiftheirfriends reportedsame-sexattractions.On\ntheotherhand,giventhestronginfluenceofbiologyonsexual\norientation, we would expect any social network influence on\nsame-sexattractiontobeweakerthantheinfluenceongeneral\ndesire for romantic relationships or sexual activity.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThis study draws upon data from the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally repre-\nthe beginning of Wave I, researchers identified an``in-school''\ngroup was then chosen for in-depth ``in-home'' follow-up in\nthese in-home interviews, adolescents completed measures\nabout their social networks and health behavior, from which we\nderivedourinformationaboutromanticandsexualrelationships\nAsian-American (see Table1 for summary statistics).\nThe primary analyses reported here include only Wave I and\nIIdata,sincebyWaveIIItheparticipantswereyoungadultsand\nno longer embedded within their high school networks.

Specifically, subjects were asked: (1)``List\nyourclosestmalefriends.Listyourbestmalefriendfirst,then\nyour next best friend, and so on. Girls may include boys who\nare friends and boyfriends.'' (2) ``List your closest female\nfriends. List your best female friend first, then your next best\nfriend, and so on. Boys may include girls who are friends and\ngirlfriends.''Subjects were also asked to name their siblings.\nThesenameswerethenmatchedtoschoolrosterstolocatethe\nunique identifier for each named friend and sibling who was\nalso in the study.\nSexual activity was assessed by self-report at both waves by\nanswerstothequestion``Haveyoueverhadsexualintercourse?''\nSubjectswereclassifieddichotomouslyassexuallyactiveifthey\nanswered``yes.''Sexual attraction was assessed by self-reported\nanswerstotwoquestions:``Haveyoueverhadaromanticattrac-\ntion to a male?''and``Have you ever had a romantic attraction\nto a female?''Subjects were classified dichotomously as being\nattracted to same-sex partners if they said``yes''to the question\nfor their same sex. The validity of self-report of sexual behavior\nis controversial (Schroder, Carey, & Vanable, 2003), but this\nmeasureisfrequentlyusedinstudiesofadolescentsexualbehav-\nior(Rosenbaum,Rabenhorst,Reddy, Fleming,& Howells,2006).\nAlthough our same-sex attraction measure was somewhat\ncrude, it was highly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.67, SE \u00b1\nWave III assessing identified sexual orientation: ``Please\nchoose the description that best fits how you think about\nyourself: (1) 100 % heterosexual (straight); (2) mostly het-\nerosexual (straight),butsomewhat attractedtopeopleofyour\nown sex; (3) bisexual` that is, attracted to men and women\nequally; (4) mostly homosexual (gay), but somewhat attrac-\nted to people of the opposite sex; (5) 100 % homosexual\n(gay).''Ideally, we would use this measure instead, but sub-\njects were no longer embedded in their high school networks\nat Wave III. The high correlation with the earlier measure\nprovides evidence of predictive validity and suggests that\nsame-sex attraction captured much of the variation in self-\nreported sexual orientation.\nFinally, for comparison to the same-sex attraction measure,\nwealsoevaluatedthedesireforanykindofromanticrelationship\nwithanswerstothequestion``Howmuchwouldyouliketohave\na romantic relationship in the next year? (1) Not at all; (2) Very\nlittle; (3) Somewhat; (4) Quite a bit; (5) Very much.''We cate-\ngorized subjects dichotomously as not desiring a relationship if\nthey responded``Not at all.''This cut-off resulted in a variable\nwithanincidenceof4.7%andthereforeyieldedatestwithsimi-\nlar power to tests with the same-sex attraction measure, which\nhad an incidence of 4.6%.\nStatistical Analyses\nTo establish whether friends exhibited correlated outcomes\nin the networkat a singlepoint in time, we used a permutation\nmethod.Here,wecomparedthePearsoncorrelationinobserved\nvalues between all friendship pairs in the network to the Pear-\nson correlation that resulted when we randomly permuted\nthose values while keeping the network intact. Repeating this\nprocess 1,000 times gave us a distribution of the observed value\nminus the random value, which we used to estimate confidence\nintervals.\nAn association in the behaviors of connected individuals can\nbe attributed to at least three processes: (1) influence, whereby a\nbehavior in one person causes the behavior of others; (2) hom-\nophily, whereby individuals with the same behaviors preferen-\ntiallychooseoneanotherasfriends(Christakis&Fowler,2013);\nor (3) confounding, whereby connected individuals jointly\nexperience contemporaneous exposures (a sex education class\nmay make all students feel more comfortable expressing feel-\nings of same-sex attraction).

These findings suggest that having friends\nwho are sexually active or who are interested in having roman-\ntic relationships may influence an adolescent's own behavior\nand attitudes, but this influence does not extend to the sex of\ntheobjectoftheseaffections.Wetestedavarietyofsocialnet-\nwork models and found no evidence that peers influence the\nlikelihood that adolescents have feelings of romantic attrac-\ntion to same-sex partners. Although we demonstrated adequate\npower to detect network effects on self-reported sexual behav-\nior and desire for a romantic relationship, similar analyses of\npartner preference revealed no signs of peer influence. This\nstudyisthefirsttoexaminepeerinfluenceonsexualattraction\namong both male and female adolescents from a longitudinal\ndataset.These results suggest that changing attitudes towards\nsame-sex behavior in one's peers are unlikely to affect the\nincidenceofsamesexrelationships,andthatadolescentswho\nengage in or desire homosexual relationships have no effect\non the sexual attractions of their friends.\nThe peer influence model suggests that peers significantly\ninfluence the behavior of other peers, including private or non-\npublic behavior, such as sexual activity (Catania et al., 1990;\nFisher, 1988). Social network effects on intimate sex-acts have\nbeen demonstrated in numerous studies of condom use, con-\ntraceptionuse,andsexualriskbehavior(Alietal.,2011;Jackson\net al., 2011). However, this body of research largely examined\nsexualbehaviorbetweenopposite-sexindividuals.Researchhas\nshown that, unlike most heterosexual adolescents, gay male\nadolescents may be more susceptible to peer influence with\nregards to risky sexual behavior (DiClemente, 1991; Walter\net al., 1992). These findings suggest that gay adolescents may\nfollow a different developmental pathway when compared to\ntheir heterosexual peers (Rotherbam-Borus et al., 1995).\nThis differing developmental pathway may, in part, stem\nfrom problems with peer acceptance of differing sexual attrac-\ntions or orientations. Gay adolescents may feel isolated from\ntheir heterosexual peers as they are often subjected to harass-\nment, bullying, teasing, or even violence at school (Bos et al.,\nualminorities,andhomosexualityingeneral,arecomplicatedby\ndeveloping identities of religion, politics, race, and gender\nPrevious research investigating environmental influence\non sexual development or orientation has focused primarily\non parenting or traumatic events in childhood. One prospec-\ntive study found that adult men with a documented history of\nchildhood sexual abuse were more likely than matched con-\ntrolstoreporthavingsame-sexsexualpartners(Wilson&Widom,\n2010), but that was not true for women, and no connections were\nfound between physical abuse or neglect andsexual orientation.\nSimilarly, another study of childhood sexual trauma found that\nthe effect of abuse was greater on the sexual orientation of men\nthan women and that causal relationships between abuse and\nsexual orientation may be bidirectional and differ by sex and\ntype of abuse (Roberts, Glymour, & Koenen, 2013).\nLikewise,inone of the most extensive studiescomparingthe\nchildhood experiences of homosexual and heterosexual adults,\nBell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith (1981) concluded that early\nparenting experiences, whether positive or negative, had very\nlittle direct influence on sexual orientation. Similarly, romantic\nrelationshipsandsexualbehaviorwerenotrelatedtofamilytype\nin a study including adolescents parented by both same-sex and\nopposite-sexcouples(Wainrightetal.,2004).Effectsofparental\nsexualorientationonthatofchildrenalsoappeartobenegligible\nbetween gay fathers and sons (Bailey et al., 1995) and between\nlesbian mothersand their children(Golombok & Tasker,1996).\nBem (1996) suggested that childhood temperament, rather than\nbiological factors, determines preference for sex-typical or sex-\natypical activities, and these factors in turn influence sexual\norientation.Althoughthereissomeevidencethattheacquisition\nof sex-typed behavior is associated with parental socialization,\nthiseffectdiminishesbythepreschoolyears(Fagot&Leinbach,\n1989).Incontrast,parentaltransmissionofnormsandmodeling\nofbehaviorappearstobeanimportantinfluenceonotheraspects\nof sexual behavior (Bonell et al., 2006; Cavazos-Rehg et al.,\nNone of these non-biological explanations have attempted to\nexamine peer influence on sexual orientation or the effect of peer\nnetworks on non-heterosexual romantic relationships, despite\nknowledge that peer networks may be more powerful social\ninfluences on adolescents than their parents. Add Health studies\nhaveshownthatthenumberoffriends,theageandgenderofthose\nfriends, and their academic performance all affect the onset of\nsexual behavior (Cavanagh, 2004). Friends' religiosity also\naffects whether adolescents report having sex and the effect was\nstrongestindensesocialnetworks,wheretheadolescents'friends\ntend to be friends with one another (Adamczyk & Felson, 2006).\nThese studies demonstrate that sexual behavior can spread from\nperson to person and the impact of the network depends on how\ntightly interconnected individuals are. Adolescents who believe\nthat their peers would look favorably on being sexually active\nwere more likely to have casual, non-romantic sex (Manning\net al., 2005). Engaging in oral sex with a partner can even make\none more popular among one's friends (Prinstein et al., 2003).\nRomantic and sexual practices as diverse as contraceptive use,\nanalsex,fertilitydecisions,anddivorceareallstronglyinfluenced\nby the existence of these behaviors within one's network\n(Christakis & Fowler, 2009). By contrast, we have demonstrated\nthat sexual attraction during adolescence does not appear to be a\nbehavior that spreads through peer networks, consistent with\na biological determinant of same- or opposite-sex sexual\nattraction.\nThe current study had several limitations. The way in which\nsexualattractiontoasame-sexromanticpartnerwasdefinedmay\nnot adequately capture sexual orientation since sexual behavior\nand identity are complex constructs that are often incongruent\n(Savin-Williams, 2006). For example, having same-sex attrac-\ntions or engaging in same-sex sexual experiences does not nec-\nessarily mean that an adolescent identifies with a lesbian, gay, or\nbisexualorientation(Blumenfield&Raymond,1993).Likewise,\nadolescents who do identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, or who\nmay be romantically attracted to the same sex, may not have had\nany sexual experience, same-sex, or otherwise (Savin-Williams,\nmore appropriately studied along a spectrum, rather than as a\nstatic anddichotomous``gay''or``straight''construct.Giventhese\nconsiderations, the continuous measure used at Wave III of our\ndata might have been more appropriate to study sexual identity.\nHowever,ourevidenceindicatesthatthesemeasureswerehighly\ncorrelated, suggesting that the measure was a relatively good\nindicator of which youth would identify a same-sex romantic\norientation by early adulthood. Moreover, our measure cap-\ntured adolescents who had same-sex attractions but had not\nidentified with a same-sex orientation. Nonetheless, our results\nshould be interpreted with these limitations in mind. An addi-\ntional limitation of the study was that, despite the nationally\nrepresentative sample, only adolescents on high school rosters\nwere selected, and the initial assessment took place at school.\nTherefore,thefindingsmaynotgeneralizetoyouthswhoarenot\nattending school or chose not to participate.\nAlthoughwefoundevidenceamongyouththatbothsexual\nbehavior and feelings of romantic attraction may spread from\nperson to person, the desire to have a romantic relationship\nwith someone of the same sex (or opposite sex) does not\nappear to spread. The absence of an effect of social networks\non sexual attraction may have important societal implica-\ntions. Such a finding could also function as a``negative con-\ntrol''and hence help address a methodological debate in the\nsocial network literature about whether statistical methods\nfor discerning influence are falsifiable (Christakis & Fowler,\n"
