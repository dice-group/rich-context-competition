Participants were 459 mothers of children attending\nkindergartens, who accepted to participate. The instruments were The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in\nChildhood questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Parenting Stress Index\u00adShort Form, Parenting Stress\nIndex\u00adLong Form, and Escala de Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da Satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o em \u00c1reas da Vida Conjugal. Anxiety, depression, and parenting\nstress were higher in the more symptomatic children and parenting stress was associated with anxiety, depression, and\nmarital satisfaction. Findings support the relevance of children's respiratory-related variables to mothers' psychological,\nparental, and marital functioning.\n",

They are\nassociated with school absenteeism and are a main cause of\nhospital admission in children (Newacheck and Taylor,\nduring the first year of life is a major cause of respiratory\nmorbidity worldwide (Mallol etal., 2010), and childhood\nasthma is the main chronic respiratory disease in childhood\nFurthermore, over recent years, the association between\nday care centers (DCC) attendance and respiratory diseases\nhas been reported.

However, this domain has been under explored\nwhen the child has a respiratory disease. Northey etal.\n(1998) found that in families with childhood asthma, cou-\nples were less satisfied with their marriages than couples\nin the non-asthma group.\nParenting stress can be defined as the aversive psycho-\nlogical reaction to the demands of being a parent and is\nexperienced as negative feelings toward the self or toward\nshown that mothers of children with respiratory diseases\nsuch as asthma have higher levels of parenting stress com-\npared to mothers of healthy children (e.g. Gupta, 2007;\nAlthough literature on the relationship between par-\nenting stress and depression/anxiety in parents of chil-\ndren suffering from respiratory disease was not found,\nstudies with different samples suggest an association\nbetween parenting stress and maternal psychopathology\n(Williford etal., 2007), particularly depression (Ardoino\net\nPositive and supportive marital relationships seem to\nhave a protective role in battling mental health problems\nand promoting parenting efficacy (e.g. Shapiro, 2014).\nAlthough there are studies relating parenting stress to mari-\nWebster-Stratton, 1990), none was found in the context of\nrespiratory disease.\nIt was suggested that experiencing stress associated\nwith life events plays an important role not only in the eti-\nology of several mental and somatic problems (e.g. Glaser\nthe stress experienced in the parenting role (Abidin and\n2014). Nevertheless, other authors concluded that major\nlife events are not predictive of parenting stress (Leigh and\nIn short, within the context of childhood respiratory dis-\nease, there is a general lack of research on the dimensions\nunder study, and furthermore, the relationship of parenting\nstress with the other dimensions and with the disease vari-\nables has either not been addressed or has been insuffi-\nciently explored.\nAlong these lines, this study aimed (1) to analyze the\ndifferences between mothers of children with and with-\nout respiratory health problems in psychological (anxi-\nety/depression), parental (parenting stress and life\nevents), and marital (satisfaction) functioning, based on\nspecific disease variables; (2) to determine which factors\ncontributed to parenting stress considering anxiety,\ndepression, marital satisfaction, life events, and a global\nchild health indicator (GCHI).\nMethod\nParticipants\nThis study is part of a broader longitudinal research project,\nEnvironment and Health in Children Day Care Centers\n(ENVIRH), which set out to study the association between\nindoor air quality in DCC and the health of children attend-\ning them (Ara\u00fajo-Martins etal., 2014). The ENVIRH pro-\nject comprised two phases: (1) evaluation of the building\ncharacteristics, occupant respiratory health, and ventilation\nsurrogates (45 DCCs); (2) evaluation of a DCC subgroup\n(20 DCCs) selected from Phase I through a cluster analysis\n(that considered CO2\nconcentrations, temperature, and\nhumidity at indoors, measured in Phase I) by a hierarchical\nmodel (Ward method). DCCs which were further apart in\nthe dendrogram were chosen. During this phase, and in\nrelation to Time 1, one DCC dropped out of the study. This\nstudy was integrated within the ENVIRH Phase II, with\ntwo evaluation points: Time 1--Spring/Summer and Time\n2--Autumn/Winter. The results presented in this article\nrefer to Time 1.\nThe data of this study were collected in 13 of the 20\nDCCs participating in Phase II (those DCCs who accepted\nthe invitation to participate in this part of the study). The\ninclusion criterion was mothers with a child aged between\nmonths and 5\nyears old without congenital or chronic\npathology (other than respiratory disease).\nThe questionnaires were distributed to the mothers by\nthe DCC staff (education assistants and early childhood\neducators) and were then collected by our team members.\nThe mothers who wished to participate signed an informed\nthe questionnaires and from this number 73 were excluded\ndue to not being mothers.\nThe sample consisted of 459 mothers aged between 19\ndren (children of the mothers characterized above) were\nmostly male (52.1%), only or youngest children in the sib-\nling position (61.8%). Table 1 shows the mothers' socio-\ndemographic characteristics.\nThe majority of mothers had completed higher educa-\ning in common law partnerships (70.1%).\nMeasures\nRespiratory health assessment.To evaluate the children's\nrespiratory health conditions, the Portuguese version of\nThe International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Child-\nhood questionnaire (ISAAC; Rosado-Pinto et\nwas used. This questionnaire collects detailed data on\nwheezing and allergic diseases, absenteeism, respiratory\ninfections, and past medical history, and it also includes\nenvironmental questions.\nPedro et al. 3\nParental assessment.The mothers' psychological (anxiety/\ndepression), parental (parenting stress and life events), and\nmarital (satisfaction) dimensions were evaluated by means of\nthe following instruments: (1) The Hospital Anxiety and\nDepression Scale (HADS; Zigmond and Snaith, 1983; Portu-\nguese version of Pais-Ribeiro etal., 2007) is a self-assessment\ninstrument (in the form of a brief questionnaire). It includes an\nAnxiety subscale (HADS-A) and a Depression subscale\n(HADS-D), each one containing seven items answered on a\n4-point response category (from 0--Most of the time to\n3--Never), so the possible scores range from 0 to 21 for anxi-\nety and 0 to 21 for depression. Higher scores indicate higher\nlevels of anxiety and depression. (2) The Parenting Stress\nIndex\u00adShort Form (PSI-SF;Abidin, 1995; Portuguese version\nof Santos, 2011) is a self-report instrument that measures\nstress associated with the parenting role. The PSI-SF consists\nof 36 statements, with a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 1\n(Totally disagree) to 5 (Totally agree)). This instrument yields\nscores for three subscales (in addition to a Total Stress score):\nParental Distress, Parent\u00adChild Dysfunctional Interaction, and\nDifficult Child. Higher scores indicate higher levels of parent-\ning stress; (3) The Life Stress Scale of the Parenting Stress\nIndex\u00adLong Form (PSI-LF;Abidin, 1995; Portuguese version\nofAbidin and Santos, 2003) aims to assess parents'life events\nover the past 12months and answers are obtained in a dichoto-\nmous format (yes/no) for the occurrence of each life event; (4)\nThe Scale for the Evaluation of Satisfaction in Areas of Cou-\nple Life (originally Escala de Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da Satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o em\n\u00c1reas da Vida Conjugal; EASAVIC, Narciso and Costa, 1996)\nis a 44-item self-report measure answered on a 6-point Likert\nscale (ranging from 1 (Totally unsatisfied) to 6 (Totally satis-\nfied)) that evaluates marital satisfaction. It is organized in two\nsubscales, Marital Functioning (e.g. satisfaction with commu-\nnication and conflict, family functions) and Love (e.g. sexual-\nity, emotional intimacy) and allows scores for each subscale\nand a Total score (used in this study). Higher scores indicate\nhigher levels of marital satisfaction. All the questionnaires\nused in the parental assessment had adequate psychometric\n(validity and reliability) properties.\nSocio-demographic information (e.g. age and child gen-\nder, mothers' age, marital status, employment status, and\nschooling) was also collected.\nProcedure\nResearch protocol was handed out by the DCC staff from\nthe 13 DCCs that agreed to participate. This protocol\nincluded the presentation of the study, instructions, and\nquestionnaires (related to children's respiratory health\nassessment and parental assessment). Mothers who\naccepted to participate signed an informed consent. The\nparticipation was voluntary.\nThe ENVIRH project and this study followed the ethical\nprocedures for research with humans and those proposed\nby the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association\n(Helsinki Declaration) and were approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of the NOVA Medical School.\nStatistical analyses\nStudent's t-tests were used to compare groups as the distribu-\ntions of the variables met the normality assumption. The\nbivariate associations between parenting stress and anxiety,\ndepression, marital satisfaction, and life events were tested\nusing Pearson's correlation coefficient. Multiple linear regres-\nsion analysis was conducted to predict parenting stress, con-\nsidering depression, anxiety, marital satisfaction, life stress,\nand a GCHI as independent variables. The GCHI was created\nto study the child respiratory health variables' influence, cor-\nresponding to the sum of 10 variables (presence of wheezing\nepisodes, presence of respiratory infection episodes, otitis,\nantibiotic intake, going to the doctor because of wheezing\nepisodes, going to the doctor for respiratory infection epi-\nsodes, emergency room attendance due to wheezing episodes,\nemergency room attendance due to respiratory infection epi-\nsodes, missed day care days due to wheezing episodes, and\nmissed day care days due to respiratory infection episodes).\nVariables with a p value <0.25 in the univariate analysis\nwere included in the model. A significance level of =0.05\nwas considered. All data were analyzed using the Statistical\nPackage for the Social Sciences for Windows version 22.0\n(IBM Corp.

Table 6 shows the results obtained.\nWith the exception of the GCHI, all the variables under\nstudy proved to significantly contribute to parenting stress.\nA multiple linear regression analysis was conducted\nconsidering these variables as predictors. The model\nassumptions were verified. The Durbin\u00adWatson value was\n1.95 (the residuals were independent and random) and the\nVIF (variance inflation factor) values were 1.57 for anxi-\nety, 1.67 for depression, and 1.29 for marital satisfaction.\nTable 7 presents the results obtained in this final model,\nTable 2.

The results showed that mothers' levels of depres-\nsion and anxiety were higher in those whose children had\nmore wheezing episodes (although the anxiety result was\nonly marginally significant), and the same trend was observed\nin those whose children took antibiotics more frequently.\nThese findings are consistent with previous research, as sev-\neral authors stated that children's health problems (not res-\npiratoryhealthproblems)arerelatedtomothers'psychological\nfunctioning and to higher levels of anxiety and depression\nalso the case for mothers whose children have a respiratory\nThe results also point to more anxious and depressive\nsymptomatology in mothers whose children needed to go to\nthe emergency room due to wheezing episodes and higher\nlevels of anxiety symptoms in mothers whose children needed\nto go to the emergency room due to respiratory infections.\nThe findings for depression are in line with the study by\nBartlett etal. (2001), who found higher levels of depression\nin mothers whose children had higher rates of emergency\nroom attendance due to respiratory problems. As for anxiety,\nmothers with higher levels of anxiety possibly have a greater\nneed to take their children to the emergency room not only\ndue to the severity of the disease itself, but mainly because\nthey feel more insecure and frightened by the situation.\nTable 4. Emergency room attendance (number of times) for wheezing episodes.\nNone\nOne or more\nt p\nParenting stress\nTable 5. Antibiotic intake.\nNone\nOne or more\nt p\nParenting stress\n6 Health Psychology Open \nResults also showed that mothers of children with one or\nmore episodes treated with antibiotic intake have higher\nscores in the parental distress subscale and in the parenting\nstress total score. These results are in line with those of\nCarotenuto et\nal. (2013), who reported higher parenting\nstress in the mothers of children with a chronic disease.\nResults showed no variations in marital satisfaction as a\nfunction of the respiratory disease variables, thus differing\nfrom the study by Northey etal. (1998), which suggested\nthat couples with a child with asthma were less satisfied\nwith their marriages than non-asthma couples. Further\nresearch is needed concerning the association between mar-\nital satisfaction and respiratory disease.\nAnother goal of this study was to determine whether spe-\ncific psychological, parental, marital, and disease variables\nwere associated with parenting stress.The final model showed\nthat only anxiety, depression, and marital satisfaction contrib-\nuted to parenting stress. Higher levels of anxiety and depres-\nsion and lower levels of marital satisfaction were associated\nwith higher levels of parenting stress. These results are con-\nsistent with the results of other studies in relation to depres-\nsion and anxiety (Leigh and Milgrom, 2008; Lewin etal.,\nalso pointed to an influence of these dimensions on parenting\nstress. However, neither of these studies was related to res-\npiratory diseases. There are a few studies linking parenting\nstress to marital satisfaction. Nevertheless, the findings of this\nstudy follow the same direction as those obtained by other\n2014), who reported an inverse relationship between parent-\ning stress and marital satisfaction, but once again, the target\nsamples were not related to respiratory disease.\nIn this study, life events were not found to be related to\nparenting stress. This result contradicts the perspective of\ndifferent authors (e.g. Abidin, 1995; Ostberg and Hagekull,\n2000) but is in line with the study by Leigh and Milgrom\n(2008), which emphasized that major life events are not\npredictive of parenting stress.\nThe results showed that respiratory disease (GCHI) did\nnot contribute to parenting stress. One possible explanation\ncould be seasonal variations concerning respiratory disease.\nIn fact, the data collection was performed in the Spring/\nSummer period, which is a season during which the incidence\nof respiratory infections is low (Boloursaz etal., 2013).\nConclusion\nThe results indicated that among the dimensions under\nstudy, only anxiety, depression, and parenting stress varied\non the basis of child wheezing outcomes and antibiotic\nintake. This variation was more extensive for psychological\ndimensions (anxiety/depression). With regard to the associ-\nated factors of parenting stress, anxiety, depression, and\nmarital satisfaction contributed to parenting stress. The\nabsence of an association between parenting stress and res-\npiratory health variables deserves further research.\nAmong the limitations of this study, the fact that data\ncollection took place in a period with a low incidence of\nrespiratory infections should be noted. Nevertheless, this\nstudy is part of a broader research project that intends to\ncompare results from two different seasons (longitudinal\nstudy). Data corresponding to the Autumn/Winter season\nwill be analyzed at a later stage in the near future.\nAdditionally, although all mothers were invited to par-\nticipate, there is still a risk for selection bias, as it is not\npossible to know whether mothers who agreed to partici-\npate and those who did not accepted had the same charac-\nteristics (e.g. the latter could be more or less stressed).\nMothers may benefit from being enrolled in early pre-\nventive intervention programs that will help them adjust to\nmotherhood, in reducing stress and anxiety and this will\ncontribute to promote child health and well-being.\nWe hope that future research will provide useful answers\nto remaining questions about parenting stress and the pro-\ncesses that link it to children's health and well-being. Such\nresearch will hopefully give health care professionals a\nclearer understanding of the importance of the psychosocial\nand health factors involved when taking care of children\nwith respiratory disease.\n"
