    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nResearch suggests that children of prisoners have an increased risk for behavioural\nand emotional problems. However, in a resilience approach, one should expect\nheterogeneous outcomes and thus apply a contextualized perspective. As this is\nrarely acknowledged in empirical research, the present study sought to fill this gap\nusing data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study on 801 children\nof imprisoned fathers. We explored the extent to which cumulative family risks\nmeasured during the first year of life (e.g., poverty and mental health problems)\npredicted behavioural outcomes at age 9 and whether potentially protective\naspects of family functioning moderated the impact of these risk factors.\nCumulative risk significantly predicted behavioural outcomes, but the associations\nwere weak. No strong evidence of moderation was found. At low risk, mother\u00adchild\ncloseness moderated behavioural outcomes. There was also some evidence of\nmoderation by accumulated protective factors. Potential implications for policy\nand practice and challenges for further research are discussed.\n",

In the USA, the nation with\nthe highest rate of imprisonment in the world, 2.3% of children have an impris-\noned parent at any one time (Glaze & Maruschak, 2008). African-American and\nsocially excluded families are disproportionately affected (Wildeman, 2009).\nMuch has been written about the negative impact of imprisonment on children,\nwith the link to filial anti-social behaviour among the most robust associations\nafter controlling for other factors (e.g., Murray, Farrington, & Sekol, 2012).\n\u00a9 2015 The Author(s).

For example, a qualitative study by Lanskey et al. (2014)\nimplicated changes to home and school environments, perceptions of the past\nand future and ability to adapt to the difficulties presented by paternal imprison-\nment as factors influencing children's well-being (e.g., Lanskey, L\u00f6sel, Markson, &\nSouza, 2014), suggesting that such factors need to be taken into account when\nstriving to understand developmental processes (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Using\ndevelopmental psychopathology as the conceptual framework and adopting a\nresilience perspective, we argue that the impact of paternal imprisonment on\nchildren should be studied using a contextualized approach. Such research has\nimplications for how to effectively support the positive adaptation of children\nliving with this type of adversity.\nDevelopmental psychopathology proposes an\"organizational view of devel-\nopment in which multiple factors, or levels of a given factor, are considered in\nthe context of one another, rather than in isolation\"(Blandon, Calkins, Grimm,\nKeane, & O'Brien, 2010, p. 737). Accordingly, the context is a crucially important\nconsideration (Cummings, Davies, & Campbell, 2000; Motti-Stefanidi, Asendorpf,\nRutter, 2012) and relates to \"dynamic processes of `psychological functioning'\nthat foster greater positive and reduced negative outcomes in the face of relative\nadversity, both at the present time and in the future\" (Cummings et al., 2000,\np. 146). Resilience is influenced by dynamic, multi-level, social, psychological and\nbiological processes that can vary across individuals, problem types, time and\n2012). Resilience has been defined and operationalized in different ways (e.g.,\nRutter, 1993). In the current study, we defined resilience as the absence of prob-\nlems in a high-risk sample (Rutter, 1990).\nMultiple contextual risk factors can have a negative influence on children's\ndevelopment (Flouri, 2008), including low parental educational achievement,\nparental mental illness, poverty, neighbourhood factors and parental substance\nliving with additional stressors that exacerbate the negative experience of pater-\nnal imprisonment (e.g., Geller, Garfinkel, Cooper, & Mincy, 2009).They are likely\nto be economically deprived, socially excluded and lacking support. They may\nalso be vulnerable to stigmatization as a result of the imprisonment. For these\nreasons, prisoners' children are a unique at-risk group. These risk factors may\naffect development indirectly through the parents' well-being and parenting\nbehaviour (Luthar, 1999) or directly through bullying and victimization. Risk\nfactors have been shown to have a cumulative, dose\u00adresponse relationship to\nchildren's behavioural outcomes (Atzaba-Poria, Pike, & Deater-Deckard, 2004;\nDeater-Deckard, Dodge, Bates, & Pettit, 1998; Van der Laan,Veenstra, Bogaerts,\nVerhulst, & Ormel, 2010) although cumulative contextual risk is an under-re-\nsearched topic and has been the focus of conceptual debate (Flouri, 2008; L\u00f6sel\nFamily relationships also have a significant impact on children's develop-\nment. Lamb (2012) identified the relationships between children and parents/\nsignificant others and between parents/significant others as the most impor-\ntant social influences and attachment theory provides a theoretical explanation\nfor their significance (e.g., Bowlby, 1953). Responsive and supportive parent-\ning, accepting family environments and close parent\u00adchild relationships have\nbeen associated with behavioural competence (Collins, Harris, & Susman, 1995;\nMasten et al., 1999). Lamb (2012) noted that the security associated with attach-\nment relationships may mediate the effect of parent\u00adchild relationships on child\nadjustment. Parental relationship conflict and harmony may affect children's\nemotional security and adjustment (e.g., Cummings et al., 2000).\nAccordingly, positive and supportive family relationships can have protective\nor buffering effects for children in contexts of parental divorce, abuse, depriva-\ntion and cumulative stress (e.g., Masten & Powell, 2003; Masten & Shaffer, 2006;\n1990). This suggests that they are important for the development of resilience\nparents and children are associated with positive child behavioural outcomes\nin high-risk environments (e.g., Cummings et al., 2000). Similarly, emotionally\nresponsive caregiving has been shown to moderate the impact of social and\neconomic deprivation, high stress and abusive family relationships on broadly\ndefined measures of positive behavioural, social and emotional functioning\nThe buffering effects of family variables have been found to vary by level of\nrisk. For example, marital relationship quality protected against the emergence\nof antisocial behaviour in boys only in low risk conditions (Vanderbilt-Adriance\n& Shaw, 2008). Supportive family relationships moderated the association\nbetween exposure to violence, poverty and everyday stressors and internaliz-\ning behaviour for African-American children at low but not high levels of risk\n(Li, Nussbaum, & Maryse, 2007). This pattern was termed \"overwhelming-risk\"\nby Li et al. (p. 30) after Luthar, Cicchetti, and Becker's (2000)\"protective-reactive\"\n(p. 547) classification of moderation effects because protective influences were\noverwhelmed by risk factors. This concept is important insofar as it relativizes\ntoo optimistic views on resilience in cases where numerous stressors accumulate\nand leave not much\"space\"for protective influences (L\u00f6sel & Bender, 2003).\nTheory and empirical evidence on developmental psychopathology, resil-\nience and family relationships suggest that paternal imprisonment may be\nexperienced by children in nuanced ways but prisoners' children have rarely\nbeen studied from that perspective.There have been no published prospective\nlongitudinal studies on the impact of cumulative family risks and protective\nfactors on behavioural outcomes with a specific focus on prisoners' children.\nTherefore, we integrated contextual influences to understand whether cumu-\nlative family risk factors (e.g., poverty, parental mental health problems) during\nthe first year of life have a dose\u00adresponse relationship to behavioural outcomes\nfor male prisoners' children at age 9. In addition, we examined whether sup-\nport, shared responsibility in the mother\u00adfather relationship and close mother\u00ad\nchild relationships moderated the impact of cumulative risk on behavioural\noutcomes, thereby demonstrating supportive processes or resilience.The results\ncould highlight the potential value of considering the impact of contextual\nrisks as well as existing family strengths in policy and practice approaches to\nimproving behavioural outcomes for prisoners' children.\nMethod\nDesign and sample\nThe data were obtained in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing (FFCW)\nstudy, which is following a stratified sample of almost 5000 children born\nTeitler, Garfinkel, & McLanahan, 2001). Both parents gave informed consent at\nthe baseline survey.The mother and father were the main respondents in each\nwave (birth, years 1, 3, 5 and 9) and other informants, such as the focal child,\nprimary caregivers and teachers, were interviewed in later waves. The present\nanalyses used mother, father and child reported data from the birth (baseline),\nyear one, age 3 and age 9 surveys.\nWe analysed a subsample of 801 children who had experienced paternal\nimprisonment between the calendar year of the age 3 survey and the date of\nthe age 5 survey. Girls represented 43.2% of the sample. At baseline, mothers\nInstruments\nCumulative risk\nTen variables from the baseline and year one surveys were used to measure risk\nfactors in the families' circumstances. The mothers' and fathers' highest level of\neducation was indicated on the scale: 1 = graduate or professional school, 2 = col-\nlegeortechnical,3=highschoolorequivalentor4=lessthanhighschool.Parents'\ndepression was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-\nShortForm(CIDI-SF;Kessleretal.,1998).Diagnosticcriteriaweremetifrespondents\nreportedfeelingdepressedorthattheyhadlostinterestinpleasurableactivitiesfor\nat least half the day for the majority of days in a consecutive 2-week period in the\nlast 12 months.The mothers' reports of household income were used to calculate\nthe ratio of income to poverty thresholds as defined by the US Census Bureau.The\nmothers also described the family structure on the scale: 1 = married, 2 = cohabit-\ning, 3 = visiting, 4 = friends, 5 = hardly talk, 6 = never talk and 7 = father unknown.\nIn addition, they rated the safety of the streets around their home at night on a\nscale of 1 = \"very safe\"to 4 = \"very unsafe\". Both parents were asked: \"In the past\nmonth, how many days did you have five or more drinks in one day?\"and\"In the\npast month did you use cocaine, crack, speed, LSD or heroin or any other kind of\nharddrug?\"Alcoholanddrugitemswerecombinedtoindicateproblematicalcohol\nor drug use. Fathers reported whether they had done paid work in the previous\nweek. Variables were transformed into binary coded risk present/absent variables\nto calculate the total cumulative risk for each family.Table 1 shows each indicator,\nthedatacollectionwave,theriskcriterionthatwasusedandthepercentageofthe\nsample reaching the risk threshold.\nFamily moderators (protective factors)\nThe measures of support, shared responsibility and mother\u00adchild closeness that\nwere developed in the FFCW study were used as family moderators (protective\nfactors).\nSupport\nAt year three, mothers rated six items about support in their relationship with\nthe father on a scale of 1 = \"never\" to 3 = \"often\". Mothers indicated whether\nthe father \"is fair and willing to compromise when you have a disagreement\",\n\"expresses affection or love for you\", \"insults or criticises your ideas\" (reverse\nTable 1 Risk indicators for the cumulative risk measure\nIndicator Time Risk defined by\nPercent of sample\nreaching risk threshold\nMother education Baseline < high school education 45.8\nFather education Baseline < high school education 49.5\nMother depression Year one Meets depression criteria 17.1\nFather depression Year one Meets depression criteria 11.6\nPoverty (mother report) Baseline Ratio of total household income\nto official poverty threshold\nParents relationship\n(mother report)\nBaseline Parents hardly talk, never talk or\nfather unknown\nSafe streets (mother report) Baseline Streets are unsafe or very unsafe 20.6\nMother alcohol and drugs Year one Consumed 5+ alcoholic drinks\non 1+ days in the past month\nUsed hard drugs in the last\nmonth\nFather alcohol and drugs Year one Consumed 5+ alcoholic drinks\non 1+ days in the past month\nUsed hard drugs in the last\nmonth\nFather employment Baseline No paid work in the last week 37.3\ncoded),\"encourages you to do things that are important to you\",\"listens when\nyou need someone to talk to\"and\"really understands your hurts and joys\". Scores\nranged from 6 to 18. The reliability of the scale was  = .86.\nShared responsibility\nAlso at year three, mothers rated four items about shared responsibility with the\nchild's father on the scale of 1 =\"never\"to 4 =\"always\":\"How often does father\nlook after child when you need to do things?\",\"How often does he run errands\nfor you?\", \"How often does he fix things around your home?\" and \"How often\ndoes he take child places he/she needs to go?\"Scores ranged from 4 to 16. The\nreliability of the scale was  = .91.\nMother\u00adchild closeness\nThe children reported at year nine how close they felt to their mothers. They\nresponded on a scale of 0 =\"never\"to 3 =\"always\"to the four statements:\"Your\nmom talks over important decisions with you\", \"Your mom listens to your side\nof an argument\", \"Your mom spends enough time with you\" and \"Your mom\nmisses events or activities that are important to you\" (reverse scored). Scores\nranged from 0 to 12. The reliability of the items was  = .35. The low reliability\ncould reflect the heterogeneous behaviours addressed and the focus on both\nfacts and feelings. The items were combined on the basis of face validity.\nThe reliabilities of the family moderators with our subsample were similar\nto those in the whole study sample ( = .86 for support,  = .89 for shared\nresponsibility and  = .38 for mother\u00adchild closeness). To create a measure of\naccumulated protective factors support, shared responsibility and mother\u00adchild\ncloseness total scores were z transformed and summed.\nChild behaviour outcomes\nWe used the mothers' year nine reports on the Child Behavior Checklist for ages\n6\u00ad18 (CBCL; Achenbach, 1992) to measure the children's behavioural difficulties.\nFollowing Turney and Wildeman (2015), we used the 67 available items from\nthe internalizing and externalizing behaviour subscales. Items were scored from\n1 =\"not true\"to 3 =\"very true/often true\". Behavioural difficulties scores ranged\nfrom 67 to 201.The reliability of the scale was  = .96. In addition, the children's\nyear nine reports on 14 items from the internalizing and externalizing behav-\niour subscales of the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ; e.g., Marsh, Relich, &\nSmith, 1981) were used.The children responded 0 =\"not at all true\"to 3 =\"very\ntrue\"to statements such as\"I feel angry when I have trouble learning something\",\n\"I often feel lonely\" and \"I worry about having someone to play with\". Scores\nranged from 0 to 42. The reliability of the scale was  = .84. We combined the\nCBCL and SDQ scores to provide a more comprehensive outcome measure that\nreflected responses from different informants. The CBCL and SDQ scores were\nz transformed and the mean of the scores was calculated.\nData analysis\nData on the cumulative risk indicators and moderator variables were missing\nat random (MAR; Little, 1988) and were imputed using SPSS version 21.1 Pooled\nestimates from 40 multiple imputed datasets were used. Individual cumula-\ntive risk and protective factor items were imputed and the total scores were\ncalculated after the imputation. Although recommended (e.g., Allison, 2002),\ninteraction terms were not included in the imputation model because this would\nhave excluded data on individual risk items. A comparison of the different meth-\nods revealed similar results. Table 2 shows the means and standard deviations\nof total cumulative risk and moderator variables before and after imputation.\nOutcome data were not imputed.\nBivariate correlations between cumulative risk, behavioural outcomes and\nmoderator variables were examined. To investigate moderator effects, we car-\nried out hierarchical multiple regression analyses. The potential protective\nfactors were mean-centered before the analysis. Total cumulative risk was first\nentered into the regression model, then the moderator variable and finally the\nproduct term of cumulative risk and the moderator (Hayes, 2013).\nResults\nDescriptive and bivariate analyses\nAs expected, cumulative risk was negatively correlated with the potential\nfamily protective factors and the latter were negatively correlated with the child\nbehaviour outcomes (Table 3). Cumulative risk significantly predicted behav-\n1 On most variables, no more than 15% of the data were missing. Exceptions were father\nTable 2 Original and imputed descriptive statistics for cumulative risk and moderator\nvariables\nOriginal Mean (SD) Imputed Mean (SD)\nInteractionanalyses:There was statistically significant evidence of moderation\nby mother\u00adchild closeness for the SDQ and combined outcome measures, and\nby accumulated protective factors for the combined outcome, although the\neffects were weak. The results are presented in Table 4.\nTo plot the statistically significant interactions, values one SD below and\nabove the mean for cumulative risk (1.43 and 4.59, respectively) and the moder-\nators were used to represent X and M in the regression equation. For all models,\nproblem scores on the outcome measures were lowest when the moderator\nwas \"high\" and cumulative risk was \"low\". To illustrate, behaviour was more\npositive for children with\"low\"cumulative risk and\"high\"mother\u00adchild close-\nness than for children with\"low\"cumulative risk and\"low\"mother\u00adchild close-\nness. However, at \"high\" cumulative risk, there was no difference in behaviour\nbetween children with\"low\"and\"high\"mother\u00adchild closeness scores (Figures\n1 and 2). The same pattern was observed with accumulated protective factors\nand the combined behaviour outcome (Figure 3).\nDiscussion\nThis study examined the importance of family context for prisoners' children's\nbehavioural development. It investigated whether cumulative risks around the\nfirst year of life predicted behavioural outcomes in middle childhood. In a more\ndifferentiated approach, it also investigated whether within-family factors had\na protective function and contributed to resilience. In particular, supportive\nparental relationships, shared responsibility and mother\u00adchild closeness were\nconsidered as potential moderators of the relationship between cumulative\nrisks and behavioural outcomes. Cumulative risk was significantly and posi-\ntively associated with behavioural difficulties, but the effect sizes were small.\nResults were clearest for the combined behavioural outcome measure but no\nstrong support for moderation was found. Although statistically significant,\nthe moderation by mother\u00adchild closeness for child reported and combined\nbehavioural adjustment measures was weak. Support and shared responsibil-\nity did not moderate behavioural outcomes. Weak evidence of moderation by\naccumulated protective factors was also found for mother and child combined\nreports. The data showed that high levels of mother\u00adchild closeness were pro-\ntective against problem behaviour in the context of low cumulative risk. Thus,\nTable 3 Cumulative risk correlated with behavioural outcomes and family moderators\n*p < .05, * *p < .01, two-tailed, n = 531\u00ad801, variation due to missing data on outcome variables, MI = mother\ninformant, CI = child informant.\nFamily moderators Cumulative risk CBCL (MI) SDQ (CI) CBCL and SDQ combined\nfor children affected by paternal imprisonment in low family risk environments,\nthe presence of positive family relationships appeared to provide a protective\neffect that somewhat diminished the negative impact of risk on positive behav-\nioural development. The findings point to protective effects of mother\u00adchild\nrelationships as well as the possible value of accumulated family relationship\nfactors. There were no protective effects at high levels of cumulative risk.\nAlthough our bivariate correlations were modest, the finding that cumula-\ntive risk predicted children's later behavioural outcomes is in agreement with\nresults from general population samples (e.g., Deater-Deckard et al., 1998; Van\nder Laan et al., 2010). The findings support the notion that prisoners' children\nare not a homogeneous group and that their outcomes are influenced by other\nrisk factors beyond parental imprisonment.This finding suggests dose\u00adresponse\neffects of adversity exposure. Moderation by family relationship factors on\nbehaviour problems at lower levels of cumulative risk has also been reported in\nother studies (e.g., Li et al., 2007;Vanderbilt-Adriance & Shaw, 2008) highlighting\nthe importance of these protective factors in certain risk contexts.

Even accumulated potentially protective fac-\ntors did not have a substantial impact. Such findings are somewhat inconsistent\nwith evidence regarding protective factors and resilience in children experi-\nencing other adversities such as parental divorce, abuse and socioeconomic\nare several possible reasons for this divergence. The correlations between the\nrisk factors in early childhood and the child behaviour outcomes were rather\nlow, so there was not much`space'for buffering or moderating effects. Although\nwe included important risk factors such as poverty, low parental education,\nsubstance misuse and mental health problems in our cumulative index, its pre-\ndictive validity was small. This is in agreement with risk assessment research\nshowing low correlations between very early risk factors and behavioural out-\ncomes after longer time intervals (e.g., Hawkins et al., 1998; L\u00f6sel & Bender,\n2006). Such findings illustrate important processes of flexibility and multifinality\nin behavioural development. Although studying development over the longer\nterm is essential for understanding dynamic processes of resilience (Luthar et\nal., 2000), the long period of time covered from child birth to age 9 may partially\nexplain the weak associations. Dose\u00adresponse effects that diminish over time\nhave been explained in terms of recovery from adversity (e.g., Masten & Osofsky,\n2010). Of the moderators we analysed, child-reported mother\u00adchild closeness\nat year nine provided the strongest associations with outcomes, suggesting\nFigure 3 Graph showing interaction among cumulative risk, accumulated protective\nfactors and CBCL and SDQ combined outcome\nthat protective factors measured temporally closer to outcomes have more\ninfluence than those measured temporally further away. This finding fits with\nthe above-mentioned interpretations.\nThe absence of strong protective influences of functional family factors may\nalso be indicative of Luthar et al.'s (2000)\"protective-reactive\"and Li et al.'s (2007)\n\"overwhelming risk pattern\". In our high-risk sample with relatively low variabil-\nity in risk, one can assume that there were too many problems for substantial\nprotective influences to be identified, even at lower levels of risk, and therefore\nany protective influences were overwhelmed by risk factors. Prisoners' families\nare likely to have many problems and be among the most disadvantaged groups\nin society. In our sample, around half the families reached the risk thresholds\nfor the parents' education and poverty indicators. Therefore, low risk in our\nsample is not comparable to low risk in a\"normal\"population sample. Even low\nrisk families are at rather high risk for child developmental problems, but are at\nlower risk in comparison to others in the sample. The difficulties in identifying\nprotective effects with high-risk samples have been noted by other researchers\nSome limitations to this study should be mentioned. We did not examine\npotentially protective individual characteristics (Li et al., 2007; Masten & Powell,\nspecificity of risks and outcomes (Masten & Powell, 2003), non-linear relation-\nships or the stability of resilience processes (Luthar et al., 2000). Another limit is\nour main reliance on information from the mothers because not enough of the\nfathers provided data consistently. As in other areas of research, perspectives\nof different family members are also highly important for studies on paren-\ntal imprisonment (Harris, Graham, & Carpenter, 2010; Souza, L\u00f6sel, Markson, &\nLanskey, 2013). Because of non-random attrition, families affected by impris-\nonment may be underrepresented in later study waves which limit the gener-\nalizability of the findings (Schwartz-Soicher, Geller, & Garfinkel, 2011). It should\nalso be mentioned that there is no established method for creating a cumulative\nrisk index and no agreement about what risk factors to include. Perhaps a more\ndomain-specific and theory-based combination of risks may reveal stronger\neffects (e.g., Flouri, 2008). Finally, our investigation of protective factors was\nlimited to using short scales and the reliability of the mother\u00adchild closeness\nmeasure was low, although it possessed face validity (e.g., Card & Barnett, 2015).\nNotwithstanding these limitations, this study represented a timely investi-\ngation of the under-researched topics of cumulative risk and protection with\na large number of hard-to-reach families experiencing the specific adversity\nof paternal imprisonment. In principle, the findings support a cumulative risk\nand protective factors approach for the study of this group. They suggest that\nprotective processes may operate in areas that are possible to target through\nsupport and intervention. A tentative policy implication is that better behav-\nioural outcomes for prisoners' children may be achieved if family risk factors are\nreduced and protective factors are increased. However, more research is needed\nto explore processes of risk and resilience in prisoners' families. For example, the\ninteraction between biological and social factors in relation to protective effects\nfor behavioural development has been studied very little (L\u00f6sel & Bender, 2003).\nAlthough the findings do not strongly inform our understanding of contex-\ntual family influences on resilience processes in children of prisoners, in our high\nrisk sample small effects are worth noting; they do not suggest that contextual\nenvironments do not matter. Instead, they underscore how difficult it is to study\nprisoners' families. An additional important aim for research remains to identify\neffective policy to support the positive development of children experiencing\npaternal imprisonment in cases where the level of risks is very high and may\noverwhelm\"natural\"protective resources.This relates to several areas of further\nstudy: examining temporal relationships among risks, protective influences and\noutcomes to establish whether there are\"sensitive periods\"at which effects can\nbe revealed; studying individual characteristics of prisoners' children to identify\nprotective resources; and integrating protective factors from different domains\nto reveal effects in conditions of high adversity.\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council.The authors thank\nthe organizers of the Fragile Families and ChildWellbeing Study Summer DataWorkshop\n2013 for their introduction to the data-set and Steve Lain\u00e9 for his technical support.\nReferences\nBurlington, VT: University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry.\nAllison, P.
