Because this is also a time in the life course when women's labor force participation peaks, many women\nfaced with caregiving demands have to decide how to balance them with their employment. In this study we use the\nNational Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of Mature Women to examine the causal relationship between employment\nand caring for an ill or disabled friend or relative over a three-year period. We find that employment does not affect\nwhether or not women start caregiving, but that women who do start are more likely to reduce employment hours or\nstop work. Thus, the causal relationship between employment and caregiving in late midlife is largely unidirec-\ntional, with women reducing hours to meet caregiving demands.\nDECISIONS about care of an ill or disabled friend or\nfamily member often fall on the shoulders of working\nwomen. Increases in the U.S. population aged 65 or older\nand improvements in life expectancy have broadened the\ndemand for and incidence of caregiving (Coward, Home,\nmajority of this care is done by family members, and more\noften than not by women (Coward, 1987; Dwyer and\nthough only a small percentage of women may be caregiv-\ning at any single point in time (Rosenthal, Matthews, and\nindicate that over half of all women provide care for some-\none who is ill or disabled at some point in the life course\n(Robison, Moen, and Dempster-McClain, 1995). Over the\ncourse of the 20th century, more recent cohorts of women\nhave been more likely than earlier cohorts to be involved in\nboth caregiving and employment and, for many, caregiving\nfalls during the peak employment years of 35-64 (Moen,\nRobison, and Fields, 1994). The timing suggests that, for\nmany, decisions about caregiving are closely entwined with\ndecisions about employment.\nThe primary focus of this study is on how caregiving and\nemployment affect one another. Previous research has fo-\ncused on either side of the causal relationship, but has sel-\ndom been able to examine how the two are interrelated.\nOne of the more frequent questions has been whether em-\nployment reduces one's ability to provide care for someone\nwho is ill or disabled or to provide other types of support.\nThis question is particularly important because if employ-\nment does reduce men's or women's ability to provide care,\nit suggests that increases in labor force participation may\nhave broad implications for the care of the sick or elderly.\nAnswers have been inconsistent. Some early research sug-\ngested that those who are employed provide less care\nLang and Brody, 1983), but more recent studies have found\nfew differences in the amount of care and support provided\nemployed versus nonemployed persons (Matthews, Werk-\nSpitze and Logan, 1991; Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl,\n1987). However, there is evidence suggesting that employ-\nment may reduce one's ability to provide more extensive\ntypes of care. For example, Ruhm (1996) found that mar-\nried persons who provide more than 10 hours of caregiving\nper week are less likely to be employed than those who\nprovide no care, but that there are no such differences\namong those providing fewer hours of care. Similarly,\nMatthews and colleagues (1989) also found that for most\ntypes of support, there were no differences in providing\ncare between employed and nonemployed sisters, but that\nnonemployed sisters did provide more help for parents who\nwere in the worst health. Thus, employment status does ap-\npear to be related to more extensive levels of care, but it is\nstill not clear whether this is because nonemployed women\nare more likely to provide care or because once care is\nstarted, women stop employment.\nIndeed, studies have also investigated whether caregiv-\ning affects employment. Estimates of the number of care-\ngivers who leave the labor force range from around 9 to 25\nCafferata, and Sangl, 1987). Women, particularly when\ncaring for elderly parents, are more likely to leave the labor\nforce than men (Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987). Studies\nof workers suggest that nearly 10 percent consider quitting\nwork to meet caregiving needs (Gibeau and Anastas, 1989;\nScharlach and Boyd, 1989). Still another strategy is to re-\nduce work hours. National data on caregivers suggest that\nthis may be slightly more common than dropping out of the\nlabor force, with 27 percent of employed caregivers reduc-\ning their work hours and 19 percent taking some time off\nwork without pay (Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987).\nGiven that resumption of full-time employment after an\nexit for family reasons is related to lower wages (Wenk and\nRosenfeld, 1992), a greater likelihood of being located in a\nbenefit-poor job (Harrington Meyer and Pavalko, 1996),\nand reduced retirement benefits (O'Rand and Henretta,\n1982), any effects of caregiving on employment may have\nlong-term consequences for women's income. In addition,\nwhen caregiving is done in the years just prior to retirement\neligibility, labor force exits or reductions in hours may have\na particularly powerful effect on long-term income. In-\nterruptions that occur when women are closer to retirement\nmay lower their Social Security or private pension benefits\n(Kingston and O'Grady-LeShane, 1993). Furthermore, it is\nnot clear whether work interruptions that occur later in the\ncareer essentially lead to early retirement because of diffi-\nculties in returning to the labor force after caregiving re-\nsponsibilities stop. Thus, even though the length of time\nspent caregiving may be relatively short (Moen, Robison,\nand Fields, 1994), it may be that women are unable to re-\ncover their work hours.\nAlthough most studies have either questioned whether\nemployment affects caregiving or caregiving affects em-\nployment, it is possible that both processes operate simulta-\nneously. Decisions about whether one can provide care for\nan ill or disabled friend or family member may depend on\ntheir employment, particularly if the needed care is exten-\nsive or if the job provides little flexibility for managing\nthese tasks. Once caregiving has started, some employees\nare likely to adjust their schedules or stop work to meet\nthose demands. However, if the causal processes operate in\nboth directions, estimates that only consider one side of this\nrelationship will be biased and possibly misleading.\nObserved differences in caregiving between employed and\nnonemployed women may reflect that employed women are\nless likely to start caregiving, or it may indicate that care-\ngivers reduce or stop employment. Because much of the ex-\nisting research on employment and caregiving is based on\ncross-sectional data, it has been impossible to assess both\nsides of the relationship. In one of the few longitudinal\nstudies examining both processes, Moen and her colleagues\n(1994) find some evidence that both processes do operate,\nthus suggesting the need to further explore both processes\nin conjunction with one another.\nOur understanding of these causal processes is also lim-\nited because much of the prior research estimating this rela-\ntionship is based on samples drawn from populations of\neither workers or caregivers (see Horowitz, 1992, for a re-\nview). Worker samples (e.g., Travelers Companies, 1985;\nScharlach and Boyd, 1989) can provide important detail on\nhow workers manage caregiving tasks, but they eliminate\nanyone who leaves the labor force when they start caregiv-\ning. Estimates based on samples of caregivers (e.g., Brody,\ncomparison between those who are or are not employed,\nbut most are nonprobability samples. Thus, while many\nstudies provide suggestive evidence about how women\ncombine these two roles, select samples and cross-sectional\ndata have limited our ability to fully understand the causal\nrelationship between caregiving and employment.\nA further complication in sorting out these causal rela-\ntionships between caregiving and employment is the fact\nthat there are variations in women's employment. The na-\nture of women's employment varies, and a simple distinc-\ntion between whether or not women are employed does not\ncapture differences in current work environment or prior\nexample, Gerstel and Gallagher (1994) find that the type of\nsupport provided varies by employment status and the de-\nmands of the job. This raises the possibility that there may\nnot be a single causal process, but rather, that it varies de-\npending on one's type of job or even prior work history. To\nexplore this possibility further, we focus on several dimen-\nsions of the work context, including prior work history,\neconomic vulnerability, job satisfaction, and proximity to\nretirement.\nA woman's prior work history may affect whether or not\nshe begins caregiving as well as whether she reduces or\nstops employment if she does start caregiving. When faced\nwith decisions about caregiving, most women have a long\nhistory of combining work and family demands. However,\nthe effects of this prior work context are not fully under-\nstood. One possibility is that women who have previously\nexited the labor force to meet family demands might be\nmore likely to take on caregiving tasks, but Robison and\nher colleagues (1995) find the opposite effect. Among more\nrecent cohorts of women, they find that those with a contin-\nuous work history were more likely to start caregiving. This\nfinding may have several possible explanations that have\nnot yet been explored. It may indicate that women with\nprior interruptions in their work histories are less likely to\ntake on caregiving. Alternatively, it may be that women\nwho have had prior interruptions are also those who have\nbeen at their job for a shorter period of time, and thus have\nless flexibility to manage caregiving tasks. Thus, \"work his-\ntory\" comprises many different factors, such as interrup-\ntions specifically for family, time in one's current job, and\nlong-term work stability, and these may affect caregiving in\ndifferent ways. These components of a woman's work his-\ntory may also affect whether or not women reduce hours\nwhen they do start caregiving. Women who have prior exits\nfrom the labor force for family reasons may be more likely\nto do so again; however, those with less time in their cur-\nrent job may also have the least flexibility to reduce hours.\nSeveral characteristics related to a woman's current job\nmay also influence whether women start caregiving or re-\nduce employment hours. Gerstel and Gallagher (1994) find\nthat income has little effect on whether or not different\ntypes of care are provided, but among those who start care-\ngiving, those with higher wages may have greater flexibil-\nity to reduce hours. It may also be that the effects of income\ndepend on family income needs. If this is the case, we\nwould expect that, net of income level, women who have\ndifficulty making ends meet would be less likely to reduce\nhours or stop work after starting caregiving. A third factor\nthat may affect whether or not women stop or reduce em-\nployment when caregiving are non-monetary benefits from\nthe job. Women who gain satisfaction from their jobs may\nfind that employment helps them manage the demands of\ncaregiving, and thus would be less likely to reduce work. In\ncontrast, those who are less satisfied with their jobs may\nsee caregiving demands as a good reason to leave an unre-\nwarding job. Finally, women's proximity to retirement may\nalso affect whether or not they reduce hours. Women who\nare close to retirement or eligible for early retirement bene-\nfits may find that caregiving prompts an earlier exit from\nthe labor force than was previously planned. Conversely,\nwomen who are closer to retirement may remain in the\nlabor force to increase future Social Security benefits.\nWhile all of these components of the work context may\naffect whether or not caregivers leave the labor force, they\nmay also shape the labor force movement of noncaregivers.\nAs women approach and move through their 60s they be-\ncome increasingly likely to retire, and exits from the labor\nforce for retirement may be confounded with exits for care-\ngiving. Especially when analyzing women of this age, it be-\ncomes important to explore whether the exit process among\ncaregivers differs from that among women of this age more\ngenerally. Are caregivers more likely to exit the labor\nforce? Do factors affecting the exit process differ between\ncaregivers and noncaregivers? For example, we would ex-\npect that, in general, women who are less satisfied with\ntheir jobs would be more likely to reduce employment\nhours or stop work, but do women who start caregiving and\nare dissatisfied with their work have even greater reduc-\ntions than noncaregivers? If this process differs between\ncaregivers and noncaregivers, it may provide clues about\nwhich aspects of work make combining caregiving and em-\nployment particularly compatible or difficult.\nOur primary focus is to sort out the causal relationship\nbetween employment and caregiving. We do this by analyz-\ning changes in both caregiving and employment over a\nthree-year period. Caregiving is defined broadly to allow\nestimation of the general relationships between providing\nany type of care to ill or disabled persons and employment.\nIt seems likely that the magnitude, and even direction, of\nthis causal relationship may vary by many factors such as\nthe type of care being given, the relationship between the\ncaregiver and care recipient, and the total hours of care nor-\nmally given. However, in order to address this general rela-\ntionship over time for both caregivers and noncaregivers,\nwe need to use a data set that includes longitudinal infor-\nmation for both groups of women, and among the available\ndata sets of this type, none consistently include detail about\ncaregiving hours, care recipients, or type of care provided.\nUnderstanding the general direction and magnitude of the\nrelationship between caregiving and employment is a first,\nbut critical, step that should provide an overview for re-\nsearch that can explore the variations among more specific\ntypes and levels of care. In this study caregivers are defined\nas anyone who reports regularly giving care to ill or dis-\nabled persons in the household or anyone who regularly\nspends six or more hours per week caring for someone out-\nside the household.\nWe begin our analyses by estimating the percentages of\nwomen who report changes in employment and caregiving\nstatus over a three-year period. What percentage of women\nwho start caregiving stop work? How does this compare to\nwomen who do not start caregiving? Also, when women start\ncaregiving are they more likely to stop work or reduce\nhours? These percentages are initially estimated separately\nfor caregiving inside and outside the home to explore\nwhether the relationships vary for these different caregiving\nlocations. After examining these percentages, we then esti-\nmate multivariate models to disentangle the causal processes.\nAlthough prior studies have been based on cross-sec-\ntional data, they lead us to several hypotheses about multi-\nvariate relationships. First, particularly because our defini-\ntion of caregiving stresses more extreme types of care\n(caregiving inside the home or caregiving 6 or more hours\nper week outside the home), we expect that employed\nwomen will be less likely to start caregiving. Among\nwomen who are initially employed, we also expect that\nvariations in current jobs or prior work history will help ex-\nplain which women start caregiving. However, this part of\nthe analysis is more exploratory as we seek to better under-\nstand which components of the job might affect women's\ncaregiving behaviors. A second hypothesis is that women\nwho start caregiving will have greater reductions in em-\nployment hours than other women. Once this general rela-\ntionship is assessed, we will further explore whether any\npersonal or job characteristics increase the likelihood of\nthese reductions for caregivers.\nMETHODS\nData\nLongitudinal Survey of Mature Women (NLS) are used to\nexamine the relationship between employment and caregiv-\ning. The NLS is a nationally representative sample of over\nthe sample was originally collected in 1967. African\nAmerican women were oversampled to allow meaningful\nracial comparisons. Since the 1967 survey, the women have\nbeen interviewed approximately every two years.\ninformation on work status and on whether women are car-\ning for an ill or disabled friend or family member inside or\noutside of their home. We were able to choose between a\nthree- or five-year interval because this information is also\navailable in the 1989 survey. A three-year interval is long\nenough to allow us to observe some change in caregiving\nstatus, but is also a short enough interval to minimize the\nlikelihood of multiple job changes or multiple caregiving\nepisodes. This later point is especially important because we\ndo not have information on each caregiving episode, but are\ncapturing caregiving status at two points in time. Estimates\nover longer periods of time also make it nearly impossible\nto link the context of any single job to caregiving changes.\nAnalyzing changes in employment and caregiving between\nthe sample have retired or are closer to retirement, making\nany exits for caregiving less distinguishable from retire-\nment. Additional analyses confirm this assumption -- the\nrelationship between employment and caregiving between\nwork exits for caregiving become less distinct from exits\nmade by all women. While beyond the scope of this study,\nthese findings also suggest that the employment-caregiving\nrelationship may vary across the life course.\nThe NLS is an excellent data set for the analysis of the\ncaregiving/work relationship for several reasons. Data on\nwomen's caregiving and work statuses at two time points\nallow us to compare changes in caregiving for both em-\nployed and nonemployed women. The use of the 1984 and\n1987 surveys is also important because it targets women\nwhen they are in a critical time of the life course for both\ncaregiving and employment. In 1984, the NLS women\nrange from 47 to 61 years of age. This is a time when\nwomen are most likely to become involved in caregiving\ntime when work interruptions are potentially costly for\npostretirement income. Particularly for the older women in\nthis sample, the balance of employment and caregiving\nmay involve future expectations for retirement as well as\ncurrent demands and opportunities.\nThe NLS women also represent an important cohort of\nlished their work and family lives during the 1950s and\n1960s. Their lives span an era of significant social change\nin expectations and opportunities for women to combine\nwork and family responsibilities. Many of their worklives\nreflect this change, with interruptions or postponements of\npaid employment until children were grown. By observing\nthese women when they are in their 50s and 60s, we can\nobserve how they combine work and family demands in\nmid- and later life and assess whether previous ways of\ncombining work and family influence later decisions.\nAttrition was slightly higher among Black women and\namong those with less schooling. However, a detailed com-\nparison between the 1982 survey and the Current Population\nSurvey (CPS) indicated that sample attrition has not sub-\nstantially reduced the representativeness of the NLS (Shaw,\n1986). She found that similar percentages of women in the\nNLS and CPS had not completed high school. One discrep-\nancy between the two samples was between the proportions\nof southern Black women, with the NLS including higher\nproportions of Black women in the South (Shaw, 1986). We\nhave no reason to suspect that the greater representation of\nsouthern Black women will dramatically alter the relation-\nship between employment and caregiving beyond the effects\nof variables such as race that are included as controls.\ncaregiving and all independent variables. To explore the\nimpact of a variety of job characteristics on changes in\ncaregiving and job status, we also created a subsample of\nwomen working in wage and salary jobs in 1984. Self-\nemployed women are excluded from these analyses be-\ncause we lack the more specific information on their jobs\nand job changes. Comparisons between wage and salary\nand self-employed women show that percentages of women\nwho stop work and percentages that start caregiving be-\nworkers. Of 1,423 women working in wage and salary jobs\non all independent variables.\nMeasures\nTwo dependent variables are used for our analyses. The\nfirst is a dichotomous variable measuring whether women\nare caregiving in 1987. We define caregivers as women\nwho report that they regularly provide care for an ill or dis-\nabled person inside their home or that they regularly pro-\nvide 6 or more hours of care per week outside of the home.\nWe do not define women providing 5 or fewer hours of care\noutside the household as caregivers because this minimal\nlevel of care could more easily be combined with employ-\nment. Survey questions do distinguish caregiving from nor-\nmal childcare as well as from other household tasks, but ad-\nditional information on hours of care is only available for\ncaregiving outside the home.\nConsistent with our broad measure of caregiving, a range\nof people were care-recipients. Although we do not have\nfull information on care-recipients in both years (the 1987\nsurvey does not ask about care-recipients for care outside\nthe home), the information we do have points to some gen-\neral patterns of care. The single largest category of care-re-\ncipient inside the home was the respondent's husband. For\nexample, in 1984, 43 percent of recipients of care inside the\nhome were the respondent's spouse. The second most com-\nmon recipient of care inside the home was the respondent's\nhome was less common. The most common recipient of\ncare outside the home was the respondent's parents (45% in\na grandchild. Among women reporting providing care out-\nto multiple persons. Data on care-recipients across the two\nsurveys also indicate that the distribution of care-recipients\ndoes not change dramatically over this 3-year period.\nFinally, for the subset of women who were caregiving in\nmany were caring for the same person. Among women pro-\nviding care inside the home in both surveys, 85 percent re-\nported the same relationship (e.g., spouse, parents) to the\ncare-recipient in both years.\nDescriptive analyses separate caregiving inside and out-\nside the home, but these two types of caregiving are later\ncombined into a single measure because the general pat-\nterns are nearly identical. In later analyses of the effects of\ncaregiving on employment hours, we also checked to see\nwhether caregiving inside versus outside the home had dif-\nferent effects on hours reduction, but found no differences\nbetween the two types of care. Thus, our analyses indicate\nthat the general patterns of the employment-caregiving re-\nlationship are relatively similar for caregiving inside and\noutside the home. An additional concern was that the ques-\ntion for caregiving outside the household does not ask\nwhether their care is paid or unpaid. Although the question\ndoes ask if the care is for a relative or friend, it is possible\nthat some women may report paid care. To investigate this\nfurther, we compared the distribution of occupations among\ncaregivers and noncaregivers to see whether caregivers\nwere more likely to be in nursing or similar types of occu-\npations. We found that 15 percent of caregivers were in\nnursing or institutional aid occupations while 12 percent of\nnoncaregivers were in these types of occupations. The simi-\nlarity of these distributions suggests that the incidence of\nwomen reporting paid caregiving is likely to be very small.\nThis was further confirmed by reestimating all models but\nexcluding women in these occupations. In these models\n(not shown) the direction of all effects was unchanged, al-\nthough the magnitude of several significant coefficients was\nslightly increased.\nThe second dependent variable is the number of hours\nworked per week in the woman's current job. This measure\nis based on a question asking women the usual hours they\nwork per week at their current job. Women not employed in\n1987 were coded as working no hours. Estimating hours as\na continuous variable allows us to account for both reduc-\ntions in hours and movements out of the labor force; this\nmay lead to misleading estimates, however, if a large num-\nber of women are out of the labor force and thus have\nvalues of zero. To check for this, we also reestimated all\nmodels of hours of employment with logistic regression,\nnarrowing our focus to only consider movements in and out\nof the labor force. Given that most of the reductions in\nhours observed among women over this time period actu-\nally involved exits from the labor force, we did not expect\nsubstantial differences. Results from logistic regression\nmodels of labor force status were nearly identical to those\nfrom models of hours of employment.\nOur analyses include four sets of independent variables\nmeasured in 1984. The first group of variables, age, educa-\ntion, race, marital status, health status, and number of de-\npendents in the household, are defined as control variables\nand are included in all models. While several of these vari-\nables are likely to change in the interval, we are primarily\ninterested in how respondents' statuses in 1984 relate to\nsubsequent caregiving and work changes. The coding and\ndescriptive statistics for these variables are described in\ncaregiving status as defined in the previous section. The\nthird and fourth sets of variables measure specific charac-\nteristics of women's employment and their employment\nhistory. These variables are designed to further explore the\nrelationship between employment and caregiving for the\nsubset of women who were working in wage and salary\njobs in 1984. Employment characteristics include hours\nworked per week in 1984, wages, economic vulnerability,\nand job satisfaction. The measure of wages is logged.\nWomen who were missing information on wages were\ngiven a value imputed from their education, occupation,\nand job tenure. A separate dummy variable controlling for\ncases with imputed values on the wage variable was not\nsignificant and thus is not included in models shown.\nEconomic vulnerability is included to assess the importance\nof the job for the family's economic survival. It is measured\nby a question asking about the respondent's family's ability\nto \"make ends meet,\" with a value of 1 indicating that they\nalways have money left over, and a value of 4 indicating\nthat they are unable to make ends meet. Job satisfaction is\nmeasured on a 4-point scale with higher values indicating\ngreater satisfaction with the job. Additional models includ-\ning occupational categories were also estimated, but there\nwere no significant differences between professionals, man-\nagers, and other occupations. We did find that women in\ncraft, operative, or laborer occupations are slightly more\nlikely to start caregiving than other women, but this differ-\nence appears to be a function of the attributes of women\nwho are in these jobs (education, employment history, etc.)\nand the characteristics of the job itself such as income.\nThree variables capture different elements of women's\nemployment history. The proportion of years a woman has\nof employment history and thus allows us to contrast more\nstable workers from intermittent or occasional labor force\nparticipation. Job tenure measures the number of years a\nwoman has been in her current job, thus allowing us to sep-\nTable 1.

A\ndummy variable is also included to indicate whether or not\na woman has left any job since 1967 for family reasons so\nthat we can explore whether women who previously left a\njob to meet family demands are more likely to also leave\nfor caregiving.\nRESULTS\nTable 2 overviews the bivariate relationship between em-\nployment and caregiving over the 3-year interval, separating\ncaregiving inside and outside the household. The most strik-\ning finding is the similarity between the two types of care-\ngiving. Of the 3,083 women in the sample, 4 percent\nhours per week outside the home. Between 23 (inside) and\n24 (outside) percent of women who start caregiving leave\nthe labor force during this time, and 4 percent reduce their\nhours but remain employed. These numbers are especially\nmeaningful when compared to the top row of each panel,\nwhich represents labor force changes among women who\ndid not report caregiving in either time period. While the\nwork hours of noncaregivers are somewhat more stable\n(21% report no change in hours), 16 percent of noncare-\ngivers stopped work during this interval. This suggests that,\nalthough caregivers are slightly more likely to stop working,\nin general, many women in this sample are exiting the labor\nforce even without caregiving responsibilities.\nThis table also suggests a need to separate the role of\nemployment in selecting women into caregiving from the\neffects of caregiving on employment. Forty-nine percent of\nwomen who start caregiving inside the home are not em-\nployed at either survey compared to 41 percent of women\nwho are not caregiving. While not statistically significant,\nthis difference is large enough to suggest that, once other\nfactors are controlled, women may be more likely to take\non caregiving tasks if they are not employed.\nThe Effects of Employment on Caregiving\nTable 3 shows a logistic regression model predicting care-\ngiving in 1987. Because of the similarity between the rela-\ntionships of caregiving and employment inside and outside\nthe home and because of the small percentages of women\nstarting either type of care, they are combined into a single\ncaregiving measure. This model only includes women who\nwere not caregiving in 1984 so that we can examine factors\nthat differentiate those who start caregiving by 1987. The\nfirst model shows that neither the demographic variables nor\nemployment status predict whether or not women start care-\ngiving. Women who are employed in 1984 are no less likely\nto start caregiving than nonemployed women. We find a\nsimilar pattern in the second model; among women em-\nployed in wage and salary jobs, those working more hours\nare not less likely to start caregiving than part-time workers.\nBoth models indicate that women's employment does not\nserve as a deterrent to taking on caregiving tasks. Indeed,\nonly one indicator, how long a woman has been at her cur-\nrent job, is even a marginally significant predictor of care-\ngiving initiation. If we assume that women who have been\nat their jobs for longer periods of time have greater flexibil-\nity because of more established relationships with their em-\nployer and co-workers, this effect may point to the impor-\ntance of job flexibility for caregiving initiation. However,\nthe marginal level of significance indicates that this finding\nwould need to be explored in other samples before drawing\nany definite conclusions about its effect.\nOur inability to differentiate which women start caregiv-\ning may be due to the broad nature of our caregiving mea-\nsure. To examine this possibility further, we examined the\ninitiation of more extensive caregiving. Our measure of care-\ngiving inside the home does not include information on\nhours spent providing care, but the measure outside the home\ndoes include this information. We thus compared women\nwho reported caregiving outside the home for 10 or more\nhours a week to all others. Even for this more intensive level\nof care, employed women were equally likely to start care-\ngiving as were nonemployed women (analyses not shown).\nCaregiving\nChange\nA.

Changes in care-\ngiving status are included as a series of dummy variables\nthat allow us to separately compare women who start, stop,\nor are caregiving at both surveys from those who are not\ncaregiving at either time.\nBoth models in Table 4 show that women who started\ncaregiving after 1984 have significantly greater reductions\nin hours than those who are not involved in caregiving.\nEmployed wage and salary women who are caregiving in\nin work hours than women who do no caregiving, but these\nmodels indicate that the stronger effect of caregiving on\nhours occurs at the onset of caregiving. Equally important\nin these models is the finding that women who were care-\ncantly increase their working hours after they stop caregiv-\ning. This suggests that, at least among women in this age\ngroup, reductions in hours or exits from the labor force are\nnot likely to be recovered after caregiving responsibilities\nstop. Other variables in the model serve as controls and in-\nfluence 1987 hours of employment in expected directions.\nThese results confirm that the initiation of caregiving is\nassociated with greater reductions in hours, but does this\npattern vary depending on the woman's job conditions or\nother factors? For example, are women who are older, have\nhealth problems, less satisfied with their jobs, or have pre-\nviously interrupted work for family reasons more likely to\nreduce hours when they start caregiving? Are women who\nhave more difficulty making ends meet more likely to re-\nTable 4.

An\nequally important question is whether the exit process dif-\nfers for caregivers and noncaregivers. Do the same factors\ninfluence the rate of exit for both groups of women or are\nthere some factors that make caregivers particularly likely\nor unlikely to leave the labor force?\nTable 5 shows the effects of job variables on hours reduc-\ntion separately for caregivers and noncaregivers. Since our\nquestions focus on the effects of the work context, models are\nonly estimated for the employed wage and salary subsample.\nComparisons between caregivers and noncaregivers allow us\nto evaluate whether any factors associated with hours reduc-\ntions among caregivers are different from what we would ex-\npect among women in this age group more generally.\nThe models in Table 5 show that factors influencing\nwomen's reduction in hours are similar for caregivers and\nnoncaregivers. For example, employed caregivers who are\nsatisfied with their job have fewer reductions in hours than\nthose who are less satisfied with their job, but this is also\ntrue for noncaregivers. Older women also tended to reduce\nhave significantly greater reductions than older noncare-\ngivers. In additional models (not shown), we also explored\nwhether alternative specifications of age led to greater re-\nductions among caregivers, but neither proximity to retire-\nment age nor suggestion in 1984 of future plans to retire\nwere associated with greater reductions among caregivers. A\nformal test of model differences, estimated by a single\nmodel that included interaction effects for caregivers, also\nindicates that the effects of independent variables on em-\nployment hours do not vary by caregiving status. These\nfindings suggest that, although caregivers are more likely to\nreduce employment than noncaregivers, the processes af-\nfecting work reductions are similar for the two groups.\nThe one exception to this finding is marital status. Un-\nTable 5.

However,\nthis is even more true for women who start caregiving over\nthis interval (see also Ruhm, 1996). There are several possi-\nble interpretations of this finding. It may indicate that un-\nmarried caregivers find particular benefits in employment\nwhile caregiving (Scharlach and Boyd, 1989) or, alterna-\ntively, it may reflect unusual constraints faced by unmarried\nwomen if faced with caregiving demands. Unmarried\nwomen are less likely to have alternative sources of health\ninsurance, income, and pension support and thus may be\nless likely to reduce employment hours. Caregiving de-\nmands may further exacerbate this process, possibly be-\ncause they point to even greater needs for health insurance\nor other sources of income security for oneself and the per-\nson receiving care. Thus, an alternative explanation is that\nunmarried caregivers have even fewer options than other\nwomen for balancing caregiving and employment. These\nfindings thus suggest a particular need to understand how\nunmarried women manage the balance between employ-\nment and caregiving and whether their greater likelihood to\nremain in employment reflects restricted options or benefits\nof employment for managing the demands of caregiving.\nDISCUSSION\nRecent estimates indicate that over half of U.S. women\nmay provide care for someone who is sick or disabled at\nsome point in their adult lives and that this care is most\nlikely to be done during the prime employment years in\nthese women's lives (Moen, Robison, and Fields, 1994).\nLarge percentages of women will thus be faced with deci-\nsions about how to combine employment and caregiving,\nbut our understanding of how these two types of work af-\nfect one another has been limited. This study seeks to pro-\nvide a better understanding of the connections between em-\nployment and caregiving through an analysis of the\nreciprocal relationships between them.\nOur first hypothesis, that employed women would be less\nlikely to start caregiving, was not supported. Indeed, none\nof the work or demographic characteristics was strongly as-\nsociated with whether or not women started caregiving over\nthe 3-year interval. This suggests that caregiving initiation\nis equally likely for all women, as neither employment nor\npersonal characteristics predict which women will start\ncaregiving.\nHowever, once women do start caregiving, the ways they\nmanage those tasks can affect work. Our second hypothe-\nsis, that women who start caregiving would be more likely\nto reduce or stop employment, was supported. Equally im-\nportant is our finding that women who stop caregiving dur-\ning this interval do not increase employment, thus suggest-\ning that, for women in late midlife, hours lost when\ncaregiving starts are not likely to be recovered later on.\nFinally, although women who start caregiving are more\nlikely to reduce hours or exit the labor force, the work and\ndemographic characteristics that most strongly affect em-\nployment reductions are similar to those that affect\nwomen's employment reductions more generally. Thus,\nolder caregivers and those less satisfied with their job are\nmore likely to reduce hours, but this is also true for non-\ncaregivers. This suggests that the exit process among care-\ngivers is similar to that among noncaregivers, but occurs at\na more rapid pace. The one exception is our finding that un-\nmarried caregivers are especially unlikely to reduce hours,\nindicating the need to explore the potential benefits and re-\nstrictions faced by unmarried caregivers.\nOur findings about the direction of the employment-care-\ngiving relationship are noteworthy because much of the prior\nresearch has been based on cross-sectional data and has not\nbeen able to separate the two sides of this relationship. The\nuse of cross-sectional data can easily lead to incorrect con-\nclusions about the direction of the causal processes. For ex-\nample, if we use only the 1984 survey wave and estimate the\nfind that employed women are much less likely to be care-\ngiving (analyses not shown). An obvious conclusion might\nbe that employment reduces women's ability to take on care-\ngiving tasks. But, when we examine changes in caregiving\nand employment over time, this is not the case. Instead, it is\nafter women start caregiving that they reduce work hours.\nAlthough our attention to the effects of women's prior\nwork history was largely exploratory, it is notable that nei-\nther women's general work history nor prior exits for family\nreasons influence whether or not women start caregiving or\nwhether they reduce hours after starting caregiving. This is\nsomewhat contrary to previous research (Robison, Moen,\nand Dempster-McClain, 1995) that found that similar co-\nhorts of women with continuous work histories were more\nlikely to start caregiving. However, this earlier research also\nfound that the effect of prior work history varied by educa-\ntion and birth cohort, but did not separate the effects of cur-\nrent and prior work status. Further research exploring the\nmany aspects of women's current and prior work history is\nneeded to further understand how work processes relate to\ncaregiving as well as many other types of unpaid work.\nUnderstanding the relationship between caregiving and\nemployment can inform linkages between state policies and\nthe life course. Observed trends in caregiving and employ-\nment are framed within a broader political debate that seeks\nto move responsibility for care back to families, which in\nreality usually means women (Gerstel and Gallagher, 1994;\nSeccombe, 1992). This agenda is based in part on faulty as-\nsumptions that \"families\" (e.g., women) are shirking re-\nsponsibility for care in favor of employment outside the\nhome. Our research joins a growing body of research that\nsuggests that this is not the case. Employed women are not\nless likely to start caregiving and \"career\" women -- those\nwith more stable work histories or those who did not previ-\nously interrupt their work to take care of family needs --\nare no less likely to provide care than other women.\nInstead, what our findings do suggest is that employed\nwomen take on caregiving tasks at a potential cost to their\nshort- and long-term income. Caregiving is associated with\ngreater reductions in employment hours, and these hours\nappear to not be recovered when women stop caregiving.\nWhile this finding is only preliminary, given the proximity\nof this cohort of women to retirement, it is potentially im-\nportant. If later worklife exits for caregiving are not recov-\nered, then these reductions will translate into short-term\nloss of wages but also potentially long-term reductions in\npension income. The pattern that emerges is not one of\nwomen forgoing caregiving because of employment, but\nrather, women squeezed as reductions in government pro-\ngrams and health insurance increase both their responsibil-\nity for providing care and their need for waged income\n(Glazer, 1990). Further reductions in policies supporting\nworking families will only exacerbate those pressures.\nOur findings on the causal processes relating employ-\nment and caregiving suggest several avenues for further\nstudy. First, longitudinal analyses comparing caregiving ac-\ntivities of men and women are needed if we are to fully un-\nderstand the employment-caregiving relationship. This\nstudy examines variations among women, in part because\nwomen provide much of the care to ill or disabled persons.\nHowever, research comparing caregiving between men and\nwomen indicates that they may provide different types of\ncare (see Dwyer and Coward, 1992, for a review). It seems\nplausible that the causal relationships between employment\nand caregiving may differ for men and women, but it is not\nclear whether any differences might stem from variation in\njob conditions, work histories, or from other differences in\ngender roles. Second, more detailed analyses of how spe-\ncific types and levels of caregiving affect and are affected\nby employment are also needed. For example, cross-sec-\ntional research has shown that those providing more than\n10 hours of care per week or those providing the most ex-\ntensive types of care may be less likely to be employed\nit remains unclear whether the causal relationships differ or\nare just more pronounced for higher levels of care. Thus,\nwe need to further examine whether these relationships\nvary for different types and levels of care.\nFinally, the relationship between caregiving and employ-\nment speaks to broader questions about how men and\nwomen combine paid and unpaid work, how caregiving\ncompares to other types of unpaid work, and how these\ntypes of work may shift across the life course. In many\nways, the work of caring for an ill or disabled friend or\nfamily member is unique. Unlike childcare, caregiving may\nlast for a short period of time (see Moen, Robison, and\nFields, 1994). Particularly in the early stages, it is seldom\nplanned and may be prompted by a sudden and unexpected\nchange in someone's health. Also, unpaid work that arises\nlater in the life course, such as caregiving, may affect work\ndifferently than unpaid work done earlier in the work ca-\nreer. In other ways, caregiving may be similar to other\ntypes of unpaid work, such as housework and childcare. All\nof these types of unpaid work may conflict with paid em-\nployment, and often they require similar types of tasks\n(feeding, cleaning, bathing, running errands). While we are\nbeginning to have a better understanding of each of these\ntypes of work, we still know little about how all types of\nunpaid work relate to one another, and their individual and\ncumulative impact on paid employment.\n"
