Kimball Romney, University of California, Irvine, CA, June 20, 2003 (received for review May 6, 2003)\nScreening guidelines proposed by the Expert Committee on the\nDiagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus have been en-\ndorsed by several medical societies. However, one-third of cases\nare undiagnosed, and complications at the time of diagnosis\nindicate that disease may have been present for several years\nbefore diagnosis. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the\nguidelines for detecting new cases of diabetes mellitus. By using a\ncross-sectional, representative sample of the United States (Na-\ntional Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, NHANES III), the\nguidelines are tested on adults, 20 years and older without a prior\ndiagnosis of diabetes. Individuals are classified as nondiabetics\ntheir blood glucose. Screening when one risk factor is present, as\nstated in the guidelines, has a true-positive rate of 100% and\nwould require that 83% of the population be tested. Screening\nwhen two risk factors are present is more efficient, with a com-\nparable true-positive rate (98%), but requires that only 59% of the\npopulation be tested. A notable finding is the earlier age of onset\namong minorities, which may be associated with other health\ndisparities. Because diabetes occurs at younger ages in minorities,\nscreening whites who are >40 and minorities >30 years of age has\na high true-positive rate (95%) and also reduces testing (60%). The\nscreening guidelines would be effective, if followed, and would\nessentially eliminate undiagnosed cases of diabetes.\nThe Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of\nDiabetes Mellitus (1) has proposed guidelines for diabetes\nmellitus testing in asymptomatic, undiagnosed individuals. Al-\nthough screening is not recommended in the general adult\npopulation, it is recommended for individuals with one or more\nrisk factors (Table 1). Screening is recommended at 3-year\nintervals beginning at age 45 years, with earlier andor more\nfrequent screening for individuals with other risk factors (1).\nBecause these guidelines are generally considered the standard\nfor diabetes screening (several professional societies have\nadopted the guidelines), we evaluate their ability to detect new\ncases of diabetes in a U.S. national sample. The recommenda-\ntions proposed by the Expert Committee are based on a review\nof scientific evidence, but their sensitivity for detection of new\ncases of diabetes has not been tested.\nDiabetes is a national health problem in the Unites States. It\nis associated with micro- and macrovascular disease resulting in\nsignificant morbidity and mortality. Diabetes is a class of met-\nabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia. The two most\nprevalent types are distinguished by a lack of insulin (type 1) or\ninsufficient insulin (type 2) to metabolize glucose (1). Among\nadults, diabetes is among the leading causes of death (2, 3) and\nis the number one cause of new cases of legal blindness (20- to\n74-year-olds) (4), end-stage renal disease (5), and lower-\nextremity amputations (6). Direct costs for medical services and\nindirect costs because of lost productivity due to diabetes\ndiabetes (physician-diagnosed and undiagnosed) among adults\n(20 years) is 7.8% (8) and has risen during the past decade. For\nthose 40\u00ad74 years of age, the prevalence of diabetes has in-\nincreased prevalence is most likely due to increased incidence\nand not decreased mortality (9) or improved case detection.\nBecause intervention trials (10\u00ad14) have demonstrated that\nimproved glycemia can prevent or delay complications, an early\ndiagnosis and appropriate management of diabetes should be a\npriority.\nDiagnostic and screening guidelines have been developed by\nan expert panel (1). Diagnosis is made when hyperglycemia is\npresent, as measured by a FPG test (FPG  126 mgdl) (1).\nScreening is recommended for those 45 years of age and older;\nwith repeated testing every 3 years if results are normal. Screen-\ning also should be considered at younger ages or at more\nfrequent intervals for those who have diabetes risk factors\nThe guidelines have been adopted by the American Academy\nof Family Physicians (15), the American Association of Clinical\nEndocrinologists (www.aace.com), and the International Diabe-\ntes Center (16). The latter two groups added risk factors\n(acanthosis nigricans and cardiovascular disease), and the en-\ndocrinologists recommended screening at 30 years, if other risk\nfactors are present. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\n(17), the Canadian Task Force (18), and the American College\nof Physicians (19) have more ambiguous recommendations and\nsuggest screening those who are obese, older, or the member of\na racialethnic minority, or who have a family history of diabetes.\nUnfortunately, one third of diabetes cases (probably type 2)\nare undiagnosed (8). Also, the presence of microvascular disease\n(specifically, retinopathy) at the time of diagnosis suggests that\ndisease may be present for 2\u00ad10 years before diagnosis (20). The\nquestion is whether the guidelines are sufficient to detect most\ncases of diabetes.

Alternatively, it is possible\nthat the guidelines are sufficient, but that they are not being\nfollowed. In the 1989 National Health Interview Survey, only\n38.6% of those without a history of diabetes but with three\ndiabetes risk factors reported being screened and only 57.1% of\nthose with four or more risk factors reported being screened\n(30). Minorities have disproportionately higher rates of compli-\ncations and mortality because of diabetes, and it is not known if\nthese disparities are due to a delay in diagnosis (31).\nThis study examines the performance of screening guidelines\nfor identifying undiagnosed diabetes in a national sample. We\nfocus on only the risk factors included in the guidelines and test\ntheir ability to detect new or undiagnosed cases of diabetes in the\nU.S. population. The National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES III) (32, 33) provides information that\nparallels the screening problem, namely, the detection of undi-\nagnosed cases of diabetes in the general population. The\nNHANES III includes data on seven of the risk factors in Table\n1. In addition, the study includes FPG results for a sample of\nindividuals without a prior diagnosis of diabetes. The relative\nimportance of risk factors in identifying new cases of diabetes can\nbe obtained by comparing those with undiagnosed diabetes\nimportantly, their efficacy in detecting new cases of diabetes can\nbe estimated by calculating the true-positive rate for the screen-\ning guidelines.\nMethods\nData Source and Sample. The NHANES III is based on a stratified,\nmultistage probability sample of noninstitutionalized U.S. civil-\nand Mexican Americans. The complex survey design included\nsample weights for population estimates, because each person\ndoes not have the same probability of selection. Only subjects\nidentified as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mex-\nican American were eligible for the study. Included individuals\nwho did not specifically self-identify as one of these groups were\ncategorized as ``other'' (32, 33). In this article, these groups are\nreferred to as white, African American, Mexican American, and\nother.\nThe sample for this study included nonpregnant adults (20\nyears of age) who had a physical examination, morning veni-\ndiagnosis of diabetes (excluding gestational diabetes) and were\nexcluded. For those without a prior diagnosis of diabetes, only\nthose who had fasted between 8 and 24 h and had a FPG\nmeasurement were included (n  6,515). Those who had a\nFPG  126 mgdl were categorized as undiagnosed diabetics\nMeasures and Analysis. The main outcome variable, diabetes\nstatus, was defined with two categories of subjects: those with\nundiagnosed diabetes and those without diabetes. The two\ngroups were compared in terms of their risk factors: age (45\nyears); ethnicity; positive family history (parent or sibling with\ndiabetes); overweightobesity (measured by BMI  25 and\nBMI  30 kgm2) (34); history of gestational diabetes; a prior\ndiagnosis of hypertension or a current hypertensive reading; and\ntheir lipid profile (HDLs and triglycerides). Information was not\navailable for history of macrosomic infant (9 pounds) or\ndysglycemia (e.g., 110  FPG  126 mgdl). Thus, the first seven\nrisk factors in Table 1 were considered for analysis. Descriptive\nstatistics (percentages and odds ratios) were obtained for the\ngroups for all risk factors. A simple, main effects logistic\nregression (35) model was used to estimate the relative strength\nof the risk factors in distinguishing those with and without\ndiabetes. Odds ratios [and 95% Taylor series confidence inter-\nvals (C.I.)] for risk factors were obtained from logistic regression\nmodels. All risk factors were dichotomized to parallel the\nscreening guidelines and to facilitate comparisons of the relative\nmagnitude of the odds ratios across variables. All analyses\ninclude weighting and design factors with SAS (36) and SUDAAN\n(37). The purpose of weighting the sample data is to allow\nestimates of statistics that would have been obtained if the entire\nsampling frame (the United States) had been surveyed. The\ntrue-positive (hit rate) and false-positive (false alarm) rates were\nestimated for the presence or absence of different combinations\nof risk factors for detecting diabetes, and the proportion of the\npopulation with each combination of risk factors.\nResults\nRelative Importance of Risk Factors for Detecting Undiagnosed Dia-\nthan a high school education, and 11.82% had no health insur-\nance (Table 2).

In model 2, risk factors and gestational diabetes were\ntested for women only.\nIn the general population, the strongest risk factor is older age.\nThe bivariate odds ratio (OR) (Table 2) indicates that those 45\nyears of age are at 7.50 times greater risk for having undiagnosed\ndiabetes.

The odds of having\ndiabetes increase 1.05 times for each year increase in age (OR \nreplacing age 45 years in model 1, not shown). Diabetes,\nhowever, occurs at an earlier age in the minority ethnic groups.\nAmong those with undiagnosed diabetes, the youngest individ-\nuals were 34 years of age among whites, 27 years among African\nAmericans, and 24 years among Mexican Americans. The dis-\ntribution of undiagnosed diabetes cases shows that 11.51% of\nAmerican individuals are 45 years of age (Table 4). The\n45-year cutpoint for whites (where 12% of undiagnosed cases\nare younger) is comparable with 34 years of age for African\nAmericans and 31 years for Mexican Americans.\nThe effect of ethnicity appears to be due to the younger age\ndistribution of undiagnosed cases among minorities.

In the multivariate model (Table 3, model 1), Mexican\nAmericans and African Americans are twice as likely as whites\nto have undiagnosed diabetes.

Per-\nformance of the risk factors for detecting diabetes in the general\npopulation can be estimated by evaluating decision rules to select\nindividuals for screening. Performance can be described with the\nproportion of diabetes cases that would be detected (hit rate or\ntrue-positive rate) and the proportion of the population that\nwould need to be screened (e.g., the proportion of the population\nwith those risk factors). A high true-positive rate (with a\ncorresponding low false-negative rate) is an important attribute\nof a decision rule identifying high-risk individuals for screening\nfor diabetes, because false-positive errors (resulting in unneces-\nsary FPG tests) are less costly than are false-negative errors\n(missing cases of diabetes). The goal of using risk factors to\nidentify individuals for screening is to rule out disease, rather\nthan a diagnostic role to identify when disease is present. Thus,\na high true-positive rate (sensitivity) and high negative predictive\nvalue are desirable. Predictive value is the Bayesian posterior\nprobability of disease, given the presence or absence of risk\nfactors and the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes (38). Neg-\native predictive value is the likelihood that someone does not\nhave diabetes, given that they do not have any risk factors.\nPositive predictive value is the likelihood that someone has\ndiabetes, given that they have risk factors.\nThe Expert Committee guidelines (1) recommend screening\nthose who are 45 years of age or older and those with other risk\nfactors at a younger age. In this study, the screening recommen-\ndations were operationalized in the following ways. The first\nstrategy was equivalent to screening in the presence of at least\none risk factor (including age 45 years as a risk factor),\nregardless of age. The true-positive rate or sensitivity for this\nor more risk factors, 83.00% would be identified for testing. If\nscreening at a ``younger age,'' when risk factors are present, were\noperationalized instead as screening only those 30 years of age\nand older with one other risk factor (rule 2), 70.22% of the\npopulation would be tested with 99.67% sensitivity. Screening, at\nany age, when two or more risk factors are present (rule 3) has\npopulation. Limiting screening (in rule 3) to those 30 years of age\nand older with any two or more risk factors reduces testing to\nSimpler rules, such as universal screening for everyone 45\nyears of age and older (rule 5), results in a sensitivity of 83.97%\nand would identify 42.35% of the population for testing. (Note\nthat the sensitivity of each variable, taken singly, appears in the\nsecond numeric column of Table 2.) However, this rule has\nand 47.16% for Mexican Americans because of the earlier age of\nonset among minorities (Table 4). If ethnicity were incorporated\ninto rule 5 by using the age distribution of undiagnosed cases, so\nthat whites 45 years of age and older, African Americans 35 and\nolder, Mexican Americans 32 and older, and others 45 and older\n(rule 7) were identified for screening; sensitivity would be\nequalized for each ethnic group at 88%. A slight simplification\nof rule 7 would be to screen whites at 40 years and non-whites\npopulation would be identified for testing.\nOverweight, poor lipid profile (low HDLs or high triglycer-\nides), and gestational diabetes were also identified as strong\npredictors of undiagnosed diabetes. Screening for overweight\n(rule 9) has sensitivity similar to that of age (rule 5), but not age\nand ethnicity (rule 8). Screening for older age within ethnic\ngroups or overweight (rule 10) is equivalent to screening younger\npeople if they were overweight. This rule has sensitivity of\nTable 5.

Combination of age\nand ethnicity with lipid profile would detect almost all cases\ndiabetes has a high true-negative rate (specificity) and although\nfew people had gestational diabetes, those that have had it were\nvery likely to have diabetes. Screening based on two or three of\nthe risk factors, such as age and ethnicity (rule 8); age, ethnicity,\nand overweight (rule 10); age, ethnicity, and lipids (rule 12); or\nage, ethnicity, and gestational diabetes (rule 14) perform as well\nas the entire set of risk factors (rule 1).\nConclusions\nRisk factors included in the screening guidelines have a strong\nassociation with diabetes. Having hypertension or a positive family\nhistory of diabetes can double the risk of having diabetes. Age,\nobesity, a poor lipid profile, and gestational diabetes, however,\nmore than double the risk of diabetes. Previous screening guidelines\nidentified obesity (BMI  27 kgm2) (39) as a risk factor, but it is\nclear that risk increases as BMI increases and that being ``over-\nweight'' is a significant risk factor without the presence of obesity.\nIf clinician screening practices followed recommended guidelines\nand individuals with one or more risk factors (Table 1) were\nscreened, then the approximately one-third of diabetes cases that\nare undiagnosed would be essentially eliminated.\nThe strongest risk factors performed as well as all risk factors\ntogether in detecting new cases of diabetes. Age is the risk factor\nmost strongly associated with the detection of undiagnosed cases\nof diabetes, but it does not have a simple cut-point appropriate\nfor all ethnic groups. Clinical screening strategies focused on\nolder adults (45 years of age) will miss minorities with diabetes.\nThe best performance occurs when white patients are screened\nbeginning at age 40 years and Mexican Americans and African\nAmericans are screened beginning at age 30 years. This simple\nrule would require testing of only 59.84% of the population and\nwould detect most cases (95%) of diabetes. The 45-year cutoff in\nthe screening guidelines should be reconsidered, given the risk\nto younger minorities.\nIdentification of risk factors can help guide who should be\nscreened and may reduce unnecessary testing. An efficient strategy\nwould rule out disease with a high probability, accurately detect new\ncases, and minimize unnecessary testing. Negative predictive value\nestimates the probability of classifying individuals as disease-free\nand, in this case, its small numerical range (97\u00ad100%) indicates that\nruling out disease is possible with most strategies. The difficulty lies\nin detecting the small proportion of the general population who\nhave undiagnosed diabetes.\nBy focusing on those at highest risk for diabetes, the screening\nguidelines can accurately detect new cases and reduce unneces-\nsary testing in the general population. If everyone were screened\n(100% of the adult population), all undiagnosed diabetes cases\nwould be detected (sensitivity  100%). If any one of the risk\nfactors is used to indicate who should be screened, sensitivity is\nalso 100%, but only 83% of the population would need to be\nscreened. The presence of two or more risk factors sacrifices a\nsmall amount of sensitivity, doubles the specificity, and further\nreduces necessary testing from 83% to 59%. This additional 24%\nreduction in testing could have a large impact on the cost of\ntesting in the United States.\nUsing risk factors to identify individuals with diabetes has had\nmixed results in previous studies primarily because of limited\nsamples. Nonrepresentative, clinical samples or samples with little\nvariation in ethnicity or age are not appropriate for generalizing to\nthe U.S. population. An advantage of using the NHANES data is\nthat the sample allows for generalization of results to the U.S.\npopulation. Previously, Herman et al. (24) attempted to identify\nindividuals for screening by using the NHANES II data. The\nHerman et al. study, however, did not test the screening guidelines,\nand they used an ad hoc (non-maximum likelihood) modeling\ntechnique. They developed four rules combining two or more risk\nfactors (age, obesity, family history, and sedentary lifestyle) and\ncorrectly identified 79% of ``newly diagnosed'' diabetics. In the\nNHANES III data, the current recommended guidelines and\nsimpler decision rules have detection rates 95%.\nThe NHANES data set offers a wonderful opportunity to\nvalidate the screening guidelines on a representative U.S. sample\nthat is sufficiently large to contain adequate numbers of undi-\nagnosed diabetics. Conclusions based on the NHANES data,\nhowever, are limited by the set of variables included in the survey\nand the accuracy of those variables. One limitation is the reliance\non a single FPG measurement to diagnose diabetes. Although\nFPG has replaced the oral glucose tolerance test as the diag-\nnostic standard, a clinical diagnosis is confirmed by an additional\ntest (FPG or oral glucose tolerance test) on a subsequent day (1).\nA single FPG would have more classification errors (higher\nfalse-negative rate) than a two-step, two-test method. Even\nscreening criteria estimated to detect 100% of diabetes cases\nwould miss some cases because of the false-negative rate of the\ndiagnostic test. Another limitation is that information is unavail-\nable for history of macrosomic infant and dysglycemia. Sensi-\ntivity of the available risk factors, however, is so high that\ninclusion of additional variables could not appreciably improve\nsensitivity, but might increase the number of people identified\nfor screening. Even without a complete set of risk factors, almost\nall cases of diabetes are detected.\nThe Expert Committee (1) guidelines would detect almost all\ncases of diabetes in the general population, if followed. Although\nthe guidelines have been adopted by several professional soci-\neties, the prevalence of undetected cases of diabetes in the\ngeneral population (8) suggests that guidelines are not being\nfollowed. Efficacious guidelines exist, but implementation of the\nguidelines remains the greatest challenge.\nWe thank Alvah R. Cass, M.D., for comments throughout the develop-\nment of this paper.
