Elderly widows are three times as likely to live in poverty as older married people. This study investigates\nthe gap in poverty, income, and wealth between these groups. Focus is placed on the role played by out-of-pocket medical\nexpenditures spent on dying spouses.\nMethods. A national panel survey of people age 70 and older in 1993 was used. Income, poverty, wealth, and out-of-\npocket expenditures were examined before and after widowhood, with comparisons made with couples not experiencing\na death.\nResults. Forty-four percent of the difference in economic status between widow(er)s and married elderly persons was\ndue to disparities in economic status that existed prior to widowhood. The remaining 56% was due to factors more directly\nrelated to the death of a spouse, including the loss of income and expenses associated with dying. On average, out-of-\npocket medical expenditures in the final 2 years of life were equal to 30% of the couple's annual income. For couples in\nthe bottom quarter of the income distribution, these expenditures were 70% of their income.\nDiscussion. As policy makers continue to debate expansions and reforms of Medicare, the potential effects of these\nreforms on economic well-being, particularly among widows, should be considered.\nDESPITE the overwhelming success and popularity of\nprograms such as Social Security and Medicare, some\nsubgroups of the elderly population continue to face substantial\nrisks of living in poverty. Whereas the poverty rate for elderly\nindividuals is now hovering at 10%, the poverty rate for elderly\nwidows is nearly twice as high. When examining poverty rates\nfor women in particular, one finds that approximately 5% of\nmarried elderly persons are poor compared with 17% of wid-\nows (Figure 1). Although policy makers have repeatedly\nexpressed concern about these high rates and enacted legis-\nlation attempting to improve the well-being of surviving\nspouses, the figure demonstrates that this gap has stubbornly\nremained (see endnote 1). Obviously, the more that is known\nabout the causes and characteristics of poverty among widows,\nthe better targeted public policy can be.\nOne possible explanation for these high rates of poverty that\nhas received little attention is the potential for couples to spend\nsubstantial portions of their wealth on the health care of a sick\nor dying spouse. When an ill spouse dies, the survivor may be\nleft with fewer assets than had been anticipated, putting her at\ngreater risk of becoming poor. Although this hypothesis has\nnever been examined directly, recent policy discussions have\nreached the near-unanimous consensus that Medicare, the\nprimary source of health insurance for most elderly citizens, has\nimportant gaps, including, most notably, the failure to cover\nextended hospital stays, prescription drugs, and long-term care.\nIndeed, the Medicare Modification Act of 2003 partially fills\none of these gaps by providing some prescription drug coverage\nbeginning in 2006. Although many couples have health\ninsurance that supplements Medicare, a sizable portion may\nbe vulnerable to catastrophic expenditures.\nHere we investigate this possibility by examining medical\nout-of-pocket (MOOP) expenditures for elderly couples in the\nperiod immediately preceding the death of one spouse. Al-\nthough the first spouse to die is typically the male, we include\nboth widows and widowers in our study and simplify the\ndiscussion by using the term ``widow'' to refer to both. We first\nexamine the size of these expenditures on an absolute level and\nrelative to the couple's income and wealth. We then focus on\nthe effects of MOOP expenditures on the financial well-being\nof the surviving spouse.\nOur study proceeds as follows. The first section provides\nbackground information on the explanations for why widow\npoverty is so high. This section also describes the Medicare\nprogram and its gaps in coverage. Then the Asset and Health\nDynamics Study that we use for our analysis is described. The\nempirical analyses of MOOP expenditures and other factors\naffecting the finances of the surviving spouse follow. The final\nsection summarizes the findings.\nWhy are so many widows poor? The death of a spouse will\nmean a loss in income if the spouse had been working or per-\nhaps the loss of a business if he was self-employed. However,\na spouse's death may also result in a loss of many types of\nnonlabor income including pensions, annuities, and Social\nSecurity. Certainly, the amount needed to support a single\nperson is less than that needed to provide for a married couple,\nbut often the loss in income will be greater than the change in\nneeds. For example, Social Security benefits for a couple in\nwhich only one spouse worked substantially in the labor force\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nare typically reduced by one-third when a spouse dies. Among\ncouples in which both spouses worked and drew on their own\nSocial Security benefits, benefits would be reduced by an even\ngreater percentage. At the same time, the reduction in the needs\nlevel, as measured by the poverty line, is just 20%, automat-\nically ``causing'' a number of individuals to be newly classified\nas poor. Finally, there may be reductions in financial well-being\nif some of the couple's wealth is bequeathed to a child or other\nheir or if substantial funeral expenses are involved.\nLess obvious is the potential role played by differential\nmortality. The strong gradient in mortality risk by income (and\nwealth) implies that at any given age, women whose husbands\nhave died likely had lower income throughout their lives than\nwomen whose husbands are still alive. Holding age constant,\nthen, widows will be poorer than married women (Holden,\nMOOP expenditures near death provide an additional avenue\nthrough which widows may become poor. It is well known that\nMedicare expenditures near death are large (Garber, MaCurdy,\n& McClellan, 1998): Evidence based on Medicare records points\nto medical spending in the last years of life that is approximately\nsix times larger than medical expenses at other times (Lubitz &\nRiley, 1993). However, it remains to be seen whether the out-of-\npocket costs borne by Medicare beneficiaries themselves have a\nsharp rise as well. The fact that the Medicare program does not\noffer coverage for long-term care, extended hospital stays, pre-\nscription drugs (until 2006), and other services might appear to\nbe a cause for concern. Many elderly persons do have insurance\nto supplement Medicare; 33.7% of this population has employer-\nsponsored private health insurance, an additional 30.1% of\nelderly Medicare participants purchase private insurance, and\nthe poor are either implicitly or explicitly covered by the\nMedicaid program (Liu & Sharma, 2003). Note, however, that\nMedigap insurance does not provide coverage for long-term care\nand many policies do not cover prescription drugs. Medicaid\ndoes cover all such expenses.\nWe are not the first to recognize the potential importance of\nmedical spending in affecting economic well-being. In 1995, a\nNational Academy of Sciences panel issued a report on poverty,\narguing that health care expenditures should be subtracted from\nincome when measuring poverty rates (Citro & Michael, 1995).\nBecause medical costs are high among the elderly, such a\nchange would be expected to have a substantial effect on esti-\nmates of poverty for this group. One study has concluded that\nsubtracting MOOP expenditures from income would lead to\nelderly poverty rates that are twice as high as the current-\nincome-only approach used by the Census Bureau (Johnson &\nDATA\nThe data for our study come from the Asset and Health\nDynamics (AHEAD) cohort of the Health and Retirement Study\n(HRS). The HRS is a panel survey of older individuals. The\nAHEAD cohort consists of those born in 1923 or before, as well\nas their spouses or partners (Soldo, Hurd, Rodgers, & Wallace,\n1997). When appropriately weighted, the sample is representa-\ntive of the noninstitutionalized population in this age group. The\nfirst wave of AHEAD interviews was conducted in 1993 when\nrespondents were approximately 70 years old or older, and they\nhave been reinterviewed approximately biennially thereafter.\n(The pattern of biennial interviews was altered in 1997 to carry\nout a one-time shift to even-numbered years.) Importantly for\nthis article, when a respondent dies, an ``exit'' interview is\nconducted to obtain information about the respondent's life\nsince the previous wave, including medical expenses up until\nthe date of death.\nWe use Wave 1 and Wave 2 of AHEAD and the exit interview\nfor respondents who died between waves. Of particular impor-\ntance are the data on MOOP expenditures. In Wave 1, respon-\ndents are asked to report total expenditures on goods and\nservices (nursing home, hospital and doctor bills, and any other\nmedical or dental expenses) for the preceding 12 months. Data\non MOOP expenditures in Wave 1 were collected in two\nquestions: one focusing solely on nursing home expenses and\na second comprehensive question that asked about all other\nexpenses. We combined these two categories to form total\nMOOP expenditures. Depending on the category of expendi-\ntures and the wave of the interview, as little as 0.1% and as much\nas 20.2% of the sample had missing data on MOOP, with the\nhighest rates within the exit interview. When the respondent did\nnot know if there were any such expenses, we imputed the\namount using a two-step procedure. First, we randomly assigned\na value of 0 or 1 to each of the ``don't knows,'' with the prob-\nability of being assigned a value of 1 equal to the share of the\nrespondents reporting positive MOOP spending among those\nwho did, in fact, know if MOOP expenditures were incurred.\nThe ``don't knows'' who were randomly assigned a value of 1\nwere then assigned a value of MOOP spending equal to the mean\nvalue of MOOP expenditures among those respondents who\nreported positive values. Respondents assigned a value of 0\nwere assigned MOOP spending of 0. Given the skewness of the\ndistribution, we also experimented with using the median instead\nof the mean and found the results to be similar. To this combined\namount, we add expenditures for health insurance premiums\nincluding Medicare Part B premiums (see endnote 2). This total\ngives us our measure of what individuals spent for health care.\nHill and Mathiowetz (2000) find that estimates of medical\nspending based on the HRS and the Medical Expenditure Panel\nStudy align well.\nFor married couples, the Wave 1 survey is less than ideal in\nthat it does not identify which spouse incurred the costs. To\nestimate a per-person expenditure, we simply assign half of the\ncouple's total expenditures to each spouse. Because we focus\nFigure 1. Poverty rates for elderly women by marital status: 1972\u00ad\n2002. (Source: authors' tabulations using March Current Population\nSurvey).\non those couples in which a spouse died between Wave 1 and\nWave 2, it is possible that the spouse who died between waves\nwas ill and had higher health care costs in Wave 1 than did the\nsurviving spouse. In this case, our approach of evenly dividing\nWave 1 expenses may lead to an underestimate of MOOP ex-\npenditures in the last years of life. We have carefully inves-\ntigated this issue and believe that this bias is likely to be small.\nBecause there is no aggregation bias for single respondents, we\ninvestigate the possible severity of this bias by comparing\nhealth care costs in Wave 1 for singles who survive to the\nsecond wave and those who do not. We find that MOOP ex-\npenditures are 25% percent larger for singles who die between\nwaves than for those who survive, $2,503 compared with\n$1,995. In comparison, the difference in our constructed MOOP\nexpenditures in Wave 1 for married couples who experienced\na death and those who did not was, again, approximately 25%\ngesting that the equal division of Wave 1 expenditures did not\nresult in misleading conclusions.\nAt the exit interview, proxy respondents were asked to report\nMOOP expenditures for the decedent between the time of the\nWave 1 interview and the time the person died. In the exit in-\nterview, expenditures were reported solely for the deceased\nrespondent (and not for the couple as a whole) and were delin-\neated separately for each of the following categories: nursing\nhome and hospital, hospice, doctor and dental bills, prescription\ndrugs, special services, and all other services. The amount spent\non health insurance premiums for the deceased spouse is also\nreported. Thus, the data contained in the exit interview are\nsomewhat more detailed than those available in Wave 1.\nBecause the date of death varies across decedents, the time\nspan included in the exit interview measure of MOOP spending\ndiffers across observations, potentially varying from 1 day (if the\ndecedent died the day after completing the initial interview) to as\nmuch as roughly 2 years (if the respondent died just prior to the\nsecond interview). Although the survey asks the proxy re-\nspondents for the date of death of the deceased, this information\nis not available in the public release version of the AHEAD, and\nwe therefore cannot scale expenses by the length of time elapsed\nsince the Wave 1 interview (see endnote 3).\nFor individuals who die between waves, we combine total\nMOOP expenses reported in Wave 1 (i.e., one-half of a couple's\nexpenditure) with expenses reported in the exit interview and\ncall this ``end-of-life expenditures.'' For respondents who are\nmarried in Wave 1 and for whom a spouse does not die (i.e.,\n``survivors''), we combine MOOP expenditures for waves 1\nand 2 and use this total to compare with the end-of-life\nexpenditures of decedents. The time frame for our expenditure\nmeasures therefore varies from 1 to as many as 3 years prior to\ndeath for decedents but always equals 3 years for survivors.\nThe different length of time over which MOOP expenditures\nare measured biases our results against finding greater\nexpenditures for decedents than survivors because decedents,\nby definition, live less than the time between interviews. Thus,\ndifferences in daily expenditures for decedents and survivors\nwill be even greater than those we report. To assess the degree\nof concentration of spending, we also compare just Wave 1\nexpenditures for the two groups. This comparison provides an\nestimate of the degree to which differences in expenditures are\nevident well before the date of death. In this case, the time\nperiods covered by the data are identical and equal to 12\nmonths.\nIncome is total income of the household from all sources.\nWealth includes the couple's holdings in the form of housing,\nvehicles, and other physical assets (less the amount still owed on\nthose assets), plus all financial assets; Social Security and pen-\nsion wealth are not included. All income and wealth estimates,\nincluding MOOP spending, are expressed in 2000 dollars.\nA total of 775 people died between the two waves and had\na completed exit interview. (Sixty-nine respondents were\nreported to have died but had no exit interview.) Of these 775,\n271 were married in Wave 1 and had a spouse who survived to\nWave 2, whereas an additional 3,550 respondents were married\nin Wave 1 and remained married to the same (living) spouse in\nWave 2. For many of our analyses, we will compare these 271\ndecedents with the 3,550 survivors. For the survivors, each\nspouse in a married couple contributes one observation to the\nanalysis. Therefore, all estimates of MOOP are reported on an\nindividual basis, not for the couple as a whole. As noted earlier,\nour sample of decedents includes both males and females,\nalthough we will refer to this group as ``widows.'' Among the 271\ndecedents, 201 are males, so the surviving spouses are over-\nwhelmingly female. Therefore, analyses that were conducted\nusing data only on female survivors led to very similar results.\nThe sample size was not large enough to examine male survivors\nby themselves. Descriptive characteristics of the sample are\nreported in Table 1.\nDistribution of Expenditures\nTable 2 reports the distribution of MOOP expenditures for\neach of the two interview periods and the combined total.\nStatistics are presented separately for our initially married dece-\ndents and those in surviving couples.\nAlmost all people, both survivors and decedents, have some\nMOOP expenditures. Like most medical spending, MOOP\nspending among decedents is highly skewed, with the very top\nportion of the distribution incurring enormous costs. The con-\nditional mean expenditure in our sample of decedents is\nline of $8,259 for a single elderly person.\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics\nCharacteristics at Wave 1 Decedents Survivors\nNotes: Decedents are classified as people married in Wave 1 and dead by\nWave 2, but the spouse survives. Survivors are classified as people married to the\nsame person in Wave 1 and Wave 2.\nThere is a substantial difference between expenditures for\ndecedents and survivors, with survivors incurring costs that are\ncompared with $11,273. As the table illustrates, this difference\nis dramatic in the last few months of life, as captured by the exit\ninterview. For decedents, the conditional mean spending in the\nexit interview was $9,013, whereas for survivors, the Wave 2\nconditional mean was just $4,984. Recall that even this large\ndifference is an underestimate of the true gap because the Wave\n2 expenditures for survivors are for a 2-year period, whereas\nthose for decedents pertain to a necessarily shorter period. To\napproximate the true difference, assume the date of death is\nuniformly distributed between the two waves (i.e., the median/\nmean length of time covered by the exit interview is 1 year) and\nassume that expenditures are also uniformly distributed across\nthe 2 years; then, the $9,013 reflects expenditures for a single\nyear compared with single-year expenditures of $2,500 for\nsurvivors (one half the 2-year total of $4,984). This difference\nbetween average amounts for decedents and survivors is not\nthe result of a few outliers but rather runs through the entire\ndistribution; the median, 75th percentile, and 90th percentile for\nsurvivor expenditures are all substantially less than the same\npoint in the distribution for decedents.\nTable 3 reports MOOP expenditures for the two samples by\ntype of service. These data pertain to the exit interview for\ndecedents and to the Wave 2 interview for survivors. Medicare\ndoes not cover (most) nursing home stays, prescription drugs,\nor all physician charges (the $100 deductible and the 20%\ncopayment). Therefore, it is not surprising that MOOP expen-\nditures for these categories are quite common. A surprisingly\nsimilar fraction of decedents and survivors had out-of-pocket\namong decedents, the average expenditures were much larger.\nMOOP expenditures for drugs alone among the fraction with\npositive expenditures were $4,210 for decedents compared with\nFollowing prescription drug costs, the next most common\nMOOP expenditure was for insurance premiums, with 58.6% of\nthe decedents and 64.4% of survivors making premium pay-\nments. The largest difference between decedents and survivors\nrelates to long-term care. More than one-third of decedents had\nsome nursing home expense, with an average cost of $7,723.\nBy comparison, only 11% of survivors incurred costs for nurs-\ning home care, and even among this group, expenditures were\nsubstantially lower than for the decedents averaging just $5,487.\nBecause nursing home costs averaged roughly $43,000 for\nindividuals in both groups must have spent only a fraction of the\nyear in residence, on average, or had other means of funding.\nRelationship to Financial Resources\nIf medical care is a normal good, ceteris paribus, we would\nexpect that spending would increase with income and wealth.\nHowever, because insurance coverage alters the cost of care, if\npeople with more resources are more likely to hold insurance,\nthe relationship between income and wealth and actual MOOP\nexpenditures may be less clear. Similarly, rich respondents may\nbe healthier than poor, need less care, and therefore spend less.\nAlternatively, the availability of Medicaid coverage for low-\nincome elderly persons means that they may face substantially\nlower MOOP costs for the same amount of care.\nThe tabulations in Table 4 suggest little relationship between\nMOOP expenditures for the dying spouse and income or wealth\nof the couple but a strong relationship between financial status\nand the ratio of expenditures to resources. Respondents in the\nbottom income or wealth quartile are somewhat less likely to\nhave had MOOP expenditures than those in the higher quartiles,\nlikely owing to the higher probability of Medicaid coverage, but\nTable 3.

If\nelderly persons in the highest quartiles are, indeed, more likely to\nhave insurance to supplement Medicare, and if the insurer bears\nsome of the cost of additional treatments, then the similarity of\nspending across the three top quartiles may suggest that the\nwell-to-do are purchasing a substantially larger quantity of addi-\ntional care or perhaps more expensive services than the means in\nTable 4 suggest.\nIn contrast to the patterns for the level of spending, as a share\nof income, MOOP expenditures on the dying spouse are much\nlarger for low-income and low-wealth families. For the elders in\nthe bottom quartile of income (at Wave 1), MOOP spending in\nthe last years of life is equal to 70.5% of annual income. This\nshare declines monotonically to 50.8% for the second quartile\nand 29.8% for the third quartile. Even the highest-income group\nis not immune to spending large sums of money (relative to\nincome) on prescription drugs, nursing homes, and other ser-\nvices, with their total MOOP expenditures equal to almost one-\nfifth of annual income (18.3%).\nThe ratio of MOOP spending on the dying spouse to wealth is\nalso strongly negative. The least wealthy families have expenses\nequal to 82.8% of their wealth holdings, but this ratio falls\nquickly to 13.1% for the second quartile, 5.5% for the third, and\njust 1.6% among the highest. These differences suggest that\nMOOP expenditures are sufficiently large among the low-\nincome/low-wealth elderly population that they could have a\nsizable effect on the subsequent financial well-being of a sur-\nviving spouse.\nThis measure of MOOP expenses relative to income was\nconstructed by taking the ratio of the means of these two\nvariables. An alternative approach is to calculate the ratio of\nspending to income (or wealth) for each individual and then\nanalyze the distribution. This latter approach is more sensitive\nto outliers than the former, but it is a more widely used statistic\nand has the advantage of generating an entire distribution of\nrelative expenses. As shown in Table 5, for about one fourth of\nthose who die, MOOP expenses are relatively small, , 10% of\nincome. However, one half of decedents have MOOP ex-\npenditures of more than roughly one fourth (23.8%) of their\nannual income, and 20% spend . 62.5% of income. Because\nincome is reported on an annual basis and MOOP spending is\nthe total over as many as 3 years before death, a ratio of . 1.0\nis possible. Even in a single year, expenses can be greater than\nincome if assets are used to pay for the expenses or if the\nindividual/couple takes on debt. And, indeed, at the upper tail\nof the distribution, 11% of the sample had MOOP spending\nequal to . 1 full year of income (not shown).\nOf primary interest is the effect of these expenditures on the\nwell-being of the surviving spouse. Here we look not just at\nthose who lost a spouse between waves, who have been the\nTable 5.

The first two columns in\nTable 6 display the poverty rate, income, and wealth for elderly\npersons who are married and elderly persons who are widowed\nat the time of the second interview. The subsequent two columns\nreport the relevant statistics separately for the recently widowed\nand previously widowed. The gaps in income and wealth\nbetween the groups are large. Perhaps unsurprisingly, widows\nhave less than half the income and wealth of the married elderly,\nbut the recently widowed have much higher income and wealth\nthan those who were widowed at the initial interview. Mean\n``previous'' widows, respectively. The means for wealth are\nrespectively, again with large differences existing between\nrecent and previous widows. These differences are consistent\nwith the differential mortality hypothesis: that individuals with\nlow income/wealth die earlier than those with more resources,\ncreating widows with fewer resources than those whose spouses\nare still alive. However, it is also consistent with the idea that the\nlength of time spent in widowhood is itself a contributing cause\nof poverty (Weir, Willis, & Sevak, 2000). After years of rela-\ntively low income, a widow eventually spends down all avail-\nable assets and has little left to support herself. Despite the\nintuitive appeal, evidence from the first two waves of the\nAHEAD does not support this hypothesis; the poverty rate of\nthose previously widowed changed only modestly between\nadmittedly, this is a very short time period.\nAlthough the raw differences in the resources of married and\nwidowed respondents are large, on a per-capita basis, widows\nactually have similar income and wealth. However, the similarity\nof these averages is deceiving. As the second to last row of Table\n6 illustrates, the poverty rate of widows is over three times that of\nelderly couples, 21.9 versus 6.6%. This large difference in the\npoverty rate exists in part because of the assumptions about\nreturns to scale in consumption embedded in the definition of the\npoverty line: The federal poverty line for singles is 79% that of\ncouples, not 50% as this per-capita analysis assumes. Thus,\nsimilar resources per capita translate into substantially higher\npoverty rates. Again, the recently widowed fare somewhat better\nthan the previously widowed.\nWe now examine the factors accounting for the high rates of\npoverty among widows, focusing on the relative importance of\nthe roles of differential mortality and MOOP expenditures on\nthe dying spouse. Declines in income for other reasons such as\nreductions in Social Security income, pension income, or asset\nincome are left as a residual.\nPre-Widowhood Economic Status and Effects of\nWidowhood on Poverty\nTable 7 demonstrates the differences in poverty rates between\nsoon-to-be widowed respondents and couples in which both\nspouses survive. The table reports poverty rates and average\nincome in Wave 1 and Wave 2 for the two groups. The first goal\nof the analysis is to determine the effect of widowhood itself on\npoverty. One potential estimator is a simple pre/post comparison,\nthat is, a ``difference'' estimator. For those who were married in\nWave 1 and widowed in Wave 2, poverty rose from a first period\nmator of the effects of widowhood on poverty would imply that\nwidowhood is associated with an increase in poverty by 6.16\nHowever, the poverty rate changes over time, even for those\nwho were not widowed. Among the surviving couples in our\nsample, poverty declined from 6.34 to 6.10%, suggesting that the\nincrease in poverty associated with widowhood might have been\neven greater had underlying economic conditions not intervened.\nWe therefore take a ``difference-in-difference'' approach. The\nchange in poverty for continuously married couples was \u00c00.24\npercentage point. Because poverty rose by 6.16 percentage\npoints among widows, the difference-in-difference estimator im-\nplies that widowhood is associated with an increase in poverty\nthe simple first-differenced estimate. This 6.40-percentage point\nincrease translates into a 56.0% increase in poverty.\nTable 7 makes clear that a large gap in the relative well-being\nof widowed and nonwidowed elderly individuals existed prior\nto the death of the spouse. In Wave 1, the poverty rate was 11.43\nfor decedent couples and 6.34 for surviving couples, a difference\nof 5.09 percentage points. By Wave 2, the difference in poverty\nthe post-widowhood difference resulted from initial conditions.\nThe remaining 56% is due to other factors surrounding widow-\nhood, including MOOP spending on the dying spouse, other\nchanges in wealth, loss of the spouse's income, and assumed\nreturns to scale in consumption embedded in the poverty line.\nRole of Spouse's MOOP Spending in\nLast Years of Life\nMany of the poor widows in our sample were poor in Wave 1\nwhile their husbands were still alive. Our calculations indicate\nthat 39% percent of those in poverty in Wave 2 were also poor\nin Wave 1. However, for the majority of poor widows (56%),\npoverty accompanies widowhood. For those who do transit into\npoverty, how important are MOOP expenditures in these tran-\nsitions? From the tabulations presented earlier, it certainly\nseems as though these expenses could be sufficiently large rel-\nTable 7.

Here\nwe undertake a simulation to assess the potential for MOOP\nspending to alter well-being. We assume that all the money that\nwas used on MOOP spending for the decedent as reported in\nthe exit interview--that is, roughly the last year of life--would\nhave been available to the surviving spouse to spend over\nhis/her remaining life. To implement this change in financial\nresources, the total MOOP expenditures from the exit inter-\nview are amortized over the remainder of the widow's expected\nlife, and this amortized amount is added to the Wave 2 income\n(an interest rate of 4% was used for the calculation of amortized\nMOOP expenditures).\nThe mean value of MOOP spending from the exit interviews\nis approximately $9,000 and average life expectancy is roughly 9\nyears, yielding an average annual amortized amount of $1,156.\nBecause MOOP spending differs greatly across decedents and is\nhighly skewed, the additional income imputed to the surviving\nspouses also varies: The 25th and 75th percentiles of the distri-\nrespectively. When these individual-specific amounts are added\nto the Wave 2 income of the surviving spouses, the poverty rate\nfor these widows falls from 17.6% (as reported in Table 7,\ncolumn 6) to 15.9% (not shown in tables). This approach illus-\ntrates the potentially important effect of MOOP spending asso-\nciated with the dying spouse on the economic well-being of the\nsurviving spouse.\nAn alternative measure to the poverty rate is the poverty gap.\nThe poverty gap is the sum over all those in poverty of the\namount by which income falls below the poverty line, that is, the\nminimum amount of income that would need to be transferred to\npoor families to move them all out of poverty. To assess the role\nof MOOP spending in affecting well-being beyond the simple\nmovement across the poverty line, we also calculate the poverty\ngap with and without adding the amortized MOOP spending to\nWave 2 income. Doing so reduced the poverty gap by 28%,\nsimilar to the effect on poverty.\nDistribution of Declines in Income\nA final ``cause'' of poverty is the different returns to scale\nused for Social Security benefits and the poverty line. As noted\nearlier, a substantial amount of ``new poverty'' among widows\nexists because the poverty line for singles is equal to 79% of that\nfor couples, while Social Security (and many pensions) fall by\nmuch more. If we compare income before and after the death of\na spouse (including the amortized medical expenditures in post-\nwidowhood income), we find that 41% of the sample had\na decline in income of .33% (the expected change in Social\nSecurity benefits), 11% had a decline of between 20 and 33%,\nand 18% had a smaller decline. Twenty-nine percent had an\nincrease in income. This change in the poverty line when mov-\ning from a two- to one-person measure is somewhat arbitrary.\nWith a larger decrease in the needs level, fewer widows would\nbe counted among the poor, whereas with a smaller change,\nmore would be so classified. Similarly, if Social Security ben-\nefits were reduced by 21% rather than by one-third, the risk of\npoverty would be substantially lessened.\nTo move away from this single measure, we analyze the\neffect of MOOP expenditures on the dying spouse on the entire\ndistribution of income. Figure 2 displays the actual distribution\nof income in Wave 2 for our new widows, with the widows\nseparated into 10 deciles based on income in Wave 2.\nAmortized MOOP expenditures are then added to Wave 2\nincome, with the resulting income distribution displayed in the\nfigure. As expected, the distribution of income at the bottom\nimproves: The share with income less than $6,713 falls from 10\nto 7.5%. This vast improvement for low-income families is\nsurprising because one would have expected their costs to be\ncovered by Medicaid. There are also notable improvements at\nFigure 2. Distribution of income in Wave 2 with and without adjusting for medical out-of-pocket (MOOP) spending on the dying spouse.\nthe upper end of the income distribution, with the share of\nSUMMARY\nDespite improvements in income and poverty among the el-\nderly throughout the last century, nearly one-fourth of elderly\nwidows remain poor. Not only must widows deal with the\npsychological effects of losing their spouse, they must deal\nwith a precarious financial situation that often accompanies\nwidowhood. In fact, our estimates using the most recent na-\ntionally representative panel data suggest that widowhood\nper se is associated with a rise in poverty of between 6.2 and 6.4\npercentage points.\nPrevious researchers have emphasized changes in income\nand differential mortality. Here, we examined an alternative\navenue, the role of MOOP expenditures for a dying spouse.\nAlthough the Medicare program is extremely generous, it does\nnot provide coverage for all types of care; most notably, it does\nnot provide complete coverage for very long hospital stays or\nfor most long-term care needs. Furthermore, until 2006\nMedicare will not cover prescription drugs. These gaps leave\nmany elderly persons vulnerable to potentially large out-of-\npocket expenditures. Because such expenditures are likely to be\nlargest near death, the burden of paying for health care toward\nthe end of life may most severely affect the financial well-being\nof the surviving spouse. Thus, MOOP spending, and indirectly\nthe gaps in Medicare that leave such costs to the elderly\nindividual, may play a role in the high rates of poverty among\nwidows.\nWe find that, in fact, MOOP expenditures are particularly\nlarge at the end of life. Moreover, these MOOP expenditures are\nlarge relative to income, particularly among low-income elderly\nindividuals. For people in the lowest income quartile (i.e.,\nincome of below $12,000), this final MOOP spending is equal\nto approximately 70% of income. Moreover, we conclude that\nout-of-pocket medical expenditures can, indeed, cause a sharp\ndecline in the financial well-being of widows.\n"
