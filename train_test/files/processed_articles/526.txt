These incentives include up to\nfirst year of implementation if done in 2011 or\nReimbursement will be less if physicians implement\nEMRs after 2012. Furthermore, physicians who do\nnot demonstrate meaningful use of certified elec-\ntronic health records will receive deductions from\ntheir reimbursement for services provided to\nMedicare and Medicaid patients effective from\nAlthough implementation of EMRs among physi-\ncians is increasing, the rate of adoption has, until\nrecently, been relatively slow, especially among\nsmall and independent practices.10\u00ad12 Commonly\ncited barriers to establishing EMRs in the office\nsetting include initial costs and costs of mainten-\nance, concern over slowing of the physician's pace\nand workflow, uncertainty over which of the many\nEMR products and software is most user-friendly,\nand concerns over technical support and whether a\ngiven EMR program will become obsolete.13 14\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the\ntrends in EMR implementation among the various\nmedical specialties and office settings practicing\nwithin ambulatory medicine in the USA. By dem-\nonstrating which specialties and office settings\nhave had slower rates of adoption to date, the\nstudy seeks to identify targets for future incentive\nprograms.\nMETHODS\nWe used data from the National Ambulatory\nMedical Care Survey (NAMCS) to assess the use of\nally since 1989 from non-federal employed\nphysicians about outpatient visits in the USA. The\nNAMCS uses a multistage probability design to\nobtain its data. The first stage consists of obtaining\nsamples from 112 primary sampling units (PSU)\nout of the roughly 1900 such units into which the\n50 states and District of Columbia is divided. The\nsecond stage involves obtaining a sample of prac-\nticing physicians from each PSU. The final stage\nResearch and applications\nconsists of random samples of office visits from the practices of\nsample physicians. These sample physicians were divided into\n52 subsamples of physicians, each of which was randomly\nassigned a different 7-day reporting period. During these report-\ning periods, a random systematic sample of visits was selected.\nData are recorded by the physician or staff regarding the reason\nfor the visit, symptoms, diagnoses, medications prescribed and/\nor provided, and demographics of patients and the services pro-\nvided. Visits to hospitalists, anesthesiologists, pathologists, and\nradiologists are excluded from the NAMCS data. In the final\nreport, the number of survey responses by physician specialty\nwere adjusted according to the proportion of total physicians\nportion of physician visits with partial and full use of EMRs.\nThe year 2003 was chosen because a previous study using\nNAMCS data had demonstrated no change in EMR use from\nmedical specialties classified by the NAMCS. The NAMCS uses\nthe system of specialty classification defined by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics (NCHS), a separate system from\nthose used by the American Board of Medical Specialties or\nAmerican Medical Association.15 Full and/or partial use of\nEMRs is presented as a separate survey question from use of\nEMRs for billing. The NAMCS survey allowed physicians to\nstate they had full use, partial use, no use, or were unsure\nwhether they had use of EMRs.\nWe also assessed the influence of patient characteristics on\nEMR use. The NAMCS allows physicians to record patient\ncharacteristics such as age, gender, and race for each visit. We\nRace was divided into Caucasian, African-American, and other,\nwhich is consistent with the categories used by the NAMCS.\nFurther, we explored physician practice characteristics on\nEMR use. The NAMCS asked physicians, `Is this a solo prac-\ntice?' for which we divided the answers into `Yes' and `No'. We\nfurther analyzed the data to determine the proportion of solo\npractices by specialty, as we hypothesized that, if there was a sig-\nnificant difference in EMR use among specialties, the specialties\nwith lower frequencies of EMR use may have a higher propor-\ntion of solo practitioners. Our reasoning was that, if the cost of\nEMR was a barrier for implementation, solo practitioners may\nface larger barriers without other group members to share in\nthe costs.\nType of office setting for each visit was assessed by physician\nresponses to `Type of Office Setting for this Visit'. Responses\nwere divided into private practice, Health Maintenance\nOrganization (HMO), and others (community health center,\nmental health center, non-federal government clinic, and family\nplanning clinic). Employment status of the physician was also\nassessed, dividing the responses into owner of the practice or\nnon-owner.\nWe further analyzed differences in EMR use by geography.\nThe categories for geography included North, South, Midwest,\nand West based on the NAMCS methodology for grouping the\ngeographic regions of the ambulatory visits.\nBivariate analysis was performed using software to conduct\nlinear regression and 2 testing (SAS/STAT software, SAS\nInstitute). For multivariate analysis, a logistic regression was per-\nformed to explore the use of EMR among physician specialties,\nadjusting for physician specialty, year, practice ownership status,\noffice type, and geographic region (STATAV\nStation, Texas, USA). The logistic regression was weighted using\nthe NAMCS sampling and weighting scheme. For the purposes\nof logistic regression, `partial' and `full' EMR use were com-\nbined as using EMR. The office setting variable was categorized\nas HMO, private or group practice, and other. The study was\ndeclared exempt by the Wake Forest University Institutional\nReview Board.\nRESULTS\nBivariate analysis\noffice visits, which estimate the experience of 6.73 billion total\nambulatory visits.

Financial incentives will most likely continue to increase\nEMR adoption, and even the three lagging specialties had more\nthan doubled their EMR use since 2003. However, EMR use\namong the different medical specialties varied widely between\ntology, and psychiatry) significantly lagging behind the others.\nUptake of EMR among solo practitioners has been slower\nthan for non-solo practitioners. The three specialties with the\nlowest frequencies of EMR use were among the specialties with\nhighest rates of solo practitioners (figure 3). The likelihood of\nEMR adoption increases with the number of physicians in a\nmedical group.18 One recent study demonstrated that the use of\nphysicians.19 With the significant costs of EMR implementation\nand annual maintenance, solo practitioners may find it more dif-\nficult to share the costs of EMR than those in a group practice\nor those employed by larger organizations. However, gaps in\nEMR use may be narrowed by the reimbursements for EMR\nimplementation provided by the ARRA.\nA Congressional Budget Office (CBO) study suggested that\noffice-based providers may see little benefit to adopting EMRs\nbecause many of the administrative benefits that EMR is\ndesigned to create can only be seen by providers who are part\nof an integrated healthcare delivery system. In fact, the CBO\nfurther suggests that office-based providers may in fact lose\nmoney from EMRs.20 Another paper with a wide literature\nreview concluded that there were insufficient data to make cost-\neffectiveness conclusions regarding EMR adoption.1 Others\nhave demonstrated possible, but modest, financial benefits.13\nThe relatively small incentives available are perhaps insufficient\nto motivate physicians in some settings to adopt EMRs.\nAnother possible contributing factor to varying frequencies of\nEMR use among different specialties is that, until recently, many\nof the EMR software programs tended to be `one-size-fits-all'\nwith features and tabs that may be valuable for some specialties\nbut not others.21 Recently, however, software companies have\ndeveloped more specific EMR software programs for individual\nspecialties. It is unclear what effect, if any, these targeted EMR\nsoftware programs will have on EMR implementation rates in\nthe near future within these specialties. However, a recent study\nshowed that, as of 2011, intention to apply for EMR meaning-\nful use incentives still varied widely among specialties, from\nadoption of EMRs in psychiatry may be hampered by strict reg-\nulations governing privacy and security of behavioral health\nTable 2 Logistic regression results of electronic medical record\nuse adjusting for physician specialty, region, office setting, payment\nsource, and year\nVariable OR 95% CI p Value\nSpecialty\nGeneral and family practice (Ref) \u00ad \u00ad\nPractice region\nNortheast (Ref) \u00ad \u00ad\nPhysician employment status\nEmployee/contractor (Ref) \u00ad \u00ad\nOffice type\nHMO or other prepaid practice (Ref) \u00ad \u00ad\nPrimary payment source\nPrivate insurance (Ref) \u00ad \u00ad\nYear dummy\nYear 2006 was omitted because of collinearity.\nFigure 4 Proportion of electronic medical record (EMR) use by\npractice ownership.\nResearch and applications\nrecords. System integration, such as image management solu-\ntions for ophthalmology and dermatology, appears to be\nanother specialty-specific obstacle. Thus, skepticism about the\nbenefits of EMRs seems to persist in the slower-adopting spe-\ncialties despite new features and incentives.\nOne limitation of this study is that the NAMCS has\nup-to-date publicly available data through 2010, which cannot\nexamine the full effects of the federal government's incentives\ntoward EMR adoption, much of which started to occur in late\n2009. These incentives will probably continue the increased use\nof EMRs; recent NCHS studies estimate that the overall fre-\nalso did not examine year-by-year trends within each specialty,\nallowing for the possibility that a specialty has more recently\nmade significant strides toward EMR uptake that may not be\nreflected by a significantly lower overall frequency of EMR use\nvided, so the NAMCS does not permit assessment of gener-\national differences in EMR adoption patterns. The general\nquestion asked in the survey about full or partial EMR use\ndoes not show whether use is sufficient to meet meaningful use\ncriteria.\nEMRs have the potential to enhance organization, lower costs\nin some settings, and reduce errors. However, industry experts\ncontend that the EMR software market lacks a clear leader or\nstandard bearer because EMR design and usability is still devel-\noping.25 While universal EMR implementation ultimately seems\ninevitable, adopting EMRs simply for the sake of adoption may\nprove to be detrimental, as evidenced by a 2001 study which\nillustrated physician disenchantment and significant time and\nautonomy concerns after 6 months' use of EMR.26 Other\nstudies since that time have suggested wider acceptance and sat-\nisfaction with EMRs. However, although EMR software has a\nhigh probability of improving care and workflow, its adoption\ncannot in and of itself guarantee what it has been touted to\ndo.27 28 Although the theoretical benefits of EMRs are convin-\ncing, two recent studies demonstrated that EMRs have not yet\nsignificantly improved quality of care.29 30\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor physicians who are looking to implement EMRs, there are\nmany potentially positive reasons for doing so: better coordination\nof patient care, organization of patient files, improvement in pro-\nviding preventative services, reduction of redundant laboratory\ntests, and drug interaction warnings--to name a few. With federal\nincentives through 2014, much of the cost of EMRs can be offset\nby demonstrating meaningful use of EMRs. However, EMRs are\nclearly continuing to evolve, and will undoubtedly improve as phy-\nsicians provide more feedback and market forces support the soft-\nware that demonstrates ease of use and better patient care. This\nstudy suggests that there are significant discrepancies in EMR use\namong specialties and physician office characteristics which\nprovide an opportunity for both physicians and EMR developers\nto address, and for government to design appropriate incentives.\nFor now, physicians should carefully weigh whether the impact of\nEMRs on patient care and reimbursement for EMR adoption\njustify entering `uncharted' territory.\nContributors ABF takes full responsibility for the integrity of the data and\nanalysis.
