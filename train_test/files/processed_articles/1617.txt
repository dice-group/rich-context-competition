Mannan1, Asnawi Abdullah1, Christopher M.\nReid1, John J. McNeil1 and Anna Peeters1\nThe nature of excess body weight may be changing over time to one of greater central adiposity. The aim of this\nstudy is to determine whether BMI and waist circumference (WC) are increasing proportionately among population\nsubgroups and the range of bodyweight, and to examine the public health implications of the findings. Our data are\nfrom two cross-sectional surveys (the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Studies (NHANES) in 1988\u00ad1994\nage, race-ethnicity, and education). The increase in WC was more than could be attributed simply to increases in BMI.\nThis independent increase in WC (of on average, 0.9cm) was consistent across the different BMI categories, sexes,\neducation levels, and race-ethnicity groups. It occurred in younger but not older age groups. Overall in each BMI\ncategory, the prevalence of low-risk WC decreased and the prevalence of increased-risk or substantially increased-\nrisk WC increased. These results suggest that the adverse health consequences associated with obesity may be\nincreasingly underestimated by trends in BMI alone. Since WC is closely linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes,\nit is important to know the prevailing trends in both of these parameters.\nshort communications\n \nOther variables\nIn addition to BMI and WC, other variables included in this analysis are\nsex, age group, education, and race-ethnicity.\nAnalysis\nWe calculated the mean WC and BMI in each survey. Analyses were\nstratified by sex, age group, and race-ethnicity and analyzed in SAS\n(SAS version 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Linear regression exam-\nined changes in the level of WC for a given level of BMI. The analysis\naccounted for the complex, multistage, cluster sampling design by\nusing the Taylor expansion method to estimate sampling errors of\nestimators (8).\nResults\nMean age and sex were similar across the surveys, as were the\nresponse rates. Overall, the proportion of non-Hispanic whites\nincreased and the proportion of non-Hispanic blacks and\nMexican Americans decreased. The proportion \ncompleting\nhigh school increased.\nand WC were observed. Mean BMI increased from 27.1 to\nAfter adjusting for sex, age, race-ethnicity, and education,\nand WC by 4.7cm. After additional adjustment for BMI, WC\nadjusting for WC, there was no significant change in BMI\nThere were independent increases in WC in all three BMI\nthe normal-weight, overweight, and obese groups had WC 0.6,\nsimilar independent WC increases in both sexes, education\nlevels, and in the three most common race-ethnicity groups.\nInteractions with age group were statistically significant. There\nwere independent increases in WC in those aged 20\u00ad49 years\nbut not those aged 50+ years. The consequences of this was\nWithin each BMI category the proportion of higher-risk WC\nChange in WC (cm)\n(95% CI) over and above\nchanges in BMI\nMean WC\nBMI categories\nAge groupa\nSex\nEducation\nRace-ethnicity\nAdjustment for age, sex, race-ethnicity, education, and BMI.\nCI, confidence interval; WC, waist circumference.\naChanges differ significantly by age group. bSignificant increase in WC independent of BMI.\nshort communications\n \nof those aged <50 years in the normal-weight BMI category,\n3.0% of men and 29.5% of women had an increased-risk or\nincreased to 5.9 and 43.0%, respectively. Similarly, whereas in\nfemales aged <50 years with substantially-increased-risk WC\nand 33.4%, respectively. The proportion of obese males and\nfemales aged <50 years without a substantially-increased-risk\nDiscussion\naverage increase of 0.9cm in the WC of American adults over\nand above that for BMI. This independent increase occurred\nin all BMI categories, in both sexes, education levels and in\nthe three most common race-ethnicity groups. However, it\noccurred in younger but not older people.\nThe consequence of these differential changes in weight\nand WC was that within each of the normal-weight, over-\nweight, and obese BMI categories the proportion of those\nwith higher-risk WC increased for males and females aged\n<50 years. The apparent greater association of WC than BMI\nwith metabolic risk (3,4) may mean that overall in each BMI\ncategory, the prevalence of having a low-risk WC decreased\nand the prevalence of an increased-risk or substantially\nincreased-risk WC increased. These changes affected the\nnormal-weight category as well as the overweight and obese\nBMI categories.\nOur findings are consistent with a number of studies that\nhave suggested an independent increase in WC over and\nabove that for BMI (1,9\u00ad12). However, some of these studies\nare based on differences in the percentage change in BMI and\nWC, which does not inform whether one indicator has moved\nindependently further than the other, due to the nature of the\nrelationship between BMI and WC. In our analysis, while there\nwas a marginally greater percentage change in BMI (5.9%)\nthan WC (5.1%), we demonstrated that increases in WC were\ngreater than expected based on increases in BMI. Elobeid et al.\nconducted the only study to specifically look at increases in\nWC independent of increases in BMI (1). The strengths of our\nstudy are that we looked at the increase in WC independent of\nincreases in BMI over a range of demographic groups, and that\nwe quantified these absolute changes in WC.\nThere were no differences in sampling design between the\nsurveys and the survey response rates were similar, reduc-\ning the impact of bias from these sources. The discrepancy\nbetween the total sample size and the number of participants\nfor whom data were analyzed--due to participants missing\nheight, weight, WC, and/or education variables--is likely\nto incur bias. Nonresponse has been associated with having\na higher body weight and lower socioeconomic status (also\nassociated with a higher body weight in high-income coun-\ntries) (13,14). However, it is unlikely that this bias would\naffect the key finding of this paper of an independent increase\nof WC over and above the increase in BMI. That the mean\nWC values are close to the cut-points for abdominal obesity\ncould explain why a small increase in WC could lead to a large\nincrease in the prevalence of increased risk WC (9). However,\nthis appears not to be the case in this study as we have used\nlinear regression to explore the continuous changes in WC\nover and above BMI.\nChanging ethnic makeup may explain the changes in\nbody fat distribution; however, we obtained similar results\nafter stratifying by race-ethnicity. Other possible con-\ntributors include declining physical activity levels, sleep\ndeprivation, stress, endocrine disruptors, and certain\npharmaceuticals (15).\nThe changes occurred for all races, education levels, sexes,\nand body weights, including in people considered \"normal\nweight.\" The nature of the changes suggest that using solely\nBMI to monitor the impact of increasing weight status in\nthe population may lead to an underestimation of the asso-\nciated health burden. That the independent increase in WC\nhas been shown in people aged <50 years but not older age\ngroups suggests that the changes in our environment have\nimpacted more on younger adults, or that they are the result\nof more recent environmental changes.\nThe findings suggest that within each BMI category the\nmean WC has increased. To date these independent changes\nhave been restricted to younger people. Considering the asso-\nciation between WC and the level of metabolic risk, the sole\nuse of BMI to monitor the impact of increasing population\nweight may lead to an underestimation of the obesity-related\nhealth burden.\n"
