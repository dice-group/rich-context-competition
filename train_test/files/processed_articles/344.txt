These gender differences increased with\nage and were greatest among the 75 to 85 year old group:\nsexually active had a good quality sex life, and 41.2%\nversus 11.4% were interested in sex. Men and women\nreporting very good or excellent health were more likely to\nbe sexually active comparedwith their peers in poor or fair\nhealth: age adjusted odds ratio 2.2 (P<0.01) for men and\nlife study. Among sexually active people, good health was\nalso significantly associated with frequent sex (once or\nmore weekly) in men (adjusted odds ratio 1.6 to 2.1), with\na good quality sex life among men and women in the\nmidlife cohort (adjusted odds ratio 1.7), and with interest\nin sex. People in very good or excellent health were 1.5 to\n1.8 times more likely to report an interest in sex than\nthose in poorer health. At age 30, sexually active life\n6 years for women at age 55. This gender disparity\nattenuated for people with a spouse or other intimate\npartner. At age 55, men in very good or excellent health on\naverage gained 5-7 years of sexually active life compared\nwith their peers in poor or fair health. Women in very good\nor excellent health gained 3-6 years compared with\nwomen in poor or fair health.\nConclusion Sexual activity, good quality sexual life, and\ninterest in sex were higher for men than for women and\nthis gender gap widened with age.

Effective treatment of this\ncondition is likely to extend the duration of sexually\nactive life for men and their partners as they age.\nProblems with sexual functioning are prevalent\namong older adults in the United States and other\ncountries.1 7 About half of all sexually active men and\nwomen aged 57-85 in the United States report at least\none bothersome sexual problem; one third report at\nleast two. Yet doctors rarely address sexual concerns\nin older adults, particularly in women.1 As the older\npopulation grows in developed and developing\nnations,8 projecting the population structure of sexual\nactivity is useful for anticipating need for public health\nresources, expertise, and services related to maintain-\ning sexual function, regaining sexual function lost as a\nconsequence of disease or treatments for common\nmedical conditions that occur in later life, and prevent-\ning sexually transmitted diseases or risky sexual\n1Department of Obstetrics and\nGynaecology, University of\nand Chicago Core on Biomeasures\nin Population-Based Aging\nResearch, University of Chicago\nCentre on Demography and\nEconomics of Aging\n2Department of Medicine, Section\nof Geriatrics, University of Chicago\nCorrespondence to: S Tessler\nLindau slindau@uchicago.edu\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 11\nbehaviour among older adults. Population estimates of\nsexual activity in later life can help motivate and\ninform the design of policies pertaining to sexual\nexpression and rights among cognitively impaired\nand institutionalised elderly people. In addition,\nexpectations about the duration of sexually active life\nmay influence important health behaviours. For exam-\nple, patients may be motivated to stop smoking or to\nadhere to drug regimens if the behaviour changes are\nexpected to prolong or preserve a sexually active or\nsexually satisfying life.\nUsing two nationally representative datasets, we\nexamined the association between sexuality (sexual\nactivity and quality of sexual life) and global self rated\nphysical health in middle aged and older men and\nwomen. We also estimated the average remaining\nyears of sexually active life gained as a result of good\nhealth, using sexually active life expectancy, a new\nhealth expectancy indicator for clinical and public\nhealth application.\nMETHODS\nThe study populations were drawn from two large,\npublicly available and nationally representative recent\nhealth surveys with sufficiently large numbers of older\nrespondents and comparable data on sexuality: the\nnational survey of midlife development in the United\nStates (MIDUS, or midlife cohort) and the national\nsocial life, health and aging project (NSHAP, or later\nlife cohort).\nrepresentative data on adults aged 25 to 74. Partici-\npants were selected by using a random digit dial sam-\nple of the non-institutionalised, English speaking\npopulation of the 48 conterminous United States. Par-\nticipants completed a telephone interview and postal\nquestionnaire. The response rate was 60.8%, with\nparts of the survey.

Details on\nthe design, field procedures, and sampling weights\nhave been described previously.1 Both datasets are\navailable to researchers through the National Archive\nof Computerized Data on Aging collection (www.\nicpsr.umich.edu/NACDA/). This analysis uses ver-\nsion 1.4 of the NSHAP dataset.\nMeasures\nSelf rated health is widely regarded as an appropriate\nmeasure of health, correlating well with other mea-\nsures of morbidity and survival.10 11 In both MIDUS\nand NSHAP, respondents were asked to rate their phy-\nsical health using the standard five point scale\nresponses to the question: \"Would you say your health\nis excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\" Both sur-\nveys included measures of partnership, sexual activity,\nsexual frequency, quality of sexual life, and interest in\nsex. Additionally, NSHAP assessed the degree to\nwhich sex was regarded an important part of life.\nTable 1 summarises and compares the items used in\neach survey.\nNSHAP defined sexual activity for respondents as\n\"any mutually voluntary activity with another person\nthat involves sexual contact, whether or not inter-\ncourse or orgasm occurs.\" MIDUS defined sexual\nactivity broadly as having \"had sex with anyone.\" In\nidentified as heterosexual, or \"sexually attracted only\nto the opposite sex.\" In NSHAP, 96.4% of men and\n95.0% of women reported only heterosexual contacts\nduring their lifetime.\nNon-response to items in both surveys was low for\nmeasures of sexual activity, quality, and, in MIDUS,\nsexual interest (0.3% to 5.1%). Non-response for the\nNSHAP questions about sexual interest ranged from\n7.4% to 11.3%. Non-response to questions on sexuality\nwas higher among women compared with men and\nolder people compared with younger people. For a\nrandom subset of NSHAP respondents, these ques-\ntions were modularised to a questionnaire that was\nself completed after the face to face interview and\nreturned by post to the investigators. In general, non-\nresponse to items was the same or higher for questions\nasked on this questionnaire compared with identical\nquestions asked face to face. Overall, 84% of respon-\ndents returned the questionnaire.13\nStatistical analysis\nDistributions of race, education, marital status, self\nrated health, and sexuality variables are summarised\nseparatelyby genderforMIDUS andNSHAP.We car-\nried out analyses for each dataset separately to estab-\nlish external validity of the findings.\nWe used logistic regression14 to model the likelihood\nof being sexually active, having a good quality sex life,\nand being interested in sex. These models included age\ngroup and self rated health (excellent or very good,\ngood, and fair or poor) as covariates, which were fit\nseparately by gender. Models for quality of sex life\nand frequency of sex were fit for participants who had\na spouse or other intimate partner. We present results\nas odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, indicat-\ning the multiplicative change in the odds of the\nRESEARCH\npage 2 of 11 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\noutcome associatedwith a particular age or health cate-\ngory compared with those of the baseline category.\nFor all analyses we used weights to adjust for differ-\nential probabilities of selection and differential non-\nresponse. Standard errors were computed using the\nlinearisation method,15 taking into account the stratifi-\ncation and clustering of the sample design. P values are\ntwo sided. Analyses were done using Stata software,\nrelease 9.\nCalculation of sexually active life expectancy\nPopulation health is often summarised using measures\nof health expectancy. The concept of healthy life expec-\ntancy is typically based on self rated measures of overall\nor global health and is an effective tool for quantifying\ndifferences in health between populations.16 Related\nconcepts include active life expectancy based on activ-\nities of daily living, disability-free life expectancy based\non disability measures, dementia-free life expectancy,\nand others.16-21 These indicators project future health\nbased on health or function at baseline. No such mea-\nsures account for sexual function or sexual activity in\nprojecting future health expectancy. We introduce a\nnew health expectancy concept, sexually active life\nexpectancy, defined as the average number of years\nremaining spent as sexually active, and investigate its\nrelation to health among middle aged and older\nwomen and men.\nWe calculated sexually active life expectancy by Sul-\nlivan's method, using publicly available data from life\ntables and prevalence data on sexual activity to divide\nthe number of person years into years with and without\nsexual activity.22 23 We obtained US age and gender\nspecific population and death counts for 1995 and\nculated age specific person years using standard meth-\nods for life tables.22 Prevalence data on sexual activity\nfrom MIDUS and NSHAP by age, gender, partnership\nstatus, and health status were used to calculate sexually\nactive life expectancy. Life tables for 1995 (the year of\nenrolment of the midlife cohort) and 2004 (the year for\nwhich data were available closest to the 2005 enrol-\nment of the later life cohort) were used in conjunction\nwith MIDUS and NSHAP data, respectively. Using\nguidelines provided by the International Network on\nHealthExpectancy22 we calculatedstandarderrorsand\nconfidence intervals for sexually active life expec-\ntancy. The proportion of life spent as sexually active\nmeans the proportion of years of any sexual activity\nwith a partner out of all remaining years of life.\nTaking into account that a substantial proportion of\nthe older population lives in institutions, we adjusted for\nnosexual activityamong such a population. This adjust-\nment decreased sexually active life expectancy mea-\nsured at age 55 years by 2% for men and women. A\nsensitivity analysis, assuming a 20% rate of sexual activ-\nity among the institutionalised elderly population, had\nTable 1 | Comparison of health and sexuality measures used in national survey of midlife development in the United States (MIDUS) and national social life,\nhealth and ageing project (NSHAP)\nSelf reported physical health \"Would you say your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\" \"Would you say your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\"\nPartnership Respondents who were married or cohabiting at time of survey, even if\nthey were not sexually active, were defined as having a partner\nRespondents who were married or cohabiting at time of survey, even if they\nwere not sexually active, were defined as having a partner\nSexual activity Respondents who had had sex with at least one partner in previous six\nmonths were considered to be sexually active\nRespondents who had had sex with at least one partner in previous\n12 months were considered to be sexually active*\nFrequency of sex \"Over the past six months, on average, how often have you had sex with\nsomeone?\" Responses ranged from: \"never or not at all\" to \"two or more\ntimes a week.\" Respondents having sex 2-3 times a month or more were\ndefined as having sex regularly\n\"During the last 12 months, about how often did you have sex with\n[partner]?\" Responses ranged from \"once a month or less\" to \"once a day or\nmore.\" Respondents having sex 2-3 times a month or more were defined as\nhaving sex regularly\nQuality of sex life:\nPositive physical quality NA \"How physically pleasurable did/do you find your relationship with\n[partner] to be: extremely pleasurable, very pleasurable, moderately\npleasurable, slightly pleasurable, or not at all pleasurable?\" Individuals\nwho reported their most recent relationship to be extremely or very\npleasurable were defined as having a good quality of physical sexual life\nPositive emotional quality NA \"How emotionally satisfying did/do you find your relationship with\n[partner]: extremely satisfying, very satisfying, moderately satisfying,\nslightly satisfying, or not at all satisfying?\" Individuals who reported their\nmost recent relationship to be extremely or very satisfying were defined as\nhaving a good quality of emotional sexual life\nOverall good quality \"How would you rate the sexual aspect of your life these days?\" Responses\nranged from 0, \"the worst possible situation,\" to 10, \"the best possible\nsituation.\" Individuals with a rating of 6 were considered to have an\noverall good quality of sexual life\nIndividuals having good quality of both physical and emotional\ncomponents of sexual life were considered to have an overall good quality\nof sexual life\nInterest in sex \"How much thought and effort do you put into the sexual aspect of your\nlife?\" Responses ranged from 0, \"none,\" to 10, \"very much.\" Respondents\nwith rating of 6 were considered to be interested in sex\nEstimated using the following question: \"About how often do you think\nabout sex?\" with six variants ranging from \"never\" to \"several times a day.\"\nRespondents who reported thinking about sex \"one to a few times a week\"\nor more were considered to be interested in sex\n*A 12 month, rather than 6 month, time frame was used in consideration of older age of NSHAP population, and for comparability to only other comprehensive, nationally representative\nstudy of adult sexuality in the United States.12\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 3 of 11\nno effect on final estimates for sexually active life expec-\ntancy (data not shown).

Using two data-\nsets, the study affirmed a positive association between\nlater life health and both sexual partnership and any\nsexual activity. In addition, a consistently strong asso-\nciation was found between good health and other\ndomains of sexuality not previously linked to health\nin later life, including the frequency of sexual activity\n(weekly or more often) in men, a good quality sex life,\nand a higher interest in sex. Sexual activity, a good\nquality sex life, and interest in sex were higher for\nmen than for women and this gender gap widened\nwith age.

This finding reflects the\nlonger life span of women, the age structure of mar-\nriage in the United States and other countries whereby\nmen tend to marry younger women, and the higher\nproportion of older men with much younger\npartners.1 27 28 As found by others, men and women\nwith partners in middle and later life were equally\nlikely to be sexually active, but the frequency of sexual\nactivity declined across age groups for women more\nthan for men.29 Many sexually active people in this\nstudy rated the quality of their sex life as less than\ngood, including about half of sexually active older\nwomen. Particularly little has been known about the\nquality of older women's sexual lives.\nSexually active life expectancy was calculated as a\nfunction of gender and health. Overall, the study found that men live a significantly greater proportion\nof their adult life as sexually active (due at least in part\nto more years of partnership than women) yet lose sig-\nnificantly more years of sexually active life as a result of\npoor health than do women. This resonates with find-\nings from a previous analysis using the NSHAP data-\nset, showing that men's physical health problems were\nmost commonly cited by both sexes as the reason for\nsexual inactivity in later life.1 The stronger association\nbetween sexually active life expectancy and health\nfound in men may be explained in part by the effects\nof common chronic illnesses (for example, diabetes,\ncardiovascular disease, prostate cancer) and their treat-\nments on erectile function.30-34 Loss of erectile function\ndiminishes or prohibits penetrative intercourse and is\noften accompanied by a decline in or cessation of a\nman's sexual activity and sexual satisfaction.35 36\nIn contrast, the effects of illness or drug use on sexual\nfunction in women are poorly understood. Sexual pro-\nblems, including low desire, vaginal dryness, difficul-\nties with orgasm, and pain with intercourse are\nprevalent among sexually active older women,1 are\nassociated with decreased sexual satisfaction,35 but\ntypically do not render a woman physically incapable\nof sexual intercourse. Women's sexual interest or\nmotivation may be more resilient to illness or sexual\nproblems than men's,37 may be more contextually\ndependent on the partner or situational factors,38 or,\nas seen in younger populations, older women may\nhave less agency over their sexual activity than\nInterest in sex among women of the same age in the\ntwo nationally representative cohorts surveyed\n10 years apart was relatively stable. In contrast, signifi-\ncantly more men aged 57-64 in the later life cohort\nreported an interest in sex than men of the same age\nsurveyed 10 years earlier. This was true for men with\nand without a partner in both cohorts and corroborates\na positive secular trend in attitudes about sex found\nstudy of 70 year olds in Gothenburg, Sweden.28 The\ndifference may partly reflect the introduction of the\nhighly effective and widely promoted male erectile\ndysfunction drugs to the US and European markets,\nTable 5 | Association with self rated health for selected measures of sexuality.

Interpretation of comparisons\nacross the two studies must also take into account dif-\nferences in the wording of some questions, such as\nthose pertaining to quality of sex life and sexual inter-\nest. Although overall non-response to items was low in\nboth surveys, older respondents and women were\nmore likely than others to refuse to answer questions\non sexuality. It is unclear from previous research\nwhether such refusals would tend to underestimate or\noverestimate sexual activity in these groups.44 45\nBecause of the study population, these findings may\nbe limited in relevance to lesbian, gay, and other peo-\nple who do not identify as heterosexual, and to non-\nWestern cultures. Further research is needed; the pub-\nlic availability of the instruments used for NSHAP and\nMIDUS provides an opportunity for adaptation of this\nresearch to other communities.\nThe calculation of the sexually active life expectancy\nmeasures used the Sullivan method, which generally\nprovides a good measure of the current composition\nof a population but is not based on transition rates\nbetween sexually active and non-active states.46 The\nSullivan method has been shown to produce estimates\nof health expectancy comparable to more advanced\nmultistate approaches for populations with smooth\nand gradual changes in disability and morbidity, as is\nthe case in the US population.47 Similarly, the distribu-\ntion of sexual activity by age group across the two\ncohortssurveyed 10years apart was noticeably similar.\nIn this study we assumed the same mortality for people\nwith different health and partnership statuses. This\nassumption might underestimate sexually active life\nexpectancy for those with very good or excellent\nhealth or for those with a partner and might overesti-\nmate sexually active life expectancy for those with\npoor or fair health owing to the possibility of differen-\ntial survival among people with different health sta-\ntuses and partnership.48 49 Our analytical approach\nused official life tables to predict mortality accurately\nbut was limited by the lack of accessible and reliable\nage and gender specific estimates of survival by health\nand partnership status.\nConclusions and policy implications\nSexual partnership, frequency of sexual activity, a good\nquality sex life, and interest in sex are positively asso-\nciated with health among middle aged and older adults\nin the United States. Interest in sex among middle aged\nand older men in the United States has increased since\n2000. Overall, the study found that men have a longer\nsexually active life expectancy and that most sexually\nactive men report a good quality sex life. In contrast,\nonly about half of sexually active women reported a\ngood quality sex life. This disparity, and its implication\nfor health, requires further exploration.\nMen lose more years of sexually active life as a result\nof poor health than women. The estimation of sexually\nactive life expectancy is a new life expectancy tool that\ncan be used for projecting public health and patient\nneeds in the arena of sexual health. Projecting the\npopulation patterns of sexual activity in later life is use-\nful for anticipating need for public health resources,\nexpertise, and medical services. Translation of expec-\ntations about the duration and quality of sexually\nactive life may, at the individual level, influence impor-\ntant health behaviours to promote or prolong sexual\nfunctioning, such as adherence to medical treatment\nor maintenance of a healthy lifestyle. One study\nfound that parents of children with cancer exhibited\ndifferent medical decision making and healthcare uti-\nlisation when they had more accurate expectations of\ntheir child's life expectancy.50 Further research is\nneeded to evaluate the potential impact of sexually\nactive life expectancy projection on individual health\nbehaviour.\nWe thank Andreea Mihai, Jessica Schwartz, and Katherine Githens for\nresearch assistance.
