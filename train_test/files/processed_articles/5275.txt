    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article identifies cultural models of osteoporosis, as shared by community-dwelling older women in southeastern\nAustralia, and compares these with cultural knowledge conveyed through social marketing. Cultural models are mental\nconstructs about specific domains in everyday life,such as health and illness,which are shared within a community. We applied\ndomain analyses to data obtained from in-depth interviews and stakeholder-identified print materials.The response domains\nidentified from our case studies made up the shared cultural model \"Osteoporosis has low salience,\" particularly when\nranked against other threats to health.The cultural knowledge reflected in the print materials supported a cultural model\nof low salience. Cultural cues embedded in social marketing messages on osteoporosis may be internalized and motivating\nin unintended ways. Identifying and understanding cultural models of osteoporosis within a community may provide valuable\ninsights to inform the development of targeted health messages.\n",

Sustaining an initial vertebral frac-\nture is said to increase the risk of subsequent fracture\neach fracture event sustained is thought to be associated\nwith excess morbidity and mortality (Pasco et al., 2005).\nOsteoporosis is estimated to cost the Australian taxpayer\nsome AU$7 billion a year (The Royal Australian College\nof General Practitioners, 2010). Most people who have\nosteoporosis do not know it (Taylor, Gill, Phillips, & Leach,\n2003), which represents a lost opportunity for timely help-\nseeking and behavioral change to mitigate risk of fracture\nand its sequelae. Furthermore, the large numbers of people\nclassified as being at \"modest risk\" in fact sustain more than\nhalf of all fractures occurring in the community (Pasco\net al., 2006)--that is, outside of hospital or community care\nsettings--suggesting that public health measures that moti-\nvate behavioral change may be more effective in preventing\nfracture than attempting to provide medical therapy to such\na high proportion of the overall population.\nHowever, the statistics indicate that these measures are\nnot universally effective. For example, a large Australian\npopulation survey reported that men and women across\nall age groups not only underestimated the risk of getting\nosteoporosis in the future but also had little knowledge of the\ndisease and its risk factors (Taylor et al., 2003). This study of\n3,001 randomly selected adults found that the overall\nperceived risk of getting osteoporosis was low (59.7%) or\nmoderate (40.6%). This knowledge gap occurs elsewhere;\nworldwide, osteoporosis remains largely undiagnosed\n(Taylor et al., 2003) and underinvestigated (Cheng & Green,\nreported in Australia and internationally that prescription\nrates for osteoporosis treatments, as well as adherence to\ntreatment, are suboptimal (Cadarette, Gignac, Jaglal, Beaton,\nexample, a 2007 systematic review found a wide variation\ntreatment at 12 months (Cramer, Gold, Silverman, &\nUnderstanding how consumers in specific sociocultural\nsettings view a given health problem is essential in develop-\ning effective, targeted social marketing messages to influ-\nence positive health behaviors and health-seeking (Mostow\n1The University of Melbourne, Australia\n2Copenhagen University, Denmark\n3The University of Queensland,Toowoomba, Australia\n4Barwon Health, Geelong, Australia\n5Deakin University, Geelong, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nRen\u00e9e Otmar, Department of Medicine, Northwest Academic Centre,\nWestern Section, The University of Melbourne, Sunshine Hospital, 176\nFurlong Road, St.Albans,Victoria 3021, Australia\nEmail: rotmar@barwonhealth.org.au; renee@otmarmiller.com.au\nA Cultural Models Approach to\nOsteoporosis Prevention andTreatment\nRen\u00e9e Otmar1, Susanne D.

In this article, we compare cultural models of\nosteoporosis shared among older women in the study region\nwith those embedded in social marketing messages on\nosteoporosis.\nMaterials and Method\nNote that we use the term \"consumer\" in reference to adult\nmembers of the general community, regardless of whether\nthey are consumers of health services, after Buckley and \u00d3\nTuama's call for an expansion of \"the notion of the health\nservice user to include those who may not be directly using\nthe health service, but who are consuming health messages\"\nappropriate to refer to participants in the community case\nstudy as \"patients\" or \"clients\"; all participants in the study\ncould be considered consumers of health messages, a central\ntopic in this article.\nSocial marketing approaches typically rely on theories of\nconsumer behavior such as the health belief model, theory of\nreasoned action/planned behavior, and social cognitive the-\nory; however, there is little consensus on which models are\nmost appropriate for particular populations and problems\n(Lefebvre, 2000), and little is understood about how con-\nsumers' experiences of a particular disease or condition can\nbe utilized to complement these theoretical models and thus\nenhance social marketing approaches (Barg & Grier, 2008).\nA cultural models approach provides an inductive method by\nwhich to understand consumer responses to health commu-\nnications in the domain of interest (Barg & Grier, 2008).\nUnderpinning the cultural models approach are two related\ntheories about the nature of knowledge and meaning: (a) that\nas human beings, we each uniquely attribute meaning to phe-\nnomena, as well as to our own existence within the world\n(social constructivism), and (b) that the world holds no\nmeaning prior to our experience of it (social construction-\nto explore participants' perspectives as individuals and as\nactors within their society/community, since the two roles\nare separate, yet deeply connected.\nHawkins, Kreuter, Resnicow, Fishbein, and Dijkstra (2008)\ndescribed three distinct categories on a continuum of tech-\nniques used in health communications: mass communication,\ntargeting, and tailoring. At the one end, mass communication\nbroadcasts identical messages to \"relatively large, undifferen-\nconsidered less than ideal in communicating about a condition\nsuch as osteoporosis, since the message may not be relevant to\nlarge segments of the broadcast audience, and those segments\nof the audience for whom it may be relevant could assume that\nthe messages are intended for others, or at least not for them.\nAt the other end of the continuum, tailoring customizes mes-\nsages \"matched to the needs and preferences of individuals\"\nhealth messages are better read and recalled than nontailored\nmessages (Kreuter, Oswald, Bull, & Clark, 2000), it would\nappear to be an ideal technique for communicating with\npeople who need to be provided with relevant information\nabout osteoporosis, but is understandably expensive in terms\nof cost and effort required to gather and maintain data from\nand about the intended audience (Hawkins et al., 2008).\nTargeting presents a middle-ground technique for communi-\ncating with large audiences about issues relevant to them,\nusing the technique of \"segmentation,\" whereby a proportion\nof the population, such as a demographic category, receives\na shared message (Hawkins et al., 2008). In this article, it is\nassumed that identification and understanding of the domi-\nnant cultural models shared among the target audience of\nwomen aged 75 years and older will provide insights into the\nappropriate segmentation of health messages to them, and\nthat identifying the cultural knowledge underpinning the\nprint materials will help to indicate whether their messages\nwere appropriate for this market segment.\nCultural models are mental constructs about specific\ndomains in everyday life, such as health and illness, which\nare shared within a community, and which may assist efforts\nto interpret human behavior (Barg & Grier, 2008). While\nindividuals, families, and organizations have their own\nmodels for how the world works, based on their respective\nexperiences and influences, the models that are shared\nwithin a community become the cultural models of that\nsociety (Dressler, 2004). Consensus theory states that a cul-\ntural domain exists when there is a moderately high level of\nconsensus within the community in question (Furlow, 2003).\nIn the case of osteoporosis, the cultural domain \"osteoporo-\nsis\" is confirmed by consensus within the medical fraternity,\nwhich also provides a consensus definition for the profes-\nsion. However, this is not to say that the same cultural model\nexists--if indeed it does exist--at the community (i.e., lay\nperson's) level or among other groups in society. It is pos-\nsible that, for example, policy makers, economists, medical\npractitioners, and ordinary members of society have differ-\nent cultural models of the same phenomenon. Furthermore,\na high level of consensus does not mean that cultural beliefs\nabout a phenomenon are homogeneous or that they are\nshared among all members of the community. In this article,\nwe aim to identify the dominant cultural models that may\nassist in health communications in a particular setting. In so\ndoing, we draw on aspects of cultural consensus theory. We\ndo not apply the theoretical model for quantitative analysis,\nbut to support the notion that consensus underlies cultural\nmodels.\nCultural models may be uncovered through a variety of\nresearch strategies. For example, cognitive anthropologists\nexamine data on how people talk and behave to uncover\ncultural models that explain how they function within their\nrespective societies (Quinn & Holland, 1987). In the United\nStates, Barg and Grier (2008) used qualitative interviews to\nidentify a cultural model of breast cancer shared by African\nAmerican women, which suggested that they did not\nOtmar et al. 3\nperceive the disease as particularly relevant to them, despite\nprevailing messages in the media. Thus, cultural models can\nhelp to explain both the superficial and deeper meanings\nattributed to phenomena within a community. A superficial\nmeaning of osteoporosis could be the fact that it is a condi-\ntion affecting the bones; a deeper meaning might be inferred\nfrom the common adage that osteoporosis is a \"silent dis-\nease.\" Identifying and understanding the dominant cultural\nmodels shared within a community can therefore be used\nto inform the development of appropriately targeted social\nmarketing messages and campaigns. The findings from the\nBarg and Grier study demonstrated how salient social\nmarketing messages might be developed to effectively reach\nits particular target audience.\nIn this article, we aim to explore dominant cultural\nmodels of osteoporosis shared by members of the Geelong\ncommunity, and to compare that with the cultural knowledge\nimplicit in relevant social marketing materials on osteoporo-\nsis, including popular print media such as women's maga-\nzines. Using this construct, we offer a novel approach to\nunderstanding consumer perspectives and responses to\nhealth communications on osteoporosis. To the best of our\nknowledge, to date no Australian studies have been con-\nducted to explore cultural models of osteoporosis, and we are\nunaware of any studies examining cultural knowledge of\nosteoporosis as represented in social marketing.\nSetting\nThe study was undertaken in the regional city of Geelong in\nsoutheastern Australia. Geelong has a moderately large,\nand is located within the national statistical boundary known\nas the Barwon Statistical Division (BSD). At the 2006\nresidents owned or were purchasing their own home, and\n93.7% of the labor force was employed at the time of the\n2006 Census. In these and other respects, the region's social,\ncultural, and geographical demographics closely resemble\nnational socioeconomic indicators, making it an ideal setting\nfor epidemiological and other research (Pasco, Henry,\nParticipants\nEight participants were assigned to one of two case studies\npresented in this analysis, which was nested within a larger\nqualitative study (n = 65) of challenges and enablers in the\nprevention and treatment of osteoporosis in women and men\naged 55 years and older. Recruitment was achieved by solic-\niting volunteers through community notices, articles in local\nmedia, flyers, and word of mouth.\nCultural models present somewhat of an enigma; it is\nacknowledged in the literature that it would be near impos-\nsible to uncover all the cultural models about a topic held\nwithin a given community, not only because of the sheer\nnumber and the likely complexity of links and overlaps of\npotential cultural models, but also because these models are\ndynamic and dynamically held and shared (Holland &\nQuinn, 1987). Therefore, it is difficult to be sure about the\nnumber of cultural models that could be said to represent a\npopulation, or to prescribe the number of people who ought\nto share a cultural model for it to be considered dominant\nwithin that community segment. For these reasons, we opted\nfor the well-known qualitative method of saturation. In-depth\ninterviews with women aged 75 years and older were con-\nducted sequentially, until saturation of the predetermined\ntopics (Liamputtong, 2009). A total of eight women were\ninterviewed. Although it was possible to interview more\nwomen, it was felt that this would not enrich the study, given\nthat its purpose was exploratory and to conduct in-depth and\ndetailed analysis, with a focus on models in language, which\nis a methodological learning reported by other qualitative\nstudies on osteoporosis (see, for example, Lettenmaier et al.,\nEthics Statement\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the World\nMedical Association (2008) Declaration of Helsinki and\napproved by the Barwon Health Human Research Ethics\nCommittee. All participants read and signed a participant\ninformation and consent form prior to being interviewed.\nAll participant names used in this article are pseudonyms.\nData Gathering\nSemistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted by the\nfirst author (R.O.) at our research facility on the Geelong\nHospital campus in central Geelong. A loose set of prede-\ntermined topics was used to invite participants in both\ngroups to describe their understanding of the condition of\nosteoporosis (what it is, what causes it, whether it is treat-\nable and/or preventable) and what they may have heard\nothers say about osteoporosis. Fracture case study partici-\npants were also asked about the circumstances of their\nfracture(s); any immediate and subsequent treatment\nreceived, including investigation for osteoporosis; their\nreaction to the fracture and, if relevant, their reaction to\nreceiving a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Probing and follow-\nup questioning were used to encourage reflection and\ndetailed responses. At the conclusion of the interviews,\nwhich lasted at least 90 min, participants were prompted to\ncomment on anything related to osteoporosis and/or frac-\nture that had not already been covered in the discussion.\nKey stakeholders were consulted to provide copies of, or\nreferences to, print materials to which participants in our\n4 SAGE Open\nstudy, including the case studies, were likely to have been\nexposed in the past 5 years. Stakeholders included local and\nstate government health departments, Barwon Health (the\nmajor health services provider in the region), local medical\npractitioners, pharmacies, researchers in osteoporosis, and\nconsumers. We also searched local media and a popular\n(national) women's magazine for articles on osteoporosis.\nThe materials identified for inclusion in the analysis included\nfact sheets, online (printable) patient information sheets,\npamphlets, booklets, and magazine articles. We selected\nmaterials on the basis of relevance (provides information\nabout osteoporosis) and circulation (confidence that study\nparticipants were exposed to, or were likely to have had\naccess to, one or more of the print materials over the past 5\nyears). The appendix provides a complete list of the 10 items\nincluded in the study.\nData Analysis\nTheories of the organization of cultural knowledge pro-\nvided a framework for our analyses of the verbal data and\nthe print artifacts examined for the present study. Cognitive\nanthropological approaches suggest that cultural models\n(which we identify from what people say, or do not say) are\nrelated to behavior \"in complex, powerful ways . . . Cultural\nmodels frame experience, supplying interpretations of that\nexperience and inferences about it, and goals for action\"\n(Quinn & Holland, 1987, p. 4). In the present context, when\nwe identify participants' cultural models of osteoporosis\nand compare these with the cultural knowledge implicit in\nthe social marketing messages about osteoporosis to which\nthey may have been exposed, we can reasonably link these\nwith their behaviors in relation to osteoporosis and its man-\nagement. For example, in a community in which cultural\nmodels of osteoporosis revolve around the notion of osteo-\nporosis being a result of a deficit of calcium, and social\nmarketing messages encourage an increase in calcium\nintake, some people may be motivated to change their diet\nwhile others may take a calcium supplement, and yet others\nmay do nothing. Neither the cultural model nor the social\nmarketing messages can be said to cause such behavioral\nchange (or no change), but each plays a role in influencing\nthe person's decision making. Since we cannot be sure\nabout the strength of influence, it is important to ensure that\nsocial marketing messages are as closely aligned as possible\nwith cultural models held by the intended audience.\nFor the purposes of our analysis, we assigned the data\ncollected from the eight participants so they formed two col-\nlective and intrinsic case studies (Silverman & Marvasti,\n2008). The collective case study method involves selecting\na few cases to illustrate and analyze the topic of interest\nas a single case, while the intrinsic case study method\ninvolves selection of cases specifically for their relevance to\nthe study question. Together, these methods provide a\npowerful means for intensive investigation. Thus, the four\nparticipants selected to the \"fracture case study\" were those\nwho had sustained one or more fractures in the previous 5\nyears, and the four in the \"community case study\" were con-\nsumer volunteers from the local community.\nThe interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and sent\nto participants for verification. Once finalized, the tran-\nscripts were imported into NVivo 9 (QSR International,\n2010) for coding, using the constant comparative method\ndescribed by Boeije (2002). Peer review (by coauthors\nM.M., J.A.P., M.A.K.) of coding schemes and conclusions\nwas used to check validity and dependability (Liamputtong,\n2009). Once coded, the data were analyzed using Spradley's\nsystem of domain analysis, which specifies three types of\nA domain is defined as \"an organizing idea or concept\" that\nforms the basic unit in a cultural setting (Neuman, 2003).\nFrom the folk domains (terms used by participants) in the\ndata, we identified a series of mixed domains: labels given\nor added by the researcher to folk domains. Then, from\nthese mixed domains, we inferred meaningful categories\nand identified patterns in the data, to which we assigned\nanalytic domains, or terms that encapsulated the cultural\nmodels shared by participants. Figures 1 to 4 demonstrate\nthe process: Statements in the left-hand columns (\"subtype/\nincluded term\") represent the mixed domains that emerged\nas category labels from combinations of researcher para-\nphrasing of chunks of data and the coding of participants'\nstatements in response to a question such as, \"What is\nosteoporosis?\" Several further combinations of category\nstatements were tested to create the cover term (the cultural\nmodel in the right-hand column) as the overarching state-\nment, and the center columns suggest its semantic relation-\nships with the mixed-domain categories. This approach is\nboth innovative and sensitive, in that it requires close\nattention to be paid to language--of both participants and\nresearchers--and the relationships between specific terms\nused to identify cultural meaning (Neuman, 2003).\nThe process described above for domain analysis of the\ninterview data was also used to identify cultural knowledge\nimplicit in the social marketing materials identified for\nexamination in the study, and this analysis included assess-\nment of each publication for its clarity, accuracy, and general\ntone (e.g., whether the tone was informative, reassuring,\nmatter-of-fact, or invoked fear or anxiety).\nResults\nIn-Depth Interviews\nThe four women in our fracture case study each reported\nhaving received a diagnosis of osteoporosis and experienc-\ning multiple fractures during her adult life. Fracture sites\nincluded wrist, hip, spine, ribs, scapula, pelvis, and foot.\nTwo of the women were taking prescribed osteoporosis\ntreatment, one was taking (self-prescribed) calcium and\nOtmar et al. 5\nFigure 1.

While all four were currently living in their own homes,\ntwo resided within a retirement village. Two women were\nwidowed, the third was married, and the fourth had never\nmarried. Only one of the interviewees was born in Australia,\nand she had lived in the region all her life; the others were\nborn in the United Kingdom, and each had resided in the\nregion for at least 20 years.\nData from interviews with the remaining four women\nwere analyzed as a comparison case study (the \"community\ncase study\"), acting as a form of verification of the fracture\ncase study. Three of the women in the community case study\nreported having received a diagnosis of osteoporosis; two\nwere currently on bisphosphonate treatment as well as cal-\ncium supplementation, while the third had been taken off her\nbisphosphonate treatment 2 to 3 years prior to interview,\nafter having taken it for 10 years. This treatment cessation\nwas reportedly a precautionary measure on the part of her\ndoctor, who she said was concerned \"because we don't know\nthe long-term problems.\" Although all four women reported\nhaving fallen in the previous 12 months, none had experi-\nenced a fracture in the previous 15 to 20 years, if ever. The\nwomen were all living independently; three of these within a\nOtmar et al. 7\nretirement village setting. Three women were widowed,\nwhile the fourth was married. Two were born in Australia\nand had lived in the region all their lives; the other two were\nborn in the United Kingdom and Indonesia and had resided\nin the region for 14 years and 51 years, respectively.\nIdentifying the Shared Cultural Model\nIn analyzing the data from the fracture case study, seven\nsubtypes (or parts of the domain) emerged in the course of\nidentifying the mixed and analytic domains within the\nshared cultural model, \"Osteoporosis has low salience\": (a)\nosteoporosis is not a serious disease, (b) osteoporosis has\nlow impact, (c) osteoporosis has many possible explana-\ntions or causes, (d) osteoporosis happens to other people,\n(e) a healthy/balanced lifestyle prevents osteoporosis, (f) a\ndiagnosis of osteoporosis does not necessarily motivate\nbehavioral change, and (g) the \"silent\" disease made\nvisible.\nCultural Model 1: Osteoporosis Has Low Salience\nOsteoporosis is not a serious disease. Osteoporosis was not\nconsidered to be a \"serious disease\" in and of itself, particu-\nlarly when compared with other chronic conditions. For our\nparticipants, among the many threats to health, osteoporosis\ndid not rise to nearly the same level of salience and concern\nas heart disease, stroke, cancer, and even arthritis. For exam-\nple, according to Petra,1\nI've always thought, of all the things I've got--there's\na few things--osteoporosis is the [pause] least of my\nproblems . . . I've got arthritis. Now, if I had a choice\nof getting rid of that or osteoporosis, I would say the\narthritis, because that hurts all the time.\nOnly one participant, Beulah, considered osteoporosis to\nbe a serious disease, second only to stroke as a threat to\nhealth, due to the risk of fracture and consequential limita-\ntions to mobility:\nI felt I was coping with all the other problems that I\nhad, and this one [osteoporosis] is the one that has\nbeen most limiting. So I'd put it fairly high on the\nscale of \"not good.\"\nOsteoporosis has low impact. Participants were not unduly\nconcerned about having osteoporosis, even after receiving a\ndiagnosis. This was related to the first subtype (\"osteoporo-\nsis is not a serious disease\"), both of which are consistent\nwith the literature on Australians' (lack of) concern about\nosteoporosis, relative to other chronic conditions (Miller &\nTuffin, 2009). It also highlighted the general attitude toward\naging at this stage in participants' lives:\nI see it just as part of getting older. Because you can't\nget older without problems. (Katrin)\nNo, I don't think I am really concerned. I guess\nbecause I'm getting to the latter end of my life, that\nmaybe I just think, make the most of it while I can.\n(Yvette)\nOsteoporosis has many possible explanations or causes.\nI understand that it's a--more or less a disease of the\nbone, where the bones get very porous and brittle, and\nso they can break very easily . . . it's not necessarily\nconnected to old age, I know. But it seems to get worse\nas we get older. (Yvette)\n[W]hen I was sick with my ulcerative colitis and had\nto have steroids, I started taking calcium then, because\nI knew that [osteoporosis] was always a possibility.\n(Beulah)\nParticipants held contradictory beliefs about the cause(s)\nof osteoporosis. On one hand, there was a perception that\nthey themselves could exercise considerable control over\ngetting osteoporosis, while on the other hand, genetic factors\nwere viewed as paramount.\n[Y]ou know, for years I didn't drink milk, or eat\ncheese or butter, so I think mine is quite self-inflicted.\n(Charmaine)\nI guess it's something to do with the genes and\nmakeup of the individual person. (Yvette)\nOsteoporosis happens to other people. Although they\nexpressed the view that osteoporosis was not alarming, par-\nticipants were surprised and initially did not believe their\ndiagnoses. It was something they had witnessed or heard of\nin others but never expected they would have to confront.\nOne participant said that even though she had sustained\nseveral fractures prior to sustaining her spinal fracture, this\nsingular event compelled her to accept the diagnosis of\nosteoporosis.\nAnd [the medical specialist] took one look at me, and\nhe said, \"You've fractured your spine.\" And I said,\n\"No, I haven't.\" He said, \"You have!\"\nA complete shock . . . A complete shock, because at\nthat time I was going to do aerobics at the gym, four\ntimes a week. I was walking from North Geelong into\ntown, all the time. It was a tremendous shock, and I\nwouldn't believe it. I just said, \"It can't be!\"\n(Charmaine)\n8 SAGE Open\nA balanced lifestyle prevents osteoporosis. Participants\nbelieved that a healthy person who lived a balanced lifestyle\nwould not get osteoporosis. This was described as having a\n\"good\" diet and regular exercise, and together these were\nthought to be protective.\nA diagnosis does not necessarily motivate behavioral change.\nOnce a diagnosis of osteoporosis had been made, partici-\npants did not feel compelled to make significant changes to\ntheir lifestyles.\nMy husband said, \"You have to be more careful and not\nfall.\" But falling is . . . an accident. You can try [to be\nmore careful] but it becomes very paranoid, so I don't.\nNo, I didn't change anything. No, nothing. (Katrin)\nOne woman moved very quickly from her initial reaction\nof shock and disbelief to what might be described as denial\nor complacency: \"I think once the initial, you know, shock\nthat you've got it is over, then I put it to the back of the\nmind.\" (Yvette)\nThe \"silent\" disease made visible. This subtype emerged in\nanalyzing both what was said as well as what was not, or\nwhat Neuman refers to as \"negative evidence\" (Neuman,\nOsteoporosis, you don't feel it, until you fall and break\nsomething. (Petra)\nThe interview technique of \"active listening\" allowed the\nresearcher \"to listen to what was said and how it [was] said\"\nprompts where appropriate. Field notes provided data on\nsilences, indicating uncertainty or establishing unspoken\nboundaries to the interview. Participants' own expressed\nviews of osteoporosis differed from those they ascribed to\nthe community. For example, in response to the question of\nwhether a stigma existed in the community in relation to\nosteoporosis, all participants firmly denied this was the case.\nTheir silences suggested, \"I am not one to perpetuate stigma,\"\nand yet they all mentioned the \"dowager's hump\" (kyphosis)\nwith not a small measure of concern, at times even dread.\nI always thought from the time I was diagnosed, I'm\nnot going to [get a dowager's hump], I'm going to\nstand up straight . . . But I've had it for all those years,\nand I don't really have a dowager's hump. (Petra)\nHere, while Petra has rejected the notion of community\nstigma, she also expressed a relief at being spared this afflic-\ntion, suggesting otherwise.\nEach of the seven subtypes (or included terms) described\nabove has a defined semantic relationship with the cultural\nmodel \"low salience\" (Figure 1). In this analysis, each of the\nfirst six subtypes has the semantic relationship \"is a reason\nfor\" the cultural model of low salience, while the seventh\nsubtype has the semantic relationship \"is a result of\" the cul-\ntural model of low salience.\nAnalysis of the data from the community case study\nconfirmed the cultural model, \"Osteoporosis has low\nsalience,\" identified from the fracture case study. We also\nidentified an additional subtype unique to the community\ncase study.\nOsteoporosis comes with aging and thinning of the bones.\nApart from one participant, who reported that she had no\nexperience or knowledge of osteoporosis, there was an\nacceptance of osteoporosis as a normal and natural conse-\nquence of aging.\nWell, I think as you get older, you know . . . it's the\nthinning of the bones; that's how I think of it, or some\npeople refer to it as \"bone softening.\" (Anna)\nBut most people--a few people that I know have got\nosteoporosis and have had falls and have had frac-\ntures. But I just, personally, I see it just as part of get-\nting older. Because you can't get older without\nproblems. (Katrin)\nPrint Materials\nThe cultural knowledge underpinning the messages in the\nprint materials were categorized into three distinct mes-\nsages; using the same process as for the cultural models, we\nidentified several subtypes describing each message.\nMessage 1: Osteoporosis Is a Serious But\nPreventable Condition.Treatment Is Available\nWithin this message, osteoporosis was identified as a serious\nbut preventable condition for which effective tests and\nmedications were available. While the texts were not explicit\nin their use of the term serious, and none described osteopo-\nrosis as a \"disease,\" the seriousness of the condition was\nconveyed through the tone and presentation of content about\nosteoporosis, and by the organizational branding associated\nwith health care. The print materials produced by Barwon\nHealth, Better Health Channel, Osteoporosis Australia, and\nthe pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp & Dohme pre-\nsented messages that fitted within this cultural conception.\nThe pamphlet by Osteoporosis Australia was designed and\ntargeted specifically for men. However, it was included in\nthe study since it had been identified by a stakeholder as a\n\"good\" resource on osteoporosis to which participants in the\nstudy may have been exposed in the previous 5 years. While\nthe pamphlet included facts and information about risk fac-\ntors for osteoporosis in men, it also included clear informa-\ntion about osteoporosis in general and the importance of\nvitamin D in the maintenance of healthy bones.\nOsteoporosis is a weakening of the bone or bone structure.\nThe print materials each provided a clear and unambiguous\ndefinition of osteoporosis.\nOtmar et al. 9\nOsteoporosis is a condition where bone structure\ndeteriorates . . . the outer bone \"shell\" becomes thin\n. . . weakening the bones and increasing the risk of\nfracture. (Barwon Health)\nOsteoporosis means \"bones with holes.\" Bones lose\ntheir strength and density, become fragile and break\n(fracture) more easily. (Better Health Channel)\nOsteoporosis is a condition where bones become\nweakened and fracture more easily than normal bone.\n(Osteoporosis Australia)\nThere are many risk factors for osteoporosis. The materials\nwere explicit in the view that there was no single cause or\nfactor that placed a person at risk for osteoporosis. Each pub-\nlication in this group listed a range of risk factors, and identi-\nfied those people who might be at higher risk of osteoporosis.\nThey also debunked common myths about osteoporosis\nbeing \"a women's disease,\" highlighting that both men and\nwomen could be at risk.\nSeveral factors can place a person at risk of osteopo-\nrosis. . . .

Readers were repeat-\nedly urged to check their intake of calcium and to seek\nmedical advice about osteoporosis. The four print materials\ndeveloped by Novartis Pharmaceuticals and the Australian\nDairy Corporation (one of these in conjunction with Arthritis\nFoundation of Australia) published messages that fitted\nwithin this cultural conception.\nOsteoporosis is a common problem. Although this was not\nexplicitly stated in the publications, they gave the strong\nimpression of osteoporosis being a common occurrence in\nthe community. There was also a sense of heightening read-\ners' awareness of a pervasive problem.\nApproximately every 5 to 6 minutes someone is\nadmitted to an Australian hospital with an osteoporotic\nfracture. . . .

Within this message, osteoporosis\nwas not so much defined as dramatized into a life-threaten-\ning condition.\nOsteoporosis can be crippling and life threatening. The arti-\ncles presented a consistent view that osteoporosis was a\ncause for alarm.\nFormer model and actress Britt Ekland . . . weight loss\nhas left her crippled with osteoporosis. (October 2007)\n[The medical specialist] told me I might only have\nbeen a day away from not being here at all. . . .\nBasically, my body was shutting down. (June, 2007)\nOsteoporosis is caused by body image OR You can get\nosteoporosis through no fault of your own. The Woman's Day\narticles present conflicting views on the possible cause(s) of\nosteoporosis. On one hand, a pervasive desire for a \"size\nzero\" body among young women was the cause of dieting,\nwhich in turn caused osteoporosis: \"`Dieting is why I now\nhave osteoporosis', she [Britt Ekland] tells British newspa-\nper Daily Express. Britt says she was plagued by body\nimage problems from an early age\" (October 2007).\nOn the other hand, osteoporosis was presented as a mys-\nterious condition that could arise without prior warning:\n\"The X-rays did in fact show that this otherwise fit, healthy\n30-year-old had severe osteoporosis. . . . We don't really\nknow why I developed osteoporosis.\" (June 2007)\nYoung women should be careful. Both articles highlighted\nthat young women were at risk of getting osteoporosis.\nSue is now determined to let younger women know\nthat osteoporosis can happen . . . at any age. (June,\nBritt hopes her story will serve as a warning to young\nDiscussion\nThe four cultural concepts that emerged in the present analy-\nsis--the cultural model that \"Osteoporosis has low salience\"\nand the messages that \"Osteoporosis is a serious but prevent-\nable condition for which treatment is available\";\n\"Osteoporosis is a common problem among older women,\nwe should all try to maintain healthy bones\"; and \"Dieting\ngave me osteoporosis\"--highlight the range of views on\nosteoporosis present in our community of interest. There\nwere clearly discernible differences as well as similarities\nbetween the cultural model identified among the study par-\nticipants and the messages that emerged from analysis of the\nprint materials included in the study.\nOur findings from the fracture case study concur with\ninternational studies indicating a high level of disinterest in\nosteoporosis among middle-aged and older women. In a\nqualitative study conducted in Scotland, Backett-Milburn,\nParry, and Mauthner (2000) were surprised to find that only\na minority of the women in their study, aged 40 to 55 years,\nmentioned osteoporosis without prompting, and when they\ndid so there was little interest in osteoporosis as a health con-\ncern (Backett-Milburn et al., 2000). Similar findings were\nindicated by Meadows and colleagues in Canada (Meadows,\nMrkonjic, & Lagendyk, 2005; Meadows, Mrkonjic, Petersen,\nDenmark, where women's views of osteoporosis were found\nto be influenced by stereotypes of aging and inevitable\nbodily decay.\nIt is interesting to note that while osteoporosis was simi-\nlarly of low salience among our community case study, these\nparticipants were more sanguine about osteoporosis than\nthose in the fracture case study, considering osteoporosis to\nbe a condition caused by age-related thinning of the bones.\nWhile this difference between the groups was subtle, it is nev-\nertheless an important distinction; the women in the fracture\ncase study had firsthand experience of the consequences of\nbone fragility that they did not put down to aging, even if\ntheir level of concern about osteoporosis matched that of par-\nticipants in the community case study.\nOur findings from both case studies also concur with a\nmajor Australian study suggesting that osteoporosis is con-\nsidered to be of low salience within the general community.\nThe Australian Better Health Initiative (BHI), announced in\n2006, is a large-scale, national communications strategy\nthat uses the threat of chronic disease to motivate lifestyle\nchange among Australians. The primary target for the first\nphase of the BHI campaign involved 25- to 50-year-olds,\nand the secondary target 45- to 65-year-olds. In the cam-\npaign's baseline survey (n = 2,506), respondents had ranked\nosteoporosis 14th in a list of 18 chronic diseases (Miller &\nTuffin, 2009). Thus, it would be fair to say that osteoporosis\nranks relatively low among Australians' health concerns,\nand this is reflected within our case study sample.\nThe cultural model \"Osteoporosis has low salience\"\nincluded a strong association with the dreaded \"dowager's\nhump\" held by the women in the case studies in relation to\nosteoporosis. Nevertheless, this association was not sufficient\ncause for osteoporosis to be prioritized among the women's\nhealth concerns. The Norwegian HUNT study provides an\ninteresting contrast; the women in that study also were\nreported as holding strong associations between osteoporosis\nbut they appeared to express far greater concern and curiosity\nabout the condition than did their Australian counterparts--\nthough it is possible that this was as a result of the high level\nof support for the HUNT study reported among residents of\nthe county in which the study is located.\nNotwithstanding the above, why was osteoporosis con-\nsidered to be of low salience among Australian partici-\npants, given that all but one had received a diagnosis of\nosteoporosis? One reason could be a lack of knowledge\nabout the condition, as suggested by the study cited in our\nintroduction (Taylor et al., 2003). A case in point was one\nparticipant in the community case study who had never\nexperienced a fracture and reported having no knowledge\nof osteoporosis.\nGiven their recent fracture history, perhaps it would not\nbe unreasonable to expect that participants in the fracture\ncase study would rate osteoporosis higher in their list of\nhealth concerns. However, if their fracture experience did\nnot result in a change in their knowledge of the condition, it\nis perhaps unlikely that it changed their perception of its\nsalience. A recent Australian study by Levinson and col-\nleagues assessed elderly patients'knowledge of osteoporosis\nduring and 3 months after hospital admission for minimal\ntrauma fracture (Levinson, Leeuwrik, Oldroyd, & Staples,\nporosis did not improve in the 3 months after fracture, and\nconcluded that \"current strategies for patient education in\nosteoporosis did not result in increased patient knowledge\nabout their disease.\"\nConcomitant with our speculation above that fracture\ncase study participants might rate osteoporosis relatively\nhigh on their list of health concerns due to their fracture his-\ntory is the notion that the strength of participants' views\nabout osteoporosis and its management may be dependent\non the proximity of their encounters with the concept of\nosteoporosis. This might include how long ago partici-\npants--or a family member or friend--received a diagnosis\nof osteoporosis, visited a doctor for a condition that might\nhave exposed them to discussions or health-promotion\nmaterials about osteoporosis, or otherwise were exposed to\nany form of dialogue or information about it.\nAnother reason for the low salience may be that the\nwomen's own lived experiences were incongruent with\nthe messages they received about osteoporosis from their\nmedical practitioners and/or social marketing materials they\nmay have encountered. Like the women in Barg and Grier's\nstudy (2008), they may believe that these messages do not\napply to them because the components of their cultural\nmodel of osteoporosis are not addressed in those messages.\nThis was evident in the fracture case study, but not in the\ncommunity case study. We speculate that views among the\nfracture case study differed precisely because of partici-\npants' recent fracture experiences. Social marketing mes-\nsages could be made more relevant to women such as our\nparticipants by segmentation or targeting (Kreuter et al.,\n2000) that addresses their age/life stage, fracture history,\nand knowledge. For example, a pamphlet provided to elderly\nwomen attending a fracture clinic could focus on interven-\ntions to prevent a recurrence of fracture, while one provided\nto elderly women attending a general medical practice\nwould need to provide more basic information relevant to\nprimary prevention of osteoporosis in older women.\nWe note that this discussion occurs within a societal\nframework in which the dominant discourse is one of equity\nin the doctor\u00adpatient partnership in health, that consumers\nare empowered through access to quality information\n(Henwood, Wyatt, Hart, & Smith, 2003). However, it does\nnot necessarily follow that consumers empowered with\ninformation--quality or otherwise--will translate their\nknowledge into positive health behaviors.\nA further complicating factor linked to consumer health\nbehaviors relates to the capacity to access health information\nand, by extension, the relationship to health outcomes.\nAccess to health information is increasingly universalized\nthrough the ubiquity of the Internet, but this access is medi-\nated by socioeconomic factors such as income and employ-\nment status (Reinfeld-Kirkman, Kalucy, & Roeger, 2010).\nThe relationship between socioeconomic status and health\noutcomes is a topic that has attracted much attention in\nresearch in recent decades (Huguet, Kaplan, & Feeny, 2008)\nand may well be a salient factor in how people respond to\nhealth communications about osteoporosis. However, stud-\nies on the relationship between socioeconomic status and\nhealth outcomes among older people are only just beginning\nto emerge in relation to chronic conditions such as hyperten-\nsion (Kaplan, Huguet, Feeny, & McFarland, 2010), and a\ngap remains in relation to income disparity and the preva-\nlence of osteoporosis.\nSocial Marketing and Osteoporosis\nThe print materials provided by key stakeholders for inclu-\nsion in the study did not send a universal message about\nosteoporosis. As might be expected, the materials produced\nby the publicly funded health and information providers\n(Barwon Health, Better Health Channel, and Osteoporosis\nAustralia) presented messages that were clear, balanced,\ninformative, and reassuring, while those obtained from other\nsources (pharmaceutical companies, the dairy industry, and\nWoman's Day magazine) ranged from laissez-faire state-\nments about osteoporosis and its management to fear-based\nexhortations for young women to \"be careful.\" The fact\nsheet produced by pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp &\nDohme was a notable exception, although it was specifically\nproduced for general medical practitioners (this fact sheet\nwas included in the analysis because a general medical prac-\ntitioner stakeholder had offered it as evidence of information\nhe provided to his patients when diagnosing osteoporosis).\nWhile the first two messages in this section of the analy-\nsis appeared to be similar, there was one major difference:\nthe balanced and reassuring approach taken by the public\nhealth and information providers, as opposed to the com-\nmercially laden messages presented by the pharmaceutical\nand dairy industry representatives. Both messages presented\ncurrent and accurate data on the prevalence of osteoporosis,\nbut the communication of this information in Message 2\n(\"Osteoporosis is a common problem among older women,\nwe should all try to maintain healthy bones\") could have led\nreaders to believe that osteoporosis was far more prevalent\nthan it really was. Older women, in particular, were the\nfocus of these messages. Furthermore, there was a strong\nemphasis in Message 2 on the individual's responsibility to\nmaintain healthy bones, primarily through calcium supple-\nmentation and osteoporosis medication, and this message\nwas reflected in Cultural Model 1, where some women\nbelieved that osteoporosis was lifestyle-related and there-\nfore self-inflicted.\nMessage 3 (\"Dieting gave me osteoporosis\") took a dis-\ntinctly different approach to communicating about osteopo-\nrosis. In these magazine articles, osteoporosis was presented\nas a mysterious disease to which young women in particular\nshould be alerted. Neither article gave any indication of the\nknown risk factors for osteoporosis, nor its recommended\ntreatment or management. The cultural knowledge conveyed\nthrough Message 3, thus, did not reflect the available scien-\ntific evidence on osteoporosis, and they also did not reflect\nAustralian policies on raising awareness of the condition.\nmillion over 4 years to \"osteoporosis awareness raising,\nsupport for better self-management and health service\nimprovements,\" and in 2006, that funding was extended\nfor a further 4 years (Australian Government, 2006). Under\nprogram, activities for osteoporosis included a \"Prevent the\nnext fracture\" awareness program, a vertebral fracture ini-\ntiative for general medical practitioners and consumers, an\nosteoporosis self-management training module, a national\nosteoporosis multicultural initiative, a vitamin D and cal-\ncium awareness program, a national dissemination project\nfor the healthy bones school kit, a national osteoporosis risk\nfactors awareness program, a \"Men and Osteoporosis\" pro-\ngram, a National Patient Support program, and an evaluated\nprogram of community service announcements (Australian\nForum, a joint initiative of Osteoporosis Australia and the\nAustralian and New Zealand Bone and Mineral Society,\ndeveloped recommendations aimed at achieving improved\nvitamin D and calcium nutrition among Australians; a range\nof publications targeted to consumer and professional audi-\nences was published as a result (Osteoporosis Australia and\nAustralian and New Zealand Bone and Mineral Society,\nConsidering the findings presented in this article, it\nappears that not much of these extensive social marketing\nprograms have penetrated our study region. While there\nwere some scant references in the print materials analyzed at\nMessages 1 and 2, none of the messages in these campaigns\nwas reflected in the articles analyzed at Message 3. Having\nsaid that, though, it is difficult to obtain clear evidence either\nway in the research literature; there remains a dearth of\nresearch evaluating social marketing campaigns on osteopo-\nrosis--the messages imparted as well as their uptake--\nwithin the country generally, and specifically in the study\nregion.\nThe cultural model identified from our case studies,\n\"Osteoporosis has low salience,\" did not differ as notably as\nit diverged from Messages 1 and 2. Given participants' view\nof osteoporosis as having low salience, the cultural knowl-\nedge in Message 1 that osteoporosis was in fact a serious\ncondition and in Message 2 that it was common among older\nwomen might hardly have provided reasons for participants\nto reprioritize osteoporosis above the health conditions and\ndiseases they had placed ahead of it. Although we do not\nhave evidence that our participants specifically were (or\nwere not) exposed to the print materials analyzed in our\nstudy, it is not difficult to see how Messages 1 and 2 may\nhave missed the mark with them. The materials were not par-\nticularly well targeted toward women of their age, and there-\nfore participants may not have considered these as being\nrelevant to them (Barg & Grier, 2008; Buckley & \u00d3 Tuama,\nCultural Model 1 (\"Osteoporosis has low salience\") and\nMessage 1 (\"Dieting gave me osteoporosis\") could be seen\nas representing two views on opposite extremes regarding\nosteoporosis. It is unlikely that the alarmist targeting of\nyoung women in Message 3 would have swayed our partici-\npants'views from osteoporosis as a condition of low salience\nto one that might be life threatening. The use of a former\nmodel now aged in her 60s would be unlikely to provide the\ndesired connection with the targeted audience of young\nwomen. As shown by Buckley and \u00d3 Tuama, a recent trend\ntoward the use of celebrities in testimonial-style health pro-\nmotion could have the unwanted effect of \"heighten[ing]\nfeelings of disconnection\" (Buckley & \u00d3 Tuama, 2010).\nWomen's magazines have long been recognized as strong\ninfluencers in women's health education. An extensive body\nof research has established the importance of this medium in\nempowering women to be informed about their bodies, their\nhealth, and as consumers of health care (Barnett, 2006;\nthe cultural knowledge identified from the print materials in\nthis study, particularly the women's magazine, could be said\nto be reinforcing of a perception of the low salience of osteo-\nporosis--clearly an unintended, negative consequence from\nthe perspective of the authors.\nTarget MarketingVersus Nontarget Marketing\nIn the psychology of market effects, persuasion is enhanced\nwhen there is a match between the message and the target\nmarket, while \"negative nonmarket effects\" may occur\nwhen there is not (Aaker, Brumbaugh, & Grier, 2000). In\nthe case of osteoporosis, this presents a strong argument for\nthe development of health messages based on the target\nmarket's cultural model(s) of osteoporosis. By nature of\ntheir proximity, older women living in our study region will\nhave shared experiences and problems, so it is not unrea-\nsonable to expect that they might have a shared model of\nosteoporosis and that this model might overlap with the one\nidentified among the women in our study, albeit a small\nsample. Thus, key features of a shared cultural model might\nbe used effectively to target older women in the region with\nsocial marketing messages and interventions that aim to\nprevent or treat osteoporosis. As already stated, if these\nfeatures are not taken into account, older women in the\ncommunity might think that the messages and interventions\nthey encounter about osteoporosis do not apply to them\n(Barg & Grier, 2008) and that they do not need to change\ntheir behaviors in relation to osteoporosis.\nThe cultural model of osteoporosis that emerged from our\ncase studies emphasized the low salience, or low promi-\nnence, of osteoporosis among older women, including those\nwith a diagnosis of osteoporosis and those who had recently\nexperienced fracture. While it is important to note that the\nviews and attitudes represent the women in our sample at\nthis specific age and stage in life, nevertheless, they point to\nkey features of programs and policies developed in the pre-\nvention and treatment of chronic conditions such as\nosteoporosis.\nStrengths and Limitations\nA significant strength is that this is the only study we know\nof that has explored and compared cultural models of osteo-\nporosis among consumers and cultural knowledge of the\ncondition as represented in social marketing campaigns, in\nAustralia as well as internationally. However, we empha-\nsize the exploratory nature of the study and the limitations\ninherent in the small sample. Qualitative explorative studies\ncan offer a deep understanding of the mental or cultural\nmodels underlying people's thoughts or beliefs about a phe-\nnomenon, which can be used as a focus for communication\nabout that phenomenon. The case studies presented in this\narticle provide some insights into knowledge, beliefs,\nattitudes, and cultural models of osteoporosis, and highlight\ndivergent messages implicit in social marketing campaigns\nimplemented through print materials. These findings cannot\nbe generalized to the broader population. Given the consid-\nerable gap in the literature evaluating social marketing\ncampaigns and messages related to osteoporosis prevention\nand treatment, the study signals a need for further research\nto determine the prevalence of the cultural knowledge high-\nlighted in the present analysis, as well as others extant in the\ncommunity. Indeed, culture represents a significant gap in\nthe research of health communications (Barg & Grier,\n2008). Future research also might helpfully provide com-\nprehensive content analyses of key social marketing cam-\npaigns on osteoporosis--in print and nonprint formats--and\nexamine behavioral responses to these. We are acutely\naware of the fact that participants in our study may have\nbeen exposed to other print campaigns as well as a range of\nnonprint campaigns, including television advertisements for\ncalcium supplements and dairy products, and this presents a\nsubstantial opportunity for future research. A further gap,\nthe perspectives of medical practitioners, is currently being\nexplored in our main study.\nConclusion\nWe identified cultural models as a novel approach to under-\nstanding consumer perspectives of osteoporosis and com-\nparing these with cultural knowledge implicit in social\nmarketing print materials. It is clear that consumer knowl-\nedge, understanding, attitudes, and behaviors regarding\nosteoporosis need to be improved to reduce its vast health\nburden. But social marketers, too, can benefit from having a\ndeeper understanding of the cultural models that drive con-\nsumer knowledge and behaviors in relation to osteoporosis.\nWe echo Barg and Grier (2008) in calling for \"prevention\nmodels that consider consumers' lived experiences.\" Our\nfindings suggest that broadly formulated marketing mes-\nsages designed to reach mass audiences may have unin-\ntended negative consequences, and that cultural models can\nbe used in developing appropriately targeted, salient mes-\nsages.\nAppendix\nAustralian Dairy Corporation.
