But while there has\nbeen a decided upsurge of interest in popular cultural forms, there are some remaining\nlacunae regarding quotidian forms of cultural production. One such concerns letter-writing\nand its proxies.1 This is perhaps surprising, for cognate areas of cultural anthropology\nCorresponding author:\nLiz Stanley, University of Edinburgh, George Square, Edinburgh, EH8 9LD, UK.\nEmail: liz.stanley@ed.ac.uk\nArticle\nand literary studies have produced influential work on letters and other everyday litera-\ncies as an important aspect of cultural production (Barton and Hamilton, 1998; Barton\nand Papen, 2010; Lyons, 2007). However, while cultural sociology, cultural anthropol-\nogy and literary studies now have different concerns, they shared a starting point in re-\nthinking genres as what would now be termed `cultural assemblages' (Bennett, 2007).\nWith somewhat contradictory bases in the work of Bakhtin (1986) and Derrida (1980),\nsuch work on genre formation and re-formation has included commemoration and\nmemorialisation, collective memory, domestic popular cultural consumption, and liter-\nary genre codes and conventions (cf. Bawarshi, 2000; Bazerman, 1999; Desmondhaigh,\nTodorov, 1990; Wagner-Pacifici and Schwartz, 1991). In cultural sociology there is now\na rich body of work around the conjunction of memory-making and collective memory\nand concerning more organised forms of cultural consumption, while in cultural anthro-\npology and literary studies there has been greater emphasis on everyday literacies includ-\nThe present discussion brings these different trajectories together around an interro-\ngation of whether new digital developments are heralding `the death of the letter', for\nletter-writing has been depicted as in fatal decline because of these (e.g. Garfield, 2013).\nIn significant respects debate here has concerned matters of genre, with `the death' per-\nceived in relation to presumptively tight genre conventions regarding the epistolary\nform, with opposing arguments seeing genres as cultural assemblages and `the letter' as\njust one form that epistolarity can take, and present developments evidencing growth\nrather than decline. These wider matters about genre and everyday forms of epistolary\ncultural production will be returned to, while the significance of letter-writing for cul-\ntural sociology needs some underlining.\nLetter-writing, including proxies such as notes, telegrams and cards and recent devel-\nopments such as text, Twitter and email, is the form of cultural production that has\ninvolved and continues to involve more people than any other (Barton and Hall, 1999;\nGerber, 2006; Lyons, 2007). `Ordinary writing' has been a continuing feature in many\ncultures (cf. Lyons, 2012), with illiteracy or functional literacy little bar to engaging in\nletter-writing and reading, with both often being communal activities (Austin, 1999).Also\nand perhaps counter-intuitively, most archives, particularly non-specialist depositories,\nare replete with ordinary writings; and most collections, whether of `ordinary' or elite\nfamilies and individuals, overwhelmingly contain letters (Lyons, 2012; Whyman, 2009).\nOne of the founding texts of cultural and everyday life sociologies, Thomas and\nZnaniecki's (1958) The Polish Peasant ..., makes extensive use of letter-collections (see\nalso Plummer, 2001; Stanley, 2013). For them, the porous character of the letter means it\nacts as a gauge of social changes, with their research exploring this in epistolary\nexchanges between `New World' migrants and their families in Poland. They were espe-\ncially interested in so-called `bowing'letters in articulating hierarchies that were thereby\nexpressed and also unsettled, and certainly now both stilted formalities and departures\nfrom these come across clearly. But they seem a universe away from emails travelling\ngreat distances to arrive within seconds and the informalities of text messages arriving\neven more swiftly. Clearly, new technologies and hardware, including the cell phone,\nlaptop and tablet with accompanying software innovations have impacted on the form\nand also the content of epistolary exchanges between people separated from each other\nSo is the letter now dead, made redundant by new technologies and digital forms of\ncommunication like email, text and `instant' messaging which enable much speedier\ncommunications to bridge absence? For some, `letter-writing may be about to come to an\nend' (Garfield, 2013: back cover). However, has the letter perhaps witnessed earlier\n`deaths'because of the impact of once-new technologies, but survived these? If the letter\nis not dead or dying, then what effects are digital communications having? And is the\nletter actually so important, or are there more fundamental aspects of epistolarity that\nmight even be enhanced by current new developments?\nThese and related questions about `the death of the letter' have become familiar, with\nan interesting literature debating the arguments (see Haggis and Holmes, 2011; Milne,\nnitional aspects of the letter, with the importance or otherwise of genre conventions and\nthe porous boundaries of the letter, the propelling factor of absence, the time/space dis-\ntance basis of letter-writing, its draw in providing a simulacra of presence of the writer,\nand the materiality of epistolary traces, usefully considered.\nThe Death of the Letter?\nThe first and core `death of the letter' argument is that, while in situations of absence\npeople used to keep in touch primarily by letter-writing, the letter has now been super-\nseded. A number of pieces of research have shown that when people need to keep in\ntouch, only rarely now do they write letters but instead use a combination of email and\nthis work is based on a very literal reading of what `the letter' is, treating the prevailing\nconventions (Danet, 2001: 59) \u00ad opening salutation, formal address of someone, mes-\nsage with standard syntax and punctuation and layout, pre-closing, and closing with\nsignature \u00ad as not just definitional but sui generis. Because many fewer letters are being\nwritten, at least in high technology parts of the world, this is taken to demonstrate if not\n`death', then considerable malaise. This argument focuses on the conventions rather than\nexamining the different forms that letter-writing takes in practice and more fundamental\nmatters concerning what I have termed `epistolary intent' and `letterness'(Stanley, 2011,\n2013, Stanley et al., 2012). But, looking more closely at the research drawn on, this\nshows it is `letter-like' forms of digital communication that are favoured, with most peo-\nple in such studies emailing, tweeting and texting several times a day.\nThe fundament of such exchanges is `epistolary intent', which involves the intention\nto communicate, in writing or a cognate representational medium, to another person who\nis `not there' because removed in time/space from the writer, and doing so with the hope\nor expectation of a response. The `standard letter', sketched earlier, is actually a fairly\nlate arrival on the epistolary scene, for its conventions \u00ad including a precise address, dat-\ning with days and months as well as years, in the handwriting of the person sending the\nmessage, the certainties of arrival, fixed addresses where letters are delivered \u00ad are\nlargely 18th and 19th century and rich North in origin. However, the components of\nepistolary intent just noted can be traced millennia earlier, and still flourish now, and are\nnot conterminous with `the letter'.\n`Letterness'refers to another notable characteristic of epistolarity, which is the porous\ncharacter of the letter and its ability to morph into other forms. The letter developed out\nof a variety of other kinds of communication \u00ad edicts about what was un/lawful from\nkings and emperors, public announcements carved on steles, officials sending official\ncommunications, letters patent, banknotes `promising to pay the bearer on demand', sci-\nentific reports and so on \u00ad and letter-writers often draw on or mimic other genres. In\nrecognition, Bazerman (1999) has called the letter a `proto-genre', although its `proto'\naspect is perhaps better seen as fundamental.\nThe letter as a means to facilitate epistolary intent has its origins and purpose in situa-\ntions of absence, where people who are separated want to communicate with each other,\nwith separation in time/space and absence perceived as definitional to the genre. However,\nthe second `death of the letter' argument suggests that new digital forms of communica-\ntion such as text, `instant'messaging and push email are characterised by their immediacy\nand that these are to all intents and purposes synchronous forms of communication (akin\nto the face-to-face and talk) and very different from the asynchronous (time/space\nAbsence is usually positioned as fundamentally definitional of the letter as a genre\nand is treated in the `death of the letter'debate in a binary away: people are either present\ntogether in face-to-face ways or else separated from each other, with migrant letters\nviewed as the key exemplar (Elliott et al., 2006; Gerber, 2006). However, when letter\ncollections are looked at en masse (Stanley, 2015; Whyman, 2009), the majority of ordi-\nnary letter-writing is the product of what I have termed `interrupted presence'. That is,\npeople who are `together' are frequently but transitorily apart on a day-to-day basis and\nuse notes, letters and related means to bridge their face-to-face encounters, rather than\nepistolarity signifying (semi-)permanent absence.\nThe letter's marked temporal aspect, concerning the intervals existing between\nsomeone writing and the other person receiving and reading a letter, is also seen as\ndefinitional. However, the third `death of the letter' argument is that a fundamental\nchange in time/space compression occurs in digital forms of communication, with the\ntemporal rhythms of epistolary exchanges having been dissolved (become synchro-\nnous) because rendered so short as to be effectively instantaneous (Haggis and Holmes,\nThis is a very a-historical view of speed and its impact. For instance, in Britain the\nmail coach, the 1d post, the international telegraph and the postcard were successively\nseen in `death of the letter'terms, because the time for consideration and reflection which\nthe earlier slow speed of letter exchanges required had been made faster, but immense\nupsurges in ordinary letter-writing occurred around their successive introductions\n(Campbell-Smith, 2011; Standage, 1998). In addition, `very quick' is not the same as,\nand in such arguments is mistaken for, instant and synchronous. Although digital forms\nsuch as text and `instant' messaging certainly involve time/space compression, there is\nnot time/space dissolution, with the separation at the root of epistolary intent still exist-\ning, albeit with the communications involved arriving with considerable rapidity and\npermitting similarly rapid response.\nThe letter's simulacra of presence character has been one of its most widely remarked\nupon aspects (cf. Milne, 2010), with its power for the recipient being that it bears many\ntraces of its writer, such as their handwriting, touch on the paper, and licking of stamps.\nBut the fourth `death of the letter'argument is the claim that there is an absolute difference\nbetween the letter on paper and the electronic form that epistolary communications can\ntake (cf. Jolly, 2011), with such traces of touch and presence being absent from the latter.\nMore prosaically, in fact many standard letters lack simulacra of presence aspects.\nBetween familiars, for instance, letters need not include personal address or signature.\nAnd more generally, letters are now mainly word processed, not hand-written, and are\nfrequently sent as file attachments with e-signatures. In addition, the digital form pro-\nduces many simulacra of presence aspects; these include the use of emoticons, personal-\nised sign-offs, accompanying photographs or other adornments. And they are often saved,\nincluding with personalisations like photographs attached (Danet, 2001; Milne, 2010).\nRelatedly, the letter has also been definitionally associated with its material aspects,\nwith these ensuring it can be re-read and saved and passed on by recipients. This in turn\nmeans that letters can be kept, bought, sold and collected, and consequently have histori-\ncal afterlife and availability for researchers. But the fifth `death of the letter' argument\nproposes that electronic media have introduced a major difference here, because of the\nabsence of the material form and that in the future no letter collections will exist and be\navailable to researchers. Digital communication is, however, a supremely material\nmedium. It involves large amounts of hardware, including computers, cell phones and\ntablets, requires software platforms that shape in very material ways the communications\nengaged in, and is reliant on electricity supply systems or proxy-forms like batteries.\nAlso, an array of traces remains that are or can be made material. Websites stay in exist-\nence long after hosting sites have vanished; email is `there' and can be recovered; and\ntext messages are similarly `there' and available. In addition, people can and do engage\nin their own forms of archiving, some of which involves printing out and making as\nmaterial and `words on paper' as the conventional letter. The result is that, although\nseemingly ephemeral, digital communications are actually more durable that their mate-\nrial predecessors, for while messages may be deleted, this does not mean they are neces-\nsarily obliterated or destroyed, and anyway many users `make material' against the\ngeneral urge to make immaterial in a digital age.\nThese `death of the letter' arguments raise interesting points concerning the impact\nof digital communications on contemporary forms of letter-writing. However, although\nthey indicate important developments that are changing some aspects of epistolarity,\nthey do not substantiate `death of the letter' claims, for the epistolary intent at the root\nremains and new forms of letterness flourish. The broader arguments here about genre\nand epistolarity are returned to in the conclusion, while the discussion now steps back\nfrom `death of the letter' claims to explore a range of letter-writing evidencing `new'\ndevelopments, focusing on their epistolary intent and letterness aspects. The examples\ndiscussed are late-nineteenth and early-20th century letters by feminist writer and social\ntheorist Olive Schreiner, the 1st-century New Testament epistles of St Paul, 1st- and\n2nd-century letters by Roman legionaries, some Second World War love letters, early-\n21st century exchanges between mathematicians, and student emails received during\nYours sincerely, Olive Schreiner\nMuch of the `death of the letter' debate is predicated on there being an `it', `the letter',\nand ignores the different kinds of letters that people actually write and the porous borders\nbetween the letter and other genres. In practice there are many kinds of letter-writing,\nsome evidencing departures from such apparently definitional aspects as absence/pres-\nence, the presumption or otherwise of response, and the letter's materiality. The letters of\nWhen Schreiner died, some 20,000 of her letters existed; and although many were\nlater destroyed by her estranged husband, still a large number \u00ad around 5,000 \u00ad survive\nfrontier of the Eastern Cape of South Africa when there was no `post' and passing stran-\ngers or farm workers took letters to places where there was a collection point. There was\nno specific address for either writer or addressee, and postage stamps might or might not\nbe used depending on a letter's intended destination (Stanley and Salter, 2014). Schreiner\nalso began letter-writing when the conventions are said to have been very constraining.\nDespite this, her letters are familiar, quirky and unsettle conventions. In mid-1902, for\ninstance, she ended a letter to her sister-in-law Fan Schreiner (OS to FS, 30 June 1902)\nwith `Good bye. \"Hier eind it met mijn pen, maar niet mijn hart.\" [Here it ends with my\npen, but not with my heart]'. Its Dutch/taal makes a joke because Fan, Boer by birth,\ncould not speak or write the vernacular while English-speaker Schreiner could. Such\nplayfulness in departing from at the same time as observing epistolary convention is\nfound in many Schreiner letters, perhaps for reasons of writing (because more interesting\nand fun than the routine), perhaps for reasons of reading (because she wrote very much\nfor the other person and their concerns).\nFirstly, Schreiner's letters are very much `bird in flight' in character. They contain\nadditions and subtractions made as she wrote and these evidence her writing process in\nquite a close way. They also have an informal, personalised tone with, for example,\n1870s letters to her eldest sister starting with the exclamatory `Dear Katie!' and contain-\ning such fancifulness as inciting Katie to leave her many children and travel to New\nRush, where diamonds had been discovered. Her letters also engage in explicit genre\ncrossings, straying teasingly or seriously out of the letter and into other forms. An exam-\nple of the former is a letter written as though a telegram to her friend Harry Gie, which\nalso reflexively comments on itself (OS to HG, 24 July 1907); and, of the latter, a letter\nof May 1908 is ostensibly a private one to her acquaintance Emily Hobhouse but is actu-\nally a public address written for Hobhouse to read out on Schreiner's behalf at a women's\nSecondly, the interrupted presence aspects of Schreiner's letter-writing are very clear\nwhen she is in London or Cape Town (e.g. multiple letters to Havelock Ellis on 19 June\n1884), with multiple collections and deliveries enabling exchanges of postcards and let-\nters to facilitate ad hoc meetings. However, for much of her life she lived in country areas\nof South Africa, far from the metropole or urban centres, while her closest friends lived\nin Britain, or in Pretoria, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. But although it might be\nexpected that absence would define letters to them, what actually comes across is the\nimportance of the face-to-face and letter-writing as a means of bridging meetings: past\nmeetings are commented on, present happenings detailed, and future meetings planned\nand expedited.\nThirdly, speed and time/space compression are not absolutes but are experienced rela-\ntive to what existed before. Schreiner's letters provide many comments on such changes\nexperienced as significant, including: in the 1870s, the unexpected arrivals of postboys\nwith letters, leading her to reply at speed so her replies could be taken when they left the\nfarm she lived on; in the 1890s, receiving and sending letters when trains stopped daily\nin Matjiesfontein; and during the Great War (1914\u00ad1918), writing hastily to catch the\nturn-around of the Cape mail steamer. However, the most consequential changes to the\nrhythms of Schreiner's letter-writing came from pony-carts replacing ox-wagons in\ntransporting the post, steamers rather than sail, the Cape Town\u00adMatjesfontin\u00ad\nJohannesburg railway, and the laying of the oceanic telegraph, with their impact demon-\nstrated by marked shifts in the numbers and dating of letters.\nFourthly, there are many Schreiner letters that avoid or obviate simulacra of presence\naspects. These have an abstract quality, with the prime concern being conceptual or theo-\nretical ideas she and her correspondents were interested in. Many of her letters to Karl\nPearson, John Cross, John Merriman and Julia Solly, for instance, come under this head-\ning, as do her public letters (like that ostensibly to Hobhouse) on political matters. There\nare personalisms regarding Schreiner and her addressee in such letters, but these are\nbackground to topics including the character of the emotions, whether beyond reproduc-\ntive systems any important sex differences exist, whether racial oppression would worsen\nin South Africa, and different ways of conceptualising social change.\nFifthly, rather than valorising letters because of their material qualities, Schreiner\nrejected this, at a number of junctures requesting correspondents to destroy her letters,\nwhile in 1913 she burned thousands of people's letters to her and after this destroyed let-\nters once answered. This was connected to Schreiner's awareness there would be a mar-\nket value for her letters and papers and that because of this the lives of her correspondents\nmight become public knowledge against their wishes, explaining such a request to her\nlong-term friend Havelock Ellis in these terms (OS to HE, 29 June 1916). However, her\ndestructions started before she became famous and included manuscripts as well as let-\nters (OS to HE, 28 March 1886). Schreiner's feelings about the materiality of her many\nwritings were clearly more complex, though, with comments across many letters indicat-\ning that her urge to make immaterial and reduce to the virtual was connected with her\nviews about the gap between material representation and an imagined ideal in her mind\nIt might perhaps be suggested that, as a writer of fiction as well as fact, Olive\nSchreiner's letters are exceptional in flouting or traversing genre conventions, because\nwritten by someone used to playing with words. However, these things are by no means\nrare, and many earlier and also later examples can be found. A number of these, starting\nwith the 1st-century epistles of St Paul, and continuing through to the 21st-century emails\nof students, are now considered.\nPaul ... to the Church of God which is at ...\nThere are seven New Testament letters of St Paul accepted as genuine second generation\nones (i.e. at one remove from the first generation who had known Jesus).4 These were\nwritten by Paul on his own or with other writers and most often Timothy, with other let-\nters appearing under his name actually being third and fourth generation ones.5 Six were\nwritten by a scribe with some concluding passages in Paul's own hand and mix both\npublic and private characteristics, while the seventh (Philemon) is more straightfor-\nwardly a personal letter. They are the product and expression of Paul's mission, which\nconcerned the `Jesus group' communities he had founded in various non-Israelite cities.\nThe letters have no date or address, expect for the time and place of writing with its\nuncertainties of travel and delivery. They also have both a unitary and a split author-\nship. They were authorised and probably dictated by Paul; the opening statement of\nauthorship, although starting with Paul and his status, also includes Timothy, a close\nassociate who carried out many co-tasks related to Paul's mission. The letters are\naddressed, with one exception (Philemon), to `the Church' or `brothers and sisters' and\nwere intended to be read aloud, as probably around just 1\u00ad2% of people could read and\nfewer write. The letters require a high context of knowledge to unpack (e.g. `to the\nGentiles'means to Jesus group members living among Gentiles, `Jews'means Judeans,\nand so on; see Malina and Pilch, 2006). Their content is concerned with specific situ-\nations and events, addressed in the letters. Notable features concern the absence of\nresponse, interrupted presence, the wider pattern of reciprocal exchanges, and the ends\nof the letters.\nThese letters by St Paul are `ordinary letters', rather than epistles (a public form akin\nto an edict), for they have specific address (albeit of a collective kind) and are `personal'\nin being sent by a named person and concerned with influencing the beliefs and practices\nof the people addressed. At the same time, rather like an epistle, Paul's letters do not\nrequire direct reply but are to be acted upon, with an epistolary response consequently\ninappropriate. That is, Paul's letters are concerned with promoting faith in action and\nwere part of mechanisms to support, troubleshoot or admonish the Jesus groups regard-\ning this.\nIt might be thought, given the wide dispersal of the groups concerned, that St Paul's\nletters were written in clear circumstances of absence. In fact they are of an interrupted\npresence kind. The groups were founded around Paul's face-to-face presence; and while\nthe letters troubleshoot specific circumstances at a remove, the context is of further face-\nto-face visits by Paul and Timothy planned within the letters concerned (e.g. 2 Corinthians\n12:14\u00ad13:4). The letters were in fact part of a continued pattern of relational exchanges\ninvolving but by no means confined to the epistolary. Thus information was clearly\nexchanged in multiple directions through the visits and face-to-face meetings as well as\nletters. There are other signs of relationality in the letters too, including the complex\nways that `you' and `we' pronouns are used in indicating community and reciprocity\n(2 Corinthians 1:3\u00ad7, 1:8\u00ad11) and which change when dealing with conflicts and back-\nsliding (Galatians 3:1).\nThe letters of St Paul trouble contemporary as well as present-day conventions con-\ncerning what a letter consists of. While they are clearly letters rather than epistles\n(although often referred to as such), the presumption they enshrine is of non-response.\nThey have multiple writers but under the name of Paul; they are predominantly public\ndocuments for an oral purpose; and they were written at a remove but presume the face-\nto-face. Who writes, how, and for what practical purposes, trumps any conventions.\nFarewell, sister, my dearest soul as I hope to prosper, and\nhail\nEqually complex issues exist concerning the Vindolanda tablets. These are postcard-\nsized wafer-thin pieces of wood on which Roman legionaries stationed at a garrison\nalong Hadrian's Wall (in the north of Britain) wrote letters, inventories, accounts, reports\nand lists, mainly through their scribes. Preserved because thrown away as rubbish and\ncovered by peat when the garrison moved on, their contents provide much information\nabout everyday life at Vindolanda between 80 and 122 AD.\nThere are over 1600 Vindolanda tablets transcribed, with many also translated into\nEnglish (http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/tablets/index.shtml).6 For many, fragments\nrather than the entirety of the tablets survive, but enough exists to discern that many\nconform to the conventions of the Roman letter regarding opening salutation and signa-\nture, message body, and closing formulations (Bowman, 2004; Ceccarelli, 2014; Stowers,\n1986). The contents are very varied and include complaints about friends not replying to\nVindolanda letters also provide examples of departures from then-prevailing epistolary\nconventions. Three aspects, concerning the ends of the letter, the performative character\nof many, and the role of letters as a means to bridge interrupted presence and the face-\nto-face, are noteworthy.\nThe Vindolanda tablets were written between comrades and friends who were all\npart of the business of empire as carried out by frontier troops, with an effectively\nuniversal level of literacy. The people concerned lived in the equivalent of a small vil-\nlage and would have known each other face-to-face as well as through epistolary and\nassociated exchanges. Their letters are embedded aspects of the workings of the gar-\nrison and its administrative and military hierarchies and are in effect business and\norganisational letters.\nThe garrison was composed of a tightly-knit and highly interdependent set of people,\nmainly but not exclusively male, organised around marked divisions of labour (Birley,\npeople connected by the ties of amicitia, in which friendship, economic activity, family\nand polity mapped onto each other (Stowers, 1986). Thus many Vindolanda letters use\nthe language of amicitia in references to brothers and sisters, with the closeness of these\nbonds indicated by colloquialisms and warmth of expression (233, 260), and by frequent\nreferences to the face-to-face in recalling previous meetings and planning future ones\nThe divisions between `letter' and `not letter' at Vindolanda consequently have com-\nplexities, and many of them are highly performative in Austin's (1962) sense of the\nterm, being in themselves the execution of their content. Military commands sent in\nepistolary form are the obvious example here (e.g. 215). Also, while many Vindolanda\ntablets have an epistolary form, their contents are, for instance, accounts or inventories\nsandwiched between the tight conventions of openings and closings; and these letter/\naccounts and letter/inventories too are performative in providing the account or listing\nthe items concerned.\nWIN\nIn my mother's jewellery-box after her death there was a transparent heart-shaped piece\nof early plastic with `WIN' in red inside it. This was made by my father after he was\nconscripted into the navy during the Second World War and sent to my mother, who was\nnot a reading and writing woman. It is a letter in transparently material form: her name\nas its addressee is written large, his authorship can be seen in its making, their relation-\nship and the sending of love from one to the other is made visible. My father died first;\nafter my mother's death, there was a box in her dressing table containing sheets of paper\nin envelopes, perhaps fifty of them. The address they were from, on the envelope, was a\nholding one provided by the military authorities. They had been dispatched from various\nplaces including latterly a prisoner-of-war camp, and were dated only if postmarks were\nlegible. Inside each a single sheet. All expressed similar messages to that of the plastic\nlove-heart: my mother's name surrounded by many small hearts, both of their names\ninside a heart, messages with Joe and Win, Win and Joe, joined by verbs like love and\nmiss, and ended always with kisses \u00ad `XXX'. And also nearly always at the bottom was\n`XXX to Bobby' (my brother).\nThe letter here was in a way tangible, but stripped to the bone, to elements my mother\ncould read and write in return: a formal address she could copy, their names enjoined\nfrom one to the other, a message of continuing love expressed as hearts and kisses, and\nthe repeated return gift of the letter. The past tense is used here, for they were cremated\nwith my mother and both her and my father's ashes scattered together. I kept the heart,\nfor love, and for remembering that while it may not be `a letter' it articulates the quintes-\nsence of epistolary intent and displays considerable letterness.\nMathematicians do it differently. Two mathematician friends, one working in a large\nuniversity and the other a nearby college, were debating a technical point about catastro-\nphe theory when I knew them in the early 2000s.7 They carried out long-running\nexchanges about this, combining face-to-face meetings, email, and occasional letters that\naccompanied journal articles and papers. Bumping into Z, the university component, he\nproduced with both amusement and chagrin a postcard just received. Its entire message\nhis colleague X saying `you're making a mountain out of a molehill, don't forget the\nobvious, for all practical purposes the complexities add up to something quite clear'. X's\npostcard was making a serious point by using the simplest of all mathematical equations\nto indicate he thought something was being made over-complicated. His point was\npushed home by being expressed in a succinct epistolary form, although softened by the\n`it's a joke' exclamation mark, and the question mark raising the possibility of response.\nZ and X's exchanges were `high context' ones, needing specialist insider knowledge,\nincluding to be aware that the postcard's message was a joke. The postcard clearly had\nepistolary intent; it was sent as part of relational exchanges occurring in situations of\ninterrupted presence combined with the face-to-face; and albeit a postcard, it incited\nresponse. The epistolary form was used in varied ways in my friends'exchanges; and this\nparticular example was written to make the point `in your face'. There is little of `the\nletter' here, although epistolary intent is clear and the letterness aspect abounds.\nHi Liz\nThe last example is a counter-case and concerns student emails. Danet's (2001) discus-\nsion of some research she carried out comments on various departures, in the email she\nreceived about this from colleagues and students, from core aspects of what `the letter'\nis, with such things as address, salutation and signature omitted. She notes that vestiges\nof the conventions remained, but sees the direction of change as moving away from epis-\ntolary conventions, with email and related digital forms of communication establishing\ntheir own counter-conventions.\nMore than a decade on, in reviewing the email sent to me by undergraduate students\nin the academic years 2012\u00ad2014 as their personal `director of studies', and as course\norganiser of a large interdisciplinary course, what stood out is that these were predomi-\nnantly written in a formal letter way, albeit with a ubiquitous `Hi Liz' at the start. They\nhave address, the body of the message is clear and `about something' expressed in fairly\nstandard ways, frequently propose face-to-face meetings, and sign off with precision by\nidentifying their degree and year and any particular course referred to. The concluding\nsignature, however, parallels the opening and is of a `Bye, John/Janet' informal, quasi-\nconversational kind.\nBut is this a one-off exception to the more general rule Danet proposes, of students\nsending the equivalent of text messaging regardless of the communications medium and\ncircumstances? A quick check with some colleagues indicates not, that others too receive\nsimilar rather formal email letters. Is it then a matter of context, of a particular university\nand its conventions, or that in formal situations or times of trouble, people fall back on\nconventional ways of conducting themselves? Perhaps something of both. And this is\nsurely the point, that it might be expected that `at the start' of new social practices, their\nnewness is accentuated, while over time they become assimilated into pre-existing\nThe Letter and Letterness: The Phoenix and the Fire\nWhat has been argued here regarding the different examples discussed is that it is by no\nmeans so simple as, `once there was the letter, now the letter is dead or dying'. From\nearly on, departures from the conventions of form and content can be found. Some\nexpress the porous character of the epistolary form and the inventiveness of letterness,\nwhile others bring new practices and new forms of epistolarity into being. And so, what\nof `the letter' and questions of genre and genre assemblage?\nGenre conformity, porous departures from the normative and new departures have co-\nexisted over time, and of course the existence of departures requires the existence of\n(changing) conventions. There is, as the discussion has shown, evidence of variability in\nforms of letterness and mixtures of (anti)conventions stretching from the 1st to the 21st\ncentury. However, epistolary intent has persisted and, the signs strongly suggest, has\nbecome enhanced in the recent period, although by slow accretion the processes of genre\nassemblage have eventuated in different prevailing conventions at different points in time.\nSome aspects of this are connected with individual and group customising of the form\nin which particular epistolary exchanges occur. Aspects of the letters of St Paul regarding\ntheir mode of address, the ways in which blessings are given, as well as their bridging of\nthe written and face-to-face, come under this heading. Other examples include Schreiner's\nearly 1870s `feast or famine' circumstances when no sooner did the post arrive than it\nhad to be replied to, and my father and mother's innovations, which retained epistolary\nintent and letterness alongside the absence of the letter as such. The particular material\nform of the Vindolanda tablets, wooden rather than wax because of local circumstances,\nalso comes under the heading of customising, while their content demonstrates the situ-\national aspects of the form of and departures in epistolary exchanges. The `brothers and\ncomrades' emphasis in many of these exchanges, and particularly the strongly performa-\ntive character of many Vindolanda letters, is relevant here, as is their mixture of the\nepistolary and face-to-face.\nThe existence of normativising trends is also clear, with technological, personal, con-\ntextual and situational changes becoming incorporated and made more or less consonant\nwith what existed before. Schreiner's letter-writing practices, for instance, altered their\nrhythms according to changes of place, and quickly accommodated to technological\ndevelopments. The exchanges between my parents, which had never occurred pre-war,\naccommodated both their particular circumstances and the externally imposed ones of\ncompelled absence and the military structuring of place. And whatever the personal\ninclinations of the university students, their written engagements with `authority' in situ-\nations of perceived necessity were also normativised, but in the direction of conformity\nto `the letter' in its standard formulation.\nHowever, what is certainly not being argued is that nothing has changed. All the\nexamples discussed provide evidence of change, of small shifts and modifications and\nalso of larger technological and other factors impacting on not only `the letter' but also\nperceptions and deployments of letterness. To say that impact is patchy, that the effects\ndiffer in different circumstances and for different people, and that things become norma-\ntivised, is, after all, no more than to say `change'. But there are some developments\nassociated with digital communications technologies, discussed earlier, which do seem\nto indicate significant departures, and these are now returned to.\nCompression in time/space has been a feature of all the new communications tech-\nnologies mentioned, from the ox-waggon to the pony-cart to the railway, the steamer,\ntelegraph, 1d post, rapid deliveries, postcard and telegram. These have been accommo-\ndated, leaving the letter alive, and each time with the sense that communication was\nquicker, arrival more certain, and the form impacted on. Such changes have occurred in\na context of relational exchanges which ordinary letter-writing was a part of but, except\nin specific circumstances, not the whole, and with the face-to-face and interrupted pres-\nence rather than permanent absence being key to most. However, while the time/space\ncompressions that now exist \u00ad round-world exchanges in seconds \u00ad may not be different\nin kind from previous ones, they are different in degree, and the brevity is seductive.\nThe `death of the letter' debate tends to conflate time and space; but although time\nspans have been greatly diminished in digital communications, this is not so for separa-\ntions of space and place. Consequently, although reach has been enormously enhanced in\ntemporal respects, in spatial terms it remains fairly unchanged.8 Succinctly, there is still\na `here and now' of writing and `there and then' of reading, with significant changes to\nthe relationship between `now and then' but not between `here and there'.\nNonetheless, there is that temporal compression, of diminishing time between writing\nand receiving, and this is clearly underpinning a sense that an `in touch' ontology is\ndeveloping, in fact has already developed for many people, perhaps by means of text\nmessaging even more than other platforms. The exchanges of text messages can concern\nthe monumental, although the indications are that it is the interrupted presence and ordi-\nnary life communications that are favoured, of making arrangements, fixing meetings,\nrequesting information or help, and generally oiling the relational wheels (Ling, 2008).\nIt is not only the speed of possible exchanges that is involved here. Surely the more\nsignificant development is that, through a tacit mutual consent, the form is being used for\nwriting of different and more equalising kind which \u00ad ` U 2' \u00ad approximates to func-\ntional literacy kinds of writing and reading. The enormous upsurges of email, text and\n`instant' messaging, the brevity and stripped-down character of these messages, the tol-\neration of mistakes and omissions, and the coming together of speech-like synchronous\nforms and asynchronous written ones, are producing a major extension of writing as a\nquotidian activity as an important if unanticipated result of developments in digital com-\nmunications. The strongly evident persistent desire for connection across time and space\nand the ways in which digital technologies are used both to transform and to enhance this\nis surely remarkable and fascinating. Epistolary intent is fundamental to the ways in which\npeople seek to communicate in circumstances of absence/interrupted presence, and the\ninventiveness in how they use digital communications to do so is helpfully seen in letter-\nness terms as indicative of the porous and morphing ways in which this intent is made\nmanifest.\nPerhaps the appropriate conclusion to draw is that, while the letter may be ailing, new\ndigital forms of communication are enabling the expression of epistolary intent in a wide\narray of ways, with letterness taking new forms around the time/space compressions\ninvolved. However, while time compression is `real', that concerning space is not. Perhaps\nin the longer run new forms of epistolarity that make more of an impact on space as well\nas time might come into being, and so it might really be a matter of `watch this space'.\nFunding\nMy thanks to the ESRC for funding the Olive Schreiner Letters Project (RES\u00ad062\u00ad23\u00ad1286) and\nalso for a Professorial Research Fellowship (ES J022977/1) on `Whites Writing Whiteness', with\nboth drawn on here.\nNotes\n1. Reviewing the contents of key journals and textbooks shows a dearth regarding everyday\nwritings; for instance, while recognising reading as production, Storey's (1999) useful dis-\ncussion of everyday cultural consumption does not engage with the everyday production of\nquotidian written forms such as notes, cards and letters.\n2. For instance, in an interesting study of long-distance partnerships, 71% never wrote letters,\nbut 62% emailed several times a day and 30% sent multiple texts a day (Holmes, 2006).\n3.
