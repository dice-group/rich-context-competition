Introduction\nFollowing the 25th anniversary of Wilson's Sociobiology: The New Synthesis\n(1975) the status of sociobiology was much discussed by both supporters and\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\nopponents. Wilson had boldly predicted that it would subsume the social sciences.\nPerhaps in reaction to such boldness, critics subjected it to one attack after another\n(e.g., Gould, Lewontin, Kamin, etc.). These early attacks were often laced with\npolitical overtones, taking the debate beyond the halls of science. They accused\nsociobiologists of reductionism, genetic determinism and, in one notorious case, of\nsomething verging on Nazi complicity (Segerstr\u00e5le, 2000, p. 14). Over the years, the\nattacks have been answered as often as they have been made, yet there still remain a\nfew disgruntled scientists who just don't get it (Rose and Rose, 2001). In 2001,\nAlcock hailed The Triumph of Sociobiology. It seemed the traditional attacks against\nit had finally withered away. However, controversy remains around the descendent of\nsociobiology, evolutionary psychology (EP).\nThe controversy has changed, somewhat, over the past few years. Attacks\ntarget the ideas of EP's prominent theorists (e.g., Pinker, 1997; Tooby and Cosmides,\n1992; Buss, 1994) rather than the general premise of an evolutionary perspective on\npsychology. We do not deny that political ideology continues to influence the debate,\nbut across the social sciences most of the arguments now focus on theoretical and\nmethodological issues rather than on ideology. Sociology, however, remains as an\nexception (Cornwell, Hetterscheidt, Palmer, and Davis, 2001). It continues to hold\nDarwinian explanations under suspicion, and expresses this in terms that have not\nchanged since the heyday of the sociobiology wars of the late 70s and early 80s (for a\nthorough treatment see Segerstr\u00e5le, 2000).\nThe acceptance of a Darwinian perspective varied across the social sciences.\nTo understand this, a bit of history is needed. While it is not our intention to deliver a\ndetailed account of the history of evolutionary theory in the social sciences (the\nsubject has already been superbly treated by Carl Degler in his book In Search of\nHuman Nature, (1991), a brief account is warranted for sake of clarity.\n1.1. Historical Factors Affecting Psychology's Acceptance of Sociobiology /\nEvolutionary Psychology\nTwo early influences on the social sciences were Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and\nCharles Darwin. The Lamarckian view of evolution implied directive or purpose for\nnature to follow, while Darwin's theory of natural selection appeared far more brutish\nand meaningless. Lamarckism was more acceptable to progressive Victorian\nsensibilities, and this seduction still dogs the social sciences. Its vestigial appeal is\nespecially curious considering the modern-synthesis and the work of Weismann\ndismissed the theory; and, one might have expected Larmarckism to be but a footnote\nto the history of biology. This was not to be the case. Social scientists found\nLamarck's theory of inheritance and acquired characteristics to fit in all too well with\nthe desire to solve all social ills through changes to the environment. The science of\n`environmentalism' would become an important tool to be used by social reformers to\nfight against social inequities and injustice. That the theory behind their science was\nwrong was simply ignored. Thus, the division between the natural and social sciences\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\nsharpened. As the theory of natural selection ascended to prominence in the\nbiological sciences, it was being systematically extirpated from the social sciences.\nThere was, however, one very notable exception. The development of\npsychology was strongly influenced by ties to physiology and animal studies. Darwin\nbrought an evolutionary perspective to the study of behavior with the publications of\nThe Descent of Man (1871) and Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animal\n(1872). Naturalists such as Romanes focused on animal behavior in order to\ndemonstrate the continuum between animals and humans. By the end of the 19th\ncentury, psychology was primarily a laboratory science focusing on internal\npsychological phenomenon; however, the contributions of the methods and ideas of\nthe physiological and biological sciences were significant. For example, Wilhelm\nPsychologie (Principles of Physiological Psychology), and William James accorded\nbiological sciences a prominent place in his classic Principles of Psychology (1890).\nDarwin's influence is reflected in James' emphasis on creating a physiological\nperspective of psychology within the `context of evolutionary theory' and to `situate\npsychology within the domain of the natural sciences.' (Taylor, 1990). These early\ninfluences of biology and the continuity between animal and man would remain an\nimportant, if somewhat temporarily silent, aspect within psychology.\nDespite these influences, psychology was not immune to the\nenvironmentalism sweeping the social sciences, and it too fell victim to the strong\nanti-biology rhetoric that emphasized the influence of environment. The commitment\nof the environmentalists led to the ascendancy and protracted period of behaviorism.\nJ. B. Watson, the father of American behaviorism, was a strong proponent of animal\nexperiments (Degler, 1991). Early in his career he emphasized `no dividing line\nbetween man and brute' (Degler, 1991). This changed as Watson began to focus on\nhumans, and in practice he eventually abandoned the idea of human instincts arguing\nthat human emotions were a conditioned response. This view of human behavior as\nbeing wholly malleable opened the floodgates to extreme environmentalism and the\nabandonment of a Darwinian approach. For the next 30 years, the behaviorist's model\nwould come to dominate psychology in the U.S.A. In its most extreme form, the\nbehaviorist Zing Yang Kuo, described as `out Watsoning Watson' (Degler, 1991, p.\n158), virtually denied any role to biology. Many behaviorists implicitly\nacknowledged the importance of biology (e.g., in the case of B. F. Skinner see the\nemphasized it in their research. The majority of the emphasis was on observable\nbehavior and the general laws of learning; the human infant was viewed as a tabula\nrasa with virtually no built-in predispositions (Skinner, 1953). Behaviorism\ninundated the discipline of psychology, and its grip did not wane until the\ndevelopment of cognitive psychology and a parallel emphasis on the importance of an\norganism's natural history. Influential studies such as Breland and Breland's (1961)\ndemonstration of behavioral drift, the tendency to revert to evolved adaptations;\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\nGarcia and Ervin's (1968) conditioned taste aversion, demonstrating the importance\nof an organism's natural history in the context of its behavior; and Brown and\nJenkins' (1968) study of auto-shaping, indicating that not all stimuli and responses\nare equally associable all helped to reintroduce Darwinism into psychology.\nEventually, the influence of behaviorism and extreme environmentalism was\nweakened as it was recognized that biology offered a broader and more unifying\napproach to psychology. However, the environmental approach remains appealing\nand continues within the social sciences, and contributes to the resistance against\nDarwinian approaches to human behavior. We have examined psychology\nintroductory textbooks to provide a snapshot of the both the status and the acceptance\n(or resistance) of sociobiology/EP within the discipline of psychology.\nAs our measure of how sociobiology and EP have been accepted (or rejected),\nwe have examined freshman level introductory psychology textbooks. Introductory\ntexts are a revealing window into a discipline: Authors must be well versed in all\nareas and sub-disciplines within the field, and for a theoretical concept to gain\nadmittance into an introductory text it must be of acknowledged significance.\nBecause textbook authors cannot be experts in every aspect of their discipline, they\nmust rely on the common assessments and ideas held by others, and are therefore\nvulnerable to widely perceived misunderstandings and misinterpretations.\nIntroductory textbooks conveniently and revealingly disclose widespread assumptions\nheld by academics about a discipline. Accordingly we have examined the\nintroductory textbooks that have been published in the 30 years since Sociobiology.\n2. Methods\nWe examined 262 introductory textbooks spanning a period of 30 years,\nbeginning with 1975, the year Sociobiology was published, and up through the year\n2004. Books were grouped into 5-year periods and assessed according to five criteria:\n(1) does the text discuss any theoretical aspects of sociobiology or EP; (2) is the\ntreatment of sociobiology or EP accurate or inaccurate; (3) was the treatment of\nsociobiology or EP neutral/positive or negative; (4) the topic discussed; and (5) the\nsociobiology and EP theorists cited.\n2.1. Does Text Discuss Sociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology?\nWhether or not a textbook discussed sociobiology or EP was broken down\ninto three classifications: a) nothing, b) citation only, and c) treated. In order to apply\nthese classifications we needed a working definition that would include both\nsociobiology and evolutionary psychology. Following Alcock, we found E. O.\nWilson's one-sentence definition of sociobiology (`the systematic study of the\nbiological basis of all social behaviors' (Wilson, 1975, p. 4)) to be too broad, and that\n\"in reality persons who call themselves sociobiologists [or evolutionary\npsychologists], or at least those who tolerate this label, invariably use evolutionary\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\ntheory as the primary analytical tool for their work\" (2001:10). Thus we regarded as\nsociobiologists or evolutionary psychologists, authors who explicitly used natural\nselection to explain behavior, and had appeared to at least tolerate the label of\n\"sociobiologist\" or \"evolutionary psychologist.\" . Although this definition proved to\nbe relatively easy to apply in our examination of textbooks, it does have the drawback\nof excluding earlier works that explicitly addressed evolutionary reasons for behavior,\nbut occurred before the label of sociobiology was established (e.g., Ardry, 1966;\nWe counted the topic of sociobiology or EP as having been discussed only\nwhen a textbook explicitly mentioned sociobiology or EP, or linked a specific\nhypothesis to sociobiology or EP. To further refine our data, we included the\nclassification `citation only' to note textbooks that include data and findings from\nsociobiologists or evolutionary psychologists but failed to make explicit any\nconnection to sociobiology or EP. Daly and Wilson's work on stepchild abuse is a\ncommon example found in psychology textbooks.\n2.2. Is the Treatment of Sociobiology/EP Accurate or Inaccurate?\nAnother category we tracked was whether or not the text was accurate or\ninaccurate. As some authors came excruciatingly close to misrepresenting theoretical\npremises, not so much for what they wrote but for their omissions, we developed a\nguideline to judge a textbook's accuracy. Certain concepts were considered to be\nclearly inaccurate, including the all too familiar standard accusations of genetic\ndeterminism, learning and/or environment not being important, the naturalistic\nfallacy, and for the more politically minded, the ever faithful maintenance of the\nstatus quo. However, if the authors attempted to present a balanced view or premised\ninaccurate concepts as attacks made by the opponents of sociobiology or EP, the text\nwas classified as accurate (since the representation of the criticism itself was not\nincorrect). If the criticism leveled was inaccurate, or was presented as widely\naccepted, unresolved, or matter of fact then the text was defined as inaccurate. For\nexample, in the case of the naturalistic fallacy, Ratus (1984) states \"Sociobiology also\nseems to suggest that aggressiveness is natural and desirable. Thus, efforts to control\naggression can be seen as doomed to failure and even morally questionable, as\ninterfering with the natural order of things.\" (p.14).\n2.3. Is the Treatment of Sociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology Negative or Positive?\nOur third category examined the negative or positive/neutral treatment of\nsociobiology or EP. Negative tone was defined as any text characterized in an\nunpopular or undesirable manner. Inaccurate text per se was not necessarily classified\nas a negative treatment; rather it would have to be clearly biased in its representation\nof inaccurate and negative criticisms. We combined positive and neutral into one\nclassification to remove any ambiguity from the classification. An example of a\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\npositive treatment comes from Mussen and Rosenzweig's textbook (1977)\n`Evolutionary interpretations of behavior and behavioral mechanisms will become\nmore powerful and more widespread... which some are already calling\n`sociobiology'.' An example of a negative tone can be found in Dworetzky's\ntextbook (1985) in which he wrote of sociobiology as a form of genetic determinism\nand `The ideas of sociobiology are disturbing, and to some, even shocking.' Often\ntextbooks reflected a negative tone without explicitly attacking sociobiology or EP.\nTheir negative bias often came from the caveats and criticisms presented. For\nexample, if it read, `Most psychologists do not accept the tenets of sociobiology or\nEP...' or ended the discussion with unanswered criticisms, thus leaving na\u00efve\nundergraduates with disparaging impressions, the treatment was assessed as negative.\n2.4. Topics Discussed.\nOur fourth category tracked topics specific to sociobiology or EP. To do this\nwe examined the percent of books covering a topic, and counted the number of\nparagraphs devoted to the overview of sociobiology and/or EP, or to a more specific\ntopic, such as kin selection. The category of topics was divided into the following\nclassifications: sociobiology, EP, altruism, parental care, kin selection, mating\nstrategies, gender differences, personality, aggression, and other.\n2.5. Major Author Citations During the Last 30 Years.\nOur final category looked at citations, and we counted those attributed to the\nmajor theorists in sociobiology and EP. This allowed us to examine the changes over\nthe past 30 years. Specifically, we tracked E.O. Wilson, W.D. Hamilton, R. Trivers,\nand R. Dawkins and a few others as leading sociobiology theorists and Tooby and\nCosmides, Daly and Wilson, Buss, and Kendrick and a few others as leading EP\ntheorists.\n3. Results\nA total of 262 introductory psychology textbooks, over 75% of the U.S.A.\nmarket, were examined and we treated these as the population of introductory texts\nrather than a sample. The text obtained constituted a very large sample of convince,\nwith text from the 'vanity press' or obscure publishers the most likely to be excluded.\nOur sample contains text from the leading publishers in the U.S.A., thus, we have no\nreason to believe that our sample would be biased for or against EP. Accordingly, we\nprovide descriptions of the population rather than statistics on a sample. As indicated\nin Figure 1, over the past 30 years, there has been a significant increase in the number\nof books that discuss either sociobiology or EP.\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\nFigure 1: The number of books by 5-year periods that included nothing concerning\nsociobiology and/or evolutionary psychology, citation only, or discussed the topic is\nshown for introductory psychology textbooks.\nTime Period\nPercent of Books\nNothing\nCitation Only\nDiscussed\nExtent of Coverage\nIn the first period after the publication of Wilson's Sociobiology, few\ntextbooks discussed sociobiology. During the 80s about half the books discussed\neither sociobiology or EP. The 90s reflect a further increase to about 80% of text, and\nthe last period indicates that virtually all textbooks now discuss sociobiology/EP. The\nfocus too has changed, shifting to EP while sociobiology is seldom mentioned in the\nlast 5 years.\nThe category `Accuracy of Treatment' in Figure 2 shows a constant increase\nin the accuracy of treatment up until the last time period. Early inaccuracies were\neasy to identify because they frequently involved errors such as the naturalistic\nfallacy, or claims that sociobiology/EP promoted genetic determinism. The greater\ncoverage of sociobiology/EP during the last time period may have left more room for\ninaccuracies to occur, and the greater depth of discussion appears to have made way\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\nfor more frequent and subtler inaccuracies. For example, adaptations are equated with\nflexibility, and natural selection is sometimes described as acting through differential\nsurvival rather than reproduction.\nFigure 2: The number of books with accurate versus inaccurate discussion of\nsociobiology and/or evolutionary psychology is shown in 5-year periods for\nintroductory psychology textbooks.\nTime Period\nPercent of Books\nAccurate\nInaccurate\nAccuracy\nTone of treatment presented in Figure 3 indicates that the positive reception of\nsociobiology and/or EP within introductory textbooks has increased.\nIn particular, the last 5-year period with about 75% of the textbooks falling\ninto the positive/neutral category, shows a marked change over the past 25 years.\nThe nature of topics discussed, such as a general overview of sociobiology,\nEP, altruism, kin selection, parental investment, mating strategies were tracked over\nthe 30 year period and changes and trends are indicated in Figure 4a and 4b.\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\nFigure 3: The number of books with negative versus positive/neutral treatment of\nsociobiology and/or evolutionary psychology is shown in 5-year time periods for\nintroductory psychology textbooks.\nTime Period\nPercent of Books\nPositive/Neutral\nNegative\nTone of Treatment\nWhile all topics have shown some increase, for specific topics it is EP and\nmating strategies that have made the most dramatic gains.\nFigure 4a and 4b: The topics discussed within introductory psychology textbooks\nare shown by 5-year periods as percentage books (4a) and as number of paragraphs\nallotted (4b).

Discussion\nThe data from introductory psychology textbooks reflect both good and bad\nnews concerning the treatment of sociobiology and/or EP. The good news is that\nsociobiology and EP have gained increasing exposure, better and more accurate\ntreatment, a more positive slant, and less undefended criticisms. Most encouraging\nhave been two recent introductory textbooks by Peter Gray (2002) and Drew Westen\n(2002). Both books take a much more integrative approach and expose the reader to\nan evolutionary perspective covering a variety of areas (e.g. cognition, family life,\npsychopathology, etc.).\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\nThe bad news is that far too many of the textbooks appear to have narrowed\nthe discipline to mating strategies (Figure 4a and 4b). The research on mating\nstrategies may be of particular interest to college students (and sex does sell). But if\nmating strategy is offered as the most prominent representation of sociobiology or EP\nwhile giving much less attention to topics such as parent-offspring conflicts, social\ninteraction, development, and cognition, many students will remain ignorant of the\nintegrative nature of an evolutionary approach. As previously noted, David Buss's\nwork is represented in excess compared to the work of other noted Darwinian\npsychologists. These data are troubling when one considers undergraduates might\nconclude that EP is mainly a science of mating strategies studied by David Buss. He\nwould be the first to agree this perception is far from accurate.\n4.1. Potential Problems on the Path to Disciplinary Success.\nThere appear to be several potential problems for the future of EP. First, there\nis the question as to whether EP should focus solely on human behavior. Second, is\nEP threatening to become too narrow? Third, should EP be considered a sub-\ndiscipline of psychology? And finally, how should EP be defined, and what are the\nimplications?\nOn the first issue, psychologists like Martin Daly and Margo Wilson (1999)\nhave cogently argued for EP to maintain strong ties with comparative psychology,\nshould focus on the study of the human mind. This is not merely a squabble over how\nto define the term, it is a squabble as to the value, methods, and theoretical\nframework of EP in the future and perhaps more importantly, it defines its\npractitioners. If EP chooses the latter it is in danger of not only greatly limiting itself\nby isolationism, but it threatens to once again exaggerate the gap between human and\nnon-human animals. This must not be considered lightly, and we hope the strength of\nthe arguments offered by Daly and Wilson (1999) guides EP away from the path of\nanthropocentrism.\nThe second danger against which EP must guard is the narrowing of the field.\nAs noted, the specific topic most often discussed in introductory textbooks was\nmating strategies. While mating strategy is certainly very interesting, it is hardly\nrepresentative of EP's diversity. Evolutionary psychologists studying other aspects of\nbehavior must make their work better known to those individuals writing the\nintroductory textbooks.\nThe third potential problem for EP is whether or not it should become a sub-\ndiscipline or a perspective within psychology. There are certainly cogent arguments\nfor both views. It is no coincidence that the Darwinian perspective within psychology\ngained increased coverage, more favorable reviews, and more accurate treatment\nshortly after the introduction of the term EP. By staking a claim as a sub-discipline,\nwe suggest it produced a sense of ownership garnering more interest among\npsychologists, thus more accurate assessment of the perspective. The benefits of the\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\nname change, however, must be weighed in against its less desirable effects.\n4.2. Is Evolutionary Psychology the New $2.00 Bill?\nThe U.S. government has repeatedly attempted to introduce the $2.00 bill, the\nlast two in 1975 and 1995. Each introduction was publicized, and the idea seemed a\ngood one \u00ad it saved money (reduced printing costs) and, on paper, appeared more\nconvenient. It seemed certain that the $2.00 bill should continue to circulate and\nincrease in popularity\u00ad yet it failed. Why? Anyone who worked in merchandizing at\nthe time of its multiple introductions could have given the answer: there was simply\nno place in the cash drawer for the bills. Cash registers were designed to hold $1.00,\nduring a purchase, the only place he could place the bill was under the cash drawer \u00ad\nalong with $50.00 bills and checks. When it came to giving change, the $2.00 bills\nwere literally `out-of-sight, out-of-mind' and at the end of the day they simply went\nback to the bank. The influence of the design of the cash drawer was simply not taken\ninto consideration and the failure to do so has rendered the $2.00 to an odd little\nfootnote in numismatology. So what has this to do with Evolutionary Psychology?\nPsychology has long held a very rigid set of sub-disciplines recognized by\nacademic psychologists and administrators. Like the bill slots in our cash drawer\nanalogy, these include abnormal, developmental, social, clinical, cognitive,\npersonality, quantitative, comparative, biological, and neuropsychological\npsychology. An applicant to a department who refers to him or herself as an\n`Evolutionary Psychologist' may find that the department does not know where he or\nshe fits into the scheme of the department. If evolutionary psychology continues to\nsee itself as a sub-discipline of psychology, it may find itself a victim of the same fate\nas the $2.00 bill. However, if evolutionary perspective is used to identify the ideas\nand hypotheses stemming from the theory of natural selection, it's a whole new\nballgame. Gone is the need to try to force fit an academic slot, instead it is a ready-\nmade, easily fitted, developmental (or just as easily, a cognitive, clinical, social, etc.)\npsychologist that just happens to hold an evolutionary perspective. It is this\npsychologist who has the better chance of being hired as compared to the\nevolutionary psychologist who may appear to not fit in at all.\n4.3. What's in a Name: Maybe too many Theoretical and Methodological\nCommitments.\nA number of scientists have become concerned with the numerous variations\nof the term `Evolutionary Psychology' and how they influence the area's direction as\nwell as the nature of criticisms against it.\nIn our review of Alas, Poor Darwin (Cornwell, Palmer, and Davis, 2001) we\ndismiss most of the criticisms leveled against EP as vestiges of the sociobiology wars.\nHowever, one of the chapters struck us as providing a viable criticism against a\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\nparticular hypothesis, and we were somewhat perplexed with the assumption that the\nhypothesis was inextricably linked with EP. The chapter was authored by Annette\nKarmiloff-Smith, a well-respected developmental psychologist and author of Beyond\nModularity (1995). While this paper is not the place to discuss the validity of specific\nhypotheses, it does seem relevant to question what hypotheses should define EP and\nthe criticisms against them. To identify the ways EP is defined, we examined both the\nprofessional and popular literature and found a number of discrete and competing\ndefinitions. The list we are presenting is not exhaustive, but it should offer some\ninsight into EP's current identity crisis.\nIn a best selling book about evolutionary psychology, The Moral Animal by\nRobert Wright (1994), EP is defined as `a whole new science of mind' (p. 11). If such\na characterization does not seem detailed enough, at the other extreme we offer\nCaporeal's (2001) more equivocal definition published in the prestigious Annual\nReview of Psychology (authors' note: the use of the third person is cited directly from\nCaporeal's paper):\ntheory and systems approaches (Caporael and Baron, 1997). She\nsuggests that the observation that psychologists attempt to explain by\nresorting to genes is recurrence. Rather than using genes in a\nmetaphoric sense, she proposes a vocabulary based on the `repeated\nassembly' of reliably recurrent resources. Organisms, their settings,\nartifacts, and practices may be repeatedly assembled. The objective of\nevolutionary psychology would then be to understand the system\ndynamics that result in variation, retention, and selection of the\ncomponent parts of repeated assemblies (Caporael 1999). Taking a\nproposes a model of group structure with core subgroup configurations\nbased on considerations of group size and modal tasks... The basic\nhypothesis is that aspects of mental systems should correspond to\nfeatures of modal tasks characteristic to configurations, which in turn\nWe felt that a better definition could be gotten from Cosmides, Tooby, &\nBarkow (1992) often identified as among EP's leading founders. They write\n`Evolutionary psychology is simply psychology that is informed by the additional\nknowledge that evolutionary biology has to offer, in the expectation that\nunderstanding the process that designed the human mind will advance the discovery\nof its architecture. It unites modern evolutionary biology with the cognitive\nrevolution in a way that has the potential to draw together all of the disparate\nbranches of psychology into a single organized system of knowledge (p. 3).' Another\nmore concise definition comes from perhaps one of the most popular evolutionary\npsychologist, David Buss, who writes that it is a way of `understanding the human\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\nmind/brain mechanisms from an evolutionary perspective' (1999). After filtering\nthrough the many definitions of evolutionary psychology, one common thread\nbecame apparent, that is, evolutionary psychology is the study of behavior from an\nevolutionary perspective. Further distinctions remain unsettled.\nCertainly, the theory driving EP is the theory of natural selection (Darwin,\n1859), and the fundamental hypotheses of kin selection (Hamilton, 1964), reciprocal\naltruism (Trivers, 1971), and selfish-gene (Dawkins, 1976) do pervade EP. However,\nsecondary level theories such as good-gene theory (Andersson, 1994), fluctuating\nasymmetry (Thornhill and Gangestad, 1993; Thornhill and Gangestad, 1994), waist-\nTooby, 1992) remain in debate. Herein, we wish to emphasize that their final\noutcome will not determine the success or failure of an evolutionary perspective, and\ntheir discussion is one of thousands of healthy debates found within science on any\ngiven day.\nWith this in mind, it should be disturbing to anyone advocating an\nevolutionary approach that these and other secondary hypotheses are viewed as\ndefining EP. Buller (2000) has noted that some scientists committed to an\nevolutionary perspective of behavior distance themselves from EP because of the\nperceived requirement of a particular theoretical and methodological commitment.\nThese individuals call themselves by labels such as Darwinian anthropologists,\nhuman behavioral ecologists, or human sociobiologists. Scientists with evolutionary\nperspectives have raised questions about the extent to which EP is committed to a\nstudy of human behavior to the exclusion of other species (e.g., Panksepp, and\nWilson (1999) and others (e.g., Shettleworth 2000) have made a strong case for a\ncomparative approach in any evolutionary perspective of cognition. While\nevolutionary psychologists may assert that EP is a way of unifying all of psychology\nor a way of thinking about all psychology problems, it is not clear that the pioneers of\nEP (with the exception of Daly and Wilson) actually extend their work to non-\nhumans. There is also strong concern about the Swiss Army Knife metaphor of the\nmind as a group of highly specialized encapsulated modules (i.e., domain specific in\nthat a module is activated by particular inputs and follows module specific rules for\nprocessing information) that evolved to solve specific problems our ancestors faced\nduring the Pleistocene (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992). For example, Karmiloff-Smith\n(1992) has emphasized the role of development in the selection of modules for\ndomain specific-computations, and Mithen (1996) has developed a provocative\nevolutionary theory of mind where there are general purpose processors as well as\nspecialized modules, and modules that are capable of interaction with other modules\nrather than being encapsulated and domain isolated. Finally, others have questioned\nwhat has been called the predictive agenda of EP (Grantham and Nichols, 1999).\nSpecifically, Cosmides and Tooby (1994) have suggested that by examining the types\nof problems faced by our ancestors in the Pleistocene, evolutionary psychologists will\nbe able to predict a number of cognitive modules that will fit into the Swiss Army\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\nKnife metaphor of mind. Presumably, this will allow a linking of functional cognitive\nmodules to brain areas. Grantham and Nichols note that innate mechanisms for\nlanguage and vision were developed by Chomsky and Marr without consideration of\nthe adaptive problems faced by our ancestors. They argue that Tooby and Cosmides\nhave no basis for claiming that many cognitive mechanisms will be discovered by\nconsidering human's ancestral adaptive problems.\nThe linking of particular hypotheses with an emerging discipline is nothing\nnew. Richard Dawkins (personal communication, 2001) points out that ethology\nstruggled similarly with its identity when it became identified with a particular theory\nof animal behavior, namely Konrad Lorenz's theory of psycho-hydraulic motivation\nand instinct. The main point is that ethology survived very well and EP is likely to\nfollow suit. However, that does not mean that issues should be ignored, and it must be\nmade clear that among supporters of an evolutionary perspective of behavior there is\nroom to debate any number of EP's theoretical and methodological commitments.\nThis after all is science.\n4.4. Political Foes and Straw-Man Issues.\nTooby and Cosmides (1992) have suggested the criticisms and resistance to an\nevolutionary perspective are a result of extreme environmentalism subsumed under\nwhat they and others refer to as the Standard Social Science Model (SSSM). The\nSSSM is based on the conjecture that the human mind is initially a tabula rasa. It is\nthe belief that culture and environment are what primarily shape human behavior; the\npervasiveness of this model provides a strong impetus against all things Darwinian.\nThere is considerable debate over whether the SSSM is an accurate characterization\nof the social sciences, or a strawman (see Rose and Rose 2000). Our study found that\nthe strong biological roots of psychology have impeded the overwhelming influence\nof the SSSM, and, at least when examining psychology textbooks, the SSSM appears\nto be a straw man. although some textbook authors who took a negative attitude\ntoward EP did invoke the importance of environment and culture, the majority of\nauthors noted EP's lack of empirical evidence (ignoring the large number of human\nand animal studies) as its greatest weakness. However, a study of sociology textbooks\n(Cornwell, Palmer, Davis, 2000) indicates that the SSSM is an accurate\ncharacterization of that discipline.\nThe treatment of sociobiology and EP in introductory psychology textbooks\nlikely will continue to expand, if for no other reason than the field cannot be ignored.\nRecently, the primatologist Frans B.M. de Waal predicted that psychology will be\ntransformed by neuroscience and evolutionary psychology (Carpenter, 2001). de\nWaal, often a critic of both sociobiology and EP, contends that the emphasis on a\nDarwinian outlook within psychology is inevitable and necessary (Carpenter, 2001).\nUnfortunately, this shift to biology as the dominant theoretical basis within\npsychology is not likely to come any time soon, at least as indicated in recent\nintroductory textbooks. In most all of the textbooks reviewed, the focus on biology\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\nwas confined to one chapter, and often anything concerning biology was `softened'\nby an emphasis on environment. We found that environmental explanations were\nrarely, if ever, countered with a biological explanation, but the reverse rarely held\ntrue when biological explanations were discussed.\nMuch more work is needed to evaluate fully how sociobiology or EP is being\nintegrated within the social sciences. One step would be to survey university\ninstructors, postgraduates, and undergraduates to assess their basic knowledge and\nattitude regarding sociobiology and EP. Some small surveys assessing knowledge of\nDarwinian theories (natural selection, sexual selection, etc.) have found that among\nbiology and psychology majors, biology majors had a much more accurate and broad\nknowledge of Darwinian concepts (Knapp and Rasmussen, 1998). In a survey of\npsychology majors, Knapp, Rasmussen and Wagner (1997) found that while seniors\nhad a broader knowledge of Darwinian theory than when they began their studies,\nthey saw it as less applicable to psychology than freshmen. The indication that the\nappreciation for the role of biology in human behavior diminishes as the\nundergraduate progresses through his or her studies is more than a little disconcerting.\nHow and why this occurs is only conjectured, but we suggest the SSSM may not be a\nstraw-man after all when it comes to the instruction of undergraduate and even\ngraduate psychology.\nAs disturbing as the aforementioned surveys may be, there has been a great\ndeal of progress made toward the acceptance and integration of sociobiology and EP\nconcepts into psychology. More textbooks are devoting space to the topic and in\ngeneral giving it more positive treatment. More importantly, at least in psychology,\nthe issue of human evolution is increasingly taken into consideration when\nformulating and integrating theories and hypotheses. The neurosciences will continue\nto expand the research on brain functioning, and evolutionary approaches will help\npsychologists understand how and why these functions exist. Many psychologists\nbelieve, just as Darwin contended, that `psychology will be based on a new\nfoundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by\ngradation' (1859, p.458). As we continue to gain an understanding of the ultimate\ncauses of human behavior, we can begin to uncover and understand the proximate\nmechanisms subserving our current behavior.\nSo what is the final judgment on the triumph of sociobiology (and EP)? In\nmany respects it has triumphed and it continues to triumph within the halls of science.\nHowever in the trenches, that being the university classrooms, the battle for the hearts\nand minds of students (and lecturers) is still being fought.\nSociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology's Role in Psychology\n5.
