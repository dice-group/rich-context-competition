Community sur-\nvey data from the 1950s suggest a stronger association\nbetween obesity and depression among those with higher\nsocioeconomic status.21 The associations between depres-\nsion and obesity observed in largely white sample popu-\nlations in the United States and Canada, however, may not\nextend to other cultural or ethnic groups.22,23 Longitudi-\nnal studies have found that depression predicts the sub-\nsequent onset of obesity,24,25 that obesity predicts the sub-\nsequent onset of depression,26 that successful weight loss\nis associated with decreased depression,27 and that depres-\nsion predicts poorer success in weight loss.28,29\nLimited epidemiologic data address the relationship\nbetween obesity and anxiety or substance use disorders.\nAnxiety symptoms have shown moderate positive asso-\nsamples. Alcohol abuse has been associated with a lower\nrisk of overweight and obesity.33\nWe used data from the National Comorbidity Survey\nReplication (NCS-R) to examine whether associations be-\ntween depression and obesity continue to appear in the\nmost recent survey of mental disorders in the United States\nand whether those associations extend to other mental\ndisorders. We focus on the following questions: What are\nthe current associations between obesity and a range of\ncommon mental disorders (mood, anxiety, and sub-\nstance use disorders) in the US population? Do these as-\nsociations vary according to sociodemographic charac-\nteristics: sex, age, race/ethnicity, and educational\nattainment (demographic characteristics consistently as-\nsociated with obesity in the US population)?\nMETHODS\nThe NCS-R was an in-person survey of a nationally represen-\ntative sample of US residents conducted between February 5,\nfrom a multistage area probability sample of the noninstitu-\ntionalized civilian population in the 48 contiguous states. The\nresponse rate was 70.9%. More complete information on the\nmethods of the NCS-R is presented elsewhere.34,35\nPotential participants were mailed a letter and a study fact\nbrochure. This was followed by an in-person interviewer visit.\nInterviewers explained the study procedures and obtained ver-\nbal informed consent before beginning the interview. Partici-\npants received $50 for participating. Recruitment and consent\nprocedures were approved by the human subjects committees\nof Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass, and the University\nof Michigan, Ann Arbor.\nProfessional nonclinician interviewers from the Institute for\nSocial Research at the University of Michigan conducted all as-\nsessments. More than 300 interviewers participated in the study,\neach receiving 7 days of study-specific training and success-\nfully completing 2 practice interviews before beginning field\nwork. Interviews were administered using laptop computer-\nassisted software that included built-in skip logic, timing flags,\nand consistency checks. Regional supervisors recontacted a ran-\ndom 10% of respondents for quality control.\nMental disorders were assessed using the World Mental\nHealth version of the World Health Organization Composite\nInternational Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).36 This fully struc-\ntured diagnostic assessment was developed for use by trained\nnonclinician interviewers in diverse community populations.\nMental disorder diagnoses are based on criteria of the DSM-IV.\nDiagnoses considered in this article include mood disorders (ma-\njor depression, dysthymia, or bipolar disorder I or II), anxiety\ndisorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia without panic, or gen-\neralized anxiety disorder), and substance use disorders (alco-\nhol abuse and dependence or drug abuse and dependence). Pre-\nvious research has documented good concordance between the\nNCS-R CIDI diagnoses and blind clinical diagnoses, with the\nCIDI generally having a higher diagnostic threshold in com-\nparison with blind clinical diagnoses.36\nDemographic characteristics (age, sex, and race/ethnicity),\nheight, and weight were assessed by participants' self-reports.\nPrevious methodological research suggests that self-reported\nheight and weight are highly correlated with direct physical mea-\nsurements,37-39 but self-report tends to consistently underesti-\nmate weight and overestimate height,38-41 leading to low esti-\nmates of overweight and obesity.\nAll analyses were based on weighted data and implemented\nusing SUDAAN statistical software (Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC, 2002). The clustered sampling de-\nsign of the NCS-R study could lead to overestimation of statisti-\ncalsignificance(ie,designeffect).Consequently,significancetests,\nstandard errors, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were esti-\nmated using the Taylor Series method (delta method). All sig-\nnificance tests were made using 2-sided tests evaluated at the .05\nlevel of statistical significance.\nRESULTS\npossible) who provided data on height and weight.\nTable 1 compares respondents with BMIs less than 30\nwith those with BMIs of 30 or more. As expected, those\nwith higher BMIs were more often African American or\nHispanic and were less likely to have completed more than\n12 years of education.\nAs reported in Table 2, lifetime prevalence estimates\nfor mood and anxiety disorders are all higher among those\nwith BMIs of 30 or more than among those with BMIs less\nTable 1.

A similar pattern was\nseen for prevalence of mood or anxiety disorders in the last\ntrast, lifetime and past-year prevalence estimates for sub-\nstance use disorders are significantly lower in those with\nBMIs of 30 or more. Some relationships (eg, major depres-\nsion or any mood disorder) are statistically significant for\nlifetime diagnosis and not so for past-year diagnosis. This\ndiscrepancy, however, reflects wider CIs (due to lower\nprevalence rate and fewer cases) rather than clinically or\nstatistically significant differences in ORs.\nSubgroup analyses examined the relationship\nbetween obesity and mood disorders across different\nsociodemographic groups (Table 3). This association\ndid not vary significantly between men and women\n(P=.65 for interaction). Although the association\nbetween obesity and mood disorder appears stronger\namong younger respondents, a formal test for interac-\ntion finds no significant variation with age (P=.40 for\ninteraction with years of age as continuous measure).\nThe association between obesity and mood disorder is\nonly statistically significant among respondents with\nmore than 12 years of education, and a formal test for\ninteraction finds significant variation by years of edu-\ncational attainment (P=.007 for interaction with years\nof education as continuous measure). The association\nbetween obesity and mood disorder is statistically sig-\nnificant only among non-Hispanic whites. A formal\ntest for interaction finds a borderline significant differ-\nence in ORs between non-Hispanic whites and other\nracial/ethnic groups (P = .06 for interaction with\nnon-Hispanic whites vs other racial/ethnic groups).\nColumns 2 and 3 of Table 3 give the variation in mood\ndisorder prevalence and obesity prevalence by age,\neducational attainment, and race/ethnicity. The socio-\ndemographic groups that showed the strongest asso-\nciation between obesity and depression (age 29\nyears, college education or higher, non-Hispanic\nwhites) are also among the groups with the lowest\nprevalence of obesity.\nParallel subgroup analyses examined the association\nbetween obesity and anxiety disorders across demo-\ngraphic groups (Table 4). This association does not vary\nsignificantly according to sex (P=.52), age (P=.13), or\nrace/ethnicity (P=.21). The association is strongest in\nthose with the highest educational attainment, and a for-\nmal test for interaction is marginally significant (P=.06\nfor interaction with years of education as a continuous\nmeasure).\nTable 2.

This negative association does not vary\nsignificantly by sex (P=.46), age (P=.22), race/ethnicity\n(P=.43), or educational attainment (P=.36).\nThe final set of analyses considered potential con-\nfounders that might magnify or obscure associations be-\ntween obesity and psychiatric disorders. Adjustment for\nage and sex has no effect on the observed associations\n(third column of Table 6). Although smoking is posi-\ntively associated with psychiatric disorder and nega-\ntively associated with obesity, adjustment for smoking\nstatus has no meaningful effect on associations between\nobesity and mood disorder, anxiety disorder, or sub-\nstance use disorder (fourth column of Table 6). Finally,\nadjustment for comorbid psychiatric disorder (eg, effect\nof substance use disorder adjusted for mood and anxi-\nety disorders) also had no meaningful effect on ob-\nserved associations (fifth column of Table 6).\nCOMMENT\nWe observed significant positive associations between obe-\nsity and a range of mood and anxiety disorders in a na-\ntionally representative sample of the US household popu-\nlation. In contrast, substance use disorders were associated\nwith significantly lower risk of obesity. These associa-\ntions were not explained by confounding due to age, sex,\nsmoking, or comorbid psychiatric disorders. Mood and\nanxiety disorders each made independent contributions\nto obesity risk.\nThe positive associations between obesity and mood\nor anxiety disorders were generally modest, with ORs in\nthe range of 1.2 to 1.5. Even these modest associations\ncarry public health significance, though, given the high\noverall prevalence of obesity (approximately 25%) and\nmood or anxiety disorders (approximately 25%). The es-\ntimated prevalence of lifetime mood disorder in those with\nBMIs below 30 and in those with BMIs 30 or higher trans-\nlate to a population attributable risk of 24%, which in-\ndicates that nearly one quarter of the cases of obesity in\nthe general population are attributable to the associa-\ntion with mood disorder. This calculation illustrates the\npublic health importance of the association but does not\nindicate a direction for the causal relationship. It is equally\ncorrect to state that more than one fifth of cases of mood\ndisorder in the general population are attributable to the\nassociation with obesity (population attributable risk of\n21%). We have no way of distinguishing the direction\nof the causal relationship between obesity and psychiat-\nric disorders or the possibility that unmeasured com-\nmon causes induce an association between them.\nThe NCS-R offers several advantages over previous\ncommunity surveys used to examine associations be-\ntween psychiatric disorders and obesity. First, the sample\nwas designed to be an accurate representation of the non-\ninstitutionalized population of the 48 contiguous United\nStates. Results can be generalized to this population. Sec-\nond, the survey assessed a full range of psychiatric and\nsubstance use disorders, allowing us to examine asso-\nciations with anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and sub-\nstance use disorders. Third, mental disorders were as-\nsessed using a well-validated structured diagnostic\ninterview, which allowed the association of obesity with\nthese disorders to be assessed with accuracy. Fourth, the\nassessment considered lifetime diagnoses and current\nstate. Assessment of lifetime diagnosis is preferable be-\ncause an association between weight and psychiatric dis-\norder would be expected to reflect long-term behavioral\nand/or biological mechanisms.\nThe associations between obesity and psychiatric dis-\norders in this sample did not vary between men and\nTable 4.

This contrasts with findings in other US na-\ntional surveys17-20 that indicate that positive associa-\ntions between obesity and depression exist among women,\nwhereas negative or absent associations exist among men.\nWe are unable to identify any consistent differences in\nmethods between our study and previous studies that\nwould explain why earlier studies found no association\nbetween obesity and depression in men, whereas such\nan association was observed in the NCS-R sample. In one\nearlier study,20 the magnitude of the OR between obe-\nsity and depression in men was similar to that in women,\nbut the lower prevalence of depression in men led to a\nwider CI and a statistically insignificant result. A simi-\nlar phenomenon is seen in this sample for both mood and\nanxiety disorders. Because we observe no statistically sig-\nnificant interaction with sex, we conclude that this dis-\ncrepancy (significant association in women but not in\nmen) probably reflects differences in statistical power\nrather than differences in magnitude of the association.\nMost previous research has focused on the association\nbetween obesity and depression, and various mechanisms\nof those mechanisms propose a causal pathway that leads\nfrom depression to obesity. Increased appetite and weight\ngain are common symptoms of depression,43,44 and ten-\ndency to gain weight remains stable across depressive epi-\nsodes.43 Depression may lead to reduced physical activ-\nity,45 increasingtheriskofobesity.Depressionmayincrease\nrisk of weight gain through its effect on binge eating,46,47\nespecially among women.28,48 Medications used to man-\nagemoodoranxietydisordersmayalsoleadtoweightgain.49\nAlternatively, some proposed mechanisms suggest a causal\nrelationship that leads from obesity to depression. The\nstigmaattachedtoobesity(especiallyforwomen)maycon-\ntribute to depression.50,51 Activity limitations due to obe-\nsity or obesity-related chronic illnesses may increase risk\nofdepressionbyreducinginvolvementinrewardingorplea-\nsurable activities.30 Finally, depression and obesity may be\nlinked through some common cause or third factor, either\nenvironmental (eg, childhood abuse52) or biological.\nWe observed an interesting variation in the relation-\nship between obesity and mood disorder across socio-\nTable 5.

The association appeared stron-\nger in younger than older respondents, in non-Hispanic\nwhites than other racial/ethnic groups, and in respon-\ndents with higher educational attainment. Only the in-\nteraction with educational attainment, however, was sig-\nnificant at the .05 level. Approximately 40 years ago, The\nMidtown Manhattan Study21 also observed that, among\nwomen, the association between obesity and depression\nwas confined to those with higher socioeconomic sta-\ntus. In the NCS-R sample, the groups that showed the\nstrongest association between obesity and mood disor-\nder were also the groups with the lowest overall rates of\nobesity. A similar phenomenon has been observed re-\ngarding the association between depression and to-\nbacco use; as rates of tobacco use decline, the associa-\ntion between tobacco use and depression grows stronger.53\nOurfindingsareconsistentwitheitherdirectionofcausal\nrelationship between obesity and mood or anxiety disor-\nders.

Some previous research suggests\nthat self-perception of overweight54,55 and the perceived\nstigma associated with obesity56-59 may both be greater in\nwhite populations and those with higher income or edu-\ncational attainment. Alternatively, if mood or anxiety dis-\norders contribute to obesity through an effect on health be-\nhaviors(reducedphysicalactivity,increasedcaloricintake),\nthen this effect could be more easily expressed in sociode-\nmographic groups with lower obesity rates. This cross-\nsectional study does not allow us to distinguish between\ncausalmechanismsorexaminehowtheymightdifferacross\nsociodemographic groups.\nOur findings also do not indicate a specific mechanism\nor causal direction for the observed negative association\nbetween obesity and substance use disorders. Although al-\ncohol or other substances may have a direct effect on ap-\npetite or caloric intake, a negative association was also ob-\nservedinthosewithhistoriesofsubstanceabuse(ie,lifetime\nsubstance use disorder not active in the last 12 months).\nWe conclude that obesity is meaningfully associated\nwith a range of common mood and anxiety disorders in\nthe general US population. Obesity is associated with a\nmoderately lower risk of substance use disorder. Varia-\ntion in the obesity-depression relationship by educa-\ntional level and race/ethnicity suggests an important role\nof social or cultural factors in mediating or moderating\nthe relationship between obesity and mood disorders.\nClarifying the social and cultural influences on the rela-\ntionship between obesity and mood or anxiety disor-\nders will require additional research in populations with\na broader range of race/ethnicity, educational attain-\nment, and income. Clarifying the direction of causal re-\nlationships will require alternative research designs, in-\ncluding longitudinal and experimental studies.\nCorrespondence: Gregory E.
