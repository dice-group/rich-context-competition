AKI is a\nmajor clinical issue in critically ill patients,\nwith persistently high rates of hospital re-\nadmission and mortality carrying a substan-\ntial economic burden.1 Delay in diagnosis\nand treatment of AKI will result in either\ndeterioration of renal function, or perman-\nent renal impairment leading to dialysis.2\nMany critically ill patients with normal\nkidney function may progress to AKI\nduring the course of treatment in the emer-\ngency department (ED). Especially those\nwith sepsis, acute decompensated heart fail-\nure (ADHF) and diabetic ketoacidosis\n(DKA), which may influence the perfusion\nof the kidney significantly. Therefore, early\ndetection of AKI has become very import-\nant in diagnosis and prognosis in critically ill\npatients.3\nIt has been proven that neutrophil gela-\ntinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a\nstrong biomarker for early detection of\nAKI in various clinical settings.4\u00ad6 NGAL\nincreases as early as 2 hours after injury to\nthe kidney. It appears to be a novel `real-\ntime' biomarker of AKI, which can predict\nAKI several days earlier than serum creatin-\nine (sCr). Real-time point-of-care testing\n(RT-POCT) is defined as medical testing\nperformed at the site of patient care, and has\nbeen used widely in intensive care units\nand EDs. Since the ED is the first site of\ncontact for most critically ill patients, the\nuse of RT-POCT can not only accelerate\ntriage, but also facilitate evidence-based\npractices in the ED.7\nClinical studies have confirmed the diag-\nnostic and prognostic value of NGAL in\nvarious settings,6,8 but few of them used\nthe RT-POCT NGAL in critically ill\npatients in the ED for evaluating its efficacy.\nIn this study, we reported our experience of\nRT-POCT NGAL for detecting AKI in\ncritically ill patients of an urban university\ntertiary hospital ED.\nMethods\nPopulation\ncritically ill patients in the ED who were\ndiagnosed with ADHF, sepsis or DKA\nwithin 12 hours of admission to the ED,\nwere enrolled in this study. ADHF was\ndefined as the rapid onset or change of\nsymptoms and signs of heart failure.9 Sepsis\nwas defined according to the Surviving\nSepsis Campaign: international guidelines\nfor management of severe sepsis and septic\nglycemia (blood glucose >11 mmol/L or\n<15 mmol/L, and the presence of keto-\nnemia or ketonuria.11\nThe exclusion criteria were: age <18 years\nold; pregnancy; previously diagnosed\nabnormal renal function; autoimmune dis-\neases; terminal cancer; known urinary tract\ninfection; known exposure to nephrotoxic\nagents during treatment in the ED, which\nincluded aminoglycoside, angiotensin-con-\nverting enzyme inhibitors, contrast agent\net al; treatment time in hospital <3 days\n(not including died within 3 days); and\npatients (or their relatives) who declined\nto participate. The enrolled patients were\nfollowed up for 28 days or until death.\nA flow diagram of patient enrollment is\nshown in Figure 1.\nStudy design\nThe protocols were approved by the ethics\ncommittee of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital,\nCapital Medical University. The study was\nconducted in the ED of Beijing Chao-Yang\nHospital, Capital Medical University, which\nis an urban university tertiary hospital with\nyear. Subject data, name, age, sex, past\nmedical history, vital signs, and Acute\nPhysiology and Chronic Health Evaluation\n(APACHE) II score12 were recorded imme-\ndiately after enrollment. Within 60 min of\narrival in the ED, and as soon as possible, a\nblood sample was collected from patients for\nroutine laboratory examinations including\nsCr and RT-POCT NGAL. Treatment for\nall enrolled patients was based on the rou-\ntine standard of care and was entirely inde-\npendent of the study. All patients were\nfollowed up for 28 days and then the prog-\nnosis was recorded. If a patient was\ndischarged within 3 days, all data about\nthem were excluded from the research,\nbecause no definite prognosis was required.\nThe estimated glomerular filtration rate\n(eGFR) was calculated by the Cockcroft-\nGault equation and adjusted for body sur-\nany of the following (not graded): A increase\n48 hours; B increase in sCr to \u00c21.5 times\nbaseline, which is known or presumed to\nhave occurred within the prior 7 days; C urine\nvolume <0.5ml/kg/h for 6 hours. The classi-\nfication of AKI was according to the Kidney\nDisease: Improving Global Outcomes\n(KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines.14\nLaboratory tests\nistry system (Siemens, Germany) using an\nenzymatic method in the hospital lab\nstraight after blood samples were drawn.\nFigure 1. Diagram of enrollment 313 patients were registered when they were admitted to the ED, and\n64 were excluded according to the exclusion criteria. Thus, 249 patients were enrolled in this investigation.\nADHF, acute decompensated heart failure; DKA, diabetic ketoacidosis.\nRT-POCT NGAL results were obtained\nusing the AlereTM Triage\u00d5 Meterpro Device\n(Alere San Diego, Inc., San Diego, CA,\nUSA) with an immunofluorescence kit\nNGAL-specific monoclonal antibody con-\njugated to a fluorescent nanoparticle and\nintegrated control features including posi-\ntive and negative control immunoassays,\nwhich ensure that the test performs cor-\nrectly. 200 l whole blood was dropped on\nthe sample port where cells were separated\nfrom plasma through an integrated filter.\nThe antibody-conjugated fluorescent detec-\ntion nanoparticles flow down to the diag-\nnostic lane via capillary action. Both\nmonomeric and dimeric forms of NGAL in\nthe samples will prevent binding of the\nfluorescent detection particles to the solid\nphase. The serum NGAL concentration is\ninversely proportional to the fluorescence\ndetected. A control zone is located in the\nsame kit. Calibration information is relayed\nto the device via a code chip module. To\ndecrease bias, the tests were performed by\ntwo designated experimenters.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed using SPSS 19.0\nsoftware (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nCategorical data were presented as frequen-\ncies and percentages. All continuous vari-\nables were skewed distributions and are\npresented as the inter-quartile range\n(IQR) (25th percentile to 75th percentile).\nChi-square, Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-\nWallis H tests were conducted to detect the\ndifferences among the different groups.\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC)\ncurves and the area under the curve (AUC)\nwere calculated to detect the differences\namong the indexes for predicting AKI and\nthe 28-day mortality. Based on the optimal\nthresholds, which were detected by the\nROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive\npredictive value (PPV) and negative\npredictive value (NPV), were then calcu-\nlated. A Z-test was used for comparing\nAUCs between the different curves. Binary\nlogistic regressions were applied for deter-\nmining the risk factors of 28-day mortality\nand AKI. Multinomial logistic regression\nwas used to determine the predictive effects\nof NGAL on KDIGO. Curve estimate was\nperformed for establishing the regression\nequation between the eGFR and NGAL. All\nstatistical tests were two-tailed, and P < 0.05\nwas considered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe general characteristics of patients in\nthe different diagnosis groups\nA total of 313 patients were registered when\nthey were admitted to the ED, and 64 were\nexcluded according to the exclusion criteria.\nTherefore, a total of 249 patients were\nenrolled in this investigation. General char-\nacteristics of patients in the different diag-\nnosis groups are summarized in Table 1. No\nsignificant difference in sex was found\nbetween the different groups (ADHF,\nsepsis, DKA) at admission, whereas a sig-\nnificant difference in age between the ADHF\nBoth 1-day sCr and 1-day eGFR were\nnormal, and while significant differences\nwere found between them among the differ-\nent groups, these differences disappeared\nafter the 3rd day of admission. The median\nvalue of NGAL and APACHE II score at\nenrolled patients deteriorated to AKI during\nthe observation period. The 7-day and\nrespectively. Significant differences in\nNGAL were found among the three groups\n(P < 0.01), due to the higher level of NGAL\nin the sepsis and DKA groups.\nTable 1.

There were no signifi-\ncant differences in age in the different\nKDIGO classifications, while significant dif-\nferences in sex, the NGAL level, APACHE\nII score and mortality among the different\nKDIGO classifications were found. The\npercentage of males and the NGAL level\nwere significantly higher in the patients\nwith AKI than without AKI (P < 0.05).\nMoreover, the more severe the KDIGO\nclassification, the higher the NGAL level\nwas. This was not surprising that very\nsignificant differences in sCr and eGFR\nwere found among the different KIDGO\nclassifications, because they are determined\nby sCr level. The 7-day and 28-day mortality\nincreased with the severity of KDIGO clas-\nsification, to a maximum of 42.9% and\nNGAL levels in the different groups of\npatients\nWhen the patients were admitted to the ED,\nthe NGAL levels were higher in the AKI\ngroup than in the non-AKI group\nwas also significantly higher in the sepsis\ngroup when compared with the ADHF\ngroup, the NGAL levels of non -AKI and\nand a significant difference was found\nsignificantly higher than it was in the sur-\nvivors group.\nRisk factors for mortality and AKI\nAge, sex, NGAL level, 1-day eGFR and\nAPACHE II were analyzed by binary logis-\ntic regression, and only sex and NGAL were\nconfirmed as risk factors for AKI (Table 3).\nMultinomial logistic regression analysis was\nperformed for KDIGO classification with\nthe same variables as binary logistic regres-\nsion. The result indicated that high NGAL\nlevels were correlated with high KDIGO\nclassification (Table 4). The increase in\nserum NGAL was also detected as an inde-\npendent risk factor for high mortality at\n7-day and 28-day by binary logistic regres-\nsion (Table 5).\nRegression analysis of NGAL levels\nand eGFR\nAn inverse equation was established\nbetween NGAL and 3-day eGFR by curve\nThe diagnostic power of NGAL, eGFR and\nAPACHE II score for AKI and mortality\nThe ROC curve of NGAL was calculated\nfor diagnosing AKI, the AUC of which was\nSimilar results were found in predicting\n7-day and 28-day mortality by NGAL, the\nively.

The cutoff values of NGAL for\npredicting AKI, and 7-day, and 28-day\nmortality in critical ill patients were\nrespectively.\nDiscussion\nIt is well known that hypoperfusion, espe-\ncially of the non-crucial organs (including\nkidneys), is one of the key factors for AKI\nprogressing, which is common in critically ill\npatients. It was reported by the latest\nworldwide using the KDIGO definition.15\nAKI is increasingly observed in critical care\nsettings; meanwhile, critically ill patients with\nnormal renal function can progress quickly to\nsevere AKI. It is crucial to identify those\nhigh-risk patients from others for targeted\ninterventions. So far, the golden criteria of\ndiagnosis and classification of AKI is Cr and\nurine output. However, the defects and the\nunreliability of Cr and urine output for\nmonitoring renal function in the critically ill\nand in the acute setting are well known.16 Cr\nalso lacks the sensitivity to detect minor\nchanges in renal function.\nFigure 3. Curve estimate of NGAL and eGFR An inverse equation of 3-day\nanalysis.\neGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate; NGAL: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin.\nIn our study, eGFR was derived from sCr\nby the Cockcroft-Gault equation. There are\nmore accurate methods for estimating\neGFR, such as the Modification of Diet in\nRenal Disease (MDRD) equation, but that\nwas built from the chronic kidney disease\n(CKD) population.17 It is well known that\nthe relationship between eGFR and Cr is\nnot the same in CKD and healthy subjects.18\nIndeed, the MDRD formula may underesti-\nmate the true eGFR in healthy subjects,\nespecially when its value is !60 ml/min/\nespecially in the DKA group, had normal\nkidney function when they were enrolled, we\nused the Cockcroft-Gault equation, which\ncorrelated with the MDRD equation and is\nmore accurate in normal kidneys.\nTable 6.

POCT NGAL measurement aided\nthe assessment of renal function during acute\nburn resuscitation in an ICU, but in this\ninvestigation, only 15 patients were\ninvolved.23 A similar result was found in\nour previous experiments in a porcine model\nof cardiac arrest for predicting renal func-\ntion24; there was a positive correlation\nbetween the grade of renal injury and serum\nNGAL level.25 Thus, detection of early renal\ninjury is possible by NGAL levels even when\nsCr levels are normal.\nADHF, sepsis and DKA are the most\ncommon critical diseases in the ED, which\ncan decrease renal perfusion significantly.\nTherefore, it was not a surprise that AKI\nwas found in these patients after a period of\nnormal renal function. That was why we\nused them to investigate AKI in non-\npreexisting renal disease patients. Our pre-\nvious investigation already confirmed that\nNGAL was higher in the septic patients with\nAKI than those without AKI.5 In this\ninvestigation, we shifted the testing time of\nNGAL as early as we could, and used the\nfastest RT-POCT technology. We tried to\nconfirm the predictive value of NGAL in\ncritically ill patients with normal sCr. In our\nstudy, elevated NGAL levels with the deteri-\noration of renal function during hospital\nstay were observed. The incidence of AKI\nwas 40.6% in all enrolled patients, and was\nand DKA patients respectively. This sug-\ngests that the presence of underlying acute\ntubular injury, detected by elevated NGAL\nlevel, may be directly associated with devel-\nopment of AKI. Logistic regression also\nconfirmed that the increase of NGAL level\nwas an independent risk factor for the\nKDIGO classification, and 7-day and\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is always accom-\npanied by the potential decline of kidney\nfunction with time, although the Cr could be\nnormal. The relatively low reserved renal\nfunction may be an issue when patients\nwith DM undergo physiological stress.\nMoreover, when patients with DM devel-\noped DKA, there was always more severe\ntissue hypoperfusion than in HF and sepsis\nbecause of the dehydration. Therefore, it is\nnot surprising that the percentage of\nKDIGO 3 patients was the highest in the\nDKA group compared with the other two\ngroups. Furthermore, we have evaluated the\npower of NGAL in prognosis. The results\nshow that the NGAL combined with the\nAPACHE II score was not any more bene-\nficial than NGAL alone for predicting 28-\nday mortality. However, this was different\nwhen combining them for predicting 7-day\nmortality, which was better than using\nNGAL only. That may be because the\nAPACHE II score emphasized the acute\nphysiological condition of a patient with\nrelative normal renal function, so it could\nnot evaluate the future prognosis. However,\nNGAL can do what the APACHE II score\ncannot do, which may demonstrate that it is\na sensitive marker for evaluating the severity\nof early AKI and further prognosis. In our\ninvestigation, when sCr or eGFR were\nstill normal, NGAL was already abnormal.\nNotably, eGFR would not decrease until\n3 days later. Furthermore, an inverse regres-\nsion was found between the NGAL and\n3-day eGFR, which also supported that\nthere might be a relationship between\nNGAL and renal function, although this\nrelationship may not be a simple linear one.\nHistorically, emergency physicians have\nbeen caught between the proverbial rock\nand a hard place when evaluating critically\nill patients. Our choices were limited to using\nrapid but analytically imprecise assays or\nmore accurate but significantly slower\nlaboratory platforms. Although it is cur-\nrently agreed that the time delay of the\nslower tests is ``just an hour or so differ-\nence'',7 the risk of patient morbidity and\nmortality increases with more time spent in\nthe ED.26 Similarly, the earlier the recogni-\ntion of AKI, the better the kidney function\nmay recover. It is important to recognize\nthat the timing of biomarker measurement\nhas a significant impact on the ability of\nNGAL to predict the development of AKI,\nsince NGAL was also time dependent.\nCurrently, NGAL can be measured in\nwhole blood, serum, plasma, and urine by\nseveral commercially available analytical\nimmunoassays. However, most of the meas-\nurements take a relatively long time (at least\n2 hours), which may increase the emergency\nphysicians' therapeutic turnaround time and\nultimately extend the time of stay in the\nED. In this study, we used the RT-POCT\nNGAL, which was conducted beside the\npatient in less than half an hour. So far,\nthere are few studies investigating the\nRT-POCT NGAL in clinical use, especially\nin the ED. Currently, critically ill patients\narrive at the ED, a quick evaluation is done\nand NGAL is tested as soon as the blood\nsample is taken. On average, the time it takes\nfor the NGAL test results to return from\nthe time of the patients' arrival was thirty\nminutes. This was much faster than the central\nlaboratory. Thus, ownership of the RT-POCT\nNGAL can facilitate ED physicians' ability to\nconfirm a diagnosis of AKI and reduce their\ntherapeutic turnaround time.\nLimitations\nThis was a single-center study and the\nnumber of enrolled patients was only 249.\nIn this study, we did not compare other\nseverity score systems and biomarkers.\nThe NGAL level was measured only once\nand its dynamic changes over time were not\nobserved. In contrast, infection can influence\nthe NGAL level in serum,27 which may bias\nour results. However, a significant difference\nof serum NGAL could be found between\npatients with or without AKI in the sepsis\ngroup, so it may not influence the conclusions\nof our investigation.\nConclusions\nNGAL is an independent predictor of AKI,\nand 7-day and 28-day mortality in critically\nill patients in the ED. POCT NGAL can\nalert to AKI early and provide a prognosis\nin critically ill patients.\n"
