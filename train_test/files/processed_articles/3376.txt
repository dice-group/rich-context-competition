There were debates on how to analyze the\nR&D expenditures or what is its impact on policy makers in\nCongress (DiMasi, Hansen, & Grabowski, 2008; Light,\nThis article takes a new approach to these issues. This\narticle proposes a best managerial model as a solution to\nR&D managers who need to generate innovative treatments\nand get FDA approvals. Now more than ever, R&D\nmanagers need a new managerial model for overcoming\nchallenges that often result in managerial defeats and lay-\noffs. Focusing on improving success and efficient innovation\nis the best way to overcome these industry issues.\nThis article formulates \"Efficient Innovation Model\n(EIM)\" which redefines the concept of success in\npharmaceutical industry. According to the model, firms' R&D\nstrategies and R&D managerial capabilities comprise the key\nconstructs that bring about efficient innovation. Outsourcing,\ncollaboration, and offshoring R&D strategies are understood\nas significant ways toward efficient innovation. R&D\nmanagerial capabilities are defined by managerial openness\nand strategic cognition; managerial openness consists of the\nopenness to new technology, openness to networking, and\nopenness to information sharing.\nIn addition to suggesting the EIM, this article builds\nedifice of optimal managerial capabilities by identifying the\nconstructs of optimal managerial capabilities and examining\nthem in relationship with R&D strategies in the context of\nindustrial logic. It appears that managerial capabilities play\na significant role in constituting EIM in identifying\nindustrial logic, conducting R&D strategies, and achieving\ninnovation in a most efficient way. For instance, EIM in\npharmaceuticals is seamlessly sealed by this article's\nconstructs of managerial capabilities.\nEIM diverges from conventional Ansoff's Success\nHypothesis. Ansoff broadly hypothesized the relationships\namong triplet--industrial turbulence level, strategies, and\nAnsoff & McDonnell, 1990). Industrial turbulence levels\nwere quantified by the degree and speed of change and\ndiscontinuity. However, this view lacks in a definition and\nconstructs of managerial capabilities as well as strategies in\nthe context of success. The EIM connects managerial\ncapabilities with their strategies to create success.\nThis article contributes to managerial capabilities\nliterature by highlighting that managers are ultimately\nresponsible for identifying industrial success models and\nsuccess factors, conducting strategies, and gaining\ninnovation. It builds managerial capabilities constructs\nthrough contextualizing industrial logic and strategies; it\nfurther specifies constructs and solidifies their interplay.\nThis approach is more specific at reflecting management\nthan dynamic capabilities (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997).\nDynamic capabilities are illustrated as the managerial\ncapabilities that are able to utilize internal and external\nresources in changing ways: networking, technology,\ncollaboration, learning vehicle, and so on.\n1Alliant International University, San Diego, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nHyunju Rachel Kim, School of Management, Alliant International\nEmail: dr.kim.rachel@gmail.com\nsgo.sagepub.com\n2 SAGE Open\nThis article emphasizes on the interplay between a firm's\nexercised strategic behavior (outsourcing, collaboration,\nand offshoring) and managerial strategic cognition and\nsuggests there is significance between the two (Kim, 2012).\nFurthermore, it develops managerial capabilities into\nstrategic cognition and managerial openness to networking,\ntechnology, and information sharing toward innovation.\nThis is a more industrial-specific and practice-grasping\napproach to strategic cognitive algorithms than abstract\nones: strategic link (Morrow, 2001), strategic relevance\nand dominant logic (Prahalad & Bettis, 1986). Strategic\ncognition is important as it provides intra-relationships\nbetween managerial capabilities and inter-relationships with\nstrategies implementation and achieving innovation (Kim,\nConducting R&D collaboration strategies (domestic\nand/or offshore) is understood as efficient innovation\nstrategy that requires management's high level of strategic\ncognition and openness. The collaboration strategy is\ninvolved with multi-step operations that managers make\nnew patterns of decisions through. This perspective\ncontrasts with organizational rigidity where management\nrepeats historical patterns of R&D procurement reflecting\ningrained repertoires (Simon, 1947), search rules (Cyert &\nThis article begins by providing a general background of\nthe pharmaceutical industry including industrial logic, the\nimportance of R&D, as well as current industry challenges.\nNext, it discusses the current success models and an\nindustrial success factor involved in them, followed by an\nillustration of the most preferred strategies for achieving\nefficient innovation. Finally, the article demonstrates the\nsignificance of R&D management capabilities regarding\nindustrial logic, strategies, and the EIM.\nMissing Link: R&D Management\nCapabilities\nTo understand pharmaceutical industry's logic, it is critical\nto understand the significance of R&D and its managerial\ncapabilities. It is not easy, however, to have a holistic view\nof R&D by using annual financial performance reports as a\nyardstick. R&D has not brought short-term outcomes\nrelated to investments. In addition, even when analyzing\nR&D's long-term outcomes, it is hard to articulate R&D\nfunction by relating econometric data such as market value.\nFor example, past studies in R&D spending announcements\nand positive share-price reactions (Chan, Martin, &\nR&D expenditure does not ensure consistent long-term\ncontribution to shareholder value (Chauvin & Hirschey,\nTherefore, rather than relying on econometric analyses,\nit is critical to focus on the industrial success\u00ad\u00adinnovative\ntreatments or products. Besides, it should be achieved in a\nfast and confidential manner to earn patents, all necessary\ncomponents of staying ahead of competitors in this\nindustry. Hence, managerial capabilities play an essential\nrole at identifying industrial characteristic opportunities that\ninclude the early detection of potential from raw data, such\nas a new technology or a new regulation, and making sense\nout of that raw data. Understanding industrial logic is\ncrucial to formulating success models and conducting R&D\nstrategies is imperative for innovation. In this way,\nmanagement capabilities function at the core of R&D and\nits innovation activities.\nPharmaceutical Industry Overview\nTo understand R&D significance, it is necessary to have a\ngeneral understanding of the R&D processes in the\npharmaceutical industry. The following section aims to\naddress reports on R&D management's role as a\ndetermining factor of a company's success. This\nbackground research serves as the foundation for attaining\nan industrial logic.\nImportance of R&D in Pharmaceuticals\nR&D is at the core of the pharmaceutical industry in terms\nof generating patents and exclusive rights over time. This\nlegal rewarding system is linked to monetary rewards, such\nas retention of profits and preventing competitors from\ncatching up or copying information knowledge. Under this\nstructure, the well-known blockbuster model drugs\nappeared in the 1980s targeting mass markets with a focus\non prevalent cardiovascular or metabolic diseases such as\nhypertension, peptic ulcers, and lipid metabolism disorders.\nGood examples of these drugs are enalapril, ramipril,\ncimetidine, ranitidine, and atorvastatin (Lipitor). Lipitor\nwas only the sixth HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor entering\nthe market for the treatment of lipid metabolism disorders\nand provided over $10 billion in annual sales (Nickisch,\nCurrent Challenges of Pharmaceutical Industry\nRegulation, patents, and globalized competitors.\nPharmaceutical industry has faced stricter regulations for\nthe last 10 years. Compared with other major markets that\nregulate drug prices directly or indirectly, drug prices in the\nU.S. pharmaceutical market were largely unregulated. Since\n2002, increasing numbers of pharmaceutical patents have\nbeen expiring; consequently, domestic companies\nproducing generic drugs are posing greater threats to \"big\npharma.\" Pharmaceutical price controls in the United States\nalso began with the passage of the Medicare Modernization\nAct (MMA) in 2003. Furthermore, R&D in pharmaceutical\ncompanies has been fast growing in India, Brazil, and\nAsia--especially China (Howells, 2008). They may take\nadvantage of this situation by sharing information about\nproducts with expired patents and improving manufacturing\ncapabilities. However, globalization notwithstanding, the\nUnited States still specializes in searching for new\ntreatments and new drugs.\nDeclining productivity. The pharmaceutical industry has been\nexperiencing low productivity mostly stemming from\nextensive requirements in clinical trials (requirements\nunderstood as an exchange for possible exclusivities and\nreturns on R&D investments). According to pharmaceutical\nindustry representatives, the current pricing structure is\nnecessary both to cover the high fixed costs of R&D\noperations and to maintain R&D investment for the future\n(Abbott & Vernon, 2007). However, within a decade,\nproductivity got worse in terms of the success ratio of\nclinical trials and commercialization. In 1995, only 1 in\n5,000 compounds made it all the way through the maze of\nclinical trials and approvals to the market (Studt & Cassidy,\nmodels have changed and only 10% of drugs entering\ndevelopment reach the market, with only 20% of marketed\ndrugs recovering their investment. The entire drug\ndevelopment process is very lengthy--8 to 12 years--and\nFurthermore, additional drugs with total annual sales of\nFormulation of EIM\nCurrent Success Models\nResearch into existing products and their markets helps\nconceptualize what constitutes success in the\npharmaceutical industry. To conceptualize what constitutes\nsuccess in this industry, existing products and their markets\nwere investigated. Broadly, there are three types of products\nin the current market. The first type is a producer-driven for\nbranded products, the second is a buyer-driven model for\nquality generics for high-end markets, and the third is\ngenerics for low-end markets (Haakonsson, 2009). Branded\nproducts are known as blockbuster models, which are the\nmost preferred success model by pharmaceutical companies\nas they provide a monopoly period by granting a patent and\nmarket exclusivity. On the other hand, \"specialty pharma\"\napproaches have also been successful since they\ndifferentiate markets and products from Big Pharma's main\ninterest in the mass market (Nickisch et al., 2009). These\nspecialty pharma approaches were based on the\ndiversification of products and marketing in the\npharmaceutical industry and each company's unique\ncapabilities.\nAccording to Kambhammettu (2007), \"specialty\npharma\" approach can be categorized as follows:\n\u00b7 Niche therapeutic area/orphan disease concentrators\nfocus on specific therapeutic segments such as\nophthalmology, specific tumor types, and other rare\nbut serious diseases. Examples are Genzyme, Alcan,\nand Actelion.\n\u00b7 Portfolio adapters pursue the products de-prioritized\nby big pharma and increase sales volume by means of\nadditional development investments and intensive\nmarketing. Shire and King Pharmaceuticals are in this\ntype.\n\u00b7 Licensing experts license early and late stage\ndevelopment candidates and complete development\ntoward approval. Helsinn Pharma is an example of\nthis type.\n\u00b7 Drug delivery experts reformulate existing molecules\nto enhance their therapeutic application. Nektar and\nElan apply this approach.\n\u00b7 Specialty generic companies develop their own\nbranded generics by reformulating existing products.\nBarr and Watson use this approach.\nFrom a R&D managerial perspective, the most preferred\nsuccess models are either blockbuster models or orphan\ndisease concentrate models. Blockbuster models target mass\nmarkets by focusing on prevalent cardiovascular or\nmetabolic diseases with a bigger population of patients,\nsuch as diabetes or high cholesterol, while orphan disease\nconcentrators target smaller populations of patients.\nHowever, both success models must contain innovative\nknowledge of treatments to concretely achieve any form of\nnew valuable intellectual property, licensing, patents, and\nmarket exclusivity. As such, current FDA regulation legally\nrewards innovative treatments with the award of patent,\nmarket exclusivity, and FDA approval time reduction.\nAs predicted a decade ago, patents and market\nexclusivity of currently successful models are expiring; in\ndue to patent expiration. Furthermore, the failure of clinical\ntrials to replace Lipitor made Pfizer's CEO call for a\nreinvention. Merck discontinued one of two major clinical\ntrials of a blood thinner that caused dangerous amounts of\nbleeding in some patients. The industry faces more of these\ntypes of challenges and thus, R&D management needs\nurgent solutions.\nNew Model of Innovation Management\nThe best way of overcoming these industrial challenges is\nto build efficient R&D to produce innovative products and\nkeep more products in the pipeline. Pharmaceutical R&D\nmanagement needs a new model of innovation management\nfor enabling innovation and efficiency. However, these are\nconflicting ideas in management theory. Efficiency\n4 SAGE Open\nmanagement is characterized as a linear process that\nfocuses on reducing costs and time. On the other hand,\ninnovation management is typically referred to as a chaotic\nprocess in terms of nonlinear relationship between actions\nand outcomes over time (Cheng & Van de Ven, 1996),\nmaking it a complex adaptive system (Trochim, Cabrera,\nMilstein, Gallagher, & Leischow, 2006). In this respect,\npharmaceutical R&D management should go beyond what\nmost management theories define in terms of efficiency and\ninnovation--a call to think outside the box.\nEIM\nEfficient innovation is an industrial and managerial success\nmodel that pharmaceutical R&D pursues. The most\ndeterminant success factor of R&D management is to\ndiscover an innovative treatment or an innovative way of\ntreatment faster than a competitor discovers it. Without\nefficient innovation, the firm cannot claim any exclusive\nright over other competitors--a basic rule and necessity in\nthe pharmaceutical industry. In the pharmaceutical industry,\ncompetition is highly globalized and new technologies are\nquickly emerging.\nTo have efficient innovation, companies must pursue\nvarious collaborations and networks, rather than solely\nbuilding internal capabilities within companies themselves.\nHence, the first way to create efficient innovation is\nallowing R&D management to utilize collaboration,\noutsourcing, and mergers and acquisitions (M&A)\nstrategies to actively search for materials and skills that\nmight be crucial for gaining potentially new drug\ncandidates before competitors. Powell (1998) observed that\nin addition to managing inter-organizational networking,\nthe capability of managing R&D collaboration strategy is a\nkey driver of organizational and knowledge management.\nThe second way to pursue efficient innovation is with\nstrategic decision making that translates into cost reduction.\nAccording to DiMasi (2002), the earlier a decision is made,\nthe less out-of-pocket drug discovery and development\ncosts a company incurs in the future. Reducing phase times\nThough this study highlighted the importance of decision\nmaking by R&D managers, there was no direct study to\nconnect R&D managers with strategic cognition in relation\nto strategic behavior (collaboration or offshoring; firms'\nstrategic behavior) and innovation (success).\nThe pharmaceutical industry achieves success by new\ndrug development, which must contain an innovative\ncomponent--new or better treatments in the market. Under\nthis industrial logic, a firm legally achieves market\nexclusivity when FDA approves a new treatment; however,\nconceptually, a firm's R&D achieves this through new\nknowledge creation. Hence, conceptually, drug\ndevelopment is a process of generating innovative\nknowledge where R&D management pursues the creation\nof new drugs through the refinement of existing materials\ninto therapeutically more effective drugs. Essentially,\npharmaceutical R&D needs to address both refining the\nconcepts and efficiently identifying innovative knowledge\nfor new drug creation (Elmquist & Segrestin, 2007). Drug\ndiscovery and development processes necessitate a high\nlevel of managerial openness as well as strategic cognition\nthat enable management to stay focused on collective and\ncumulative knowledge processes. Hence, the EIM is\ndetermined by firms' strategic behavior and high level of\nmanagerial capabilities, strategic cognition, and managerial\nopenness.\nThe Most Preferred Pharmaceutical R&D\nStrategies\nFollowing an understanding of the EIM, it is important to\ndiscuss current R&D strategies. The two most preferred\nR&D collaboration strategies are outsourcing and\noffshoring. Outsourcing strategy has been historically\nimportant in United States and offshoring R&D strategy has\nbeen globalized, which remains understudied regarding\nefficient innovation and relationship with managerial\ncapabilities.\nR&D Outsourcing Strategy\nSince the late 1970s, the pharmaceutical industry has had\nchallenges and changes relating to the entry of\nbiotechnology and biopharmaceutical firms (Powell, Koput,\nWalsh, 1995). From a knowledge perspective, these\nchanges have been associated with new knowledge areas\nsuch as cell and molecular biology, pharmacology,\nphysiology in the pharmaceutical industry (McKelvey,\ntraditional pharmaceutical industry, mostly driven by\nchemistry, got involved in new and flexible companies\ncalled new biotechnology-based firms (NBFs). This\nindustrial discontinuity caused large pharmaceutical firms\nto seek partnerships with these NBFs to adapt to new\nindustrial change and increase opportunities. In this way,\nlarge generalist pharmaceutical firms have found\noutsourcing useful. Through these interactive partnerships\nand contracts, the NBFs have also found advantages in\nmanaging the high costs of development and marketing,\nsince specialist contract research organizations (CROs)\ncentered especially on clinical trial and testing work\n(Howells, Gagliardi, & Malik, 2008). For this reason,\noutsourcing has brought mutual benefits to both parties.\nSpecifically, it stimulated many knowledge spillover effects\nnear pharmaceutical R&D outsourcing sites.\nOutsourcing strategies were what pharmaceutical\ncompanies had developed to deal with these new entrants,\nwhich were equipped with new knowledge and\norganizational flexibility. Hence, the previously dominant\npharmaceutical companies have been more flexible and\nfaster via external collaboration with NBFs (Pisano, 1994;\nPisano, Shan, & Teece, 1988). There have been three\ntendencies regarding outsourcing strategies. The first is that\ncompanies are outsourcing what they do not consider their\ncore business areas (Howells et al., 2008). A second recent\ntendency among the producers of branded pharmaceuticals\nis that they focus on similar areas of competence. Finally,\nthere is a shift in R&D strategy to externalize their research\nactivities by buying upcoming biotech companies, which\nmay have a new product in their laboratory but not the\nfinancial power or distribution systems to market it\nOverall, outsourcing strategies have boosted innovation\nthrough interaction with NBFs (Orsenigo, Pammolli, &\nRiccaboni, 2001). In addition, there is a reduction on\ndevelopment time and cost benefits when using outsourcing\nOffshoring R&D Strategy\nThe Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectural\nProperty Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization\n(WTO) officially globalized the pharmaceutical industry\n(Haakonsson, 2009), and offshoring R&D became a\nmainstream practice. According to a study by Chacar and\nLieberman (2003), U.S. pharmaceutical companies'\ninternational acquisitions and establishment of foreign\nresearch laboratories are reaping benefits in drug discovery\nby globalizing their R&D networks. Globalized R&D\nshowed innovative output: the annual number of \"new\nchemical entities\" (NCEs) approved by the U.S. FDA and\nthe annual number of U.S. patents granted increased\nsignificantly. Offshoring R&D attempts to overcome\nexcessive centralization or bureaucratic diseconomies of\nR&D (Williamson, 1991). This includes the rapid\nexpansion of economies in China, India, and Brazil,\ncoupled with the desire to get closer to consumers in\nrelation to R&D activity.\nDespite the many supply-led claims of R&D\nglobalization, the demand side strongly correlates with the\nexpansion of foreign R&D. Many multi-national companies\nare not only facing ever-shorter development cycles;\nhowever, they are simultaneously confronting wider\ngeographical spans of their R&D establishments.\nConstructs of R&D Management\nCapability\nAs previously described, R&D collaboration strategies,\noutsourcing, and offshoring R&D are the most preferred\nstrategies in pursuit of efficient innovation. These strategies\ninvolve coordinating and combining external and internal\nR&D resources, which are known as innovation capabilities\n(Coombs & Metcalfe, 2002). In this view, innovative\nmanagerial capability is essential in successfully conducting\nR&D collaboration strategies. R&D managerial capabilities\nare strategic cognition and managerial openness, where\nmanagerial openness consists of the openness to new\ntechnology, openness to networking, and openness to\ninformation sharing. These are the keys to implementing,\noptimizing, and making the most of outsourcing and\noffshoring R&D strategies.\nStrategic cognition is one of the innovative R&D\nmanagerial capabilities of visualizing the potential that a\nnew treatment can offer to patients and its potential impact\non the market. Without a high level of strategic cognition,\nmanagers may not be willing to take risks in leveraging\nStrategic cognition helps envision the potential of a new\ntreatment, aggressively exploiting internal resources as well\nas exploring external resources. In the process of drug\ndevelopment, a certain level of resource deficiency always\noccurs, which is overcome by R&D collaboration strategies\nthat explore external resources. Thus, innovation is\nachieved through the capability of implementation (Coombs\n& Metcalfe, 2002) and targeted by managers and by their\nstrategic decisions (Bessant & Francis, 2005). At this point,\nstrategic cognition becomes significant for pursuing\ninnovation in more efficient ways than competitors do.\nThe significance of strategic cognition becomes evident\nin the context of the managerial implementation of R&D\ncollaboration strategies. The managerial capability of\nconducting R&D collaboration strategy is a key to\nknowledge management (Powell, 1998). The high level of\nmanagerial strategic cognition and exercised strategies are\nlinked to innovation (Kim, 2012). In implementing R&D\ncollaboration strategies and exploring external knowledge\nthrough them, managers' capabilities extend beyond the\nconcept of operational management that prioritizes\nefficiency and short-term economic outcomes (Ackoff,\nManagerial openness to new technologies--another\nconstruct of managerial capabilities--is managerial\nperception and practice toward new technologies. It gains\nsignificance by understanding the impact of new\ntechnologies in pharmaceutical industry. New technologies\nevidently are an industrial characteristic factor that caused\nindustrial shift by allowing NBFs in pharmaceutical history.\nNew technology ushered NBFs' successful entry (Darby &\nZucker, 1997) and drove incumbent pharmaceuticals to\ncollaborate with them (Howells et al., 2008; Orsenigo,\nPammolli, Riccaboni, Bonaccorsi, & Turchetti, 1997). In a\nrecent study, managerial openness to new technologies is\nlinked to innovation (Kim, 2012), highlighting its\nimportance in efficient innovation.\nOpenness to networking and openness to information\nsharing are the two other important constructs of\nmanagerial capabilities that gain significance by\nunderstanding the drug discovery and development process.\nThe work of Elmquist and Segrestin (2007) showed that the\ndrug discovery process is more of a creative process\n6 SAGE Open\nwherein new concepts and knowledge are continually\ngenerated. While doing so, R&D management functions as\nknowledge interpreters and innovative knowledge\ngenerators. Drug discovery and development processes\nnecessitate a managerial openness that enables management\nto stay focused on collective and cumulative knowledge\nprocess, as well as strategic cognition.\nManagerial openness to networking is highly related to\ninnovation. In the process of innovation, R&D managers\nboth individually and organizationally expand the boundary\nof knowledge. Thus, the innovative knowledge is\nstrategically accumulated, expanded, and generated by\nR&D management via communication. During the process\nof developing and introducing innovation, R&D\ncommunication networks are significant at the inter- and\nintra-firm levels (Tushman, 1979). In a knowledge\nexpansion or organizational learning process, a common\ncode of communication and coordinated search procedure\nare important (Teece et al., 1997). As the prior studies\naddressed the importance of networks, accordingly,\nmanagerial openness to networking is critical in sharing and\nexpanding knowledge. It includes networking with R&D\nstaffs, with other department managers (over R&D), within\nfirms, and between firms (i.e., with R&D managers at other\nfirms). According to Powell et al.'s (1996) study on inter-\norganizational collaboration in biotechnology, firms\nembedded in benefit-rich networks are likely to have\ngreater innovative performance as well.\nManagerial openness to information sharing is highly\nrelated to innovation. Early studies showed that information\nsharing between and within organizations was one of the\ncritical factors for organizational creativity (Clitheroe,\nSawyer, & Griffin, 1993). Furthermore, recently, the R&D\nnetworks are considered a flow of information (Whelan,\nTeigland, Donnellan, & Golden, 2010). R&D professionals\nuse three external information sources: personal contacts,\nInternet sources, and academic publications (Whelan et al.,\n2010). Conclusively, it is critical for R&D managers to\nhave high level of openness to networking and information\nsharing to increase innovation.\nStrategic cognition and openness--cognitive\nflexibility--are the main attributes of strategic managers.\nBoth these attributes represent two aspects of strategic\nthinking--metacognition (the process of thinking about\nthinking) and leadership (Industrial College of the Armed\nForces, 2001). Strategic managers are like strategic leaders\nas they lead organizations toward the targeted positions in\nthe market, achieve the organization's goals, and help shape\nfuture norms and rules in the industry (Kang & Afuah,\n2010). From this perspective, strategic managers tend to be\nmore creative and are referred to as map makers rather than\nmap users (Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, & Lampel, 1998, pp.\n159-160). The strategic cognition is referred to as long-term\nplanning (Pascale, 1999), high level of conceptualization\n(Industrial College of the Armed Forces, 2001), and the\nintuition of bringing all together of knowledge and\nIn implementing R&D collaboration strategies and\npursuing innovation, both strategic cognition and\nmanagerial openness play significant roles. Strategic\ncognition and managerial openness are vital since R&D\nmanagers aggressively exploit external sources for\ninnovative opportunities. Day (1994) observed that\nmanagers' mental models provide a shared ideology that\nenables collective interpretation of market reality, and thus\nthese models play a key role in managerial decisions about\ncapability enhancement and renewal. When managers\ninterpret the market situation as an opportunity rather than a\nthreat, their cognitive flexibility is engaged and they tend to\nmore aggressively invest resources in new strategic\ninitiatives (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; White, Varadarajan, &\nR&D is essentially a constant, lengthy discovery process\ntoward creation (Elmquist & Segrestin, 2007). Managerial\nopenness becomes critical in the drug discovery and\ndevelopment process that consists of multi-steps with\ndiverse experts. During pharmaceutical R&D\nmanagement's pursuit of innovation, there are multi-interim\nsteps toward newness that require managerial openness.\nTherefore, when managers pursue innovation, innovative\ntreatments or products, they strategically position\nthemselves toward innovative knowledge and potential\nopportunities for innovative knowledge generation.\nManagerial openness can be measured by the\nperceptions and practice of R&D managers regarding\nnetworking and information sharing. This involves\ninteraction with others in a social context called\nparticipative openness (Senge, 1992). Information sharing\nis more delicate than networking in this industry, which\ntends to pursue confidentiality of appropriated knowledge.\nThis is close to Senge's reflective openness that contains a\ncerebral response to the ideas of others but does not involve\ndirect social interaction with others.\nBy contextualizing industrial logic and industrial success\nmodels, this study formulates EIM that optimizes efficient\ninnovation with R&D strategies and managerial capabilities.\nEIM situates R&D managerial capabilities at the core of it\nand demonstrates the significance of optimal R&D\nmanagement capabilities. The R&D managerial capabilities;\nopenness to information sharing, networking, and new\ntechnology; and strategic cognition, are essential to pursuing\ninnovation and strategizing decision making to exploit\ninternal/external resources (Kim, 2012). Pharmaceutical\ncompanies need to develop and grow these R&D\nmanagement capabilities in pursuit of innovation.\nConclusion\nThis article formulated an EIM to redefine industrial\nsuccess and achieve efficient innovation. The EIM\nstrengthens innovative managerial capabilities and actively\ndeploys R&D strategies by identifying industrial turbulence\nfactors and overcoming resource deficiencies. By using the\nEIM, R&D managers are better able to perform efficient\ninnovation, to achieve industrial success, and to address the\npharmaceutical industry's current challenges including\ndeclining productivity and globalized competition.\nFurthermore, the EIM empowers R&D management to\npursue innovative knowledge by strategically exploring\nexternal knowledge. This managerial view addresses\nindustrial issues, innovative knowledge creation/expansion,\nand strategies in a dynamic way that contains multi-\nvariables. This provides a better approach to innovation\nthan the conventional way of only looking at the two\ndimensions of inputs and outcomes.\nIn management theory, managerial capabilities, business\nmodels, and industrial logics are mutually interconnected;\nbusiness models are the interpretation of management\nhypothesis about customers, markets, and the best way of\nthe firm to meet their needs (Teece, 2010). In Teece's\ndefinition, a business model is organized around the\nhypothesis of what customers want or what management\nthinks they want; therefore, the unit of analysis in a\nbusiness model is its value proposal. Industrial logics and\nbusiness models are closely related as these anticipations\nare formed from within a manager's mind-set, which stem\nfrom their reading of the industry's dominant logic. In\nshort, managers create the business models by interpreting\nthe industry's dominant logic. Furthermore, there is an\nimplicit association between business models and strategy,\nas strategy refers to the choice of business models through\nwhich the firm will compete in a marketplace (Casadesus-\nThe main contribution of this article is shedding light on\nthe important relationship between managerial capabilities,\nstrategies, and innovation (an industrial success model).\nFirms achieve innovation through a focus on strategic\nbehavior and developing innovative managerial capabilities,\nspecifically strategic cognition and managerial openness\n(Kim, 2012). The underlying premise behind the EIM is\nthat managers are at the core of every decision-making and\nstrategic behavior. When managers possess high level of\nopenness to new information, new technologies, and\nnetworking, then, they tend to identify industrial turbulence\nfactors and industrial success models. On the other hand,\nwhen managers possess high levels of strategic cognition,\nthey facilitate long-term planning for strategic goals and are\nwilling to make strategic decisions about resource\nutilization or deficiency, such as collaboration strategies. In\naddition, this article contributes to current management\nliterature by building constructs of managerial capabilities\n(Kim, 2012). Dynamic capabilities did not specify\nconstructs, though illustrated as \"the ability to integrate,\nadapt, and configurate internal and external resources\"\nimportance of managerial practitioners to emphasize core\ncapabilities to achieve innovation.\nIn today's current market, pharmaceutical R&D needs\noptimal managerial capabilities to evaluate current moves in\nthe marketplace, formulate success models, and create\ncompetitive strategies to take preemptive actions in the fast-\nchanging global environment. In other words, companies\nwill achieve efficient innovation when they focus on\ndeveloping high levels of strategic cognition and\nmanagerial openness.
