    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This study examines the number of workers in firms offering em-\nployee health plans, the number of workers eligible for such plans, and partici-\npation in employer-sponsored insurance. Data from the February 1997 Contin-\ngent Worker Supplement to the Current Population Survey indicate that 10.1\nmillion workers are employed by firms offering insurance but are not eligible.\nNot all of these workers are eligible for coverage, most often because of hours\nof work. Our results indicate that 11.4 million workers rejected coverage when\nit was offered. Of those, 2.5 million workers were uninsured. Workers cited high\ncost of insurance most often as the primary factor for refusing coverage.\nSeveral recent studies have examined the number of\nworkers who are offered and accept employer-sponsored\nhealth insurance.1 These studies have documented a decline in\nemployer-sponsored coverage, spurred in part by a reduction in the\nproportion of workers who accept coverage when it is offered. The\ndecline in employer-sponsored insurance continues to fuel debate\nover approaches for stemming this erosion.\nTo be effective, policy interventions should address why workers\nare uninsured. Uninsured workers may be categorized in three\ngroups: (1) workers who are in a firm that offers health insurance\nbut who are not eligible for the health plan; (2) workers who are\neligible for health insurance but decline it; and (3) workers who are\nin firms that do not offer health insurance. Previous studies do not\npresent estimates of the number of workers who are ineligible for\ntheir employers' health plan, nor do they focus on why such workers\n\u00a91999ThePeople-to-People Health Foundation,Inc.\nKen Thorpe is the Vanselow Professor of Health Policy and director of the Institute for\nHealth Services Research at Tulane University Medical Center in New Orleans.

In this DataWatch we use\nnew data from the 1997 Contingent Worker Supplement (CWS) to\nthe February 1997 Current Population Survey (CPS) to examine\nthese key issues.\nData and methods.

We estimate that approximately 22 percent of workers\nwho declined coverage were uninsured.\nApproximately 37 percent of ineligible workers were uninsured,\nnearly 11 percent received some form of public health insurance (for\nexample, Medicaid or Medicare), and nearly 44 percent were in-\nsured through another family member. Finally, more than 40 per-\ncent of workers in firms that did not offer health benefits were\nuninsured, 29 percent received coverage through a family member,\nand approximately 23 percent were insured by another employment\nsource or had individually purchased coverage.\nVariation by employment. Access to employer-sponsored insur-\nance varies greatly by employment arrangement (Exhibit 2). More\nthan 86 percent of wage-and-salary workers (74 million) working\nthirty-five or more hours per week were in firms that offered health\nbenefits. Nearly 5 percent of these workers were not eligible for\nthese benefits, and 11 percent declined coverage. Other types of\nworkers have much less access to employer-sponsored plans. Only\n63 percent of wage-and-salary workers employed twenty to thirty-\nfour hours per week were in firms that offered health insurance.

Finally, only 54 percent of wage-and-salary\nworkers employed fewer than twenty hours per week were in firms\nthat offered health insurance. More than 73 percent of these workers\nwere not eligible for their employer's health plan. Among those\neligible, approximately 38 percent accepted coverage.\nIndependent contractors and the self-employed account for ap-\nproximately 12 percent of the labor force. By nature of their employ-\nment, they have limited direct access to employer-sponsored health\ninsurance. Similarly, workers in alternative work arrangements\n(who make up 3.3 percent of the labor force) have limited direct\naccess to employer-sponsored insurance. We estimate that 55 per-\ncent of alternative workers were in firms that sponsored a health\nplan in 1997, and of those eligible for coverage, 64 percent accepted.\nThirty-six percent of alternative workers in firms that offered cover-\nage were not eligible for those firms' health benefits.\nReasons for ineligibility.

Of\nthis group, nearly two-thirds were uninsured. Finally, 7.7 percent\nnoted that they were not eligible for benefits because they were\nemployed as contract or temporary workers. Nearly a third of these\nworkers were uninsured. Only 1.1 percent of workers cited a pre-\nexisting health condition as the factor preventing them from obtain-\ning coverage.4\nReasons for rejecting coverage. The survey also examined why\nworkers who were eligible for health insurance through their em-\nployer declined coverage. Of the 2.5 million uninsured workers eligi-\nble for employer-sponsored coverage, nearly 68 percent cited its\nhigh cost as their reason for rejecting it. Few uninsured workers\n(only 1 percent) noted that they rejected health insurance because\nthey preferred higher wages in lieu of coverage or that they did not\nneed insurance (4.1 percent). More than a quarter of respondents\nnoted other factors associated with their decision to decline cover-\nage. Unfortunately, these factors were simply coded as \"other\" in the\nsurvey. In sum, these responses indicate that these uninsured work-\ners generally desired coverage but considered it to be too expensive.\nPolicy Implications\nOur findings provide new evidence regarding the availability of\nemployer-sponsored health insurance; why some workers were not\neligible for their employer's plan; and why other workers rejected\ncoverage when it was offered. These categories are policy relevant for\ntwo reasons. First, workers in these categories have varying access to\nemployer-sponsored coverage. Second, the percentage of workers\nwithout insurance varies substantially within each category.\nOur results raise important issues for policymakers seeking to\nincrease access to employer-sponsored health insurance. In particu-\nlar, there were nearly as many workers in firms that sponsored\nhealth insurance who were ineligible for coverage as there were\nworkers who declined coverage. In addition, access to coverage\namong those in jobs outside the traditional wage-and-salary ar-\nrangements was relatively limited. These workers accounted for 15\npercent of the labor force in 1997. Access to employer-sponsored\nhealth insurance could be reduced if these work arrangements were\nto become more common over time.\nAbsent comprehensive health care reform, several incre-\nmental reforms could prove effective based on these findings.\nFor instance, one could modify the existing nondiscrimina-\ntion rules and increase the number of workers eligible for health\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a r c h / A p r i l 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Such a change could make 3.5 million additional workers\neligible for health insurance. In addition, reducing the cost of insur-\nance--including small-business purchasing pools--for workers\nemployed at nontraditional worksites or at home could reduce the\nestimated 4.5 million uninsured workers employed outside of the\ntraditional wage-and-salary work arrangement.\nThe authors thank Peter Joskifor hiscomputational and research assistance.\nNOTES\n1. P. Cooper and B. Schone, \"More Offers, Fewer Takers for Employment-Based\n142\u00ad149; P. Fronstin and S. Snider, \"An Examination of the Decline in Employ-\ning Picture of Health Insurance Coverage,\" Health Affairs (Winter 1995):\n2. By design, the questions on health insurance represent health insurance cover-\nage at a specific point in time--namely, during the reference week.\n3. See Cooper and Schone, \"More Offers, Fewer Takers.\" It seems probable that\nthe differences in health insurance coverage between alternative and wage-\nand-salary workers could be driven by differences in income between the two\ngroups. To examine this issue, we stratified the results in Exhibit 2 by family\nincome. We found that at all levels of income, alternative workers are much\nless likely than full-time wage-and-salary workers are to be eligible for em-\nployer plans and are more likely to be uninsured. Also, alternative workers are\nnot predominantly in low-income families. Approximately two million of the\nfour million alternative workers have annual family incomes above $30,000.\n4. These data are self-reported, and some caveats apply. First, there could be\nmultiple reasons that workers were not eligible for coverage, and the data\nrecord only one. Second, the responses reflect the worker's perceptions of why\nhe or she was not eligible, not necessarily the true reason for ineligibility.\n5. The Internal Revenue Code includes language outlining federal nondiscrimi-\nnation rules. With respect to self-insured health plans, eligibility rules meet\nthese tests if the plans meets one of the following criteria: It benefits at least 70\npercent of the employees; or it benefits at least 85 percent of those eligible,\nprovided 70 percent or more are eligible; or it benefits a nondiscriminatory\nclassification of employees. However, part-time or seasonal workers (gener-\nally those not employed more than twenty-five hours per week or seven\nmonths per year, or those working fewer than thirty-five hours per week or\nnine months per year) and certain other employees may be disregarded in\ndetermining the nondiscrimination eligibility tests. Loosening these rules to\nmake more workers eligible for health insurance would increase the availabil-\nity of such benefits to several million workers. At the same time, however,\nthese changes would increase the costs of providing such benefits.\nINSURANCE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 2\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
