Age group separate binary logistic regression analysis was\nused to identify risk factors for DUI.\nreported DUI. Higher frequency alcohol use, binge drinking, marijuana use, and major depressive episode significantly\nincreased the odds of DUI in both age groups. Lifetime arrest history was a predictor in the 65+ age group only.\nImplications: Research is needed to improve identification of older drivers at high risk of DUI. Driving safety assessments\nfor older adults can incorporate screening for substance abuse and comorbid mental conditions to identify those at high\nDUI risk. Older adults who engage in risky substance use should be directed to appropriate services that address substance\nuse and mental health problems concurrently.\n",

The fatal injury risk from crashes also significantly\nincreases in the 70+ group (Sifrit, Stutts, Martell, & Staplin,\nStudies of driving safety among older adults have\nfocused primarily on age-related declines in cognitive,\nfunctional, and visual capacities (Awadzi, Classen, Hall,\nDuncan, & Garvan, 2008; Thomas, Blomberg, Knodler,\nMathew, & Romoser, 2013). Few have considered one of\nthe major sources of preventable accidents--driving under\nthe influence of alcohol and/or drugs. Alcohol and/or other\ndrug involvement in crashes is less prevalent among older\nadults than among younger adults (Fell, Tippetts, & Voas,\ninvolved in fatal crashes who had a blood alcohol concen-\ng/dl; the proportion of drugged older\ndrivers is estimated to be even lower (National Highway\nTraffic Safety Administration, 2013). However, studies have\nshown an increasing rate of substance use disorders among\nolder adults, partly owing to aging baby boomers who are\nmore likely to have a history of substance use and related\nproblems than earlier cohorts (Blazer & Wu, 2009). A study\nand Health (NSDUH) found that 36.4% of those aged 65+\nor dependence symptoms, but 6.7% of those aged 65+ and\nsubthreshold dependence symptoms (Blazer & Wu, 2011).\nand Nutrition Examination Survey also found that 14.5%\nof drinkers aged 65+ consumed alcohol above the National\nInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's recommended\nlimits (Wilson,Knowles,Huang,& Fink,2014).When health\nstatus was taken into account, 37.4% had engaged in harm-\nful consumption (i.e., exacerbating or complicating existing\nhealth problems) and 15.9% had engaged in hazardous con-\nsumption (i.e., drinking that posed risks of future harm).\nused illicit drugs (marijuana being the most common sub-\ngroup) (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration [SAMHSA], 2011). Illicit drug abuse treat-\nment admissions among those 55 years and older have\nalso been increasing. SAMHSA's Treatment Episode Data\nSet (a compilation of descriptive data on the national flow\nof admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment pro-\nincrease in admissions of those aged 55+ for a primary\nproblem of illicit drug use (marijuana, cocaine, heroin,\nphencyclidine, hallucinogens, and methamphetamine),\nwhereas alcohol use as the primary substance decreased\nslightly (Arndt, Clayton, & Schultz, 2011). Illicit drug use\nis much more common in the 50\u00ad59 age group than in the\n60+ age group, but the prevalence may rise substantially\nin the 65+ age group as the younger cohort ages (Blazer &\nOlder adults tend to restrict or stop driving when physi-\ncal, cognitive, and/or vision impairments begin to affect\ntheir driving abilities (Baldock, Mathias, McLean, & Berndt,\nHowever, older adults tend to overrate their driving abili-\nties (Freund, Colgrove, Burke, & McLeod, 2005; Okonkwo,\nCrowe, Wadley, & Ball, 2008; Ross, Dodson, Edwards,\nAckerman, & Ball, 2012). Alcohol and drug use may con-\ntribute to older drivers' overrating tendency because these\nsubstances affect cognitive functioning, especially reasoning\nand decision-making abilities, despite the fact that these sub-\nstances negatively affect motor coordination and reaction\ntimes,concentration and memory,vision and ability to follow\nobjects with eyes, and discrimination between light inten-\nsity and sound that are requisite for safe driving (Mitchell,\n1985). Although drinking quantity tends to decline with age,\nalcohol-induced neurotoxicity in late life is a significant con-\ncern even with moderate alcohol consumption (Kapogiannis\net al., 2012). Aging- and disease-related physiological\nchanges (e.g., smaller body mass and lower water content)\nlead to higher and longer-lasting BACs in older adults than\nin younger adults (Ferreira & Weems, 2008). Older adults\nwho take multiple prescription and nonprescription medica-\ntions are also at higher risk for dangerous interaction effects\nof these medications with alcohol and/or illicit drugs.\nFor older adults, driving is not just a means of getting\nfrom one location to another but an essential tool for\nremaining mobile, socially integrated, and independent\n(Curl, Stowe, Cooney, & Proulx, 2014; Mezuk & Rebok,\nprolonging their safe driving capacities and providing\nalternative transportation for those who can no longer\ndrive is a necessity for successful aging. Older driver safety\ninvolves both vehicle/roadway characteristics and driver\nhealth/medical conditions (Staplin & Freund, 2013; Stutts,\nMartell, & Staplin, 2009). Increases in the number of\nolder drivers combined with increases in the prevalence of\nsubstance use among older adults indicate that concerns\nshould extend beyond those typically associated with older\nadult drivers' health and safety (e.g., physical/functional,\ncognitive, and sensory impairments) to include substance\nuse. Despite a projected upward trajectory in the num-\nber and proportion of older adults who drive under the\ninfluence of alcohol and/or drugs (DUI), DUI among older\nadults has received little research attention compared with\nDUI among adolescents and young and middle-aged adults.\nUsing multiyear survey data from nationally representative\nsamples, the present study (a) examined DUI risk factors\namong older adults, focusing on their substance use pat-\nterns and psychosocial vulnerabilities and (b) discerned\nConceptual Framework and Hypotheses\nDriving under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs\nmay be explained using alcohol (or drug) expectancy theory,\npsychosocial vulnerability, and poor decision-making ten-\ndencies. According to expectancy theory, people engage in\ncertain behaviors because they expect particular outcomes\n(reinforcing effects) as a result of engaging in the behavior.\nThose with more positive alcohol outcome expectations\n(e.g., social and physical pleasure, relaxation, coping, and\nassertiveness) are therefore likely to drink more (Devine &\nthat those with more positive alcohol expectancies tended\nto persist in driving after drinking. However, not all adults\nwho drink at problem levels drive under the influence or\nengage in other hazardous behaviors. Sadava (1985) found\na weak-to-moderate correlation between self-reported\nalcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems, show-\ning that heavy alcohol use is a necessary but not sufficient\ncondition for problem behaviors. In addition to frequency\nand quantity of alcohol consumption, other drug involve-\nment and psychosocial vulnerability (e.g., work-related and\nlife-change stress and emotional problems) contributed sig-\nnificantly to alcohol-related problem behaviors (Sadava).\nStudies have found that older adults drink for the same\nreasons as younger adults--to enhance positive mood or\nwell-being, obtain social rewards (e.g., celebrate special\noccasions with family and friends), cope with and attenu-\nate negative emotions (e.g., to forget worries and improve\ndepressed or anxious mood), or for medicinal purposes\nGilson and colleagues found that enhancement motives\n(but not social and coping motives) were associated with\ndrinking quantity and that coping motives had strong direct\nassociations with drinking problems. Others (Devanand,\nfound significant associations between late-life depression\nand alcohol/drug use. In addition to emotional distress,\nprevious research has shown that poor decision-making\ntendencies, as indicated by other legal transgressions and\nother forms of irresponsibility rooted in impulsivity and\nlack of self-control, may also contribute to DUI (Cavaiola,\nStrohmetz, & Abreo, 2007; Keane, Maxim, & Teevan,\n1993). However, it remains unknown if psychosocial vul-\nnerability (e.g., depression) and poor decision-making ten-\ndencies are associated with DUI in older adults.\nBased on expectancy theory and the perspective that psy-\nchosocial vulnerability and poor decision-making tendencies\ncontribute to alcohol (or drug)-related problem behaviors, we\ntested the following hypotheses: The likelihood of DUI among\nolder adults will be positively associated with (H1) quantity\nand frequency of alcohol consumption, (H2) use of any illicit\ndrug, (H3) depression (an indicator of psychosocial vulner-\nability), and (H4) any arrest history (an indicator of poor\ndecision-making tendencies). Potential differences between\nexamined. Although age and gender differences in substance\nuse and DUI have been well established (Maxwell & Freeman,\nstatus are less well established. Given the scant previous\nresearch on DUI in older adults, we also examined sociode-\nmographic and health correlates of DUI in both age groups.\nDesign and Methods\nData and Sample\nData for this study came from the public use files of the\nThe annual NSDUH series primarily measures the preva-\nlence and correlates of drug use and health status of the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged 12\nor older (Inter-university Consortium for Political and\nSocial Research [ICPSR], 2012a). The survey covers sub-\nstance abuse, treatment history, illegal activities, and arrest\nrecord and included questions from the fourth edition of\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n(DSM-IV) that were asked of respondents aged 18 and older.\nSurvey respondents were selected based on multistage area\nprobability sampling methods designed to ensure their rep-\nresentativeness and uniqueness (i.e., nonduplication from\nyear to year). Respondents were interviewed in private at\ntheir place of residence using a combination of methods\n(audio computer-assisted self-interview, computer-assisted\npersonal interview, and computer-assisted self-interview) to\nincrease the validity of reports of substance use and illegal\nTo increase the study's power to detect low frequency\nevents (e.g., DUI arrest), we combined 5 years of the de-\nidentified, public-domain survey data. The data collection\nmethods for the variables examined in this study were the\nsame for all five survey years. The total number of respond-\nwere 65+ years of age.\nMeasures\nDUI in the Past 12 Months\nThe NSUDH included four DUI-related questions: (a)\n\"During the past 12 months, have you driven a vehicle\nwhile you were under the influence of a combination of\nalcohol and illegal drugs used together?\" (b) \"During the\npast 12 months, have you driven a vehicle while you were\nunder the influence of alcohol/alcohol only?\" (c) \"During\nthe past 12 months, have you driven a vehicle while you\nwere under the influence of illegal drugs/illegal drugs\nonly?\" and (d) \"In the past 12 months, were you arrested\nand booked for driving under the influence of alcohol or\ndrugs?\" (ICPSR, 2012b). An affirmative response to any of\nthe earlier questions was considered DUI (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nAlcohol Use in Past 12 Months\nThis was defined as consuming at least one drink of any type\nof alcoholic beverage (described as a can or bottle of beer, a\nglass of wine or a wine cooler, a shot of liquor, or a mixed\ndrink with liquor) and excluded the use of only a sip or two\nfrom a drink (ICPSR, 2012b). Frequency of alcohol use:\nAlcohol users reported the total number of days they used\ning 5 drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or\nwithin a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in\nthe past 30 days. Heavy alcohol use was defined as drinking\n5 drinks on the same occasion on each of five or more days\nin the past 30 days; all heavy alcohol users are, therefore, also\nbinge alcohol users. DSM-IV diagnoses of alcohol dependence\nand abuse are also presented to describe the sample. Alcohol\ndependence and abuse were determined only if respondents\nreported alcohol use on more than 5 days in the past year.\nIllicit Drug Use in Past 12 Months\nThis included \"marijuana use\" (1 = yes, 0 = no) and \"illicit\ndrug use other than marijuana\" (1 = yes, 0 = no). Because\nof the small proportion of illicit drug users, frequency of\nuse was not considered, but DSM-IV diagnoses of illicit\ndrug dependence and abuse were presented to describe the\nsample. Marijuana dependence and abuse were determined\nonly if respondents reported use on more than 5 days in the\npast year, but the diagnostic criteria for other illicit drugs\napplied regardless of days of use.\nPsychosocial Vulnerabilities in Past 12 Months\nThis was represented by major depressive episode (MDE) in\nthe past year that met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (yes = 1,\nno = 0).To describe the sample, we also present worst month\nserious psychological distress (SPD), which was measured\nwith the six-item, 4-point Kessler Psychological Distress\nScale (K6; 0 = none of the time to 4 = all of the time; Kessler\net al., 2003). NSDUH respondents were asked how fre-\nquently during the past 30 days they experienced \"feeling\nnervous; feeling hopeless; feeling restless or fidgety; feeling\nso sad or depressed that nothing could cheer you up; feeling\nthat everything was an effort; and feeling down on yourself,\nno good, or worthless.\"A summed score of 13 or higher was\nconsidered as having had SPD in the past year. Cronbach's\nalpha for the K6 among the study sample was 0.91. Of those\nPoor Decision-Making Tendencies\nThis was measured by lifetime arrest history. Respondents\nwere asked whether or not they had ever been arrested/booked\nfor \"breaking the law\" in their lifetime (yes = 1, no = 0).\nSociodemographic and Health Status\nSociodemographic factors included age group (individual\nchronological age is not available in the public use data\nsets), gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, and\nincome. Health status variables included self-ratings of\nhealth (on a 5-point scale; 1 = excellent and 5 = poor) and\nthe number of diagnosed chronic illnesses (asthma, cir-\nrhosis of liver, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease,\nstroke, lung cancer, and pancreatitis).\nAnalysis\nAll analyses were conducted with Stata/MP 13's svy function\nto take into account NSDUH's multistage, stratified sam-\npling design. For the 5-year pooled data set for this study,\nadjusted person-level analysis weights were created by divid-\ning the final person-level analysis weights by the number of\nyears of combined data (five in the current study) following\nNSDUH guidelines for combining sampling weights across\nmultiple survey years. All estimates presented in this study\nare weighted except for sample sizes. Descriptive statistics, t\ntests, and 2 tests were used to present sample characteristics\nby past-year alcohol and/or illicit drug use and DUI status\nlogistic regression analysis, with DUI status as the depend-\nent variable, was used to test study hypotheses among those\nwho reported past-year alcohol and/or illicit drug use and to\nidentify DUI risk factors in each age group.\nResults\nSample Characteristics by Past-Year\nSubstance Use\ndrugs in the preceding 12 months. In both age groups,\nmore than 98% of users of any substance used alcohol,\nthe 65+ age group used illicit drugs. For both age groups,\ncompared with nonusers, substance users had higher pro-\nportions of men, non-Hispanic whites, married persons,\ncollege graduates, employed persons, and those with\nincome at or above 200% of federal poverty guidelines.\nSubstance users also reported better self-ratings of health\nand fewer chronic illnesses and included a smaller propor-\ntion of those who experienced SPD. For the 50\u00ad64 age\ngroup, substance users also included a smaller propor-\ntion of those with MDE. However, for the 65+ age group,\nthere was no difference between users and nonusers in\nMDE rates.\nself-reported DUI in the preceding 12 months, but only a\ntiny proportion reported having been arrested/booked for\nDUI. As expected, a majority of those reporting DUI drove\nunder the influence of alcohol rather than other drugs.\nSample Characteristics by Past-Year DUI Status\nAmong Substance Users\nTable 3 shows that for both age groups, those reporting\nDUI, compared with those who did not, were more likely\nto be men, college graduates, employed, had income at or\nabove 200% of federal poverty guidelines, and reported\nbetter self-ratings of health and fewer chronic illnesses. In\nthe 50\u00ad64 age group, DUI reporters were also more likely\nto be non-Hispanic white, but the racial/ethnic distribution\nin the 65+ age group did not differ significantly by DUI\nstatus. DUI reporters aged 65+ were also more likely to be\nmarried than those not reporting DUI, but DUI reporters\naged 50\u00ad64 were less likely to be married.\nAs expected, those who reported DUI, compared with\nthose who did not, used alcohol more frequently and in\nreporters in both age groups reported heavy drinking in\nheavy drinking, in the preceding 30 days. Nearly 25% of\nDUI reporters, compared with 3% of nonreporters, aged\nwith 2% of nonreporters, aged 65+ met DSM-IV diagnos-\ntic criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse.\n9.96% in the 65+ age group reported any illicit drug use,\njuana use.

For example,\nin both age groups, compared with those who consumed\nalcohol on fewer than 50 days, those who did so on 300\nor more days had nearly fivefold greater odds of report-\ning DUI (odds ratio [OR] = 4.97, 95% confidence interval\ngroup). Compared with nonbinge drinkers, binge drinkers\nhad significantly higher odds of DUI reports (OR = 2.52,\ngroup). Marijuana use was also a significant predictor of\nillicit drug use was a significant predictor in the younger,\nbut not the older, age group. MDE was a significant pre-\narrest history did not predict DUI in the younger age\nbeing male and having income at or above 200% of federal\npoverty guidelines significantly increased the odds of DUI\nreports for both age groups. In addition, higher education\nin the 65+ age group and being non-Hispanic white and\nbeing employed in the 50\u00ad64 age group increased the odds,\nwhereas being married decreased the odds in the 50\u00ad64 age\ngroup. The health status variables significantly predicted\nDUI in the 50\u00ad64 age group only, with better health being\nassociated with greater odds of DUI reports.\nDiscussion\nOlder adults have increased susceptibility to the effects of\nalcohol and drugs and higher fatal injury risks from motor\nvehicle crashes. In the face of increasing rates of substance\nuse among older adults, this study examined DUI risk\nfactors among the growing older population. The higher\nrates of substance use, particularly illicit drug use, among\nthat substance use among older adults is likely to continue\nto increase as those in the younger age group (baby boom-\ners) swell the ranks of older adults. The findings show that\nsubstance users tend to be better off economically and\nare healthier than nonusers. Those with limited financial\nresources and very poor health may be less likely to drink\nalcohol or use drugs due to inability to obtain these sub-\nstances or because they recognize that these behaviors are\ndetrimental to their health. The self-reported DUI rate of\n6.19% among substance users in the 65+ age group was\nHowever, the DUI rate in the 65+ age group may actually\nbe higher if those who never drove or stopped driving due\nto age- and disease-related disabilities had been excluded\n(NSDUH does not include this information). Even a 6%\nDUI rate is alarming given older adults' higher motor vehi-\ncle crash rates per vehicle mile of travel and higher fatal\ninjury risks from these crashes. As DUI offenders are at risk\nfor committing subsequent offenses (Cavaiola et al., 2007),\nolder adults who continue to drive under the influence pose\na substantial safety concern.\nThe findings also provide support for alcohol expectancy\ntheory, psychosocial vulnerability, and poor decision-mak-\ning tendencies in predicting DUI risks. Higher frequency\nalcohol use, binge drinking, and marijuana use significantly\nincreased the odds of self-reported DUI in both age groups.\nThese findings indicate that substance use patterns among\nolder DUI reporters do not differ from those of younger\nage groups for whom binge drinking has consistently been\nfound to significantly predict DUI and DUI recidivism\n2011). These studies also found that following alcohol,\nmarijuana/cannabinoids is the second most prevalent sub-\nstance found in fatally injured drivers, and significant alco-\nhol\u00addrug and drug\u00addrug interactions among polysubstance\nusers were also observed. Our findings also show that DUI\nreporters were more likely to have a history of substance\nabuse and encounters with law enforcement. Higher rates\nof MDE and SPD among the DUI reporters also indicate\nthat this group suffers from substantial emotional dis-\ntress (i.e., co-occurring mental disorders) that should be\naddressed in combination with substance use and abuse.\nThe findings for both age groups regarding DUI soci-\nodemographic risk factors (being male, non-Hispanic\nwhite, employed, and having higher education/income)\nand health-status risk factors (better or similar self-rat-\nings of health and chronic illnesses) are also worth not-\ning. Older drivers tend to have higher socioeconomic and\nphysical, functional, and cognitive health statuses than\nformer drivers, as health deterioration is associated with\ndriving cessation (O'Connor, Edwards, Waters, Hudak,\n& Vald\u00e9s, 2013). Although DUI-reporting older adults\nappear to be more advantaged socioeconomically and\nmore or similarly advantaged in health statuses as their\nage peers who did not report DUI, their mental health\nstatus is worse. Continued heavy drinking and illicit drug\nuse combined with psychological distress may also por-\ntend worse health and mental outcomes for these older\nadults.\nThe study has a few limitations: (a) The reliability and\nvalidity of respondents' self-report of DUI was not ascer-\ntained, and underreporting due to recall or social desirabil-\nity bias is a concern. (b) Respondents' driving status was not\navailable; some nonreporters may not have driven during\nthe survey period. (c) Despite the 5-year pooled data, the\nsmall number of older adults reporting DUI hampered more\nin-depth analysis (e.g., polysubstance use as a risk factor).\nDespite its limitations, this study suggests the follow-\ning policy and practice implications for promoting driving\nsafety by preventing and reducing DUI among the growing\nnumber of older drivers: (a) Health and social service pro-\nviders can educate older, substance-using drivers about age-\nrelated changes that affect substance use effects in general\nand driving safety in particular and motivate those in need\nto seek treatment. (b) Access to evidence-based treatment\nneeds to be facilitated for older substance abusers in gen-\neral and DUI reporters in particular, given that approxi-\nmately one quarter of older DUI reporters perceived the\nneed for treatment but did not receive it. (c) Addressing the\nemotional distress many DUI reporters experience may also\nreduce substance use and promote driving safety.\nThis study also underscores the need for continued\nresearch to improve identification of older drivers at high\nrisk of DUI and identify effective intervention approaches.\nThese approaches should take into account older drivers'\ncharacteristics, behaviors, and expectations in order to pre-\nvent crash and injury while also prolonging their mobility.\nSuggested steps are as follows: (a) Test improved protocols\nfor assessing older adults' driving safety by screening for\nsubstance abuse and comorbid mental health conditions in\naddition to assessing motor, visuoperceptual, and cogni-\ntive functioning. (b) Expand research on nonmedical use\nof prescription and over-the-counter psychoactive medica-\ntions and use of multiple medications that may affect older\nadults' driving safety and DUI. (c) Focus on intelligent\ntransportation system technology that holds promise for\nmaintaining and enhancing safe mobility of older adults\n(Dickerson et al., 2007). Advanced technology should not\njust help older adults drive safely but also prevent them\nfrom driving when it is not safe, for example, by providing\na tool that older adults can easily use to self-screen their\nsubstance-impaired driving limitations.\nTable 4.
