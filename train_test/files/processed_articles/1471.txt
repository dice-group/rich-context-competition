However, the potential impact of achieving those risk factor reductions on both population levels and social\ndisparities in CHD has not been quantified.\nMethods and Results--Data on 10-year risk of CHD (from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination\nEpidemiological Follow-Up study 1971 to 1982), prevalence of major CHD risk factors (from the National Health\nrate to 12%, hypertension to 14%, high cholesterol levels to 17%, diabetes to 2.5%, and obesity to 15%) were used\nto estimate effects of different scenarios on population levels and social disparities in CHD. Over a 10-year period,\nthe largest relative reductions in population levels of CHD (20.0% in men; 23.9% in women) would be achieved\nif all social groups met the HP2010 targets. CHD disparities would be most reduced if the less educated (absolute\ndisparities reduced by 66.1% in men; 56.3% in women) and the low income group (absolute disparities reduced\nby 93.7% in men; 94.3% in women) achieved the targets before the most advantaged.

This approach has been\ncalled the leveling up strategy7 and has been suggested as the\ngoal to which policies to reduce health disparities should\nstrive because the risk in the most advantaged group can be\nconsidered to be the best possible attainable in a particular\npopulation. In fact, HP2010 targets are often defined on the\nbasis of levels observed among socially advantaged groups.1\n Although population-level changes in cholesterol,\nblood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and obesity are\nrelated to decreases in coronary heart disease (CHD)\nmortality, the size of CHD reductions that would be\nachieved by levels proposed by the Healthy People\n Reducing major risk factors in low socioeconomic\ngroups would reduce absolute social disparities in\nCHD by 70%, but no study has estimated the\nreduction of disparities if all socioeconomic groups\nachieve HP2010 targets for major CHD risk factors.\n To obtain the maximum reduction in overall CHD\nlevels in the United States (by 20% in men and\n23.9% in women), every educational or income\ngroup should achieve the HP2010 targets in choles-\nterol, blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes.\n To achieve the maximum reduction in CHD dispar-\nmost disadvantaged group should achieve the\nHP2010 targets earlier than the most advantaged\ngroups.\n Universal interventions to reduce CHD risk factors\nto HP2010 targets that focused on all social groups\nwould produce the best scenario for both population\nlevels and social disparities in CHD.\nMethods\nRationale\nTo model these scenarios, we used data from the First National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Epidemiological Follow-Up study\ndetermine a risk function that represented the association between\nrisk factors and the 10-year absolute risk of CHD. The NHEFS was\nchosen because it is the only nationally representative data that allow\nthe estimation of fatal and nonfatal CHD events. We then used the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003\nto 2004 to determine the current distribution of major risk factors,\nthe current prevalence of some risk factors and underestimate the\nprevalence of diabetes and obesity. The risk function obtained from\nNHEFS was then applied to the risk factor distribution observed in\nby including education and income separately in the risk function.\nUsing the CHD risk equation recalibrated to current risk factors\nlevels we introduced changes in the distribution of the major risk\nfactors to simulate the 4 hypothetical scenarios above.\nData Sources\nof the study have been reported elsewhere.8 We used baseline\ninformation and data collected in the first follow-up, in 1982. CHD\nthe discharge diagnosis on 1 or more hospital or nursing home\nrecords, or for the primary or underlying cause of death on the death\nsample of 10 122 persons in the United States aged 1 year or older.\nInformation on demographics and standardized laboratory tests at\nbaseline was used for the analysis. The sample analyzed in both\nsurveys was composed of blacks and whites, aged 30 to 74 years at\nbaseline, with complete information on risk factors, who did not\nreport a history of heart disease at baseline. This resulted in 3588\nwomen for NHANES analysis.\nSocioeconomic Position\nIn NHEFS and NHANES, education was categorized into less than\nhigh school (low education), high school graduate (middle educa-\ntion), and some college, college graduate, or higher (high education).\nIn NHEFS, total family income was recorded in 12 categories from\ncomparable, tertiles of income were calculated as follows: low\nMeasurement of CHD Risk Factors\nDiabetes was analyzed as a dichotomous variable. Participants\nexamined at baseline in NHEFS were considered to have diabetes if\nthey answered affirmatively to the question \"Has a doctor ever told\nif they answered \"yes\" to both of the following questions: \"Do you\nhave any reason to think you have diabetes, sometimes called sugar\ndiabetes or sugar disease? Did a doctor say you have it?\" For\ndiabetes if they answered affirmatively to the question \"Has a doctor\never told you that you have diabetes?\" or had a fasting glucose test\nequal or greater than 126 mg/d. Respondents' \"blood pressure\" was\nclassified categorically according to their systolic blood pressure\n(SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) recorded at baseline in\n(hypertensive stage II). \"Smoking\" was derived from questions in the\nfollow-up interview on lifetime smoking history. For NHANES 2003\nto 2004 the 3 questions on current, ever, and never consumption were\nused. \"Total cholesterol levels\" (mg/dL) were obtained in both\nsurveys following standard Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\nmg/dL (high), 280 mg/dL (very high). Weight and height were\nmeasured following standard protocols, and \"body mass index\"\n(BMI) was calculated as kg/m2.\nAnalysis\nOur analysis was done in 7 steps (see Figure 2 for a detailed analytic\nflow chart). Once the NHEFS and NHANES databases were com-\nparable in regard to age, sex, ethnicity, information on risk factors\nhttp://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nand CHD history (step 1), we assessed the risk of CHD in NHEFS\nusing 2 sex-specific Cox survival models, 1 using education and\nanother using income as the measure of socioeconomic position (step\n2). We included the 5 major risk factors (diabetes, systolic and\ndiastolic blood pressure, smoking, total cholesterol, and BMI) as\nreported,10,11 but without including high-density lipoprotein (HDL)\nbecause it was not measured in the NHEFS. Fitting the best model\nwas preceded by analysis of proportionality and by testing 2-order\ninteractions between all major risk factors, and between each risk\nfactor and age.12 No interactions were found to be significant, and\nproportionality was fulfilled for all variables. The accuracy of the\nmodel was quantified with the use of the C statistic (which estimates\nthe model's ability to discriminate between those who had and did\nnot have events) and with a nonparametric reliability curve to\ncalibrate the model (the degree of agreement between the observed\nand predicted CHD cases).12 The C statistic for men and women was\n0.75 and 0.82 for the model using education, and was similar when\nusing income. Graphical results of the accuracy of the models and\nCox coefficients are presented in the supplemental file. Then, the\nfollowing the Framingham recalibration approach11 (step 3) and\nusing the current distribution of risk factors, separately for education\nand income (see supplemental materials for details). A CHD risk was\nthen obtained for each educational and income group (step 4). The\nnext step consisted of using the recalibrated equation, but now\nintroducing the changes in risk factor distribution according to the 4\nscenarios (step 5). The distributions of risk factors for the hypothet-\nical scenarios are presented in supplemental Tables I and II. Then,\nthe predicted CHD risk was obtained for each educational and\nincome group for each of the hypothetical scenarios (step 6). Finally,\nthe predicted risk obtained under the current (NHANES) distribution\nof risk factors and under hypothetical changes for each of the\nscenarios was used to calculate the measures of overall and health\nequity impact (step 7). To examine the effects on population levels\nof CHD, we calculated (1) the predicted risk in NHANES 2003 to\n2004 and (2) the percentage reduction in overall CHD risk. To\nexamine the effects on disparities in CHD we calculated 4 indicators:\n(1) the risk ratio between (RR) between socioeconomic groups,\nwhich measures relative disparities, (2) the absolute risk difference\n(AR) between socioeconomic groups, (3) the percent reduction in\ndisparities in relative terms or \"relative disparity reduction\" (RDR),\nand (4) the percent \"absolute disparity reduction\" (ADR). Details of\ncalculations are presented in the supplemental materials.\nSensitivity Analyses\nAll analyses were repeated using binary logistic regression and\nparametric survival models, and including risk factors as continuous\nrather than categorical variables, and testing for nonlinearity of the\neffects. No substantive differences were observed regarding perfor-\nmance statistics, so we present results of the Cox model described\nabove. Additionally, the complexity of the survey sample in NHEFS\nwas taken into consideration in our analysis by including sampling\nweights in our analysis8; weighting did not change the estimation of\nthe associations so we present unweighted analysis. Because of a\nFigure 1. Preventive scenarios estimated. The figure shows an example of changes in smoking rates in men according to the 4 scenar-\nios. A gradient is observed in the NHANES 2003 to 2004 respondents, as shown in the upper-middle figure. The target for current\nsmoking is 12%. In the scenarios on the left, smoking in the whole population is reduced, but a gradient in current smoking remains in\nscenario 2. In the scenarios on the right, disparities in the less educated are reduced to the level of the HP2010 target (scenario 3), or\nto the level of the most educated (scenario 4).\nhttp://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\npossible underestimation of the association of risk factors and CHD\nattributable to measurement error, attenuation by reverse causation, and\nshort latency effects13 as well as to high sample variation attributable to\nsmall numbers of cases, we repeated our analysis (1) using the lower and\nupper 95% confidence intervals of the Cox regression coefficients of\nNHEFS (for all CHD risk factors) and (2) using the Cox regression\ncoefficients obtained in the Framingham cohort.10 These sensitivity\nanalyses provided one indication of the \"best and worst case\" situation\ngiven potential measurement error.\nResults\nOver a mean follow-up of 8.6 years in the NHEFS study, 486\nincident cases of CHD were observed in women and 562 in\nmen. Hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol levels, and ever\nor current smoking were all significantly associated with\nprevalence of CHD risk factors in women was 7% for\ndiabetes, 24% for smoking, 16.7% for high blood pressure,\n19.3% for high cholesterol levels, and 35.5% for obesity. The\n33.8%. Neither women nor men with 12 or fewer years of\neducation or with low income achieved HP2010 goals for any\nof the CHD risk factors, whereas those in the highest\neducational category and those in the high income group were\nclose to achieving the HP2010 goals for cholesterol and blood\npressure (see supplemental materials).\nTable 1 presents the estimates for reduction of population\nlevels of CHD for women and men 50 years of age in\nfactors, the overall risk at 10 years will be 10.4% in men and\n3.5% in women. The lowest achievable population risk (8.4%\nin men and 2.7% in women) will be obtained under scenario\n1, if all social groups meet the HP2010 targets; these figure\nare similar to the estimates obtained under scenario 2, where\nthe overall population achieves the targets but relative social\ndifferences in risk factors remain. In both scenario 3, in which\nonly the most disadvantaged achieve the risk factor targets,\nand scenario 4, in which the most disadvantaged achieve the\nsame levels of risk factors as the most advantaged, the\npopulation risk would be reduced by a smaller amount.\nTable 2 presents the estimates for disparity reduction by\neducation. The greatest reduction in disparities (either in\nrelative or absolute terms) would be obtained under scenario\n3, where only the most disadvantaged achieve the targets.\nScenario 3 would reduce the absolute risk difference in the\nreverse the disparity between the middle educated and the\nmost educated in women and men (see supplemental Table\nIV). Scenario 2, which shows change in the population levels\nof risk factors without eliminating the social gradient, pro-\nFigure 2.

Scenario 4--the\n\"leveling up\" strategy--results in similarly small reductions\nof absolute disparities as in scenario 2. Because scenarios 3\nand 4 do not alter the risk in the most advantaged group, they\nlead to the same percentage reductions in both absolute and\nrelative disparity.14 In contrast, in scenarios 1 and 2, where\nchanges occur in the most advantaged, reduction of dispari-\nties in relative terms is smaller than that for absolute\ndisparities.\nTable 3 presents the results for reduction in disparities by\nincome. The ranking of the scenarios according to reduction\nof disparities are the same as those observed for education:\nthe greatest reduction in disparities is observed in scenario 3\nand the lowest reduction in scenario 2. However, a greater\nreduction in disparities in absolute and relative terms is\nobserved for scenarios targeting the lowest income group\nthan what is observed for education. For instance, under\nscenario 3 the reduction in both relative and absolute income\nscenario 4, absolute and relative reductions are by 43.3% in\nFigure 3A (education) and 3B (income) summarizes the\npotential balance between reducing the burden of CHD in the\nwhole population and the reduction of disparities in CHD. As\nmentioned above, scenarios 1 and 2, which seek to reduce\nrisk factors across the whole population, would cause greater\nreductions in the population's overall risk of CHD than\nscenarios that focus on the disadvantaged. Scenario 3, in\nwhich only the most disadvantaged achieve the targets,\nresults in the largest percentage reduction in social disparities,\nfor income and education, and for women and men. The\nscenario that focuses on having the most disadvantaged group\nachieve the current risk factor levels of the most advantaged\n(scenario 4) is not better than scenario 3 in reduction of\ndisparities, and it is the worst scenario for reducing overall\npopulation levels of CHD.\nSensitivity Analysis\nThe results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Figures\n1 and 2 in the supplemental file. Using Framingham esti-\nmates, the results consistently show that scenarios 1 and 2\ngive the best reductions in population levels of CHD (Figure\n1) and that scenario 3 give the best reductions for disparities\n(Figure 2); the ranking of the scenarios is almost the same as\nthat obtained with NHEFS estimates.\nDiscussion\nEvidence consistently shows that population-level changes in\nthe major CHD risk factors--high cholesterol, high blood\nAchieved Levels of Advantaged\nMost Disadvantaged\n10-y Risk All Social Groups Whole Population Most Disadvantaged\nMen\nPa\nPb\nReduction of CHD risk\nWomen\nReduction of CHD risk\nPa\nindicates risk in the whole population under the current distribution of risk factors; Pb\n, risk in the whole population under the hypothetical scenarios.\nTable 2.

We found that the most\neffective reductions in overall CHD levels (20.0% in men and\n23.9% in women) would be achieved under the ideal scenario\n1, where every educational or income group achieved the\ntargets. On the other hand, the maximum reduction in CHD\ndisparities (in education and income) would, not surprisingly,\noccur under scenario 3--the \"deprivation focused\" ap-\nproach--where the most disadvantaged group achieved the\nHP2010 targets earlier than the most advantaged. Unfortu-\ntargets could be achievable by 2010 for the whole population,\nand this is even less likely in the most disadvantaged groups.\nUniversal strategies that attempt to equalize risk factors at\nfavorable levels (scenario 1) or reduce risk factors propor-\ntionally across social groups (scenario 2) produce better\nscenarios in terms of reducing average population levels of\nCHD risk. This occurs through a reduction in risk factor\nlevels and consequently 10-year absolute risk in all groups,\nand a reduction of risk among women and men in the highest\neducational category, who constituted 60% of the population.\nProportional improvements in risk factors (scenario 2) may\nbe the most likely result of population policies to reduce CHD\nrisk (salt content, fat content, labels, cigarette taxes, etc).\nStrategies that address modification of risk factors at the\npopulation level are advocated as complementary strategies\nto individual-level high-risk strategies to prevent CHD cas-\nes.22,23 Data from the United States confirm that smoking\nreductions of 5% in 7 years in New York, and of 8% in 2\nyears in California have been achieved with population\npolicies such as cigarette tax policies, antismoking cam-\npaigns, and smoke-free indoor air policies.21,24 In New York,\nan 8% reduction in hospital admissions for myocardial\ninfarctions has been attributed to smoking bans.25 Mean\ncholesterol reductions of 6% (13 mg/dL) and high systolic\nblood pressure reductions of 4% (5.1 mm Hg) have been\nachieved in the United States in the last 20 years, a result of\npharmacological and lifestyle modifications, and these reduc-\ntions have contributed 44% to the reduction in CHD mortality.16\nAchieving the targets in the overall population without\nchanging relative social disparities in risk factors (scenario 2)\nwill have less impact on decreasing disparities (both absolute\nand relative) than the scenario where targets are achieved in\nall social groups or the \"deprivation focused\" approach.\nUnder scenario 2, we purposely did not change the proportion\nof exposure to risk factors in each social group to more\nrealistically simulate the likely effects of population level\ninterventions. This is because population-based strategies to\nreduce risk factors appear to benefit the more advantaged\ngroups as people in higher social positions tend to adapt\nbetter to new situations and derive benefits faster than the\nmore disadvantaged.26\u00ad28 For instance, folic acid fortification\nhas been shown to have a differential impact on folic acid\nlevels and widening disparities have been observed.26,29\nTable 3.

One explanation is that in the United States, the\npopulation risk factor profile of even the most highly edu-\ncated group is not ideal; as such, small changes in CHD risk\nwould be expected in the least advantaged groups. Even the\nhighly educated group still remains far from HP2010 targets;\ntheir current prevalence for smoking is 18%, for diabetes\nThe leveling up equity strategies assume decreasing dis-\nparities by improving the health of the disadvantaged without\nworsening the health of the better off, and may appear more\nfeasible because it is known that the advantaged groups of the\npopulation have been able to achieve these levels.7 For\ninstance, in the United States, there is evidence of decreased\ndisparities in high blood pressure since 1971.6 Greater access\nto primary preventive strategies and awareness and control of\nhypertension among the most socially disadvantaged, with\nlesser but important improvements observed among the most\nadvantaged, could be responsible for that decline. However,\nwhen the risk factor profiles of the advantaged are not ideal,\nthis will not produce a better outcome for reducing absolute\ndisparities than reducing risk factor levels in the whole\npopulation (scenario 2). Thus, reduction in levels of risk\nfactors in all social groups is likely the best approach to\nachieve both overall reduction and disparities reduction.\nNevertheless, if the most disadvantaged were able to achieve\nthe targets before or at faster rate than the most advantaged,\neven greater reductions in disparities would occur.\nAlthough previous studies of policy effects have not\nspecifically addressed CHD, they may be useful to under-\nstand the plausibility of the scenario where improvements\nhappen faster among the disadvantaged. Among minorities\nand impoverished social groups, policies that increase access\nto health care were observed to reduce infant mortality32 and\nUnited States (because of greater benefits in those popula-\ntions). Enhancing primary care practices have also reduced\nsocial disparities in rates of immunization, where greater\nchanges in immunization rates were observed among\nblacks.34 scenario 3 would represent the expected effect of\nsome preventive strategies already in place in the United\nStates that aim to decrease prevalence of major risk factor\nlevels among the least educated, the poorest, or among racial\nminorities, faster than in more advantaged groups (ie, the\nOur findings support the importance of continued monitor-\ning of both absolute and relative disparities. The high abso-\nlute changes in disparity observed here reveal that the burden\nof CHD is still high in all social groups, and monitoring\nabsolute disparities would be fundamental to capture the\nreduction of CHD burden in all social groups. Relative\ndisparity reductions remain important for social gradients and\nshould continue to be monitored to capture any increase in the\nunequal social distribution of risk factors. Potentially mitigat-\ning some of the concerns about increasing relative disparity,37\nwe found that reducing overall levels of risk in the popula-\ntion, as in the case of scenario 2, did not increase relative\ndisparities, but produced only small relative and absolute\ndisparity reductions. An increase in relative disparities given\nan overall decline in risk is not an immutable outcome, but\ndepends on the social context and the existence of policies or\nprograms that guarantee that the health of the least advan-\ntaged does not worsen.33\nLimitations\nThe biggest limitation of our study is that the scenarios tested\nhere relate only to changes in levels of risk factors and do not\ndirectly map onto known interventions that could achieve\nsuch changes, and the \"causal effects\" of our hypothetical\ninterventions are difficult to establish without direct linkage\nto real interventions.19,38 Our model assumes that the popu-\nlation is stable in time, and that people will remain in the\nsame category of exposures for as long as 10 years (which is\nplausible for education). These assumptions apply to any\nanalysis of mediation of social disparities in CHD risk, but\nincluding such uncertainties requires more sophisticated\nmodeling techniques (see for instance reference39) that incor-\nporate levels of adherence to preventive strategies, changes in\nthe social determinants (income and education), or inclusion\nof other CHD predictors. However, although these uncertain-\nties may affect the magnitude of reductions under the differ-\nent scenarios (as shown in the sensitivity analyses), we expect\nthat they would likely result in the same ranking of the\npreventive scenarios.\nOur study was based on a risk model that included the\nfollowing aspects: fatal and nonfatal CHD events, a relative\nrisk calculated from a representative sample of white and\nblack people, and the risk factor distribution of a similar but\nmore recent sample.40 Modeling of effects of preventive\nstrategies on overall CHD risk and disparities have used data\nfrom different sources15,16,19 because the data necessary to\nconduct modeling is not available in one dataset. We have\nmade use of the best available evidence (Framingham risk\npredictive factors) and of the only available national data of\nmeasured risk factors in the United States (NHEFS,\nNHANES). Inaccuracy and possible overestimation of abso-\nlute risk prediction models41 may limit the interpretation of\nthe absolute risk as a \"real risk\" in the population but not the\ncomparative interpretation of results across interventions that\nare all subject to the same limitations.

Finally, we\nused self-reported prevalence of diabetes to calculate the risk\nof CHD in NHEFS because of lack of information on glucose\nlevels. We have estimated that a possible underestimation of\nthe effect of diabetes on CHD may have occurred. If\nsensitivity of self-reported diabetes was 73% and specificity\nwas 99.3%,42 the relative risk of diabetes related to CHD\nImplications\nOur results suggest strategic directions to pursue and some of\nthe likely benefits to overall levels and social disparities in\nCHD.

Such research is beginning to appear in\nthe public health and epidemiological literature and should be\nIf future policy and programs in the United States continue\nto focus on major risk factors to reduce population levels and\ndisparities in CHD--as they should--then such policies\nshould be mainly centered on universal approaches to reduc-\ning the main CHD risk factors in all social groups, promoting\nthe right to better cardiovascular health for all. A rational\nportfolio of approaches would include: (1) Developmental\nstrategies that focus on getting younger cohorts to middle-age\nwithout developing the major risk factors46; (2) Population\nlevel strategies that attempt to reduce mean levels of the\nmajor risk factors in the middle-aged population; and (3)\nTargeted strategies to reduce risk factors in those over\nmiddle-age with elevated levels through medications and\nlifestyle interventions.43 Any consideration of these 3 ap-\nproaches should also take into account that in population\napproaches for risk factor reduction, regulatory and structural\npolicies (increase in prices, smoking bans)30,47 might be more\neffective in narrowing disparities than information-based\napproaches (antismoking adverts, nutritional labeling); that\nany approach should be more intense in the most disadvan-\ntaged groups, so as to help them achieve targets faster; and\nthat special effort should be made to start appropriate inter-\nventions early in life48 to reduce the exposure of younger\npopulations to the risk factors.\nAlthough community experiments aiming to reduce the\nmain risk factors have only had small impacts on CHD\nmorbidity and mortality,49 national trends have clearly shown\nthat primary preventive strategies to reduce major risk factor\nlevels in the population as well as access to medications have\nresulted in a reduction in CHD rates in the United States.15\nReducing levels of traditional risk factors is the right strategy to\nreduce overall population levels and social disparities in CHD.\nSources of Funding\nThis work was supported by a research grant, entitled \"Health\nDisparities: Intergenerational Dynamics and Evidence-based Assess-\nment Strategies\" (H0A-80072; John Lynch, PI, Rebecca Fuhrer,\nCo-PI), from the Canadian Institutes of Health.
