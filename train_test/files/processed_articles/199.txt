This study answers these questions using citizen self-\nreports of their traffic stop encounters with the police. Net of other\nimportant explanatory variables, the data indicate that police make traf-\nfic stops for Driving While Black and male.

The study also discusses the validity of citizen self-\nreport data and outlines an agenda for future research.\nKEYWORDS Driving While Black; traffic stops by the police.\nDo police make traffic stops for Driving While Black? Are African-\nAmerican men as compared with white men more likely to self-report\nbeing stopped by police for traffic law violations? Are African-American\nand Hispanic drivers more likely to perceive the stop as pretextual and less\nlikely to report that police had a legitimate reason for stopping them? Do\nthe special problems associated with encounters between police and citi-\nzens of color mean that African-American and Hispanic citizens are less\nlikely to exit their traffic stop encounters believing police acted properly?\nThis paper answers these questions using citizen self-reports of their\ntraffic stop encounters with police. We begin with previous research on\nthe effects of extralegal variables on police actions and research on Driv-\ning While Black, including the limits of that research. We then analyze\ncitizen self-reports from a nationally representative sample and control for\nother important explanatory measures such as social class to clarify and\nWe thank Colin Odden for downloading the data and guidance in data analysis.\nChristie Batson for noting that it is common for scholars to use data from citizens in\ntheir analyses of crime, criminals. and criminal justice, and three anonymous reviewers\nand the Editor for very helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.\nextend prior research on traffic stops for Driving While Black and on citi-\nzen perceptions of police actions.\nPrevious research has regularly reported that extralegal factors affect\npolice actions after an encounter with a citizen has been initiated. In the\nstrated that the police officers he studied paid close attention to the race,\nnationality, and social class of juvenile offenders when deciding whether to\nfound that police were quicker to use unnecessary force when suspects did\nnot show respect to officers and as a means of soliciting information.\nSince these and similar studies (Black and Reiss, 1970),there has been a\nsteady stream of research focuscd on how extralegal variables affect police\nactions during encounters with citizens (for reviews, see Riksheim and\nsupports two conclusions. First, extralegal variables play an especially\nimportant role in the context of low-visibility police actions such as the\ndecision to write a traffic ticket once a traffic stop has been made (Reiss,\nresults concerning race and ethnicity have been mixed with some finding\nHowever, previous research on the effects of extralegal factors has been\nlimited to what police do once an encounter with a citizen has begun.\nScholars. for example, have examined police resolution of traffic stop\nencounters (Lundman, 1994) but not the decision by police to make a traf-\nfic stop in the first place. Much less is therefore known about the possible\neffects of extralegal factors such as race and ethnicity on police decisions\nto proactively initiate traffic stop encounters with citizens.\nResearch on \"Driving While Black\" remedies the limits of scholarly\nstudy of the effects of extralegal factors by directing sustained attention to\nwhether race and ethnicity affect police decisions to initiate traffic stop\nencounters (Harris, 2002). This literature also directs attention to how\nrace and ethnicity shape citizen perceptions of the legitimacy of the traffic\nstop and to citizen perceptions of the propriety of police actions during the\ntraffic stop encounter (Weitzer and Tuch, 2002).\nExtant studies of traffic stops for Driving While Black appear to indi-\ncate that police stop African-American drivers more often than would be\nexpected on the basis of population baselines (Walker, 2000). For exam-\nple, San Diego Police Department data (Berjarano, 2001) show that.\nalthough African Americans made up only 8% of the city's population\naged 15 years and older, 12% of all traffic stops involved African-Ameri-\ncan drivers, as did 14%of traffic stops for equipment violations. Similarly,\nZingraff et al. (2000%) reported in their preliminary analysis of traffic\nstops by the North Carolina State Highway Patrol that, although African\nAmericans accounted for 19.6% of North Carolina's licensed drivers,\n22.9% of traffic tickets were issued to African Americans (also see Lam-\nHowever, there is more to Driving While Black than disproportionate\ntraffic stops. Scholars have also directed attention to the effects of race\nand ethnicity on citizen perceptions of \"pretextual\" traffic stops by police\n(Harris, 2002) and to the special problems that accompany encounters\nbetween police and citizens of color (Sykes and Clark, 1975; also see\ntherefore serve as a pretext for police motivated by other concerns such as\nobservation of drivers and passengers for signs of drug use or possession\nWhren v. United States (Harris, 2002), the Supreme Court ruled that\npretextual stops are legal if the police officer making the stop can articu-\nlate a reason grounded in traffic statutes. In the Whren case specifically,\nthe police officers who made the stop and then found crack cocaine\nexplained their action by citing a local statute requiring that drivers devote\n\"full time and attention\" (Hall, 1996:2) to their driving.\nIf police are making pretextual traffic stops, then African-American and\nother drivers of color ought logically to exit their traffic stop encounters\nperceiving that police did not have a legitimate reason for making the\nstop. If police are not using traffic law violations as a pretext for stops, it\ncould be argued that there should not be any difference between citizens\nof color and whites in their perception of the legitimacy of the stops they\nexperience. However, as we discuss next, other processes influence citi-\nzens' perceptions of interactions with police that may either exacerbate\nreactions to police pretext or create a perception of illegitimacy even in\nthe absence of pretextual actions.\nPolice officers enter all of their encounters with citizens expecting that\nthey will be treated with deference (Sykes and Clark, 1975) and that their\ngovernment-backed authority over citizens will be honored (Bittner,\n1970). From the perspective of police, the ability to effectively do their\nwork on a daily basis in ways that routinely fall far short of forceful words\nand deeds depends on deference toward police by citizens and citizen\ncompliance with police requests and demands.\nHowever, encounters between police and citizens of color pose\nproblems that simply are not present during police encounters with whites\nthat may affect citizens' perceptions regardless of actual police behavior.\nBecause most police officers are white (Maguire and Pastore, 1997:39),\nAfrican-American and other citizens of color may be reluctant to extend\ndeference and compliance because it risks conflating a white officer's sta-\ntus as a police officer with that officer's position in race and ethnic stratifi-\ncation systems that favor whites (Sykes and Clark, 1975). In addition,\npolice have long brought a far more heavy-handed style of policing to\nminority communities and treated African-American and other citizens of\ncolor in those communities with less respect than citizens in white commu-\ntherefore understandably more inclined to withhold their best and to be\nsuspicious of police motives during encounters with police. Last, the per-\nvasive racism characteristic of United States society (Entman and Rojecki,\nstop encounters more critically than whites even in the face of police\nactions that clearly signal equity, decency, and compassion.\nAccordingly, African-American and Hispanic citizens should be less\nlikely to exit their traffic stop encounters believing police acted legiti-\nmately and properly. Because these problems simply are not present dur-\ning traffic stops involving white drivers, whites should more likely exit\ntheir traffic stop encounters believing police acted legitimately and\nproperly.\nFive important limits surround previous research on Driving While\nBlack. First, because the scholarly study of Driving While Black is rela-\ntively new (cf., Weitzer and Tuch, 2002), only a handful of studies currently\nexists. Second, many data collection efforts are ongoing (Meeks, 2000:7;\nstanding of Driving While Black must therefore wait until the data cur-\nrently being collected are complete and available for scholarly analysis.\nThird, extant research as well as the forthcoming analyses are generally\nlimited to particular police jurisdictions (Lamberth, 1996; Zingraff et al.,\n2000) and therefore provide locally rather than nationally representative\nanswers to questions about Driving While Black. Fourth, existing analyses\nand ongoing data collection usually rely on police-reported traffic stops,\nwith police fully aware of the purpose behind the information gathering\n(Berjarano, 2001). Because police officers know this, some have already\nbeen detected falsifying traffic stop information (Donohue, 2000; Meeks,\non traffic stops and citizen perceptions has not used multivariate tech-\nniques to disentangle the effects of race and ethnicity from other possibly\nimportant explanatory variables such as social class (an important excep-\nThe present research uses Contucts between Police and the Public: Find-\ngrounded exclusively in citizen self-reports of their encounters with police.\nThus, we employ currently available national rather than local data, and\nwe rely on citizen self-reports rather than police reports to examine how\ndriver race and ethnicity affect traffic stops by police, citizens' perceptions\nof the legitimacy of the traffic stop, and citizens' perceptions of the propri-\nety of police actions during the traffic stop encounter. All of our analyses\nare multivariate, controlling for other possibly important predictors.\nMETHODS\nCASES\nContacts between Police and the Public: Findings from the 1999 National\nSurvey (hereafter \"CBPP 1999\") is a nationally representative sample, and\nit was collected as part of the annual National Crime Victimization Survey\nyears of age or older and they first answered a long series of questions\n(31% in person and 69% by telephone) about crime victimization and\nthen a much shorter series of questions lasting 5 to 10minutes about con-\ntacts they had with police in the previous 12 months. Of the 80,543 ran-\ndomly selected subjects, 7,034 (8.7% of the total sample) reported at least\none traffic stop in which they were the driver. Respondents with at least\none traffic stop were then asked additional questions, including their per-\nception of the legitimacy of the stop and their perception of whether\npolice acted properly. When subjects reported more than one traffic stop,\nthey were asked to provide information on the \"most recent occasion\"\nleast one stop.\nWe model three outcomes. The first, Total Traffic Stops,' is a continu-\nous variable and is used to examine traffic stops for Driving While Black.\nThe sample for this analysis uses the full sample ( N = 80,543). The other\ntwo dependent measures direct attention to possible differences between\ndrivers of color and white drivers in their perceptions of police actions\nassociated with the traffic stop. The first, Legitimate Reason for Stop, is\ndichotomous (yes = 1, no and missing = 0) and proxies drivers' perceptions\nof pretextual traffic stops by police (Harris, 2002). The second, Police\nActed Properly, also is dichotomous (yes = 1, no and missing = 0) and is\nused to probe the special problems that accompany traffic stop encounters\nbetween police and citizens of color (Sykes and Clark, 1975). The sample\nfor analyzing these outcomes is limited to cases with at least one traffic\nThe first dependent measure (Total Traffic Stops) is a count of the num-\nber of traffic stops. As is common for such measures, it has a very dispro-\nportionate number of zeros (91.3% of the respondents reported no stops),\nand the remainder of the distribution is also very skewed. In this situation,\nordinary least-squares regression is not the appropriate analytic technique\nWe instead use a negative binomial regression model that is specifically\nintended for analyzing count outcomes. This technique is an extension of\nthe Poisson regression model, which relaxes the Poisson's assumption that\nthe conditional variance of the outcome is equal to the conditional mean\nstop. For 34 of the cases with more than one traffic stop, we know they were stopped\ntwo or more times, but the exact number is not known. In their preliminary analysis.\nLangan et al. (2001; also personal communication from Matthew Durose. April 11,\n2002) replaced these inexact responses with the mode (two stops) of the multistop sub-\nsample. We prefer using the mean (2.83). but because the negative binomial model\nrequires that the outcome be integer counts, we assigned these cases a value of 3. the\ninteger closest to the mean of those with multiple stops. However, we ran our models\nwithout these 34 cases and found exactly parallel results to those we report.\noverdispersion parameter for the negative binomial regressions to deter-\nmine if the negative binomial should be used instead of Poisson regression.\nAs we report for each of the models, the overdispersion parameter esti-\nmate is significantly different from zero, indicating that the negative bino-\nmial is in fact the better data analytic choice.\nThe other two outcomes present model estimation issues as well.\nBecause they are categorical, either logistic regression or probit analysis\nare the techniques of choice (Long, 1997:8-40). In addition, these analy-\nses are subject to a sample selection bias (Heckman, 1979) because these\nperceptual outcomes are observed only for respondents with at least one\ntraffic stop (N = 7,034). We first created a dichotomous traffic stop depen-\ndent measure (at least one stop = 1, no stops = 0) and attempted to use a\nbivariate probit regression model to correct for the selection bias (Greene,\n1997:983). However, the bivariate probit models for both perceptual out-\ncome-dependent measures failed to converge because the estimated error\ncorrelations approached the boundary condition of being perfectly\ncorrelated.\nOur solution was to follow the logic of the sample selection correction\nmethods, which control for a case's likelihood of being selected into the\nrestricted sample (Berk, 1983). In our case, we use logistic regression\n(Kaufman, 1996)and introduce a control for other police contacts (exclud-\ning traffic stops) reported by the respondent. This is a direct measure that\ncontrols for how included respondents differ from each other (and from\nexcluded respondents) in their chance of experiencing face-to-face\nencounters with police and thus of reporting perceptual outcomes.\nOTHER\nPOLICE\nCONTACT\nRespondents who indicated they had experienced a face-to-face contact\nwith a police officer in the previous 12months were asked to describe that\nencounter. Setting aside traffic stops, Other Police Contact represents\nnon-traffic stop encounters with police (at least one other police contact =\n1, no other police contact = 0). As noted, Other Police Contact is included\nas a direct and efficient control for sample selection (Berk, 1983). By\nmeasuring the likelihood of face-to-face encounters with police in other\nsettings, it captures respondents' susceptibility to traffic stops in unmea-\nsured ways.\nSubjects reported where they lived, and CBPP 1999researchers coupled\nthis information with census data to place subjects into one of four catego-\nries. We used these categories to construct three size of place dummy vari-\nWe include size of place in our analyses for three reasons. First, most\ntrips that drivers make take place close to where they live (U.S.Bureau of\nthe Census, 2001:631), so most traffic stops take place where respondents\nlive. Second. police officers serving high-population jurisdictions handle\nmore calls from citizens and consequently have less time for traffic stops\nthan police officers serving lower population jurisdictions (Bayley, 1994).\nThird, police in high-population jurisdictions practice a far more brusque\nand impersonal style of policing (Barker, 1999:36) that should affect per-\nceptions of police actions.\nDRIVER\nSOCIAL\nCLASS\nEconomically advantaged citizens drive more miles each year than less\nadvantaged citizens, putting the former at greater overall risk of being\n2001:631). In addition, limited previous research indicates that police\nreserve formal intervention for citizens who appear to be able to bear the\nfinancial costs of formal police actions while simultaneously being more\ncareful during their encounters with advantaged citizens (Campbell and\nski and Ritti, 1992). Last, social class affects citizen perceptions of police\nand police actions (Weitzer and Tuch, 2002). In sum, this suggests that\nhigher social class drivers may be more likely to be stopped but less likely\nto perceive the stop as illegitimate or improper.\nRespondents self-reported income was placed by CBPP 1999 research-\ners into one of three broad categories from which we constructed two\ndummy indicators of social class: (1) Above Average Income ($50,000 or\n= 0). Below Average Income (less than $20,000 and not answered by\nsubject2) is the reference category.\nDRIVER\nAGE\nYoung drivers are more likely to engage in \"risky driving habits\" and\nthus are more likely to be stopped for traffic law violations (Pfaff-Wright\nand Tomaskovic-Devey, 2002:13; U.S. Department of Transportation,\n~~ ~\n2. In the CBPP 1999 data file, respondents who did not answer the income ques-\ntion are not distinguished from those who report income in the lowest category. so they\nare included in our samples.\n2001).

Further, most police officers are male (Maguire and\nPastore, 1997:40), and male police officers are more reluctant to stop\nfemale drivers for fear of accusations of misconduct (Rubinstein,\n1973:265). This suggests that male officers might make stops of female\ndrivers only in the face of clear evidence of traffic stop law violations. In\naddition, traditional gender role expectations may lead male officers to be\nmore polite in their interaction with female drivers, while female drivers\nmay be more inclined to extend deference to male police officers (Sykes\nour models with a dichotomous dummy variable for Female (1 = female, 0\n= male).\nDRIVER\nAt the core of Driving While Black is the assertion that police target\nAfrican-American and, to a lesser extent, other drivers of color for traffic\nstops (Meeks, 2000). Moreover, some scholars argue that police resort to\npretext to stop drivers of color (Harris, 2002), while still others have noted\nthe special problems that accompany encounters between police and citi-\nzens of color (Sykes and Clark, ,1975). If these assertions are true, then\ncitizens of color should report more traffic stops and be more likely to exit\ntheir traffic stop encounters with police believing that police did not have\na legitimate reason for making the stop and that police did not act\nproperly.\nRespondents indicated whether they considered themselves black, His-\npanic, a member of some other race or ethnic group, or white. We used\nthese self-designations to create three dummy variables: (1) black (yes = 1,\nelse = 0); (2) Hispanic (yes = 1,else = 0); and (3) Other (American Indian,\nAleut, Eskimo, Asian, Pacific Islander, and other = 1, else = 0). Whites\nform the reference category.\nDRIVER\nPrevious research on Driving While Black indicates that police espe-\nand gender may be important. We explore this issue using dummy indica-\ntors for seven race/ethnicity by gender groupings: (1) Black Female: (2)\nBlack Male; (3) Hispanic Female; (4) Hispanic Male; (5) Other Female;\n(6) Other Male; and (7) White Female. We use White Male as the refer-\nence category. We then use these variables to estimate two models for\neach outcome: (1) a \"main effects\" model including the three dummy\nindicators of race/ethnicity plus the dummy indicator of gender; (2) an\n\"interaction effects\" model in which we replace the \"main effect\" terms\nfor gender and race/ethnicity with the seven dummy indicators of race/\nethnicity by gender.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents the results from the negative binomial regressions for\ntotal number of traffic stops. In both models, the effects are consistent\nand expected. Starting with the predictors other than race and ethnicity,\nOther Police Contact has a significant positive effect on the number of\ntraffic stops, verifying that this selectivity measure (Berk, 1983) captures\nhow respondents differ in their chances of experiencing traffic stops. The\nexpected number of stops declines across each contrast of larger to smaller\npopulation size, which corresponds to the argument that police have less\ntime for traffic stops in higher population jurisdictions (Bayley, 1994).\nAffluent drivers are stopped more often by police, consistent with both\ntheir higher driving mileage (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2001:631) and\nwith previous research (Campbell and Ross, 1968; Kinkade and Leone,\n1992). And, consistent with risky driving habits rooted firmly in age and\ngender (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2001), young drivers are\nstopped significantly more often, while female drivers are stopped signifi-\ncantly less often. The latter likewise follows from arguments that male\npolice officers are more reluctant to stop female drivers (Rubinstein,\nModel 1 in Table 1 also provides a first look at the effects of driver race/\nethnicity. Black drivers report significantly more traffic stops than do\nwhite drivers. In contrast, Hispanic and other drivers report significantly\nfewer traffic stops by police. Model 2 in Table 1 shows that the race/\nethnicity by gender effects are important as well (Harris, 2002; also see\nsignificant (20.88 with 3 df), indicating that the race/ethnicity by gender\ninteractions are needed. Specifically, model 2 shows that African-Ameri-\ncan men report more stops than do white men. All of the other race/\nethnicity-gender group predictors in model 2, however, are negative and\nsignificant, indicating that these groups have fewer stops than white men.\nTable 1.

Within race/ethnicity groups, men report a higher\nnumber of stops than do women.

The Legitimate Reason for\nStop outcome partially probes this argument using drivers' perceptions of\nthe legitimacy of the traffic stop they experienced. Both models in Table 2\nsupport this argument. Model 1 shows that African Americans and His-\npanics are significantly less likely to think that police had a legitimate rea-\nson for stopping them. At the same time, the difference between others\nand whites is negative but not significant, and women are more likely than\nmen to report that the stop was legitimate (Sykes and Clark,\nModel 2 shows a slightly more complex pattern when we consider the\ninteraction between race/ethnicity and gender. Within race/ethnicity,\nthere is a consistent effect of gender. Men are less likely to believe that\nthe stop was legitimate than are women. Within gender, the effects of\nrace/ethnicity are slightly different. Among men, African-American men\nare the least likely to think that the stop was legitimate, followed by His-\npanics and then others, with white men the most likely to perceive legiti-\nmacy. Among women, the ordering is the same, except for Hispanic\nwomen. Hispanic women are the most likely to accept the legitimacy of\nthe stop.\nTurning to the other sets of predictors, all but age have significant\neffects. Drivers with at least one other police contact are significantly less\nlikely to report that police had a legitimate reason for making a traffic\nstop. This indicates that stopped drivers are not representative of the ini-\ntial sample (Greene, 1997:983) and demonstrates the importance of con-\ntrolling for sample selection. Drivers in larger places are less likely than\nthose in smaller places to report a legitimate reason for their traffic stop,\nsuggesting that police in higher population jurisdictions do practice a more\nbrusque and impersonal style of policing (Barker, 199936). Finally, driv-\ners with above average and average incomes are significantly more likely\nto report a legitimate reason for their stop, consistent with the argument\nthat police are more careful in their actions when citizens are affluent\nPrevious research (Sykes and Clark, 1975) suggests that special\nproblems are associated with encounters between police and citizens of\ncolor. Models 3 and 4 in Table 2 show that is indeed the case. In the\nadditive race/ethnicity and gender effects model, African-American and\nHispanic drivers are significantly less likely than Whites to report that the\npolice acted properly, and women are more likely than men to report that\npolice acted properly. As was the case for the pretextual outcome, the\ninteraction between gender and race/ethnicity is more complex. Within\ngender, African Americans are the least likely to believe that police acted\nproperly and whites are the most likely to think so. Hispanics and others\nfall in the middle but in opposite orders for men and women. Within race/\nethnicity, the gender effect is the same with women more likely than men\nto believe that the police acted properly, except for those of other race/\nethnicity for whom the gender difference reverses but is not significant.\nTable 2.

Driv-\ners in the biggest city places, for instance, are significantly less likely to\nreport proper police actions (Barker, 1999:36). Similarly, drivers with\nabove average and average incomes are significantly more likely to report\nthat police acted properly (Mastrofski and Ritti, 1992). And the selectivity\ncontrol has a significant negative effect, suggesting that non-traffic contact\nwith police is associated with a more negative perception of police actions.\nThe analyses in Table 2 confirm that there is more to Driving While\nBlack than being targeted for traffic stops by police. African-American\nand Hispanic drivers are more likely to report that police did not have a\nlegitimate reason to stop them, thereby suggesting more frequent police\nrecourse to pretext when stopping drivers of color (Harris, 2002). African-\nAmerican and Hispanic drivers also are less likely to report that police\nacted properly, confirming prior research that special problems arise dur-\ning encounters between police and citizens of color (Sykes and Clark,\n1975). The broad pattern that emerges, however, is one in which African\nAmericans and whites have starkly different perceptions of police actions.\nDISCUSSION\nOur results are clear. Based on citizen self-reports, police are signifi-\ncantly more likely to stop African-American male drivers and there is a\nsimilar patterning of stops by race/ethnicity for both men and women.\nFurther, African-American and Hispanic drivers are significantly less\nlikely to report that police had a legitimate reason for making the stop and\nsignificantly less likely to report that police acted properly. And, although\nthe reactions of Hispanics and others vary somewhat by gender, beliefs in\nthe legitimacy and propriety of police actions are framed by a polarity\nbetween blacks and whites.\nThe implications of these patterns are troubling, regardless of whether\nthey result from differential treatment of drivers of color by the police,\nfrom differential perceptions of and reactions to police by citizens of color,\nor, perhaps most likely, from both. It is one thing when ordinary white\ncitizens use race and ethnicity to shape their daily activities, resort to pre-\ntext as the basis for their actions, and leave unattended the special\nproblems associated with encounters between themselves and citizens of\nreport that many police, most of whom also are white (Maguire and Pas-\ntore, 1997:39),use race to shape their daily work, resort to pretext, and fail\nto defuse their encounters with citizens of color. Police are not ordinary\ncitizens but instead are powerful actors who are always situationally cor-\nrect (Bittner, 1970). In the context of traffic stops, police are actors who\nare able to stop citizens from driving without their consent, even if the\nreason for the stop is pretextual. Police are also actors who are able to\nprevent citizens from resuming their driving unless and until the police\nofficer who made the stop gives permission, even if the officer is not acting\nproperly. Because they are enormously powerful and always situationally\ncorrect, police are expected to be commonweal actors (Blau and Scott,\nresults of the present research suggest that many police nationally may be\nignoring their commonweal obligations by acting just like ordinary citizens\nor, alternatively. are unable or unwilling to defuse and counter the suspi-\ncion with which police actions are viewed by many drivers of color.\nThe CBPP 1999consists of nothing more nor less than citizen answers to\nsurvey questions. Moreover, because it has a large and nationally repre-\nsentative sample, other scholars almost certainly will turn to it, to subse-\nquent CBPP surveys, and to other citizen self-report data to analyze police\nand policing (Pfaff-Wright and Tomaskovic-Devey, 2000; Weitzer and\nTuch, 2002). In contrast, most existing research on police has been\ngrounded in data collected by trained observers (for reviews, see Riksheim\nrounding the present research and other analyses using citizen self-report\ndata revolves around a very simple question. Are citizen self-reports of\ntheir encounters with police valid? The remainder of this section\naddresses this issue, starting with the case for validity and continuing with\nwhether validity is in fact a pivotal issue. It also includes an agenda for\nfuture research and the need for triangulation.\nIt is useful to begin discussion of citizen self-reports by noting that there\nis nothing unusual about scholars using data from citizens in their analyses\nof crime, criminals, and criminal justice (see Farrington et al., 1996; Gras-\nmick et al., 1993). Uniform Crime Reports data, for example, rest funda-\nmentally on self-reports by citizens because it is their calls that alert police\nthat an index crime has been committed. By their calls, citizens therefore\nmake index crimes visible and make arrests for both index and nonindex\ncrimes possible (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2000:iv). In victimiza-\ntion surveys, citizens report whether they experienced a criminal victimiza-\ntion, indicate whether they reported that victimization to police, and, for\nvictims of crimes against persons, describe the people who committed the\ncrimes they experienced (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2001). Similarly, in\nself-report studies of criminal offenders, subjects describe their own\ninvolvement in particular crimes, including traffic law violations and\nwhether they were arrested or ticketed by police (Bachman et al., 2001).\nWhen viewed through these lenses, using citizen self-reports of their\nencounters with police simply extends a long-standing scholarly practice of\nusing data from citizens on crime, criminals, and criminal justice.\nIn addition, no matter whether data are drawn from Uniform Crime\nReports, victimization surveys, or self-report studies (Bachman et al., 2001:\nthe images citizens advance converge on common substance. With respect\nto crime, for instance, citizens consistently report that most crime is\nnonindex crime and that most index crime is property crime, especially\nlarceny theft.\nMoreover, the results from our analyses of citizens' self-reports of polic-\ning mesh with the manners and customs of police (Black, 1980) that schol-\nars have observed on three important dimensions. First, police are legal\nactors sensitive to legal factors (Barker, 1999). Because traffic law viola-\ntions are more common among young drivers and male drivers (US.\nDepartment of Transportation, 2001), traffic stops should disproportion-\nately involve young drivers and men. Second, past research indicates that\npolice in high-population jurisdictions make fewer traffic stops (Bayley,\n1994) and practice a far more brusque and impersonal style of policing\nthat should logically increase the odds of citizen dissatisfaction with police\nactions (Barker, 1999:36). Third, police have long been more careful with\neconomically privileged citizens (Chambliss and Liell, 1966), making cer-\ntain they have clearer grounds for intervention and being more careful in\ntheir interaction with people who have platform and voice (Mastrofski and\nRitti, 1992). Our results precisely parallel the results of past studies of\npolice and policing: (1) young and male drivers report more stops; (2) driv-\ners in higher population areas report fewer stops and are more likely to\nreport dissatisfaction with police: and (3) drivers are more likely to report\nsatisfaction with police if they are economically privileged.\nUnderreporting by African Americans. The literature teaches that Afri-\ncan Americans are more likely to underreport official trouble with the law\nthan are whites (Sudman and Bradburn. 1982), including traffic stops\ndata are typical. Among North Carolina drivers known to have been\nstopped by police for speeding, three-quarters of whites admitted to being\nstopped as compared to two-thirds of African Americans.\nSuch patterns of underreporting may have an important implication for\nthe present research. If these findings do in fact apply to the CBPP 1999\ndata, then the significantly higher rates of traffic stops self-reported by\nAfrican-American men are even more robust than they appear. However,\nthere is no certainty that this pattern applies to the data we examined\nbecause not all analyses of self-report data reveal differences between\nwhites and African Americans (Farrington et al., 1996).\nThe present research, however, does not exclusively rise or fall on the\nvalidity of citizen self-reports. Instead, it is possible to argue that validity\nis simply not a pivotal issue and still make a strong case that the results of\nthe present research are profoundly consequential.\nMore than 70 years ago, sociologists W. I. Thomas and Dorothy Swaine\nThomas (1928572) taught scholars: \"[ilf . . . [people] . . . define situations\nas real, then they are real in their consequences.\" More recently, Weitzer\nand Tuch (2002:436) applied the same argument to citizen reports of traffic\nstops: \"Citizen perceptions of police stops may be considered just as\nimportant as the objective reality of such stops. Stops perceived as racially\nmotivated may increase the frequency of confrontations between police\nand motorists and generate distrust of the police among those who are\nstopped.\"\nWhen the CBPP 1999 data used in the present research are examined in\nlight of these important scholarly lessons, validity emerges as a less pivotal\nissue than otherwise would appear to be the case. Consider first how the\nrespondents of color in our analyses define their traffic stop encounters\nwith police: (1) African-American men are targeted for traffic stops by\npolice; (2) traffic stops of African-American and Hispanic drivers are\nmore likely to be grounded in pretext; and (3) police fail to defuse the\nspecial problems associated with their encounters with African-American\nand Hispanic drivers.\nConsider next the consequences of these situational definitions. These\ndefinitions link the long history of police control and oppression of Afri-\ncan Americans in southern and northern cities (Websdale, 2001) with per-\nceptions of contemporary police control and oppression of African-\nAmerican and Hispanic drivers on state and local highways and streets\n(Meeks, 2000). These situational definitions reinforce and reflect African\nAmericans' and Hispanics' deeply held beliefs that police have two styles\nof policing, one much less legitimate and proper for them and another\nmuch more legitimate and proper for whites (Anderson, 1999;Weitzer and\nTuch, 2002). These definitions mean African-American and Hispanic\nadults warn teenage children not just about the dangers of driving while\nyoung (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2001), but also about the spe-\nAnd these definitions mean that our cities remain, as the Kerner Commis-\nsion (1968:~)warned more than 30 years ago, tinder boxes waiting to\nignite during the next traffic stop encounter between police and a driver of\nExtant research on Driving While Black is extremely limited (for a\nreview, see Harris, 2002), and very few studies have used multivariate\nanalyses (an important exception is Weitzer and Tuch, 2002). With only a\nlimited number of carefully crafted analyses, researchers have no firm\nsense of the consistent patterns in the mosaic (Becker, 1966:viii) of schol-\narly understandings of Driving While Black.\nThe most pressing need, accordingly, is additional research on the fac-\ntors affecting traffic stops by police. Social science scholars are currently\nserving as consultants to law enforcement organizations and helping to\ncollect police-reported data on traffic stops (cf., Portland Police Bureau,\n2000). Considerable data will therefore become available for analysis in\nthe relatively near future, and scholars have already shown the usefulness\nof police-reported data (Zingraff et al., 2000).\nHowever, as is the case with citizen-reported data (Pfaff-Wright and\nTomoskovic-Devey. 2000), police-reported data raise questions about\nvalidity. In particular, it is easy for police to distort the traffic stop data\nthey report, and some officers have already been detected doing precisely\nceptions of the legitimacy of traffic stops nor citizen perceptions of the\npropriety of police actions. It would therefore be a mistake for scholars to\nbase their understandings of Driving While Black exclusively on the exten-\nsive police-reported data that will soon become available.\nTRIANGIJLATED\ntwo additional types of data. The present research used one of those com-\nplementary data sources-citizen self-reports (also see Pfaff-Wright and\nmentary data source is to train the observers who collected so much of the\nscholarly data on police and policing in the past (for reviews, see Riksheim\nethnicity of the many traffic law violators whom police witness but choose\nto leave alone and the demeanor of police, not just citizens (Klinger,\n1994), during their encounters with drivers whom they do stop.\nAn agenda for future research is therefore clear. Scholars should con-\ntinue to collect police-reported data on traffic stops (cf., Zingraff et al.,\n2000) and to collect and examine citizen reports of traffic stops (Pfaff-\nalso must expand the training of observers of police to include coding not\njust traffic stops and the actions and demeanor of police and drivers during\nstops, but also the race and ethnicity of traffic law violators observed by\npolice but left alone. And, with these triangulated data in hand, research-\ners can then explore the similarities and isolate and explain the differences\nthat arise from using police-reported, citizen-reported. and observer-\nreported data to describe and explain the phenomenon of Driving While\nBlack.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present research supports five conclusions. First, citizens report\nthat police nationally make traffic stops more frequently of African-Amer-\nican male drivers. More broadly, for both women and men, there is an\nidentical pattern of stops by race/ethnicity. Second, African-American\ndrivers (both men and women) as well as Hispanic male drivers are signifi-\ncantly less likely than white men to report that police had a legitimate\nreason for making the traffic stop, thereby suggesting either police\nrecourse to pretext when stopping drivers of color or varying situational\ndefinitions between whites and citizens of color, or both. Third, African-\nAmerican men and Hispanic men are significantly less likely than white\nmen to report that police acted properly during the traffic stop encounter\n(as are African-Americanwomen compared with white women), thus rein-\nforcing the existence of special problems associated with encounters\nbetween police and citizens of color. Fourth, although the reactions of\nHispanics and others vary somewhat by gender, beliefs in the legitimacy\nand propriety of police actions are framed by a stark polarity between\nAfrican Americans and whites. Most importantly, there is a pressing need\nand ample scholarly room for additional research on Driving While Black\nusing triangulated police-reported, citizen-reported, and observer-\nreported data.\nREFERENCES\nAnderson, Elijah\n1999 Code of the Street: Decency, Violence, and the Moral Life of the Inner\nCity.
