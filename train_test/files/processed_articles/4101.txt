Several key findings\nemerged from the analysis of the seven human trafficking\ncases. These findings reveal insights into human trafficking\nperpetrators and human trafficking operations. They include\n(a) the outcome of a federal criminal case of forced labor in\nwhich a new anti-trafficking statute was used, and the out-\ncome of a civil suit involving the same case; (b) an analysis\nof the online prostitution advertisements, including how vic-\ntims were marketed to sex buyers using their ethnicity and\nhow sex buyers of certain ages and class standing were\nattracted by the advertisements; and (c) how victims' moth-\ners were involved in finding their daughters and making\nreports to the police that resulted in the arrests of the traffick-\ners. This later finding introduces a previously undocumented\nphenomenon that calls for more research.\nMethod\nThe federal and state anti-human trafficking laws provide\ndefinitions of human trafficking that can be used for research\nas well as prosecution of traffickers. For many years,\nresearchers had to rely on their own definitions of trafficking\nor make their own evaluations about whether the research\npopulations met the criteria of human trafficking victims or\nperpetrators. This analysis relies on legal definitions of\nhuman trafficking and law enforcement identified cases.\nDefinition of Crimes in Cases in This Analysis\nThe cases used in this analysis are based on violations of fed-\neral and state anti-human trafficking and trafficking-related\nlaws. The federal anti-human trafficking law, the Trafficking\nVictims Protection Act of 2000, defines a severe form of\nhuman trafficking as the recruitment, harboring, transporta-\ntion, provision, or obtaining of a person for one of three pur-\nposes: (a) labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or\ncoercion for the purposes of subjection to involuntary servi-\ntude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery; (b) a commercial sex\nact, through use of force, fraud, or coercion; or (c) a commer-\ncial sex act if the person is under 18 years of age (Trafficking\n1Rhode Island College, Providence, USA\n2University of Rhode Island, Kingston, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDonna M.

The federal statute used in\nTrafficking of a Child or by Force, Fraud or Coercion.\nAnother federal law that is closely related to the anti-traf-\nficking law that is frequently used in federal prosecutions,\nbut does not require proof of force, fraud, or coercion, is a\nTransportation for Illegal Sexual Activity and Related\nCrimes) is defined as knowingly transporting a person for the\npurpose of prostitution or any illegal sexual activity.\nThe third federal charge in the cases used in this analysis is\nFraud in Foreign Contracting (18 U.S.C. 1351). It is defined\nas knowingly recruiting, soliciting, or hiring a person outside\nthe United States for purposes of employment in the United\nStates by means of false pretenses or promises or fraud.\nAfter the new federal law defined human trafficking\npassed in 2000, states in the United States followed with state\nanti-human trafficking laws that closely followed the federal\ndefinition of human trafficking. In 2009, Rhode Island passed\na comprehensive human trafficking law: An Act Relating to\nCriminal Offenses (2009). It defined trafficking as whoever\nknowingly subjects, attempts to subject, or engages in a con-\nspiracy to subject another person for forced labor or commer-\ncial sexual activity using the following means: (a) causing or\nthreatening to cause physical harm to any person; (b) physi-\ncally restraining or threatening to physically restrain another\nperson; (c) abusing or threatening to abuse the law or legal\nprocess; (d) knowingly destroying, concealing, removing,\nconfiscating, or possessing without that person's consent any\nactual or purported passport or other immigration document,\nor any other actual or purported government identification\ndocument, of another person; or (e) by using intimidation (An\nAct Relating to Criminal Offenses, 2009).\nThe state cases of sex trafficking used in this analysis\ninvolve two statutes: Trafficking of Persons for Forced Labor\nor Commercial Sexual Activity (RI 11-67-3) and Sex\nWith established legal definitions and the prosecution of\nhuman trafficking cases, research can be done on precisely\ndefined victims, traffickers, and trafficking operations.\nSources of Data for This Analysis\nA recent report (Surtees, 2014) evaluating the status of\nresearch on human trafficking criticized the state of empiri-\ncal knowledge about human trafficking. It claimed that what\nwas known about the perpetrators and the human trafficking\noperations was \"rudimentary, fragmentary and relatively\nmeager.\" The report attributed this deficiency to many\nresearchers relying on victim interviews, and using their\naccounts to characterize human trafficking. The report rec-\nommends looking for sources beyond victim interviews. In\nparticular, the report calls for more research on human traf-\nficking operations (Surtees, 2014). This analysis of human\ntrafficking uses sources other than victims.\nThis article analyzes law enforcement identified human\ntrafficking cases in Rhode Island based on police and court\nrecords, prosecutors' press releases, and reports in the\nmedia. The cases are law enforcement confirmed human\ntrafficking case which are cases in which an arrest was\nmade, and the offender charged with one of the offenses\nlisted in the previous section.\nResearchers identified cases of human trafficking in Rhode\nIsland by searching in several places, including annual reports\nfrom the websites of the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Rhode\nIsland Attorney General's Office, local news media archives\nand websites for newspaper articles, and videos related to\narrests, convictions, and sentencing of human traffickers. The\nresearchers verified the cases with the Rhode Island Attorney\nGeneral's Office and the U.S. Attorney's office.\nThe following primary documents were retrieved from\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island and\nthe Superior Court of Rhode Island: statements by police\nofficers and witnesses about human trafficking crimes,\nindictments, plea agreements, and sentencing memoranda.\nIn addition, press releases from the Rhode Island Attorney\nGeneral's Office and the U.S. Attorney's Office were col-\nlected. Statements in the press releases often added impor-\ntant information about the cases, such as historic precedents\nof the cases and the nature of the crimes. Media sources from\nnewspapers, TV news, and blogs were used when they sup-\nplemented the information from the primary sources.\nSometimes media sources were used as a reference when the\ninformation was not available in official documents. An\nexample of that kind of information is a quote made by law\nenforcement at a news conference about an arrest.\nInformation from multiple sources was combined to cre-\nate a detailed description of each case. Aspects of the cases\nwere compared and analyzed to find differences and simi-\nlarities among the cases. The findings from the Rhode Island\ncases were then compared with national statistics on human\ntrafficking cases. Several key findings from the cases are\ndiscussed in detail.\nGeneral Characteristics of the Human\nTrafficking Cases in Rhode Island\nhuman trafficking in Rhode Island. During this period, there\nwas one case of forced labor and six cases of sex trafficking.\nIn many ways, the Rhode Island cases are similar to other\nhuman trafficking cases in the United States. In the words of\nAmbassador-at-Large Luis CdeBaca, of the U.S. State\nDepartment's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in\nPersons: \"The Rhode Island cases are symbolic of modern\nslavery\" (Mulvaney, 2011c).According to data from federally\nsuspected incidents of human trafficking were sex trafficking,\nand 10% of incidents were forced labor (Banks & Kyckelhahn,\n2011). The Rhode Island human trafficking cases followed\nSkodmin et al. 3\nthe same pattern, with six of the seven cases being sex traf-\nficking and one case being forced labor.\nThe one case of forced labor was a case of domestic ser-\nvitude. The perpetrator was a foreign national from the\nUnited Arab Emirates. The victim was a foreign national\nfrom the Philippines. The U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted\nthis case. Following the criminal case, the victim filed a civil\nsuit against the trafficker.\nCases of Domestic Sex Trafficking\nAll of the sex trafficking cases were domestic trafficking\ncases, meaning the victims were U.S. citizens, and they were\nnot transported across international borders. This pattern of\nvictims of sex trafficking being U.S. citizens is consistent\nwith the findings of the Department of Justice study that\nfound that 83% of victims of sex trafficking were U.S. citi-\nzens (Banks & Kyckelhahn, 2011). Furthermore, two of the\ncases were Rhode Island domestic trafficking cases, meaning\nboth the trafficker and the victims were from Rhode Island\nand the victims were exploited in prostitution in the small\nstate of Rhode Island.\nMost of the sex trafficking cases involved interstate trans-\nportation of victims. In four of the six cases, traffickers\nbrought the victims to Rhode Island from Massachusetts,\nNew York, or Indiana. In one case of interstate transporta-\ntion, two traffickers from New York stated that they brought\nvictims to Rhode Island because of the lack of a law against\nprostitution (Milkovits, 2010c). In one sex trafficking case, a\nmale trafficker traveled with the victims to Rhode Island,\nwhile his female partner remained in Indiana and organized\nthe advertising of the victims online (Neronha, 2010b).\nVictims of Sex Trafficking\nA number of the sex trafficking cases involved interstate\ntransportation of victims. Two of the six cases of sex traffick-\ning involved traffickers bringing minor girls from\nMassachusetts to Rhode Island. Law enforcement personnel,\nservice providers, and researchers have known for a long\ntime that women and girls are trafficked from Massachusetts\nto Rhode Island. Rhode Island strip clubs and other adult\nentertainment businesses were attractive places for traffick-\ners to offer their victims to sex buyers because there was no\nlaw against indoor prostitution and no enforcement of exist-\ning sex trafficking laws in Rhode Island before 2009.\nIn the six cases of sex trafficking, there were eight perpe-\ntrators and 11 victims identified in the cases. Of the 11 vic-\ntims of sex trafficking, all were women or teen girls. There\nwas a wide age range among the victims. Six of the victims\nwere minors (under the age of 18) and five of the victims\nwere adults (age 18 or older). The youngest victim was 14\nyears old. The oldest victim was 45.\nMany service providers, law enforcement personnel, and\nresearchers have recognized that runaways are frequently\nexploited by sex traffickers (Kotrla, 2010; Shared Hope\nInternational, 2009). The Rhode Island cases of sex traffick-\ning fit this pattern. Five out of the six minor victims of sex\ntrafficking were reported missing by their families or had run\naway from group homes. In May 2014, the Rhode Island\nAttorney General's Office said that it had a dozen active\ncases and was investigating another dozen. An agency that\nprovides services to victims of trafficking said that it was\nassisting20traffickingvictims.TheRhodeIslandDepartment\nof Children, Youth and Families said that in the last year\nthem by investigators (Milkovits, 2014c).\nThe targeting of minor girls, especially girls in the child\nwelfare system, by traffickers is widely recognized in Rhode\nIsland by social workers and professionals in the juvenile\njustice system. In 2013, the Family Court of Rhode Island\nheld a conference on sex trafficking of minors titled\n\"Trafficking, Trauma and Exploitation of Children in the\nChild Welfare System.\"\nSome of the sex trafficking cases likely involved addi-\ntional perpetrators and victims who were not included in the\nofficial files.According to police records, in one state domes-\ntic trafficking case, \"detectives have learned that [the accused\ntrafficker] may have had six or seven young women or teens\nworking for her, including another 14-year-old and a 16-year-\nold girl\" (Milkovits, 2014c). In one federal interstate trans-\nportation case, the traffickers had two or three additional\nwomen working for them in and around the state of Indiana\nSex Traffickers\nRhode Island sex trafficking cases were consistent with the\nnational findings on whether traffickers worked alone or\nwith a team. Of the eight sex traffickers involved in the six\ncases, six of them were men, and two were women. Two\ncases involved a team of two perpetrators. One of those cases\ninvolved two men working together, another case involved a\nman and a woman team. According to the data from federally\nfunded task forces, 63% of incidents of sex trafficking\ninvolved only one suspect, while 32% of incidents involved\ntwo to five suspects (Kyckelhahn, Beck, & Cohen, 2009).\nProsecution of Sex Trafficking Cases\nMost of the cases of sex trafficking were prosecuted by the\nstate Attorney General's Office. Of the six sex trafficking\ncases, four of them were state cases prosecuted by the Rhode\nIsland Attorney General's Office, and two of them were fed-\neral cases prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office. This dis-\ntribution of human trafficking cases between federal and\nstate agencies is consistent with the findings of the\nDepartment of Justice, which found that state agencies are\nmore likely to prosecute sex trafficking cases than federal\nagencies and federal agencies are more likely to prosecute\n4 SAGE Open\nforced labor cases (Banks & Kyckelhahn, 2011). In Rhode\nIsland, although more of the sex trafficking cases have been\nprosecuted by the RI Attorney General, the U.S. Attorney's\noffice has been active in cooperating with local and state law\nenforcement on investigating sex trafficking cases. Most of\nthe cases of human trafficking resulted in convictions. After\nprosecutions, seven of the eight sex traffickers were found\nguilty, and one case is still pending.\nInvolvement of Sex Buyers in Sex Trafficking Cases\nThere were no sex buyers arrested in connection to any of the\nsex trafficking cases. In one case involving a 14-year-old\ngirl, the trafficker had sold the teen 45 to 50 times over a 30-\nto 45-day period (Rosciti, 2013a). When a reporter asked the\nofficer in charge of the investigative services division if they\nwere going to investigate the men who purchased sex from a\n14-year-old victim, he replied that they \"were more con-\ncerned about the trafficker than the actions of the men\ninvolved\" (Angers & Campbell, 2013). This comment raises\nconcern about law enforcement personnel's lack of interest\nin holding sex buyers accountable, as well as their lack of\nawareness of the harm that sex buyers do to victims.\nOverall, the general pattern and characteristics of the first\nhuman trafficking cases identified in Rhode Island were con-\nsistent with findings of other human trafficking cases around\nthe United States.\nIn the next sections, some of the key findings of the seven\nhuman trafficking cases will be discussed. Information that\nemerged from the analysis of the cases resulted in some\ninsightful new findings about human trafficking and will\npoint to new areas of research.\nSuccessful Civil Suit in Forced Labor Case\nidentified forced labor human trafficking case in Rhode\nIsland. It was the first case of forced labor prosecuted in\nRhode Island in modern history. The actions included a fed-\nerally prosecuted criminal case and later a civil suit filed\nagainst the accused trafficker by the victim. The Federal\ncriminal case and the civil suit had different outcomes.\nThis forced labor case was the second time that the crime\nwas used as it became an actionable offense with the passage\nof the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization\nAct of 2008 (The William Wilberforce Act). The first suc-\ncessful prosecution using this federal law was in 2010, when\nmultiple defendants were found guilty of a racketeering\nenterprise, involving forced labor and fraud in foreign labor\ncontracting in Missouri. In this case, foreign workers were\nrecruited under false pretenses and forced to work under\nthreat doing housekeeping in hotels (U.S. Department of\nJustice, Civil Rights Division, 2010; U.S. Department of\nIn the Rhode Island case, criminal charges were filed by\nthe U.S. Attorney's Office in 2011 (United States of America\nv. Arif Mohamed Saeed Mohamed Al-Ali, 2011a). The\naccused trafficker was a 46-year-old military officer from the\nUnited Arab Emirates, who was attending a program at the\nNaval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, on a student\nThe accused trafficker brought the Filipina victim to the\nUnited States under a contract that she would care for his\n5-year-old son. The domestic worker was supposed to work\n2011). Instead, the accused trafficker forced her to work an\naverage of 119 hr per week. He and his wife required the\nvictim to maintain a five-bedroom, three-story home, as well\nas care for the accused trafficker's five children, cook three\nmeals a day for the family, clean the house, launder and iron\nall of the family's clothes, take out the trash, wash the cars,\nand clean the garage and yard (Ballesteros, 2011).\nThe accused trafficker and his wife would not allow the\nvictim to leave the house unless she was accompanied by\nsomeone in the family. He seized her passport and told her\nnot to run away because with the support of the U.S Navy he\nwould find her (Ballesteros, 2011). While living in the United\nStates, the accused trafficker was making US$32,000 a\nmonth (Mulvaney, 2011e). For the first 2\u00bd months of work\nthat the victim did, the trafficker sent a total of US$410.00 to\nher family in the Philippines as compensation for her labor\nBefore the criminal trial began, the man and his family\ntried to flee the country. They were removed from a plane at\nJFK Airport by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement.\nHis wife and children were allowed to leave the country. The\nwear a GPS tracker until he stood trial (Minute Entry, 2011a;\nThe alleged trafficker elected to have a bench trial, mean-\ning that the judge ruled on the case and not a jury. In the\ncriminal trial, there were complications resulting from poor\ntranslation of the victim's testimony. The judge dismissed\nthe victim's original testimony because the court interpreter\nused a different dialect than the witness and she admitted to\nnot translating the victim's testimony verbatim (Minute\ntestimony led to confusion and conflict between the prosecu-\ntor and the defense about whether the victim should be\nallowed to testify again. Ultimately, the judge ruled that the\nvictim could testify again.\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the judge decided to put more\ncredence in the defendant's version of events based on his\n30-year career in the Navy of the United Arab Emirates and the\nprestige of his position at the U.S. Naval War College (Lisi,\n2011).Thejudgedeclaredthatthevictim'stestimony\"...doesn't\nhave a ring of truth,\" and ruled that the accused trafficker was not\nArif Mohamed Saeed Mohamed Al-Ali, 2011b).\nSkodmin et al. 5\nLater, the victim, with the support of the Asian American\nLegal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), filed a civil\nsuit against the trafficker (Elizabeth Cabitla Ballesteros v.\nArif Mohamed Saeed Mohamed Al-Ali and Samah\nAlharmoodi, 2011; I. Suriyopas, personal communication,\nApril 1, 2015). Three of the charges for violation of civil\nrights were related to crimes of trafficking; they are forced\nlabor, trafficking with respect to peonage, slavery, involun-\ntary servitude, or forced labor, and involuntary servitude\nA representative of the AALDEF's Anti-Trafficking\nInitiative stated, \"Our client was a recent immigrant with little\nknowledge of her rights\" (Administrator, 2011). The trafficker\ntook advantage of the victim's unfamiliarity with employment\nlaws and customs of the United States and used it as a means\nto maintain control over the victim and exploit her labor.\nThe civil suit judge made a different judgment about the\ncredibility of the victim's testimony than the Federal judge.\nHe recognized the control the trafficker had over the victim\nand the harm done to her. A representative of the AALDEF's\nAnti-Trafficking Initiative said,\nMs. Ballesteros finally had the opportunity to give unfettered\ntestimony in a court of law. The judge said that the victim suffered\n\"outrageous, illegal, and inhumane conduct\" at the hands of the\ndefendant. Her experience as an immigrant domestic worker is\nall too common, and we are committed to helping her recover\nIn contrast to the criminal court judge, who did not believe\nthe victim was credible, the civil court judge did believe she\nwas credible. The civil suit judge stated,\nThis court, after hearing [the victim's] testimony, and observing\nher demeanor on the witness stand, determines that [the victim]\nwas a highly credible witness . . . her testimony about the\nconditions of her employment and her treatment at the hands of\nthe accused trafficker was compelling and believable. (Elizabeth\nCabitla Ballesteros v. Arif Mohamed Saeed Mohamed Al-Ali and\nThe accused trafficker was ordered to pay the victim 1.2\nmillion dollars in civil damages (Elizabeth Cabitla Ballesteros\nv. Arif Mohamed Saeed Mohamed Al-Ali and Samah\nAlharmoodi, 2012). According to the AALDEF's representa-\ntive, as of spring 2015, the accused trafficker has not paid the\nvictim any of the 1.2 million dollars in damages. He fled the\ncountry and left behind no assets that could be confiscated (I.\nSuriyopas, personal communication, April 1, 2015).\nTo date, there have been no summary reports about civil\nsuits for human trafficking in the United States. A recent\nreport by Levy and Vandenberg (2014) described the \"fail-\nure\" of criminal cases to obtain legally required restitution,\nalthough forced labor cases were more successful than sex\nthat restitution was awarded in just 36% of the cases, and the\namounts awarded were called \"paltry\" (Levy & Vandenberg,\n2014). It is not known how much of the court ordered restitu-\ntion is actually paid to the victims.\nAt this point, the outcomes of the criminal and civil cases\non forced labor human trafficking in Rhode Island cannot be\nput in a national context. However, the difference in findings\nin the criminal case and the civil suit point to areas of interest\nfor future research.\nThe First Case of Sex Trafficking\nIn 2010, one year after the passage of the Rhode Island\nhuman trafficking law, the first State case of human traffick-\ning was identified. Two 23-year-old men from Yonkers, New\nYork, were charged using the 2009 human trafficking law\n(Rhode Island Code \u00a7 11-67-3; State of Rhode Island v.\nJoseph Defeis, 2011b; State of Rhode Island v. Andy\nThe men brought women from their home neighborhood\nin Yonkers, New York, to Rhode Island in 2008 because, at\nthat time, there was no law against indoor prostitution\n(Kilmartin, 2011). They pretended to be \"gangsters\" by giv-\ning themselves the street nicknames of \"Kash\" and \"Jemz,\"\nand made rap music videos of themselves driving around\nProvidence in a black SUV, flashing fistfuls of US$100 bills.\nIn one video, they filmed a woman dancing on a stripper pole\nand rapped: \"I keep a couple of hoes from around my way,\"\nreferring to the women they recruited from their neighbor-\nThe two men recruited the victims through deception.

Police set up a sting operation, in which a\nlaw enforcement officer posed as a sex buyer by calling an\nonline prostitution advertisement known to be associated\nwith the victim. He arranged to meet the victim at an apart-\nment. Upon his arrival, the traffickers were arrested and the\nAfter being arrested and charged with sex trafficking,\nboth perpetrators pleaded guilty to Trafficking of Persons for\nForced Labor or Commercial Sexual Activity [RI 11-67-3]\n(Department of the Attorney General of the State of Rhode\nState of Rhode Island v. Joseph DeFeis, 2011a). The Rhode\nIsland Attorney General described the senior partner in the\ntrafficking operation as \". . . a manipulative, violent, danger-\nous predator who has little regard for basic human rights\"\n(Kilmartin, 2011, press release). This man was sentenced to\n6 SAGE Open\nsuspended with probation (Department of the Attorney\nGeneral of the State of Rhode Island, 2011; State of Rhode\nIsland v. Andy Fakhoury, 2011). The second man was sen-\ntenced to 10 years with 1 year to serve and 9 years suspended\nwith probation (State of Rhode Island v. Joseph DeFeis,\n2011a). Restitution was granted to one victim for out of\npocket medical bills (State of Rhode Island v. Joseph DeFeis,\n2011a). At sentencing, the Superior Court Judge said that\ntraffickers were guilty of \"one of the most despicable crimes\nknown to mankind.\" The judge spoke as a Black man and\nmade a comparison of the crimes of trafficking with slavery:\n\"You can tell by the color of my skin I differ in complexion\nfrom you . . . People of my skin color, many of them were not\nbrought here voluntarily . . . What you did in this matter is\nnothing less than being a slave owner in the United States of\nThe first case of sex trafficking in Rhode Island showed\nthe connection between previously decriminalized indoor\nprostitution in Rhode Island and the sex trafficking of vic-\ntims to the state. As the first arrests and charge for sex traf-\nficking, the proceedings garnered a lot of media coverage in\nthe local media. The judge's comment at sentencing clearly\nconnected the actions of the traffickers to slavery.\nFederal Case of Interstate Prostitution\nIn 2009, a report of an assault at a hotel in Rhode Island led\nto a federal investigation into an interstate prostitution opera-\ntion that stretched from Indiana to Rhode Island and\nConnecticut (Bothelo, 2010; United States of America v.\nNathaniel G. Pope, 2009). The case involved two pimps--a\n47-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman--from\nIndianapolis, Indiana, who exploited two victims on a road\ntrip from the Midwest to the Northeast. They ran their inter-\nstate prostitution operation for about 3 years, and had at least\nthree additional victims in Indiana (Bothelo, 2010).\nThe female pimp, known as \"Big Mama,\" recruited an\n18-year-old girl from Indiana by befriending her on the\nInternet and acting as a friend and confidant (Neronha, 2010a;\nUnited States of America v. Jan Wales, 2010). The second vic-\ntim, a 45-year-old woman from Indiana was recruited by the\nmale pimp in an online \"interracial chat room\" (Neronha,\n2010a). The victim said that she was propositioned to be a\nprostitute for the pimp, at which time he \"promised her that he\ndoesn't beat his girls, and promised her that she would be\nThe male pimp, known as \"Rah, Rah,\" transported the\ntwo victims to New England while the female pimp stayed in\nIndiana and ran the administration of the prostitution ring.\nShe posted online prostitution advertisements and set up\nmeetings with sex buyers (Neronha, 2011). When the\n18-year-old victim did not want to engage in prostitution, the\npimp threatened and assaulted the young woman. He stole\nher money, confiscated her cell phone, and abandoned her in\na hotel room in Warwick, Rhode Island (Neronha, 2011).\nThe male senior partner of the team was arrested and\ncharged with a violation of federal law Transportation in\nInterstate Commerce for Purposes of Prostitution (18 U.S.C.\n2421). A few days later, the female junior partner, who had\nfled to Arizona, was apprehended (Neronha, 2010a).\nBoth traffickers pleaded guilty to transporting victims\nacross state lines for the purpose of prostitution (United States\nof America v. Jan M. Wales, 2010b; United States of America\nv. Nathan Pope, 2010). During the sentencing process, the\nfemale pimp claimed that she had participated in a \"victimless\ncrime.\" The United States Attorney said that she had know-\ningly recruited women to engage in commercial sex acts and\nplayed a key role in organizing appointments with sex buyers.\nHe said, \"The defendant was a madam, not a victim\" (Neronha,\nmonths imprisonment and 3 years supervised release (United\nStates of America v. Jan M. Wales, 2010a).\nDuring the sentencing process, the senior pimp, \"Rah Rah,\"\nsaid that his role was misunderstood, he was merely responsi-\nble for \"paying bills and getting groceries\" in a \"happy\" home\nfor wayward prostitutes and their artistic pimp. He too argued\nthat prostitution was a victimless crime. The U.S. Attorney\nresponded that \"this is not a victimless crime. It is tawdry, dan-\ngerous and degrading\" (United States of America v. Nathan G.\nyears of supervised release (United States of America v.\nThis case was the first federal prosecution of a trafficking-\nrelated crime after Rhode Island passed a law criminalizing\nprostitution, which enabled the offense of transportation\nacross states lines for purpose of prostitution to be charged.\nThe claim by the defendants that they were engaged in a\n\"victimless crime\" was clearly rejected by the prosecutor and\nthe evidence in this case demonstrated the violence used\nagainst the victims in this interstate prostitution operation.\nOnline Advertising of Sex Trafficking\nVictims\nFrom the early years of the Internet, traffickers have used\nonline advertising to market victims to sex buyers (Farley,\nMitchell, Jones, Finkelhor, & Wolak, 2011). Sex traffickers'\nuse of online advertising has enabled them to reach a wider\nmarket of potential sex buyers, which has led to the growth\nof prostitution and sex trafficking (Farley et al., 2014;\nGeorge, 2012). In addition, sex traffickers utilize social\nmedia on the Internet to contact vulnerable women and teens\nand groom them to be victims (George, 2012).\nThis analysis of sex trafficking cases identified in Rhode\nrelied heavily on online prostitution advertising sites as a\nmeans to connect with sex buyers. In each of the sex traf-\nficking cases, traffickers paid for advertisements on online\nprostitution sites.\nSkodmin et al. 7\nDisguise of the Victims\nThe most common element of the advertisements was the\ndisguise of the victim's age and identity. The traffickers used\nfake names and false ages for the victims. The traffickers\nconcealed their use of minor girls by always claiming they\nwere above 18 years of age. The minor victims, who were\n17-year-old victim in a Rhode Island domestic trafficking\nold victim in a Rhode Island domestic trafficking case was\nadvertised as being an adult (Milkovits, 2013a; Rosciti,\ntrafficking case was advertised as being an adult (Kantorski,\ntrafficking case was advertised as being 19 (Neronha, 2014).\nSexually Explicit Photos of the Victims\nThe traffickers often photographed victims in sexually\nexplicit poses. In one case, a man trafficked a 17-year-old\ndevelopmentally delayed victim across state lines. After\nbeing arrested, the trafficker admitted that during his online\nconversations with the girl, he knew that there was some-\nthing not quite right with her and that she may have some\nmental deficiencies (Donaghy, 2013). The trafficker took\nphotos of her in her underwear standing in a hotel room, then\nposted them in an online advertisement (Steimle, 2013). In\nanother case, the victim stated the trafficker took pictures of\nher on a couch when she was in her sister's apartment before\nMeans of Using the Internet in the Trafficking\nOperation\nDetails of the cases revealed how traffickers operate using\nthe Internet. In an interstate transportation case, a man and a\nwoman operated as a trafficking team (this case is described\nin more detail previously in this article). The female traf-\nficker remained in Indiana and did the online work. She\nuploaded prostitution advertisements for the victims and set\nup a time and place for her male accomplice to deliver the\nvictim to the sex buyer (Neronha, 2010b). The man in the\nteam drove the victim across the Midwest and into the north-\neastern states, including Rhode Island (United States of\nAmerica v. Nathan G. Pope and Jan M. Wales, 2010).\nAfter posting ads for the women, the traffickers trans-\nported the victims to meet sex buyers, even when the victims\nwere old enough to drive (Neronha, 2011). In three of the sex\ntrafficking cases, the traffickers delivered the victims to the\nsex buyers in hotel rooms or apartments. In one case, the\nvictim was instructed to walk to a nearby empty apartment to\nmeet a sex buyer (Comella, 2011). In another case, the vic-\ntims were kept in an apartment with the two male traffickers\nand the sex buyers came to the apartment to use the women\n(Ruggiero, 2010). In another case, the sex trafficker took the\nteen victim to a strip club where she was used as an exotic\ndancer and used by sex buyers in the private booths in the\nclub (Kantorski, 2013). One female trafficker used online\nprostitution advertisements to set up between 45 and 50\nmeetings with sex buyers for a 14-year-old victim within a\nfronted the 21-year-old trafficker, she said, \"That's [victim's\nnickname], I knows she's young, I don't do anything, I just\npost info and take the calls\" (Rosciti, 2013a).\nExploitation of Race and Ethnicity of Victims\nIn the advertisements, the traffickers exploited the victims'\nrace and ethnicity. The traffickers used the victims' physical\nattributes to market them to sex buyers. For example, there is\na small population of people from the Cape Verde islands in\nRhode Island (Fox Point Cape Verdean Project, n.d.). The\ntrafficker exploited the 17-year-old Cape Verdean victim's\nethnicity in the prostitution advertisement. \"Capverdian [sic]\nParadise $50 Special--Hello, My name is Jessica . . . I am 20\nyears old and willing to make your night wild . . . hit me up\nif u down to handle what I got\" (State of Rhode Island v.\nIn another case, the trafficker emphasized that the victim\nwas white with blond hair.\nA pretty and petite blond, age nineteen, available all day for\nupscale gentlemen looking to spend some time together.\nTraffickers exploiting their victims'ethnicity is not unique\nto Rhode Island. In a study of prostitution advertisements in\nLas Vegas, ethnicity was specified in 92% of the ads (Farley\net al., 2014). The researcher wrote that the inclusion of race\nand ethnicity in the ads reflected their importance to sex\nbuyers.\nTargeted Marketing of Victims\nThe traffickers also wrote the advertisements to target cer-\ntain populations of sex buyers by using slang or different\nwording and language style. In some advertisements, the\ntraffickers marketed the victims to sex buyers of a certain\nage and economic background. In two of the advertisements,\nthe traffickers targeted older, wealthier men. One advertise-\nment requested \"upscale gentlemen\" (Ruggiero, 2010).\nAnother trafficker requested that sex buyers be middle-aged\nor older \"gentlemen.\" \"Sweet girl next door-19. Hey every-\none! I'm the new girl in town. I am your sweet cute girl next\ndoor. So come see me. Older gentlemen only. 45 years of\nThe advertisements listed prices for the commercial sex\nacts. In one case, two traffickers sold the victim for US$150 for\na half hour and US$250 for an hour of oral sex and intercourse\n8 SAGE Open\nwith the victim (Ruggiero, 2010). And, in another case, a male\nand female trafficking team sold the victims to sex buyers for\nin the case where the victim was a developmentally delayed\nteen, the trafficker negotiated a price with a sex buyer for\nLaw Enforcement's Use of Prostitution\nAdvertisements in Investigations\nIn two of the six cases, police used the online advertise-\nments to set up a sting that resulted in the rescue of victims\nand the arrest of traffickers. In one case, after a call from a\nworried mother, the Yonkers, New York, police identified\nthe young woman in an online prostitution advertisement.\nThey contacted Providence Police, who initiated an investi-\ngation into the report that a 19-year-old woman was being\nforced into prostitution (Mulvaney, 2014). Providence\nPolice located the online prostitution advertising with a\nphoto of the victim. A police officer, posing as an under-\ncover sex buyer, made an appointment to meet with the vic-\ntim (Ruggiero, 2010). The arranged meeting place was at an\napartment in Providence where the victim was being held by\nThis analysis of online advertisements for victims of sex\ntrafficking is consistent with findings of other researchers,\nlaw enforcement personnel, and service providers' reports\nthat online prostitution sites are commonly, even exclusively,\nused to market victims of sex trafficking. Recently, the\nMassachusetts Attorney General stated that the majority of\nsex traffickers in human trafficking cases prosecuted in her\noffice have used online prostitution advertisements to exploit\nworking sites, advertising websites, message boards, and\ndating sites all provide platforms for prostitution marketing\nwith relative anonymity and impunity (Farley et al., 2014).\nMothers Involved in Recovering Victims\nOne of the key findings of this analysis of human trafficking\ncases in Rhode Island is that family members, particularly\nmothers, were often involved in the recovery of their daugh-\nters. In half (three of six) of the sex trafficking cases, mothers\nplayed active, even central, roles in locating their daughters.\nMothers initiated investigations on their own, made police\nreports, and even contacted the traffickers in attempts to\nrecover their daughters.\nThe analysis of sex trafficking cases in Rhode Island found\nthat some of the victims were not completely isolated from\ntheir families. Although the traffickers controlled the victims\nand limited or monitored their communication, the victims\nwere still able to communicate with family members. Several\nvictims in two cases of sex trafficking maintained contact\nwith their mothers using their cell phones. In these cases, the\nvictims talked to their mothers but did not communicate\nopenly with them about all the details of how they were being\ntrafficked. One crucial piece of information they often did not\nreveal to their mothers was their locations.\nIn the first case of human trafficking prosecuted in the\nstate of Rhode Island, two men conspired to gain the confi-\ndence of at least four victims from their old New York neigh-\nborhood (Milkovits, 2010b). The traffickers ensnared the\nvictims with false promises of love, a job, and a sense of\nfamily. They used the victims' familiarity with them as\nneighbors to gain their trust (Milkovits, 2011). In this case,\none mother knew the man who persuaded her daughter to\nleave with him, although she did not know that he intended\nIn the same case, one victim told her mother that she was\nleaving with the trafficker because he loved her, and he knew\nwhere there was a job for her as a waitress. Soon after the\nvictim left, she called her mother and said, \"Mom, I wish I'd\nnever come\" (Milkovits, 2011). Her mother's suspicion that\nher daughter was in danger intensified when, over a period of\nmonths, her phone calls with her daughter were always inter-\nrupted. As the mother knew the man her daughter was with,\nshe tried to contact him repeatedly to find her daughter. On\none occasion, the trafficker answered his phone and told the\nvictim's mother that he did not know where her daughter was\nAnother mother in the same case was not aware of her\ndaughter's situation until she received a phone call for help\nfrom her daughter as she hid in a bathroom of the apartment\nwhere she was being held captive (Milkovits, 2014a). The\nmother called the police to get help for her daughter. When\npolice showed up at the apartment, this victim left with the\npolice. Another victim who was present denied that she was\nin danger and stayed at the apartment with the trafficker\n(Milkovits, 2014a). She would not be rescued until months\nlater when her mother contacted local Yonkers Police in New\nYork for help to locate her daughter (Milkovits, 2011).\nAs the victimization of teen girls and young women by\ntraffickers becomes more widely known, more family mem-\nbers are turning to online prostitution sites to try to find their\nmissing daughters. In a Rhode Island domestic trafficking\ncase, a mother recognized her missing 14-year-old daughter\nin a prostitution advertisement. Although the girl kept in\ntouch with her mother every 2 to 3 days by cell phone, she\nnever disclosed her location (Milkovits, 2013b). After the\nmother recognized her daughter, she called the number on\nthe advertisement and confronted the trafficker. The traf-\nficker hung up, but her daughter called her back and told her\nmother that she loved her. Still, the girl would not reveal her\nlocation. The mother then called the Pawtucket Police, which\nled to the victim being rescued, and the trafficker being\nIn an interstate transportation case, a trafficker befriended\na 17-year-old girl with a developmental disability online. He\nthen met her at a public library in Massachusetts and took her\nSkodmin et al. 9\nwith him. When the victim's mother could not find her daugh-\nter, she immediately called the police and reported her as\nmissing (Hager, 2012). In the library's surveillance video, the\ngirl was seen leaving with a man (Saladna, 2013). The family\nparticipated in a press conference asking for the return of her\ndaughter and asked the community to become involved in\nfinding her. With tears in her eyes the mother pleaded to the\nman who abducted her daughter: \"Whoever you are could\nyou please just bring her home to us today. I want her to sleep\nin her own bed tonight\" (Hager, 2012).As a result of the news\nconference and media attention on the abduction of the teen,\nthe victim was identified by a Rhode Island citizen while she\nwas with the trafficker on the street (Milkovits, 2014b).\nTwo victims' mothers spoke at the traffickers' sentencing\nhearings about the harm that they did to their daughters. One\nmother said, \"You manipulated a very trusting young girl.\nShe trusted you and went with you\" (Mulvaney, 2011a). She\ncontinued by stating her daughter had been drugged,\nenslaved, and denied food and water (Mulvaney, 2011a).\nAnother victim's mother addressed the trafficker as she said,\n\"You will do your time and get out and rebuild your life in no\ntime, for my daughter it will probably take a lifetime\"\nAlthough mothers played a significant role in locating and\nrecovering their daughters, in one case, a family member--a\nsister--played a more complicit role in her sister's victimiza-\ntion. She knowingly allowed her minor sister, who had run\naway from a group home, to have contact with a known pimp\nand involve her in prostitution. After the trafficker was\narrested, the sister indicated that she knew the trafficker had\n\"put her sister to work\" (Silva, 2011). In a police statement,\nthe victim's sister wrote, \"I . . . knew that [the trafficker] put\ngirls on the Internet so he would have money in his pocket\nand gas in his car\" (Rosciti, 2011b). She claimed that when\nshe learned the trafficker was selling her sister on the Internet,\nshe confronted him (Silva, 2011). However, a social worker\nfrom a group home was responsible for contacting the police\nand initiating an investigation, which eventually led to the\narrest of the trafficker (Rosciti, 2011a).\nOne of the most notable findings from this analysis of\ncases of human trafficking in Rhode Island is the role that\nmothers played in recovering their daughters. The police\nacknowledged the significant effort of the mothers.At the end\nofonecase,aSergeantfromtheProvidencePoliceDepartment\ncommended the mothers for their involvement in the case. He\nsaid the mothers kept looking for their daughters until they\nwere found: \"The mothers never gave up on their daughters\"\n(Mulvaney, 2011a). The mother's involvement was a key fac-\ntor in the discovery of these trafficking cases.\nMuch of the human trafficking literature discusses how\nvictims are often runaway girls, who are fleeing abuse at home\nor throwaway girls who are no longer wanted by family mem-\nbers (Hanna, 2002). The analysis of these Rhode Island cases\nraises another possibility, and that is that mothers continue to\nlook for their missing daughters and even take an active role in\ntheir recovery.\nThere are anti-trafficking organizations, movies, and\nbooks that emphasize in their names that the victims are\ndaughters. Examples include, Captive Daughters (http://\nwww.abolishsexslavery.org/captive-daughters), Somebody's\nDaughter (Sher, 2013) and She's Somebody's Daughter\n(http://www.shessomebodysdaughter.org/). In England in\n1996, a mother, whose daughter was controlled by a pimp\nand murdered by a sex buyer, founded an organization called\nCoalition for the Removal of Pimping (CROP). The organi-\nzation continues today under the name of Parents Against\nChild Sexual Exploitation (PACE). PACE offers support to\nparents whose children are actively being sexually exploited\nby people outside the family, including traffickers.\nBefore her death, Norma Hotaling, survivor and founder of\nSAGE (Standing Against Global Exploitation) in San\nFrancisco, said she wanted to work on family reunification for\nvictim/survivors and their families, particularly between moth-\ners and daughters. In her work with victims of prostitution and\nsex trafficking, Hotaling had discovered that often mothers still\nloved their daughters and were concerned about them, but their\nfamilies had become broken, often due to domestic violence or\ndrug abuse. Hotaling saw the possibility of rebuilding damaged\nrelationships, and considered that an important way to assist\nvictims to recover and find stability in their lives.\nHowever, there is no research on the continuing relation-\nship between victims of sex trafficking and their mothers (or\nother relatives) after the daughter is under the control of a\ntrafficker. The analysis for this article introduces this as an\narea for future research. Understanding continuing relation-\nships between mothers and their victim daughters could pro-\nvide insight into how to break the traumatic bonding that\noccurs between perpetrators and victims.\nConclusion\nThis article is an analysis of law enforcement identified cases\nlooked at and evaluated seven cases of human trafficking,\nincluding one case of forced labor of a domestic worker and\nsix cases of sex trafficking.\nAlthough the number of cases in this analysis is low, sig-\nnificant information about human trafficking in Rhode Island\nemerged, including several topics for further research.\nOverall, the Rhode Island cases were similar to human\ntrafficking cases in other states in the United States. The\nforced labor case involved the trafficking of a foreign\nnational woman by a foreign national trafficker. The sex traf-\nficking cases were domestic sex trafficking. A few of the\ncases involved interstate transportation of victims, and there\nwere cases that involved sex trafficking within the state of\nRhode Island. The victims were often runaways who were\nvulnerable to recruitment by sex traffickers.\nSome notable findings that are worthy of further study\nemerged from the analysis. In the forced labor human traf-\nficking case, there were different findings in the criminal and\ncivil cases, which seemed to be a difference in the judges'\nopinions on the credibility of the victim. To date, there has\nbeen no analysis of human trafficking civil suits in the United\nStates. This is an important topic for further study, including\nthe damages levied and whether the traffickers ever paid the\ndamages to the victims.\nDue to a history of decriminalized prostitution in Rhode\nIsland, traffickers perceived the state to be tolerant of prosti-\ntution and therefore a low-risk destination and environment\nfor exploitation of victims. More research is needed on the\nrole that state toleration of prostitution plays in creating a\nlow-risk environment for sex trafficking.\nAlthough the use of the Internet and prostitution advertis-\ning sites have been researched, this analysis revealed a need\nfor more detailed analysis of advertisements known to offer\nvictims of trafficking, including the role race and ethnicity\nplay in marketing the victims and the cues in the ads for the\ntype of sex buyers the victims are being marketed to.\nFinally, the most previously un-researched topic to emerge\nfrom the analysis was the role that mothers played in locating\ntheir daughters and how their reports to police initiated inves-\ntigations. In two of the cases, the mothers contacted the traf-\nfickers in an effort to find their daughters. This is an entirely\nnew area of research for understanding the dynamics of stop-\nping human trafficking.\nOverall, this analysis of law enforcement identified cases\nof human trafficking in Rhode Island found that these seven\ncases were consistent with other cases in the United States.\nThe detailed analysis of the cases revealed important topics\nfor further research in this field.\n"
