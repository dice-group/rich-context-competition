    "abstract": "Abstract\nVoting for radical right-wing parties has been associated most strongly with national\nidentity threats. In Europe, this has been framed by the radical right in terms of\nmass-migration and European integration, or other politicians bargaining away national\ninterests. Perhaps surprisingly given the radical right's nationalist ideology, nationalistic\nattitudes are hardly included in empirical research on the voting behaviour. In this\ncontribution, we test to what extent various dimensions of nationalistic attitudes\naffect radical right voting, next to the earlier and new assessed effects of perceived\nethnic threat, social distance to Muslims, Euroscepticism and political distrust. The\nfindings show that national identification, national pride and an ethnic conception of\nnationhood are additional explanations of radical right voting. National identification's\neffect on radical right voting is found to be stronger when populations on average\nperceive stronger ethnic threat.\n",

Mudde (2007) describes the ideologist position as one\nCorresponding author:\nMarcel Lubbers, Department of Sociology, Radboud University, Thomas van Aquinostraat 6, 6525GD\nNijmegen, the Netherlands.\nEmail: m.lubbers@maw.ru.nl\nof `nativism', implying that radical right-wing parties propose to keep the nation\nstate population native, and that non-native elements are threatening the homogen-\neity of the nation state. In somewhat different terms, Rydgren (2007) labelled the\nradical right-wing ideology as one of `ethno-pluralism'. In this ideology, differences\nbetween cultures are emphasized, and to preserve perceived national unique features,\ndifferent cultures should stay apart and should not mix, because that would lead to\nextinguish of the unique cultural characteristics. At the one hand, the uniqueness of\nthe nation\u00adstate is stressed, and at the other hand, the threats against which the\nnation\u00adstate should be protected. Radical right-wing programs mostly open with\nquestions on and perceived threats to national identity. The Flemish Interest party\nproclaims that it is `a Flemish-nationalist party. . . implying that the cultural identity\nof our people are decisive for the creation and government of the state'. The German\nNDP (Nationaldemokratische) claims that national identity means that `Germany\nshould remain the country of the Germans, and should, in places where this no\nlonger is the case, become it again'. And the Dutch Party for Freedom claimed in\nthe first paragraph of the election program from 2010 that `The Dutch do not have\ntheir equals. We are born from a fight for freedom. Our ancestors have turned this\ndelta marsh in a country that is envied by the whole world'.\nEmpirical research on the predictors of a radical right-wing vote hardly\naddressed the role of the nationalist part of the ideology. It focused much more\non the role of attitudes towards issues that are claimed to be related to threats to\nthe nation. First, researchers studied the role of attitudes towards migrants and\net al., 2000) and second, studies turned to the role of euro-scepticism (e.g. Werts\net al. 2012). These ideologically related explanations turned out to exist next to\npolitical protest explanations such as political distrust or political cynicism\n(Ivarsflaten, 2008; Werts et al., 2012). Measurements of nationalistic attitudes to\nexplain radical right-wing voting have hardly been included, possibly because most\nof the international studies rely on cross-national datasets such as the European\nSocial Surveys and Eurobarometers in which measures on nationalism lack. In the\ncountry case studies where it was included, only a specific dimension of national-\nistic attitudes \u00ad i.e. national pride \u00ad was studied (Billiet and De Witte, 1995) or it\nwas not controlled for the relevant other predictors of radical right voting\n(Meuleman and Lubbers, 2013). These studies showed that nationalistic attitudes\nhad at the most a small effect on voting for the radical right. We address the\nrelation between nationalistic attitudes and a vote for the radical right further in\nthis contribution. We question whether nationalistic attitudes affect the vote for the\nradical right next to attitudes that have previously turned out to be decisive in the\nvote for the parties, i.e. perceptions of migrant threat, euro-scepticism and political\ndistrust. With this approach, we will provide insight into the role of identification\nwith the nation (in comparison to identification with Europe or sub-national geo-\ngraphical units) in voting for the radical right and will discuss whether this iden-\ntification is a sufficient or merely a necessary condition. Relating to other studies\nthat study the consequences of national identification and nationalist attitudes\nLubbers and Coenders 99\n(e.g. De Figueiredo and Elkins, 2003; Gibson, 2006), we include measurements for\nmultiple dimensions of nationalistic attitudes. We demonstrate whether concep-\ntions of nationhood that exclude out-groups based on origin affect voting for the\nradical right (Rydgren, 2007). With that focus, the contribution shows whether\nnationalistic attitudes are the underlying explanations of the effects of perceptions\nof migrant threat and euro-scepticism on radical right-voting (Werts et al., 2012).\nMoreover, we test the relationship in a cross-national comparative setting, provid-\ning evidence whether a context in which a public opinion is more favourable\ntowards the radical right, national identification is more likely to be positively\nrelated to radical right voting. The results indicate that nationalistic attitudes\naffect radical right-wing voting over and beyond ethnic threat, social distance to\nMuslims, Euroscepticism and political dissatisfaction, though its effect is modest.\nExpectations\nThe literature has regarded the importance of unfavourable attitudes towards\nmigrants (e.g. Van der Brug et al., 2000) and euro-scepticism in radical right\nvoting as support for the idea that people vote because of a nationalist ideology\n(e.g. Werts et al., 2012). When migrants or the European Union (EU) are perceived\nas an economic, cultural or political threat to the national interests, voters would\nfavour a party that claims to serve the natives' in-group interests. The question\nremains unanswered whether the radical right mobilizes support because of its\nappeal to people who identify strongly with the nation and are patriotic or only\nto people who perceive that the national interests are under threat from immigrants\nand further European integration. Building on Social Identity Theory (Tajfel, 1982;\nTajfel and Turner, 1979), it is claimed that the nation can be one of the relevant\ngroups that people identify with (e.g. Smith, 2007). When the nation is a more\nrelevant group for someone's identity it is to be expected that the nationalist ideol-\nogy of the radical right, referring to the relevance of that group membership, is\nsupported stronger than when people do not identify with the nation at all. From\nthis perspective, it seems that national identification is a necessary condition to\nsupport parties that proclaim a nationalist ideology, which should lead to the\nfinding that among people that do not identify with the nation, voting for the\nnationalist parties is absent. We expect that people who do not attach importance\nto the nation and do not identify with the nation will be unlikely to vote for a party\nwith a nationalist agenda.\nHypothesis 1a: People without a positive identification with the nation do not vote for\nthe radical right.\nBut will stronger identification with the nation also have the consequence of stron-\nger support for a nationalist party? Radical right parties define an out-group in\norder to construct a national in-group. Bruter and Harrison (2011) describe this as\nthe negative conception of identity. Due to the nationalist program of radical right\nparties, we expect that stronger national identification induces more interest in and\nsupport for nationalist ideologies, and consequently a larger likelihood to vote\nradical right.\nHypothesis 1b: The stronger the identification with the nation, the stronger the sup-\nport for the radical right.\nHowever, in line with previous research that showed that national identity is not\ninherently related to an out-group bias (Brewer, 2001; De Figueiredo and Elkins,\n2003; Gibson, 2006), the relation between national identity and radical right voting\nmight be more complicated. Although nationalistic attitudes and perceptions of\nthreat to the nation are correlated, love for the country and even perceived super-\niority of the country do not necessarily have to result in perceptions of migrant\nthreat and euro-scepticism (Coenders and Scheepers, 2003). Associations between\nnationalistic attitudes and anti-immigration attitudes are far from perfect. And\neven though European identification is positively associated with positive attitudes\nshown that the identities are not mutually exclusive. Citrin and Sides (2004) pro-\nvide evidence that a (small) proportion of EU citizens hold a dual identity, attach-\ning importance to being a country's national and European. In accordance with\nthese findings, theorists in the Social Identity Theory tradition have stressed that\nstronger in-group identification does not has to be accompanied with negative\nidentification is a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition for intolerance.\nThe radical right plays both cards in its rhetoric and campaigns: it departs from a\nnationalist ideology, stressing the relevance of national identification and national\npride, but it does so by framing that its definition of the national identity is under\nthreat. To shed more light on this issue, we also address other aspects of nation-\nalistic attitudes (national pride and conceptions of nationhood) as well as the\nnational context in which national identity may be more strongly related to radical\nright voting.\nFirstly, we take into account pride is one's nation as another aspect of nation-\nalistic attitudes (Ariely, 2012; Solt, 2011). Identification does not necessarily have\nan evaluative component, whereas pride expresses an explicit positive evaluation of\nthe nation. We therefore expect that stronger pride in the country is likely to\nincrease the orientation to parties that address a nationalist ideology.\nHypothesis 2: The more national pride, the more likely the vote for the radical right.\nHowever, here national pride \u00ad in the absence of negative identity construction \u00ad\nmay be unrelated to voting for the parties that are built around a nationalist\nideology. De Figueiredo and Elkins (2003) showed for the US that patriotism\nwas not related to levels of prejudice. A similar finding was reported by Gibson\n(2006), showing that stronger sympathy for the in-group in South-Africa did not\ngive rise to intolerance. It showed that love for one's nation is widespread and that\nintolerance is just as likely among people with and without pride in the nation.\nAgain we propose that love for the nation is a necessary condition for voting for a\nnationalist party. The radical right strongly relies on nationalist symbols to stress\nits love for the nation. People without any love for the nation will therefore be\nunlikely to vote for the nationalist party.\nHypothesis 2a: People without national pride do not vote for the radical right.\nSecondly, the literature on nationalistic attitudes has further differentiated between\nattitudinal dimensions (Dekker et al., 2003; Hjerm and Schnabel, 2010). This dif-\nferentiation can improve our understanding of the relation between nationalistic\nattitudes and radical right voting, and address the question whether these are\ninherently interrelated. One relevant distinction is made between civic and ethnic\ncommunity (Anderson, 1983) \u00ad is understood. These conceptions contain different\nviews on what characterizes the national in-group and the extent to which national\ngroup membership is defined in a way that excludes migrants. In an ethnic defin-\nition of nationhood, the nation is defined in terms of shared ancestral origins and\ncultural homogeneity and distinctiveness. Membership of the national community\nis denied to anyone who is not a member of the native majority group. This ethnic\nconception of nationhood reflects the jus sanguinis (right of blood) principle of\nnation-building, according to which citizenship is based on ancestry (Brubaker,\n1992). Here, the basis may be found why migrants and the EU are more likely\nto be seen as a threat; by the definition of what nationhood constitutes, people\nfrom other cultural backgrounds are excluded. In contrast, in a civic definition of\nnationhood, membership of the nation does not depend on descent, but on the\nwillingness to accept the basis rules. Civic nationalism focuses on commitment to\nsociety and participation in society (Smith, 2001). The civic conception of nation-\nhood reflects the jus soli (right of ground) principle of nation-building, according to\nwhich citizenship is based on living within the national territory.\nEthnic and civic conceptions of nationhood are not mutually exclusive; people\nmay support both types of nationhood (Janmaat, 2006), but it is generally thought\nthat an ethnic conception of the nation is stronger associated with exclusion of\nmigrants than a civic conception of the nation (Kunovich, 2009). As Bruter and\nHarrison (2011) identify, radical right parties define the nation by referring to what\nthe majority shows to have in common, such as history and language. People who\ndo not share these common features are then excluded from membership. We hence\nfocus on the criteria that people use to define the nation.\nHypothesis 3a\u00adc: People who attach more value to (a) common national ancestry, to\n(b) being born in the country and to (c) be able to speak the national language for\nbeing truly a member of the nation, are more likely to vote for the radical right.\nAs ancestry is the most exclusive criterion to define nationhood (Rydgren, 2007),\nwe would expect that this particularly holds for those who attach more value to\ncommon national ancestry.\nNational public opinion\nThe discussion on civic and ethnic conceptions of the nationhood has often been\nlinked to different national traditions in dominant ideas of nationhood and official\ncitizenship criteria. Based on citizenship regime traditions, France and Germany\nhave often been regarded as ideal types of respectively jus soli and jus sanguinis\ncountries (Brubaker, 1992). However, subjective conceptions of nationhood among\nthe general public do not necessarily reflect the official citizenship criteria that are\napplied by the state. Furthermore, instead of departing from a dichotomy of ideal\ntypes of nations, we think that populations are affected by the general public\nopinion in a country on the conceptions of the nation. We argue that the extent\nto which nationalistic public opinions prevail in a country \u00ad regarding national\npride and ethnic conceptions of nationhood \u00ad affect the relationship between\nnational identification and voting for radical right parties. Since studies into the\nrelation between national identification and intolerance have shown that the asso-\nciation is at the most weak, social identity theorists have stressed the conditionality\nunder which national identification affects intolerance (Brewer, 2001). Gibson\n(2006) states that political and social salience of intergroup tension form such a\nmoderating context. Weldon (2006) showed that laws on citizenship acquisition are\nassociated to intolerance among the population. Also, Pherson et al. (2009) found\nthat the relationship between individuals' level of national identification and anti-\nimmigrant prejudice is moderated by the extent to which people within a country\nendorse specific definitions of the nation. Hence, to take the role of nationalism in\nradical right voting a step further, we also investigate to what extent differences\nbetween countries in the dominant nationalistic public opinion play a role in the\nvoting for the radical right. It can be expected that national identification is stron-\nger related to support for parties with a nationalistic ideology when people are\nencouraged by a public opinion that expresses a strong ethnic perception of the\nnationhood.\nHypothesis 4: The more value the population of a country attaches to a common\nancestry as definition of nationhood, the stronger the positive effect of national iden-\ntification on the likelihood to vote for radical right parties.\nFinally, we anticipate a similar role of the dominant public opinion on migration\nand the EU. Previous studies showed that anti-immigration attitudes and euro-\nscepticism are important explanations of radical right voting. In national contexts\nwhere the dominant public opinion is euro-sceptic and critical towards migration,\nEU integration and migration are more likely perceived as threats to the nation. As\nthe radical right contrasts the positive aspects of the own nation with the negative\nfeatures of perceived threats to the nation, we expect that in countries where EU\nintegration and migration are stronger perceived as problems, national identifica-\ntion will be stronger related to voting for the radical right. Given the anti-Islamic\nrhetoric of many radical right parties in particular and negative public climate\ntowards Muslims, we also focus on the role of the dominant public opinion\ntowards Muslims.\nHypothesis 5a\u00adc: The more unfavourable the public opinion climate towards (a)\nmigrants, (b) Muslims or (c) towards the EU, the stronger the positive effect of\nnational identification on the likelihood to vote for radical right parties.\nData and operationalization\n(EVS, 2011). All European countries participated in this survey. Since we also test\nfor interaction effects between nationalistic attitudes and the dominant public opin-\nion within a country, we included data only from countries with at least 20 radical\nright-wing voters. The attitude towards the EU was not asked in Norway.\nTherefore, we also dropped this country from the analysis. This left us with 20\ncountries (see Table 1).\nRadical right-wing voting: We classified parties according to the standards in the lit-\nerature, discussing which parties belong to the party\u00adfamily (Immerzeel, 2015;\ntries, parties and the percentage of voters in the data.1\nThe question on voting behaviour tapped which party respondents had voted for\nin the last national elections. Our dependent variable is dichotomous, with the\nvalue 1 referring to a radical right-wing party vote, and the value 0 referring to\na vote for another party. People that did not vote, or reported that they did not\nknow which party they had voted for were excluded from the analyses. The per-\ncentage that claimed not to vote equals almost 25%, which is an underestimation of\nnon-voting. Another 9% did not know which party to vote for and around 7% did\nnot provide an answer.\nNationalistic attitudes: National identification was measured with a question in which\nrespondents were presented five geographical units (locality or town, region, coun-\ntry, Europe, the world) and were asked `which of the geographical groups would\nyou say you belong to first of all?' and as a follow-up question `and secondly?'. We\ndistinguished between those who mentioned the country as their first choice (i.e.\nstrong national identification), as their second choice (moderate national identifi-\ncation) and those who did not mention their country (weak national identification).\nAlthough the question triggers respondents to mention a geographical group even\nwhen they identify to none of these groups, we would anticipate that most of these\nrespondents would then have missings and mentioned nothing. This was however\nnot the case. Figure 1 shows that national identification is much more relevant for\nEuropean citizens than European identification. It also shows that national iden-\ntification is particularly strong in Finland, Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey.\nNational pride was measured with the question `How proud are you to be a\ncountry citizen?', with four answer categories, ranging from not proud at all, to\nvery proud. Ethnic nationalism was measured by a question introduced by the\ninstruction `Some people say the following things are important for being truly\n[nationality]. Others say they are not important. How important do you think each\nof the following is?'. Respondents rated the importance of various criteria from\n1 (very important) to 4 (not important at all). Ethnic nationalism was indicated\nTable 1.

The other criteria people\ncould rate are `being born in the country' and `to be able to speak the national\nlanguage(s)'. We also control for the criterion `to respect country's political insti-\ntutions and laws'. Figure 2 shows the differences between the included countries in\nhow the populations attach importance to these criteria for being truly a member of\nthe national group. In general, people attach more importance to language\nand respecting the country's political institutions and laws. In Eastern European\ncountries, the population makes a less clear distinction. In Bulgaria, Croatia,\nNaon most important Europe most important\nFigure 1. National and European belonging by country.\nAncestry Being born in country Language Respecng law\nFigure 2. Importance of national ancestry, being born in the country, speaking the language\nand respecting political institutions and laws for being fully country's national.\nGreece, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Turkey, respondents value ancestry and\nbeing born in the country as relevant as speaking the national language and\nrespecting country's political institutions and laws. The correlations between the\nthree aspects of nationalistic attitudes (identification, pride and ethnic nationalism)\nare in general modest. The strongest correlation exists between national pride and\nethnic nationalism (r \u00bc 0.27). All other correlations are positive and significant as\nwell, but are weaker in strength.\nOther socio-political attitudes: In this study, we control for other attitudes that previ-\nously have been found to be central in explaining radical right support (Werts et al.,\n2012). Regarding individual perceptions, first, perceived migrant threat was mea-\nsured by five bipolar items (`immigrants take jobs away from natives in a country'\nversus `immigrants do not take jobs away from natives in a country'; and in the\nsame bipolar manner: `a country's cultural life is [not] undermined by immigrants';\n`immigrants [do not] make crime problems worse'; `immigrants are [not] a strain on\na country's welfare system' and `in the future the proportion of immigrants will\n[not] become a threat to society') (Cronbach's alpha \u00bc .87). We also include a meas-\nurement on the attitude towards Muslims. Although this measure as a separate\nmotive for voters to choose the radical right has not been tested empirically very\noften, we think it is relevant since many of the radical right parties demarcate the\nin-group by opposing it to Muslims in European countries. Respondents were\nasked about their social distance towards a variety of groups with the question\nwhether they would not like to have them as neighbours. When Muslims were\nmentioned we coded that as social distance towards Muslims. Third, we included\neuro-scepticism, measured with five items referring to fears related to the building\nof the EU (`A loss of social security'; `A loss of national identity and culture'; `Our\ncountry paying more and more to the EU'; `A loss of power in the world for the\ncountry' and `A loss of jobs in the country') (Cronbach's alpha \u00bc 0.89). Next,\nauthoritarian tendencies were measured with three items asking respondents\nabout the preferred political system (`having a strong leader who does not have\nto bother with parliament and elections', `having experts, not government, make\ndecisions according to what they think is best for the country' and `having the army\nrule the country'). The four answer categories ranged from very good to very bad,\nwith higher scores referring to more authoritarian tendencies (Cronbach's\nalpha \u00bc 0.58). Finally, we included political distrust, measured by the items `confi-\ndence in parliament' and `confidence in political parties' (r \u00bc 0.54). All attitudes\nwith at least semi-interval measurement level were Z-standardized, resulting in\nscales with means of zero and standard deviations of one. The online appendix\ncontains the descriptive statistics.\nStructural background characteristics: The highest completed educational level was\nmeasured with the international comparable ISCED (International Standard\nClassification of Education) scheme. We applied the ISCED 2-digit code and\ngrouped smaller categories together, resulting in 10 categories from 0 `pre-primary\neducation or no education' to 9 `second stage of tertiary education'.2 With regard\nto social class, we distinguished between people presently employed and non-\nemployed people. For those currently employed, we applied the nominal class\ntypology of Erikson, Goldthorpe and Portocarero (EGP, 1979). For those cur-\nrently not employed, we distinguished between unemployed people and a residual\ncategory consisting of retired people, people working in their own household and\nlooking after their children, students, disabled people, other social positions and\nemployed people whose EGP score was missing.\nFinally, we included sex, age, migrant status and church attendance as control\nvariables in the analyses. With regard to age, a random sample of the adult popu-\nlation was drawn in each country, except for Finland (18\u00ad74 years of age). To\nprevent outliers on the age variable, we recoded the lower and upper values to\nrespectively 18 and 90 years of age. The variable migrant status distinguishes\nbetween respondents whose parents were born in the country of residence and\nfirst and second generation migrants. Church attendance ranged from attending\n`(practically) never' (1) to `more than once a week' (7).\nMacro level characteristics: We include the average public opinion in a country\nregarding national pride, an ethnic conception of nationhood (regarding the rele-\nvance of having country's ancestry), migrant threat, distance toward Muslims and\neuro-scepticism. This was calculated by aggregating the individual level attitudes to\nthe country level. We control for two macro-level characteristics that have been\nincluded often in previous research: the level of unemployment and the percentage\nof foreign-born population. These figures have been derived from Eurostat (2015a,\n2015b). Eurostat did not provide the unemployment figures for Switzerland and\nSerbia. These figures were derived from the Wordbank. It were also the countries\nwith lowest (3.4%) and highest (13.6%) unemployment rates, respectively. The\nforeign-born population figures are available for most countries from 2009\nonwards. For France, Latvia and Austria figures from 1 January 2008 were already\navailable, for the other countries for 2009. Exceptions are Bulgaria (2011), Slovakia\n(2010) and Switzerland (2011), for which the figures had become later available.\nFor Turkey and Serbia, we relied on UN statistics. The foreign-born population\nwas largest in Switzerland (24.7%) and lowest in Romania (0.8%).\nMethods and results\nTo account for clustering within countries, we use multilevel analysis. It estimates\nthe variance between countries in the extent of radical right voting. To test whether\nnationalistic attitudes are associated with radical right voting, we first build a\nmodel not controlled for the other attitudes. We then add the attitudes that have\nbeen found to affect radical right voting in previous research, to find out whether\nthe effects of nationalistic attitudes remain. In a final model, we include the random\nslopes and the cross-level interactions, to test to what extent the effect of national\nidentification is dependent on the national public opinion.\nWe first show descriptive findings providing evidence whether under the condi-\ntion of absence of national identification and absence of patriotism, the vote for the\nradical right is absent as well, and what the bivariate association is between the\nnationalistic attitudes and the vote for the radical right. Figure 3 shows that\nthe associations between three presented nationalistic attitudes and voting for\nthe radical right are positive. With stronger identification, more national pride\nand more importance attached to national ancestry, support for the radical right\nis stronger. The association does not seem to be very strong though, in particular\nnot where it concerns national identification. Here we see that also among people\nwho do not mention the nation to be important, a share does support the radical\nright, refuting hypothesis 1a. Radical right voting also takes place among people\nwith no love for the nation, contradicting our hypothesis 2a and contrasting our\nexpectations that national identification and love for the country are necessary\nconditions to vote for the radical right. In line with hypotheses 1b and 2, we do\nfind overall positive associations between national identification and pride and\nsupport for the radical right.\nTable 2 presents the results of the analyses, showing to what extent the attitudes\nare related to radical right voting under control of each other and other charac-\nteristics. Model 0 shows that there is quite some variance between the European\ncountries in the level of voting for the radical right, which is in line with actual\nelection turnouts. In Model 1, we included the nationalistic attitudes together with\nthe sociological background characteristics. National identification is not related to\nvoting for the radical right, although its effect is almost significant. A stronger\nidentification with the nation, as compared to other geographical units amongst\nwhich the EU, does hardly increase the likelihood of a vote for the radical right.\nNational pride has the anticipated effect, although also this effect size is modest and\nit is significant only at p < .05.

From the other criteria that people value\nrelevant to be a truly national, `being born in the country' also affects radical right\nvoting positively. The same holds for the aspect of language; voters who attach\nmore relevance to understanding the national language in order to be seen as a\ntruly national, are more likely to vote for the radical right. Attaching more import-\nance to `respecting political institutions and laws' as a civic definition of nation-\nhood reduces the likelihood to vote for the radical right. For the background\ncharacteristics, this model replicates findings from earlier research, showing that\nlower educated, manual workers and men are more likely to vote for the radical\nright. It also shows that the older one is, the less likely it is to vote for the radical\nright. People who attend church more often are less likely to vote for the radical\nright. On the macro-level, we do find, as some previous studies found as well, that\nthe unemployment level in a country is negatively associated with the likelihood to\nvote for the radical right. The effect from the percentage of foreign-born people is\npositive but (just) not significant.\nIn Model 2, we added the other socio-political attitudes. The question now is\nwhether the effects of national pride and the relevance of ancestry, being born in\nthe country and language as criteria for nationhood remain significant when the\nmajor other explanations of radical right voting are included, related to threat\nperceptions, authoritarianism and political distrust. Model 2 shows that perceived\nmigrant threat, social distance to Muslims, euro-scepticism, authoritarianism and\npolitical distrust have the effects as anticipated, of which migrant threat is the\nstrongest predictor. Our interest goes to the effects of nationalistic attitudes.\nUnder control of all the socio-political attitudes, national identification is now\n(just) significantly related to voting for the radical right, which is in line with\nTable 2. Continued\nb SE b SE b SE\n\u00ad level 2 variance\n(countries)\ne\n\u00ad level 1 variance\n(respondents)\n(z), standardized independent variable.\nhypothesis 1b. We found that the effect of national pride remains (and is even\nsomewhat larger than in Model 1), corroborating hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 3a is\nalso not refuted. The effect of the relevance people attach to ancestry is markedly\nsmaller in Model 3 than in Model 2, indicating its strong relation with the other\nattitudes included, but its effect remains significant. The relevance of being born in\na country for nationhood is fully explained by the included attitudes, refuting\nhypothesis 3b. This does not hold for the relevance people attach to language,\nthat effect remains, supporting H3c.\nComparing the effect sizes, however, it shows that perceived migrant threat and\nsocial distance to Muslims have the strongest contribution in explaining radical\nright-wing voting. As is often argued, political distrust is a good runner-up. The\nrole of the nationalistic attitudes is smaller and more comparable to the role of\nauthoritarianism, just somewhat smaller than the effect of Euroscepticism.\nConcluding we can state that nationalistic attitudes do play a role in voting for\nthe radical right, and we also showed that national pride and ethnic conceptions of\nnationhood are more important than the level of national identification in itself,\nbut the direct contribution of nationalistic attitudes in explaining radical right\nvoting is modest.\nFinally, we investigated the effect of the national public opinion climate on the\nrelation between national identification and voting for the radical right. Overall,\nnational identification turned out to have a (small) effect on radical right voting.\nWe also anticipated that when people identify with the nation strongly, they will\nturn to radical right parties in particular when the public opinion in a country\nexpresses a stronger ethnic perception of the nation. We therefore included a\nrandom slope of national identification to model the variance in the effect of\nnational identification between countries. We tried to explain this variance, by\nincluding an interaction between national identification and the public opinion\non the relevance of national ancestry for nationhood. First, we have to conclude\nthat the effect of this ethnic nationalistic public opinion is insignificant. The degree\nto which the general public in a country adheres to a more ethnic exclusive defin-\nition of nationhood is not associated with a larger likelihood to vote for the radical\nright. Second, the effect of national identification is not dependent on this aggre-\ngate ethnic perception of the nationhood in a country, refuting Hypothesis 4. The\nfinding that the effect of national identification varies across countries is hence not\ndue to the differences between the countries in the public opinion regarding the\nethnic conception of the nationhood. We also tested whether the effect of national\nidentification is stronger in countries with a public opinion that is more unfavour-\nable towards migrants (level of migrant threat), or where there is on average more\nsocial distance to Muslims and a more euro-sceptic public climate. The interactions\nbetween national identification and public opinion on Muslims and the EU were\nnot significant (Models 3b and 3c; refuting H5b and H5c). However, as shown\nin Table 3 (Model 3a), we do find that the effect of national identification is\nstronger in countries where the public perceives more migrant threat (supporting\nhypothesis 5a). With a one standard deviation increase in average public opinion\nTable 3.

This\nmeans that in countries where on average migrants are stronger perceived as a\nthreat, a solider sense of belonging to the nation is more strongly associated\nwith the vote for the radical right. The reverse holds for countries with a public\nopinion expressing less migrant threat: there it is estimated that national identifi-\ncation lowers the likelihood to vote for the radical right. Figure 4 expresses this\nrelation between national identification and support for the radical right in the\ndifferent contexts of public opinion. It shows that national identification is not\ninherently related to a stronger likelihood to vote for the radical right. Only in\ncountries where perceptions of migrant threat are widespread among the general\npublic, a stronger sense of national identification is related to a higher likelihood to\nvote for the radical right\nConclusions and discussion\nRadical right-wing parties campaign most strongly against immigration and Islam,\nand are known for their anti-EU stances and anti-establishment rhetoric. From\nthat perspective, it is no surprise that previous research found repeatedly that anti-\nmigration attitudes, euro-scepticism and political cynicism are the strongest explan-\nations of radical right voting. However, both radical right-wing parties themselves\nand social science theorists have emphasized the role of nationalist ideology. In the\nnationalist ideology, the nation with its ascribed characteristics is regarded as the\nkey unit to structure socio-cultural life, and is opposed to larger units as the EU.\nThe national characteristics should, according to the nationalist ideology of the\nradical right, be preserved and protected. Identity and pride in the nation, symbo-\nlized by abundant presence of the flag in campaign material, are at the core of the\nprograms. Moreover, most of the radical right parties take exclusionist stances in\ntheir conceptions of nationhood, mostly favouring an ethnic conception. We there-\nfore question to what extent voters with nationalistic attitudes were more in favour\nof voting for the radical right \u00ad surprisingly hardly studied in previous research. We\nfind that people who identify stronger with the nation are somewhat more likely to\nvote for the radical right, but the effect is small. It is questioned to what extent\npeople perceive themselves to belong to the nation, in competition with other (more\nlocal or international) geographical areas. People who picked the nation as most\nimportant to belong to are found to be more likely to vote for the radical right.\nSometimes national pride is considered as a part of national identification as well;\nour results indicate a weak correlation though between identifying stronger with\nthe nation and national pride. We test its effect here separately and find a (weak)\nassociation with radical right voting; the more pride in the nation, the more likely\nvoters are to vote for the radical right. Finally, we distinguish between various\nconceptions of nationhood. As anticipated, our findings indicate that the more\npeople value ancestry as relevant for nationhood, the more likely they are to\nvote for the radical right. In line with radical right parties' rhetoric about a nation's\nshared ancestry and culture, the importance attached to speaking the national\nlanguage was also positively related to support for the radical right. These associ-\nations between national identification, national pride and the relevance of ancestry\nand language on the one hand, and radical right voting on the other hand,\nremained when controlled for what turned out the strongest predictors of radical\nright voting: perceived migrant threat, social distance to Muslims, political cyni-\ncism and euro-scepticism.\nOur results show that firstly, certain nationalistic attitudes are relevant in\nexplaining radical right voting, but in line with earlier research, national identifi-\ncation and love for the country are hardly related to expressions of intolerance.\nSecondly, we find that it is not so much the degree of national identification that\nmatters, but more the extent to which people attach pride to their nation and their\nethnic or civic conception of nationhood. Thirdly, although on average the role of\nnationalistic attitudes is modest, national identity is more relevant in countries with\na more negative public climate towards immigrants. Since European populations\nidentify stronger with the nation than for example with Europe, changes in public\nopinion on migration may cause a larger shift in support for the radical right than\nmight be thought based solely on the larger share of the population perceiving\nstronger migrant threats.\nThe role of nationalistic attitudes is complicated. Radical right supporters gen-\nerally have exclusionist conceptions of the nation, but not always identify first and\nforemost with the nation. In that perspective they may be seen to have a negative\nconception of identity (Bruter and Harrison, 2011). Often they attach more import-\nance to the region or local communities and do not express pride in the nation.\nPerhaps because they long to a nostalgic construction of the nation: they are proud\nof what the nation once was, not of the current state of the nation (Meuleman\npluralism (Rydgren, 2007) in which it is stated that the radical right ideologies\ndepart from preserving the unique characteristics of the nation and protect it to\npossible threats, in particular the part describing the threats turn out the most\nrelevant in explaining radical right voting. Threat from migration and Muslims\nand threats from the EU, next to political distrust, remain the most important\npredictors of voting for the radical right. For radical right voters, nationhood is\nstrongly defined in terms of ancestry and speaking the country's language. But this\nlatter criterion resonates among a much broader public than among the radical\nright's electorate only.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication\nof this article.\nNotes\n1.
