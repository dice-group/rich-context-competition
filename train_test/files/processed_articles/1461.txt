Diabetes-related\nhearing impairment has been described as\nsensorineural in origin, implying that the\nlesion may be cochlear or of the eighth\ncranial nerve, but evidence favoring a spe-\ncific mechanism is insufficient and con-\ntradictory (3). One possibility is that\nmicrovascular changes, which often lead\nto nephropathy and retinopathy, also af-\nfect the cochlear vasculature. Thickened\nbasilar membranes and capillaries of the\nstria vascularis and atherosclerotic nar-\nrowing of the internal auditory artery\nwere found among autopsied people who\nhad diabetes but not in people without\ndiabetes (4,5). Diabetes is also associated\nwith neuropathic and peripheral artery\ncomplications that contribute to diabetic\nfoot ulcers (6). Atrophy of the spiral gan-\nglion and demyelination of the eighth cra-\nnial nerve among autopsied diabetic\npatients suggest a neurological etiology to\ndiabetes-related hearing impairment (5).\nRegardless of whether the primary lesion\nis angiopathic or neuropathic, hypergly-\ncemia may contribute (7).\nCardiovascular disease, hyperten-\nsion, and other cardiovascular risk factors\nare associated with hearing impairment\n(8\u00ad10). Because people with diabetes\nhave a greater risk of these conditions\nthan those without diabetes (11,12), the\nrelationship between diabetes and hear-\ning impairment may be attributable to a\ngreater prevalence or severity of cardio-\nvascular factors.\nEstablishing effective interventions to\ndisrupt the pathogenesis of diabetes-\nrelated hearing impairment will depend\non understanding the mechanisms. This\ninvestigation studies potential mediators\nof the relationship between diabetes and\nhearing impairment. Specifically, we ex-\namine whether the presence of vascular or\nneuropathic conditions, cardiovascular\nrisk factors, glycemia, or a marker of in-\nflammation explain the association be-\ntween diabetes and hearing impairment.\nMETHODS -- Data come from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES) collected during\ntistage, probability sample designed to be\nrepresentative of the civilian, noninstitu-\nwere randomly assigned to audiometric\ndiometric examination.

Higher thresholds indicate\ngreater hearing impairment. Pure-tone air\nconduction hearing thresholds in deci-\nbels hearing level (dB HL) were obtained\naudiometric technicians using audiomet-\nric equipment and methods that have\nParticipants were classified as having\nlow/mid-frequency hearing impairment if\nthe average of pure-tone thresholds (here-\nafter referred to as pure tone average)\nthe worse ear exceeded 25 dB HL. High-\nfrequency hearing impairment was de-\nfined as the pure-tone average measured\nthe worse ear exceeding 25 dB HL. The\npure-tone average in the worse ear was\nused to classify participants as having im-\npairment in at least one ear. We identified\n14 participants with at least one audio-\nmetric nonresponse (tone not perceived).\nGiven that the average of these partici-\npants' available pure-tone thresholds ex-\nceeded 25 dB HL, we classified these\nparticipants as impaired at the frequency\nrange within which the audiometric non-\nresponse occurred.\nDuring in-home interviews, demo-\ngraphic characteristics and a medical his-\ntory were obtained (13). We defined\ncoronary heart disease as a positive re-\nsponse to any of three questions asking\nwhether a doctor had told them they have\ncoronary heart disease, angina, or had had\na heart attack. Of participants who re-\nported smoking at least 100 cigarettes in\ntheir lifetime, those who answered affir-\nmatively to \"do you smoke now?\" were\nclassified as current smokers. Occupa-\ntional noise exposure was defined as a his-\ntory of loud noise at work that required\nspeaking in a loud voice.\nAnthropometric and clinical mea-\nsures were obtained during physical ex-\naminations that included a blood draw\nand urine collection (13). Participants\nwere identified as having diabetes from a\nvalid fasting plasma glucose of 126\nmg/dl or a positive response to the ques-\ntion, \"Other than during pregnancy (for\nwomen), have you ever been told by a\ndoctor that you have diabetes?\" BMI was\ncomputed from measured weight (kg) di-\nvided by square of the measured height\n(m)andcategorizedwithcutpointsof25,\ncentral adiposity as a waist measurement\nwomen. We defined hypertension as sys-\ntolic blood pressure 140 mmHg or dia-\nstolic blood pressure 90 mmHg or\nparticipant report of a diagnosis or cur-\nrent antihypertensive medication use. Pe-\nripheral arterial disease and arterial\nstiffness were derived from the ankle-\nbrachial index in either the right or left\nankle. We defined peripheral arterial dis-\nease as an ankle-brachial index 0.9 and\narterial stiffness as an ankle-brachial in-\ndex 1.4. Peripheral neuropathy was de-\nfined as having at least one insensate area\nof six metatarsal sites tested (three on each\nfoot) using a standard 10-g monofilament\ntest.\nUrinary albumin was determined\nfrom a solid-phase fluorescent immuno-\nassay, and urinary creatinine was ana-\nlyzed using the Jaffe kinetic rate reaction.\nAlbuminuria was defined as a ratio of uri-\nnary albumin to urinary creatinine 30\nmg/g. As a marker of inflammation, C-re-\nactive protein (mg/dl) was quantified in\nserum by latex-enhanced nephelometry\nusing a Behring Nephelometer (Dade Be-\nhring, Somerville, NJ) and categorized\ninto tertiles due to skewness. Total cho-\nlesterol and HDL were measured enzy-\nmatically. High cholesterol was defined as\ntotal cholesterol 240 mg/dl, a positive\nresponse to when asked if a health profes-\nsional had ever told the participant he or\nshe has high cholesterol, or participant\nreport of current use of lipid-lowering\nmedications. Low HDL was defined as\nHDL 40 mg/dl. A1C was assessed by\nBoronate affinity high-performance liq-\nuid chromatography using Primus\nKansas City, MO), and values were stan-\ndardized to the method of the Diabetes\nControl and Complications Trial, yielding\ninterassay coefficients of variation 3.0%\nData analysis\nStatistical differences in the distribution\nof covariates, including sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics, noise exposure,\nperipheral neuropathy, glycosylated he-\nmoglobin, and vascular factors, were ex-\namined using a t test (for continuous\ncharacteristics) or 2 test (for categorical\ncharacteristics). For the t test, values for\nA1C were transformed by taking their in-\nverse to meet the assumption of normal-\nity. We used logistic regression to\nestablish preliminary odds ratios for the\nassociation of diabetes with hearing im-\npairment at low/mid and at high frequen-\ncies, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity,\neducation, smoking, and occupational\nnoise exposure. All covariates, whether\nconceptualized as potential mediators or\nconfounders, were regressed on diabetes\nstatus while adjusting for age, sex, race/\nethnicity, education, and smoking (14).\nCovariates were also tested for an associ-\nation with low/mid- and high-frequency\nhearing impairment (without controlling\nfor diabetes). Significant associations of\nthese factors with diabetes and with hear-\ning impairment were interpreted as evi-\ndence consistent with a mechanistic\npathway operating through these vari-\nables (15), with the caveat that our cross-\nsectional study design does not permit\ndistinction between biological mediators\nand confounders, which have no causal\nrole. We then examined whether further\nstatistical adjustment for a given covariate\nwould diminish the preliminary odds ra-\ntios of diabetes with hearing impairment.\nThus, if the odds ratio for the association\nof diabetes and hearing impairment de-\ncreased after adjusting for a potential me-\ndiator, we interpreted this observation as\nevidence of partial mediation or partial\nconfounding by this factor. Finally, parsi-\nmonious models were developed to esti-\nmate associations between diabetes and\nhearing impairment simultaneously ad-\njusting for all significant covariates. Age\nand A1C were treated as continuous vari-\nables in all regression models. Tests of\nquadratic terms for each suggested no sig-\nnificant curvilinear relationship with\nhearing impairment. Analyses were per-\nformed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Insti-\ntute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN version\n10.0.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Re-\nsearch Triangle Park, NC), incorporating\n6-year sample weights. For those in the\nfasting sample, fasting weights were dou-\nbled to account for the one-half of the\nfasting sample for whom audiometric\nmeasures were unavailable. For subjects\nwith diagnosed diabetes, audiometric\nweights were used.\nRESULTS -- Characteristics of the\npresented in Table 1, stratified by low/\nmid- and high-frequency hearing impair-\nment. People with hearing impairment\nwere, on average, 6 years older than those\nwithout hearing impairment, and a lesser\nproportion was non-Hispanic black. Six-\nMediators of diabetes-related hearing impairment\nty-one percent of adults with high-\nfrequency hearing impairment were male,\nwhich was over twice the proportion\namong those without hearing impair-\nment. We found no difference in low/\nmid-frequency hearing impairment by\nsex. Adults with hearing impairment had\nsignificantly less education. Over 40% of\nthose with high-frequency hearing im-\npairment reported occupational noise ex-\nposure, compared with 24% of those\nwithout high-frequency hearing impair-\nment. The lack of a difference in occupa-\ntional noise exposure between those with\nand without low/mid-frequency impair-\nment was expected because the frequen-\ncies over which the pure-tone average was\ncalculated excluded those most suscepti-\nble to injury from noise. Age-adjusted\nprevalence of diabetes among the hearing\nimpaired was twice that of those not im-\npaired in the low/mid-frequency range\nand 75% greater than those not impaired\nin the high-frequency range.\nAge-adjusted prevalence estimates of\npotential confounders or mediators of the\nassociation between diabetes and hearing\nimpairment at low/mid- and high-\nfrequency ranges are also presented in Ta-\nble 1. Coronary heart disease was more\nprevalent among those with hearing im-\npairment in both frequency ranges, but\nthe difference was not significant in the\nlower frequency range (P  0.09). Com-\npared with the nonimpaired subjects,\nadults with high-frequency hearing im-\npairment were more likely to be over-\nweight or obese, but we observed no\ndifference in the prevalence of central ad-\niposity by hearing impairment status.\nAdults with high-frequency hearing im-\npairment had a greater prevalence of pe-\nripheral neuropathy than those who were\nunimpaired; the difference was margin-\nally significant at low/mid-frequency.\nPrevalence of albuminuria, peripheral ar-\nterial disease, hypertension, and high\ncholesterol did not differ by hearing im-\npairment status. The proportion of adults\nwith low HDL was higher among the\nhearing impaired at both frequency\nTable 1--Characteristics of the U.S. population aged 40\u00ad69 years by hearing impairment status at low/mid and high frequencies, NHANES\nLow/mid\nfrequency Low/mid frequency High frequency High frequency\nImpaired\nImpaired\nMeans or %  SE Means or %  SE P Means or %  SE Means or %  SE P\n25 dB in the worse ear.

C-reactive protein (CRP)\nwas shifted to higher levels among adults\nwith hearing impairment compared with\nthose without impairment, but the distri-\nbutions were significantly different only\nat the high-frequency range. The propor-\ntion of current smokers was higher among\nsubjects with high-frequency hearing im-\npairment than among those without.\nA series of models that tested whether\nanthropometric, neuropathic, vascular,\ninflammatory, and glycemic factors may\nbe mediating the association between di-\nabetes and hearing impairment is pre-\nsented in Table 2.

We hypothesized a biological\nmodel in which diabetes contributes to\nhearing impairment through a vascular or\nneuropathic mechanism, with either re-\nlated to hyperglycemia. We tested this hy-\npothesis by evaluating the extent to which\ncontrolling for A1C and markers of vas-\ncular, neurologic, and inflammatory pa-\nthology explained the greater prevalence\nof hearing impairment among subjects\nwith diabetes (1).\nDiabetic neuropathy is a heteroge-\nneous disorder that affects sensory and\nmotor nerves and those responsible for\nautonomic functions (16). Using mono-\nfilament testing on the sole of the foot, a\ncommon screening test for diabetic pe-\nripheral neuropathy, we found some evi-\ndence that peripheral neuropathy is\nmediating the association with low/mid-\nbut not high-frequency hearing impair-\nment. Using one or more insensate sites to\nclassify insensate foot yields moderately\nhigh sensitivity and specificity (80%)\n(17), but the degree of false-positivity\nmay differ by diabetes status. The full ef-\nfect of a possible mediator (or con-\nfounder) may not be detected if a variable\nTable 2--Multivariable-adjusted* prevalence odds ratios (95% CI) for the association be-\ntween diabetes and low/mid- and high-frequency hearing impairment in U.S. adults aged\nLow/mid frequency High frequency\nData are odds ratio (95% CI). *Adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, and occupational\nnoise exposure.\nTable 3--Independent associations* between diabetes and CRP as a potential mediator and\nlow/mid- and high-frequency hearing impairment among the U.S. population aged 40\u00ad69\nLow/mid frequency High frequency\nCRP tertile\nLowest Referent Referent\nData are odds ratio (95% CI). *Adjusted for age, race, sex, education, smoking, and occupational noise\nexposure.\nMediators of diabetes-related hearing impairment\nis subject to misclassification. Alterna-\ntively, our measure may be a poor proxy\nfor neuropathy of the cochlea.\nHistopathological evidence of the in-\nner ear suggests that angiopathic mecha-\nnisms plays a role in diabetes-related\nhearing impairment (5). We used albu-\nminuria as a proxy for cochlear vascu-\nlopathy because there is increasing\nrecognition of pathological mechanisms\nthat may be shared by the renal and oto-\nlogical systems (18). We found a modest\neffect of controlling for albuminuria,\nwhich reduced the association of diabetes\nwith high-frequency hearing impairment\nthe association for low/mid-frequency\nimpairment. Previous epidemiological\nevidence of an association between ne-\nphropathy (defined as renal transplant,\ndialysis, gross proteinuria [100 mg/dl],\nor creatinine 1.6 mg/dl) and hearing\nimpairment among subjects with diabetes\nsuggests that the relationship may only be\nobservable with more severe kidney dys-\nfunction (2).\nWe found no evidence that any vas-\ncular component to diabetes-related hear-\ning loss is mediated through or\nconfounded by high cholesterol, low\nHDL, hypertension, or history of cardio-\nvascular events. These results are consis-\ntent with studies by Helzner et al. (19)\nand Torre et al. (20), although Torre et al.\nand Gates et al. (8) identified an associa-\ntion of cardiovascular disease with co-\nchlear impairment among women, a\nresult we did not replicate. Comparisons\nshould be made cautiously, however, be-\ncause methodological differences of the\nprevious studies include sampling older\nindividuals, excluding mild cases of hear-\ning impairment, assessing preclinical\nhearing impairment, and not adjusting for\ndiabetes. The low overall prevalence of\nperipheral vascular disease and arterial\nstiffness (3 and 1.5%, respectively) in our\nrelatively young sample may have limited\nour ability to detect any effect of these\nmacrovascular conditions. Of all cardio-\nvascular disease risk factors that we exam-\nined, only BMI attenuated the preliminary\nassociations. Our fully adjusted models\ndo not include BMI, so obesity may be a\nmarker for an inflammatory process that\npromotes atherosclerosis or neuropathy\nOur results showing CRP may mediate\nthe association of diabetes with high-\nfrequency hearing impairment suggest the\nrole of an inflammatory mechanism. In-\nflammatory diseases resulting in sensori-\nneural hearing loss have been described in\nclinical studies (22,23), but to our knowl-\nedge, this inflammatory marker has not\nbeen correlated with diabetes-related hear-\ning impairment in population-based stud-\nies. CRP correlates with cardiovascular risk\nfactors such as obesity, HDL, hypertension,\nand smoking, which might implicate an\natherosclerotic mechanism, so it is unclear\nwhy our results do not suggest a role of\nother vascular measures (24).\nGlycemia may be a factor in diabetes-\nrelated hearing impairment. In our analysis,\ncontrollingforA1Cdiminishedtheoddsra-\ntio for diabetes with low/mid-frequency\nhearing impairment slightly from 2.03 to\n1.90 but attenuated the association with\nhigh-frequency hearing impairment to a\nnonsignificant level. Because most of the\nvariance in A1C is explained by diabetes,\ninterpreting the role of A1C as a mediator\nmay be overstating the case. Glycated he-\nmoglobin has not been associated with\nhearing impairment, both in a general pop-\nulation and among people with diabetes\n(2). However, we previously demonstrated\na gradient in hearing impairment preva-\nlence by glycemic status (comparing per-\nsons with diabetes, impaired fasting\nglucose, and normal glucose metabolism),\nimplicatinghyperglycemiaasapossibleme-\ndiator of diabetes-related hearing impair-\nThese cross-sectional data limit our\nability to distinguish between factors acting\nas mediators and those operating as con-\nfounders, because statistical adjustment for\neither will diminish the preliminary associ-\nation.

Alternatively, there\nmay exist unexplored biological mecha-\nnisms including glucose sensitivity, insulin\nresistance, temporal bone pathology, more\nfrequent ear infections, or genetic factors\nthat predispose to hearing loss and cosegre-\ngate with other genetic factors that predis-\npose to diabetes.\nIn summary, we find that factors re-\nlated to neuropathy, microangiopathy,\ninflammation, and glycemia explain part\nof the association between diabetes and\nhearing impairment. Additional studies\nare necessary to delineate temporal rela-\ntionships among diabetes, potential me-\ndiators, and hearing impairment.\n"
