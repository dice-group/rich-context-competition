Building upon the party nationalization literature, we argue that a party's presence in elections across\nsubnational units and its subsequent performance in these elections are determining factors for whether it enters the\npresidential race. To conduct our analysis, we have assembled an original dataset on parties' presence and performance\nin subnational elections and presidential entry in 17 countries in Europe and Latin America from 1990 to 2013. We\nfind that a party's presence and performance in subnational elections are significant predictors of its decision to run for\npresident, even when the party ran in the previous election and when the elections are concurrent. These findings have\nimportant implications for understanding how subnational elections relate to national party systems and democratic\nrepresentation, more generally.\n",

Ultimately, the party, which represents\npoor subsistence farmers, ran in three mayoral contests in\nFebruary 2014, and won two of them, including that of\nCotacachi, Ecuador's third largest city. Subnational elec-\ntions are often the entry point to politics for new parties\nsuch as Living Well, which have specific local interests.\nHowever, with both their electoral success and their mes-\nsage, Living Well garnered the attention of national parties\nas well as that of the national media (El Norte EC, 2013).\nCurrently, Ecuador does not have a nationwide party\nfocused exclusively on `green' issues (Eisenstadt and West\n[no date]) but, with its success, Living Well is a contender\nto fill that vacuum. Can we expect parties like Living Well\nto also participate in national politics? More generally, to\nwhat extent does the experience of a party in subnational\nraces predict its decision to enter national elections?\nInvestigating how geographic subunits structure national\npolitical competition has captured the attention of scholars\nat least since Schattschneider (1960) recognized the lure of\nlocal politics for members of the US Congress. Although\nthere is a growing body of literature on party system nation-\nalization, few investigations have focused on how nation-\nalization occurs specifically in presidential systems\nBottoms up: How subnational elections\npredict parties' decisions to run in\npresidential elections in Europe and Latin\nAmerica\nJae-Jae Spoon1 and Karleen Jones West2\n Keywords\nParty strategy, presidential elections, subnational elections\n1 Department of Political Science, University of North Texas, USA\n2 Department of Political Science, SUNY-Geneseo, USA\nCorresponding author:\nJae-Jae Spoon, Associate Professor, Department of Political Science,\nEmail: spoon@unt.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nfocused on the influence of subnational elections in the\nthat do investigate the influence of subnational races exam-\nine how they affect national legislative politics rather than\npresidential contests. Yet, both in theory and in practice,\nsubnational politics have the potential to be significant pre-\ndictors of parties' presidential strategies. This article fills\nthis gap in the literature by explicitly theorizing and analyz-\ning the connection between parties' presence and perfor-\nmance in subnational elections and their decision to enter\nthe presidential election.\nTo investigate the connection between subnational elec-\ntions and the presidential race, we have assembled an origi-\nnal dataset that includes electoral results for all parties in\nthe highest level of subnational races (governorships or\nsubnational legislative bodies) for 17 countries in Europe\nwhether those parties ran their own candidates for president\nin the concurrent or subsequent presidential election. By\nfocusing on subnational elections at the level of the indi-\nvidual party, we are able to explicitly model how parties'\nsubnational electoral presence and performance predict\ntheir approach to one of the most significant national-level\nelections \u00ad the presidency.\nSubnational presence, performance,\nand presidential elections\nThere are strong theoretical rationales for why subnational\nelections should predict parties'decisions to enter the presi-\ndential race. A party's subnational presence is the extent to\nwhich it contests subnational elections within a country.\nSome political parties have high presence in subnational\nelections, competing for governorships or regional legisla-\ntures in nearly every subnational unit. However, as the\nLiving Well example demonstrates, regional concerns can\ndrive both candidate and voter behavior in subnational\nraces. Candidates may form their own regionally-focused\nparty to address local concerns that have been neglected by\nnational parties. This is often in response to voters who\nexpress preferences that are dominated by such local con-\ncerns. Because subnational offices are the most appropriate\nvenue for affecting local policy, in addition to being the\nmost accessible for regional parties to win, we would\nexpect regional parties to be especially likely to emerge to\ncontest subnational elections. Empirically, this expectation\nis demonstrated in our sample (see Figure 1).\nHowever, elections can be considered to function as\n`economies of scale' for political parties \u00ad the more elec-\ntions in which a party becomes involved, even if they are\nnot at the same time, the less costly each election is because\nparties will have already built up the necessary resources\nand organizational strength to run a campaign. Given the\nnationwide scale of the race, presidential elections tend to\nrequire organizational presence across the country. In addi-\ntion, presidential candidates benefit from having regional\nbases of support among constituents who can contribute\nvaluable resources to the campaign \u00ad time, money, and,\nmost importantly, votes. A regional party that contests sub-\nnational elections in fewer than a quarter of a country's sub-\nnational units likely does not have the organizational\nsupport or resources to finance a nationwide campaign\nrequired to contest the presidency. However, as a party's\nsubnational presence increases, so too should its organiza-\ntional capacity, which suggests that a more national pres-\nence is a good predictor that a party will contest the\npresidency. This leads to our first hypothesis:\nH1: Parties that have a larger presence in subnational\nraces \u00ad i.e. run for office in more of their country's sub-\nnational units \u00ad will be more likely to run a candidate for\npresident.\nIt is not, moreover, merely participating in subnational\nelections that may predict when parties enter presidential\nelections. Subnational performance, or the average vote\nshare that a party receives in elections for governor or\nregional legislatures, should also affect a party's decision to\nenter the presidential race. Similar to subnational presence,\ngreater subnational performance indicates that a party has\nthe organizational capacity and voter support needed to\nlaunch a national campaign for the presidency. However,\nthere is another mechanism at work that connects subna-\ntional performance with entry in presidential contests, and\nthat is the introduction of influential new members to the\npolitical party. Indeed, research on individual parties has\nillustrated how strong performance in subnational elections\nFrequency\nPresence\nFigure 1. Distribution of subnational presence.\nThe figure shows the distribution of the presence variable. The solid line\nis the kernel density plot.\nSpoon and West 3\nmay help predict a party's national political strategy. For\nexample, Samuels (2004) shows that the Brazilian Workers'\nParty's success in state and municipal elections introduced\nmore moderates to the party, which ultimately led the party\nto transition from being a radical niche party to a main-\nstream political competitor that eventually won the presi-\ndency. Other scholars have attributed the national-level\nsuccess of `New Left' parties in Latin America to their\nachievement in subnational governments. In particular,\ncontrol of municipal governments gave left parties an\nopportunity to solidify their organization and support bases,\ngain experience, and establish reputations for administra-\ntive competence that was crucial for their ability to launch\nand win presidential contests across the region (Ch\u00e1vez and\nIn sum, greater subnational performance means that\nthere are new politicians joining the party label to compete\nfor governorships and regional legislatures and that they\nare enjoying some success. Such success indicates that\nthese politicians are likely pragmatic \u00ad able to adjust their\npolitical strategy to gain votes \u00ad and are also likely to be\nmore moderate \u00ad or at least appeal to the median voter\nwithin their particular region. This influx of relatively pow-\nerful new party members is likely to influence the party's\nnational electoral strategy towards increasing the party's\noffice-holding opportunities and towards engaging in polit-\nical competition for higher-level offices. Given these pos-\nsible influences, we argue that, like subnational presence,\nsubnational performance is also a good predictor of when\nparties enter the presidential race. This leads to our second\nhypothesis:\nH2: Parties that have greater performance in subnational\nraces \u00ad i.e. stronger bases of support and greater elec-\ntoral success across subnational units \u00ad will be more\nlikely to run a candidate for president.\nOur argument focuses explicitly on how greater experi-\nence in subnational elections is a predictor of parties' deci-\nsions to enter the presidential race. We argue that\nsubnational elections are strong predictors of presidential\nentry even when parties compete for the presidency for\nother reasons \u00ad either to gain office or earn credibility as\ncoalition-partners and policy advocates (West and Spoon,\n2013) \u00ad and then supplement their presidential campaign\nby competing for subnational office. Parties are more\nlikely to treat subnational elections as complements to the\npresidential race under two conditions: 1) the party already\nhas strong organizational capacity across the subnational\nunits; and 2) the party believes that it can benefit from\nexpending valuable resources to compete for subnational\noffice. The first condition is met if the party competed for\nthe presidency in the previous election; it would then have\nthe nationwide capacity to launch a presidential campaign\nregardless of its participation in subnational elections. The\nsecond condition exists primarily if the presidential elec-\ntion is concurrent with subnational elections. In concurrent\nelections, entering subnational races does not necessarily\nrequire the launching of separate campaigns as much as it\nrequires adding to the existing national campaign.\nFurthermore, given the power of the coattails effect of\npresidential elections in concurrent election cycles, parties\ncan expect to be more successful in subnational races when\nthey are simultaneously competing for the presidency\nconditions, parties' subnational experience still serves as a\nstrong predictor of their presidential entry decisions.1 Our\nthird hypothesis is thus:\nH3: Parties that have greater performance and presence\nin subnational races will be more likely to run a candi-\ndate for president even when elections are concurrent\nand the party previously contested the presidency.\nData and methods\nTo test our hypotheses on how subnational elections predict\npresidential entry strategies, we compare party behavior in\n17 countries in Europe and Latin America, of which 7 are in\nEurope and 10 are in Latin America.2 All of these countries\nhave a directly elected president. The European countries\nare semi-presidential (as defined by Elgie (1999)) and the\nLatin American countries are presidential. Our original\nnational elections. The subnational units are those that have\nbeen identified as having a significant level of both shared\nand self-rule in the Regional Authority Index (RAI)\n(Hooghe et al., 2008) for the countries included and by our\nown assessment based on the RAI criteria (for the Latin\nAmerican cases), as well as whether they held subnational\nelections. These subnational units vary from municipalities\n(e.g. Finland), to counties (e.g. Romania and Croatia),\ndepartments (e.g. Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay), regions\n(e.g. France), and states (e.g. Austria, Brazil, and\nVenezuela). If a country has subnational executive elec-\ntions, we included those results, and if the country only has\nelections to a subnational legislative body we included\nthose. Of the 57 elections, 34 are for subnational executives\nand 23 are for subnational legislative bodies. Our unit of\nanalysis is the political party in the subnational election.\nOur dataset includes all parties that ran in more than one\nsubnational unit, as well as parties that only ran in one sub-\nnational unit, but won the election in that unit. This results\nSimilar to West and Spoon (2013), our dependent vari-\nable is a binary variable indicating whether a party runs a\ncandidate in the concurrent or subsequent presidential elec-\ntion, coded 1 if so and 0 if not. Because we are focused on\n4 Research and Politics \nhow participation in subnational elections influences presi-\ndential entry, parties that do not compete in subnational\nelections are not included in the dataset. In the coding of\nour variable, we follow Spoon and West (2015) and define\nrunning for president as cases where parties nominate one\nof their own party leaders as a presidential candidate. We\ndid not consider parties joining a pre-electoral coalition to\nsupport the candidate of another party as running a candi-\ndate for president.3 Of the 1036 party observations in our\nOur key independent variables relate to the party's pres-\nence and performance in the subnational elections either\npreceding or at the same time as the presidential election.\nFirst, we account for the presence of the party in subna-\ntional elections by including a variable that measures the\npercentage of subnational units in which the party ran.\nAlthough the mean value for presence is 37.6%, nearly half\nof our observations are less than or equal to 20%, and one-\nfifth of our observations are greater than or equal to 80%.\nThus, nearly 70% of the parties in our dataset can either be\nconsidered to be regional parties, which have concentrated\ntheir subnational efforts, or large nationalized parties that\nare contesting almost all subnational elections. The distri-\nbution of the presence variable is illustrated in Figure 1.\nSecond, we measure the party's performance by using its\naverage vote share in each subnational election across all\nsubnational units.4 The mean value of performance is 6.5%.\nTo test our third hypothesis \u00ad that a party's subnational\npresence and performance are predictors of running for\npresident regardless of election timing or running in the\nprevious presidential election \u00ad we include several interac-\ntion terms. First, we interact both the presence and perfor-\nmance variables with a dichotomous variable for whether\nthe subnational and presidential elections were concurrent.\nWhen subnational elections are not all on the same date\n(e.g. in Argentina and Austria), we code it as concurrent if\na majority of the elections are on the same date as the presi-\ndential election and as non-concurrent if the majority of\nelections are not. Second, we interact both variables with\nthe lagged dependent variable, which indicates whether a\nparty ran a candidate for president in the previous presiden-\ntial election.\nWe also incorporate several control variables in our\nanalysis. First, we include a variable that measures the per-\ncentage of subnational elections won by a political party.\nSecond, we include a dichotomous variable that accounts\nfor whether the party ran in the most populous subnational\nentity.5 We expect winning more subnational offices and\ncompeting in the most populous unit to positively influ-\nence a party's likelihood of running a candidate for presi-\ndent. Third, we control for the type of subnational election\nwith an executive variable, which is coded as 1 for an exec-\nutive election and 0 for a legislative election. We posit that\nrunning in a subnational executive election will provide\nparties with the executive experience necessary to then\nsuccessfully contest the presidency. Among the countries\nin our dataset, we have eight countries that have executive\nelections and six that have legislative elections. Fourth, we\ninclude a dichotomous variable for whether a state is fed-\neral. Following the argument that when parties gain access\nto local office, especially when it is relatively powerful,\nthey may be less likely to expend resources in national\nlikely to run presidential candidates in federal systems.6\nFifth, we utilize a dichotomous variable to account for the\nelectoral rules used in the presidential election. Following\nGolder (2006), we argue that parties are less likely to run\npresidential candidates in plurality systems. Sixth, to\naccount for the consolidation of democratic institutions,\nwe include a democracy control. We posit that, when the\nparty system is more democratic, parties will be more\nlikely to enter the presidential race, given that competition\nis more fair and open. To measure democracy, we use the\ncountry's Freedom House (2015) scores for the year of the\nsubnational election. We add the political rights and civil\nliberties scores and then take the inverse, so that higher\nvalues indicate more democratic countries. Finally, we\ninclude a time component by controlling for whether the\nparty ran in the previous presidential election by lagging\nthe dependent variable. See Appendix 1 for the descriptive\nstatistics of all of the variables included in our analysis.\nTo determine the probability of a party entering the pres-\nidential race, we use a logistic model and cluster the stand-\nard errors by country\u00adyear. We use this technique because\nthe party-level observations in each country for a given\nsubnational election are not independent.\nResults\nTable 1 presents the results from our logistic regression\nanalysis. Model 1 demonstrates support for our first two\nhypotheses. A party's presence across geographic subna-\ntional units (H1) and its performance subnational elections\n(H2) are significant predictors of its likelihood of running a\npresidential candidate. Thus, parties that are more national-\nized, i.e. run in more subnational races, and that perform\nbetter in subnational elections are also more likely to enter\nthe presidential race.\nTo show the substantive effect of our results, we simu-\nlate predicted probabilities. Figure 2 plots the probability\nof entering the presidential race across the range of pres-\nence (Figure 2(a)) and the range of performance (Figure\n2(b)). The dashed lines are the 95% confidence intervals\nand the tick marks on the bottom of the figures indicate\nthe distribution of the presence and performance varia-\nbles. Figure 2(a) demonstrates a strong relationship\nbetween subnational presence and presidential entry\nacross the distribution of presence. The more subnational\nSpoon and West 5\nraces a party contests, the more likely it is to run a presi-\ndential candidate. Holding all variables at their means, a\nparty has a 22.5% probability of entering the presidential\nrace. For a more regional party that only contests 10% of\nsubnational races, the probability of entry drops to 12.7%.\nConversely, for a party that contests 80% of subnational\nraces, the probability of entry is 45.3%. Figure 2(b) shows\nthat there is only a statistically significant relationship for\nperformance when parties on average earn below about\n30% vote share in subnational elections. Thus, as a party's\nsubnational performance increases to 30%, so does its\nprobability of running a candidate. Above 30%, the rela-\ntionship is no longer statistically significant. Increasing\naverage vote share to one standard deviation above the\nAll probabilities are significant at p = .05. Thus, these\nfindings show that presence, or the degree to which a\nparty is nationalized, is a more robust predictor of a par-\nty's probability of running for president across the full\ndistribution of the variable.\nReturning to the example of Ecuador's Living Well\nMovement, our results suggest that for the party to contest\nthe presidency, it must first expand beyond the borders of\nImbabura. In February 2014, the party ran in municipal\nelections in only 1 of Ecuador's 24 provinces (4.2%).\nShould it choose to continue to contest provincial elections\nin the next two years, based on our analysis, it has around a\n17% likelihood of fielding a candidate for president if it\nfocuses only on the single province of Imbabura. Running\nin four additional provinces (20.8% of provinces) increases\nthe likelihood of entering the race to around 20%. Based on\nour results, the party will need to contest roughly 75% of\nprovincial elections (18 provinces) to increase its probabil-\nity of running a presidential candidate to about 40%.\nIn Hypothesis 3, we argued that a party's subnational\npresence and performance are strong predictors of run-\nning for president regardless of election timing or running\nin the previous presidential election. The results of Models\n2 and 3 support this argument. In Model 2, although the\ncoefficients for the interaction terms between presence\nand performance and concurrent elections are negative,\nthey are not statistically significant. Similarly, in Model 3,\nthe coefficients for the interaction terms between presence\nand performance and previously running a presidential\ncandidate are negative, but they are also not statistically\nsignificant. These findings suggest that a party's subna-\ntional electoral choices do reflect its decision to enter the\npresidential race, and that neither timing of the election\nnor previously entering the presidential race appear to\ncondition this predictive relationship.\nSeveral of our control variables also have a significant\nrelationship with the likelihood of running a presidential\ncandidate. First, contesting the election in the most popu-\nlous subnational district has a positive and significant rela-\ntionship with presidential entry. Given the media attention\nand notoriety that both parties and candidates gain by con-\ntesting subnational races in a country's most populous dis-\ntrict, this finding may be attributed to the fact that\nsubnational elections help parties build significant resources\nthat can be readily transferred to the presidential campaign.\nSecond, running for executive office at the subnational\nlevel also positively relates to presidential entry. Competing\nTable 1. Performance and presence in subnational elections.\nDV: Pr (presidential candidate) Model 1 Model 2 Model 3\n***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.10. Results are from logistic regressions with clustered robust standard errors.\n6 Research and Politics \nfor governorships may give parties the experience, credibil-\nity, and notoriety necessary for constructing a bid for the\nhigher-level executive office of the presidency. Third, con-\nsistent with West and Spoon (2013) Now added to the bib-\nliography, we find that electing the president through a\nplurality system increases a party's likelihood of running.\nFinally, as expected, running a presidential candidate in the\nprevious election also strongly predicts entry.\nConclusions\nDo the `races at the bottom' predict parties' presidential\nentry strategies? Through our analysis of the relationship\nbetween subnational and presidential elections, we find that\na party's decision of whether to run a candidate in the presi-\ndential election is predicted by its behavior at the subna-\ntional level. Specifically, we find that a party's subnational\nelectoral presence across districts strongly predicts its\nprobability of entering the presidential race. Performance\nacross subnational units also predicts the party's likelihood\nof presidential entry, but its predictive power is limited to\nsmaller parties. Importantly, neither the timing of the elec-\ntion nor contesting the previous presidential election condi-\ntion how a party's subnational presence or electoral success\npredicts its decision to run a presidential candidate. Thus,\nour findings lend support to our argument that it is the\ndegree of a party's nationalization that predicts whether it\nwill enter the presidential race.\nWe do, however, acknowledge that through our analy-\nsis, we are only able to determine that party nationaliza-\ntion predicts presidential entry. We suspect that the\nfeatures of subnational electoral participation that we\nhighlight above \u00ad e.g. national organizational presence\nand the entrance of influential new party members \u00ad may\ncause parties like Ecuador's Living Well, which originate\nat the subnational level, to enter the presidential race.\nHowever, because entry in the presidential race is not\nrandomly assigned and we are unable to control for all\nconfounding causal factors (such as party ideology, lead-\nership appeal, etc.), we cannot clearly establish a causal\nrelationship between subnational presence and perfor-\nmance and presidential strategy. Future research should\nseek to establish the causal relationship between subna-\ntional electoral behavior and running presidential candi-\ndates by using an approach similar to that of Dinas and\nFoos (2013), who use the discontinuities generated by the\n5% electoral threshold rule in Germany to determine how\nsubnational elections affect performance in national\nelections.\nUnpacking how parties incorporate subnational politics\ninto their national electoral strategies has several implica-\ntions for understanding representative democracy in presi-\ndential systems. First, our project is a first step toward\ndemonstrating the national political consequences of par-\nties'subnational decisions and performance. Though extant\nresearch has shown that subnational elections influence\nnational legislative party systems (Moreno, 2003; Samuels,\n2003), we demonstrate that subnational elections also help\nshape presidential elections by predicting when subnation-\nally-competitive and successful parties enter the presiden-\ntial race. Using an original cross-national dataset, we show\nthat when parties gain experience at the subnational level,\nthey are also more likely to participate in the presidential\nrace, which also corresponds with an increased size of the\nnational party system. Second, our project shows how\nregionally focused parties may influence national politics.\nBy predicting when small parties, like Ecuador's Living\nWell, enter the presidential race, we find that contesting\nsubnational elections may provide marginalized popula-\ntions and minority groups with greater opportunity in\nnational politics, in addition to enhancing their chances to\ninfluence regional politics.\n(a)\n(b)\nPr(presidential candidate)\nSub-national electoral presence\nPr(presidential candidate)\nSub-national electoral performance\nFigure 2.
