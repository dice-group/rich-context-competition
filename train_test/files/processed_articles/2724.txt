Introduction\nThis article attempts to provide a framework for evaluating Respondent-Driven Sampling\n(RDS) by integrating its key assumptions into the Total Survey Error (TSE), (Groves\ngained tremendous popularity due to rising demands for data on rare, hidden and/or\nelusive populations, for example, sexual minorities (for example, Ramirez-Valles et al.\n2005), injection drug users (for example, Burt et al. 2010), racial and ethnic minorities (for\nexample, Dombrowski et al. 2013) and recent immigrants (for example, Montealegre et al.\n2013). Not only in the scientific communities is RDS popular, but also in government\nstatistical systems. RDS is practiced by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention in\nq Statistics Sweden\n1 Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, 426 Thompson St., Ann Arbor, MI 48104, U.S.A.\nEmails: sungheel@umich.edu, tsuzer@umich.edu, jameswag@umich.edu, and rvallian@umd.edu.\n"
