It also has shared causal path-\nways with several diseases affecting the kidney, including\ndense deposit disease (also referred to as Type II membra-\nnoproliferative glomerulonephritis) and atypical hemolytic\nuremic syndrome (aHUS) [1\u00ad3]. AMD is a degenerative\ndisease of the macula marked by drusen deposition; these\nare similar to the deposits seen in dense deposit disease.\nMany polymorphisms in the Factor H gene are associated\nwith AMD and its progression [4, 5], and several of these\npolymorphisms have been noted in cases of dense deposit\ndisease, often in conjunction with other polymorphisms\naffecting the alternative pathway of complement activation\n[1, 6\u00ad8]. Despite similar genetics, these conditions are\ndistinct pathological entities, indicating the existence of a\npeculiar genotype\u00adphenotype relationship. Notably, AMD\nand dense deposit disease have pathological similarities,\nnamely accumulation of complement-containing debris\nwithin the eye and kidney, respectively. Not surprisingly,\nAMD-like pathology is often present in individuals with\ndense deposit disease [9].\nAMD can be classified as early or late, with these strata\noften representing disparate disease states. Early AMD\nconsists of drusen and pigment irregularities, but many\nearly cases do not progress to the advanced form. Late\nAMD is far less frequent but most visually significant.\nPreviously identified risk factors including smoking, obe-\nsity and genetic factors, are more strongly associated with\nlate AMD [10], although there is also substantial overlap\nbetween cardiovascular disease risk factors and both early\nand late AMD, potentially implying that impairment of the\nchoroidal circulation may be involved in the pathogenesis\nof the disease [11].\nPerhaps reflecting either a shared genetic predisposition or\nan association with cardiovascular disease risk factors, recent\nliterature has identified an association between AMD and\nreduced kidney function in large cohort studies [12, 13], while\na large case\u00adcontrol study using administrative data describes\nan association between diabetic nephropathy (independent of\ndiabetes) and a chart-based study of British elders reported an\nassociation between dipstick proteinuria and AMD in men but\nnot in women [14, 15]. Given that most chronic kidney dis-\neases initially manifest with small amounts of albumin in the\nurine, we explored the relationship of albuminuria and glo-\nmerular filtration rate (GFR) with AMD in a generalizable\ncohort of US adults.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES\nIII) is a national survey of non-institutionalized US residents using a\ncomplex, multistage clustered sampling design to achieve generalizability\nto the US population. NHANES III was conducted between 1988 and\n1994. Fundus photography was limited to NHANES III participants aged\nfundus photography at the time of the complete examination [16].\nDemographic and clinical characteristics\nStandardized questionnaires were administered in the home, followed by a\ndetailed physical examination and serum collection at an NHANES mobile\nexamination center. Participants self-selected the racial category that best\ndescribed them from non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican\nAmerican or other. Race for these analyses is dichotomized as black or\nnon-black. Participants were considered to have diabetes mellitus if they\nreported ever having been told by a doctor that they had diabetes or `sugar\ndiabetes' other than during pregnancy or they reported taking insulin or a\n`diabetes pill' at the time of the questionnaire. Participants were classified\nas hypertensive if their mean (of up to six readings on two separate occa-\nsions) blood pressure was !140 mmHg systolic, !90 mmHg diastolic or\nwere prescribed antihypertensive medications. History of cardiovascular\ndisease was defined by participant-identified history of stroke, myocardial\ninfarction or heart failure. C-reactive protein (CRP) in NHANES was not\nmeasured using a high-sensitivity assay; accordingly, the lower level of\ndetection was 0.3 mg/L and values below this threshold are coded as\nhaving a CRP level of 0.21 mg/dL.\nKidney data\nSerum creatinine measurements were performed at a central laboratory\nusing a modified kinetic Jaffe assay on a Hitachi 737 analyzer (Boehringer\nMannheim Corp., Indianapolis, IN). In a sample of 1921 participants who\nhad a repeated creatinine measurement at a mean of 17 days apart, the\npercentage of difference between the two measurements was 0.2 \u00c6 9.7%.\nGFR was estimated with the CKD-epidemiology collaboration equation\nusing serum creatinine measurements recalibrated to the Cleveland Clinic\nA random spot urine sample was obtained from each participant using a\nclean-catch technique and sterile containers, and the sample was analyzed\non frozen non-hematuric specimens. Urine albumin concentration was\nmeasured by solid-phase fluorescent immunoassay. Interassay coefficients\nof variation for low (1.0 mg/L) and medium (15 mg/L) urine albumin\nquality control standards were 16 and 10%, respectively. Urine creatinine\nconcentration was measured by means of the modified kinetic rate Jaffe\nmethod using a Beckman Synchron AS/ASTRA analyzer (Beckman In-\nstruments Inc., Brea, CA). Microalbuminuria was defined by a urine al-\nbumin-to-urine creatinine ratio (ACR) of 30\u00ad300 mg/g and\nmacroalbuminuria by ACR >300 mg/g.\nFundus evaluation\nProcedures for fundus evaluation have been described previously [16].\nBriefly, the retina of a non-pharmacologically dilated eye was photo-\ngraphed, with the field centered horizontally and vertically on a point\nmidway between the temporal edge of the optic disc and the fovea. Images\nwere evaluated at the University of Wisconsin by two experienced graders,\nmasked to subject information. The presence of any drusen, soft drusen,\nretinal pigment epithelial (RPE) depigmentation, increased retinal pig-\nment, geographic atrophy and signs of exudative macular degeneration\nwere assessed. Early AMD was defined as the presence of either soft\ndrusen (!63 lm, consistent with Grade 3 drusen in the Wisconsin Age-\nrelated Maculopathy Grading System [20]) or any drusen type with areas\nof depigmentation or hypopigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium\nwithout any visibility of choroidal vessels or with increased retinal pig-\nment in the macular area. Late AMD was defined as the presence of signs\nof exudative macular degeneration or geographic atrophy (sharply de-\nlineated roughly round or oval area of apparent absence of the RPE in\nwhich choroidal vessels are more visible than in surrounding areas). Kappa\nscores for intergrader and intragrader reliability ranged from 0.62 to 0.83\nStatistical analysis\nAlbuminuria is highly prevalent in the general population and has multiple\ncommon associates, including older age, diabetes and hypertension. Re-\nflecting the competing causes of microalbuminuria whereby these medical\ncomorbid conditions are more likely to be associated with microalbumi-\nnuria than AMD, we elected to use nested case\u00adcontrol methodology with\nvariable control optimal matching [21]. Prior to matching, individuals with\nand without AMD were compared using analysis of variance and Wald\nchi-square tests. To obtain a matched cohort for individuals with late\nAMD, we performed variable control optimal matching with exact match-\ning on sex, race and age (within 1 year) to obtain five controls without\nAMD for each case. To obtain a matched cohort for individuals with either\nearly or late AMD, we again performed variable control optimal matching\nwith exact matching on sex, race and age (within 2 years) in order to obtain\none control for each case. We performed univariate conditional logistic\nregression on the matched case\u00adcontrol data to assess differences.\nMultivariable analyses further adjusted for variables with P < 0.10\nin univariate models. Candidate variables included those described in\nTable 1. Due to the strong association with microalbuminuria and kidney\ndisease, diabetes was included in all multivariable models. Sensitivity\nanalyses were performed that excluded individuals with diabetes; these\nanalyses were otherwise identical to those described above with the ex-\nception that we obtained only four controls for each late AMD case. All\nanalyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (Cary, NC).\nResults\nAmong 8603 NHANES III participants with fundus pho-\ntography, 8208 were gradable as none, early or late AMD.\nAfter excluding participants missing data on serum creati-\nsified as early AMD and 51 (0.7%) as late AMD (Table 1).\nLate AMD\nAs the youngest NHANES participant diagnosed with late\nAMD was 59 years old, we limited the control population\nto NHANES III participants aged 59 years or older, result-\ning in 3227 available controls. Table 2 presents the results\nof 5:1 matching. Cases and controls were similar in base-\nline characteristics, although individuals with late AMD\nwere more likely to have a history of hypertension (78.0\ntional logistic regression models, history of hypertension\n[odds ratio (OR) \u00bc 2.24, 95% confidence interval (CI):\nassociated with the presence of late AMD, while there\nwas no association of microalbuminuria (P \u00bc 0.60) or\nlog-transformed ACR (P \u00bc 0.93) with late AMD.

Major findings in the current study include (i) indi-\ntimes increased risk of late AMD compared to no AMD;\n(ii) albuminuria was not significantly associated with late\nAMD; (iii) albuminuria had a borderline association with\nany AMD that was statistically significant in a sensitivity\nanalysis evaluating individuals without diabetes and\n(iv) eGFR was not significantly associated with the pres-\nence of any AMD, although, in most analyses, hyperten-\nsion was associated with AMD. Of note, analyses\nevaluating late AMD were limited by the relatively small\nnumber of NHANES III participants with this condition.\nWhy might kidney disease and AMD be associated with\neach other? Firstly, CKD and AMD share cardiovascular\nrisk factors, most notably hypertension [22, 23]. Potentially\nunderlying this association is the hypothesis that athero-\nsclerosis of the choroidal circulation may contribute to\nthe development of AMD [11, 24]. Secondly, albuminuria,\nthe most common indicator of kidney damage, is a power-\nful marker for systemic epithelial burden in the microvas-\nculature of the kidney; critically, microvascular disease\ninvolving smaller vessels in retinal circulation, specifically\nthe retinal pigment epithelium in the eye, may be an im-\ngest a potential shared genetic predisposition for dense\ndeposit diseases of the eyes and of the kidneys that are\nrelated to key pathways for complement activation, with\nvariants in complement factor H, complement factor I and\ncomplement three genes accounting for a significant pro-\nThe latter relationship between kidney disease and AMD\nis particularly interesting, given the relationship of poly-\nmorphisms both in the complement Factor H gene and\nelsewhere in the complement pathway with kidney diseases\nlike thrombotic microangiopathy (specifically aHUS)\n[3, 31] and dense deposit disease [6, 8]. Factor H has three\nprimary functions: (i) it is a cofactor for the serine protease,\nFactor I, which cleaves C3b; (ii) it prevents amplification\nTable 5.

Relative\ndeficiencies in complement Factor H can result in excessive\nalternative pathway activation, particularly in times of\nstress, and promote both thrombotic microangiopathy as\nwell as debris deposition.\nReflecting interest in the genetic links as well as cardio-\nvascular links between kidney disease and AMD, several\ncohort studies have explored the longitudinal relationship\nbetween kidney function and AMD. A post hoc analysis of\nthe Australian Blue Mountains Eye Study cohort evaluated\nincidence of early AMD was 3.9% in participants with\nusing the Cockroft Gault equation and 17.5% in those with\nmodels that included a term for complement factor H\nY402H genotype (homozygous, heterozygous and noncar-\nrier), persons with reduced kidney function were three\ntimes more likely to develop early AMD than those with\n0.0001). Notably, no relationship was seen in the subgroup\nof individuals aged <65 years old. The other study exam-\nined the Beaver Dam cohort in Wisconsin, USA, and noted\nthat mild elevations in serum cystatin C as well as\nearly AMD but were not associated with incident pure\ngeographic atrophy or progression of AMD [12]. Higher\ncystatin C was also associated with incident exudative\nAMD in multivariable analyses in the Beaver Dam Study,\nalthough these analyses were limited by the relatively low\nnumber of cases (~60).\nOur study further explores the cross-sectional relation-\nship between kidney markers and AMD. Interestingly, we\ndid note a relationship between low eGFR and late AMD\nbut no significant relationship with albuminuria. There are\nseveral possible explanations for our negative findings for\nthe effect of albuminuria: (i) using a nested case\u00adcontrol\ndesign, we were able to effectively match for age, sex and\nrace, perhaps eliminating much of the confounds intro-\nduced by these demographic factors; (ii) there is a survival\nbias such that individuals with systemic vascular disease as\nindicated by albuminuria do not survive to develop AMD;\n(iii) the finding that diabetes is associated with a lower\nlikelihood of AMD may obscure this relationship, although\nit is also possible that this represents ascertainment bias as\nindividuals with diabetic retinopathy are less likely to have\ngradable fundus photography [16] and (iv) albuminuria and\nAMD are truly not associated. To more fully explore\nseveral of these possibilities, we performed sensitivity anal-\nyses excluding individuals with diabetes; results remained\nsimilar in these analyses, although the association between\nalbuminuria and the composite of early and late AMD\nachieved statistical significance, supporting our hypothesis\nthat an ascertainment bias may be introduced with inclu-\nsion of individuals with diabetes in the primary analyses.\nThe current study has several strengths. Most notable is\nthe use of a large broadly generalizable population. Addi-\ntionally, by using a nested case\u00adcontrol design, we are able\nto minimize the influence of confounding factors. There are\nalso some weaknesses, most notably the cross-sectional\ndesign and the lack of information on specific genes that\nmay impact both kidney function and AMD. Additionally,\nthere are a limited number of individuals with late AMD\nresulting in difficulty disproving the null hypothesis for\nseveral analyses; however, we used a nested case\u00adcontrol\ndesign to maximize our ability to explore the association\nbetween late AMD and kidney disease in this generalizable\ncohort.\nConclusions\nOur study revealed modest associations between reduced\nGFR and late AMD as well as a modest association between\nalbuminuria and early or late AMD in individuals without\ndiabetes. Although these results do not strongly support use\nof kidney markers as tools to identify a high-risk population\nfor prevalent AMD, they do shed light on what is likely a\nmultifactorial disease process with multiple factors affecting\ndisease expression and organ manifestations.\n"
