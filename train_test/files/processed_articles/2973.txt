Cen\u00ad sus, and surveys of sexual activity in adolescent women to es\u00ad\n\nFrom the Departments of Epidemiology, Pediatrics, and Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle; and Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, Washington\n\ntim te ge-specific rates of infectious syphilis, gonorrhea, and  pelvic mflammatory disease requiring hospitalization among\nsexually experienced  adolescent and young adult women in 1971\n\nand 1976. Rates of all three diseases were highest in adolescents and declined exponentially with increasing age. Age-related re\u00ad porting biases are unlikely to account for these findings. Aspects of adolescent sexual behavior and reproductive physiology are among plausible explanations. With the decline in age at first coitus in recent years, sexually transmitted diseases have become increasingly important factors in the health care of adolescents.\n\nADOLESCENTS are of special interest in prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The age at which women in the United States began coitus declined through the 1970s,1 while the rates of gonorrhea and syphilis were increasing, especially in adolescents.2 3 The consequences of STDs are especially unfortunate for young nulliparous women when they are rendered infertile by salpingitis or ectopic pregnancy.\n  Westrom and Mardh defined age-specific rates of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in Lund, Sweden, and en\u00ad virons by calculating disease rates during the early 1970s for the population at risk of developing PID, i.e., women who are sexually experienced. They  found that the risk of PID declined with age and that the risk of PID in sexually active 15-year-olds was ten times that in sexually active 25-year-olds.4 Surveys of the sexual activity of ad\u00ad olescent females in the United States in 1971 and 1976, 5 together with data concerning the incidences of certain STDs, permit similar estimates for the United States.\n\n\n  This study was supported by grants no.

Johnson and Joseph H. Blount). Gonorrhea has been reported by five\u00ad year age groups since 1971. Infectious (primary, second\u00ad ary, and early latent) syphilis has been reported by year of age since 1970. Cases of pelvic inflammatory disease identified in the National Hospital Discharge Survey since 1970 were reported by year of age for the relevant cat\u00ad egories from the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision,6 as previously described7 ( courtesy of Robert E. Johnson). A case was identified as PID if PID was listed as the first, second, third, or fourth diagnosis. The sizes of the U. S. female population by year of age for 1971 and 1976 were derived from U. S. Census\nBureau  projections.8  9\n  The estimated proportion of female teenagers in the United States who were sexually experienced in 1971 and 1976 was reported by Zelnik et al.5 by year of exact age from 12 to 19 years. The proportion experienced at age x was taken as the average of the proportion experienced\nat exact ages x and x + l. No direct estimate for the age\u00ad\nspecific prevalence of sexual experience of adult women over 19 years of age in 1971 and 1976 is available. We estimated this by linear extrapolation from the data of Zelnik et al.5 concerning exact ages 16- 19,5 the ages for\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1. Proportion of Women of Each Age Estimated To Be Sexually Experienced, United States, 1971 and 1976\n\nAge\n This extrapolation is an overestimate: see Discussion.\n\nwhich the increase in sexual experience with age was most linear. Age-specific rates of reported syphilis, gonorrhea, and hospitalized cases of PID divided by the fraction of women with prior coital experience in 1971 and 1976 yielded age-specific rates for sexually experienced women. The estimates of the age-specific prevalence of sexual experience obtained by this method of extrapolation were compared with an estimate derived from separate data. Hunt reported the prevalence of sexual experience for unmarried 18-24-year-old white women in 1972 to be\n\n\n70%.10 The 1970 U. S. Census reported marital status by race and age.11 Assuming that all ever-married women are sexually experienced, the estimated number of sexually experienced 18-24-year-old white women in 1971 was the sum of the number ever-married (from U.S. Census data11) plus 70% of those never-married.\n\nResults\n  The proportions of women of each age estimated to  be sexually experienced in 1971 and 1976 are listed in table 1. All women were estimated to be sexually expe\u00ad rienced at age 22.2 years in 1971 and at 21.6 years in 1976. Extrapolation from the data of Zelnik et al.5 gives an estimate of 87% of 18-24-year-old white women having been sexually experienced in 1971. Extrapolation from the data of Hunt 10 gives an estimate of 86% of 18-24- year-old white women having been sexually experienced in 1972.\n  Age-specific, experience-adjusted rates of reported fe\u00ad male cases of infectious syphilis, gonorrhea, and hospi\u00ad talized PID in 1971 and 1976 are shown in figures 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Power curves fitted to the data points are shown for syphilis and hospitalized cases of PID, and the data for calculating these curves and those for reported gonorrhea are shown in table 2.
