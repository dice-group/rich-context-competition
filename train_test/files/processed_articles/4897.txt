    "abstract": "Abstract: Sport fandom has received considerable attention from social scientists, yet few\nhave considered it from an evolutionary perspective. To redress this gap, we develop the\nhypothesis that team sports exhibit characteristics that activate mechanisms which evolved\nto facilitate the development of coalitions in the context of small-scale warfare. Based on\nthis by-product hypothesis, we predicted a correlation between fandom and binding (i.e.\ngroup-relevant) concerns, especially loyalty. To test this prediction, we administered\nthe Sport Spectator Identification Scale (SSI) and the Moral Foundations Questionnaire\n(MFQ) to 495 undergraduates. The MFQ measures three binding concerns, including\nloyalty, and two individualizing ones, harm and fairness. As predicted, fandom correlated\nsignificantly with loyalty (r = .27) and, within men, the two other binding concerns,\nauthority (r =.22) and purity (r = .24). By contrast, fandom did not significantly correlate\nwith harm or fairness. In addition, we predicted and found that men reported significantly\nhigher levels of fandom (Cohen's d =.45) and loyalty (d = .27) than did women. In\nconclusion, this study presents data supporting the coalitional by-product hypothesis of\nfandom and should spur further research using fandom as a window into our evolved\npsychology.\n",

Many travel long distances and pay large sums to watch \"their\"\nteams play, monitor them obsessively via radio, television and internet, and display team\nmerchandise prominently (Horne, 2006; Smith and Stewart, 2007). Because fans typically\nrealize no material benefits from their investment, this phenomenon seems puzzling from a\nrational economic perspective. In the last few decades, however, researchers have partially\nSport fandom and coalitional psychology\nresolved this enigma by identifying various psychological benefits of fandom, including\nheightened feelings of social connectedness, increased popularity, and boosted self-esteem,\nespecially after one's team wins (Branscombe and Wann, 1991; Cialdini et al., 1976; End,\nunresolved, including why there is such marked individual variation in fandom (Shank and\nBeasley, 1998), why men are more likely than women to be fans (Dietz-Uhler, Harrick,\nEnd, and Jacquemotte, 2000; Ganz and Wenner, 1991) and to experience their fandom in\nsomewhat different ways (James and Ridinger, 2002; Sargent, Zillman, and Weaver, 1998),\nand why many people strongly identify with sports teams but far fewer show similar\nattachments to superficially similar entertainment groups, such as regional orchestras or\nballet companies.\nWe propose that an evolutionary hypothesis--that sport fandom is the by-product of\nan evolved coalitional psychology--can address these issues and provide a more satisfying\naccount of sport fandom than has been offered previously. More specifically, we\nhypothesize that although sport fandom may not provide net reproductive benefits in\nmodern environments, it is the by-product of a suite of cognitive and affective adaptations\nthat would have generally increased inclusive fitness during human evolutionary history.\nThese adaptations would allow individuals to effectively form and maintain coalitions with\nothers, especially men, in the context of inter-group conflicts, often based on recurrent\nepisodes of overt aggression (i.e., small-scale warfare, Buss and Duntley, 2008; Keeley,\nThe coalitional by-product hypothesis of sports fandom is consistent with several\ndemonstrations that sports fans behave as if they were actual members of \"their\" team. For\nexample, Wann and Dolan (1994) found that highly identified sports fans evaluate other\nfans of their team more positively than fans of different teams. This bias has been found to\nbe robust with fans evaluating recruits (i.e. potential future players) of their target team\nmore positively than recruits of rival teams (Wann et al., 2006). Highly identified sports\nfans also view their team's games in a biased manner and are more likely to report a\nreadiness to engage in aggression against players and coaches of a rival team (Hastorf and\nCantrill, 1954; Wann, Haynes, McLean, and Pullen, 2003). Sports fans have even been\nshown to experience testosterone fluctuations based on their team's performance\n(Bernhardt, Dabbs, Fielden, and Lutter, 1998) highly similar to those experienced by actual\nparticipants in coalitional contests (Wagner, Flinn, and England, 2002).\nThe claim that much modern group behavior can be understood as a manifestation\nof a coalitional (or \"male warrior\") psychology has been developed and empirically\nsupported in several recent studies (e.g., Bugental and Beaulieu, 2009; Johnson and van\nthis logic to sport fandom and argue that specific aspects of coalitional psychology can\nyield sport fandom in appropriate contexts.\nIn brief, our hypothesis is that team sports, especially highly popular ones such as\nbasketball, baseball, hockey, rugby, American football, and football (soccer), exhibit\nseveral characteristics (Table 1) that facilitate individuals allying with teams in a manner\nthat is similar to how they would have allied with coalitions during human evolutionary\nhistory. In particular, we hypothesize that when individuals perceive that a male group is\nSport fandom and coalitional psychology\nemploying combat-relevant skills to compete against another male group for the purpose of\ngaining status, material benefits, and/or reproductive opportunities, they will frequently ally\nRegister, 2003; Otterbein, 2004). Because male mortality due to warfare is estimated at\ngroup would be crucial. Although mortality was generally much lower for females, they too\nbore significant costs in warfare including frequent capture and rape, meaning that allying\nwith a group would be vital for females as well (Ghiglieri, 1999).\nTable 1. Characteristics facilitating allying with war-relevant coalitions and sports teams\n1. Males in groups. The team sports that are most passionately followed are played by men. Warfare,\nalthough having consequences for all individuals in society, is almost universally undertaken by men\n2. Competitions based on war-relevant skills. Popular team sports (e.g. basketball, baseball, hockey,\nrugby, American football, and football) differ in many respects, but virtually all depend on war-relevant skills\nsuch running, tackling, checking, and throwing or dodging projectiles. Furthermore, all of these sports require\nthe differentiation of individual roles, coordination among teammates, and tactical planning. Relatively little\nis known about historically popular team sports, but the available information (see Guttman, 1986; 2007)\nindicates that they also depended on skills and tactics similar to those used in modern sports or else on other\nskills with clear relevance to warfare (see Geary, 1995 for an example utilizing baseball).\n3. Groups associated with geographical areas. Most teams are associated with (or \"represent\")\ngeographical areas that serve as a regular site of competitions and, often, as a source of players. Warfare\ngenerally involves coalitions making claims on, defending, or raiding particular territories (Gat, 2006; Geary,\n4. Visual symbols of group identification. Teams generally wear distinctive uniforms that feature the\nteam's name, geographic association, colors, and symbols. Hunter-gatherers frequently display similar visual\ncues to indicate group membership (e.g. dress, tattoos, jewelry; Dovidio Gaertner, and Validzic, 1998;\n5. Spoils following success. Teams that win generally enjoy heightened status and material rewards; this is\nespecially true for the most instrumental team members. Hunter-gatherer coalitions that win battles frequently\nAllying with a group might entail becoming an active member (i.e., combatant) in\nthe group, encouraging friends or family members to become combatants, providing\nmaterial benefits or other support to the group, expressing commitment to the group's goals,\nassessing the potency of the group and particular members, contemplating or suggesting\ntactics, displaying the group's symbols, observing the group's rituals and social hierarchy,\npromoting the group's ideology, derogating the potency, symbols, rituals, and ideology of\nrival groups, and, most crucially, psychologically self-identifying as a member of the\ngroup, even if one is not a likely combatant (Haslam, 2006; Tiger, 1969; van Vugt et al.,\n2007). In modern environments, allying with a sports team would involve many of these,\nincluding, of course, self-identification with the team (Figure 1).\nSport fandom and coalitional psychology\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the coalitional by-product hypothesis of sport\nfandom.\nWe address this by-product account of sport fandom by testing its claim that a\ncommon mechanism or basis underlies the tendency to ally with war-relevant coalitions\nand sports teams. Although the existence of such a mechanism might be addressed with\nvarious approaches, we will test whether individual variation in sports fandom correlates\nwith individual variation in what have been termed \"binding concerns\" (Graham, Haidt,\nBinding concerns have been characterized in the context of moral foundations\ntheory, which proposes the existence of five universally available psychological systems or\nconcerns that serve as foundations for humans' \"intuitive ethics\" or judgments about\nwhether any particular act is right or wrong (Haidt and Kesebir, 2010). The five moral\nconcerns are whether an act (1) causes harm or provides care (harm/care; hereafter\n\"harm\"), (2) is unjust or fair (fairness/reciprocity; hereafter \"fairness\"), (3) shows\ndisobedience or respect of authority (authority/respect; hereafter \"authority\"), (4) is carnal\nor pure (purity/sanctity; hereafter \"purity\"), or (5) shows betrayal or loyalty\n(ingroup/loyalty; hereafter \"loyalty\"). The first two concerns apply to all individuals (e.g.,\nyou should not harm or treat anyone unfairly) and are thus termed \"individualizing\"\n(Graham et al., 2009). The latter three concerns have been called \"binding\" because they\nare specific to the ingroup to which a perceiver is typically bound or situated (e.g., you\nshould obey \"our\" group's authorities, avoid acts that \"our\" group deems impure, and put\nthe interests of \"our\" group ahead of others'; Graham et al., 2009).\nProponents of moral foundations theory have developed psychometric tools for\nmeasuring individual and cross-cultural variation in the five moral concerns and\ndemonstrated substantial predictive power. For example, individuals who more strongly\nendorse the three binding concerns generally support more conservative political parties\nfoundations theory, we hypothesize that a crucial factor in determining whether an\nindividual will ally with a warfare-relevant group is their valuation of binding moral\nconcerns. In other words, we expect that individuals who more strongly value group\ninterests will be more likely to ally with groups (Figure 1). Of course, the by-product\nSport fandom and coalitional psychology\nhypothesis of sports fandom holds that the endorsement of binding concerns will positively\ncorrelate with sports fandom.\nThis prediction is indirectly supported by previous reports that sports fandom\ncorrelates with patriotism and favorable attitudes toward war (End et al., 2003; Jansen and\nSabo, 1994; Stempel, 2006) as well as political conservatism (Jost, Nosek, and Gosling,\n2008). To test this prediction more directly, we will measure sport fandom and the five\nmoral concerns. Although we expect that sport fandom will positively correlate with all\nthree binding concerns, we expect the relationship should be most robust for loyalty\nbecause it requires an explicitly between-group context, whereas authority and purity do\nnot. Conversely, we predict that sport fandom should not correlate with the individualizing\nconcerns of harm and fairness. Furthermore, if the correlation between sport fandom and\nbinding concerns is a specific one and not due to a general propensity to vicariously\nidentify with others via television or other media, then the positive correlation with binding\nconcerns should hold for sport fandom but not for other indicators of vicariously\nidentifying with others (e.g., watching television dramas).\nWe note that we will measure moral concerns with the Moral Foundations\nQuestionnaire (MFQ: Haidt and Graham, 2007) and that its loyalty scale is not, in fact, a\npure measurement of ingroup loyalty. In addition to items addressing ingroup loyalty (i.e.\nthose that refer to one's country, group, or team), there is one item that deals with abstract\nloyalty (\"Whether or not someone showed a lack of loyalty.\") and one which deals with\nloyalty toward family members (\"People should be loyal to their family members, even\nwhen they have done something wrong.\"). Because the psychological mechanisms involved\nin ingroup-relevant contexts likely differ from those involved in family attachment\n(Crittendon and Dallos, 2009), we predict that the family loyalty item will not correlate\nwith sport fandom.\nA second set of predictions can be derived from the assumption of variation in\nendorsement of binding concerns. In particular, because males are the primary combatants\nin warfare, they can be predicted to more strongly endorse binding concerns, especially\nloyalty. Moreover, males should be more likely to be sports fans, a prediction for which\nJames and Ridinger, 2002), but which we will seek to replicate. In fact, we predict that the\nsex difference in sport fandom will be mediated by the expected sex difference in binding\nconcerns (see Figure 1).\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nParticipants were 495 (307 females) undergraduates at a Midwestern\nUniversity. Their mean age was 18.9 years (SD=2.2), and they self-identified as\nWhite/Anglo-American (85%), African-American (7%), Latino (4%), Asian-American\n(2%), or Other (2%). Participants completed a set of questionnaires on computer terminals\nfor partial course credit. Data were collected during two semesters (spring 2007; fall 2007).\nParticipants in each semester completed the same basic set of questionnaires. However,\nviewing questionnaire. We pooled the data (sans television viewing) for analyses.\nSport fandom and coalitional psychology\nSurvey Procedures\nIn order to ensure that the surveys did not prime the participants, we had them\ncomplete the MFQ first, after which they completed several unrelated questionnaires. They\nthen completed a scale to assess their sport fandom (see below). Participants in the second\nsemester lastly filled out a short survey about television genres (see below).\nMeasures\nMoral Foundations Questionnaire\nThe MFQ (41-item version, Haidt and Graham, 2007) is designed to measure the\nrelative moral concerns of the participants. The first 21 questions of the MFQ asks\nrespondents to indicate how relevant particular factors are to considerations of whether\nsomething is right or wrong (e.g., \"Whether or not someone was harmed\"); participants\nrespond on a 6-point scale with not at all relevant and extremely relevant as anchors. The\nsecond set of 20 questions asks individuals the extent to which they agree or disagree with\nspecific statements (e.g., \"Compassion for those who are suffering is the most crucial\nvirtue\"); participants respond on a 6-point scale with strongly disagree and strongly agree\nas anchors. The MFQ yields separate scores for the five moral concerns described in the\nIntroduction. Evidence for the reliability and validity of the MFQ has been presented\nSport Spectator Identification Scale\nThe SSI (Wann and Branscombe, 1993) asks individuals to list their favorite team\nand then follows with seven questions (e.g., \"How important is it to YOU that the team\nlisted above wins?\"); participants respond on a 8-point scale, with different items having\ndifferent anchors (e.g., not important/very important, never/always.) Evidence for the\nreliability and validity of the SSI has been presented previously (Wann and Branscombe,\nIdentification with television genres\nTo address the specificity of the relation between sport fandom and binding\nconcerns, participants in the second semester responded to four questions regarding the\nextent to which they monitored four television genres (sports, news, drama, reality). For\nexample, the drama genre was addressed with the question, \"To what extent do you\nmonitor or regularly watch a particular dramatic television program (e.g., Desperate\nHousewives, Gray's Anatomy, 24, CSI)?\" Participants rated their monitoring for each genre\non a 4-point scale with not at all and a great deal as anchors. We asked the question about\nmonitoring a particular sports team on television despite anticipating that it would be\nhighly correlated with the SSI, which it proved to be (r = .55; p < .001). Asking this\nquestion allowed us to make a fair comparison (i.e., one question representing each genre)\namong the four viewing genres in the extent to which they correlated with moral concerns.\nSport fandom and coalitional psychology\nStatistical Procedures\nWe conducted all analyses with SPSS, with two exceptions. First, to test whether\ncorrelations differed significantly, we used SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc.,\nCary, NC). Second, to test for mediation we used software developed by Jose (2003).\nResults\nAs predicted, SSI (sport fandom) was significantly correlated with loyalty and\nauthority, although not purity (Table 2).\nTable 2. Correlations between Sports Spectator Identification (SSI) and Kinds of\nTelevision Viewing and Moral Foundations\nHarm Fairness Loyalty Authority Purity\nAlso, as predicted, SSI was not significantly correlated with fairness or harm. We\nrepeated these analyses separately for each sex and found that among males SSI was\nsignificantly correlated with all three binding moral concerns (loyalty, authority, and\npurity) but with neither of the individualizing ones (fairness and harm). Among females,\nSSI significantly correlated with loyalty but not with the other binding concerns or the\nindividualizing ones. We next tested whether the correlations between binding concerns\nand SSI differed significantly between males and females. We found no significant\ndifferences regarding loyalty or authority, but the correlation between purity and SSI was\nsignificantly greater for men than for women (p = .01). Finally, we found no correlation\nbetween the family loyalty item and sport fandom (r = .01, p = .84). Indeed, with this item\nremoved the correlation between the loyalty scale and SSI increased from .27 to .29.\nSupporting the first prediction regarding sex differences, and consistent with\nprevious research, males scored significantly higher on the SSI than did females.\nThe predicted sex difference in binding moral concerns was partially supported:\nmales scored significantly higher in loyalty, but there was no sex difference in authority,\nSport fandom and coalitional psychology\nand females actually scored significantly higher in purity. Females also scored significantly\nhigher in harm and fairness (Table 3).\nTable 3. Male and Female Moral Foundations and Sports Spectator Identification\nMale Female p-value Cohen's d\nNote: Table entries denote means and (standard deviations).\nTo explore whether the sex difference in sports fandom was mediated by loyalty\n(Baron and Kenny, 1986), we obtained zero order correlations between loyalty and sport\nfandom (see Table 2), sex and loyalty (r = .13, p < .01), and sex and sport fandom (r = .22,\np < .001). These results demonstrated that sex had a significant effect on loyalty and sport\nfandom. We then entered our data into a program developed by Jose (2003) to test for\nmediation. The results of Sobel's test confirmed significant partial mediation (z = 2.55, p =\n.01) (see Figure 2 for a summary of the analysis).\nWe next entered all predictors into a simultaneous equation to explore the relative\ncontributions and potential explanatory overlap among sex and the three binding concerns\n.001] and revealed that neither authority (p = .78) nor purity (p = .81) explained unique\nvariance in SSI, while both sex and loyalty did (see parenthetical  weights in Figure 2).\nCorroborating our initial results regarding the importance of binding concerns,\nreports of closely monitoring sports teams on television were positively and significantly\ncorrelated with loyalty, although not with authority or purity (Table 2). Also supporting our\nprevious results, watching sports teams on television did not positively correlate with\nfairness or harm. Supporting the prediction of a specific link between sport fandom and\ncoalitional mechanisms, we found that reports of monitoring other genres of television\nwere not significantly correlated with loyalty or the other binding concerns. Moreover, the\ncorrelation between watching sports and loyalty was significantly stronger than the\ncorrelation between watching any other television genre and loyalty (all ps < .05).\nMonitoring drama and reality television positively and significantly correlated with harm,\nbut these results do not bear directly on the by-product hypothesis.\nSport fandom and coalitional psychology\nFigure 2. Summary of mediation analysis with  weights in parentheses. The relationship\nbetween sex and sport fandom was reduced significantly after controlling for loyalty.\nSex\nSport Fandom\nLoyalty\nDiscussion\nWe derived the hypothesis that sport fandom is a by-product of coalitional\npsychology and tested two corresponding predictions. First, we found that, across\nindividuals, sport fandom correlated with concerns about loyalty, and that, among males, it\nalso correlated with authority and purity, two other binding or group-relevant concerns. By\ncontrast, individuals' concerns about harm and fairness, two individualizing concerns, were\nunrelated to sport fandom.\nSecond, we replicated the finding of greater sport fan identification among males\nand reported sex differences in moral concerns. Most crucially for the by-product\nhypothesis, males indicated significantly greater concerns about loyalty. This finding\ncomplements previous work showing that males possess stronger social dominance\norientation (Sidanius, Levin, Liu, and Pratto, 2000), a measure of preference for between-\ngroup dominance hierarchies (Pratto et al., 1994). We note that the finding of a sex\ndifference in loyalty also supports more general versions of the coalitional psychology\nOur finding that females scored higher in harm and fairness concerns was not\npredicted by the by-product hypothesis, yet it is consistent with many studies which\ndemonstrate greater empathy among females (Baron-Cohen, Knickmeyer, and Belmonte,\nalso not predicted, and we have difficulty explaining it. Nonetheless, the finding that\nauthority and purity were correlated with sport fandom across males, but not females,\nSport fandom and coalitional psychology\nsuggest that these binding concerns may have somewhat different bases in men and\nwomen. We speculate that in war-relevant contexts, the need to uphold one's group's\norganization (authority) and practices (purity) is more crucial for males, the likely\ncombatants.\nFinally, we predicted that the previously documented sex difference in sport fandom\nwould be substantially mediated by individual differences in loyalty. Although we found\nevidence of significant mediation, sex remained a significant predictor of sport fandom. In\nfact the ratio of variance explained indirectly (i.e., mediated by loyalty) to directly (i.e., by\nsex difference in sport fandom must be largely due to variables that were not measured in\nthis study. One possibility is that males are more sensitive to war-relevant cues (Table 1),\nsuch as visual symbols of group identification (cf. Appendix of Kurzban et al., 2001) or the\ndisplay of combat relevant skills, which most popular team sports emphasize (Sargent et\nAlternative Explanations\nAlthough the by-product hypothesis is supported by the correlation between sport\nfandom and loyalty, we must consider the possibility that this linkage could be caused\nspuriously, by a third variable. We certainly cannot rule out all candidates but some\nobvious ones are contradicted by the finding that loyalty correlates with monitoring sports\nteams on television but not monitoring other television genres and the finding that loyalty\nto one's family is not correlated with sport fandom whereas loyalty to one's group is.\nA more general point is that, by its nature, the by-product hypothesis allows that\nmany variables are likely be correlated with both sport fandom and ingroup loyalty. War\nmovies, for example, will include nearly all war-relevant cues (Table 1) and, as a\nconsequence, viewers with high ingroup loyalty will identify with the protagonists. These\nindividuals are also likely to be sports fans, meaning that all three variables are likely to be\ninter-correlated. Clearly, though, it would be incorrect to claim that the tendency to identify\nwith fictional characters causes the correlation between sport fandom and ingroup loyalty.\nAnother possibility is that \"socialization\", broadly conceived, could cause the\ncorrelation between sport fandom and ingroup concerns. In particular, children, especially\nboys, who are highly encouraged to play team games thereby learn to appreciate sports,\nvalue group loyalty, and adopt masculine dispositions (cf. Hartmann, 2003; James, 2001;\nenvironmental factors, including media, family and peers, probably do play a major role in\nproducing inter-sexual and inter-individual variation in binding concerns. Nevertheless,\nseveral lines of evidence indicate that an extreme version of the socialization hypothesis is\nalmost certainly false. For example, many studies have demonstrated that biological factors\n(e.g. prenatal hormones) can contribute directly to the production of sex-typed behaviors\nsex-typed behaviors, such as the spontaneous creation of competitive play groups among\nboys, cannot be readily attributed to socialization practices (Campbell, 2002; Geary, Byrd-\nCraven, Hoard, Vigil, and Numtee, 2003).\nThis discussion of third variables, although not undermining our conclusions,\nhighlights the need for future studies to formulate and probe additional predictions of the\nSport fandom and coalitional psychology\ncoalitional by-product hypothesis. These might include experimentally manipulating\nendorsement of binding concerns to test if this increases sport fandom, testing whether\nsports that include more war-relevant cues evoke greater fandom, and testing whether\nsports fans tend to be especially interested in and knowledgeable about warfare. We suspect\nthat additional predictions could also be developed regarding sex differences in sport\nfandom, particularly about the kinds of sports information that male and female fans\npreferentially attend to (i.e., outcomes or tactics) and the nature of their team loyalty. It is\nhighly desirable, of course, that future studies do not exclusively depend on self-reports or\nfocus on American undergraduates, two limitations of the present study.\nConclusion\nThe results of this paper are consistent with both a large body of research on sports\nfandom and coalitional psychology (e.g., Bernhardt et al., 1998; Geary, 2010; Wann and\nDolan, 1994). However, this paper is the first of which we are aware to make predictions\nbased on the explicit hypothesis that sports fandom is the by-product of human coalitional\npsychology. This claim might seem surprising given that journalists, coaches, and athletes\nfrequently employ war analogies to describe modern sporting events (End et al., 2003;\nTannenbaum and Noah, 1959), and numerous scholars have drawn connections between\nhowever, there have been few attempts to relate sport fandom, rather than participation, to\nwarfare (Barash, 2009; Lee and Smith, 2008). In fact, in reviewing scores of studies\nconcerning the psychology of sport fandom (for a review, see Wann, 2006), we have found\nnone that employ an evolutionary perspective or that discuss warfare, except\nmetaphorically (e.g., End et al., 2003).\nIn conclusion, this paper has made the first attempt to formally apply evolutionary\ntheory to sport fandom, a topic which has received relatively little scholarly attention,\napparently because it is considered too trivial to contribute to our understanding of\nimportant mental processes (for a discussion of \"domain denigration,\" see Rozin, 2006).\nNevertheless, if the coalitional by-product hypothesis is correct, then sport fandom should\ninstead be considered the modern embodiment of our evolved tribal psychology. Given the\npractical importance of better understanding this coalitional psychology, sport fandom may\nwarrant more scholarly attention especially among those with an interest in evolutionary\npsychology.\n"
