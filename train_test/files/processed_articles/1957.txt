    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nEmpirical studies have consistently shown that punitive damages are rarely\nawarded, with rates of about 3 to 5 percent of plaintiff trial wins. Using the 2005\ndata from the Bureau of Justice Statistics Civil Justice Survey, this article shows\nthat knowing in which cases plaintiffs sought punitive damages transforms the pic-\nture of punitive damages. Not accounting for whether punitive damages were\nsought obscures the meaningful punitive damages rate, the rate of awards in\ncases in which they were sought, by a factor of nearly 10, and obfuscates a more\nexplicable pattern of awards than has been reported. Punitive damages were sur-\nprisingly infrequently sought, with requests found in about 10 percent of tried cases\nthat plaintiffs won. State laws restricting access to punitive damages were signifi-\ncantly associated with rates of seeking punitive damages. Punitive damages were\nawarded in about 30 percent of the plaintiff trial wins in which they were sought.\nAwards were most frequent in cases of intentional tort, with a punitive award\nrate of over 60 percent. Greater harm corresponded to a greater probability of\nan award: the size of the compensatory award was significantly associated with\nwhether punitive damages were awarded, with a rate of approximately 60 percent\nfor cases with compensatory awards of $1 million or more. Regression models cor-\nrectly classify about 70 percent or more of the punitive award request outcomes.\n1 Eisenberg is Henry Allen Mark Professor of Law and Adjunct Professor of Statistical Sciences,\nCornell University; Heise is Professor of Law, Cornell Law School; Waters is Senior Court\nResearch Associate, National Center for State Courts; Wells is Charles A.

The data analyzed here were\ngathered under a grant from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and are archived at the Inter-\nuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research, Civil Justice Survey of State Courts,\neither the National Center for State Courts or of the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Earlier ver-\nsions of this paper were presented at the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective\nGoods, Bonn, Germany, at the 2009 meeting of the Southeastern Association of Law Schools,\nand at the Poster Session of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Legal Studies, University\nof Southern California, Gould School of Law. Eisenberg has analyzed the 2005 Civil Justice\nSurvey data in connection with an expert report for the estate of a plaintiff with a possible\npunitive damages claim.\nJudge-jury differences in the rate of awards exist, with judges awarding punitive\ndamages at a higher rate in personal injury cases and juries awarding them at a\nhigher rate in nonpersonal injury cases. These puzzling adjudicator differences\nmay be a consequence of the routing of different cases to judges and juries.\n1 Two major questions about punitive damages are whether they will be\nawarded and, if awarded, what their amount will be. The amount of puni-\ntive damages awarded has been consistently, successfully modeled as a\nfunction of the compensatory award.2 But models of whether punitive\ndamages are awarded have been less successful in explaining the pattern\nof awards. This is because punitive damages are rarely awarded (Eisenberg\net al. 2006), and rare events can be difficult to model. Studies spanning a\ndecade show that plaintiffs receive punitive awards in about 3 to 5 percent\nof cases they win, with the rate noticeably higher in financial injury cases.3\nStudies also suggest that when punitive damages are awarded, they tend to\nwhether punitive damages will be awarded.\n2 A limitation of most prior punitive damages studies is the absence of\ninformation about whether punitive damages were requested. An impor-\ntant data set from the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) and the\nBureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) allows fuller exploration of whether puni-\ntive damages will be awarded. The data set, which consists of civil trials\nconcluded in 156 counties in 2005, is the fourth in the NCSC-BJS series\nIn the 2005 iteration, the survey added a variable that recorded whether\npunitive damages were sought.\n3 This single additional variable has opened the curtain on the rate at\nwhich punitive damages are awarded to an unprecedented extent. It\nenables us to provide the first large-study insight into the rate at which\npunitive damages were sought in tried cases. The rate, about 10 percent,\nis much lower than many have believed. In tried cases in which punitive\n3 E.g., Eisenberg et al. 2006. Financial injury cases refer to cases other than personal injury cases.\n578 ~ Eisenberg, Heise, Waters, Wells: The Decision to Award Punitive Damages: An Empirical Study\ndamages were sought, and in which plaintiffs established liability at trial,\npunitive damages were not rarely awarded. They were awarded in 35.5\npercent (28.5 percent weighted4) of cases won by plaintiffs in which puni-\ntive damages were sought. This contrasts sharply with the 3 to 5 percent\nrate in cases won by plaintiffs, not filtered by whether punitive damages\nwere sought. The obvious importance of whether punitive damages were\nsought requires reassessing the factors associated with requesting and\nreceiving punitive damages. We find that the award of punitive damages\nis significantly associated with the level of the compensatory award. For\ncompensatory award cases exceeding $1 million, won by plaintiffs with\npunitive damages requested, the punitive damages award rate exceeded\n50 percent. The rate is also sensitive to case category and varies across\njudge and jury trials. Judges award punitive damages at a greater rate in\npersonal injury trials and juries award them at a greater rate in\nnonpersonal injury trials.\nPart 2 of this article first echoes speculation about the rate at which\npunitive damages would be sought and then reviews prior findings with\nrespect to the rate of seeking and obtaining punitive damages. Part 3\ndescribes the relevant aspects of the 2005 Civil Justice Survey and reports\nour core results. Part 4 seeks to explain the pattern of punitive awards as a\nfunction of case category, locale, level of compensatory award, propensity\nto seek punitive awards, and mode of trial. Part 5 discusses the results and\nPart 6 concludes.\nConversations with colleagues yielded estimates that plaintiffs would be\nobserved to have sought punitive damages in nearly every case. ``Just\nthrow the allegation into the complaint.'' ``It can't hurt.'' ``Malpractice\nnot to do so.'' Some of these reactions were from highly experienced teach-\ners of civil procedure. These estimates may have been informed by George\nPriest's 1996 study of three small Alabama counties, conducted in con-\nnection with litigation, that reported punitive damages claims in over\n4 Weighted results refer to rates that account for the sample design, which overrsampled cases\nfrom large counties relative to cases from smaller counties, as explained below.\nthat, as far as we can ascertain, has not been replicated in other published\nstudies. The Priest study did not report the rate at which plaintiffs were\ngranted punitive damages.\n6 In reviewing the literature, we found no prior multi-jurisdiction broad-\nbased study that assessed punitive damage award rates in light of the rate at\nwhich punitive damages were sought. But, in addition to the Priest study,\nsome prior locale-specific or subject-specific studies do provide useful\nbackground results related to this study. The prior studies' patterns of\nresults highlight the importance of carefully tracking what cases are\nincluded in the calculation of punitive award rates and requests.\n7 Using a Florida jury verdict reporter database available via Westlaw,\nVidmar and Rose (2001) studied punitive damages awards in Florida\nages were submitted to the jury and, if they were, whether the jury awarded\npunitive damages.

The table's last row shows\nthat, over the course of a decade, the possibility of punitive damages was\nsubmitted to juries in an average of 23.2 cases per year, and that juries\nawarded punitive damages in an average of 20.8 of those cases per year.\nThis is an overall average of punitive damages being awarded when sub-\nmitted in 89.7 percent of cases.\n9 David Baldus, John MacQueen, and George Woodworth used ``pub-\nlished sources, e.g., the West Reporting System, Westlaw, Lexis, legal trea-\ntises, and national jury verdict reporters'' to report on medical liability\ncases involving ``116 plaintiffs who sought punitive damages against health\nwere awarded in 88 of the 116 cases, or 76 percent. Punitive damages were\nawarded in 10 cases in which courts later ruled they were inappropriately\n5 The data were reported to have been collected ``for the case Gallant v. Prudential.''

That is five to six cases. The North Carolina\nstudy further reports that two jury verdicts of the estimated five or six cases\nTable 1.

So approximately\n40 percent (two of five) or 33 percent (two of six) of the tried North Carolina\ncases that requested punitive damages awards resulted in such awards.\n11 Denise Antolini used a personal injury judgments reporter to study\nThe study purported to examine ``the complete universe of 2,250 state\nsixty-three punitive damages judgments'' (Antolini 2004, 157). The pub-\nlisher of the verdict reporter, ``personally reviews the judgment books in\nthe U.S. District Court and the State Circuit Courts each month'' (Antolini\n2004, 212). Plaintiffs requested punitive damages in a little more than one-\nthird of the reported tort cases. Request rates ranged ``from an annual high\nrequested in about 37 percent of all state court judgments reported, in 15 per-\ncent of all Court Annexed Arbitration Program (CAAP) awards reported,\nalso reports that punitive damages were awarded in state court in 13.65 per-\ncent of the cases, in the CAAP in 8.39 percent of the cases, and in federal\nassume that punitive damages were requested at the same rate in successful\nand unsuccessful cases, which is a reasonable assumption based on the\nBureau of Justice Statistics data described below, then state court cases\nwere requested, CAAP cases yielded punitive awards in 8.39/15, or 56 percent\nof cases in which they were requested, and federal courts yielded punitive\nawards in 6.61/43, or 15 percent of cases in which they were requested.\n12 Thomas Eaton, David Mustard, and Susette Talarico (2005) provided\nrare empirical data about the rate at which punitive damages were sought\nin the mass of cases and not just those cases that reached trial or judgment.\nThey did not rely on available opinions or verdict reporters but scrutinized\n6 The database for the Hawaii study was based on Neal Seamon's Personal Injury Judgments\nHawaii, which contained ``all final judgments in personal injury and related tort actions filed\nin the state circuit court and the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii, except for class\n7 The trend in frequency of requests was downward over time (Antolini 2004, 221).\n582 ~ Eisenberg, Heise, Waters, Wells: The Decision to Award Punitive Damages: An Empirical Study\nactual records.

Punitive damages were\nrequested in 14 percent of the suits, and in 27 percent of the suits that\nthe author deemed to conceivably involve a punitive award (Hayward\nties, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Joaquin, and Sacramento, found punitive\ndamages claim rates ranging from 9 percent in actions against individuals\nin cases filed in San Joaquin County to 60 percent in actions against gov-\nernments in San Diego County (Sullivan 1997). The study does not report\nsufficient information to compute overall rates at which punitive damages\nwere sought.\nTable 2 summarizes the prior literature on punitive damages summa-\nrized here. Panel A summarizes studies reporting the rate at which punitive\ndamages were sought.

The 2005 survey expanded coverage by adding 110\ncounties to represent the 3,066 smaller counties not included in the coun-\ntry's 75 largest counties.9 The 2005 data included all completed trials in\nthe studied counties. Unlike the earlier datasets, the 2005 data included\na variable that reported whether punitive damages had been sought in\nBased on the sample design, the trials from the 46 counties are estimated\nto represent 10,813 general bench and civil trials disposed of in the nation's\n75 most populous counties. Trials from the 110 smaller counties are esti-\nmated to represent 16,315 general civil and bench trials from outside the\nnation's 75 most populous counties (Bureau of Justice Statistics 2008;\nauthors' calculations).\nOne important limitation of the data should be noted. The coding of\nwhether punitive damages were sought was based on an ex post reading\nof the case files and not on observing what issues were in fact submitted\nto adjudicators. Documents in the file, such as the complaint, were\nreviewed for mention of punitive damages. If punitive damages were men-\ntioned in a document suggesting that they had been sought, they were\ncoded as having been sought. But the data do not allow assessing whether\na punitive claim was in fact submitted to the judge or jury as fact-finder.\nThus, if a punitive claim were included in the complaint, but dismissed\nnation's 75 most populous in the 2000 census and was replaced by Mecklenburg County,\nNorth Carolina, and El Paso County, Texas. Two Maryland counties declined to participate\nin the 1991\u00ad1992 study, and were replaced with Fairfax County for all three iterations of the\nCivil Justice Survey.\nFor a summary of the data and methodology, see Bureau of Justice Statistics (1995, 1996, &\nsubsequent datasets, 1996 and 2001, include jury and bench trials.

This leads the models estimating whether\npunitive damages were awarded to be conservative. Since punitive damages\nwere sought in all the cases we code as having resulted in a punitive award,\nthe positive punitive damages outcomes would not change. But some of\nthe negative punitive damages outcomes are false negatives in that the\njury could not have awarded punitive damages because the issue was not\nsubmitted to the jury. Thus, our estimates of the rates at which adjudica-\ntors awarded punitive damages, conditional on their being sought, are\nconservatively low.\n3.2. The Rate of Seeking Punitive Damages\n18 Table 3 reports, by case category, the percent of all trials in which punitive\ndamages were sought, the percent of all trials won by plaintiffs in which\npunitive damages were sought, and the percent of trials in which punitive\ndamages were awarded, conditional on plaintiffs having sought punitive\ndamages and prevailed at trial. The overall rates are surprisingly low.\nThe table's first two columns show that seeking punitive damages is not\nvery common in cases that reach trial. In no case category did plaintiffs\nseek punitive damages in as high a rate as 40 percent of trials.10 And the\noverall rate for all trials was 9.0 percent.\n19 Plaintiffs sought punitive damages in only 10.2 percent of the trials they\nwon, not strikingly different from the 9.0 percent rate in all trials. These\nfigures increase to 11.5 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively, if one uses\nprobability weights to account for the different numbers of cases repre-\nsented by the large and small county samples. The rate is somewhat\ndepressed by the large motor vehicle category. Excluding motor vehicle\ncases, plaintiffs sought punitive damages in 398 of 2,768 trials they won,\nor 14.4 percent, which increases to 17.6 percent if one accounts for the\nsample design using probability weights. The table shows substantial het-\nerogeneity across case categories. If one separates judge and jury trials,\nplaintiffs sought punitive damages in 9.3 percent (11.0 percent weighted)\nof judge-tried cases they won and 10.6 percent (14.1 percent weighted) of\njury-tried cases they won.\n10 The rate slightly exceeded 40 percent for ``employment discrimination'' and ``intentional tort/\ntortious interference'' when the data are weighted to reflect the differential sampling of large\nand small counties.\n586 ~ Eisenberg, Heise, Waters, Wells: The Decision to Award Punitive Damages: An Empirical Study\nTable 3.

The Rate of Punitive Awards\nThe last two columns in Tables 3 and 4 show that, in trials won by plaintiffs\nin which they sought punitive damages, the overall rate at which punitive\ndamages were awarded was 35.5 percent. Accounting for the differential\nsampling of large and small counties yields an overall rate of 28.5 percent.\nThese rates differ substantially from rates based on punitive awards in trials\nwon by plaintiffs that do not account for whether punitive damages were\nsought. Since the tables' middle two numerical columns show punitive\nrequests in only about 10 percent of plaintiff trial wins, failure to account\nfor whether punitive damages were sought could be viewed as misstating\nthe punitive damages award rate--the rate at which they are awarded\nwhen sought--by about a factor of 10.\nThis dramatic change requires reassessing previous findings about\npunitive damages in light of the newly available information about\nwhether punitive damages were sought. We address the following top-\nics: (1) the relation between state law and the seeking rate, (2) the rela-\ntion between case category and locale and the likelihood of award, (3)\nthe relation between the size of the compensatory award and the like-\nlihood of a punitive award, (4) whether rates of punitive awards dif-\nfered between judges and juries and between personal injury and\nnonpersonal injury cases, and (5) whether the rate at which punitive\n11 The low rate of seeking punitive awards in the two Michigan counties may be due to limita-\ntions on punitive award availability in that state to merely punish.

We first explore these variables separately and then explore\nthem simultaneously in two classes of regression models. The first class\nof models, which examines whether punitive damages were awarded,\nincludes only cases in which punitive damages were sought and plaintiffs\nwon at trial. The second class of models first models the selection process\nleading to a request for punitive damages, including state regulation of\npunitive damages, and assesses whether punitive damages were awarded\nconditional on this selection process.\n4.1. State Law and the Rate of Seeking Punitive Damages\n24 At least two features of state law that we can account for can be expected\nto influence whether punitive damages are sought. First is the set of\nlegal rules regulating the availability of punitive damages. For example,\nif state law prohibits punitive damages, the rate at which they are sought\nshould be very low or even zero. Second is the incentive structure influ-\nencing attorneys who might seek punitive awards. In states where permit-\nted, requesting punitive damages may, in a first approximation, appear to\nbe near costless, requiring only the addition of words to a complaint. But\nsome costs nevertheless likely exist. An attorney's loss of reputation with\na judge may be a consequence of thoughtless punitive damages requests,\nand monetary penalties for frivolous claims can put a hard edge on the\nreputational blow. We assess these features with the primary goal of\nexploring their influence on the rate of seeking punitive awards. This\nlays the groundwork for the selection models explored in Part 4.6.\n4.1.1. State Rules Limiting the Seeking of Punitive Damages\n25 Plaintiffs generally cannot recover punitive damages unless they seek\nthem, and state laws differ in allowing plaintiffs to seek punitive damages.\nIn four states, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Washington, it is\ngenerally accepted that punitive damages are not allowed.12 Even in these\nstates, however punitive claims can appear in cases through the application\nLouisiana law unless provided for by statute); Corona de Camargo v. Schon, 278 Neb. 1045\ncontrary to public policy).\n592 ~ Eisenberg, Heise, Waters, Wells: The Decision to Award Punitive Damages: An Empirical Study\nof federal law or other states' laws13 or through statutes authorizing punitive\ndamages.14 In at least three states, Massachusetts, Michigan, and South\nDakota,15 state law restricts the availability of punitive damages but does\nnot prohibit them as broadly as in the four non-punitive-damages states. In\nat least seven states, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota,\nand Oregon, punitive damages may not be included in an initial pleading.16\nLeave of court must be sought to allow an amendment to the complaint to\nseek punitive damages. Thus, courts in these seven states preliminarily assess\nthe merits of a punitive damages claim before punitive damages can even be\nsought. We expect that punitive damages will be sought less often in these\n14 states. Each of these states other than New Hampshire, North Dakota,\nOregon, and South Dakota have some trials in the NCSC-BJS data.\nTo explore the relation between state law characteristics (prohibitions on\npunitives, limitations on punitives, and pleading threshold for punitives) and\npunitive damages outputs, Table 5 reports the rates of seeking and obtaining\npunitive damages by state. States with less than 100 trials in the NCSC-BJS\ndata are combined in the table into the residual category ``Other.'' Each\nstate in the table is represented by at least two counties in the data.\nFor states that we treat as generally prohibiting punitive damages,\nonly Washington is displayed in the table. New Hampshire has no\ncases in the data and Louisiana and Nebraska each have less than 100\ntrials in the data. Combining Louisiana, Nebraska, and Washington as\na group yields a punitive damages seeking rate of 2.27 percent (5 out\nof 220 trials), which is statistically significantly lower than the 9.13 per-\ncent rate in other states (p < 0.001).

If one limits the sample to cases in which plaintiffs won at\ntrial, the five states have a seeking rate of 4.08 percent (34 out of 833 trials),\nIf one combines the states with rules or statutory restrictions on punitive\ndamages (no punitive damages, restrictions on punitive damages, thresh-\nold pleading requirement), punitive damages were sought in such states\n(718 out of 6,350) trials in other states. Weighting the analysis to reflect\nthe differential sampling of large and small counties results in restriction\nstates having a seeking rate of 3.72 percent and other states having a seeking\nrate of 13.71 percent. If one limits the sample to cases in which plaintiffs\nwon at trial, the restricting states have a seeking rate of 3.31 percent (40\nout of 1,208 trials), with corresponding weighted rates of 3.60 percent and\n15.45 percent, respectively. We conclude that state rules restricting punitive\n17 These results differ between the 46 large counties and the 110 small counties but are in the\nsame direction for both groups of counties.\n18 These results do not materially differ between the large counties and small counties.\n19 These results differ between the 46 large counties and the 110 small counties but are in the\nsame direction for both groups of counties.\ndamages are significantly associated with the rate at which punitive damages\nare sought. This filtering mechanism is accounted for below in our second\nset of regression models of whether plaintiffs obtain punitive damages after\ntrial.\n4.1.2. State Sanction Standards\n31 In addition to statutory limits on seeking punitive damages, state law or\npractice may affect the seeking of punitive damages in other ways. Plaintiffs\nwith weak or marginal punitive damages claims may hesitate to seek them\nfor at least two reasons. First, an attorney who brings an objectively weak\npunitive damages claims may fear a possible reputational loss with the\njudge. The punitive damages claim will not only be denied but the judge\nmay treat other aspects of the attorney's case with greater skepticism.\nSecond, the attorney may fear the less subtle risk of being sanctioned for\nhaving brought a frivolous claim. We cannot assess the first factor but\nwe can attempt to account for possible fear of sanctions by exploiting\nvariation in state law.\n32 Following Byron Keeling's (1994) classification system of state law sanc-\ntions, we divide the states into three tiers. One tier consists of states with a\nhigh threshold for awarding sanctions. ``Typically, the states that follow a\nhigh threshold sanctions model require some kind of subjective bad\nfaith--or the absence of good faith--as a condition to an award of sanc-\ntions . .'' Other factors being equal, this tier might be expected to have\nthe highest rate of seeking punitive damages. Another tier consists of states\nwith a low threshold for awarding sanctions. ``[U]nder a sanctions scheme\nin a low threshold state, a person can be subject to sanctions if she acts\nunreasonably--regardless whether she acts in subjective bad faith.''\nOther factors being equal, these states might be expected to have the lowest\nrate of seeking punitive damages. A third tier consists of states with a\nhybrid threshold for sanctions, a threshold that falls between the high\nthreshold and the low threshold states. ``States that follow this model\npreserve an objective standard for the imposition of sanctions, but none-\ntheless, they incorporate into their sanctions schemes one or more\nprocedural devices intended to mitigate the repressive effects of the objec-\noriginal classification of states but update it to reflect changes in law since\npublication of his article in 1994. These changes consist mostly of states\nthat have since adopted the 1993 version of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules\n596 ~ Eisenberg, Heise, Waters, Wells: The Decision to Award Punitive Damages: An Empirical Study\nof Civil Procedure, which reduced the perceived chilling effect on advocacy\ncation is a judgment call and alternative classification may be reasonable.21\nThis three-tier classification scheme leads to states' sanction regimes\nbeing classified for purposes of this article as shown in the text note\naccompanying Table 6. The numerical columns in the table show the\nTable 6.

Classi-\nfication of the state sanction threshold is based on sanctions standards in effect at the time\nrelevant to the NCSC-BJS data. High threshold states are CA, CT, FL, ME, MA, NM, and SC.\nHybrid threshold states are AL, AZ, CO, HI, IL, IN, KY, LA, MD, MI, MN, MO, MS, NE, NJ,\nNV, NY, OH, OK, PA, RI, TN, TX, WA, WI, and WV. Low threshold states are AR, GA, IA, ID,\nKS, MT, NC, and VA. Note that AK, DE, NH, ND, OR, SD, UT, VT, and WY have no cases in\nthe data. Figures in parentheses are based on probability weights to reflect different sampling\nrates in large and small counties. Weighted frequencies not shown.

As expected,\nplaintiffs seek punitive damages at a higher rate in states with a high\nthreshold for awarding sanctions than in states with a hybrid threshold\nor a low threshold. The rate in high threshold states is about double that\nin hybrid states. Although the weighted rate of seeking punitive damages\nis, surprisingly, higher in low threshold states than in hybrid threshold\nstates, the difference is not statistically significant.22 The rate of obtaining\npunitive awards in cases won by plaintiffs does not significantly differ\nacross the three thresholds. We will account for the possible filtering effect\nof sanction standards in regression models below.\n4.2. Case Category and Locale\n35 Table 3's last two columns show heterogeneity by case category in whether\npunitive damages sought are awarded. In case categories with at least ten\ntrials in which punitive damages were sought, award rates varied from\n20 percent in motor vehicle, premises liability, and seller plaintiff cases\n(7.1 percent, 10.7 percent, and 9.3 percent, respectively, weighted) to\nover 60 percent in intentional tort (66.3 percent weighted), slander/libel/\ndefamation (hereinafter ``defamation'') (54.7 percent weighted), and con-\nversion (27.3 percent weighted) cases. For the case categories with at least\n10 requests for punitive damages in successful trials, a test of the hypothesis\nthat the rate of punitive awards does not vary across category can be\nrejected at p < 0.001. Intentional tort, the high-rate category with the larg-\nest number of trials, obviously has an element of willful misbehavior that\nwould be expected to support requests for punitive damages awards. Def-\namation, another high-rate category, need not be intentional but we sus-\n22 The low sanctions threshold category has eight states but two, Georgia and Virginia, dominate\nthe category. Those two states combine for 356 of the 442 (85.3 percent) low sanction thresh-\nold trials in the data. Eaton's survey of Georgia judges provides mixed evidence about the\nrate of frivolous litigation (and thus indirectly about potentially sanctionable behavior).\nEaton reports that more than 79 percent of the judges surveyed report not seeing many friv-\nolous cases but that 10 percent report that more than 20 percent of tort cases are frivolous\n598 ~ Eisenberg, Heise, Waters, Wells: The Decision to Award Punitive Damages: An Empirical Study\npect that plaintiffs upset enough to sue for defamation tend to ascribe\nintentional misbehavior to the targeted defendants. The low-rate catego-\nries, such as motor vehicle, premises liability, and seller plaintiff, do not\nclearly consistently involve egregious behavior warranting punitive dam-\nages and so the seeking of punitive damages in them is an important pos-\nsible signal about individual cases in those case categories.\nWe will further address case categories in this Part below by subdividing\nthem by judge and jury trials. We will also account for case categories in\nPart 4's regression models by using dummy variables for case categories,\nthough some reaggregation is necessary for case categories with relatively\nfew cases.\nTable 4 shows that punitive damage award rates varied by locale. It\nis desirable to account for locale in modeling punitive damages awards.\nTable 7. Rates of Seeking and Obtaining Punitive Damages, by Size of Compensatory\nAward\nCompensatory\naward\nTrials won by plaintiffs\nTrials won by plaintiffs,\npunitives sought\n% with punitives\nsought\nN\n% with punitive\naward\nN\n$1 million to\nor more\nNote.

Figures in parentheses are based on probability weights to reflect different\nsampling rates in large and small counties. Source: NCSC-BJS 2005 Civil Justice Survey.\nBut further subdividing the sample within locale by, for example, case cat-\negory or compensatory award level, is not useful. This is because the with-\nin-locale data are too thin to support further meaningful subdivision.\nTable 4 shows that only three locales, Los Angeles, Orange, and Fairfax,\nhad more than 20 plaintiff trial wins with punitive requests. And the resid-\nual locale of 110 smaller counties had only 97 punitive damages award\nrequests in plaintiff trial wins. The many locales and thinness of the data\nalso make it impracticable to include in Part 4's regression models\ndummy variables for each locale. We will instead account for locale (and\nstate) using random intercept models for our core results in Part 4.6.\n4.3. Size of Compensatory Award\n38 Greater harm can be expected to be associated with an increased likelihood\nof a punitive award (Choi & Eisenberg 2009). Table 7 reports the relation\nbetween the compensatory award and the rate of seeking and obtaining\npunitive awards in plaintiff trial wins. The table's first column stratifies\nthe sample by levels of the compensatory award. The table's next column\nshows a generally increasing rate of seeking punitive damages as the com-\npensatory award increased. The numbers not in parentheses show the raw\ndata and the numbers in parentheses show results weighted to account for\nthe differential sampling of large and small counties, a formatting conven-\ntion followed in the tables that follow as well. The two lowest compensa-\ntory award levels had the lowest rates of seeking punitive damages, about 8\npercent (14.1 percent and 9.5 percent, weighted). The two highest levels\ncent, weighted). With respect to the rate of obtaining punitive awards, the\ntable's last two columns show a general pattern of increasing rates of puni-\ntive awards as the compensatory award increases. The rate does not exceed\nweighted) for cases with compensatory awards of $1 million to $10 million\nand exceeds 80 percent (89.8 percent weighted) for cases with compensa-\ntory awards of at least $10 million.\n4.4. Judge-Jury Differences\n39 Differences in punitive damages awards rates between judges and juries\nhave been previously reported using Civil Justice Survey data (Eisenberg\n600 ~ Eisenberg, Heise, Waters, Wells: The Decision to Award Punitive Damages: An Empirical Study\nbased on knowledge of punitive award requests. Tables 3 and 7 suggest the\nimportance of accounting for case category and size of compensatory\naward rates.\nTable 8 refines Table 3 by dividing the case category punitive award rates\nby judge and jury trials. It limits the case categories to those with at least\nfive trials before judges and five trials before juries in which plaintiffs\nsought punitive damages and prevailed on liability at trial. The table\nshows a reasonably consistent pattern of higher punitive award rates in\njury trials. The overall difference is large, 43.2 percent (34.1 percent\nweighted) compared to 25.0 percent (20.0 percent weighted), and the\nTable 8.

Although too few cases\nexist in most categories for precise estimates, the overall pattern is clear\nand highly statistically significant.23\n41 Table 9 explores judge-jury differences by controlling for the size of the\ncompensatory award, again limiting the sample to case categories contain-\ning at least five efforts to obtain punitive damages for both judge and\njury trials. The table shows, for each compensatory award range, the rate\nof punitive awards for judge trials and jury trials. While accounting for\ncompensatory awards, the pattern of higher rates of punitive awards\nin jury trials is consistent for the unweighted data but less so for the\nweighted data. For the unweighted data, except for the small category\nTable 9.

For the weighted data that account\nfor the sample design, the rate of obtaining punitive awards was higher in\njudge trials in the reasonably large category of compensatory awards ranging\nPrior research suggests that jury and judge punitive award rates differ\nbetween personal injury cases and nonpersonal injury cases. In a study\nthat lacked information about whether punitive damages were sought,\njuries awarded punitive damages at a higher rate than judges in nonper-\nsonal injury cases and judges awarded punitive damages at a higher rate\nthan juries in personal injury cases (Eisenberg et al. 2006). We therefore\ndivide the information in Table 9 into personal injury cases and nonper-\nsonal injury cases. Table 10 presents the results. Panel A shows the results\nfor personal injury cases and panel B shows the results for nonpersonal\ninjury cases, again limited to case categories containing at least five efforts\nto obtain punitive damages for both judge and jury trials.\nThe results are consistent with results based on data that did not account\nfor whether punitive damages are sought. In personal injury cases, judges\nawarded punitive damages at a higher rate than juries. The pattern\npersisted for all compensatory award levels of $50,000 or higher, though\nthe relatively few judge trials suggest caution in interpreting this result.\nIn nonpersonal injury cases, juries awarded punitive damages at a higher\nrate than judges. This pattern persisted for all compensatory award strata\nexcept one weighted stratum. The personal injury case difference is signif-\nicant at p \u00bc 0.061 (weighted); the nonpersonal injury case difference is sig-\n4.5. The Relation Between Seeking Rates and Obtaining Rates\nTable 4 above shows that punitive damages were sought at varying rates\nacross locales. One influence on the rate at which punitive damages were\nawarded may be the selectivity shown by plaintiffs in seeking them. For\nexample, Table 4 shows that punitive damages were sought in only 1.8 per-\ntrials won by plaintiffs. These low punitive-seeking rates are accompanied\nby a high rate, 50 percent, of obtaining punitive damages in the 10 plaintiff\ntrial wins in which punitive damages were sought. If plaintiffs are more\nTable 10. Rates of Obtaining Punitive Damages, by Case Compensatory Award Level,\nMode of Trial, and Personal Injury Status\nA.

Rates of seeking punitive damages could be a function of local prac-\ntice or of state laws that are more or less restrictive about the availability of\npunitive damages. But the bottom line expectation is that the rate of seek-\ning punitive awards should be inversely associated with the rate at which\nthey are obtained.\nFigure 1 shows the relation between the seeking and obtaining rate. Each\ncircle in the figure corresponds to a locale's rate of seeking punitive dam-\nages on the x-axis and to that locale's rate of obtaining punitive damages\non the y-axis. Both rates are expressed as percents. The area of the circles is\nproportional to the number of cases in which punitive damages were\nsought in the locale.\nThe figure confirms expectations in one respect but not in another. The\nabsence of circles in the figure's upper right quadrant indicates that there\nwere no locales that combined a high rate of seeking punitive damages\nawards with a high rate of obtaining them. If one limits the analysis to\nlocales with the most cases (the larger circles), in no locale did a punitive\nFigure 1.

Source: NCSC-BJS 2005 Civil Justice Survey.\ndamages seeking rate of over 30 percent correspond with an obtaining rate\nof much more than 30 percent. And all of the locales with award rates of\nover 60 percent had seeking rates of less than 15 percent. These results are\nconsistent with looser standards for seeking punitive damages resulting in\nlower rates of obtaining them. But the figure also shows that the rate of\nobtaining punitive damages was not always closely tied to the rate of seek-\ning them. For low-seeking-rate locales, the range of obtaining rates was\nbroad. In particular, several locales combined low seeking rates with low\nobtaining rates, and this is true even for some reasonably large locales.\nWe include a variable for the rate of seeking punitive damages in the\nregression models below.\n4.6. Regression Models\n47 To further assess the pattern of punitive awards, we employed regression\nanalysis for two classes of models. The first class of models assesses whether\npunitive damages were awarded conditional on their having been sought\nand on plaintiffs having won at trial. It does not account for the decision\nwhether to seek punitive damages. The second class of models is also con-\nditional on plaintiffs having won at trial but expressly assesses whether\npunitive damages were sought as a function of the state law characteristics\ndescribed in Part 4.1. For both classes of models, the dependent variable in\nanalyzing whether punitive damages were awarded is binary--it takes on\ntwo values that are, effectively, ``yes'' and ``no,'' coded as 1 or 0.\n4.6.1. Multilevel Models of Whether Punitive Damages Were Awarded\n48 For binary dependent variables, logistic regression is the standard modeling\nwhether punitive damages were awarded, in addition to the factors consid-\nered above (case category, locale, compensatory award amount, judge vs.\njury trial, personal injury vs. nonpersonal injury cases, and rate of seeking\npunitive damages), regression models need to account for the sample design.\nThe sample has two distinct features that require consideration.\n49 First, if one were to combine into a single model data from 7,682 trials\none should account for the differential sampling of the two groups of\ncounties. Accounting for the different sampling rates would be neces-\nsary because the penultimate row of Table 4 above shows noticeably differ-\nent rates of punitive damages in the 110 smaller counties. In the smaller\n606 ~ Eisenberg, Heise, Waters, Wells: The Decision to Award Punitive Damages: An Empirical Study\ncounties, punitive damages were sought in a higher fraction of trials and\nawarded in a lower fraction of trials than they were in the larger counties.\nAnd in most of the smaller counties, there was no case in which punitive\ndamages were sought. Only 36 of the 110 counties reported at least one\ncase with a punitive damages request. Due to the heterogeneity across\ncounty groups, we report regression results separately for large and small\ncounty groups.\nSecond, the sample is nested in that the individual cases are clustered at\nthe county level and the counties are embedded in larger geographical\nunits, states, the laws of which vary. In this sense, the data are amenable\nto using hierarchical or multilevel models that account for the structure\nTable 11 reports multilevel logistic regression models of whether puni-\ntive damages were awarded in cases in which punitive damages were\nsought and plaintiffs won. We limit the individual case category dummy\nvariables to case categories with at least five cases of punitive damages\nsought in both large and small counties. Other case categories are com-\nbined into the residual category ``Other.'' Models (1), (3), and (5) show\nresults for large counties and models (2), (4), and (6) show results for\nsmall counties. To facilitate judge and jury trial comparisons, models (3)\nand (4) are limited to case categories with at least five cases in which puni-\ntive damages were sought in both judge trials and jury trials. Models (5)\nand (6) further limit the sample to cases not involving personal injury.\nA consistent result across the models is the significant association\nbetween the compensatory award amount and whether a punitive award\nwas given. In model (6), with only 52 observations, the compensatory\naward coefficient is not significant but remains positive and large. The\nresults by case category are somewhat inconsistent across the large and\nsmall groups of counties. The significantly reduced rate of punitive dam-\nages in motor vehicle cases (compared to the reference category of all other\ncase categories) is attributable to the small counties as indicated by com-\nparing models (1) and (2). The coefficient for the intentional tort category\nis much larger for the small counties.\nA reasonably consistent result is the increased rate of punitive awards in\njury-tried cases. It is statistically significant in the large county models and\nsubstantial although insignificant in the smaller county models. The large-\ncounty models that include a jury trial dummy variable suggest that the\ncase-category effects may be collinear with the jury trial effects or that\nTable 11.

No case category is statistically sig-\nnificant once one includes the jury trial dummy variable, as in models (3)\nand (5). Model (5) confirms the finding of a higher punitive damages\naward rate in jury trials in nonpersonal injury cases.\nTo visually assess the probability of a punitive award as a function of the\ncompensatory award, we used logistic regression on the combined large and\nsmall county samples and used probability weights to account for the differ-\nential sampling rates. The model included only the compensatory award as\nan explanatory variable and clustered the standard errors by locale. The\nresulting linear predictions and 95 percent prediction bands for judge and\njury trials are shown in Figure 2. The x-axis is the amount of the compen-\nsatory award in a case, employing a logarithmic (base 10) scale. The y-axis is\nthe linear prediction of a punitive damages award that the regression model\nindicated was associated with the corresponding compensatory award. Note\nthat the data are thin for the high compensatory award levels for judge trials.\nThe overlapping of the prediction bands is evidence, also suggested by some\nTable 11.

Selection Models of the Decision to Seek Punitive Damages and Whether\nPunitive Damages Were Awarded\n55 Part 4.1 shows that the rate of seeking punitive damages is not uniform\nacross states. State laws and procedural rules restricting punitive damages'\navailability are strongly associated with whether punitive damages are\nsought. To account for the influence of state law on whether plaintiffs\nsought punitive damages, we employ Heckman selection models to\nmodel the decision to seek punitive damages simultaneously with whether\npunitive damages were awarded. For purposes of the selection models, the\nstate laws and rules addressed above have the useful feature that they likely\ninfluence the decision whether to seek punitive damages but, once puni-\ntives have been sought, they have no direct influence on whether punitive\ndamages were awarded. We add to the selection stage dummy variables for\ncase categories. We also include in some models a dummy variable for\nFigure 2.

We restrict the sample to cases in which\nplaintiffs won at trial and again report results separately for large and small\nTable 12 reports the results. As in Table 11, we report results separately\nfor large and small counties. Models (1), (3), and (5) show results for large\ncounties and models (2), (4), and (6) show results for small counties. To\nfacilitate judge and jury trial comparisons, models (3) and (4) are limited\nto case categories with at least five cases in which punitive damages were\nsought in both judge trials and jury trials. Models (3) and (4) also include\na jury trial dummy variable in the award equation. Models (5) and (6) are\nthe same as models (3) and (4) except that they include the jury dummy\nvariable in the selection equation. In models (3) to (6), we aggregate the\ncase category dummy variables in the award equation to match the catego-\nries in Table 11. Other case categories are combined into the residual ref-\nerence category. The case category dummies are not as reaggregated in the\nselection equation, where there are more observations.\nThe correlation between the residuals in the award and selection equa-\ntions, as measured by the parameter r, is not significant in any model. So\nthe selection analysis provides no evidence questioning the single-equation\nprobability-of-award results in Table 11. And the results are reasonably\nconsistent with those in Table 11. In the award equation, the coefficient\nfor the compensatory award is always positive and significant for the\nlarge counties, and marginally significant or of greater magnitude for the\nsmall counties. The jury dummy variable is positive and significant or mar-\nginally significant in the award equation. In results not reported here, in\nmodels limited to nonpersonal injury cases, the results are essentially the\nsame as in Table 11's models (5) and (6).\nTable 12's selection equations confirm that state laws regulating punitive\ndamages are substantially associated with the rate at which punitive dam-\nages are sought. With one exception, all of the state law variables behave as\nexpected.

In small counties, states with a high sanctions\nthreshold have a higher probability of a punitive damages award request\ncompared to states with a low sanctions threshold.\n59 The one initially puzzling result is that, in the large county models, states\nwith a high sanctions threshold did not have a higher probability of seeking\na punitive award than states with a low sanctions threshold. This result\nappears to be a consequence of differences between large and small coun-\nties in Georgia and Virginia. These two states combine for 85.3 percent of\nthe low sanctions threshold trials in the data (see note 22 above). For the\nsample of large counties, Table 4 above shows that Georgia and Virginia\nare represented by Fulton County Superior Court (Atlanta) and Fairfax\nCounty (in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area), respectively. These\ncounties differ significantly in the punitive damages seeking rate from\nother counties in the same states. In Fulton County, 32.5 percent (13 of\n40) of the trials contained a punitive damages request compared to 12.9\nTable 12.

So the regression models' low sanctions threshold results for\nlarge counties are likely telling more of a story of the differences between\nGeorgia and Virginia counties than about sanctions generally.\nOne key finding is the surprisingly low rate at which punitive damages\nwere sought. As noted above, some of our civil procedure colleagues casu-\nally forecast that seeking punitive damages would be overwhelming com-\nmon. Yet the rate of seeking punitive damages in tried cases was only 11.5\n(weighted). Nontrivial portions of the variation in the rates of seeking\npunitive awards are explained by state law variation in access to punitive\ndamages.\nThe results are consistent with Table 1 above showing that Vidmar and\nRose, using a jury verdict reporter, reported only 23.2 Florida cases per\nyear as submitting punitive damages issue to juries. Antolini's results in\nHawaii varied by adjudicatory forum. The rate of seeking punitive damages\nthere seemed higher than the rates in this study. But note that Table 4 shows\nthat the rate of seeking punitive awards in Honolulu, the only Hawaii venue\nin the 2005 data, was 22.2 percent, above the average rate in other counties.\nOne question is whether the seeking rate differs in cases that do not\nreach trial. As the Supreme Court observed in Exxon Shipping Co. v.\nBaker, the available evidence does not support substantially different\nrates in cases that settle.25 As noted above, Eaton, Mustard, and Talarico\nreport an overall seeking rate of 14.7 percent in a comprehensive study\nof Georgia tort cases. The rate for all 141 cases across all Georgia sites\nin the 2005 data studied here was 18.4 percent. If anything, this suggests\nthat punitive damages were sought at slightly higher rates in tried cases\nthan in cases that did not reach trial. Herbert Kritzer and Frances Zemans\n(1998) similarly found little evidence of a settlement effect.26 This restraint\n26 Kritzer & Zemans (1998, 160): ``with perhaps one exception, what little systematic evidence\nwe could find does not support the notion'' (emphasis deleted).\nby lawyers in seeking punitive damages has not heretofore been so broadly\ndocumented.\n63 A second key finding is that the punitive award rate was substantial in\ncases won by plaintiffs in which punitive damages were sought. The sub-\nstantial rate contrasts with low rates of punitive awards in previous data\nsets lacking information about cases in which punitive damages were\nsought. The finding of substantial punitive award rates in cases in which\nthey were sought is consistent with the limited prior reports of punitive\ndamages award rates.\n64 Table 1 above shows that Vidmar and Rose also found that punitive\ndamages awards were not rare in cases in which the issue of punitive\ndamages was submitted to juries. The table's last row shows that, over\nthe course of a decade, the possibility of punitive damages was submitted\nto juries in an average of 23.2 cases per year, and that juries awarded\npunitive damages in an average of 20.8 of those cases per year. This is\nan overall average of punitive damages being awarded when submitted\nin 89.7 percent. Baldus, MacQueen, and Woodworth similarly reported\na high rate of obtaining punitive awards in medical malpractice cases.\nThe Vidmar study of North Carolina medical malpractice cases, dis-\ncussed in Part 2, yielded few punitive award cases. But the rate of punitive\nawards was not materially different from the rate across the range of\npunitive award cases in the 2005 Civil Justice Survey data. Our estimates\nof the rate of punitive awards in Antolini's Hawaii data yielded a state\ncourt estimated rate of 37 percent, similar to that found in this study\nof state courts.\n65 A third key finding is the strong association between the size of the com-\npensatory award and the award of punitive damages. Other studies have\nnot stratified by the size of the compensatory award, so direct comparisons\nof rates by award levels are not feasible. The high rate of punitive awards in\nthe Vidmar-Rose Florida study is similar to the 88.9 percent rate at which\npunitive damages were awarded in cases in which they were sought in the\n2005 Civil Justice Survey data when the compensatory award exceeded $10\nmillion. But the amounts at stake in the Vidmar and Rose data were con-\nsiderably smaller. The median total award in their data was about $612,000\n501). Their high rate of obtaining punitive awards in lower stakes cases\nmay be a consequence of the filtering of cases by the jury verdict reporter\nthey relied on.\n616 ~ Eisenberg, Heise, Waters, Wells: The Decision to Award Punitive Damages: An Empirical Study\nWe estimated in Part 2 that Vidmar's North Carolina medical malprac-\ntice study showed about a 33 to 40 percent chance of an award of punitive\ninconsistent with the rate found here for fairly low compensatory award\ncases. The North Carolina medical verdicts included only 3 of 21 cases\nwith awards of $1 million or more and no cases with compensatory awards\nA fourth finding of interest is the variation across judge and jury trials.\nThe findings here confirm prior findings of an overall higher rate of puni-\ntive awards in jury trials, with the previously noted qualification that the\nrelative rates flip when one moves from nonpersonal injury cases to per-\nsonal injury cases (Eisenberg et al. 2006).\nThe judge-jury findings are the most puzzling of our results. The low\npunitive-seeking rate is surprising but reasonably consistent with prior\nstudies other than Priest's Alabama results. Associations between the pres-\nence of a punitive award and both case categories and compensatory award\nlevels are consistent with a punitive damages framework in which more\negregious behavior is more likely to elicit punishment. The judge-jury dif-\nferences, in contrast, have no such simple explanation. The implausibility\nof judges being more sympathetic to punitive awards than juries in per-\nsonal injury cases leads us to suspect that the judge-jury difference in\nrates is at least partly attributable to how the parties select cases for routing\nto judge or jury trial,27 though this suggestion requires further exploration.\nWe also note the departures from a monolithic judge-jury pattern evidenced\nby some compensatory award strata have higher weighted punitive award\nrates in judge trials in Table 9 and by the crossing of lines in Figure 2.\nThe addition to the 2005 Civil Justice Survey of information about whether\npunitive damages were sought transforms the picture of punitive damages\nin state courts. Punitive damages were rarely sought in tried cases, were\nfrequently awarded when requested, and were significantly associated\nwith the level of the compensatory award. None of these results has been\n27 See Clermont & Eisenberg 1992, explaining higher plaintiff win rate in judge trials in products\nliability and medical malpractice cases as being partly attributable to the routing of cases\nbetween judges and juries.\npreviously reported in such a comprehensive sample. Both the traditional,\ncasual view that punitive damages are regularly sought, and the empirically-\nbased view that punitive damages are rarely awarded, and therefore\ndifficult to model, have to be reassessed in light of the 2005 data. These\ndata suggest a heretofore undocumented regularity in the rate at which\npunitive damages have been awarded.\nREFERENCES\nAntolini, Denise E. 2004.
