This research examines how the trajectories of self-rated health evolve among elderly Japanese individuals\nand how socioeconomic status (SES), social relations, and baseline health differentiate these trajectories.\nMethods. Data came from a five-wave panel study of a national sample of 2,200 Japanese old adults between 1987 and\n1999. Hierarchical linear models and cluster analysis were employed to depict major patterns of temporal changes in self-\nrated health.\nResults. Overall perceived health becomes worse, but only slightly, between ages 60 and 85, whereas it appears to\nimprove a little bit after age 85. Underlying the observed age norm are four subtrajectories including constant good health,\nearly onset of perceived health decline, late onset of perceived health decline, and a course of recovery from poor self-\nassessed health.\nDiscussion. Diverse subjective health trajectories exist in old age, extending well into the 90s. Prior observations of the\neffects of SES, social relations, and baseline health on health states and transitions can now be extended to trajectories of\nsubjective health. Our analysis of Japanese data provides important benchmarks for comparisons with observations made\nin other developed nations.\nSUBJECTIVE ratings of health have been a focus of intense\nresearch in gerontology for decades (Maddox & Douglas,\n1973). They not only correlate cross-sectionally with diseases,\nfunctional status, and mental health but also predict mortality\nprospectively. Furthermore, people with perceived poor health\nmake more outpatient visits and use more hospital services\nConsequently, self-ratings have often been regarded as a valid\nindicator of health status (Ferraro & Farmer, 1999).\nEmpirical findings concerning how subjective health changes\nwith age are, however, very mixed. First, self-assessed health\nhas exhibited considerable stability over periods ranging from 2\nto 15 years (Idler, 1993). Second, older people are more likely\nthan the young to rate their health as excellent or very good at\nany given level of chronic conditions or functional disability\npositive association of age with better self-assessed health'' (p.\nS297). Third, perceived health worsens with age except at the\nadvanced ages (i.e., 70 and older) (Hoeymans, Feskens, Van\nden Bos, & Kromhout, 1997). Finally, according to recent\nmeta-analyses, subjective health declines with age, but this\ndecrement is greater in the old\u00adold (75\u00fe years) than the young\u00ad\nResearch on subjective health could benefit significantly by\nadapting a life course perspective (Clipp, Pavalko, & Elder,\nthe shape of intrapersonal changes or trajectories (i.e., intercept\nand rate of change) over an extended period of time. In addition\nto the age norm or aggregated health trajectory for the total\npopulation, one needs to ascertain the increasing heterogeneity\nof health changes in old age (Nelson & Dannefer, 1992). For\ninstance, some individuals have shown little health decrement\nuntil very late in life, whereas others have begun to show\nmarked impairment in middle age (Rowe & Kahn, 1987).\nIndividuals may vary not only in the initial state but also in the\ntiming, duration, and ultimate level attained for a given at-\ntribute. As a result, temporal variation in subjective health is\nbest understood as a number of distinct trajectories, whereas\ntheir average constitutes the age norm.\nExisting studies have yielded only limited information\nregarding interpersonal variation in trajectories of subjective\nhealth. In cross-sectional studies of health states at one point in\ntime (e.g., Ferraro & Feller, 1996), intrapersonal change cannot\nbe distinguished from interpersonal differences. On the other\nhand, some investigators have examined transitions in self-rated\nhealth between two points in time by using an autoregressive\nor residual change model (e.g., Hoeymans et al., 1997; Idler,\n1993). This approach depends on the covariance matrix of\nrepeated observations of the same measures (e.g., subjective\nhealth) over time, whereas the underlying growth curve or\ntrajectory is not analyzed (Rogosa, 1988). A more complete\nunderstanding dictates an analysis of the initial level as well as\nthe rate of change with age.\nThis research aims to contribute to current knowledge in\nthree respects. We first offer quantitative estimates of the\ngrowth parameters associated with the aggregated trajectory of\nsubjective health. Second, we delineate the multitude of sub-\ntrajectories underlying this age norm. Finally, we focus on the\neffects of socioeconomic status (SES), social networks, and\nbaseline health status in differentiating subtrajectories of health.\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nTo the best of our knowledge there has been no published\nresearch that employs growth curve models in examining the\nmultiple trajectories of subjective health.\nJapan provides a useful context for understanding how\nsubjective appraisal of health evolves in old age, particularly\nin contrast with the United States. Similar in economic de-\nvelopment, both nations are experiencing rapid population\naging. However, with the highest life expectancy at birth in the\nworld, Japanese outlive Americans by 4\u00ad6 years (World Health\nOrganization, 2004). Psychological processes in Japanese\nculture may differ significantly from those in European and\nAmerican cultures. In Western cultures, individual identity is\ndefined by personal choice and achievement, whereas in Japan,\na collectivistic model is assumed, emphasizing connections\nwith others, empathy, reciprocity, belongingness, loyalty, and\nrespect (Fiske, Kitayama, Markus, & Nisbet, 1998). Despite\nthese differences, findings concerning self-rated health among\nolder Japanese largely parallel those from the United States\nAs the vast majority of research on subjective health has been\nconducted in the United States and other Western developed\nnations, data from a non-Western country such as Japan would\nprovide valuable benchmarks for evaluating the external\nvalidity of current research.\nHYPOTHESES\nWe hypothesize that subjective health declines in old age,\nwith the decrement accelerating after age 75. Because the\nprevalence of health problems accelerates as one ages, it is\nmore difficult to maintain good subjective health (Pinquart,\n2001). Therefore, self-rated health is unlikely to evolve in\na linear fashion.\nWe also theorize that there exist multiple trajectories of self-\nrated health. Although many physiologic variables show\nsubstantial losses with advancing age, there is great variability\nacross individuals. Many people can be regarded as aging\nsuccessfully because they experience minimal physiologic loss\nor none at all in old age. They should be differentiated from\nthose who show nonpathologic age-linked losses. The latter can\nbe designated as experiencing usual or normal aging (Rowe &\nnormal aging from pathologic aging, which is a result of\nAccordingly, subjective health evolves along several path-\nways. Successful aging would suggest that self-rated health is\nconsistently good, stable, and characterized by only modest\ndecrement, if any, as one moves into the late 80s or early 90s.\nIn contrast, usual aging implies a similar course of subjective\nhealth but with an onset of accelerated health decrement in the\nmid or late 70s. Finally, an early onset of acceleration in\nperceived poor health in the mid-60s would signify pathologic\naging (Liang et al., 2003b). The notions of usual and pathologic\naging parallel prior observations that self-assessed health\ndeclines with age. However, investigators differ in their hy-\npotheses regarding whether such decrements become more\naccelerated or not in advanced ages (Hoeymans et al., 1997;\nPinquart, 2001). Other types of trajectories might also exist. For\ninstance, those with poor health initially may experience\nsignificant improvement of perceived health because of re-\ntrajectory of age-related improvement in self-rated health.\nIn addition, we aim to examine key factors that distinguish\namong these trajectories. Current knowledge is based almost\nexclusively on studies of health states at one point in time or\ntransitions between two points in time. It is presently unknown\nwhether the effects of these risk factors could be generalized to\nhealth trajectories. Nevertheless, several hypotheses may be\nadvanced by extrapolating from current literature. Important\nrisk factors for differentiating subjective health trajectories may\ninclude SES, social networks, and baseline health status.\nHouse, Lepkowski, Kinney, Mero, Kessler, and Herzog\n(1994) suggest that SES differences in health increase with\nage until relatively late in life. According to the theory of\ncumulative advantage, those with higher SES are more likely to\nexperience good health well into old age, whereas those\nwith lower SES are likely to experience significant health\ndecline (Ross & Wu, 1996). Health trajectories associated with\ndifferent SES diverge increasingly with age. Accordingly, we\nhypothesize that persons with higher SES are less likely to\nfollow a course of accelerated health decline.\nThe quantity and quality of social relationships have been\nwidely recognized as risk factors of mortality and morbidity.\nProspective studies consistently show increased risk of death\namong persons with a low quantity, and sometimes low quality,\nof social relationships (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). We\nhypothesize that those with strong social networks have\na greater probability to maintain good health into their late\n80s. We recognize that health may affect social relationships as\nwell. In this research, we focus on the effects of social\nrelationships on health.\nGiven the extensive research on the linkages between\nsubjective and objective health measures (Ferraro & Farmer,\n1999), we hypothesize that poor baseline physical health\nconditions (i.e., disease, functional status) are significantly\nassociated with an accelerated decline in self-rated health.\nMoreover, we postulate that poor baseline mental health (i.e.,\ndepressive symptoms and cognitive impairments) exerts\na similar effect, as there is substantial evidence that negative\nemotions and cognitions can lead to poor health (Pinquart,\n2001). Finally, we include gender as a control variable because\nmen and women differ significantly in self-rated health and\nvarious risk factors (Liang et al., 2003a).\nIn our specifications, we focus on the effects of various\nfactors on health trajectories. Given the prospective nature of\nour data (to be described later), the time sequence is well\ndefined. Theoretically, however, reciprocal causal linkages are\nlikely to exist. For instance, health trajectories may well in-\nfluence one's employment status and income.\nMETHODS\nSample and Data\nData came from a five-wave panel study of older adults\nin Japan. The baseline survey, conducted in November 1987,\ninvolved a national probability sample of 2,200 Japanese\npersons aged 60 and over. With a response rate of 69%, the\nsample was found representative of the total elderly popula-\ntion in Japan (Jay, Liang, Liu, & Sugisawa, 1993). After the\nbaseline survey, except those deceased, all subjects were\n1999). Proxy interviews were obtained for those unable to\ncomplete the survey themselves. In addition, a nonresponse\nquestionnaire was utilized to gather information in the case of\ndeath or other reasons for nonparticipation. A significant\nnumber of those who did not respond at a given wave were\nrecovered at a subsequent follow-up. Between waves 2 and 5,\nthe proportion of self-respondents ranged from 62% to 76%,\nwhereas proxy interviews varied from 7% to 13% and death\naccounted for 8\u00ad14%. Accordingly, we were able to keep the\nproportion of nonrespondents to , 10% of the total number of\nsubjects contacted at each follow-up (i.e., waves 2\u00ad5; Table 1).\nMeasures\nAs the dependent variable, self-rated health was assessed via\nthree indicators: (a) a rating of physical health (coded: excellent\n[1]; fairly good [2]; average [3]; not very good [4]; and poor\n[5]), (b) health comparisons with other people one's age (better\n[1]; about the same [2]; and worse [3]), and (c) a report of\noverall satisfaction with one's health (coded: very satisfied [1];\nrelatively well satisfied [2]; can't say [3]; not very satisfied\n[4]; and not at all satisfied [5]). Health compared with others'\nwas scaled to reflect a 5-point scale, and then the three items\nwere summed to form a composite of perceived ill health,\nwith Cronbach alpha values ranging from .82 to .86 across\nfive waves.\nGender was defined as a dummy variable (1 \u00bc female),\nwhereas SES was measured by education in terms of the total\nnumber of years of schooling. In addition, marital status and\nemployment at the baseline were included as dummy variables\n(1 \u00bc married and 1 \u00bc working, respectively). These can be\nregarded as indicators of social networks. Because the time\nsequence between these two measures and health trajectories\nis well defined, we avoid the possibility of endogeneity in\ncausal inference.\nWith reference to baseline health conditions, cognitive\nimpairment was assessed using Pfeiffer's (1975) Short Portable\nMental Status Questionnaire. A count of the number of\nincorrect responses across nine questions covering short- and\nlong-term memory, orientation to surroundings, knowledge of\ncurrent events, and ability to perform mathematical tasks was\nobtained. Unanswered questions were counted as incorrect\n(Fillenbaum, 1980). Depressive symptoms were represented by\nseven items (a \u00bc .807) drawn from the Center for Epidemi-\nological Studies\u00adDepression scale (Radloff, 1977). These items\nincluded the following: (a) appetite was poor, (b) sleep was\nrestless, (c) could not get going, (d) everything I did was an\neffort, (e) felt depressed, (f) felt lonely, and (g) felt sad (coded:\nmost of the time [3]; sometimes [2]; and rarely [1]). The\nselection of these items was based on findings that a brief form\ntaps the same symptom dimensions as does the original scale,\nand reliability measures indicate little sacrifice of precision\n(Kohout, Berkman, Evans, & Cornoni-Huntley, 1993).\nBased on a checklist of conditions, an index of serious\nconditions was generated by including diabetes, heart disease,\nhypertension, and stroke, whereas the remaining conditions\nwere grouped to be chronic conditions, consisting of up to 13\ntypes, including, for example, arthritis, eye disease, asthma, and\nParkinson disease. Serious and chronic conditions are measured\nseparately because there is some evidence that serious illnesses\nhave stronger relationships than chronic illnesses with mortal-\nity and self-rated health (Ferraro & Farmer, 1999). Finally,\nfunctional status at baseline was assessed by a composite of six\nitems measuring difficulties with activities of daily living or\ninstrumental activities of daily living (i.e., bathing, climbing\nstairs, walking a half mile, using the phone, shopping, and\ntraveling by bus, train, or subway) scored in the following\nmanner: no difficulty at all (0), slightly difficult (1), fairly\ndifficult (2), extremely difficult (3), and unable to do at all (4).\nAll mental and physical health covariates as well as the\ndependent variable self-rated health status were coded to reflect\ngreater morbidity, impairment, or poor health. Table 2 presents\nthe descriptive statistics of all the baseline covariates.\nTable 1.

With the exception of the deceased, all respondents (i.e., self,\nproxy, and nonresponse) were followed up at subsequent waves.\nbResponse rate 1 is computed as (Self \u00fe Proxy respondents) 4 Total contacts.\ncResponse rate 2 is computed as (Self\u00feProxy\u00feDeceased respondents) 4 Total contacts. In this context, death is treated as a type of health outcome that should be\nincluded in the analysis.\nTable 2.

For\nData Analysis\nHierarchical linear modeling was used to estimate parameters\nassociated with health trajectories (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).\nIn particular, individual health trajectories were modeled as\nfollows (Level 1 or repeated-observation model):\nA \u00fe eiA\nwhere YiA\nis self-rated health for Individual i at age A (at a given\nsurvey); p0i\nis the intercept of subjective health for individual i;\nis the rate of change (slope) in self-rated health for\nIndividual i across age; and eiA\nrepresents random error in self-\nrated health for individual i at age A.\nAn important feature of Equation 1 is the assumption that the\nintercept and growth parameters vary across individuals. Thus,\nthese parameters become dependent variables in the level 2 (or\nperson-level) model, where individual or group attributes can\nbe included as predictors. This is represented in the following\nmodel for each of the individual growth parameters:\nppi\n\u00fe\nX\nbpq\nXqi\n\u00fe rpi\nHere Xqi\nis a covariate (e.g., gender and education) associated\nwith Individual i, and bpq\nrepresents the effect of Xq on the pth\ngrowth parameter (ppi\n). rpi\nis a random effect with a mean of 0.\nFor the sample as a whole, both linear and nonlinear changes\nin self-rated health were considered. Linear change was eval-\nuated by estimating Equation 1 as it appears above, whereas\nnonlinear change was evaluated in a separate pass through the\ndata by adding one or more appropriate polynomial terms\n(e.g., p2i\nA2 for a quadratic age effect) to Equation 1. Age was\nlinearity among various age-related effects (i.e., intercept, linear\nand nonlinear effects).\nTo identify major patterns of self-rated health changes in\nold age, K-means cluster analyses were used to create categories\nof individuals with similar growth parameters from Equation 1\n(i.e., p0i\n). The goal was to choose a solution that used the\nfewest number of clusters possible to identify distinctive and\nmeaningful subjective health trajectories. These trajectories were\nthen used as the dependent variable in a multinomial logistic\nregression analysis assessing the effects of baseline covariates.\nFinally, to validate the identified subtrajectories, they were in-\ncluded in the level 2 equation in conjunction with various pre-\ndictors in analyzing interpersonal differences in self-rated health.\nItem Missing, Attrition, and Mortality\nTo minimize the loss of subjects due to item missing and\nattrition, multiple imputation was undertaken. There was little\nitem missing at the baseline survey. Missing values on all\nbaseline measures were imputed by using data collected in\n1987. Across waves 2\u00ad5, the proportion of cases with at least\none of the three self-rated health items missing ranged from\n17% to 25% at each wave, with the vast majority containing\none or two missing items. Different procedures were followed\ndepending on the type of response. For those with proxy\ninterviews and those who did not respond at a given wave, we\nimputed their missing values on subjective health by using\nbaseline data and prior observations of subjective health. For\nthose who died, self-rated health was imputed for the time\nperiod between the previous wave of data collection and death.\nThree complete data sets were imputed with the NORM\nsoftware developed by Schafer (1997), and analyses were run\non each of these three data sets. Parameter estimates and their\nstandard errors were derived by averaging across three\nimputations and by adjusting for their variance.\nFINDINGS\nAge Norm of Self-Rated Health\nWe examined the aggregate trajectory of subjective health by\nevaluating several progressively more complex (i.e., linear,\nquadratic, and cubic) models and choosing the most appropriate\nmodel on the basis of the statistical significance of various age-\nrelated effects. For the sample as a whole, the age norm can be\nbest described by a cubic function (Table 3). In this function,\nfixed effects associated with all growth parameter estimates\nexcept the quadratic slope are statistically significant (i.e.,\nhealth becomes only slightly worse, ranging between 7.388 and\nmuch confidence one should give to the parameter estimates,\nwe present both the total age range and the effective age range\nassociated with all health trajectories in Table 3. Although the\ntotal age range is from ages 60 to 102, the effective range is\nbetween 60 and 95 where at least 20 observations at each age\nare required.\nSubtrajectories of Subjective Health\nIn addition to the age norm, we examined the heterogeneity\nin subjective health changes. To accomplish this, the sta-\ntistically significant random effects parameters (i.e., intercept\nand linear slope associated with the aggregate trajectory in\nTable 3) for all respondents were subsequently subject to K-\nmeans cluster analyses. Because K-means cluster analysis\nrequires that the number of clusters be fixed a priori, it was re-\npeated with different numbers of clusters selected (i.e., from 2\nto 10). The goal was to choose the solution that involved the\nfewest clusters possible to detect distinctive and theoretically\nmeaningful differences in health trajectories. The four-cluster\nsolution seems to fulfill this criterion best. Solutions involving\nmore than four clusters generally contain minor clusters, which\nare very similar to each other. The four identified trajectories\nare described in the following.\nConstant good health. --Consisting of 899 respondents (41%\nof the total sample), this trajectory has a positive quadratic age\neffect (slope \u00bc .20, p , .001) and a negative cubic age effect\n(slope \u00bc \u00c0.05, p , .01; see Table 3). It is characterized by\na somewhat higher level of perceived ill health (i.e., 7.769) at\nage 60 and remains stable until age 90 (see Table 4; Figure 1).\nIndeed, self-rated health improves (or perceived ill health\ndecreases) slightly between ages 60 and 75, whereas it becomes\na bit worse between 75 and 90 years. Although this trajectory\ndoes not exhibit the best subjective health before age 80, it\nappears to mirror what Clipp and associates (1992) termed as\na trajectory of ``constant good health,'' which is quite similar to\n``successful aging,'' as characterized by Rowe and Kahn (1987,\n1998). Further discussion of our rationale will be presented later.\nEarly onset of worsening health. --This course is distin-\nguished by a positive linear age effect (slope \u00bc 2.08, p , .001)\nand a negative cubic age effect (slope \u00bc \u00c0.15, p , .01; see\nTable 3). Older adults following this trajectory have better\ninitial self-rated health (i.e., 6.388 at age 60) than those with\nconsistent good health. However, from age 60 on, subjective\nhealth begins to worsen steadily until age 85 (i.e., self-rated ill\nsample (N \u00bc 452), this trajectory can be viewed as pathologic\naging because of the unusually early onset of accelerated\nhealth decline.\nLate onset of worsening health. --This trajectory (N \u00bc 225 or\nquadratic age slope (.23, p , .001), and a negative cubic age\nslope (\u00c0.20, p , .05; see Table 3). After an initial period of\nexcellent health between ages 65 and 70, health begins to\ndeteriorate significantly thereafter (to an ill health score of\nRecovery from poor health. --Finally, 270 respondents, or\n10% of the total sample, had very poor perceived health\nInterestingly, their perceived health improved substantially in\na linear fashion (slope \u00bc\u00c01.48, p , .001) during the following\nPredictors of Subtrajectories of Subjective Health\nMultinomial logistic regression analyses were employed to\nevaluate the effects of key risk factors (Table 5). To control for\ncompeting risk of mortality, the four identified subtrajectories\nwere analyzed in conjunction with two groups of individuals:\nVariable Age Norm\nConstant\nGood Health\nEarly Onset\nof Decline\nLate Onset\nof Decline Recovery\nGrowth curve parameter estimates (Level 2 equation, unconditional model)\nIntercept\nLinear slope\nQuadratic slope\nCubic slope\naThere were 355 individuals (16%) who died between 1987 and 1993. Because they had fewer than 4 repeated observations, they were excluded from the growth\ncurve analysis involving a cubic function. Numbers of subjects of all trajectories may not add up to 2,200 because of multiple imputation and rounding.\nTable 4. Self-Rated Health by Age According to Major Trajectories,\nAge\nAge\nNorm\nConstant\nGood Health\nEarly Onset\nof Decline\nLate Onset\nof Decline Recovery\nobservations are required to estimate a cubic function, those\nwho died before 1993 had to be excluded from the analysis of\ngrowth curves. Within this context, early death can be\nconceptualized as two distinct health trajectories different in\nthe timing of death.\nIn contrast to the trajectory of consistent good health, older\nJapanese individuals with higher education have a significantly\nrecovery from poor health (eb \u00bc .922, p , .05), or a late onset\nof poor health (eb \u00bc .922, p , .05). These results are generally\nconsistent with our hypothesis that higher SES is less likely to\nbe associated with more accelerated health decline. However,\neducation does not discriminate between those with consis-\ntent good health and those experiencing an early onset of\npoor health.\nThere is some evidence that social relations reduce the risk of\nhaving a more accelerated health decline. Those who were\nmarried at the baseline are significantly less likely to have an\np , .01) and to have a late onset of health decline (eb \u00bc .487,\np , .05). In addition, employment at the baseline leads to\np , .01). Nevertheless, those who experience an early onset of\npoor health do not differ from those with constant good health\nin terms of marital status and employment.\nThere is strong evidence that poor baseline health leads to\neither early death or a course of recovery. In comparison with\nthose who enjoyed constant good health, those who died before\n1990 and those who recovered had more cognitive impairment,\ndepressive symptoms, serious and chronic conditions, and\nfunctional impairment (Table 5). On the other hand, older\nJapanese who experienced an early onset of poor self-rated\nhealth had more serious conditions at the baseline (eb \u00bc 1.392,\np , .01) than those with consistent good health. Finally,\nsomewhat paradoxically, those with more chronic conditions\n(eb \u00bc .659, p , .01) were less likely to experience a late onset\nof poor health than consistent good health.\nTo what extent are the effects of SES, social relations, and\nbaseline health confounded by the competing risk of dying\nbefore 1996? Ideally, the risk of dying was randomly dis-\ntributed, and thus the estimated effects of various risk factors\nwould not be biased. However, as shown in Table 5, this is not\nthe case. Those who were female, had more education, were\nmarried or employed, and had better health at the baseline were\nsignificantly less likely to die. As a result, the effects of various\nrisk factors are likely to be somewhat understated because of\nmortality. On the other hand, death during the periods of 1987\u00ad\njectories themselves.\nInterindividual Differences in Age Norm of\nSubjective Health\nWe also examined interpersonal variations in the age norm of\nself-rated health. If the identified subtrajectories of subjective\nhealth are valid, then we can expect that they will all have\nsubstantial and statistically significant effects on the growth\ncurve parameters. Indeed, there is strong evidence that this\nis the case (Table 6). For instance, early onset of poor health\nassociated with a higher initial level (i.e., intercept) of\nperceived ill health, whereas late onset of poor health is\nassociated with significantly better subjective health (b \u00bc\n\u00c0.1.60, p , .001). Furthermore, those experiencing early (b \u00bc\nhealth have a greater linear increment of ill health with age.\nFinally, older Japanese persons who recover from poor health\nexperience a significant reduction in perceived ill health over\nsubtrajectories, none of the slope parameters is significantly\nrelated to the baseline risk factors. This further suggests that\ninterpersonal variation in the curvature of the age norm is fully\nexplained by these subtrajectories.\nTable 5.

In particular, more depressive symptoms\nchronic conditions (b \u00bc .21, p , .001), and functional\nlimitations (b \u00bc .09, p , .05) at the baseline lead to greater\ninitial level of perceived ill health. On the other hand, being\nmarried at the baseline is associated with a relatively higher\nlevel of ill health (b \u00bc .23, p , .01). Furthermore, the random\neffects associated with the intercept, linear, quadratic, and cubic\nage slopes remain significant, even when all risk factors and\nsubtrajectories are taken into account.\nA major contribution of this research lies in its quantitative\ndepiction of the age norm of subjective health after age 60.\nSubjective health worsens gradually, but only slightly, between\nages 65 and 85. Interestingly, subjective health improves a little\nbit after age 85. This could be due to the fact that these\nindividuals were hardy survivors. This finding reinforces\nprevious observations that subjective health deteriorates until\nadvanced ages, where it becomes stabilized or even improved\nthis research is among the first to trace the longer-term\ntrajectory of self-assessed health in older adults. It offers\nvaluable benchmarks for cross-validating previous findings.\nPrior investigators focused only on the age norm of self-rated\nhealth, and there was little understanding of its underlying\nheterogeneity. This research explicates the considerable in-\nterpersonal variations underlying the observed age norm of\nsubjective health. We identified four subtrajectories: (a) con-\nstant good health, (b) early onset of poor health, (c) late onset of\nill health, and (d) a course of recovery.\nHow do these subtrajectories map onto the concepts of\nsuccessful, usual, and pathologic aging? ``Constant good\nhealth,'' as described by Clipp and colleagues (1992), is quite\nsimilar to ``successful aging'' characterized by Rowe and Kahn\ntrajectory qualitatively without providing quantitative estimates\nof the parameters of the growth curve. Our decision about\nlabeling various trajectories is based on a comparison of all of\nthem between ages 60 and 90. What we have found is that those\nwith a trajectory of ``constant good health'' do not necessarily\nhave the best self-rated health in comparison with other\ntrajectories before age 80. What is unique about this trajectory\nis that good subjective health is maintained well into the early\n90s. Whereas further research is clearly needed, this also\nsuggests that the typologies developed by Clipp and colleagues\nand Rowe and Kahn could be qualified with reference to the\nchanges in subjective health in old age.\nIn contrast, a late onset of perceived health decline seems to\ncorrespond to usual aging, whereas those with an early onset of\nperceived poor health mimic pathologic aging. Interestingly,\nthese two subtrajectories fit rather well with prior observations\nthat subjective health declines with age, and this decline is\ngreater in the old\u00adold (75\u00fe years) than the young\u00adold (60\u00ad75\nyears) samples (Pinquart, 2001). However, these researchers\ndid not focus on the timing of the onset of decrement.\nWhy were those with more chronic conditions at the baseline\nmore likely to experience constant good subjective health rather\nthan a late onset of poor health (see Table 5)? Before age 80,\nthose with a late onset of poor health actually had better self-\nrated health than those with constant good health (see Table 4\nand Figure 1). More chronic illness at the baseline experienced\nby older Japanese persons with constant good health may\nexplain this. On the other hand, changes in health conditions\nafter the baseline could be responsible for the late onset of\ndeteriorating subjective health. This suggests the need to include\nnot only baseline health conditions but also their changes as\npredictors of how subjective health evolves in old age.\nOn the other hand, there was a small group of older Japanese\nindividuals (12% of the total sample) who had an elevated level\nof perceived ill health at age 65 but experienced significant\nimprovement thereafter up to 90 years of age. This trajectory\nappears to correspond well to the frequently observed linear\nincrement in positive assessment of health (Idler, 1993). As\npoor baseline health led to either death or recovery, this group\nshared many common determinants (i.e., poor baseline mental\nand physical health) with those who died (see Table 5).\nNevertheless, how could one's self-rated health improve sig-\nnificantly with age despite poor baseline health? There are at\nleast two possible explanations. First, these individuals might\nindeed have experienced significant improvement in objective\nhealth, thus leading to better perceived health. This is unlikely,\ngiven recent findings reported by Liang, Shaw, and colleagues\n(2003) that, on average, there is an accelerated increase in\nfunctional limitations after age 60. No subgroup with\na significant improvement in functional status between ages\nSecond, the increased health optimism could be explained by\npsychological adaptation and social comparison (Hoeymans\nan individual may adapt to poor physical health and integrate it\ninto daily functioning, hence leading to improved self-rated\nhealth. In addition to physical health, many assess health by\nfocusing more on what the body can do, on social role activities\nthey are capable of, or on emotional and spiritual well-being.\nOn the other hand, individuals often interpret health infor-\nmation through a process of social comparison. People may\nincreasingly assess their health in reference to the conditions of\ntheir age peers instead of their objective health (Borawski,\nTo analyze how various risk factors are linked with\ntrajectories of subjective health, we follow a person-centered\napproach by focusing on distinct patterns of intraindividual\nchange (Crosnoe & Elder, 2002). The course of constant good\nsubjective health clearly differentiates itself from the trajectory\nof recovery from poor health in terms of SES, social networks,\nand baseline health. However, there is much less distinction in\nrisk factors between constant good health and health decline\nwith either an early or a late onset. On the other hand, relative\nto those with constant good health, those who were married and\nwith higher education were less likely to follow a course of late-\nonset perceived health decline. Although SES, social networks,\nand baseline health have long been shown to be associated with\nstates of subjective health and their transitions, we provide new\nevidence that these conclusions can now be generalized to\ntrajectories of self-assessed health.\nIn our analysis, the competing risk of dying was taken into\naccount when analyzing the probabilities associated with the\nsubtrajectories. In this regard, we differentiated those who died\nunique in that these two groups can also be viewed as represent-\ning two distinct health trajectories, and thus, we can examine\ncommon as well as unique risk factors associated with them.\nNevertheless, these two groups shared virtually all risk factors.\nThese individuals were included in our analysis of health\ntrajectories for sufficient data (i.e., at least four repeated\nobservations) exist on them. One may question our decision\nbecause these individuals were not grouped as a separate\ntrajectory, thus leading to an overestimation of those who\nexperienced various health trajectories. On the other hand,\nanalyses may cause us to overlook essential details concerning\nchanges in self-rated health prior to death. To address this\nconcern, we replicated our analysis by treating those who died\nbefore 1993. The results were nearly identical to those\npresented earlier. Although the age norm follows a quadratic\ninstead of a cubic function, these two functional forms are very\nsimilar because of a small cubic slope. More importantly, we\nwere able to identify the same four subtrajectories and, on them,\nthe similar effects exerted by the risk factors. Consequently, our\nresults are fairly robust regardless of whether those who died\ntrajectories or not.\nIn addition to the person-centered approach, we applied\na variable-centered approach, in which various risk factors are\nincluded as predictors in conjunction with the four identified\nsubtrajectories. There is strong evidence supporting the validity\nof the four trajectories derived from our cluster analysis, as they\nare all significantly associated with the interpersonal differences\nin the growth parameters associated with the age norm (see\nTable 6). Further evidence is provided by the fact that these\nfour trajectories are associated with different predictors (see\nOur research should be evaluated with reference to some of the\nmost important issues yet to be resolved. First, self-assessed\nhealth is but one of the multiple dimensions of health and well-\nbeing, including disease avoidance, sustained engagement in\nlife, and maintenance of cognitive and physical function\nVerbrugge & Jette, 1994). Further explication of the intra-\npersonal changes and stability is required for dimensions other\nthan self-rated health.\nOur approach can be elaborated in several ways. For\ninstance, time-varying covariates could be incorporated in the\nLevel 1 equation (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). This may be one\nway to address the reciprocal linkages that are likely to exist\nbetween subjective health and its risk factors (e.g., work status).\nOn the other hand, there appear to be some differences in the\ninterpersonal variations (i.e., random effects) associated with\nvarious subjective health trajectories (see Table 4). Further\nresearch concerning their causes is certainly warranted.\nMore importantly, how multiple trajectories interface among\nthemselves over the life span is a very critical but unresolved\nissue. Some researchers have used measures of life courses to\npredict outcomes at one point in time (e.g., Crosnoe & Elder,\n2002). Conceivably, this approach could be extended to using\ntrajectories of one kind to predict those of the other kind (for\na recent example, see McDonough & Berglund, 2003). Other\ninvestigators have analyzed the linkages between trajectories by\napplying latent growth curve models (George & Lynch, 2003;\nMcArdle & Anderson, 1990). However, because of the lack of\nsubstantive theories, the causal order between the trajectories is\nambiguous, and strong assumptions are often required. A\npartial solution involves the application of latent difference\nscores, which imply a variety of dynamic age trajectories and\noffer some means of comparing propositions (McArdle, 2001).\nThe present research entails a quantitative analysis of\ninterpersonal differences in intrapersonal changes of subjective\nhealth. It would be extremely interesting to relate these\nprocesses to higher levels of social structure such as family,\nneighborhood, formal organizations, and cultures. An example\nof such a specification would be a three-level hierarchical linear\nmodel where interpersonal differences in intrapersonal change\nand stability are nested within household units or birth cohorts.\nThis would also extend research concerning successful aging to\nexamine the effects of individual factors as well as features of\nsocial structure.\nFinally, to what degree could our findings be extended\nto a non-Japanese population (e.g., American population)?\nBecause of the significant sociocultural difference, subjective\nhealth trajectories among older Americans may differ sub-\nstantially. For instance, Japan's population is more homoge-\nneous than that in the United States, and it may be less useful in\nmaking cross-national contrasts in terms of the impact of race\nand ethnicity. On the other hand, class distinction does exist in\nJapan, though it manifests in different ways. Further research is\nclearly in order. Nevertheless, given that prior findings\nconcerning self-rated health among older Japanese largely\nparallel those from the United States (Liang et al., 2002), our\nresults may offer some useful clues regarding how subjective\nhealth changes among older Americans.\n"
