The study was conducted with\ntwo EFL writing classes randomly assigned to an experimental (N = 22) and a control group (N = 21) during a university\nterm. Although the students in both classes worked in groups while practicing writing, only the experimental group was\ncontinuously taught to mediate their writings through different strategies and contextual mediations based on Engstrom's\n(1987) activity theory. The students' individual writing scores at the beginning and at the end of the experiment were\ncompared, and the results convincingly proved that the experimental group made significantly more improvement in their\nwriting ability than did the control group. The analysis of the recorded students' interactions in both groups revealed that\nthe experimental group used almost all the sociocultural strategies while practicing writing, whereas the control group made\na very limited use of only some of these strategies.\n",

There is\nan increasing emphasis on the social and motivational con-\ntext within which the writing process is embedded. This view\noriginally emerged as a critique of purely cognitive\napproaches to the teaching and learning of writing. So writ-\ning is no more approached as an individually written product\nisolated from its context. This social view of L2 learning and,\nthus, writing has received extra impetus since the 1990s by\nan increasing interest in the application of the Vygotsky-\ninspired sociocultural theory (SCT) to second and foreign\nlanguage research (e.g., Ellis, 1997; Nyikos & Hashimoto,\n1996; among others). Within this approach, writing is no\nmore considered as a nonlinear process and an individual\npractice. Prior (2006) claims that cognitive paradigm is too\nnarrow in its understanding of the context, so the writing task\nis approached within the SCT. It best describes the context of\nwriting activity in its totality. It offers a perspective within\nwhich writing can be examined as a social practice, with stu-\ndents as active participants in constructing learning pro-\ncesses, and as a result, the interaction between different\ncentral and distinguishing concept of the SCT is that the\nhuman mind is always and everywhere socially and semioti-\ncally mediated within the \"zone of proximal development\"\n(ZPD), or \"the domain of knowledge or skill where the\nlearner is not yet capable of independent functioning, but can\nachieve the desired outcome given relevant scaffolded help\"\nOn the other hand, research on L2 writing has shifted its\nfocus from concentration on the final product of writing to\ninvestigating the process of writing. This necessitates under-\nlining L2 writing strategies to discover the actions and the\nbehaviors of L2 writers while producing written texts. A myr-\niad of studies have focused on the cognitive strategies the L2\nwriters use while writing, such as planning, analyzing, synthe-\nsizing,reasoning,andmonitoring(Cumming,1989;Cumming,\nrecent shift from the cognitive to the sociocultural approach to\nwriting, L2 writing studies have reconceptualized writing\nstrategies within the sociocultural framework.\n1Shiraz University, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nMohammad Rahimi, Department of Foreign Languages and Linguistics,\nEmail: mrahimy@gmail.com\nThe Effect of Strategies-Based Instruction\non the Improvement of EFL Learners'\nWriting Quality: A Sociocultural Approach\nMohammad Rahimi1 and Elmira Noroozisiam1\n Keywords\ngroup work, mediation, sociocultural approach, strategies-based instruction, writing\n2 SAGE Open\nHowever, very few studies have examined the use of L2\nwriting strategies within a sociocultural framework, which\nare mainly descriptive in nature (e.g., Anton & DiCamilla,\nAnton and DiCamilla (1998) examined the use of L1 as a\npowerful strategy of semiotic mediation in providing scaf-\nfolded help in the collaborative activities. De Guerrero and\nVillamil (2000) demonstrated how two students, one as a\nwriter and one as a reviewer, learn from each other (a media-\ntion strategy) during interaction in a peer-review activity.\nVillamil and De Guerrero (1996) report five strategies used\nby L2 learners while revising their writing. These strategies\nincluded using symbols and external resources, using L1,\nproviding scaffolding, resorting to interlanguage, and vocal-\nizing private speech via social interaction in L2 writing.\nA relatively recent study by Lei (2008) investigated EFL\nlearners' writing strategy use based on activity theory\n(Engstrom, 1987). She found four types of writing strategies\nfrom two learners'mediated actions, that is, artifact-mediated,\nrule-mediated, community-mediated, and role-mediated strat-\negies. She argues that L2 writing involves strategic mediation\nof various resources in the world, and the use of writing strat-\negy is oriented toward a writer's goals in society.\nNonetheless, all the L2 writing strategies reviewed above\nare descriptive in nature. That is, they have explored whether\nand to what extent the L2 students use the sociocultural\nwriting strategies. None of these studies, however, has\nfocused on whether teaching these strategies could help L2\nstudents mediate their writing more strategically through\nusing a variety of writing strategies and, as a result, develop\ntheir writing ability. As Lei (2008) contends, \"Although L2\nlearners might have already used some of these strategies,\nthey may not always be aware of the mediated processes or\npotential strategies and be able to use them efficiently and\nwith control\" (p. 232). As an impetus for further research on\nsociocultural writing strategies, Lei (2008) underlines the\nimportance of L2 writing teachers raising the students' con-\nsciousness about these strategies. In a similar vein, Van der\nVeer and Van Ijzendoorn (1985) argue that, according to\nactivity theory, the natural upward movement from lower\norder processes to higher order ones can be influenced by\ndirection and instruction.\nThe present study, hence, investigates the impact of\ninstructing the writing strategies within a sociocultural\nframework on the improvement of L2 students' writing abil-\nity. Although acknowledging that group work may provide\nopportunities for creative thinking, this research is specifi-\ncally concerned with the use and nonuse of sociocultural\nstrategies in groups and the possible effect it brings about on\nthe quality of essay writing as a result of instruction and con-\nsciousness raising. Triggered by the aspiration to address the\ncurrent gap and further extend sociocultural research in L2\nwriting, this study draws primarily on the SCT, activity the-\nory, and concept of mediation (a key element in the SCT) to\ninvestigate the effect of strategies-based instruction within\nthe sociocultural framework on the quality of writing.\nWriting quality is expected to meet the five content criteria\nof communicative quality, organization, paragraphing, cohe-\nsion, relevance, and adequacy (Jacobs, Zinkgraf, Wormuth,\nHartfiel, & Hughey, 1981). In other words, the negotiation\nand interaction between learners, learning materials, tasks,\nand context, as well as using cognitive and sociocultural\nmediating strategies, make students active learners in the co-\nconstructing of the knowledge.\nTheoretical Framework of the Study\nThe activity system model (Figure 1), which is used to depict\na framework for writing activities and mediating strategies,\nand their interaction with each other within the sociocultural\napproach, will be used as the theoretical framework of the\npresent study. The system implies the multidimensionality of\nthe context of second language writing and the possible\ndynamic relationships between the elements.\nThe model comprises the following components: (a)\nSubjects including students' attitude toward writing, motiva-\ntion to write, their goals, and personal and world knowledge.\nThe subjects' collaboration in class is the substantial strategy\nused during the writing. While in collaboration, the subjects'\nschematic knowledge is at play, and they continuously tend to\nutilize each other's factual, local, and sociocultural knowledge\nwhen brainstorming and constructing the text. (b) Rules include\nclass norms such as the evaluation method adopted by the\nteacher. Coded errors are left to be revised by peers in groups.\n(c) Tools like guidelines, worksheets, and instructions, includ-\ning cognitive writing strategies instruction such as planning,\ndrafting, and revising. Tools can be internal or external, physi-\ncal or symbolic mediating artifacts or signs. Concretely, tools\ninclude Internet-mediated strategies, literary work-mediated\nstrategies, and L1- (through translation) and L2-mediated strat-\negies (through negotiating right grammar, structure, vocabu-\nlary, and rhetoric). Through these strategies, the learners are\nasked to compare their written texts with a native's model or\nFigure 1. Activity system.\nRahimi and Noroozisiam 3\nsign-mediate their text in the process of writing. (d) Object\n(instructional objective). (e) Outcome (the development of\nwritten texts) is the individual writings intended to be high in\nquality. (f) Community (students and teachers in the classroom)\nin which the activity is carried out and by which the activity is\nnegotiated. Campus-mediated strategies can be mentioned as\nan example. The students strategically communicated with\npeople in the class and outside the class. (g) Division of labor\n(the roles to play and the jobs to be shared in learning activities,\nthat of the learners and the teacher) assigns an active role to the\nstudents and a role of facilitator to the teacher. Among role-\nmediated strategies, one can refer to author-mediated strate-\ngies, which are specified as trying to establish authorship as an\nEnglish writer or the consideration of the readers.\nThe model provides a proper theoretical foundation of the\nstudy in a holistic manner as the epistemological stance of\nthe sociocultural turn defines human learning as a dynamic\nsocial activity that is situated in physical and social contexts,\nand distributed across persons, tools, and activities (Rogoff,\nThe Study\nThe study through a triangular data-elicitation approach\n(pre-test [treatment] post-test control group design) exam-\nines the effect of sociocultural strategies-based writing\ninstruction on writing quality. The study intends to answer\nthe following questions:\n1. Does strategies-based writing instruction with a\nsociocultural perspective have any effect on the\nimprovement of the students' writing ability and the\nquality of their writing?\n2. To what extent do the students use the instructed\nsociocultural strategies in their interactions while\nworking in groups?\nParticipants\nParticipants of the study comprised 43 English majors (8\nmales and 35 females) studying at Shiraz University, Iran.\nThey participated in two intact essay writing classes taught\nby the first researcher. The two classes were randomly\nassigned to an experimental group (N = 22) and a control\ngroup (N = 21). The results of a proficiency test administered\nto the students of the two classes prior to the beginning of the\nterm indicated that the two groups were equal with respect to\ntheir level of proficiency. The data were collected in the\ncourse of one semester. None of the students had attended an\nessay writing course before entering university.\nInstruments\nTwo instruments were used in the present study. The first\ninstrument of the study was the Oxford Placement Test (OPT;\n2004) utilized to ensure the homogeneity of the two groups\nwith respect to their general English proficiency.\nThe second instrument was Jacobs et al.'s (1981) scoring\nrubric. The rubric contains five subsections, namely, content\ncriteria, organization criteria, vocabulary criteria, language\ncriteria, and mechanics criteria. Based on this 100-point\nscheme, 30 points are allotted to the content of writing, 20\npoints to writing organization, 20 points to vocabulary use,\n25 points to language use (mainly syntax), and 5 points to\nmechanics. On the whole, 50% of the score assigned to the\nwriting quality is related to global aspects (content and orga-\nnization) and 50% to the formal aspects (vocabulary, gram-\nmar, and mechanics).\nMaterials\nEssays.Throughout the semester, the participants wrote\nseven essays, but only two essays--one written at the begin-\nning of the experiment and one at the end--were considered\nas the materials of the study. The first essay, which was on an\nargumentative topic, was written by the students before they\nreceived any instructions on the organization and the process\nof writing an essay. The second was an argumentative essay,\nwhich was written by the students at the end of the semester.\nThe topics of the first and the last essays were, to some\nextent, similar to control the genre as well as the lexical\nitems, and the structures needed for writing on that particular\ntopic. The topics of the two essays were as follows:\n1. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?\nExams should be removed from the educational system\nof the universities and the students must be evaluated\nbased on their performance in the classroom.\n2. \"Attending university classes should not be obliga-\ntory.\" To what extent do you agree or disagree with\nthis opinion?\nAudiotaped discourse. To triangulate the results of the study,\nthe students' oral interactions while writing and practicing\ngroup essays were taped to see to what extent they used the\nlearned strategies while going through the different stages of\nthe writing process.\nData Collection Procedure\nThe data collection started 1 week before the commencement\nof the experiment. Although the students were all sopho-\nmores, to ensure that they were at the same level of profi-\nciency, the OPT was administered to both groups. Then, in\nthe first session of the course, the students were given an\nargumentative topic to write an essay before receiving any\ninstruction on essay writing. This essay served as the pre-test\nof the study; the purpose was to ensure that the two groups\nwere similar in terms of their tentative writing skill. These\nessays were then scored in terms of quality, based on Jacobs\n4 SAGE Open\net al.'s (1981) scoring rubric. To ensure the reliability of the\nscores assigned to the essays, the two researchers scored\n10% of the essays. The scores assigned to these paragraphs\nwere subjected to Cohen's Kappa's interrater reliability test.\nThe interrater reliability index acquired was .86. The rest of\nthe essays were scored by the second researcher only.\nStarting from the second session, the process of writing\nthe expository essay and later the argumentative essay was\npresented to both groups. However, during the course, the\ninstructor taught the sociocultural writing strategies to the\nexperimental group and continuously asked them to mediate\ntheir learning by using these strategies.\nTable 1 summarizes the sociocultural strategies adopted\nin the instruction of the experimental group. The strategies\nhave been adopted from Lei's (2008) study.\nThe students in the experimental group were divided into\nfour groups of four and two groups of three. Each group\ncomprised students of three descending levels ofA, B, and C,\nbased on the writing scores they obtained on the first essay;\nin fact, based on their scores, the students were divided into\nthree groups: 27% of the students with the highest scores\nwere put in Group A, 27% with the lowest scores in Group C,\nand the remaining 46% in Group B. Care was taken to ensure\nthat each group (the groups consisting of four students) was\ncomposed of one student from Group A, one from Group C,\nand two from Group B. There was one student from each\ngroup in the groups consisting of three students.\nThen, in each session, depending on the usefulness and the\nimportance of the strategies to each stage of the writing pro-\ncess, a combination of these strategies were introduced by the\nteacher and practiced in class. The students'writing practices in\nclass were all in groups, and while they were working in\ngroups, the teacher wandered around the class and, besides\nhelping the students with their language problems when they\narose, monitored the students, ascertaining that they used the\nstrategies when needed. Each group was provided with an mp4\nplayer to record all their interactions during the whole class\ntime. After practicing writing each essay type (expository and\nargumentative) in groups (two for each), they were also\nrequired to write essays of each type individually. In addition to\nthe pre-test, they wrote two individual essays (one on each\ngenre), the second of which (the argumentative essay), written\nat the end of the experiment, served as the post-test of the study.\nTo sum, of the 16 class sessions, the students in the experimen-\ntal group had 6 sessions of essay writing instruction along with\nwriting strategies instruction, followed by practice, and 10 ses-\nsions of writing practice. The writings which were given con-\ntent and form feedback by the teacher were revised\ncollaboratively as well.\nThe procedure for the control group was similar to that of\nthe experimental group, except that writing strategy instruc-\ntion was not part of their class procedure. That is, the students\nof this group were taught the process of writing the expository\nand the argumentative essays, and practiced writing these\nessays in groups, but the strategies mentioned above were not\ntaught to this group, and while working in groups, the teacher\nonly discussed the writing problems with the students. In fact,\nit can be said that this group, too, enjoyed peer and teacher\nscaffolding, as it is the case in any cooperative learning activ-\nity, but they did not learn and practice the writing strategies.\nAs in the experimental group, the students had 6 sessions of\nessay type instruction and practice, and 10 sessions of group\npractice in class. All the essays were examined in terms of\ncontent, organization, task fulfillment, and form to be com-\npared later on within and between groups. Similar to the\nexperimental group, the students of this group were asked to\nrecord their interactions while writing.\nThere were time and length limits on the individual essays\n(pre- and post-tests); the students were required to write\nData Analysis\nQuantitative data analysis was conducted to analyze the data\ncollected from OPT and the essays. A series of independent-\nsamples t-tests were run to compare the two groups' lan-\nguage proficiency and writing quality at the beginning and at\nthe end of the term. Matched t-tests were used to compare\neach group's writing quality at the beginning and at the end\nof the term. The recorded interactions between the students\nwere transcribed and coded with based on the sociocultural\nstrategies indicated in Table 1.\nResults\nThe results of the independent t-tests run for Oxford\nPlacement Test and the writing pretest, presented in Table 2,\nArtifact-mediated strategies The Internet-mediated strategies\n Literary-work-mediated\nstrategies\n L1-mediated strategies\n L2-mediated strategies\nRule-mediated strategies Rhetoric-mediated strategies\n Evaluation-criterion-mediated\nstrategies\n Time-mediated strategies\nCommunity-mediated\nstrategies\nCampus-community-mediated\nstrategies\n Society-mediated strategies\nRole-mediated strategies Author-mediated strategies\n Language-learner-mediated\nstrategies\nTable 2.Independent-Samples t-Tests on Homogeneity of the\nTwo Groups.\nt Significance\nRahimi and Noroozisiam 5\nindicated that two groups were equal with respect to their\ngeneral English proficiency and the writing ability.\nResearch Question 1: Does strategies-based writing\ninstruction with a sociocultural perspective have any\neffect on the improvement of the students'writing abil-\nity and the quality of their writing?\nMean scores on the quality of the individually produced\nwritings by the students of the two groups at the beginning\nand at the end of the term were calculated and compared\nthrough an independent t-test. Table 3 illustrates the results\nof the comparison of the two groups in terms of writing qual-\nity at the beginning and at the end of the instruction.\nAs the Table presents, the two groups were similar in\nterms of their writing ability at the beginning of the term (t =\n1.30, p > .05). However, the table reveals a significant differ-\nence between the means of the scores indicating the writing\nquality of the two groups (t = 2.970, p < .05) at the end of the\nexperiment. The mean for the quality of the writing produced\nby the experimental group (82.85) is larger than that of the\ncontrol group (74.50). That is, the participants in the experi-\nmental group who were taught the sociocultural writing\nstrategies and practiced writing their essays utilizing these\nstrategies outperformed those in the control group, who had\nnot been explicitly taught these strategies. As a result, one\ncan come up with the conclusion that the strategy instruction\nand context-providing scaffolding had a significant influence\non the quality of the writing the participants in the experi-\nmental group produced.\nWithin-group improvement in writing quality was also\ninvestigated through matched t-tests, which were run for\nboth groups. The obtained results are illustrated in Table 4.\nAs it can be seen in the table, both groups have improved\ntheir writing quality at the end of the experiment, and the dif-\nference between the means of their scores on the first and the\nlast essays is statistically significant (t = 7.65, p < .001, for\nthe experimental group and t = 3.120, p < .05, for the control\ngroup). To see how big the mean differences are, the effect\nsize for the differences between the writing scores for each\ngroup was calculated. The results, as presented in Table 4,\nshow that the effect size for the control group is at a moder-\nate level, very close to the border between moderate and\nsmall, while that of the experimental group enjoys a large\none (.33 and .75, respectively). This implies that receiving\nstrategies-based instruction and mediation through coopera-\ntion seem to have more effect on the improvement of writing\nquality than cooperative writing without having a conscious\nknowledge of these strategies.\nResearch Question 2: To what extent do the students use\nthe instructed sociocultural strategies in their interac-\ntions while working in groups?\nThe analysis of the transcripts of the recorded interactions\nin the experimental group revealed that they used the major-\nity of the sociocultural strategies the teacher had taught,\nwhile negotiating in different stages of the writing process.\nRandomly selected pieces of discourse have been presented\nbelow to exemplify the use of the selected strategies by the\nstudents. It should be noted that, for the most part, students'\ninteractions were in Persian with English used occasionally\nwhen referring to the different parts of the text written or\nwhen reading parts of the text. To facilitate understanding,\nthe English version of the interactions has been produced and\npresented in each section. The words said in English are\nboldfaced. Note that letters at the beginning of each exchange\njust replace the names of the students; neither do all similar\nletters indicate the same students nor do they correspond to\nGroups A, B, and C indicating the proficiency levels.\nRhetoric-Mediated Strategies\nA:\nOk guys, let's read it again.

This group, in spite of having the same resources at\ntheir disposal, made a very limited use of the relevant strate-\ngies or did not use them at all. For instance, although the\nscoring scheme was introduced to both groups, since the\nteacher did not teach evaluation-criteria-mediated strategies\nto the control group, they did not refer to it in their interac-\ntions while writing or revising their writing.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe results of the present study showed that the experimental\ngroup, who were taught the writing strategies within a socio-\ncultural framework outperformed the students in the control\ngroup in both strategy use and writing quality, although both\nworked in groups. The findings are theoretically justified and\nalmost in line with most of the experimental studies that have\na sociocultural foundation, as the review of the literature\nindicates.\nStudents in both groups formed small communities of\npractice doing the writing tasks progressively, except that\nthose in the experimental group learned and used the writing\nstrategies during the course and achieved more growth in the\nuse of those strategies, and as a result, in writing quality, as\ncompared with the control group.\nThe strategies taught to the participants of the present\nstudy were of mediational type. They were explicitly\nintroduced and used in class for the students to mediate their\nwritings in all the three phases of the writing process. This\ntype of teaching assumes a paradigm of teacher\u00adstudent and\npeer\u00adpeer interaction, while a strong emphasis is placed on\nthe active role of the learner as a strategy user, which is\nessential for becoming a self-regulated learner (Vygotsky,\n1978). The teacher in the experimental group wandered\nround the class to ensure that the students used the strategies\ntaught, negotiating the strategies with the students when\nneeded. This negotiation is one of the vital factors in suc-\nceeding the mastery of the strategies and their implementa-\ntion as well (Vygotsky, 1978). Some of these strategic\nbehaviors displayed by the peers and the teacher in this study\nincluded intentionality, joint regard, affective involvement,\ncommunicative ratchet, contingent responsivity, and so on,\nwhich are all mostly among mediational process-related\nstrategies awareness of which were intended to be raised in\nthe experimental group along with the instruction of the\nother sociocultural strategies.\nOne of the strategies that the students learned in class and\nused while doing group work was articulation, which\ninvolves any method of encouraging students to express their\nknowledge, reasoning, or problem-solving processes in\ngroup work (Yang, 2011). In effect, the use of this strategy by\nthe students of the present study provides a likely explana-\ntion for their higher use of revision strategies, which led to\nwriting essays of a higher quality in their later independent\nwritings. As a matter of fact, through articulation, students\nare encouraged not only to make revisions but also to pro-\nvide reasons for revisions to their peers in groups. Such tasks\nrequire students to participate in generating language knowl-\nedge and evaluating the writing outcomes. In reflection, stu-\ndents compare their own problem-solving processes in\nwriting with those of their peers (Liu, 2005). Such compari-\nsons aid students in diagnosing their difficulties, and adjust-\ning and negotiating their revision strategies until they achieve\nthe goal of text improvement. An exploration of this kind has\npossibly enabled students to become more and more inde-\npendent learners in producing high quality essays, as they are\nencouraged to select appropriate and effective peer review\nfor improving their own texts.\nAnother kind of strategy practiced in the experimental\ngroup was time-mediated strategy, which has a basis from\nsome well-founded studies emphasizing the temporal nature\nof composing. As with the group writing requirements, the\nstudents had the choice to allocate different amounts of time\nto negotiation while working collaboratively on different\nparts of the task.\nAccording to Cumming (2001), L2 writers \"seem to devote\nmuch attention and, as a result, much time, while they write to\nmake decisions about the form of the second language or to\nfinding resources such as appropriate words\" (p. 5).\nThe participants of the study were also taught to assess their\nwriting regularly based on criteria that the teacher offered them\nthrough feedbacks and the instruction on academic writing the\nRahimi and Noroozisiam 7\nteacher gave them through the course. This strategy is catego-\nrized under evaluation-criterion-mediated strategies (Lei,\n2008), which is a subcategory of rule-mediated strategies.\nAssessing writing and providing feedback is considered a\nsocial practice in nature. In this research, part of this process\nwas fulfilled by the teacher and part of it by the students. In this\nprocess, teachers' preliminary feedback to students' writings\nserved as an evaluation criterion to their future collaborative\ntasks in class, which was done for both groups. They were pro-\nvided with an insight into what good English writing is and\nstrove to meet the respective criteria for good writing.\nThe principles of peer feedback and collaboration are\nclearly consistent with a social constructivist framework\n(Peterson & McClay, 2010). Communication among the\nteachers and the students is essential for effective assess-\nment, as Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) advocate an\nemphasis on productive, supportive talk. Garcia-Mayo and\nPica (2000) claim that students can give each other useful\ninput. Ellis (2003) also indicates that during group work\nexercises, students will provide each other with input that\npromotes their comprehension better than the input provided\nby the teacher, which is carefully planned beforehand.\nTherefore, they, along with Gass (1988), suggest that effec-\ntive input that facilitates language acquisition should be\ncomprehended input instead of a comprehensible input,\nwhich emphasizes the importance of students' production by\nwhich the actual level of students' understanding can be\ngauged.\nIn addition, the participants of the study were taught to\nmediate their writing through different artifacts such as the\nInternet, dictionaries, English literary works, writing text-\nbooks, and cognitive and organizational strategies instructed\nby the teacher. The artifacts were many times introduced as\nan effective strategy on its own to mediate the writing tasks.\nFor example, the Internet, which is one of the strategies\nintroduced in the class, is one of the fastest spreading tech-\nnologies of communication in human history. Theorists from\nmany cognitive traditions (e.g., Vygotsky, 1978) have pointed\nout that technologies (an example of artifacts) are not exter-\nnal to human activity but rather intimately bound up with it.\nAll in all, the study explored how raising the students'\nconsciousness about the L2 writing strategies would help\nthem mediate their writing strategically in all the stages with\ndiverse resources in the dynamic context of the writing and,\nas a result, improve the quality of their writing. To this end,\nthe activity system model provided a proper framework to\ndepict such a dynamic and cyclical process and to investigate\neach component's relationship to the other. In the experimen-\ntal group, the whole context with all its elements was taken\ninto consideration to improve the quality of the writings. The\nresult of the treatment proved to be successful as the rela-\ntively large difference between the control and the experi-\nmental group's performance revealed. As it is evidenced in\nthe study, there is also a perceptible change in the control\ngroup. That is, although they were not taught how to use the\ncollaborative writing strategies, they still made a limited use\nof some of these strategies, which can partly explain the\nimprovement observed in their writing ability. The great dif-\nference in effect size calculated for each group indicates the\nexperimental group outstandingly outperformed the control\ngroup and that is attributed to the right and conscious utiliza-\ntion of strategies within sociocultural approach. So it could\nbe concluded that the sociocultural strategies-based instruc-\ntion has the desired effect on writing quality in case they are\nexplicitly introduced and practiced in the class.As Lei (2008,\nOne implication that L2 writing teachers can draw from\nthe study is that if students can raise their consciousness\nabout the mediation of resources in writing processes, they\nmight be able to strategically mediate their writing with a\nmultitude of resources, find the true meaning of writing, and\ngradually develop themselves into better writers.\nSuggestions for Further Research\nWith regard to the importance of learning style (defined as\nthe general approach students use to learn a new subject or\ntackle a new problem) in group working, further research\nshould address the influence of style harmony and style con-\nflict in collaborative writing activities.\nTransition from other- to self-regulation has not proved to\nbe an easy task to accomplish (Rasku-Puttonen, Etel\u00e4pelto,\nArvaja, & H\u00e4kkinen, 2003), but scaffolding activities, in the\nlong run, might need less intervention on behalf of the\nteacher and perhaps might trigger longer episodes of collec-\ntive thinking on behalf of the students. A comprehensive\nmicroanalysis of the nature of such transition, which finally\nends in individuals' self-regulation, would be very illuminat-\ning with regard to the concept of scaffolding, which needs to\nbe done in an extended period of time.\nFurther research can also concentrate on the use of these\nstrategies in different stages of writing--pre, while, and\nrevision--to see which one/ones are used more frequently in\ndifferent stages and why.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnton, M., & DiCamilla, F.
