The aim of the report is to identify and consider\nthe ethical, legal and social issues that arise from the\nuse of novel neurotechnologies, and in so doing, to\nmake recommendations that could be used to inform\nresearch, policy, governance and public engagement in\nthe area. The report develops an ethical framework for\nresearch and clinical practice involving novel neuro-\ntechnologies, and it appeals to the European\nCommission's notion of Responsible Research and\nInnovation (RRI) as a way of implementing the frame-\nwork. In this paper, we will critically engage with the\nnotion of RRI and the Nuffield Council's rendition of\nRRI in particular. We do this with the intention of\nidentifying how empirical ethics can contribute to\nRRI; indeed, we believe that the contribution of empir-\nical ethics is essential to ensuring that the aims of RRI\nare realised in practice. The RRI initiative, we argue,\nhas opened up a space for empirical ethics and can\nprovide the enterprise with an important purpose.\nDrawing on a range of empirical ethics studies from\nmedical sociology, science and technology studies,\nand related disciplines, we propose four avenues of\nresearch and illustrate how each avenue of research\nis essential to ensuring that RRI can actually be\nachieved.\nThe RRI initiative\nThe notion of RRI has its genesis in a European\nCommission Science in Society workshop held in\nBrussels, May 2011. The aim of the workshop, which\ninvolved experts from academia and policy, was to for-\nmulate a broad understanding of RRI that could be\nused to inform specific policy recommendations to be\nimplemented throughout the EU. The launch of the\ninitiative reflected a feeling among policy makers and\nacademics that extant policy would be insufficient for\nmanaging ethically problematic areas of science and\ninnovation such as synthetic biology and genetically\nmodified organisms.1\nThe key premises of the initiative are that science is\nthe basis for a better future; that the benefits of science\nBrunel University London, United Kingdom\nCorresponding author:\nJohn Gardner, University of York, Heslington, York, YO10 5DD, United\nKingdom.\nEmail: john.gardner@york.ac.uk\nClinical Ethics\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\ncet.sagepub.com\ncan be maximised (and the harmful impacts minimised)\nonly if it is carefully directed towards certain societal\nneeds in accordance with societal values, and that as\nmany stakeholders as possible should be involved in\nanticipating and identifying societal needs and social\nvalues. As one of their publications states2:\n`Responsible Research and Innovation means that soci-\netal actors work together during the whole research and\ninnovation process in order to better align both the\nprocess and its outcomes, with the values, needs and\nexpectations of European society'.\nThe initiative, then, seeks to bridge a perceived gap\nbetween the scientific community and citizens, and to\nmake science more ethical and useful by doing so. It\naligns with the European Commission's goals to foster\nan inclusive, knowledge-based society with a strong\neconomy, and in the process it draws upon prevalent\ndiscourses that herald `public engagement', `interdisci-\nplinarity' and `innovation' as the foundations for\nrobust social and economic development.\nProponents argue that implementing the initiative\nrequires careful assessment of specific innovations and\nforesight of their likely effects. Such foresight must\nanticipate the social impact of the specific innovation \u00ad\nhow it will impact consumers and communities. This\nknowledge, it is argued, will inform strategies that can\nhelp innovations to become better embedded in society\nand ensure `that their positive and negative impacts are\nbetter governed and exploited at a much earlier stage'.3\nThe reluctant uptake of several recent innovations,\nsuch as the airport security body scanners in many\nparts of Europe, and the energy-usage `smart-meters'\nin the Netherlands, are attributed to a lack of such\nknowledge.\nThis emphasis on `social impact' and `innovation\nforesight' has opened up a space for empirical ethics\nwithin the initiative. It suggests that an empirically\nderived understanding of the social world (or of `con-\nsumers' and `communities') is an important component\nof moral research and innovation practices. As Von\nSchomberg states, empirical knowledge is necessary\nfor ensuring that technological development aligns\nwith accepted ethical principles (such as those found\nin the EU charter on fundamental human rights) and\nthat the resulting technologies will not conflict with the\nvalues of communities.3 Here, then, RRI entails\ndescribing the cultural and institutional aspects of the\ninnovation processes, and describing and analysing the\nmoral opinions of those who are likely to be affected by\ninnovations. Social scientists who can produce empiric-\nally derived knowledge are thus rendered as necessary\nelements of RRI, although like many elements of the\nRRI initiative at this point in time, the specific mode of\nsocial science involvement is yet to be clearly\ndelineated.\nThe Nuffield Council on Bioethics' 2013 report\nNovel Neurotechnologies: Intervening in the Brain, how-\never, is an example of a more clearly articulated RRI\nrecommendation.4 Overall the report is in the same vein\nas the European Commission's initiative to encourage\nuseful and ethical science and innovation. It begins with\nthe premise that the current prevalence of neurological\nand psychiatric illnesses that cause a great deal of suf-\nfering constitutes a `great need' for new, innovative\ntherapeutic interventions. Parkinson's, Alzheimer's dis-\nease, stroke and obsessive compulsive disorder are\ngiven as examples of conditions where new interven-\ntions are desperately needed, either because treatments\ndo not currently exist, or if they do, they fail to ade-\nquately manage the illness in a significant proportion of\npeople. The report (henceforth NCoB) also points out\nthat the development of new treatments is likely to be\nplagued by ethical and social challenges, due in large\npart to the privileged nature of the brain: it is `uniquely\nassociated with \"me\", with our subjective self-concep-\ntion and capacity to develop and exercise this concep-\ntion through our actions'.4 Additionally, despite a\nrecent flourishing of research in the neurosciences,\nmany aspects of brain functioning remain unknown.\nFor these reasons, the report states, `great uncertainty'\nsurrounds the developments of new therapies for\nneurological and psychiatric illnesses.\nThe purpose of the NCoB report is to put forward a\nframework of principles that can help clinicians, scien-\ntists and policy makers to navigate this great uncer-\ntainty while addressing the need for new\ninterventions. The report has adopted the notion of\nRRI and has delineated six specific priorities of RRI\nto make the initiative more concrete. These priorities, it\nis stated, will be of `practical use both to those conduct-\ning and funding research and to those involved in gov-\nerning the field by guiding the discharge of their\nresponsibilities'.4 In the following, we will critically\nengage with several key RRI priorities of the report.\nWe are supportive of each priority, and we believe the\npriorities can serve as a framework for RRI in all areas\nof healthcare, not just neurotechnologies. But as we will\nargue below, there are specific challenges with each one.\nDrawing on previous work conducted within social sci-\nences, we will then propose four avenues of empirical\nresearch which we believe are essential to ensuring that\nthe Nuffield Council's priorities, and the RRI initiative\nas a whole, are realised in practice.\nClearly identified need\nThe first priority of the NCoB RRI initiative is a thera-\npeutic priority to alleviate suffering. Research and\ninnovation activities should be directed towards the alle-\nviation of suffering of those living with illness, although\nthe report points out that this does not mean that foun-\ndational research, for which the clinical impact cannot\nalways be clearly defined, should be excluded.\nInnovation, then, is a virtuous activity if it is directed\ntowards the alleviation of suffering, as this ensures that it\nis fulfilling the needs of society. The report contrasts this\n`virtuous innovation' with innovation that produces imi-\ntative technologies, distinguished from already existing\ntechnologies by superfluous modifications, which largely\nserve manufacturer's commercial interests rather than\nthose of patients.\nThere can be little doubt that `clearly defined need'\nserves as a good basis for RRI. The need to justify\ninnovation activities in terms of patient need, rather\nthan manufacturers' commercial interests, is demon-\nstrated by the recent profusion of artificial hip\nmodels, many of which provide little or no therapeutic\nbenefit over previous models. As Faulkner states, the\nhealthcare policy community has long felt that the\ndesign, adoption and diffusion of new artificial hip\nmodels has been out of control.5 Yet delineating\n`clearly defined need' in terms of the alleviation of suf-\nfering can be problematic. While in most cases human\nsuffering and the need for an intervention are obvious \u00ad\nsuch as the suffering experienced by people with severe,\nlate-stage Parkinson's \u00ad we should be wary of using\n`suffering' as a justification in its own right. This can\nbe illustrated with ethically dubious research activities\ncarried out in the past. An example of such activity is\nMoan and Heath's attempts to produce a `treatment'\nfor homosexuality at Tulane University in the early\n1970s.6 Moan and Heath inserted electrodes into the\n`pleasure centre' region of the brain of their participant,\nwhich was then stimulated while the participant per-\nformed various heterosexual activities. Moan and\nHeath's justification for the research was that the\npatient experienced suicidal ideation, paranoid ideation\n`highlighted by a marked fear of the future' and that he\nfelt `sealed off and alienated from society in general'.6\nThe participant was certainly suffering, but few com-\nmentators would agree that this justifies Moan and\nHeath's project. In such cases an individual's suffering\nis not the consequence of an illness, it arises from an\ninability to align themselves with prevalent social\nnorms. The distinction here is important.\nGenerating robust evidence\nThis priority states that the innovation of neurotechnol-\nogies must involve the generation of robust evidence,\nand that it should proceed on the basis of best available\nevidence. Those individuals and agencies involved in\ninnovation, then, must both continually draw upon the\navailable evidence pool as well as actively contributing\nto it. This will enable the continual appraisal of an\ninnovation's efficacy and safety and ensure that it is dir-\nected towards clearly defined therapeutic need. In many\nareas of clinical research, such evidence is often gener-\nated via large, randomised clinical controlled trials, but\nas the report states, the development of neurotechnolo-\ngies often proceeds as small-scale studies and investiga-\ntive treatments, due to their invasive nature and high\ncost. The report adds that this can be a hindrance to\nthe generation of robust evidence as dispersed, small-\nscale studies may not produce the consolidated body\nof data required to produce meaningful evidence.\nAnother complication with the `generation of robust\nevidence', however, is defining what counts as `evidence'\nin the first place. There are various ways in which the\nseverity of an illness (and thus the effect of an interven-\ntion on that illness) can be measured. This is demon-\nstrated by the range of outcome measures and clinical\nassessment tools used by clinicians and researchers:\nsome quantify specific biomedical criteria or events\n(such as frequency or duration of seizure), while\nothers, such as Quality of Life measures, attempt to\nquantify a patient's experience of illness. It is essential\nthat one of the tools used by clinicians during the innov-\nation process captures clinical improvements that\npatients and their families find meaningful. If the\nwrong tool is used, the resulting data will not adequately\ncapture the impact of the technology and its ability to\naddress therapeutic need. Indeed, clinical teams working\nwith innovative neurotechnology-based therapies have\nnoted that the standard, commonly used clinical assess-\nment tools in their area do not necessarily capture mean-\ningful clinical improvements.7 RRI, then, requires the\ngeneration of robust evidence, which depends upon the\nability of clinicians and researchers to measure clinical\nimprovements that patients themselves find meaningful.\nContinuous reflexive evaluation\nThe NCoB report points out that innovation processes\nseldom follow a linear pathway. As basic science is\ntranslated into new therapies, and as novel techniques\nand therapies undergo incremental improvement, new\napplications may become apparent. Or alternatively, an\ninnovation may become trapped at an unforeseen hin-\ndrance and its anticipated benefits become much less\nlikely to materialise. The report argues, then, that it is\nvital that those individuals and agencies involved in\ninnovation processes step back from their narrow\nfocus on a particular application and cast a broad, crit-\nical eye over the current status of the technology, so\nthat they can continually appraise its ability to address\ntherapeutic need, and so that they can identify other\n`spin-off' applications.\nThe report acknowledges that commercial interests\ncan hinder the capacity of individuals and agencies to\nGardner and Williams 7\nprovide such a critical appraisal. But as a body of work\nin the `sociology of expectations' literature has made\nclear, hindrances to critical appraisal and evaluation\nare deeply embedded in the institutional arrangements\nthat constitute innovation networks.8 Scientists, clin-\nicians, research institutions, press officers and the\nmedia become involved and perpetuate cycles of hype.\nSuch hype is not a by-product of innovation. Rather, it\nis part of the innovation process itself: narratives of\n`breakthrough' and `discovery', which inevitably down-\nplay the limitations of research findings, are used by\nthose involved in innovation to secure attention,\nresources and prestige, and thus form the alliances\nthat are necessary for an innovation to proceed.\nIndeed, such alliance forming is increasingly inscribed\nin the professional role of scientists and research clin-\nicians. It may, therefore, be difficult for those agents\ninvolved in innovation to `step-back' and critically\nassess the likely future for their innovation.\nCoordinated interdisciplinary action\nAnother key priority of RRI, according to the NCoB\nreport, is coordinated interdisciplinary action. The\nreport argues that innovation processes should involve\na diversity of actors. The multiple perspectives provided\nby such diversity enable a more coherent, comprehen-\nsive appraisal of an innovation; it enables greater reflex-\nivity, and it ensures that the actual capacities and likely\neffects (both positive and negative) can be more clearly\ndelineated and assessed in terms of therapeutic need.\nHere, intra-disciplinary work is equated with fragmen-\ntation and myopia.\nThe report, then, argues that interdisciplinarity is a\nkey component of RRI, but it provides no detail on\nwhat disciplines should be involved or how we might\ngo about deciding what particular disciplines are\ninvolved; nor does it identify what specific aspects of\nresearch and innovation might best be managed by\ninterdisciplinary teams.\nOvercoming the challenge we have highlighted here\nrequires an empirically derived understanding of the\ninnovation area. It requires a thorough understanding\nof the numerous agents involved in research and innov-\nation, the nature of the interactions between these agents,\nand it requires anticipating the cultural impact of an\ninnovation \u00ad the way in which an innovation will shape\nunderstandings of health, illness, agency and person-\nhood. It requires, in other words, empirical research\nthat will enable the priorities to become context sensitive.\nFour avenues of empirical ethics research\nIn the following section, we outline four specific ave-\nnues of empirical social science research. We argue that\ntogether these avenues of research can generate the\nknowledge required to ensure that the priorities identi-\nfied by the NCoB, and the RRI initiative more gener-\nally, can be implemented. Each avenue of research will\nbe illustrated with specific examples from sociology,\nscience and technology studies, and related disciplines.\nAs we will see, each involves producing detailed\ndescriptions of specific social contexts. We anticipate\nthat these descriptions could then be used to inform\nthe formulation of normative measures aimed at ensur-\ning research and innovation activities align with the\npriorities of RRI. However, unlike much of the work\nthat has been conducted under the banner of `empirical\nethics', this does not necessarily involve the explicit\nexamination of pre-identified ethical issues; nor does\nit necessarily involve examining how clinicians and\nresearchers themselves understand and enact `ethics'.\nNevertheless, we will argue in the subsequent section\nthat this work constitutes empirical ethics, albeit\naccording to a very broad conception of the enterprise.\nAvenue one: Tracing innovation ecosystems\nAs science and technology studies theorists have illu-\nstrated, innovations emerge from the interactions invol-\nving numerous agents. The success of an innovation\ndepends upon its ability to appeal to, and be co-opted\nby these agents, who can include clinicians and scien-\ntists of various specialisms, engineers, manufacturers\nand commercial companies, regulatory agencies, and\nusers and patient support groups.9 Together these\nagents constitute what could be called an innovation\necosystem. The notion of an `ecosystem' draws atten-\ntion to the embedded nature of an innovation: it both\nshapes, and is shaped by, a network of relations invol-\nving assortment of interconnected heterogeneous elem-\nents. Within these systems, then, an innovation does\nnot follow a linear trajectory.\nA thorough understanding of innovation ecosystems\nis essential for continuous reflexive evaluation (an\nNCoB priority) of an innovation. Ideally, by tracing\nthe formulation of such systems and the relations\nbetween the elements that constitute them, it becomes\npossible to predict particular patterns of innovation.\nPatterns of innovation can be induced by powerful\nagents within innovation ecosystems \u00ad agents such as\nregulatory agencies or large companies which constitute\nwhat Faulkner has called innovation `structuring\nforces'.5 An example of an innovation pattern is the\ndegree of homogeneity between cardiac pacemakers\nand neurostimulators used in deep brain stimulation\ntechniques.10 The homogeneity is a result of commer-\ncial strategy: in the past manufacturers have been able\nto save production costs by using many elements of the\nsame manufacturing platform to produce both\ntechnologies. An awareness of such patterns (which\nmay differ greatly between different sectors) will\nenable the formulation of predictions about whether\nor not a technology may be leading to an inevitable\n`dead-end' and is thus no longer worth pursuing, or\nwhether policy changes are necessary to keep an innov-\nation alive. A current example of `innovation ecosystem\ntracing' is the ESRC (Economic and Social Research\nCouncil) funded `REGenableMED' programme in the\nScience and Technology Studies Unit at the University\nof York, exploring the development and implementa-\ntion of regenerative medicine. The programme aims to\nmap the various agents involved in regenerative medi-\ncine, with the intention of identifying the social and\norganisation challenges to generating useful therapies.\nAvenue two: Mapping the renegotiation of\nboundaries\nAs a great deal of social science work has made clear,\nthe development and dissemination of innovations is a\ntransformative process.11,12 As innovations undergo\nincremental modification and adjustment, so do many\nof the agents working with them: new alliances between\nagents form; professional boundaries between groups\nmay become permeable; and new social groups\nemerge which, in the process of delineating themselves,\ncan lead to the establishment of new boundaries and\ndivisions. This transformational aspect of research and\ninnovation is particularly noticeable in the field of\nregenerative medicine.13 New alliances have been estab-\nlished involving cell biologists and clinicians, and new\ninterdisciplinary research networks have been estab-\nlished at national and international levels. If we are to\nfacilitate RRI then it is necessary to understand the\nprocesses by which such alliances form and the nature\nof hindrances that can prevent such alliances.\nIndeed, such knowledge is particularly important if\nwe are to encourage coordinated interdisciplinary\naction, stipulated as a priority by the NCoB. It is neces-\nsary to have a detailed knowledge of the boundaries\nwhich prevent interdisciplinary work (these may be\nfinancial, professional, structural), and the tools and\ntechnologies which enable and facilitate such work.\nThis requires careful empirical research, particularly\nethnographic research in contexts where individuals\nfrom different professional backgrounds are working\nor attempting to work together. Examples of such\nresearch can already be found in the social science lit-\nerature. Coombs and Ersser conducted ethnographic\nresearch of interdisciplinary intensive care units, includ-\ning observations of decision-making interactions and\nin-depth interviews with members of an interdisciplin-\nary team.14 They identified a barrier to interdisciplinary\ncare and decision making: the traditional authority of\ndoctors over nurses. Doctors and their biomedical-\nbased understandings of patients tended to be fore-\ngrounded during decision making, while nurses, and\ntheir detailed knowledge of patients' families and the\npatient `as a person' tended to be ignored or devalued.\nSimilarly, Centallas and colleagues carried out ethno-\ngraphic research with an interdisciplinary team working\nwithin a translational cancer research institution.15\nCentallas and colleagues, however, drew attention to\nenablers of coordinated interdisciplinary action. These\nwere `participation customs' which were learned and\nshared by members of the team and which permitted\ninterdisciplinary decision making while enabling each\nteam member to remain firmly entrenched within\ntheir own discipline. The team as a whole was able to\nestablish and function as an effective unit without blur-\nring traditional disciplinary boundaries. Research such\nas this can help inform the production of practical\nguidelines that encourage and facilitate coordinated,\neffective interdisciplinary action.\nAvenue three: Exploring experiences of illness and\nnew biosocial forms\nUnderstanding the experiences of those with illnesses\ncan help clearly identify the need for new healthcare\ntechnologies. It is necessary to examine how individuals\nmake sense of their illness, how this illness is shaped by\ncultural and social factors, and how it impacts on their\nday-to-day activities and sense of well-being. Semi-\nstructured interviews would be an appropriate means\nof exploring these issues with patients, such as Fox and\nWard's recommended interview strategy for exploring\nhealth identities.16 Here, in-depth interviews are used to\nencourage participants to provide context to their\nworld and descriptions of their day-to-day life, and\nthey are then encouraged to reflect on the meaning of\nthese experiences. The knowledge produced by methods\nsuch as this can help inform if there is indeed a genuine\nneed for a technological or pharmacological interven-\ntion, or whether some other form of intervention may\nbe more suitable to help individual sufferers. This\nknowledge could also inform the selection of appropri-\nate clinical assessment tools for quantifying the effect-\niveness of new interventions. It would enable\ninnovators to select clinical assessment tools (such as\nimpairment measures, disability measures and Quality\nof Life measures) that capture clinical improvements\nthat patient's themselves feel are meaningful.\nImportantly, however, methods that provide us with\na glimpse of peoples' experiences of illness also enable\nus to explore biosociality. Biosociality refers the way in\nwhich individuals and social groups draw upon bio-\nmedical knowledge to make sense of themselves or to\nadvance particular political and social aims.17\nGardner and Williams 9\nHealthcare innovations can encourage new forms of\nbiosociality, often encouraging reductive, biomedically\nbased understandings of personhood and illness. This\nhas been illustrated by empirical work looking at the\nimpact of new neurotechnologies and the rise of neuro-\nscience.18 As Rapp has argued, one impact is that, `psy-\nchodynamic explanations of human variation and\nsuffering' are being eclipsed by `brain-orientated,\nhyper-materialist explanations'.19 Identifying new bio-\nsocial forms is a fundamental component of evaluating\nthe potential consequences of a new innovation.\nAvenue four: Problematizing promissory visions\nAs mentioned earlier, individuals directly involved in\nresearch and innovation processes are not necessarily\nin a position to provide a careful evaluation of an\ninnovation: they may be too embedded in the institu-\ntional arrangements that are responsible for generating\noptimistic portrayals of innovations. Social scientists,\nin contrast, are well suited to providing a more critical\nperspective; a perspective that is absolutely necessary\nfor continuous reflexive evaluation. For example, a\nburgeoning body of work within social science has\ndrawn attention to some of the specific institutional\npressures that generate over-optimistic portrayals of\nthe impact of innovations.20 Ro\n\u00a8 dder has noted that\nincreased competition for research funding has meant\nthat scientists and institutions are forced to market\nthemselves to the public and `key stakeholders'.21 This\nhas brought about the expansion and professionalisa-\ntion of science press officers,22,23 whose role demands\nthat science and research findings are presented in a\nmanner that will attract the attention of journalists.\nThis has resulted in an increase in sensationalist news\nSuch work problematizes the promissory visions\nassociated with healthcare innovations, thus opening\nup a space for a more genuine critical evaluation.\nAnother important role for social scientists is to\nproduce counter-visions of an innovation. Such coun-\nter-visions need not necessarily be overcritical of an\nevaluation, but they can help provide a more realistic\ninterpretation of the future of an innovation and its\nconsequences. In order to do this, they need to draw\nupon a detailed knowledge of the innovation ecosystem\nand the way in which the innovation may be implicated\nin the production of new biosocial forms.\nDiscussion: Empirical ethics and RRI\nWe believe that the RRI initiative, particularly the prio-\nrities listed by the NCoB report, should provide an eth-\nical framework for managing research and innovation\nin all areas of healthcare. Furthermore, we believe that\nensuring that the RRI initiative and the NCoB priori-\nties are context sensitive and thus applicable in real life\nis an important task for empirical ethics. This task\nwould incorporate the four avenues of research that\nwe have identified earlier. Together these avenues of\nresearch would produce a pool of knowledge which\nwould help ensure that innovation processes better\nalign with the values and needs of society, and which\nwould enable policy makers and commentators to\nanticipate the likely impact of an innovation. We sug-\ngest, therefore, that RRI, the NCoB priorities, and the\nfour avenues of research can serve as something of a\nmanifesto for empirical ethics.\nWe envisage that an empirical ethics guided by an\nRRI manifesto would share the core goals of empirical\nethics in its current form, but that the scope would be\nconsiderably broader than some descriptions of the\nenterprise. The enterprise outlined here aligns with\nMusschenga's description of the ultimate aim of all\nempirical ethics: to draw upon empirical data to\nimprove the context sensitivity of normative, prescrip-\ntive claims.25 And in many respects, it would align with\nexisting empirical ethics work that, as Musschenga\ndefines it, has sought to describe and analyse specific\ncultural and institutional contexts in order to evaluate\nthe practicality of guidelines and principles. Examples\nof such work include Wainwright and colleagues pro-\nject which, by exploring the specific perspectives of stem\ncell scientists, highlights the `socially embedded' nature\nof the ethical implications of stem cell research.26\nSimilarly, Brosnan and colleagues have explored what\n`ethics' actually means to researchers working in trans-\nlational neuroscience, and noted that their ethical view-\npoints produce, and in turn were produced by, scientific\npractice.27 Such work has sought to describe the moral\nframeworks of those actors working in clinical contexts,\nexplore how these frameworks are shaped by various\ncultural and institutional factors, and how ethical work\nand reasoning is actually conducted in clinical practice\nand research. We envisage that an empirical ethics dir-\nected towards RRI would also seek to explore these\naspects. Such research might be necessary, for example,\nto inform the formulation of specific RRI guidelines, to\nexamine the applicability of specific guidelines and to\nexplore whether such guidelines are influencing\nresearch and clinical activities in such a way that\naligns with the values and expectations of society.\nHowever, the avenues of research we have listed in\nthis paper broaden the analytical gaze of empirical\nethics beyond the examination of pre-identified ethical\nissues and the explicit examination of how those work-\ning in healthcare contexts and innovation understand\n`ethics' and engage in `ethical' work. An empirical\nethics that follows an RRI manifesto would be similar\nin form to what Dunn and colleagues refer to as an\n`empirically driven, broad-conception empirical\nethics'.28 They describe this broad conception of empir-\nical ethics as:\n. . . making empirical claims that describe or explain the\nworld as it is. . . The aim [is to] identify the actual eth-\nical issues . . . or to make sense of relevant experiences,\nunderstandings, judgements or intuitions of individuals\nwho stand in relation to these issues. [This is then used\nto] recommend some course of action, be it an act, a\nstance, a guidance for acting or a policy to govern\naction.\nAs we have suggested earlier, facilitating ethical\nresearch and innovation entails research of social and\ninstitutional factors that may not explicitly be identi-\nfied as `ethical' by either ethicists or those working\nwithin research and innovation contexts. Tracing\ninnovation ecosystems (research avenue one) is a\ngood example. Such research is necessary for directing\ninnovation resources towards clearly identified thera-\npeutic need, but it does not involve the description\nand evaluation of a specific ethical issue. Indeed, the\nvery notion of `responsible research and innovation'\nhas, in effect, framed the entire research and innovation\nprocess as being morally relevant. Ensuring that\nresearch and innovation is responsibly directed towards\n`great need' is an important task for empirical ethics,\nbut it necessitates an empirical ethics that is broad in\nscope.\nFunding\nThe paper derives from a project that was funded by\nWellcome Trust (Wellcome Trust Biomedical Strategic\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nNone declared.\nReferences and notes\n1.
