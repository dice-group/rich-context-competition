Tancredi, PhD;\nCorina Benjet, PhD; Ladson Hinton, MD; Kenneth S. Kendler, MD; Richard Kravitz, MD; William Vega, PhD;\nSergio Aguilar-Gaxiola, MD, PhD; Maria Elena Medina-Mora, PhD\nContext: Twin studies suggest that conduct disorder\n(CD) is under substantial genetic influence, which is stron-\nger for aggressive than for nonaggressive symptoms. Stud-\nies of migrating populations offer an alternative strategy\nfor separating environmental and genetic influences on\npsychiatric disorders.\nObjectives: To examine variation in the prevalence of\nCD associated with migration from Mexico to the United\nStates and to determine whether this variation is similar\nfor aggressive and nonaggressive CD symptoms and symp-\ntom profiles.\nDesign: The prevalences of CD, different types of CD\nsymptoms, and CD symptom profiles were compared\nacross 3 generations of people of Mexican origin with in-\ncreasing levels of exposure to American culture: fami-\nlies of origin of migrants (residing in Mexico), children\nof Mexican migrants raised in the United States, and Mexi-\ncan-American children of US-born parents.\nSetting: General population surveys conducted in Mexico\nand the United States using the same diagnostic inter-\nview.\nParticipants: Adults aged 18 to 44 years in the house-\nhold population of Mexico and the household popula-\ntion of people of Mexican descent in the United States.\nMain Outcome Measures: Conduct disorder crite-\nria, assessed using the World Mental Health version of\nthe Composite International Diagnostic Interview.\nResults: Compared with the risk in families of origin of\nmigrants, risk of CD was lower in the general popula-\n1.51), higher in children of Mexican-born immigrants who\n11.52), and higher still in Mexican-American children\nassociation with migration was markedly weaker for ag-\ngressive than for nonaggressive symptoms.\nConclusions: The prevalence of CD increases dramati-\ncally across generations of the Mexican-origin popula-\ntion after migration to the United States. This increase\nis of larger magnitude for nonaggressive than for aggres-\nsive symptoms, consistent with the suggestion that non-\naggressive symptoms are more strongly influenced by en-\nvironmental factors than are aggressive symptoms.\ndefined in the DSM-IV1 by\npersistent patterns of\nchild or adolescent behav-\nior involving aggression\nor other violations of age-appropriate\nnorms that cause significant clinical im-\npairment. Children who meet criteria for\nCD are at high risk for substance use dis-\norders2 and high school dropout3 as ado-\nlescents and unemployment, incarcera-\ntion, and early mortality as adults.4-6\nConduct disorder is also a strong predic-\ntor of a broad range of adult psychiatric\ndisorders, including other impulse con-\ntrol disorders, such as intermittent explo-\nsive disorder, substance use disorders, and\ninternalizing disorders (eg, major depres-\nsion and generalized anxiety disorder).7,8\nRecent nationally representative studies in\nthe United States have estimated the life-\ntime prevalence of CD to be 9.5%, based\non retrospective self-reports of adults aged\nlence to be 2.1%, based on parental re-\nA large body of literature11-13 on behav-\nioral genetics aims to identify environ-\nmental and genetic influences on CD.\nComparisons of concordance between\nmonozygotic and dizygotic twins suggest\nthat approximately 50% of population vari-\nability in CD symptoms is attributable to\ninherited liability, with significant com-\nponents of risk attributable to both shared\nand unshared environmental factors.14,15\nAuthor Affiliations are listed at\nthe end of this article.\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association.

Some studies16,17 report stronger herita-\nbility and weaker environmental influence for aggres-\nsive symptoms (eg, cruelty to others and fighting with a\nweapon) than for nonaggressive symptoms (eg, stealing\nwithout confrontation and truancy). Although there are\nsignificant exceptions to this finding,18 a recent meta-\nanalysis19 estimated that genetic factors account for 65%\nof population variation in aggressive symptoms and 48%\nof population variation in nonaggressive symptoms.\nMigration provides an alternative strategy for sepa-\nrating genetic and environmental influences on CD.20,21\nPopulations that migrate alter their environmental con-\nditions without altering their genetic composition. Vari-\nability in the risk for a disorder associated with migra-\ntion from one country to another indicates an\nenvironmental influence.22 Epidemiologic compari-\nsons23 of immigrant-sending countries in the Caribbean\nand immigrant-receiving countries in Europe have found\nhigher risk for psychotic disorders in the receiving coun-\ntries, consistent with a hypothesized environmental in-\nfluence on these disorders. In the United States, large dif-\nferences associated with United States vs foreign nativity\nhave been found24,25 in risk for mood, anxiety, and sub-\nstance use disorders for some, but not all, immigrant\ngroups. A study26 of Puerto Ricans found no significant\ndifferences in disruptive behaviors between samples of\nchildren in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the South Bronx,\nNew York.\nIn the present study, we examined variation across im-\nmigrant generations in CD symptoms in a transnational\nsample of people of Mexican origin in Mexico and the\nUnited States, the largest sustained international labor\nmigration in the world today. Differences in CD symp-\ntoms were examined dimensionally, according to symp-\ntom counts, and categorically, according to symptom pro-\nfiles. This study is unique in migration studies in\npsychiatry because it included representative samples on\nboth sides of the border, assessments using the same struc-\ntured interview, and the ability to distinguish sub-\nsamples representative of successive generations with in-\ncreasing exposure to American culture, from families of\norigin in Mexico to descendants of US-born Mexican-\nAmericans in the United States. We addressed 2 ques-\ntions. First, to what extent does the prevalence of CD vary\nacross immigrant generations in this population? Sec-\nond, are differences in prevalence across immigrant gen-\nerations consistent for aggressive and nonaggressive symp-\ntoms? We hypothesized that, because of differences in\nheritability, there would be less variation in the preva-\nlence of aggressive than nonaggressive symptoms.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nData came from surveys conducted in Mexico and the United\nStates using the same face-to-face interview, the World Men-\ntal Health version of the Composite International Diagnostic\nInterview (WMH-CIDI).27 The Mexico survey, the Mexican Na-\ntional Comorbidity Survey (MNCS),28 is a stratified, multi-\nstage area probability sample of household residents in Mexico\nA total of 5782 respondents were interviewed between Sep-\nData on the Mexican-origin population in the United States were\nobtained from 2 component surveys of the Collaborative Psy-\nchiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES),29 the National Comor-\nbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R),30 and the National Latino\nand Asian American Study (NLAAS).31 The NCS-R is a strati-\nfied, multistage area probability sample of the English-\nspeaking household population of the continental United\nStates.32 The NLAAS was based on the same sampling frame as\nthe NCS-R, with supplements to increase representation of the\nsurvey's target ethnic groups, including monolingual Spanish\nspeakers.31,33 Spanish-language interviews in the NLAAS used\nthe same translation of the diagnostic interview as the MNCS.\nThe NCS-R was conducted from February 1, 2001, through April\nrespondents in the CPES were of Mexican origin.\nTo reduce the impact of recall bias, the sample was re-\nstricted to respondents younger than 45 years. The resulting\nThe MNCS respondents were asked whether they had ever mi-\ngrated to the United States and whether they had a member of\ntheir immediate family (Miembro de la familia nuclear o inme-\ndiata) living in the United States. Respondents to the CPES were\nasked their country of birth, the nativity (United States vs other)\nof their parents, and, if they were born outside the United States,\nthe age at which they arrived in the United States. Using this\ninformation, the sample was divided into 4 groups based on\ntheir migration history, the presence of migrants in their im-\nmediate family, and the nativity (Mexico vs United States) of\ntheir parents. Definitions of the 4 groups and the sample sizes\noriginating from each survey are presented in Table 1.\nGroup 1, Mexicans in nonmigrant households, is composed\nof MNCS respondents with no history of migration or a member\nof their immediate family living in the United States. Group 2,\nMexicans from migrant households who spent their childhood\n(at least through age 15 years) in Mexico, is composed of MNCS\nrespondents who had a family member living in the United States\nor had themselves previously lived in the United States and CPES\nrespondentswhowereborninMexicoandmigratedtotheUnited\nStates after age 15 years. Immigrants who migrated after age 15\nyears were included in this group because their early childhood\nand the majority of their period of risk for CD symptoms oc-\ncurredinMexico.Group3,childrenofMexican-bornparentswho\nwere raised in the United States before age 15 years, is composed\nof CPES respondents who were born in Mexico and arrived in\nthe United States at age 15 years or earlier or were born in the\nUnited States to 2 Mexican-born parents. Group 4 is composed\nof Mexican-Americans born in the United States with 1 or more\nUS-born parents.\nComparisons between these 4 groups, adjusted for age and\nsex, were specified to test study hypotheses regarding associa-\ntions of migration with CD and CD symptoms. Group 2, which\nrepresents the families of origin of Mexican migrants in\nthe United States, was specified as the reference group. Differ-\nences between group 2 and group 1 indicate household-level\nmigrant selection, ie, differences between individuals in mi-\ngrant vs nonmigrant households in Mexico.34 Differences\nbetween groups 2, 3, and 4 indicate potential influences of\nmigration.\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association.

A clinical validity\nstudy35 in an adolescent sample found excellent sensitivity (96.8)\nand specificity (98.7) for the diagnosis of CD compared with a\nstructured clinical interview. Studies of the NCS-R (adult)\nsample have shown strong associations of the WMH-CIDI di-\nagnosis of CD with established demographic correlates, in-\ncluding male sex, low educational attainment,36 urban resi-\ndence, and divorce.9 Moreover, NCS-R respondents who met\nDSM-IV CD criteria are more likely than other respondents to\nhave a broad range of other psychiatric disorders, including\nanxiety, mood, substance use, and impulse control disorders.9\nDiagnoses of CD in the present study refer to a history of CD\nin childhood.\nInformation from the CD assessment was used to identify\nrespondents who met DSM-IV criteria for CD and respon-\ndents who met the symptom count criteria (3 symptoms) re-\ngardless of whether they met the additional DSM-IV criteria.\nThe sample design variables for the combined MNCS/CPES used\nthe primary stratum and primary sampling unit identification\ncodes and the sampling weight variables developed by the sample\ndesign team at the Institute for Social Research, including the\nintegrated CPES sampling design and weight variable devel-\noped to account for the overlapping coverage of Mexican-\nAmericans by the NCS-R and NLAAS.29,37,38 Sampling stratifi-\ncation variables were modified to ensure that codes used for\nthe CPES and MNCS components did not overlap.39 Sampling\nweights reflect adjustments for unequal selection and re-\nsponse probabilities as well as poststratification adjustments\nto enhance the representativeness of weighted inferences with\nrespect to contemporaneous national census estimates of tar-\nget population sizes. An additional rescaling factor was ap-\nplied to the sampling weights in the cross-national data set so\nthat the weighted sample sizes would reflect the relative sizes\nof the Mexican-origin target populations in Mexico and the\nUnited States, enhancing the suitability of the weights for use\nin design-based analyses involving the full population as well\nAssociations between migrant generation and CD outcomes,\nwith statistical adjustment for age and sex, were estimated using\ntheappropriatelogisticregressionmodelusingtheSUDAANsoft-\nware package to correct standard errors for survey design ef-\nfects.41 Binary outcomes, eg, presence of DSM-IV CD, were ex-\namined using binary logistic regression models, symptom counts\nwereexaminedusingorderedlogisticregressionmodels,andpoly-\ntomous outcomes, eg, CD profiles, were examined using multi-\nnomial logistic regression models. Latent class analysis was con-\nducted with the Mplus software package.42\nRESULTS\nTable 2 shows the age and sex distribution of the sample.\nMembers of group 3 were slightly younger than those of\nthe other groups.\nThe prevalence of CD symptoms in the entire sample\n(Table 3).Threeormoresymptomswerepresentin11.5%\nof the sample, and 2.0% met DSM-IV criteria for CD. There\nwas a strong pattern of higher symptom prevalence in\ngroups 3 and 4 relative to groups 1 and 2, with differences\nin prevalence reaching statistical significance for 12 of the\n15 symptoms. Symptom prevalence was at least twice as\ncommon among group 4 compared with group 2 for all but\n3 symptoms and was frequently much larger in group 4.\nFor instance, respondents in group 4 were more than 13\ntimesaslikelytoendorsedamagingpropertyandmorethan\n9 times as likely to endorse stealing without confronta-\ntion as respondents in group 2. The 3 symptoms for which\nthis difference in prevalence was less than 2-fold were all\naggressivesymptoms(crueltytoanimals,stealingwithcon-\nfrontation, and forced sex). Forced sex was endorsed very\nrarely in this sample (n=3).\nThe prevalence of 3 or more symptoms and DSM-IV\nCD similarly increased across these groups. Respon-\ndents in group 4 were more than 5 times as likely to have\n3 or more symptoms and more than 7 times as likely to\nhave DSM-IV CD as were respondents in group 2.\nThe pattern of increasing risk for CD was confirmed\nin logistic regression models for having 3 or more CD\nTable 1.

In these\nmodels, group 2 was specified as the reference group\nbecause this group represented the families of origin\nof US migrants and thus was the appropriate point of\ncomparison for subsequent generations. Members of\ngroup 2 were more likely to have both outcomes com-\npared with Mexicans from nonmigrant families (group\n1), although this difference did not reach statistical\nsignificance for DSM-IV CD.

Note that the confidence\nintervals for the ORs associated with groups 3 and 4 (rela-\ntive to group 2) do not overlap.\nTo examine associations of migrant generation with\ndifferent types of symptoms, separate ordered logistic re-\ngression models were specified for counts of aggressive\nand nonaggressive symptoms.

On the basis of this categorical\nscheme, the contrast between aggressive and other CD\nclasses is even more pronounced (bottom 3 rows of\nTable 4). There were strong associations between mi-\ngrant group and both the nonaggressive and combined\nCD profiles, with increasing risk in groups 3 and 4 rela-\ntive to group 2. However, there was no significant dif-\nference in risk for the aggressive profile in group 3 or 4\nrelative to group 2. Note that here too, group 2 is at higher\nrisk for all 3 CD classes relative to group 1, significantly\nso for the aggressive and combined classes.\nTo identify subtypes of CD on the basis of empirically de-\nrived symptom configurations, we estimated latent class\nmodels. The best-fitting model according to model fit in-\ndices included 4 latent classes. Model fit statistics for la-\ntent class models with 2 through 5 classes are presented\nintheeTable(http://www.archgenpsychiatry.com).Theen-\ntropy of the 4-class model was 0.898, above the threshold\nof 0.8 recommended for modeling associations between la-\ntent class assignments and auxiliary covariates.43\nTable 5 shows the prevalence of each CD symptom\nin each of the 4 classes identified by latent class analy-\nsis. The first class (no CD) was characterized by low preva-\nlence of all 15 symptoms. The second class (rule breaking/\ndeceit) was characterized by high prevalence of rule\nbreaking and theft/deceit symptoms and low prevalence\nof most aggressive symptoms. The third class (aggressive)\nwas characterized by high prevalence of aggressive and\nlow prevalence of all other symptoms. The fourth class\n(severe) was characterized by high prevalence on all symp-\ntoms. Respondents in the severe class were more severe\nin having a higher prevalence of symptoms characteris-\ntic of the rule-breaking/deceit and aggressive classes, as\nwell as having a high prevalence of destructive symp-\ntoms (fire setting, damage to property) and breaking and\nentering, which are uncommon in the other classes.\nNo respondents in the no-CD class had 3 or more\nsymptoms. In the 2 intermediate classes, rule-breaking/\ndeceit and aggression, the prevalence of 3 or more symp-\nlence of DSM-IV CD was 7.9% and 5.5% respectively. All\nrespondents in the severe class endorsed 3 or more symp-\ntoms, and 40.4% met criteria for DSM-IV CD.\nThe prevalence of the no-CD class decreased sharply\nin group 4 (bottom rows of Table 5). The increase was\nnot evenly distributed across the 3 remaining classes. The\nprevalence of the rule-breaking/deceit and of severe classes\nincreased dramatically across groups, and the preva-\nlence of the aggressive class increased slightly, from 2.4%\nThis pattern of association between migrant group and\nlatent class membership was sustained with adjustment\nfor age and sex (Table 6).

Data were col-\nlected in both the sending and host countries using the\nsame survey instrument, and information was available\nto identify subsamples representing families of mi-\ngrants in Mexico and successive generations of Mexican-\nAmericans in the United States. The ability to account\nfor migrant selection bias34,44 by identifying families of\nmigrants in Mexico (group 2) turned out to be particu-\nlarly important because respondents from these fami-\nlies were more likely to report having had CD symp-\ntoms than were respondents in families without migrants\n(group 1). Had we not made this distinction and simply\ncompared Mexican-Americans in the United States with\nthe general Mexican population, the increase in risk for\nCD associated with migration to the United States would\nhave appeared larger. Selection effects were minimized,\nalthough not eliminated, by including individuals who\nmigrated at age 16 years or older and return migrants in\nTable 5.

In addition, differences between chil-\ndren of migrants raised in the United States (group 3)\nand those of US-born parents (group 4) suggest that risk\ncontinues to increase within the US population, inde-\npendent of possible migrant selection effects.\nThe results suggest that there is a large difference in\nrisk for CD between Mexicans in Mexico and people of\nMexican descent in the United States. Only 2% of people\nin families of migrants (group 2) met DSM-IV criteria for\nCD; 11.5% of US-born Mexican-Americans with at least\n1 US-born parent (group 4) met these criteria. The preva-\nlence of CD in group 4 was close to that in the non\u00ad\nMexican-American, US-born sample of the CPES of 10.6%.\nAdjusting for age and sex, the odds of CD were 7.64 times\nas high in group 4 as they were in group 2. This is a dra-\nmatic increase in risk for one of the most serious child-\nhood psychiatric disorders. The fact that this increase in\nrisk occurred across generations within a migrating popu-\nlation strongly suggests the influence of early childhood\nenvironmental conditions in the United States. The find-\ning highlights the importance of identifying environ-\nmental factors that are potentially modifiable and may\noffer opportunities to reduce the prevalence of CD in the\nUnited States.\nThe increase in risk for CD in the United States is par-\nticularly concerning because of the strong relationship\nof CD in childhood with a wide range of adverse life events\nin adolescence and adulthood, as well as most forms of\nadult psychopathologic disorders.9,45,46 In fact, CD may\nbe an indicator of influences that affect not only child-\nhood psychiatric disorders but also contribute to differ-\nences in risk for later mood, anxiety, and substance use\ndisorders between immigrants and US-born individuals\nthat have been observed in studies of Mexican-Ameri-\ncans and some other immigrant groups in the United\nConvergent evidence from analysis of symptom counts\nand symptom profiles suggests that differences associ-\nated with migration are weaker for aggressive symp-\ntoms than for nonaggressive symptoms. In the analysis\nof symptom counts, aggressive and nonaggressive symp-\ntoms were significantly higher in groups 3 and 4 rela-\ntive to group 2, but the association was much stronger\nfor nonaggressive symptoms than for aggressive symp-\ntoms. A limitation of the analysis of symptom counts is\nthat no distinction is made between \"pure\" and \"mixed\"\nsymptom profiles. When classes of CD were defined on\nthe basis of the a priori distinction between aggressive\nand nonaggressive symptoms, there was a strong asso-\nciation of migration with the nonaggressive and com-\nbined types of CD profile and no association of migra-\ntion with the aggression-only profile. Similarly, analysis\nof the empirically derived latent classes found much stron-\nger associations with migration for the rule-breaking/\ndeceit and severe latent classes than for the aggressive\nlatent class.\nThese findings are consistent with hypothesized dif-\nferences in the extent of genetic influence on different\ntypes of CD symptoms. If, as twin studies suggest,19 ag-\ngressive symptoms are more strongly influenced by ge-\nnetic factors compared with nonaggressive symptoms, we\nwould expect to find the pattern of results observed in\nthis study, that is, a much smaller intergenerational change\nin aggressive than in nonaggressive symptoms. These data\ndo not allow us to quantify the heritability of either type\nof symptom, and the results should not be interpreted\nas evidence that aggressivity is predominantly genetic.\nRather, this study provides confirmation of the findings\nfrom twin studies regarding the relative contribution of\nenvironmental and genetic factors to different types of\nsymptoms using different methods. In contrast with twin\nstudies, inferences based on this study do not depend on\nthe equal environments assumption. In addition, the range\nof variation in environment is greater in this study than\nin twin studies, which are generally limited to a single\ncountry or region.\nThe difference in association with migration be-\ntween aggressive and nonaggressive symptoms was larger\nin the analysis of CD profiles than in the analysis of symp-\ntom counts. One potential explanation for this pattern\nis that aggressive behaviors that occur along with other\nCD symptoms are more likely to be situational, that is,\ncontextually normative or premeditated,51,52 and there-\nfore more influenced by environmental factors than ag-\ngressive behaviors that occur in isolation from other CD\nsymptoms. For instance, adolescents who are more likely\nto break rules may, through that rule breaking, get into\nsituations or relationships in which aggressive behav-\niors are more common, such as drug trafficking or gang\nactivity. There is some empirical support for a distinc-\ntion between aggressive and nonaggressive CD53,54 (with\nthe former uniquely associated with emotional dysregu-\nlation) that may help explain these differences.\nEvidence of environmental influences on risk for CD\ndoes not rule out the possibility that there are inherited\nliabilities that are triggered or suppressed by environmen-\ning,59 and externalizing behaviors60 have found that, in\nsettingsinwhichtheprevalenceoftheseoutcomesishigher,\ntheir heritability is greater. For instance, there might be\nan inherited liability to CD common to Mexico and the\nUnited States that is more frequently expressed in the\nUnited States because of environmental influences. This\npattern would suggest that CD among Mexican-\nAmericans in the United States would be concentrated\namong offspring of migrants with liability--expressed or\nnot--to CD. Alternatively, there could be distinct inher-\nited liabilities to CD in the 2 environments. This pattern\nwould suggest that CD would be heritable within both\npopulations but not heritable between migrants and their\noffspring. Family studies with follow-up of migrants on\nboth sides of the border are needed to examine these al-\nternative models.\nAlthough the dramatic increase in CD symptoms across\ngenerations within this migrant population implicates en-\nvironmental influences, specification of the particular en-\nvironmental factors remains elusive. The environmen-\ntal changes experienced by migrating populations are\ncomprehensive, involving virtually all aspects of social\ninstitutions, identity, family relationships, language, and\ndiet. Generations of researchers have focused on the dis-\ntinctive social circumstances of immigrants. In the 1920s,\nFaris and Dunham61(pp8-9) observed a configuration of so-\ncial conditions among immigrant groups living in ur-\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association.

The authors believed that immi-\ngrant parents were marginalized from mainstream cul-\nture, while their children were caught between their cul-\nture of origin, to which they often felt little connection,\nand their host culture, which was likely to reject them.\nSimilar explanations in terms of differential accultura-\ncent studies for observations of increased risk for men-\ntal disorders in children of immigrants relative to their\nparents.\nObservation of the increase in risk for psychiatric dis-\norders among descendants of migrants in terms of ex-\nperiences distinctive to migrant communities would sug-\ngest that risk is particularly high in these communities\nrelative to more established populations that do not share\nthese circumstances. However, epidemiologic evidence\ndoes not support this prediction. Differences among eth-\nnic groups in the United States are much smaller than\nare differences between immigrants and US-born indi-\nviduals, and members of ethnic minorities tend to have\nlower rather than higher risk for most psychiatric disor-\nders.65,66 An alternative explanation for the observed\nchanges across immigrant generations is that immi-\ngrants in the United States share the same cultural and\nsocial conditions that account for high risk for psychi-\natric disorders in the United States relative to immi-\ngrants' countries of origin.67 This explanation implies that\ndifferences observed across migrant generations are due\nto influences on the US population as a whole that con-\ntribute to large cross-national differences in disorder\nprevalence.\nThe association between migration and CD symp-\ntoms in this sample should not be generalized across\nmigrant groups. Bird and colleagues26 did not find dif-\nferences in disruptive behaviors between samples of\nPuerto Rican children on the island and in the South\nBronx. However, in that study, parental acculturation\nwas related to disruptive behavior in both samples.68\nOther studies24,47 have found that the association\nbetween US nativity and psychopathologic characteris-\ntics differ between the Mexican and Puerto Rican\npopulations.\nResults of the present study should be interpreted in\nlight of its reliance on retrospective reporting of CD symp-\ntoms and other DSM-IV criteria by adults, a method\nknown to result in underestimates of prevalence due to\nfailures of recall.69,70 To minimize the impact of recall er-\nrors, the sample was limited to respondents younger than\n45 years, but this restriction is unlikely to fully correct\nfor recall errors. Recall errors bias estimates of the preva-\nlence of CD downward but would also affect estimates\nof the relative risk of CD if recall accuracy is associated\nwith migration. Results of tests for statistical interac-\ntions between age and migrant group were not signifi-\ncant in any of the models.\nA second potential limitation arises from the reliance\non contemporaneous samples of generational groups\nrather than the samples drawn from actual multigenera-\ntional families. This is a common method in migration\nstudies, but the assumption that these groups represent\nbiologically connected successive generations may not\nbe accurate. However, the validity of this assumption is\nsupported by the consistency in the finding that Mexican-\nborn immigrants to the United States have lower risk for\npsychiatric disorders compared with the US-born Mexi-\nInternational migration across societies presents a valu-\nable opportunity for biobehavioral research to advance\nunderstanding of the interplay between environments and\ngene expression in the etiology of CD and other com-\nplex psychiatric disorders. Although migration studies\nlack the mathematical formalism that underlies the quan-\ntitative estimation of trait heritability in twin studies, they\nprovide valuable insight into the role of environmental\nfactors in the etiology of disease.73 In this study, com-\nparisons across representative samples of successive gen-\nerations within a migrating population suggest that the\nenvironmental influence on CD is large but restricted to\ncertain subtypes of the disorder. Future studies may be\nable to identify the specific genetic and environmental\nfactors involved in this complex epidemiologic shift in\npsychiatric morbidity, particularly if they include samples\nof migrant families with members in both the sending\nand receiving communities.\nAuthor Affiliations: Health Division, RAND Corpora-\ntion, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Dr Breslau); Depart-\nment of Internal Medicine (Drs Kravitz and Aguilar-\nGaxiola), Center for Health Policy and Research\n(Ms Saito), Department of Pediatrics (Dr Tancredi), and\nDepartment of Psychiatry (Dr Hinton), School of Medi-\ncine, University of California, Davis, Sacramento; De-\npartment of Epidemiology, National Institute of Psychia-\ntry, Mexico City, Mexico (Drs Borges, Benjet, and Medina-\nMora); Departments of Psychiatry and Human Genetics,\nMedical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth Uni-\nversity, Richmond (Dr Kendler); and Edward R.
