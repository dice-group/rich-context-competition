Kelly Raley1\nLarry Bumpass2\n Introduction\nA recent analysis of marriage, divorce and remarriage, presented estimates of divorce\ncalculated from vital statistics data. Schoen and Standish's (2001) paper is important\nbecause it updates prior analyses of the implications of trends in the timing of marriage,\ndivorce, and remarriage on the U.S. life course. We expand on their analysis in three ways.\nFirst, we present differentials in estimates of marital dissolution by three socioeconomic\ncharacteristics: race-ethnicity, age at marriage, and education. Studies of the relative risk\nof disruption are common (e.g. Bramlett & Mosher 2001; Castro Martin & Bumpass 1989;\nSweeney & Phillips 2001), and important for our understanding of the processes involved.\nNonetheless, the substantive implications of differing rates cannot be appreciated fully\nwithout estimates of lifetime disruption for subpopulations. Second, we conduct analyses\nof recent marriage cohorts to identify whether the large differentials in marital dissolution\ndocumented in the first step are growing. In light of the importance of family stability for\nthe lives of both adults and children (Amato 2000), it is surprising that there has been little\nattention in the recent literature to either subgroup differences in the cumulative probability\nof divorce or to changes in relative risks over time. One exception is Teachman's (2002)\nrecent analysis of trends in divorce from the 1950s to the early 1980s. Our analysis extends\nthis trend analysis by examining the period between the early 1980s to the early 1990s.\nFinally, we investigate the impact of cohabitation on the differential in the instability of\nfamily life. If we are to understand trends in family stability, we must take into account the\ndramatic increase in cohabitation. Cohabitation has moved some of the instability of family\nlife out of the statistical accounting system of marriage and divorce. It has thus likely\ncontributed to the plateau by removing an increasing number of disruptions that, in an\nearlier time, would have occurred after marriage. While some cohabiting unions are casual\nalliances, the majority of cohabiting persons think that they will marry their partner and\nmany have definite plans to do so (Bumpass, Sweet, & Cherlin 1991). Our understanding\nof family stability is impaired if we focus only on divorce rates: for example, children's\nfamily lives have become increasingly unstable during the plateau in the divorce rate\n2. Data and methods\n2.1 Differentials in marital dissolution\nOur first objective is to provide estimates of lifetime marital dissolution by age at marriage,\nrace/ethnicity, and education using data from the 1990 June Current Population Survey\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 8, Article 8\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 247\n(CPS). The CPS is conducted monthly by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics, primarily to measure characteristics of the labor force. Each month\napproximately 50,000 households are sampled and interviewed. Every five years between\n1975 and 1995, the June survey included a supplement collecting information on the\nmarital, separation, divorce, and birth histories of adult female members of sampled\nhouseholds.\nContrary to some earlier reports (e.g. Preston and McDonald, 1979; McCarthy,\nPendleton, and Cherlin, 1989), there is reason to believe that survey data can provide good\nestimates of divorce. Goldstein (1999) shows that although both marriages and divorces\nare under-reported in the Current Population Survey, when survey data are used for both\nthe numerators and denominators, the 1990 June CPS closely tracks the crude divorce rates\nestimated from the NCHS vital statistics. Our own previous analyses also show that survey\ndata can replicate vital statistics and that estimates of cohort disruption by specific marital\ndurations are almost identical in each of the June Current Population Surveys from 1975\nWe would prefer to use the 1995 June CPS to represent as recent a period as possible.\n(The 2000 June CPS did not collect marital histories.) Unfortunately, the 1995 CPS\nappears to underestimate levels of marital disruption relative to estimates for the same\ncohorts from the earlier surveys. Consequently, we use the 1990 CPS to calculate our\nperiod estimates of divorce. Given the overall stability in levels of divorce, this should not\naffect our estimates for the total population of first marriages. However, to the extent that\nthere has been divergence in levels of marital instability for different population groups,\nour lifetime estimates understate the differentials we would observe if we had more recent\ndata.\nTo construct period life-table estimates, we calculate marriage duration specific\nprobabilities of marital dissolution between June 1986 and June 1989. Although the CPS\nsample is large, we use a three-year window to increase the stability of the estimates for\nsubgroups. This is especially important for longer durations, where we have a small sample\nof marriages. To construct our lifetable estimates, we calculated the number of people\nthe number of divorces to marriages at each duration between July 86-June 87, July 87-June\n88, and July 88-June 89. (We chose these periods so that we would not count dissolutions\nless than one year old at the time of the survey that may reconcile.) Using this information,\nwe calculated the duration specific divorce rate. We then converted the rate into a\nprobability to calculate the survival function. When duration specific divorce rates are\nstable, as has been the case, such synthetic period estimates represent well the experience\nof marriage cohorts.\nSeparation is used to mark the end of a marriage rather than divorce because the\ntiming of divorce is to some extent an artifact of the legal process and other extraneous\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 8, Article 8\n248 http://www.demographic-research.org\nfactors, and some permanently separated couples never divorce. While separations are\nsometimes followed by reconciliation, the vast majority of those who have not gotten back\ntogether within a year of separation will never do so (Sweet & Bumpass 1974; McCarthy\n1978; Bumpass, Castro Martin, and Sweet 1991). More importantly, some population sub\ngroups experience longer durations between separation and formal divorce and are less\nlikely ever to formally divorce. For example, the duration between separation and formal\ndivorce was greater for blacks than whites (McCarthy 1978) during the 1970s and our\nsupplementary analyses of the NSFG data indicate that this continues to be true. Thus, an\nanalysis of divorce would provide distorted estimates of marital dissolution.\n2.2. Differentials in trends\nThe second part of our analysis uses data from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth\n(NSFG) to produce cohort estimates of the cumulative probability of disruption within 5\nyears for first marriages for two recent marriage cohorts. Our goal is to see whether the\ndifferentials observed in the first part of the analysis are growing. We also use the NSFG\nto examine differentials in the stability of cohabiting unions. The NSFG is conducted\nperiodically by the National Center for Health Statistics with the primary goal of providing\nestimates of factors affecting the U.S. birth rate and the reproductive health of U.S. women\n15-44 years of age. Marital and fertility histories have long been a part of the content of\nthis survey, but Cycle 5 provides complete cohabitation histories for the first time.\nInterviews averaging 105 minutes were conducted with 10,847 respondents over the first\nTo examine whether the plateau in marital dissolution was experienced equally for\nwomen across all socioeconomic categories, we divide the period since 1980 into two\nsamples. To begin with cohorts formed in 1980, we must limit our estimates to first\nmarriages formed at age 30 or younger because of the upper age limit of the sample.\nWomen who were older than age 30 in 1980 are not represented in this sample of women\nunder age 45 in 1995. These estimates are limited to the first five years of marriage\nbecause of the second of these two cohorts is necessarily limited to the first seven years of\nmarriage, and the sample size shrinks with each successive year of duration because of\ncensoring by interview (Note 1). Estimates are prepared for first marriages and for all first\nunions so we can evaluate whether these two perspectives may lead to different conclusions\nabout family experience.\nFinally, using data from the NSFG, we construct discrete-time proportional hazard\nestimates of marital dissolution to examine the statistical significance of any apparent\ndifferences in trends across subgroups. That is, whether there is an interaction between\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 8, Article 8\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 249\nunion cohort and our variables. Using person-years of exposure, these models begin at\nunion formation and are censored by disruption, 5 years duration, or interview. The\ncovariates examined are marriage cohort, education, race-ethnicity, age at marriage,\nwhether the respondent had a birth prior to the marriage, and whether the respondent\ncohabited prior to marriage. Parallel models are estimated for divorce from first marriage\nand for disruption from all first unions (including both marriage and cohabitation).\nFinally, we include interaction terms in the proportional hazard models to see whether\ndifferentials in trends are significant net of controls for other socio-demographic factors.\nThese analyses are weighted to account for the stratified sampling design and differentials\nin non-response. The weights are scaled so that sample size is the same regardless of\nwhether the data are weighted.\n3. Results\nTable 1 provides estimates of the cumulative proportions of marriages expected to have\nended by 5-year durations up to 30 years. The emergence of differentials can be seen over\nsuccessive durations, but we focus this discussion on 30 years as an estimate of the\nproportion of marriages \"ever disrupting.\" (The rate of disruption declines continuously\nafter the first few years of marriage and only 1-2 percent of divorces occur after 30 years\nof marriage (NCHS 1996)). Similar to other recent estimates of the likelihood that a\nmarriage will end in divorce or separation (e.g. Schoen and Standish 2001), we find that\nfor all first marriages about half will dissolve. As noted in the introduction, our\nunderstanding of subgroup differentials in divorce risks is usually set in the context of this\noverall proportion without a substantive grasp of implications of differential rates for the\nlifetime experiences. Not surprisingly, the figure for Non Hispanic Whites is very similar\nto the total. On the other hand, duration-specific rates of the late 1980's imply that 70\npercent of all marriages to black women end in separation or divorce.\nWe also see very large differences in lifetime marital stability by education and age\nat marriage. Sixty percent of first marriages disrupt among women who did not complete\nhigh school compared to slightly over one-third among college graduates. Similarly over\n60 percent of marriages formed before age 20 break up (the proportion is about two-thirds\nfor marriages under age 18) compared to about 40 percent of those begun over age 22. At\nthe same time, marital instability is high relative to most countries in Europe among even\nthose with the lowest rates considered here. For example, 20 percent of college graduates\nhave their first marriage break up within 10 years compared to 20 percent or less for all\nmarriages in Sweden, France and the former West Germany (Andersson and Philipov\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 8, Article 8\n250 http://www.demographic-research.org\n% Marriages Dissolved\nEducation\nRace\nAge at Marriage\nWe turn now to the question of whether the plateau was experienced by each of the\nsubgroups considered here. As described in the methods section, Table 2 presents the\nproportion disrupting within five years for two marriage and union cohorts formed during\nmarital instability remained unchanged between 1980 and 1994. It is noteworthy that these\nestimates replicate almost exactly those from the CPS in Table 1: 21 percent of first\nmarriages end within five years based on the 1987-89 period from the CPS, compared to\n22 percent for the 1987-94 marriage cohort based on NSFG. The differentials observed in\nTable 1 are seen here as well. The first two columns suggest that the plateau was indeed\nshared by all groups with two exceptions. Marital instability appears to have increased\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 8, Article 8\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 251\namong those without a high school diploma, but not among those with a college degree.\nThere may also be a modest increase in the difference in the probability of disruption for\nmarriages preceded by cohabitation compared to those not. The proportional hazard\nmodels discussed below test whether these differences in trends are significant.\nTable 2: Trends in the Proportion of Marriages and Unions Disrupting within 5 years\nof Formation, Total and by Characteristics, for Women Entering Marriage\nNational Survey of Family Growth\nFirst Marriage First Union\nEducation\nRace/Eth\nAge at Formation\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 8, Article 8\n252 http://www.demographic-research.org\nIn contrast to marriage, we see was a modest increase in the instability of first unions. This\nis as we expected given that an increasing proportion of first unions have begun with\ncohabitation, and that a decreasing proportion of cohabiting unions have lead to marriage\n(Bumpass and Lu 2000). Most importantly, the plateau was clearly not equally shared\nwhen we look at the stability of all unions. In particular, black women experienced a 15\npercentage point increase in the likelihood that their first unions dissolve within 5 years,\nrates may have even declined slightly among Hispanic women. Furthermore, the stability\nof unions formed at younger ages decreased: disruption within five years increased 8\n1987-94. Given that we find no increase in marital instability for these groups, an\nimportant element of their experience would be missed if cohabitation had not been\nincluded in this analysis.\nTables 3 and 4 address the question of whether these apparent changes are statistically\nsignificant, for marriages and for all unions respectively. In the leftmost columns of Table\n3, we see that there was no trend in the likelihood of divorce, but that all of the differentials\nin the risk of divorce are large and statistically significant--individually, and net of one\nanother in Model 1. During the plateau, the proportion of marriages begun after\ncohabitation and the proportion begun with children already in the household increased,\nexerting an upward pressure on the divorce rate. On the other hand, the effect of these\nchanges was moderated somewhat by the increase in age at marriage. Once these factors\nare controlled, we observe a modest but significant decline in marital disruption. That is,\nmarital dissolution rate would likely have decreased (Note2).\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 8, Article 8\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 253\nTable 3: Proportional Hazard Models Predicting Dissolution First marriages begun\nDifferentials Differentials in Trends\nEducation\nZero-Order Model 1 Model 2 Model 3\nRelative\nRisk B/se\nRelative\nRisk B/se\nRelative\nRisk B/se\nRelative\nRisk B/se\nEducation (College Grad)\nRace-Ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White)\nInteraction between Cohort and Education\nNotes\n+ Significant at the p < .10.\n* Significant at p < .05.\n** Significant at p < .01.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 8, Article 8\n254 http://www.demographic-research.org\nOnly the interaction terms that were statistically significant--indicating differential\ntrends--are reported in the rightmost columns of Tables 3 and 4. In models 2 and 3 of\nTable 3, the coefficient for marriage cohort reflects trends for college graduates once an\ninteraction term is included in the model. With all variables controlled, college graduates\nexperienced a substantial and significant decline in marital instability. At the same time,\nthe significance and size of the coefficient for the interaction between marriage cohort and\nnot having completed high school indicates divorce rates increased among those with the\nleast education. Thus the relative disadvantage of women with fewer economic resources\nwas reinforced over this period by increasing marital instability, at the same time that risks\ndeclined for women most able to weather the financial consequences of divorce. We also\ninvestigated whether the trends in marital instability differed by race or by premarital\ncohabitation. In neither case was the interaction term significant, indicating that there was\nno divergence in the trend in divorce by either variable.\nA similar analysis of first union dissolution is reported in Table 4. The first row\nindicates that the modest increase in the proportion of first unions ending in 5 years (seen\nin Table 2) is marginally significant (p < .10). Once we control for the offsetting effects\nof age at first union and pre-union fertility, there is no trend in the union stability from the\nearly 1980s to the early 1990s. There are again very large and significant differences in\nstability by socio-demographic characteristics. Once other factors are controlled, as with\nmarriage, unions became more stable during the plateau for those with college degrees, but\nless stable for those who did not complete high school. Somewhat surprisingly, the\napparent increase among those who formed a union at the youngest ages was not supported\nby a significant interaction term (not shown).\nFinally, in contrast to the absence of any change among black women in the risk of\nmarital dissolution, there was a 40 percent increase in the risk of union disruption, even\nthough there was no change among white women. This increase is somewhat larger once\nthe other predictors of union stability are controlled, and it is statistically significant in both\ncases.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 8, Article 8\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 255\nTable 4: Proportional Hazard Models Predicting Dissolution of first unions begun\nDifferentials Differentials in Trends\nEducation Race\nZero-Order Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5\nRelative\nRisk B/se\nRelative\nRisk B/se\nRelative\nRisk B/se\nRelative\nRisk B/se\nRelative\nRisk B/se\nRelative\nRisk B/se\nEducation (College Grad)\nRace-Ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White)\nInteraction between Cohort and Education\nInteraction between Cohort and Race\nNotes\n+ Significant at the p < .10.\n* Significant at p < .05.\n** Significant at p < .01.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 8, Article 8\n256 http://www.demographic-research.org\n4. Conclusion\nWhile it is well known that the likelihood of divorce varies by race, age at marriage, and\neducation, no previous study has made clear the implications of these differentials for the\nlifetime probability of marital dissolution. We estimate that 70 percent of black women's\nfirst marriages will end in divorce, as will 47 percent of white women's marriages. There\nare also substantial variations by education and age at marriage--about 60 percent of the\nmarriages of high school dropouts end in divorce compared to 36 percent among college\ngraduates, and more than three-fifths of teen marriages compared to about 40 percent of\nmarriages begun after age 21.\nThe very high level of marital dissolution among blacks may provide an important\ninsight for understanding the low, and decreasing, marriage rate for this group (Bumpass\nand Lu, 2001) as well as the high proportion of the births to unmarried black women (69\npercent in 1999, Ventura and Bachrach, 2000). It is likely that the more uncertain the\nprospects for marital stability, the more the potential gains from marriage are decreased and\nthe potential costs are increased. There may also be a feedback effect from aggregate to\nindividual stability: i.e. the awareness of that marriages are seldom for a lifetime may\ndecrease the investment in a relationship (Becker 1981), and lower the threshold for leaving\nNot only are differentials large, they appear to be growing. Similar to other studies,\nour results suggest that the overall rates of marital disruption have remained roughly steady\nin recent years. At the same time, the educational disparity in divorce has increased, as\nwomen with a college degree have experienced a decline in the risk of divorce.\nLooking only at marital transitions, however, masks some increase in family instability\nduring the plateau in divorce. Differentials in union stability are increasing considerably.\nWhile there was only a modest overall trend, increases in union disruption have been quite\nsubstantial for the less educated and for African Americans.\nIn sum, the crude divorce rate has declined over the last 20 years, leading many to\nconclude that the common wisdom that half of all marriages will end in divorce is no longer\nvalid (e.g. Popenoe 2001). Some have even suggested that this decline in the (crude)\ndivorce rate may mark the re-emergence of strong, stable families. There are a number of\nproblems with such an interpretation. First, our analysis agrees with Schoen and Standish\n(2001) that divorce rates over the past 20 years imply that approximately half of all\nmarriages will dissolve, and this has not changed since 1980. Second, there is substantial\nvariation in trends both in marital stability and in the stability of all unions. While the odds\nof stable relationships are not all that good for even women with a college education, they\nare clearly lowest for the least advantaged in our society. Further, this disparity has become\nworse during the plateau in divorce. Unfortunately, those have the least resources to\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 8, Article 8\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 257\novercome the costs of family dissolution are experiencing the highest levels and the most\nincrease in the risk.\n5.
