The key\nto understanding the treatment options and the likely success is deciphering the exact\nmorphology of the tract(s) and the amount of sphincter involved. Our aim was to explore\nalternative platforms better to understand complex perianal fistulas through three-\ndimensional (3D) imaging and reconstruction.\nMethods: Digital imaging and communications in medicine images of spectral attenuated\ninversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences were imported onto\nvalidated open-source segmentation software. A specialist consultant gastrointestinal\nradiologist performed segmentation of the fistula, internal and external sphincter. Segmented\nfiles were exported as stereolithography files. Cura (Ultimaker Cura 3.0.4) was used to\nprepare the files for printing on an Ultimaker 3 Extended 3D printer. Animations were created\nin collaboration with Touch SurgeryTM.\nResults: Three examples of 3D printed models demonstrating complex perianal fistula were\ncreated. The anatomical components are displayed in different colours: red: fistula tract;\ngreen: external anal sphincter and levator plate; blue: internal anal sphincter and rectum.\nOne of the models was created to be split in half, to display the internal opening and allow\ncomplexity in the intersphincteric space to better evaluated. An animation of MRI fistulography\nof a trans-sphincteric fistula tract with a cephalad extension in the intersphincteric space was\nalso created.\nConclusion: MRI is the reference standard for assessment of perianal fistula, defining\nanatomy and guiding surgery. However, communication of findings between radiologist and\nsurgeon remains challenging. Feasibility of 3D reconstructions of complex perianal fistula is\nrealized, with the potential to improve surgical planning, communication with patients, and\naugment training.\n",

The disease process itself\nis frequently refractory, with high recurrence and\nreoperation rates.3\u00ad5 A vicious cycle often ensues\ndue to the combination of a recurrent inflamma-\ntory process and distortion of the anorectum from\nscar tissue following each operative procedure.\nInnovation in the imaging of perianal fistula:\na step towards personalised medicine\nKapil Sahnan, Samuel O.

Understanding of complex fistula anat-\nomy by surgeons is sometimes mediated through\ninteractions with radiologists, either informally\nor through multidisciplinary meetings, but may\nstill prove challenging. Also, not all surgeons\nreview imaging with radiologists; it is not always\npossible in environments such as busy clinics or\nin theatre, where better methods than written\nreports are needed to convey satisfactory under-\nstanding for surgery. Explaining fistula anatomy\nand options for surgery to patients amplifies\nthese challenges further, which impact their abil-\nity to make management decisions.\nThere has been an influx of novel techniques to\ntreat perianal fistulas6 of which video-assisted\nanal fistula treatment (VAAFT) is one. A recent\nmeta-analysis found that mean operative time\nidentified in 85.7% of patients, and that recur-\nmedian follow up of 9 months.7 However, this\nunderestimated the complexity encountered in\nincluded in the meta-analysis had Crohn's dis-\nease, and these findings need to be interpreted\nwith caution. It is the first of the novel procedures\nthat combines a diagnostic phase with interven-\ntion and highlights the surgeon's desire for the\noperator to obtain a perioperative mechanism to\nunderstand tract morphology. The technique\nuses a rigid endoscope of fixed diameter, which\nmakes visualization difficult in some cases and\nimpossible in others, particularly in complex\nCrohn's fistula or curved tracts. Whilst the tech-\nnique is not used worldwide, the authors of this\npaper have found the technique particularly use-\nful in complex Crohn's perianal fistula.8\nThree-dimensional (3D) reconstructions offer no\nnew information to the two-dimensional 2D\nimage but act to improve conceptualization,\nwhereby a multitude of 2D pictures/slices, sepa-\nrated by a predetermined slice thickness, are\n`stacked' upon each other to create a 3D repre-\nsentation.9 The 3D imaging provides a more real-\nistic representation of anatomy, based on\ncross-sectional data that has been shown to be a\nuseful aid for patient education, clinical commu-\nnication10 and surgical planning.11 The optimum\nmedium of 3D reconstruction with reference to\nimproving communication and understanding\nmay vary according to the target audience, which\nmay be an expert (consultant surgeon), interme-\ndiate (trainee or medical student) or novice (lay\npublic/patient). The St Mark's IBD patient panel,\nwhen shown previous 3D reconstructions by our\ninstitution,12,13 suggested 3D printing as a viable\nalternative. All media require further evaluation\nnot only for acceptability and efficacy, but also\nresource use (availability of the necessary tech-\nnology, cost and time).\nWe postulate that a physical representation of the\nfistula will further improve patient and surgeon\nunderstanding (or at least facilitate acquisition of\nunderstanding), and also that a `virtual VAAFT' or\nMRI fistulography may help surgeons approaching\nthe fistula in theatre with a probe or VAAFT scope.\nWe have therefore developed these two further\ninnovations for subsequent assessment. We\ndescribe the feasibility of creating 3D-printed fis-\ntula models and MRI fistulography.\nMaterial and methods\nEthical approval\nAfter consultation with the local research and\ndevelopment (R and D) department (London\nNorth West NHS Trust), it was advised that\napproval by a National Health Service (NHS)\nresearch ethics committee or the R and D depart-\nment was deemed unnecessary owing to the non-\npatient identifiable retrospective nature of this\nfeasibility study. The study received departmental\napproval by the research lead of St Mark's\nHospital, London, United Kingdom.\nMagnetic resonance imaging technique\nStandard T2-weighted spectral attenuated inver-\nsion recovery MRI sequences were acquired in\naxial (Repetition time [TR] 8000; Echo Time\nbandwidth 130Hz/Pixel [PX]) and coronal (TR\n130Hz/PX) planes, with a sagittal T2-weighted\nK Sahnan, SO Adegbola et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3\nSegmentation\nDigital imaging and communications in medi-\ncine files of the MRI sequences were generated\nfrom picture archiving and communication sys-\ntem and these were segmented and smoothed\nusing validated open-source software.14,15 A\nspecialist consultant gastrointestinal radiologist\nmanually segmented the following structures\nusing axial sequences: fistula tract; internal\nsphincter; external sphincters/levator plate; and\nrectum.\nThe segmented files were exported as stereo-\nlithography files. We used Cura (Ultimaker Cura\nThe Netherlands) to prepare the files for printing\non an Ultimaker 3 Extended 3D printer.\nAnimations were created in collaboration with\nTouch SurgeryTM.\nResults\nThree-dimensional printing\nSegment scans and 2D axial MRI scans for three\npatients detailing the fistula complex are shown\nin Figure 1. The various anatomical compo-\nnents are displayed in different colours (red: fis-\ntula tract; green: external anal sphincter (EAS)\nand levator plate; blue: internal anal sphincter\n(IAS) and rectum). Segmentation of patient\nimages took approximately 15 min per case. A\nfurther 10 min was required for smoothing and\nuploading the images to the 3D printer. Each of\nthe models took approximately 60 min to make.\nFigure 2 shows various orientations of the 3D\nmodels for the same patients: (1) A transphinc-\nteric fistula (black arrow) with a small blind-\nending cavity (white arrow) beneath the levator\nplate; (2) a transphincteric fistula with the right\ntract (black arrow) passing through the ischioa-\nnal fossa and the left tract (double black arrow)\nbeing blind-ending, connected via a posterior\nhorseshoe (triple black arrow); (3) these images\nshow a right-sided transphincteric fistula (black\narrow) with a blind-ending cranial extension\nbelow the levator (double black arrow), and a\nshort left-sided intersphincteric fistula (white\narrow). Internal openings of the right transphinc-\nteric fistula (double white arrow) and left inter-\nsphincteric fistula (triple white arrow) are shown\non the internal views of the composite model. Of\nnote, the final 3D model has been created so it\ncan come apart to demonstrate the internal\nopening and complexity in the intersphincteric\nspace.\nFigure 1.

In the animation clip,\nwhich is in the form of a `fly through' akin to vir-\ntual colonoscopy, the viewer travels through the\nfistula tract and is oriented by annotations as they\npass through specific sphincter structures.\nDiscussion\nConventional 2D pelvic MRI is the imaging modal-\nity of choice to demonstrate fistula anatomy in anal\nfistula16 and has been shown to reduce recurrence by\ninnovations described in this paper are derived from\nconventional MRI and do not provide any additional\nanatomical information or require additional\nsequences, but they do change the medium by which\nthis information is communicated. MRI fistulogra-\nphy and 3D printing represent further attempts to\nimprove a surgeon's understanding of information\nfrom the MRI, but could also have similar benefits in\nthe explanation to patients and trainees.\nOur MRI parameters are standard compared to\nother institutions,19,20 allowing for ease of adop-\ntion of the technique to other centres. A slice\nthickness of 4 mm provides satisfactory contrast\nbetween different components of the anal canal\nand the fistula with good signal-to-noise ratio.\nAdditionally, there are fewer slices through the\nanal canal, reducing time taken to segment the\nfistula and anal canal. With technology advancing\nrapidly, these innovations represent the first step\nto automated segmentation techniques that have\nbeen described in other specialties,21\u00ad23 including\nabdominal MRI of Crohn's patients,24 and could\nbecome the standard of care for perianal fistulas.\nFigure 2. Three-dimensional perianal anal fistula models.\n(1) Trans-sphincteric fistula with an infralevator extension; (2) trans-sphincteric fistula with a horseshoe; (3) complex trans-\nsphincteric and intersphincteric fistula.\nK Sahnan, SO Adegbola et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 5\nFor surgeons, a 3D model can potentially aid\nunderstanding of the complex relationship\nbetween sphincter anatomy and fistula, guiding\nsurgical decisions and improving outcomes. Our\ninitial experience was of `whole' printed models,\nwhich allowed for an overall appreciation of the\nanatomy, but had similar benefits to 3D images.\nAs our experience grew, we sought to deliver visu-\nalization of intersphincteric complexity and iden-\ntification of key anatomical landmarks such as the\ninternal opening, through the creation of com-\nposite fistula models that can be separated (as in\nthe final panel of Figure 2) to highlight internal\nstructures. The 3D-printed models represent a\n`concrete' step toward personalized medicine.25\nWhilst the technique offers an intuitive benefit,\nclinical utility maybe difficult to ascertain. Any\neffect is likely to be harder to demonstrate\namongst `experts' but may have benefit to those\nsurgeons with less experience and as such, we\nenvisage the junior trainee may benefit the most.\nIn Crohn's perianal fistula, the underlying disease\nprocess can be unforgiving, and sustained remis-\nkey objectives in reducing recurrence are to iden-\ntify correctly and treat all secondary extensions and\ndrain any collections/abscesses.27 VAAFT is a\nrecent innovation that aims to address both\nobjectives.28 Criticisms of the technique are that\nthe rigid scope limits manoeuvrability and as with\nany technique, it carries an associated new expense\nand a learning curve. MR fistulography would\nfacilitate novices in the `diagnostic' phase to iden-\ntify/negotiate tracts with the potential to limit over-\nall operative time, whilst providing a `road map'\nfor more challenging fistulas, aiding identification\nof secondary extensions which might otherwise be\nmissed and lead to inevitable recurrence. And of\ncourse, the same benefit would apply to other\nreparative techniques performed with a clearer\nunderstanding of the tract anatomy.\nThe patient\u00adclinician relationship centres around\nshared decision making, with the clinician offer-\ning options with their associated risks and bene-\nfits, and patients deciding which options are most\nappropriate to their own symptoms and goals. A\nvariety of factors including the patient's prior\nunderstanding and the clinician's interpersonal\nskills, as well as the complexity of the decision\nand a balance of the patient's ability to under-\nstand and the clinician's ability to explain, govern\nthe success of this decision-making process. Some\nof these factors are not modifiable but clinicians\ncan improve their delivery of information, includ-\ning using adjuncts. When the complexity is related\nto anatomical understanding, 3D models provide\na theoretical advantage. An example of this ben-\nefit was demonstrated in a recent study on con-\ngenital heart defects, which quantified the benefit\nof 3D models in facilitating communication with\npatients.29 The study also demonstrated patients'\nenthusiasm for the technique, with over three\nquarters of the study participants asking to keep\nthe models. Further work is needed to confirm\nthis in patients with perianal Crohn's fistula, par-\nticularly in facilitating informed consent.\nAnother potential benefit is in medical education.\nDue to the complexity of tracts and their relation-\nship with the anal sphincter, perianal fistulas are\nan example of a topic that is not only hard to\nunderstand but also hard to teach. Such topics\nlend themselves to 3D reconstruction very well.\nMuch of the key to understanding the treatment\noptions, difficulties, and likely success of surgery\nis in deciphering the exact morphology of the\ntract(s) and the amount of sphincter involved. If\nthe trainee does not understand the fistula, they\ncannot plan surgery, consent patients or under-\nstand how their consultant does so. We have pre-\nviously demonstrated an international appetite\nFigure 3. Animation demonstrating a magnetic\nresonance fistulography, a `fly through' of the fistula\ntract as it passes through the sphincter complex\n(the animation is available on the journal site as the\nonline supplementary material).\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11\n6 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nfor 3D reconstructions at an international confer-\nence at which 85% of respondents expect 3D\nmodelling to be useful for perianal fistula surgery\nThe precise metric needed to demonstrate clini-\ncal utility is part of future work. We postulate that\nthe metric will be stakeholder (surgeon: generalist\nversus specialist, trainee, patient) and time spe-\ncific (pre-, peri-, postoperatively, such as in\ndescribing the nature of a case to a lay audience as\npart of a medico-legal proceeding).\nThe aim of this feasibility study was to prove the\nconcept and develop experience in producing 3D\nimaging, 3D models and MRI fistulography.\nThere are several limitations of this proof-of-con-\ncept study. Firstly, expertise is required to create\nthe 3D images, models and fistulography. The\naccuracy of the segmentation of the fistula and\nthe sphincter complex is dependent on the radi-\nologist, but the technique is generalizable and\nuses open-source software. The use of 3D print-\ning is increasingly widespread, and institutions in\nwhich a need exists for such models are often\naffiliated with universities and can be granted\naccess to 3D printers. An additional resource\nconsideration is cost (printer and materials) and\nas such, one may choose to limit such techniques\nto complex or refractory cases. Future improve-\nments in clinical applicability, in terms of raw\nmaterials to print with, speed of printing and\nreduced costs, are likely to make 3D printing\nmore widespread.31 Ultimately, the benefit of\nthese techniques in patient understanding, train-\ning of junior surgeons and communication\nbetween radiologist and surgeon, needs to be\ndemonstrated in further work, underway at our\ninstitution.\nConclusion\nMRI fistulography and 3D-printed models have\nbeen developed with specific functions in mind.\nWe suggest that 3D-printed models will offer a\nmedium to enhance the education of trainees and\na useful adjunct for communication with patients.\nMRI fistulography is a concept that has been\nderived from the success of virtual colonoscopy\nand offers the operating surgeon a realistic road\nmap to follow. Both of these innovative tech-\nniques offer intuitive advantages to surgeons,\ntrainees and patients but the effect of these needs\nobjective assessment.\n"
