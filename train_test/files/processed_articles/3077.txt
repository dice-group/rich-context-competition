Percentages of energy from dietary fat\nparalleled these findings and were also significantly higher for black than for white\nboys. Blood pressure levels were higher for black girls than for white girls in every age\ngroup, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels were highest for black and Mexican Ameri-\ncan girls and boys in every age group. In contrast, smoking prevalence was highest\nfor white girls and boys, especially for those from low-SES homes (77% of young men\nand 61% of young women, aged 18-24 years, from low-SES homes were current smok-\ners). All ethnic differences remained significant after accounting for SES and age.\nConclusion These findings show strong ethnic differences in CVD risk factors among\nyouths of comparable age and SES from a large national sample.

Fur-\nthermore, few have controlled for po-\ntential confounding from socioeco-\nnomic status (SES), a powerful predictor\nAlthough there is some evidence that\nchildhood SES can affect CVD in adult-\nhood,25 to our knowledge, there are no\nnational studies of children that have\nevaluated the impact of both ethnicity\nand SES on multiple CVD risk factors.\nHowever, several recent national stud-\nies of adults have found that ethnic dif-\nferences in CVD risk factors remained af-\nter accounting for individual as well as\nfamily-level indicators of SES.9,26 While\nadjusting for SES does not fully ac-\ncount for all of the attributes of socio-\neconomic position, these studies sug-\ngest that biological, behavioral, cultural,\nmedical, and societal factors may con-\ntribute to ethnic variations in CVD risk\nfactors independently of SES.\nIn this article we used data from a large\nnational probability sample of black,\nMexican American, and white (non-\nHispanic) children and young adults. We\nexamined ethnic differences in CVD risk\nfactors, the ages at which ethnic differ-\nences were first apparent, and whether\nethnic differences remained after ac-\ncounting for 2 different measures of SES.\nMETHODS\nThe Third National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES III),\nconducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics, was designed to assess\nthehealthandnutritionalstatusoftheUS\nnoninstitutionalized civilian popula-\ntion.27 It oversampled black and Mexi-\ncan American populations and included\nmonths and older.28 The survey was con-\nducted at 89 locations in two 3-year\nfied, multistage probability cluster sam-\npling, similar to that used by previous\nNHANE surveys.

The survey included demographic,\nSES, dietary, and health history ques-\ntions. All survey instruments were avail-\nable in both English and Spanish.

Race or ethnic-\nity was based on asking respondents to\nidentify themselves as follows: black;\nMexican or Mexican American; white,\nnon-Hispanic; Asian or Pacific Is-\nlander; Aleut, Eskimo, or American In-\ndian; or other Latin American or other\nSpanish. Respondents who chose 1 of the\nfirst 3 categories are included in our\nanalyses. The NHANES III collected data\non several indicators of SES. We used\neducational attainment of the head of the\nhousehold as our primary indicator of\nSES because, unlike income and occu-\npation, education had little missing data,\nisavailableregardlessofemployment out-\nside the home, and is unlikely to be in-\nfluenced by CVD-related morbidity.29 We\nused poverty-income ratio as our sec-\nondary indicator of SES. The poverty-\nincome ratio is the ratio of 2 compo-\nnents: the numerator is the family income\nand the denominator is an assessment of\nthe income level that is minimally ad-\nequate for a family of that size for that\ncalendar year. Education of the head of\nthe household and poverty-income ra-\ntio were moderately correlated (r = 0.42,\nP.001), a finding consistent with pre-\nIndicators of CVD Risk\nIndicators of CVD risk were as follows:\n\u00b7 Body mass index, a preferred mea-\nsure of body fatness for children and ado-\n\u00b7 Percentage of energy from dietary fat,\nestimated on the basis of a single 24-\nhour dietary recall, administered by a\ntrained dietary interviewer with a proxy,\nif necessary, for children 6 to 11 years\nof age.\n\u00b7 Current cigarette smoking status, de-\nfined as smoking at least 100 cigarettes\nduring one's lifetime and currently smok-\ning cigarettes, based on self-report and\nnot assessed for children younger than\n8yearsofage.Serumcotininelevels (74\nphase I participants, were used to vali-\ndate smoking status.\n\u00b7 Systolic blood pressure, measured in\nmillimeters of mercury.

Smoking rates in adults\nremained low for Mexican American\nwomen and increased for black men.\nThese comparisons between age groups\noffer insight into the progression of eth-\nnic differences in CVD risk factors into\nadulthood. However, the data are based\non cross-sectional surveys; thus, when\nthe youth from younger age groups grow\nolder, they may not show the same risk\nfactor levels that were observed for youth\nfrom the older age groups in this sample.\nThe significant interactions noted in\nthe linear models (Table 2) can be seen\nin Tables 3 and 4 and the FIGURE. For\nBMI, black girls and boys had steeper in-\ncreases in BMI levels than white girls and\nboys across age groups, resulting in\ngreater ethnic differences in the older age\ngroups than the younger age groups (sig-\nnificant interaction between black eth-\nnicity and age). For smoking, ethnic dif-\nferences were larger at the lower levels\nof education than at the higher levels. As\nshown in the Figure, white youths, 18\nto 24 years old, from families with lower\neducational attainment reported sub-\nstantially higher smoking rates than black\nand Mexican American youths from fami-\nlies with similar educational attainment\nyoung white women were current smok-\ners compared with 35% of minority\nyouth). With increasing education,\nsmoking rates decreased sharply and\nwere similar across ethnic groups.\nCOMMENT\nThesefindingsareamongthefirsttoshow\nhigher levels of BMI, energy from di-\netary fat, blood pressure, and glyco-\nsylated hemoglobin, and lower rates of\nsmoking for black and Mexican Ameri-\ncan youths than white youths of compa-\nrable SES and age from a national sample.\nThe findings are especially important be-\ncause they add insight into the course of\ndevelopment of ethnic differences in CVD\nrisk factors from childhood to young\nadulthood. Because the cardiovascular\nhealth of adults is determined, in part, by\npersonal behaviors and societal influ-\nences present during childhood and\nlearn when ethnic differences in CVD risk\nfactors are first apparent so that preven-\ntive interventions can be initiated before\nunhealthy lifestyles are established.\nOurfindingsareconsistentwithanum-\nber of studies comparing black and white\nyouth, or Mexican American and white\nstudies have not always found the same\nsignificant ethnic differences in CVD risk\nfactors; for example, our findings con-\ntrast with some studies for BMI, blood\npressure, smoking, and lipoprotein lev-\nfirst from a nationally representative\nsample of children and young adults,\nspanning the entire age range from 6 to\n24 years. Some of the differences may be\nexplained by selection bias in previous\nstudies, not accounting for SES, or eth-\nnic groups that do not overlap sufficiently\nin SES distributions to permit valid ad-\njustment for SES.\nStrengths and Limitations\nNHANES III is the most comprehen-\nsive national survey with data on CVD\nrisk factors for children and young adults\nin the United States. The survey in-\ncludes an oversampling of black and\nMexican American children, the 2 larg-\nest groups of ethnic minority children.\nBecause NHANES I and II did not in-\nclude large numbers of Mexican Ameri-\ncan children and the Hispanic HANES\ndid not include white children, this is the\nfirst NHANE survey to allow a direct\ncomparison of Mexican American and\nwhite children. It also includes large\nnumbers of children in each ethnic group\nfrom households at both the upper and\nlower levels of educational attainment.\nExtensive data are available from the\nhome survey and medical examination,\nincludingstandardizedmeasuresofblood\npressure, lipids, and glycosylated hemo-\nglobin, and several measures of SES.\nDespite these strengths, our results\nshould be interpreted with caution be-\ncause of several design and measure-\nment limitations. First, the cross-\nsectional design of NHANES III limits our\nability to draw inferences about devel-\nopmental or causal pathways and high-\nlights the need for longitudinal studies\nto provide more definitive answers to re-\nsults from cross-sectional studies. Sec-\nond, our measures of SES may exhibit a\ncertain degree of residual confounding\nwith ethnicity, even after adjustment for\neducational attainment or poverty level.\nIt is well-known that the same level of\nSES does not confer the same economic\nand social benefit to ethnic minority\nyouth as to white youth.40-42 In a previ-\nous NHANES III analysis, we found that\nequal levels of education did not trans-\nlate into equal levels of income; for ex-\nample, black and Mexican American\nwomen with a high school diploma were\n2 to 3 times more likely than white\nwomen of the same educational level to\nlive in poverty.9 Third, there is the po-\ntential for bias from self-reported ques-\ntions such as those on smoking and di-\netary fat. We validated self-reported\nsmoking by examining a biochemical\nmeasure, serum cotinine. Among par-\nticipants who reported being nonsmok-\nMexican American, and white youths,\nfrom homes where the educational level\nyears, respectively, had positive coti-\nnine values, indicating low levels of un-\nderreporting of smoking. Although self-\nreported measures of dietary intake are\nproblematic, the 24-hour dietary recall\nis considered an appropriate measure for\nassessing average population-based di-\netary data.43 Finally, the NHANES III data\nlack consistent physical activity ques-\ntions for youth. There were 2 questions\nabout exercising that were asked of youth\n8 to 16 years old; neither of these 2 ques-\ntions were asked of older youth, who in-\nstead were asked about leisure time ac-\ntivity. As a result, we did not include\nphysical activity in our analysis.\nImplications\nOur findings suggest potential critical pe-\nriods during childhood when preven-\ntive interventions may be most effec-\ntive. Interventions to reduce ethnic\ndifferences in excess weight should start\nin early childhood and continue through\nadulthood, with particular attention to\nblack and Mexican American girls.1,44\nSpecial attention should be devoted to\ninterventions to reduce fat intake20,45 and\nincrease physical activity.46 The large eth-\nnic differences in BMI at early ages are\nespecially important because excess\nweight in children is a risk factor for coro-\nnary heart disease morbidity and mor-\ntality47,48 and may precipitate early on-\nset of other CVD risk factors, including\nelevated blood pressure, adverse lipid lev-\ntions to prevent type 2 diabetes should\nalso focus on black and Mexican Ameri-\ncan girls and boys, as glycosylated he-\nmoglobin levels were already greater than\nthose of white girls and boys by 6 to 9\nyears of age.\nThe high rates of smoking among\nwhite youth from families with lower\neducational levels are alarming (ie, 61%\nof young women and 77% of young men\nsmoked). This group is often over-\nlooked because data for white youth are\nusually presented aggregated across lev-\nels of SES, thus masking the greatly el-\nevated rates among lower SES youth. The\nlower smoking rates among black and\nMexican American youth should not pro-\nmote complacency since new evidence\nshows dramatic increases in their smok-\ning rates.50 Our finding that lower SES\nyouth from each ethnic group have\nhigher smoking rates than their higher\nSES counterparts highlights the need to\nunderstand individual and societal fac-\ntors that influence lower SES youth to\nstart and continue to smoke.\nOur results suggest that preventive in-\nterventions for many CVD risk factors\nneed to start early in childhood and con-\ntinue throughout adolescence and into\nadulthood. The ethnic differences we\nfound in risk factors, including BMI, en-\nergy from dietary fat, cigarette smok-\ning, systolic blood pressure, and glyco-\nsylated hemoglobin, evident as early as\n6 to 9 years of age, reinforce the need for\nearly interventions.37 The focus of atten-\ntion in youth should be on promoting\npopulation-wide, heart-healthy behav-\niors in both children and their parents\nthrough programs at the family, school,\ncommunity, and public policy levels.\nGiven the increasing diversity of Ameri-\ncans, it is critical to tailor programs to\nthe culture of youths, their group-\nspecific attitudes, perceptions, expecta-\ntions, norms, and values, and to appro-\npriate languages and literacy levels.\nFinally, it is essential that preventive in-\nterventions be placed in a social con-\ntext because of the countervailing soci-\netal forces that affect heart-healthy\nlifestyles.\nFunding/Support: This work was done during the ten-\nure of an Established Investigatorship Award to Dr\nWinkleby and a Clinician-Scientist Award to Dr Rob-\ninson from the American Heart Association, and a grant\nto Dr Sundquist from the Swedish Medical Research\nCouncil, and from an American Heart Association Na-\ntional Grant-in-Aid and US Public Health Service grant\nBlood Institute to Dr Winkleby.\n"
