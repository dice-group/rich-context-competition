We obtained information about prenatal\nand perinatal factors by interview and medical record review, and\nmeasured BP three times at age 6.5 years.\nResult: Adjusting for sex, age, sociodemographic variables and height\nZ-score; for each Z-score birth weight for gestational ageFwhich\nrepresents fetal growthFsystolic BP at 6.5 years was 0.7 mm Hg higher\n(95% confidence interval \u00c00.1, 1.6). Maternal age, pre-pregnancy weight,\ngestational weight gain, smoking, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes,\nand child gestational age and neonatal complications were also not\nassociated with BP.\nConclusion: In contrast to full-term infants, slower fetal growth was not\nassociated with higher BP in former preterm, low birth weight infants.\nKeywords: blood pressure; premature infant; fetal growth\nIntroduction\nCompared with infants born full term, former preterm infants have\nhigher blood pressure (BP) in adolescence and adulthood, with\nstudies reporting systolic BP 2.4 to 13 mm Hg higher in former\npreterm infants compared with term-born controls.1\u00ad9 Identifying\nthe determinants of higher BP in this population may allow\nclinicians to identify which former preterm children and adults\nare at highest risk for developing hypertension and its sequelae\nlater in life, and would also help elucidate the underlying\nmechanisms of fetal BP programming.\nIn animal models of fetal growth restriction, growth-restricted\noffspring develop sustained BP elevation after birth,10 consistent\nwith the biological phenomenon of developmental programming.\nIn human populations born at or near term, investigators have\nfound associations of fetal growth restrictionFas represented by\nlower birth weightFwith later BP elevation,11 and have identified\nother prenatal determinants of higher BP, including\npreeclampsia,12\u00ad16 other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy17\nand maternal smoking.18 Little information exists regarding the\nextent to which these and other prenatal and perinatal factors\ninfluence later BP in preterm populations.\nThe objective of our study was to examine associations of\nmaternal and child prenatal and perinatal factors with systolic BP at\nschool age in a large sample of preterm, low birth weight infants.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nWe performed a secondary analysis of data from the Infant Health\nand Development Program (IHDP), an eight-center longitudinal\npost-discharge early child development intervention. Participants\nwere enrolled in IHDP at the time of their newborn hospitalization.\nThe methods of IHDP have been described elsewhere in detail.19\nThe trial's primary outcomes related to cognitive development,\nbehavior and health status have been reported through 18 years of\nage.20\u00ad22 Institutional review boards for all participating centers\napproved the study and caregivers provided written informed\nconsent.\nParticipants were eligible for this analysis if they were from\none of the seven IHDP study sites that conducted a clinical exam,\nincluding BP at age 6.5 years. Of the 931 eligible participants,\nCorrespondence: Dr MB Belfort, Division of Newborn Medicine, Children0s Hospital Boston,\nE-mail: mandy.belfort@childrens.harvard.edu\nwww.nature.com/jp\nthese, 694 (86%) had any BP data recorded. The main reason for\nmissing BP data was that the study visit was completed at a\nlocation other than the IHDP clinical site, such as by telephone\nor in the mother's home. All 694 participants had data for at least\none predictor variable, so they were included in the final sample\nfor analysis.\nMeasurements\nAt the time of enrollment, study staff collected data regarding\nmaternal and child health from the medical record, including\nbirth weight, gestational age, birth order, maternal age and\npregnancy and neonatal complications. Pregnancy complications\nincluding preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders were\nrecorded if they were noted in the medical record.\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia was defined as requiring\nsupplemental oxygen for >30 consecutive days or requiring\nventilator therapy with chest X-ray findings consistent with the\ndiagnosis. Mothers were interviewed regarding their weight\n(pre-conception and at delivery), smoking and alcohol intake\nduring pregnancy and socio-demographic factors.\nWhen children were 6.5 years old, study staff followed a\nstandardized protocol to measure resting BP three times in the right\narm by auscultation (n \u00bc 164) or Dinamap automated oscillometric\ndevice Critikon, Tampa, FL, USA (n \u00bc 530). The correct cuff size was\nchosen based on the measured mid-arm circumference. Staff also\nrecorded the participants' behavioral state at the time of BP\nmeasurement as `fully cooperative' or `somewhat cooperative and\nfussy', and did not attempt to measure BP if the participant or parent\nrefused (n \u00bc 2).\nAnalysis\nOur primary outcome was the mean systolic BP at age 6.5 years.\nAlthough systolic BP predicts later outcomes better than diastolic\nBP,23 we also examined mean diastolic BP as a secondary outcome.\nContinuous predictors were maternal age, pre-pregnancy weight\nand gestational weight gain, and child birth weight, gestational\nage, birth order and fetal growth as represented by birth weight for\ngestational age Z-score based on a national reference.24 Categorical\npredictors were pregnancy and neonatal complications including\npreeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes\nand bronchopulmonary dysplasia, fetal growth status, with small\nfor gestational age (SGA) defined as birth weight for gestational\nage <10th percentile, and smoking and alcohol intake in\npregnancy. We considered confounding by socio-demographic\nvariables including maternal race/ethnicity, attained education\nlevel and annual household income, all assessed at the time of\nstudy enrollment.\nWe used multivariable linear regression to examine associations\nof predictor variables with the mean systolic and diastolic BP in\nmm Hg at 6.5 years, adjusting all analyses for the exact age in days\nat the time of BP measurement, measurement method\n(auscultation versus automated) and the child's behavioral state\nat the time of measurement. In examining the effect of gestational\nweight gain on BP, we additionally adjusted for gestational age\nat birth. We also adjusted estimates for socio-demographic\nvariables and for height Z-score at age 6.5 years, based on the\nCenters for Disease Control growth reference,25 because height is an\nimportant determinant of BP and may be affected by prenatal\nand perinatal factors. As IHDP included children born at a wide\nrange of gestational ages, and to facilitate comparison with\nother published studies,3,5,26 which included only very preterm\ninfants, we stratified our fetal growth analyses by gestational\nage category (<32 weeks versus X32 weeks). We used SAS\nversion 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) for all analyses.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the 694 children included in this analysis and\ntheir mothers are shown in Table 1. Median (range) birth weight\nwas 34 (25, 37) weeks. The median birth weight for gestational age\nZ-score, which reflects fetal growth was \u00c01.1, showing that on\naverage, fetal growth for this cohort was approximately 1 s.d. below\nthe median for a contemporary national reference population.24\nUsing the same reference population, 39% of this cohort was\nSGA, defined as having a birth weight for gestational age percentile\n<10. These characteristics were similar for the original IHDP\ncohort of 1080 children (data not shown). In comparison to\nthe original IHDP cohort, mothers of children included in this\nanalysis were somewhat more likely to be black (59 versus 53%)\nand less likely to have a college degree (28 versus 33%).\nTable 2 shows associations of maternal and child variables with\nsystolic BP at 6.5 years. In model 1, estimates were adjusted for\nchild age, sex, BP measurement conditions and socio-demographic\nvariables. For each Z-score increment in birth weight for\ngestational age, systolic BP at age 6.5 years was 1.0 mm Hg higher\n(95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2, 1.9). Additional adjustment\nfor height Z-score at 7 years (model 2) attenuated this estimate\nappropriate for gestational age. The presence of maternal\nhypertensive disorder was associated with higher systolic BP in the\nfor maternal hypertensive disorder in the fetal growth models did\nnot change the effect estimates, nor did adjustment for body mass\nindex at 6.5 years (data not shown). None of the other maternal or\nchild predictor variables was substantially associated with child\nsystolic BP (Table 2), nor was any predictor variable associated\nwith diastolic BP (data not shown).

Studies in full-term children suggest that\nSGA status at birth is a risk factor for later hypertension.27 In\ncontrast, our study, which included only children born preterm\nand low birth weight, found that fetal growth restriction was not\nassociated with higher BP. In fact, we found that poorer fetal\ngrowth was associated with slightly lower systolic BP at school age,\nalthough the result was not statistically significant after adjustment\nfor attained height.\nA large study26 of Dutch infants born at <32 weeks gestation\nand/or <1500 g (very low birth weight) also examined the\nassociation of fetal growth with later BP. That population-based\nstudy found no association of birth weight s.d. score, a measure of\nfetal growth, with systolic BP at age 19 years; our point estimate of\n1.0 mm Hg per Z-score falls within that study's 95% CI of \u00c00.7 to\n1.7. Studies led by Hack et al.3 in the United States and Doyle\net al.5 in Australia also failed to find an association of poorer fetal\ngrowth with higher BP later in life. Our study extends the findings\nof those studies, demonstrating that in heavier and more mature\npreterm infants, as well as in VLBW infants, fetal growth restriction\ndoes not appear to be a risk factor for later hypertension.\nAdditionally, in contrast to studies in full-term children,12\u00ad14 we\ndid not find that maternal preeclampsia was associated with higher\nschool age BP. We also did not find an association of maternal\nsmoking with offspring BP, in contrast to one study in a full-term\ncohort,18 but consistent with the results of another.28 A possible\nexplanation for the discrepant findings between full-term and\npreterm populations relates to the timing of prenatal exposures.\nThe developmental origins of health and disease paradigm rests\non the hypothesis that exposures during critical periods of\ndevelopment, particularly fetal life and early infancy, can program\nlong-term health.29 It is possible that fetal growth restriction,\npreeclampsia and/or maternal smoking late in the third trimester\ninfluence BP, whereas the same exposures earlier in gestation, as\nexperienced by infants born preterm, do not.\nStudies11,30 in children born full term have found that more\nrapid weight gain in infancy is associated with higher BP later in\nlife. However, the extent to which more rapid early weight gain\nleads to higher BP in preterm populations is unclear. In this\ncohort, faster weight gain in the first year of life was associated\nwith only slightly higher (1.1 mm Hg per Z-score weight gain)\nsystolic BP at age 6.5 years, only for children born at X32 weeks\ngestation.31 Weight gain later in childhood may also be an\nimportant determinant of later BP in children born preterm.15\nOur study is limited by the fact that children in IHDP were born\nin the 1980's when clinical care of preterm, low birth weight\ninfants differed from current practices. Additionally, obesityFan\nimportant determinant of BPFhas become substantially more\nprevalent since that time. A majority of IHDP mothers were poor,\nblack and had attained low levels of education, possibly limiting\ngeneralizability, although participants were enrolled at eight\ncenters across the country. Additionally, when compared with a\ncontemporary reference population,24 39% of our cohort was\nconsidered SGA. Thus, despite overall poorer fetal growth in our\nstudy population compared with a contemporary cohort, we still did\nnot find an association of fetal growth restriction with higher BP.\nBP was measured by auscultation in some centers and\noscillometric device in others, but associations of fetal growth and\nother predictor variables with BP were similar regardless of BP\nmeasurement method.\nIn summary, we found that, in former preterm low birth weight\ninfants, slower fetal growth was not associated with higher BP later\nin life. Fetal growth restriction does not appear to be a risk\nfactor for later hypertension in this population.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n"
