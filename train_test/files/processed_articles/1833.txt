In addition to\nthe 25.4 percent of US adults who do no leisure-time phys-\nical activity (4), the sedentary behaviors of television viewing\nand computer use (i.e., media use) are increasing.

Cigarette\nsmokers weigh less than nonsmokers, because smoking in-\nversely affects weight through biologic and behavioral\nmechanisms (13\u00ad17). Nicotine's physiologic effects result\nin appetite suppression, increased resting metabolic rates,\nand reduced calorie storage (18\u00ad20). Smoking is related to\ndecreased meal size (18), and some smokers may use smok-\ning as a marker for meal termination (e.g., smoking rather\nthan consuming dessert) or simply substitute cigarettes for\nmeals altogether (20). Studies of weight gain and coronary\nmortality (21) and of body mass index and mortality (22)\nexamined smoking status as an effect modifier and found\nthat these associations vary by smoking status.\nExamination Survey (NHANES) to examine the association\nbetween media use (television viewing and computer use\noutside of work) and overweight or obesity among a repre-\nsentative sample of US adults. The primary research ques-\ntion was whether the association between level of media use\nand overweight and obesity was modified by cigarette smok-\ning status.\nData\nNHANES is an ongoing national household interview\nsurvey of a representative sample of the US population.\nSurvey data are released for public use in 2-year cycles.\nThe survey uses both household interview surveys and med-\nical examinations to assess the health and nutritional status\nof the US population.

Response categories (hours) were\nas follows: less than 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more hours, or none.\nMedia use was categorized for analysis as less than 1, 1, 2, 3,\nor 4 or more hours.\nCigarette smoking\nRespondents were asked, ``Have you smoked at least 100\ncigarettes in your entire life?'' and ``Do you now smoke\ncigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?'' Respondents\nwho answered that they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes\nand currently smoke cigarettes every day or some days were\nclassified as smokers. Respondents who answered that they\nhad not smoked at least 100 cigarettes or do not currently\nsmoke cigarettes were classified as nonsmokers. Former\nsmokers were defined as those who had smoked at least\n100 cigarettes but do not currently smoke cigarettes. We\nanalyzed former smokers (n \u00bc 2,253) and never smokers\n(n \u00bc 4,328) separately and found that the odds ratios for\noverweight and obesity among daily media use categories\nwere not significantly different. Thus, we felt it appropriate\nto combine never and former smokers for analysis.\nPhysical activity\nMeasurement of leisure-time physical activity was de-\nrived from a series of eight questions inquiring about fre-\nquency and duration of moderate- and vigorous-intensity\nleisure-time physical activities. Participants were first\nasked, ``Over the past 30 days, did you do any vigorous\nactivities for at least 10 minutes that caused heavy sweating\nor large increases in breathing or heart rate?'' Respondents\nwho answered ``yes'' were handed a card with a list of 24\nvigorous-intensity activities and an ``other'' category and\nasked to report the frequency and duration of each listed\nactivity that they had done. For moderate-intensity activity,\nparticipants were asked, ``Over the past 30 days, did you do\nany moderate activities for at least 10 minutes that caused\nonly light sweating or a slight to moderate increase in heart\nrate?'' Respondents who answered ``yes'' were handed\na card with a list of 32 moderate-intensity activities and\nasked to report the frequency and duration of each listed\nactivity that they had done. Participants were categorized\nas regularly active (vigorous-intensity activity for 3 days\nand 60 minutes per week or moderate-intensity activity\nfor 5 days and 150 minutes per week), irregularly active\n(10 minutes of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activity\nper week but less than regularly active), and inactive (<10\nminutes of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activity per\nEnergy intake\nThe total daily energy intake was estimated from\na 24-hour dietary interview inquiring about the foods and\nbeverages consumed during the 24 hours prior to the inter-\nview (27). Total energy intake was expressed in kilocalories\nand divided into quartiles for analysis. The energy intake\nvariable was also transformed as the log of total kilocalories/\nday; analytical results (not shown) were equivalent to those\nfrom the quartile analysis. Because NHANES dietary as-\n(nutrient values were revised, and the software used to cal-\ndata separately to determine if this change affected the study\nanalysis; therefore, we included both cycles of data in the\nanalysis.\nDemographics\nDemographic information was collected by a question-\nnaire administered during the household interview. The\nvariables analyzed were sex, age, race/ethnicity (White non-\nHispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Mexican American, other),\nand education (less than high school, high school, more than\nhigh school).\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using SUDAAN, version 9.0, soft-\nware (SUDAAN Statistical Software Center, Research\nTriangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina)\nto account for the complex sample selection design and to\nweight the sample to the US population. Multinomial\nregression was used to calculate the odds ratios and 95 percent\nconfidence intervals of overweight and obesity compared\nwith normal weight by categories of media use. Physical\nactivity, age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and energy\nintake were examined as potential covariates in the regres-\nsion model. Effect modification by cigarette smoking was\nevaluated by adding an interaction term (cigarette smoking\nstatus 3 media use) to a statistical model of media use,\ncigarette smoking, physical activity, age, gender, race/\nethnicity, education, and energy intake. Separate models\nwere then analyzed for smokers and nonsmokers to examine\nsmoking status as an effect modifier of the association\nbetween media use and overweight or obesity.\nRESULTS\nInformation on demographics, media use, physical activ-\nity, and body mass index by cigarette smoking status of the\nstudy population is provided in table 1. Cigarette smokers\nwere more commonly men, were aged 20\u00ad34 years, had\na high school education or less than a high school education,\nwere inactive, had normal body weight, and were heavier\nusers of media daily. In contrast, nonsmokers were more\ncommonly women, had more than a high school education,\nwere regularly active, and were lighter users of media daily\nthan were smokers, and two thirds were overweight or\nobese. Cigarette smokers and nonsmokers were significantly\ndifferent (p < 0.05) for all demographic characteristics ex-\ncept race/ethnicity.\nObesity, media use, and physical activity differed be-\ntween cigarette smokers and nonsmokers (table 2). The\nprevalence of obesity increased and regular physical activity\ndecreased with more hours of daily media use in non-\nsmokers. Among nonsmokers, the prevalence of obesity\ndoubled when comparing media use of less than 1 hour daily\nwith media use of 4 or more hours daily. The prevalence of\nregular physical activity also decreased with increasing\nhours of daily media use in nonsmokers. In contrast, among\nTABLE 1.

The odds of overweight and obesity are significantly\nelevated with 2 or more hours of daily media use. Adding\nan interaction term (cigarette smoking status 3 media use,\np \u00bc 0.02) resulted in similar odds ratios for overweight and\neven higher odds ratios for obesity with increasing hours of\ndaily media use.\nBecause effect modification by cigarette smoking was\nevident, data for smokers and nonsmokers were analyzed\nseparately (table 4). Smokers with 4 or more hours of daily\nmedia use had nonsignificantly elevated odds ratios for\noverweight and obesity, after adjustment for demographics,\nphysical activity, and energy intake, compared with smokers\nusing less than 1 hour of media daily. Adjustment for the\naverage number of cigarettes smoked per day in the past\n30 days also did not change the results (data not shown).\nAmong nonsmokers, media use of 2 or more hours/day\ncompared with less than 1 hour/day was significantly asso-\nciated with being overweight or obese (table 4). After ad-\njustment for demographics, physical activity level, and\nenergy intake, nonsmokers using media 4 or more hours\ndaily were significantly more likely to be overweight and\nalmost 4 times more likely to be obese than were non-\nsmokers using media less than 1 hour daily. When former\nsmokers and never smokers were analyzed separately, the\nodds ratios for overweight and obesity when comparing\nthose with 4 or more hours of media use daily with those\nwith less than 1 hour of media use daily were not signifi-\ncantly different (overweight never smokers: odds ratio\nDISCUSSION\nIn this nationally representative sample, cigarette smok-\ning modified the association between hours of daily media\nuse and overweight and obesity. Cigarette smokers using\nmedia 4 or more hours daily had nonsignificantly elevated\nodds of overweight and obesity. In contrast, nonsmokers\nwho used media 4 or more hours a day outside of work were\nmore likely to be overweight and almost four times more\nlikely to be obese than were nonsmokers using media less\nthan 1 hour daily. Adjustment for potential covariates--\nphysical activity level, energy intake, demographics--did\nnot change the association between media use and over-\nweight and obesity. This large discrepancy in the odds of\nobesity between smokers and nonsmokers who have several\nhours of daily media use points to smoking status as an effect\nmodifier of the association between media use and obesity.\nResearch has shown that people who watch more televi-\nsion tend to consume more calories, have less healthy eating\npatterns, and are heavier than those watching less television\n(28, 29). Individuals may eat more while watching televi-\nsion because of the advertising cues for food and beverage\nproducts, some of which promote unhealthy products (30,\n31). Physical activity is also lower among adults who watch\nmore television (10\u00ad12), perhaps because the hours spent\nwatching television displace time for participating in phys-\nical activity. Our analysis showed that the prevalence of\nregular physical activity was lower for both smokers and\nnonsmokers using media 4 or more hours daily than was\nthe prevalence of physical activity for their counterparts\nusing less than 1 hour of media daily. Although smokers\nin this study were heavier users of media than were non-\nsmokers, the prevalence of obesity was lower among smok-\ners than among nonsmokers. This is consistent with studies\nthat found that smokers watch more television than non-\nsmokers (32) and, in general, that smokers weigh less than\nIn this study, smokers did not have a significantly in-\ncreased odds of obesity, even those smokers who use media\n4 or more hours daily. A lower risk of obesity among smok-\ners does not imply that smoking should be used as a weight\ncontrol practice, as a lower body weight does not counteract\nthe damaging effects of smoking (15). Of course, smoking\nby itself confers many enormous and well-documented\nhealth risks, such as increased risks for stroke, heart disease,\nand lung and other cancers, and a decreased life span (33).\nTABLE 3.

The Nurses' Health Study also found that increased\ntelevision viewing is related to increased risk of obesity,\nindependent of physical activity and other confounders\n(12), and other research of television use and obesity has\nfound that elevated risks of obesity remained after adjust-\nment for activity level (7\u00ad11). High levels of daily media\nuse may have such a strong effect on weight that moderate\nlevels of physical activity may not be enough to mitigate the\neffect of hours of daily sedentary behavior.\nIt seems counterintuitive, nevertheless, that smokers who\nare heavier users of media do not have higher body mass\nindexes than do smokers who are lighter users, and these\nphysiologic and biologic explanations do not fully explain\nthis lack of an expected relation. Television viewers may\nperform other activities while watching television (i.e.,\nviewing is not always a passive activity) (34), but it is\nunknown whether this is different between smokers and\nnonsmokers. In addition, for some people, television is used\nto provide background noise and companionship in a manner\nsimilar to that of radio (34). One possible explanation for\nour study results could be that heavier smokers may use\ntelevision or computers in different ways than do lighter\nsmokers or nonsmokers. Research is needed to confirm or\nrefute this or other hypotheses that can help to explain this\napparent paradox.\nFindings from this analysis suggest that researchers as-\nsessing the association between body mass index and media\nshould test for effect modification of cigarette smoking.\nMerely adjusting for smoking in statistical models masks\nthe smoker/nonsmoker difference in the association between\nmedia use and overweight and obesity. As this research\nindicates, the association is different for smokers and non-\nsmokers. In this study, including both smokers and non-\nsmokers in the same model and adjusting for smoking\nstatus as a covariate resulted in odds ratios for overweight\nthat were attenuated from the results of the model with non-\nsmokers but larger than the results from the model with\nsmokers. However, stratification of the data by smoking\nstatus produced quite different results for smokers and\nnonsmokers.\nThis study has several limitations. First, NHANES is\na cross-sectional study. Thus, the causal relation between\nmedia use and overweight or obesity cannot be determined.\nSecond, the questions to ascertain media use and physical\nactivity have not been formally validated and may not ac-\ncurately identify the respondents' true behavior. If these\nbehaviors were not properly ascertained, this may have re-\nsulted in the lack of attenuation in the models after control-\nling for physical activity and energy intake. Third, the\nquestions do not address whether people were doing other\nactivities, such as eating or doing housework, while they\nwere watching television. Identifying if and what people\neat while watching television or using the computer would\nallow further assessment of dietary behaviors. Fourth, tele-\nvision and computer use are combined in the same question.\nHowever, the activities can be quite different. Because the\nroles of advertisements and usage activities (i.e., sitting vs.\ntyping) are different for watching television and using the\ncomputer, separating television and computer use would\nallow analysis to indicate whether one or both of these ac-\ntivities are associated with overweight and obesity. Fifth,\nenergy intake data from the 24-hour dietary recall may not\nhave captured diet on a ``typical'' day.\nIn conclusion, increased media use is positively associ-\nated with overweight and obesity among nonsmokers but\nmuch less, if at all, among smokers. This association was\nnot diminished by adjustment for physical activity, demo-\ngraphic variables, or energy intake.\n"
