We discuss\nhow the relation between income inequality and these\nphysical and mental health conditions compares with\nthe relation between family income and health.\nMethods\nSources of data\n\"Healthcare for Communities\" is a household tele-\nphone survey clustered in 60 randomly selected\nmetropolitan areas or economic areas of the United\nreinterviewed a stratified random sample of 9585 par-\nticipants of the community tracking study20 and\nachieved a response rate of 64%.

We derived\nweights on the basis of the inverse of the probability of\nselection, non-response, and households without a\ntelephone.

We report results for the overall number of con-\nditions and for the more common individual\nconditions or conditions that may have psychosocial\ncomponents. Weighted percentages are 26.9% for at\nleast one of three pain conditions (migraine or chronic\nsevere headaches, back pain, other unspecified chronic\n(of women) for gynaecological problems; 6.1% for\ndiabetes; 4.3% for angina, heart failure, or coronary\nheart disease; and 3.9% for trouble breathing.\nIncome inequality, individual income, and other\nindependent variables\nWe calculated income inequality at site level from the\ncommunity tracking study. For the sensitivity analysis\nwe also used Kahn et al's state level inequality measures\nMilyo's16 state measures based on the current\npopulation surveys. The results shown are based on the\nacross the 60 communities. This is higher than the\nindicating higher levels of inequality.18\nIncome at the individual level was measured as\nfamily income, which includes earnings from work,\ntransfer income, and other sources. The survey asked\nabout each major component of income separately,\nand respondents were asked to respond with actual\ndollar amounts. Unfolding follow up brackets were\nadopted to reduce item non-response--this method\nallows partial information to be obtained about\nmissing items when respondents are unwilling to pro-\nvide a more detailed answer.27 The tables classify\nrespondents by fifths of income on the basis of the\nnational distribution of income (rather than fifths of\nthe sample), resulting in larger low income groups\nbecause the study oversampled poorer people.\nWe also used age, sex, race or ethnicity, and size\nof family to adjust for confounding factors in the\nstatistical analyses.\nAnalyses\nWe grouped respondents by fifths of family income\nand by community level inequality and calculated a\nweighted mean for the prevalence of each condition in\neach group. We tested the association between\nprevalence of medical conditions and family income or\ninequality by using individual level logistic regressions\nwith an indicator of a health condition as the depend-\nent variable. We tested the association both with and\nwithout adjustment for other individual level socio-\ndemographic variables. P values for tests of associa-\ntions given in the final two columns are based on tests\nusing continuously measured family income or\ninequality. We also allowed for non-linear effects of\ninequality on health outcomes by including dummy\nvariables for each fifth of inequality and with a\nquadratic function of inequality, but the results were\nrobust to the alternative specifications and are not\nreported. We weighted regressions and non-\nparametrically adjusted standard errors by using the\nHuber-White correction as implemented in the cluster\noption in Stata 6.0 to account for the sampling design.\nIn the sensitivity analyses, we substituted income\nadjusted for education or family size for total family\nincome and used state level inequality measures\ninstead of site level inequality. The figures are based on\nregression models with sociodemographic variables\nand dummy variables for each fifth of site income\ninequality.\nResults\nTable 1 confirms the strong social gradient in health by\nincome. Most conditions showed a continuous relation\nbetween prevalence and income across most of the\nincome range. However, the magnitude of the drop in\nthe prevalence of health problems tended to be largest\nfrom the lowest fifth to the next fifth. The final column\nin the table gives P values from two tests of association\nbetween the prevalence of the condition and family\nincome. The first value reports the results when socio-\nTable 1 Health status by fifths of income.

The association between family\nincome and prevalence was highly significant for\nalmost all conditions. The overall picture was identical\nwhen we stratified results by income adjusted for fam-\nily size or educational achievement (less than high\nschool, high school, some college, college degree;\nresults not shown). Table 2 shows the results obtained\nwhen we made adjustments for household composi-\ntion by dividing family income by the square root of\nthe number of household members, where dependants\nhave a weight of 0.5. The results do not differ from\nthose in table 1 .\nTable 3 shows the prevalence of health problems by\nfifth of community level income inequality. Consistent\nwith previous studies, we found a highly significant\n(P < 0.01) association between high income inequality\nand the probability that a person reports being in poor\nor fair health, although the finding was not robust to\nadjustment for other sociodemographic factors.\nExcept for this self reported health measure, however,\nthere was no discernible pattern in health outcomes by\nincome inequality. A third of the conditions were most\nprevalent in communities with average income\ninequality, and three health problems (depression,\nchronic pain, and asthma) were most prevalent in\ncommunities with low income inequality (bottom two\nfifths). With the exception of chronic gynaecological\nproblems, we found no significant association between\nany specific health condition--chronic, mental, or\notherwise--and income inequality (including condi-\ntions not shown). Even the significant result for gynae-\ncological problems disappeared when individual\nsociodemographic variables were taken into account.\nIn contrast, the highest prevalence for every condition\noccurred in one of the two poorest fifths as stratified by\nfamily income.\nFigures 1 and 2 show the same relations (between\nincome inequality and health conditions and between\nfamily income and health conditions) after adjustment\nfor differences in sociodemographic characteristics.\nTable 4 summarises the results from a subset of the\nsensitivity tests that we conducted, all based on\nregression models controlling for other socio-\ndemographic variables. When we substituted income\nadjusted for size of family or level of education for\nfamily income, a strong and highly significant social\ngradient remained. This was also the case for men and\nwomen separately (results not shown). Income\ninequality, on the other hand, had no effect, regardless\nof whether it was measured by the state level Gini coef-\nficient, the coefficient of variation, the share of income\nheld by the top 50% of the income distribution, or the\nratio of the 90th to 10th centiles of the income.

Among more than 200 regression models\non the full sample that used income inequality as the\nprimary explanatory variable and had socio-\ndemographic controls, only one result was significant\nat P < 0.01, but it had the wrong sign (higher state level\ninequality was associated with a reduced prevalence of\narthritis or rheumatism). We paid particular attention\nto potential effects of inequality among people with\nlower incomes (a \"weak\" income inequality hypothesis)\nbecause Kahn et al found significant effects on mental\nhealth status among poor women.17 Our data did not\nreplicate their finding, even when we used their meas-\nure of income inequality.\nDiscussion\nThe relation between income inequality and health has\nbeen at the centre of a substantial amount of research,\nbut the measures of health status that have been\nanalysed to date have largely been limited to self\nreported health status or mortality in the case of physi-\ncal health, and depressive symptoms or psychological\ndistress for mental health. To our knowledge, this study\nis the first to explore the association between income\ninequality and several specific physical conditions as\nwell as particular mental health disorders. Although\nour data confirm the association between income\ninequality and poor or fair self reported health, no\nsimilar relation exists between income inequality and\ndepressive disorders or anxiety disorders or any of the\nmedical conditions assessed, either at the population\nlevel or among people with lower incomes, wealthier\npeople, women, or men. On the other hand, family\nincome and education, which may reflect rank in the\nsocial hierarchy, are strongly related to health. Their\neffects are not confined to differences between the low-\nest income group and other groups (which would\npoint towards material deprivation as an explanation)\nbut show a gradient that flattens well above the median\nincome level. This finding is similar to that of the\nWhitehall studies of British civil servants, where social\ngradients in morbidity and mortality ran from the bot-\nThe sample size of this study provides good statisti-\ncal power to detect differences between fifths of\ninequality up to 75% smaller than the estimated differ-\nences between fifths of family income. Smaller inequal-\nity effects (that is, more than 75% smaller than the\nestimated differences between fifths of income) may\nnot be detectable, however. Measurement error in the\nsite level inequality measure could also bias estimates\ndownward, but the results were unchanged for alterna-\ntive inequality measures at the state level.\nAlthough we found no empirical support for the\nhypothesis that income inequality affects mortality or\nself rated health status through higher rates of specific\nPrevalence (%)\nPoor or fair health\nPain\nDepressive disorder or\nanxiety disorder\nArthritis\nHypertension\nDiabetes\nHeart disease\nGynaecological problem\nLung\ndisease\nLowest income\nFifths of income:\nBelow middle income\nMiddle income\nAbove middle income\nHighest income\nFig 1 Adjusted prevalence of chronic conditions by fifths of family income\nPrevalence (%)\nPoor or fair health\nPain\nDepressive disorder or\nanxiety disorder\nArthritis\nHypertension\nDiabetes\nHeart disease\nGynaecological problem\nLung\ndisease\nLowest inequality\nFifths of income inequality:\nBelow middle inequality\nMiddle inequality\nAbove middle inequality\nHighest inequality\nFig 2 Adjusted prevalence of chronic conditions by fifths of income inequality\nTable 4 Sensitivity tests (P values) for subgroups and other explanatory variables, based on regression model including\nsociodemographic variables\nDependent variable\nEducation\n(4 levels)\nState inequality\n(Gini reported by\nState inequality\n(poorest two fifths\nonly)\nSite inequality\n(poorest two fifths\nonly)\nState inequality\n(poorest two fifths,\nwomen only)\n\"wrong\" sign\nChronic gynaecological problems, such as severe\ncramps or heavy bleeding (women only)\nPapers\nmedical conditions, the results do not necessarily con-\ntradict previously reported associations between\nincome inequality and self rated health status or\nmortality. Factors linking income inequality to health\nmay include the severity of disorder, the probability\nthat a person receives a diagnosis conditional on\nhaving a disorder, and the way in which having a disor-\nder determines people's perceptions of their health.\nBut some of these factors are likely to be influenced by\nenvironmental factors other than income inequality,\nincluding state policies and healthcare infrastructure,\nthat may be unrelated to income distribution. It seems\npremature to conclude that income inequality itself is\nan important risk factor for poor health, and the results\nhighlight the need to better understand the psycho-\nlogical and physiological pathways through which the\nsocial environment affects health.\nWe thank Michael Schoenbaum and J\u00fcrgen Un\u00fctzer for\ncomments, Jennifer Mellor and Jeff Milyo for providing their\nmeasures of income inequality, and Lingqi Tang and Fuan-Yue\nKung for assistance with programming.\nContributors: RS and CRG had the idea for the study,\nperformed the main statistical analysis, and wrote the paper.\nThey are the guarantors.\nFunding: Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which funded\nthe healthcare for communities survey, and the National\nCompeting interests: None declared.\n1 Wilkinson RG.
