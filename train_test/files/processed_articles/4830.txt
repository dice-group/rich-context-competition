    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis 12-month ethnographic study of an early entrant into the U.S. car-sharing\nindustry demonstrates that when an organization shifts its focus from develop-\ning radical new technology to incrementally improving this technology, the shift\nmay spark an internal power struggle between the dominant engineering group\nand a challenger occupational group such as the marketing group. Analyzing 42\nprojects in two time periods that required collaboration between engineering\nand marketing during such a shift, we show how cross-occupational collabora-\ntion under these conditions can be facilitated by a radical flank threat, through\nwhich the bargaining power of moderates is strengthened by the presence of a\nmore-radical group. In the face of a strong threat by radical members of a chal-\nlenger occupational group, moderate members of the dominant engineering\ngroup may change their perceptions of their power to resist challengers'\ndemands and begin to distinguish between the goals of radical versus more-\nmoderate challengers. To maintain as much power as possible and prevent the\nmore-dramatic change in engineering occupational goals demanded by radical\nchallengers, moderate engineers may build a coalition with moderate challen-\ngers and collaborate for incremental technology development.\n",

Kellogg1\n Keywords: cross-occupational collaboration, coordination, adaptation and iner-\ntia in technology-based organizations, radical flank effect, power, conflict, intra-\norganizational power struggles\nMost technology-based organizations must at some point shift their focus from\ndeveloping radical new technology to incrementally improving this technology\nover time, but the literature has not explored the challenges associated with\n1 MIT Sloan School of Management\nthis common transition or elaborated the mechanisms that facilitate it. Most\nresearch on technology development during organizational transitions has\nfocused on how firms develop--or fail to develop--radical new technologies\nGavetti, 2000). It assumes that the shift from a period of radical innovation to a\nperiod of more stable, incremental innovation, which happens in both incum-\nbent firms and new entrants, is relatively straightforward. From a capability per-\nspective, once a new technological trajectory has been identified, a firm's\nmove from radical to incremental innovation should be relatively easy. Yet mod-\nifying an organization's initial innovative technology shifts the balance of power\naway from the engineering group, which may have long been dominant, toward\nchallenger groups, such as the marketing group, that are better able to contrib-\nute to new demands, like satisfying the needs of mainstream customers (e.g.,\nstruggle that is likely to emerge between the dominant and the challenger\noccupational groups in such situations, the challenger group must persuade\nmembers of the dominant group to collaborate to accomplish incremental tech-\nnology development.\nThe literature on cross-occupational collaboration should help us identify the\nmechanisms that facilitate collaboration under this condition, but it does not.\nThough a handful of studies in this literature have focused on how members of\nthe dominant group resist collaborating with a challenger group when an organi-\nzational transition disrupts the occupational hierarchy (Vallas, 2001; Bechky,\n2003a), to our knowledge none has focused on how cross-occupational colla-\nboration can be successfully accomplished under this condition. Understanding\nthe barriers to collaboration, however, should be helpful, and the literature on\nadaptation and inertia provides a good starting point.\nThe literature on adaptation and inertia in technology-based organizations high-\nlights how technology development inside established firms can be compli-\ncated by changing environmental conditions, such as innovations in a firm's\nstudies in this literature focus on organization-level barriers to incumbent firms'\nradical technology development efforts in the face of technological change\n(e.g., Tushman and Anderson, 1986). The studies that do explore the internal\ndynamics associated with technology development when a dominant group\ncomes under threat demonstrate that incumbents frequently have challenger\nengineering groups inside the firm that develop new technologies, but mem-\nbers of the dominant engineering group often block their development (e.g.,\nmary reasons for this: existing cognitive frames favor the dominant group (e.g.,\n2005); existing organizational structures allow dominant group members to\nblock challenger groups (e.g., Leonard-Barton, 1992; Taylor, 2010); and existing\nresource allocation processes support the dominant group (e.g., Christensen\nScholars have highlighted how these barriers can be overcome. Regarding\ncognitive frames, organizations can deliberately promote framing contests\nbetween actors with different cognitive frames and political interests (Kaplan,\n2008), encourage reinterpreting past events and re-envisioning future ones in\ninnovative ways (Kaplan and Orlikowski, 2013), provide education programs to\nshift dominant-group cognitions toward supporting challenger groups' technolo-\ngies (Taylor and Helfat, 2009), and bring in senior managers with new beliefs\nmore aligned with challenger groups' technologies (Kaplan, Murray, and\nHenderson, 2003). Structurally, organizations can separate groups to protect\nchallenger groups' efforts through ambidextrous designs (Tushman and\n1997). And regarding resource allocation processes, organizations can allow\nautonomous decision making in various levels of the organization (Burgelman,\ngroups (Taylor, 2010), and allow challenger groups to form independent compa-\nnies that commercialize new technologies (Christensen, 1997).\nAlthough such mechanisms facilitate technology development when the\ndominant engineering group comes under threat, they have been studied in\nsettings in which organizations are developing radical new technologies rather\nthan seeking to refine and exploit these technologies over time. Some of the\npolitical challenges in the different settings are similar; in both cases, technol-\nogy development requires a shift in the balance of power away from the domi-\nnant engineering group that developed the initial technology and toward a\nchallenger group in the organization. Yet some of the political challenges are\ndifferent. For example, the literature on adaptation details mechanisms that\nfacilitate new technology development by a challenger engineering group when\nthe dominant engineering group is resisting it. Therefore, it delineates mechan-\nisms that protect the efforts of a challenger group from a dominant group\nrather than mechanisms that facilitate collaboration between a dominant and\nchallenger group. In addition, in our setting, members of the dominant and chal-\nlenger groups were from different occupations, and this posed different chal-\nlenges to collaboration for technology development.\nCross-occupational Collaboration inside Organizations\nThe literature on cross-occupational collaboration highlights how members\nfrom different occupations integrate contributions in their daily work across\noccupational differences in expertise, status, and meanings. Studies have\ndemonstrated that it is often difficult for occupational groups to collaborate with\none another across occupational boundaries and that mechanisms such as\ndrawings that serve as boundary objects to aid interpretation across groups\nas boundary spanners between groups (e.g., Fernandez and Gould, 1994;\nin which ideas, information, and coordinating structures can be accessed and\nexchanged by different groups (Kellogg, Orlikowski, and Yates, 2006) can facili-\ntate cross-occupational collaboration by allowing for ongoing give-and-take\nbetween groups. But such collaboration mechanisms are useful only when the\norganization's intra-occupational hierarchy is secure. When organizational transi-\ntions or environmental uncertainty disrupt the hierarchies, members of the\ndominant group may use these same collaboration mechanisms to resist\nthis to protect their occupational jurisdiction, which is their means of continued\nlivelihood (Abbott, 1988): occupational groups gain material rewards by provid-\ning services that competing practitioners cannot (Timmermans, 2008).\nOccupation members draw on three aspects of jurisdictional structure to\nguide their day-to-day interactions inside organizations: occupational knowl-\nedge, understandings of authority relations, and values (Bechky, 2003a). First,\neach occupational group draws on a body of knowledge composed of formal\nabstract principles, and its control over this body of knowledge gives the group\nthe autonomy to determine what work it does and in what order (e.g., Abbott,\n1988). Second, occupational groups are ordered within a hierarchy, the shared\nunderstanding of which allows superordinate groups to direct the work of sub-\nordinate groups (e.g., Heimer and Stevens, 1997). Finally, occupational groups\neach have values that articulate and govern appropriate conduct, which allows\noccupation members both to sanction behavior that violates their moral order\nand to justify to important audiences why their occupational work practices are\nJurisdictional structures are not fixed but are enacted in practice, and domi-\nnant occupational groups must maintain and defend their jurisdictional bound-\naries from competing practitioners in day-to-day work in light of the shifts\ntaking place in the broader organizational environment (e.g., Hwang and\ntheir jurisdictional boundaries in everyday interactions by denying other groups'\nclaims to their occupational knowledge, understandings of authority relations,\nOrlikowski, 2015). When organizations have a stable occupational hierarchy,\nthe dominant group is often willing to make the occasional day-to-day conces-\nsions in occupational knowledge, understandings of authority relations, and val-\nues required for collaboration because its jurisdictional boundaries are not\nOrlikowski, and Yates, 2006). But organizational transitions that increase the\npower of a challenger group in relation to the dominant group can lead the chal-\nlenger group to increase the frequency of claims that infringe on the occupa-\ntional knowledge, understandings of authority relations, and values of the\ndominant group (Vallas, 2001). When a dominant group's jurisdictional bound-\naries are under threat, its members frequently resist applying their occupational\nknowledge in new ways to assist the challenger group, resist abdicating author-\nity to the challenger group, and resist doing work in line with the challenger\ngroup's values that would legitimize its claims to the dominant group's jurisdic-\non radical technological innovation to a focus on more incremental technology\ndevelopment often requires cross-occupational collaboration under these condi-\ntions and is fundamental in the lifecycle of most organizations. To better under-\nstand how this collaboration might take place successfully, we draw on social\nmovement theory and its concept of the ``radical flank effect.''\nThe Radical Flank Effect\nSocial movement theory focuses on how, in the face of a strong threat by radi-\ncal members of a challenger group, members of the dominant group may begin\nto change their attitudes toward challengers' demands, make distinctions\nbetween the goals and tactics of radical versus more-moderate challengers,\nand collaborate with moderate challengers in an effort to maintain as much\npower as possible and to prevent the more-dramatic changes demanded by\nThe Civil Rights movement offers the classic scenario of this radical flank\n1954, the NAACP, with its integrationist philosophy and program of litigation,\nwas viewed by many whites as a radical challenger group. But in the late\nBlack Panthers, who promoted separatist goals and tactics of retaliatory vio-\nlence, changed whites' notions of ``radicalism.'' Initially, many whites resisted\nattempts by both moderate and radical Civil Rights challengers to make\nchange. But the combination of the presence of radicals and highly publicized\nevents, such as the disappearance and murder of three Civil Rights workers on\nAngeles, challenged whites' prevailing definitions of the situation (Cohen and\nstatus quo as inevitable and to make distinctions between the goals and tactics\nof the more-radical versus more-moderate challengers. Many began to support\nand even engage in coalition building with leaders such as Martin Luther King,\nJr. and organizations like the NAACP, believing that these moderate challen-\ngers were less threatening to their own goals than were radical challengers\n(Haines, 1984). Similar radical flank dynamics have been documented in other\nsocial movements, such as the women's liberation movement (Freeman, 1973)\nand the environmental movement (Hoffman, 2009). The radical flank effect can\nalso be a useful concept for understanding how collaboration for incremental\ntechnology development occurs between dominant and challenger occupa-\ntional groups when an organizational transition threatens the power of the\ndominant group.\nMETHODS\nResearch Setting\nWe conducted a 12-month ethnographic study of Transco, an early entrant into\nthe U.S. car-sharing industry. Unlike traditional car-rental firms, car-sharing\nfirms offer short-term vehicle rentals in small time increments, such as one\nhour. Car-sharing firms keep their vehicles in networks of vehicle locations\ncalled ``pods,'' which are placed throughout dense urban areas. Typically, the\nfirms offer a membership plan in which customers pay an annual fee and an\nadditional charge each time they use a vehicle.\nTransco was an ideal setting for our study. It was a technology-based organi-\nzation that had become successful initially because its engineering group devel-\noped innovative car-sharing technologies. But over time, as a dominant design\nfor car sharing emerged, Transco shifted its strategy from developing new\ntechnology to refining its existing technology, with an emphasis on making\nincremental product improvements. This strategic shift moved power away\nfrom the dominant engineering group and toward the challenger marketing\ngroup, as the latter group was better able to contribute to new challenges such\nas satisfying the demands of mainstream customers.\nEthnographic Data Collection\nUsing an inductive, ethnographic approach that is well-suited for developing\norganization to develop a rich understanding of micro-processes involved in our\nfocal phenomenon (Van Maanen, 2011). We focused our data collection efforts\non observing interactions between Transco's engineers and marketers and\ninterviewing engineers, marketers, and members of the leadership team to bet-\nter understand how they conceived of interactions between engineers and\nmarketers.\nData collection at Transco's headquarters began in June 2012 and ended a\nyear later.1 The first author was given a desk, employee badge, company e-mail\naddress, and permission to make contact with anyone at Transco. We\nobserved 111 meetings: 87 daily ``scrum'' meetings and 24 cross-departmental\nmeetings in which engineers and marketers discussed progress and challenges\non joint projects. This enabled us to track 42 projects attempted during the\nstudy's timeframe that were deemed strategic because they were designed to\nincrease revenue by bringing in new customers and retaining (and increasing\nrevenue from) existing ones. Launching these projects depended on integrating\ncontributions of both engineers and marketers. We tracked these projects so\nwe could understand the work practices on launched versus unlaunched proj-\nects. We also observed cross-occupational interactions that occurred at\ncompany-wide ``all hands'' meetings and company-sponsored social events\nsuch as Friday happy hours. In addition, we observed departmental meetings in\nthe engineering and marketing departments.\nTo complement observational data, we conducted 126 formal, semi-\nother Transco employees, including leadership team members. Formal inter-\nviews averaged 60 minutes each and were conducted individually with partici-\npants in private offices or meeting rooms. Initially, we asked interview\nquestions related to everyday work tasks, how the industry and company were\nchanging, and perceptions of and interactions with members of other depart-\nments. As the study progressed, our questions focused more on understanding\nwhy organizational members behaved the way they did during meetings in\nwhich engineers and marketers interacted, as well as their perceptions about\nhow their work in the company was (or was not) changing. We were careful\nnot to lead interviewees. For example, rather than asking engineers to draw\ncontrasts between different marketers, we asked questions like, ``Tell me\nabout a positive experience working across departments,'' and ``Tell me about\na negative experience working across departments.'' In addition, we conducted\n118 informal interviews with engineers and marketers, which were each under\n10 minutes and probed similar areas of inquiry.\n1 We concluded data collection after one year because by this point a stable pattern of cross-\noccupational collaboration between moderate engineers and moderate marketers had been estab-\nlished, and we continued to see no cross-occupational collaboration between any other pairs.\nWe also collected company documents, such as Transco's annual report and\ninternal documents. The annual report was helpful for understanding car-\nsharing industry dynamics, Transco's changing position in the competitive land-\nscape, and Transco's change in strategy. We used internal documents such as\norganization charts, strategic plans, and company-wide e-mails to help us\nunderstand the company's historical versus new strategy.\nData Analysis\nOur longitudinal research design enabled us to use a Time 1 versus Time 2\nanalysis to investigate how a radical flank threat facilitated cross-occupational\ncollaboration for incremental technology development between subgroups of\nengineers and marketers when an organizational transition threatened the\npower of the dominant engineering group. Data analysis occurred in several\nphases.\nCross-occupational collaboration and strategy changes. First we focused\non understanding collaboration between engineers and marketers and changes\nin Transco's strategy. To understand cross-occupational collaboration, we\ncoded our field notes and interviews; to understand changes in the industry\nand Transco's strategy, we coded both our own notes and internal documents,\nfollowing the guidelines suggested by Miles and Huberman (1984). This led us\nto identify two important themes, about which we wrote weekly memos: (1)\norganization members' sense that the balance of power was shifting away\nfrom engineering and toward marketing, and (2) different perceptions among\nsubgroups in the engineering and marketing departments of the new strategy\nand the changes that would be required to accomplish it.\nWe identified and measured several key constructs. First, we measured the\norganizational change that threatened the power of the dominant engineering\ngroup using Emerson's (1962) definition of power, in which the power of actor\nA over actor B is directly related to the dependence of each actor on the other.\nSecond, we measured the strategic shift by using the leadership's statements\nabout the change in strategy in Transco's 2011 Annual Report and data from\nour observations and interviews. Third, our initial interviews at Transco high-\nlighted different subgroups within marketing and engineering that had different\nperceptions of the new strategy. We classified marketers and engineers as\n``radical'' versus ``moderate'' according to several inductively derived indicators\nrelated to their views of the new strategy and of the change in engineering\nknowledge, understandings of authority relations, and values that would be\nrequired to accomplish it.\nStrategic project launches. In the second phase of data analysis, we began\nto analyze the strategic projects that we were observing--42 of them over the\ncourse of the study--that required collaboration between engineers and mar-\nketers. Marketers told us that they saw each of the projects as viable from the\nstart. We measured cross-occupational collaboration by tracking whether proj-\nects were launched or not as opposed to measuring success in the market-\nplace. Launch is a more-proximate measure for collaboration between\nengineers and marketers than marketplace success, which depends on other\nfactors such as market competition. We coded a project as launched if the\nproduct involved was put on the market and made available to customers or if\nthe project involved back-end work that was completed and operational. In\neither scenario, launching required that the project successfully made it through\ninternal review processes, such as the quality assurance (QA) process.\nWe also examined how a subgroup of engineers behaved differently over\ntime. About three months into the study, the subgroup of engineers we call\n``moderate engineers'' began to collaborate with the subgroup of marketers\nwe call ``moderate marketers.'' Early in the study these moderate engineers\nhad resisted collaborating with all marketers. We wanted to understand why\nthis change had occurred; we interviewed engineers asking them to describe\nwhat they perceived to be the key incidents related to engineer\u00admarketer colla-\nboration that had occurred in that time period (Schein, 1985). Engineers consis-\ntently described a particular incident--the announcement of Transco's poor Q2\nresults, and radical marketers' interpretation of these results--as a pivotal\nmoment for the company. But only moderate engineers cited this incident as\nchanging their power to resist radical marketers' demands and as leading them\nto distinguish between the demands of radical versus moderate marketers.\nTime 1 vs. Time 2. In the third phase of the study, we divided our data into\ntwo time periods: Time 1, which spanned the first three months of the study,\nand Time 2, which spanned the nine months of the study after the poor Q2\nresults. This allowed us to analyze the collaboration of engineers and marketers\non the 42 strategic projects synchronically and diachronically (Barley, 1990). For\nthe synchronic analysis, we examined the project launch rates for each type of\nengineer\u00admarketer pairing (moderate engineer\u00admoderate marketer, moderate\nengineer\u00adradical marketer, radical engineer\u00admoderate marketer, and radical\nengineer\u00adradical marketer) in T1 versus in T2. All four pair types had similar\nlaunch rates in T1 (approximately 50 percent), but in T2, the moderate\nengineer\u00admoderate marketer pairs had a 100-percent launch rate, whereas all\nother pairs had a 0-percent launch rate. We wanted to understand why the\nmoderate engineer\u00admoderate marketer pairs started to collaborate in T2, so\nwe diachronically analyzed each type of engineer\u00admarketer pairing to see how\nits members interacted differently in T1 versus T2 projects. In coding moderate\nengineer\u00admoderate marketer projects over time, we came to see distinct dif-\nferences in the interactions between moderate engineers and moderate mar-\nketers in T1 and T2. Table 1 describes the 42 projects, their engineer\u00admarketer\npairings, and whether a project was launched.\nWe explored the following questions: (1) What led the moderate engineers\nto begin to collaborate with the moderate marketers (but not the radical mar-\nketers) in T2? (2) What led the radical engineers not to collaborate with either\nset of marketers in T2? and (3) What practices did the moderate engineers and\nmoderate marketers use to collaborate with one another in T2? To answer the\nfirst and second questions, we found that the concept from social movement\ntheory of a radical flank threat helped us to make sense of our data. We\nobserved the presence of this radical flank threat at Transco and, to measure\nits strength, used two indicators proposed by social movement theorists (e.g.,\nGupta, 2014): (1) the degree to which members of the dominant group per-\nceive that they have the power to resist the demands being made by radical\nTable 1.

We used interview data to assess the\nstrength of the radical flank threat experienced by moderate versus radical\nengineers in the two time periods.\nTo answer the third question, we coded our field notes and found that mod-\nerate engineers and marketers used three coalition-building practices--drawing\non historical Transco organizational knowledge, understandings of authority\nrelations, and values--to guide their collaboration, so we tracked the use or\nnon-use of these practices in engineer\u00admarketer interactions.\nWhen our formal data collection in this phase had finished, we checked our\nemerging conclusions with informants from Transco in informal, offsite meet-\nings to ensure that these interpretations represented their experiences (Yin,\n2008). These checks did not affect the actions of informants during the study.\nFinally, we considered alternative explanations for our findings.\nFINDINGS\nTime 1: Threats to the Dominant Group and Resistance to Collaboration\nTransco was an early entrant into the U.S. car-sharing industry in the early\n2000s with innovative technologies, including a telematics box that alerted the\ncompany to cars' locations and when cars had to be serviced, a keyless car-\nentry system, and a reservations system custom-tailored for the business. The\nneed for innovative technology in the early years meant the engineering group\nTable 1.

In addition, a second set of smaller companies entered\nthe market offering novel products such as peer-to-peer car sharing, which\nallowed individuals to rent out their own cars. According to Transco's 2011\nannual report, with the entrance of these new competitors, the basis of compe-\ntition in the industry shifted from providing sophisticated technological solu-\ntions for car sharing to providing excellent customer service and pricing. These\nchanges led Transco's leadership team to shift Transco's strategic focus away\nfrom new technology development and toward making incremental improve-\nments to its existing technology to retain existing and attract new customers.\nThe leadership team, which remained intact during the time of this study\nexcept for the chief marketing officer, and which was headed by a CEO who\nhad been in place since 2003, announced a four-pronged strategy, for which\nimproving existing technology was central and developing new technology was\nnot: (1) increase customer awareness and adoption rates in existing markets\nthrough marketing efforts; (2) expand into new markets; (3) leverage existing\nnetworks to broaden relationships with customers by introducing new services\nlike insurance waivers purchasable for a single trip and vans for rental; and (4)\ntailor offerings to new categories of customers, such as business and govern-\nment customers (Transco internal strategy document).\nThe strategic shift increased Transco's dependence on the marketing group\nand decreased its dependence on the engineering group, reducing the relative\npower of the engineering group vis-a\n`-vis the marketing group. New projects\nwere increasingly not technology-focused endeavors; for example, the Basic\nPlan, a pared-down membership plan designed to bring on cost-conscious cus-\ntomers, did not require complex technology design, nor did single-trip insur-\nance, an attempt to develop a profitable insurance product. To help implement\nthe new strategy, the leadership team hired a set of experienced marketers.\nWhen we entered the organization, we interviewed Transco members to\nunderstand their views of the company's change in strategy. In both the market-\ning and engineering groups, we observed two subgroups, which held different\nviews of the new strategy. As Gouldner's (1957) work on ``cosmopolitans and\nlocals'' would predict, occupation members differed in their level of commitment\nto the occupation versus to the organization. We found that each subgroup's\nview of the new strategy was shaped by how strongly its members were com-\nmitted to their occupation and, therefore, how much they wanted to protect their\nown occupational knowledge, understandings of authority relations, and values in\nthe face of new strategic demands. Tables 2 and 3 present the key perceptions,\ngoals, and backgrounds of the marketers and engineers we interviewed.\nDistinguishing radical from moderate marketers. The first marketing sub-\ngroup was composed predominantly of newly hired marketers but included\nTable 2.

All had formal training in marketing, and the primary factor\nthat distinguished them from the other subgroup of marketers was their strong\ncommitment to marketing occupational knowledge, understandings of authority\nrelations, and values.\nThis subgroup of marketers was highly supportive of Transco's new strate-\ngic direction, for it was highly consistent with their occupational goals. The new\nstrategy allowed these marketers to use specialized marketing knowledge\n(e.g., by analyzing spreadsheets with expected revenues by product), to act\naccording to understandings of authority relations that both privileged market-\ners over engineers and allowed marketers to rise within the broader marketing\noccupational career hierarchy (e.g., gain experience needed to secure market-\ning leadership roles in other firms), and to do work that was in line with market-\ning occupational values (e.g., bringing in new customers and retaining existing\nones at a higher rate to grow market share). To accomplish Transco's new\nstrategy, these marketers believed that dramatic change was required in the\nengineering group's knowledge, understandings of authority relations, and val-\nues. For this reason, we call this subgroup ``radical marketers.'' In T1, however,\nthough radical marketers told us about their desire for change, they did not\nexplicitly communicate these thoughts to the leadership team or the engineers.\nThe second marketing subgroup was primarily composed of marketers who\nhad long worked at Transco. A few had formal marketing training like that of\nradical marketers, but those who did reported that they had joined Transco\nbecause of their interest in its focus on sustainability, not because of their inter-\nest in marketing. The primary factor that distinguished them from the radical\nmarketers was their weaker commitment to marketing occupational knowl-\nedge, understandings of authority relations, and values and their stronger com-\nmitment to Transco's historical organizational knowledge, understandings of\nauthority relations, and values.\nThis subgroup was supportive of Transco's new strategy but less supportive\nthan the first subgroup, because of their less occupationally oriented goals. For\nexample, unlike radical marketers, these marketers enjoyed engaging in both mar-\nketing activities and in organizational activities related to Transco's history that did\nnot require the use of marketing knowledge, such as doing work for Transco's sus-\ntainability club. They wanted to draw on understandings of authority relations that\nallowed them to work in partnership with engineers and to advance within the\norganizational hierarchy at Transco rather than within the broader marketing occu-\npational hierarchy. And they drew on Transco's historical organizational values to\nguide their work in addition to drawing on the values of the marketing occupation;\nas one said, ``We're not just selling soap or ads . . . what we do helps limit the\nenvironmental impact of cars [and] makes customers' lives easier.'' These market-\ners believed that, to accomplish Transco's new strategy, only moderate change in\nengineers' occupational knowledge, understandings of authority relations, and val-\nues was required. Thus we call this subgroup ``moderate marketers.''\nDistinguishing radical from moderate engineers. The first engineering\nsubgroup was composed of primarily mid- and senior-level engineers who had\nbeen with Transco for many years. Most had in-depth knowledge of Transco's\nproprietary back-end technology, and several had been responsible for building\nkey pieces of Transco's technology systems. All reported that they had come\nto Transco because of the opportunity to build innovative technology. The pri-\nmary factor that distinguished them from the other subgroup of engineers was\ntheir strong commitment to engineering occupational knowledge, understand-\nings of authority relations, and values. We call this subgroup ``radical engi-\nneers'' because they were strongly opposed to Transco's new strategic\ndirection, which was highly inconsistent with their occupational goals. The new\nstrategy required them to make concessions in their engineering knowledge\n(e.g., working on projects that did not allow them to use their technical and\ncreative engineering skills), understandings of authority relations (e.g., engi-\nneers told us that a growing number of marketing initiatives were ``thrown at\nthe [engineering] department'' after the IPO), and values (e.g., they objected to\nthe new marketing projects, which were not designed to make progress on\n``really tough engineering issues'' that they deemed to be important).\nRadical engineers asserted that Transco should focus on developing novel\ntechnology ``to promote social good,'' such as enabling rentals for one-way\ntrips. They wanted to upgrade Transco's aging technology systems, which they\nreported were ``basically about to crumble.'' With 38 engineers, the depart-\nment was small enough that even the most senior radical engineers were now\nbeing asked to work on the most routine projects. One radical engineer noted\nthat although one might think that these seemingly simple tasks could be per-\nformed by junior engineers or even new hires, because Transco's technology\nwas proprietary, ``basic changes could take us [senior people highly familiar\nwith the technology] a very long time.''\nThe second engineering subgroup was composed primarily of less tenured\nand more-junior engineers. Most had joined Transco after the initial technology\nwas developed and when the firm was no longer widely viewed as a destina-\ntion to do cutting-edge engineering work. Some engineers who had joined\nwhile the initial technology was in early development had in-depth knowledge\nof Transco's proprietary technology systems, but they reported that they had\ncome to Transco because they were attracted to its mission to make sustain-\nable urban living easier. The primary factor that distinguished them from the\nradical engineers was their weaker commitment to engineering occupational\nknowledge, understandings of authority relations, and values. We call this sub-\ngroup ``moderate engineers''; they were less strongly opposed to Transco's\nnew strategic direction because of their less occupationally oriented goals.\nThey enjoyed using historical Transco organizational knowledge in addition to\noccupational knowledge, such as by engaging in non-core engineering activities\nlike ``developing other engineers.'' They worked in ways necessary to advance\nwithin the organizational hierarchy at Transco rather than within the broader\nengineering occupational hierarchy (e.g., ``I'm happy staying at Transco''). And\nthey were not as concerned as were radical engineers about doing work that\nviolated engineering values; as one engineer noted, ``I'm fine doing some work\nthat is more routine, that's not really cutting edge.''\nInitial resistance from both radical and moderate engineers. Launching\nthe strategic marketing projects required that engineers and marketers collabo-\nrate because the projects required both marketers' ability to design new prod-\nucts and services using their knowledge of customers and engineers' ability to\nmake changes to Transco's back- or front-end technology systems.2 Although\nradical marketers did not openly express to engineers their goals for dramatic\nchange at Transco in T1, they did use somewhat more assertive tactics to elicit\nengineers' collaboration than did moderate marketers. Despite this difference,\nin T1 both radical and moderate engineers resisted collaborating with either rad-\nical or moderate marketers because marketing projects posed a threat to engi-\nneers' knowledge, understandings of authority relations, and values.\nThreat to engineers' knowledge. Both radical and moderate engineers\nnoted in T1 that they did not want to do ``uninteresting'' work that did not allow\nthem to use their core engineering skills. For example, a moderate marketer\nwho was excited to have secured a partnership with a major airline asked the\nmoderate engineer on that project to perform back-end work needed to launch\nthe project, in which the airline's customers would be offered Transco promo-\ntions. The moderate engineer complained that the ``tedious'' work, which was\n``repetitive and boring,'' was ``not worth it.'' The moderate engineer wanted to\nwork on projects that required using occupational knowledge like ``using new\nprogramming languages'' to ``make sustainable urban living easier,'' not make\nminor changes to Transco's ``over a decade-old'' back-end systems using an\nincreasingly ``archaic'' programming language. The moderate marketer lost\nmomentum with the airline, and the project never launched.\nThreat to engineers' understandings of authority relations. In T1, engineers\nresisted projects that challenged their ability to be in charge. For example, in the\nUK employees pre-tax program project, we saw a moderate engineer resist a\nmoderate marketer's request to help enable a program whereby employees at\nUK companies could exchange a portion of their pre-tax salary for blocks of\nTransco time, in addition to saving up to 40 percent on usage. The UK was an\nimportant market for Transco and one in which such programs were widespread.\nBut enabling this program involved back-end integration work between Transco's\nsystem and that of a UK car-sharing firm that Transco had acquired. The moder-\nate engineer told this moderate marketer that the billing systems of the UK firm\nwere still being finalized so the program would not be possible. Later, this engi-\nneer told us that it was possible, but ``I don't like being told what to do.''\nThreat to engineers' values. Engineers in T1 resisted marketers' requests\nthat infringed on their values, such as the importance of pushing the bound-\naries of what was technologically possible on projects. For example, in the\nnational retailer partnership project, a moderate marketer asked two moderate\nengineers to help enable Transco to sign up new customers at kiosks inside a\nretailer's stores. The retailer had national reach and a potentially overlapping\ncustomer base, so the moderate marketer was excited about the partnership.\nBut the project never launched because the moderate engineers refused to\nperform the back-end work needed to get the kiosks connected with Transco's\n2 It was somewhat unusual for Transco's engineers to work directly with Transco's marketers. In\nmany companies, project or product managers serve as a liaison between these two occupational\ngroups. Transco did have product managers, and part of their role was to serve as project managers\nfor engineering scrum teams, so they were often in meetings with engineers and marketers. But\nthey were ineffective at controlling engineers because they had no formal authority over them.\nAlso, many product managers saw serving as project managers as an undesirable task; they pre-\nferred to ``be thinking big about what's next for Transco'' rather than trying to influence engineers.\nregistration system. One of the moderate engineers told the moderate mar-\nketer, ``We shouldn't be wasting time on these small-time partnerships . . . we\nshould be doing things that are actually going to make people's lives better.\nWhat about the next-generation system?''\nEngineers' resistance prevented the launch of many strategic marketing\nprojects in T1. Projects were always staffed with one marketer and were pri-\nmarily staffed with one engineer; in the 10 of 42 projects across T1 and T2 that\nwere staffed with more than one engineer, there was a lead engineer responsi-\nble for the bulk of the work, and we coded the project as being led by that type\nof engineer. During the first three months of our study (T1), engineers and mar-\nketers worked on 20 marketing projects, and 50 percent of them were\nlaunched.\nWhy were engineers able to behave in this manner without formal punish-\nment? First, marketers did not know what was and was not possible to do\nfrom a technical standpoint, and engineers often used this to their advantage\nwhen they did not want to perform a piece of work. Second, the radical engi-\nneers had crucial expertise on the firm's proprietary technology systems, so\nthey were not substitutable; Transco could not hire new engineers who had\nthis expertise. Third, although the leadership team had become increasingly\ninterested in tracking progress on internal projects, given financial pressures,\nthey still spent the bulk of their time managing external stakeholders such as\ninvestors and board members. Thus the leadership team had limited insight\ninto what engineers were and were not doing. Finally, marketers told us that\neven though, theoretically, they were able to ``call out'' engineers and report\nengineers' resistance to the leadership team, they were reluctant to do so\nbecause they thought that it reflected poorly on them.\nTime 2: Radical Flank Threat and Divergence at Transco\nAlthough radical and moderate engineers acted similarly in T1, after the first\nthree months of our study, their actions diverged, as did the collaboration out-\ncomes for moderate engineer\u00admoderate marketer pairs versus other pairs. In\nT1, before the introduction of the radical flank threat that we describe below,\nproject launch rates had been similar for moderate engineers working with\nmoderate marketers versus all other pairs: four of the seven T1 projects\nattempted by moderate engineer\u00admoderate marketer pairs launched, and six of\nthe 13 T1 projects with all other pairs launched. But in T2, after the introduction\nof the radical flank threat, the project launch rates for moderate engineers\nworking with moderate marketers increased dramatically, while the project\nlaunch rates for other pairings decreased. In T2, moderate engineers working\nwith moderate marketers launched all of their seven projects. All other pairings\nlaunched none of their 15 projects in T2.3\nThis difference in launch rates cannot be explained by a difference in the\nkinds of projects led by moderate versus radical engineers; these projects were\nvery similar along criteria that could have affected engineering collaboration,\n3 In T2, most projects were either moderate engineer\u00admoderate marketer or radical engineer\u00ad\nradical marketer, because moderate engineers were by this time collaborating with moderate mar-\nketers. Therefore, the more experienced moderate engineers who were likely to lead projects were\nengaged in work and unavailable, making radical engineers often the only option to work on many\nradical marketers' projects.\nsuch as a project's importance, complexity, alignment with the new strategy,\nand interest level for the engineers, as shown in the comparisons in table 4.\nThe difference also cannot be explained by staffing differences. Staffing deci-\nsions about which marketer and engineer worked on each project were deter-\nmined by the heads of the marketing and engineering departments,\nrespectively, and were a function of an individual's availability and area of\nexpertise; for example, some engineers were particularly knowledgeable about\nthe reservations system and were thus assigned to projects related to reserva-\ntions changes. As a result, neither marketers nor engineers got to choose with\nwhom they worked. To account for the difference in project launch rates for\nmoderate engineer\u00admoderate marketer pairs versus other pairs in T2, we need\nto understand the difference in the degree of the radical flank threat posed to\nthe different subgroups of engineers in T2.\nRadical marketers demand dramatic change. Roughly three months into\nour data collection, Q2 earnings fell short of projections, and Transco cut its\nprojections for the remainder of the year. Media coverage was negative and\nwidespread (e.g., ``Transco runs off the road''), blaming Transco's performance\non its inability to add new customers and retain existing customers. According\nto social movement theorists, critical events like this do not automatically\nexpand political opportunities for challengers, like the marketers; instead,\nTable 4.

Medium-importance projects were intended to increase revenue more\nindirectly (e.g., strategic partnerships). Low-importance projects were more minor promotions or programs.\nAlignment with new strategy refers to the extent to which the project was explicitly designed to fulfill the four\ngoals of the new strategic direction. Projects coded as highly aligned with the new strategy were designed to\naccomplish at least one of the four goals. Projects coded as medium on alignment were not explicitly designed to\naccomplish one of the four goals but supported their accomplishment. Complexity of the technical work refers to\nhow complicated the engineering portion of the project was. High complexity required engineers to make major\nadditions or changes to the back-end systems and generally represented at least a month of work. Medium-\ncomplexity projects involved less extensive back-end work but often still required several weeks. Low-complexity\nwork happened when engineers had only minimal modifications to make that could be completed in a week or two.\nProjects coded as interesting for the engineers required either use of newer programming languages or creativity.\nevents must be actively interpreted in order to mobilize people (McAdam,\nthe CEO to give them a public mandate for more dramatic change at Transco\nand to signal to the engineers that the radical marketers sought to constrain\nthe use of engineering knowledge, understandings of authority relations, and\nvalues. These actions made radical marketers a much more visible source of\nradical change than they had been in T1.\nRadical marketers used the opportunity to try to advance marketing occupa-\ntional knowledge, understandings of authority relations, and values at Transco.\nFor example, they persuaded the CEO that dramatic changes in engineering\noccupational goals were necessary by arguing that (1) Transco's failure to\nlaunch new marketing projects was preventing them from achieving their reve-\nnue projections, (2) engineers were to blame for this failure, and (3) the CEO\nneeded to tell the engineers and the rest of the company that launching new\nmarketing projects was the top priority for Transco members. The radical mar-\nketers' actions led the CEO to announce new marketing initiatives on\nTransco's earnings call with analysts, investors, and the media. In response to\nradical marketers' requests, the CEO fired the longtime chief marketing officer\nand asked three radical marketers to report directly to him, held a meeting with\nengineers in which he stressed the importance of supporting new marketing\nprojects, and on a company-wide webcast stressed the importance of focusing\non ``marketing and strategy.'' He allowed a radical marketer seated beside him\nduring the webcast to announce several upcoming marketing projects that the\nradical marketers had discussed with the CEO. The radical marketers' visible\nrole in these events highlighted for engineers the extent to which radical mar-\nketers sought revolutionary change at Transco. One moderate engineer noted,\n``Someone like [one radical marketer] really wants to change this place.''\nThe radical marketers also began to use aggressive tactics that signaled to\nthe engineers that they sought to constrain engineers' knowledge, understand-\nings of authority relations, and values. Social movement scholars note that not\nonly the goals that challengers put forth but also the tactics they use shape the\ndegree of perceived threat posed by a challenger group, and both goals and tac-\ntics are powerful determinants of the dominant group's response to challenger\nketers had sometimes behaved as if engineers' work should be directed toward\nhelping them get marketing ``things out the door,'' they had not explicitly told the\nengineers that they thought Transco members' use of engineering knowledge,\nunderstandings of authority relations, and values needed to be constrained. In T2,\nthey began to use the Q2 results as a rationale for telling the engineers this.\nConstraining the use of engineering knowledge. A few weeks after the\nrelease of the Q2 results, a radical marketer called a special meeting with the\nengineers, who were hoping to start work on new technology development\nprojects they wanted to pursue, such as designing the next-generation back-\nend system. In the meeting, the marketer tried to preempt the engineers'\nobjections to collaborating by saying that, because of the poor Q2 results, the\n``leadership team fully supports'' projects like the Basic Plan--designed to bring\nin new customers--and ``has said that these projects are the top priority'' for\nengineers in the coming months. ``The fun stuff,'' the marketer said, referring\nto advanced engineering work, ``has to wait.''\nConstraining engineers' understandings of authority relations. Until T2,\nTransco engineers did not have to answer to marketers. But at a meeting in T2,\nin front of half a dozen engineers, a radical marketer said that ``given where we\nare today,'' she wanted to implement a process that had ``worked out really\nwell'' at the retail company where she worked before coming to Transco.\n``Every quarter we [marketers] would meet with the tech group and share the\nlist of projects we wanted done over the next few months,'' she said. She sug-\ngested that Transco ``needs something like this'' to ``ensure that critical work\ngets completed'' and said that she would bring it up at the next marketing\nmeeting. The comments made an obvious impression on engineers. After the\nmeeting, engineers expressed their outrage to each other: ``We're not sup-\nposed to work for them!'' one said.\nConstraining engineers' occupational values. One core engineering value\nwas doing technologically sophisticated work to promote social good, and engi-\nneers often expressed concern about anything they saw as ``exploiting the cus-\ntomer community.'' In T2, radical marketers began to openly challenge this\ncore value. At a meeting shortly after the announcement of the Q2 results, a\nradical marketer told the engineers that the customer agreement contract was\ngoing to change, and she tried to head off engineers' resistance by saying that\nthey needed to do this because ``we're in a different situation now.'' An engi-\nneer commented that this would seem ``sketchy'' to customers. Ignoring the\nengineer's objection, the radical marketer went on to say, ``And since we're\nchanging it anyway, is there anything else we want to try to get in the new\nagreement?'' Afterward, an engineer told us that the engineers saw this as\n``sneaky,'' ``greedy,'' and ``untrustworthy.''\nRadical marketers realized that they were openly challenging the engineers\nin T2. One radical marketer told us, ``I was hired because of my strategic skills\nand because of the need for serious change inside this company. I'm here to\nget the job done, not to make people like me.'' Another said,\nThe reality is that not everyone in the company has insights into the economics of\nthis business. They see no reason to change. . . . I don't want to freak everyone out,\nbut part of my job is to help people see that we need to change in significant ways.\nDoes that mean we should screw over customers to make a quick buck, as some\nfear? No. But it does mean that some of the dot-org roots of this place, some of the\nvalues that make people averse to making money, need to change.\nThe radical marketers were not alone in trying to use the critical event to\nadvance their goals: radical engineers frequently talked with one another and to\nus about how the poor Q2 results were evidence that the new strategy was\nflawed. They made comments like, ``it should be an increased focus on engineer-\ning not marketing.'' Several radical engineers openly commented on this to mem-\nbers of the senior team, including the CEO. In response, however, the CEO\ncontinued to emphasize the importance of supporting new marketing projects.\nModerate marketers use radical flank tactics. As radical marketers\nbecame more visible by making explicit demands for dramatic change, we\nobserved moderate marketers use what we call ``radical flank tactics'' to visibly\nsignal to engineers that they were less committed to dramatic change than\nwere radical marketers and to distance themselves from radical marketing\ngoals. For example, we observed two radical marketers and two moderate mar-\nketers talk as engineers came into the room for a meeting. The conversation\nshifted to A/B testing, a means of finding out which version of a website works\nbest, and the two radical marketers discussed techniques they had learned dur-\ning a marketing class while completing their MBAs. They talked about ``bounce\nrates'' and ``heat maps'' to summarize ``click-through rates.'' As the radical mar-\nketers displayed their marketing knowledge, the two moderate marketers said\nnothing. This was surprising to us as one of the moderate marketers had an\nMBA also. She later pointed out to us that her silence had been strategic:\n``Marketing jargon doesn't go over well with engineers.''\nModerate marketers also signaled to engineers in T2 that they did not share\nradical marketers' views of authority relations, including that marketers should\nalways ``take the lead.'' One of the ways that radical marketers conveyed to\nengineers that marketers should take the lead was by highlighting their close-\nness to Transco's leadership team. Radical marketers referred to this team as\n``the LT'' and made frequent, uncritical references to the group. In contrast, we\nobserved moderate marketers distance themselves from radical marketers by\nusing the term ``the leadership team,'' as the engineers did, and by being criti-\ncal of this team. For example, we saw a radical engineer in a meeting refer to a\nproduct in front of moderate engineers and moderate marketers as ``stupid,''\nbecause engineers had given one name to the product and the CEO had chan-\nged it to a different name that engineers argued ``makes no sense.'' A moder-\nate marketer responded, ``Agreed. But when you're the CEO, you can do\nwhatever you want,'' highlighting his agreement with engineers' view of the\nleadership team and his distance from the CEO.\nModerate marketers distanced themselves from marketing occupational val-\nues in T2 as well. At the time of our study, it was popular for companies to\nmarket their brands on social media platforms such as Facebook. Radical mar-\nketers were very enthusiastic about ``leveraging'' Transco's Facebook page to\n``increase revenue.'' One of the T1 projects was to enable customers to make\nreservations for Transco cars on its Facebook page. The engineers were irri-\ntated by this project from the start, in part because they saw it as one of the\nmarketers' attempts to follow ``whatever is trendy'' even if ``it makes no\nsense.'' Engineers believed making reservations on Facebook made no sense\nbecause people would want to keep their reservations private and could do this\nby using the website or mobile applications. At the end of a meeting attended\nby several moderate marketers and moderate engineers, a moderate marketer\ndistanced himself from the value of using technology to meet current trends\nrather than to deliver a useful service by sarcastically remarking, ``I'm going to\ngo make a reservation on Twitter.'' Everyone laughed.\nAnother time, we saw a moderate marketer joke about a radical marketer's\nefforts to change the terms of the customer agreement contract. Moderate\nengineers called this ``sneaky'' because ``it's not like you ever read those\ne-mails you get about changing service terms.'' At a daily scrum meeting, when\na moderate engineer remarked about the frustrations customers experienced\nwhen they received late fees, a moderate marketer joked, ``Let's just change\nthe service contract!'' Everyone in the meeting laughed.\nIn T2, moderate marketers also signaled to the engineers that they were\nless committed than radical marketers to constraining engineers' occupational\ngoals. For example, after the T2 meeting described above in which radical mar-\nketers told the engineers that ``The fun stuff has to wait,'' we observed a mod-\nerate marketer schedule a time with three engineers to discuss ``options for\nthe next-generation system,'' even though the radical marketers had just told\nthe engineers that they would not be working on this system in the near term.\nIn taking this action, the moderate marketer signaled the belief that Transco still\nneeded engineers' occupational knowledge, such as the cutting-edge skills\nrequired to build the next-generation system. Another moderate marketer dif-\nferentiated herself from the radical marketers in T2 by explaining to us in front\nof several engineers that it was important for engineers to have time to work\non ``. . . projects like when [an engineer] made the iPhone app in his spare time.\nThat ended up being big for the company.''\nModerate marketers also signaled to engineers that they were less commit-\nted to constraining engineers' understandings of authority relations than were\nradical marketers. Engineers frequently complained about radical marketers\ncoming ``right up to my desk'' and asking for last-minute work requests. As a\nmeeting was about to begin, a moderate engineer complained to a group of\nmoderate marketers and other engineers about one of the ``problem children''\n[a radical marketer] who had just committed this offense. ``It's not like I work\nfor him,'' the moderate engineer said. ``Yeah, that shouldn't be happening,''\none of the moderate marketers said, signaling respect for the engineers' under-\nstandings of authority relations.\nFinally, moderate marketers also signaled to engineers that they were less\ncommitted to constraining their occupational values than were the radical mar-\nketers. Several moderate marketers did this by making frequent public state-\nments in T2 about their respect for technology companies doing breakthrough\ntechnical work and promoting social good. One moderate marketer, in the com-\npany of engineers, talked about a recent conference he had attended. Unlike a\nradical marketer we observed talking to engineers about a conference she had\nattended that focused on ways for tech companies to increase sales, this mod-\nerate marketer reinforced engineering values. He told the engineers that there\nwere some ``really cool companies'' at the conference using cutting-edge tech-\nnology to solve problems, from connecting local craftspeople to customers\naround the world to helping make progress on global issues like climate change.\nIn highlighting both the technological basis of these companies' work and their\nfocus on social good--as opposed to profits--this moderate marketer signaled\nto engineers that he respected their values, unlike the radical marketers.\nModerate engineers' perceptions of a strong threat. We analyzed the per-\nceptions of radical and moderate engineers over time by comparing engineers'\nperceptions in our T1 interviews to their perceptions in our T2 interviews. This\nrevealed that radical marketers' actions in T2 posed a threat to all engineers,\nbut the moderate engineers experienced a stronger radical flank threat than did\nthe radical engineers. First, in T2, but not in T1, the moderate engineers per-\nceived a strong threat because they began to believe that they did not have the\npower to resist the demands being made by the radical marketers. In T1, 12 of\n26 moderate engineers had reported this perception, but in T2, 23 of 26 moder-\nate engineers did. The mandate for more-dramatic change at Transco\ndecreased Transco's dependence on goals enabled by engineers, like\ndeveloping new technology. And the company no longer depended heavily on\nmost of the moderate engineers; it was able to hire engineers with skills similar\nto those of most of the moderate engineers somewhat easily because, unlike\nthe radical engineers, most of the moderate engineers had not played central\nroles in building Transco's proprietary technology systems. The moderate engi-\nneers who did play a role in developing or had in-depth knowledge of Transco's\nproprietary technology systems also came under threat because, unlike radical\nengineers who wanted to work at a technology company and were prepared to\nseek opportunities elsewhere if Transco's new direction prevented them from\ndoing so, these moderate engineers wanted to remain at Transco to work on\nproducts that made sustainable urban living easier.\nIn addition, although moderate engineers could get jobs in other organiza-\ntions, as the labor market for engineers was good at the time, they reported in\nT2 that these options were not as appealing to them as working at Transco.\nOne noted, ``Transco is a pretty great place to work in lots of ways . . . we have\na compelling purpose that's bigger than business . . . I'm not looking to leave\nanytime soon.'' Thus moderate engineers began to express the belief that they\ncould not resist the demands being made by the radical marketers. One moder-\nate engineer said, ``There are some guys here who basically just refuse to work\nwith marketers . . . I don't really feel like that's an option for me. I want to keep\nmy job [laughs].''\nSecond, in T2, most of the moderate engineers perceived that the moderate\nmarketers' commitment to dramatic change via advancing marketing occupa-\ntional goals and constraining engineering goals was meaningfully different from\nthat of the radical marketers. In T1, none of the 26 moderate engineers had\nreported this perception, but in T2, 21 of 26 did. Though moderate engineers did\nnot label marketers as radical versus moderate, they began to draw contrasts\nbetween types of marketers according to the degree to which the marketers\nseemed to be trying to advance marketing goals and constrain engineering goals.\nFor example, a moderate engineer noted that moderate marketers did not seek\nto constrain the use of engineering knowledge as much as the radical marketers\ndid: ``I far prefer [two moderate marketers], for example, over say [two radical\nmarketers] because . . . you don't need to do boring work unless it is really neces-\nsary.'' Another moderate engineer noted that moderate marketers did not want\nto constrain engineers' understandings of authority relations as much as radical\nmarketers did: ``With marketers like [two moderate marketers] . . . they don't just\nwant you to be a pair of hands.'' Finally, a moderate engineer explained that mod-\nerate marketers did not try to constrain engineers' values as much as radical mar-\nketers would: ``I think some marketers like [one moderate marketer] get why\ncontinuing to develop technology matters . . . others are just really short-term\nfocused.'' One moderate engineer summed it up this way: ``[One moderate mar-\nketer] is the lesser of two evils. She's not even that bad.''\nRadical engineers' perceptions of a weak threat. Radical engineers per-\nceived that the radical flank threat was weak, because all 12 of them continued\nto believe that they had the power to resist the demands being made by the\nradical marketers. Though the mandate for more-dramatic change at Transco\ndecreased its dependence on goals enabled by engineers, Transco continued\nto depend on the radical engineers, most of whom had in-depth expertise\nrelated to Transco's back-end technology systems, so their ability to provide\nvalued resources to the organization did not change. The radical engineers con-\ntinued to perceive that they were not substitutable, saying things like ``It's not\nlike Transco can hire someone off the street who knows how to run our sys-\ntems.'' Two of the twelve radical engineers did not have in-depth experience\nwith the technology, but they had come to Transco because of the opportunity\nto build innovative technology and were prepared to seek opportunities else-\nwhere ``if Transco became a marketing company.''\nIn addition, the radical engineers continued to believe that their top-tier tech-\nnical training and many years of experience at Transco developing complex\ntechnology afforded them attractive opportunities for horizontal job mobility.\nSeveral radical engineers reported in T2 that they had received invitations to\ninterview at technical organizations such as Amazon and Google where they\ncould further develop and use their engineering skills while also engaging in\nwork valued by their occupational community.\nThe radical engineers also perceived a weak radical flank threat because\nthey all believed that the moderate marketers' commitment to advancing\nmarketing occupational goals and constraining engineering occupational\ngoals was not meaningfully different from that of the radical marketers. In\nboth T1 and T2, the radical engineers declared that marketers were, as one\nsaid, ``basically all the same . . . [their] focus is all on revenue.'' One radical\nengineer referred in T2 to how all marketers tried to take charge of projects\n``like they're the boss.'' Rather than suggesting that it was a good strategy to\ncooperate with some marketers, radical engineers continued to say that it\nmade most sense to resist collaboration. One radical engineer said, ``It's best\nto just ignore them.''\nTime 2: Moderate Engineers and Moderate Marketers Collaborate\nIn T2, in response to experiencing a strong radical flank threat, moderate engi-\nneers began to build a coalition and collaborate with moderate but not radical mar-\nketers. Social movement theorists argue that material shifts in the environment,\nsuch as the exogenous shock of Transco's Q2 results, do not trigger collective\naction until they are interpreted as threats. Then those sensing a threat must use\nsome kind of organizing framework (such as shared knowledge, understandings\nof authority relations, and values) to collectively act on their interpretation\n(McAdam, 1999: xvii). Once moderate engineers interpreted a strong threat, they\nand the moderate marketers began to use their shared organizing framework of\nhistorical organizational knowledge, understandings of authority relations, and val-\nues to build a coalition and collaborate with one another.\nDrawing on historical organizational knowledge. In T1, moderate engi-\nneers had resisted collaborating with moderate marketers, in part because col-\nlaboration threatened moderate engineers' jurisdictional claim to a body of\nengineering knowledge; moderate engineers had reported that they did not\nwant to do ``uninteresting'' work that did not allow them to use their core skills.\nAfter the introduction of the strong radical flank threat in T2, moderate engi-\nneers began to collaborate with moderate marketers by drawing on historical\nTransco organizational knowledge, as opposed to only engineering occupational\nknowledge. In T2, we observed moderate marketers begin to highlight that\nthey were similar to the engineers in their use of two kinds of historical\nTransco organizational knowledge: knowledge of how to ``get things done'' and\nknowledge of how to be a ``jack of all trades.''4\n``Getting things done'' involved going above and beyond what was expected\nto get important organizational work done. One moderate marketer told us,\n``When I first joined Transco, mine was a kitchen sink job . . . it was not well-\ndefined, just do whatever it takes.'' Similarly, a moderate engineer reflected\nback on a time ``before we had all these processes'' and how ``our job was\nbasically to make sure this complex network of vehicles was always\noperational--even if it meant doing something beyond your area of expertise,\nlike digging out cars when a blizzard hit, which actually happened.'' Moderates\nused their shared organizational knowledge of getting things done to collabo-\nrate in T2. For example, a moderate marketer asked a moderate engineer for\nhelp launching the credit card updater project to help Transco recover an esti-\nmated $1 million per year in lost revenue when customers failed to update\ncredit cards that were about to expire. The project did not involve applying com-\nplex engineering skills or working on new technology development. Instead, it\ninvolved more routine engineering work--making changes to the existing tech-\nnology to make it easier for customers to update their credit card information\nby, for example, having Transco send them automated reminder e-mails.\nThe moderate marketer in this project emphasized that ``we need to get this\ndone.'' The moderate engineer agreed to help, despite the fact that the engi-\nneer described the work as ``not sexy.'' Because Transco had to obtain data\nfrom a third-party vendor for the process to run smoothly, the moderate engi-\nneer had to implement an enterprise service bus (ESB) that could facilitate\ncommunication between the two systems, and this was ``a big pain,'' accord-\ning to the engineer. Yet he collaborated with the moderate marketer and\nexplained his reasoning this way: ``This was not exciting work but I want to be\nsomeone who gets stuff done instead of always offering excuses.'' Drawing\non the organizational knowledge of getting things done allowed this engineer\nto justify performing work that required making some concessions by recasting\nhimself as an organization member who did whatever tasks were necessary to\naccomplish organizational goals.\nShared organizational knowledge of how to be a ``jack of all trades'' also\nhelped the moderates to collaborate in T2. In daily interactions in T2, moderate\nmarketers and moderate engineers reinforced with one another the importance\nof using jack-of-all-trades organizational knowledge. For example, in T2, as sev-\neral moderate engineers and two moderate marketers waited for a meeting to\nbegin, a moderate marketer remarked that she was having trouble getting a rad-\nical engineer to make back-end changes needed for the SuperSender e-mail tool\nproject. ``I know it's not the work he wants to be doing, but it's frustrating for\nme too,'' the moderate marketer said. A moderate engineer smiled wryly and\n4 This knowledge had been commonly drawn on before Transco went public, roughly a year before\nour study began. Though moderate engineers had generally been at the company for less time than\nhad radical engineers, most had been at the company before it went public and hence had been\nexposed to these two kinds of organizational knowledge. In the past, these two kinds of organiza-\ntional knowledge had not been used to facilitate cross-occupational collaboration but rather to moti-\nvate Transco members to distinguish themselves as dedicated employees and to get important\norganizational work done.\nsaid, ``Yeah . . . he's not going to do that. [The radical engineer] is not exactly a\njack of all trades.'' Everyone in the room laughed. The exchange helped enhance\nthe moderates' shared commitment to using jack-of-all-trades knowledge.\nModerate engineers working on increasing the frequency with which single-\ntrip insurance was offered to customers after the successful pilot drew on this\nshared jack-of-all-trades knowledge to collaborate with a moderate marketer.\nThe work did not involve creatively applying engineering skills or using cutting-\nedge programming languages--``It's not exciting work,'' one engineer said.\nAnother noted that he had not previously worked on the insurance product but\nthat he was a ``jack of all trades'' and agreed to do the work.\nDrawing on historical organizational authority relations. In T1, moderate\nengineers had also resisted collaborating with moderate marketers because\ndoing so threatened engineers' jurisdictional claim to a superordinate position\nin Transco's occupational hierarchy. Faced with the strong radical flank threat in\nT2, moderate engineers collaborated with moderate marketers by drawing on\ntwo kinds of historical Transco organizational understandings of authority rela-\ntions: pre-IPO authority relations and Transco club authority relations.\nAccording to both moderate engineers and moderate marketers, before the\nIPO (before T1), it had been common practice for engineers and marketers to\ndo ``favors'' for one another: for an engineer to make a quick website change\nfor a marketer, or a marketer to promote an innovative product feature that\nengineers had created. In T2 projects, the moderates' shared understanding of\npre-IPO organizational authority relations helped them to launch important proj-\nects, such as the agent change codes for the Basic Plan project. Historically,\nTransco had offered only one membership plan (annual, no limits to usage). The\nBasic Plan project was designed to introduce a lower-priced plan (annual, limited\nMonday\u00adFriday usage) to help retain customers who might otherwise cancel their\nservice and to recruit new customers who might find the traditional plan's fees\ntoo high. A moderate marketer was leading the design and implementation of a\nportion of this project: the ``reasons for changing plans'' codes that customer ser-\nvice agents would use when entering into their systems why a given customer\nwas upgrading or downgrading a membership plan. Tracking these data would\nallow the marketers to analyze the profitability of the Basic Plan. The project was\nproposed by the marketer, and the moderate engineer assigned to the project\nsaid, ``I'm basically just expected to do what the marketer has already mapped\nout.'' But the moderate marketer drew on pre-IPO organizational understandings\nof authority relations by telling the moderate engineer that she appreciated the\nfavor. The moderate engineer told us that ``there are people who I would not do\nthis for. If [several radical marketers] asked me, I'd tell them they need to go put\ntheir request in the proper [development system] format, or I'd just say I didn't\nhave time. With [the moderate marketer], it was basically a favor . . . I believed\nI'd get it back.'' Drawing on the shared pre-IPO organizational understandings of\nauthority relations allowed the moderate engineer to justify performing work that\nrequired making some concessions in occupational authority relations by recast-\ning her work as ``doing a favor,'' as had been done in the past.\nIn T2, the moderate engineers and marketers also drew on historical organi-\nzational understandings of Transco club authority relations to collaborate with one\nanother. Several of the moderate engineers participated in the sustainability club\nand, in their interactions with other staff members there, were used to offering\nsuggestions on projects in which they did not play the lead role. In T2, the moder-\nate engineer and the moderate marketer staffed on a single-trip insurance project\ndrew on the Transco club egalitarian decision-making rules. This project was\ndesigned to offer insurance for single trips to university students, a separate mar-\nket for Transco, and presented new challenges because insurance policies for\nthose under age 25 differed from those for drivers over 25, and also because\nlaws varied by state. Though the marketer was directing the project, the engineer\nsuggested ways to adapt how the product was offered, such as seeing if stu-\ndents over age 21 might be able to get lower rates than those under 21. The\nmoderate marketer agreed to incorporate the engineer's suggestions into the\nproject plan, and the two had an extended exchange about how Transco could\nmake this work. Together, they agreed that having the chance to buy single-trip\ninsurance as a college student was ``a nice feature--something I wish I'd had.''\nDrawing on historical organizational values. Finally, in T1, moderate engi-\nneers had resisted collaborating with moderate marketers because doing so\nthreatened engineers' occupational values, such as ``developing cutting-edge\ntechnology.'' In T2, however, moderate engineers collaborated with moderate\nmarketers by drawing on historical Transco organizational values, as these\ntranscended occupational differences, particularly for employees with long\ntenures. The two organizational values that the moderates used to collaborate\nwith one another in T2 were ``keep Transco quirky, not corporate'' and ``protect\nthe customer community.''\nA moderate engineer explained to us that ``keeping Transco quirky, not cor-\nporate'' involved ``showing that we're basically the opposite of a slow, unhip,\nbureaucratic car rental company . . . even if we are a public company.'' We\nobserved several moderate marketers in T2 highlight their dedication to keep-\ning Transco quirky by participating in longstanding Transco traditions, like the\nburrito club: a tradition from the startup days, led by an engineer, in which the\nengineer sent out funny e-mails to invite select Transco members one Friday\neach month to test burrito offerings from different local restaurants. Moderate\nengineers drew on this value to collaborate with a moderate marketer on an\nelection day promotion project encouraging people to rent cars to drive to the\npolls, which did not involve building novel technology. In T1, both moderate\nand radical engineers had told us that they disagreed with working on promo-\ntions because ``we shouldn't just be doing small-time things; our energy should\nbe focused on building next generation technology systems.'' But a moderate\nmarketer drew on the ``keeping Transco quirky, not corporate'' value by explain-\ning to a moderate engineer that promotions could help further Transco's repu-\ntation as a quirky, independent company that did seasonal promotions. In\nhighlighting the benefits for maintaining Transco's roots, as opposed to high-\nlighting revenue potential, the moderate marketer made the project more\nappealing for the moderate engineer, who agreed to help. The engineer\nexplained to us, ``We [Transco] have all this potential to really transform urban\nmobility with our technology and new technology we can build, and so it's kind\nof frustrating to be going after smaller time things like promotions. At the same\ntime, these holiday promotions are a good thing to do because they show our\nquirky side and show we're not like some crusty rental car company.''\nAnother organizational value that moderate engineers and marketers drew\non in T2 was ``protect the customer community.'' A moderate engineer\ndescribed how a sense of community among customers had always been\nimportant for car sharing to work: ``being considerate really matters--you need\npeople filling up the tank for the next person, throwing away garbage so the car\nis clean, and returning the car on time so the person with the next reservation\ndoesn't get delayed.'' A moderate marketer pointed out to us in front of several\nmoderate engineers that Transco's historic association with environmentalism\nhelped strengthen the sense of community; it generated ``goodwill'' between\ncustomers and the organization and created a sense that customers were like-\nminded people hoping to protect the environment. Moderate marketers and engi-\nneers in T2 drew on this value to collaborate on a portion of the single-trip insur-\nance project for first-time customers. The moderate engineers and moderate\nmarketer had worked together on a different single-trip insurance project in T1 as\nwell. In T1, one of the moderate engineers had criticized this proposed new prod-\nuct because he believed efforts should be focused on developing novel technol-\nogy that would help make customers' lives better. In T1, another one of the\nmoderate engineers ``forgot'' to perform important pieces of work related to the\nproject. In T2, the same moderate marketer led the project designed to offer\nsingle-trip insurance to first-time customers and drew on the ``protect the cus-\ntomer community'' value to elicit the moderate engineers' cooperation. At a daily\nscrum meeting, the moderate engineer who had ``forgotten'' to perform impor-\ntant pieces of work in T1 said, ``I'm worried this will send the wrong message\nabout us. Too sell-y.'' He was particularly concerned because first-time customers\nwere an ``important group forming a first impression of us.'' He suggested that\nTransco track usage among first-time customers, so changes could be made if\ncustomers weren't interested. The marketer agreed, citing the importance of\n``protecting the community.'' The engineer later explained to us that working with\nthis marketer was ``not so bad,'' as the marketer ``is someone who gets the com-\nmunity piece of Transco . . . it makes her a lot better to work with.'' He even\ndefended his collaboration later to a radical engineer who criticized single-trip\ninsurance. The radical engineer suggested that the moderate engineer ``disable''\na portion of the reservations system that offered the product to prevent it from\nbeing launched. The moderate engineer responded to the radical engineer, ``It's\nactually not so bad . . . I think some people want it.''\nBy collaborating on strategic projects, moderate engineers and marketers\nallowed Transco to advance its new strategy by offering new types of services\nand attracting new types of customers. For example, single-trip insurance was\ncrucial to accomplishing Transco's new strategy because insurance products\nwere highly profitable and Transco wanted to begin offering ancillary services.\nSimilarly, the collaboration on the election day promotion advanced Transco's\nstrategy related to increasing customer awareness and adoption in existing\nmarkets because it significantly drove up customer usage on that day--and, as\na moderate marketer explained, ``when customers . . . see how easy it is, we\ngenerally see increased usage from them in the future.''\nTime 2: Moderate Engineers Do Not Collaborate with Radical Marketers\nIn T2, moderate engineers continued to resist radical marketers, who continued\nto draw on marketing occupational knowledge in T2, such as when a radical\nmarketer asked a moderate engineer for help launching the percentage-off pro-\nmotion capability project, to distribute discount codes via e-mail that customers\ncould use in Transco's online reservations system. As with the projects that\nmoderate marketers worked on with moderate engineers, the project did not\ninvolve applying complex engineering skills but instead involved what the engi-\nneer described as enabling ``random marketing features.'' The radical marketer\ndrew on only marketing knowledge to decide how best to prioritize the work,\nsaying ``we've got to do this and we need to do it like [name of prominent retai-\nler] does.'' The radical marketer told the engineer, ``This is important for driving\nup usage during lower-usage times; we've done the analysis.'' The engineer\nresponded, ``We can't do that; our system won't support percentages off.''\nAfter some more back and forth with the moderate engineer, the radical mar-\nketer dropped the issue. The next day, a different engineer told us, ``[That mod-\nerate engineer] knows the code front and back. He said we can't do a\npercentage off for the promotions. That's not really true because we can do\nit--it will just take two extra weeks of work.'' Because the moderate engineer\ndidn't cooperate, the project was not launched.\nRadical marketers also continued to draw on marketing understandings of\nauthority relations in T2. For example, the custom coupon capability project, to\ndevelop coupons for different customer segments, demanded constraining\nengineering understandings of authority relations because it was proposed by a\nmarketer. The radical marketer did not draw on Transco organizational under-\nstandings of authority relations to direct the work, instead saying, ``Look, this is\nsomething we need fast. Most other companies can do it.'' The moderate engi-\nneer, who later told us that he felt like he was ``being treated like a pair of\nhands,'' was annoyed and told the marketer he did not have time to complete\nthe work. The project never launched. ``Saying you're too busy often works,''\nthe engineer said. We saw this same engineer cooperate with a moderate mar-\nketer in T2 on a relatively similar project, and when asked why, he explained\nthat the moderate marketer took more of a ``partnering'' approach and allowed\nhim to have input into how the work should be done.\nFinally, radical marketers continued to draw on marketing values in T2. For\nexample, a radical marketer asked a moderate engineer who had helped launch\nthe election day promotion to help launch another promotion, a new loyalty pro-\ngram that would give frequent customers special discounts and privileges. The\nproject did not involve building novel technology but instead involved bringing in\nnew customers and retaining existing ones at a higher rate so that Transco could\ncontinue to grow its market share. Instead of using Transco's organizational val-\nues to justify the project, such as saying it would help customers, the radical mar-\nketer told the moderate engineer that the project was important because ``the\nanalysts liked this idea.'' The engineer pushed back by asking, ``Why would we\noffer something to get customers to drive more? Aren't we trying to limit car pol-\nlution?'' The project was not completed, as the engineer refused to do the work.\nWhen we asked moderate engineers in T2 why they sometimes cooperated\nwith marketers and other times did not, they told us that ``being cooperative\nwith marketers'' and ``getting projects like single-trip insurance done'' were\nways to demonstrate their value to the organization. Several noted that, given\nmarketers' increasing importance, demonstrating the willingness and ability to\nwork with marketers was a way to advance the moderate engineers' careers\nat Transco. One moderate engineer said, ``I'd like to stay at Transco and these\ndays, as an engineer, you can't get away with only working with other engi-\nneers . . . [and] refusing to help marketers all the time.'' In T2, a different mod-\nerate engineer said that as long as he was helpful to some marketers, he\n``didn't need to say yes to everything.''\nIn addition, moderate engineers' comments reflected that they hoped to pre-\nvent the more-dramatic change in engineering occupational goals being\ndemanded by radical marketers. As one moderate engineer explained to us in\nT2, ``I think some [moderate] marketers are a bit more interested in not wreck-\ning what's special about this place.'' Another engineer explained, ``Now there\nare some marketers like [two radical marketers] who my gut tells me to just\nsay no to. Then there are others like [two moderate marketers] who I am okay\nsaying yes to . . . and we are the ones who actually get projects done.''\nRadical marketers did not learn from their failures and draw on Transco his-\ntorical organizational knowledge, understandings of authority relations, and val-\nues in their interactions with moderate engineers. Our data provide two reasons\nfor this. First, given their strong commitment to marketing occupational goals,\nthey were unwilling to engage in actions that would have threatened marketing\nknowledge, understandings of authority relations, and values. Second, their top-\ntier marketing credentials afforded them attractive opportunities for horizontal\njob mobility, which made it unnecessary for them to compromise.\nIn addition, they met strong resistance from radical engineers. Unlike the\nmoderate engineers, the radical engineers did not experience a strong radical\nflank threat in T2, and they did not engage in coalition building and collaboration\nwith either moderate or radical marketers. Radical engineers continued to say\nthat it made most sense to resist collaboration; as one put it, ``I say `no' to all\nof them.'' For example, when a radical marketer asked a radical engineer for\nhelp on the priority booking project, for customers who would pay extra for the\nprivilege, the engineer noted that it was ``tedious work'' and that sorting out\nthe issues would take ``weeks of headaches.'' The marketer argued, ``Well, we\nneed something like this; we have customers willing to pay.'' The engineer\nrefused to do the work, and the project never launched.\nThe reason that moderate marketers chose to collaborate with the moderate\nengineers, rather than to act collectively with the radical marketers to improve\nproject launch rates for both subgroups of marketers, seems to be that both\ngroups of moderates were under threat. Social movement theorists suggest\nthat coalition building is more likely to occur in response to threats than in\nresponse to opportunities (McCammon and Campbell, 2002). Both the moder-\nate engineers and the moderate marketers were under threat from the radical\nmarketers; moderate marketers were under threat because they saw the influx\nof radical marketers with formal marketing credentials as having led to moderate\nmarketers' being told that they were not competent in the key skills required for\ntheir roles. So both groups of moderates were motivated to engage in coalition\nbuilding with one another. The radical marketers were not under threat and did\nnot attempt to enlist the moderate marketers to act collectively with them to\nimprove project launch rates for both subgroups of marketers.\nPossible Alternative Explanations\nThere are several possible alternative explanations for the successful collabora-\ntion we observed between the moderate engineers and marketers in T2:\nstructural power, differences between moderate and radical marketers in com-\nmunication style, differences in cultural distance, differences in tenure-based\nties, and differences in project types. We address all of these in the Online\nAppendix (http://asq.sagepub.com/supplemental) to conserve space.\nDISCUSSION\nOur findings contribute to our understanding of adaptation and inertia in\ntechnology-based organizations, cross-occupational collaboration, and conflict\nin organizations. Figure 1 summarizes the theory of how a radical flank threat\ncan lead to cross-occupational collaboration or lack of it for incremental technol-\nogy development.\nAdaptation and Inertia in Technology-based Organizations\nThe current literature has focused on the development of radical new technolo-\ngies that enable incumbent firms to remain competitive as their environments\nchange (e.g., Tushman and O'Reilly, 1996; Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000). It does not\nexplore the dynamics associated with the transition from developing radical new\ntechnologies to engaging in incremental innovation. Our study highlights that, far\nfrom being an easy transition, this shift can be very challenging for an organization\nbecause it requires a shift in the balance of power away from the dominant engi-\nneering group that developed the initial technology and toward a challenger group\nin the organization. Shifts in balance of power during times of technology change\nBecause it has focused on the development of radical new technologies, the\nexisting literature on incumbent adaptation details mechanisms that shield and\nprotect the technology development efforts of the challenger engineering\ngroup from the dominant engineering group (e.g., Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000).\nOur study highlights a different mechanism useful for adaptation in cases such\nas the transition from developing radical new technologies to engaging in incre-\nmental innovation in which the challenge is fostering collaboration. We find that\na strong radical flank threat can facilitate such collaboration. In the face of a\nstrong threat by radical members of a challenger group, moderate members of\nthe dominant engineering group may change their perceptions about their\npower to resist challengers' demands and may make distinctions between the\ngoals and tactics of radical challengers and those of more-moderate challen-\ngers. To maintain as much power as possible and prevent the more-dramatic\nchange in the dominant group's goals being demanded by radical challengers,\nmoderate members of the dominant group may accept the coalition-building\nefforts of moderate challengers, and these two groups of moderates may colla-\nborate for incremental technology development.\nFinally, the current literature primarily examines cases in which the members\nof the dominant and challenger groups are in the same occupation: engineering\nare from different occupations and an organizational transition threatens the\npower of the dominant group, however, the challenge is to get dominant occu-\npational group members to make the day-to-day concessions in occupational\nknowledge, understandings of authority relations, and values required for colla-\nboration.

Such a threat can lead moderate members of the\ndominant group to change their perceptions about their power to resist the\ndemands of the challenger group, to distinguish between the goals and tactics\nof radical versus more-moderate challengers, and to build a coalition with mod-\nerate challengers and collaborate with them to maintain as much power as pos-\nsible and prevent the more-dramatic change in dominant occupational group\ngoals being demanded by radical challengers.\nThe current literature on cross-occupational collaboration also describes\noccupation members as a unified group (Bechky, 2003b; Kellogg, Orlikowski,\nwithin occupational groups working inside an organization, there can be hetero-\ngeneity in how committed occupation members are to using occupational\nknowledge, understandings of authority relations, and values in their work.\nGouldner (1957) referred to these different kinds of occupation members as\n``cosmopolitans'' versus ``locals.'' We show that the presence of these differ-\nent kinds of members in each occupation may allow an opportunity for cross-\noccupational collaboration between the less occupationally oriented members\nof each group, who may be more amenable to making the day-to-day conces-\nsions required for collaboration.\nFinally, the current literature suggests that cross-occupational collaboration\npractices may change over time through a process of slippage between the\njurisdictional structures and the everyday interactions of occupation mem-\nbers (e.g., Barley, 1986), through a process of improvisation as organization\nmembers appropriate new technology into their work practices (Orlikowski,\npractices of the dominant group to evaluation, questioning, and de-\nlegitimation (Huising, 2014). We show that cross-occupational collaboration\npractices may also change over time through a process of moderate mem-\nbers of both occupational groups building a coalition with one another. By\ndrawing on shared organizational knowledge, understanding of authority rela-\ntions, and values, moderates can build a coalition to engage in new forms of\ninteraction and, in turn, enact new occupational knowledge, understandings\nof authority relations, and values that allow them to engage in ongoing\ncollaboration.\nConflict in Organizations\nThese findings also contribute to our understanding of conflict in organizations\nin two ways. First, the literature on organizational conflict has demonstrated\nthat team members experience three major types of interpersonal conflicts in\ntheir everyday dyadic interaction: task conflicts, process conflicts, and relation-\nship conflicts (e.g., Jehn, 1995). The findings presented here highlight that\nwhen an organizational team is composed of members from different occupa-\ntional groups and the power of the dominant occupational group is under\nthreat, what look like idiosyncratic, interpersonal conflicts may actually be struc-\ntured manifestations of a collective jurisdictional struggle playing out in the\norganization. Under these conditions, interpersonal task conflicts--\ndisagreements over ideas and opinions pertaining to the group's task--may be\nshaped by broader struggles between a challenger group and a dominant group\nover the knowledge of the dominant occupational group. Interpersonal process\nconflicts--disagreements about dividing and delegating responsibilities and\ndeciding how to get work done--may be shaped by broader struggles between\na challenger group and a dominant group over the authority of the dominant\noccupational group. And interpersonal relationship conflicts--disagreements\nresulting from interpersonal incompatibilities such as different values--may be\nshaped by broader struggles between a challenger group and a dominant group\nover the values of the dominant occupational group. Our findings are consistent\nwith Bendersky and Hays (2012), who demonstrate that team members' con-\nflicts can be shaped by individuals' concerns about their individual status in\naddition to their concerns about task, process, or relationship conflict. We\ndemonstrate that, in teams composed of members from different occupational\ngroups during a time when the power of the dominant group is under threat,\nteam members' conflicts can be also shaped by collective concerns about pro-\ntecting or increasing the valuable jurisdiction of their occupational group.\nSecond, the literature on organizational conflict shows that faultlines based\non demographic characteristics can increase the conflict experienced in a team\n(Lau and Murnighan, 2005). Scholars have demonstrated that one way to deac-\ntivate faultlines is by giving groups a superordinate group identity (Jehn and\nBezrukova, 2010), and they have called for additional studies of how faultlines\ncan be deactivated and conflict decreased (Jehn and Greer, 2012). We demon-\nstrate that one way to deactivate faultlines may be by introducing a strong radi-\ncal flank threat that leads more-moderate members of each group to engage in\ncoalition building by drawing on organizational knowledge, understandings of\nauthority relations, and values rather than those of the occupational groups.\nFuture Research\nOur findings highlight several boundary conditions for a radical flank threat to\nbe useful during the transition from developing radical new technologies to\nincremental technology development: (1) a well-entrenched engineering group\ncomposed of some members with a strong occupational orientation (radical\nengineers) and some members with a less strong occupational orientation\n(moderate engineers), (2) a challenger occupational group composed of some\nmembers with a strong occupational orientation (radical challengers) and some\nmembers with a less strong occupational orientation (moderate challengers),\n(3) a critical event, (4) radical challengers' use of the critical event to make visi-\nble demands for dramatic change, and (5) moderate challengers' signaling to\nengineers that they are less committed to dramatic change than are radical\nchallengers. Based on the wide use of Gouldner's concept of cosmopolitans\nversus locals, we think that it is likely quite common for engineering groups\nand challenger groups to be composed of some members with a strong occu-\npational orientation and some with a less strong occupational orientation.\nFuture research could determine how often radical challengers use critical\nevents to make visible demands for dramatic change and moderate challengers\nsignal to dominant group members that they are less committed to dramatic\nchange than are radical challengers. Future research could explore the condi-\ntions under which moderate solutions accomplished by the radical flank effect\ncan be productive to the success of an organization going through a power\nshift. Finally, though our study focuses on dynamics between an engineering\nand marketing group, these dynamics might occur between other kinds of\ndominant and challenger groups in organizations undergoing transitions (e.g., in\na financial services company with a dominant sales department, if the business\nmodel changed in a way that privileged the analytics department). Future\nresearch might also explore if, when, and how the radical flank effect can be\nvaluable for organizations during other types of transitions.\n"
