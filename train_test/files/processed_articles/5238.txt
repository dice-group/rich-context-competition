This\nexpanded (von Hippel and Trivers, 2011) but has not been empirically tested, in part\nDeceiving yourself\nbecause the theory does not specify a mechanism by which to place information in the\nunconscious or ways to falsify that such placement occurs. It is also unclear about the\nadaptive value of keeping truthful information from the self (Leeuwen, 2007), and it is\ndifficult to separate deception from self-deception when inferred mainly from the self-\nserving outcome but not other conditions of deception. The purpose of the present study\nwas to provide the first empirical test of Trivers' theory by addressing the aforementioned\nissues.\nSpecifically, we propose a dual-retrieval system to operationalize and empirically\ntest self-deception within Trivers' theoretical framework. The dual-retrieval system that\nallows an individual to retrieve truthful information twice--once under the motivation to\ndeceive and once after deception is achieved--resolves the potential controversy about the\nadaptiveness of keeping truthful information from the self (Leeuwen, 2007). We propose\nthat, by keeping fitness-enhancing information away from both self and others, self-\ndeception as an adaptation must cease to operate in most instances once the goal of\ndeception has been achieved. Truthful information that once has been kept from both self\nand others will then be retrieved to benefit the self. Such information manipulation makes\nmemory likely to have been co-opted to execute self-deception. Memory research thus\nprovides a good paradigm within which to test hypotheses about self-deception. Although\nencoding may also be used (von Hippel and Trivers, 2011), especially in intra-individual\nself-deception, in this paper we focus on retrieval in inter-individual or social interactional\ncontexts.\nWe also set conditions under which self-deception is deemed more likely than\ndeception. Because the more costly self-deception evolved to escape detection, it must\nrespond to social conditions that register the probability of deception detection such that\npeople should self-deceive when they sense high rather than low probabilities of detection.\nThe social status of the deceived, relative to that of the deceiver, represents one of the\ndetection-registering conditions that should affect the likelihood and activation of self-\ndeception. We argue that the evolutionary \"arms race\" between deception and deception\ndetection is more likely to have played out between the low-status individuals as deceivers\nand high-status individuals as detectors rather than the other way around and is likely to\nlead to people deceiving themselves to deceive high- rather than low- or equal-status\nothers. Whereas we focus on status as an example of increased detection probability, other\nvariables such as the number of targets to be deceived also affect the probability of\ndetection. Because it is generally easier to deceive one rather than multiple targets, high-\nstatus individuals are more likely to self-deceive the public or groups of individuals than\nsingle individuals. In this paper, we focus on social status, but not number of deceiving\ntargets or others, as a condition in individual but not group deception.\nThe arms race between low-status deceivers and high-status detectors\nHumans and other primates live in hierarchical social groups where status\ninfluences resource distribution (Boehm, 1999; Wright, 1994). High-status individuals who\nattained their position either by force or social intelligence (Ellis, 1995; Nettle, 2003) have\nmore resources than low-status individuals and have the power to punish the latter for rule\nDeceiving yourself\nsurveillance often attempt to hide resources from high-status individuals (Whiten and\nByrne, 1988). In this case, low-status individuals should be more motivated to deceive,\nwhereas high-status individuals should be more motivated to detect deception. High-status\nindividuals have more honest means (through force or by changing the rules) to acquire\nresources than do low-status individuals. High-status individuals also have more\nresources--including information leading to the deception detection--and the means to\npunish deceivers. In contrast, low-status individuals are more limited detectors who may\nface revenge for detecting deception. Detecting deception does not enhance fitness if the\ndetector is unable to punish but may be retaliated by the deceiver. There is thus more\npressure to perfect deception when one has the need to deceive but also faces increased\nchances to be caught and punished. The same pressure to better deceive is much reduced\nwhen one expects little punishment from the detector if caught deceiving or has other\nhonest means to pursue the same fitness gains. Social status may therefore shift selection\npressure to favor low-status individuals over high-status individuals as fearful deceivers\nand the high-status individuals over low-status individuals as vigilant detectors. Thus,\nTrivers' arms race between deception and detection is likely to have played out between\nlow-status deceivers and high-status detectors, leading to people deceiving themselves to\nbetter deceive high- rather than low- or equal-status others.\nAnimal research shows that subordinates spend time hiding desirable resources or\nrule violations from dominant peers who police the group (Byrne and Whiten, 1992;\nMitchell, 1999). The young European male kestrel grows female-like plumage to avoid\naggressive dominant older males and increase their chance of mating during the breeding\nseason (Hakkarainen, Korpim\u00e4ki, Huhta, and Palokangas, 1993). Ravens (Bugnyar and\nKotrschal, 2004) and pigs (Held, Mendl, Devereux, and Byrne, 2002) take detours from\nfood sources to mislead high-status conspecifics. Subordinate monkeys escorted their\nsuperiors far away from the food source, demonstrating a conspicuous and elaborate\ndeceptive ploy (Amici, Call, and Aureli, 2009; Ducoing and Thierry, 2003). Low-status\nchimpanzees only retrieved their food when it would be unseen by a high-status competitor\n(Hare, Call, Agnetta, and Tomasello, 2000) or a human experimenter (Hare, Call, and\nTomasello, 2006), whereas high-status chimpanzees took food openly (Hare et al., 2006).\nField observations demonstrate social status-regulated deception and detection in more\ndetail. In one case, a subordinate chimpanzee misled a dominant member away from where\nit had hidden a banana. Wary of deception, the high-status chimp did not go far. Later,\nwhen the subordinate retrieved the banana from its hiding place, the dominant chimp\nattacked (Whiten and Byrne, 1988). Relying on status, prestige, or violence in lieu of\ndeception, high-status animals are able to disperse, drive away, or attack subordinates to\nobtain what they want (Wright, 1994). They also detect, prevent, and punish rule-breaking\nbehaviors of low-ranking deceivers (Clutton-Brock and Parker, 1995) who, with no option\nof aggression or group alliance, are constantly pressured to improve their deceptive ploys.\nEvidence in humans is found in hierarchical social relations. The supervisor-\nsubordinate relationship is an example. Sales staff in retail stores and supermarkets did not\nreport customer complaints to their supervisors and restaurant servers hid incorrect orders\nworkplace superiors were vigilant toward potential subordinates deceit (Wintrobe and\nDeceiving yourself\nBreton, 1986). In an experiment using the Wason selection task, participants assigned a\nsupervisor role were better able to detect cheaters than participants who played\nsubordinates (Manktelow and Over, 1991). Once within a status hierarchy, such as the\nemployer-employee setting, human beings, like other animals, may be driven by the\nadditional motivation consistent with status-regulated deception and detection. Various\neffective management programs (e.g., self-managed work groups; Manz and Sims, 1993)\naim to break away from this mindset by reducing hierarchical elements of the work\nenvironment to improve labor relations and productivity (Kirkman and Rosen, 1999). The\nstate-citizen relationship provides another example in which the higher-level state employs\nlaw enforcement (i.e., detection) and correctional systems (i.e., punishment) to control\ndeception by its citizens (e.g., committing and hiding crimes, including cheating on taxes).\nCorruption provides another example that can happen when lower-ranking individuals or\ninstitutions choose not to report the misdeeds of the higher-ups for fear of retribution. In\neach of these hierarchical relationships, the higher level of the hierarchy is vigilant about\ndetecting deception from the lower level, thereby exerting pressure on subordinates to\nimprove deception strategies, meeting Trivers's hypotheses of self-deception.\nMemory helps to execute self-deception\nAccording to Trivers (2000), a blatant deceiver keeps both true and false\ninformation in the conscious mind but presents only falsehoods to others. In doing so, the\ndeceiver may leave clues about the truth due to its conscious access. A self-deceiver keeps\nonly false information in consciousness. Lying to others and to the self at the same time,\nthe self-deceiver thus leaves no clues about the truth retained in the unconscious mind\n(Trivers, 2000). This proposed mechanism has raised questions about the adaptiveness of\nself-deception because, by concealing information from others, the deceiver cannot access\ninformation to benefit him or herself (Leeuwen, 2007). To address this concern, we propose\na dual-retrieval memory process in which the self-deceiver first fails to retrieve information\nwhen motivated to deceive others and, after deception has been achieved, retrieves\ninformation to benefit him or herself. The difference between the two retrievals in the self-\nserving direction suggests self-deception.\nSpecifically, the dual-retrieval paradigm offers a self-deceiver two chances to\nretrieve (or distort) encoded information assumed to be fitness enhancing given the\nmotivation to keep it from the deceived. The first retrieval normally takes place in the\npresence of the deceived. The second retrieval often (but not always) takes place without\nthe deceived after a successful deception. For example, in front of a high-status food\nseeker, a low-status food hider forgets completely or partially where he/she hides food.\nAfter the food seeker leaves, the food hider remembers where the food is. In the first\nretrieval, the deceiver honestly distorts, partially retrieves, or fails to retrieve encoded\ninformation due to the motivation to deceive and to escape detection. In the second\nretrieval (when motivation changes from hiding to seeking food), the deceiver retrieves the\ntrue or full information to achieve fitness gains. Thus, the dual-retrieval paradigm addresses\nthe issue of adaptiveness and offers a way to verify self-deception, which is discrepancy\nbetween the two retrievals.\nMemory serves well to execute self-deception because its performance is subject to\nDeceiving yourself\nthe influence of goals and motivations. When motivated to survive, people memorize items\nencoded in survival-related situations better than other situations (Nairne, Pandeirada, and\nThompson, 2008). In directed forgetting, participants show better recall of the items they\nare instructed to remember compared to items they are asked to forget (Bjork and Bjork,\n1996); however, even though some of the forgetting items cannot be consciously retrieved,\nthey have been encoded and can be probed by implicit memory tests (David and Brown,\n2003). Thus, the mind suppresses unneeded information from memory. In hindsight bias,\npeople unintentionally modify their memories of past experience to be consistent with\ncurrent life goals (Leary, 1981; Pieters, Baumgartner, and Bagozzi, 2006). Such memory\nmodifications or distortions are due to processes of retrieval rather than encoding or storage\n(Hasher, Attig, and Alba, 1981). These evidences suggest that retrieval of encoded\nmaterials respond to the context defined by the specific goals and motivations that\ninfluence memory at the time. The dual-retrieval paradigm, therefore, can operationalize\nTrivers's self-deception by comparing two memories driven by two different motivations.\nExperimental operations and the present study\nThe dual-memory system provides a general approach by which to conduct research\non self-deception. The central focus of this approach is to obtain self-serving\ninconsistencies between two memories, one of which is motivated by deception and the\nother of which is free from deceptive motives. The present paper reports four studies that\nall used the same dual-retrieval paradigm. Participants were assigned to one of two\nconditions: deceiving a high-status target or deceiving an equal-status target. Our\nhypothesis was that the status differential would make the first group self-deceive the high-\nstatus target and would make the second group (openly) deceive the equal-status target. The\ndual-retrieval paradigm consists of encoding and the first and second retrieval. In the\nencoding stage, participants learned items for an upcoming vocabulary or knowledge\ncontest. In the first retrieval stage when participants were instructed or induced to deceive\neither a high-status (e.g., a teacher) or an equal-status target (e.g., a fellow student), they\nwere asked to recognize or recall the items they had previously seen. In the second\nretrieval, which was conducted purely as a memory test for monetary incentives,\nparticipants remembered the items alone without the deceiving target. The first retrieval\nwas motivated by deception. The second retrieval was free from deception. The two\nretrievals were compared. Self-deception was verified by more distorted memories in the\nfirst compared to the second retrieval that was self-serving.\nIn the first two studies, participants were instructed to lie to a high- or equal-status\ntarget. This creates constant deception motivation for all participants, eliminating the\nsuspicion that some participants may and some may not try to deceive. As perfect\ndeception, self-deception is unconscious or is conscious of being honest. If memory co-opts\nby distorting itself to enable such perfect deception to escape detection, participants under\nthe high-status condition were expected to show more memory loss or distortion in the first\nrecognition when they were instructed to lie compared to the second recognition when they\nDeceiving yourself\nwere not asked to lie, whereas participants lying to an equal-status target should experience\nlittle or no memory difference between the first and second recognition.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nuniversity in southern China were recruited to take part in an ostensible Chinese vocabulary\ntest for monetary awards.\nDesign and procedure\nThe design was a 2 (deceiving target: high- vs. equal-status) \u00d7 2 (recognition: first\nvs. second) mixed design. Participants were randomly assigned into one of two\nexperimental groups: high-status deception group (n = 22), where participants were asked\nto lie to a teacher, and equal-status deception group (n = 22), where participants were asked\nto lie to a fellow student. Participants took two recognition tests after an encoding stage\nwhere they learned Chinese words. In the first recognition test, participants were instructed\nto recognize words they had seen and, at the same time, to report the opposite to the high-\nor equal-status target. Specifically, if participants remembered to have seen or not to have\nseen a word, they would need to indicate so and, at the same time, need to lie to the target\nby communicating the opposite of the word recognition result. In the second recognition,\nparticipants were asked to recognize the words alone for monetary incentives. Moderate\nmonetary awards were promised and later given to participants for lying to the target.\nEncoding. Participants were told to compete in a Chinese vocabulary contest by\nmaking a sentence for each word presented to them and, before the test, they had a chance\nto review practice words similar to those on the real test. A total of 60 Chinese words were\npresented successively on a computer screen for 3 s each. These are later referred to as\nstudied or old items. Another batch of 60 words, matched in usage frequency, was also\nprepared. These are referred to as new items. Two old and two new items were used in\npractice trials prior to the first recognition, and 30 old and 30 new items were used in the\nfirst recognition. The other 30 old and 30 new items were used in the second recognition.\nThe order of these four types of items was counterbalanced among participants. After the\nencoding, participants were asked to count backwards for 30 s.\nTarget status. Each participant was informed that the practice words he or she had\njust seen were from the actual test due to a mistake made by the experimenter. The\nparticipant was told that he or she must conceal the exposed test words from a detector who\nwas going to check with each participant about the test exposure. The participant was\ninstructed further that, once the detector found out about the concealment, the participant's\nscore on the vocabulary test would be deducted accordingly, thus, affecting the\nparticipant's chance to win the monetary prices for the vocabulary test. Thus, the\nparticipant must pretend to be as honest as possible while concealing the test words. The\nparticipants were also promised (and later paid a constant amount) moderate payment for\nsuccessfully hiding the test exposure from the detector. Under the high-status deception\ncondition, the detector was introduced as a teacher, who was matched with the participant's\nDeceiving yourself\ngender, looked 10 years older than the participant, and was formally dressed. Under the\nequal-status condition, the person was introduced as a fellow student, who was of similar\nage and same gender as the participant, and wore causal wear.\nFirst recognition. A participant was told that, as each word appeared on the screen,\nhe or she must identify, as accurately as possible, whether he or she had seen the word\nbefore by pressing one of two particular keys on the keyboard and that the participant must\nlie to the detector by saying the opposite of his or her true memory. The participant was\nalso made aware of the fact that the detector was only watching the participant's face but\nwas not able to see the participant's hands which were hidden behind the computer. After\nthese instructions which were given to the participant without the detector's presence, the\ndetector showed up and was introduced to the participant either as a teacher or as a fellow\nstudent. The participant and the detector were then seated facing each other across a\ncomputer table and the participant proceeded with the recognition and deception task.\nSecond recognition. Each participant was debriefed and asked to identify as\naccurately as possible the words the participant had seen for monetary incentives.\nResults\nParticipants' performance on the recognition test was represented by three\nindicators: Hit, False Alarm, and Sensitivity d' (see Table 1). Hit is the percentage of old\nitems correctly identified as old. False alarm is the percentage of new items incorrectly\nidentified as old. Sensitivity d' represents participants' discrimination between old and new\nitems, with larger numbers representing better discrimination as well as better memory.\nTable 1.

For Hit, there was a significant interaction effect, F(1,42) = 27.06, p <\n.001, 2 = .39.

Results showed a significant three-way interaction, F(1,42) =\n6.65, p = .01, 2 = .14. Further analysis showed that, for correctly identifying old items, an\nwhereas, for correctly rejecting new items (i.e., 1 \u00ad false alarm), no interaction was found,\nwhen they deceived a high- but not equal-status target. The worse memory was due to\nincorrectly discriminating old items they had seen but not new items they had not seen.\nDiscussion\nThe results support our hypothesis that memory is temporarily worsened when one\nis deceiving a high- but not equal-status target. The temporary memory impairment driven\nby fear for detection thus helps to execute self-deception or perfect deception without\ndetection. Fear for detection is correlated with the social status of the deceived relative to\nthe deceiver (Cummins, 1999; Manktelow and Over, 1991) among other social conditions\ncontributing to the probabilities of deception detection. We further speculate that self-\ndeception may be automated by the mere presence of such social conditions as the social\nstatus of the deceived. Such social conditions have been so frequently tied to deception\ndetection and retribution in the evolutionary past that no conscious calculation of\nprobabilities of detection and punishment may be necessary or ever carried out. Participants\nunder the high-status deception condition failed to recognize items they had actually seen.\nWe speculate that the fear of detection was so strong and was so closely tied to social status\nthat, at the sight of a teacher, a student participant would at times automatically engage in\ncorrecting the deception that he or she was instructed to commit by misremembering an\nitem. We speculate that, within a \"forced to lie\" context such as the present experiment,\nfear for detection potentially imbedded in a recurrent hierarchical social relationship (e.g.,\nstudent-teacher relationship) would facilitate self-deception through impaired memory\nwithout having to experimentally induce deceiving motivations.\nOur speculation of a selected association between fear for detection and self-\ndeception is in part also supported by the finding that, when lying to the high-status target,\nparticipants only mis-remembered by not remembering items they had seen (i.e., reduced\nhit rates), but did not mis-remember by remembering items they had not seen (i.e., no\ndifference in false alarm). The first but not the second type of mis-remembering matches\nwith one common form of hierarchical relationship among primates, including humans:\nLow-status individuals hide from the high-status peers resources they have in possession or\nmistakes they have made. In one form or another, this type of hierarchical social interaction\nshould exert selection pressure to favor hiding and covering strategies among the low-status\nDeceiving yourself\npersons and finding and detecting strategies among the high-status persons. The subsequent\narms race (Trivers, 1976) is likely to be between status hierarchies, leading to the low-\nstatus individuals self-deceiving high-status individuals by not remembering what they\nhave rather than fabricating what they do not have. The high-status individuals, on the other\nhand, may be more likely to deceive by fabricating what they do not have or do not have\nenough of (e.g., abilities and resources or good will and altruism). More empirical work is\nneeded to test these speculations. There are also alternative explanations, especially given\nour fallible design, which we discuss in the end.\nAn alternative interpretation of the results of Study 1 may be that participants'\nmemories became worse simply by interacting with a high-status target. That is, even\nwithout being motivated or instructed to deceive the target, memory would become worse\nwhen interacting with a high- compared to low-status person. This is particularly true given\nthe unequal teacher-student relationship. We addressed this potential problem in Study 2 by\nasking participants to lie about some questions, which were test questions in Study 2, and\nto tell the truth about other questions, which were called practice questions. If an\nindividual's memory became worse simply by interacting with a high-status person but not\nby trying to deceive the person, the participant's memory on both kinds of material would\nbe equally worse when compared to interacting with an equal-status person. If memory\nimpairment occurred only on the test but not practice questions, then we had additional\nconfidence beyond that of Study 1 to support the hypothesis that people may use memory\nto execute self-deception especially when low-status individuals interact with high-status\nindividuals. We also included exit interview questions to measure how worried and afraid\nparticipants felt about being caught lying to the target to see if there were differences in\nthese emotions responding to the two kinds of targets. The design and procedure of the\nexperiment in Study 2 were identical to those of Study 1, but the encoding material was\ndifferent and was distinguished between test and practice questions.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nuniversity in southern China took part in an ostensible knowledge contest for monetary\nawards.\nProcedure and design\nParticipants were randomly assigned into one of two experimental groups: high-\nstatus interaction group (n = 28), where the detector was a teacher, and equal-status\ninteraction group (n = 24), where the detector was a student. Participants were told to\nparticipate in a history and geography knowledge contest. They were first given certain\npractice questions to study (encoding stage) and were then asked to lie about seeing some\nof these questions and to tell the truth about seeing other questions to a detector who was\nDeceiving yourself\neither a teacher or a fellow student. While lying or telling the truth, participants were at the\nsame time asked to indicate the true memory about seeing each question (first recognition).\nAfter debriefing, participants were asked to remember the questions they had seen for\nmonetary incentives (second recognition). The design was a 2 (interacting target: high- vs.\nequal-status) \u00d7 2 (recognition: first vs. second) \u00d7 2 (questions: lie vs. truth) mixed ANOVA\ndesign.\nEncoding. Participants were given 20 history questions (e.g., \"In which dynasty\nwas papermaking technology developed?\") and 20 geography questions (e.g., \"Which is the\nlongest river in the world?\"). By random assignment, half of the participants were told that\nthe 20 history questions were practice questions which they were supposed to study and\nthat the 20 geography questions were actual test questions which were given to them by\nmistake and they were not supposed to have read. For the other participants, the order of\nthese two types of questions was reversed. These 40 questions were randomly presented\none by one on a computer in a speed of 5 s per question. Each question was labeled either\nas \"history practice question,\" \"geography test question,\" \"geography practice question,\" or\n\"history test question.\" After encoding, participants were asked to count backwards for\nTwo parallel sets of 10 history and 10 geography questions that participants had not\nread were prepared as new items to be included in each of the two subsequent recognition\ntests. Thus, 10 history and 10 geography questions presented in the encoding stage were\nused as old items and 10 history and 10 geography questions not presented were used as\nnew items in the first recognition, and the same combination of the other 10 old and 10 new\nquestions was used in the second recognition. The assignment of 40 old or new items was\ncounterbalanced among participants.\nFirst recognition. Similar to Study 1, a participant was seated behind a computer\ntable across from a person who was introduced either as a teacher (high status) or as a\nfellow student (equal status). Not in the presence of the detector, a participant was told that\nthe detector came to check which questions the participant had read, and that the participant\nshould lie about seeing test questions. Specifically, if a participant had previously seen a\ntest question (old item), the participant should say to the detector that he/she had not and, if\nthe participant had not seen a test question (new item), the participant should say he/she\nhad seen the question. As each question appeared on the screen, the detector would ask, for\nexample, \"Did you read geography (history) question: which is the longest river in the\nworld?

A participant should\nidentify, as accurately as possible, whether he/she had previously seen the question by\npressing one of two particular keys on the keyboard, which was hidden from the detector.\nAs the participant keyed in the truth about each question privately, he/she either lied to the\nperson about what he/she remembered as a test question or told the truth about what he/she\nremembered as a practice question.\nSecond recognition. Each participant was then debriefed and asked to identify as\naccurately as possible the words he/she had seen for monetary incentives.\nIn the exit interview, a participant was asked three questions: \"Were you worried\nabout being caught?\" \"Did you feel nervous while lying?\" and \"What is the probability,\nfrom 0 to 100%, that you might be caught by the detector?\"\nDeceiving yourself\nResults and Discussion\nParticipants reported to have felt more nervous while lying to the high-status target\n2.40, p = .02, and the participants thought that the chance of being caught by the high-\nstatus detector was higher (M = .56, SD = .19) than the equal-status detector (M = .40, SD =\nParticipants' performance on the recognition test is shown in Table 2.

For practice\nquestions that participants told the truth about reading, a 2 (target) \u00d7 2 (recognition) mixed\nmodel ANOVA showed neither main effects nor an interaction effect.\nThese results suggest that participants had worse memory on material about which\nthey had to lie to a high- compared to equal-status target, whereas for material about which\nparticipants did not have to lie, their memory did not differ when interacting with a high- or\nan equal-status target. The worsened memory shown only when lying to a high-status target\nwas due to the motivation of deception rather than omnibus emotions, because memory for\nhonestly presented material was unimpaired. Such temporarily worsened memory helps\nlow-status individuals execute self-deception when lying to high-status others to whom\nlow-status individuals dare not lie for fear of detection.\nIn the previous two studies we explicitly instructed participants to lie in order to\nensure the motivation to deceive, because otherwise a deceptive motivation is, by\ndefinition, consciously inaccessible to individuals engaging in self-deception. However, it\nis more natural for the participants to choose to deceive on their own rather than being told\nto do so. In the present study, we created the situation such that it was inherently\nadvantageous for the participants to lie. The procedures, material, and instructions were\nidentical to those of Study 2 except that, instead of being instructed to lie to the detector as\nin Study 2, each participant was told that a detector would come to check on what questions\nthe participant had seen and that certain marks would be deducted from his/her contest\nscore in the end for each test question the participant reported having seen. Like Study 2,\nbecause of the experimenter's mistake, participants studied certain test questions that they\nwere not supposed to see. These test questions would help participants' performance on the\ncontest. Thus, participants were motivated to hide these test questions from the detector.\nWe also increased the monetary rewards for winning different prizes of the knowledge\ncontest to increase participants' motivation to deceive. Like in Study 2, participants were\nasked in the exit interview whether they lied to the detector and how afraid they were to lie\nto the detector.\nDeceiving yourself\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and designs\nuniversity in southern China were recruited to take part in an ostensible contest of general\nknowledge for monetary awards. They were randomly assigned into one of two\nexperimental groups: high-status interaction (n = 24), where the test detector was a teacher,\nand equal-status interaction (n = 24), where the detector was a student. The design was a 2\n(interaction target: high- vs. equal-status) \u00d7 2 (recognition: first vs. second) mixed design.\nResults and Discussion\nParticipants' performance on the two recognition tests is shown in Table 3.

Together, these results support the hypothesis of temporary memory\nimpairment when voluntarily lying or being told to lie, but not when telling the truth, to a\nhigh- compared to equal-status target. Through temporarily worsened memory, individuals\ndeceived themselves to better deceive high- compared to equal-status others.\nGeneral Discussion\nThis study is among the first to empirically test Trivers's theory of self-deception\n(Trivers, 1985, 2000). It also provides a methodological framework within which to\nconduct research on self-deception in general. This framework is based on memory\nresearch and approaches self-deception as inconsistencies between two memory tasks. This\napproach demonstrates how self-deception is adaptive when one self-deceives by being\nunaware of fitness enhancing information that is meant only to be kept away from others\n(Leeuwen, 2007). We show that self-deception is adaptive if true information is kept from\nthe self only during deception and is accessible to the self after the goal of deception has\nbeen achieved. Memory and its temporary loss or distortion aid this mental state of self-\ndeception. True information is not retrieved when the self-deceiver deceives others. When\ndeception ceases, the lost memory is recovered so that the self-deceiver benefits from\naccurate information. By suppressing truthful information (i.e., concealing to deceive) or\nby distorting encoded material (i.e., fabricating to deceive), memory helps one to\n\"honestly\" offer null or false information to others. This aspect of self-deception does not\nderive net fitness gains. By later retrieving the true information, memory helps to complete\nself-deception to achieve net fitness. Memory is a direct target of selection (Nairne,\nPandeirada, and Thompson, 2008). It also may be co-opted to perform self-deception by\nswitching between the two states of consciousness. That almost all deceptive ploys use\nmemory as an honest or dishonest excuse may not be a coincidence.\nAlthough we suggest that memory or the decoding stage of information processing\nexecutes self-deception, encoding may also achieve self-deceptive goals. Motivational\nbiases in information searching and screening influence attention, perception, and\ninterpretation of incoming materials (Balcetis, 2008; Mele, 1997). These encoding biases of\ninformation processing contribute to a type of self-deception widely studied as an\nintrapersonally-oriented information manipulation process that achieves mental wellbeing.\nWell-known examples of intrapersonal self-deception include moderate optimism (Taylor\nand Brown, 1988), self-services (Greenwald, 1988), and competency and morality self-\nenhancement (Paulhus and John, 1998). In addition to being involved in intrapersonal self-\nDeceiving yourself\ndeception, encoding may also be involved in interpersonal self-deception. People may\ndifferentially take in and decipher information with a motivation to deceive others.\nThrough biased encoding, the self-deceiver may somehow know in advance that the\ninformation so encoded will enhance fitness when retrieved to misinform others. Self-\ndeception may be achieved in the encoding stage where information is already distorted\nbefore storage (Von Hippel and Trivers, 2011). This is in contrast to our decoding\napproach, which assumes distorting information when being recalled. However, to be\nadaptive, biased encoding has to enhance fitness all of the time or the biased encoder must\nre-encode the information to stop self-deceiving after others have been deceived. Empirical\nwork is needed to test the encoding mechanism in interpersonal self-deception.\nThe present study also extends Trivers' theory by showing that the arms race\nbetween deception and deception detection is more likely to have been played out with\nlow-status people as deceivers and self-deceivers and high-status people as detectors rather\nthan the other way around. In the hierarchical groups of primates and ancestral (as well as\nmodern) humans, social status provides protection from punishment and retribution when\nconflicts arise among individuals or between individuals and the group (Wright, 1994).\nWhen caught deceiving in a hierarchical group setting, high-status individuals are less\nlikely to be punished than low-status individuals who often face more severe consequences.\nStatus differentials should pressure low-status individuals to be careful and fearful\ndeceivers, whereas high-status deceivers should become unscrupulous and bold. Research\non humans and other primates confirm this speculation. An alpha chimpanzee can freely\nexaggerate (i.e., deceive) his display of dominance and aggressiveness without being\nchallenged (Boehm, 1999). This is deemed similar to human leaders bragging about their\nefforts or abilities. High-status humans are calmer and show fewer changes in heart rate\nand skin conductance than their low-status counterparts when deceiving (Carney, 2010).\nLow-status deceivers are also more likely to be caught than high-status deceivers who have\nmore resources, including information leading to detection. Facing a higher likelihood of\ndetection with a higher certainty of punishment, low-status deceivers yet have a higher\nneed to deceive than high-status individuals because, being low in status, they have fewer\nresources and fewer honest means (e.g., either through force or alliance) to acquire them.\nHigh-status individuals who have more resources to lose, on the other hand, have a greater\nneed to detect deception. The selection pressures to evade detection and detect deception\naffect low-status and high-status individuals more than their counterparts, respectively. Our\nempirical findings imply that self-deception, especially when carried out by low-status\nindividuals, may have been selected to better deceive high- rather than equal-status others.\nAlthough this paper emphasizes status differences, we do not deny the possibility\nthat the arms race between deception and detection may have been advanced by the\nintrapersonal experience of being both a deceiver and deceit detector (von Hippel and\nTrivers, 2011). Having deceived makes one aware of the need to detect possible deception;\nin turn, the detecting experience makes one cautious not to be detected. Such intrapersonal\nexperience helps to advance both ends of the arms race. It is also apparent that all humans\nand many other animals have the potential to cheat and an equal urge to eliminate cheating,\nindependent of social ranking. There is clearly no division of labor between deceiving and\ndetecting. However, like any adaptation, environmental conditions shift selection power to\nDeceiving yourself\nfavor certain individuals over others as beneficiaries of the adaptation. We speculate that\nthe hierarchical context of primate groups (including humans) should favor high-status\nmembers as detectors and low-status members as deceivers more than the other way\naround. Both intrapersonal and interpersonal experience advances the arms race between\ndeceiving and detecting and should lead, as Trivers (2000) first theorized, to self-deception.\nOur findings support this speculation.\nFurthermore, our findings suggest that social status is so closely related to getting\ncaught and facing consequences that it may motivate self-deception without conscious\ncalculation of the odds of detection. Study 1 showed that when participants were instructed\nto lie free from punishment, they still showed comparatively worse first-round memory\nwhen lying to high-status compared to low-status targets. However, social status is not the\ndirect cause of self-deception; rather, it is a conditional variable that regulates the\nlikelihood of detection and punishment, and the latter motivates self-deception to avoid\ndetection. The number of targets to be deceived also moderates the probability of detection,\nwith a higher number increasing the likelihood of detection (Lu and Chang, 2011a, 2011b).\nIn other words, escaping detection from one person is easier than from a group because\neach group member contributes to detective pressure and raises the likelihood of detection.\nIn this context, self-deception is adaptive because by deceiving one target (i.e., the self) the\nperson successfully deceives multiple targets (i.e., the group). Like social status, the\nnumber of deceived may moderate self-deception such that it is more likely to occur when\none has to deceive a group of individuals rather than a single individual. We speculate that,\nespecially when high-status people engage in self-deception, their targets are more likely to\nbe groups than individuals. Religious and political leaders, in relation to their congregations\nand constituencies, are good examples of self-deception serving to deceive groups.\nIntrapersonal self-deception, such as self-enhancement, may represent a mental state that is\nunder constant pressure to group-deceive everyone around the deceiver (i.e., the general\npublic). Other moderators may include perceived determination of the target to detect and\navenge. Based on our findings regarding social status, we expect all of these social\nconditions to enhance the likelihood of self-deception. That is, self-deception is more likely\nto happen when low-status people try to deceive high-status people, when a single\nindividual tries to deceive a group, or when the deceiver perceives a clear determination\nfrom the target to detect and avenge.\nThere are several limitations of this study, many of which are imbedded in the\noperationalization of the unconscious process of self-deception. In deception research, a lie\ncan be verified either by post-experiment interviews or by readings of the participants'\nheart rate and skin conductance. Because self-deception is partially unconscious, it cannot\nbe verified even physiologically, although some researchers believe that skin conductance\nmay show signs contradicting the conscious belief (Gur and Sackeim, 1979). Self-\ndeception is inferred by establishing the motivation to deceive and by obtaining\ninconsistencies between two memories which must also be distinguished from blatant\ndeception. In Study 1 and 2, we instructed participants to lie. This ensures the motivation to\ndeceive. In Study 1, 2, and 3, we asked participants to remember which items they had seen\nbefore reporting them to the target. This separates out the direct deceivers who would\nremember and report different items. However, these design features reduce the ecological\nDeceiving yourself\nvalidity of our studies because in real deception, a deceiver or a self-deceiver only lies or\nreports to the target without first recording his/her memory.\nWe used factual items in all studies to examine how memory executes self-\ndeception. This kind of memory offers insufficient room for distortion. Memory for\nepisodes or personal experience may provide more room for distortion to better facilitate\nself-deception. Future studies are also needed to test self-deception on participants from\nother non-Chinese cultural backgrounds. Even though the issue under discussion represents\npan-cultural evolutionary predictions, culture and the social settings from which culture\nevolved may have particularly relevant bearing on social interactive strategies. More deeply\nrooted in social compared to individual learning (Chang et al., 2011), Asians who also\nseem to pay special attention to social hierarchy may be particularly prone to self-deception\ncompared to straight deception. More replications using more diverse cultural groups will\nhelp to confirm and illuminate evolutionary predictions.\nFinally, whereas self-deception is originally construed mainly as an interpersonal\nstrategy to facilitate the deception of others (Trivers, 1976, 1985), it has also been studied\nas an intrapersonal variable that represents chronic mis-representation or selective\nrepresentation of the self without immediate reference to others (Kurzban and Aktipis,\npresent study focuses on the interpersonal process of self-deception. Future research may\nexamine both interpersonal and intrapersonal self-deception together to better understand\nthis social adaptation. Despite these limitations, this is among the first studies to test an\nimportant evolutionary theory about self-deception. Methodologically, this study\ndemonstrates the use of dual-retrieval as a useful paradigm within which to conduct future\nstudies on self-deception. Theoretically, the study demonstrates how the memory system\nmay have been co-opted to execute self-deception, and how social hierarchy may have\nshifted selection power to favor low- over high-status individuals as deceivers and self-\ndeceivers.\nReferences\nAlexander, R.
