Social\nmedia data mining and the question\nof public agency\nHelen Kennedy1 and Giles Moss2\n Keywords\nSocial media data mining, data mining, publics, agency, knowing publics, calculated publics\nIntroduction\nSocial media data mining is on the rise. The increasing\navailability of data on users and their online behaviour,\nthe decreasing cost of collecting, storing and processing\ndata, and the exponential expansion of social media\nplatforms from which much of this data is taken\nmean that \u00ad at least in theory \u00ad an increasingly diverse\nrange of actors can mine social data. This process\ncan involve simply counting the likes and shares of\nsocial media content, or more advanced analysis of its\nstrength, sentiment, passion, reach and other quantifi-\nable characteristics (mentions, users, sources, hash-\ntags). The metadata that sits behind social media\ncontent is also widely mined, and considered by some\nto be more valuable than the content itself. Such meta-\ndata includes: who is speaking and sharing, where they\nare located, to whom they are linked, how influential\nand active they are, what their previous activity pat-\nterns look like and what this suggests about their\nlikely preferences and future activities. Social media\ndata mining is undertaken by the major platforms\nthemselves (like Facebook and Twitter), by intermedi-\nary commercial companies (such as Sysomos, Radian6,\nBrandwatch), or with tools which are free to all comers;\nsome easy-to-use (for example Social Mention), and\nothers more complex (such as NodeXL).\nMethods for analysing social media data promise\npowerful new ways of knowing publics and\ncapturing what they say and do. And yet access to\nthese methods is uneven, with large corporations and\ngovernments tending to have the best access to data\nand analytics tools. Critics warn of a number of\n1Department of Sociological Studies, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK\n2School of Media and Communication, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK\nCorresponding author:\nHelen Kennedy, Department of Sociological Studies, University of\nSheffield, Sheffield S103TN, UK.\nEmail: h.kennedy@sheffield.ac.uk\nBig Data & Society\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License (http://\nwww.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-\nat-sage).\ntroubling consequences for publics that result from the\nrise and spread of data mining: less privacy, more sur-\nveillance and social discrimination, and a new means of\ncontrolling how publics come to be represented and so\nunderstood. Meanwhile, the tools and systems that gen-\nerate knowledge from social media data are typically\nopaque and are rarely open to public scrutiny and\nsupervision. We argue that these various enactments\nand characteristics of data mining are constitutive of\na new form of data power.\nIn the light of data power, this article considers\nwhether a more positive relationship between social\nmedia data mining and public life might be established,\none in which publics can be said to have greater agency\nand reflexivity. We argue that, in order for this to\nhappen, there is a need to democratise data power in\nthree main ways. First, to address concerns about the\npotential negative effects of data mining on the public,\nit needs to be subject to greater public supervision and\nregulation. Secondly, to address the danger of new,\ndata-driven digital divides emerging, the technologies\nof data mining (which include software and expertise\nas well as data themselves) must be available and\naccessible to the public so they can be used in varied\nways. Thirdly, given the contribution that data mining\nincreasingly makes to how publics and public issues are\nrepresented, data mining could be used in ways that\nenable members of the public to understand each\nother, reflect on matters of shared concern, and\ndecide how to act collectively as publics, thereby allow-\ning publics to constitute themselves as more reflexive\nand active agents.\nTogether, these three ways of democratising data\nmining (subjecting it to greater public supervision and\ncontrol, ensuring it is available and accessible to the\npublic to use, and using it in a way that enables the\nproduction of more reflexive and active publics) address\nconcerns expressed about data mining and point us\ntowards ways in which more knowing publics (rather\nthan just known publics) might surface through data\nmining. They may, therefore, produce conditions in\nwhich the public can act with greater agency in relation\nhas defined this term: `not brute acts (of clicking on this\nbutton, pressing like to this post)' but rather `the longer\nprocesses of action based on reflection, giving an\naccount of what one has done, even more basically,\nmaking sense of the world so as to act within it'.\nBaack (2015) argues that thinking about agency is fun-\ndamental to challenging the structures of data power\nand yet questions about agency have been `obscured by\nunnecessarily generalised readings' (Couldry and\nPowell, 2014: 1) of the supposed power of technological\nassemblages like data mining. For this reason, Couldry\nand Powell (and others) call for more attention to\nagency than theories of algorithmic power, or data\npower, have thus far made possible. This paper repre-\nsents one such endeavour.\nOur paper is an imagining of the conditions that are\nrequired to democratise data mining, grounded in\nexamples of the three strategies we discuss. As such,\nour approach is normative, and is in line with those\ngrounded critical theories that seek both to analyse\nproblems with current social practices and articulate\nwhat might be valuable about them (Young, 2002:\n11\u00ad12). We are aware that despite growing calls to\nthink about and do data mining differently, efforts to\ndemocratise data mining are far from being realised in\npractice. Nonetheless, we feel it is important to do\nthe work of imagining what could be with regard to\nthe relationship between data mining and publics.\nGiven that, as van Dijck and Poell (2013) assert, all\nkinds of actors (in education, health, politics, arts,\nentertainment, policing, activism) are increasingly\nrequired to act within what they define as `social\nmedia logic' (which includes social media data\nmining), imagining how such practices might be more\ndemocratic seems like a vital undertaking. In doing this,\nwe revisit the question that Andrew Feenberg asked in\nhis preface to Transforming Technology: `must human\nbeings submit to the harsh logic of machinery, or can\ntechnology be fundamentally redesigned to better serve\nAlthough more and more data are mined from an\never broader range of sources, we focus on social\nmedia data mining here for three reasons. First, because\na wide range of public actors are technically able to\nengage in it, as the open APIs (Application\nProgramme Interfaces) of social media platforms\nmake it possible for non-corporate actors to analyse at\nleast some public social media data. Second, while social\nmedia have been viewed as sites of `interactivity' among\npublics, social media data mining is categorically not\ninteractive: it takes data from social media and analyses\nthem, and publics are not able to intervene or interact in\nthis process. For this reason, the politics of social media\ndata mining need critical attention. Third, social media\nhave been viewed as crucial sites where publics emerge.\nDescribed first as `networked publics' assembling in and\nstructured by social media platforms (Boyd, 2010) and\nthen as algorithmically generated `calculated publics'\n(Gillespie, 2014), in this paper we consider whether it\nis possible for the publics that take shape through data\nmining to be characterised by agency and so be under-\nstood as neither known nor calculated publics, but\nrather as knowing publics. We proceed to elaborate on\nsome of the main criticisms that have been levelled at\nsocial media data mining's production of known pub-\nlics, in order then to consider the conditions under\nwhich more knowing publics might emerge.\n2 Big Data & Society\nKnown publics\nThe analysis of social media data is seen as a powerful\nnew way of knowing publics and capturing what they\nsay and do. But social media data mining and analytics\ntend to be dominated by corporate and government\nelites, who generally have the best access to data and\nanalytics tools. Critics warn of a number of problems\nfor the public that may stem from the growing data\npower of these groups: it is likely to result in less priv-\nacy and more surveillance, increased social discrimin-\nation and `deep personalisation' (Couldry and Turow,\ncontrol over how networked publics come to be repre-\nsented and understood.\nThe most common concern that arises from corpor-\nate and governmental uses of social media data mining\nto know publics is that it results in less privacy and\nmore surveillance. In 2010, Facebook CEO Mark\nZuckerberg announced that in the age of social\nmedia, privacy is no longer `a social norm' (Johnson,\n2010). At the same time, a number of commentators\nhave contested this view, such as Boyd (2014), whose\nextensive ethnographic research into teen social media\nattitudes leads her to argue that privacy still matters to\nyoung people. Contrary to Zuckerberg's assertion,\nprivacy still is a social norm, she and others claim.\nOf course, it is in the interests of social media compa-\nnies who make money by selling the content that users\nshare on social media platforms to tell us that we no\nlonger care about privacy \u00ad indeed, such strategies play\na role in shaping how we think. Yet despite the efforts\nof Zuckerberg and others to dismiss the significance of\nprivacy in social media environments, the concept\nretains traction. Examples of the invasion of social\nmedia privacy by corporations are greeted by public\nconcern, and academic researchers seek to understand\nwhat they call the `privacy paradox', or the fact that\nsocial media users' sharing practices appear to contra-\ndict their expressed privacy concerns. Some authors\nconclude that for users, there is a distinction between\nsocial privacy (controlling which people within\ntheir networks get access to their information) and\ninstitutional privacy (the mining of personal informa-\ntion by social media platforms and other commercial\ncompanies) (Raynes-Goldie, 2010; Young and\nAlongside concerns about personal privacy invasion,\nsocial media data mining is seen as having increased\nsurveillance. Trottier (2012) argues that social media\ndata mining opens up access to aspects of life once\nintimate and guarded and, as such, is a new form of\nsurveillance (see also Fuchs, 2014). Andrejevic provides\na convincing array of examples to argue that there are\nvarious ways in which our actions are subjected to\nsurveillant scrutiny, including forms of social media\ndata mining like sentiment analysis and opinion\nmining, but also other activities like body language\nanalysis, neuromarketing and drone technology\n(2013). Social media platforms like Facebook are ide-\nally situated for ubiquitous surveillance, he argues with\nGates (Andrejevic and Gates, 2014), as they have the\ninfrastructure in place that makes it possible for them\nto serve as surveillance systems. In a recent online list of\nthe 10 largest databases in the world, a number of social\nmedia platforms figure (Anonyzious, 2012, cited in\ngovernmental uses of social media data mining can be\nseen as contemporary forms of surveillance, and plat-\nforms are simultaneously actors in surveillant practices,\ninfrastructures that enable surveillance, and databases\nwhich house the datasets that are surveilled.\nWith all of this mined data comes the possibility of\ndiscriminating amongst members of the public, and a\nnumber of scholars have pointed to the various\ndomains in which this discrimination is taking place.\nTurow (2012) highlights how the digital advertising\nindustries use data to discriminate as, through data ana-\nlytics processes, `individual profiles' are turned into\n`individual evaluations' (p. 6). Based on behavioural\nand other forms of tracking, individuals' marketing\nvalue is calculated and each individual is categorised\nas target or waste. Like Turow, others have highlighted\nhow the discriminatory potential of data mining is cap-\ntured in the interests of capital. Hearn (2010) argues\nthat data mining's ability to identify valuable senti-\nments monetises feeling and intimacy and represents\nyet another capitalist mechanism of value extraction,\nand Andrejevic (2011) writes about the role sentiment\nanalysis plays in the prediction and control of affect.\nElsewhere, Beer and Burrows (2013) point to the ways\nin which data-based discrimination operates in the pro-\nduction of culture. Writing about music consumption\ntechnologies and their generation of archivable data\nabout listening habits, they suggest that such data do\nnot only constitute listening practices, but also `feed\ninto the production of large-scale national geodemo-\ngraphic systems that in turn provide postcode-level ana-\nsuch, data constitutes much more than culture, serving\nalso to shape regimes of governance and control (see\nElsewhere, commentators have raised concerns\nabout the democratic implications of the `deep person-\nalisation' that result from the discriminatory practices\nthat the resulting `filter bubble' of media content tai-\nlored to individuals is a `centrifugal force' that separ-\nates members of the public from one other and weakens\nKennedy and Moss 3\ndescribe how personalisation might shape the content\nmedia organisations produce, as they adapt news\nand other content based on the knowledge they have\nabout audiences. Deep personalisation of media, they\nargue, threatens to undermine the `shared reference\npoints' necessary for democracy and which `enable us\nto recognize one another as members of a common\nsocial and political space' (Couldry and Turow, 2014:\nAt the same time, some commentators have argued\nthat data-mining techniques are used by dominant\ngroups as a powerful new way of controlling how pub-\nlics are represented and so understood. In this respect,\nif personalisation is a centrifugal force (Pariser, 2011:\n24), data mining can act as a centripetal force in repre-\nsenting what broader publics are saying and doing.\nWhile much knowledge generated through social\nmedia data is not shared with the public, representa-\ntions of the public based on social media data now\ncirculate in the public sphere and shape how publics\nare viewed and how they see themselves (Anstead and\ngeneral election in 2010, Anstead and O'Loughlin\ntool to understand and illustrate public opinion is start-\ning to enter into mainstream media discourse', through\n`more complex semantic polling techniques' as well as\n`electronic vox pops and commentary on trending\ntopics'. The public, they argue, `reflect on' `interpret\nand talk about these forms of public opinion in their\nSimilarly, Gillespie (2014) discusses how representa-\ntions of the public generated through data \u00ad what he\nterms `calculated publics' \u00ad are becoming increasingly\nprominent ways of thinking about publics. He gives the\nexample of Twitter's Trends algorithm, which claims to\nrepresent what different geographical publics are dis-\ncussing on Twitter at particular moments in time\nresentations matter because they play a role in shaping\nand constituting what we take publics to be. He therefore\nurges us to ask, `how do these technologies, now not just\ntechnologies of evaluation but of representation, help to\nconstitute and codify the publics they claim to measure,\npublics that would not otherwise exist except that the\npublics generated through data are contestable: they do\nnot simply mirror publics `out there', but rather are con-\nstructed in particular and partial ways. Given this,\n`friction between the ``networked publics'' forged by users\nand the ``calculated publics'' offered by algorithms'.\nWe argue below that the representational work data\nmining can perform in representing broader publics \u00ad\nespecially in view of the personalisation and fragmen-\ntation of digital spaces \u00ad could be a valuable resource in\nproviding `shared reference points' that Couldry and\nTurow (2014) argue are crucial for democracy.\nThe important question is to what extent data mining\nis used to promote public reflection, understanding and\ndebate, and whether the representations it generates are\neach public medium (now algorithms, previously, for\nexample, newspapers), we `turn over the provision of\nknowledge to others' and so are `left vulnerable to their\nchoices, methods and subjectivities'. Sometimes this can\nbe positive, he argues, as it provides us with knowledge\nfiltered through editorial expertise, as in the case of\nnewspapers. But sometimes it is not, because filtering\nand selection procedures are unavailable to us, or\nbecause they have undesirable social and political con-\nsequences. Algorithms are `socially constructed and\ninstitutionally managed mechanisms for assuring\npublic acumen: a new knowledge logic', he writes\ncalculated publics are generated are typically unknown\nand not clearly explained (Gillespie, 2014).\nThe concentration of data power in elite hands and\nthe related unequal access to data and analytics tools\ncan make it difficult for publics to contest or challenge\nthe ways in which data mining plays a role in represent-\ning publics. Indeed, another concern expressed in rela-\ntion to the rise of data mining, one of Boyd and\nCrawford's (2012) six `provocations for Big Data,' is\nthat limited access to Big Data is creating new digital\ndivides. Boyd and Crawford (2012) point out that while\nmuch of the enthusiasm surrounding Big Data comes\nfrom a belief that they are easy and straightforward to\naccess, this is categorically not the case. So our state-\nment in the introduction, that it is technically possible\nfor a range of actors to engage in social media data\nmining because of platforms' open APIs, requires the\nimportant caveat that there are a number of challenges\nto realising this possibility. At present, elite commercial\ncompanies like Google, Facebook and Amazon have\nthe best access to data, as well as the best tools and\nmethods to make sense of it (Williamson, 2014). Some\ncompanies restrict access to data entirely, others sell\naccess for a high fee, some offer small data sets to uni-\nversity-based researchers. Thus those with money or\ninside a company have differential access to social\nmedia data from those without financial resources or\noperating outside the major companies.\nThese data inequalities relate not only to data and\nanalytics tools, but also to the expertise needed to use\nand make sense of them. Manovich states that there are\nthree ways of relating to Big Data: there are `those who\ncreate data (both consciously and by leaving digital\nfootprints), those who have the means to collect it,\n4 Big Data & Society\nBoyd and Crawford (2012) also point out that who is\ndeemed to have expertise determines both who controls\ndata-mining processes and the `knowledge' about\npublics that results, knowledge which in turn produces\npublics, as we suggest above. `Wrangling APIs, scrap-\ning, and analyzing big swathes of data is a skill set\ngenerally restricted to those with a computational back-\nmining expertise, as well as to data themselves, is\nuneven, and this produces new digital divides in rela-\ntion to access to data, tools, skills and expertise (Boyd\nThe criticisms of social media data mining outlined\nin this section point to problems with current dominant\nuses of data mining. Critics argue that the imperative of\ngovernment and corporate elites to know publics in\nparticular ways through social media and other forms\nof data mining leads to the erosion of personal privacy\nand a parallel growth in practices of surveillance,\ndiscrimination and elite control over the ways in\nwhich publics are represented and known. These are\nall valid concerns, but they leave us with the question\nof whether it has to be so, or whether data mining may\nbe reimagined in ways that allow it to contribute more\npositively to public life. In the next section, we describe\nalternative ways of thinking and doing data mining that\nseek to democratise data power and which suggest that\na different relationship between the public and data\nmining may be possible. Our intervention, then, is to\nsuggest ways of moving beyond critique. We character-\nise the battle over data power as being about a move\nfrom `known publics', who are subject to the data-\nmining practices of powerful groups, to `knowing pub-\nlics', who are more active and reflexive agents.\nKnowing publics\nWe have described how data mining is used by corpor-\nations and governments to know publics and how these\npractices raise concerns about privacy, surveillance,\nsocial discrimination and control over how publics\nare represented and understood. These problems are\nexacerbated by the emergence of new digital divides\nand inequalities around data. The critiques of data\nmining we have discussed above do the important\njob of highlighting some of the troubling consequences\nof current forms of social media data mining. However,\nthey only take us so far: they do not tell us whether\nalternative data practices and arrangements are pos-\nsible and, if so, what they should look like. In this sec-\ntion, we take critiques of data mining as a starting point\nand ask: `given these problems, what then?' Looking\ntowards alternative ways of thinking about and doing\ndata mining that are emerging, we consider how data\nmining may be reimagined in ways that allow it to\ncontribute more positively to public life.\nFollowing the concerns expressed about social media\ndata mining, there have been growing calls to think\nabout and do data mining differently and so to democ-\nratise data. We highlight three main aspects to this pol-\nitics of data mining, all of which seek to increase the\npower of the public vis-a\n` -vis current data-mining\nregimes:\n1. Data-mining practices should be subject to greater\npublic supervision and regulation.\n2. Data mining (data, tools, and expertise) should be\naccessible for all to use.\n3. Data-mining practices should be used in ways that\nhelp to make more reflexive and active publics.\nThe first two of these are already the subject of wide-\nspread discussion, but the third is less widely discussed\nin relation to data mining and analytics. Our contribu-\ntion to this debate is to argue that all of these three\nways of democratising data mining are necessary to\naddress the problems of data power, because together,\nthey provide the means by which publics may be\nempowered through data. Of course, these are not\nstraightforward solutions and are far from being imple-\nmented in practice, but identifying and outlining them\nis a necessary part of our project of imagining alterna-\ntive and more democratic forms of social media data\nmining.\nPerhaps the most widely discussed way in which the\npublic can have more control over data mining is by\nmaking data-mining practices more transparent.\nConcerns about the negative social consequences of\ndata mining in terms of privacy, surveillance, social\ndiscrimination, personalisation and control over how\nthe public are represented and exacerbated by the\nblack-boxing of data-mining processes: it is difficult to\nevaluate data-mining practices because code, algo-\nrithms and methodologies are often proprietary and\nwe do not always know how they work. Gillespie\n(2014) highlights this problem when he talks about\nthe opacity of Twitter's Trend algorithm and digital\nreputation measurement platforms like Klout. Given\nthis, commentators argue that data-mining techniques\nneed to be more transparent (Anstead and O'Loughlin,\nposition argue that making data-mining algorithms\nand processes public in this way would help to facilitate\npublic understanding, scrutiny and debate about the\npolitical effects of data mining, and allow the public\nand groups acting on the public's behalf to examine\nand contest data-mining practices.\nSome efforts to communicate transparently about\ndata-mining practice are starting to emerge, although\nKennedy and Moss 5\nnot necessarily on the major social media platforms.\nThe UK broadcaster Channel 4 attempted to commu-\nnicate its uses of viewer data to viewers through the\nproduction of a video featuring one of its comic talents,\nAlan Carr, in which the comedian describes which data\nthe broadcaster asks its viewers to share voluntarily, the\nuses to which they are put, and the benefits to viewers\n(http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/). Similarly, the\ndating website OK Cupid attempted to explain its algo-\nrithmic matching processes in an animated video called\n`the math of online dating' (https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=m9PiPlRuy6E) and the site also regularly\nunpacks the platform's own data on its blog (http://\nblog.okcupid.com/).\nHowever, some commentators argue that making\ndata mining transparent is not enough. Requiring com-\npanies to show their algorithms does not mean they will\nor are required to revise problematic practices, nor does\nit necessarily lead to greater public understanding, given\nthe levels of expertise required to make sense of the tech-\nnical operations of data-mining processes. What is\nneeded, then, is not transparency, but accountability,\ntowards addressing the problems of data mining's opa-\ncity and black-boxing, but it still `fails to address\naccountability and reflexivity'. In other words, transpar-\nent companies are not necessarily accountable. Here,\naccountability might be understood in the terms in\nable'' for one's activities is both to explicate the reasons\nfor them and supply normative grounds whereby they\ncan be ``justified'''. Drawing on Giddens' definition,\nity as the entire process (within a communication rela-\ntionship) of making claims based on expectations and\nappeals to norms, the response of the other party (reject-\ning claims or explaining actions), and any ensuing pro-\ncedures for reconciling the two'. In the context of\ndemocratising data mining, accountability would there-\nfore mean requiring data-mining companies not just to\nshow the public what they are doing, but to tell publics\nwhat they are doing, why, and with what effect. Such\naccountability makes it possible to audit firms in a way\nthat transparency does not, and it is for these reasons\nthat proponents cited here argue for `algorithmic\naccountability' rather than transparency.\nOther commentators stress the need to regulate the\nuses to which data mining is put in order to prevent\nSelf regulation by private companies is not likely to be\nsufficient. To secure the public interest, as Freedman\n(2012) argues in relation to the Internet and the\nmedia industries more generally, regulation requires\nthe intervention of public authorities. But any govern-\nment regulation of data mining must itself be demo-\ncratic and accountable to the public, not least because\nof the use of data mining and analytics by governments\nthemselves. Government regulation imposed from the\ntop down, without input from the public, would not\nguarantee that it serves the public and addresses\npublic concerns. The public needs to be involved in\ndetermining how data mining will be regulated, if regu-\nlation is to be legitimate and enjoy public support.\nExamples which try to enact this proposal on a small\nscale include the EU's Hack4Participation initiatives:\nthese hackathons explore how to get EU citizens\nmore involved in EU policy-making and how to\nenable the better analysis of policy-making processes,\nand they sometimes result in the development of\ndata-related policy. For example, policy relating to\nNet Neutrality was developed at a German policy\nhackathon and the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative\noperates in this way, adopting a strategy not of lobby-\ning but of writing media policies which are relevant to\nthe current digital age (for example in relation to priv-\nThe second way to democratise data mining relates\nto public access. Given concerns about the emergence\nof a new digital divide around data, some commenta-\ntors argue that if data mining is to serve the objectives\nof the public, it needs to be accessible to the public, not\njust major corporations, governments and security\nagencies. One proposed solution to problems of\naccess which is relevant to our focus here is open\ndata. According to Bates (2013), open initiatives like\nOpen Government Data, Open Access and Free and\nOpen-Source Software can be understood as efforts to\nreverse the trend towards the private ownership of and\ndifferential access to data that results in the kinds of\nknown publics discussed above. Open data groups\nlobby for access to and the ability to re-use datasets,\noften focusing on those produced by public institutions.\nThey insist on access and re-use for everyone, `free of\ncharge, and without discrimination' (Bates, 2013: np).\nSuch groups see the opening up of public datasets as a\nform of democratisation of data, allowing the access to\ndata that Boyd and Crawford argue is ominously\nabsent from the data delirium (van Zoonen, 2014).\nBut returning to the arguments of Manovich and\nBoyd and Crawford, open data advocate Rae (2014)\nargues that although the release of open datasets can\nbe for the public good, it needs to be accompanied by\nskilled analysis and, importantly, by the right answers\nto these three questions: opened by whom, open to\nwhom, and open to what? Open access to data is only\none step in overcoming the danger of data-driven\n6 Big Data & Society\ndigital divides and in making data more accessible to\npublics. Alone, it is not an unproblematic solution to\nthe problems of data mining discussed above. Indeed,\nas Bates and others (for example Gurstein, 2011) point\nout, there are many ways in which open data may\nserve to empower the technologically-elite and\nalready-empowered \u00ad Bates' own study into open gov-\nernment data confirmed that governments usually\nrelease open data under conditions that allow them to\ncontrol information flows.\nIt should be noted that these discussions are about\nthe democratisation of access to data produced by\npublic institutions, not to data mining, nor to social\nmedia data. Couldry and others addressed the issue of\nmaking data mining and analytics public \u00ad or social, in\ntheir terms \u00ad on a project called Storycircle (http://\nstorycircle.co.uk/), which aimed to develop understand-\ning of how digital resources can support individual and\ngroup agency in a specific social context (Couldry,\n2014). One such resource is analytics. Couldry and col-\nlaborators developed the notion of `social analytics' to\ndescribe their research into social actors' uses of ana-\nlytics, what Couldry describes as `alternative projects of\nself-knowledge, group knowledge, institutional know-\nledge \u00ad whose ends are not the tracking of data for its\nown sake, or even for profit, but for broader social,\nsee also http://storycircle.co.uk/resources/social-analy-\ntics/). Social organisations' uses of analytics for these\n`social, civic, cultural or political' purposes might be\nseen as a concrete example of the democratisation not\njust of data but of data mining.\nEfforts to make social data open in the same ways as\nother types of data raise issues of ethics and personal\nprivacy, discussed above, something which again\nunderscores the need for public debate about and regu-\nlation of data mining. As Baack (2015) points out, open\ndata advocates believe that personal data (that is, data\nwhich allows persons to be identified) should not be\nmade open in the same way as other data.\nNonetheless, some researchers have experimented with\nopening up social media data, such as Pybus et al.\n(forthcoming), who discuss their project `Our Data,\nOurselves' in this special issue. This project aimed to\nconfront questions of agency in relation to social media\ndata, given what the researchers saw as asymmetrical\npower relationships with regard to who gets to own the\nsocial data that we are all active in producing, and to\nexplore how gaining access to one's own social data\nmight augment agency. Aware that accessibility issues\nrelate not just to data but also to software and the\ntechnical skills and expertise required to analyse data\n(see also Boyd and Crawford, 2012, discussed above),\nthey worked with already-skilled young coders to create\napps to intervene in social data produced and mined on\nmobile phones. Examples of apps created by the young\ncoders include one designed to highlight the frequency of\ndata tracking through audio alerts and another which\nproduced graphs demonstrating the relationship between\nsocial media platform usage and frequency of data\nmining. At the time of writing, the project is only\nrecently finished, so the results and findings have not\nyet been widely shared, but it nonetheless represents a\nconcrete example of how social media data and their\nmining might be made more accessible to publics.\nThe third way in which data mining might be demo-\ncratised relates to the types of publics it produces and\nthe implications this has for the quality of the public\nAs noted earlier, the representations of publics gener-\nated through data mining circulate in the public sphere\nand constitute publics by shaping how publics come to\nbe viewed and understood (Anstead and O'Loughlin,\nseveral democratic and media theorists have noted how\n`the public' and `public opinion' are not things that can\nbe known without various technologies and practices of\nrepresentation that make them present (Barnett, 2008;\npublic'' thinks, feels, and favours, and when they do\nso, they tend to have recourse to the results of elections,\nor statistical surveys, or opinion polls. These technical\nmediums are the ways in which the voice of the public is\noften expressed'.\nHowever, while publics depend upon various forms\nof representation, not all ways of representing publics\nare equal and the implications different representations\nhave for the quality of the public sphere vary signifi-\ncantly. In his account of `the mediapolis', Silverstone\nas well as include and stifle as well as promote public\nunderstanding and debate. Yet, he argues that good\nmedia are a crucial source of public reflexivity.\nMedia, he writes, `are not only the locus of reflexivity\nin this, the late modern world, but they are one of its\nkey stimuli, and they themselves, at best, provide the\nmaterials for that reflection and criticism' (Silverstone,\nties of judgement and imagination, and the capacity of\nthe mediapolis to provide, and enable, the resources for\nthe exercise of both in the pursuit of more effective\nunderstanding and participation in the world'\nData mining and analytics (and the representations\nand visualisations of publics they generate) could pro-\nvide an invaluable cognitive resource for members of\nKennedy and Moss 7\nthe public to understand each other, reflect on matters\nof shared concern, and to decide how to act together as\npublics. In this way, data mining and analytics could\nhelp to provide `shared references points' for publics\nthat cut across the data-driven personalisation of digi-\ntal space (Couldry and Turow, 2014). However, data\nmining is more often viewed as a way of generating\nknowledge about publics rather than for or with pub-\nlics. To date, most attention has been focused on how\ndata mining can capture what publics say and do,\nrather than how \u00ad as part of `the mediapolis'\n(Silverstone, 2007) or public sphere \u00ad it can help mem-\nbers of the public to understand public issues and each\nother better, such that more informed and knowing\npublics may take shape. But there are some exceptions.\nWe point below to examples where data mining has\nbeen used to promote public understanding and\ndebate in ways that might enable the creation of more\nactive and knowing publics.\nGood data journalism uses data mining (and,\nrelatedly, data visualisation) to promote public under-\nstanding of public issues. One example is the work done\nby The Guardian newspaper, in collaboration with\nacademic researchers, on the Reading the Riots project,\nwhich analysed data about the riots that took place in\naimed to identify why looting took place, in response to\nthe absence of a government enquiry into the causes of\nthe riots. Combining data about the location of riots\nwith deprivation data allowed the project team to ques-\ntion the dominant narrative which asserted that there\nwas no link between the riots and poverty. A parallel\nanalysis of the role social media played in the riots\nfound that Twitter was not used to organise people to\ngo looting, as was widely reported, but rather to\nrespond to the riots: #riotcleanup, used to mobilise\npeople to clean up the streets after the riots, was one\nof the most popular hashtags during the period (Vis,\n2012). In this example, sharing mined social media data\nwith the public and presenting alternative representa-\ntions to those that dominated debate could be seen as\nan effort to increase publics' understandings of them-\nselves as publics, and so to facilitate greater reflexivity\namong publics.\nThe analytics practices undertaken by social actors\non the Storycircle project, discussed above, might also\nbe seen as efforts to produce reflective and therefore\nknowing publics, in that data mining for `social, civic,\ncultural or political goals' might mean that social\ngroups come to know themselves in more reflexive\nways. Other social researchers have also reflected on\nhow digital methods like social media data mining\nmay be used to involve publics in the process of know-\nledge construction. This possibility leads Marres\nestablished divisions of labour in social research'. She\nwrites that:\nAs online social research forces us to acknowledge the\ncontributions of digital devices, practices and subjects,\nto the enactment of social research, it can be taken as\nan invitation to move beyond ``proprietary'' concepts\nof methods, that is, beyond the entrenched use of\nmethod as a way to monopolise the representation of\na given field or aspect of social reality. (Marres, 2012:\nLikewise, Housley et al. (2014: 4) have argued that\ndigital methods provide social researchers with new ways\nof collaborating with publics, making both a `public soci-\nology' and `citizen social science' possible. Collaborative\nOnline Social Media Observatory (COSMOS), an aca-\ndemic project undertaken by these authors, aims to oper-\nate as a `collaboratory' where publics and researchers aim\nto produce knowledge together. As Housley et al. (2014:\n12) describe it, the project's aim `is to develop the\nCOSMOS platform as a ``collaboratory'', an element of\nparticipatory research infrastructure supporting public\nengagement in a range of activities that includes the\nexchange of ideas, debates about the shape of institutions,\ncurrent social problems, opportunities and events, as well\nastheco-productionofsocialscientificknowledgethrough\ncitizen social science, where publics act as vital sensors and\ninterpreters of social life'.\nThese examples highlight embryonic practices which\nseek to use data mining in a way that contributes more\npositively to `the mediapolis' (Silverstone, 2007). We\nsible `friction between ``networked publics'' forged by\nusers and the ``calculated publics'' offered by algo-\nrithms'. But if data mining is used to enable the cre-\nation of more reflexive and active publics in these ways,\nthe relationship between `networked publics' and `cal-\nculated publics' may be understood in more productive\nterms, in so far as knowledge generated through data\nmining is drawn upon by `networked publics' in order\nto understand themselves, each other and public issues.\nrepresentations of ``the public'' the public can come\ninto existence as a real actor'. Understood this way,\ndata mining and analytics are not only mechanisms\nfor knowing publics, but can be means by which publics\ncan know themselves.\nConclusion: Social media data mining\nand public agency\nIn this paper, we have considered possible responses to\nsome of the mains criticisms that have been levelled at\ncontemporary forms of data mining. In doing so, we\n8 Big Data & Society\nhave attempted to move beyond critique by considering\nwhether a better relationship between social media data\nmining and public life might be possible and what alter-\nnative arrangements in relation to social media data\nmining might look like. We have argued that this\nrequires a move from `known publics', who are subject\nto the data-mining practices of others, to `knowing\npublics', who are positioned in relation to data as\nmore active and reflexive agents.\nConcerns about data mining (in terms of increased\nsurveillance and privacy invasion, related opaque forms\nof discrimination, social sorting and control over the\nway the public is represented) are now being followed\nby calls to do data mining differently and democratise\ndata power. We have argued that there are three main\nways in which this might be done. Firstly, we noted that\ncommentators call for data mining to be transparent\nand open to public supervision and to be regulated by\npublic authorities. Greater transparency and account-\nability of data mining are proposed as mechanisms to\nfacilitate public understanding, debate and action in\nrelation to data mining. Similarly, to address concerns\nabout access to data practices, technologies and expert-\nise, there have been calls for data and data mining to be\nmore accessible and available as a common public\ngood. Open data movements offer one (albeit not\nstraightforward) example of this principle in action,\nbut as yet, considerations of how it might apply to\ndata mining and to social media data are somewhat\nlimited. Finally, we suggested building on the notion\nthat publics exist, in part, through the way they are\nrepresented, in order to consider whether data-mining\npractices can be used by publics to constitute them-\nselves as more active and reflexive agents. Through\nthese moves, it may be possible for data mining not\nonly to be used by elites to produce known publics,\nbut rather for the public to be more knowing of itself\nand to participate in the active production of itself, the\npublic.\nBy reflecting on these issues, we have returned to the\nissue of agency, central to so many studies which have\nsought to explore how cultures and societies are made,\nand how they might be made fairer and more equal. In\ndebates about which has primacy, structures or agency,\nstructuralist critics would argue that structures not only\ndetermine, but serve to oppress and restrict the agency\nof already-disadvantaged groups in society. Some of\nthe critics discussed in our paper fall into this category.\nIn contrast, others have stressed the capacity of human\nagents to make and shape their worlds, albeit in the\ncontext of constraining structures. Others still have\nhighlighted the dialectical relationship between struc-\nture and agency: structures shape and constrain\nhuman agency, but human agents act against, as well\nas within, them. We share this view. Cultural critic\nJeremy Gilbert advocates such a position, a perspective\nwhich, he says, acknowledges `the potency of both of\nthese modes of analysis and the fact that they can both\nbe true simultaneously'. In fact, he goes on to argue, `I\nwant to insist that we can't understand how capitalist\nculture works without understanding that they are both\ntrue' (Gilbert, 2012). It is within this ever-present, dia-\nlectic tension between structure and agency that this\ndefinition of agency as `the longer processes of action\nbased on reflection, giving an account of what one has\ndone, even more basically, making sense of the world so\nas to act within it', we maintain that greater public\nagency in relation to data mining might be possible,\nunder the conditions discussed in the second half of\nthis paper. However far away we might currently be\nfrom realising these imaginings, it is certainly worth\nhaving them in sight.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of\ninterest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or pub-\nlication of this article: All authors have agreed to the submis-\nsion of this article to Big Data and Society.
