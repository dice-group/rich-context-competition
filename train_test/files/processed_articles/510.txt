Weden, Rand Corporation, 1776 Main Street, Santa Monica, CA 90401-3208 (e-mail: mweden@rand.org).\nParental reporting of height and weight was evaluated for US children aged 2\u00ad13 years. The prevalence of\nobesity (defined as a body mass index value (calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2) in the 95th percentile or\nhigher) and its height and weight components were compared in child supplements of 2 nationally representative\nthe 1997 Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID-CDS). Sociodemo-\ngraphic differences in parent reporting error were analyzed. Error was largest for children aged 2\u00ad5 years. Under-\nreporting of height, not overreporting of weight, generated a strong upward bias in obesity prevalence at those\nages. Frequencies of parent-reported heights below the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (Atlanta,\nof obesity decreased with children's age and reversed direction at ages 12\u00ad13 years. Underreporting of weight\nincreased with age, and underreporting of height decreased with age.

This possibility is recognized in\ntheCDCandWorldHealthOrganizationprotocolsforidentify-\ning \"biologically implausible\" values of height or weight (24).\nParental overreporting of extreme values of height or weight\nhas been attributed to digit preference, rounding, and failing\nto keep pace with children's rapid growth, especially at the\nyoungest ages (8). Parental underreporting of extreme values\nhas also been observed, with parents of heavy children under-\nreporting weight and parents of light children overreporting\ncan be interpreted either as simple regression to the mean (25)\nBecause increases in weight have driven the obesity epi-\ndemic, it is unsurprising that studies have tended to empha-\nsize misreporting of weight rather than height (30, 31). At\nleast equal attention to height misreporting, however, is\nmerited, because height errors are compounded by the squar-\ning of height in the denominator of BMI calculations (7, 8).\nIn this study, we examined error in parental reporting of chil-\ndren's heights and weights as sources of bias in nationally\nrepresentative survey estimates of childhood obesity in US\nchildren aged 2\u00ad13 years. Our analyses investigated misre-\nporting of extreme values of height and weight and identified\nsociodemographic differentials in misreporting.\nData\nThe Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of\nwith biennial assessments of height and weight for all chil-\ndren born to women followed in the National Longitudinal\ncomprises a nationally representative sample of men and\noversample of non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white\neconomically disadvantaged households.

Since 1968, the Panel Study of Income\nDynamics has followed a nationally representative sample\nof US households, including a low-income oversample. All\nnew households formed by children and other family mem-\nbers descended from the original 1968 households are fol-\nlowed, and an immigrant \"refresher\" subsample was added\nretention rates of 76% and 81%, respectively (34). The PSID-\nCDS was administered to primary caregivers of up to 2 ran-\ndomlyselected children aged 0\u00ad13 years from the Panel Study\nof Income Dynamics core and immigrant refresher samples\naged 2\u00ad13 years in the PSID-CDS; from these, we excluded\nobservations for which height and/or weight was not assessed\n(10%). Both the PSID-CDS and the NLSY79-Child analyti-\ncal samples were found to be statistically indistinguishable\nfromthetotalsampleswithoutexceptionsonthevariablesused\nin this study (Web Table 1 available at http://aje.oxfordjour\nnals.org/).\nAssessment of height and weight. In both the NLSY79-\nChild and the PSID-CDS, height was recorded in feet (1\nrecorded in pounds (1 pound = 0.45 kg) and ounces (1\nounce = 28 g). At each survey wave of the NLSY79-Child, a\ntrained interviewer or the mother measured each child's\nheight and weight unless the mother did not consent to either\nmeasurement or the interview was conducted by telephone, in\nwhich case height and/or weight was mother reported. Mea-\nsurements were taken in the child's own clothes, after remov-\ning shoes and coats, by using a portable scale and a tape\nmeasure. Survey data \"flags\" identify whether height and\nweight were parent reported or measured. Additionally, in the\ndren had both mother-reported and measured heights and\nweights in a given survey wave.\nIn the PSID-CDS, weight was reported in all cases by the\nprimary caregivers, 92% of whom were the biological mothers.\nAny primary caregiver who did not know the child's weight\nwas asked to provide an estimate and report when the child\nwas last weighed. Child height was measured by a trained\ninterviewer unless the interview was conducted by telephone,\nthe child was not present, or the primary caregiver did not\nconsent. Unfortunately, no flags are provided with the data to\ndistinguish parent-reported from measured heights or to dis-\ntinguish whether an interview was conducted in person or by\ntelephone. However, we were able to develop a proxy flag for\nwhether the child was a \"nonrespondent\" on the in-person\nchild assessment for children aged 3\u00ad12 years, thereby identi-\nfying children whose primary caregivers were interviewed by\ntelephone or who were otherwise not present for assessment;\nthus, these children could not have had interviewer-measured\nheights.\nSociodemographic assessment. In the NLSY79-Child\nand the PSID-CDS, each child's gender and age and the\nmother's age at the child's birth were reported or calculated\nfrom the month and year of birthdates and interviews. In the\nNLSY79-Child, race/ethnicity data came from the mother's\nNLSY79 report of the racial/ethnic origins (chosen from 30\ncategories) with which she most closely identified. Total fam-\nily income data in US dollars were constructed by the data\nproducer by using a series of questions in each NLSY79 wave.\nIn the PSID-CDS, children's races/ethnicities were reported\nby the primary caregivers (as white non-Hispanic, black non-\nHispanic, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, American Indian\nor Alaskan Native, or \"other\"). The data producer constructed\ntotal family income datafrom a series of questions and imputed\nitem nonresponse. We harmonized NLSY79-Child and PSID-\nCDS racial/ethnic origins by using US Census categories\nBecause of sample design differences between the NLSY79-\nChild (Table 1) and the PSID-CDS (Table 2), and because\nchildren in the surveys were not randomly selected into mea-\nsured versus parent-reported height and weight assessments,\nwe compared the sociodemographic characteristics of the chil-\ndren in each survey overall and by assessment protocol. The\nPSID-CDS was designed to be representative of US children\nto women residing in the United States at ages 14\u00ad21 years\nmeant that this sample had older mothers and higher family\nincomes than did our PSID-CDS sample and was less repre-\nsentative of Hispanic children (notably because of the exclu-\nsion of children born to mothers who immigrated after 1979).\nThese differences were still more pronounced for our 2006\nIn the NLSY79-Child, the measured and parent-reported\nsubsamples differed significantly on the mean age of the\nmother at the child's birth and on the distribution of the sub-\nsamples by race/ethnicity and family income.

The latter 2 socioeconomic characteristics\nare associated with lower rates of obesity (38\u00ad40). In the\nPSID-CDS, there were no statistically significant differences\nbetween the entirely parent-reported and measured height\nsubsamples on gender, mother's age, or family income. Sub-\njects in the parent-reported subsample, however, were more\nlikely to be Hispanic and less likely to be non-Hispanic black.\nHispanic and black races/ethnicities are associated with higher\nAnalyses\nChildren were categorized into percentiles of height-for-\nage, weight-for-age, and BMI-for-age on the basis of gender\nand age (in months) by using an SAS program (SAS Insti-\ntute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) from the CDC that uses the\nnumber of observations in the NLSY79-Child (n = 20) and\nthe PSID-CDS (n = 2) with BMI values outside the range of\nthis program. A BMI-for-age at or above the 95th percentile\nwas classified as \"obese\" (2). The panel surveys were divided\ninto age groups for which there was sufficient sample size to\ndistinguish between measured and parent-reported heights\nCDS (Table 3). Obesity prevalence was compared between\nrespective survey subsamples, and percentile-by-percentile\ncomparisons of children above or below each of the top or\nbottom 20 percentiles of weight-for-age and height-for-age\nwere conducted. For the subset of NLSY79-Child observa-\ntions with both measured and parent-reported heights and\nweights, mean differences between the measured and parent-\nreported data for a given assessment of BMI, height, and\nweight were calculated. Analyses were also conducted by strat-\nifying by gender, race/ethnicity, and family income. For these\nanalyses, observations with item nonresponse on the analyzed\ncharacteristic (Tables 1 and 2) were excluded.\nAll analyses used survey weights and adjusted for cluster-\ning of children in families in the NLSY79-Child and the\nPSID-CDS by using the survey (svy) prefix commands in\nStata, version 11, software (StataCorp LP, College Station,\nTexas). We report 95% confidence intervals for proportions\nand adjusted Pearson 2 statistics for tests of differences in\nproportions. Analyses were determined to be exempt from\nhuman subject review by the RAND Corporation's Human\nSubjects Protection Committee (Santa Monica, California).\nRESULTS\nObesity prevalence in the exclusively measured sample of\nreported weights and heights and nearly 2 times higher at\nwith measured weights and parent-reported heights. At ages\n6\u00ad13 years, there was a similar pattern of higher obesity prev-\nalence in the subsamples with parent-reported heights.\nHowever, additional age breakdowns that were possible for\nchildren in the NLSY79-Child with either exclusively mea-\nsured or exclusively parent-reported data showed that the\nobesity prevalence in the exclusively parent-reported sub-\nsample was significantly higher only at ages 6\u00ad8 years; there\nwere no significant differences in prevalence at ages 9\u00ad11\nyears, and prevalence was significantly lower at ages 12\u00ad13\nyears in the exclusively parent-reported subsample compared\nwith the exclusively measured subsample.\nFor children aged 2\u00ad5 years, a pattern of parents overre-\nporting weight and/or underreporting height could have pro-\nduced the higher rates of obesity observed in the reported\ncompared with the measured subsamples. To assess these\npossibilities, we compared the measured versus the parent-\nreported proportions in both studies of children who were in\nthe 20 highest percentiles of weight-for-age (Web Figure 1)\nand the 20 lowest percentiles of height-for-age (Web\nFigure 2).

Finally,\nthe 20 highest weight proportions were statistically indistin-\nguishable between measured and parent-reported weights in\nthe NLSY79-Child, differing at most by only 1.3% in the 99th\npercentile (Web Figure 1, Figure 2).\nTabulations of the percentage of children aged 2\u00ad5 years\nwith height below the first percentile by sociodemographic\ncharacteristics (Table 4) suggest that misreporting was espe-\ncially high for economically disadvantaged children. In both\nthe NLSY79-Child and the PSID-CDS, there was a statisti-\ncally significant association between family income and\nheight below the first percentile in the parent-reported subsam-\nples that was not observed in the respective measured subsam-\nples. In the parent-reported subsamples, height below the first\npercentile among children with family income below $25,000\nwas nearly 2\u00ad3 times more common than for children with\nfamily income of at least $75,000. Gender differences in height\nbelow the first percentile were mixed across the subsamples and\nsurveys and were never statistically significant. Differences\nby race/ethnicity were also mixed, with significant racial/\nethnic differences in height below the first percentile in both\nthe NLSY79-Child parent-reported and measured samples,\nbut only in the parent-reported sample of the PSID-CDS.\nWe next addressed the sample of children aged 12\u00ad13\nyears in the NLSY79-Child, in which rates of obesity were\nlower in the exclusively parent-reported subsample than the\nexclusively measured subsample.

Also, as observed in the full NLSY79-Child sample,\nthe prevalence of extremely low heights was significantly asso-\nciated with family income when using mother-reported heights\nbut not when using measured heights (Table 6). When using\nheights below the fifth percentile.\nConsistent with the results from the full NLSY79-Child\nboth parent-reported and measured weights and heights in\nthe same wave) showed fewer extremely high mother-\nreported weights than measured weights for children aged\n12\u00ad13 years.

For both weight and height, the patterns\nof sociodemographic differences in extreme values were\nsimilar, irrespective of whether the mother-reported or mea-\nsured data were used (results not shown).\nDISCUSSION\nPrevious studies that used nationally representative sam-\nples of US children with parent-reported weights and heights\nfound that obesity prevalence for children aged 2\u00ad3 years\nwas overestimated by a factor of 5\u00ad10 (7, 8) and that this bias\ndiminished rapidly with increasing age, reversing to under-\nestimating obesity prevalence after ages 12\u00ad13 years (7). Our\nfindings provide new empirical evidence supporting both of\nthese findings. On the basis of larger observed differences in\nmean height than in mean weight between the parent-reported\nversus the measured samples, both of these earlier studies\nspeculated that height underreporting rather than weight over-\nreporting accounted for the overestimation of obesity at young\nages (7, 8). Our study provides strong evidence supporting this\nspeculation. We found that implausibly large proportions of the\nparents of young children reported extremely low heights but\nnot extremely high weights. Not only is recall error regarding\nheight compounded by its being squared in the calculation\nparents are more likely to track children's weight than height\naccurately at these ages. In addition, our findings indicated\nthat underestimation of obesity prevalence from parental\nreporting on older children arose from their underreporting\nvery high weights. As in several of the preceding studies (7,\ning of height decreases with age, whereas the underreporting\nof weight increases with age. The greater underreporting of\nweight that we observed among parents of the heaviest older\nchildren has previously been attributed both to social desir-\nAs in the only previous nationally representative US study\nconsidering parental reporting bias and child gender (7), in\nTable 5.

Data were weighted by using survey sample weights, and\nconfidence interval estimates were adjusted for clustering of children in families.\nour study we observed no gender differences in height or\nweight misreporting for young children. Our null findings\nneither refuted nor supported previous findings that parents\nwere more likely to underreport girls' weights at older ages\n(7, 17, 18). We observed null and mixed findings on race/\nethnicity, as have other authors (7, 18). However, ours is the\nfirst study to provide evidence on parental reporting bias by\nfamily income for the full US child population from a\nnationally representative sample. We found that the lowest-\nincome parents of young children were consistently the most\nlikely to report extremely low child heights, whereas no con-\nsistent pattern by income emerged across our 2 surveys when\nchildren's heights were measured by survey staff. Our find-\nings on income extend those for Mexican-American children\nin the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in\nwhich underreporting of height was greater among economi-\ncally disadvantaged mothersthan among advantaged mothers\nof young children (13). We speculate that for low-income\nparents, reduced access to and utilization of health care (44\u00ad\n46), including child well-visits, in which height and weight\nare routinely assessed (46), may exacerbate parents' difficul-\nties keeping up with children's height gains.\nWe are less confident of the generalizability of our findings\nbeyond the United States. Most previous studies on parental\nreporting of child height and weight were conducted in\nstudies found greater misreporting of weight than height\n(15, 16). Moreover, error in reporting of height was nearly\nevenly balanced among accurate reporting (15, 16), overre-\nporting (14), and underreporting (17, 19). We speculate that\nthe use of the metric system in those countries may lead to\ndifferent types of recall error.\nSeveral limitations of our study warrant discussion. Our\ndata come from child supplements of 2 nationally represen-\ntative surveys of adults. However, only the PSID-CDS con-\nducted supplementary sampling of more recently arrived\nimmigrant families. This, and the overall older age of mothers\nin the NLSY79-Child, may explain why we saw racial/ethnic\ndifferences in the underreporting of young children's heights\nin the PSID-CDS but not in the NLSY79-Child. On the other\nhand, in the PSID-CDS and in the majority of the NLSY79-\nChild sample, children were not randomly selected by having\nparent-reported data or measured data. The consistency of our\nkey findings when using the PSID-CDS, the NLSY79-Child,\nChild (with both parent-reported and measured data in the same\nwave) strengthens our confidence about the conclusions of this\nstudy.\nOur results lead us to caution researchers especially against\nusing parent-reported data on height for very young children\nand to note that by approximately ages 9\u00ad11 years, parent-\nreported data become reasonably accurate. One practical\nsolution for child obesity researchers who have only parent-\nreported data available on young children is to consider ana-\nlyzing weight-for-age, which is generally accurately reported.\nTo survey data producers, we suggest that in cases in which\nchild measurement is practically or financially impossible,\nsurvey collection efforts should focus on improving the qual-\nityof height assessments more than that of weight assessments.\nFor example, 1 recent study (20) reported that the authors were\nTable 6.

Data were weighted by using survey sample weights,\nand confidence interval estimates and 2 statistics were adjusted for clustering of children in families.\nb Analyses excluded children with non-Hispanic \"other\" race/ethnicity because of insufficient sample sizes.\nc Family income was adjusted to year-2000 US dollars, and analyses excluded observations with item nonresponse on income.\nParent Reporting Error on Child Height and Weight 471\nable to substantially improve the accuracy of parent-reported\ndata by simply asking them to measure their children before\nscheduled telephone interviews.\n"
