    "reduced_content": "http://sgo.sagepub.com\nIntroduction\nThis article concerns a classic book in the sociology of devi-\nance, Stanley Cohen's (1973) Folk Devils and Moral Panics.\nAlthough Google Scholar records almost 4,000 citations\nsince it was published, that does not reflect how popular the\nconcept has become. It has generated a half-dozen text\nbooks, crossed over into popular culture, and will soon reach\n1 million pages on a Google search (Thompson & Williams,\n2012). Although the application of the label has been queried\nin specific cases (Cornwell & Linders, 2002; Critcher,\n2003), no one has ever subjected Cohen's case study to\ncritical scrutiny. However, the moment one compares\nCohen's (1969) model to the historical record, his own dis-\nsertation on the subject, and even a close reading of Folk\nDevils to his model, it quickly becomes apparent that the\npublic reaction to the clashes between the British Mods and\nRockers youth groups in 1964 did not support either Cohen's\ndescription or definition of a moral panic. In short, the moral\npanic literature and the concept's popularity are built on an\nextremely weak foundation.\nDescriptions and Definitions\nIf popularity were any guide, Stan Cohen's (1973) Folk\nDevils and Moral Panics is Britain's major contribution to\nsociology, and the story of the Mods and Rockers has mes-\nmerized criminology, media studies, a score or more of other\ndisciplines, and even the rock group \"The Who.\" As a result,\nit has become an international truism that a minor spat\nbetween two groups of bored youths at a decaying U.K.\nseaside resort was turned by a distorted and exaggerated\nmedia account into an extremely irrational societal-wide\nreaction--a moral panic--increasing the deviancy it con-\ndemned while ignoring the moral boundary crisis that pre-\ncipitated the panic, even though it never happened.\nFor two decades, U.S. scholars ignored Cohen's ground\nbreaking theoretical account of how societies create the devi-\nancy that they condemn, reaffirm a consensus in values, and\nbuild unnecessary control cultures, preferring their own\nexplanations, including moral enterprise (Becker, 1963),\nsymbolic crusades (Gusfield, 1963), and crime waves\n(Fishman, 1978). However, the last decade has seen a para-\ndigm shift, and \"moral panic\" has become the explanation\nwithout any debate over its viability, despite the growing\nnumber of awkward questions raised by evidential critics,\nrival paradigms, and even adherents aware that its weak-\nnesses have became too obvious to ignore (Cornwell &\nThe major problem remains the very cause of its popular-\nity: the complete lack of theoretical, definitional, and eviden-\ntial integrity evidenced by the way the label has been applied\nto anything that appears to conform to Cohen's (1973)\n1Hartwick College, Oneonta, NY, USA\n2University of South Florida,Tampa, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nCecil Greek, Dept. of Sociology, University of South Florida,\nEmail: cgreek@usf.edu.\nMods and Rockers, Drunken Debutants,\nand Sozzled Students: Moral Panic or the\nBritish Silly Season?\nBillThompson1 and Cecil Greek2\n Keywords\nmoral panic, Mods, Rockers, delinquency, hooliganism, media amplification\n2 SAGE Open\ndescription of a moral panic rather than his definition, even\nthough the former is generic to every other model of social\nproblem construction:\n\u00b7 A social group or phenomena is defined as a threat\nto societal values in the media.\n\u00b7 The coverage includes denunciations of the folk\ndevil/phenomenon by editors, religious leaders,\npoliticians, and \"experts.\"\n\u00b7 \"Ways of coping\" are devised.\n\u00b7 The folk devil becomes embedded in the collective\nmemory.\n\u00b7 Legal/social policy changes may follow. (Cohen,\nAs a result, with one notable exception (Hall, Critcher,\nJefferson, Clarke, & Robert, 1979), no one else has ever\nuncovered a moral panic as Cohen (1973) defined them in\nFolk Devils, which supposedly \"contained all the elements\nfrom which one might generalize about Folk Devils and\nMoral Panics\" (p. 11). The definition consisted of three\n\"distinct but interlocking\" phases involving an interactive\nprocess among the media messages, the general public, the\nsocial control agencies, and the folk devils, none of which\nappears or is implied in the description:\n\u00b7 Phase 1 involves the media coverage of the \"pre-\ncipitating event\" that involves Exaggeration and\nDistortion, Prediction about further difficulties to\ncome, and the Symbolization of the problem the\nfolk devil represented.\n\u00b7 Phase 2 concerns the way the media coverage leads\nto the Orientation of public beliefs with the aid\nof Images of the folk devil that lead to new stig-\nmatizing labels and a consensus over Causation\nexplaining their behavior, and revolves around the\nsubsequent Sensitization of the public and social\ncontrol agencies to the problem making the prob-\nlem look bigger than it is.\n\u00b7 Phase 3 covers the simultaneous increase in the\nSocietal Control Culture, including new laws, and\nthe role of Exploitative Cultures using the panic for\ntheir own ends.\nThese three phases also contained a vast array of \"must\nhave\" features from the public dramatization of evil to the\namplification of the deviancy that facilitates the nine \"ele-\nments,\" but as they were also generic to other perspectives,\nthe defining feature of a moral panic was the \"transactional\nprocess\" between the parties involved over the three phases\nConsequently, the popularity of the concept and the grow-\ning number of subsequent moral panics was a function of the\nuse of the generic description that ensured that the moment an\nacademic picked up a newspaper and saw a horror headline\nfollowed by adverse moral comment and a politician demand-\ning legislation, another panic was added to the paradigm's\ncatalog, even though the general public who were supposed to\nbe panicking were none the wiser and could not have cared\nDespite the attempt of the U.S. variant of panic theory to\ncircumvent these problems, it has only succeeded in making\nmatters worse (Goode & Ben-Yehuda, 1994). As any sudden\nmanifestation of a social group's fears about another group's\nbehavior, lifestyle, or political perspective would appear\nvolatile and involve a consensus of concern by \"a segment of\nsociety\" expressing hostility through \"disproportionate\"\nclaims about the threat, the \"new, improved\" definition is\neven more generic than Cohen's overworked description.\nMoreover, as this new definition no longer contains the ratio-\nnales and justifications for the label moral panic that Cohen's\ndefinition supplied, the concept no longer makes any sense\n(Thompson & Williams, 2012). Although this tendency was\nfueling the concept's rising popularity in the United States\nduring the 1990s, back in Britain, conservative ideologues\nwere having a field day ridiculing the concept by demon-\nstrating the panic paradigm's failure to apply the label to pro-\ngressive causes even though they frequently matched the\ngeneric description as well (Hunt, 1997).\nThis article draws attention to three major, interrelated,\nproblems found in Cohen's account that have subsequently\nshaped the paradigm and encouraged that political bias: (a)\nthe panic paradigm's reliance on theories about social action\nrather than the actors'motivations; (b) the failure to establish\nquality control, including the 40-year failure to subject any\nof the seminal studies to evidential scrutiny testing their via-\nbility; and (c) the tendency of case studies to deliberately\nignore countervailing evidence. We illustrate these problems\nby drawing attention to how several omissions from the his-\ntorical record reveal that even Cohen's initial case study that\nlaunched the model did not match his description, let alone\nhis definition of moral panic.\nThe Contextual Background\nAccording to Cohen (1973), despite the fact that the clash\nbetween the two youth groups at Clacton only made head-\nlines because of a \"slow news day\" (p. 45), the coverage\nquickly led to the projection of extensive unarticulated fears\nabout the \"direction in which society was going\" onto\nHowever, while the reports were exaggerated and distorted,\nthey would not have generated public \"confusion\" about the\nmeaning of the \"ambiguous\" event--the basis of the \"panic\"\nin the moral panic--because the news media had been full\nof stories about violent hooliganism and destructive vandal-\nism for three long years, and little else in the weeks leading\nto Clacton.\nThompson and Greek 3\nSoccer hooliganism had become so prevalent between\ndance centers to keep known hooligans away from the\ngames, and as Clacton involved two rival factions fighting\neach other without concern for whom or what was in the\nway, it raised a rational fear that mass hooliganism would\nnot end with the soccer season in May. Although home\ngrown soccer hooliganism was nothing new, rising affluence\nhad enabled groups such as the \"Merseyside Maniacs\" to\nattend road games and fight with the home team's hooligans\nThen, when a 3-year-old girl's drowning was blamed on\nan anonymous vandal who had broken the safety catch on a\ngate preventing unaccompanied children reaching the river\nIrwell in 1960, vandalism rivaled soccer hooliganism for\nmedia space and a popular indicator of delinquency, facts\ncharted by a contemporary doctoral student, named Stanley\npublic and privately owned facilities from advertising bill-\nboards to schools came under attack. That nothing was\nsacred was demonstrated by the 250% increase in claims\n1969). This coverage was enhanced in the weeks leading up\nto Clacton with a series of horror headlines about dangerous\nand deadly vandalism, which would have ensured that\nClacton would have made the front page even on a fast news\nday. A post office report highlighting the lack of access to\nemergency services because 70,000 public telephones were\nbeing vandalized every year was matched by another from\nBritish Rail concerning the 70% increase in derailments\ncaused by vandalism over the previous 2 years. Consequently,\nwhen the Local Government Information Office released\nThe Cost of Vandalism to Local Authorities, Cohen (1969)\ntold us that its \"get tough\" policy ensured that the local\nmedia, pulpits, passing-out parades, and school prize-day\nspeeches became preoccupied with vandalism (Cohen, 1969,\nClacton was the wrong time for Mods and Rockers to play\nvandals and hooligans in public.\nThe omission of this immediate context from Folk Devils is\nmatched by the complete lack of any indication that the coun-\ntry was already in the midst of a debate over the causes of and\nsolutions to delinquency, involving political parties, churches,\ncharities, and other interest groups. The debate, which had\npreoccupied the country since the appearance of the Teddy\nBoy gangs in the early 1950s, had already led to six major\nand produced the competing explanations and solutions that\nCohen erroneously claimed suddenly appeared after Clacton\n(Thompson & Williams, 2012).As a result, the only thing new\nabout the Clacton coverage was putting a label, Mods and\nRockers, on the previously anonymous vandals.\nLikewise, although a moral \"boundary crisis\" definitely\nexisted, Clacton could not have led to the \"suppressed fears\"\nabout the \"permissive society\" being projected on to the\nyouths--the \"moral\" in the moral panic (Cohen, 1973, pp.\ncamps over permissiveness during March 1963 following\nthree very public scandals. The month was best remembered\nfor the Profumo Affair that led to the resignation of the sec-\nretary of state for war following the exposure of his adulter-\nous liaison with Ms. Keeler, who counted the Soviet naval\nattach\u00e9 Yevgeny Ivanov among her paying paramours during\na hot period of the cold war. Two other issues turned March\n1963 into a Moralgate. The first was the acquittal on a man-\nslaughter charge of a 16-year-old youth who had smashed a\nwine decanter over the head of the former chairman of the\nLabour Party, George Brinham, during an attempted moles-\ntation. That revelation and the fact Profumo lied to parlia-\nment about his affair led the public to question whether any\npolitician maintained the same moral standards that they\ndemanded from the masses. On top of that, March also saw\nthe release of Honest to God, a critique of simplistic reli-\ngious faith by the bishop of Woolwich, Dr. John Robertson.\nConservative Christians, already upset by his role in the\n1960 Lady Chatterley trial that destroyed literary censorship\nin the United Kingdom, were horrified that the virgin birth\nand resurrection were being debunked in front of a rapidly\nsecularizing population, and even more so, with the bishop's\nsubsequent dismissal of the church's sexual morals on prime\ntime TV. As a result, the rationales for Britain's moral laws\ndisappeared overnight, not least because of the policy already\nadopted by director general of the BBC, Hugh Greene.\nConvinced that Britain was well on the way to becoming a\npluralistic society, Greene ensured that all sides gained a\nhearing through the new medium of documentaries, lengthy\nbut riveting studio discussions, and the path breaking satiri-\ncal show That Was The Week That Was. These innovations\nensured that the three scandals' ramifications were debated\nby Blythe in his Age of Illusion published at the same time\n1971). The public reaction was far more dramatic than that\nprovoked in the United States by Edward R. Morrow's con-\ntemporaneous Columbia Broadcasting Service reports.\nIn the face of the subsequent maelstrom of mass malcon-\ntent on all sides, The Times, Britain's \"establishment\" mouth-\npiece led the media pack in flipping the existing discourse\nregarding Britain's \"social malaise\" into a \"moral malaise\"\nby reminding its readers,\nHistory shows that societies rise and fall, flourish and\ndecay, by what they believe in and by what their way\nUnfortunately for the establishment, they were the only\nones who were going to panic about this modern \"fall\nof Rome.\" Middle-class Oxbridge graduates had already\n4 SAGE Open\ndemonstrated their preference for gainful satire at the BBC\nrather than government service at the Foreign Office. The new\ncorporate white-collar classes wanted more \"permissiveness\"\ntoo. They welcomed the deregulation of moral crimes that\nbegan in the mid-1950s, lapped up the likes of Lady Chatterley,\nlined up all nights in their thousands to buy the Denning\nReport on the Profumo Affair, and watched with glee as the\nchampions of the \"new morality\"--as permissiveness was\ncalled at the time--bested the hapless defenders of the old on\nTV night after night. Meanwhile, the masses who preferred\nsocialism to patriotism and Empire were refusing to stand for\nthe national anthem when played at local cinemas screening\ncynical \"northern realist\" movies, amplifying the effects of the\n\"kitchen sink\" stage plays from \"the angry young men\" of the\nwould have been impossible for anyone to make anyone or\nanything, let alone the Mods and Rockers, the subject of a\nsocietal-wide reaction against permissiveness.\nAlthough Clacton initially excited the \"law and order\"\nlobby, their involvement did not last long. The handful of\nspats on a couple of beaches over the next 3 years simply\ncould not compete with the horror headlines about soccer\nhooliganism's increasing casualty list and the rising body\ncount from the London gang-land feud between the Krays\nand Richardson \"firms,\" the serial child killing Moors\nMurderers, and the shooting of three London policemen.\nThose developments ensured not only that \"violence\"\nreplaced \"youth\" as the lobby's metaphor for adverse change\nthat switch was used by the second seminal moral panic case\nstudy to explain the alleged panic over muggers (Hall et al.,\n1978). As a result, long before the last deck chair was put\naway in 1964, the only people left \"panicking\" about the\nyouths were a couple of resort town's traders associations,\nwhose demands for action were invariably opposed by the\nThis missing contextual background has several ramifica-\ntions for Cohen's account of the way the media \"inventory\"\ncovering Clacton was supposed to promote the moral panic.\nThe Inventory Explained\nAs vandalism and hooliganism were already receiving\n\"grossly disproportionate\" coverage compared with other\numn inches devoted to the Clacton reaction was not surpris-\ning. Most distortions recorded by Cohen followed on\ndirectly from the preexisting media frames, and the all-\nimportant \"prediction\" element with its supposed multiplier\neffect is explained by the fact that the youths added insult to\ninjury by putting on a repeated performance the very next\nday. As a result, apart from naming and blaming the youths\nfor the previously anonymous crime of vandalism, the media\ninventory could not have had the \"new\" meanings and sub-\nLikewise, far from representing a united philosophy as\nCohen claimed, the same misreported incidents displayed in\nthe press reports are explained by the fact that every article\ninitially relied on the same source, a \"stringer\": the local\nnewspaper reporter who supplied the newswire services with\na story they were willing to buy because of all the previous\npublicity about violent vandals. As that also explains why\nthe initial reports concentrated on the \"violence linked to\nvandalism,\" \"the cost of damage,\" and \"loss of trade\" rather\nthan the physical clash, it negates Cohen's (1973) ability to\nassert that they offer proof of media irrationality (pp. 36-37).\nThere was not anything new, different, or special about the\nnews' editorials and bombastic comments about the youths\nthat then appeared, as they emanated from the marginalized\nlaw and order lobby frustrated that they were loosing the\ndelinquency debate in general and had just failed to stop the\n1963 Children's and Young Persons Act with its \"soft\noptions\" for juvenile delinquents. In any event, the lobby's\nindignation had far less to do with the youths' disrespect for\nauthority than their own resentment that their \"natural ally,\"\nthe Conservative Party, then in government, was being just\nas liberal as the Socialist Labour Party. That political con-\nsensus also explains why, despite Cohen's (1973) claims\ndramatic effect, the press was really scraping the barrel by\nrelying on an aging vicar, a youth worker, a probation offi-\ncer, a marriage councilor, a psychiatrist, a headmaster, and a\n\"pop star\" to populate the moral barricades. The failure of\nany arch-bishops, cabinet ministers, shadow cabinet minis-\nters, professors with research to cite, leaders of national\nassociations dealing with youth, chairs of county govern-\nment associations, senior police officers, and the headmaster\nand mistresses associations to appear in media discussions,\nwhen they usually led societal condemnation of deviants,\nwas highly significant.\nReaction Phase 1: Manufacturing\nOpinions and Attitudes\nThe second phase of the alleged moral panic involving the\ninculcation of the media inventory that orientates the pub-\nlic's understanding of the problem reinforcing the folk dev-\nils' role as a target for those unarticulated fears is also\nquestionable as the causation offered after Clacton, from\n\"boredom\" to \"potential cabalism,\" was the same as that\noffered before Clacton for delinquency in general. Indeed,\naccording to a long forgotten article, as every one of the new\ncauses had also been thrown at the violent Teddy Boys 10\nyears before, their reappearance undermined Cohen's claim\nthey were related to his account of the context of the 1960s\nMedia inventories would be needless anyway given the\npublic's personal experience of endemic vandalism and soc-\ncer hooliganism that had already ensured that 84% believed\nthat these manifestations of delinquency were symbiotically\nThompson and Greek 5\nlinked (Cohen, 1969). The public could not have adopted the\nalleged \"disaster orientation\" of the media either, given that\nit did not appear in the contemporaneous press, but was a\nThe only adverse disaster analogy that appeared at the time\nwas a single reference made by one Brighton MP comparing\nthe beachside invasion by the youths with the aftereffects of\nan earthquake, although the police were mindful of another\nanalogy. They were determined to nip any potential trouble\nin the bud because of the recent \"disaster\" in Lima, Peru,\nwhen 200 soccer fans were crushed to death as the crowd\nattempted to escape from rioting hooligans and the police's\nelevated promenade at Brighton was a serious safety threat,\nfar from being heavy handed, the police believed that they\nwere saving the youths from themselves (Cohen, 1973, pp.\nAs we do not have the space to cover all the rationales\nCohen offered for the successful inculcation of the media\n\"images\" despite the lack of any direct evidence (see the\npolemic rebuttal in Thompson & Williams, 2012), we draw\nyour attention to three key problems. Less than a year after\nFolk Devils, Cohen admitted that although media accounts\ncould set an agenda, no one could determine what conclu-\nsions the public would adopt (Cohen & Young, 1973, Part 3,\nIntroduction). Cohen's account relies on examples of pseudo-\npsychological explanations like mass hysteria and mass\ndelusion found elsewhere around the world, which he sug-\ngested were at work in the United Kingdom also whenever\nhe was unable to offer direct evidence. This was a doubly\ndubious practice given that whenever sociologists have\nexamined these \"explanations,\" from The War of the Worlds\nthey have always uncovered material explanations for what\nnot least, far from panicking, the public responded to the\nhorror headlines by pouring into Clacton the very next day\ndespite the weather being the worst for 80 years. They con-\ntinued to flood over the battle ground beaches all summer\nlong in spite of all the predictions and \"warnings\" in the for-\nlorn hope of catching the youths in action. Indeed, the\nrematch in Margate over the Whitsun holiday 7 weeks later\ndramatically increased hotel bookings despite the violence\nof \"no shows\" and \"nonevents\" by the newspapers in their\ndesperate attempt to maintain interest in a flagging story\nensured that it was not long before the disappointed public\nrealized that the problem had been blown out of all propor-\ntion and was a storm in a tea cup. Beachside invasions were\nrare and concentrated in three resorts, Brighton in particular\nDespite using a professional news clipping service, Cohen\n(1973) could not offer any evidence of similar disturbances at\nany of the other 50 resort towns from Bognor Regis in the\nsouth to Whitby Bay in the north, although a couple of resorts\nused the publicity as an excuse to ban bongo bashing beatniks\nfrom their beaches. If anyone is exaggerating, it is Cohen. The\nminor rumbles at Brighton, Bournemouth, Great Yarmouth,\nHastings, and Margate during Whitsun 1964 and the handful\nof Mod invasions of Brighton in the summer of 1965 meant\nthat the Mods and Rocker phenomenon lasted a single sum-\nmer, unlike the Teddy Boys who had caused general disorder\nin most U.K. cities and towns all year round as well as beach\nresorts during the summer season throughout the 1950s, as\nCohen knew perfectly well (Rock & Cohen, 1970).\nThis major evidential shortfall is not solved by Cohen's\nexamples of the media attempt to \"widen the net,\" slapping\nthe label Mod on unrelated incidents inland as there is no\nevidence that these alleged \"follow-up stories\" surpassed the\nusual number of reports covering \"Friday night fighting\" in\nthe action-starved local press. As only one of Cohen's (1973)\nexamples alluded to \"Mods\" (pp. 79-80), and few people\nwould have read them, these stories could not have amplified\nthe panic nationwide. Indeed, as the police warnings only\nconcerned the 3-day weekends known as bank holidays dur-\ning the short U.K. summer season, and media attention dis-\nappeared the moment the 9-month soccer season started\nagain, we are definitely dealing with a seasonal news theme.\nsent to Cohen covering \"vandalism/hooliganism\" greatly\noutnumbered those referencing \"Mods/Rockers.\" Likewise,\nthe number of drunken students charged with public disorder\nappears to have surpassed the total number of Mods and\nRockers arrested at the beach resorts during the same period,\nmaking drunken students a greater threat. As Glasgow,\nBirmingham, and a dozen other major cities also initiated\nmajor antivandalism drives during 1965, this suggests that\nvandalism per se remained a far more important issue than\nthe Mods and Rockers ever became (Cohen, 1969).\nAnother major omission, and perhaps the most important,\nensures that although a sudden event \"perceived as a disloca-\ntion of the social structure or a threat to cherished values\"\nmay lead to \"debates about the implications rather than the\nevent,\" the Clacton reaction was nothing like Cohen's (1973,\npp. 49-54) theoretically determined one. Far from demon-\nstrating that the Mods and Rockers became the perceived\nthreat to the \"careworn cherished values,\" Folk Devils\nmerely offers up that supposition that the reaction followed\nfrom the \"possibility\" that Britain's adults \"might\" have per-\nceived the Mods'a sexual fashion, mobility, deportment, and\nposture of indifference \"as something deeper and more per-\nThat possibility is belied not only by the ongoing debates\nover delinquency we covered above but also, more impor-\ntantly, by the actions of the very people Cohen identified,\ncorrectly, as being most likely to be adversely effected: the\nevangelical Christian community personified by Mary\nWhitehouse and Lord Longford.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe response of the evangelicals and the old petit-bour-\ngeoisie they supposedly represented was the complete oppo-\nsitetotheimpressionthatCohengavehisreaders.Whitehouse\ninitiated her counter attack against permissiveness immedi-\nately after the March 1963 Moralgate for precisely the rea-\nsons we outlined above, which is why her Clean UP TV\n(CUTV) campaign launched in May 1964 targeted Greene's\npropagation of the \"new morality\" at the BBC, gaining far\nmore media coverage than the Mods and Rockers in the pro-\n1965, when the CUTV metamorphosed into the National\nViewers and Listeners Association (NVALA), a permanent\nmoral crusade against all forms of permissiveness in the\nmedia, Whitehouse still did not target the youths. As\nWhitehouse had become the symbol and voice of the antiper-\nmissive forces during this period, that deals a severe blow to\ncals shared the same perspective as his single law and order\nfor the panic relied, is also belied by another major omission\nfrom his account. Whitehouse's view of the youths was\nshaped by the U.K.'s independent chapter of Moral\nRearmament that had launched a series of propaganda cam-\npaign posters via the Daily Express, explaining and expound-\ning on what we would now call the \"third way,\" the Christian\nposition between capitalism and socialism, every couple of\nmonths. The one issued after Whitsun denounced the horror\nheadlines, defended the Mods and Rockers, and even excused\nteenage drug taking and violence by placing the blame for\ndelinquency on the \"hypocritical\" elite from priests to parlia-\nmentarians who had overseen Britain's moral decline during\nexplained elsewhere, the motivating force behind that initia-\ntive and the NVALA was their fear that the decriminalization\nand normalization of sin, from birth control for unwed\nwomen to smut sold in main street stores, would encourage\nGod's collective wrath on society (Greek & Thompson,\nMP and far from the \"reactionary\" of Cohen's caricature. He\nhad chaired the Labour Party Education Committee that cod-\nified and promoted the most widely accepted explanation for\ndelinquency during the 1960s, \"the school leaver problem,\"\nwhich Cohen presented in Folk Devils as if it was his own\nand insisted had not been raised at the time (compare\nAlthough it is always difficult to determine what \"the\npublic\" is thinking, the third omission in this phase concerns\nthe underreporting of the extent of \"the differential reac-\ntion.\" Cohen dismissed the results of his own contemporary\nsurveys as being \"unrepresentative\" of the wider public even\nthough the sample of professionals in the control culture and\nanother including residents of and visitors to Brighton would\nprovide an excellent test for the inculcation of the media\nthem. Contrary to the impression offered in Folk Devils, both\nsamples rejected the media orientation; They did so in favor\nof their existing perspective, the meaning of which rarely\nmatched the theoretical spin Cohen placed on them.\nFor example, when the professional sample referenced\nthe generation gap that Cohen insisted was based on sexual\nand material jealousy of the younger generation to fit his\nexplanation for the panic, the respondents offered competing\nrationales including the gulf in religious and moral sensibili-\nties between the generations. The self-validating interpreta-\ntions promoted by Cohen (1969, see Chapter 8) were only\nbelied by other more comprehensive surveys (Cohen, 1969,\nproblem with the account offered in Folk Devils. Although\nthe professional sample wanted the courts to \"tighten up,\"\nthat perspective was premised on reserving the courts for the\ndepraved hard-core hooligan. They preferred to deal with the\nmajority of deprived delinquents by retaining the informal\ncontrols of the past, like a clip round the ear by a British\nBobby or the use of the cane in schools. Although Cohen\ntion in his PhD, the professionals preferred those controls\nprecisely because they wanted to avoid labeling and crimi-\nnalizing troubled youth. In direct contradistinction to\nCohen's (1969) expectation, the magistrates in the sample\nalso rejected popular stereotypes and the \"law and order\" (p.\n386) lobby's solution, preferring to judge each delinquent on\nthe basis of their individual character, behavior, motives, and\npotential for recidivism. The wider sample, who blamed\ndelinquency on materialism and other social factors, also\nwanted to reform the courts by reducing the gross overrepre-\nsentation of conservative Christian women on the magis-\ntrates' bench in favor of the working classes, schoolteachers,\nand youth workers who would understand the youths' prob-\nlems (Cohen, 1969). Cohen's admission that he could not\nmake sense of these positions reflects the fact that he made\nno attempt to study the philosophy behind them, because he\nsimply divided the world into progressives and reactionaries.\nAs a result, he never understood that far from being \"incon-\nsistent,\" the Christians in the professional sample rejected\nthe vengeful nature of the \"law and order\" lobby and were\nwary of the psychological determinism being promoted by\ncontemporary progressives because they feared that it would\nled to the insidious forms of social control that Cohen (1985,\nlate.\nThe Brighton public was equally dismissive of the media\ninventory, for although 33.9% believed that the youths were\ndelinquent, 65.1% did not, and even those who did thought\nthat the youths were no worse than any other (Cohen, 1969).\nThe most important revelation, however, appeared in the\nprofessional sample's answers to a \"scale of contemporary\nyouth problems\" in which they dismissed the Mods and\nRockers as less of a threat to public safety than joy riders.\nThompson and Greek 7\nWhen asked to rank juvenile crimes, Mods and Rockers\ncame in 9th out of 14 options. The professionals'priorities--\n(a) armed robbery, (b) vandalism on railway lines, (c) armed\ngang fights, and (d) taking drugs--demonstrated not only\nthat they, like the masses, judged threats by the risk to life or\nlimb but also that they were still being guided by the pre-\nClacton vandalism inventory and their memory of the previ-\nous decade's highly publicized Teddy Boy knife fights\ncontemporary Pathe newsreels covering the Mods and\nRockers, available now on YouTube (2010), to see why they\ndid so. Despite the commentary invariably playing up the\n\"threat\" to justify its subject matter, the content demon-\nstrated that this was no more than \"a storm in a tea cup\" and\nhelps explain why this kind of media exaggeration and the\nKeystone Cop behavior fanned the flames of the widespread\ncynicism toward needless authority mercilessly lampooned\nby the Monty Python team who had also written for That Was\nThe Week That Was.\nThese distortions in Folk Devils are surpassed by the\nbemusing oversight concerning the prehistory of the Rockers\nthat explains what Cohen never did: why the youths clashed\nat Clacton. If the omission of the pre-Clacton inventory was\nodd, the possibility that the founder of the moral panic para-\ndigm was unaware that the Rockers had already been sub-\njected to two generic description panics before 1964 defies\ncredulity. The first wave of adverse publicity labeled them\nTon-up boys reflecting their obsession reaching \"the ton,\"\n100 mph, on the U.K.'s congested pre freeway roads in the\nlate 1950s. They then metamorphosed into \"Rockers\" during\nthe early 1960s at the Ace Cafe on London's North Circular\nRoad, which they turned into their personal race track. These\nevents attracted the attention of the \"exploitative culture,\" in\nthe form of Freeman's 1961 popular novel Leather Boys,\nwhich was turned into a 1963 exploitation movie featuring\nthe Ace as a location. By then, however, the Rockers were\nfacing competition on the roads from an armada of mobile\nMods on their imported Italian motor scooters that they also\nused to invade the south coast resorts favored by the Rockers,\nmaking clashes inevitable and frequent during 1963.\nAlthough the press did not catch on to that development, the\npublic definitely had evidenced by the way Britain's unoffi-\ncial barometer of popular trends, Stock Exchange messen-\ngers, had adopted the rival monikers \"Mod\" or \"Rocker\" a\nproblem differentiating between these members of highly\norganized motor cycle clubs, complete with membership\ncards, from the Mods before Clacton.\nCollectively, these omissions from Cohen's account of\nthe Clacton reaction is the equivalent of \"explaining\" U.S.\nforeign policy from Reagan onward without once mention-\ning Rumsfeld, Cheney, or the role of the neo cons and their\nnew mission for America. In reality, the U.K. public were no\nwhere near as united in condemnation as Cohen contends,\nand it would have been impossible to turn the youths into\nsocietal-wide scapegoats for permissiveness when most peo-\nple didn't care. Those mobilizing against permissiveness had\ndefended the youths, and the politically marginalized law\nand order lobby were more interested in counting dead bod-\nies, rather than damaged scooters.\nReaction, Phase 2: EvidenceVersus\n\"Analysis\"\nAs it is impossible to cover them all, we offer a representa-\nsee Thompson & Williams, 2012) account of the public and\npolice sensitization to \"any act that looked like hooliganism\"\nthat was then \"invariably classified as part of the Mods and\nRockers phenomenon.\" Soccer hooliganism continued to be\nconsidered a separate phenomenon despite consisting of the\n\"hard-Mods,\" who quickly metamorphosed into the U.K.'s\nnotorious skinheads, fighting each other. Cohen's (1973)\nbest example of the supposed rise in false alarms reflecting\nthe sensitization process was immediately dismissed by the\npolice as \"people getting jumpy after the trouble on the\nlowing a rumor of an impending invasion, are deliberately\nmisleading, in this case because fun fairs were frequent sites\nof teen conflict. The \"new\" police tactics, supposedly\nadopted as a result of the panic were not new either, having\nbeen deployed against both the major political protest of the\nera, the \"ban the bomb\" marches, and mobile soccer hooli-\nthe alleged \"unprecedented national coordination\" of the\npolice response was nothing of the kind, as the all-important\nconference at the Home Office only included the chief con-\nstables from the five counties containing the invaded resort\nAlthough the \"dramatization of evil\" in the courts was\ntrue enough, it did not demonstrate an escalation in the con-\ntrol culture.As only 24 of the 97 Clacton arrestees were actu-\nally charged, and the criterion used to prosecute--a prior\nconviction--guaranteed a \"harsher\" penalty, the \"increase\"\nin penalties handed down after the Whitsun rematches were\nin line with the \"seriousness of the offence,\" and there was\nnothing new about the deployment of the extralegal mea-\nsures \"making an example\" of those who persisted in invad-\ndoes not support Cohen's claims at all, and his PhD thesis\ntold a very different story about Brighton.\nThe claims about wrongful arrests were inflated by the\ntypical yobbo's lying lament that they \"were doing nothing.\"\nIf they had bothered to educate themselves about the law and\nappealed the \"no bail\" conditions imposed, they would have\ngained instant release. Any police officer found to have been\noverreacting was reprimanded, and there was no repetition\nof the extralegal punishments once The Times denounced the\n8 SAGE Open\nwhole affair (Cohen, 1969). Indeed, it was the lack of any\n\"crack down\" that ensured the resort towns' \"law and order\"\nlobbies were unimpressed despite all the rhetoric and contin-\nued to demand \"more controls\" over the 3-year period, evi-\ndenced by the type of complaint emanating from one License\n\"innovation\" during this period was the airlift of police rein-\nforcements to Hastings, although that too turned out to be a\ndramatic voice over commentary you can see on YouTube, it\nwas merely a means to get a back-up squad over the con-\ngested Bank Holiday roads, and as it failed in its primary\nintent, to reduce the rising overtime costs of keeping reserves\non standby in each resort town, it was abandoned (see Cohen,\nOnce one notices that the survey in Folk Devils supposed\nto demonstrate that 81% of the public were demanding\nharsher penalties collapses to 18% the moment one removes\ninflation factors, such as limiting media coverage to reduce\ncopycat behavior (Cohen, 1973; see Thompson & Williams,\n2012), the only issue left to deal with is Cohen's account of\nthe in situ amplification of deviancy on Brighton beach.\nIntended to offer the \"more sociological explanation\" that\nnegated the vicarious motives behind the public's presence\non the beaches, prove that the \"differential reaction\" was\nunrepresentative and illustrate how the youths' enmity\ntoward each other was generated by the panic; it collapses\nunder the weight of the contradictions within it.\nBefore one even gets to the beach, the polarization by\npanic thesis is belied by the very horror headlines that sup-\nposedly provoked the panic. The labels Mod and Rocker\ncould hardly have had the pejorative meanings accredited to\nthem after Clacton by Cohen when resort town newspapers\nsuch as Brighton Evening Argus and the national bestseller,\nthe Daily Mirror, were still not using the monikers Mod or\nRockers in their Whitsun horror headlines 7 weeks later\nread Folk Devils would discover, the contemporaneous con-\ndemnation in the reports tended to consist of derogatory gen-\neralizations like The Daily Telegraph's attack on the \"grubby\nThat lack of evidence for the immediate demonization of the\nMods and Rockers, like many others, followed from the fact\nthat Cohen's thesis relied on his own composite of the media\nreports rather than a quantified content analysis, which\nwould have undermined it. Second, Cohen's assertion that\nthe youths were not really polarized before the Clacton\ninventory rests on three contentious foundations. The first is\nthat as both groups were \"working class,\" the polarization\nwas innately exaggerated, even though that had never\nstopped rival youth groups from that class fighting over turf\nor loyalty to soccer teams. Second, Cohen set an impossible\nstandard for polarization that never appeared in the press, the\nneed for the youths to constitute two \"highly structured\nopposing groups.\" What ultimately undermines Cohen's\npolarization by panic thesis, however, is his reliance on the\nlack of the homogeneity among the Mods when it came to\nfashion, for if the Mods' lack of common fashion prevented\nthe homogeneity required for polarization, that also ensures\nthat the panic's alleged effect never materialized either. As\nthe different Mod subgroups' fashion sense in 1964 under-\nmined the media claim that they constituted a distinct group,\nthe youths still only amounted to undifferentiated \"crowds\"\nremarkable is that the moment one turns to Cohen's (1973, p.\n194) explanation for the panic, his \"major factor\" in the\nMods ability to become the public scapegoats for permis-\nsiveness was their \"sheer uniformity in dress.\"\nLikewise, Cohen wants us to believe that the Mods, who\nwere apparently \"bored\" and \"listless\" with \"no definite\nplans\" once they arrived, were then led into deviancy by the\nmedia publicity that created the \"expectation\" that there\n\"excitement seekers\" needed to be told by the Daily Mirror\nthat \"delinquents throw deck chairs in the sea\" or required\nthe encouragement of the Daily Express to \"knock old ladies\nover\" while doing so. Yet the moment we turn to Cohen's\n(1973) account of the context, we find that the Mods had\ndeliberately taken their \"own form of excitement\" (pp. 161,\ncapitalist cityscapes to the beaches with them. That admis-\nsion makes far more sense given that these thugs' \"target\ncould rapidly change from rockers, to beatniks, to police,\"\nand failing that led to \"fighting amongst themselves\" (Cohen,\nclaim that none of this violence would have happened with-\nout the Clacton reaction, of course, is that the Mods had\nexhibited \"their own form of excitement\" at Clacton, not\nonce but twice before the media inventory could have had\nany effect.\nAs the Rockers, as a group, were rarely in evidence after\nWhitsun 1964, and you do not turn a Beatnik into a Mod or a\nRocker by telling him to \"hit the road, Jack,\" it is no wonder\nthat Cohen's account does not match Young's definition of\nthe deviancy amplification process found in his description\nof the police crack down on the dope smokers of Notting\ncontrast to Young's cops and dope smokers' escalating reac-\ntions to each others' behavior that lead to the creation of an\nextensive counter culture with a \"critical political response\"\nas well as an increase in the original deviance, turning the\ncops' initial stereotype into reality, all Cohen (1973) can\noffer is unconnected reports of \"Friday-night fighting\"\ninland, the police picking on the wrong targets like beatniks,\n\"no shows,\" the standard level of sentencing in the courts,\nand the arrest of innocents who won appeals at Brighton (pp.\noriginal deviance, beach fighting did not become part of the\nThompson and Greek 9\nyouth groups' lifestyles, and counter cultures or political cri-\ntiques with lasting effects did not appear, we are forced to\nagree with a contemporary doctoral student who declared\nthat the concept of deviancy amplification \"would be inap-\npropriate\" to apply to the Mods and Rockers (Cohen, 1969,\np. 437). The same can be said of panic and parliament.\nToday in Parliament\nThe major discrepancy between Cohen's account and social\nreality concerns the Malicious Damage Act introduced after\nthe Whitsun clashes that increased the penalties for vandal-\nism.According to Cohen, this \"emergency measure\" directed\nat the Mods and Rockers followed from the steady crystal-\nlization of the media inventory in the parliamentary\nresponses. Although Taylor's resolution (April 15) and\nGurden's motion (April 27) were too early for the media\n\"symbolism\" to do its work, the panic forced the home sec-\nretary to abandon his position that the law was adequate, and\na statement to that effect (June 4) led to the Malicious\nas this explanation on which the panic paradigm was\nfounded and has remained uncontested for 40 years is\ndirectly contradicted by the parliamentary record, it demon-\nstrates that the panic paradigm is based on a myth that could\nand should have been exposed long before now.\nFar from Taylor's resolution and Gurdon's motion not\nreflecting the panic because of a lack of time, they both\nundermine it. Although the former demanded that the gov-\nernment take action to address the problem at Clacton, Taylor\ndefined the problem as merely the latest example of delin-\nquency, and the speeches during the latter denounced the\nmedia coverage and asserted that the Mods and Rockers\nwere not even delinquent (Cohen, 1973; Hansard, HOC,\nbeing a reactionary. Having referenced the numerous com-\nmittees and inquiries that constituted the national delin-\nquency debate, including the government's Delinquent\nGenerations, Gurden savaged the media inventory and pro-\nmoted a \"third way\" solution: enforced compensation for\n31-40). Most of the MPs, however, were more interested in\npromoting their pet theories about the causes of delinquency\nthat they had just learnt was about to become the subject of a\nRoyal Commission. MPs Edelman, Snow, Fell (from the\nresort town Yarmouth), and Thomas who followed Gurden\nhaggled over whether to blame U.S. TV shows and movies,\nhypocritical adults, the youths' lack of religious sensibility,\nor the \"anomie of affluence\"--a liberal Christian argument\nlong before Simon and Gagnon turned it into a sociological\ngeted capitalist materialism, whereas Thompson, being a\nconservative, opted for parents'spending more time in bingo\nhalls and bowling alleys than raising their children (Hansard,\nFor our purposes, the most important contribution was\nfrom the opposition spokeswoman, Miss Bacon. Having\npointed out that the problem at Clacton could be accredited\nto a small hard core, she launched into a discourse on the\nclassless nature of delinquency. Although Cohen had jumped\non that contemporary motif as evidence of the widespread\nirrational misconception that the Mods and Rockers delin-\nquency was caused by the youth's affluence, he misled his\nreaders regarding its origins and effect. The belief that delin-\nquency was \"classless\" was a political critique of the law and\norder lobby, evidenced by Bacon's argument that as there\nwas no difference between the worst beachside behavior and\nthat frequently exhibited by drunken upper-class debutants\nor sozzled students from the middle classes, singling out\nworking-class youth was unacceptable in a modern society.\nAs Bacon also reiterated the findings of the Longford\nCommittee concerning the need to offer more help for work-\ning-class teens during their transition from school to work\nbecause of recent structural dislocation (Hansard, HOC,\nMr. Brookes agreed and argued that Clacton was merely a\nmanifestation of the wider problem of hooliganism, and the\nmedia coverage was completely false (listing several reasons\nthat Cohen would later use); that was why no new law was\nneeded, and he would continue to try and reduce the number\nof teens going to jail. He then took the opportunity to\nannounce that his preferred means was to get his advisory\ncommittee on delinquency to canvass the teen perspective on\n\"the stresses and strains caused by the changing British soci-\nety\" to find a solution for delinquency (Hansard, HOC, April\nThe constant references to the wider delinquency debate,\nthe common criticism of the horror headlines, and the rea-\nsons given for rejecting the law and order lobby's demands\nin the press clearly undermine Cohen's excuse about timing.\nThe speeches reveal that the MPs not only rejected the horror\nheadlines but also had a very different agenda. Having\nalready debated the wider issue of delinquency for 4 years,\nthey were raising the issues that they hoped would be\naddressed by the Royal Commission, which were, as they are\nnow, a major device for justifying new directions in legisla-\ntion, and the debate clearly inferred that its findings would\nbe liberal in keeping with the times.\nCohen's assertion that the Malicious Damages Bill that\nfollowed targeted the youths, and reflected a change of heart\nbecause of the moral panic, rests on four arguments. The first\nis that Brooke informed the House during the debate,\nI want this Bill also to be a reassurance to the long\nadded)\nThe second concerned the increased number of MPs\naddressing the beachside disturbances, and the Mods and\nRockers in particular. The third is his data-less assertion that\nlegislatures adopt tangential measures against folk devils\nbecause they prefer \"affirmations and gestures\" that \"aligns\noneself symbolically with the angels\" without taking up\n\"cudgels against the devil\" because \"at times of moral panic,\npoliticians in office . . . often act to calm things down\"\nknew that the amount of damage was slight, \"whatever the\n`devil'was in the seaside resorts, it was not primarily vandal-\nother three offer perfect examples of the academic construc-\ntion of reality.\nDespite the publicity surrounding the Whitsun rematch,\nas only 9 of the country's 650 MPs tabled parliamentary\nquestions that tend to reflect comment and complaint coming\nfrom their constituents, that number proves that there was no\nsocietal-wide panic. However, although the government\nrejected the proposals contained within the questions because\nit believed the present law was adequate, the question from\nTaylor forced the home secretary to take the unusual step of\nmaking the Seaside Resorts (Hooliganism) Statement,\nalthough not for the reasons that Cohen claimed.\nThe eagle-eyed Taylor had noticed that the penalty\nupdates covering the inflation of the last 50 years in the pre-\nClacton Criminal Justice Act had overlooked Section 14 of\nthe 1914 Criminal Justice Administration Act (Hansard,\nHOC, June 4, 1964). That meant that magistrates were still\nrestricted to the \u00a320 compensation limit set in 1914, under-\nmining the parliamentary preference for solution by restitu-\ntion and justifying the resort towns' indignation that the law\nwas not tough enough. Being unaware of the oversight when\nhe declared that the existing law was adequate, Brooke apol-\nogized for that drafting error and announced that he would\nraise the penalty and compensation level for acts of vandal-\nism to \u00a3100 each, matching the other previous updates.\nHowever, by also taking the opportunity to repeat his vehe-\nment opposition to further legislation, the home secretary\nalso demonstrated that he never changed his mind (Hansard,\nAs the parliamentary record proves that the Malicious\nDamage Bill was merely an amendment correcting a drafting\noversight in a pre-Clacton act, and had nothing to do with\nCohen's convoluted reasoning about emergency measures,\n\"aligning with angels,\" or attempts to \"calm things down\", it\ndemonstrates how far Cohen's analysis of the whole affair is\ndivorced from reality, and as the real reason for the act\nappears in his PhD, it raises awkward questions about all\nthose other omissions.\nFar from embracing the media inventory, as every MP\nagreed that the oversight had to be resolved, there was no\n\"debate\" over the Malicious Damage Bill at all. Instead, they\nused the opportunity to bury the media inventory and dismiss\nthe law and order agenda by drawing a clear distinction\nbetween the Mods and Rockers and real delinquents. As far\nas Brooke was concerned, the youths' only crime was to\nhave allowed their high spirits to provide cover for a few\nhard-core hooligans, and that \"reassure\" comment that\nCohen exploited concerned reassuring anyone worried about\ninvasions that the law was adequate as he had claimed it was\nbecause the oversight was being addressed (Hansard, HOC,\nattacked the \"law and order\" lobby.

He debunked the\nmedia claim that the Mods and Rockers were a serious prob-\nlem by pointing out that the casualty departments in the\nresort towns had remained empty, and then argued that\nbecause these \"exuberant types on holiday\" were not even\ndelinquent, they \"need to be treated differently.\" After pay-\ning compensation, \"that was where the matter should end\"--\nnot that Paget was going to stop there, because when it came\nto Mods and Rockers, he believed that the real offenders\nwere the resort town magistrates:\nThese young chaps must pay for the damage they do.\n. . . But I deplore the idea adopted by some magistrates\nand canvassed and applauded in the newspapers of\nsending young men of this sort to prison. That is a\nlamentable answer to this sort of performance. We\nhave also had hysterical observations about Sawdust\nCaesars.These people are nothing of the sort.

The nearest one\nwho gets to Cohen's inference about the debate was Teeling,\nwho hoped that the amendment meant that the invaders\nwould get an \"unpleasant surprise\" if they were caught van-\ndalizing Brighton again. Otherwise, Rees-Davis merely\nrecorded their appearance in Margate, Fitch wished that the\nRockers would engage in charity rides on their bikes,\nMorrison explained that he was \"full of admiration\" for the\nyounger generation, Prentice wanted to record that \"it is a\nrather a brave thing to be a rocker\" given they were so out-\nnumbered, Gardner made distinctions between criminals and\nthe beach invaders, and Paget pointed out that as young men\nwere always fighting among themselves, the disturbances\nwere nothing new or unusual and did not amount to\ncriminality.\nMaking Sense of PanicTheory\nAs the omitted historical evidence clearly undermines\nCohen's account, Folk Devils is far more misleading than\nthe contemporary media reports. As we have demonstrated\nelsewhere, as the same critique applies to five other seminal\nU.K. moral panics, the paradigm has created a completely\nfalse picture of British society since the 1970s (Thompson &\nWilliams, 2012). In Cohen's case, far from being swept up\nin a societal-wide moral panic directed at the Mods and\nRockers, the public, the opinion formers, the moral entrepre-\nneurs, and the parliamentarians not only dismissed the hor-\nror headlines but also denounced them. By 1964, British\nsociety was so divided over \"the way things were going\"\nthat common agreement on anything was impossible.\nThe most generous explanation we can offer for the lack\nof evidential integrity in Folk Devils is that it reflects Cohen's\ndetermination to impose U.S. theories on circumstances that\ncould not support them. Although the U.K. delinquency\ndebate echoed that seen in the United States between 1950\nand 1961, U.S. sociologists could justify their claim that\ndelinquency was a social construction because it reflected a\nstatus \"crime wave\" caused by altering the age at which\nteens could access adult pleasures, such as the drinking age\n(Gilbert, 1986). Hard-core hooligans in the United Kingdom,\nhowever, managed to generate an increase in mass hooligan-\nism and destructive vandalism without any societal encour-\nagement--hence the divergence between U.S. theory and\nBritish experience, such as the alleged power of the press to\nstigmatize and the overemphasis on the supposed projecting\ngang membership on miscellaneous youths, which Cohen\ntook from Wilkin and Yablonski, respectively (Cohen, 1969)\nAs the initial Clacton reaction reflected the existing media\nframes about vandalism and hooliganism, and the coverage\nabout nonevents only appeared over the bank holiday week-\nends at a handful of resorts during the short U.K. summer\nseason, the media furor over Mods and Rockers is a perfect\nexample of the \"silly season,\" when news stories become\neven more overblown than usual because the sources of most\nhard news, from the Royal Courts to Parliament close down\nfor summer vacations. Nothing more.\nWhen we first drew attention to the core weakness of the\nuncritical promotion in the United States was dismissed on\nthe grounds that \"it couldn't happen here,\" but it has. This\ndemonstration of the failings of the original definition makes\nit imperative to question the generic description and the\n\"new, improved\" U.S. variant given that neither can distin-\nguish between a moral panic and any other kind of adverse\nreaction to social groups or phenomenon. Unless one consid-\ners the real similarities and differences between moral panics\nand the alternative U.S. models rather than treat them as\nsimiles (Goode & Ben-Yehuda, 1994), the potential political\nramifications in the next decade could be far more costly\nthan its existing effects on academic standards.\nBy maintaining Cohen's simplistic division of the world\ninto progressives and reactionaries, omitting vital counter-\nvailing evidence, while misreporting, distorting, and exag-\ngerating what remains, the panic paradigm has constantly\nmisled its readers regarding \"the way society is going.\" In\nthis case, Cohen failed to consider how during the 1960s\nU.K. Christians--in the professional sample, among the\nmoral entrepreneurs, and parliamentarians--acted as a bul-\nwark against the law and order lobby. When one's analysis of\nevents can be so wrong, the political response is unlikely to\nsecure its intent. As we first attempted to warn the United\nStates that the need to critique panic theory was more than an\nacademic dispute (Thompson, 1989), events have confirmed\nour fears (Thompson & Williams, 2012). It is no accident\nthat the increasing popularity of the panic paradigm with its\nmismatch between theory and reality has run parallel with\nthe alienation between progressives and the working classes\nin the United Kingdom, with disastrous results (Jones, 2011;\nWaiton, 2008). With the United States at the cross roads, its\ntime the panic paradigm here paid attention to Pally's (2011)\nrevelations about U.S. evangelicals too.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBecker, H.
