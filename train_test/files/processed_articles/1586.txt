Epidemiologic studies have consistently indicated that Gulf War veterans report\nunexplained symptoms at significantly higher rates than veteran comparison groups but that they have not\nexperienced excess rates of disease-related mortality. Addressing unanswered questions surrounding post-Gulf-\nWar health problems presents a complex challenge for researchers, but not an insurmountable one. Progress in\nunderstanding the role of potential etiologic factors can be made using epidemiologic approaches traditionally\napplied in the absence of individual exposure data, such as comparisons between veteran subgroups with\nmorbidity; mortality; pathological conditions, signs and symptoms; Persian Gulf syndrome; veterans\nReceived for publication May 11, 2001, and accepted for publica-\nFrom the Kansas Commission on Veterans Affairs, 700 SW\nDr. Lea Steele at this address).\nIn the decade since the Persian Gulf War, the health prob-\nlems reported by returning veterans have been a source of\ncontention and controversy (1\u00ad4). Much of the controversy\nhas related to questions about the nature and causes of these\nailments. Early discussion focused on whether the condi-\ntions were organic or psychological, a result of stress or of\ntoxic exposures (5\u00ad7). More recently, debate has shifted to\nthe existence of a unique \"Gulf War syndrome\" (8, 9) and\nwhether these unexplained symptoms should be considered\nprimarily part of a general phenomenon that occurs after\nevery war or a consequence of events and exposures unique\nEpidemiologic investigations have made progress in iden-\ntifying some of the \"harder\" post-Gulf-War health out-\ncomes--that is, outcomes that can be objectively assessed\nand quantified, such as mortality and hospitalization rates.\nLess progress has been made in characterizing the \"softer\"\nendpoints--the many symptoms reported by Gulf War vet-\nerans that are often unaccompanied by observable signs or\nlaboratory abnormalities.\nWhat do we know about the health of Gulf War\nveterans?\nThe article by Kang and Bullman (12) in this issue of the\nJournal compares mortality rates between Gulf War veter-\nans and Gulf-War-era veterans who did not serve in the war.\nAfter 7 years of follow-up, no association was found\nbetween disease-related deaths and either Gulf War service\noverall or proximity to the Khamisiyah weapons demolition\nsite in Iraq. Another key finding is that Gulf War veterans\nhave not experienced excess rates of death due to cancer or\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although this cohort will have\nto be followed for many more years to monitor mortality\ndue to conditions that develop over longer latency periods.\nHigher rates of mortality from accidents but not from dis-\nease have been reported among Gulf War veterans in the\nUnited Kingdom (13). In addition, studies have identified\nfew differences in hospitalization rates between Gulf War\nveterans and non-Gulf veterans in the years since the war\nA different picture of veterans' post-Gulf-War health sta-\ntus is provided by another body of epidemiologic research.\nPopulation-based studies have consistently shown that Gulf\nveterans have an unexpectedly high level of morbidity, as\ncharacterized by self-reported symptomatology and diag-\nnosed medical and psychiatric conditions (17\u00ad26). Overall,\nthe types of symptoms reported by different veteran groups\nare strikingly similar, even though veterans in these studies\ncame from different countries and served in different areas of\nthe Persian Gulf theater. Gulf War veterans, as a group, are\nsignificantly more symptomatic than nondeployed Gulf-\ndeployed to other areas of the world (18), and veterans who\nserved in the war in Bosnia (22). Among Gulf War veterans,\nthe prevalences of symptoms and multisymptom complexes\nare frequently associated with specific self-reported wartime\ncally have few abnormalities on routine clinical examinations\nand laboratory tests (21, 33), although preliminary studies\nhave identified group differences in neurologic and immune\nparameters (34\u00ad40). Additionally, Gulf veterans score lower\nthan comparison groups on standardized tests assessing\nUnexplained Health Problems after Gulf War Service 407\nStudies have also indicated that, while some Gulf veter-\nans are affected by psychiatric conditions, including post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, the increased morbidity observed\namong Gulf War veterans cannot be adequately accounted\nfor by deployment stress and psychiatric illness (28, 42, 43).\nThis is not surprising, given the brief and decisive nature of\nthe Gulf War. Over 70 percent of veterans deployed to the\nregion were not involved in combat and did not witness any\nTo summarize, with respect to post-Gulf-War health prob-\nlems, two facts have been consistently demonstrated: 1) Gulf\nWar veterans, as a group, have not been unduly affected by\nadverse health outcomes associated with \"hard\" measures,\nsuch as rates of hospitalization and disease-related mortality;\nand 2) Gulf War veterans, as a group, have consistently been\nshown to be more symptomatic and debilitated than non-\nGulf-War veterans. The obvious conclusion to draw from\nthese two facts is that, whatever the nature of the health prob-\nlems affecting Gulf War veterans, they do not currently\nappear to be of the type that generally results in hospitaliza-\ntion or premature death.\nBeyond these main points, not much more is actually\nknown about post-Gulf-War health problems. Most other\nessential information regarding these problems remains\nunknown or unverified. At the population level, basic epi-\ndemiologic parameters, including prevalence, population\ndistribution, and etiologic and risk factors have yet to be\nclearly elucidated. Clinically, pathophysiologic mechanisms\nand diagnostic markers have not been identified, nor have\nefficacious medical therapies been demonstrated, although\ntwo clinical trials are currently under way. Why has so little\nprogress been made, despite numerous studies and a federal\nresearch investment that now exceeds $155 million (44)?\nThere are several reasons, some obvious, others less so.\nComplex illnesses are difficult to study\nThe most obvious reason for the lack of progress in iden-\ntifying the basic epidemiologic parameters of post-Gulf-War\nhealth problems is the challenge inherent in investigating ill-\nness that is identified almost solely on the basis of subjec-\ntive symptoms. Moreover, many believe that \"Gulf War ill-\nness\" would more accurately be termed \"Gulf War illnesses\"\n(45), since symptom profiles vary from person to person.\nAdd to that the appearance that these problems are multi-\nfactorial in origin--that is, that they may have been precip-\nitated by several factors, either alone or in different combi-\nnations--and the situation is enough to give an\nepidemiologist pause.\nThe less obvious impediments to progress may include\nblind alleys generated in attempts to make sense out of this\ncomplex illness phenomenon. As with any new area of med-\nical inquiry, useful answers can emerge only when we are\nable to ask the right questions.\nIs there a Gulf War syndrome?\n\"Is there a unique Gulf War syndrome?\" has been identi-\nfied as the central health question following Operation Desert\nStorm (46) and has been the subject of a number of research\nthis question is worth answering, it is not the fundamental\nquestion at issue. Addressing it as the primary question, in\neffect, puts the cart before the horse. The more essential\nquestion can be phrased \"Are veterans of the Gulf War\naffected by chronic health problems associated with their\nservice in the war?\" If that question can be clearly answered\nand if, as population studies have suggested, the answer\nappears to be yes, the most immediate follow-up questions\nwould relate to the symptomatic, physiologic, and psycho-\nlogical characteristics of these health problems and to\nfactors associated with their etiology. Only after these ques-\ntions have been addressed can we begin to determine\nwhether we are looking at one syndrome or more and\nwhether these syndromes are distinct from previously iden-\ntified conditions.\nRecent observations on whether post-Gulf-War health\nproblems constitute a unique syndrome have relied on the\nresults of exploratory factor analyses. In these analyses,\ngeneral lists of symptoms reported by large, heterogeneous\ngroups of Gulf War veterans have been found to load onto\nfactors similar to those found in non-Gulf veterans (47\u00ad49).\nThe question remains, however, as to whether factor analy-\nsis is a suitable tool for determining the presence or absence\nof a unique syndrome in a given population.\nIt would be appealing to simply subject all the symptoms\nreported by a population to a relatively straightforward\nanalysis that would allow any \"new\" syndromes to reveal\nthemselves as constructs. Unfortunately, this is not what one\nwould expect from an exploratory factor analysis of symp-\ntoms. The explanation as to why this is so requires an under-\nstanding of what factor analysis is and what the factors in a\ngiven analysis actually represent. An excellent description\nof these considerations was provided by renowned psycho-\nmetrician Dr. Stanley Mulaik in his presentation at the 1998\nConference on Federally Sponsored Gulf War Veterans'\nIllnesses Research (50). Pointing out that \"factors are not\nsyndromes,\" he cautioned investigators that exploratory fac-\ntor analyses are unlikely to reveal novel symptom patterns,\nespecially when relying exclusively on first-order factors.\nFactors expected from such analyses would be those\nassociated with pathology or distress in particular organs or\nsystems. Such factors would probably be similar in any het-\nerogeneous population, even those including individuals\nwith different chronic diseases precipitated by different eti-\nologic factors. In other words, comparing the results of\nexploratory factor analyses of symptoms endorsed by Gulf\nWar and non-Gulf-War veterans would not be expected to\nidentify a unique \"Gulf War syndrome,\" regardless of\nwhether veterans are affected by excess morbidity or dis-\ntinct pathologies as a result of their Gulf War service.\nCan these questions be answered?\nSuggestions for epidemiologic research\nBecause wartime exposure data are not available for indi-\nvidual veterans, there have been suggestions that we might\nnever know what caused these problems or, by extension,\ntheir physiologic mechanisms (6, 51). However, epidemio-\nlogic methods are particularly well-suited to providing clues\nthat generate specific hypotheses about disease etiology,\neven when individual exposure data cannot be obtained. It is\ntherefore surprising that epidemiologic methods tradition-\nally used to investigate unknown diseases potentially caused\nby environmental factors have scarcely been applied to the\nGulf War illness question. Epidemiologists generally begin\ninvestigations of unknown diseases by first generating a\ndescription of the illness and then delineating its distribution\nin a given population according to characteristics of person,\nplace, and time. This classic approach has proven useful in\na study of Kansas Gulf War veterans, where a defined symp-\ntom pattern was found to be strongly associated with the\nplaces and time periods in which veterans had served in the\nPersian Gulf theater (25).\nProgress in understanding whether environmental expo-\nsures might have contributed to veterans' illnesses can be\nmade by conducting epidemiologic studies that compare\nsymptom profiles of well-defined veteran subgroups (52,\n53). Veterans may be grouped in any number of ways (e.g.,\nby unit or location). If, for example, veterans in Unit A\nhave a high rate of a defined symptom complex but veter-\nans in Unit B have a low rate, differences in deployment\nexperiences and circumstances between the two groups\nshould provide important insights about possible etiologic\nfactors.\nAssociations between illness and location in the Persian\nGulf theater have been described in unpublished studies\nconducted by researchers from the Department of\nVeterans Affairs (54), in a Congressional report on in-\ntheater locations of veterans filing disability claims (55),\nMarine Gulf veterans conducted in March 1991, Navy\ninvestigators defined three exposure groups according to\nunit locations in the preceding months. The study found\nthat the group of veterans who had been closest to oil well\nfires for the longest period of time had significantly more\nrespiratory symptoms (wheezing, cough, runny nose, sore\nthroat) and gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, stomach\ncramps, nausea, vomiting) than did veterans stationed in\nother locations (56). This early study shows that differ-\nences in the frequencies and patterns of symptoms by time\nand place can be and have been identified and can provide\nuseful information, even when individual exposure data\nare unavailable.\nAnother urgent requirement for progress in both epidemi-\nologic and clinical investigations is a consensus definition\nof what constitutes a Gulf War illness \"case.\" Arriving at\nsuch a definition may be a difficult challenge in a commu-\nnity of researchers divided about whether a Gulf War illness\nproblem even exists; yet we know that Gulf War veterans, as\na group, endorse symptoms in several categories at higher\nfrequencies than do individuals in comparison populations.\nThis excess morbidity can be described and quantified (57).\nWithout a standardized case definition, investigators will\ncontinue to identify different groups of symptomatic veter-\nans as \"cases,\" which will result in findings that are difficult\nto interpret and impossible to compare.\nConclusions\nAnswering fundamental questions about the health prob-\nlems reported in the wake of Gulf War service poses a com-\nplex challenge for researchers, but not an insurmountable\none. At this stage of our understanding, one of the plausible\nexplanations for the Gulf War illness mystery is that, as one\nGulf veteran put it, \"Something happened to us out there in\nthe desert\" (58). Whatever that something might have been,\nit is too early to pronounce these questions unanswerable.\nThis is especially so when epidemiologic approaches that\nhave the potential to provide basic etiologic information\nhave yet to be fully utilized.\n"
