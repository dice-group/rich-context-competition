Highly integrated EMR systems such as\nEpicCare are used for decision support, order sets,\nas well as generating reports and documentation.3\nA rich literature has investigated the relationship\nbetween features of these systems and health\noutcomes. Although not all results are positive,4\nmuch research has shown the value of an EMR\nsystem in improving physicians' behavior and per-\nformance in drug prescribing, dosing, avoiding\nmedication errors, and managing chronic condi-\ntions.5 6 EMR systems are designed to aid practi-\ntioners working with patients who require complex\ncoordination of care such as in the cardiovascular\ntherapeutic area. Previous research has documented\nthe effectiveness of EMR systems in lipid and chol-\nesterol management,7 encouraging the adoption of\nEMR systems among cardiologists.8\nIn the area of women's health, one study\nreported that physician compliance in providing\npreventive care improved when computer remin-\nders for mammography, Papanicolaou (Pap) tests,\nand fecal occult blood testing were provided.9\nElectronic reminders for mammography screenings\nwere also reported to be useful in providing early\npreventive care to women with a high risk of\nbreast cancer.10 A randomized trial reported that\npatient-specific postfracture advice, for patients\nwith osteoporosis, to the medical care provider by\nway of an EMR system reminder, significantly\nincreased bone mineral density (BMD) measure-\nment and medication, and was nine times more\neffective than usual care.11\nMost of the literature to date has reported on\nrelationships between individual system features\nand health outcomes in small-scale settings, limit-\ning interested providers' ability to generalize\nthe results. There are a few exceptions. According\nto an EMR report prepared by the Healthcare\nInformation and Management Systems Society, an\nincrease in the sophistication of an EMR system led\nto higher healthcare quality indicator scores as\ndeveloped by the Agency for Healthcare Research\nand Quality.12 Moreover, Furakawa13 showed that a\nfully functional EMR system, one with more than\nbasic functionality, realized an improvement in ED\nefficiency. However, it is unknown whether EMR\nsystem sophistication will also generate better care\nfor patients seeing office-based physicians for pre-\nventive healthcare. Using a national database and\nadvanced statistical techniques, this study investi-\ngated the relationship between the level of EMR\nsystem sophistication and 11 different health out-\ncomes in the area of preventive healthcare for\nwomen across the USA over a 2-year period.\nMETHODS\nData source\nThe database used was the publicly available\nNational Ambulatory Medical Care Survey\nResearch and Applications\nNAMCS contains survey data collected by the National Center\nof Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, at the individual patient visit level. The survey\nsample covers US non-federally employed physicians who are\nprimarily engaged in office-based patient care as classified by the\nAmerican Medical Association or the American Osteopathic\nAssociation. The NAMCS utilizes a multistage probability\ndesign for selection of its sample that involves physician prac-\ntices within primary sample units and then patient visits within\npractices. The first-stage sampling involves primary sample\nunits composed of counties, groups of counties, and county\nequivalents. The second-stage sample consists of a probability\nsample of practising physicians classified by their specialties.\nThe final stage consists of patient visits selected through sys-\ntematic random selection. Physicians, their staff, or field agents\nfrom the US Bureau of the Census performed the actual data\ncollection. The NAMCS data generate national estimates by\nusing either visit or provider weights. At the time of this study,\ndata were pooled over the 2 years. Data for the dependent vari-\nables described below were obtained from responses to `yes/no'\nquestions regarding whether a particular test or service was\nordered or provided during a visit. The NAMCS database is\nde-identified and publicly accessible, and, therefore, was exempt\nfrom review by the institutional review board at the University\nof Cincinnati.\nVisit selection\nA visit was selected if it was for a woman aged 21 years or\nolder, and a provider was included if he or she had at least one\nvisit by a woman aged 21 years or older. According to the\nguidelines for preventive women's healthcare, developed by the\nOffice on Women's Health, specific tests and examinations\nrecommended depend on the age of the patient. Although a\nfew tests (such as for chlamydia) are recommended for women\nyounger than 21 years, the majority of preventive services are\nDependent variables\nEleven dependent variables, constructed at the provider level\nthe guidelines issued by the Office on Women's Health,14 and\ndata availability:\n1. Number of breast examinations ordered or provided;\n2. Number of pelvic examinations ordered or provided;\n3. Number of Pap tests ordered or provided;\n4. Number of chlamydia tests ordered or provided;\n5. Number of cholesterol tests ordered or provided;\n6. Number of blood pressure (BP) tests ordered or provided;\n7. Number of mammography tests ordered or provided;\n8. Number of BMD imaging tests ordered or provided;\n9. Number of seasonal flu vaccinations ordered or provided;\n10. Number of visits including education on nutrition and\ndiet;\n11. Number of visits including education on exercise.\nIndependent variables\nThe key independent variable was the level of EMR system\n`yes/no' questions (primary questions plus follow-up ques-\ntions) on the provider's EMR system relating to 16 different\nfeatures of the system. Based on these questions, the level of\nsophistication of the system was categorized as one of the fol-\nlowing: no EMR system; minimal EMR system; basic EMR\nsystem; or fully functional EMR system, consistent with the\nfour-way classification developed by health-information\nexperts.15 The highest frequencies were found for the following\nfour functions: patient demographics; laboratory results;\nimaging results; and clinical notes (see figure 1). We considered\nthem basic functions for the purposes of the analysis. If a\nsystem had one to three of these functions, we classified it as a\nminimal system. Whereas, in Furukawa,13 computerized orders\nfor tests and prescriptions were also considered to be basic\nfunctions for EDs, their frequencies were sufficiently lower\nthan the other four for physician offices that they were consid-\nered more advanced features in this study's context. To be con-\nsidered a basic system, the system had to have all four of the\nbasic functions. The most frequently observed advanced fea-\ntures of basic systems were orders for prescriptions, orders for\ntests, out of range levels highlighted on laboratory results, and\nmedical history/follow-up notes accompanying clinical notes. A\nfully functional EMR system had at least the four basic func-\ntions as well as at least 10 additional functions, bringing func-\ntionality up to between 14 and 16 functions. Each of the first\n14 functions (all but public health reporting and electronic\nnotification) was a feature of at least 90% of all fully functional\nsystems, with the four basic functions a part of 100% of those\nsystems.\nBecause of the potential for endogeneity bias (progressive\nproviders might provide both fully functional EMR systems\nand high-quality women's preventive healthcare), we selected\ntwo instrumental variables as independent variables: (1)\nFigure 1 Frequency of functions in\nelectronic medical record (EMR)\nsystems in US physician offices in\nfor Disease Control and Prevention.\nNAMCS Electronic Medical Records\ncdc.gov/nchs/data/ahcd/\nResearch and Applications\nwhether the EMR system included public health reporting but\ndid not send electronic disease notifications, and (2) whether\nthe EMR system included both public health reporting and\nelectronic disease notifications. These two instrumental vari-\nables were used by Furukawa13 and were appealing because of\ntheir expected correlation with EMR system sophistication but\nnot with women's health outcomes. Additional instrumental\nvariables were also considered, but ultimately rejected due to\nreduction in model goodness of fit.\nCovariates included both provider and patient characteristics.\nWhereas the provider variables were included in both first and\nsecond-stage regressions (discussed below), patient characteris-\ntics were included only in the second stage. Provider character-\nistics included type of office setting (private practice, clinic,\ncommunity health center, health maintenance organization\n(HMO), and so forth); solo or group practice; practice owner-\nship (physician group, hospital, healthcare corporation, etc);\nwhether laboratory testing was performed at the office; phys-\nician specialty (general and family practice, internal medicine,\nurology, psychiatry, etc); region of the country (northeast,\nmidwest, south, or west); and location (in a metropolitan stat-\nistical area or not). Patient characteristics included the total\nnumber of visits by women; the percentage of patients falling\nand older), race (white, African American, Asian, and other),\nincome categories, and payer (Medicaid, Medicare, private\ninsurance or other) categories.\nStatistical analyses\nFirst, we described the distribution of EMR system types (no\nEMR, minimal, basic, or fully functional) overall as well as\nstratified by provider characteristics. We then described the\nfrequency and rates of the 11 preventive women's healthcare\nmeasures both overall and across the four EMR system types.\nRates were calculated by dividing the frequencies of preventive\nmeasures by the estimated number of women visiting providers\nwith different levels of EMR sophistication.\nIn the first stage of a two-stage residual-inclusion model, an\nordered probit regression was estimated to model the level of\nEMR system sophistication. Independent variables included the\nprovider covariates discussed above along with the two instru-\nmental variables. Over-identification tests were conducted to\nconfirm the exogeneity of the latter variables. Estimated mar-\nginal probabilities showed the estimated rise or fall in the prob-\nability of the EMR system's being non-existent, minimal, basic,\nor fully functional.\nThe second stage involved 11 separate Poisson regressions--\none for each of the women's healthcare measures listed above.\nFor these regressions, the independent variables included pro-\nvider characteristics, patient characteristics, three binary vari-\nables indicating minimal, basic, and fully functional EMR\nsystem (with `no EMR system' as the reference category), and\nthe residuals from the first regression if their estimated coeffi-\ncient in the second stage was statistically significant at the 5%\nlevel (as it was in the BP regression only).\nStatistical analyses were performed using STATA 11. They\nwere conducted using the survey (svy) set in STATA that takes\ninto account the complex survey design of NAMCS and allows\nthe use of weights, strata, and clusters.\nRESULTS\nAcross providers of preventive women's healthcare in 2007\u00ad8,\nTable 1 Number of women's healthcare providers by level of EMR system sophistication stratifiedby selected* provider characteristics: summed\nNo EMR system Minimal EMR system Basic EMR system Fully functional EMR system\nProvider characteristic Frequency (SD) % of systems Frequency (SD) % of systems Frequency (SD) % of systems Frequency (SD) % of systems\nOffice type\nSolo or group practice\nLaboratory testing performed at office\nPhysician specialty\nRegion\nMetropolitan statistical area\n*Not all office types and specialty types are listed.

Across practice types (some results not\nshown), HMOs were the most advanced, with 74.68% of\nHMO providers having either a basic or fully functional\nsystem. Group practices, relative to solo practices, had a distri-\nbution favoring higher levels of sophistication. Similarly, provi-\nders with laboratory testing capability had a distribution\nfavoring higher levels of sophistication relative to those\nwithout. The three physician specialties (general and family\npractice, internal medicine, and obstetrics/gynecology) expected\nto provide the most preventive healthcare to women had\nsophistication distributions similar to the all-provider distribu-\ntion. In general and family practice, there was a slightly higher\nlevel of sophistication, with 7.07% of providers working with\nfully functional systems, and 18.40% with basic systems (vs\ntrics and gynecology, 18.51% of practices had basic systems,\nalthough only 5.15% worked with fully functional EMR\nsystems. Compared to the women's health specialties, cardio-\nvascular disease specialists and urologists had a much higher\npercentage of basic plus fully functional systems, while psy-\nchiatrists and dermatologists had much lower percentages of\nmore sophisticated systems (results not shown). The west, fol-\nlowed by the midwest, had the highest percentages of basic\nand fully functional systems. Little difference in EMR system\ndistribution was observed between urban and more rural areas.\nThe results presented in table 2 indicate a relationship\nbetween EMR system sophistication and the rate at which\ncertain preventive women's healthcare measures were ordered or\n21 years and older were provided or ordered a breast examin-\nation. However, for the women whose visits were to providers\nwithout EMR systems, that percentage was 20.3%. For minimal,\nbasic, and fully functional systems, respectively, the breast\npelvic examinations increased similarly, from 28.4% to 45.8%, as\nthe degree of EMR system functionality rose from minimal to\nfull. The rate of exercise counseling rose from 16.9% to 33.4%\nminimal, to basic, to full. For all women's health measures,\nexcept for chlamydia testing and the seasonal flu vaccination,\nproviders with no EMR systems had the lowest rates. For chla-\nmydia testing and vaccination, there was little difference in rates\nby degree of system functionality up through basic systems.\nFully functional systems were associated with higher rates of\nprovision or prescription.\nTable 3 reports estimated marginal probabilities from the\nordered probit regression. Relative to the reference group of\nprivate practice, the probability of having either a basic or fully\nfunctional EMR system by an HMO practice was significantly\n(p<0.01) higher, whereas the probability of having either no\nEMR or a minimal system was significantly (p<0.01) lower.\nSolo practices, relative to group practices, were less likely\n(p<0.01) to have basic and fully functional systems and more\nlikely (p<0.01) to have no EMR system in place. The two\nhigher levels of system functionality were also associated\n(p<0.01) with the ability to have laboratory testing done at\nthe office. Compared to the physician specialty reference group\nof cardiovascular disease physicians, the three women's health\nspecialties had lower estimated probabilities (p<0.01 often) of\nhaving a basic or fully functional system and a higher probabil-\nity (p<0.01) of having no EMR system at all. Only for general\nsurgery, orthopedic surgery, urology, and otolaryngology, was\nthere no statistically significant difference relative to the cardio-\nvascular specialty (results not shown). The two instrumental\nvariables had statistically significant (p<0.01) marginal prob-\nabilities across the functionality distribution. Both increased\n(p<0.01) the probability of basic or full functionality, whereas\nboth decreased (p<0.01) the probability of no or minimal func-\ntionality. Whereas having one of the advanced functions\nincreased the probability of a basic system more than that of a\nfully functional one, having both of the advanced functions did\nthe opposite. Using Hansen's J test for exogeneity, the exogene-\nity of the instrumental variables could not be rejected at the\n5% significance level.\nSecond-stage regression results, including estimated coeffi-\ncients and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the EMR sophistica-\ntion levels, are presented in table 4. (A full set of estimated\nIRRs is available in Appendix 1.) For seven of the 11 healthcare\noutcomes studied, the presence of some type of EMR system\nwas important. Relative to no EMR system, utilization of\nTable 2 Number of women's healthcare measures (in millions) ordered or provided by level of EMR system sophistication: summed 2007 and 2008\nfrequencies with standard deviations in parentheses\nTotals No EMR system Minimal EMR system Basic EMR system\nFully functional EMR\nsystem\nWomen's healthcare\nmeasure\nFrequency\n(SD)\nPer\nwoman*\nFrequency\n(SD)\nPer\nwoman*\nFrequency\n(SD)\nPer\nwoman*\nFrequency\n(SD)\nPer\nwoman*\nFrequency\n(SD)\nPer\nwoman*\nDiet/nutrition\ncounseling\n*Except for mammography and bone density testing, women aged 20 years or older (226.8 million over 2 years) were considered as the denominator for the calculation. For mammography,\nwomen aged 40 years or older (145.5 million) were considered; for bone density testing, women aged 50 years or older (100.6 million) were counted. For all measures, the denominator was\ntaken as the sum over the years 2007 and 2008. For the third column, values were taken directly from the Census. For columns 5, 7, 9, and 11, estimates were obtained using column 3\nfigures and the percentages from the all-provider row in Table 1.\nEMR, electronic medical record.\nResearch and Applications\nbreast examinations, pelvic examinations, mammography, chla-\nmydia testing, and cholesterol testing increased significantly,\neven for a minimal EMR system. Moreover, as the degree of\nfunctionality increased from minimal to basic to full, the IRR\nsystem. For cholesterol tests, the IRR was estimated at 1.07\naddition, greater functionality increased the number of Pap\nIRR=1.34, p<0.05, for basic systems). For BMD testing, a fully\nfunctional system had an estimated 6.48 IRR (p<0.01) relative\nto no system. For BP testing, flu vaccination, diet and nutrition\ncounseling, and exercise counseling, there was no statistical evi-\ndence supporting the causal importance of an EMR system.\nTable 3 Selected* first-stage estimated marginal probabilities from ordered probit regression analysis\nNo EMR system Minimal EMR system Basic EMR system Fully functional EMR system\nProvider characteristic\nMarginal\nprobability\nStandard\nerror\nMarginal\nprobability\nStandard\nerror\nMarginal\nprobability\nStandard\nerror\nMarginal\nprobability\nStandard\nerror\nPhysician specialty\nRegion\nOwner type\nInstruments\nPublic health reporting without\nelectronic notification\nPublic health reporting and\nelectronic notification\n*Not all office types and specialty types are listed.

Except for the blood pressure regression, the estimated coefficient on the residual variable was not statistically significant, so we could not reject exogeneity. Only in the\nblood pressure regression was exogeneity rejected (p<0.05). In this case, the first-stage residuals were kept in the second-stage regression to ensure unbiased estimates.\nEMR, electronic medical record; IRR, incidence rate ratio.\nResearch and Applications\nThe number of examinations of various types clearly\ndepends on physician specialty. The highest estimated IRRs for\nbreast examinations are found for family, internal medicine,\nand dermatology practitioners (Appendix 1). However, esti-\nmated IRRs depend both on the type and size of practice.\nAlthough the results indicate that almost all specialties (all but\nurology) have a significantly higher IRR for a BP test than car-\ndiology, the interpretation would most likely be that the\npatient-to-provider ratio is smaller for cardiology than for other\nspecialties. There also seems to be some regional variation in\nwomen's health outcomes. The northeast, midwest, and south\nall had statistically significantly lower rates, than the west, for\nboth Pap tests and BMD tests. The IRR for mammograms in\nthe south exceeded (p<0.05) that in the west. Of course, the\nfrequency of visits by women had a statistically significant\n(p<0.01) effect on the total number of tests, examinations, or\ncounseling sessions that occurred. Patients on Medicaid were\nmore likely (p<0.01) to receive counseling on diet and nutri-\ntion, relative to privately insured individuals, and less likely\n(p<0.05) to receive counseling on exercise.\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, only one previous study specifically linking\nEMR system sophistication and healthcare outcomes has been\nundertaken. Whereas Furukawa13 was unable to find a direct\nstatistical relationship between having a basic system and ED\nefficiency, as captured by a number of different metrics (length\nof stay in the ED, wait time to see a physician, diagnosis and\ntreatment time, and leaving without treatment), this study\nfound a statistically significant effect of a basic system for five\nof the women's healthcare measures considered. Moreover,\nthere were no puzzling, statistically significant inverse relation-\nships between basic systems and outcomes, as Furukawa13\nfound. Furthermore, because we distinguished between no\nEMR system and a minimal system, we could conclude that a\nstatistically significant relationship existed between a minimal\nEMR system and health outcomes for five out of 11 measures;\nhaving a few functions was `better than' none.\nThe results from this study are consistent with earlier ana-\nlyses of the relationship between women's healthcare measures\nand EMR system features. For example, in this study, the esti-\nproviders with EMR systems compared to those without. An\nearlier study found a difference of 27% in mammograms\nbetween sites with and without an EMR system.16 Moreover,\nwe found a statistically significant association between having\na basic EMR system and Pap tests (p<0.05) and mammograms\n(p<0.10) ordered or provided, consistent with a previous\nfinding that reported an increase in visits by women to gyne-\ncologists by 5% for mammograms and 7% for Pap tests with\nthe use of electronic prompts.17 The fact that the estimated\nIRR for mammograms falls with the level of system sophistica-\ntion is interesting. Whereas the demographic information avail-\nable even in the minimal system may be important for\nwhether a mammogram is ordered, the higher-level functions,\nsuch as electronic reminders, may not be that important now\nfor a test for which high awareness and low cost may facilitate\nreasonable compliance regardless of physician involvement.18 19\nOur study showed a statistically significant estimated IRR\nfor fully functional EMR system sophistication with respect to\nbone density examinations ordered or provided. In fact, a fully\nfunctional system was associated with over six times the\nnumber of such tests relative to no EMR system, possibly due\nto the presence of specific BMD test-related electronic remin-\nders present in the fully functional systems. Previous studies\nhave reported the use of highly advanced electronic reminders\nand prompts in EMR systems for BMD checks in high-risk\nwomen and as intervention for prevention of fractures in post-\nmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Results and conclu-\nsions, however, have varied widely. A study that analyzed the\nelectronic reminder intervention for osteoporosis management\nreported that after a 6-month period, there was a 51.5%\nincrease in bone density checks.11 Another study reported just\na 3% increase in bone density checks after a 6-month period.20\nIn that study, physicians reported that the electronic reminder\nwas a distraction, not a helpful aid.20\nThe difference in results between tables 2 and 4 underscores\nthe importance of accounting for endogeneity bias and con-\nfounding factors in the delivery of preventive women's health-\ncare. The strong positive association between diet/nutrition\ncounseling and the degree of EMR system sophistication does\nnot hold up in table 4. The features of EMR systems (as listed\nin figure 1) would appear not to be particularly relevant for\ncounseling. The characteristics of patients and views of physi-\ncians are likely to be much more important than system cap-\nabilities.21 Furthermore, the positive relationship between BP\ntests and the degree of EMR system sophistication (table 2) is\nnot seen in table 4, in which EMR sophistication has no statis-\ntically significant effect on the number of BP tests. After con-\ntrolling for other provider and patient characteristics, it seems\nas though having an EMR system has no causal effect on\nwhether a BP test is performed. A BP test is a routine compo-\nnent of many physician office visits, unrelated to the existence\nor sophistication of a EMR system.22 Finally, there was no asso-\nciation between system sophistication and flu vaccines.\nSeasonal flu vaccines are offered in various venues, such as\nretail pharmacies, encouraging patients to rely less on physician\noffices.\nA major limitation of the NAMCS data was that they did\nnot distinguish between ordering or provision of an examin-\nation or test. It cannot be assumed that patients necessarily fol-\nlowed through with tests and examinations, let alone followed\nadvice on diet and exercise. Another limitation was the cross-\nsectional nature of the NAMCS database that prevented ana-\nlysis of the use of EMR systems over time. Physician response\nto EMR systems was not measured. Moreover, at the time of\nHowever, because of the fast-paced development and adoption\nof EMR system technology, the results of this study will\nbecome dated fairly quickly. Indeed, in 2011, it was reported by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics that 57% of office-\nbased physicians had an EMR system.23 Guidelines for\nwomen's health also change periodically depending on the\nlatest research findings.14 Furthermore, although we classified\nEMR systems as minimal, basic, or fully functional based on\nthe type and number of system features, we did not study the\nfeatures individually. Future work could determine which of\nthe advanced functions, for example, viewing imaging results\nor electronic orders, is the more important for women's health.\nIn particular, the feature `reminders for guideline-based inter-\nventions and/or screening tests' is likely to be extremely\nimportant for preventive women's health. Despite these limita-\ntions, however, we were able to account for endogeneity and\nconfounding factors and examined the effectiveness of EMR\nsystems in providing 11 different preventive healthcare mea-\nsures across a national sample of physicians.\nResearch and Applications\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of this study strongly suggest that EMR systems\nhave a positive impact on preventive women's healthcare. The\nuse of a national database along with advanced statistical tech-\nniques allow for confidence in this conclusion. For breast exam-\ninations, pelvic examinations, Pap tests, chlamydia tests,\ncholesterol tests, mammograms, and BMD tests, an EMR\nsystem increases the number of these tests and examinations\nprescribed or performed. Furthermore, the level of sophistica-\ntion increases the number of breast examinations, Pap tests,\nchlamydia tests, cholesterol tests, and, most significantly, BMD\ntests. This study may provide impetus for the specialists in\nwomen's health to consider investing in more sophisticated\nsystems.\nAn earlier version of this study was presented as an unpub-\nlished poster at the Annual Meeting of the International\nSociety for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research in\n"
