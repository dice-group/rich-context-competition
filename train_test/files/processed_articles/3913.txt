In addition, there\nare no data available regarding the sensitivity\nof CD8\u00feCD28\u00ad Tregs to cisplatin or\ngemcitabine.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate\nthe effect of gemcitabine plus cisplatin\nchemotherapy on the percentage of\nregulatory T cells (Tregs) and natural killer\n(NK) cells in the peripheral blood of\npatients with NSCLC.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study included patients aged >20 and\n<75 years with histologically confirmed\nNSCLC who were treated at Zhoushan\nHospital, Zhoushan, China between\nstaged according to NCCN clinical practice\nprised patients with nonmalignant disease.\nInclusion criteria were: Karnofsky perform-\nance status (PS) >80%; satisfactory haem-\natological and biochemical parameters\naspartate aminotransferase [AST] and ala-\nnine aminotransferase [ALT] 80U/l); life\nexpectancy >3 months. Exclusion criteria\nwere: previous malignancies; secondary lung\ncancer; previous anticancer treatment; con-\ncomitant immune enhancing or immune\nsuppressing diseases including bacterial,\nfungal or viral infections.\nThe study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of Zhoushan Hospital,\nZhoushan, China, and written informed\nconsent was obtained from all participants.\nPatient assessment and treatment\nBefore treatment, patients underwent phys-\nical examination, chest computed tomog-\nraphy (CT), head CT or magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI), electrocardio-\ngram, abdominal B-ultrasonography, pul-\nmonary function tests, emission computed\ntomography, full blood count and serum\nbiochemical analyses.\nChemotherapy was a 21 \u00bc day treatment\nFlow cytometry\nPeripheral blood (2 ml) was taken before\nsurgery, on day 0 (before initiation of first\nround of chemotherapy) and day 20 (before\ninitiation of second round of chemother-\napy). Blood samples were collected in sterile\nheparinized vials and analysed immediately.\nAliquots of heparinized whole blood (100 ml)\nwere incubated for 15 min at room tempera-\nture with antibodies (all BD Biosciences,\nSan Jose, CA, USA): (i) FITC-conjugated\nmouse antihuman CD4, APC-conjugated\nmouse antihuman CD25 and PE-conjugated\nmouse antihuman FOXP3; (ii) FITC-\nconjugated mouse antihuman CD8 and\nPE-conjugated mouse antihuman CD28; or\n(iii) FITC-conjugated mouse antihuman\nCD3 and PE-conjugated mouse antihuman\nCD16/CD56. Erythrocytes were lysed using\nlysing solution and washed twice with\nphosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), contain-\ning 2% fetal calf serum and 2% sodium\nazide. Intranuclear staining of FOXP3 was\nperformed according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions (BD Biosciences).\nCells were analysed by FACSCaliburTM\n(BD Biosciences), and the resulting data\nwere analysed using CellQuestTM software.\nA minimum of 5000 gated events/condition\nwere quantified as a percentage of CD4\u00fe\ncells, CD8\u00feCD28\u00ad cells were quantified as a\npercentage of CD8\u00fe cells, and NK\nas a percentage of lymphocytes.\nStatistical analyses\nDate were expressed as mean \u00c6 SD. Due to\nnonhomogeneity of variance and small\nsample size, data comparing differences\nbetween patients and controls in Treg\npercentages were assessed using Mann\u00ad\nWhitney nonparametric U-test. The differ-\nences between tumour subgroups and\ncontrols in the Treg percentages were ana-\nlysed using one-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) followed by LSD for multiple\nmean comparisons. When variables were not\nnormally distributed, Kruskal\u00adWallis test\nfollowed by Dunnett T3 was used.\nComparisons of Treg percentages before\nand after chemotherapy were made using\npaired-sample t-test. Statistical analyses\nwere performed using SPSS\u00d5 version 16.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. P-values <0.05 were considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nThe study included 40 patients with NSCLC\nsubjects (17 male/7 female; mean age\nThere were no statistically significant\nbetween-group differences in age or sex. In\nthe patient group, four individuals with\nstage Ia tumours underwent surgery only,\nand seven patients with stage IV tumours\nreceived chemotherapy only.

There were no sig-\nnificant changes in percentages of NK cells.\nPostchemotherapy percentages of\ncantly higher in patients with stage III/IV\nPostchemotherapy percentages of\nCD8\u00feCD28\u00ad Tregs were significantly\nhigher in both patient subgroups than in\ncontrols (P < 0.001 for each comparison,\nDiscussion\nCD8\u00feCD28\u00ad Tregs were higher in patients\nwith NSCLC than in control subjects with\nnonmalignant lung disease in the present\nand CD8\u00feCD28\u00ad Treg populations\nincreased with tumour progression, which\nis consistent with findings from other cancer\nin early stage prostate cancer,8 the present\nstudy indicated a higher percentage of\nTregs in early stage NSCLC patients com-\npared with control subjects.\nIt is thought that Tregs may play a crucial\nrole in inhibiting anticancer defence, and\ntheir depletion or suppression may therefore\nrepresent an important strategy to prevent\nwas traditionally thought to be deleterious\nto antitumour immunity, but some chemo-\ntherapy agents may have the potential to\naugment anticancer immunity by inhibiting\nimmune tolerance and suppression.\nPaclitaxel has been found to inhibit the\nnumber and function of\naddition, cyclophosphamide was reported to\nand the generation and function of\ntrioxide, dacarbazine, 5-fluorouracil and\nmethotrexate increase the frequency of\nTregs in peripheral blood mononuclear\ncells activated with T-cell mitogen.25 The\nabove data suggest that chemotherapeutic\nagents may have varying effects on Treg\npopulations and activity.\nand CD8\u00feCD28\u00ad Tregs were significantly\nreduced following chemotherapy in the pre-\nsent study. To our knowledge, this is the first\nTable 1.

Our findings sug-\ngest that, in addition to inducing tumour cell\ndeath via cytotoxic effects, gemcitabine plus\ncisplatin exert anticancer activity by\ndecreasing the numbers of circulating\nTregs in these patients. The fact that\nTreg postchemotherapy percentages\nremained higher than those of control sub-\njects suggests that the remaining cancer may\ncontinue to feed the mechanism underlying\nthe raised Treg levels.\nThe present study has several limitations.\nThe study population was small, necessitat-\ning the merging of subgroups for statistical\nanalyses. As a result our findings should be\ninterpreted cautiously, since a larger sample\nsize is needed. In addition, it was outside the\nscope of our study to determine whether the\ncells we identified displayed suppressive\nactivity. Consequently we cannot categoric-\nally state that these cells are regulatory/\nsuppressive T cells. Chemotherapy may not\nonly decrease Treg number but also inhibit\nfunctionality,23,26 and further investigations\ninto functional changes will allow insight\ninto the immunoregulatory effect of gemci-\ntabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy. Our\nstudy investigated combination gemcitabine\nand cisplatin chemotherapy, and it is not\npossible to extrapolate our findings to deter-\nmine the impact of each agent individually.\nThis could be overcome via dose\u00adresponse\nanalysis of single agents in animal models.\nFinally, NK cells provide a first line of\ndefence against infections and malignant\ncells, but our study found no significant\ndifferences in NK-cell percentages between\nTable 2.
