Sleep provides necessary maintenance and repair as a counter to waking activities\nof reproduction and production (Siegal, 2005). Therefore, a fundamental tradeoff exists\nbetween the asleep and awake states, and certain risky or resource poor environments may\nresult in shifts directing time away from sleep toward waking activities (Worthman, 2008;\nWorthman and Melby, 2002). Impulsivity, a measure of future discounting and risk\ninclination, is associated with fast life history strategies (Figueredo et al., 2006). This\nresearch proposes that sleep quantity and quality, as altered by ecological conditions of\nSleep, impulsivity, and life history\nresource or mating stresses, may queue alterations in future discounting as measured by\nimpulsivity inclinations.\nSleep\nAnthropological insight into human sleep has been primarily restricted to cross-\ncultural work on typical sleep environments and childcare practices (Worthman and Melby,\n2002). Aside from a few notable exceptions, relatively little work has been done by\nevolutionists on sleep ecology and associated behavioral and psychological outcomes\n(Ferreira de Souza Aguiar, Periera da Silva, and Marks, 1991; J. McKenna, 1986; J.\nand Melby, 2002). Anderson (1998) explains that this bias, at least among primatologists, is\npresumably due to persistent research interests in daytime behavioral profiles. As such, a\nlarge gap exists in our understanding of sleep and associated behavioral and psychological\noutcomes among humans and other primates.\nSleep is commonly viewed as a daily anabolic state of repair and maintenance. The\ncircadian sleep rhythm, linked to the biological twenty-four hour clock in humans,\nregulates our sleep-wake states partially through melatonin and partially through a\nhomeostatic drive. The rhythm plays roles in regulating bodily processes and functions\nincluding body temperature, hormone secretion, urine production, blood pressure, and the\nsleep-wake cycle (Arendt, 2006). There are two independent pathways whereby adequate\nspecies-specific sleep improves physiological functions: sleep quality and sleep quantity.\nAn overarching biological perspective details the role of sleep in homeostatic drive, which\nultimately optimizes all biological and neurological functions and systems (Benington,\n2000). Conversely, inadequate sleep quantity and quality exhibits significant behavioral\nand physiological consequences (see Banks and Dinges, 2007, for review), including\ndecreased cognitive state regulation (Saper, Cano, and Scammell, 2005), diminished\nimmunological functioning (Opp, 2009) and impaired executive functioning (Nilsson et al.,\n2005). Awake time, by comparison, seems essentially designed to achieve the major\nevolutionary goals of production and reproduction and therefore a trade-off between sleep\nand waking exists.\nIndeed, the two states of human existence, awake and asleep, can be thought of as\ncompeting systems in which the organism is either breaking down molecules for energy\n(catabolic and awake) or constructing molecules, organs, and tissues from smaller units\n(anabolic and asleep) (Rod\u00e9hn, 1999; Shneerson, 2005). The daily phases can be described\nin the following ways: The sleeping state exists to rebuild and rejuvenate systems that are\ncatabolized, damaged, or require growth due to wakefulness activities of production and\nreproduction. Because these phases achieve different tasks, and because they are mutually\nexclusive, it can be observed that due to the principle of time allocation, time used for one\nstate cannot then be used for the other. Thus, if an organism spends more time sleeping it\nwill have less time for production and reproduction. However, because sleep builds, grows\nand repairs the body, lack of sleep results in negative physiological, and perhaps risky,\nbehavioral consequences.\nSleep, impulsivity, and life history\nImpulsivity and Life History Theory\nImpulsive behaviors include lack of premeditation before action, inability to\ncomplete tasks, urgent decision-making and discounting of costs associated with risky\nchoices (Figueredo et al., 2006). Impulsivity has been correlated to future discounting\n(Ostaszewski, 1997) and many other life history variables such as age at first sex, age at\nfirst birth (Miller, Flory, Lynam, and Leukefeld, 2003), number of sexual partners (McCoul\nand Haslam, 2001) and a vast array of risky sexual behaviors (Donohew et al., 2000;\nRobbins and Bryan, 2004). Risky impulsivity, which measures risk taking without\npremeditation, is a common cause of same-sex aggression and greater sociosexuality\n(Cross, 2010), important components of a fast life history strategy. Additionally, consistent\nwith evolutionary theory, impulsivity decreases with age (Eysenck, Pearson, Easting, and\nAllsopp, 1985) and higher impulsive tendencies are found in men than women (Waldeck\nPersonality psychologists have offered a framework, and some research supports,\nthat personality consistency may exist in combination with contextual, state-dependent\nNederkoorn, Guerrieri, Havermans, Roefs, and Jansen, 2009; Wingrove and Bond, 1997).\nFurther, it has been posited that personality variation may be interpreted using a life history\nframework and that personality phenotypes may mediate risks of ecological uncertainty in\nsecuring reproductive opportunities (Quinlan, 2010). And indeed, Figueredo et al. (2006)\nfound that a purified measure (a scale which is drawn from several existing measures to\ncreate a scale of both impulse behaviors and impulse control) of impulse control had a high,\npositive correlation with a slow life history, as measured by the K-factor battery questions.\nFigueredo's work also links a deviance factor, of which impulsivity is an important\ncomponent, to reduced executive functioning, a measure of the ability to set goals, plan,\nsequence, prioritize, and inhibit pace, etc., which are ultimately linked to low K-factor\n(Figueredo et al., 2006). Figueredo emphasizes that optimization of executive functioning\nrequires impulsivity inhibition. And, as demonstrated above, sleep quantity and quality\nlessens executive functioning, which has a strong relationship with impulsivity (Bernier,\nKerhofs, 2008). Several studies also indicate a relationship between sleep deprivation and\nrelated impulsivity concepts such as risk taking and delay discounting (Acheson, Richards,\nand de Wit, 2007; Chaumet et al., 2009; B. McKenna, Dickinson, Orff, and Drummond,\n2007; Reynolds and Schiffbauer, 2004; Schmidt, Gay, Ghisletta, and Van der Linden,\nVenkatraman, Chuah, Huettel, and Chee, 2007).\nFurther, increased dopamine is strongly, positively correlated to impulsivity and\nfuture discounting (Pine, Shiner, Seymour, and Dolan, 2010). Therefore, a proximate\nconnection exists in that higher levels of melatonin from exposure to more darkness at\nnight, in part due to fewer nighttime interruptions, will cause dopamine to drop, thus\ninhibiting impulsive behaviors. Likewise, higher frequency of waking interruptions,\nparticularly with light, will inhibit melatonin, resulting in rises in dopamine and concordant\nimpulsive behaviors. This relationship may also support a state context-dependent attribute\nof impulse and predictions that impulsivity and risk inclination may be seasonally or\nSleep, impulsivity, and life history\ngeographically affected.\nFirefighters are typically referred to as shift workers and by extension are exposed\nto unique occupation-specific environmental risks, including large variations in sleep\nquantity and quality. This research investigates the behavioral variation in impulsivity\namong firefighters, as both a trait and as state-dependent upon environmental\ncircumstances. Life history theory supposes that increases in impulsivity and future\ndiscounting should be expected in risky, resource poor and unpredictable environments,\nultimately resulting in a switch from a slow to fast life history strategy, which may be\npartly caused by the negative melatonin-dopamine relationship that exists in the presence of\nsleep loss. During hominid evolution, poor sleep was likely a reflection of more\nenvironmental danger and unpredictability. Thus, disturbed sleep is a proxy of local danger\nand uncertainty. It is therefore expected that nightly variations in sleep quantity and quality\nact as cues regarding local environmental circumstances about the resource richness and\nrelative safety or danger of the productive and reproductive ecology. Such risky and\nstressful environments indicated by poorer overall sleep should result in faster life history\nstrategies, as measured by variations in impulsivity inclinations by particular domains of\nhigher urgency and sensation seeking and lower premeditation and perseverance.\nFirefighters exhibit highly variable fluctuations in sleep patterns resulting from random\nwaking events due to unpredictable calls that require decisions and action related to\nemergencies and fire-related events. Thus, firefighters are a good study population for\nsleep-related research because external measures of ecological risk, such as call volumes\nand quantity and quality of sleep, vary unpredictably.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and Location\nResearch was conducted among fire personnel at the CAL FIRE- Riverside Unit\nand Riverside County Fire Department. It is located in inland Southern California and\nhouses over 1,600 employees, primarily represented by career emergency response fire\npersonnel. This Unit defends approximately 7,300 square miles of land serving over 2.1\nof the largest total call volumes in California. The vast expanse of Riverside County\nincludes mountainous, desert, rural and densely populated towns and cities.\nPersonnel at each of the Unit's 91 locations are trained to respond to a wide variety\nof emergency situations, including: structure fires, medical aids, traffic collisions, rescues,\nfalse alarms, and hazardous materials. In addition to local emergency call response,\npersonnel are responsible for responding to major wildfire incidents throughout the entire\nState.\nSleep ecologies vary greatly across the Unit by individual station. This is due to\nstation-specific variance in the number of assigned personnel, call type frequencies and\noverall call volume. Furthermore, each station has different sleeping arrangements where\nrest occurs in either open-barrack, semi-private barrack, or solitary sleep rooms. Sleep\nroom acoustics, other distractions from room sharing, bed comfort levels, and room\ntemperatures also differ.\nSleep, impulsivity, and life history\nAlthough most firefighters in the Unit have fixed weekly shifts, some variation\nexists. Typical shifts commence at 8:00 am and are 72 hours long, creating susceptibility to\nvariable nighttime wakeful events for several consecutive nights. It is most common that a\nsingle crew, specializing in different call responses such as those in wildland firefighting,\nstructure fires, or those with a paramedic on crew for medical calls, are responsible for\nresponding to all calls specific to their training during both the day and night. Some\nstations, however, sleep more than one crew, and since nighttime alarms and dispatch\ninformation are heard station-wide, sleep interruptions can occur even for those who are not\ncalled for response.\nResearchers were escorted by Battalion Chiefs to fire stations over a period of five\nweeks during June and July 2010 where on-shift personnel were invited to participate in a\n\"sleep study\" as part of a larger life history project. Most frequently, three men were on-\nshift per station during the time of station visits by the researchers. Because participation\nwas limited by firefighters on-shift during the time in which researchers were visiting\nrandomly selected fire stations, firefighters working longer overtime shifts may have been\nmore likely to be sampled. Data analysis indicates, however, that 78% of respondents were\nwithin the normal limits of a three night working shift. Willing participants (n = 115) were\ninstructed to log onto an online survey and answer a series of online questionnaires,\nincluding demographics, the Brief UPPS Impulsive Behaviors Scale (Keye, Wilhelm, and\nOberauer, 2009), and an occupationally targeted sleep survey that included questions\nregarding quantity and quality of average sleep at the station. Data on call volume and call\ntype frequency by station were provided by the Riverside Unit Emergency Command\nCenter for their use as proxies for environmental stress and, by extension, environmental\nquality.\nDependent Impulsivity Measure\nKeye and colleagues' (2009) Brief UPPS impulsivity scale was adapted from the\nlarger UPPS developed by Whiteside and Lynam (2001), which is derived from the Five\nFactor Model (FFM) of personality inventory (NEO-PI-R) (Costa and McCrae, 1992). The\nscale includes four distinct components: urgency, perseverance (lack of), premeditation\n(lack of) and sensation seeking. Urgency, the most understudied component, provides\nmotivation to emotionally \"alleviate\" negative emotions and affect regardless of long-term\nconsequences (Whiteside and Lynam, 2001). Lack of perseverance is defined as remaining\non task to complete a project, regardless of its mundane nature or level of difficulty. Lack\nof premeditation describes a situation in which an individual acts with disregarded\nforethought to the consequences of a behavior. The last dimension, sensation seeking, is a\nmeasure of excitement and dangerous, risky activity seeking. These components suggest\nthat impulsivity is more complex than one singular concept, but also suggests the\npossibility that traditional scientific uses of impulsivity may need to be broken down into\ntheir components in order to better understand their individual evolutionary significance.\nIndependent Sleep Variables\nPredictors included one sleep quantity variable: 1). Self-reported average number of\nminutes slept per night; and three measures of sleep quality: 2). Psychological related\nSleep, impulsivity, and life history\ninsomnia; 3). Physical pain (health) related insomnia; and 4). A sleep disorder frequency\nscore. These were gathered via self-report, online surveys.\nTwo composite variables are designed to represent different aspects of sleep quality.\nPsychological sleep quality is measured by questions designed to gauge firefighter's\ninability to sleep due to worry, bad dreams and difficulty falling asleep. Physical sleep\nquality is measured by health related reasons for insomnia, such as inability to sleep due to\nbeing too hot, snoring, pain, difficulty breathing, and a general low overall satisfaction of\nsleep. An increased score in these variables indicate higher sleep quality from less\npsychological or pain related insomnia. The sleep disorder quality measure is an additive\nscore of the number of each participant's medically diagnosed sleep disorders.\nResults\nMultiple linear regression in STATA v 10 was used to test the hypotheses that sleep\nquantity and quality are inversely related to impulsivity. Descriptive statistics of the sample\nand dependent sleep variables can be observed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.\nTable 1. Sample descriptive statistics\nn mean s.d. min max\nTable 2. Dependent variable descriptive statistics\nn mean s.d. min max\nThe Brief UPPS impulsivity instrument differentiates between four distinct\nconceptual variables that were used in analysis: urgency, perseverance, premeditation and\nsensation seeking. The four independent predictors of sleep quantity and quality were: 1.)\nThe number of minutes slept on average per night at the station, 2.) Insomnia due to\npsychological worry, 3.) Insomnia due to physical pain, and 3.) The frequency of\ndiagnosed sleep disorders. Control variables for the full model included number of\nbiological children, number of years on the job, age, and the average number of station\ncalls per night, which approximates unpredictable events of ecological stress and risk.\nDiagnostic analysis of each model indicates the models did not diverge from the\nassumptions of multiple linear regression. The full regression models including all\npredictors on the four measures of impulsivity can be found in Table 3. The additive\nSleep, impulsivity, and life history\ncomposite sleep quality variable measuring psychological worry insomnia is composed of\nthree Likert scale questions regarding the intensity of insomnia related to worrying at night,\ndifficulty staying asleep and bad dreams. Of particular note, lower likert values signify\nlower sleep quality whether by insomnia from psychological worry or physical pain.\nRegression analysis indicates that greater psychological worry insomnia results in\nhigher urgency among firefighters ( = -.60, p = .001). This effect on urgency, however, is\nnot seen with the other measures of sleep quantity or quality when all predictors and\ncontrols are used within the same model. However, physical pain related insomnia is\npredictive of higher urgency in independent analysis without concurrent psychological\ninsomnia in the model ( = -.41, p = .005). Because of this result, and the fact that\npsychological and pain related insomnia are highly correlated (r = .464, p = .000), a formal\ndetection tolerance test, otherwise known as variance inflation factor (VIF), was run to test\nfor multicollinearity in Table 3, model 1. The VIF (1.74) did not deviate from regression\nanalysis assumptions, indicating an unlikely multicollinearity issue in the model between\npsychological and physical pain sleep deprivation and all other variables. As an additional\nprecaution test for multicollinearity, variables were mean-centered, which did not improve\nor significantly change model results. Therefore, insomnia from psychological worry\naccounts for more of the variance in urgency than does insomnia from physical pain.\nPerseverance was not directly associated with sleep but it does have some possible\nrelationship with extrinsic ecological risk as measured by nightly call volume. For example,\nalthough perseverance was not related to any measure of sleep quantity or quality in the full\nmodel, Table 3, model 2 illustrates a marginal relationship between perseverance and\naverage number of nighttime emergency calls. In independent regression analysis, while\nholding average number of minutes slept per night constant, the number of nighttime\nwaking response calls marginally increases perseverance ( = .41, p = .090), which is\nopposite of predicted theory. Similarly, when running each sleep quality measure in\nindependent regression analysis, without other criterion variables and using the same\ncontrol variables, models indicate a positive relationship with call volume and greater sleep\nquality as measured by lower psychological worry insomnia, ( = .43, p = .007); physical\nMore sleep per night results in higher premeditation ( = .01, p = .015). Conversely,\nthose with more sleep disorders show marginally lower premeditation ( = -1.03, p = .093).\nWhile poorer sleep quality and quantity reduce premeditation as predicted, the number of\nnighttime calls, a measure of extrinsic risk, is associated with higher premeditation ( =\nSensation seeking, the final of the four impulsivity scale variables, was not directly\nrelated to any of the sleep variables in multiple regression analysis in the presence of the\ncontrol variable of biological children. As such, having children strongly buffers against\nsensation seeking impulsive behavior. However, this finding is consistent with theory when\nrunning separate model analyses of each criterion variable in the presence of the same\ncontrols independent with both number of minutes slept ( = -.88, p = .024) and all three of\nthe quality of sleep measures (psychological worry,  = -.82, p = .041; physical pain,  = -\nSleep, impulsivity, and life history\nTable 3.

Waking exists to solve the challenges of production and reproduction,\ngenerally catabolic activities. A fundamental tradeoff therefore exists between the waking\nand sleeping states. Individuals should only tradeoff sleep quantity or quality in the\npresence of particular ecological constraints requiring greater investment in production and\nreproduction. Such ecological circumstances may involve social stress, resource depletion\nor high extrinsic risk. Life history theory consequently predicts that in the presence of lack\nof sleep or low quality sleep individuals should exhibit faster life history traits. One way\nthis may be indicated is through impulsive behavior, related to future discounting. The\nBrief UPPS survey instrument was chosen because it encompasses more than sensation\nseeking in testing impulsivity, specifically adding dimensions of perseverance,\npremeditation and urgency. Analysis revealed that there were several observed\nrelationships between sleep quantity or quality variables, including the presence of an\nindependent measure of extrinsic risk (call volume), and the outcome impulsivity measures.\nUrgency, derived from the neuroticism trait of the FFM, has been argued as a\ncomponent of impulsivity intended to mediate negative emotions. However, while the\nUPPS uses questions designed to measure urgency, premeditation, perseverance and\nsensation seeking, it should be noted that other studies on impulsivity rarely directly\nmeasure or evaluate the psychological components of urgency and perseverance. These\ndata support that sleep quality, as measured by insomnia resulting from psychological\nworry, increases urgent tendencies. Thus, individuals having a difficult time falling asleep\nor frequently waking due to excessive worrying are more likely to behave urgently. If this\nis indeed a component of impulsivity, it would indicate that social and ecological stress,\ntranslated into nighttime sleep deprivation, causes one to overestimate the time costs of\nwaiting before acting, and instead preferring to act more urgently, which is in line with life\nhistory theory predictions.\nLow sleep quantity and quality measures did not predict changes to perseverance in\nthe full model. Since it is possible that correlational effects between the sleep variables and\nemergency call volume could make interpretation of independent variable effects in the\nmain model difficult, independent regression analysis was done on each sleep outcome\nindividually to better assess the possible effects of the extrinsic risk factor of call volume.\nThese results highlight some marginal and significant relationships between the effects of\nthe number of emergency calls on perseverance when combined with each sleep measure in\nseparate regression analyses. In all cases, perseverance was positively affected by\nemergency call volume. This, of course, is opposite of predictions and is addressed further\nin light of similar premeditation outcomes.\nAs predicted, getting more sleep is significantly associated with higher\npremeditation. Evolutionary insight predicts that it is too costly to premeditate in the\npresence of risky, hazardous or perilous circumstances requiring immediate action. As a\nconsequence, careful forethought preparations are forgone in favor of instant action to\nsecure immediate survival in the presence of sleep deprivation amongst firefighters.\nInterestingly and also contrary to predictions, as was similarly found with perseverance,\nSleep, impulsivity, and life history\nhigher emergency call volume was associated with higher premeditation scores. This\nhighlights a consistent finding, which is that persistent exposure to greater extrinsic risk, as\nmeasured by call volume, results in both higher premeditation and higher perseverance.\nWith respect to premeditation, the results indicate that both the number of minutes slept\nand call volume independently predict greater premeditation, both in the positive direction.\nThere may be several interpretations of the contrary results of call volume effects\non perseverance and premeditation. Firefighters may habituate to risky, dangerous\necologies and adjust to high premeditation and perseverance in those circumstances where\ndoing so saves their lives. Alternatively, this result could simply be a measure of intrinsic\nconscientious motivation of individuals, which may vary considerably by personality type\nin the presence of extrinsic risk or lack of sleep.\nUnderstanding the exact nature of the reason for the sleep deprivation though is\nessential to predicting either a lack of perseverance or premeditation. This might imply that\nperseverance and premeditation are measuring something other than, or may not be\ncomponents of, impulsivity. For example, a high perseverance score generally refers to\nsticking with a task to completion. The meaning of a low score is less clear, though it may\ncorrelate to multitasking. Evolutionary ecological theory may predict circumstances where\nsleep loss due to different reasons may actually result in multi-tasking (or frequent task\nswitching) versus task focusing, independent of impulsivity. Indeed, the ability to ignore\nextraneous circumstances in order to achieve end goals to the exclusion of tangential tasks\nwould be expected of most people in dangerous circumstances, and therefore perseverance\nmay not always have the expected inverse relationship with urgency.\nSuch a reexamination of this variable, given evolutionary theory, may require\nreinterpretation of general hypotheses. For example, dangerous environments, requiring\none to focus on the task at hand to the exclusion of other distractions, would predict higher\nperseverance scores in the presence of greater emergency call volumes, but insomnia due to\npsychological worry may not necessarily be so predicted. Data analysis, however, offers no\nsupport that the number of years on the job increases perseverance independent of all\npredictor variables, but holding all control variables constant, either in ( = -.03, p = .657)\nor apart from ( = -.04, p = .585) the number of nightly calls, therefore it appears that the\ncircumstance of why one loses sleep is a key to understanding perseverance and that\nhabituation might not be the answer. And although the number of years on the job may not\nresult in habituation, residing at a station with higher call volumes does have some effect.\nFor example, when the number of emergency awakening events is higher for\nfirefighters, premeditation increases. This supposes that premeditation becomes\nincreasingly important for immediate survival when repeated risk is in the environment,\nqueuing alternative behavioral strategies. Since sleep deprivation has been shown to\ndecrease executive functioning in a variety of ways across the life course, repeated\nexposure to risk in the presence of compromised sleep during one nighttime sleep event\nrequires a strategy to mediate compensated executive function as a buffer for an\nindividual's safety. Response time during transportation to emergency events offers time to\ninvest in preparation and premeditation for forthcoming emergencies. Increased\npremeditation becomes especially critical as repeated exposure to danger is experienced\nduring the night, or it may be that extreme levels of risk select for premeditation.\nSleep, impulsivity, and life history\nThe lack of any significant relationship between sleep variables and sensation\nseeking was surprising in the context of life history theory; the only important variable in\nthis analysis being the control variable of biological children. It could be that sleep has no\neffect on one's inclination to seek out sensations, which is unlikely. One important factor is\nthat these data are restricted to men who tend to self-select into high risk jobs that appeal\nbest to individuals that are already at the high end of sensation seeking, thus making it\ndifficult to pick up sample variation if the sensation-seeking variable is very narrow. Or,\nthe answer may lie in the nature of the typical questions used to assess inclination for\nsensation seeking. For instance, one firefighter commented after taking the survey, \"Why\nwould I want to go skydiving? I risk my life every day for this job!\" Clearly, however,\nnumber of biological children is an extremely important component of impulsivity with\nrespect to sensation seeking, indicating that any studies attempting to look for sleep effects\non risk inclination must control for this powerfully predictive variable.\nNo age effects on impulsivity components were observed. This is contrary to\nprevious work, particularly in the area of sensation seeking. This analysis, however, is\nmore finely tuned to pick up evolutionary effects than some of these other studies, because\na control is used for the number of children, which is known to dampen risk inclination\nbecause of the costs to offspring quality. Since both age and biological children are in the\nmodel, when either is significant it is almost always biological children, because the real\ntheoretical reason that age is significant in previous studies is because it correlates strongly\nwith having biological children. Still, the number of biological children is clearly the more\nimportant of the two variables, given theory and outcomes. Consequently, future studies\nshould pay greater attention to this control variable.\nIn conclusion, impulsivity components are variably associated with environmental\nuncertainty. Nightly average sleep acquisition signals environmental certainty, and\nindividual firefighter behavioral strategies alter according to variations in time spent asleep\nand the quality of sleep one is able to achieve. As predicted by life history theory, lack of\nsleep minutes resulted in increased impulsivity, specifically in the lack of premeditation.\nReduced insomnia from psychological-related worry buffers against urgent impulse. And\nfewer diagnosed sleep disorders improve premeditation. Thus, better sleep quality in these\nmeasures suggests a decrease in impulsive strategies for on-shift firefighters. Finally, as a\ncorollary to this, better and more sleep aligns with a slower life history strategy.\n"
