This analysis in-\nwho responded to four standard HRQOL measures that\nassessed general health status and recent physical health,\nmental health, and activity limitation.\nResults: Among obese men, but not women, there were\nsignificant increasing linear trends in the adjusted preva-\nlence of trying to lose weight as physically unhealthy and\nactivity limitation days increased. Regardless of BMI or\nHRQOL, reducing calories was a common weight loss\npractice (66% to 86%). Except for recent activity limitation,\nrespondents with BMI  35 did not generally differ by\nHRQOL level in the attainment of recommended physical\nactivity either alone or in combination with reduced calo-\nries, whereas those in the BMI 25 to 34.9 groups often\ndiffered significantly by HRQOL level. Specifically, in-\ncreased unhealthy or activity limitation days were associ-\nated with reduced prevalence of attained physical activity.\nDiscussion: Our findings indicate an association between\ntrying to lose weight and a greater number of unhealthy\ndays reported by obese men, suggesting that these men may\nbe influenced by traditional clinical weight-loss counseling\nthat is prompted by weight and comorbidity, whereas\nwomen had a high prevalence of trying to lose weight\nirrespective of weight and HRQOL. Assessment of\nHRQOL, especially measures that evaluate physical do-\nmains, could provide subjective information to assist with\nweight counseling.\n",

Aspects of quality of life that can be shown to affect\nhealth, either physical or mental, are referred to as health-\nrelated quality of life (HRQOL).1 HRQOL and its determi-\nnants have been explored since the 1970s and include mea-\nsurement of subjective components of human function and\nwell-being (2).\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed, in part, by the payment of page\ncharges.

Both cross-sectional and longitudinal stud-\nies have shown HRQOL to diminish as BMI increases from\nused to measure the efficacy of treatment for obesity (20\u00ad\nPrevious studies of HRQOL and of attempts to lose\nweight have sampled individuals who sought intensive\nweight loss treatment in a university or hospital setting\n(8,11,23). However, such persons could have had signifi-\ncantly more psychological or affective disorders, including\neating disorders (8,24), or been predominantly older white\nwomen from higher sociodemographic groups (11,23).\nTherefore, the results of these studies might not be gener-\nalizable to the overall obese population. HRQOL and self-\nreport of trying to lose weight have not been studied in a\nnationally representative sample of overweight and obese\nadults.\nAlthough many Americans try to lose weight (25\u00ad27), the\ncues for these attempts are not fully understood. Motivation\nfor weight loss can include perceived appearance or the\ndesire to improve health (28,29). Research has shown that\nnot all overweight or obese individuals perceive that their\nhealth is poor or are interested in losing weight (30). A need\nfor research that explores the role of HRQOL in an indi-\nvidual's decision to try to lose weight has been suggested\n(4). Treatment algorithms for obesity are based on body size\nand comorbidities, factors that may not motivate all indi-\nviduals to lose weight. Because perceived need and moti-\nvation for weight loss vary, tools used to evaluate readiness\nto lose weight also need to vary. HRQOL has been sug-\ngested as a tool to identify patients suitable for different\nweight loss interventions (7). If HRQOL were found to be\nassociated with trying to lose weight and specific weight\nloss practices, then its assessment during a physician visit\nmight provide useful information for weight counseling.\nThe objectives of this study were to examine the preva-\nlence of four brief self-reported HRQOL measures (general\nhealth status, recent physical health, recent mental health,\nand recent activity limitation) and their association with an\nindividual's intention to lose weight and weight loss prac-\ntices (reduced calories, recommended physical activity, or\nboth) in a nationally representative sample of overweight\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a continuous\nannual survey of the civilian non-institutionalized U.S. pop-\nulation (this analysis used adults  20 years of age).\nNHANES uses a complex, stratified, multistage probability\nsampling design, and details of sample design and interview\nprocedures have been published previously (31). Participant\nidentification was based on census information regarding\nage, gender, and racial/ethnic background within randomly\nselected household units. Questionnaires were administered\nto NHANES participants both at home and in a Mobile\nExamination Center, and measurements of height and\nweight were done in the Mobile Examination Center.\nOutcomes and Covariates\nHRQOL Measures. Measures of HRQOL included four\nquestions referred to as the Healthy Days measures (32)\ndeveloped for population surveillance by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1993 for use in\nthe Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. These\nquestions were found to have moderate to excellent reliabil-\nity from retest reliability studies (33,34). The Healthy Days\nmeasures were tested for validity by comparison with self-\nreported socioeconomic and health-related data (35) and by\ncomparison with the Medical Outcomes Study Short\nForm-36 (36). General health status was assessed with the\nquestion, \"Would you say that in general your health is\nexcellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\". Recent physical\nhealth was assessed by asking, \"Now thinking about your\nphysical health, which includes physical illness and injury,\nfor how many days during the past 30 days was your\nphysical health not good?\". Recent mental health was as-\nsessed by asking, \"Now thinking about your mental health,\nwhich includes stress, depression, and problems with emo-\ntions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your\nmental health not good?\". Recent physical and mental\nhealth were correlated with the physical assessment and\nmental health scales of the Short Form-36 (36). An individ-\nual's ability to function is a useful indicator of disability\n(37,38). Recent activity limitation was assessed with the\nquestion, \"During the past 30 days, for about how many\ndays did poor physical or mental health keep you from\ndoing your usual activities, such as self-care, work, school,\nor recreation?\".\nTo facilitate clinical interpretation and consistency with\nprevious research that used the Healthy Days measures,\neach of the four HRQOL measurements were summarized\ninto a categorical variable with three levels. General health\nstatus was categorized as excellent/very good, good, and\nfair/poor. Recent physical health, mental health, and activity\nlimitation were categorized into no days, 1 to 13 days, and\nTrying to Lose Weight. A series of weight history ques-\ntions was asked to determine who was trying to lose weight.\nRespondents were initially asked, \"What do you weigh\nwithout clothes or shoes?\" and \"How much did you weigh\na year ago?\". Based on these self-reported weight questions,\nif respondents lost 10 pounds from a year ago, they were\nasked, \"Was the change between your current weight and\nyour weight a year ago intentional?\". Those who said yes\nQuality of Life and Trying to Lose Weight, Bish et al.\nwere defined as trying to lose weight. Respondents who had\nnot lost 10 pounds were asked, \"During the past 12\nmonths, have you tried to lose weight?\". Those who an-\nswered yes were also defined as trying to lose weight.\nWeight Loss Practices. Recommended dietary and phys-\nical activity weight loss practices were assessed in accor-\ndance with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's\nClinical Guidelines for the Identification, Evaluation, and\nTreatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults (39). The\ndietary recommendation for weight loss is to consume fewer\ncalories. Caloric restriction was determined by the question,\n\"How did you try to lose weight?\". Respondents who an-\nswered that they \"ate less food\" or \"switched to foods with\nlower calories\" were categorized as meeting this recommen-\ndation. We did not consider any other practice as meeting\nthis dietary recommendation. To meet the physical activity\nrecommendation, the respondent must have reported at least\nmoderate-intensity physical activity  5 times/wk for an\naverage of 30 minutes per bout, vigorous-intensity phys-\nical activity  3 times/wk for an average of 20 minutes\nper bout, or both during the previous month (40). Survey\nrespondents who met both the reduced calorie and physical\nactivity criteria were categorized as meeting both recom-\nmendations.\nOverweight and Obesity. Overweight and obesity were\ndefined using BMI. BMI [weight (kilograms)/height\n(meters)2] was calculated using measured height and\nDemographic and Comorbidity. Covariates of interest\nwere sex, age in years (continuous), race/ethnicity (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic), educa-\ntional attainment (less than high school, high school grad-\nuate, more than high school), smoking status (current,\nformer, never), and self-reported comorbidities (type 2 di-\nabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, and\narthritis). The NHANES Hispanic sample was primarily\nMexican American but included other Hispanic groups\ning was defined as current (100 lifetime cigarettes and\ncurrently smoking), former (100 lifetime cigarettes and\nnot currently smoking), and never (100 lifetime ciga-\nrettes). Obesity-related comorbidity questions were used to\ndevelop a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk variable (yes/\nno) and other comorbidity (OC) variable (yes/no). Respon-\ndents were classified with CVD risk if they had been told by\na doctor or other health professional that they had hyper-\ntension or high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, or\ndiabetes (other than during pregnancy). Respondents were\nclassified with OC if they had been told by a doctor or other\nhealth professional that they had arthritis or asthma and\nduring the past 12 months had experienced an episode of\nasthma or had an asthma attack.\nAnalytical Sample\nyears of age with BMI  25 who participated in the exam-\nination component of the survey were eligible for inclusion\nin the analysis (n  3184). Respondents with incomplete\nrace/ethnicity, incomplete education, smoking status, or co-\nmorbidity data (n  194) were excluded. The final analytic\nStatistical Analysis\nMeans and frequencies were calculated to describe the\npopulation. Linear trend tests of adjusted prevalence esti-\nmates were calculated to determine the presence of a linear\nrelationship between HRQOL measures and the prevalence\nof trying to lose weight or the prevalence of using a specific\nweight loss practice. Specifically, trend tests consisted of\npair-wise comparison of the conditional marginal propor-\ntions of the extreme levels of each HRQOL measure fol-\nlowed by a quadratic test for deviation from linear trend in\nthe conditional marginal proportions over the three HRQOL\nlevels using polynomial coefficients (41). Logistic regres-\nsion was used to examine whether HRQOL measures were\nindependently associated with trying to lose weight and\nwith specific weight loss practices. Before running regres-\nsion models, potential effect modifiers were tested, and sex\nwas found to modify two HRQOL measures at p  0.05 and\ntwo measures at p  0.22. Sex has been found to modify the\nassociation between BMI and trying to lose weight (25\u00ad27)\nbut not the association with weight loss practices; therefore,\nfor the analyses of HRQOL and trying to lose weight,\nlogistic regression models were developed to control for\nconfounders (age, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, CVD\nrisk, OC) stratified by sex and BMI category. The analyses\nof HRQOL and weight loss practices were stratified by BMI\nonly, and sex was added to the logistic regression model.\nSAS (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and\nSUDAAN (version 9.0; Research Triangle Institute, Re-\nsearch Triangle Park, NC) were used for the statistical\nanalysis to account for the complex sampling design. Two-\nsided hypotheses were assessed, and statistical significance\nwas set at p  0.05 for all comparisons.\nResults\nOverall, the weighted sample was 46.7% women and\nBMI was 31.0 kg/m2. The overall prevalence of trying to\nlose weight in the past 12 months among this overweight\nThe prevalence of trying to lose weight was examined\nby the four HRQOL measures stratified by sex and BMI\ncategory.

Overweight women who reported good\ngeneral health status were one-half as likely to be trying to\nlose weight as those who reported excellent or very good\ngeneral health status, odds ratio  0.52 (Figure 1A). Men\nwith BMI 30 to 34.9 had a significant increasing trend in\nthe adjusted prevalence of trying to lose weight with in-\ncreased physically unhealthy days and activity limitation\ndays (Figure 2, B and D); similarly, men with BMI  35\nhad a significant increasing trend in the adjusted prevalence\nof trying to lose weight with increasing numbers of activity\nlimitation days (Figure 2D).\nAmong those trying to lose weight, specific weight loss\npractices were examined by level of HRQOL stratified by\nBMI category with women and men combined (Figures 3 to\n5). Overall, the prevalence of reducing calorie intake ranged\nfrom 66% to 86% and was relatively common regardless of\nHRQOL measure (Figure 3). The only HRQOL measure\nassociated with using reduced calories was recent mental\nhealth (Figure 3C). Among men and women with BMI \n35, a significant increasing trend in the prevalence of using\nreduced calories was observed as mentally unhealthy days\nincreased (Figure 3C).\nOverall, the prevalence of attaining physical activity rec-\nommendations ranged from 4% to 55% (Figure 4).

Similar to recommended physical\nactivity alone, numerous significant linear trends and cor-\nrespondingly significant adjusted odds ratios were found\n(Figure 5). Specifically, for poorer HRQOL levels, signifi-\ncant decreasing trends in the prevalence of reduced calories\nand recommended physical activity were found among\nthose with BMI 25 to 29.9 for recent physical health\n(Figure 5, A to D), and BMI  35 for recent activity\nlimitation (Figure 5D).\nFigure 2: Association of self-reported health-related quality of life measures with trying to lose weight in the past year among men  20\ny, NHANES 2001\u00ad02.* Unadjusted percentages (SE)-weighted to be nationally representative.

Our results generally indi-\ncated that among obese men, less healthy levels of HRQOL\nwere increasingly associated with trying to lose weight.\nHowever, among women, a generally equal and large pro-\nportion (60%) reported trying to lose weight across all\nBMI and HRQOL categories. These findings suggest that\nmen link poor health to a greater body weight and try to lose\nweight based on their subjective evaluation of poor health as\nmeasured by HRQOL, whereas women try to lose weight\nbased on reasons other than health and independently of\nHRQOL. A study of middle-aged overweight and obese\nwomen found that dissatisfaction with body size was the\nstrongest predictor of trying to lose weight, and consistent\nwith our findings, general health status was not a significant\npredictor of trying to lose weight (42).\nAmong those trying to lose weight, recent physical health\nand activity limitation were most consistently associated\nwith attainment of recommended levels of physical activity.\nConsistent with others (43\u00ad46), we found that individuals\nwith the fewest unhealthy days had the greatest likelihood\nof attaining the recommended amount of physical activity.\nCross-sectional analysis of adults found independent asso-\nciations between recommended physical activity and health-\nier or better levels of HRQOL (43\u00ad45). Among generally\nhealthy older men and women who did not engage in a\nFigure 3: Association of self-reported health-related quality of life measures with use of reduced calories among adults  20 y trying to\nlose weight, NHANES 2001\u00ad02.* Unadjusted percentages (SE)-weighted to be nationally representative.

In our study, except in the case of recent\nactivity limitation, those with BMI  35 had the lowest\nprevalence of physical activity and did not differ by\nHRQOL status in the attainment of recommended physical\nactivity, whereas attaining recommended physical activity\nwas associated with HRQOL for those in the BMI 25 to 34.9\ngroups. A possible explanation for lower prevalence of\nphysical activity in the BMI  35 group would be that\nindividuals who report even the best health still have sig-\nnificant physical limitations that prevent their participation\nin physical activity, but further investigation is needed.\nUse of reduced calories for weight loss was common and\nnot generally related to HRQOL, but there was a significant\ntrend among respondents with BMI  35 to use fewer\ncalories as the number of mentally unhealthy days increased\n(Figure 3C). Although research on eating behavior,\nHRQOL, and obesity is limited, others have observed that\nunrestrained and binge eating are associated with poor\nHRQOL (47). Our study did not assess these aspects of\neating behavior.\nSeveral study limitations must be considered. The cross-\nsectional design limits conclusions regarding causal rela-\ntionships, so it is impossible to determine the extent and\ndirection of the association between HRQOL and weight\nFigure 4: Association of self-reported health-related quality of life measures with attainment of recommended weekly physical activity\namong adults  20 y trying to lose weight, NHANES 2001\u00ad02.* Unadjusted percentages (SE)-weighted to be nationally representative.\nWhere the SE is 1/3 of the unadjusted percentage, the adjusted prevalence estimates used for the linear trend and odds ratio tests may be\nunstable.

In addition, the extensive set of a priori\nassociations among multiple measures of HRQOL and try-\ning to lose weight resulted in the examination of 96 linear\ntrend and logistic regression models; therefore, five signif-\nicant results would be expected by chance. Our results\nincluded four significant findings for these tests of trying to\nlose weight (one for women and three for men), and we\ncannot rule out chance as an explanation; therefore, caution\nmust be exercised against inferring causality for these spe-\ncific associations in the absence of replication in other data\nsets. Similarly, among those who were trying to lose weight,\n144 statistical tests were performed, and seven significant\nresults would be expected by chance. Significant results for\nthe three weight control practices totaled 35, and the ma-\njority (34) were for the physical activity variables. Also, the\ntime frames of the questions were somewhat different. The\nHRQOL questions and physical activity questions were\nasked about the previous 30 days, whereas weight history\nwas asked about the previous 12 months. By definition,\n27% of respondents categorized as trying to lose weight in\nthe previous 12 months had lost 10 pounds, and this\nweight loss could result in a non-differential misclassifica-\ntion of their HRQOL due to potential impact of weight loss\non HRQOL; however, research has not always found that\nHRQOL changes with weight loss (16\u00ad17). Because the\nHRQOL measures are categorical, misclassification of the\nextreme categories would bias results toward the null, but\nmisclassification of the intermediate category might bias the\nFigure 5: Association of self-reported health-related quality of life measures with use of reduced calories and attainment of recommended\nweekly physical activity among adults  20 y trying to lose weight, NHANES 2001\u00ad02.* Unadjusted percentages (SE)-weighted to be\nnationally representative.

All information except\nheight and weight was self reported. Self-report is often\ninfluenced by social desirability (48). For example, persons\nwith known disabilities reported significantly fewer days'\nlimitation from in-person vs. telephone interviews (49).\nPhysical activity may be underestimated because only lei-\nsure-time activities were ascertained (no occupational or\ntransportation activity), and no information was collected\non actual caloric intake or specific food behaviors such as\nunrestrained or binge eating practices.\nThe greatest strength of our study is the use of a nation-\nally representative sample rather than selected obese pa-\ntients who sought medical care or weight loss treatment.\nAnother strength is the use of standard HRQOL measures\n(32,37) and multiple categories for the HRQOL measures, a\nmethodological recommendation from previous obesity\nHRQOL research (7). Rather than having a separate cate-\ngory for those with no limitation or poor health (0 days),\nprior research often dichotomized the measures (i.e., excel-\nlent, very good, or good vs. fair or poor, and 14 vs.  14\ndays). Adjusting for the influence of obesity-related comor-\nbidities allowed determination of independent associations\namong HRQOL measures, trying to lose weight, and weight\nloss practices.\nConclusions\nNumerous factors are associated with the decision to try\nto lose weight, ranging from appearance to attainment of\nimproved health (26,27). Our findings suggest that men\nincreasingly try to lose weight as they become heavier and\nless healthy, whereas women try to lose weight irrespective\nof BMI and perceived health. Traditional clinical counsel-\ning to lose weight is prompted by physical parameters,\nspecifically body weight or obesity-associated comorbidi-\nties, which seem to be consistent with our findings for men,\nbut not for women. Generally, at worse levels of general\nhealth status and higher numbers of unhealthy or activity\nlimitation days, the likelihood of attaining recommended\nphysical activity levels or combining reduced calories and\nphysical activity diminished. Future longitudinal studies\nmight explore these associations using obesity-specific\nHRQOL instruments and generic instruments. Evaluation of\nthese associations in cognitive studies and clinical settings\ncould enhance understanding of patients' subjective expe-\nriences of being overweight or obese and what health lim-\nitations they perceive beyond the physical measures and\ncomorbidities that are evident. Knowledge of these associ-\nations may help physicians develop realistic goals for their\npatients with BMI  25 and provide more tailored, sensitive\nweight control guidance.\n"
