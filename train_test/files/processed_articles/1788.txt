    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nCompared with white individuals, black individuals have a significantly higher risk for death in the general\npopulation but seem to have a survival advantage in the ESRD population. Data on the relationship of\nrace to survival in early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are inconsistent. This study evaluated\nracial differences in mortality among the adult participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey, a population-based survey of community-dwelling individuals. CKD was defined\neither by an estimated GFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or by the presence of albuminuria, and this status\nwas determined for 14,611 individuals, 2892 of whom were found to have CKD. Adjusting for age,\ngender, and race, risk for all-cause mortality among individuals with CKD was more than double that\nof individuals with normal renal function. In the subgroup with CKD, adjusting for age and gender,\nblack individuals had a significantly higher risk for death, and this risk was modified by age;\nspecifically, black individuals who were younger than 65 yr were 78% more likely to die than white\nindividuals, whereas no significant differences in mortality were observed among individuals who\nwere 65 yr of age. Further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and CKD stage did not\nmaterially change the results, but the hazard ratios were significantly attenuated after adjustment for\nsocioeconomic factors. In conclusion, these data demonstrate racial/ethnic disparities in mortality among\nindividuals with CKD. This higher risk for death in early stages of CKD may explain the apparent survival\nadvantage observed among black individuals who live long enough to reach stage 5 CKD.\nIn the general population, the cardiovascular and\nnoncardiovascular mortality rates for black indi-\nviduals are persistently higher than those for white\nindividuals.1\u00ad3 In contrast, studies among individ-\nuals who have stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD)\nand are undergoing maintenance dialysis have con-\nsistently shown that black individuals have a sur-\nvival advantage compared with white individuals.4,5\nEven though some studies in the general population\nhave shown lower mortality rates among Mexican\nAmericans despite a higher prevalence of cardiovas-\ncular risk factors and lower socioeconomic status\n(\"Hispanic paradox\"), studies with more complete\nfollow-up demonstrated poorer outcomes in this\nethnic group when compared with non-Hispanic\nwhite individuals.2,6,7 In contrast, Hispanic individ-\nuals with stage 5 CKD also seem to have a survival\nadvantage.5,8 Despite various hypotheses, these\nparadoxic disparities with survival advantages for\nracial/ethnic minorities undergoing maintenance\ndialysis have not been satisfactorily explained.\nWe undertook this study to test the hypothesis\nthat black and Mexican American individuals may\nhave a higher mortality than white individuals at\nearlier stages of CKD. Thus, the apparent survival\nadvantage during stage 5 CKD may be a result of a\nPublished online ahead of print.

Comparisons of the risk factors among\nthe three racial/ethnic groups with CKD are summarized in\nTable 1. The mean age of white individuals was 7 yr older than\nblack individuals and 12 yr older than Mexican Americans.\nWhite individuals had the highest prevalence of hypercholes-\nterolemia and a family history of premature heart disease and\nwere most likely to go to a particular place for health care.\nConversely, they were least likely to have diabetes, obesity, low\nincome, or lower educational attainment or be uninsured (Ta-\nble 1). Black individuals were significantly more likely to be\nhypertensive and had the highest prevalence of smoking (Table\n1). Mexican Americans had the highest prevalence of diabetes,\nobesity, poverty, having less than a high school education, or\nbeing uninsured (Table 1).\nOutcomes\nThe mean follow-up until the time to event or last follow-up\nwithout CKD and 7.9  0.2 yr for those with CKD.

Only five of these 1127 deaths were attributable\nto AIDS and three to homicide/suicide. After adjustment for\nage and gender, using white individuals as the reference group,\nblack individuals with CKD had a substantially elevated risk for\nall-cause mortality; this risk was modified by age. The risk for\nall-cause mortality was only slightly attenuated upon further\nadjustment for traditional risk factors for cardiovascular dis-\nease (model 2) or for socioeconomic factors and access to care\n(model 3). Given the significant interaction of race with age on\nall-cause mortality, age-stratified analyses were conducted\n(Table 2). Among individuals who were younger than 65 yr,\nblack individuals had a 78% higher risk for death compared\nwith white individuals (Figure 2A). The higher risk for death in\nthis age group remained significant even after adjustment for\nstage of CKD and cardiovascular risk factors (HR 1.53; 95% CI\n1.01 to 2.31) but was attenuated to a NS level upon adjustment\nfor socioeconomic and access-to-care variables (Table 2).\nConversely, there was no significant difference in the risk for\ndeath in the older subgroups of black and white individuals\n(Table 2, Figure 2A). There was a trend toward a higher risk for\nall-cause mortality among Mexican Americans, with white in-\ndividuals as a reference group; this trend, however, did not\nreach statistical significance. A similar trend for an interaction\nof age with ethnicity was observed among Mexican Americans\n(Table 2, Figure 2B). Entering the data on cardiovascular risk\nfactors as continuous variables or adding laboratory data (he-\nmoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin, phosphorus, potassium,\nalbumin, homocysteine, insulin, and C-reactive protein) did\nnot change the HR for death among black or Mexican Ameri-\ncan individuals.\nevents occurred among white individuals, 105 among black\nindividuals, and 89 among Mexican Americans.

There was a trend, albeit statistically NS, for a higher risk\nfor cardiovascular death among younger Mexican Americans\nas well when compared with white individuals (Table 2).\nSensitivity Analyses\nThree different sensitivity analyses were performed using\nmodified definitions of CKD. First, only participants with es-\nhaving CKD (n  996). The second analysis was performed to\naccount for the fact that only 63% of the NHANES III partici-\npants had persistent microalbuminuria.9 For this analysis,\nCKD was defined as the presence of any one of the following:\nalbuminuria (albumin/creatinine ratio 250 mg/g in men and\nindividuals with stage 1 and 73% of individuals with stage 2\nCKD with microalbuminuria (total n  2212).9 Finally, for the\nthird analysis, all 3411 individuals with insufficient informa-\ntion to determine CKD status were considered to have CKD\nThe same qualitative trends that were observed in the main\ncohort were seen in each of the three sensitivity analyses per-\nformed (Table 3). Thus, there was a progressive decrease in the\nHR for all-cause mortality among black compared with white\nindividuals, with increasing age in each of the three sensitivity\nanalyses. The same qualitative trend for a higher risk for death\nwas noted for Mexican Americans.\nDISCUSSION\nThe key finding of this study may have important public health\nimplications. Using a random sample of the population of the\nUnited States, black individuals with CKD were found to have a\nsubstantially higher risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortal-\nity, a risk modified by age. Similar trends, albeit not statistically\nsignificant, were observed among Mexican Americans.\nIn the general population, racial disparities have been re-\nported with particularly inferior outcomes among black indi-\nviduals with cardiovascular diseases and cancers.1\u00ad3 Disparities\nin several different outcomes also have been reported in pop-\nulations with CKD. Thus, black individuals are less likely to\nreceive erythropoietin in the predialysis stage of CKD, more\nlikely to progress to ESRD, less likely to achieve clinical perfor-\nmance measure targets while undergoing maintenance hemo-\ndialysis, and less likely to be referred for transplantation and\nhave a lower transplant allograft survival when compared with\nsimilar populations of white individuals.10\u00ad15 Our study adds\nto this list of disparities.\nNumerous studies have now documented the increased risk\nfor death conferred by the presence of CKD, either by the pres-\nence of albuminuria or reduction in GFR16; however, up until\nrecently, racial difference in mortality outcomes among non\u00ad\ndialysis-dependent patients with CKD has received only lim-\nited attention. Using pooled analyses of four community-\nbased studies, Weiner et al.17 suggested that there may be a\nsignificant interaction between race and CKD. Thus, the pres-\nence of CKD conferred a greater increase in risk for the com-\nposite end point of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and\nstroke among black than among white individuals. The inves-\ntigators attributed this interaction to residual confounding,\nwith the differences possibly relating to greater severity of hy-\npertension and/or diabetes in black individuals. Consistent\nwith these findings, CKD has been reported to result in a sig-\nnificantly greater increase in risk for coronary artery disease\nmortality or incident congestive heart failure among blacks\nthan white individuals.18,19 In our study, death was the only\noutcome measure studied, and we were unable to demonstrate\nany interaction between race and CKD.\nOur findings are in contrast to those reported among vet-\nerans with diabetes, wherein racial and ethnic minorities had a\nlower risk for death than white individuals, a survival advan-\nFigure 2.

The HR for all-cause mortality, adjusted for age and gender,\namong Mexican Americans in different age categories were as\ntage also seen among the subgroup with diabetic nephropa-\nthy.20 The differences in outcomes may be a result of better and\nequal access to care among veterans when compared with the\ngeneral population.\nThe modifying effect of age on the racial differences in out-\ncomes has previously been reported in the general population\nbut not among individuals with CKD.21 Thus, the health dis-\nparities seem to be greatest in the younger age groups. Similar\noutcomes among the elderly blacks and white individuals with\nCKD may reflect either survivor bias (such that only the\nhealthiest black individuals survive into old age) or the benefit\nof federal/state programs for the elderly, such as Medicare, that\nprovide improved access to care for participating individuals\nequally, thus minimizing racial disparities. The results of vari-\nous studies that have examined the racial differences in mor-\ntality of elderly with CKD have come to differing conclusions.\nOn the one hand, elderly black individuals who are hospital-\nized for congestive heart failure or survivors of acute myocar-\ndial infarction seem to have a survival advantage over white\nindividuals.22\u00ad24 On the other hand, analyses using the Medi-\ncare 5% sample standard analytical files demonstrated that\nblack individuals, with or without CKD, had a higher risk for\ndeath.25 Unlike previous investigations of the elderly, the co-\nhort in this study was a random selection of noninstitutional-\nized population of United States, and the baseline assessment\nof renal function was comprehensive (including serum creati-\nnine and albuminuria) and was done with individuals in a\nsteady state and serum creatinine was calibrated to the\nModification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) laboratory\nmeasurements.\nOur study provides some insight into the reasons for the\nhigher risk for death among younger black individuals with\nCKD, relative to white individuals. The higher risk for death\namong younger black compared with white individuals per-\nsisted despite multivariate adjustment for cardiovascular risk\nfactors; however, the HR was attenuated to a NS level upon\nadjustment for socioeconomic and access-to-care variables.\nThese data suggest that factors such as education, poverty, and\nlower probability of medical insurance may be more important\nin mediating the high risk for death among younger black in-\ndividuals than are biologic differences. This, in turn, may help\nin prioritizing interventions aimed at reducing the disparities\namong younger black individuals with CKD. Recognition of\nthis disparity among younger black individuals raises two im-\nportant issues. First, the substantially higher mortality among\nblack individuals with early stage CKD may suggest that the\ndisparity in adverse CKD outcomes is far greater than previ-\nously suggested by studies restricted to ESRD progression. Sec-\nond, the survival advantage of black individuals seen in studies\nof dialysis patients may be accounted for the higher risk for\ndeath seen in this racial group at early stages of CKD such that\nthe black individuals who live long enough to reach stage 5\nCKD are healthier than white individuals. This hypothesis is\nconsistent with the recent observations from the Dialysis Out-\ncomes and Practice Patterns Study that reported that minority\nindividuals undergoing maintenance hemodialysis in the\nUnited States are healthier than their white counterparts, ac-\ncounting for the former's survival advantage.5\nIn recent years, demographic shifts have made Latinos the\nlargest minority group in the United States.26 Unlike the data\nfor black individuals, the comparative data for Latinos are\nrather limited. Early studies in the general population indi-\ncated that despite a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk\nfactors (obesity and diabetes) and lower socioeconomic status,\nLatinos had lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality when\ncompared with non-Hispanic white individuals (\"Hispanic\nparadox\").6 Subsequent data, however, suggested that out-\ncomes among many subgroups of Latinos may actually be\nworse than that for white individuals.2,7,27 The data on out-\ncomes for Latinos with CKD are far more limited. At least three\nstudies suggested that Latinos, like black individuals, with\nESRD may have a survival advantage when compared with\nTo our knowledge, this report is the first to describe racial\ndifferences in outcomes using a population that included a\nsubstantial proportion of non\u00addialysis-dependent Mexican\nAmericans with CKD. The same qualitative trends, with a\nhigher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among Mexican\nAmericans, were observed as those for black individuals; how-\never, none of the trends reached statistical significance. This\nmay reflect that there are no significant differences in out-\ncomes of Mexican Americans and white individuals with CKD.\nTable 3.

Sensitivity 3 \nanalyses extended to include either individuals categorized as having CKD (based on eGFR and albuminuria) or those with missing values such that their CKD\nstatus could not be ascertained (n  6207).\nwww.jasn.org\nAlternatively, this may be a result of relatively smaller sample\nsize and fewer events, particularly cardiovascular, among Mex-\nican Americans. Thus, larger studies with longer follow-up\nthat allow more events to accrue will be needed to determine\nwhether a similar disparity in outcomes exist for Mexican\nAmericans with CKD.\nThis study has several limitations. First, the sample size and\nthe number of events for some subgroups were small, such as\nfor Mexican Americans. This is also true for the age-stratified\nanalyses and cardiovascular mortality. Second, it is possible\nthat some Mexican Americans may have died in their country\nof origin and, therefore, their data may not have been captured\nby a review of the National Death Index (NDI). This may have\nled us to underestimate the risk for death in this ethnic popu-\nlation (salmon effect). Third, almost one fifth of eligible par-\nticipants did not have enough data to determine the presence/\nabsence of CKD; however, our sensitivity analyses suggest that\nthis missing information is unlikely to have biased the study\nresults. Fourth, data on risk factors were ascertained only at\nbaseline; therefore, we could not systematically control for dif-\nferences in severity of risk factors or perform time-dependent\nanalyses. Finally, the baseline evaluation occurred before the\nbenefits of contemporary therapies like blockers of the renin-\nangiotensin system were established.\nThis study shows a higher all-cause and cardiovascular\nmortality for younger black individuals with early-stage CKD.\nThe disparity in all-cause mortality remained after accounting\nfor differences in prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors but\nwas attenuated to NS levels after adjustment for socioeco-\nnomic status. Survivor bias, arising from the higher mortality\nduring early stages of CKD, may explain the lower mortality\nseen among black individuals with ESRD. For determination\nof whether the noted trends for disparities exist for Mexican\nAmericans with CKD, larger studies with longer follow-ups are\nneeded.\nNHANES III was a study conducted by the National Center for Health\nselected using a complex, multistage, stratified, and clustered proba-\nbility sampling of the noninstitutionalized population of the United\nThe study design included a deliberate oversampling of black and\nMexican American individuals and the elderly.31\nThe cohort for this study constituted white, black, and Mexican\nAmerican individuals who were 20 yr of age and had CKD. For the\nsurvey, the participants self-identified as belonging to a given racial/\nethnic group. eGFR, using the abbreviated MDRD equation, and\nurine albumin/creatinine ratio were used to determine CKD.32 The\ncreatinine measurements in the NHANES III were calibrated to the\nMDRD laboratory by subtracting 0.23 mg/dl, as described previous-\nly.9 An individual was identified as having CKD when (1) eGFR was\nDefinition of Variables\nHypertension was defined as present when the individual was taking\nantihypertensive medications or the measured BP was 140/90\nmmHg. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as a total cholesterol 200\nmg/dl because only one third of the participants had data on LDL\ncholesterol. Diabetes was defined as a history of diabetes, being\ntreated with medications for diabetes, or having a fasting blood glu-\ncose 126 mg/dl. Obesity was defined as a body mass index 30\nkg/m2. Current smokers were individuals who currently smoked and\nhad consumed at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime.

Patients were classified as having any\nhealth insurance or none. The effect of income was assessed by deter-\nmining whether the participant's household income was 200 or\n200% of the federal poverty level. Access to care was defined as\nwhether a participant reported going to a particular facility for care.\nDetermination of Vital Status\nSurvival was determined by linking the baseline data to the mortality\nfollow-up file.33 In this file, the MORTSTAT variable indicates the\nfinal ascertainment of patients' vital status by the NCHS, with a par-\nticipant deemed to be dead when a probabilistic match was made on\nthe NDI screen or on a death certificate or both.33 For the former, the\ndata in the NDI were screened from the time of individuals' enroll-\nment in the NHANES III until December 31, 2000. To assign accu-\nrately the vital status to study participants using the NDI, the NCHS\nconducted a calibration study to develop the criteria used for the\nstudy.33 Cause of death was coded using the International Classifica-\ncomparable ICD-10 codes; the causes for all deaths of the study par-\nticipants, using ICD-10 codes, are available in the UCOD_113 vari-\nable. The following range of codes for the UCOD_113 variable was\ndefinition included, among others, causes of death related to hyper-\ntensive heart disease, atherosclerosis including coronary and cerebro-\nvascular disease, heart failure, and aortic aneurysms.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were performed using sample weights that account for\nunequal probability of selection; nonresponse; and planned oversam-\npling of elderly, black, and Mexican American individuals. Estimates\nwere made using the recommended SAS-callable SUDAAN software\n(version 8; Research Triangle Park, NC). Continuous variables are\nexpressed as means  SEM.\nAll individuals without a probabilistic match were deemed to be\nalive on December 31, 2000. Cox proportional hazards analysis was\nused to determine the effect of CKD on survival using data from the\nentire cohort of 14,611 individuals. All subsequent analyses were re-\nstricted to individuals with CKD, and three statistical models were\nbuilt. Various interaction terms with race were tested in the cohort\nwith CKD; only one (age*race) was statistically significant. This inter-\naction term was included in all subsequent models, and age-stratified\nsignificant differences in age between the participants belonging to\nthe various racial/ethnic groups, the primary survival analyses were\nadjusted for age, race, and gender (model 1). The second model was\nconstructed to test whether the racial/ethnic differences in survival\ncould be accounted for by differences in cardiovascular risk factors\nand thus included, in addition to demographics (age, race, and gen-\nder), traditional cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, cholesterol\n200 mg/dl, diabetes, obesity, current smoking, and family history of\npremature heart disease) and stage of CKD (model 2). The third\nmodel was constructed to test whether the racial/ethnic differences in\nsurvival could be accounted for by differences in socioeconomic sta-\ntus/access to care and thus included, in addition to demographics,\nsocioeconomic factors (education, insurance, and income), access to\ncare (go to particular place for care), and stage of CKD (model 3). To\nestimate the racial/ethnic differences in cardiovascular mortality, we\nperformed similar analyses after censoring participants who died of\nnoncardiovascular causes. All of these analyses were repeated on the\nthree data sets created for sensitivity analyses.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\ntutes of Health.
