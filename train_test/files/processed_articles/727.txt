The results call for a re-\nexamination of the conventional wisdom that commercialization fostered special-\nization at the regional level.\nThe population of the United States grew and urbanized between the\nCivil War and 1880, and the demand for food and other farm\nproducts increased. At the same time, Europe opened its markets to\nAmerican farmers. The rural economy of the interior United States\ndeveloped in response to these new sources of demand. With the rapid\nconstruction of trunk and feeder railroads after the Civil War, farmers in\nthe Midwest--especially in the states west of the Mississippi River--\nseized the opportunity to produce for wider markets.\nRising demand for farm produce and falling transportation and other\nmarketing costs changed the production strategies of midwestern farm-\ners in two ways. First, a smaller spread between farm-gate and market\nprices prompted farmers to sell a larger portion of their total output.\nSecond, differential decreases in the price spread changed relative\nprices at the farm gate, which in turn altered the mix of commodities\nthat farmers could profitably grow for sale. The first change is well\nknown: farm surpluses were increasing and home manufactures were\ndeclining on most farms by the eve of the Civil War, and after the war,\nexports of commodities grew faster than total output.1 Farmers' strat-\negies for commercialization, however, have been a neglected topic,\neven though many measures of farmers' performance depend on crop\nmix.\nThe Journal of Economic History, Volume 53, No. 2 (June 1993). \u00a9 The Economic History\nMary Eschelbach Gregson is a graduate student of Economics at the University of Illinois at\nFor helpful comments and criticisms I thank Jeremy Atack, Lee Alston, Fred Bateman, Susan\nCarter, Sumner LaCroix, Jonathan Liebowitz, and the editors.

For a Missouri farmer selling in the St. Louis\nmarket, the burden of marketing small grains fell faster than the burden\nmarketing oats and wheat in St. Louis fell at annual rates of 2 and 1.6\npercent respectively. The burden of marketing corn and livestock fell as\nwell, but at a rate of only 1 percent per year.4\nSteady increases in northeastern and foreign demand for midwestern\nfarm output, combined with differential decreases in marketing costs,\nturned relative prices at thefarm gate in favor of small grains. The shift\nin relative farm-gate prices brought about changes in both regional and\nin crop mix depended in turn on agronomic endowments.\nGerman rural economists, following the lead of J. H. von Thiinen,\nwere among the first to recognize that as transport costs fell, inherent\nsoil suitability became more important in the crop mix decision.\nTheodor Brinkmann, in particular, emphasized that when marketing\ncosts were low, the total cost of crop production depended on the\nnatural conditions of the farm. As the constraints imposed by high\ntransportation costs were ameliorated, the constraints imposed by\nnature became binding.5\nConsider farmers A and B in Figure 1. Both operate farms in the Corn\nBelt. They are equidistant from the market and therefore face the same\nfarm-gate prices. They could be neighbors. However, farmer A has little\nland suitable for small-grain production, whereas farmer B can grow\ngood crops of small grain on more of his fields. Each field has a linear\nproduction possibilities curve (average yield is either 40 bushels of corn\nor 15 bushels of wheat on the first field, and 30 bushels of corn or 20\nbushels of wheat on the second field, and so on); therefore at any\nrelative price the farmer chooses to grow either feed or small grains in\neach field.6 Differences in soil diversity across the farm translate into a\nsteeper overall production possibilities curve for farmer A than for\nfarmer B.\nGiven the production possibilities and the original farm-gate prices,\nneither farmer A nor farmer B produces significant quantities of small\ngrains (Figure 2). When relative farm-gate prices shift in favor of small\ngrains, both farmers grow more small grains.

Regardless of the type of\nfanning practiced, farmers in these six Missouri townships grew more\nsmall grains as relative prices changed.8\n7 The effect of agronomic endowments on crop choice can also be expressed algebraically in the\nfarm profit function (see Gregson, \"Strategies,\" chap. 8).\n8 Gregson, Census Sample. The six townships were originally part of the Bateman-Foust sample\n(see Bateman and Foust, \"A Sample\"). They are Rocky Fork (Boone County), Jackson (Camden\nCounty), Freebom (Dunklin County), Prairie (Montgomery County), Salt River (Rails County),\nand Mt. Pleasant (Scotland County). Farmers in the sample townships of Rocky Fork, Jackson,\nPrairie, Salt River Township, and Mt. Pleasant devoted substantial energy to grains and livestock.\nPrairie and Salt River townships comprise a subcategory within the corn-livestock group where the\nfeedlot system was in operation, albeit on a small scale. Farmers in Freeborn Township, in the\n\"bootheel\" of Missouri, grew cotton as a cash crop, but they still derived over 90 percent of their\ntotal gross farm income from noncotton crops.

Together,\nwheat, oats, rye, barley, and buckwheat output grew an average of 769\npercent on the Missouri farms.9 Not surprisingly, the share of small\ngrains in gross farm income rose dramatically. In 1860 nearly all gross\nfarm income came from livestock and feedgrain production. Wheat\naccounted for just one-twentieth of gross farm income from commodi-\nties traded interregionally. By 1880, small grains generated one-fifth of\ngross farm income.\nTable 1 also shows that differences in crop mix across farms were\nlarge.

By\ncontrast, in 1880 the interaction of soil variability with farm size and\nmobility were important determinants of crop choice.\nBecause a field was not usually planted in multiple crops simulta-\nneously, small farms were at a disadvantage for adding crops to the mix.\nYet after controlling for soil variability and assuming yield did not\ndepend on farm size, larger farms did not devote a larger proportion of\ntheir land to small grains than smaller farms in 1860. If \"lumpiness\" in\nthe land input prevented small farmers from adding small grains to their\ncrop mixes, the interaction between number of soils and farm size would\nless divisible, perhaps because of mechanization. Large farms with\nheterogeneous soils were likely to produce relatively more small grains\nthan small farms with equally varied soils in 1880.\nThe constraints that labor availability placed on crop choice in 1860\nand 1880 have a more complicated interpretation. There were two\nperiods of peak labor demand on midwestern farms: cultivation of\nyoung corn plants and harvest of small grains. The labor available in the\nfarm household was an effective cap on small-grain production because\nharvesting was labor-intensive, had to be performed in a short span of\nmain effect of a larger household labor force was to ensure adequate\nlabor for corn cultivation. Table 3 shows that larger quantities of\nhousehold labor were associated with crop mixes that were less\nconcentrated on small grains and more concentrated on corn, hogs and\ncattle. On the other hand, the interaction between soils and the farm\nlabor force has a positive (but not statistically significant) effect on\nsmall-grain production. Thus, farmers with diverse soils required a\nlarger on-farm labor force to harvest grains, but farmers with homoge-\nneous soils used their labor in the corn fields.\nIncreased cultivation of small grains coincided with increased partic-\nipation in wider, riskier markets. Thus, more risk-averse farmers might\nhave acted conservatively and might have preferred the traditional corn,\nhogs, and cattle crop mix. I used two proxies for risk aversion: the ratio\nof dependents ten years of age and under to adults in the farm household\nand farm wealth as indicated by size of farm. Again, the effect of farm\nsize on small-grain production was negligible. The effect of the compo-\nInsuring the family against disaster may have been a consideration in the\nearlier year but was outweighed by the benefits of growing small grains\n12 \"Hired hands were scarce and high priced when available.

I estimated the human capital of farmers using age as a\nmeasurement of experience and birthplace and mobility as measure-\nments of familiarity with specific conditions. Birthplace had no effect on\ncrop choice after I controlled for soil variability. The interaction\nbetween age and farm size, however, had a positive effect on small-grain\nproduction in 1860: farmers with more experience and more acres grew\nmore small grains. Thus, human capital played a role in crop choice in\nIn 1880, the role of human capital in crop choice was different. Raw\nexperience (age) was no longer important. Long-term residence mat-\ntered. Farmers who had lived in Salt River Township for at least ten\nyears (that is, they were linked from the 1880 census manuscript back to\nthe 1870 manuscript) grew more small grains if they had diverse soils\nand relied on corn and livestock if they had homogeneous soils.\nAlthough there were differences between the crop mixes of in-migrants\nwith diverse soils and in-migrants with homogeneous soils, those\ndifferences were not as large as for long-term residents. Experience with\nlocal soils seems to have provided farmers with important information\nabout the relative profitability of small grains.\nWhen transport costs were high, crop choice was mainly a function of\ndistance from the market. Variation in agronomic endowments did not\nresult in variation in crop mixes. But soil type became an important\nfactor in crop choice after the demand increases and marketing cost\ndecreases of the post-Civil War period. Farmers who had varied soils\nand the knowledge to exploit them responded to the changes in relative\nprices by growing more small grains than farmers with less knowledge\nabout the specific conditions in Salt River Township.\nThe shift by Missouri farmers from a crop mix strategy almost wholly\ndevoted to corn and livestock in 1860 to a strategy that included\nsubstantial amounts of small grains in 1880 seems to run counter to the\nconventional story of regional specialization in agriculture during the\nlast half of the nineteenth century.13 As marketing costs fell and demand\nrose, the story goes, farmers on the Plains became the nation's\nproducers of wheat, farmers in the Northeast produced perishables,\nfarmers in the South strengthened their ties to cotton, and farmers in the\nMidwest came to produce an overwhelming share of U.S. feedgrains\nand finished livestock. Agricultural historians call this regional special-\nization.

Though farmers in the Corn Belt\nwere the primary corn, hogs, and cattle producers for the nation during\nthe period, they expanded their output of other small grains as well.\nFigure 4 shows the dynamic of the endowment-contingent model for\ntwo regions. The regional crop mix outcome is analogous to the\nfarm-level outcome of Figure 2. The regions are equidistant from the\nmarket but have different soils and climates. The production possibili-\nties curve for the Corn Belt region indicates that although the cultivation\nof small grains (SG) is possible, it requires a large sacrifice of corn, hog,\nand cattle production (CHC). Similarly, while the Wheat Belt can\nproduce both small grains and livestock-feedgrains, its production of\nsmall grains falls off dramatically with each increase in livestock-\nfeedgrain production. Thus for any nonzero price, Corn Belt farmers\nproduce more livestock and feedgrains than Wheat Belt farmers who, in\nturn, produce relatively more small grains. This was the situation under\nthe \"original prices at the farm gate\" of Figure 4.\nExtensive growth in the regions would not have changed the compo-\nsition of the crop mixes, other things equal. But in response to the\nrelative price shift caused by higher demand and lower transport costs,\n14 Shares of national agricultural output by region can be computed from the state aggregates\nfound in the U.S. Census Office, Compendium of the Tenth Census, table 43.

William Parker\nhas identified transport costs, movements of labor and capital, and\ndifferences in the natural suitability of land for various crops as the three\nelements that determined the pattern of agricultural production.

Only\nadditional studies of farm-level decisions can lead to a clearer picture of\nhow choices by individual farmers shaped regional aggregates.
