Differential access to health care and thus the opportu-\nnity for testing, treatment, sexual partner services, and risk reduction\ncounseling may be among the factors contributing to variation in\nchlamydial prevalence.\nGoal: We investigated associations of health insurance coverage\nand health care-seeking behaviors, both indicators of healthcare ac-\ncess, to chlamydial infection in a nationally representative sample of\nyoung adults.\nMethods: Weighted logistic regression techniques were used to\nexamine associations between indicators of healthcare access and chla-\nmydial infection as determined using Chlamydia trachomatis ligase\nchain reaction among a subset of sexually active young adults ages 18\nto 27 interviewed at wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health (N  9347). Analyses were stratified by gender and\ncontrolled for age and race/ethnicity.\nResults: Having continuous health insurance coverage in the pre-\nceding 12 months was associated with a lower risk of chlamydial\ninfection in both men and women. Usual site of health care was also\nassociated with chlamydial infection. Men who reported emergency\nrooms as their usual site of care had a higher risk of infection, whereas\nwomen who used school clinics had a lower risk compared with those\nseen in primary care settings. Having seen a provider in the preceding\n12 months was associated with a lower risk of chlamydial infection for\nmen only. These associations remained even after adjusting for racial/\nethnic differences in health insurance coverage and health care-seek-\ning behaviors.\nConclusions: Independent of race/ethnicity, indicators of health-\ncare access are associated with chlamydial infection in young adults.\nFurthermore, our analyses reveal differences in these associations by\ngender. Improved healthcare access for young people could help re-\nduce chlamydia-associated reproductive health morbidity potentially\nthrough access to chlamydial screening, treatment, sex partner ser-\nvices, and risk reduction counseling.\nmonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the\nUnited States,1 and prevalence is highest in young people.2 Most\ngenital chlamydial infections are asymptomatic,3 and identification\nof infected individuals often relies on testing. The Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Preventive\nServices Task Force (USPSTF) each currently recommends annual\nchlamydial screening for all sexually active women 25 years of age\nand younger as well as for older, at-risk women (e.g., with new or\nmultiple sexual partners).4,5 The importance of annual chlamydial\nscreening for young women is further emphasized in that such\nscreening is an element in the Health Plan Employer Data and\nInformation Set (HEDIS) measures widely used for comparing\nquality of healthcare provision.6 The benefits of chlamydial\nscreening have been demonstrated in settings in which screening\nprograms for women have reduced both the prevalence of infec-\ntion7,8 and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) rates.9,10\nDespite screening recommendations and the availability of sen-\nsitive urine-based chlamydial diagnostic tests, which can simplify\nscreening, C. trachomatis infections remain common. In a recent\npopulation-based study of young adults living in the United States,\nwave III of The National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent\nHealth (Add Health), the overall prevalence of chlamydial infection\nwas more than 4%.11 There are likely many factors contributing to the\nsustained high chlamydial prevalence, and one such potential contrib-\nThis research uses data from Add Health, a program project designed by\nJ.
