Correlations between the levels of the two\nmolecules and the clinicopathological characteristics of malignant melanoma were analysed.\nResults: A total of 67 cases of human cutaneous malignant melanoma were analysed and\ncompared with 67 samples of normal nonmalignant control skin. Compared with normal skin\nsamples, the relative level of miR-21 was significantly higher and the relative level of PDCD4 mRNA\nwas significantly lower in the melanoma specimens. A significant negative correlation between\nPDCD4 mRNA and miR-21 was demonstrated in malignant melanoma (r \u00bc \u00c00.602). Elevated miR-\n21 and reduced PDCD4 mRNA levels were both significantly correlated with increased tumour\nsize, a higher Clark classification level and the presence of lymph node metastases in malignant\nmelanoma.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that miR-21 and PDCD4 might be potential biomarkers for\nmalignant melanoma and might provide treatment targets in the future.\n",

PDCD4, a tumour suppressor\ngene, plays multiple important roles in\ntransformation, tumourigenesis, progres-\nsion and invasion.11 The downregulation\nof PDCD4 was associated with tumour\nstage, nodal metastasis, and with both vas-\ncular and perineural invasion in oesopha-\ngeal cancer.10 This present study showed\nthat the levels of PDCD4 mRNA were\nsignificantly lower in malignant melanoma\nspecimens than in normal control skin sam-\nples. The downregulation of PDCD4\nmRNA in malignant melanoma was also\ncorrelated with clinicopathological charac-\nteristics such as an increased tumour size, a\nhigher Clark classification level and the\npresence of lymph node metastases in the\npresent study. Research has demonstrated\nthat the PDCD4 gene is a direct downstream\ntarget for miR-21.20 Overexpression of miR-\n21 regulated the metastatic behaviour of B16\nmelanoma cells by inhibiting PDCD4,\nPTEN and B-cell translocation gene 2.20\nThis present study also found a negative\ncorrelation between PDCD4 mRNA and\nmiR-21 in malignant melanoma tissue,\nwhich suggests that the miR-21-modulated\ndownregulation of the PDCD4 gene might\nbe a crucial oncogenic mechanism in malig-\nnant melanoma. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first published article demonstrating a\ncorrelation between PDCD4 mRNA and\nmiR-21 in malignant melanoma tissue.\nThis present study was limited by the fact\nthat it simply measured the levels of miR-21\nand PDCD4 mRNA in malignant melan-\noma specimens compared with normal non-\nmalignant control skin. Further research is\nrequired to provide a detailed understanding\nof the molecular mechanisms responsible for\nthe association between PDCD4 mRNA\nand miR-21in malignant melanoma tissue.\nIn conclusion, elevated miR-21 and\nreduced PDCD4 mRNA levels, which were\nnegatively correlated with each other, were\nassociated with clinicopathological charac-\nteristics in malignant melanoma. These\nfindings suggest that miR-21 and PDCD4\nmRNA levels might be potential biomarkers\nfor malignant melanoma, and might provide\ntreatment targets in the future.\n"
