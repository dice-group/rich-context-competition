    "abstract": "Abstract\nNearly one-third of adult Medicaid beneficiaries who receive long-term services and supports (LTSS) consist of older adults and\npersons with disabilities who are not eligible for Medicare. Beneficiaries, advocates, and policymakers have all sought to shift LTSS\nto home and community settings as an alternative to institutional care. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Medicaid-\nonly adults in California with new use of LTSS in 2006-2007 (N = 31 849) to identify unique predictors of entering nursing facilities\nversus receiving Medicaid home and community-based services (HCBS). Among new users, 18.3% entered into nursing facilities,\nwhereas 81.7% initiated HCBS. In addition to chronic conditions, functional and cognitive limitations, substance abuse disorders\nwith higher odds of nursing facility entry. For older adults and persons with disabilities covered by Medicaid only, integration with\nhousing and behavioral health services may be key to enabling beneficiaries to receive LTSS in noninstitutional settings.\n",

What are your research's implications toward the-\nory, practice, or policy?\nWithout additional supports, such as housing, treatment\nfor substance use disorders, and integration with mental\nhealth services, efforts that shift care away from nursing\nfacility use may be unrealistic or insufficient for many\nMedicaid-only adult beneficiaries.\nIntroduction\nMedicaid is the largest US payer, public or private, of long-\nterm services and supports (LTSS), spending over $121 billion\nin 2014.1 Policymakers have sought to curb Medicaid LTSS\nexpenditures by rebalancing care toward lower-cost home and\ncommunity-based services (HCBS) as an alternative to institu-\ntional care.2 Furthermore, rebalancing care toward HCBS\nreflects beneficiary preferences to receive LTSS in home and\ncommunity settings and in line with the Supreme Court\nOlmstead decision.2 For policymakers aiming to support\nHCBS use, it is key to understand the characteristics of the\npopulation that continues to enter nursing facilities even when\nHCBS is available as a Medicaid benefit.\nLiterature Review\nExtensive research has examined nursing facility utilization\namong in the United States.Ameta-analysis using pooled data\nfrom 12 data sources on older adults found that limitations in\n1University of California, Davis, USA\n2University of California, San Francisco, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMichelle Ko, Department of Public Health Sciences, University of\nEmail: mijko@ucdavis.edu\n3 or more activities of daily living (ADL), cognitive impair-\nment, and prior nursing home use were the strongest predic-\ntors of admission.3 Older age, white race, male, single (rather\nthan married), living alone, Medicaid eligible, and disease\ncondition were also positive predictors. A more recent profile\nof nursing home residents admitted from home found similar\ncharacteristics associated with conversion from a short- to\nlong-term nursing facility stay, as well as depression and\nbehavioral problems.4 Because these studies addressed the\nolder adult population at large, they did not examine use of\nHCBS as an alternative benefit under Medicaid.\nAdditional research has examined nursing facility versus\nHCBS by beneficiaries who are dually eligible for Medicaid\nand Medicare. Those initiating HCBS are on average\nyounger and more ethnically diverse, with fewer chronic\nhealth conditions and fewer ADL limitations.5 Racial and\nethnic minorities are not only more likely to use HCBS, but\nwhen they are admitted to nursing facilities, they have\ngreater functional and cognitive limitations.6 As expected,\nnursing home case mix is thus higher than HCBS case mix.7\nIn contrast to the large body of research on the dual-eligi-\nble population, relatively little has addressed the group of\nolder adults and persons with disabilities who are eligible for\nMedicaid only. This population merits greater investigation\nas Medicaid-only beneficiaries account for 32% of all LTSS\nusers covered by Medicaid.8 Adult Medicaid-only beneficia-\nries include older adults with limited work histories, such as\nthose with infrequent work outside the home, and immi-\ngrants who arrived past their working years. Persons with\ndisabilities who have Medicaid but not Medicare coverage\ninclude those with partial or temporary disability that does\nnot meet Medicare disability requirements, or are awaiting\npermanent determination for Medicare eligibility, a process\nRelative to dual-eligible beneficiaries, Medicaid-only\nbeneficiaries are on average younger, have fewer chronic\nconditions, functional and cognitive limitations.9\nMedicaid-only beneficiaries have high rates of mental ill-\nness (an estimated 47% of those with disabilities), as well\nas central nervous system disorders and substance use dis-\norders.10 They also have a higher poverty rate- nearly half\nof those with disabilities receive Supplemental Nutrition\nAssistance, ie, food stamps.11 Medicaid-only beneficiaries\nmay thus have a different set of health and social needs\nrelative to dual-eligibles, and this may affect their patterns\nof LTSS utilization.\nWhen comparing Medicaid-only versus dual-eligible\nolder adults who use LTSS, Medicaid-only LTSS users are\nmore often younger, male, minorities, living in urban areas,\nand diagnosed with fewer chronic conditions.12 Among all\nMedicaid-only beneficiaries who use LTSS (including chil-\ndren), 79% use HCBS, 18% use nursing facilities, and 3%\nuse both.8 In one study of Medicaid-only admissions to nurs-\ning homes, Thomas et al found that local spending on HCBS\nwas associated with lower rates of admissions among\nbeneficiaries with disabilities under age 65.13 No research to\ndate has examined individual predictors of entry to nursing\nfacility versus HCBS in this population.\nIn this study, we examined Medicaid-only older adults\nand persons with disabilities who are newly entering nursing\nfacilities or receiving HCBS in California. We focused on\nCalifornia because the size of the state enables an empirical\nexamination of a diverse Medicaid-only population, while\nholding constant potentially confounding state-level policy\nand program factors that vary in multistate studies. This is\nparticularly salient to the Medicaid-only population, as states\ndiffer in eligibility requirements in both income and disabil-\nity determination, as well as benefits under state plans and\n1915(c) waivers.8 Other studies have found state-level\nspending on HCBS is associated with likelihood of nursing\nThis study design focuses on the role of beneficiary char-\nacteristics on LTSS use, when all beneficiaries are eligible for\nthe same set of LTSS benefits. Furthermore, California HCBS\nbenefits, including consumer-directed personal care assis-\ntance, have been available as a state plan benefit for over 25\nyears, and can thus inform states that have more recently\nbroadened the scope of Medicaid LTSS. Finally, the diversity\nof the California population- across geography, race and eth-\nnicity- can provide insights for other states in which diversity,\nparticularly among the older adult population, is on the rise.\nIn order to support the use of HCBS among Medicaid-\nonly adult beneficiaries, it is important to understand what\nfactors contribute to the new use of nursing facilities.\nTherefore, we attempted to identify characteristics associ-\nated with a nursing facility stay. versus use of HCBS,\namong Medicaid beneficiaries initiating LTSS. We focused\non factors with greater salience among this population,\nincluding mental illness, central nervous system and sub-\nstance use disorders. In consideration of both the high pov-\nerty rate in this population, and the necessity of stable\nhousing in order to receive HCBS, we also examined the\nrelationship between homelessness and nursing facility\nentry. For the purposes of this study we only considered\nnursing facility stays which were not for the purpose of\nshort term rehabilitation but for what was anticipated to be\nan extended need.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nWe selected the study sample from California adults (ages 19\nexcluding: dual-eligibles, those with Medicaid eligibility due\nto time-limited circumstances (eg, emergency care, family\nbenefit), and those with developmental disabilities; the\nresulting study population consisted of Medicaid-eligible\nadults. From this we identified N= 31 849 beneficiaries with\nnew LTSS use (as defined below).\nKo et al 3\nData Sources\nWe used the Medicaid eligibility data files provided by the\nCalifornia Department of Health Care Services to identify\nthe Medicaid-only population and obtain information on\nbeneficiary age, sex, race and ethnicity. We linked eligibility\nfiles to Medicaid claims data to identify both prevalent and\nincident HCBS and nursing facility use and diagnosis codes.\nWe further linked statewide hospital discharge data (Office\nof Statewide Planning and Development Patient Discharge\nDatabase) to supplement claims data on diagnosis codes, and\nassessment data on housing status.\nWe obtained functional and cognitive ability measures\nand living arrangement data from the state Case Management\nInformation and Payrolling System (CMIPS) for those\nreceiving HCBS, the Minimum Data Set (MDS) for those\nentering nursing facilities, Outcome and Assessment\nInformation Set (OASIS) used for those receiving home\nhealth care, and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient\nAssessment Instrument (IRF/PAI) for those discharged from\nrehabilitation hospitals. Cognitive limitation was defined as\nrequiring at least verbal assistance, supervision, or cueing\ndue to limitations in memory, orientation, or judgment items\nin the CMIPS and MDS instruments.\nMeasures\nOur primary outcome of interest was whether a beneficiary\nentered into a nursing facility for an extended stay, with use\nof HCBS as the reference alternative. We defined LTSS use\nas either receipt of Medicaid HCBS or an extended nursing\nfacility stay, at least once during the study period. We defined\nHCBS as: home health, personal care assistance, commu-\nnity-based adult day health services, targeted case manage-\nment, and Section 1915(c) home and community-based\nservice waivers. To focus on long-term, rather than acute and\nrehabilitative services, we defined extended nursing facility\nstays as those lasting 21 or more consecutive days. We iden-\ntified new use as extended nursing facility stay or HCBS\nwith no prior use of that service in the preceding 12-months.\nWe included age, gender, race and ethnicity, and chronic\ndisease burden using the Chronic Illness and Disability\nPayment System (CDPS) for Medicaid, which consolidates\ndiagnostic codes: higher scores reflect greater morbidity.16\nWe used the CDPS-created categories to create indicators for\ncentral nervous system, psychological and substance use dis-\norders (see Supplemental Material Tables A3-A5 for a com-\nplete list of diagnoses for each category). We categorized\nfunctional limitation as having 3 or more limitations in ADL,\nand we defined cognitive limitation as requiring at least ver-\nbal assistance/supervision/cueing due to limitations in mem-\nory, orientation, or judgment. We measured living\narrangement with an indicator for whether a beneficiary\nlived alone. We also adjusted for whether a beneficiary was\nMedically Needy or categorically eligible for Medicaid.\nBeneficiaries who are eligible for Medicaid under the state\nMedically Needy program have incomes above categorical\nlimits, and on average greater health care needs and use of\nnursing facilities.17\nAnalysis\nWe first described the characteristics of beneficiaries who\nare new users of each service. We then performed multivari-\nate logistic regression models to estimate the associations\nbetween individual characteristics and nursing facility entry\nrather than HCBS.\nProcedures for the privacy protection of recipient identity\nand service use were approved by the University of California\nCalifornia Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects\nsion 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina).\nResults\nMedicaid-only adults who used LTSS received HCBS, with\nthe balance entering nursing facilities. Compared to HCBS\nusers, a higher percentage of nursing facility entrants were\nnon-Hispanic White and aged 55 to 64 years (Table 1). Over\n65% had 3 or more limitations in ADL and nearly half had\ncognitive limitations. Nearly twice the percentage of nursing\nfacility entrants had central nervous system, psychological,\nand substance use conditions.\nIn multivariate analyses, older age, male gender, non-His-\npanic White race and ethnicity, and Medically Needy eligi-\nbility were significantly associated with entering into a\nnursing facility rather than HCBS (Table 2). A greater burden\nof chronic disease, central nervous system and psychological\nconditions, and cognitive limitations were also associated\nwith higher odds of entry into a nursing facility. Substance\nabuse and living alone were associated with over 35% higher\nodds. Having 3 or more ADL limitations and being homeless\nwere each associated with over 400% higher odds of nursing\nfacility entry.\nWe conducted additional analyses with more specific cat-\negories of central nervous system, psychological and sub-\nstance abuse conditions associated with nursing facility\nadmission (Supplemental Material Tables A3-A5). After\nidentifying associations among the specific categories, we\nestimated models including the corresponding indicators\nand aggregating the rest. For example, among central ner-\nvous system (CNS) disorders, dementia (odds ratio [OR]\nated with nursing facility admission, whereas autonomic\nand inflammatory disorders were not; the dementia and\nmovement disorders were retained in the full model and\nother CNS disorders were aggregated into a single Other\nCNS disorder category (Supplemental Material Tables A1,\nA2). Schizophrenia and other diagnoses of psychoses (OR\nfacility admissions, with a weak association for mood disor-\nother substances (including opioids, other prescription med-\nications, or other illicit drugs), was associated with nursing\nfacility admission. Relationships between ADL limitations,\nliving alone, and being homeless, with nursing facility\nadmission, remained nearly unchanged after including the\nexpanded list of conditions.\nDiscussion\nAmong the California Medicaid-only adult population using\nLTSS, the large majority received HCBS, rather than nurs-\ning facility care. Our findings are similar to national esti-\nmates on nonelderly beneficiaries with disabilities.18 In\ncontrast, approximately 50% of dual-eligible beneficiaries\nusing LTSS receive nursing facility care.18\nAs seen in prior studies of dual-eligible beneficiaries,\nMedicaid-only adults who entered nursing facilities rather\nthan used HCBS tended to be older, of non-Hispanic White\nrace and ethnicity, and have a higher burden of chronic dis-\nease, functional and cognitive limitations, and central ner-\nvous system conditions.3,12 Entry into nursing facilities\namong those with greater frailty and limitations may reflect\nhigher care needs that may be more easily met in institutional\nsettings.\nOur finding that racial and ethnic minorities are less likely\nto enter nursing facilities, even after accounting for health and\nfunctional conditions, is consistent with prior research on\nolder adults and dual-eligible beneficiaries suggesting minor-\nities face barriers to care.3,6 Other recent investigations have\nfound that disparities in nursing facility use are narrowing,19,20\nalthough it is unclear whether this reflects the greater variety\nof LTSS options available to non-Hispanic Whites versus a\ntrue narrowing of disparities in access.6 Nursing facility\noptions are limited for those with only Medicaid coverage,\nand the facilities serving a higher percentage of Medicaid\nresidents have, on average, limited resources and lower qual-\nity of care.21,22 Due to persistent structural inequities and\nTable 1.

Therefore, the Medically Needy beneficiaries in this\nsample do not include those who have become eligible for\nMedicaid as a result of a long-term nursing facility stay. The\nobserved relationship between Medically Needy and nursing\nfacility admission may more closely reflect the greater levels\nof illness and disability within this population.\nIn addition, those with mental illness, substance use disor-\nders, and those who were homeless were also more likely to\nenter nursing facilities, even after adjusting for other factors.\nThis is consistent with prior evidence that mental illness and\nbehavioral problems are associated with nursing facility\nadmissions,4,23 and facilities with a high concentration of\nMedicaid residents also have a higher proportion of residents\nwith psychiatric conditions. We identified a relationship par-\nticularly between alcohol use and nursing facility admission.\nPrior studies have found that nursing facility residents with\nalcohol use disorders have higher functional abilities but are\nmore likely to have been homeless, diagnosed with comorbid\nmental illness, and lacking in social support24--factors that\nmay contribute to admission despite low nursing care needs.\nWe may not have found associations for other substance use\ndisorders for several reasons, including that the study period\nprecedes the opioid epidemic, the aging of the Baby Boomer\npopulation that has increased prevalence of nonalcohol sub-\nstance use disorders,25 and lower rates of substance use\ndetection among older adults.26 It is possible that given the\nongoing challenges with access to treatment, we would iden-\ntify nursing facility admissions associated with substance\nuse disorders with a more contemporary sample.\nImplications\nIt is not surprising that Medicaid beneficiaries with chronic\nconditions and functional limitations are more likely to enter\nnursing facilities. However, it is debatable whether skilled\nnursing facilities are optimal for beneficiaries with complex\nbehavioral and social needs.\nFor those with mental illness, prior research has also\nshown that nursing facility residents receive lower quality\nmental health care.27 Nearly one quarter of adults below age\n65 with severe mental illness have low care status upon\nadmission, again suggesting that nursing facilities are not\nnecessarily appropriate fit for these residents.23 Although\nstates are required to implement a process for screening of\nMedicaid beneficiaries for serious mental illness prior to\nadmission, and determination of appropriate placement, past\nresearch has found that legislation is weakly enforced.28\nIdentifying alternative care settings has historically been\nhampered by the loss of inpatient psychiatric facilities over\ntime and the exclusion of Medicaid reimbursement for resi-\ndential care facilities.23 The Centers for Medicare and\nMedicaid Services has recently indicated that the restriction\non Medicaid reimbursement for treatment in residential care\nwill be waived,29 potentially improving access to appropriate\nmental health services rather than nursing facility use.\nMedicaid beneficiaries (and those who evaluate their care\nneeds) also face the limited availability of community men-\ntal health services and tailored LTSS for those with mental\nillness.23 Low-income and minority communities, ie, those\nwith a higher proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries, have\nfewer community mental health centers that accept\nMedicaid.30 Furthermore, management of an individual with\nmental illness in home and community settings without sup-\nport in these areas can impose considerable burden on care-\ngiving families. This obviates HCBS options that do not\nTable 2.

In short, poli-\ncies should aim for expansion of HCBS benefits in addition\nto preentry treatment for mental illness.\nFor those with substance use disorders, most nursing\nfacilities are not equipped to treat these conditions.31\nAlternative treatment options for Medicaid beneficiaries are\nlimited, with particular gaps in rural areas and those with a\nhigh percentage of black residents.32 The supply of publicly\nfunded outpatient substance use treatment centers has been\ndeclining, with a countertrend in growth of for-profit centers\nthat do not accept Medicaid.33 Several state Medicaid pro-\ngrams are testing programs to foster integration of health\ncare with behavioral health services, but these programs\nhave primarily addressed acute, rather than long-term,\nTreatment options for those with comorbid mental illness\nand substance use disorders are even more scarce. Evidence\nfrom Money Follows the Person demonstrations suggest that\nwith appropriate program supports, those with dual diagno-\nses can successfully transition from nursing facilities to com-\nmunity settings.37 Our findings support targeting of those\nwith mental illness and substance use disorder needs before\nnursing facility admission occurs. Two states (Washington\nand Vermont) have begun programs to serve \"pre-Medicaid\"\nbeneficiaries--those at risk for Medicaid nursing facility\nuse, to prevent or delay admission.37\nFor Medicaid beneficiaries who are homeless, the lack of\nhousing stability would make receiving HCBS difficult and\nadmission to a nursing facility a preferable option. To reduce\nacute care costs from emergency department visits and hos-\npital admissions, policymakers have shown greater interest\nin supportive housing programs, which have a more robust\nevidence basis for improving outcomes of homeless Medicaid\nbeneficiaries.38 Our findings suggest that potential benefits\nfrom reduced nursing facility use should also be factored into\nthese considerations. Similarly, state demonstrations to facil-\nitate transitions from nursing homes have highlighted the\nbenefits of Medicaid program coordination with housing\nauthorities to foster development of affordable housing, pro-\nvide transition counselors, housing searches, assistance with\nrental security deposits, and home modifications;37 these\napproaches can also be supported to reduce nursing facility\nadmissions among Medicaid-only beneficiaries. Additional\nresearch should explore the potential cost and quality bene-\nfits of including housing subsidies as a Medicaid benefit, to\nfoster use of HCBS than nursing facilities.\nFinally, states have increasingly moved toward enroll-\nment of older adults and persons with disabilities into\nMedicaid managed care plans for acute care services.\nTransition to managed care for these populations was per-\nceived favorably by those who selected plans and negatively\nby those who were assigned.39 Demonstration initiatives in\n19 states, including California, have turned to managed care\nplans to guide LTSS utilization as well, and in some cases,\nrequired reporting on rebalancing care from nursing facilities\nto HCBS.40 Early evidence on the California managed LTSS\ntransition has found dual-eligible beneficiaries have mixed\nexperiences, with some reporting improved and others wors-\nened access to care;41 for those with LTSS, beneficiaries in\nmanaged and nonmanaged LTSS counties continue to report\nunmet needs.42 Other states have also reported mixed out-\ncomes from transitioning to managed LTSS; however, all\nremain early in implementation and evaluation is ongoing.37\nOne challenge is that care coordination--particularly\nbetween acute care, LTSS, and behavioral health services--\nremains poorly defined and thus appropriate skill sets and\nquality of care are difficult to measure.43 Our findings sup-\nport the argument that managed care benefits must expand\nbeyond acute and LTSS health care services, and tailored for\nMedicaid beneficiaries with complex social and behavioral\nneeds. Policymakers should examine whether managed care\nplans are equipped or properly reimbursed to manage a more\ncomplex array of services in addition to LTSS for Medicaid-\nonly beneficiaries.\nLimitations\nFirst, we were unable to obtain data on other characteris-\ntics, such as family and social support, that are known to\ninfluence the use of community versus institutional care.\nWe used living arrangement as a proxy for available social\nsupport. Second, we were also unable to account for\nlength of disability, which can impact individual experi-\nence with disability severity of disability and likelihood\nof functional needs and comorbidities. We have restricted\nour sample to those with no prior LTSS use in the preced-\ning year, to partly reduce heterogeneity in underlying dis-\nability severity. Third, our data reflect patterns from\nlization, including differing health and functional needs of\nthose newly eligible for Medicaid, and implementation of\nmanaged acute and long-term care services in select\nCalifornia counties. As described in the Introduction,\nprior description of the Medicaid-only population using\nLTSS is sparse, and this study provides a baseline for\nfuture evaluation. We note that many of the findings are\nconsistent with the larger body of literature on LTSS use\namong dual-eligibles, and we have no theoretical reason\nto expect that the associations between the individual\ncharacteristics examined in this study would change over\ntime. Last, this study is limited to individuals in California\nand may be limited in generalizability to other states.\nHowever, by focusing on one state, our study emphasizes\nthe importance of individual characteristics in LTSS out-\ncomes when other policy and programmatic factors are\nheld constant. Furthermore, certain benefits (particularly\nconsumer-direction in personal care assistance) were\navailable to California Medicaid beneficiaries in this ear-\nlier time period, and thus relevant to states that have more\nrecently adopted these policies.\nKo et al 7\nConclusion\nIn recent years, the Medicaid-only population of older adults\nand persons with disabilities has been growing at a faster rate\nthan the dual-eligible population. Relative to dual-eligibles,\nMedicaid-only adults with disabilities are less likely to receive\nLTSS in nursing facilities, but when they do, their annual per-\nperson costs are higher.18 Nursing facility options are limited\nfor those with only Medicaid coverage, and the facilities serv-\ning a greater percentage of Medicaid residents have, on aver-\nage, limited resources and lower quality of care. Recent\nevidence suggests nursing facility quality is improving and\ndisparities narrowing, but overall deficiency rates remain\nhigh.44 Our findings reinforce the importance of policies such\nas higher Medicaid payment rates and staffing standards that\nsupport improved quality of care for a high need popula-\ntion.45,46 Providers, advocates, and policymakers continue to\ndebate on how best to determine when beneficiaries may use\nHCBS as an alternative to nursing facility care. Our findings\nsuggest that without additional supports, such as housing,\ntreatment for substance use disorders, and integration with\nmental health services, rebalancing efforts may be unrealistic\nor insufficient for many Medicaid-only adult beneficiaries.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nwork was supported by a contract from the California Department\nDH]; a grant from The SCAN Foundation [# 09-018 to RN, AB,\nTK, and DH]; and a National Research Scientist Award\nSupplement Material\nSupplement material is available for this article online.\nReferences\n1.
