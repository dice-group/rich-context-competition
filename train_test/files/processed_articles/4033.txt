Such alloparents include the\nfather, aunts, uncles, and grandparents who may increase their inclusive fitness by\ninvesting in their close kin (Hamilton, 1964). In pre-modern and traditional populations the\nbeneficial effects of kin investment are often measured by child survival (Coall and\nHertwig, 2010). According to Sear and Mace's (2008) review, grandmothers in particular\nhave a positive effect on increased child survival.\nThe Grandmother hypothesis states that the long postmenopausal life span of\nwomen might be an evolutionary adaptation, because of the support that these older women\nprovide to their children and grandchildren (Lahdenper\u00e4, Lummaa, Helle, Tremblay, and\nGrandmaternal investment and early years overweight\nRussell, 2004). Women survive well beyond their fertile years, which is rare among\nanimals, including other great apes (Hawkes, O'Connell, and Blurton Jones, 1997). The\ndebate continues as to whether female menopause is indeed an adaptation or by-product or\nsomething else (see e.g., Coall and Hertwig, 2010; Kachel, Premo, and Hublin, 2011;\nLahdenper\u00e4, Gillespie, Lummaa, and Russell, 2012). Even though postmenopausal lifespan\nis not necessarily an adaptation, there is evidence for the beneficial impact of\ngrandmothers' presence to child survival.\nA significant way that grandmothers may have increased their grandchildren's\nsurvival rates in pre-modern and traditional populations was to improve grandchildren's\nnutritional status (Mace and Sear, 2005). For example, Hawkes and colleagues (1997)\nfound that among Tanzanian hunter-gatherers, help especially from grandmothers improved\nchildren's nutritional status (see also Sear, Mace, and McGregor, 2000).\nIn subsistence societies, the grandmaternal support that improved children's\nnutrition status may have significantly decreased child mortality. In modern western\nsocieties with low child mortality rates, grandmaternal support may still improve children's\nnutritional status. However, grandmaternal support in modern societies may detrimentally\naffect children because it may increase the likelihood of a child becoming overweight.\nStudies have shown that childhood overweight and obesity correlates, for example, with\nincreased risk of diabetes, heart diseases, and premature mortality in later life (see Al\nMamun, Cramb, O'Callaghan, Williams, and Najman, 2009; Ebbeling, Pawlak, and\nStudies from contemporary societies show that living with grandparents may\nincrease children's risk for overweight (Davis, McGonagle, Schoeni, and Stafford, 2008;\nstudied with the British Millennium Cohort Study (the same data I use in this article) an\nassociation between childcare and child overweight. They found that children who were\ncared for by their grandparents were more likely to be overweight than those cared for by\nparents. The present study is an extension of the analysis of Pearce and colleagues (2010).\nMy contribution is to distinguish the effects of maternal and paternal grandmothers. Many\nevolutionary studies have shown that maternal and paternal grandmothers are not in an\nequal position with each other both in pre-modern (e.g., Jamison, Cornell, Jamison, and\nTanskanen, Jokela, and Rotkirch, 2011; Euler and Weitzel, 1996; Pollet, Nettle, and\nresults are often explained with paternity uncertainty and the different reproductive\ninterests between maternal and paternal grandparents (see Coall and Hertwig, 2010; Euler,\nMaternal and paternal grandmothers may not increase grandchildren's nutritional\nstatus equally (Sear and Mace, 2008). Using data from rural Gambia, Sear and colleagues\n(2000) showed that grandchildren living with their non-reproductive maternal\ngrandmothers had a greater likelihood of better nutritional status than others, but living\nwith paternal grandmothers had no significant effect on grandchildren's overall nutritional\nstatus. In addition, in the Kipsigis population from Kenya, kin support was associated with\nGrandmaternal investment and early years overweight\ninfants' well-being to a greater extent in rich than in poor families (Borgerhoff Mulder,\nIn the present study, I analyze the association between grandmaternal childcare and\nchild overweight in the UK. I am especially interested in whether maternal and paternal\ngrandmothers have different effects. In addition, following Borgerhoff Mulder's (2007)\nfinding that in a developing country kin influences child well-being more in rich than in\npoor families, I study whether grandmaternal childcare has different effects according to\nmothers' socioeconomic positions.\nMaterials and Methods\nThis study uses the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) from a representative survey\ncarried out in the UK. The aim of the MCS was to collect longitudinal information on\nchildren born at the beginning of the new millennium. The MCS looked at children, and\ntheir parents or parental figures who answered questions concerning their cohort member\nchildren. I analyzed the data from the second wave of the MCS. The second wave was\ndescription).\nCases where the main respondents were the biological mothers of the child were\nselected. Only those cases where mothers lived with the cohort member child and child's\nbiological father were included. In cases of twins and triplets, only one child of the set was\nincluded. In addition, mothers who did not report their childcare arrangement and children\nwith no height and weight information were excluded. These selections left me with 9,000\nobservations in the sample.\nThe dependent variable was the child's overweight (including obesity) at 3 years\nold. In the second wave of data collection, trained interviewers measured and weighed the\ncohort member children. Overweight was defined by the International Obesity Task Force\ncutoffs for body mass index, which are sex and age specific (at age 3 years: males = 17.89;\nchildren in the study sample were overweight.\nThe main explanatory variable was the childcare arrangement reported by mothers.\nIn the second wave of the MCS mothers reported whether they have used childcare\narrangements and what the main arrangement was. Mothers were asked to report the main\nsource of their childcare arrangement between the children's ages of 9 months and 3 years.\nI have classified the scale into 6 categories: 1 = Parents (no care, respondent herself or\npartner), 2 = Maternal grandmother, 3 = Paternal grandmother, 4 = Other relative, 5 =\nFriend or neighbor, 6 = Formal provider (registered childminder, unregistered childminder,\nworkplace or college day nursery cr\u00e8che, local authority day nursery cr\u00e8che or private day\nnursery cr\u00e8che) (see Table 1).\nGrandmaternal investment and early years overweight\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics (n and %/mean)\nn %/mean\nMain childcare arrangement (%)\nEthnicity (%)\nMother's socio economic circumstance (SEC) (%)\nMother smoked during pregnancy (%)\nMother's pre-pregnancy weight status (%)\nCountry (%)\nI ran my analyses in two phases. First, I employed binary logistic regression models\nto analyze an association between childcare type and child's overweight. Second, I studied\nan interaction between grandmaternal care and mothers' socioeconomic circumstances. I\nran the models as unadjusted and adjusted. Since the results in adjusted and unadjusted\nmodels are quite similar I show only the adjusted results. In the adjusted models I\nGrandmaternal investment and early years overweight\ncontrolled for several potential confounding variables that are shown to correlate with early\nyears overweight (see Brophy et al., 2009; Pearce et al., 2010). These factors are child's\nbirth weight, number of siblings in household, ethnicity, mothers' socioeconomic\ncircumstance, smoking during pregnancy, pre-pregnancy weight status, and country (see\nTable 1). Since mother's age, breastfeeding duration, education, and the existence of\nmaternal or paternal grandmothers do not significantly correlate with child's overweight\nstatus these variables were not added in the models. With the exception of the child's birth\nweight and number of siblings, all variables are categorical. For the analyses I have\ntransformed them into the dummy variables.\nResults\nratio above 1 indicates higher likelihood for child's overweight compared to those who\nreceive main child care from their parents, and an odds ratio below 1 indicates the opposite.\nChild care support from relatives other than grandmothers or friends and neighbors\nbetween the child's ages 9 months and 3 years increase the likelihood for child's\noverweight at the age of 3. However, these differences were not statistically significant. In\naddition, formal childcare arrangements did not increase or decrease the likelihood for\nearly years overweight. The results are quite similar in unadjusted and adjusted models.\nTable 2.

This is due to the relatively low number\nof paternal grandmothers who are the main childcare providers.

Children whose main child minder between the\nages of 9 months and 3 years was a grandmother were more likely to be overweight at the\nage of 3 than those cared for by their parents. The results are in line with the study of\nPearce and colleagues (2010) with the same data. Thus, the present study showed\ngrandmothers' investment correlating with grandchildren's increased risk of overweight in\ncontemporary societies, but this does not vary by lineage. That is to say, grandmothers may\nimpact grandchildren's nutritional status in modern states as they did in some traditional\npopulations (see Hawkes et al., 1997; Sear et al., 2000). Findings from the present study\nshow that maternal and paternal grandmothers seem to increase the risk of child overweight\nequally.\nAccording to Borgerhoff Mulder's (2007) analysis, kin increase child well-being\nGrandmaternal investment and early years overweight\nmore in rich than in poor families. In the present study, I analyzed interaction effects\nbetween grandmaternal childcare and mothers' socioeconomic circumstances. However, I\ndid not find convincing support for the prediction that grandmaternal care differently\ninfluences child overweight status in different socioeconomic positions.\nPrevious studies have shown that in contemporary societies grandparents may\nimprove grandchild well-being. Many studies have detected a correlation between\ngrandparental investment and child well-being measured, for example, by the child's\npsychological adjustment, academic achievement, and mental and physical development\n(e.g., Tanskanen and Danielsbacka, 2012; see Sear and Coall, 2011 for review). The\npresent study shows, however, that grandparental investment may not always be beneficial\nfor children in contemporary societies. To conclude, the results show that the same\ngrandmaternal behavior that may have had beneficial effects for grandchildren in our\nevolutionary past may have opposite effects in modern societies.\n"
