Using a community sample of\nlow-income women, the presence of postpartum depres-\nsive symptoms was associated with decreased odds of hav-\ningasmokedetectororplacingtheinfantonhisorherback\nto sleep and increased odds of using corporal punishment\nduringthefirstyearoflife.5 Smallerdirect-observationstud-\nies have found that depressed mothers were less likely to\nengage in positive developmental behaviors during early\ninteractions, such as talking, playing, or being affection-\nate with their newborns, and were more likely to display\nThe science of early development is clear about the im-\nportance of parenting and early caregiving relationships,\nespecially during infancy, when there is total depen-\ndency for safety, health, protection, nurturing, and stabil-\nity.9,11 Infants'earlydevelopmentalsodependsonthehealth\nand well-being of their parents. When a mother is coping\nwith postpartum depressive symptoms, it places a bur-\nden on the caregiving relationship at a time when early\npatterns of parenting are established.9,11,19 Despite this fact,\nwe are unaware of any studies that have used a diverse,\nlarge nationwide sample to determine whether the pres-\nence of depressive symptoms in mothers is associated with\na broad array of caregiving practices related to health and\ndevelopment in the postpartum period.\nIn this study, we examined whether maternal depres-\nsive symptoms at 2 to 4 months post partum are associ-\nated with parenting practices in a large nationwide sample\nof mothers and infants. We posited that depressive symp-\ntoms exhibited in the early months of caring for an in-\nfant were associated with lower levels of engagement in\npositive parenting behaviors to promote child health and\ndevelopment. The diversity and size of our sample al-\nlowed us to address limitations of smaller studies and ad-\njust for possible confounders of the relationship be-\ntween maternal depressive symptoms and parenting\npractices. We examined 10 parenting practices that fall\ninto 3 domains: safety practices, feeding practices, and\nbehaviors that promote early development. Extensive evi-\ndence, professional guidelines, and the American Acad-\nemy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statements highlight the\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nData for this study were obtained from a sample of interven-\ntion and control group families at 15 sites across the United\nStates that participated in the National Evaluation of Healthy\nSteps for Young Children.28 Healthy Steps is a new model of\npediatric care that incorporates child development specialists\nand enhanced developmental services into pediatric practices\nthat serve families with young children. The design was a ran-\ndomization trial at 6 sites (up to 400 enrolled) and quasi-\nexperimental at 9 sites (up to 200 enrolled at the intervention\nsite and 200 at the comparison site). Sites began staggered en-\nrollment in September 1996 with completion at the last site in\nNewborns whose families intended to use the Healthy Steps\nsites for their care were enrolled consecutively in the hospital\nat birth or at the first office visit within the first 4 weeks of life.\nNewborns were ineligible if they did not complete an office visit\nwithin the first 4 weeks, they were to be adopted or placed in\nfoster care, their mother did not speak English or Spanish, or\ntheir parents expected to move within 6 months. The eligible\nsample for the analyses reported in this article included moth-\ners who completed forms at enrollment and a telephone inter-\nview at 2 to 4 months and who provided self-reported data of\ndepressive symptoms using a 14-item modified Center for Epi-\ndemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at 2 to 4 months.\nTwo data sources, available in English and Spanish, were used.\nThe first was a short questionnaire completed by parents at the\ntime of entry into Healthy Steps; this questionnaire provided ma-\nternal and family demographic characteristics. The second was\na computer-assisted Healthy Steps telephone interview con-\nducted with the mother (virtually all respondents) when the child\nwas2to4monthsofage.Thestructuredinterviewincludedques-\ntions about the presence of depressive symptoms, early parent-\ning practices, and additional demographic characteristics.29\nThe 10 early parenting practices included in this study were\nselected from 17 parenting practices included in the Healthy\nSteps interview. They were selected based on evidence of their\nimportance for child health and development, near complete\ndata, and variability at 2 to 4 months. Two dichotomous vari-\nables were chosen to assess infant safety practices: using the\nprone sleep position at both naptime and bedtime and lower-\ning the temperature of the hot water heater in the home. Plac-\ning an infant to sleep in the supine or stomach position is as-\nsociated with sudden infant death syndrome, the leading cause\nof postneonatal mortality in the United States.30 Since 1992, the\nAAP has recommended that newborns be placed on their backs\nto sleep.21 Lowering the hot water temperature is an impor-\ntant preventive safety measure to decrease tap water scald burns,\nThe 4 infant feeding practices included continuation of\nbreastfeeding at 2 to 4 months among mothers who had ever\nput the infant to the breast and whether or not the infant had\nbeen given water, juice, or cereal during the last week. The AAP\nadvises that breast milk or infant formula provides sufficient\nnutrients in the first 4 to 6 months. Breastfeeding is associated\nwith decreased infectious and chronic diseases and has shown\na modest positive influence on infant cognitive develop-\nment.24,33 The early use of juice in the diet can result in insuf-\nficient nutrition, dental caries, and short stature34; early water\nuse is associated with electrolyte imbalance and can lead to wa-\nter intoxication and even death35; and there is no nutritional\nindication to introduce cereal before the age of 4 months.36 Four\npractices to foster healthy development included showing books\ndaily to the infant, playing daily with the infant, talking daily\nto the infant while working in the home, and following 2 or\nmore routines at meals, naptime, and bedtime. To promote de-\nvelopment, showing books from infancy onward has been posi-\ntively associated with subsequent language acquisition and\nschool achievement.37,38 The 3 other parenting practices--\ntalking to, playing with, and establishing predictable routines\nfor infants--provide important opportunities to stimulate cog-\nnitive, social, physical, and emotional development.37,39\nThe presence of maternal depressive symptoms was mea-\nsured in the 2- to 4-month interview using a modified version\nof the CES-D. The CES-D is a 20-item self-report scale de-\nsigned to measure the frequency of depressive symptoms ex-\nperienced in the previous week.40 Using the modified 14-item\nCES-D, scores of 11 or higher indicated the presence of ma-\nternal depressive symptoms; this value was calibrated against\nthe cutoff of 16 used for the 20-item scale. Correlation of the\nreduced-item version with the full 20-item scale exceeded 0.95\nin a sample of high-risk pregnant women.41 The  coefficient\n\u00a92006 American Medical Association.

Multiple logistic regression models were used to\nestimate the overall unadjusted and adjusted relations of the\npresence of maternal depressive symptoms with parenting prac-\ntices. These models assessed whether differences by depres-\nsive symptoms were due to covariates that may potentially be\nassociated with both depressive symptoms and parenting prac-\ntices. These covariates were mother's age, race, ethnicity, mari-\ntal or partner status, level of education, and employment sta-\ntus; whether she was a first-time mother; father's employment\nstatus; household income; whether the family owned their home;\nand child's age (Table 1).\nIn addition, because of a possible correlation of observa-\ntions among families receiving pediatric care at the same site,\nmultiple logistic regression analyses were also adjusted for the\nsite of health care and enrollment in the Healthy Steps inter-\nvention group. Analyses were conducted using SAS statistical\nsoftware, version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).\nTheCommitteeonHumanSubjectsResearchoftheJohnsHop-\nkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the institutional re-\nviewboardofColumbiaUniversityCollegeofPhysiciansandSur-\ngeonsgrantedstudyapproval.Forparticipantsinthisstudy,written\ninformedconsentwasobtainedatthetimeofenrollment,andoral\nconsent was obtained before the 2- to 4-month interview.\nRESULTS\nmothers (87.9%) completed the 2- to 4-month survey,\nWhen compared with nonresponders, mothers in the\nsample were more likely to be older than 20 years, white,\nnon-Hispanic, married, and high school graduates and\nto report that the infant's father was employed.\nTable 1 shows the percentage of women with depres-\nsive symptoms by demographic characteristics and the\ndistribution of the demographic characteristics for the\ntotal sample. At 2 to 4 months post partum, 17.8% of\nmothers reported depressive symptoms. Mothers who\nwere younger than 20 years, from a minority back-\nground, Hispanic, and not living with the biological fa-\nther of the child, who had low incomes, and who had\nless than a high school education were more likely to re-\nport depressive symptoms than mothers without these\ncharacteristics (Table 1).

Among mothers who\nhad ever breastfed (76% for women without depressive\nsymptoms and 71% for women with depressive symp-\ntoms), mothers with depressive symptoms had more than\none-quarter reduced odds of continuing to breastfeed at\n2 to 4 months compared with mothers without depres-\nsive symptoms (Tables 2 and 3).\nSmaller percentages of mothers with depressive symp-\ntoms reported positive developmental parenting prac-\ntices than mothers without symptoms; the odds of each\npractice also differed significantly in both the unad-\njusted and adjusted logistic regression models.

Although we\nposited that there would be a significant relation between\neach of the parenting practices and the presence of mater-\nnaldepressivesymptoms,wefoundthatthesafetyandfeed-\ning practices did not vary by depressive symptoms, after\nadjustment for covariates, with 1 exception. After control-\nling for covariates, we found that mothers with depressive\nsymptoms had decreased odds of continuing breastfeed-\ning. Our breastfeeding findings are different from those re-\nported by Chung et al,5 who found no difference in breast-\nfeeding duration for longer than 1 month. Their study used\na smaller, community-based low-income sample, whereas\nthis study used a larger, diverse national sample.\nAfter adjusting for covariates, we also found that moth-\nerswithdepressivesymptomshaddecreasedoddsofshow-\ning picture books, playing and talking with their infants,\nand following daily routines. These findings suggest that\nparentingpracticesthatrequiremoreactiveinteractionwith\ninfants, such as continuing breastfeeding and playing or\ntalking with the infant, were reduced.

This may be due to the more de-\nmanding nature of parenting toddlers. In both studies,\nhowever, the presence of depressive symptoms resulted\nin reduced odds of mothers showing books or reading\nto their children on a daily basis, a parenting behavior\nthat requires more sustained interaction from the mother.\nSeveral limitations to this study should be noted. First,\nself-report measures of parenting may lead to overreport-\ning of behaviors that are socially desirable among mothers\nwhodonothavedepressivesymptoms.Inthisstudy,which\nused a broad array of parenting practices, we have no evi-\ndence of overstating for mothers with or without depres-\nsive symptoms. Among mothers with depressive symp-\ntoms, the bias may be in the opposite direction, with the\ndepressive symptoms leading to underestimates of actual\nparenting practices as a result of feelings of decreased self-\nefficacy about parenting ability.2 However, the review by\nRichters43 of 22 studies suggests that depressed mothers\ndo not have distorted perceptions of their children. In ad-\ndition, D'Souza-Vazirani et al44 found no difference in the\nvalidity of maternal report for children's short-term health\ncareusebasedonthepresenceofmaternaldepressivesymp-\ntoms. Our study findings suggest that it is possible to iden-\ntify reduced positive parenting practices among mothers\nwith depressive symptoms without having to use expen-\nsivedirect-observationmeasures.Althougharecentstudy45\nsuggests variability in the validity of self-reported home\nsafety practices, lowering water temperature was among\nthe more reliable measures and sleep position was not as-\nsessed.\nSecond, we used a self-report measure for depressive\nsymptoms as opposed to a structured diagnostic instru-\nment. Nevertheless, prior studies2 have found signifi-\ncant relationships between diminished parenting and self-\nreported depressive symptoms and suggest that the\nnondiagnostic CES-D may be more appropriate and pref-\nerable for pediatric practice and policy.\nThe findings from this study offer important impli-\ncations for pediatric health care professionals and prac-\ntice. The first is the need to screen for maternal depres-\nsive symptoms among all mothers during the postpartum\nperiod, when parenting practices are being established\nand when pediatric practices have frequent contact with\nfamilies to provide guidance. Experts have stated that the\nscope of professional responsibility for pediatric physi-\ncians includes universal screening, guidance, and refer-\nvices Task Force has recommended 2-item screeners by\nprimary care professionals to detect depressive symp-\ntoms.48 A recent study49 in a busy urban pediatric prac-\ntice found a significant increase in the detection of de-\npressive symptoms among mothers during the first\npostpartum year following implementation of a uni-\nversal postpartum depression screening during well-\nchild care visits. Second, the challenge and opportu-\nnity for pediatricians when providing anticipatory\nguidance to mothers with depressive symptoms are to\ndiscuss the mother's engagement in parenting prac-\ntices that require more ongoing interactions, such as\ncontinuing breastfeeding, playing, talking, providing\nroutines, and showing books.\nThe results of this study add to the burgeoning evi-\ndence that highlights the importance of screening for\nmaternal depressive symptoms in the postpartum period.\nOnce depressive symptoms are identified, pediatric health\ncare professionals have an important role in providing on-\ngoing counseling and anticipatory guidance to enhance pa-\nrental efficacy, as well as in referring mothers to appropri-\nate health care professionals to assist with their depressive\nsymptoms.4,50 To maximize pediatric physician interac-\ntions with mothers with depressive symptoms, further ef-\nforts are needed to ensure that linkages exist between adult\nand pediatric systems of care and that communities have\nadequate mental health resources. Such an approach has\nthe potential to foster positive parenting, child health and\ndevelopment, and family well-being.\nCorrespondence: Cynthia S.
