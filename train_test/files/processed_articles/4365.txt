    "abstract": "Abstract\nMost Veterans who use the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) also utilize private-sector health care providers. To\nbetter inform local and regional health care planning, we assessed the association between reliance on VHA ambulatory\ncare and total and system-specific preventable hospitalization rates (PHRs) at the state level. We conducted a retrospective\ndynamic cohort study using Veterans with diabetes mellitus, aged 66 years or older, and dually enrolled in VHA and Medicare\nparts A and B from 2004 to 2010. While controlling for median age and proportion of males, we measured the association\nbetween reliance on VHA ambulatory care and PHRs at the state level using multivariable ordinary least square regression,\ngeographically weighted regression, and generalized additive models. We measured geospatial patterns in PHRs using global\nMoran's I and univariate local indicator spatial analysis. Approximately 30% of hospitalized Veterans experienced a preventable\nhospitalization. Reliance on VHA ambulatory care at the state level ranged from 13.92% to 67.78% and was generally not\nassociated with PHRs. Geospatial analysis consistently identified a cluster of western states with low PHRs from 2006 to\n2010. Given the generally low reliance on VHA ambulatory care and lack of association between this reliance and PHRs, policy\nchanges to improve Veterans' health care outcomes should address private-sector care in addition to VHA care.\n",

The prevalence of\ndiabetes is over 9% in the general US population and\napproximately 25% among Veterans actively utilizing the\nVeterans Health Administration (VHA).1,2 Regular health\ncare visits to primary care providers and specialists are\nprominent features of diabetes management. Of 22 million\nliving Veterans, 9 million have enrolled in Veterans Affairs\n(VA) services and 5.9 million are regular users of the VHA.3\nVHA offers a spectrum of integrated health care services\nincluding preventive, ambulatory, and inpatient care. VHA\nfunctions as a safety net provider for some Veterans, poten-\ntially mitigating the effects of barriers to accessing private-\nsector health care services. VHA also utilizes an integrated\nelectronic medical record system, which makes all care\nreceived within the system available to all VHA providers\nand facilitates better care coordination within the system.\nStudies have reported better uptake of preventive services\nin the VHA as compared with the private sector.4-7\nNumerous studies have also indicated that VHA performs\nbetter than the private sector in the ambulatory care and\nmanagement of diabetes, including diabetes care processes,\npreventive services, patient satisfaction, patient education,\nand management of blood sugar and cholesterol levels.7,8\nDespite the promise of comprehensive and coordinated\ncare, few veterans receive all of their care from VHA.9-11\nFor example, among Medicare eligible veterans, a plurality\n(46%) utilize VHA and private-sector services.12 Although\nhaving coverage for services in 2 systems may result in\nincreased choice and improved access to care, some studies\nindicate that Veterans who receive care outside of the VHA\nare more likely to experience poor outcomes.13,14\nPreventable hospitalizations (PHs) reflect access to high-\nquality ambulatory care. They represent potentially avoid-\nable hospitalizations for conditions that can be controlled\nwith timely access to high-quality ambulatory care.15,16 The\nambulatory care may not prevent disease progression, but if\nproper care is received in a timely manner, hospitalization\nfor complications may be less likely.\nAlthough VHA and Medicare are federally funded and\noperated programs, regional variations in utilization pat-\nterns and distribution of resources have been observed in\nboth programs.17-19 For instance, the administrative region\nof VHA made up of northeastern states was found to have\nthe greatest rate of hospitalizations as compared with\nregions in the rest of the country.17 Availability of VHA\nresources also varies at the state level with the number of\noperational VA medical centers ranging from 1 in the state\nof Alaska to 14 in the state of New York.19 Multiple studies\nhave also found differences (at state or hospital referral\nlevel) in the amount of Medicare spending per beneficiary\nand the quality of care received.18,20-22 The ratio of provid-\ners to persons, which may impact access to Medicare pro-\nviders, also varies drastically from state to state. For\nSuch variation in health care resources may impact\npatients' access to care, regardless of health care coverage.\nState laws and policies directly regulate many aspects of\nhealth care delivery (eg, medical professional licensure,\ncertification for large capital investments, insurance cover-\nage), making state-level analyses important and relevant\nfor health services research.\nWe explore variability in state-level VHA and private-\nsector preventable hospitalization rates (PHRs) among veter-\nans with diabetes dually enrolled in VHA and Medicare. This\npopulation offers a unique opportunity to examine the poten-\ntial impact of dual-system ambulatory care use on PHs.\nGiven the VHA's integrated system, we hypothesize that\nstates in which Veterans demonstrate greater reliance on\nVHA ambulatory care will demonstrate lower PHRs. The\nfindings have implications for state and federal policies\nregarding Veteran utilization of and access to high-quality\nambulatory care, more generally.\nMaterials and Methods\nIRB Approval\nOur study was approved via an expedited review by the\nVeterans Affairs New Jersey Healthcare System's\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) (study IRB No. 01191).\nGiven that our study is a retrospective assessment of data\nfrom de-identified medical records, we were approved for\nwaiver of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\nAct (HIPAA) authorization and waiver of patient consent.\nStudy Design\nWe conducted a retrospective dynamic cohort study with cal-\n24 months preceding each outcome year serving as a base-\nline period. We identified the state of residence during the\noutcome year for each VHA user with diabetes.\nData Sources\ngraphic summary, inpatient, outpatient, and long-term care\nfile extracts from VHA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW)\nproduction tables and VA Information Resource Center\n(VIReC) Medicare and Medicaid data files.24,25\nWe used SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 software for data\ncleaning and manipulation on Veterans Affairs Informatics\nand Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), the VA's cloud plat-\nSample Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria\nThe study population consisted of Veterans with diabetes\nmellitus type 1 or 2, who were 66 years of age or older as of\nJanuary 1 of each baseline period and dually enrolled in\nVHA and Medicare during baseline and outcome years. To\nidentify patients with diabetes, we modified the method pub-\nlished by Miller et al.28 We defined diabetes based on at least\n1 inpatient stay or 2 outpatient face-to-face visits associated\nwith an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth\nRevision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code\nfor diabetes mellitus (250.xx) during the baseline period. We\ndefined face-to-face visits as in-person encounters involving\na clinician with independent decision-making capacity; we\nidentified face-to-face visits based on Current Procedural\nTerminology (CPT) codes associated with each visit.\nWe excluded patients from the study for the following\nreasons in the order listed: died before start of outcome year,\nlacked continuous (full 36 months) Medicare part A and B\ncoverage during study period, participated in a Health\nMaintenance Organization (HMO) for 1 month or longer\nduring study period, used hospice services or experienced at\nHelmer et al 3\nleast 1 long-term stay at a skilled nursing facility during\nstudy period, experienced a hospital stay of longer than 180\ndays during the study period, and/or did not have an outpa-\ntient face-to-face visit or an inpatient stay in either system\nduring baseline years.\nDependent Variable\nOur outcome of interest was any PH experienced by the\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) def-\ninition of the Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) as our\ndefinition of PHs.29 We identified PQIs based on the associ-\nated ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes. PQIs we measured\nincluded (1) diabetes short-term complications, (2) diabetes\nlong-term complications, (3) chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease, (4) asthma,(5) hypertension, (6) congestive heart\nfailure, (7) dehydration, (8) bacterial pneumonia infections,\n(9) urinary tract infections, (10) angina without a procedure,\n(11) uncontrolled diabetes, and (12) lower extremity\namputations.\nWe calculated PHRs by dividing the total number of\nunique patients in each state who experienced at least 1 epi-\nsode of a PH during the outcome year by the number who\nwere hospitalized during the outcome year. We distinguished\nbetween total PHR (Medicare [MC] and VHA PHRs com-\nbined) and system-level PHR (ie, MC PHR and VHA PHR).\nIndependent Variables\nThe key independent variable in our analysis was percent\nreliance on VHA ambulatory care. We adjusted for median\nage of patients and proportion of males. We measured all\nvariables at the patient level and aggregated to the state level.\nWe defined reliance on VHA as the proportion of all outpa-\ntient face-to-face visits that were made to VHAfacilities [VHA\nvisits / (VHA visits + Medicare visits)]. We measured utiliza-\ntion of ambulatory care services as the number of outpatient\nface-to-face visits made by patients residing in a particular\nstate to providers in the VHA and in the Medicare system dur-\ning the baseline period. We excluded visits associated with\nurgent care (VHA-associated primary clinic stop code: emer-\ngency medicine, admitting/screening, emergency department,\nobservation emergency room, observation psychiatry, obser-\nvation rehabilitation, observation spinal cord, observation\nmedicine, observation neurology, observation surgery, and\nurgent care unit; Medicare-treating provider was listed as\nemergency medicine, or the revenue center code listed on the\nclaim was associated with emergency medicine).\nSpatial and Statistical Analyses\nGeomapping.We mapped the state-level total PHR, VHA\nPHR, and MC PHR using ArcGIS 10.3.30 Given the distribu-\ncutoff points to group state-level PHRs in each year.\nGlobal Moran's I and LISA. We used global Moran's I to deter-\nmine whether there are clustering of PHRs among states. The\nglobal Moran's I is an indicator of spatial association and\nranges between -1 (clustering of dissimilar values) and +1\n(clustering of similar values). A value of 0 for Moran's I indi-\ncates absence of clusters.\nWe used the univariate local indicator spatial analysis\n(LISA) to identify the location and type of clusters present.31\nSpatial patterns which can be visualized with this technique\ninclude low-low cluster, high-high cluster, high-low outlier,\nand low-high outlier. For example, high-high cluster indi-\ncates that a state with higher than average value of PHs is\nsurrounded by neighboring states with higher than average\nvalue of PHs. High-low and low-high outliers indicate ran-\ndom dispersion of PHR rates.\nOLS regression. We used multivariable ordinary least squares\n(OLS) regression to evaluate the association between reli-\nance on VHA ambulatory care and PHRs at the state level. In\nthese models, a negative coefficient indicates that higher\nreliance on VHA ambulatory care is associated with lower\nPHRs and a positive coefficient indicates that higher reliance\non VHA ambulatory care is associated with higher PHRs.\nWe also used geographically weighted regression\n(GWR) to summarize spatially varying relationships between\nVHA reliance and PHRs. GWR is a local spatial statistical\ntechnique that can be applied to produce locally specific param-\neters and to, therefore, examine the regression parameter vary-\ning across states.32 GWR operates under the assumption that\ninformation from nearby states is more important than distant\nstates. We calculated separate t statistics for each centered state\nand used the cutoff points \u00b11.96 to identify correlations\nbetween the VHA ambulatory care reliance and PHRs.\nGAM. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) to reassess\nthe association between VHA ambulatory care reliance and\nPHRs while controlling for any variance that may result from\nphysical geographic differences among states. GAM is a non-\nparametric generalization of multiple linear regression which\ncan identify a more realistic effect of the geographic location by\nuse of smooth functions instead of least squares fit.33\nWe used the \"mgcv\" package in R for the GAMs, GWR\nused a P value of .05 to assess significance for all analyses.\nWe used 50 observations (one for each state) for the OLS,\nGWR, and the GAM analyses.\nResults\nCohort characteristics for all outcome years have been sum-\nmarized at the state level in Table 1.

We\nmeasured associations between VHA ambulatory care reliance and PHRs only for the subpopulation of hospitalized patients. We controlled for median\nage and sex proportions at the state level in all analysis models.\naA negative parameter estimate indicates that higher reliance on VHA ambulatory care is associated with lower PHRs, and a positive coefficient indicates\nthat higher reliance on VHA ambulatory care is associated with higher PHRs.\nbThe percentage of the 50 state-level associations between reliance on VHA ambulatory care and PHRs (VHA, Medicare, total) falling below the 95%\noutcome year.\ncA negative parameter estimate indicates that higher reliance on VHA ambulatory care is associated with lower PHRs and a positive coefficient indicates\nthat higher reliance on VHA ambulatory care is associated with higher PHRs, while controlling for variance resulting from physical geographic variations\namong states.\nthe integrated nature of the VHA system and numerous pub-\nlications touting VHA success in ambulatory care through\nvarious metrics, we expected higher state-level reliance on\nVHA ambulatory care to be associated with lower PHRs.\nFailure to demonstrate this association using several analytic\napproaches raises the possibility that despite greater reliance\non VHA ambulatory care services, other factors negate the\nexpected benefits in VHA quality of and access to\nambulatory care for veterans at the state level. In support of\nour findings, some published analyses have found that dual\nVHA and Medicare health care utilization may actually com-\npromise quality of care or result in provision of redundant ser-\nvices.13,14,38 Perhaps the fragmentation of care resulting from\nthe use of ambulatory care services across systems cancels\nout the benefits of utilizing superior VHA services.\nIt is also possible that differences in the quality of ambu-\nlatory care between VHA and private-sector providers are\nnot sufficient to impact the PHR at the state level. However,\nthis would contradict numerous reports of the superiority of\nVHApreventiveanddiabetesambulatorycare.4-8 Equivalency\nbetween VHA and private-sector ambulatory care is not the\nmost plausible explanation for our finding of no association\nbetween PHs and the reliance on VHA ambulatory care. The\nmost likely explanation for the observed lack of association\nis based on the fact that reliance on VHA outpatient services\nin this sample was generally less than 30% and decreased\nslightly over the study period. This relatively low reliance on\nVHA services is consistent with other published reports of\nVHA ambulatory care, despite being widely acknowledged\nas equivalent or even superior to private sector, was not asso-\nciated with PHRs at the state level. Perhaps the overall utili-\nzation of VHA ambulatory services by elderly veterans with\ndiabetes does not achieve the minimal threshold of engage-\nment with VHA ambulatory services necessary to reap the\nbenefits. Further research is necessary to explore these pos-\nsible explanations.\nOur analysis is the most comprehensive examination of\nPHRs among VHA users reported in the literature. As\nexpected, most dually enrolled Veterans who were hospital-\nized experienced their inpatient stay in the private sector\n(>80% across study years), not VHA. This reliance on the\nprivate sector for inpatient services varied little across states\nand study years, indicating a pervasive and enduring pattern\nand underscoring the importance of including data from\nVHA and non-VHA sources. Because we examined the total-\nity of hospitalizations considered preventable, our findings\nare more robust and meaningful than if we had considered\nVHA or private-sector hospitalizations in isolation. For vet-\nerans who use both VHA and private-sector ambulatory care,\napportioning responsibility for PHs to one or the other sys-\ntem is impossible. In absolute terms, PHs are an uncommon\noutcome; fewer than 10% of veterans in our sample experi-\nenced a PH per year, and only 1% to 2% experienced a PH in\nVHA. Limiting our sample to those with a hospitalization\nenriches the prevalence of the outcome and also partially\ncontrols for unmeasured severity of illness and disease sever-\nity. By aggregating patient experience to the state level,\nincluding both VHA and private-sector hospitalizations, lim-\niting the statistical modeling to only those with a hospitaliza-\ntion, and using multiple modeling approaches, we designed\nour analyses with the power to detect even a small\nassociation between reliance on VHA ambulatory care and\nPHR at the state level and yet did not find this association.\nOur state-level findings of PHRs are consistent with other\nstudies of health care quality, supporting our use of PHRs as\na focus for these analyses. There is a range of PHRs across\nstates, although the PHRs of each state are largely consistent\nacross study years. The presence of a cluster of states in the\nWestern United States with lower PHRs throughout the study\nyears suggests that broader market forces, patient prefer-\nences, or standards of practice may be a stronger influence\non state PHR than VHA reliance. The high-high cluster\ninconsistently present in the central Midwest region over the\nstudy years similarly speaks to a regional effect. The states\nwith the highest PHRs according to our calculations (see\nSupplemental Table 1) are Louisiana (LA), Kentucky (KY),\nWest Virginia (WV), Indiana (IN), Ohio (OH), Massachusetts\n(MA), and Rhode Island (RI). At the other end of the rank-\nings, Utah (UT), Idaho (ID), Arizona (AZ), Florida (FL),\nHawaii (HI), Washington (WA), and California (CA) are\nconsistently among the states with the lowest PHRs.\nAccording to America's Health Rankings, an annual compi-\nlation of state-level health and health care statistics, LA, WV,\nKY, OH, and IN also consistently rank among the 10 states\nwith the highest PHRs for Medicare enrollees.42 MA and RI\nrank in the bottom 40% for PHRs among Medicare enrollees.\nConsistent with our findings of low PHRs for veterans with\ndiabetes, UT, ID, HI, WA, AZ, and CA are among the states\nwith the lowest PHRs for Medicare enrollees. Florida, on the\ncontrary, ranks in the bottom half for PHR.43 The discrep-\nancy between PHRs for veterans of Florida indicates the pos-\nsibility that Veterans' health care experience may differ from\nthat of non-Veterans, at least in some states. Overall, how-\never, our PHRs are consistent with the experience in most of\nthe states with PHRs at either end of the spectrum, support-\ning the external validity of our findings.\nOur findings may be applicable to other cohorts of VHA\nusers, as most veterans use a combination of VHA and pri-\nvate-sector care. Dual-system use is likely to increase further\nthrough the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act\nChoice Act allows eligible Veterans who have difficulty\nreceiving care at a VHA facility (for reasons such as long\ntravel time and/or unavailability of appointments) to receive\ncare from private-sector providers in their community at the\nexpense of theVHA. Since the implementation of theVeterans\nChoice Act, 500 000 private-sector providers have joined the\nVHA network to provide care to Veterans in the community.44\nStrengthening and adapting the relationship with these pro-\nviders may be an opportunity to experiment with care coordi-\nnation and other interventions to improve quality and access\nto ambulatory care. Exploring the relationship between reli-\nance on VHA ambulatory care and PHRs in younger groups\nof VHA users, in particular, will require analysis of data from\nVHA and commercial insurance plans.\nHelmer et al 9\nOur findings indicate that federal and state policy makers\nmay wish to more closely examine the role of VHA ambula-\ntory services for elderly Veterans with diabetes who are\nenrolled in both VHA and the Medicare program within a\nstate. The lack of association between reliance on VHA\nambulatory care and PHs may signal a limited role for VHA\nin the totality of care for this population and suggest new\ninterventions to optimize the use of health care resources at a\nstate level. To date, VHA's efforts to monitor and improve\nquality of care focused primarily on VHA facilities. Our find-\nings suggest that additional care coordination resources, a\nmajor focus of preventing hospitalizations and rehospitaliza-\ntions,42,45 may have a greater impact on veterans' health if\ndirected toward care in the private sector. However, given the\nlow rates of hospitalization of these veterans in VHA, perhaps\nVHA should focus on ambulatory care and improved coordi-\nnation of care, rather than on inpatient services. Although the\nstate-level variability in VHA ambulatory care reliance and\nhospitalization rates was not large, it is possible that different\napproaches may be more effective in different states.\nStrengths and Weaknesses\nThese analyses of PHRs represent an overview of state-level\nambulatory care for older Veterans with diabetes and test the\nhypothesis that VHA reliance on ambulatory care is associ-\nated with PHRs at the state level. We captured the entire\npopulation of VHAusers with diabetes over 65 years old dur-\ning the study years, a strength of this analysis. We also used\nthe PQI methodology, an accepted industry standard, for\ndetermining PHRs. The utility of this methodology, although\nnot universally accepted, has been recognized through con-\ntinued promulgation by health care policy and research enti-\nties. The data used in the analyses include VHA clinical and\nboth VHA and Medicare claims data and represent a near\ntotality of inpatient and ambulatory care services for this\npopulation. By utilizing several different models to analyze\nthe geographic variation at the state level, we are confident\nthat the findings are robust. There is the possibility of misat-\ntribution of individual veterans' care to a state if their resi-\ndence was different from the state in which they received\nhealth care; we suspect that outpatient VHA care mostly\noccurred in the state of residence. In addition, we arbitrarily\nchose the state of residence at the beginning of the outcome\nyear, resulting in possible misclassification due to receipt of\nambulatory care during the baseline period being in a differ-\nent state from the outcome year. However, state of residence\nchanged for less than 2% of any outcome year cohort between\nfirst and second baseline years (data not shown). Therefore,\nwe do not anticipate misattributed state of residence to affect\nour results in a meaningful way.\nWe did not include Medicaid and other non-Medicare\nprivate-sector care in our analysis. Only 6% of the cohort\nwas enrolled in Medicaid in any given year (data not shown).\nBecause Medicare is the primary payer for individuals dually\nenrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, our analysis captures\nany services covered by both plans. Common Medicaid ser-\nvices, such as nursing home care and personal care services,\nare of less relevance to our study because we focus on com-\nmunity-dwelling Veterans. Considering the median age in\nour cohort was 74 to 75 years, we anticipate that a negligible\nproportion may also have had coverage through a private\nhealth insurance plan.\nConclusions\nGiven the unanticipated lack of association between reliance\non VHA ambulatory care services and PHRs across states,\nfederal and state officials may want to reconsider how best to\nallocate resources to ensure access to and quality of ambula-\ntory care services for Veterans. Examining the totality of\nhealth care utilization utilized by veterans may suggest new\napproaches.\n"
