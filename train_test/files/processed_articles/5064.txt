Thus, the aim of\nthe present study was to evaluate whether\nendothelial damage mediators participate in\nthe relationship between EAT thickness and\nsubclinical atherogenesis in a study popula-\ntion that was stratified by conventional\ncardiovascular risk factors.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective cross-sectional cohort\nstudy included patients >18 years of age\nwho were evaluated in the Department of\nEchocardiography, National Medical Center\n`20 de Noviembre' ISSSTE, Mexico City,\n2016 following referral by health-care units\nthat serve the general population in Mexico\nCity. Echocardiography was performed as a\nfollow-up procedure in patients with coron-\nary artery disease or during a routine evalu-\nation in non-ischemic patients who displayed\na variable number of cardiovascular risk\nfactors, and in whom heart disease was\nsuspected. Patients undergoing echocardiog-\nraphy were sequentially enrolled according to\nto obtain balanced groups stratified accord-\ning to a cut-off for significant conventional\ncardiovascular risk factors (considered to be\nsignificant if FS !20%).\nPatients with pericardial effusion or per-\nipheral artery disease were excluded, as were\npatients who had undergone heart surgery,\nsuch as coronary artery bypass grafting or\naortic and mitral valve repair or replace-\nment, due to the possibility that EAT had\nbeen manipulated during the surgical pro-\ncedure. Patients with stroke were also\nexcluded to focus the analyses on conven-\ntional cardiovascular risk factors without\nundue influence by other factors, such as\ncardio embolism.\nSmoking history was obtained from\npatients during a medical interview, and\nnonsmokers were defined as having never\nsmoked during their lifetime. The number of\npack years was calculated as the number of\ncigarettes smoked per day/20, multiplied by\nthe time (years) smoked.\nThis study was designed and performed\naccording to ethical guidelines of the 1975\nDeclaration of Helsinki, and approved by\nthe Local Committees of Research, Ethics in\nResearch and Biosafety of the Centro Me\n\u00b4 dico\nNacional `20 de Noviembre' ISSSTE, Mexico\npants provided written informed consent.\nAnthropometry and blood pressure\nBody mass index was calculated as weight/\nheight2 (kg/m2). Waist circumference was\nmeasured half way between the lowest rib\nmargin and the iliac crest at the end of a\nnormal expiration. Hip circumference was\nmeasured around the widest portion of the\nbuttocks with the tape parallel to the floor.\nThe waist-to-hip ratio was calculated by\ndividing waist circumference by hip circum-\nference. Blood pressure was obtained while\nthe patient was in a seated position and was\nconsidered to be the mean of three readings\ntaken 5 min apart using a Welch Allyn 767\nmobile aneroid sphygmomanometer (Welch\nAllyn Inc.; Skaneateles Falls, NY, USA).\nMeasurement of plasma biomarkers\nFollowing a 12-h fast, venous blood samples\n(4 ml) were collected into BD Vacutainer\u00d5\ntubes (Becton, Dickinson & Co., Franklin\nLakes, NJ, USA) containing 1.8mg ethylene-\ndiaminetetra-acetic acid/ml of blood, centri-\ninto fractions and stored at \u00c080 C prior to\nanalyses. Plasma levels of triglycerides, total\ncholesterol, high-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein chol-\nesterol (LDL-C), glycosylated haemoglobin\n) and glucose were determined using\nroutine clinical laboratory equipment and a\nstandard auto-analyser (Synchron CX\u00d59\nPRO Clinical System; Beckman Coulter,\nBrea, CA, USA).\nPlasma markers were analysed in the\nResearch Laboratory of Experimental\nMetabolism and Clinical Research, Centro\nMe\n\u00b4 dico Nacional `20 de Noviembre' ISSSTE,\nMexico City: sICAM-1 levels were determined\nusing commercially available immunoassay\nPeraza-Zaldi\nkits (Quantikine\u00d5 enzyme-linked immuno-\nsorbent assay: Human ICAM-1/CD54 Allele-\nspecific Immunoassay; R&D Systems Inc.,\nMinneapolis, MN, USA). Malondialdehyde\n(MDA) levels were determined using a pub-\nlished method based on the reaction of MDA\nabsorbance of the resultant pink colour was\nread at a wavelength of 532nm. Between the\nfirst and second month following sample\ncollection, NO levels were determined by the\ncadmium-mediated reduction of nitrates to\nnitrites, and subsequent measurement of nitrite\nconcentration using a colorimetric Griess\nType 2 diabetes mellitus was defined\nusing guidelines of the American Diabetes\nAssociation15 in patients having one of\nthe following conditions (repeated for con-\nfirmation at a separate date [JAP-Z]):\n200mg/dl during an oral glucose tolerance\ntest. Hypertension was defined as blood pres-\ndefined as one or more of the following con-\nDiagnostic imaging\nTo determine EAT thickness, two-dimensional,\nM-mode and Doppler transthoracic echocar-\ndiography were performed in the left lateral\nposition using a Philips iE33 cardiac ultra-\nsound system (Philips Medical Systems,\nAndover, MA, USA) and a Phillips iE33\nS5-1 Transducer (Royal Philips, Amsterdam,\nThe Netherlands). EAT thickness was\ndefined as the space between the visceral\nlayer of the pericardium and the outer border\nof the myocardium, which registered on the\nstandard parasternal longitudinal axis and\ntransverse images. The aortic ring was used\nas the anatomical reference for the large axis\nparasternal view, and the papillary muscles\nwere used for the short axis. The images\nwere acquired in bi-dimensional mode, per-\npendicular to the free wall of the right\nventricle, at the end of systole, over three\ncardiac cycles.\nIn addition, the following echocardio-\ngraphic parameters were measured using the\nguidelines of the American Society of\nEchocardiography: left ventricle ejection\nfraction was measured using a modified\nSimpson method.16 The global longitudinal\nstrain (fractional change, expressed as a\npositive or negative percentage, that reflects\nthe lengthening or shortening of a myocar-\ndial segment, respectively) was measured as\nthe mean of the left ventricular segments\nlongitudinal strains.17 Diastolic dysfunction\n(the decline in ventricular performance\nduring diastole, due to abnormal myocar-\ndial relaxation and passive left ventricular\npressures) was classified as follows: Grade\nI (mild), if mitral E/A ratio < 0.8 (where\nE \u00bc early diastole wave and A \u00bc end-dia-\nstole [atrial contraction] wave), deceleration\ntime > 200 ms, isovolumetric relaxation time\n!100 ms, predominant systolic flow is\nobserved in pulmonary venous inflow (S/\nD > 1 [where S \u00bc peak systolic flow and\nD \u00bc peak anterograde diastolic flow]),\ne'< 8cm/s (where e'\u00bc diastolic peak velocity\nof the movement of the annulus towards the\nleft atrium during initial filling of the left\nventricle) and E/e' ratio< 8, either septal or\nlateral; Grade II (moderate), if mitral E/A\nratio\u00bc 0.8\u00ad1.5 (pseudonormal) and decreases\nby 50% during the Valsalva manoeuver,\ne'< 8cm/s and E/e' ratio\u00bc 9\u00ad12 (additional\nsupporting data include a PV-Ar vel-\nocity> 30cm/s [where PV-Ar\u00bc end-diastole\npulmonary venous flow] and S/D ratio<1); or\nGrade III (severe), if restrictive left ventricular\nfilling occurs accompanied by an E/A ratio! 2,\ndeceleration time< 160 ms, isovolumetric\nrelaxation time 60 ms, systolic filling fraction\n40%, mitral A flow duration shorter than\nPV-Ar duration and E/e' ratio> 13 (or septal\nAn FMD test was used to measure the\ndiameter of the brachial artery above the\nantecubital fossa, which was evaluated\nusing ultrasound imaging with a Philips\nTransducer (Royal Philips) in B-mode\naccording to the recommendations of the\nInternational Brachial Artery Reactivity\nTask Force.19 The same equipment was\nused to measure CIMT.20 Briefly, with the\npatient in a supine position, common car-\notid artery scanning was initiated while\nfocusing on the posterior carotid wall at\nthe beginning of the carotid bifurcation and\nthe common carotid artery. At least four\nmeasurements were obtained at a distance of\napproximately 10 mm proximal to where the\ncarotid dilatation was performed because\nit represents the greatest distance between\nthe lumen-intima interface and the media\nadventitia interface. In all of the cases,\nreproducibility of the measurement was\nvalidated using acceptable intraclass correl-\nation coefficients (agreement) for inter-\nobserver reliability.\nStatistical analyses\nThe study was designed to evaluate correl-\nations between continuous response vari-\nables (pro-atherogenic biomarkers) and\nEAT in patients who were divided into\nbalanced categorical groups, stratified\naccording to cardiovascular risk factors\n(Framingham score ! 20 and presence of\nsignificant ischemic heart disease versus\nFramingham score <20 and no ischemic\nheart disease). To calculate the sample size,\npreviously reported correlations between\nbiomarkers of interest and EAT thickness\nwere taken into account, then, observed\nsignificant differences in biomarker values\nfor similar populations (grouped according\nto the presence of coronary artery disease)\nwere considered. To reject the null hypoth-\nesis that the correlation between EAT and\neach pro-atherogenic biomarker is less\nsignificant than previously reported findings\nor that there is no correlation with a prob-\nability (power) of 0.80 and a type I (a) error\nprobability of 0.05, the study was deter-\nmined to require 40 patients, divided into\nbalanced groups according to the presence\nor absence of significant ischemic heart\ndisease.\nTo weight the effects of pro-atherogenic\nfactors on EAT thickness, cut-off values were\ncalculated for the following pro-atherogenic\nbiomarkers using a receiver operating char-\nacteristic curve, which best discriminated\nCIMT! 1: EAT; NO; sICAM-1 and MDA.\nA cut-off value for FMD was set at 4.5% in\naccordance with previous reports.21,22 EAT\nthickness values were then analysed in\npatients stratified according to biomarker\ncut-offs. EAT thickness values were similarly\nanalysed for patients stratified according to\nclinical/demographic variables (age, smok-\ning, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus,\nFramingham score).\nFor descriptive statistics, continuous\nvariables are presented as median (inter-\nquartile range), and categorical variables are\npresented as n (%) prevalence. Data distri-\nbutions for the variables were estimated\nusing Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test. Between-\ngroup comparisons of continuous variables\nwere performed using unpaired Student's\nt-tests or Mann\u00adWhitney U-tests (2-tailed).\nCategorical variables were compared\nbetween groups using 2-test or Fisher's\nexact test (as appropriate). Pearson's correl-\nation coefficient was applied to determine\nthe relationship between biomarkers and\nEAT values. Any biomarkers found to\nhave a potential association with EAT and\nto be the best predictors of subclinical\natherogenesis (CIMT > 1 mm) were identi-\nfied using modelling in the `enter' method\nduring logistic regression analysis. The rela-\ntive risk and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)\nare shown.

This finding further supports the\nnotion that EAT may be a biomarker of\nendothelial dysfunction and demonstrates\nthat it may have potential clinical utility for\nstratifying patients with cardiovascular risk\nfactors according to atherogenic risk.\nFinally, logistic regression modelling\nshowed that the interaction between an\nEAT ! 6.5 and a CIMT ! 1 becomes statis-\ntically significant when type 2 diabetes\nmellitus and MDA are included in the\nmodel, suggesting that both variables influ-\nence the ability of EAT thickness to reflect\nsubclinical atherogenesis.\nThe results of the present study may be\nlimited by the low number of patients\nincluded. The sample size calculations, and\nprospective balancing of patients with car-\ndiovascular risks, meant that the sample size\nwas high enough to evaluate associations\nbetween pro-atherogenic factors and EAT\nthickness, however, additional relevant\nassociations with other variables might\nhave been missed. Potential selection bias\nmay have arisen from the exclusion of\npatients who underwent surgical heart\nmanipulation and patients with stroke.\nAdditionally, the influence of drugs that\ncan potentially affect adipose tissue metab-\nolism was not weighted in the study.\nTranslational studies investigating bio-\nmarkers of endothelial dysfunction and\ntheir associations with EAT are rare, and\nthe present findings should, therefore, be\nreplicated in larger studies. The prognostic\nsignificance of the present findings should be\nassessed in longitudinal studies.\nIn conclusion, NO, a biomarker of endo-\nthelial dysfunction, and conventional car-\ndiovascular risk factors, were associated\nwith EAT thickness. The specific association\nbetween EAT thickness and NO in the\npopulation that was stratified by\nFramingham score, as well as the difference\nin EAT thickness between the populations\nstratified by NO, but not by CIMT, suggests\nthat EAT can be used to identify patients\nwith conventional cardiovascular risk fac-\ntors at different stages of vascular damage.\nFinally, EAT-associated subclinical athero-\ngenesis, which was defined as CIMT ! 1,\nwas further influenced by MDA and type 2\ndiabetes mellitus.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received financial support from the\nE-015 institutional program the CONACYT\nFOSSIS program.\nReferences\n1.
