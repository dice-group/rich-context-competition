Food folate is the form that occurs\nnaturally in food sources. Folic acid is the form of the vitamin\nfound in fortified foods and dietary supplements. The term di-\netary folate is used to represent food folate and folic acid in\nfortified foods together. Total folate encompasses all dietary and\nsupplemental exposure to folate and folic acid.\nFolic acid supplementation in the periconceptional period\nunequivocally decreases the occurrence of neural tube defects (1,\n2). For this reason, the governments of both the United States and\nCanada instituted national fortification programs with folic acid\nto enhance the diets of reproductive-aged women (3\u00ad5), and\nneural tube defect rates decreased in both the United States (6)\nand Canada (7\u00ad9). However, the fortification program increased\nfolic acid intake among virtually all segments of the population.\nWhereas observational data suggest that increased food folate is\nbeneficial for prevention of some cancers and cardiovascular\ndisease, high folic acid intake may actually increase the risk of\ncertain individuals. Therefore, careful monitoring of total folate\nintake from food and dietary supplements is recommended (13, 14).\nData from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) can be used to monitor dietary intake and\ndietary supplement use of folate in the United States. The\nNHANES data indicate increases in dietary folate intakes from the\nprefortification (NHANES III) to the postfortification (NHANES\nnot include estimates of folic acid from dietary supplements (15).\nWith more than one-half of the US population reporting the use of\ndietary supplements (16), monitoring folate status without in-\nclusion of this potentially important contributor of nutrients is\nSome methodologic challenges have precluded the calculation\nof total nutrient intakes from the NHANES data. First, the data\nwere collected over 2 different periods of time: food intake was\nmeasured by two 24-h dietary recalls (ie, single-day estimates),\nand dietary supplement data were collected through a 30-d fre-\nquency questionnaire. Furthermore, both 24-h recalls and fre-\nquency methods of dietary assessment are subject to different\ntypes of measurement error (19, 20). Thus, nutrient estimates\nfrom the 2 instruments may not be directly comparable, and\n1 From the Office of Dietary Supplements (RLB, JTD, EAY, CAS, and\nMFP) and the National Cancer Institute (KWD), National Institutes of\nHealth, Bethesda, MD; and the National Center for Health Statistics Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, MD (JJG, MAM, VLB, and\n2 The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and\ndo not necessarily represent the views of the Office of Dietary Supplements,\nthe National Cancer Institute, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention/ Agency for Toxic Substances and Dis-\nease Registry, or any other entity of the US Government.\n3 Address correspondence to RL Bailey, 6100 Executive Boulevard,\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nsimply adding them together may not be a satisfactory approach.\nPrevious methods have described how to adjust dietary estimates\nfrom 24-h recalls to decrease within-person variation (21\u00ad25), but\nlittle is known about the derivation of total nutrient intakes with\nthe use of adjusted dietary data. Carriquiry (26) has published\nstrategies to combine diet and supplemental sources of nutrients;\nin this article, we use this methodologic framework to combine\ndietary folate intake estimates from the 24-h dietary recall data\nand the 30-d frequency questionnaire of dietary supplement use\nNHANES data.\nThe NHANES is a nationally representative, cross-sectional\nsurvey that samples noninstitutionalized, civilian US residents\nwith the use of a complex, stratified, multistage, probability\ncluster sampling design. All data were collected by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention. Briefly, participants were asked to complete 3\ncomponents: an in-person household interview, a health exam-\nination in a mobile examination center (MEC) '3 wk later, and\na phone interview to collect additional dietary data. At the\nhousehold interview, demographic information, dietary supple-\nment use, and some health-related data were collected. The\nMEC visit consisted of clinical tests, laboratory studies, a di-\netary recall, and a health interview. Written informed consent\nwas obtained from all participants or proxies, and the survey\nprotocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Board of\nthe National Center for Health Statistics.\nThe NHANES data are publicly available and are released in\n2-y data sets to ensure confidentiality of the participants and to\nallow for adequate sample size for statistical analysis. However,\nthe combination of 4 y of data may be necessary to produce\nreliable estimates with the statistical methods required with the\ncomplex sample design for more detailed analyses of population\nNHANES data sets were combined.\nThe unweighted examination response rate for all participants,\nwhich was calculated as the number of participants divided by the\ntotal number selected for the sample, was 79% for the interview\ncomponent and 76% for the examination component in NHANES\nparticipants over the age of 14 y were included in this analysis\n(n = 13,468); pregnant and lactating women were excluded (n =\n12,119 completed both the interview and examination compo-\nnents. From this sample, participants with incomplete dietary\nrecall data were excluded (n = 657); thus, this report includes\nDietary data\nAll survey participants were eligible for the dietary interview\nand dietary supplement use interview questions. During the MEC\nexamination, a 24-h dietary recall was administered by trained\ninterviewers. A second dietary recall was collected via telephone\n'3\u00ad10 d after the MEC examination. Both 24-h recalls were\ncollected with the use of the US Department of Agriculture's\nAutomated Multiple-Pass Method (27, 28).\nFolate bioequivalence\nThe bioavailability of food folate is much lower than that of\nfolic acid added to fortified foods and dietary supplements. The\ndietary folate equivalent (DFE) conversion was developed to\nreflect this differential bioavailability (29). Equation 1 shows the\nconversion to the DFE metric:\n1 DFE \u00bc 1 lg food folate \u00bc 0:6 lg folic acid from\nsupplements and fortified foods \u00f01\u00de\nDietary supplement use\nDietary supplement use information was collected during the\nhousehold interview as part of the Dietary Supplement Ques-\ntionnaire. The questionnaire was used to determine a sample\nperson's use of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary\nsupplements over the past 30 d. Detailed information about type,\nconsumption frequency, duration, and amount taken was col-\nlected for each reported dietary supplement. The average daily\nintake of folic acid was calculated for individuals with the use\nof the number of days that the supplement was reported to have\nbeen taken, the reported amount taken per day, and the serving size\nunit from the product label. Missing information was assigned\na default value of the most commonly reported serving size, dose,\nor frequency of intake.\nTotal folate intakes\nThe dietary folate intakes reported on the 24-h dietary recalls\nwere adjusted for within-person variability with the use of the\nbias-corrected best power method to obtain a set of intermediary\nvalues that reflected the distribution of usual nutrient intake from\nfood sources (22, 25). Each of the intermediary values was based\non data from a particular individual, for whom additional data\nthat concerned supplement use were available. Each individual's\nreported average daily dose of folic acid from dietary supple-\nments was added to his or her intermediary value to produce\na final set of adjusted values that reflected the distribution of usual\nintake of folate in DFE and folic acid separately in micrograms\n(25, 26). Thus, dietary and total nutrient intakes were estimated\nin 2 ways: 1) dietary and total folate in DFE and 2) dietary and\ntotal folic acid in micrograms, because the Dietary Reference\nIntakes are constructed in this manner. The estimated average\nrequirement (EAR) is for folate in DFE, but the Tolerable Upper\nIntake Level (UL) is for folic acid in micrograms. Folic acid in\nfortified foods, when converted to DFEs, can be used to meet the\nEAR recommendations. However, the analysis that compared\nmean intakes of the groups with the UL is for synthetic folic\nacid only, ie, food folate does not contribute toward the UL.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS\nsoftware (version 9; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Sample\nweights were used to account for differential nonresponse and\nnoncoverage, and to adjust for planned oversampling of some\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\ngroups. Mean and percentiles of dietary and total folate (DFE)\nand dietary and total folic acid (micrograms) were estimated.\nMean dietary and total folate intake were compared with EAR,\nand mean dietary and total folic acid were compared with the UL\n(29, 30), to determine the proportion of the population that meets\nor exceeds these recommendations, respectively.\nLinear contrasts were constructed to determine differences\nbetween mean folate intake for age and racial-ethnic groups by\nsex. The referent group for the age comparisons was 19\u00ad30 y for\nboth men and women. For racial-ethnic groups, the referent group\nwas non-Hispanic white for both men and women. The SEs for all\nstatistics of interest (means, medians, proportions with usual\nintake below or above EAR-UL, and linear contrasts) was ap-\nproximated by Fay's modified balanced repeated replication\ntechnique (31, 32) with the use of 32 sets of replicate weights\nconstructed with an initial perturbation factor of 0.7. Each set of\nreplicate weights was poststratified to control totals computed\nfrom the initial sample weights. For the linear contrasts, a t\nstatistic was computed by the division of the estimate of each\ncontrast by its estimated SE.\nRESULTS\nThe use of dietary supplements was reported by 53.4% of\nsupplements that contained folic acid. Non-Hispanic whites\n(39%) reported a higher prevalence of use of folic acid dietary\nsupplements than did non-Hispanic blacks (19%) and Mexican\nAmericans (18%). Use and mean contribution from dietary\nsupplements that contained folic acid was highest for 51\u00ad70-y-\nolds, with 47% of men and 53% of women in this age group\nreporting use. In this age group, the mean (6SE) contribution of\nabove the UL from dietary supplements alone when the sexes\nwere examined together.\nIn general, dietary folate intakes were relatively stable for\nwomen across age groups (Table 1). In contrast, total folate\nintakes (diet plus supplements) were higher in those aged .51 y.\nAmong men, no differences were noted in age groups for dietary\nfolate intakes. Men .51 y had significantly higher total folate\nintakes compared with the referent group. Among both sexes,\nnon-Hispanic whites had higher total folate intakes than did non-\nHispanic blacks and Mexican Americans. Across all age and\nracial-ethnic groups, men had higher mean dietary and total\nfolate intakes than did women (between-sex differences not\nstatistically compared). However, women had a higher per-\ncentage than men of total intake contributed by dietary supple-\nments (37% compared with 28%, respectively; data not shown).\nMean dietary and total folate intakes were compared with the\nDietary Reference Intake recommendations. The use of dietary\nsupplements as reflected in total folate intakes lowered the\nprevalence of individuals who did not meet the EAR. More\nwomen than men had inadequate intakes (ie, they did not meet the\nEAR) for both dietary and total folate. Even with the use of\nwomen did not meet the EAR. A significantly higher prevalence\nof inadequate intakes of total folate was observed for non-\nHispanic black women (23%) than for non-Hispanic white\nwomen (13%). Similarly, a significantly higher prevalence of\ninadequate total folate intakes was observed for non-Hispanic\nEnergy, dietary folate, and total folate intakes [in dietary folate equivalents (DFE)] compared with the estimated average requirement (EAR) stratified by sex,\nn Energy intake\nFolate intake\nDiet only Below the EAR2 Total intake Below the EAR2\nkcal DFE % DFE %\nWomen\nMen\n1 Different sample sizes were available for the age groups and racial-ethnic groups by sex because the \"all other\" racial category was included in the age\ngroup analysis.

The prevalence of excessive intakes of folic acid from\nfood alone was ,1% for women and ,2% for men; dietary\nsupplement use increased the prevalence of intakes above the\nUL. Non-Hispanic white women and men had a significantly\nhigher prevalence of excessive total folate intakes than their\ncounterparts in other racial-ethnic groups. Approximately 5% of\ngroup had total folic acid intake above the UL.\nThe shift in the folic acid intake distribution from the use of\ndietary supplements as measured in micrograms with sex and all\nage groups combined is shown in Figure 1. Dietary supplements\nsupply large amounts of folic acid, and the variability increases\nas mean intake increases. The percentile distributions for dietary\nintakes alone and for total folate intakes in DFE are shown in\nTable 3. The difference in the percentiles of dietary folate and\ntotal folate shows the effect of the amount of folic acid that is\nadded from dietary supplements. In general, for dietary and total\nfolate intakes, means were higher than medians for all age and\nsex groups examined. This is suggestive of a significant skew to\nthe intake distributions and indicates that some persons have\na relatively high total folate intake. The magnitude of the dif-\nference between the percentiles of folate from the diet alone and\ntotal folate intake increases as the percentiles increase.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study used a strategy to derive total folate intakes, which\nis based on previous work by Carriquiry (26) with modifications\nsuggested by Dodd et al (25). This method produced distributions\nof total folate intakes by the addition of person-specific dietary\nsupplement intakes to adjusted dietary intake estimates of folate\nTo our knowledge, this is the first effort to describe the population\nDietary folic acid and total folic acid intake (in lg) stratified by sex, age group, and race-ethnicity in the United States, 2003\u00ad20061\nn\nFolic acid intake\nDiet only Above the UL Total intake Above the UL\nlg % lg %\nWomen\nMen\n1 Different sample sizes were available for the age groups and racial-ethnic groups by sex because the \"all other\" racial category was included in the age\ngroup analysis.

Dietary folic acid is from\nfortified foods. Total folic acid is from fortified foods combined with folic\nacid from dietary supplements.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nstatus of total folate intake from foods, fortified foods, and dietary\nsupplements.\nSeveral methodologic concerns must be acknowledged. First,\nall estimates of dietary intake were adjusted for within-individual\nvariation, and these estimates reflect usual intake and assume that\nreported nutrient intake from food sources on any given 24-h\nrecall day are unbiased and that the self-reported supplement\nintake reflects true long-term supplement intake. Second, esti-\nmates of folate in food depend largely on label declarations rather\nthan analytic values. Actual amounts are often higher than label\nvalues (33). Third, the folic acid content of dietary supplements is\nalso based on label values; recent analytic data suggest that label\nvalues also may exceed actual amounts (34, 35).\nThe fortification of the food supply with folic acid was\nintended to enhance the diets of reproductive-age women. In this\nstudy, '22% of reproductive-age women did not meet the EAR\nthrough diet alone. When dietary supplements and foods were\nrecommendations. Non-Hispanic black women also had a high\nprevalence of inadequate intakes, with 29% who did not meet\nthe EAR through diet alone and 23% who did not meet the EAR\nfor total intakes. However, the NHANES data indicate that,\nwhereas some groups have inadequate intakes, other groups are\nat risk of excessive intakes. It is important to note that when\nexamined separately, 4% of dietary supplement users exceeded\nthe UL simply from the use of the supplements alone. Ap-\nproximately 5% of US women and men aged 50 y had total\nfolic acid intakes above the UL. Given accumulating data that\nsuggest high folic acid intakes in those with preexisting lesions\nmay increase cancer risk, older adults and those who use folic\nacid supplements in addition to a high folic acid diet certainly\nPercentiles of dietary folate and total folate intakes [in dietary folate equivalents (DFE)] stratified by sex, age group, and race-ethnicity in the United States,\nPercentiles of folate intake\nDiet alone\nWomen\nMen\nDiet and dietary supplements\nWomen\nMen\n1 Dietary folate represents the combination of food folate and folic acid in fortified foods.

Our results support the\nearlier conclusions of Lewis et al (36) that a need exists to\nimprove total folate intake in targeted subgroups, which include\nwomen of childbearing age and non-Hispanic black women,\nwhile not putting other population groups at risk of excessive\nintakes. In this article, we present the estimates for folate and\nfolic acid exposure from dietary and supplemental sources.\nGiven the underreporting of energy intake (37) and limitations\nof both the dietary and dietary supplements composition tables,\ncareful examination of the biomarker data of folate status, in\naddition to the dietary data, is a crucial next step to inform\nnutrition policy.\nDietary supplements constitute an important source of\nnutrients for large segments of the population, and more than one-\nhalf of the US population reports usage. Previous research\nindicates that dietary supplement users also tend to have high\ndietary intakes of nutrients (38).
