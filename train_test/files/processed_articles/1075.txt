Bivariate and survival analyses\nwere used to delineate patterns and correlates of nonfatal suicidal behavior.\nMain Outcome Measures Self-reports of lifetime suicide ideation, planning, and\nattempts.\nResults Survey respondents, categorized as African Americans and Caribbean Ameri-\ncans, reported lifetime prevalence of 11.7% for suicide ideation and 4.1% for at-\ntempts. Among the respondents who reported ideation, 34.6% transitioned to mak-\ning a plan and only 21% made an unplanned attempt. Among 4 ethnic-sex groups,\nthe 7.5% lifetime prevalence for attempts among Caribbean black men was the high-\nest among black Americans. The greatest risk of progressing to suicide planning or\nattempt among ideators occurred within the first year after ideation onset. Blacks at\nhigher risk for suicide attempts were in younger birth cohorts, less educated, Midwest\nresidents, and had 1 or more Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\nFourth Edition disorders.\nConclusions This study documents the burden of nonfatal suicidality among US blacks,\nnotably Caribbean black men, and individuals making planned attempts. Advancing\nresearch on the transition from suicide planning to attempt is vital to the efficacy of\nhealth care professionals' ability to screen blacks at risk for suicide.\nlation is an important public health\nobjective. Generating more reliable\nand more extensive scientific data on\nnonfatal suicidal behaviors is a critical\nfirst step in developing and testing\npreventive interventions aimed at\nreducing both suicide morbidity and\nmortality.\nReports from the Institute of Medi-\ncine and US surgeon general have high-\nlighted the need for nationally repre-\nsentative epidemiological data on the\noccurrence of suicidal thoughts and at-\ntempts.5,7,15 There is no single primary\ndata source for nationally representa-\ntive information on nonfatal suicidal be-\nhavior.5 Reliable population estimates of\nsuch behaviors are hampered by the ab-\nsence of centralized data registries and\nconsistent definitions of suicide across\nfatal suicidal behavior in the United\nStates are derived from either ongoing\nsurveillance systems or epidemiologi-\ncal surveys reporting population-based\nprevalence estimates for suicidal\ntems provide valuable information, but\nthey are limited because they provide\nlittle to no race-specific information.5\nThe most recent epidemiologic stud-\nies, the National Comorbidity Survey\nand the National Comorbidity Survey\nReplication,19,20 provide national preva-\nlence estimates of suicide ideation, plan-\nning, and attempts, but not by race or\nethnicity. The most recent data on black\nadult nonfatal suicidal behaviors are\nfrom the National Institute of Mental\nHealth's Epidemiologic Catchment Area\n2.3% lifetime estimate of attempted sui-\ncide among US blacks.21 These studies\nlack information on the onset of sui-\ncideideation,prevalenceofsuicideplan-\nning, and data on the correlates of sui-\ncide-related behaviors among blacks.\nNational estimates of the lifetime preva-\nlence and correlates of suicide ide-\nation, planning, and attempts among\nblacks of African American and Carib-\nbean ethnicity in the United States are\nreported herein for the first time using\nthe recently collected National Survey\nof American Life (NSAL).\nMETHODS\nPopulation and Data Collection\nThe NSAL is part of the National In-\nstitute of Mental Health Collaborative\nPsychiatric Epidemiology Surveys ini-\ntiative that includes 3 nationally rep-\nresentative surveys: the NSAL, the Na-\ntional Comorbidity Survey Replication,\nand the National Latino and Asian\nAmerican Study.22 The NSAL is a na-\ntionally representative household sur-\nblacks of Caribbean descent (Carib-\nbean blacks), and 891 non-Hispanic\nnon-Hispanic whites, however, were\nnot administered the full interview and\nwere not asked the suicidality ques-\ntions. Thus, this report focuses on the\nAfrican American and Caribbean black\nsamples. The African American sample,\nthe largest segment of the NSAL core\nsample, is nationally representative of\nhouseholds located in the 48 contigu-\nous states with at least 1 black adult\naged 18 years or older who did not iden-\ntify ancestral ties in the Caribbean. The\nCaribbean black sample was selected\nfrom 2 area probability sample frames:\n265 were selected from the house-\nwere selected from an area probability\nsample of housing units from geo-\ngraphic areas with a relatively high den-\nsity of persons of Caribbean descent\nThe NSAL analysis weights for the Af-\nrican American and Caribbean black\nsamples were designed to provide popu-\nlation representation for these popula-\ntions in the continental US states.\nInthisstudy,AfricanAmericanisused\nto describe individuals who self-\nidentified as black but did not identify\nancestral ties to the Caribbean. Carib-\nbean blacks are individuals who self-\nidentifiedasblackandindicatedthatthey\nwere from a country included on a list\nofCaribbean-areacountriespresentedby\nthe interviewers, or who specified that\nat least 1 of their parents or grandpar-\nents was born in a Caribbean-area\ncountry. Most (86%) interviews were\nconductedface-to-faceusingacomputer-\nassisted instrument and lasted an aver-\nage of 2 hours 20 minutes. The remain-\ning interviews (14%) were conducted\npartiallyorentirelybytelephone.Respon-\ndents interviewed by telephone tended\nto be slightly more educated. No other\nsignificant differences in the main out-\ncomesandothervariablesofinterestwere\nfound between the 2 interview modes.\nData were collected between February\nfor African Americans, and 79.3% for\nCaribbean blacks. These rates were cal-\nculated using the American Association\nfor Public Opinion Research response\nrate 3 method,25 which includes in the\nnumerator the number of completed\ninterviews, the number of originally\nsampled households in the denomina-\ntor, excludes known ineligible house-\nholds, and is adjusted for the estimated\nproportion of eligible households that\ninterviewerswereunabletocontact.The\nweighting class method was used to\nadjustthedatafornonresponsebias.26 For\nallrace/ethnicsamples,additionalNSAL\nweightsweredesignedtocorrectfordis-\nproportionate sampling and for popula-\ntion representation across various\nsociodemographic characteristics.24\nDescriptive analyses applying these\nweights yield statistics nationally repre-\nsentative of the populations and sub-\npopulations of interest.\nRecruitment and Consent\nAfter introductory letters and study bro-\nchures were mailed to sample house-\nholds, a trained interviewer contacted\neach sample housing unit in person to\nfurther explain the study and asked an\nadult household informant additional\nquestions (eg, age, sex, race, and His-\npanic and Caribbean ancestry status of\neach household member) to identify a\nsubset of household members eligible\nto be selected as the NSAL respon-\ndent. The Kish27 procedure for objec-\ntive respondent selection was used to\nrandomly designate 1 of the eligible\nadults as the NSAL respondent. The in-\nterviewers then obtained oral consent\nand completed the interview, or\nscheduled it for a later time. Oral in-\nstead of written consent was obtained\nconsistent with the National Comor-\nbidity population surveys.19,20 For their\nparticipation, each respondent was\ngiven $50. The institutional review\nboard of the University of Michigan ap-\nproved the recruitment, consent, and\ndata collection procedures.\nSuicidal Behavior\nSuicidality is assessed in its own\nsection of the World Mental Health\nComposite International Diagnostic\nInterview (WMH-CIDI) by a series of\nquestionsaboutlifetimesuicidalbehav-\niors including ideation, planning, and\nattempts.28 Respondents were screened\nintothesuicidalitysectionoftheWMH-\nCIDI if they answered affirmatively to\nthe question \"Have you ever seriously\nthought about committing suicide?\"\nThese respondents are said to have\nengaged in suicidal ideation and will be\nreferred to as ideators in this report,\nwhile those answering negatively will\nbe referred to as non-ideators. Only the\nideators went on to answer questions\nto determine if they ever made plans to\ncommit suicide (\"Have you ever made\na plan for committing suicide?\") and if\nthey ever attempted suicide (\"Have you\never attempted suicide?\"). Respon-\ndents answering affirmatively to any of\nthese 3 questions were asked to pro-\nvide the age when they first experi-\nenced the given outcome. To gain a bet-\nter understanding of the progression\nfromideationtoattempt,wealsoexam-\nined 3 conditional associations corre-\nsponding to different pathways indi-\nviduals may follow from suicidal\nideationtoattemptedsuicide:plangiven\nideation, attempt given ideation but no\nplan, and finally attempt given ide-\nation and a plan.20 The suicide intent\noftherespondentswasassessedbyread-\ning3statementsandaskingtheattempt-\ners to select 1 of the 3 to describe their\nfirstattempt.Theywerereadthe3state-\nments in order: (1) \"I made a serious\nattempt to kill myself and it was only\nluck that I did not succeed,\" (2) \"I tried\ntokillmyself,butknewthatthemethod\nwasnotfoolproof,\"and(3)\"Myattempt\nwas a cry for help. I did not intend to\ndie.\"\nPsychiatric Diagnosis and\nTreatment Experience\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders, Fourth Edition29\n(DSM-IV) World Mental Health Com-\nposite International Diagnostic Inter-\nview (WMH-CIDI), a fully structured\ndiagnostic interview, was used to as-\nsess a wide range of serious mental dis-\norders and conditions, including sui-\ncidality. The psychiatric disorders in the\nNSAL are slightly modified versions of\nthose developed for the World Mental\nused in the National Comorbidity\nSurvey Replication.31 We present and\ndiscuss risks for various suicidal be-\nhaviors associated with the mental dis-\norders assessed in the NSAL: (1) mood\n(major depressive disorder, dys-\nthymia, bipolar I & II disorders); (2)\nanxiety (panic disorder, agoraphobia,\nsocial phobia, generalized anxiety dis-\norder, probable obsessive compulsive\ndisorder, posttraumatic stress disor-\nder); (3) substance (alcohol abuse, al-\ncohol dependence, drug abuse, drug de-\npendence); (4) disorders usually\ndiagnosed in childhood (separation\nanxiety, oppositional defiant disor-\nder, conduct disorder, attention deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder); and (5) eat-\ning (anorexia, bulimia, binge-eating).\nWe also examined suicidal respon-\ndents' treatment experiences for men-\ntal disorders assessed in the NSAL. All\nrespondents were asked if they had con-\ntact with anyone from an extensive list\nof treatment providers for problems\nwith their emotions, nerves, mental\nhealth, or use of alcohol or drugs in\ntheir lifetime. Health care treatment\nproviders were categorized into a men-\ntal health sector (psychiatrists, psy-\nchologists, counselors and social work-\ners seen in mental health settings, other\nmental health professionals, mental\nhealth hotlines) and a general medical\nsector (general practitioners, family\nphysicians, nurses, occupational thera-\npists, and other health professionals).\nA non\u00adhealth care sector included\nthe use of human services (religious\nand spiritual advisors, counselors and\nsocial workers seen in non\u00admental\nhealth settings) and complementary-\nalternative treatments (herbalists, chi-\nropractors, spiritualists, self-help\ngroups, Internet support groups). Life-\ntime service use was defined as mak-\ning at least 1 visit to a service provider\nprior to the respondent's interview.\nSociodemographic Correlates\nWe investigated sociodemographic fac-\ntors to ascertain groups potentially at el-\nevated risk of suicidal behaviors. Socio-\ndemographic correlates included\nethnicity (African American and Carib-\nbean black), sex, highest level of educa-\ntion (less than high school, high school\ngraduate, some college, college gradu-\nate), marital status (married, previ-\nouslymarried,nevermarried),birthyear\nand region (Northeast, Midwest, South,\nand West Census regions).32\nStatistical Analysis\nAllanalyseswereweightedtobenation-\nallyrepresentativeofthepopulationsand\nsubgroups of interest and were con-\nductedusingSAS9.1.3(SASInstituteInc,\nCary, NC).33 Bivariate cross-tabulations\nwereusedtocalculatethenationallyrep-\nresentative prevalences of the suicidal\nbehaviorsbysociodemographiccharac-\nteristics and use of services.

The ages at\nonset, as well as a time-varying marital\nstatusriskfactor,weredeterminedfrom\nthe respondents' retrospective reports.\nProcedures were used in all of the\nanalyses to properly adjust SEs, confi-\ndence intervals (CIs), and significance\ntests for the complex sample design of\nthe NSAL. The 2 and corresponding P\nvalues (set at a .05 level of signifi-\ncance) from these cross-tabulations are\nbased on the Rao-Scott 2 test, a com-\nplexdesign-adjustedversionofthePear-\nson 2 test.33 A modified version of bal-\nanced repeated replications35 was\nimplemented in an SAS macro to esti-\nmate the SEs and CIs of the Cox propor-\ntional hazards regression coefficients.\nTheseriskcoefficientsandtheir95%CIs\nwere exponentiated and are reported as\nodds ratios (ORs) for ease of interpreta-\ntion.

Among the ideators, 34.6% made\na suicide plan. Statistically significant\ndifferences (P.05) were found be-\ntween men and women, with attempts\nbeing more prevalent for women, 4.9%,\nthan for men, 3.1%. An ethnicity-by-\nsex analysis revealed the prevalence of\nsuicide attempts was highest for Carib-\nbean black men (7.5%), followed by Af-\nrican American women (5.0%). Carib-\nbean black women had the lowest\nprevalence of attempts (2.7%), while at-\ntempts were only slightly more preva-\nlent for African American men (2.74%).\nOf attempters, 63.6% reported at-\n6.5% reported 4 or more suicide at-\ntempts. Attempters were asked to de-\nscribe the nature of their intent. Among\nthe attempters, 41.7% endorsed the item\n\"I made a serious attempt to kill myself\nand it was only luck that I did not suc-\nceed.\" Another 13.7% of attempters en-\ndorsed \"I tried to kill myself, but knew\nthat the method was not fool proof\"\nwhile 44.6% endorsed \"My attempt was\na cry for help. I did not intend to die.\"\nReported Age at Onset\nDistributions\nFIGURE 1 shows the smoothed hazard\ncurves for the reported initial onset of\nsuicide ideation, planning, and at-\ntempt for the entire sample. These\ncurves indicate that the highest risk of\ninitial onset of these behaviors occurs\nduring the late teens and early 20s. No-\ntably, the risk of making a suicide at-\ntempt is greater than the risk of mak-\ning a suicide plan during this age period\nsuggesting that nonplanned, impul-\nsive attempts are more common than\nplanned attempts until respondents\nreach their early 20s. FIGURE 2 shows\nhow soon after initial ideation onset re-\nspondents progressed to more serious\nsuicidal behaviors. The figure shows\nthat the greatest risk of progressing to\nplan formation and to attempt among\nideators occurred within the first year\nafter ideation onset. Risk of attempt was\nsubstantially greater in the presence of\na plan. While attempts were almost ex-\nclusively confined to the first year af-\nter ideation onset in the absence of a\nplan, individuals with a plan contin-\nued to make initial suicide attempts for\nup to 35 years after first onset of ide-\nation.

These curves give a more\ncomplete understanding of the preva-\nlence rates; specifically, 3 important\nfindings are evident in Figure 3. First,\nCaribbean black males had the high-\nyears, and the age at which they were\nmost at risk of attempting, approxi-\nmately 21 years, was almost 5 years\nolder than the ages of highest risk for\nthe 2 female groups. Second, African\nAmerican men had a relatively con-\nstant low hazard of attempt, but were\nactually the group most at risk of at-\ntempting after age 34 years. Third, all\ngroups had peaks of varying magni-\ntude in their risks of attempting sui-\ncide during adolescence and early adult-\nhood; however, the risk of attempt\npersisted into older adulthood only for\nthe 2 African American groups.\nSociodemographic Risk Factors\nRisk of a suicide attempt and risk of sui-\ncidal ideation were significantly associ-\nated with being born in a recent co-\nhort, having a low education level, and\nresiding in the Midwest region of the\nUnited States (TABLE 3). In addition,\nbeing previously married (eg, divorced\nor widowed) was significantly associ-\nated with increased odds of suicidal ide-\nation compared with being married. Al-\nthough Caribbean black men and\nAfrican American women had a higher\nprevalenceofsuicideattempts,the4-cat-\negory ethnicity-by-sex variable was not\nsignificantly associated overall with at-\ntempted suicide at the P.05 level\nyear cohort suggested the presence of a\nlinear trend for all 5 of the outcomes. In\nparticular, individuals born in recent co-\nhorts were significantly more likely to\ndevelop a suicide plan (2\nand to attempt suicide (2\nFigure 1. Age of Onset of Lifetime Suicide Ideation, Plan, and Attempt Among Blacks\nReported Age of Onset\nHazard\nIdeation\nPlan\nAttempt\nThe smoothed hazard functions describe the ways in which the onset risks of the 3 suicidal behaviors change\nwith time. For all behaviors, the highest risk occurs from the teenage years to the mid-twenties. From the mid-\ntwenties, the risks generally decline gradually with the exception of a slight increase from the mid-forties to\nmid-fifties. Notice that the risk of attempting suicide is slightly higher than the risk of making a suicide plan\nuntil approximately age 19 years, when the 2 hazard curves cross. This suggests that nonplanned, impulsive\nattempts are more likely than planned attempts up to this point in young adulthood.\nFigure 2.

The y-axis represents the event-\nfree survival probability. For example, among ideators with a suicide plan, the probability of not attempting\nsuicide decreases to less than 50% in the first 2 years after ideation onset. The probability of remaining attempt-\nfree continues to decrease gradually until 35 years after ideation onset. At this point, only approximately 25%\nof individuals who made a suicide plan have not made an attempt, while 75% have attempted. Contrast this\nwith the ideators who did not make suicide plans. After a sharp decrease in the first year after ideation onset,\nthe respondents' probability of remaining attempt-free stabilizes at about 80%.\nP.001).

This re-\nsult supplements the finding from\nFigure 1 that suggested that non-\nplanned, impulsive attempts are more\ncommon than planned attempts for re-\nspondents until their early 20s.

For instance, previous re-\nsearch has established that there is an\ninverse relationship between educa-\ntion and attempted suicide.20 Accord-\ning to our analyses, blacks with less than\na high school education were more\nlikely to have attempted suicide. Blacks\nin the Midwest were at a significantly\nhigher risk for attempted suicide than\nthose residing in the South, consistent\nwith research suggesting that South-\nern residence is a protective factor for\nthis population.45 Analyses revealed that\nmarital status, though often found to\nbe an important correlate,46 was not a\nsignificant predictor of suicide plan-\nning or attempts in these populations.\nConsistent with research on other\npopulations, psychiatric disorders, in-\ncluding substance abuse diagnosis47 and\nsignificant predictors of attempted sui-\ncide among black ideators. Our analy-\nses showed that ideators with any psy-\nchiatricdisorderwere8timesmorelikely\nto attempt suicide. Individuals with any\nform of anxiety disorder had the high-\nestriskofattemptedsuicide,followedby\nthose with a childhood disorder, those\nwith a mood disorder, and those with an\neating disorder. The dose-response re-\nlationship between the number of psy-\nchiatric disorders and attempted sui-\ncide is consistent with other cross-\nsectional studies and community\nepidemiological surveys.20 The finding\nthatanxietydisorderisthestrongestpre-\ndictor compared with other mental or\nsubstance abuse predictors is inconsis-\ntentwithotherstudies,whichfoundthat\ndepression is often the strongest psychi-\natric risk factor for suicide.14\nSuicide often occurs in the context of\na wide range of complex and interre-\nlatedunderlyingetiologicalfactors.The\nNSAL finding that psychiatric comor-\nbidity is a significant predictor of sui-\ncide attempts over and above the effects\nofindividualdisordersisconsistentwith\nprevious research on adult suicidal\nbehavior.20 The greater the number of\npsychiatric disorders an individual has,\nthe higher the risk of attempted sui-\ncide.49 According to NSAL data, ide-\nators with 3 or more psychiatric disor-\nders are 17 times more likely to attempt\nsuicideandtwiceaslikelytoattemptafter\nmaking a plan. In all instances, how-\never, the ORs for individuals with only\n1 disorder and for those with 2 disor-\nders are similar. This suggests the pres-\nence of a threshold, rather than linear,\neffect for number of psychiatric disor-\nders. That is, the suicide risks increase\nTable 5.

Standard errors are adjusted for the sampling stratification, clustering, and weighting of the data.\nWithin each service sector, 2 statistics were statistically significant at the P.0001 level, suggesting a strong asso-\nciation between use within each sector and the 3 groups. Any mental health treatment includes treatment by a psy-\nchiatrist, as well as by a nonphysician mental health specialist (eg, psychologist, social worker in a mental health\nspecialty setting). General medical treatment includes treatment by any nonpsychiatrist physician or a worker in a\ngeneral medical setting (eg, nurse in a primary care setting). In addition to including mental health and general medi-\ncal treatment, the category of any treatment includes treatment in non\u00adhealth care settings including human ser-\nvices professionals (eg, religious or spiritual advisors) and complementary-alternative treatments (eg, massage therapy,\nchiropractic treatment, or participation in a self-help group).\nwhen 1 disorder is present, stay rela-\ntively constant in the presence of 2 dis-\norders, and increase drastically again in\nthe presence of 3 or more disorders.\nLimitations\nThe NSAL findings must be considered\nin the context of several important limi-\ntations.Theresultsreportedherearelim-\nited by the fact that we do not know the\nextent to which cultural factors affected\nthe willingness of our respondents to\neither admit or recall the presence of\nsymptoms or suicide over their lifetime.\nTheresultsmayalsobeaffectedbyrecall\nbiasassociatedwiththerespondents'age\nand mental health status. Also for all\nanalyses, the results are limited by the\nabsenceofrespondentscurrentlyininsti-\ntutionalsettings(notunusualforahouse-\nhold-based survey). The NSAL is cross-\nsectional,obtainingretrospectivereports;\nthus the prevalence rates are likely to be\nlower-bound estimates.20 Research sug-\ngests that some DSM-IV diagnoses may\nbe overestimated using lay-adminis-\ntered interviewing, particularly nonaf-\nfective psychoses,50,51 but studies have\nfoundthatestimatesofprevalenceusing\nthe WMH-CIDI are generally conserva-\ntive.52 Finally, our sample of Caribbean\nblacksincludesimmigrantswhohavehad\nvarying lengths of stay in the United\nStates, as well as persons of Caribbean\nancestry who were born in the United\nStates with no strong knowledge of or\nidentification with Caribbean culture.\nDespite these constraints, the effect of\nmost of the noted limitations is to make\nour estimates more conservative than\nmight otherwise be the case.

These lines of inves-\ntigation are both important, but the lat-\ntercannotprovidethesamelevelofsub-\npopulation specificity regarding the\nsuicide risk factors. The higher rates of\nattemptedsuicide,notablyamongCarib-\nbean black men, and the role of nativity\nvs ethnicity needs to be addressed in\nfuture research and considered by clini-\ncians when screening, intervening, and\ntreating black patients.
