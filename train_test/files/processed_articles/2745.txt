The American Academy of Pediatrics recently pub-\nlished a statement discouraging youth consumption of\nenergy and sports drinks, for example,36 because many\nyouth perceive them to be a healthy alternative to soda37\ndespite the high levels of added sugar.\nResearch has suggested that when policies restrict only\ncertain foods or beverages, schools and students will com-\npensate by obtaining different low-nutrient foods and bev-\nerages. A study in Washington State found that, in the\nsecond year of the wellness policy requirement (2007-\npus, but 72% were selling other SSBs.38 After California\nestablished nutrition standards for competitive foods,\navailability of soda in schools decreased substantially, but\navailability of sports drinks increased slightly.39 In Texas,\na statewide Public School Nutrition Policy appeared to\ncause students to obtain different high-calorie foods from\ndifferent sources (eg, home).40 Although each study re-\nported reduced SSB exposure or improvements in di-\netary consumption, researchers concluded that policies\nmust provide healthy alternatives in all settings in order\nAs described earlier, not all state policies targeting\nschool beverages have been comprehensive because many\nallowed SSBs other than soda. To our knowledge, no study\nhas examined whether states that restrict only soda are\nas effective in reducing SSB availability and consump-\ntion compared with states with more comprehensive poli-\ncies. The objective of this study was to estimate the as-\nsociation between different types of state beverage policies\nand in-school SSB access and purchasing and overall SSB\nconsumption (in and out of school).\nMETHODS\nMEASURES\nPolicy Data\nState policies governing the sale of soda and other SSBs in middle\nGap research program.41 For purposes of this study, state \"policy\"\nwas defined to include codified state statutory and administra-\ntive (ie, regulatory) laws effective as of September 2006. Poli-\ncies were obtained through keyword searches and reviews of\nthe tables of contents and indices of state laws available by sub-\nscription to the Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis legal research data-\nbases. Policies were double-coded by 2 trained coders and veri-\nfied against secondary source state law data to ensure complete\nStates were classified as having (1) a policy limiting the avail-\nability of soda and other SSBs (eg, \"Only milk, water, and 100%\njuice will be available in school\"), (2) a policy prohibiting soda\nbut no policy limiting the availability of other SSBs (eg, \"Al-\nlowed beverages include milk, water, energy drinks, and elec-\ntrolyte replacement beverages\"), or (3) no policy limiting any\ntype of SSB.\nStudent Data\nStudent data were obtained from the Early Childhood Longi-\ntudinal Study\u00adKindergarten Class. This cohort began as a na-\ntionally representative sample of kindergarten students in fall\n1998 and was followed up over time, through 7 rounds of data\ncollection. The analyses in this study were based on data from\nround 6 (fifth grade, spring 2004) and round 7 (eighth grade,\nspring 2007). The policy data were merged to the individual-\nlevel Early Childhood Longitudinal Study\u00adKindergarten Class\ndata on the basis of state-level geocode identifiers obtained un-\nder special agreement. This study was approved by the insti-\ntutional review board of the University of Illinois at Chicago.\nThe dependent variables of interest were in-school SSB ac-\ncess, in-school SSB purchasing, and overall SSB consumption\n(which included in- and out-of-school consumption). Each vari-\nable was measured using a questionnaire administered at school.\nAccess was measured by asking students, \"In your school, can\nkids buy soda pop, sports drinks, or fruit drinks that are not\n100% fruit juice in the school?\" Purchasing was measured by\nasking, \"During the last week that you were in school, how many\ntimes did you buy soda pop, sports drinks, or fruit drinks at\nschool?\" Overall consumption was measured by asking, \"Dur-\ning the past 7 days, how many times did you drink soda pop,\nsports drinks, or fruit drinks that are not 100% fruit juice?\" Stu-\ndents were instructed to consider all settings (school, home,\netc) when reporting consumption. For purchasing and con-\nsumption, there were 7 response categories ranging from \"I did\nnot purchase/drink any\" to \"4 or more times per day.\" Catego-\nries were collapsed to create dichotomous measures of weekly\npurchasing/consumption (ie, 1 in the past 7 days) and daily\npurchasing/consumption (ie, 1 per day).\nAmong the 9170 public school students who were measured\nin fifth grade, 2270 were excluded from the analyses because\nthey enrolled in a private school (n=130), moved to another\nAmong those excluded, the prevalence of in-school SSB pur-\nchasing and weekly SSB consumption in fifth grade was simi-\nlar compared with the study sample. Those excluded were less\nlikely to report in-school SSB access (P.001) and more likely\nto report daily SSB consumption (P=.04) in fifth grade. Those\nexcluded were also less likely to be non-Hispanic white\nor be below the poverty line (P.001).\nGeneral linear models, with an identity link, were used to\nestimate differences between state policy categories in the prob-\nability of eighth-grade students reporting the following: (1) in-\nschool SSB access, (2) weekly in-school SSB purchase, (3) daily\nin-school SSB purchase, (4) weekly overall SSB consumption\n(in and out of school), and (5) daily overall SSB consumption.\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.

In-\ndicator variables were used to adjust for student race/ethnicity\n(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or non-\nHispanic other), poverty status (whether annual household in-\ncome was above the federal poverty level), and school locale\n(urban, suburban, township, or rural). Models also adjusted\nfor state obesity prevalence (continuous), using data from the\n2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System,46 and used a\nrobust variance estimate to adjust for within-state correla-\ntion.47 All analyses were conducted with Stata, version 11 (Stata-\nCorp, College Station, Texas).48\nIn addition to modeling eighth-grade outcomes in the overall\nsample,weinvestigatedwhetherstatepolicieswereassociatedwith\nwithin-student changes in SSB access, purchasing, and consump-\ntionfromfifthtoeighthgradebyrepeatingthemodelsin2panels--\nstudents who did not report the outcome in question (eg, ac-\ncess) in fifth grade and those who did. Comparing results across\npanels enabled us to explore whether state policies may be more\neffective at primary prevention (eg, preventing adolescents from\nstarting to consume SSBs over time) or secondary prevention (eg,\nencouraging them to cease consumption), although the tempo-\nral sequence of measures precludes us from concluding that poli-\ncies were the cause of any changes.\nThe policies that we examined were designed to reduce\nSSB access at schools, on the rationale that reducing within-\nschool access will reduce overall consumption. To test this\nrationale, a supplementary analysis was conducted in which\nwe estimated the association between within-student\nchanges in SSB access at school and overall SSB consump-\ntion, using a fixed-effect model to adjust for unmeasured,\ntime-invariant characteristics.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive statistics of the study sample are presented\nby state policy category in Table 1. States that banned\nall SSBs and states that had no beverage policies gener-\nally had similar sociodemographic characteristics, but\nstates that banned only soda had different distributions\nof race/ethnicity, locale, and poverty status. In particu-\nlar, states that banned soda had higher proportions of His-\npanic students (33.0%), students below the poverty line\nproportions of white, non-Hispanic students (44.8%) and\nstudents in township or rural areas (4.2% and 10.1%,\nrespectively).\nThe Figure displays in-school SSB access, in-school\nSSB purchasing, and overall SSB consumption (in and out\nof school) in fifth and eighth grades, by state policy cat-\negory. There were obvious differences between policy cat-\negories in patterns of SSB access and weekly purchase over\ntime. States with no school beverage policy in 2006-\n2007 had, 3 years earlier, relatively low proportions of\nfifth-grade students who reported in-school SSB access\nand weekly purchase (34.7% and 9.7%, respectively). By\n2007, however, the prevalence of SSB access and weekly\nrespectively. States that governed all SSBs in 2006-\n2007, in contrast, began with higher proportions of stu-\ndents who reported access and weekly purchase in fifth\nonly a marginal increase over time (4.5% and 1.4%,\nrespectively). Overall SSB consumption (in and out of\nschool) was similar across grades and policy categories.\nMost students (83%-87%) reported weekly consump-\ntion, and 26% to 33% reported daily consumption, re-\ngardless of grade or state policy.\nTable 2 presents the differences between policy cat-\negories in the adjusted prevalence of in-school SSB ac-\ncess and purchasing. Results are presented for each of\nthe 3 panels--all students combined, those who re-\nported the outcome in question in fifth grade, and those\nwho did not. Across all models, SSB access and weekly\npurchase were equally prevalent in states that regulated\nonly soda vs states with no beverage regulations. In states\nthat regulated all SSBs, fewer students reported SSB ac-\nto -3.5). The results were similar in all panels, although\nthe effect size was stronger in students who reported ac-\ncess or purchase in fifth grade. There was no difference\nacross policy categories in the proportion of students who\nreported daily SSB purchase (this outcome was not mod-\neled in the right column because only 2.8% of students\nreported daily purchase in fifth grade).\nIn contrast to the results in Table 2, there were gen-\nerally no differences between policy categories in over-\nall (in and out of school) SSB consumption (Table 3).\nDaily SSB consumption was actually more prevalent in\nstates that regulated SSBs in school (prevalence differ-\ndents who did not report daily consumption in fifth grade\nTable 1.

Results from\nthe fixed-effect model (not shown) revealed that this as-\nsociation was, at best, statistically significant but small\nin magnitude. Changes in students' SSB access at school\nwere associated with 1.9% fewer students reporting weekly\nthe association with daily consumption was in the op-\nlence of infrequent SSB consumption decreased slightly,\nwhereas the prevalence of frequent SSB consumption in-\ncreased slightly, when students' access to SSB at schools\nwas eliminated.\nTo summarize, state policies regulating beverages sold\nin middle schools were associated with reduced in-\nschool SSB access and purchasing only if they banned all\nSSBs. Access and purchasing were equivalent in states that\nbanned only soda compared with those with no policy\nat all. However, even comprehensive SSB policies were\nnot associated with overall consumption of SSBs, which\nwas largely independent of students' in-school SSB\naccess.\nCOMMENT\nStates and school districts nationwide have taken aggres-\nsive action to change the school food environment by pro-\nviding foods and beverages of higher nutritional\nture that suggests that to be effective, school-based policy\ninterventions must be comprehensive. States that only\nban soda, while allowing other beverages with added ca-\nloric sweeteners, appear to be no more successful at re-\nducing adolescents' SSB access and purchasing within\nschool than states that take no action at all.

All rights reserved.\nin this study progressed from fifth to eighth grade, their\nlevels of SSB access and purchasing increased in states\nthat ban soda as much as in states that have no SSB policy.\nStates with more comprehensive laws banning all SSBs\nexperienced only a slight increase in access and purchas-\ning across grades.\nThe inability of soda-only bans to limit SSB access and\npurchasing raises questions about how schools comply\nported that California legislation designed to improve the\nnutritional content of competitive foods and beverages\nhad a positive effect on school food environments over-\nall, but \"many compliant foods were merely modified ver-\nsions of highly processed foods that were previously non-\ncompliant (eg, baked chips).\" If schools adapt to state\npolicies that ban soda by increasing the availability of\nsports drinks, fruit drinks, and other SSBs, the public\nhealth impact of these policies may be minimal. Even\n100% fruit juice has caloric content similar to that of SSBs,\nand policies are unlikely to prevent excess weight gain\nif students replace SSBs with equal amounts of 100% fruit\njuice. If beverage policies are to improve student health,\nschools could do this by promoting unflavored water and\nlimited servings of 100% fruit juice and low-fat milk, as\nrecommended by the Institute of Medicine.33\nThe state policies that we examined were designed to\nchange the school food environment to limit students'\naccess to SSBs while at school. Obviously, the rationale\nwas that limiting students' access to SSBs within school\nshould reduce their overall consumption because they\nspend a large portion of their day in school during the\nschool year. We found no evidence that state SSB poli-\ncies were associated with lower overall consumption, how-\never, and our supplementary analyses revealed that\nchanges in students' in-school SSB access reduced infre-\nquent consumption (at least weekly) but slightly in-\ncreased frequent consumption (at least daily), suggest-\ning that heavier consumers compensated to a greater\nextent with increased consumption outside of school.\nOther studies similarly reported that schools were a rela-\ntively minor source of SSBs for adolescents3 and that the\nassociation between in-school SSB availability and SSB\nsogenic\" environment, youth have countless ways to ob-\ntain SSBs through convenience stores, fast-food restau-\nrants, and other food outlets in their community.\nThese patterns have led some experts to question\nwhether school-based policies will improve youth diet and\nreduce obesity.3,52,53 The development of time-series state-\nlevel policy databases will help to provide evidence on the\nextent to which such policies can reduce or prevent fur-\nther increases in overall consumption. Nonetheless, our re-\nsults based on a single cross section indicate that state poli-\nciesproducepositivechangesinschoolfoodenvironments,\nbutanyeffectonstudentdietaryconsumptionmaybemod-\nest without complementary changes in other sectors, in-\ncluding the food environment in the community, as well\nmended broader policies, such as SSB taxes55 or regula-\ntions of food marketing aimed at children.56 Future re-\nsearch should explore the effect that school-based policies\nhave on youth diet and weight gain when implemented in\nconjunction with policies in other sectors.\nOne of the strengths of this study was the ability to\nmeasure within-student changes in SSB access, purchas-\ning, and consumption between fifth and eighth grade. Be-\ncause the policies were compiled when the students were\nin eighth grade, though, it is impossible to conclude that\npolicies preceded any changes in access or purchasing.\nFurthermore, students who were not followed up over\ntime differed from the study sample in terms of socio-\neconomic characteristics, in-school SSB access, and over-\nall SSB consumption, which may have biased results if\nstudents of low socioeconomic status benefit more or less\nfrom policies. The associations, or lack thereof, could also\nbe biased by unmeasured confounding or measurement\nerror, because youth commonly misreport their dietary\nintake.57 Finally, the student questionnaires did not sepa-\nrate different types of SSBs. This precluded us from ex-\namining whether the lack of association between soda-\nonly policies and SSB access or purchasing is due to\nschools providing different types of SSBs or simply not\ncomplying with state policies.\nIn conclusion, comprehensive state policies that limit\nall SSBs within school appear effective in producing posi-\ntive changes in school food environments.
