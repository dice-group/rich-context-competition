The intro-\nduction of Basel 2, in particular, has led to concerns that risk-\nsensitive capital charges are highly correlated with the business\ncycle. The Basel Committee is contemplating a revision of the Ba-\nsel Accord by introducing counter-cyclical capital buffers. Others\nclaim that capital buffers are already large enough to absorb fluc-\ntuations in credit risk. We address the question of the pro-cyclical\neffects of capital requirements in a general framework which takes\ninto account banks' potential adjustment strategies. We develop\na dynamic model of bank lending behavior and simulate different\nregulatory frameworks and macroeconomic scenarios. In particu-\nlar, we address two related questions in our simulation study: How\ndo business fluctuations affect capital requirements and bank len-\nding? To what extent does the capital buffer absorb fluctuations\nin the level of mimimum required capital?\n",

The debate focuses\non two types of measures: One approach is to smooth capital requirements and make\nthem less sensitive to volatile credit risk developments. Another approach is to require\nbanks to build up capital buffers during good times of the business cycle that can be\nreleased in bad times. The paper addresses the question of whether a reform of the capital\nframework is necessary as banks already hold significant capital buffers. These issues are\naddressed using techniques from dynamic stochastic optimization in order to model a\nbank's capital decisions. In the optimization problem, a bank's capital is the state variable,\nwhile dividend payments and loan supply are the decision variables in each period. In the\nmodel, capital is important because it restricts the scope for lending. In addition, the\nbank incurs costs if it fails to meet the capital requirements.\nBased on these modeling assumptions, the impact of changes in the prevailing macroeco-\nnomic conditions and credit risk on banks' capital decisions is analyzed by distinguishing\nbetween unexpected shocks and expected cyclical variations.\nThe main results can be summarized as follows:\n\u00b7 Even in the absence of capital regulation, banks hold a significant amount of capital.\nIn the restricted cases, the bank holds a capital buffer well above the minimum\ncapital requirements (both in Basel 1 and 2).\n\u00b7 The capital buffer does not mitigate the volatility of capital requirements under\nthe risk-sensitive capital framework of Basel 2. Minimum capital requirements and\nactual capital are highly correlated. As a result lending under Basel 2 is significantly\nmore volatile.\n\u00b7 The impact strongly depends on whether or not the change in credit risk is unex-\npected. A sudden rise in credit risk may have a serious impact on loan supply. In\nthe case of expected changes, the effect hinges on the size of the interest margin. If\nit is low, volatility in lending might be high.\nGiven these observations, both a smoothing of minimum required capital over the busi-\nness cycle and the introduction of capital buffers might be appropriate solutions from a\nregulatory perspective. However, banks have a genuine incentive to hold capital cushions\non top of minimum required capital in order to avoid default through breaking regulatory\ncapital requirements. Therefore, mandatory regulatory buffers might be considered as an\nadditional capital requirement by banks as well as markets. Consequently, buffers have to\nbe defined in such a way that they can \"breath\" with the cycle: It has to be ensured that\nthey are build up in an expansion phase and can be drawn down during a recession. Fur-\nthermore, when designing a capital buffer, regulators need to take account of behavioral\nchanges in the capital management processes of banks as a response to the introduction\nof the risk-sensitive capital framework. According to our simulation results, bank lending\ndepends in a highly non-linear way on interest rates, PDs and other parameters that have\nan impact on banks' expected profits. Therefore, the selection of macroeconomic variables\nthat control the size of the buffer poses a key challenge.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nBestandteil der gegenw\u00a8\nartig geplanten Reformen des Basel 2-Regelwerkes \u00ad die bevor-\nstehenden Regel\u00a8\nanderungen werden h\u00a8\naufig auch als \"Basel 3\" bezeichnet \u00ad sind insbe-\nsondere Ma\u00dfnahmen zur D\u00a8\nampfung unerw\u00a8\nunschter pro-zyklischer Wirkungsketten.

Das Papier er\u00a8\nortert die Frage, inwie-\nweit eine Korrektur der bestehenden Regeln notwendig ist, da die Banken ohnehin gr\u00a8\no\u00dfere\nPuffer halten. Hierbei werden mathematische Verfahren der dynamischen stochastischen\nOptimierung angewendet, um die Entscheidungssituation der Banken abzubilden. Im be-\ntrachteten Optimierungsproblem bildet das Eigenkapital der Banken die Zustandsvaria-\nble, die Steuerungsvariablen sind die H\u00a8\nohe der Dividenzahlung sowie der Kreditvergabe in\njeder Periode. Kapitalanforderungen sind in zweifacher Hinsicht bedeutsam: Erstens stel-\nlen sie eine Begrenzung der m\u00a8\noglichen Kreditvergabe dar. Zweitens entstehen bankseitig\nKosten, falls die Bank durch Unterschreitung der regulatorischen Mindesteigenkapitalan-\nforderungen ausf\u00a8\nallt.\nBasierend auf diesen Modellannahmen wird der Einfluss des makro\u00a8\nokonomischen Um-\nfelds untersucht.

Bei G\u00a8\nultigkeit von Basel 1- und Basel 2- Kapitalanforderungen\nhalten die Banken erhebliche Kapitalpuffer \u00a8\nuber dem geforderten Minimum (sowohl\nunter Basel 1 als auch Basel 2).\n\u00b7 Andererseits zeigt der Kapitalpuffer keine mildernde Wirkung hinsichtlich der\nSchwankungen der Kreditvergabe. Aktuelles Eigenkapital und Mindesteigenkapital-\nanforderungen sind stark miteinander korreliert. Folglich ist auch die Kreditvergabe\nunter dem risikosensitiven Basel 2-Regelwerk wesentlich volatiler.\n\u00b7 Der Einfluss h\u00a8\nangt stark davon ab, ob die \u00a8\nAnderungen des Kreditrisikos von den\nBanken erwartet wurden, oder ob sie unerwartete Schocks darstellen.

Daher besteht die Gefahr,\ndass verpflichtende regulatorische Puffer von Banken als auch vom Markt als zus\u00a8\natzliche\nKapitalanforderungen verstanden werden.

It has replaced the capital framework of 1988, which had\nbeen criticized for its inadequate risk weighting. Whereas, in the old framework, the\nrisk weights of financial assets were largely determined by asset class, in the new frame-\nwork they are a function of obligors' creditworthiness, as measured by their probability\nof default (in the Internal Ratings Based approaches). On the other hand, as the mean\ncreditworthiness of debtors usually correlates with the business cycle, the new capital\nrequirements might give rise to regulatory induced volatility in capital holdings, and as a\nresult in lending. This might in turn aggravate economic downturns when banks have to\ncut their lending in response to eroding capital buffers. This problem had been identified\neven under the old framework, but with time-dependent risk weights, the pro-cyclical\neffect of minimum capital requirements might have become more severe.\nThe recent financial crisis has brought the need to reform the Basel framework back onto\nthe international regulatory agenda (BCBS, 2009). The Basel Committee (BCBS, 2010)\nnow suggests counteracting cyclicality of existing capital requirements by including two\n\"macroprudential\" buffers in the framework. The fixed buffer requires banks to retain\npart of their earnings if capital falls under a certain level of capital. The time-varying\ncapital buffer links capital to the rate of growth in lending.\nCritics claim that these measures tend to reduce the risk sensitivity of capital require-\nments and counteract the initial purpose of risk-sensitive capital requirements, namely to\nimprove the measurement of risk.\nThey purport that claims of pro-cyclical effects may be overstated as banks usually hold\na significant capital buffer on top of the required minimum. Thus, banks would simply\nreduce their capital buffer when capital requirements increase. However, we argue that it is\nnot clear whether capital buffers mitigate the problem of cyclicality in lending or actually\nmake it worse if one takes banks' risk-return considerations fully into account. In order to\nanalyze the problem in greater detail, we present a model for a bank's optimizing behavior\nunder regulatory constraints. We also differentiate between expected and unexpected\n1 The authors would like to thank the participants of the Eurobanking conference in Maribor in 2008,\nthe \"Workshop on the Potential Pro-Cyclicality of the New Regulatory Framework\" at the ECB in 2008\nand the Workshop \"Assessing the Impact of Financial Regulation\" at the Bank of Italy in Rome 2009 for\ncomments on earlier versions of this paper.\nchanges in credit risk.\nThere is a large stream of literature that analyzes the cyclical effects of risk-sensitive\ncapital requirements. Catarineu-Rabell et al. (2006), Goodhart et al. (2006), and Kashyap\nand Stein (2004) focus on the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the probabilities\nof default and the magnitude of cyclical variations in minimum capital requirements. By\ncontrast, Estrella (2004) determines the optimal level of capital in the presence of capital\ncosts and costs of failure. He shows that minimum capital requirements based on Value\nat Risk are likely to be pro-cyclical. Heid (2007) studies the effect of minimum capital\nrequirements in a macroeconomic framework and confirms the view that a risk-sensitive\ncapital framework is likely to be pro-cyclical but also that the capital buffer plays an\nimportant role in mitigating capital-driven cyclicality in lending.\nOur study is more closely related to several other studies which analyze capital require-\nments in a stochastic dynamic optimization framework. Zhu (2007) introduces an equi-\nlibrium model in which banks maximize expected discounted dividend payments but are\nconstrained in their lending behavior by minimum capital requirements. Peura and Keppo\n(2006) study banks optimal capital choice as a trade-off between the opportunity cost of\nequity capital, the loss of franchise value following a regulatory minimum capital viola-\ntion, and the cost of recapitalization. The assumed recapitalization results in a positive\nprobability of capital adequacy violation. Repullo and Suarez (2008), who model rela-\ntionship banking with endogenous loan rates, find that capital buffers are counter-cyclical\nunder risk-insensitive capital requirements and pro-cyclical under risk-sensitive capital\nrequirements.\n2 The framework\nIn our model, the representative bank generates interest income from a credit portfolio\nthat it funds with deposits and equity capital. Its objective is to maximize expected\ndiscounted dividends net of capital costs. As equity capital is more costly than deposits,\nthe bank faces a trade-off between high profitability with low capital ratios and greater\nsolvency with higher capital ratios. In determining the optimal level of capital, it is\nassumed that the bank can only build up capital by retaining earnings but cannot raise\nnew capital on the capital market. This assumption is made to keep the analysis tractable\nas otherwise the degree of freedom in the bank's decision problem would become too large.\nThe bank's second decision parameter is its portfolio composition. In particular, it can\nchoose between bonds and loans. The former pay a safe interest rate r, while the latter\npay an interest rate of t\nwhich exceeds r due to the loans' credit risk.\nThe bank enters period t with capital Ct\nand customer deposits D. We assume the latter\nto be fixed over time. As stated above, the bank determines its current dividend payments\ndt\nand its level of loans Lt\n. The level of safe bonds in its portfolio is implicitly derived\nfrom its budget constraint:\nCt\n- dt\n+ D = Lt\n+ Bt\nAll loans have an ex ante equal probability of default pt\n, which may however vary over\ntime. By contrast, the loss given default given by LGD is fixed. The default correlation\nis implicitly determined by the asset correlation .2 Vasicek (2002) showed that under\ncertain conditions the (random) default rate q converges to the following distribution:\nq  F(x, p, ) = \n\n\nThe bank's (random) profit before dividend pay-outs in period t + 1 is given by\n= r \u00b7 (Ct\n- dt\n) + (t\n- r) \u00b7 Lt\n- LGD \u00b7 Lt\nThus capital before dividend pay-outs is given by\n= Ct\n- dt\nThe bank's balance sheets at t and t + 1 are depicted in Figure 1.\nAssets Liabilities\nLt\nCt\n- dt\nBt\nD\nAssets Liabilities\nCt\n- dt\nD\nFigure 1: Balance sheet of the bank at times t and t + 1.\nThe (opportunity) costs of capital are equal to z per unit capital invested. We assume\nthat a bank's dividend pay-outs may not exceed its current level of equity capital. If\nlosses in the bank's loan portfolio deplete its capital and the bank becomes insolvent, it\nwill disappear from the market and capital once invested is lost. Summing up, the bank's\noptimization problem reads as follows:\n2The asset correlation can be interpreted as the correlation in the borrowing firms' assets.\nmax\n{dt,Lt}t=0,...,\nE\n\nt\n\u00b7 (dt\n- z \u00b7 C\nt\ns.t. Lt\n Ct\n- dt\ndt\n Ct\n=\nCt\n- dt\nif Ct\n0 otherwise\nC\n=\nCt\notherwise.\nThe target function (5) is defined as the discounted dividend payments net of capital\ncosts. The constraint (6) corresponds to the budget constraint (1), and (8) is the default\nconstraint. For the discount factor we set t\nt\n.\nThe bank's optimization problem is a stochastic dynamic system with state variable Ct\n,\ntransition equation (8) and decision variables dt\nand Lt\n. Thus, the following Bellman\nequation holds:\nV (C) = max\n(d,L)At\n{d - z \u00b7 C +  \u00b7 E[V (C - d + )|C - d +   0] (10)\n-\n\u00b7 C \u00b7 P(C - d +  < 0)}\nfor all C. The sets At\ninclude all feasible (d, L) as determined by the constraints (6) to\n(9). The right hand side of equation (10) is split into two parts. The first term refers to\nthe case where the bank survives in the following period, whereas the second part reflects\nthe cost of default.\nMinimum capital requirements, also referred to as MCRs throughout this paper, restrict\nthe bank's leverage and riskiness. Both fixed MCRs and risk-sensitive MCRs can be de-\nscribed in terms of risk weighted assets (RWA), which are defined as the weighted average\nof a bank's assets, where the risk weights are determined according to the perceived risk of\nthe particular asset. Under fixed MCRs and risk-sensitive MCRs, a bank's risk weighted\nassets must not exceed a certain multiple of its capital, or, equivalently, the ratio of capital\nto risk weighted assets (regulatory capital ratio) must exceed a certain threshold a, ie\nC\nRWA\nUnder fixed MCRs and risk-sensitive MCRs, the threshold a is given by 8%. However,\nfixed MCRs and risk-sensitive MCRs differ in the way risk weights are calculated. Under\nfixed MCRs, risk weights are determined by the type of the respective asset, eg 100%\nfor loans, 20% for interbank exposures and 0% for OECD sovereign exposures. By con-\ntrast, under the Internal Ratings Based approaches, risk weights are determined by the\nestimated probability of default and other risk parameters. For our model, we assume a\npositive risk weight w for loans and a zero weight for riskless bonds for both fixed MCRs\nand risk-sensitive MCRs. The regulatory requirement can therefore be rewritten as:\nC\nw \u00b7 L\nIn our model, we assume that regulatory requirements have to be fulfilled both at the be-\nginning and at the end of an investment period. The former imposes a binding restriction\non the choice of the bank's portfolio. The latter is of indirect nature. As a result of credit\nrisk, it is uncertain ex ante whether the bank will be able to meet capital requirements at\nthe end of the investment period when losses have materialized. However, we assume that\na bank that fails to meet regulatory requirements is closed down by regulators. Summing\nup, the decision problem with regulatory requirements can be written as:\nmax\n{dt,Lt}t=0,...,\nE\n\nt\n\u00b7 (dt\n- z \u00b7 C\nt\ns.t. Lt\n Ct\n- dt\n+ Dt\nwt\n\u00b7 Lt\ndt\n Ct\n=\nCt\n- dt\nif Ct\n a \u00b7 w \u00b7 Lt-1\n0 otherwise\nC\n=\nCt\notherwise.\nThe Bellman equation now reads\nV (C) = max\n(d,L)At\n{d - z \u00b7 C +  \u00b7 E[V (C - d + )|C - d +   a \u00b7 wt\n\u00b7 Lt\n-\n\u00b7 C \u00b7 P(C - d +  < a \u00b7 wt\n\u00b7 Lt\n)}.\nAs in the unconstrained case, the second term reflects the cost of default, which occurs\nin this case if the bank does not meet the minimum capital requirements.\n3 Scenario analysis\nIn this paper we measure the pro-cyclicality of the bank's behavior in terms of its equity\ncapital, dividend payments, and lending. If the dynamic system is shocked, i.e. if one\nassumes shocks in the exogenous variables, these will deviate from its long-term average.\nDepending on the bank's characteristics and the general regulatory framework, the de-\nviation might be modest, which would indicate mild pro-cyclical behavior, or large, in\nwhich case it is strong. In our case, the key exogenous variable measuring the state of\nthe economy is the probability of creditors' default (PD). If the PD is low, the economy\nis in good shape, and vice versa. We assess the dependence of capital and lending on\nPDs by means of a scenario analysis. We study and compare the results of three different\nsettings:\n(i) The unrestricted case: The bank is constrained by the insolvency condition but not\nby any capital requirements.\n(ii) The fixed MCR case: Risk weights are fixed over time for non-defaulted loans\n(iii) The risk-sensitive MCR case: Capital requirements depend on the bank's credit\nrisk, i.e. on PD.\nw = LGD \u00b7 \n- PD \u00b7\nNote that this formula represents the risk weight function for corporate obligors.3\nIn the scenario analysis below, the return on equity is set to z = 10% and the riskless\nrate to r = 4%. We further assume a loss given default of LGD = 45%, which is the rate\nimplicitly assumed in Basel 2's Foundation IRB approach.4 The correlation parameter is\nset to  = 30%. Finally, the amount of deposits is assumed to be fixed over time and\nnormalized to D = 3.\nNote that a rise in PDs has two effects. First, expected credit losses will be higher.\nIn particular, since a constant loss rate was assumed, the credit loss will be equal to\nLGD \u00b7 PD. Second, credit risk as measured by the deviation of the loss from its expected\nvalue will change too. Usually this deviation \u00ad frequently called the unexpected loss \u00ad is\n3In particular we assume a residual maturity of 2.5 years and the respective maturity adjustment\n4Under the Foundation IRB, banks are required to use their own estimates of the risk-parameter PD,\nwhile LGDs and EADs are specified by the supervisory framework, eg LGD = 45% for unsecured loans.\nmeasured by a suitable percentile of the normalized loss distribution. The bank will take\ninto account both the expected and the unexpected loss when determining its reaction to\na change in PDs.\nIn this regard, an important factor will be whether or not the bank had anticipated the\nchange in PDs. Unanticipated changes are likely to induce more abrupt shifts in lending\nthan anticipated ones. For instance, in the case of the latter the bank may build up\nsufficient capital buffers in order to protect itself against unexpected losses in its credit\nportfolio.\n3.1 Unanticipated credit risk shocks\nIn this section we analyze the effects of an unanticipated shock to credit risk and capital.\nWe assume that the economy is in a stable equilibrium with no fluctuations in expected\ncredit risk.\nIn the following we compare three different regimes: the absence of any capital require-\nments, fixed capital requirements, and risk-sensitive capital requirements. In order to\nensure that the comparison of the latter two is not distorted by level effects, the long-\nterm level of borrowers' PD is set to 126bp. In this case, risk-sensitive risk weights\nexactly match fixed risk weights ex ante. All future deviations (after the assumed shocks\nto PDs) are thus the result of differences in the two frameworks' design and not because\nof differences in the levels of initial capital.\nAs a result of this assumption, the lending policies for fixed MCRs and risk-sensitive MCRs\ncoincide. The same holds true for dividend policies. The policy functions are depicted as\nsolid lines in Figure 2. Clearly, they have a distinct, non-linear shape. The dividend policy\nfunction remains flat and equal to zero up to a certain capital threshold. Thereafter it is\nlinearly upward sloping. By contrast, the loan policy is linearly upward sloping in the first\nsection, which ends at approximately the same level of capital as in the case of the dividend\npolicy, and flat thereafter. This suggests the following interpretation: For low levels of\n(initial) capital, the bank primarily aims to build up its capital buffer through retained\nearnings. It therefore refrains from paying out any dividends to its shareholders. Step\nby step, however, and in line with capital accumulation, it increases its volume of loans.\nFor high levels of capital, the process reverses. Then dividend payments take priority and\nsurplus capital is paid out to shareholders. At the same time, the bank does not change\nits volume of loans until a new equilibrium is reached, which is presumably somewhere\nnear the kink in the policy function. We determine the long-run level of capital and loans\nby simulating the bank's investment and capital decisions. We start with a given value\nof initial capital and simulate the subsequent development in random profits, capital,\ndividends, and loan supply. Thus we generate a total of 200 independent random paths.\nWe take the capital after 20 periods as a realization of long-term capital, provided that\nthe bank neither became insolvent nor violated minimum capital requirements in the\npreceding periods. The average of such values serves as the estimate for the expected\nvalue of long-term capital in the subsequent analysis. The long-term values for capital as\nwell as for lending and dividend payments are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Overview: Long-term capital, loans, dividends\nUnrestr. Fixed MCRs Risk-sens. MCRs\nAll remaining fluctuations are random, resulting from random losses in the bank's loan\nbook. Importantly, as long as credit risk remains constant, those fluctuations are expected,\nand there is no need for the bank to change its policies as opposed to the respective realized\nlevels of capital and lending in one particular point in time.\nBefore analyzing a shift in PDs, it is instructive to analyze an unanticipated reduction\nin capital. This drop in capital may for instance result from extraordinary losses in\nthe bank's loan book. So we assume that the model bank incurs a drop in capital in\nthe amount of 5%, which roughly corresponds to the 90% quantile of the capital loss\ndistribution. From the policy functions we infer that in the unrestricted case the bank\nreduces its dividend payments by 13% compared with its long-term average. Under fixed\nMCRs and risk-sensitive MCRs the shift is more pronounced, with dividend payments\nfalling by 30%. At the same time, one observes no reduction in lending. In other words,\neven larger losses in capital do not affect lending. The situation would change, of course,\nif we assumed very extreme losses in capital.\nWe now simulate a sudden and isolated one-time rise in the borrower's PD by 100%. As\na result, required regulatory capital under risk-sensitive MCRs rises by 22.5%. As risk\nweights are fixed, the rise in credit risk has no effect on regulatory capital under fixed\nMCRs. Note however, that it may still have a significant effect on desired capital as a\nresult of a change in the unexpected loss.\nAs above, we assume that the shock in credit risk is a one-time event and that credit\nrisk returns to its previous level thereafter. In contrast to the sudden shift in capital\ndiscussed above, the bank will change its dividend and lending policies. Although it\ndid not anticipate the change in PDs, the old policies are no longer optimal against the\nbackground of higher credit risk. It is easy to show that the optimization problem boils\ndown to solving a profit maximization problem in two periods. In particular, we denote\nby V the value function derived from the solution with fixed PDs. Obviously, the optimal\npolicies after the PDs have returned to their long-term levels are those which are optimal\nCapital\nFixed MCRs: Dividends shock and long term\nCapital\nFixed MCRs: Loans shock and long term\nCapital\nRisk sens.

For the unre-\nstricted case, virtually no change in lending takes place. At the same time, dividend pay-\nments are cut by nearly 30% in order to keep the loan-to-capital ratio constant in times\nof higher expected losses. Under the regime with fixed capital requirements, the bank\nmoderately reduces its lending (by approximately 6%) when faced with higher PDs. The\nreduction in dividend payments is significant, equalling nearly 20%. Under the regime\nwith risk-sensitive capital requirements, we observe a significant reduction of lending\n(minus 21%). The drop in dividend payments is similar to the case with fixed capital\nrequirements.\nFigure 3 shows the evolution of mean lending over time for the three regimes under\nconsideration (solid line). For the two scenarios with capital requirements, we added a\nline that shows the maximum permitted loan volume under the respective capital regime\n(dashed line). It is important to note, that the bank reduces its loan exposure although\nit still has sufficient capital buffers that would allow it to lend more. Therefore, it is\nPeriod\nLoans Unrestricted\nPeriod\nLoans, Max. poss. loans Fixed MCRs\nPeriod\nLoans, Max. poss. loans Risk sens.

Fixed MCRs Risk-sens. MCRs\n3.2 Expected credit risk fluctuations\nHaving discussed unanticipated shocks in credit risk and capital, we now move to expected\nfluctuations in PDs and profits. In order to do so, we incorporate a very simple model\nof business fluctuations into our framework. In particular, we assume that the (relevant\npart of the) macroeconomy is represented by the evolution of the mean probability of\ndefault (PD). We take the assumed default correlation between individual borrowers at a\nparticular point in time and leave it at that. We assume that the underlying probability\ndistribution of the PD process is known to the bank. Therefore, to the extent that the\nbank can predict the future state of the economy, it will be able to provision against\nchanges in mean credit risk.\nIt is assumed that the evolution of mean PDs follows a Markov process. The two states of\nthe economy, which we call Good and Bad, represent an upturn or respectively downturn\nof the economy. The mean PD in each state is equal to pG\nand pB\n. The transition matrix\nis given by\n=\nGG\nGB\nBG\nBB\n.\nThe Bellman equations for the corresponding dynamic optimization problem are as fol-\nlows:\nVi\n(C) = max\n(d,L)At\n{d - z \u00b7 C +  \u00b7 ii\n\u00b7 E[Vi\n(C - d + i\n)] +  \u00b7 ij\n\u00b7 Vj\n(C - d + j\nIn the scenario analysis below, we distinguish between two settings. In the \"persistence\"\nscenario, we assume that the mean PD has the tendency to remain in a particular state.\nIn the \"reversion\" scenario we assume that the economy always reverts to the good state\nrelatively quickly.\nPersistence scenario\nFor the persistence scenario, each state occurs with unconditional probability 0.5 and the\nfollowing symmetric transition matrix is assumed:\nP\n=\nAs mentioned above, any fair assessment of risk-sensitive capital requirements should\nabstract from pure level effects. However, with time-varying PDs, risk-sensitive capital\nrequirements necessarily vary over time. In the scenario analysis below, conditional PDs\nare set such that on average risk-sensitive capital requirements and fixed capital require-\nments coincide. As was noted above, that holds true if unconditional PDs are equal to\n0.0126. As the unconditional state probabilities are equal to 0.5, this constrains the choice\nCapital\nFixed MCRs: Div. policies Good and Bad\nCapital\nFixed MCRs: Loan policies Good and Bad\nCapital\nRisk sens.

This leaves us with PDs given by pGood\nFor the loan interest rate, standard economic models predict that the spread over the\nriskless rate should cover both expected loss and capital costs for unexpected losses.\nAssuming a LGD of 45%, the expected loss is given by\nEL = LGD \u00b7 (0.5 \u00b7 pGood\nThe unexpected losses are usually defined as some quantile of the loss distribution. In\nour case we assumed the 99.99% quantile.5 Therefore, for the total spread we have\nAs a further robustness check, we assume an additional stress scenario. In a low interest\nrate scenario the spread is set to 2.33%.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the respective policy functions for the moderate and low interest\nrate scenario. For moderate interest rates, the general pattern of the respective policy\nfunctions for dividend payments and lending resembles those above for time-invariant PDs.\nIn particular for lending, it is upward sloping in the first part, up to a certain capital level,\nand flat thereafter. Moreover, lending \u00ad and for that matter dividend payments \u00ad are lower\nin the bad state than in the good state given a certain level of capital. All in all, however,\nthe policy functions for the good and bad state are fairly close.\nThe situation reverses for the low interest rate scenario. In this case, lending falls signifi-\ncantly (for a given level of capital) when the economy moves from the good into the bad\nstate, at least if capital exceeds a certain threshold. Interestingly, the policy function for\ndividend payments in the bad state is \u00ad from a certain capital threshold \u00ad above the one\nfor dividend payments in the good state.\nIn a second step, we simulated the behavior of banks with the aforementioned policy\nfunctions. Results are shown in Tables 3 and 4. For our key variables, such as loans,\ncapital and capital ratios, we determined the average value as well as the conditional\nmean given a good or bad state of the economy. Results of Table 3 show that dividend\npayments are approximately 40% higher in good times compared to bad times under fixed\nMCRs. For risk-sensitive MCRs the difference is even bigger and approximately equals\n69%. As a result, the difference in capital levels for the respective states of the economy is\n5Often a lower p-value is assumed. The higher level accounts for additional liquidity risk, which is not\nexplicitly modelled here.\nsmall. With regard to lending, the difference is negligible. Moving to a scenario with lower\ninterest rates, the differences between good and bad states become more pronounced, in\nparticular with regard to lending.\nSome interesting observations can be made with regard to the leverage ratio, which has\nreceived considerable regulatory attention recently: First, under both regulatory regimes\nthis ratio is higher in the good state than in the bad state. Second, as expected, the\ndifference in the leverage ratios of the good and the bad state is bigger under risk-sensitive\nMCRs than under fixed MCRs. Third, under both regimes, leverage is much lower than\nunder the unregulated system. Fourth, the unregulated system is much more cyclical \u00ad\nas measured by the difference between leverage ratios in the good and bad state \u00ad than\nboth regulated systems.\nReversion scenario\nIn the reversion scenario we simulate an economy which is more often in the good state\nthan in the bad state. Moreover, once the economy is in the bad state it is likely to revert\nto the good state in the following period.\nTo simulate this setting, we assume the following transition matrix:\nR\n=\nThe transition matrix is symmetric, which means that the (conditional) probability of\nmoving to a particular state, e.g. the bad state, does not depend on the current state of\nthe economy. The loan interest rate, which is assumed to be constant, is determined in a\nsimilar fashion as above. For the high interest rate sub-scenario we chose  = 7.09% and\n = 6.43% for the low interest rate scenario.\nThe policy functions for the two scenarios are depicted in figures 6 and 7. Since the\nconditional probabilities do not depend on the current state, the (conditional) policy\nfunctions for the good and the bad state coincide, unlike in the persistence scenario. As\nwas the case for the persistence scenario, we find the same strong non-linear pattern for\nthe low interest rate scenario. As policies do not vary between good and bad states of\nthe economy, any fluctuations in the conditional means of loans and dividends is purely\nthe result of different loss distributions for each state. In particular, expected losses are\nhigher in the bad state than in the good state. However, the variation in lending and\ndividends are very small (Tables 5 and 6). We do not discuss the results for the high\ninterest scenario here, which are similar.\nTable 7 compares the findings for fixed and risk-sensitive capital requirements. As ex-\npected, lending is more volatile under the latter than under the former. The degree of\nvolatility depends largely on the level of expected earnings. If the loan interest rate is\nhigh, volatility is negligible whereas if it is low, volatility can become very significant.\nThis holds true even for the reversion scenario where policies for the good and bad state\nare equal. Obviously, the degree of volatility results less from a change in policies than\nfrom the sensitivity, for a given policy, of lending with regard to the level of capital. The\nresults also show that capital buffers partially absorb the volatility in minimum capital\nrequirements as shown by the high degree of correlation.\n4 Conclusion\nThis paper aims to explain the evolution of capital and capital buffers over time and com-\npares different regulatory frameworks (fixed MCRs, risk-sensitive MCRs and the absence\nof any regulatory capital framework). The general framework uses models of stochastic\ndynamic optimization in order to study banks' adjustment strategies vis a vis changes\nin macroeconomic conditions. The model can explain the presence of substantial capital\nbuffers on top of required holdings. The model predicts that banks will reduce lending\nand cut dividend payments during economic downturns even if they still hold sufficient\ncapital buffers to meet capital requirements. Importantly, large capital buffers do not\nnecessarily mitigate the problem of cyclicality: Minimum required and actual capital of-\nten move in sync. The drop in lending is more pronounced if the random shock to PDs\nis unexpected. However, even if they are expected \u00ad in the sense that banks know their\nprobability distribution \u00ad cyclicality can be significant, in particular if interest margins\nare relatively small.\nThe findings suggest that the problem of cyclicality in the current Basel framework does\nindeed need to be addressed. However, there might be no easy way to fix the problem,\nas any change in regulatory measures will provoke an adaptive reaction. Making capital\nrequirements less cyclical might not necessarily mean that actual lending becomes less\nvolatile. In designing new macro-prudential instruments, it is therefore essential to take\ninto account the reaction function of financial intermediaries.\nReferences\nBCBS (2006).
