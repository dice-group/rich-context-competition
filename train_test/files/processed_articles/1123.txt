A 3-year study of a high-risk sample\nfound that women's baseline depressive symptomatol-\nogy was predictive of their male partners' subsequent per-\npetration of psychological but not physical abuse.20 A\n6-year study of male and female high school students\nfound that depressive symptomatology in adolescence was\nnot associated with subsequent physical aggression in dat-\ning relationships or marriage (perpetration and victim-\nization were not distinguished).21 A retrospective na-\ntional study of married or cohabiting adults found that\npremarital depression was not associated with subse-\nquent IPV victimization among women.22 A 5-year study\nof female high school students found that the propor-\ntion of days spent in depressive episodes was positively\nassociated with psychological and physical abuse by boy-\nfriends over the follow-up period; temporal order of de-\npressive episodes and abuse could not be ascertained.16\nGiven the high prevalence of depressive symptomatol-\nogy and IPV exposure among female youth in the United\nStates,aswellasresearchdemonstratingmanyadversepsy-\nchosocial outcomes for adolescents with depressive symp-\ntomatology,thisstudyexaminedwhetherdepressivesymp-\ntomatology among adolescent girls is predictive of\nsubsequent IPV exposure in late adolescence and young\nadulthood. Analyses were conducted with prospective,\npopulation-based data from the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health).23\nMETHODS\nDESIGN\nThe Add Health study is a longitudinal study of the determi-\nnants and contexts of youth health and risk behaviors. In sum-\nmary, a stratified random sample of 80 US high schools and 52\nmiddle schools was selected with probability of selection pro-\nportional to school size. Stratification was with respect to re-\ngion of country, urbanicity, school size, school type, and race/\nethnic composition. Wave 1 structured, closed-ended home\ninterviews were conducted with youth in grades 7 through 12\npling weights had a parental figure who participated in a wave\n1 parent interview. Wave 2 home interview data were col-\nweights=10 828). Written informed consent was provided by\nyouth participants as well as a parental figure at waves 1 and 2\nand by youth participants at wave 3. Approval for the full Add\nHealth study was granted by the institutional review board of\nthe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Pub-\nlic Health; approval for the present data analysis was granted\nby the Human Subjects Committee of the Harvard School of\nPublic Health (Boston, Mass).\nSAMPLE\nThe study sample was restricted to the 1659 girls in the contrac-\ntual use data set24 who participated in home interviews at waves\n1, 2, and 3; had sample weights; and were selected for the couples\nsample of the Add Health study. One half of all wave 3\u00adeligible\nsubjects were randomly selected to be considered for the wave\n3 couples sample. By design, the couples sample includes one-\nthird dating couples, one-third cohabiting couples, and one-\nthirdmarriedcouples.Criteriaforinclusioninthecouplessample\nwere (1) involvement in a current relationship; (2) relationship\nduration of 3 months or more; (3) opposite-sex relationship; and\n(4) partner 18 years or older. The sample for the present study\nwas also restricted to subjects who had nonmissing data regard-\ning IPV outcomes and who had 3 or fewer missing items on the\nwave 2 depressive symptoms scale. Three subjects who re-\nported that their partner had physically abused them more than\n1 year prior to the wave 3 interview, but not within the past year,\nwere also excluded so as to maintain temporal clarity between\nwave 2 depressive symptoms and IPV exposure (Figure).\nMEASURES\nBaseline Depressive Symptomatology\nSelf-reported past-week depressive symptomatology was as-\nsessed both as a dichotomous and continuous variable at wave\n2, with a 19-item, modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies\nScale (CES-D) used in the Add Health survey.25 The original\n20-item scale has been widely used as a measure of depressive\nGirls With Sample Weights Interviewed at Both Waves 1 and 2\nInterviewed at Wave 3\nIncluded in the Wave 3 Couples Sample\nHad Nonmissing IPV Outcomes\nHad 3 Missing Items on Depressive Symptoms Scale\nSubjects With Early but No Past-Year IPV Perpetration by Current Partner Excluded\nFinal Sample\nFigure.

In the modified Add Health scale, 2 original CES-D\nitems were removed (\"I had crying spells\" and \"My sleep was\nrestless\") and 1 item was added (\"I felt that life was not worth\nliving\"). Two additional items were rephrased. Item scores in\nthe modified scale correspond to symptom frequency and range\nfrom 0 (\"never or rarely\") to 3 (\"most or all of the time\"); scale\nscores range from 0 to 56. Internal consistency reliability in the\npresent sample was 0.89, similar to that found for the CES-D\nA CES-D cutoff score of 24 has been found to maximize sen-\nsitivity (0.84) and specificity (0.75) for Diagnostic and Statis-\ntical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition29 major\ndepressive disorder or dysthymia for adolescent girls.27 Pro-\nportionally adapted to the 19-item scale, the cutoff score used\nin this study for above-threshold or \"high\" depressive symp-\nformed with the continuous scale for greater statistical power.\nControl Variables\nAge. This was a continuous variable for age at wave 2.\nRace/Ethnicity. Four categories were used: non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other. Youth reporting more\nthan 1 race/ethnicity were assigned to the category with which\nthey indicated they most identify.\nWave 1 Parental Education. This was a dichotomous variable\nindicating whether the highest educational attainment among\nresident parental figures at wave 1 was less than high school.\nData were obtained from the parent interview.\nCovariates\nChildhood Experience of Physical and/or Sexual Abuse. At\nwave 3, subjects were asked 2 self-administered questions re-\ngarding the time before they entered the sixth grade: (1) \"How\noften had your parents or other adult caregivers slapped, hit,\nor kicked you?\" and (2) \"How often had one of your parents\nor other adult caregivers touched you in a sexual way, forced\nyou to touch him or her in a sexual way, or forced you to have\nsexual relations?\" A dichotomous variable was created reflect-\ning subject report of being slapped, hit, or kicked more than 5\ntimes and/or report of any occurrence of sexual abuse.\nDating Violence and/or Forced Sex Between Waves 1 and 2.\nAt wave 2, subjects were asked whether any partner they had\nhad since wave 1 ever threatened them with violence, pushed\nor shoved them, or thrown something at them that could hurt.\nSubjects who indicated at wave 2 that they had ever had\nsexual intercourse were also asked whether they were ever\nphysically forced to have sexual intercourse against their will\nsince the wave 1 interview. These data were collected with au-\ndio computer-assisted self-interview. 32,33 A dichotomous vari-\nable was created reflecting 1 or more affirmative responses to\nthese items.\nOutcome Variables\nMild Violence. At wave 3, subjects were asked 1 self-\nadministered question regarding how often in the past year their\ncurrent partner had threatened them with violence, pushed or\nshoved them, or thrown something at them that could hurt. A\ndichotomous variable was created reflecting any past-year ex-\nperience of this outcome.\nModerate to Severe Physical Violence. At wave 3, subjects were\nasked 1 self-administered question regarding how often in the\npast year their current partner had slapped, hit, or kicked them\nand another question regarding how often in the past year they\nhad had an \"injury, such as a sprain, bruise, or cut\" because of a\nfight with their current partner. A dichotomous variable was cre-\nated reflecting experience of either or both of these outcomes.\nAll analyses were conducted with SAS version 8 (SAS Institute\nInc, Cary, NC). Logistic regression models were estimated us-\ning the 2 dichotomous violence variables as dependent vari-\nables. The SAS proc GENMOD function (generalized estimat-\ning equations) was used for all regressions, with specification\nof an independent working correlation structure. The use of\ngeneralized estimating equations accounts for data clustering\nto provide robust standard error estimation.\nMultivariate models first adjusted for control variables of age,\nrace/ethnicity, and parental education (model 1) and then ad-\nditionally adjusted for covariates of childhood physical/sexual\nabuse and dating violence/forced sex (model 2). All baseline data\nfor these analyses were collected at wave 2, except for wave 1\nparental education and wave 3 retrospective childhood abuse.\nPotential interactions between depressive symptomatol-\nogy and each of the 2 prior abuse covariates were examined\nseparately in unadjusted and adjusted models predicting mild\nand moderate to severe abuse outcomes, with both the dichoto-\nmous and continuous depressive symptoms variables. These\ninteraction terms were insignificant in all model specifica-\ntions and were not included in final models.\nIn addition, 2 variables reflecting wave 2 alcohol abuse co-\nmorbidity (frequent drinking and heavy drinking) were con-\nsidered for inclusion as covariates; neither variable was in-\ncluded in final models because they were not associated in\nbivariate or multivariate models with either IPV outcome, and\ntheir addition to the adjusted models did not alter the effect\nsize or significance of depressive symptoms. This may have been\nowing to insufficient statistical power.\nVariables reflecting subjects' relationship status were also\nnot included in final models because relationship status was\nviewed as a potential mediator between depressive symptoms\nand IPV exposure. Inclusion of relationship status variables in\npreliminary analyses, however, produced no difference in the\neffect size or significance level of depressive symptomatology\nwith regard to either IPV outcome.\nAll analyses used adjusted grand sample weights to ac-\ncount for wave 3 nonresponse and subgroup oversampling. For\nanalyses examining the outcome of mild IPV, a subsample of\n1632 subjects was used; 27 subjects who reported exposure to\nmoderate to severe but not mild violence at wave 3 were ex-\ncluded. For analyses examining moderate to severe IPV, a sub-\nenced mild but not moderate to severe violence were excluded.\nFor the 15 subjects who were missing 3 or fewer items on the\nwave 2 depressive symptoms scale, the mean of the remaining\nitems was imputed for each missing item.\nRESULTS\nnon-Hispanic black, 10.6% Hispanic, and 5.3% other race/\nethnicities (Table 1).

Twenty-eight percent of girls with high lev-\nels of baseline depressive symptomatology, correspond-\ning to an elevated likelihood of mood disorder, reported\nsome form of past-year physical IPV victimization 5 years\nlater. Girls with high baseline depressive symptoms had\n1.86 times the odds of girls with lower symptom levels\nof subsequent exposure to moderate to severe IPV, and\nvictimization risk was also found to increase with in-\ncreasing levels of continuous depressive symptomatol-\nogy. The finding that childhood abuse and dating violence/\nforced sex were associated with subsequent IPV risk also\nprovides prospective evidence that prior abuse is predic-\ntive of revictimization among young women.\nThe time of transition from adolescence to adult-\nhood is one of increasing independence from parents,\nstrengthening self-concept, and critical decision mak-\ning regarding education, occupation, and intimate rela-\ntionships, all of which have a salient impact on the long-\nterm social trajectory of the individual.16,19 Depression\nthat occurs during this time of transition may have a par-\nticularly significant impact on maturational processes and\nchoices made, generating a trajectory of risk for contin-\nued psychosocial impairment and psychopathol-\nRegarding social pathways that may be affected by de-\npression in adolescence, studies of peer group homoph-\nily and assortative mating have found that adolescents\nand adults with depressive symptoms or disorders often\nothers who have similar levels of symptomatology. In turn,\ndepressive symptoms and disorders among men have been\nfound to be positively associated with subsequent psy-\nchological20 and/or physical22 aggression toward an in-\ntimate partner.\nDepressive symptomatology is also associated with a\nrange of adolescent risk behaviors including substance\nuse and abuse,40-42 and depressed youth are more likely\nto associate with deviant or risky peer groups18 from which\npartner selection is likely to occur. Alcohol and drug use,\nin turn, have been associated in some studies with males'\nphysical abuse perpetration toward their dating part-\nners,43 cohabiting partners, and wives.44 Depressive symp-\ntomatology has also been associated with antisocial be-\nbehavior20,21 among male adolescents are associated with\nincreased likelihood of physical IPV perpetration. In sum,\ndepressive symptomatology may elevate girls' risk of fu-\nture IPV exposure by way of its contribution to risky peer\ngroup affiliations and assortative partnering with high-\nrisk mates.\nIn addition to differential selection into abusive rela-\ntionships, young women with a history of depressive\nsymptomatology may be less likely to leave abusive re-\nlationships (or take a longer time to leave) for various\nreasons. First, insofar as depression in adolescence is pre-\ndictive of outcomes such as teenage childbearing, dimin-\nished educational attainment, and unemployment, it may\nbe associated with increased economic dependency on\nfuture partners and thus decreased likelihood of rela-\ntionship exit.47,48 Second, increasing social isolation of the\nwoman from family and friends is a common feature of\nabusive relationships, and diminished social support is\nanother obstacle to relationship exit.49,50 Depressed youth\noften have impaired social relationships and dimin-\nthat young women with former or current depression may\nenter intimate relationships from a starting point of greater\nisolation than those with no former or current depres-\nsion. This diminished potential pool of external sup-\nport may contribute to an increased likelihood of not leav-\ning, or returning to, an abusive partner. Girls with a history\nof depression and diminished social support may also\nplace an elevated premium on intimacy and mainte-\nnance of a relationship with a romantic partner and be\nmore willing to tolerate acts of violence from an other-\nwise seemingly secure partner.48\nThird, depression is a primary psychological re-\nsponse to abuse, and Barnett48 notes that depression or\nother mental health difficulties due to IPV may impair\nwomen's ability to mobilize to exit their relationships.\nWomen who have a history of vulnerability to depres-\nsion may have an increased likelihood of responding to\nthe stressor of IPV with depression or other debilita-\ntion, contributing to a decreased likelihood of relation-\nship exit. Further research should examine these and other\npotential mechanisms.\nThis study has several limitations. First, the adapted\nCES-D scale is not a diagnostic instrument. The wave 2\nmeasurement of past-week depressive symptomatology\nmay also not fully reflect the severity, chronicity, or re-\ncurrence of symptomatology over the period between\nwaves 2 and 3, which may be relevant to likelihood of\nfuture IPV exposure. However, depressive symptoms and\nTable 4.

The childhood abuse, dat-\ning violence, and sexual coercion covariates do not ac-\ncount for all relevant time in respondents' lives, and the\nwave 2 sexual coercion item focuses only on forced in-\ntercourse. The Add Health study also does not include a\nmeasure of exposure to interparental violence, which has\nbeen found to be predictive of women's subsequent de-\npressive symptomatology55 and abuse by an intimate part-\nner.56 Third, IPV is frequently underreported by survi-\nvors,57,58 which may have led to bias in results. Fourth,\nthis study did not address perpetration; this relation-\nship should be examined with surveys that distinguish\nbetween violence committed in self-defense or retalia-\ntion and self-initiated acts.59 Finally, the generalizabil-\nity of the study findings is limited, given the specific na-\nture of the sample.\nOverall, this study provides evidence that elevated lev-\nels of depressive symptomatology among adolescent girls\nare associated with an increased vulnerability to subse-\nquent IPV exposure in late adolescence and young adult-\nhood. However, the question of whether depressive symp-\ntomatology plays an independent role in shaping the\ntrajectory toward future IPV exposure among young\nwomen, or whether it is simply a marker for IPV risk, is\nnot fully resolved with the present study and warrants\nfurtherinvestigation.Ifdepressivesymptomatologyamong\nadolescent girls becomes recognized as an independent\npredictor of subsequent IPV exposure, this will be one\nmore reason to increase efforts in the prevention, iden-\ntification, and treatment of depressive symptomatology\namong adolescent girls. If depressive symptomatology\ncomes to be understood as a marker for risk of IPV ex-\nposure, it may be helpful in identifying high-risk girls\nfor targeted intervention efforts.\nFunding/Support: This research uses data from Add\nHealth, a program project designed by J.
