Listeria monocytogenes is among the most virulent foodborne pathogens, with 20% of clinical\ninfections resulting in death. To explore listeriosis-associated mortality in the United States and to evaluate pre-\nvention efforts, we reviewed vital records over a 16-year period to assess demographic, temporal, and seasonal\ntrends.\nMethods. Nonperinatal listeriosis-associated deaths from 1990 through 2005 were identified from multiple-\ncause\u00adcoded death records and were combined with US census data to calculate mortality rates. Poisson regression\nwas used to model time trends, and logistic regression was used to identify comorbid conditions associated with\nlisteriosis on the death record.\nlisteriosis on the death record. Listeriosis-related mortality rates decreased annually by 10.74% from 1990 through\nOctober.

Nonperinatal listeriosis-associated deaths in the United States have decreased, paralleling a de-\ncreasing trend in incidence. Strict monitoring of food manufacturing processes, as well as improved treatment for\nHIV infection, may have played influential roles in preventing human infections. Health care providers should be\naware of seasonal listeriosis patterns, as well as conditions predisposing individuals to severe infection and death\ndue to L. monocytogenes infection, to guide strategies for disease management and prevention.\nFor more than 2 decades, foodborne illness caused by\nListeria monocytogenes has raised significant public\nhealth concern in the United States, Europe, and other\nareas of the world. Each year, there are an estimated\npitalizations and 500 deaths [1]. This pathogen is more\ninvasive than the pathogens associated with most types\nof foodborne illness, and conditions typically associated\nwith Listeria infection include meningitis, encephalitis,\nsepsis, and febrile gastroenteritis [2].

Although there is some indication that the number\nof Listeria\u00adrelated infections are increasing in Germany,\nEngland, and Wales (particularly among the elderly\npopulation) [4, 5], data from the Foodborne Diseases\nActive Surveillance Network (FoodNet) show that the\nnumber of cases in the United States has decreased in\nrecent years [2, 7]. The number of laboratory-con-\nfirmed cases in the United States decreased by 24%\nproved testing and control of ready-to-eat foods for L.\nmonocytogenes contamination, as well as other disease\nprevention efforts [7].\nIn spite of the availability of surveillance data on\ndisease incidence, relatively little is known about lis-\nteriosis cases resulting in death. Information on mor-\ntality within the population is necessary, not only to more fully\nunderstand the burden of disease, but to evaluate the effec-\ntiveness of prevention efforts. Population-based mortality data\nhave been used to investigate other infectious diseases [8, 9],\nbut to our knowledge, these data have not yet been used in\nlisteriosis research. In the present study, we examined vital re-\ncords data to assess demographic, temporal, and seasonal trends\nin mortality due to listeriosis in the United States from 1990\nMETHODS\nDeath records. Multiple-cause-of-death data from US death\ncertificates have been collected, processed, and made available\nfor public use by the National Center for Health Statistics for\ndemographic information for each decedent, including age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity, and place of residence (geographic data un-\navailable for 2005). In addition to designating an underlying\ncause, the physician or coroner filling out the death certificate\nmay list up to 20 conditions that are believed to have contrib-\nuted in some way to the death of the individual. Each of these\nconditions is coded on the basis of the International Classifi-\ncation of Diseases system for the year in which the death oc-\ncurred (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision\ncation of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] for the period 1999\u00ad\nIn our study, cases are defined as US resident deaths having\nan ICD-9 code of 027.0 (\"Listeriosis, Infection by Listeria mono-\ncytogenes, Meningitis by Listeria monocytogenes, Meningoen-\ncephalitis by Listeria monocytogenes, Septicaemia by Listeria\nmonocytogenes; excludes: congenital listeriosis [771.2]\") or an\nA32.0 p cutaneous listeriosis; A32.1 p listerial meningitis and\nother forms of listeriosis; A32.9 p listeriosis, unspecified) listed\nas the underlying, immediate, contributing, or other cause listed\nin the cause of death section of the death record. Perinatal\nlisteriosis cases (in which death occurred from 16 weeks after\nconception through 30 days postpartum) [11] have been ex-\ncluded from our study, because the ICD-9 codes referencing\nconditions that cannot be separated for analysis.\nMortality rates and trends. Mortality rates were calculated\nusing bridged-race population estimates derived from US cen-\nsus data [12, 13] and were subsequently age-adjusted with\nBridged-race estimates of the population are necessary to con-\ntrol for changes in racial categorization across census years. To\nfacilitate a review of temporal trends, we calculated age-adjusted\nmortality rates, cross-tabulated these by year, and then esti-\nmated corresponding temporal patterns using Poisson regres-\nsion models. Mortality rates for race/ethnicity, sex, and geo-\ngraphic region were calculated with aggregated data from all\ngraphic data). Race/ethnicity was divided into 5 categories: non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific\nIslander, and Native American. For our geographic analysis, we\ndivided the 50 states into 4 major regions and 9 subregions\naccording to US census divisions [15].\nComorbidity analysis. Multiple-cause\u00adcoded mortality\ndata facilitate a review of many factors influencing the death\nof an individual. To identify these factors, we searched liste-\nriosis-related deaths for comorbidities frequently noted on the\ndeath certificate and compared these with data from a control\ngroup comprising all non\u00adlisteriosis-associated deaths. Statis-\ntical associations were estimated by creating unconditional lo-\ngistic regression models with listeriosis as the outcome and with\nthe selected comorbidity as the main exposure variable. We\nincluded age, race/ethnicity, and sex in each model to control\nfor their potential confounding effects. HIV as a comorbidity\nwas also tested as a potential confounder in each model. All\ncalculations were performed with SAS, version 9.1 (SAS).\nRESULTS\nDemographic and temporal trends. We identified 1178 lis-\nidents. The overall crude mortality rate associated with\nlisteriosis was 0.27 deaths per 1 million persons annually (95%\nadjustment for age, this rate remained unchanged at 0.27 deaths\n1 million persons annually) (table 1). Although 180% of lis-\nteriosis-related deaths occurred among non-Hispanic whites,\nrace-specific mortality rates, adjusted for age, were similar for\nnon-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and\npersons annually) (table 1). The most common underlying\ncauses of mortality among listeriosis-related deaths included\ndiseases of the heart (59 deaths; 5.0%).\nFigure 1 highlights the overall temporal trends in listeriosis-\nPoisson regression analysis, the data show a yearly decrease in\nadjusted mortality rate, 0.18 deaths per 1 million persons).

Listeria-related mortality varied to\nsome degree across the 4 major geographic regions and 9 sub-\n4 geographic regions, the lowest mortality was found in the\nMidwest, which had a rate of 0.23 deaths per 1 million persons\nannually, whereas the West region had the highest rate (0.33\ndeaths per 1 million persons annually) (table 2). In the Pacific\nsubregion (i.e., California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and\nHawaii), there were 205 deaths, representing 18.3% of Listeria-\nrelated deaths and yielding a mortality rate of 0.36 deaths per\n1 million persons annually. By contrast, there were 49 deaths\nrelated to listeriosis in the West North Central subregion (i.e.,\nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kan-\nsas, and Missouri), representing 4.4% of listeriosis-related\ndeaths and an annual mortality rate of 0.17 deaths per 1 million\npersons.\nDisease associations.

Evidence shows that in-\ncidence rates of sporadic listeriosis in the United States similarly\ndecreased during the years of our study, and there are several\nfactors that may account for this downward trend [7, 16]. A\nzero-tolerance policy, prohibiting the sale of ready-to-eat meats\ncontaminated with L. monocytogenes, was developed in 1987\nTable 2. Listeriosis-related deaths, by geographic region and subregion,\nRegion\nListeriosis-related\ndeaths, no.

This policy has since been modified\nto increase on-site testing of meat and poultry processing plants\n[18, 19]. Results of a multistate case-control study published\nin 1992 prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention to issue recommendations both to assist health care\nproviders in the diagnosis and treatment of disease and to\ncaution individuals who were at high risk against the con-\nsumption of certain foods [20]. Prevention efforts by the food\nindustry included the development of a Hazard Analysis Critical\nControl Points strategy to minimize levels of L. monocytogenes\nat key points of the cooking and packaging processes prior to\nChanges in host factors likely played a role in further re-\nducing Listeria-related mortality during the mid-1990s. The\nfirst protease inhibitor was approved by the Food and Drug\nAdministration in late 1995 [22], and its use in combination\nwith other antiretroviral therapy resulted in dramatic decreases\nin morbidity and mortality among patients with HIV infection\nand/or AIDS [23]. Cases of invasive disease caused by oppor-\ntunistic organisms, such as L. monocytogenes, are now less fre-\nquent among those infected with HIV because of the consid-\nerable immunorestorative effects of this novel treatment [24].\nOur data tend to support this trend, because we observed HIV\ninfection and/or AIDS listed more frequently as a comorbidity\namong individuals with listeriosis-associated deaths from 1990\n(3.4%). Among men, who have a higher rate of HIV infection\nthan women, we also observed a 30% drop in listeriosis-related\nRelatively little has been published on seasonal listeriosis\npatterns in the United States. Although our data show a clear\nincrease in mortality from July through October, the reasons\nfor this are unclear. Using data collected from the FoodNet\nsurveillance system, Voetsch et al. [7] reported that listeriosis\ninfections are more frequent among individuals 50 years of\nage during these same months but that pregnancy-associated\ncases, as well as cases among younger individuals, do not nec-\nessarily follow this same trend. Given that ready-to-eat meats,\nsuch as sliced deli meats and hot dogs, are common vehicles\nof transmission, it is possible that these foods are served more\nfrequently during the summer months (e.g., at picnics or bar-\nbecues, where they may be left unrefrigerated for long periods\nof time prior to consumption).\nOur data also show variation in listeriosis-related mortality\nby geographic region, although the reasons for this are not\nevident. Pathogen exposure levels may vary by region according\nto local dietary preferences and habits. Underlying risk factors\nfor infection may also be more prevalent in certain regional\npopulations, leading to higher numbers of Listeria-related\ndeaths in those areas.\nWe also observed an increase in Listeria-related deaths with\nage (table 1). Although this finding was expected, it has clinical\nrelevance, because of the overall aging trend of the US popu-\nTable 3.

Changes in food industry regulation have led to an\noverall decrease in listeriosis-related mortality, but clinicians\nshould continue to offer dietary recommendations to patients\n55 years of age in an effort to further reduce mortality among\nthis group.\nL. monocytogenes has historically caused more reported in-\nfections among men than among women [2, 25], although the\ngap has narrowed in recent years. Our data show that men and\nwomen experienced similar numbers of deaths, but age-ad-\njusted mortality rates for men were 48% higher than for\nwomen, suggesting that men tend to die from listeriosis at\nyounger ages than women. A retrospective study of Vibrio vul-\nnificus infection in Los Angeles County found that men are less\nlikely than women to follow education measures warning\nagainst the consumption of contaminated foods [26]. Although\ndietary habits tend to differ between the sexes, the disparity in\nmortality may also be an indication of a larger population of\nimmunocompromised men than immunocompromised\nwomen living in the United States. For example, in New York\nCity, Sackoff et al. [27] recently found that men account for\nnearly 70% of persons with AIDS who are 13 years of age.\nImmunocompromised individuals have long been recog-\nnized as a group at high risk for opportunistic infections, such\nas listeriosis [7, 25]. T cell\u00admediated immune responses play\na central role in maintaining the body's defenses against intra-\ncellular pathogenic organisms [28]. Cancer, organ transplan-\ntation, HIV infection, diabetes, renal disease, and liver disease\nhave been recognized as specific conditions that predispose the\ndue to the nature of the diseases themselves, the medications\ncommonly prescribed to treat them, or a combination of the\n2 is not clear and may vary by condition. In the case of chronic\nlymphocytic leukemia, hypogammaglobulinemia results from\nthe cancer itself, whereas common treatment with purine an-\nalogs and monoclonal antibodies leads to T cell immunode-\nficiency, further increasing the risk of developing infection [31].\nThis malignancy comprises an important segment of the lym-\nphoid and hematopoietic cancers, which have a notably strong\nassociation with listeriosis on the death certificate (table 2).\nOur data also suggest disease associations that may not be\nwidely recognized. Connective tissue disease, including systemic\nlupus erythematosus, has previously accompanied listeriosis as\neither a comorbid or preexisting condition in 2 case series and\nhave also been linked to Listeria infection in case studies, al-\nthough a statistical association had not been established prior\nSeveral important limitations are associated with the use of\nmultiple-cause-of-death data that require consideration. Al-\nthough these data are population based and contain large num-\nbers of observations, death certificates may contain errors,\nwhich have been attributed to a variety of factors [37]. Redel-\nings et al. [38] point out that, instead of reporting all prevalent\ndiseases on the death certificate, physicians more commonly\nlist only those that are believed to play an instrumental role in\nthe death of the individual. Therefore, the death certificate of\nan individual who dies of a serious infection, such as listeriosis,\nmay be less likely to list chronic conditions--such as cardio-\nvascular disease, stroke, or hypertension--even if these are pre-\nsent at the time of death.\nA second limitation is the chronological ambiguity of diseases\nlisted on an individual death record [39]. For instance, although\nwe note a strong positive association between HIV infection\nexplicitly indicate which developed first. They merely indicate\nthat both conditions were present at the time of death.\nUnderreporting and misclassification of listeriosis may also\nlimit our study, because some discrepancy exists between es-\ntimates of listeriosis-related deaths from prior studies [1, 7]\nand the number of cases in which listeriosis was recorded on\nthe death certificate . Data from FoodNet have been used to\nestimate that 500 individuals die each year of listeriosis in the\nUnited States [1], yet actual death records include only 127\nnonperinatal Listeria-associated deaths for 1990 and just 55\nsuch deaths for 2005. The exclusion of perinatal Listeria-as-\nsociated deaths in our study accounts for some, but likely not\nall, of this discrepancy. Although it is unclear which data source\nmost closely reflects the true disease burden in the population,\nthe possibility of misclassification error exists in our data. Lis-\nteriosis-associated deaths might be recorded on death certifi-\ncates as \"unspecified septicemia\" (ICD-9 code 038.9 or ICD-\n10 code A41.9) in the absence of laboratory test results positive\nfor L. monocytogenes.\nFinally, mortality rates may be distorted because of errors in\npopulation estimates, particularly for race/ethnicity. Because\nestimates of the at-risk population factor into the denominator\nfor rate calculations, such errors can lead to biased estimates\nof mortality rates.\nBecause of the limitations of multiple-cause-of-death data\nand the potential for error in estimating population size, we\nurge caution in interpreting our results. However, when the\ndirection of incidence trends, the biologic plausibility of as-\nsociations identified, and a general agreement with prior lit-\nerature are considered, these findings likely reflect true patterns\nof listeriosis-associated mortality in the United States. The de-\ncreasing trend in listeriosis-associated mortality over a 16-year\nperiod demonstrates the largely preventable nature of Listeria\ninfection, as well as the success of collaborative efforts by the\nUS Department of Agriculture, US Food and Drug Adminis-\ntration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and food\nindustry in limiting the spread of this opportunistic pathogen.\nChanges in host factors among the population, particularly with\nrespect to HIV infection status and treatment, have played a\nminor (although important) role in influencing listeriosis-as-\nsociated mortality.\nDespite these recent successes, listeriosis remains a cause of\npreventable mortality in the United States. Prevention efforts\nin educating high-risk groups, such as the elderly population\nand those with decreased immune function, should emphasize\nextra caution during the summer and early fall. Health care\nproviders should be aware of conditions that may predispose\nindividuals to developing severe infection and death due to L.\nmonocytogenes and incorporate this knowledge into strategies\nfor disease management.\n"
