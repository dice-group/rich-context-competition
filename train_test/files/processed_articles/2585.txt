Use has also been linked to heroin initiation.\nReliable data on nonmedical opioid use are needed to continue to inform prevention. Objective:\nTo determine the prevalence and correlates of discordant self-report of nonmedical use of opioids\nin a national sample. Methods: Utilizing a nationally representative sample of 31,149 American\nhigh school seniors in the Monitoring the Future study (2009\u00ad2013), discordant responses\nbetween self-reported 12-month nonmedical opioid use and self-reported 12-month nonmedical\nVicodin and OxyContin use (reporting Vicodin/OxyContin use, but not reporting \"opioid\" use)\nwere assessed. We also used multivariable logistic regression to determine the characteristics of\nstudents who were most likely to provide a discordant response. Results: 37.1% of those reporting\nnonmedical Vicodin use and 28.2% of those reporting nonmedical OxyContin use did not report\noverall nonmedical opioid use. Prevalence of nonmedical opioid use (8.3%) would increase when\nfactoring in Vicodin, OxyContin, or both, by 2.8%, 1.3%, and 3.3%, respectively. Females were\nmore likely to provide a discordant response to Vicodin and highly religious students were more\nlikely to provide a discordant response regarding OxyContin use. Those who reported cocaine or\nnonmedical tranquilizer use were at consistently low odds for discordant responses. Nonmedical\namphetamine users were at low odds for providing a discordant Vicodin response. Conclusion:\nPrevalence of nonmedical opioid use may be underreported on some surveys, particularly among\nspecific subpopulations. Further research on the effect of question order and skip-patterns (e.g.,\n\"gate\" questions) is needed. Reliable data on nonmedical opioid use are needed to continue to\naccurately inform prevention.\n",

Everyday, an\nestimated 1,300 adolescents initiated nonmedical\nopioid use for the first time in 2014, with an average\nage of initiation of 21.6 years (2). The US experienced a\n183% increase in emergency department visits related\nan 8% increase in opioid related admissions to sub-\n(4), and increases in opioid-related overdose deaths\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioids are\nassociated with nearly 75% of prescription medication\noverdoses in the US (6). In addition, frequent\nnonmedical opioid use is associated with increased\nrisk for heroin initiation (7).\nAmong prescription opioids commonly used in a\nnonmedical manner, Vicodin (hydrocodone plus acet-\naminophen) and OxyContin (oxycodone) are of parti-\ncular concern, considering the high frequency with\nwhich they are prescribed and used. According to the\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH),\nVicodin appears to be the most prevalent opioid used\nin a nonmedical manner in the US, used by an esti-\nnonmedical OxyContin use is less prevalent (used by an\npared to Vicodin and other opioid formulations such as\nPercoset (8), nonmedical OxyContin use is particularly\nprevalent among opioid dependent individuals (9\u00ad11).\nOxyContin is known for its high potency (12,13)\nalthough its abuse appears to have been somewhat\nCONTACT Joseph J.

Considering the popularity\nand potential dangers associated with use of specific\nprescription opioids such as Vicodin and OxyContin,\nit is essential to assess the accuracy of reporting non-\nmedical opioid use generally as compared to reporting\nuse of specific types of opioid drugs. The self-report of\nillicit drug use compared to urinalysis typically pro-\nduces good validity findings (15\u00ad19); however, specific\nprescription opioids used in a nonmedical manner\n(e.g., Vicodin, OxyContin) may be viewed differently\nby users as they are commonly prescribed (e.g., gov-\nernment approved, pharmaceutical grade pills) and\nthus different from other \"street\" drugs.\nFurthermore, underreporting of nonmedical opioid\nuse has been found to be common in some popula-\ntions (e.g., among pregnant women, those who are\ndependent, veterans, adolescents) (20\u00ad25), but under-\nreporting may also be due, in part, to confusion\nregarding which drugs are opioids, or in regard to\nmedical versus nonmedical/recreational use. A study\nassessing validity of using a self-report questionnaire\ncompared to self-report via identification of specific\nopioids from color photographs found that validity\nwas higher for OxyContin, but lower for generic\nrespectively) when compared to some other opioids,\nsuch as methadone wafers/disks, methadone tablets, or\nDilaudid (9), suggesting that reporting of the use of\nindividual types of opioids may not always be reliable.\nOf concern is that most data on validity of drug use\nself-report have been conducted in groups of indivi-\nduals in drug treatment programs, rather than in gen-\neral population samples. A study on the validity of drug\nuse self-reports in MTF found that lifetime use of most\nillicit drugs remained consistent in the sample even\nafter re-query of respondents on seven different occa-\nsions, indicating validity of drug use self-report (26).\nHowever, consistency in responses was lower for psy-\nchotherapeutic (prescription) drugs, although this\nstudy did not specifically examine validity for opioid\nuse (26). The authors suggest that discordance of\nreporting of psychotherapeutic drugs may be due to\nambiguity in drug definitions (e.g., a student may\nhave difficulty categorizing Xanax as a benzodiazepine).\nA major limitation of paper and pencil surveys such as\nMTF (27) is that complex branching of questions (or\n\"skip patterns\") are often too difficult to utilize as they\nmay confuse the participant (28), and thus all students\nare asked every question, regardless of previous\nresponses to the use of specific types of drugs.\nIn this analysis, we seek to describe differences in\nself-reporting of nonmedical opioid use among high\nschool seniors assessed in the annual MTF survey,\nwho were asked about both general nonmedical opioid\nuse and also specifically about nonmedical Vicodin and\nOxyContin use. We examine and compare prevalence\nof self-reported nonmedical opioid use overall with\nprevalence of self-reported nonmedical use of Vicodin\nand OxyContin--questions that are asked of all stu-\ndents regardless of responses to the general nonmedical\nopioid use questions. As nonmedical opioid use has\nbecome a major public health issue in the US, results\nwill help determine whether students may be under- or\nover-reporting use of specific opioids, potentially due to\nconfusion regarding definitions.\nMethods\nProcedure\nMTF is a nationally representative cross-sectional study\ngraders (high school seniors) are surveyed every year\nfrom approximately 130 public and private schools\nthroughout the 48 coterminous states. A multi-stage\nrandom sampling procedure is utilized: geographic\nareas are first selected, then schools within areas are\nselected, and then classes within schools are selected.\nSince two of the main variables of interest (nonmedical\nVicodin and OxyContin use; discussed below) were\nonly assessed in half of the sample (via three out of\nsix survey forms), in order to have adequate power, this\nanalysis focused on aggregated data collected from the\nfive most recent cohorts with available data (2009\u00ad\n2013). MTF protocols were approved by the\nUniversity of Michigan Institutional Review Board\n(IRB) and the authors' IRB deemed this secondary\ndata analysis exempt from review.\nDrug use\nBefore students were asked about last-year (12-month)\nnonmedical use of opioids, the survey explained that,\n\"There are a number of narcotics other than heroin,\nsuch as methadone, opium, morphine, codeine, Demerol,\nVicodin, OxyContin, and Percocet. These are sometimes\nprescribed by doctors.\" They were then asked, \"On how\nmany occasions (if any) have you taken narcotics other\nthan heroin on your own--that is, without a doctor tell-\ning you to take them--during the last 12 months?\"\nAnswer options were used on 1) 0 occasions, 2) 1\u00ad2\nsions. Later on in the survey, students were asked addi-\ntional questions about 12-month nonmedical Vicodin\nand OxyContin use, and all students were asked, regard-\nless of their response to the first opioid item. Specifically,\nstudents were asked, \"During the last 12 months, on how\nmany occasions (if any) have you taken Vicodin (without\na doctor's orders)?\" and in a separate question they were\ngiven the same item, but with regard to \"OxyContin\n(without a doctor's orders).\" We dichotomized each of\nthe three items into 12-month use: yes/no, and created\nvariables indicating whether there was discordance in\nreporting (e.g., a discordance by which they reported\nVicodin use, but not opioids). We could not examine\nlifetime use as MTF did not ask about lifetime Vicodin or\nOxyContin use. However, we did consider lifetime use of\nother drugs assessed as covariates: alcohol, marijuana\n(cannabis), cocaine, and nonmedical use of amphetamine\nand tranquilizers.\nSociodemographic variables\nStudents were asked their sex, age (predefined by\nMTF as <18, 18 years), and race/ethnicity (i.e.,\nblack, white, Hispanic). Level of religiosity was\nassessed via two ordinal items which asked about\nthe level of religious attendance and importance. A\ncomposite was computed and divided into tertiles to\n(3.5\u00ad4.0) religiosity. Students were also asked how\nmany nights they typically go out per week for fun\n4\u00ad7. Coding and justification of the entry of variables\nwere based on previous MTF analyses as these cov-\nariates are commonly related to the use of various\nThus, we examined common correlates from MTF\nthat may allow us to delineate discordant responses\nand we hypothesized that those at higher risk for\nother drug use would be less likely to provide a\ndiscordant response due to possible experience, expo-\nsure, or knowledge of drugs.\nAnalyses\nAnalyses focused on students with complete opioid use\ndata (weighted N = 31,149). We first examined descrip-\ntive statistics for all variables. Next, we produced cross-\ntabulations to examine self-reported nonmedical use of\nVicodin and OxyContin by self-reported nonmedical\nuse of opioids as a general category. Among students\nreporting nonmedical use of Vicodin/OxyContin, we\ncomputed the prevalence of not reporting nonmedical\nuse of opioids in general, overall and by each covariate\naforementioned. Logistic regression models were also\nused to generate unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and\nadjusted ORs (AORs) for each covariate to determine\nwhich students were most likely to report discordant\nresponses (e.g., reported Vicodin use but not opioid use\nas the outcome variable as per the variable indicating\nwhether or not the response was discordant). For unad-\njusted (bivariable) analyses, we implemented a\nBonferroni statistical correction to account for multiple\nbased for survey data (32) and sample weights were\nincluded in all analyses. SAS 9.3 software (SAS\nInstitute, 2011) was used for all analyses.\nResults\nSample characteristics and self-reported drug use are\npresented in Table 1. With regard to recent (12-month)\nnonmedical opioid use, 8.3% reported any use; 7.6%\nreported nonmedical Vicodin use and 4.4% reported\nnonmedical OxyContin use. Most students who did not\nreport nonmedical use of opioids also did not report\nnonmedical use of Vicodin (96.9%) and OxyContin\n(98.6%). As shown in Table 2, among those reporting\nnonmedical Vicodin use, 37.1% did not report nonme-\ndical use of opioids in general and among those report-\ning nonmedical use of OxyContin, 28.2% did not report\nnonmedical opioid use in general (relative percentages).\nWith regard to absolute percentages, the estimated\nprevalence of nonmedical opioid use if we include dis-\ncordant reports of Vicodin use would increase from\nlute difference when including Vicodin]). Including\nOxyContin would increase the estimate from 8.3% to\nwhen including OxyContin]). Including discordant\nresponses to both Vicodin and OxyContin would\nincrease the estimated prevalence from 8.3% to 11.6%\nwhen including Vicodin and OxyContin]).\nWe then examined whether demographic characteris-\ntics and drug use were related to reporting nonmedical\nuse of Vicodin or OxyContin, but not reporting general\nnonmedical opioid use (discordant reporting). As shown\nin Table 3, females were more likely to report a discor-\nCompared to white students, black and Hispanic students\nwere at high odds for reporting Vicodin use without\ncontrolling for other covariates, but these associations\nwere no longer significant upon controlling for all other\ncovariates. Likewise, religious students were more likely\nto report the use of Vicodin, but not general opioid use,\nbut significance was lost when controlling for all other\ncovariates. Students who said they go out for fun 4\u00ad7\nnights per week (compared to those who said they go\nout 0\u00ad1 nights per week for fun) were at reduced odds for\nreporting use of Vicodin, but not general opioid use, but\nthis, too, lost significance when controlling for all other\ncovariates. Alcohol and marijuana use were associated\nwith decreased odds of reporting this discordance and\nsignificance was lost when controlling for all other cov-\nariates; however, cocaine use, and nonmedical use of\namphetamine and tranquilizers were all consistently and\nrobustly associated with decreased odds of reporting this\ndiscordance with regard to Vicodin.\nWith regard to students reporting OxyContin use, but\nnot use of opioids (Table 4), compared to white students,\nblack and Hispanic students were at increased odds for\nreporting the OxyContin discordance, but the signifi-\ncance disappeared when controlling for all other vari-\nables. Moderate religiosity and high religiosity were\nassociated with high odds for reporting this discordance\nalthough the strength of associations weakened when\ncontrolling for all other covariates. Going out 4\u00ad7 nights\nper week for fun was also significant until controlling for\nall other variables. Alcohol use and nonmedical amphe-\ntamine use were associated with decreased odds for use\nuntil controlling for all other covariates. Marijuana use,\ncocaine use, and nonmedical tranquilizer use were con-\nsistently and robustly associated with decreased odds of\nreporting this discordance.\nDiscussion\nSince nonmedical opioid users in the US take specific\ndrugs such as Vicodin or OxyContin, it is essential that\nsurvey-takers and tools designed to assess the prevalence\nof opioid use do not misclassify use of specific drugs with\nregard to this drug category. Accurate prevalence of use is\nneeded to inform prevention, as underestimation of pre-\nvalence may lead to less public health concern.

This suggests that the prevalence of self-reported\nnonmedical opioid use (as a general drug category) is\nbeing underestimated (by up to 3.3%). Our analyses of\nthe characteristics of students who provided discordant\nresponses may give some insights into why these indivi-\nduals reported nonmedical use of specific opioids, but not\nof nonmedical use of opioids in general.\nBlack and Hispanic students were both more likely\nto provide discordant responses than white students in\nbivariable models, but not in multivariable models.\nThis adds to earlier findings by Johnston and\nO'Malley (26), who found racial and ethnic minorities,\nand in particular African\u00adAmerican students, were\nmore likely to provide discordant reports of drug use\nin an MTF validation study. Similarly, a reliability study\nof the NSDUH found that white individuals were more\nlikely to consistently report substance use (33). In gen-\neral, whites reportedly use opioids nonmedically more\nfrequently than other racial/ethnic subgroups (34),\nwhites are more likely to be prescribed opioid drugs\nfor pain than other racial/ethnic groups (35), and they\nare also more likely to \"doctor shop\" for pills (36).\nThus, white students may in fact be more familiar\nwith and/or knowledgeable about specific types of\nopioid drugs such as Vicodin and OxyContin, and\ntherefore less likely to provide discordant responses.\nHowever, we found that confounding factors such as\nother drug use appear to weaken such significant\nassociations.\nReligiosity was also associated with increased odds of\ndiscordant reporting. Religiosity has previously been\nshown to be associated with decreased risk of drug\nas well as increased disapproval and stigma toward\ndrug users (40,41). It may be that individuals who are\nboth highly religious and have used are thus less likely\nto accurately self-report drug use due to fear of disap-\nproval, or perhaps they are more likely to lack the\nknowledge that these controlled pills can in fact be\nTable 3.

We hypothesize\ntwo pathways to explain this finding: 1) individuals who\nuse licit and illicit drugs may perceive less social disap-\nproval of drug use, and therefore be less subject to\nreporting bias; and moreover, 2) individuals who use\nlicit and/or illicit drugs may be more knowledgeable\nabout drugs and drug classes and therefore less subject\nto information bias. Previous studies have shown indi-\nviduals who use drugs perceive less disapproval in regard\nto use of that drug (40,42), and toward use of other\n\"hard\" drugs (39), and therefore these individuals may\nbe likely to self-report drug use more accurately because\nof less perception of disapproval. Furthermore, indivi-\nduals who report use of other licit and illicit drugs may\nbe more knowledgeable about drugs (43,44), and there-\nfore be less likely to report discordance due to\ninformation bias. In addition, self-reported use of other\npsychoactive drugs which are legal when used as pre-\nscribed--amphetamine (e.g., Adderall) and tranquilizers\n(e.g., Xanax, Valium)--were consistent and robust pre-\ndictors of not providing a discordant response. It may be\nthat students who use amphetamines and/or tranquili-\nzers in a nonmedical manner are more familiar with\nand/or knowledgeable about pills they use in other cate-\ngories such as opioids.\nAnother factor previously shown to be associated\nwith discordant drug use reporting is the initiation of\nopioid use for pain management (21). Individuals who\nstarted using opioids to treat pain may be more familiar\nwith drug names, and may be more likely to report the\nuse of specific drugs, while not reporting the use of\nopioids generally; however, research is needed to con-\nfirm this. One study found that over a third (36.9%) of\nadolescents access opioids through their own leftover\nprescriptions, and these individuals primarily use such\ndrugs to reduce physical pain (45). While many ado-\nlescents are familiar with opioid use via their own\nprescriptions, a substantial percentage of the adolescent\npopulation may be underreporting opioid use.\nTable 4.

OR = odds ratio, AOR = adjusted odds ratio, CI = confidence interval.\nAlthough many surveys today are electronic and ask\nfollow-up questions via skip-patterns and piping meth-\nodology, results from MTF (which is administered via\npaper and pencil) provided us with a unique opportunity\nto examine concordant versus discordant responses.\nWhile discordant responses are in fact problematic, elec-\ntronic surveys generally do not allow discordant\nresponses. For example, respondents may be asked a\n\"gate\" question about nonmedical use of specific opioids.\nIf the individual responds that no opioid was used in a\nnonmedical manner, then they are taken to questions\nabout a different drug, with no opportunity to later\nprovide a discordant (but accurate) response. Likewise,\nif a respondent accidentally checks off \"no\" to a group of\ndrugs earlier on (even though all drugs of interest were\nlisted), the opportunity is then lost for further questions\nrelated to those listed drugs. NSDUH (8) respondents\nare asked \"gate\" questions about nonmedical use of\nspecific opioids; however, they are also shown a card\ndepicting photographs of different opioid pills and lists\nof opioid names to help them identify opioids they have\nused nonmedically. The card depicts and/or lists 21\ndifferent opioids including Vicodin, Percoset, and\nOxyContin. However, few electronic surveys depict\nphotographs of specific drugs. While branching, piping,\nand skip patterns are beneficial with regard to electronic\nsurveys, research is needed to determine whether such\ntechnology may lead to underreporting.\nLimitations\nMTF was not able to assess those who dropped out of high\nschool and this can affect the generalizability of findings.\nPublic MTF data are cross-sectional, so we were unable to\nexamine patterns of self-report over time. While MTF asks\nabout lifetime, 12-month and 30-day nonmedical use of\nopioids, it only asks about 12-month nonmedical use of\nVicodin and OxyContin, so analyses had to be limited to\nlast-year use. MTF also only asks about Vicodin and\nOxyContin via three (of six) survey forms, so we could\nonly examine data for half of the national sample. We also\nhad no way to determine whether discordant self-reported\nuse of Vicodin or OxyContin was due to reporting errors.\nWhile adding more specific questions to a survey may\nlikely result in better data, surveys were not complemented\nwith interviews or biological testing.\nMissing data were also an issue. Of those with miss-\ning data for the overall nonmedical opioid use variable\n(1.6% of those with opioid data) that had to be omitted\nfrom analyses. Of those with missing data for the over-\nOxyContin data (1.6% of those with opioid data).\nWhile percentages of missing data were relatively\nsmall, we discovered a systematic difference in preva-\nlence when comparing the prevalence of Vicodin and\nOxyContin use according to who also had general\nnonmedical opioid use data (the analytic sample) and\nwho did not have data for all three opioid variables\n(excluded from analyses). Specifically, those excluded\ndue to missing opioid data reported significantly higher\nTherefore, an important bias appears to have been dis-\ncovered in which many students who reported the use of\nVicodin or OxyContin were likely to skip the earlier\nquestion about overall nonmedical opioid use. We also\nfound significantly different levels of missingness for\nVicodin and OxyContin across survey forms (p <\n0.001) (but not general nonmedical opioid use); how-\never, patterns of missingness are similar (across forms)\nfor self-reported 12-month use of other drugs assessed\nby MTF along with Vicodin and OxyContin: cough\nmedicines, synthetic cannabinoids, ketamine, andro,\ncreatine, Ritalin, and Adderall (all ps < 0.001).\nConclusions\nIn this analysis of a nationally representative sample of\nAmerican high school seniors, we found discordance in\nreporting of nonmedical opioid use by a specific type of\nopioid (i.e., Vicodin, OxyContin) and general nonmedi-\ncal use of opioids. These findings suggest that the overall\nestimates of opioid use may be underestimated in some\nstudies, and future tests of validity may be required to\nensure that respondents recognize and provide appro-\npriate responses for use of the drugs assessed.\n"
