    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe term \"palliative care\" has a negative connotation and may act as a barrier to early patient referrals. Rebranding has thus\nbeen proposed as a strategy to reduce the negative perceptions associated with palliative care. For example, using the term\n\"supportive care\" instead of \"palliative care\" in naming palliative care units has been proposed in several studies. In Taiwan,\nterms other than \"palliative\" and \"hospice\" are already widely used in the names of palliative care units. With this in mind,\nthis study investigated the characteristics of palliative care unit names in order to better understand the role of naming in\npalliative care. Relevant data were collected from the Taiwan Academy of Hospice Palliative Medicine, the National Health\nInsurance Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the open database maintained by the government of\nTaiwan. We found a clear phenomenon of avoiding use of the terms \"palliative\" and \"hospice\" in the naming of palliative\ncare units, a phenomenon that reflects the stigma attached to the terms \"palliative\" and \"hospice\" in Taiwan. At the time of\nthe study (September, 2016), there were 55 palliative care units in Taiwan. Only 20.0% (n = 11) of the palliative care unit\nnames included the term \"palliative,\" while 25.2% (n = 14) included the term \"hospice.\" Religiously affiliated hospitals were\nless likely to use the terms \"palliative\" and \"hospice\" (2 = 11.461, P = .001). There was also a lower prevalence of use of\nthe terms \"palliative\" and \"hospice\" for naming palliative care units in private hospitals than in public hospitals (2 = 4.61, P =\n.032). This finding highlights the strong stigma attached to the terms \"palliative\" and \"hospice\" in Taiwan. It is hypothesized\nthat sociocultural and religious factors may partially account for this phenomenon.\n",

The National Health\nInsurance (NHI) program reimburses the cost to service pro-\nviders of home care, outpatient services, inpatient care, and\nshared care, a service for patients in nonhospice wards. The\nNHI program was established in 1995 to provide health care\nto all residents in Taiwan. Currently, 99.9% of Taiwan's pop-\nulation is covered by the NHI program. It is a government-\nadministered insurance-based national health care system.\n141 inpatient consultation teams, 93 home care teams, and\n155 community service teams in Taiwan.20 In Taiwan, pallia-\ntive care is defined as specialized medical care that focuses\non providing patients relief from pain and other distressing\nsymptoms of a serious illness, regardless of the diagnosis or\nstage of disease. The palliative care units defined in this\nstudy are palliative care wards in hospitals. Actually, all the\npalliative care units in Taiwan are hospital-based inpatient\nunits. Hospice care is difference from palliative care. Hospice\ncare focuses on supportive care to people in the final phase of\na terminal illness. In Taiwan, there are no residential facili-\nties to provide hospice care. Hospice care is provided in the\nsettings of hospital-based inpatient care, outpatient services,\nand home care. Although inpatient palliative care services in\ntive care\" itself is not commonly used in palliative care units.\nThis study is the first to examine the naming patterns of pal-\nliative care units from a nationwide prospective. In this\nstudy, nationwide data on palliative care units in Taiwan\nwere collected and analyzed to examine (1) the naming pat-\ntern used in the naming of palliative care units; (2) the asso-\nciations, if any, between the names of palliative care units,\nthe numbers of beds, the levels of medical facilities, and the\npopulation sizes and degrees of urbanization in the areas\nserved by different units; and (3) the common themes for\nnaming palliative care units.\nMaterial and Methods\nData Collection\nThe nationwide data were collected from the Taiwan\nAcademy of Hospice Palliative Medicine, the National\nHealth Insurance Administration of the Ministry of Health\nand Welfare, and the open database maintained by the gov-\nernment of Taiwan (http://data.gov.tw/). The services pro-\nvided by the palliative care units in Taiwan are covered by\nthe National Health Insurance. Therefore, the database from\nthe National Health InsuranceAdministration of the Ministry\nof Health and Welfare included all the information of pallia-\ntive care units in Taiwan. These data included the names of\npalliative care units, and the variables analyzed included the\nlevel of medical facilities, the number of beds in each pallia-\ntive care unit, and the degree of urbanization and the popula-\ntionoftheareaservedbyeachunit.Thedegreeofurbanization\nwas defined using the categorizing methods of Liu et al,\nwhich divide the degree of urbanization into 7 types, namely,\nhighly urbanized towns, medium urbanized towns, emerging\ntowns, general towns and cities, aging towns, agricultural\ntowns, and remote towns.21\nStatistical Analysis\nThe data were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS\nversion 22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York). The samples\nwere separated into 3 groups (with 2 groups made up of unit\nnames that included either \"hospice\" or \"palliative,\" and a\nthird group made up of unit names that included neither of\nthose 2 terms). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize\nthe names of the palliative care units, the level of medical\nfacilities, the number of beds in each palliative care unit, and\nthe degree of urbanization and the population of the area\nserved by each unit. An analysis of variance F test was con-\nducted to compare the number of beds in each unit and the\npopulation served by each unit for the 3 aforementioned\ngroups. A chi-square test of independence was performed to\ncompare the level of medical facilities for the 3 groups. A\nFisher's exact test was used to evaluate only the highly\nurbanized towns and medium urbanized towns against the\ntype of name, because of the small numbers of palliative care\nunits in emerging towns, general towns and cities, aging\ntowns, agricultural towns, remote towns, and outlying\nislands. A P value < .05 (2-tailed) was considered statisti-\ncally significant.\nQualitative Analysis\nThe first part of the analysis consisted of enumerating the\nwords used in the different units' names. Second, using the\napproach of thematic analysis, the words were grouped in\nterms of their denotative and connotative meanings to cap-\nture the key themes. Denotative meanings are what a word\nliterally refers to, and connotative meanings are the associa-\ntions, values, and judgments that surround this.22 The fre-\nquencies of occurrence for each category were calculated to\nderive the dominant concepts. This study was approved by\nthe institutional review board of Taipei Veterans General\nHospital according to Republic of China law.\nResults\nCharacteristics of Study Samples\npalliative care units in Taiwan. Among the hospitals having\n(n = 34) were private. Religiously affiliated hospitals\nDai et al 3\naccounted for 27.3% (n = 15) of all the hospitals, including 4\nBuddhist hospitals, 5 Catholic hospitals, and 6 Christian hos-\npitals. The basic characteristics of the palliative care units are\nsummarized in Table 1. Only 20.0% (n = 11) of the palliative\ncare unit names included the term \"palliative,\" while 25.2%\n(n = 14) included the term \"hospice.\" One palliative care unit\nused both \"palliative\" and \"hospice\" in its name. It is noted\nthat although the term \"hospice\" is used, the units with \"hos-\npice\" in their names are actually palliative care wards.\nFinally, neither \"palliative\" nor \"hospice\" was used in more\nthan half of the palliative care unit names (56.4%, n = 31).\nBivariate Correlations\nTable 1 shows the bivariate analyses of the level of medical\nfacilities, the number of beds in each palliative care unit, the\ndegree of urbanization, and the population size, along with\npossible associates. A tendency toward avoiding the terms\n\"palliative\" and \"hospice\" was found in religiously affiliated\nprevalence of use of the terms \"palliative\" and \"hospice\" for\nnaming palliative care units in private hospitals than in pub-\nmedical facilities, the numbers of beds in the palliative care\nunits, the population sizes, and the urbanization levels, there\nwas no statistically significant association with use of the\nterm \"palliative\" or \"hospice\" in palliative care unit names.\nQualitative Analysis of Clinic Names\nAmong the palliative care units that did not use \"palliative\" or\n\"hospice\" in their names, 22.6% (n = 7) used people's names\nin their names, for example, \"Saint Francis home.\"Apart from\npeople's names, Table 2 lists the frequency with which certain\nwords occurred in those unit names not including the terms\n\"palliative\" or \"hospice.\" The most frequently occurring word\nwas  (xin), which means \"mind\" or \"heart\" in Chinese. The\nsecond most frequently occurring words were  (ai), mean-\ning \"love,\" and (lian), meaning \"lotus.\" The third most fre-\nquently occurring words were  (sheng), meaning \"saint\"; \n(en), meaning \"grace\";  (ning), meaning \"peace\"; and \n(de), meaning \"virtue.\" Three themes were identified from the\nTable 1.

The first theme, which we have called kindness and\nlove, accounted for 6 occurrences. The second theme was\ndescribed as religion and accounted for 5 occurrences. The\nthird theme was peace and accounted for 4 occurrences.\nDiscussion\nThis study is the first systematic analysis of nationwide data\nregarding the naming of palliative care units. In this study, we\nfound that the terms \"palliative\" and \"hospice\" tend to be\navoided in naming palliative care units. Instead, words reflect-\ning the themes of \"kindness and love,\" \"peace,\" and \"religion\"\nwere frequently used. This finding suggests the hypothesis\nthat less stigmatizing names were used to generate more posi-\ntive impressions, higher perceived need, and more referrals.\nThe stigma attached to palliative care is known to be asso-\nciated with death, hopelessness, dependency, and end-of-life\ncare.12-14 Erving Goffman, a sociologist, defined stigma in\nterms of undesirable and deeply discrediting attributes that\ndisqualify one from full social acceptance and motivate\nefforts by the stigmatized individual to hide the mark when\npossible.23 Link and Phelan proposed that stigma exists when\nelements of labeling, stereotyping, separating, status loss, and\ndiscrimination co-occur in a power situation that allows these\nprocesses to unfold.24 Previous studies suggested that the\nterm \"palliative care\" evoked more negative perceptions in\nphysicians, patients, and their caregivers, compared with the\nterm \"supportive care.\" It is associated with death, hopeless-\nness, dependency, and end-of-life care for inpatients.13,14\nPrior research suggests that stereotypical images of palliative\ncare among patients and their caregivers were derived in large\npart from their interactions with the medical system, with\npatients stating that their health care providers delayed refer-\nral to palliative care and equated it with end-of-life care.14,15\nMany oncologists delay referral to palliative care until all\ndisease-modifying treatments have been exhausted.8-11\nOncologists are gatekeepers of palliative care referral and,\ntherefore, are of paramount importance in improving the inte-\ngration of palliative care services. The decision to refer to pal-\nliative care is a highly complex process, and assessing the\ntiming of referral is not straightforward.25,26 It depends on\nnational and regional health care policies, local resources, the\ncomprehensiveness of the palliative care teams, patient char-\nacteristics, and the level of palliative care provided by pri-\nmary care teams.27 There are various factors that can impede\nthe referral process. Negative attitudes toward palliative care\nare one of the most frequently cited barriers to palliative care\naccess.28 In this study, the finding of avoiding use of the terms\n\"palliative\" and \"hospice\" in the naming of palliative care\nunits reflected the negative attitudes toward palliative care\nand hospice. Rebranding palliative care has been proposed as\na strategy to reduce the negative perceptions associated with\npalliative care.16-19 The finding of this study suggests the\nhypothesis that words other than \"palliative\" or \"hospice\" are\nused might be to reduce the negative perceptions of palliative\ncare and enhance patients' acceptance of admission to these\nunits or of oncologists' referral of patients to these units. This\nfinding also suggests several possible directions for future\nresearch, such as research into the degree of patients' under-\nstanding of the informed consent process when they are being\nadmitted to palliative care units. In this study, avoiding use of\nthe terms \"palliative\" and \"hospice\" reflects the stigma asso-\nciated with palliative care, which relates to a larger societal\nattitude toward death.29 In a cross-cultural study, 70% of the\nTable 2.

Prior\nresearch showed that culture and religious beliefs affect one's\nperception of palliative care and the decision making that\noccurs at end of life.34-36 However, future research is needed\nto further understand the role of religious beliefs in attitudes\ntoward palliative care in Taiwan.\nThis study has several limitations. First, while we found\nthe phenomenon of avoiding use of the terms \"palliative\"\nand \"hospice\" in the naming of palliative care units, the\ndeterminants of choosing names for palliative care units are\nstill unclear. The choice of names may rest with stakeholders\nother than oncologists and palliative care providers (eg, key\nadministrators, funders). Second, this study only shows that\nthe terms \"palliative\" and \"hospice\" are avoided in the names\nof palliative care units, but it is not able to directly reflect the\nperceptions of patients and palliative care providers. Third,\nthe study was conducted in Taiwan. The findings in this\nstudy thus may not generalize to other countries with differ-\nent cultures and languages. Finally, the effects of palliative\ncare unit naming on perceived stigma and perceived service\nneed among patients were not clarified due to a lack of\nrelated data. Further study is thus needed to further evaluate\nthe effects of palliative care unit names on attitudes toward\npalliative care among both physicians and patients.\nConclusion\nThe findings of this study offer novel insights into our under-\nstanding of the stigmatization and elements of labeling\nassociated with palliative care. There is a strong stigma\nattached to the terms \"palliative\" and \"hospice\" in Taiwan.\nThe tendency toward avoiding use of the terms \"palliative\"\nand \"hospice\" in the names of palliative care units is espe-\ncially significant among private hospitals and religiously\naffiliated hospitals. Sociocultural and religious factors are\nhypothesized to partially account for this phenomenon.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1.
