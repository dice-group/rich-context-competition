    "abstract": "Abstract: Following two decades of research on non-human animals, there has recently\nbeen increased interest in human nonindependent mate choice, namely the ways in which\nchoosing women incorporate information about a man's past or present romantic partners\n(`model females') into their own assessment of the male. Experimental studies using static\nfacial images have generally found that men receive higher desirability ratings from female\nraters when presented with attractive (compared to unattractive) model females. This\nphenomenon has a straightforward evolutionary explanation: the fact that female mate\nvalue is more dependent on physical attractiveness compared to male mate value.\nFurthermore, due to assortative mating for attractiveness, men who are paired with\nattractive women are more likely to be of high mate value themselves. Here, we also\nexamine the possible relevance of model female cues other than attractiveness (personality\nand behavioral traits) by presenting video recordings of model females to a set of female\nraters. The results confirm that the model female's attractiveness is the primary cue.\nContrary to some earlier findings in the human and nonhuman literature, we found no\nevidence that female raters prefer partners of slightly older model females. We conclude by\nsuggesting some promising variations on the present experimental design.\n",

For example, the fact that a male is accepted by other females (so-called\n`model females') should suggest to an observing female that he is of high quality and could\nlead her to upwardly adjust her own assessment of the male, whereas the opposite should\nbe the case when a male is rejected by model females--a widespread phenomenon known\nHuman nonindependent mate choice\nas mate choice copying (Dugatkin, 1992; Pruett-Jones, 1992). The copying strategy is\ncaptured in the cognitive algorithm `increase your attraction towards males that are mating\nwith other females relative to single males'. This phenomenon has now been studied in a\nvariety of promiscuous and polygynous species, mostly fish and birds (reviews in\nthere may exist some form of homosexual nonindependent mate choice, no research to date\nhas addressed this issue, and in this paper we will be dealing exclusively with heterosexual\nmate choice.\nIn humans, the experimental study of nonindependent mate choice has followed a\nsomewhat different trajectory. Some early studies were more or less direct applications of\nmate choice copying (i.e., presenting some males as being in a relationship and others as\nbeing single, and examining whether female raters found coupled or married males to be\nmore attractive) (Eva and Wood, 2006; Milonoff, Nummi, Nummi, and Pienmunne, 2007;\nUller and Johansson, 2003). The results of these initial studies were mixed; one study\nfound that female raters perceive partnered men as more attractive (Eva and Wood, 2006)\nwhile others did not find this effect (Milonoff et al, 2007; Uller and Johansson, 2003). It is\ninteresting to note that Uller and Johansson (2003) found that married men were actually\nperceived by female raters as significantly less attractive than single men (Milonoff et al.\n2007, found no difference between the two conditions). More recent studies have presented\nall male stimuli as partnered (i.e., no single males, all males have one mate), and focused\non the relative attractiveness of men's supposed partners (Little, Burriss, Jones, DeBruine,\n2010). The consistent finding to emerge from these within-stimulus studies is that when\nmen are presented with attractive partners, they receive higher desirability (e.g.,\nattractiveness, interest in short and long-term relationship) ratings compared to when they\nare presented with unattractive partners. Various authors have suggested that this effect is\ndue to the greater contribution physical attractiveness makes to female as compared to male\nmate value, which, coupled with assortative mating in terms of mate value, allows\nobserving females to greatly improve their assessment of a man's mate value simply by\nlooking at his mate (see mate quality bias theory in Vakirtzis and Roberts, 2009; 2010b; see\nalso Waynforth, 2007). Aside from model female attractiveness, another possible cue to\nwhich focal females might be sensitive is the model female's age. Several studies on non-\nhuman species have found that focal females prefer the partners of slightly older model\nfemales, presumably because the latter are more experienced and can better discern higher\nquality males (Dugatkin and Godin, 1993; Amlacher and Dugatkin, 2005; Vukomanovic\nand Rodd, 2007). In line with these studies, one human study found that women raters\nprefer men that are paired to slightly older model females (in their early to mid twenties;\nThe aforementioned research has relied mostly on static (usually facial) images of\nmodel females and their supposed partners. While these static images suffice to convey\nstructural information relating to model female attractiveness or age, they do not include\ndynamic cues that may more reliably pertain to personality and behavioral traits of the\nmodel females (Rubenstein, 2005; but see Roberts, Saxton, Murray, Burriss, Rowland and\nLittle, 2009). But what personality dimensions of the model females might be relevant in\nHuman nonindependent mate choice\nrelation to nonindependent mate choice? The first and most obvious candidate is self-\nesteem, whose adaptive function based on input received from the `mate-value sociometer'\nhas now been studied extensively (reviewed in Penke, Todd, Lenton, and Fasolo, 2007).\nBriefly, cues of acceptance or rejection from men lead to adaptive shifts in self-esteem\nwhich cause women to raise or lower their ambitions with regard to a mate, and,\npresumably, adjust their romantic pursuits accordingly (Zeigler-Hill, Campe, and Myers,\n2009). The adaptive significance of this mechanism is that it allows women (and of course\nmen) to simultaneously a) set their aspiration floor high enough to avoid settling for lesser\nmates and b) set their aspiration ceiling low enough to avoid pursuing unrealistic targets\n(Penke et al, 2007). This line of reasoning suggests that throughout our species' evolution,\nwomen with higher self-esteem would have probably secured more desirable mates.\nAnalogous arguments can be made for female assertiveness, sociability, and social\nintelligence; namely, that these traits in women would have correlated positively with male\npartner mate value, whereas a negative correlation would possibly hold between shyness\nand male partner mate value, with more shy women shunning social contact and missing\nout on potential mates. Thus, if focal females could identify model females' standing with\nregard to these personality dimensions, they may be more attracted to male partners of\nmodel females who are high in self-esteem, assertiveness, sociability, and social\nintelligence, and low in shyness.\nHere we test these hypotheses by using muted video recordings of women (model\nfemales) that were supposedly describing an ex-boyfriend. These video recordings were\npresented to a set of female raters who were asked to indicate how interested they would be\nin dating the men being described by the model females. The model females also filled out\na battery of psychometric instruments that allowed us to examine the possible relevance of\nthe aforementioned personality traits (i.e., self-esteem, assertiveness, social intelligence,\nshyness, and sociability). In addition they filled out a brief measure of the `Big Five'\nfactors of personality. These are Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,\nEmotional Stability, and Openness to Experience (Goldberg, 1993). This Big Five measure\nwas included in the expectation that, due to their salience and generality (Buss, 1991;\n1996), one or more of these Big Five factors might be able to capture some effect that\nmight not otherwise be detectable from the other narrower traits. Extending principles\nderived in part from animal studies, we also examine the importance of condition-\ndependent nonindependent mate choice arising from the side of the raters. Specifically, we\ntested whether their pattern of ratings was contingent upon differences in their own\nattractiveness (i.e., do less attractive focal females also prefer the partners of attractive\nwomen?; see Penke et al., 2007), sexual experience (i.e., do less experienced women rely\nmore heavily on nonindependent mate choice?; see Nordell and Valone, 1998;\nVukomanovic and Rodd, 2007), and relationship status (do single and paired women differ\nin the degree to which they rely on nonindependent mate choice?).\nMaterials and Methods\nCollection of Stimuli\nWe recruited 53 women by advertisement and word-of-mouth to form our stimuli\nHuman nonindependent mate choice\nset (these women were mostly undergraduate and postgraduate students from the Schools\nthey were facing the camera and describing their ideal romantic partner. We asked\nparticipants to describe their ideal (as opposed to a real) romantic partner so as to obtain\nrelatively constant expressions while retaining the relevant romantic content. Participants\nwere informed at the outset that the video clips would be shown to raters but that they\nwould be muted and participants would therefore not be able to hear what was said. Each\nvideo clip was subsequently edited to a shorter 20-sec continuous clip using Windows\nof continuous video we tried to avoid instances where, due to the nature of the task (and\npresumably not reflecting typical facial expressions), participants made extreme or erratic\nexpressions or gestures (e.g., nervous laughter, uncomfortable silence), or where they spoke\nin a manner which would make lip-reading easy.\nAfter they had been filmed, participants completed an array of psychometric\ninstruments: a) The Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI; Gosling, Rentfrow, and Swann,\n2003), a brief, ten-item inventory of the Big Five with satisfactory psychometric properties\nthat converges adequately with larger measures of the Big Five. b) The 7-item Social Skills\nsubscale of the Tromso Social Intelligence Scale (Silvera, Martinussen, and Dahl, 2001)\nwhich includes items like `I fit easily in social situations' and `I have a hard time getting\nalong with other people'. c) The Rosenberg self-esteem scale (Rosenberg, 1965), a 10-item\ninstrument with statements like `At times I think that I am no good at all' and `On the\nwhole I am satisfied with myself'. d) The Rathus Assertiveness Schedule (Rathus, 1973), a\n30-item scale of assertiveness. e) The Shyness and Sociability Scale (Cheek and Buss,\n1981), which is composed of two parts: a 9-item shyness and a 5-item sociability subscale.\nIn addition to these standardized questionnaires, participants answered the following two\nquestions (on a 10-point scale, 10 being most) that were designed to serve as self-report\nmeasures of sexual experience and self-perceived mate value, respectively: f) `Overall, how\nexperienced would you say you are in romantic relationships with men?' g) `Overall, how\ninterested and attracted are men generally in you?'\nThe 53, 20-sec muted videos were subsequently rated for attractiveness by eight\nmale students (mean age 24.4 years) from other departments (mostly Arts and Social\nSciences, so as to minimize the possibility that the raters were familiar with the model\nfemales) on a 7-point scale, and the scores averaged to produce a single attractiveness\nrating for each female video (Cronbach's  = .868). Though the women had all described\ntheir ideal romantic partner, it was evident by viewing the muted videos that there were\ndifferences in the manner in which they gave their description, some displaying more\npositive affect than others. To account for these differences we told seven female\nundergraduate students (mean age 20.3 yrs) that they would be shown muted videos of\nwomen describing an ex-boyfriend and asked them to rate each video on a 4-point scale\n(from `0-not positive' to `3-extremely positive') for the degree to which the woman's\ndescription of the man seemed to be positive. The seven female raters' scores were then\naveraged to produce a single `positive expression' score for each female video (Cronbach's\n = .691). The importance of positive expression is a straightforward finding that has\nHuman nonindependent mate choice\nalready been documented in various studies (e.g., Dugatkin, 2000; Jones, DeBruine, Little,\nBurriss, and Feinberg, 2007; Place, Todd, Penke, and Asendorpf, 2011), and here we were\nprimarily interested in controlling for it with the aim of revealing the relevance of other\nvariables.\nRatings\nRatings were carried out by 52 female students (20.9 \u00b1 2.5 yrs old; see descriptive\nstatistics in first column of Table 2). These were recruited at a university library and were\nfrom other faculties than the models (mostly Arts and Social Sciences while the models\nwere from Biological and Veterinary Sciences) in order to minimize the chance that raters\nwould know models. We gave participants a very general explanation as to the purpose of\nthe study, telling them only they would be participating in `a study of how women are\ninfluenced in their romantic choices by the choices of other women'. Prior to viewing the\nvideos the participants gave information regarding their age, sexual orientation (all were\nheterosexual), self-perceived physical attractiveness (on a 10-point scale, 10 being most\nattractive; n = 46, minimum 3, maximum 8, mean 5.84, median 6) and self-perceived\nmedian 6), though for these last two questions participants had the option of refusing the\ninformation. The instructions for the experiment were viewed on screen prior to the\npresentation of the videos, and informed the participants that the experimenters had asked\nsome women to think back and bring to mind an ex-boyfriend of whom they had `the most\nfond memories'. The experimenters had then recorded these women while they were\ndescribing this ex-boyfriend, and the participants would now be shown these video\nrecordings, though they would be played mute. Their task was to indicate how willing they\nwould be to go out on a blind date with each man being described, on a 7-point scale from\n`1-least' to `7-most' (participants were assured there were no right or wrong answers).\nThe 53 muted videos were presented in random order with a custom-made\napplication designed in C-Sharp programming language (the same application as had been\nused with the eight male and seven female raters in the preliminary part of the study).\nParticipants could give their rating and move on to the next video before they had viewed\nan entire 20-sec clip (we observed that it was relatively uncommon for participants to\nwatch a 20-sec clip in its entirety). After they had completed the task participants were\ndebriefed and asked if they had recognized any of the women in the videos, in which case\ntheir ratings for those particular stimuli were excluded from the analysis. We also excluded\nfrom the analysis altogether the ratings of 3 women who stated they had understood the\nvideos were descriptions of imaginary, not real men (two of them by lip-reading one\nparticular model female with whom they were acquainted and who made characteristic\nmouth movements, the third due to a technical error on the part of the experimenter which\nresulted in her viewing the videos with sound), thus reducing our sample of raters to 49\nResults\nData were analyzed using SPSS. We averaged the 49 ratings given to each video\nHuman nonindependent mate choice\nand used hierarchical linear multiple regression (assumptions satisfied) with each video as a\ndata-point (n = 53). Based on existing theoretical and empirical evidence, we forced model\nfemale attractiveness, model age, and `positive expression' (see above) into the first block\nof the regression. This first step was highly significant (F3\nwith the three variables accounting for nearly three quarters of the variance in ratings.\nSurprisingly, while attractiveness (beta = .543, t = 7.04, p < .001) and positive expression\n(beta = .538, t = 6.98, p < .001) made significant contributions to the model, age did not\n(beta = .023, t = 0.303, p = .76). This means that while female raters were more interested\nin dating the ex-boyfriends of model females who were more attractive and seemingly\nmore positive in their descriptions of the man, they were not more interested in dating the\nex-boyfriends of older model females. The second step of the model was a stepwise\nregression with all the measured personality and behavioral variables (social skills, self-\nesteem, assertiveness, shyness and sociability, the Big Five), self-rated mate value and self-\nrated sexual experience as predictors. Of all these previously excluded predictors, only\nemotional stability (one of the Big Five factors) entered the model at the .05 level of\nsignificance, but the resulting increment in R2 was a marginal .022, raising the overall\nexplained variance to 74.8%. The final model is presented in Table 1. As can be seen, the\nrelationship between the dependent variable and emotional stability was a negative one\n(i.e., the opposite of what one would probably expect given any relationship between these\ntwo variables). None of the other excluded variables approached significance (all p > .19).\nTable 1. Multiple regression predicting female raters' romantic interest in a man from\ncharacteristics in the model female describing him.\nIndependent variable Beta t p\nWe ran the regression anew with all variables entered stepwise at  = .05. Model\nfemale attractiveness was the first variable to enter the model, accounting for 45.2% of the\nvariance in ratings, and positive expression explained another 27.3% of variance, raising\nthe total to 72.6%. Emotional stability marginally failed to enter the model (p = .054), and\nall other variables were clearly insignificant (all p >.15). It could be argued that `positive\nexpression' is itself causally linked to underlying personality differences of the model\nfemales, and that its inclusion in the model obscures the significance of otherwise relevant\npersonality predictors. To ensure this was not the case, we reran the stepwise regression\nwith all predictors except positive expression, but after attractiveness, no other predictor\nentered the model. Finally, to better examine the effects of attractiveness on its own [and\ngiven that attractiveness was slightly correlated with positive expression, though not\nsignificantly (r = .240, n = 53, p = .084)], we regressed attractiveness against positive\nexpression, and plotted the residuals against the dependent variable (Figure 1). The scatter\nplot reveals a strongly linear relation (r = .528, n = 53, p < .0001), with a relatively constant\nHuman nonindependent mate choice\neffect of attractiveness at all levels.\nFigure 1. Scatterplot depicting the effect of model female attractiveness after positive\nexpression has been controlled.\nThe second part of our analysis focused on variance arising from the side of the\nraters. Recall that prior to giving their ratings the raters had given self-ratings (on 10-point\nscales) of attractiveness and romantic experience. We wanted to examine more closely the\nbehaviour of the raters in the top and bottom quartiles for both of these variables, but due to\nthe limited scale used, no cut-off values gave the exactly desired subsets of raters, and\nfaced with a choice between more extreme subsets but less ratings on the one hand and less\nextreme subsets but more ratings on the other, we chose the latter. First we ran the stepwise\nregression using only the ratings of the lesser attractive raters (attractiveness self-rating of 5\nor less, n = 14). Attractiveness again emerged as the most important predictor, accounting\nfor 47% of the variance, with positive expression accounting for an additional 14.4% (final\nR2 = .614, all excluded variables p > .2). Thus, even the less attractive raters preferred\nattractive model females, and did so at a level comparable to that of the overall sample. We\nthen ran the stepwise regression using only the ratings of the more attractive raters\n(attractiveness rating of 7 or more, n = 15). Positive expression emerged as the most\nimportant predictor (R2 = .569), followed by attractiveness which explained an additional\nHuman nonindependent mate choice\n13.5% of variance, and finally, self-rated romantic experience, which explained another\n2.8% (final R2 = .732, all excluded variables p > .13). As with emotional stability in\nprevious analyses, the relationship between the dependent variable and the self-rated\nromantic experience of the model females was in the opposite to expected direction (beta =\nfemales holds for both attractive and unattractive sets of raters; if anything, the more\nattractive raters depended less on model female attractiveness. We also reran the\nregressions to compare the ratings of more against less romantically experienced raters, and\nsingle raters against those in relationships, but no major differences emerged: for all groups\nthe major predictors were attractiveness and positive expression (see all comparisons in\nTable 2). Finally, to systematically and more formally examine the influence of all three\nvariables (attractiveness, romantic experience, and relationship status) simultaneously, we\na) calculated the predicted value for each model female from regression of the dependent\nvariable on attractiveness and positive expression and then b) for each rater, summed the\nabsolute differences between her own rating of each model female and the predicted value\nacross all 53 model females (i.e.  = |ki\n-pi\n|, i = 1,2...53, where k is the rating given by a\nrater to a model female and p is the predicted value for the model female). This produced,\nfor each rater, a measure of her propensity to be predictably influenced by model female\nattractiveness and positive expression, with smaller values indicating a stronger influence.\nWe then regressed this sum (n = 49) against rater attractiveness, romantic experience, and\nrelationship status simultaneously, but the resulting model was not significant (p > .5, all\npredictors p > .2), indicating no condition-dependent nonindependent mate choice.\nTable 2. Stepwise multiple regressions by female rater subgroup. Attractiveness and\nromantic experience categorizations are based on self-ratings given by the raters on a 10-\npoint scale.\nGroup of raters Predictor R R\na\na\nstandardized coefficients appearing in the final regression equation\nHuman nonindependent mate choice\nDiscussion\nThe preceding has been an attempt to answer the following question: from the\nviewpoint of a prospecting female, what information in the face of a potential mate's ex-\ngirlfriend can impact her assessment of the male's mate value? We used video recordings\nof model females to allow the examination, for the first time, of dynamic cues like\npersonality factors, while at the same time withholding any stimuli that related to the actual\ntarget male (like a video, a photograph, a written description etc.). This design forced the\nfemale raters to rely solely on the model female for their assessments and allowed us to\navoid additional sources of variance that would arise from the target males. The results\npresented here suggest that in regard to the question we asked, namely what cues can be\nfound in a girlfriend's face from the vantage point of a focal female rater, the one-word\nanswer is `looks', and that this preference for more attractive model females is universal\namong raters, be they attractive or unattractive, experienced or inexperienced (but see\nWaynforth, 2007), single or in a relationship. Model female attractiveness alone accounted\nfor 45% of the total variance in ratings, and when coupled to `positive expression' (i.e., a\nmeasure of how positive a model female's descriptions of her supposed ex-boyfriend\nappeared to be) the two variables explained over 70% of the variance in ratings. The\nimportance of positive expression is a straightforward finding that has already been\ndocumented in earlier studies (e.g., Jones et al., 2007; Place et al., 2011), and here we were\nprimarily interested in controlling for it with the aim of revealing the relevance of other\nvariables.\nSurprisingly, we found no evidence that female raters are more interested in the\npartners of slightly older model females (in their 20s), a finding that contradicts a recently\nreported post-hoc result (Vakirtzis and Roberts, 2010a). The importance of model female\nage has been well-documented in the non-human literature (Amlacher and Dugatkin, 2005;\nDugatkin and Godin, 1993; Vukomanovic and Rodd, 2007), and is typically attributed to\nthe greater experience of more mature females and their superior mate-choice skills\n(Nordell and Valone, 1998). The fact that here we used a design specifically designed to\nuncover this effect (among others) and that we employed a substantially larger sample size\n(n = 53 vs. 20) suggests that the earlier finding (Vakirtzis and Roberts, 2010a) was perhaps\na chance result. In humans, partner age may not have the same effect that it does in mate\nchoice copying in other species, given that human males tend to prefer younger females\n(though younger men not so strongly), whereas in other species this age preference is\nThe suggestion that focal women might be sensitive to cues in the model female\nother than attractiveness (like age) led us naturally to examine whether some of these cues,\nif they indeed exist, might be found in the personality/behavioral domain. We included here\nthose personality traits that should have been associated, throughout our evolutionary\nhistory, with women securing more desirable males. The first and most obvious candidate\nwas self-esteem, which is believed to regulate womens' aspirations with regards to a mate\n(reviewed in Penke et al., 2007). Women with higher self-esteem (and of presumably\nhigher mate value) are thought to adjust upwards their aspirations and presumably secure\nmore desirable mates, whereas the opposite holds for women with low self-esteem\nHuman nonindependent mate choice\n(Zeigler-Hill, Campe, and Myers, 2009). In support of this hypothesis, we found a\ncorrelation of .483 between self-esteem and a one-item self-report measure of mate value\n(see Brase and Guy, 2004; Penke and Denissen, 2008, for similar results). Similar\narguments can be made for female assertiveness, sociability, and social intelligence. In\naddition to these more specific traits, we included a measure of the Big Five (Gosling et al.,\ngenerality, the Big Five would perhaps be able to capture, even if very coarsely, relevant\ntraits that could then be more accurately dissected in future studies. Of all the traits\nexamined, only one of the Big Five Factors, emotional stability, achieved statistical\nsignificance (p = .048), but the sign of the correlation (negative whereas a positive would\nbe expected) and the marginal increment in explained variance suggest that this relationship\nis probably a type I error, owing to the large number of predictors in the regression. Having\nsaid this, the possibility that there are indeed other relevant cues in the model female which\nthis study failed to detect cannot be excluded. We used only self-report measures for\npersonality traits and relied on single-item measures to assess mate value and sexual\nexperience. Mate value in particular is a dynamic and convoluted concept and a single item\nis unlikely to measure it very well. Also, the fact that the videos were played mute and that\nthey only showed the faces of the model females constitutes an impoverishment of the real-\nlife stimuli that future studies could improve upon. Can the traits measured here, most\nnotably self-esteem and assertiveness, as well as the Big Five, be picked up by focal\nfemales from watching a muted short video? We assumed here that they could, but note\nthat this question cannot be answered simply by having a separate set of raters assess the\nmodel females in the muted videos for the degree to which they appear, say, assertive or\nextroverted. There is a difference between the conscious assessment of a personality trait\nand the subconscious influence of that trait on a dedicated nonindependent mate choice\nmechanism.\nFinally, a number of interesting variations on the current design suggest themselves.\nFor instance, model females could be asked to describe an actual former partner (for\nexample the most recent one) and the video recordings could be played with sound, so that\na wide array of positive and negative real-life descriptions would be available to focal\nfemales. Of particular interest in such a scenario would be those instances where highly\nattractive women gave very negative descriptions of their former partner (or where very\nunattractive women gave positive descriptions). Would model female attractiveness still\nhave an effect in these extreme conditions? We predict that it would: in the end there is no\nmore concrete proof of a man's mate value than the fact that through a typically protracted\nperiod of courtship (Trivers, 1972) and sequential evaluation stages (Miller and Todd,\n1998), an attractive female formed a relationship with him. What this female subsequently\nsays can never cancel out what she actually did, and given that words are cheap whereas\neggs are expensive, her actions should always carry more weight. This design would more\naccurately simulate real-life social situations (Vakirtzis and Roberts, 2012) where women\ndiscuss their romantic lives and gossip about potential mates.\nHuman nonindependent mate choice\nReferences\nAmlacher, J., and Dugatkin, L.
