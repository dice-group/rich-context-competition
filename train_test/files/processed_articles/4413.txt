The\nconstruction industry has traditionally been dominated by strong union firms. However, non-union construction firms began\nto emerge in the 1990s and this change caused to bring conflicts between union and non-union construction firms. This\npresents a unique opportunity to study employees' attitude toward organization. This article investigates workers' attitudes\ntoward union and non-union construction firms in terms of organizational commitment (OC) and turnover intention.\nControl variables in OC and turnover intention include personal characteristics, job characteristics, group-leader relations\nand organizational characteristics. The study found that employees in union firms are more committed to the organization\nthan non-union organization, but they have higher intention to job turnover although the regression coefficients of union\nvariable in commitment and turnover intention are not statistically significant at the conventional level of significance.\n",

Studies on\nattitudes focus frequently on organizational commitment\n(OC) and turnover intention. One of the important conse-\nquences of OC is the link between OC and employee inten-\ntion to leave the organization and actual turnover (Allen &\nThere are a plethora of studies on OC (Allen & Meyer,\nthe antecedents of OC and consequences of such commit-\nment to a single organization. Mathieu and Zajac (1990)\nreviewed and conducted meta-analysis of the antecedents,\ncorrelates, and consequences of OC. They found that most\nstudies have investigated the relationships between OC and\norganizational structural characteristics, career enhancement\nopportunities, union commitment relationships, and so forth,\nin sampled employees from a single organization. They\nadvocated that a greater number of studies need to be con-\nducted with employees sampled from a wide variety of orga-\nnizations to adequately test the relationships between OC\nand its antecedents. This study attempts to meet that need.\nStudies on OC in unionized and non-unionized settings are\nscarce although several studies have investigated dual com-\nmitment to the union and the organization (Gordon, Beauvais,\nmembers' commitment to a labor organization and found that\nthe benefits unions provide their members emerged as the\nmost important basis for union commitment. Tetrick (1995),\nhowever, argued that the development and maintenance of\nunion commitment is contingent on the mutual obligation of\nthe union and its members centered on a social exchange,\nrather than an economic exchange model. Thacker, Fields,\nand Barclay (1990) examined antecedent and outcome mod-\nels for four factors of union commitment (loyalty to the union,\nresponsibility to the union, willingness to work for the union,\nand belief in unionism). Gordon, Beauvais, and Ladd (1984)\nprovided empirical evidence of dual allegiance to the union\nand to management in the job satisfaction and union commit-\nment of unionized engineers.\n1Saginaw Valley State University, University Center, MI, USA\n2Central Michigan University, Mt.

They\nargued that dual allegiance must offer unique predictive\npower above that of company allegiance and union alle-\ngiance for even one dependent variable (productivity or\neffectiveness), and if no such relationship can be isolated,\nthen dual allegiance may be considered an epiphenomenon\nand dismissed from serious scientific inquiry.\nThis article will examine determinants of the commitment\nand impact of commitment on the intention to quit in union\nand non-union settings in the construction industry.\nEmployees were sampled from many different organizations.\nThe union firm in the construction industry is different from\nthe non-union firm in hiring practices, participation in deci-\nsion making, methods of rewarding individuals, evaluations\nof individual performance, duration of employment with the\nsame firm, hierarchical levels of the organization, and pay.\nThese differences between union and non-union firms may\nbe regarded as differences in organizational architecture.\nBrickley, Smith, and Zimmerman (2008) refer to the assign-\nment of decision rights within the firm, the methods of\nrewarding individuals, and the structure of systems to evalu-\nate the performance of individuals and business units as the\nfirm's organizational architecture. The organization of work\nin construction firms also differs from manufacturing and\nservice firms. Production in construction firms is divided\ninto a variety of trades, and it is common practice for general\ncontractors to subcontract portions of a project to a special\ntrade.\nPolitical and economic environments in the U.S. con-\nnon-union firms emerged prominently in the early 1990s. As\nnon-union firms were growing, workers in union firms faced\nuncertainty and threat of wage cuts and loss of job security.\nThe impact of these threats on OC needs to be evaluated,\nbecause employees tend to modify their behavior toward the\ncompany as they face threat. We have observed that threats\nof wage and job reductions due to globalization, downsiz-\ning, and outsourcing have made changes easier in the U.S.\nfirms.\nThe organizational differences in union and non-union\nfirms in the construction industry, job characteristics of con-\nstruction firms, and emergence of non-union firms in the\n1990s present a unique opportunity to study the impact of\nOC on employees in union and non-union firms. Such\nresearch is critical because of the link between commitment\nand turnover, which are important determining factors of\norganizational stability and performance. Traditional OC\nstudies have focused on stability and performance as conse-\nquences of OC. Perhaps important additional dimensions of\nconsequences in OC are implications in agency costs and\ncorporate changes. Committed employees may help reduce\nagency costs and make corporate changes easier. These ele-\nments are very crucial in today's business environments\nwhere continuing improvements are required.\nEmployees' OC\nOC has frequently been conceptualized and measured in\nthree different ways: the affective component, the continu-\nance component, and the normative component. According\nto Allen and Meyer (1990), the affective component of OC\nrefers to employees' emotional attachment to, identification\nwith, and involvement in the organization. The continuance\ncommitment refers to commitment based on the costs that\nemployees associate with leaving an organization. The nor-\nmative commitment refers to employees' feelings of obliga-\ntion to remain with the organization. Allen and Meyer (1996)\nsurveyed the OC literature and found an inverse relationship\nbetween commitment and job turnover in all studies they\nhave examined. The measurement of OC in this study is\naffective commitment. Mowday, Porter, and Steers (1982)\ndefined attitudinal OC as\nThe relative strength of an individual's identification with and\ninvolvement in a particular organization. Conceptually, it can be\ncharacterized by at least three factors: a) a strong belief in and\nacceptance of the organization's goal and values; b) a willingness\nto exert considerable effort on behalf of the organization; and c) a\nstrong desire to maintain membership in the organization. (p. 27)\nThis concept of OC benefits employees, organizations,\nand society as a whole. Mathieu and Zajac (1990) articulated\nwell the benefits of OC:\nEmployees' level of commitment to an organization may make\nthem more eligible to receive both extrinsic (e.g., wages and\nbenefits) and psychological (e.g., intrinsic job satisfaction and\nrelationships with coworkers) rewards associated with\nmembership. Organizations value commitment among their\nemployees, which is typically assumed to reduce withdrawal\nbehaviors such as lateness and turnover. In addition, committed\nemployees may be more likely to engage in \"extra-role\"\nbehaviors, such as creativeness or innovativeness, which are\noften what keeps an organization competitive (Katz & Kahn,\n1978). From a larger perspective, a society as a whole tends to\nbenefit from employees' organizational commitment in terms of\nlower rates of job movement and perhaps higher national\nproductivity or work quality or both. (p. 171)\nBenefits of OC suggest that OC should reduce job turn-\nover and agency costs. Agency costs are costs associated with\naligning interests of the principal (organization) and agents\n(employees). Lately, agency costs have become huge prob-\nlems to organizations, employees, and society as a whole, as\nwe have observed from Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom.\nThe Characteristics of Construction\nWork in Union and Non-Union\nConstruction Firms\nIn the construction industry, today there is a distinct division\nof labor, with such categories as asbestos workers, boiler\nPark et al. 3\nmakers, carpenters, cement masons, electrical workers, ele-\nvator construction workers, glaziers, iron workers, laborers,\nmillwrights, operating engineers, painters, plasterers, plumb-\ners, pipe fitters, roofers, sheet metal workers, and others.\nConstruction projects are performed by these labor special-\nists in some serial sequence.\nIn construction, the various specialties build on the work\nof other specialties, but the intermediate product does not\nmove, as it does in manufacturing. Instead the intermediate\nproduct is fixed and the specialists move. Furthermore, labor\nspecialists can become subcontractors or be hired by general\ncontractors. Eccles (1981) describes parties involved and\nrelationships among them in construction projects in the fol-\nlowing way:\nThe organization of construction projects involves relationships\namong the owner, the general contractor, and various special\ntrade contractors. Most typically, the owner writes a general\ncontractwithageneralcontractorwhoassumestotalresponsibility\nfor accomplishing the project. Often these projects are for a fixed\nprice on a total or unit of work basis and have time deadlines and\nfinancial incentives and penalties. Other forms include cost plus\ncontracts which can also have incentives and penalties. For fixed\nprice contracts general contractors are usually selected by\ncompetitive bidding among a group of firms who have been\nqualified to bid for the project. (p. 338)\nEccles (1981) further argues that relations between the\ngeneral contractor and subcontractors are stable and con-\ntinuous over fairly long periods of time, because transac-\ntion costs would be high if, for every new project, a general\ncontractor solicited bids from a number of subcontractors\nfor each trade. He calls this type of quasi-integration\nbetween the general contractor and subcontractors the\n\"quasifirm.\"\nIn the construction industry, the degree of quasi-integra-\ntion differs among firms, and the difference is more pro-\nnounced between the union firm and the non-union firm. The\nkey difference between the two is that the union firm has at\nits disposal skilled craftsmen who can be called upon from\nthe union as demand dictates. In essence, the union performs\nthe function of human resource planning, whereas the non-\nunion firm assumes the responsibility of its own human\nresource planning.\nThe union contractor works with the union to control the\nrecruitment of new entrants into the skilled trade unions.\nMost new entrants go through 4 years of apprenticeship\ntraining before receiving journeyman status. Hiring is usu-\nally done annually. Selection is made by the joint apprentice-\nship board comprising contractors and union representatives,\nand hiring practices in the union firm are governed by union\ncontracts. Most skilled trade unions have similar rules regu-\nlating the disposition of their members, a process called the\nreferral system. In this system, the union selects and refers\napplicants on request of the contractor, who can accept or\nreject all referrals made by the union. The employer also has\nthe opportunity to pick from the specified number of candi-\ndates on the list.\nFrom the workers' standpoint, there is little difference\nbetween firms, as the job function is virtually the same\nbetween firms, and pay and benefits are identical under the\nunion contract. Workers frequently move from one firm to\nanother, depending on the demand for workers. Only a select\nfew maintain consistent employment with one particular\nfirm for an extended period of time.\nThe non-union firm, however, assumes the responsibility\nof human resource planning. This firm conducts its own\nrecruiting from the general labor pool and then trains work-\ners; it tends to retain its workers during slack times to reduce\nthe problem of finding experienced workers.\nThe union firms' organizational architecture can be char-\nacterized as less hierarchical than non-union firms: Union\nworkers have more decision rights, they are rewarded based\non the union contract, and their performances are less moni-\ntored than non-union workers. However, union construction\nworkers work for many different firms, although they may\nwork for the same firm many times during their career.\nIn union firms, decision rights are assigned more to the\nunion, whereas in non-union firms managers have more\ndecision rights. Rewards in union firms are primarily deter-\nmined by the terms and conditions of employment as speci-\nfied in union contracts, and union workers are much better\npaid. Although non-union employees' wages are lower, non-\nunion firms have in place discretionary work incentives,\nsuch as bonuses and profit sharing. Performances of employ-\nees are more closely monitored in non-union firms than\nunion firms. These differences in organizational architecture\nof union and non-union construction firms illustrate that the\nunion firms utilize more indirect control than the non-union\nfirms, as summarized in Table 1.\nCharacteristics of union and non-union construction firms\nhave mixed combinations of positive and negative dimen-\nsions for OC and turnover intention. For example, non-union\nfirms have positive characteristics for OC in duration of\nemployment and reward system, but negative characteristics\nin control and performance evaluation. These positive and\nadverse dimensions of union and non-union firms are likely\nto have effect on OC. We summarize the positive (+) and\nnegative (-) characteristics in organizational architecture of\nunion and non-union firms in Table 2. These differences may\nhave implications for firm efficiency and performance\nstudy examines the impact of organizational architectural\ndifferences in union and non-union firms on OC and turn-\nover intention.\nOC differentials between employees in union and non-\nunion firms will depend on the net effect of these positive\nand negative dimensions of union and non-union firms. We\nbelieve that union firms' positive dimensions may outweigh\nthe non-union firms' positive dimensions in regard to OC.\nTherefore, we formulate the following hypothesis.\n4 SAGE Open\nHypothesis 1: Workers in union firms are likely to be\nmore committed to the organization.\nWorkers in union firms enjoy higher pay and more auton-\nomy, whereas non-union firms rely on the individual incen-\ntive system such as bonuses and profit sharing for the selected\nworkers. Pay is inversely related to turnover and the indi-\nvidual incentive system tends to increase functional turnover\n(Park, Ofori-Dankwa, & Bishop, 1994). The turnover study\nby Park et al. (1994) contributes to the job turnover function-\nality and several turnover functionality has drawn scholars\nJenkins, & Gupta, 1998; Shaw, Dineen, Fang, & Vellella,\n2009). Studies also found that there is a close relationship\nbetween intention to leave (quit) and turnover (Mathieu &\nindividual incentive system of non-union firms, we can draw\nthe second hypothesis.\nHypothesis 2: Workers in union firms are less likely to\nquit the organization than workers in non-union firms.\nControl Variables\nMany studies have examined the relations between affective\ncommitment and its antecedents. The wide range of vari-\nables that have been investigated were presented in the cat-\negories of personal characteristics, group-leader relations,\norganizational characteristics, and role states in Mathien and\nZajac's meta-analysis of antecedents of OC (Mathieu &\nZajac, 1990). We closely follow those categories in our\nstudy and formulate additional hypotheses on antecedents\nthat were not investigated in previous studies.\nPersonal Characteristics\nPersonal characteristics in our study include age, gender,\neducational attainment, organizational tenure, trade tenure,\nand salary. The results of Mathieu and Zajac's (1990) meta-\nanalysis show that age, organizational tenure, salary, and\nability have positive relationships with OC. Marital status\nand level of education attained are inversely related to OC.\nWe hypothesize that our study will confirm the Mathieu and\nZajac's results.\nThe likelihood of bonuses and pay increases, which were\nnot investigated in previous studies are included in our study.\nThese should make employees feel good about the organiza-\ntion and we believe that there will be a positive relationship\nbetween the perceived bonus and pay increase and OC.\nHypothesis 3: The likelihood of bonus pay and pay\nincreases will have a positive association with OC.\nThis study also investigates the effect of threat of wage\nreductions on OC. Construction employees in union firms\nfaced a threat of wage reductions as non-union firms emerged\nTable 1.

Today, many employees in the United States\nface problems such as wage reductions and job eliminations\nbecause of globalization, downsizing, and off-shore out-\nsourcing. The effect of wage reduction on OC may offer a\nclue to the effect of similar threats, such as downsizing and\noutsourcing, on OC. Based on the above premises, we for-\nmulate Hypothesis 4.\nHypothesis 4: There will be a positive relationship\nbetween a threat of wage reductions and OC.\nConstruction employees experience frequent layoffs and\nthe number of layoffs will have an adverse effect on OC;\ntherefore, we formulate Hypothesis 5.\nHypothesis 5: The number of layoffs will show an inverse\nrelationship with OC.\nJob Characteristics\nJob characteristics investigated in Mathieu and Zajac's meta-\nanalysis are skill variety, task autonomy, job challenge, and\njob scope. These have positive relationships with OC. We\nadded job security, flexibility, and job satisfaction in our\nstudy. We also hypothesize that there will be a positive rela-\ntionship between job characteristics and OC.\nGroup-Leader Relations\nAn employee connects to an organization through relation-\nships with the immediate supervisor and peers. Wayne,\nShore, and Linden (1997) developed and tested a model of\nthe antecedents and consequences in OC and they investi-\ngated perceived organizational support and leader-member\nexchange. They found that leader-member exchange posi-\ntively related to organizational citizen behavior and OC.\nAntecedents in group-leader relationships are task indepen-\ndence, leader competency, co-workers, participative leader-\nship, and leader understanding. We hypothesize that these\nvariables will reveal a positive relationship with OC.\nOrganizational Characteristics\nOrganizational characteristics typically deal with organiza-\ntional size and organizational centralization (Mathieu & Zajac,\n1990). However, we investigate characteristics of union and\nnon-union firms in the construction industry, in which non-\nunion firms are more hierarchical than union firms in the con-\nstruction industry. As illustrated before, our study adds\nadditional dimensions to the organizational characteristics.\nTurnover Intention\nThe important consequences of OC are its relationships with\nturnover intention and actual turnover. Studies on the\nrelationships between OC and the employees' intention to\nleave the organization and actual turnover report consistent\nnegative correlations (Allen & Meyer, 1996; Mathieu &\nThis study investigates the relationship between OC and\nemployee intention to quit the organization. Steel and Ovalle's\n(1984) meta-analysis on turnover found that intention to quit\nthe organization is the strongest predictor of turnover.\nHypothesis 6: Committed employees are less likely to\nquit the organization and we hypothesize that there will be\nan inverse relationship between OC and intention to quit\nthe organization.\nSeveral studies made comparisons of relative importance\nof OC and job satisfaction to intention to quit the organiza-\nthat satisfaction and commitment each uniquely contribute to\nturnover intention.\nThere are also many studies on the relationship between\njob satisfaction and OC. Martin and Bennett (1996) classify\nthem into four models: (a) job satisfaction as antecedent to\nOC, (b) OC as antecedent to job satisfaction, (c) OC and job\nsatisfaction as reciprocally related, (d) OC and job satisfac-\ntion as independent.\nThe model that specifies job satisfaction as an antecedent\nof OC has received considerable support. The relationship\nbetween OC and job satisfaction has been found to be posi-\ntively correlated (Bateman & Strasser, 1984; Bluedorn,\nisfaction, OC, and intention to quit the organization.\nHypothesis 7: Satisfied employees are likely to be\nstrongly committed to the organization and less likely to\nquit the organization.\nConstruction employees tend to work for more firms than\nemployees in other industries. They are similar to knowledge\nworkers in consulting firms and they are exposed to different\nfirms and working environments. Construction employees'\nexperiences with various organizations may help develop\nadaptabilities to changes and different working environments.\nHypothesis 8: There will be a positive relationship\nbetween the number of firms worked and turnover\nintention.\nControl Variable in Turnover Intention\nModel\nAlbelson and Baysinger (1984) indicated that individual,\norganizational, and environmental attributes influence the\nemployee's perception of costs and benefits associated with\n6 SAGE Open\nthe entire process of quitting one employment opportunity\nand joining another.\nNumerous studies (Jackofsky & Peters, 1983; Mobley,\nhave investigated turnover based on individual attributes.\nThese studies have examined individual characteristics such\nas age, gender, length of service, level of employment, level\nof skill, education, and ability. We will include age, gender,\nlength of employment, education, salary, satisfaction, and\ncommitment as individual characteristic variables in this\nstudy.\nOrganizational characteristics associated with turnover\nare integration, communication, centralization, routinization,\nprofessionalization, upward mobility, distributive justice,\nand firm size. Antecedents included as organizational char-\nacteristics are the same as those included in the commitment\nmodel.\nEnvironmental characteristics are geographic location,\nenvironmental turbulence, size of metropolitan area, compe-\ntition in the market place, economic conditions, and support\norganizations. This study does not include environmental\ncharacteristics because we draw our data and sample from\none region in Midwestern states. We include a perceived job\nopportunity variable in our study that may reflect what the\nenvironment characteristics try to capture.\nMethod\nData used for the study are based on construction industry\nemployer and employee surveys, administered in 1992. The\nemployer survey was designed to find out characteristics of\nunion and non-union construction firms. The employee sur-\nvey was designed to study employee attitudes toward OC,\nturnover intention, and job satisfaction. We obtained a mail-\ning list of construction firms in three counties in the\nMidwestern region of the United States from Dun and\nBradstreet. The list consists of 530 firms of general contrac-\ntors (SIC 15) and 913 firms of special trade contractors (SIC\ntion firms listed in Dun & Bradstreet, from the identified\nAs many of the firms listed in Dun & Bradstreet did not stay\nin the construction business, the 121 firms that responded\nmake up about 10% of the population. Of the surveys\nreturned, 23 indicated they are union firms and 87 indicated\nthey are non-union firms.\nThe employee survey consisted of four parts: (a) demo-\ngraphic characteristics, education, and experiences; (b) work\nsafety, work environment, and organizational characteristics;\n(c) OC and intention to quit; (d) motivation and job satisfac-\ntion. The survey questionnaire we used in this study followed\nclosely the survey questionnaire of Maloney and McFillen\nstruction employees from the state employment and security\noffice. Eight hundred and ninety three surveys were returned;\nof these, 130 surveys were incomplete and 55 survey respon-\ndents failed to indicate whether they worked for union or\nnon-union forms. Thus, we used 652 survey respondents in\nour study. Of these, 340 were hourly employees in union\nfirms and 312 were from non-union firms. Survey respon-\ndents skipped some questions in the survey; thus, the number\nof observations varies.\nMeasures\nMeasurements of the data are largely a Likert-type 7-point\nscale. There are, however, some numerical interval scale data\nsuch as age, years of employment, years of technical school,\nyears of education, pay and benefits. Union versus non-union\nemployees (union = 1, non-union = 0), gender (male = 1,\nfemale = 0), and marital status (married = 1, not married = 0)\nare dummy variables in the model. The Cronbach's alpha\nwas calculated to see the internal reliability of multi-item\nmeasures of variables such as commitment and satisfaction.\nCommitment was measured with Allen and Meyer's (1990)\neight-item affective commitment scale. The 7-point response\nscales ranged from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree\n(7). The Cronbach's alpha was .869. General job satisfaction\nwas measured by asking respondents to show their level of\nagreement with the two items: (a) all in all, I am satisfied\nwith working my trade and (b) In general, I like working at\nmy trade. The reliability test score showed the -value of\nOther multi-item variables in the model and their reliabil-\nity test scores were intrinsic reward (seven items;  = .892);\nparticipation in decision making (two items;  = .804); inter-\npersonal relationships with co-workers (three items;  =.820);\nforeman's bias (three items;  = .676); working conditions\n(two items;  = .739); professional commitment (four items;\naccomplishment (two items;  = .647); work autonomy (three\nitems;  = .824); work flexibility (two items;  = .912); fore-\nman's understanding your work (two items;  = 702); work-\ner's aspiration (three items;  = .704); and job security (two\nitems;  = .822). The rest of the variables were measured in a\nsingle-item question. These  values show that measuments\nare reliable.\nEmpirical Results\nRegression coefficients of multiple regression models were\nestimated, with the sampled data and results presented in\nThe survey asked questions regarding the number of lay-\noffs, the number of construction firms worked, and incentive\nsystems, to find out differences in organizational characteris-\ntics of union and non-union firms. The 73% of non-union\nfirm employees worked for a single firm and 48% of union\nfirm employees worked for a single firm. The average num-\nber of firms worked for in the previous year was 1.4 in\nPark et al. 7\nnon-union firms and 2.4 in union firms. The percent of zero\nlayoffs in non-union firms was 31.3% and in union firms,\n10.6%. The average number of layoffs for non-union and\nunion firms was 1.2 and 2.7, respectively. The prevalent\nform of work incentives in non-union firms was bonus pay.\nPersonal data indicated that employees in non-union firms\nwere younger than union firm employees; the average age of\nnon-union firm employees was 35.6 years, compared with\n40.3 years for union-firm employees. The average number of\nyears in current trades was 12.1 years for non-union employ-\nees, 17.7 for union employees. The average hourly pay was\nUS$10.69 for non-union employees, compared with\nPersonal data indicated that employees in non-union firms\nwere younger than union firm employees; the average age of\nnon-union firm employees was 35.6 years, compared with\n40.3 years for union-firm employees.

The average hourly pay was\nUS$10.69 for non-union employees, compared with\nStatistically significant variables at the conventional level\nmodel are age, organizational tenure, hourly pay, likelihood\nof pay increase, likelihood of wage cut, accomplishment, job\nflexibility, foreman's understanding, organizational policy,\nwork rules, inspiration, professional commitment, and loy-\nalty to union.\nStatistically significant variables in the turnover intention\nmodel are age, trade tenure, ability, likelihood of bonus and\npay increase, perceived performance, OC, number of con-\nstruction firms worked, participation in decision making,\nforeman's understanding, foreman's bias, and professional\ncommitment and job satisfaction.\nDiscussion\nThe variables in organizational characteristics reveal inter-\nesting results. Employees in union firms show a higher level\nof commitment than non-union firm employees. The union\nvariable is a dummy variable (union = 1, non-union = 0, and\np value is .34.) The regression coefficient reveals that\nemployees' commitment in union firms is higher than that of\nnon-union firm employees by .154 in the 7-point scale. This\nresult may imply that the positive dimensions of union firms,\nsuch as higher pay, indirect control, and less monitoring, out-\nweigh the positive dimensions of non-union firms. The non-\nunion firm has positive dimensions in organizational tenure,\nsmall size, pay bonuses, and less frequent layoffs. The\nempirical result failed to confirm Hypothesis 1 at the con-\nventional level of significance, but revealed the hypothesized\ndirection of the relation between the union and OC. As com-\npetition between union and non-union firms grows, both\nsides modify their attitudes toward employers. Balser and\nWinkler (2012) found that the leadership of the International\nBrotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and union mem-\nbers increases their labor-management cooperation in\nresponse to increasing competition from the non-unionized\nelectrical contracting sector. This evidence shows that com-\npetition drives changes in employees' attitudes and culture\n(value) and changes in culture lead to changes in employee\nbehavior.\nOrganizational policy, work rule, and inspiration vari-\nables are statistically significant and show positive associa-\ntion with OC. Inspiration has a strong association with OC.\nStandardized regression coefficients (beta) indicate that the\ninspiration variable is the most important variable in the\ncommitment model.\nOC\nStatistically significant personal characteristics in OC are\norganizational tenure, hourly pay, likelihood of bonus and\npay increase, likelihood of wage cut and accomplishment.\nThe age variable reveals an inverse relationship with OC.\nThis result, which does not confirm Mathieu and Zajac's\n(1990) meta-analysis, may be due to the nature of construc-\ntion work. Construction employees' organizational tenure is\nrelatively short compared with other industries. As construc-\ntion employees work for many firms over the years, they\nmay commit less to an organization.\nThe likelihood of bonuses and pay increase and threat of\nwage cuts are statistically significant and reveal positive\nsigns. These aspects of personal characteristics have not\nbeen explored in previous OC studies. The likelihood of\nbonuses and pay increases represents employees' percep-\ntions and outlook on the organization. The employees' per-\nceived bonuses and pay increases provide a better perspective\non the organization that he/she is working for. Therefore, he\nor she is more likely to be loyal to the organization, and\nthe empirical results support Hypothesis 3.\nThe likelihood of wage cuts is an interesting variable. As\nnon-union firms have prominently emerged in the early\n1990s, union firm employees felt threats of wage cuts and\nshowed strong commitment to their union firms. Today's\nworkers in the United States are facing similar threats as the\nfirms' input and output markets are changing rapidly. This\nresult supports Hypothesis 4. Workers are likely to be more\nloyal to their organization and accept changes to save the\norganization and their jobs. Kim's (1998) study demon-\nstrated that Hyundai Motor in Korea constructed crisis pro-\nactively to shift learning orientation and facilitate\norganizational learning.\nPerceived accomplishment reveals a strong positive asso-\nciation with OC. Although the number of layoffs and per-\nceived job alternatives are not statistically significant, they\nare inversely associated with OC. Frequent layoffs may gen-\nerate resentment toward the organization. While the results\nare consistent in direction with Hypothesis 5, they fall short\nof meeting the conventional level of significance. Workers'\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 3.

Numbers in parentheses are p values.\nPark et al. 9\nperceived job alternatives may offer hopes for jobs in other\norganizations and make them less committed to the\norganization.\nPerceived job security has a positive association with OC,\nbut is not statistically significant. The job flexibility variable\nis statistically significant and shows an inverse association\nwith OC. Job flexibility may mean that employees are\nrequired to do specialties that they are not trained for. The\nresults indicate that employees prefer not to work specialties\nthat they are not well trained for. As job flexibility increases,\nemployees are less committed to their organizations.\nThe only statistically significant variable in group rela-\ntions is foreman understanding. Co-worker relationship vari-\nable falls just shy of statistical significance (p value = .12).\nForeman understanding shows a negative sign and appears to\ncontradict previous studies (Mathieu & Zajac, 1990).\nParticipation, foreman bias, and feedback confirm the previ-\nous findings in directions of association, but are not statisti-\ncally significant at the conventional level of significance.\nProfessional commitment and union loyalty are statisti-\ncally significant and show an inverse relationship with OC.\nEmployees more strongly committed to the profession and\nunion are less committed to the organization. These results\nindicate that there is a trade-off between OC and commit-\nment to profession and union. This study is not designed to\nstudy company and union dual allegiance (Gordon & Ladd,\nas contradictory to the previous dual allegiance studies.\nConsequences of OC\nOne of the important consequences of OC is a negative cor-\nrelation between OC and employee intention to quit the orga-\nnization. The result of the turnover intention model strongly\nsupports Hypothesis 6 that there will be an inverse relation-\nship between OC and intention to quit the organization. This\nresult also confirms previous studies (Allen & Meyer, 1996;\nresults indicate that OC holds higher relative importance\nthan does the job satisfaction variable.\nGroup relation characteristics showed a strong associa-\ntion with the turnover intention, but they did not show strong\nassociation with OC. Organizational characteristics variables\nrevealed a strong association with OC. Participatory man-\nagement and foreman understanding have significant inverse\nrelationship with the intention to quit, which implies that\nemployees' participation in decision making and foreman\nunderstanding reduces turnover. Foreman bias is found to\nhave a strong positive association with the intention to quit.\nTherefore, foreman bias can foster employee turnover and\ngood relationships with co-workers may deter turnover, but\nthe latter association is not statistically significant.\nIntention to quit in union firm employees is higher than in\nnon-union firm employees. Though there is turnover inten-\ntion differential between union and non-union employees,\nthe differential is not statistically significant. The result fails\nto confirm Hypothesis 2. However, the turnover differential\nmay indicate that union firm employees feel insecure about\ntheir employment and seek alternative opportunity for the\nsame pay.\nThe job satisfaction variable is statistically significant in\nthe turnover intention model. However, it is not statistically\nsignificant in the OC model only and partially confirms\nHypothesis 7. Fu and Deshpande (2012) obtained the same\nresults from a Chinese company.\nThe number of firms worked shows a statistically signifi-\ncant positive association with the turnover intention and con-\nfirms Hypothesis 8. As employees work for more firms, they\ndevelop abilities to adapt to new organizations, a factor likely\nto increase turnover intention.\nLimitations\nEmpirical studies on OC and turnover intention suffer from\nmeasurement problems and this study is no exception.\nSurvey respondents are self-selected to respond to the survey\nand there is a likelihood of selection or non-response bias.\nConclusion\nThe study investigated factors affecting OC and conse-\nquences of OC in union and non-union construction firm set-\ntings. The unique nature of construction firms permitted us to\nstudy some additional dimensions of OC and turnover inten-\ntion in our study. The study suggests that employees' OC in\nunion firms is higher than that of non-union firms, but\nemployees' turnover intension in union firms is higher than\nemployees in nonunion firms although both regression coef-\nficients are not statistically significant at the conventional\nlevel of significance. The difference may stem from differ-\nences in organizational architecture of union and non-union\nfirms. Higher pay, indirect control, and less hierarchy in\nunion firms may explain the speculative commitment differ-\nential. Since employees in union fims work for more number\nof firms than nonunion firm employees they might have\ndeveloped a better adaptive proclivity in changing organisa-\ntions. Differences in organizational charateristics of union\nand nonunion firms might have also dissipated over the years\nas organizations compete to hire competent employees from\nthe same labor pool. We have investigated additional per-\nsonal factors that were not examined in previous OC studies.\nEconomic factors such as hourly pay, likelihood of bonuses,\nand pay increase and likelihood of wage cuts revealed sig-\nnificant positive relationships with OC. The association\nbetween the number of layoffs and OC was negative, but not\nstatistically significant. These findings indicate that eco-\nnomic factors play an important role in OC.\nOrganizational characteristics such as work rules, organi-\nzation policy, and inspiring employees were found to have\nstatistically significant association with OC. Therefore,\ninspiring employees and establishing fair policy and work\nrules can improve employee OC.\nWe found that OC and job satisfaction have statistically\nsignificant strong association with turnover intention, and\nhigh job satisfaction can lower turnover intention and turn-\nover. Perceived pay increases reduce turnover intention, but\nthe number of firms worked increases turnover intention.\nGroup factors were found to be statistically significant in\nturnover intention compared with organizational factors in\nOC. More employee participation in decision making, better\nforeman understanding, and reduction of foreman bias may\nlower turnover intention and turnover. We conclude that\nmanagers need to pay attention to economic, organizational,\nand group factors to improve OC and to reduce turnover\nintention.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nauthors acknowledge the grant received from the funding agency\nReferences\nAlbelson, M.
