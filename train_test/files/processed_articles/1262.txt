Type 2 diabetes leads to a more rapid\ndecline in functional status among older Mexican   with diabetes. This study was\ndesigned to examine the impact of diabetes on change in self-reported functional status over a\n2-year period among older Mexican   with diabetes.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We performed a longitudinal analysis with\nrepeated measurements of functional limitations in a cohort of Mexican   aged 60\nyears in the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA). Diabetes was diagnosed on the\nbasis of self-report of physician diagnosis, medication use, and fasting plasma glucose. Func-\ntional status was measured by assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental\nactivities of daily living (IADL) at baseline and 1 and 2 years.\nsubjects reported 74% more limitations than nondiabetic subjects in ADL (summary score for\ntions of ADL and IADL was 0.046 and 0.033 (log scale) on each scale among diabetic subjects\ncations of diabetes were found to increase ADL and IADL limitations among diabetic subjects.\nLonger duration of diabetes was also associated with an increase in ADL and IADL limitations.\nCONCLUSIONS -- There was lower baseline functional status and a more rapid decline in\nfunctional status among older Mexican   with diabetes versus those without diabetes.\nThe population of Mexican Ameri-\ncans in the U.S. has increased dra-\nmatically over the past several\ndecades due to immigration, high birth\nrates, and markedly reduced mortality\n(i.e., early and middle age). There are now\nan estimated 20 million Mexican Ameri-\ncans in the U.S., of whom 2 million are\nolder than 60 years (1). Diabetes is a ma-\njor clinical and public health challenge\namong Mexican  . Earlier epide-\nmiological studies have shown that older\nMexican   are among the high-\nest-risk groups for diabetes, its complica-\ntions (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy,\nand peripheral vascular disease), and\nother comorbidities (e.g., hypertension)\ncompared with non-Hispanic whites (2\u00ad\n5). Five large-scale epidemiological stud-\nies focusing on Hispanic  \nestablished that the prevalence of diabetes\nwas two to three times greater for Mexican\n  than for non-Hispanic whites\nPatients with diabetes are two to three\ntimes more likely to report disability than\ntheir nondiabetic counterparts (11). Dia-\nbetic subjects 65 years of age averaged\n19.4 days of restricted activity compared\nto only 8.2 days for nondiabetic subjects\n(12). Diabetes as a chronic disease signif-\nicantly limits daily activity in 60% of\ndiabetic people 65 years of age com-\npared with only 33.5% of those without\ndiabetes (12). Disability is associated with\nan increased likelihood for hospitaliza-\ntion, institutionalization, and loss of eco-\nnomic self-sufficiency (13,14). Disabled\npersons with diabetes utilized health care\nservices more frequently than nondis-\nhospitalized in the past year) (15).\nThe impact of diabetes on functional\nlimitations and disability has been ad-\n19). For instance, Haan et al. (19) showed\nthat diabetic subjects 60 years and older,\nespecially Spanish-speaking Hispanics,\nreported a greater number of limitations\nfor activities of daily living (ADL) and in-\nstrumental activities of daily living\n(IADL).

The SALSA participants\nwere recruited from the Sacramento Met-\nropolitan area and four surrounding rural\neligible person was 60 years or older in\nThe sampling frame in SALSA in-\nvolved identifying 1990 census tracts in\nall areas, updating population estimates\nfrom 1998 census sources, and character-\nizing them by the percentage of eligible\nresidents (aged 60, Latino/-a). These\ntracts were ranked in order of percent el-\nigible, and all tracts in which the percent\neligible was at least 5% were selected for\nthe target population. Participants were\ncontacted in three stages: by mail, by\nphone, and finally, by door-to-door\nneighborhood enumeration. Up to 10 at-\ntempts to contact the participants by tele-\nphone were allowed and up to five\nattempts at the household. A separate re-\nport contains a detailed description of the\nsampling frame and recruitment (22).\nData collection\nand was completed in 1999. The first and\nsecond follow-up visits were completed\nSALSA participants were interviewed in\nthe language of choice at baseline and an-\nnually. All data collection, except for neu-\nroimaging, was done at the participants'\nhomes. In a 2-h interview, each partici-\npant answered questions about lifestyle\nfactors, acculturation, and medical diag-\nnosis. A proxy interview was done with\ncaregivers of participants who were\ndeemed too impaired cognitively or oth-\nerwise to respond accurately to interview\nquestions. In total, 5% of the participants\ndied, 4% were lost to follow-up, and 11%\nrefused further follow-up at the end of\nyear 2. This study analyzed change in\nfunctional status from baseline over the 2\nyears of follow-up.\nMeasurement\nDiabetes\nDiagnosis of diabetes was ascertained us-\ning a combination of medical history,\ndrug use, and fasting blood glucose. Data\nwere collected during interview and\nblood sample protocol at baseline and at\nevery annual visit. Participants who met\nany of the following criteria at baseline or\nfollow-up were characterized as having\ndiabetes:\n Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level\ndefined as no caloric intake for at least\n Use of an antidiabetic medication.\n Self-report of a doctor's diagnosis of di-\nabetes.\nDuration of diabetes was ascertained by\nself-report (\"How long have you had this\ncondition?\"). Diabetic complications in-\ncluded self-reported retinopathy and re-\nnal disease. Amputation was assessed by\nobservation during the interview.\nFunctional status\nThis study focused on self-reported func-\ntional status in personal care (basic ADL)\nand household management (IADL)\nmeasure the abilities to walk across a\nsmall room, brush hair or teeth, eat, use\nthe toilet, transfer, dress, and bathe (20).\nIADL comprises 15 items to measure the\nability for household management such\nas prepare meals, do housework, manage\nmoney, and use the telephone (21).\nOther variables\nDiagnosis of hypertension was ascer-\ntained using a combination of medical\nhistory and measured blood pressure.\nParticipants who met either of the follow-\ning criteria were characterized as having\nhypertension:\n systolic pressure 140 mmHg and/or\ndiastolic pressure 90 mmHg; and\n self-report of a doctor's diagnosis of hy-\npertension or high blood pressure.\nStroke was determined by self-report\n(\"Has a doctor ever told you that you had\na stroke?\" followed by \"How many\nmonths or years ago was this?\" and \"Were\nyou hospitalized for this?\"). Stroke in a\nsubsample (n  150) of self-reported\nstroke was validated by medical chart\nreview.\nDepressive symptoms were mea-\nsured with the Center for Epidemiological\nStudies Depression (CES-D) scale (23).\nAcculturation was measured by the Ac-\nculturation Rating Scale for Mexican\n  (ARSMA-II) (24). Weight,\nheight, and waist and hip circumference\nwere measured using standardized in-\nstruments. BMI was calculated as mea-\nsured weight in kilograms divided by\nmeasured height in meters squared. Edu-\ncation, medical insurance, household in-\ncome, smoking status, and alcohol use as\nwell as physical activities were assessed in\nhome visit.\nStatistical methods\nStatistical analysis was performed using\nPC-SAS (version 8.1). Baseline analysis\nwas carried out using 2, linear regres-\nsion, or logistic regression. A longitudinal\nanalysis based on the measurements at\nthree time points was performed using a\ngeneralized estimating equation (GEE). A\n0.05 level of significance was used for all\nthe analyses.\nFor baseline linear regression analy-\nsis, a summary score was created as a con-\ntinuous variable for ADL and IADL\nEach summary score for ADL and IADL\nwas log-transformed to achieve normality\nfor longitudinal analysis. In addition, a bi-\nWu and Associates\nnary response variable (0 and 1) was cre-\nated for logistic regression analysis. The\nresponse probability for the binary ADL\nvariable was defined as probability of re-\nporting difficulty in at least one of seven\nADL items. The response probability for\nthe binary IADL variable was defined as\nprobability of reporting difficulty in at\nleast 3 of 15 IADL items. A high threshold\nfor IADL was used, because a high per-\ncentage of subjects were reporting diffi-\nnondiabetic).\nDiagnosis of diabetes was coded as a\ndichotomous independent variable (0\nand 1). The effect of diabetes on 2-year\nchange in ADL and IADL for each subject\nwas specified by including the variable\ntime in years from baseline through the\nsecond follow-up in the model (0, base-\nline; 1, year 1; and 2, year 2). An interac-\ntion term between diabetes and time was\nused to test the hypothesis that functional\nstatus change varied by diabetes status (a\nsimple linear model was assumed).\nGEE requires missing data com-\npletely at random. Thus, to evaluate the\nmissing data mechanism, the participants\nwere stratified into three groups (re-\nsponded, died, and did not respond), and\nthe outcome variables (e.g., ADL and\nIADL) at baseline were compared in these\nthree groups. The results suggested that\nthe missing data mechanism was not\ncompletely at random (reporting diffi-\nculty performing at least one item for\nADL: responded, 12%; did not respond,\n15%; died, 45%; at least three items for\nIADL: responded, 41%; did not respond,\nMultiple imputation (using proc mi\nand proc mianalyze in SAS) was used to\nimpute missing data in conjunction with\ntion model, which included the demo-\ngraphic variables, socioeconomic status,\nCES-D score, medical history, and out-\ncomes of interest, was essentially the same\nas the analysis model. Any missing data\nfor the summary score of ADL and IADL\nas well as associated covariates were im-\nputed. Five imputed datasets were used in\nthe analysis. The nonrespondents (refus-\nal, dropped, and lost to follow-up) were\nincluded in the imputation, because their\nbaseline values (ADL and IADL) were a\ngood estimate of follow-up values.\nConfounding factors were evaluated,\ndepending on their influence on the main\neffect terms or from the literature. Effect\nmodification by hypertension (stroke or\nage) for the association between diabetes\nand change in functional status over time\nwas assessed by including in the model\nthe three-way interaction term, e.g., dia-\nbetes  time  hypertension.\nIn the subgroup analysis, only dia-\nbetic subjects (n  585) were included,\nand measurements at three time points\nwere analyzed to examine the association\nof diabetic complications (or duration of\ndiabetes) with functional limitations. The\nmodel included time and other covari-\nables. The effect of diabetic complications\n(or duration of diabetes) on change in\nfunctional status over time was not as-\nsessed. Diabetic complication was coded\nas a dichotomous independent variable (0\nand 1). Duration of diabetes was coded as\nRESULTS\nPrevalence of diabetes\nOf 1,788 households initially contacted,\nagreed to participate. Of 1,789 study par-\nticipants, 585 were identified as having\ndiabetes at baseline (32.7%). Among\nself-report plus FPG 126 mg/dl or self-\nreport plus medication use; 10 (2%) by\nself-report alone.

We found\nthat older Mexican   with diabe-\ntes had a higher risk for hypertension,\nstroke, myocardial infarction, kidney dis-\nease, and amputation. Presence of diabe-\ntes and associated complications may lead\nto a significant decline in functional status\namong these patients.\nThe prevalence of functional limita-\ntions among diabetic subjects was found\nto be nearly two times higher than that\namong nondiabetic subjects in our study.\nOur results are comparable with other\nstudies conducted among various ethnic\ngroups, although the criteria used to de-\nfine functional limitations are slightly dif-\nferent across studies. For instance, in the\n(as measured by job performance, ability\nto perform housework, and ADL) were\nnearly two times more common in Mexi-\ncan   with diabetes than in those\nwithout diabetes (28). In a study by\nTucker et al. (11), it was found that dia-\nbetes was more often associated with dis-\nability (as measured in 12-item ADL and\n6-item IADL) among Puerto Ricans aged\n55 years. In another study of inner-city\nblacks, those with diabetes aged 70 years\nand older had higher scores in four assess-\nments related to functional status (as mea-\nsured by general health, IADL, modified\nversions of the Rosow-Breslau scale, and\nthe Sanford Health Assessment Question-\nnaire) than nondiabetic control subjects\nyears) French people living in the com-\nmunity, diabetic subjects more often\nlacked autonomy according to the Katz\nADL Scale and the Lawton IADL Scale\nWe found similar patterns of func-\ntional limitations between and within sex\nsubgroups as reported in a previous study\nof Spanish-speaking Hispanic subjects\nmore limitations than men, and limita-\ntions also increased with age in both dia-\nbetic and nondiabetic subjects.\nThe current study provides the first\nlongitudinal analysis with repeated mea-\nsurements to examine the effect of diabe-\ntes on the decline in functional status\namong older Mexican  . Our re-\nsults support the hypothesis that older\nMexican   with diabetes had a\nsignificantly higher decline rate in their\nfunctional status than their nondiabetic\ncounterparts. There is another 2-year co-\nhort study in older Mexican  \n(30). Although their scope and study de-\nsign were slightly different from ours, our\ndata also showed that the higher CES-D\nscore was associated with higher ADL and\nOur results also indicated that both\ndiabetes-related complications and a\nlonger duration of diabetes contribute to\nthe increase in functional decline among\nthese subjects. Our results are consistent\nHealth Interview Survey, in which dia-\nbetic subjects with complications were\nmore likely to be impaired in their normal\nactivities than those without the chronic\ncomplications of diabetes. In addition,\namputation, sensory neuropathy, kidney\ndisease or proteinuria, angina or any heart\ntrouble, or retinopathy reported limita-\ntion in activities (15).\nFurthermore, the current research\nsupports the causal relationship of diabe-\ntes with functional impairment. This\nstudy using a prospective cohort study\ndesign confirmed the time relationship\nthat exposure (diabetes) precedes out-\ncome (decline in ADL and IADL) in time.\nDiabetic subjects with worse glycemic\ncontrol are more likely to develop com-\nplications, leading to functional impair-\nments. The results suggest that duration\nof diabetes is related to diminished func-\ntional status in a dose-response manner\nwhen controlled for age, sex, household\nincome, BMI, and diabetes-related com-\nplications. Diabetic patients with a longer\nduration of the disease were more likely to\nreport functional limitations than those\nwith a shorter duration. Finally, results\nobtained from the current research were\nin line with prior studies conducted in\ndifferent populations and settings that\ndiabetic subjects had more functional\nlimitations than nondiabetic subjects\nThe findings of this research have im-\nportant implications for the Mexican\nAmerican society. The limitations in ADL\nand IADL, which are commonly used to\nassess disability in basic life activities\namong the population 65 years of age,\ncan be observed as evidence of disability.\nDisability is a major social, economic, and\npublic health issue. Disability is associ-\nated with a greater increase in physician\nvisits, utilization of health care services,\nhospitalization, institutionalization, de-\npendency in basic life activities, and loss\nThese circumstances greatly diminish the\nquality of life of those affected as well as\nincrease the economic burden for individ-\nuals and society.\nAttenuation of diabetes progression\ninto chronic complications could result in\nreduced economic, social, and public\nhealth burden for individuals and society.\nPromoting proper patient education/\nawareness, increasing access to regular\nmedical care, and providing good quality\nof care might help to circumvent some of\nthe problems, especially in communities\nwith lower socioeconomic status. In addi-\ntion, functional status perhaps should be\nconsidered a potential long-term out-\ncome of diabetes when clinicians are car-\ning for their older adult patients with\ndiabetes.\nThis study has several strengths. First,\na population-based sample of older Mex-\nican   was used, which could re-\nsult in generalizability to other older\nMexican-American communities in other\ngeographic localities in the U.S. Second,\nunlike most of the previous studies,\nwhich have substantial underreporting\nrates using self-reported physician-\ndiagnosed diabetes, the current study\nused three diagnostic criteria to decrease\nthe underreporting rate. Third, a repeat-\ned-measure design provides more precise\nestimates for the outcomes of interest\nthan previous cross-sectional studies.\nFourth, a longitudinal study is the best\ndesign to assess functional status change\nover time with regard to diabetes status\nand allow for establishing relative tempo-\nrality of exposure and outcome.\nDiabetes and functional status\n"
