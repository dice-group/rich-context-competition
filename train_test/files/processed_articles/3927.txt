    "abstract": "Abstract\nAcademic debates on union politics in the Global South have tended to focus on\neffective union and solidarity campaigns. Labour struggles, however, do not always\nyield beneficial outcomes for workers. Three decades of neo-liberal policies in Sri\nLanka suggests complexities that labour rights advocates would potentially prefer to\nshy away from. Efforts to re-politicize union rights of labour in an era of economic\nliberalization require us to sharpen our gaze on these ruptures too. Using work-\nplace ethnography in Sri Lanka, this article details the interactions of management\nand labour during a struggle over union formation. It suggests that paying detailed\nattention to the political economy of labour highlights a complex situation in which\nfostering unionization, despite its importance for the collective will of labour, may\nrequire hard work.\n",
