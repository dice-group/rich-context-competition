Interventions to speed\ninitial treatment contact are likely to reduce the bur-\ndens and hazards of untreated mental disorder.\nshows that a high propor-\ntion of people with preva-\nlent mental disorders in the\nUnited States are untreated\ndespite their disorders causing substantial\ndistress and impairment, and despite ef-\nfective treatments being available.1-5 It is of\nconsiderable public health importance to\nuncover modifiable reasons for this lack of\ntreatment. Successful treatment requires\npeople suffering from the disorder to take\na sequence of steps in the help-seeking pro-\ncess.6,7 A critical early step is establishing\ninitial contact with a health care provider\nfollowing first onset of the disorder.

The current report\naddresses this issue by analyzing data from the recently\ncompletedNationalComorbiditySurveyReplication(NCS-\nR).42 We began by constructing cumulative lifetime prob-\nability of treatment contact curves to estimate the current\nlifetime probability of treatment contact for mental dis-\norders and the typical duration of delay. We then exam-\nined socio-demographic predictors of failure and delay in\nmaking initial treatment contact. Because recent changes\nin awareness and management have not occurred uni-\nformly across disorders, with mood disorders in particu-\nlar receiving considerable attention,25 we examined the ex-\ntent and predictors of failure and delay separately for each\nof the core disorders assessed in the NCS-R.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nAs described in more detail elsewhere,43,44 the NCS-R is a nation-\nally representative, multistage clustered area probability sample\nof English-speaking respondents aged 18 years and older in the\nnoninstitutionalized civilian population of the 48 coterminous\nstates. Fieldwork was carried out by the professional survey in-\nterview field staff of the Institute for Social Research at the Uni-\nversityofMichigan,AnnArbor,betweenFebruary2001andApril\nrespondents were administered a part I diagnostic interview of\ncore diagnoses. A subsample of 5692 part I respondents, consist-\ning of all those who met lifetime criteria for a core disorder plus\na probability subsample of other respondents, were also admin-\nistered a part II interview that assessed correlates and disorders\nof secondary focus. The response rate was 70.9%. Interviewers\nexplained the study and obtained verbal informed consent prior\nto beginning all interviews. The NCS-R recruitment, consent, and\nfield procedures were approved by the Human Subjects Com-\nmittees of both Harvard Medical School, Boston, and the Uni-\nversity of Michigan.\nMEASURES\nDiagnostic Assessment\nDiagnoses of DSM-IV disorders were made using the World\nHealth Organization's World Mental Health Survey Initiative\nversion of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview\n(WMH-CIDI),44,45 a fully structured lay-administered diagnos-\ntic interview that generates diagnoses according to the defini-\ntions and criteria of both the ICD-1046 and DSM-IV47 diagnostic\nsystems. Criteria for DSM-IV disorders are used in the current\nreport. The disorders considered in this report include (1) mood\ndisorders, including major depressive episode (MDE), dysthy-\nmia (DYS), and bipolar disorder (BPD) I and II studied together\nfor increased statistical power; (2) anxiety disorders, including\npanic disorder (PD), agoraphobia without panic (AG), specific\nphobia (SP), social phobia (SoP), generalized anxiety disorder\n(GAD),posttraumaticstressdisorder(PTSD),andseparationanxi-\nety disorder (SAD); (3) substance disorders, including alcohol\nabuse(AA),alcoholdependence(AD),drugabuse(DA),anddrug\ndependence (DD); and (4) impulse control disorders, includ-\ning intermittent explosive disorder (IED), oppositional defiant\ndisorder (ODD), and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD).Lifetimeprevalenceandageofonsetwereassessedsepa-\nrately for each disorder.44 It is noteworthy that obsessive-\ncompulsivedisorder(OCD)andconductdisorder(CD)werealso\nassessed in the NCS-R and are included in separate reports in\nsubstantive analyses, but are not included in the current report\nbecause the sample of cases was too small for powerful analysis\nof OCD. This was because OCD was a secondary disorder as-\nsessed in only a fraction of the part II subsample and because\nage of first treatment seeking was not assessed for CD. All diag-\nnoses are considered with organic exclusions and without diag-\nnostichierarchyrules.AsdescribedbyKessleretal,44 ablindclini-\ncal reappraisal study using the Structured Clinical Interview for\nDSM-IV (SCID)48 showed generally good concordance between\nDSM-IV diagnoses based on the WMH-CIDI and the SCID for\nanxiety, mood, and substance disorders. The WMH-CIDI diag-\nnoses of impulse control disorders have not been validated.\nTreatment Contact\nNear the end of each WMH-CIDI diagnostic section, respon-\ndents were asked whether they ever in their life talked to a medi-\ncal doctor or other professional about the disorder under in-\nvestigation. In asking this question, the interviewer clarified\nthat the term \"other professional\" was meant to apply broadly\nto include psychologists, counselors, spiritual advisors, herb-\nalists, acupuncturists, and any other healing professionals. Re-\nspondents who reported ever talking to any of these profes-\nsionals about the disorder in question were then asked how old\nthey were the first time they did so. The response to this ques-\ntion was used to define age of first treatment contact.\nPredictors\nPredictor variables include age at onset of the focal disorder\nyears of age), cohort (defined by age at interview in the cat-\nethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,\nand other), education (categorized as either current students\neducation), and marital status (categorized as either currently\nmarried/cohabitating, previously married, or never married).\nThe last 2 of these predictors vary within a given individual\nover time. Information was obtained in the NCS-R on timing\nof marital histories (ie, ages at marriage and marital dissolu-\ntion), allowing marital status to be coded for each year of each\nrespondent's life. Information on years of education was also\ncoded as a time-varying predictor by assuming an orderly edu-\ncational history for each respondent in which 8 years of edu-\ncation corresponds to being a student up to age 14 years and\nother lengths of education are associated with ages consistent\nwith this benchmark (eg, 12 years of education is assumed to\ncorrespond to being a student up to age 18 years).\nThe data were weighted to adjust for differential probabilities of\nselection of respondents within households and differential non-\nresponse as well as to adjust for residual differences between\nthe sample and the United States population on the cross-\nclassificationofsociodemographicvariables.Anadditionalweight\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

These procedures are de-\nscribed in more detail by Kessler et al.43 As most disorders con-\nsidered here were assessed in part I, cumulative probability of\nlifetime treatment contact curves were estimated using part I\ndata and weights whenever possible. Part II data and weights\nwere used for disorders that were assessed in part II (PTSD, ODD,\nCD, and ADHD). Survival analysis was used to make estimated\nprojections of cumulative lifetime probability of treatment con-\ntact from year of onset. The actuarial method,49 implemented in\nthe Statistical Analysis System version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC),50 was used rather than the more familiar Kaplan-Meier\nmethod51 of generating survival curves because the former has\nan advantage over the latter in estimating onsets within a year.\nSeparate curves were generated for each disorder. The typical du-\nration of delay in initial treatment contact was defined as the me-\ndian number of years from disorder onset to first treatment con-\ntact among cases that eventually made treatment contact based\non these curves. Time to initial treatment contact in the subset\nof respondents with BPD was defined as the duration of time from\nthe initial onset of a manic or hypomanic episode to first treat-\nment of a manic or hypomanic episode. Treatment for MDE in\nthe course of BPD was not considered because the current analy-\nses only focused on treatment seeking for specific syndromes and\nnotforcomorbidconditions.Discrete-timesurvivalanalysis52 with\nperson-year as the unit of analysis was used to examine corre-\nlates of treatment contact separately for each disorder. Predic-\ntors included both time-invariant predictors (age at onset of the\ndisorder, cohort, sex, race/ethnicity) as well as several time-\nvarying predictors (number of years since first onset of the dis-\norder, education, marital status). Each model was estimated twice\nfor a given disorder: once among all respondents with a history\nof the disorder to study the predictors of ever making a treat-\nment contact; and then a second time among the subsample who\neventually made a treatment contact to study the predictors of\ndelay in initial contact. The Taylor series linearization method53\nimplemented in the SUDAAN software system54 was used to ad-\njust for the effects of the weighting and clustering of the NCS-R\ndata on significance tests. Multivariate significance tests in the\ndiscrete-time survival analyses were made with 2 tests using\nTaylor series design-based coefficient variance-covariance ma-\ntrices. Statistical significance was consistently evaluated using\nRESULTS\nSurvival curves were used to make projections of the pro-\nportion of cases who will eventually make treatment con-\ntact for each disorder assessed in the NCS-R.

The most consistent predictors of failure\nto make a treatment contact are cohort and age at onset.\nCohort is significantly related to lifetime treatment con-\nwith the dominant pattern being for treatment contact\nto increase in more recent cohorts. This pattern is even\nstronger (17 of 17 comparisons) in predicting delay in\ntreatment contact among eventual patients. Age of on-\nset is significantly related to treatment contact in 15 of\n17 comparisons, the exceptions being 2 childhood-\nonset disorders (SAD, ADHD), with a consistent pat-\ntern of increasing treatment contact with increasing age\nat onset. A very similar pattern (17 of 17 significant com-\nparisons) is found in predicting delay in treatment among\neventual patients.\nSociodemographic predictors are less consistent.\nWomen have significantly higher odds of treatment con-\ntact than men for 4 of the 17 outcomes (MDE, DYS, BPD,\nSoP), while men never had higher odds than women for\nany outcome. Sex differences are even weaker (1 of 17\ncomparisons significant) in predicting delays. Race/\nethnic differences are significant in 8 of 17 compari-\nsons, with non-Hispanic whites always having higher odds\nof treatment than 1 or more minority groups. This pat-\ntern is weaker in predicting delays (5 of 17 comparisons\nsignificant), even though there are some cases in which\nminorities have significantly shorter delays than non-\nHispanic whites. Education is significant in 8 of 17 com-\nparisons, but the pattern of the association varies con-\nsiderably across outcomes. The most consistent element\nin the pattern is that students generally have higher odds\nof treatment than people who have completed their edu-\ncation. This is quite different from the pattern with re-\nspect to delays among eventual cases (10 of 17 compari-\nsons significant), where college graduates generally have\nthe shortest delays.

A similar pattern (7 of 17 comparisons sig-\nnificant) exists in predicting delays among people who\neventually make treatment contacts.\nCOMMENT\nThe results reported here should be interpreted in light\nof 5 potential limitations. Perhaps the most concerning\nis the possibility of recall failure of lifetime events. If re-\nspondents who did not seek treatment were more likely\neither to forget or to normalize symptoms than respon-\ndents who received treatment, leading to a false-negative\nreportoflifetimedisorder,theprevalenceofdisorderwould\nbe underestimated and the probability of eventual treat-\nment contact would be underestimated. We have no way\nofevaluatingthispossibility,althoughitisnoteworthythat\nin such a case the estimate of the raw number of people\nwith a disorder who had significant delays in initial treat-\nment contact would be conservative.\nA second possibility is that despite accurate reports\nof disorders and treatment contacts occurring, dating was\ninaccurate. As discussed in more detail by Kessler and\nUstun,45 special efforts were made in the NCS-R to help\nrespondents recall age at onset and age at initial treat-\nment contact by asking questions that focused memory\nsearch and bounded recall uncertainty.55 Although it is\nunclear how remaining dating errors would affect re-\nsults, telescoping (recalling past experiences as having\noccurred more recently than they actually did occur) is\nTable 2.

We also did not distin-\nguish between contacts made in health care vs non\u00ad\nhealth care sectors, as we have done in previous analy-\nses of the original NCS.21 As a result, the findings presented\nhere should be interpreted as upper bounds on the pro-\nportions of these cases that received treatment and lower\nbounds on the typical durations of delays until treat-\nment was received. Furthermore, some meaningful pro-\nportion of treated cases received treatment that did not\nmeet minimal standards for treatment adequacy.5 Even\nthough we have no way of pinpointing the specific cases\nthat received inadequate treatment at the point of initial\ntreatment contact, we know that the proportions of cases\nprojected to make eventual treatment contact are greater\nthan the proportions that obtain adequate treatment.\nFourth, predictors of failure and delay in initial con-\ntact were necessarily limited to ones that could be ret-\nrospectively dated. In the socioeconomic domain, for ex-\nample, we considered the effects of educational attainment\nbut not of income, as we had no information about each\nrespondent's income in each year of his or her life. In ad-\ndition, we limited predictors to variables for which a priori\nhypotheses have been raised.18-21 Although categories of\nsome predictors (eg, ages at interview and disorder on-\nset, education) were kept broad so as to contain suffi-\ncient cases, we still may have lacked the statistical power\nto identify important differences (eg, between racial and\nTable 3.

Furthermore, it is important to\nrecognize that even though our outcomes were failures\nand delays in initial treatment contacts, the estimated ef-\nfects of the predictors represent amalgamated effects on\na number of steps in the help-seeking process that lead\nup to making an initial treatment contact, such as be-\ncoming aware of the disorder, perceiving need for treat-\nment, and accessing care.\nFinally, we cannot conclude with certainty how pat-\nterns and predictors of failure and delay have changed over\nthe past decade because the current report on the NCS-R\nof disorders, covariates, and outcomes examined. Even\nsubtle differences between analyses (eg, use of diagnostic\nhierarchy rules) could have important effects. Exploring\ntemporal trends between the NCS and NCS-R remains an\nimportant area for future research.\nWith these limitations in mind, our results docu-\nment 2 types of unmet need for mental health treatment\nin the United States. First, a large number of people never\nmake treatment contacts for the DSM-IV/WMH-CIDI dis-\norders evaluated in the NCS-R. This is especially true for\nsubstance and impulse control disorders, where nearly\nhalf of all lifetime cases failed to make any treatment con-\ntact. Consistent with the finding regarding substance dis-\norders, previous research has shown that people with sub-\nstance disorders often do not perceive a need for treatment,\nactively resist treatment, and do not seek treatment un-\ntil their disorders have become highly debilitating.9,57,58\nThe low proportion of cases that ever seek treatment for\nimpulse control disorders could reflect the perceptions,\nboth on the part of the people with the disorders and of\nsociety at large, that their problems are less relevant to\nthe mental health care system than to other systems (eg,\nsocial services, education, criminal justice). Although im-\npulse control disorders can be highly distressing to oth-\ners, they are often associated with more externalization\nand less internal dysphoria for cases, resulting in less mo-\ntivation for afflicted individuals to seek treatment. The\nfacts that these disorders have only recently become rec-\nTable 4.

The typical delays docu-\nmented here persist for years or even decades for some\ndisorders. This has not been a focus of previous re-\nsearch, as mental health services research has tradition-\nally focused on treatment of current episodes for estab-\nlished cases.8-14 This focus led naturally to a concern with\nlack of treatment rather than with treatment delay. The\nNCS-R findings suggest that this focus needs to be ex-\npanded, as eventual treatment is the typical state of af-\nfairs for most of the disorders considered here, while de-\nlay in initial treatment seeking is pervasive.\nSubstantial inter-disorder variation was found both in\nthe probability of eventually making treatment contacts\nand in typical durations of delay. The pattern of this varia-\ntion is quite consistent with the pattern found in previ-\nous studies of initial treatment contact.18-21 The finding\nof initial treatment contact being higher and delays shorter\nfor mood disorders than other classes of disorders may\nbe because of the fact that mood disorders have been tar-\ngeted by educational campaigns, primary care quality im-\nThe prominent and dysphoric somatic symptoms often\nfound in conjunction with panic disorder may account\nfor the finding that treatment contact is more common\nand occurs more quickly for panic disorder than other\ntypes of anxiety disorder.62,63 Greater failure and delays\nfor some anxiety disorders such as phobias and SAD could\nbe because of their generally early age at onset, fewer as-\nsociated impairments, and even fear of providers or treat-\nments involving social interactions (eg, talking thera-\nShorter delays and higher proportions of cases with\neventual treatment contact in more recent cohorts pro-\nvide grounds for optimism, as they provide some evi-\ndence that patterns of help-seeking have improved in the\nrecent past. This secular change could be, in part, be-\ncause of recent programs that destigmatize and increase\nawareness of mental illness, screening and outreach ini-\ntiatives, the introduction and direct-to-consumer pro-\nmotion of new treatments, and expansion of some in-\nsurance programs,22-41 although a more fine-grained\nmapping of time series information would be needed to\ndocument effects of specific initiatives. Drug depen-\ndence is a notable exception to the general pattern of in-\ncreased treatment in recent cohorts. There are both longer\ndelays and fewer initial contacts in younger cohorts than\nolder ones. Whether this is the result of methodological\n(eg, failure to capture contacts with self-help groups which\nnow play increasingly important roles in the treatment\nof substance disorders) or substantive processes is un-\nclear, although one might expect methodological fac-\ntors to have effects that emerged more consistently across\nthe full range of conditions. To the extent that the pat-\ntern is substantive, it might be because of changes in fund-\ning of drug treatment programs, changes in public atti-\ntudes toward drug dependence, or a combination of those\nfactors.65-67 Given the importance of timely drug treat-\nment, more detailed investigation is warranted.\nWe found that early-onset disorders are consistently\nassociated with longer delays and a lower overall prob-\nability of initial treatment contact. The same pattern has\nconsistently been found in previous studies of delays in\ninitial treatment contact.18-21 Minors may be less likely\nto receive timely treatment because they need the help\nof parents or other adults and recognition is often low\namong these adults unless symptoms are extreme.68,69 In\naddition, child- and adolescent-onset mental disorders\nmight be associated with normalization of symptoms or\nthe development of coping strategies (eg, social with-\ndrawal in social phobias) that interfere with help-\nseeking during adulthood. The paucity of available or ac-\ncessible child mental health services may also be an\nimportant factor.\nMen have been shown in earlier research to be slower\nthan women at translating nonspecific feelings of dis-\ntress into conscious recognition that they have emo-\ntional problems, perhaps explaining the NCS-R finding\nthat males sometimes have longer delays and lower rates\nof treatment contact than women.70,71 The longer delays\nand lower odds of ever making treatment contacts found\namong minorities compared with non-Hispanic whites\nare broadly consistent with findings in earlier studies that\nminorities often receive suboptimal mental health care,2,3,12\nbut we are not aware of any previous research that ex-\nplicitly examined race/ethnic differences in initial treat-\nment contact. Negative attitudes toward treatment on the\npart of minorities could play an important part in ac-\ncounting for these results.72 However, the fact that the\nrace/ethnic differences in delays and eventual treatment\nvary substantially across outcomes suggests that more than\nbroad attitudinal factors are likely to be involved. Greater\nknowledge and financial resources to pay for treatments\ncould help explain the positive associations between edu-\ncation and initial help-seeking for many mental disor-\nders; on the other hand, greater help-seeking for sub-\nstance disorders by those less educated could reflect their\ngreater acceptance and lower financial barriers to addic-\ntion services, many of which are self-help groups.73 Dif-\nficulties forming or maintaining relationships and lack\nof social support from a partner may be strong impe-\ntuses for those not married to rapidly seek mental health\nIt is important to consider whether the delays and fail-\nures to make initial treatment contacts truly pose a pub-\nlic health problem. An alternative view is that they may\nonly characterize less severe, short-lived, or nondebili-\ntating mental disorders.74 However, research in the base-\nline NCS data showed that many people with even se-\nvere and impairing disorders reported substantial delays\nin initial treatment contact.21 Long periods of untreated\nillness may also be harmful to those with less severe dis-\norders. Preclinical studies suggest that neural \"kin-\ndling\" can cause untreated psychiatric disorders to be-\ncome more frequent, severe, spontaneous, and treatment\nrefractory.75 In addition, epidemiological studies sug-\ngest that school failure, teenage child-bearing, unstable\nemployment, early marriage, marital violence, and mari-\ntal instability are associated with early-onset untreated\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

Such trials are just beginning to be\nDespite the absence of definitive data from such long-\nterm outreach treatment trials, the findings reported here\nsuggest that more effort is needed to increase prompt ini-\ntial treatment contacts among people with incident epi-\nsodes of mental disorders. Additional large-scale public\neducation programs (eg, the NIMH Depression, Aware-\nness, Recognition, and Treatment program) and ex-\npanded use of National Screening Days continue to hold\ngreat promise for hastening detection and treat-\nself-report and/or informant scales may be needed to de-\ntect early-onset mental disorders.87,88 Demand manage-\nment and other outreach strategies could also help re-\nduce critical delays and failures in initial help-seeking once\nmental disorders are identified.89,90 Training non\u00ad\nhealth care professionals to recognize individuals with\nmental disorders and make timely referrals for health care\nmay ultimately be needed to alleviate the burdens and\nhazards from untreated mental disorders.\nSubmitted for Publication: June 9, 2004; final revision\nCorrespondence: Philip S.
