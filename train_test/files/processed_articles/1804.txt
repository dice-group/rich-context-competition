Epidemiologic studies of\ncadmium exposure and hypertension, however, have been inconsistent.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the association of blood and urine cadmium with blood\npressure levels and with the prevalence of hypertension in U.S. adults who participated in the\nMETHODS: We studied participants  20 years of age with determinations of cadmium in blood\n(n = 10,991) and urine (n = 3,496). Blood and urine cadmium were measured by atomic absorption\nspectrometry and inductively coupled plasma\u00admass spectrometry, respectively. Systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure levels were measured using a standardized protocol.\nRESULTS: The geometric means of blood and urine cadmium were 3.77 nmol/L and 2.46 nmol/L,\nrespectively. After multivariable adjustment, the average differences in systolic and diastolic blood\npressure comparing participants in the 90th vs. 10th percentile of the blood cadmium distribution\n0.69 mmHg among current smokers. No association was observed for urine cadmium with blood\npressure levels, or for blood and urine cadmium with the prevalence of hypertension.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cadmium levels in blood, but not in urine, were associated with a modest elevation\nin blood pressure levels. The association was stronger among never smokers, intermediate among\nformer smokers, and small or null among current smokers. Our findings add to the concern of renal\nand cardiovascular cadmium toxicity at chronic low levels of exposure in the general population.\nKEY WORDS: Blood pressure, cadmium, hypertension, NHANES, smoking.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate\nwas calculated from calibrated creatinine, age,\nsex, and race/ethnicity using the Modification\nof Diet in Renal Disease Study formula\n(Stevens et al. 2006). Blood lead levels were\nmeasured simultaneously to blood cadmium\nlevels using multielement atomic absorption\nspectrometry with Zeeman background cor-\ncreatinine was determined using a Jaff\u00e9 rate\nreaction measured with a CX3 analyzer\nStatistical analysis. All statistical analyses\nwere performed using the survey package in\nthe R statistical language to account for the\ncomplex sampling design and weights in\nate standard errors for all estimates (Lumley\n2007). Cadmium levels in blood and urine and\nlead levels in blood were right skewed and log-\ntransformed for analyses. We estimated\nadjusted mean differences in blood pressure\nlevels or adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the\nprevalence of hypertension comparing quartiles\n2 to 4 of cadmium to the lowest quartile using\nlinear and logistic regression, respectively.\nQuartile cutoffs were based on weighted distri-\nbutions in the whole study sample. In addition\nto quartiles, we also used linear and logistic\nmodels to compare the 90th with the 10th per-\ncentile of cadmium distribution, assuming a\nlog-linear relationship. Statistical models were\ninitially adjusted for age (restricted cubic spline\ntransformation), sex, race/ethnicity and educa-\ntion. We further adjusted for smoking (never,\nformer, current, and serum cotinine), alcohol\nintake (never, former, current), BMI, use of\nantihypertensive medication, menopause sta-\ntus, and lead exposure. Adjustment for esti-\nmated glomerular filtration rate did not affect\nthe conclusions (data not shown). For urine\ncadmium, all models were adjusted for urine\ncreatinine to account for variations in dilution\nin spot urine samples (Barr et al. 2005).\np-Values for linear trend were obtained by\nincluding log-transformed cadmium levels as\ncontinuous variables in the regression models.\nWe also evaluated the association of blood\nand urine cadmium with blood pressure end\npoints for subgroups defined by sex and\nsmoking status. p-Values for the interactions\nbetween blood and urine cadmium with par-\nticipant characteristics were obtained from\nadding an interaction term between log-\ntransformed cadmium (blood, urine) and the\ncorresponding participant characteristic (sex,\nsmoking status).\nResults\nThe geometric means of blood and urine cad-\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient between\nblood and urine log-cadmium levels was 0. 42\n(p < 0.001).

By smoking\nstatus category (never, current, former), blood\nand urine cadmium levels were generally\nhigher in women than in men.

By smoking status, the\naverage differences in systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure levels comparing participants\nin the 90th with the 10th percentile of the\nblood cadmium distribution were 2.35 mmHg\nand 3.27 mmHg, respectively, among never\namong former smokers; and 0.02 mmHg and\n0.69 mmHg among current smokers. The\nmodification of the associations between\nblood cadmium levels with systolic and dias-\ntolic blood pressure levels were statistically\nsignificant for current smokers compared with\nnever smokers.

There was no association\nbetween cadmium levels and the prevalence\nof hypertension. By smoking status, the asso-\nciation for blood cadmium and blood pres-\nsure levels was stronger among never smokers,\nintermediate among former smokers, and\nsmall or null among current smokers. Both\nurine and blood cadmium are biomarkers of\nlong-term and ongoing cadmium exposure,\nalthough blood cadmium reflects recent expo-\nsure better than urine cadmium (ATSDR\nIn our study, this was confirmed by a stronger\nassociation of blood cadmium compared with\nurine cadmium with current smoking status\nand serum cotinine, a biomarker or recent\nsmoking. Our findings of a positive associa-\ntion of blood cadmium, but not urine cad-\nmium, with blood pressure may indicate that\nblood pressure levels are affected by recent\nrather than long-term cadmium exposure.\nAlternatively, it is possible that blood cad-\nmium reflects biologically active cadmium\nbetter than urine cadmium.\nFew epidemiologic studies have measured\nboth blood and urine cadmium levels. In\nBelgium, the CadmiBel study assessed the\nhealth consequences of environmental cad-\nmium contamination (Staessen et al. 1991,\nand 356 women residing in the two rural areas\nof the CadmiBel study (Staessen et al. 2000),\nchanges in blood cadmium levels between\nlow-up) were positively associated with\nchanges in systolic and diastolic blood pres-\nsure, although the association was statistically\nsignificant only for diastolic blood pressure\namong women. Similar to our study, no asso-\nciation was found between urine cadmium\nand blood pressure levels. The relative risk for\ndeveloping definite hypertension for a dou-\nbling of baseline blood cadmium levels was\nbling of baseline urine cadmium levels it was\n2000). Because blood or urine cadmium were\nnot associated with increased blood pressure\nlevels in cross-sectional analyses of all\n(Staessen et al. 1991) and the prospective asso-\nciation was only statistically significant for\ndiastolic blood pressure among women\n(Staessen et al. 2000), the prospective associa-\ntion between changes in blood cadmium and\nblood pressure found in this study were\nconsidered uncertain.\nOther studies of cadmium and blood pres-\nsure have measured only urine or blood cad-\nmium, with inconsistent findings. In the\nUnited States, a subsample of 951 adults who\nfound a positive but modest association of\nurine cadmium with blood pressure levels\n(Whittemore et al. 1991). Other studies have\nbeen smaller and their findings were subject to\nsubstantial random variability (Beevers et al.\n1991). Finally, in a cadmium-polluted area in\nJapan, 52 women with Itai-Itai disease had\nlower systolic and diastolic blood pressure lev-\nels compared with 104 age-matched women\nliving out of the cadmium-polluted area\n(Kagamimori et al. 1986). Indeed, despite\nimportant nephrotoxicity, hypertension has\nnot been reported as a typical finding in Itai-\nItai disease patients in the cadmium-polluted\nTellez-Plaza et al.\nTable 4.

The pos-\nsible relevance of findings from populations\nheavily exposed to cadmium to explain the\nnull or even possible inverse association\nbetween urine cadmium levels and blood pres-\nsure end points in our study is unknown.\nCadmium exposure induces hypertension\nalthough the mechanisms for cadmium-\nrelated hypertension remain unclear. A pri-\nmary mechanism for cadmium toxicity is\ndepletion of glutathione and alteration of\nsulfhydryl homeostasis (Valko et al. 2005),\nthus indirectly increasing oxidative stress\nand lipid peroxidation (Yiin et al. 1999).\nCadmium induces renal proximal tubular\ninjury, salt retention, and volume overload\nwhich may produce hypertension (Satarug\net al. 2006). Other potential mechanisms\ninclude partial agonism for calcium channels\n(Varoni et al. 2003), direct vasoconstrictor\naction, activation of the sympathetic nervous\nsystem, and inhibition of vasodilator sub-\nstances such as nitric oxide (Bilgen et al.\nlevels used in experimental models are much\nhigher than exposure in the U.S. general pop-\nulation, the relevance of these mechanisms to\nhuman hypertension is uncertain.\nCadmium is absorbed through the respira-\ntory and digestive tracts. Under conditions of\nchronic exposure, cadmium is transported in\nblood bounded mainly to metallothionein.\nMetallothionein is a low-molecular-weight\nmetal-binding protein induced by cadmium\nexposure that plays an important role in\ncadmium metabolism and toxicokinetics\nmetallothionein depends on the dose and fre-\nquency of cadmium exposure. For instance,\nsmokers may be more likely to induce metal-\nlothionein because they are repeatedly exposed\nto cadmium from cigarette smoke. By binding\ncadmium, metallothionein may protect the kid-\nneys and other organs from the toxic effects of\ncadmium (Nordberg et al. 1992). In the renal\ncortex, cadmium\u00admetallothionein compounds\nare stored in tubular cells with only a minor\nproportion of the body burden being excreted\nthrough urine (ATSDR 1999). As a result, cad-\nmium progressively accumulates with age in the\nkidney and other organs, although autopsy\nstudies have shown that cadmium concentra-\ntion in the kidneys decreases after 45\u00ad50 years\nof age (Nordberg et al. 2007; Satarug et al.\nfluctuations in cadmium exposure result in\nblood cadmium fluctuations, few changes are\nobserved in urine cadmium which, in the\nabsence of tubular damage, reflects cadmium\naccumulation in the body over time (Nordberg\net al. 1992). Experimental studies at low expo-\nsure levels are needed to determine the impact\nof short- versus long-term cadmium exposure\non blood pressure and the relevance of metal-\nlothionein induction.\nThe findings of our study must be inter-\npreted with caution. First, single blood and\nurine cadmium measurements may be limited\nto fully assess cadmium exposure and cad-\nmium internal dose. Cadmium levels in blood\nwere low, close to the instrument limit of\ndetection and with most participants having\nlevels over a small number of values. For\nurine cadmium, the use of spot urine samples\nand the limitations of using creatinine to\nadjust for urine dilution (Barr et al. 2005)\nmay have amplified this problem. Blood and\nurine cadmium levels are thus subject to sub-\nstantial within-person error and may also be\naffected by other participants' characteristics.\nGiven that cadmium is a well-established\nnephrotoxicant even at low levels of chronic\nexposure (\u00c5kesson et al. 2005), underestima-\ntion of the potential effects of cadmium on\nblood pressure and hypertension is a concern.\nMetallothionein levels, which could explain\npart of the variability of the association of\ncadmium with blood pressure end points,\nwere not determined in NHANES.\nSecond, additional limitations of our\nstudy include the cross-sectional design and\nthe difficulty in adjusting for some potential\nconfounders, including socioeconomic status,\neducation, or other exposures that may occur\nin the same environmental settings. However,\nour results persisted after adjustment for edu-\ncational level, race/ethnicity, smoking status,\nserum cotinine levels, and blood lead levels.\nFinally, the modification of the associa-\ntion of blood cadmium with blood pressure\nlevels by smoking status was the result of a\npost hoc analysis. Potential explanations\ninclude markedly different sources, routes,\nand patterns of cadmium exposure for smok-\ners versus nonsmokers, unknown differences\nin participant characteristics or co-exposures\nby smoking status, and random variability.\nAmong smokers, blood cadmium is likely to\nbe a marker of smoking intensity, and other\ncomponents in tobacco smoke could con-\ntribute to these differences. Indeed, smokers\nhave generally lower blood pressure levels\nMikkelsen et al. 1997), and among smokers,\nhigher levels of serum cotinine have been\nassociated with lower blood pressure levels\nConclusion\nAt the low levels of cadmium exposure\na modest but positive association between\nblood cadmium and blood pressure levels.\nThe association of blood cadmium but not of\nurine cadmium with elevated blood pressure\ncould be related to recent cadmium exposure\nhaving a short-term effect on blood pressure\nlevels. Also, blood cadmium could more read-\nily reflect biologically active cadmium. These\ninterpretations require testing in experimental\nsettings at the relevant levels of exposure. Our\nfindings add to the concern on renal and car-\ndiovascular cadmium toxicity at chronic low\nlevels of exposure (\u00c5kesson et al. 2005;\nsupport the need for efforts to reduce envi-\nronmental cadmium exposure in the general\npopulation.\nREFERENCES\n\u00c5kesson A, Lundh T, Vahter M, Bjellerup P, Lidfeldt J,\nNerbrand C, et al. 2005.
