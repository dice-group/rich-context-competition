Unfortunately, there is little\ninformation to suggest how, in terms of composition\nand experience, family caregiving has changed over\ntime. The National Long-Term Care Survey\n(NLTCS) and its accompanying Informal Caregiver\nSurvey represent a rich, nationally representative\nsource of information regarding both caregivers and\nthe disabled older adults in their care. A national\nprofile of caregivers to frail elders was previously\npublished from this data source, although this profile\nwas based on data that are now more than 20 years\nold (Stone, Cafferata, & Sangl, 1987). Since then, two\nadditional waves of the NLTCS and its Informal\nCaregiver Survey have been fielded. In this study we\nCaregiver Survey to update the profile of primary\ninformal caregivers to disabled older adults, and to\nexamine changes in the composition and experience\nof this group across a 10-year period.\nAt this juncture there is a particularly great need\nfor comprehensive information about caregivers\nto older adults. First, increases in longevity (Fed-\neral Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics,\n2004), declining household size (U.S. Census Bureau,\n2005), and a general shortage of direct health care\nworkers (Buerhaus, Staiger, & Auerbach, 2000) col-\nlectively point to fewer caregivers for growing num-\nbers of older adults in the coming years. Recent\nreports of declines in unpaid assistance and greater\nreliance on paid help (Liu, Manton, & Aragon, 2000;\nSpillman & Pezzin, 2000) underscore the practical\nimplications of this issue. Moreover, estimates of the\neconomic value provided by family caregivers range\nfrom $45 billion to more than $200 billion annually\n(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\nand highlight potential financial consequences to\nsociety should the efforts of family caregivers be\nincreasingly replaced with paid assistance.\nThis project was funded by the National Institutes of Health/\nunrestricted grant from Pfizer.

For example, changes\nto Medicare's acute and postacute reimbursement\nhave created incentives to discharge medically com-\nplex patients back to the community (and, there-\nfore, to their caregivers) ``quicker and sicker.'' The\n1990 Americans with Disabilities Act and the later\nSupreme Court Olmstead v. LC (1999) ruling repre-\nsent a broad societal shift toward ``rebalancing'' the\nlong-term-care system to reduce institutional care and\nshift resources to community settings. Related federal\ninitiatives, such as New Freedom and the National\nFamily Caregiver Support Program, have implications\nfor family caregivers (Feinberg & Newman, 2004;\nRosenbaum, 2001), yet without empirical data it is\nimpossible to monitor the collective impact of these\nprograms.\nRecent studies have drawn on the NLTCS to\nexamine issues related to disability and personal\ncare; however, these studies have largely examined\nthe changing dynamics of disability, or the totality\nof assistance received by recipients (Liu et al., 2000;\nStone & Kemper, 1989). This study is unique in\nthat its focus is on caregivers to disabled older\nadults. Our goal is to describe, for the two time\ndisabled older adults' primary informal caregivers,\nincluding their sociodemographic characteristics; the\nintensity, frequency, duration, and scope of assis-\ntance they provide; the provision of help from others;\nthe competing demands for their time; and the recip-\nients to whom they provide assistance.\nMethods\nData\nData for this study were drawn from two linked\nnational surveys that together provide information\nregarding both disabled older adults (the NLTCS)\nand their primary caregivers (the Informal Caregiver\nSurvey). The NLTCS is a nationally representative\nsurvey of Americans aged 65 years and older that\nwas specifically designed to study the prevalence of\nchronic disability (Manton, Corder, & Stallard,\nfiles constituted the sampling frame, and screening\ninterviews were conducted to determine eligibility\nfor a detailed interview. Among individuals who\nwere screened, all who were identified as chronically\ndisabled (indicated by institutional residence or\nhaving any problem with activities of daily living,\ni.e., ADLs, or instrumental activities of daily living,\ni.e., IADLs, that had lasted or was expected to last at\nleast 3 months) as well as a subsample of unimpaired\nindividuals were selected for a detailed interview.\nThe NLTCS was first conducted in 1982 and has\nThe Informal Caregiver Survey was conducted\namong informal primary caregivers to community-\n1999. Eligible caregivers included relatives or unpaid\nnonrelatives who had provided one or more hours\nof help to NLTCS participants with ADL or IADL\nactivities in the week prior to the community\ninterview. When more than one helper met eligibility\ncriteria, the primary caregiver was designated as the\nhelper who provided the greatest number of hours\nof ADL assistance to the participant in the previous\nweek, or if no ADL help was provided, the helper\nwho provided the greatest hours of help with IADL\ntasks. Primary caregivers were questioned on a vari-\nety of topics, including the nature and intensity of\nhelp provided to recipients, help provided by others,\nperceptions of their role in providing help, living\narrangements, employment, and income.\nIdeally, in our analyses we would have drawn on\nall three waves of the Informal Caregiver Survey, but\nseveral modifications to its design impede compar-\nisons between the 1982 survey and later waves. Most\nnotably, the 1982 Informal Caregiver Survey was\nrestricted to ADL caregivers (i.e., IADL caregivers\nwere excluded), but it included both primary and\nincluded both ADL and IADL caregivers, but these\nwaves were restricted to primary caregivers (i.e.,\nsecondary caregivers were excluded). For these\nreasons, our analyses focus on a comparison of the\nStudy Populations: Defining Disabled Elderly\nCare Recipients and Their Primary Caregivers\nnecessitate careful attention to the construction of\ncomparable study samples. One consideration for\ncross-wave comparisons is that the 1989 Informal\nCaregiver Survey targeted eligible caregivers only\nfor a subsample of NLTCS participants. Specifically,\nin 1989, a subsample of all participants who were\nas the sample from which Informal Caregiver Survey\ninterview participants would be drawn (pending\neligibility). Given our interest in making compar-\nto comprehensively understand sampling strategies\nemployed by the NLTCS and Informal Caregiver\nSurvey across the two time periods. To evaluate\nand address potential threats to study-sample com-\nparability, we undertook a careful review of per-\ntinent issues.\nIn this study, we identified chronically disabled\ncare recipients as individuals who both (a) screened\ninto the NLTCS as chronically disabled and (b)\nindicated that they received active or standby help\nwith at least one ADL activity (eating, bathing,\ndressing, toileting, transferring, and moving about\nindoors), or received help with at least one IADL\ntask (grocery shopping, transportation, laundry,\nlight housework, money management, meal prepa-\nration, telephone use, medication management,\nand outdoor mobility) that they could not perform\nas a result of a health problem or disability. We\nspecified these criteria because a proportion of\nInformal Caregiver Survey respondents indicated\nproviding assistance to individuals who were not\nidentified as chronically disabled in the NLTCS\nscreener interview. Additionally, the Informal Care-\ngiver Survey eligibility criteria did not distinguish the\nreason caregivers provided assistance, and some\nInformal Caregiver Survey respondents were helping\nNLTCS participants for reasons other than a health\nproblem or disability. Failing to clearly specify\nchronic disability and the underlying reason for\nhelp in defining the recipients of care could im-\npede consistency in study-sample selection across\nyears.\nFor the purposes of this study, primary caregivers\nwere identified as relatives or unpaid nonrelatives\nproviding ADL or IADL help to a chronically dis-\nabled older adult as defined herein. As discussed,\ncaregivers were excluded in this study if they were\nfound to be providing help to individuals who were\nnot chronically disabled, or if they provided help\nfor reasons other than a health problem or disability.\nHowever, in some instances caregivers were ex-\nSurvey study samples but were considered primary\ninformal caregivers for the purposes of this study.\nThis discrepancy arose from two distinct data issues.\nFirst, eligibility for the Informal Caregiver Survey\nwas contingent on the reported provision of one or\nmore hours of help in the week prior to the detailed\ncommunity interview. When information on hours\nwas missing, for example, if the number of hours was\nunknown, otherwise eligible primary caregivers were\nexcluded from the Informal Caregiver Survey study\nsample. In this study we have included otherwise\neligible primary caregivers with missing hours; they\nare included with other nonrespondents (rather than\nbeing considered ineligible) and weighted accordingly\nin analyses of caregivers. This issue is relevant to\nthe comparability of estimates across years, because\nmissing helper hours was more pervasive and\ntherefore disproportionately influential in 1999 rela-\nA second and more difficult challenge arose\nconcerning chronically disabled individuals who\nreported receiving assistance but for whom helper\npayment status and relationship were not recorded.\nAs a result, whether the primary caregiver was\ninformal could not be determined. The proportion of\nchronically disabled community-dwelling elderly\nwith helpers of indeterminate eligibility status was\nThese individuals were judged to be not eligible for\nthe Informal Caregiver Survey. In this study, we\naddressed this issue by presenting two sets of\nestimates regarding characteristics of chronically\ndisabled older people who received help: one that\nexcluded individuals with helpers of indeterminate\neligibility, and another set that included individuals\nwith helpers of indeterminate eligibility. Information\nregarding caregiver characteristics necessarily ex-\ncludes helpers of indeterminate eligibility.\nTable 1 provides weighted and unweighted\nestimates of chronically disabled community-\ndwelling older adults and their helper status. These\ndata indicate that the overall population of chron-\nically disabled community-dwelling older adults\n1999.

Although the\nNLTCS-detailed community weights served as the\nstarting point for the caregiver weights in both years,\nthe methods by which the caregiver weights were\nconstructed differed. Specifically, in 1999 a nonre-\nsponse adjustment was made that accounted for\ndifferences in response status by recipients' age,\ngender, and disability. The 1989 caregiver weights\ndid not include a nonresponse adjustment but were\ninflated by a constant factor to account for the\nselection of a subsample of the NLTCS-screened\npopulation from which those eligible for the Informal\nCaregiver Survey were identified. In both years, the\ncaregiver weights released with the data included\nweights for caregivers to individuals who were\nunimpaired at the time of the screening interview as\nwell as individuals who were receiving help for\nreasons other than disability.\nTo ensure comparability across time periods, new\ncaregiver weights were constructed for this study. In\nboth years, detailed community weights for NLTCS\nrespondents who met study disability criteria were\nthe starting point. A nonresponse adjustment was\napplied to the weights in both years, using the 1999\napproach (response status of recipients by age, i.e.,\ndisability level, i.e., IADLs only, one or two ADLs,\nthree or four ADLs, and five or six ADLs). In\naddition, we defined nonrespondents to include not\nonly those caregivers who were targeted and did not\ncomplete the Informal Caregiver Survey interview,\nbut also caregivers who were not designated as eli-\ngible for interview because hours of help were not\nrecorded (discussed in earlier paragraphs and in\nTable 1).

The magnitude of this change was smaller\nbut remained significant when we included individ-\nuals with helpers of unknown eligibility, because\nthese individuals tended to be less disabled.\nFocusing on older adults with primary caregivers\neligible for this study (the sample of interest for all\nremaining analyses) in 1999, we found that recipients\nwere, on average, 80 years of age and were pre-\nwidowed (45.1%), and most often lived with a spouse\n(25.4%). Recipients reported a substantial burden of\ndisability; 72.4% received task assistance with one or\nmore ADLs and 25.6% received assistance with five\nor six ADLs.\nWho Are the Primary Caregivers?\nThe proportion of spouse primary caregivers was\nrelatively stable across the decade of interest, but the\nproportions of child and other primary caregivers\nshifted, with children being more likely to take on\nprimary caregivers were older than 65 years of age,\nwith 47.4% of spousal primary caregivers being\nof primary caregivers were female, although male\ncaregivers were increasingly represented across all\nrelationship types over the decade of interest (p ,\n.10). The distribution of primary caregivers' marital\nstatus, self-rated health, and distance to recipients'\nresidence was generally stable within relationship\ntypes across the two time periods. More than 95%\nof all primary caregivers lived within 30 min of\nrecipients in both years; this close proximity likely\nreflects the high disability levels and related needs of\ndisabled older care recipients.\nTypes and Intensity of Caregiver Assistance\nAlthough there was long-standing primary care-\ngiver involvement that required substantial time\ncommitments at both points in time, there were some\nnotable shifts (Table 4). In particular, there were\nsignificant increases in the proportion of caregivers\nproviding help on a daily basis, and decreases in the\nproportion providing help fewer than three days per\nweek, with both trends being most notable among\nchildren. While fewer than one in five caregivers had\nbeen providing help for less than 1 year at either time\npoint, a significantly greater proportion of arrange-\nments were of shorter duration in 1999, a trend that\nwas evident across all relationship types but that was\nmost pronounced among children (p , .10). Lastly,\nalthough spousal caregivers continued to provide\nhelp with the same frequency in both time periods,\nthey were generally less likely to provide more than\n40 hr of help and more likely to provide fewer than\nPrimary caregivers most commonly reported pro-\nviding help with shopping or transportation (85.3%)\nand household tasks (77.7%), but high levels of\nassistance were evident across all tasks.

For\nexample, 31.6% of primary caregivers were em-\namong spouses to a high of 50.4% among children.\nApproximately half of the employed primary care-\ngivers experienced some level of work conflict in\nterms of rearranging their work schedules, working\nfewer hours, or taking time off without pay. These\ntrends were fairly constant during the two time\nperiods, with the exception of employment and work\nconflict among spouses, both of which declined over\nthe decade of interest.\nPerhaps the most notable secular trend was the\nstriking increase across all relationships in the\nproportion of primary caregivers ``going it alone''\nwithout help from family, friends, or paid caregivers.\nThe proportion of primary caregivers without any\nhelp from others increased significantly from 34.9%\ngivers who received help from family or friends de-\nproportion who relied on paid assistance either alone\nor in conjunction with unpaid help declined from\nTable 2.

By 1999, nearly one third of recipients were\nat least 85 years of age and more than one in four\nrecipients were disabled in five or six ADL activities.\nIn light of increases in the recipients' levels of\ndisability, the observed increases in the proportion of\nprimary caregivers who reported going it alone were\nparticularly striking. The percentage of primary\ncaregivers serving as sole caregivers increased from\nassistance from secondary caregivers evident for\nfamily and friends, as well as paid helpers. These\nfindings must be interpreted with caution in light of\nthe high proportion of disabled older adults in 1999\nwho reported receiving help but whose helpers\nwere excluded from the study as a result of missing\ninformation on payment status and relationship.\nHowever, we found that this trend persisted even\nunder the conservative assumption that all uniden-\ntified helpers were informal primary caregivers with\nsecondary caregiver involvement. Declining second-\nary caregiver involvement has been reported by\nothers (Spillman & Pezzin, 2000), and it has many\npossible causes, including greater geographic mobil-\nity, greater female workforce participation, increas-\ning reliance on child primary caregivers who may\nhave previously provided secondary support, and\nenvironmental and technologic changes (e.g., assis-\ntive technology) that may generally diminish a\nperson's need for human help.\nDeclines in the proportion of primary caregivers\nwith secondary helpers who were paid also were\ninconsistent with earlier evidence suggesting greater\nreliance on paid care among family caregivers (Liu\npercentage of chronically disabled older adults\nrelying on a paid primary caregiver increased slightly\nover this time period, after taking into account\ntrends in secondary paid help, we found that paid\nhelp declined overall. The time period of interest in\neach analysis is an important consideration. Studies\nshowing increased reliance on paid care (Liu et al.;\nSpillman & Pezzin) examined time periods prior to\n1997, when financing of Medicare's home-health\nbenefit shifted from cost-based to prospective re-\nimbursement. There is strong evidence that changes\nto the financing of Medicare's home-health benefit\ndecreased services overall and shifted the mix of\nhome-health services away from personal care\nservices and toward skilled care (McCall, Korb,\nPetersons, & Moore, 2003; Murtaugh, McCall,\nMoore, & Meadow, 2003). Although changes in\nMedicare reimbursement may have contributed to\nobserved declines in paid help, establishing such\na relationship is beyond the scope of these data.\nChanging Caregiver Experiences\nThe information presented herein confirms broad\ndifferences in the caregiving experience by virtue\nof relationship. In particular, spousal primary care-\ngivers were most likely to serve as sole caregivers\nTable 5.

Child primary caregivers were most\nlikely to face the challenge of juggling caregiving\nresponsibilities along with either work or child-\nrearing. It has been posited that the role of primary\ncaregiver is typically assumed in a hierarchy: first\nspouses, then children, and finally other relatives or\nfriends (Shanas, 1979). Our findings are generally\nconsistent with this hypothesized hierarchy, al-\nthough there was a shift over the decade of interest\ntoward representation of men and greater reliance\non children. Interestingly, these data also indicate\nthat other primary caregivers were more likely to\nprovide help of greater intensity, both in terms of\nhours of care and types of tasks (e.g., personal\nlittle detail was available regarding the specific\nrelationship of these other primary caregivers to\nrecipients.\nIt is counterintuitive that, in the face of significant\nincreases in disability among recipients and decreases\nin the proportion of primary caregivers with sec-\nondary helpers, the average hours of help provided\nby primary informal caregivers decreased from\ndata indicate that given the greater task needs of\nrecipients, primary caregivers have shifted the nature\nand frequency of assistance provided.

Growth in assisted living\nas a residential arrangement also could partially ac-\ncount for fewer caregivers in this particular study, in\nthat individuals living with three or more unrelated\nindividuals in settings with medical supervision were\ntargeted for the NLTCS institutional interview and\nwere therefore excluded from the Informal Caregiver\nSurvey. Other plausible causes include increased use\nof technology or assistive devices, or changes to the\nbuilt environment that might simplify some tasks and\ndiminish a person's need for human help. Whether\nthese observed declines reflect increased unmet need\nalso is an important question and cannot be ruled out.\nLimitations\nIt is important to emphasize that this study was\nrestricted to primary informal caregivers rather than\nall informal caregivers who provide assistance to\ndisabled older adults. That said, it is recognized\nthat primary caregivers typically provide higher levels\nof assistance than other caregivers (Donelan et al.,\nthe extent that primary caregivers provide help with\nthe greatest intensity, are more likely to coreside with\nrecipients (Stone et al.), and may serve as the critical\nlink in maintaining community residence, they are an\nimportant target for government, health plan, or\nemployer policies that provide financial support or\nother assistance to caregivers.\nThe findings of this study vary from other reports\nof family care in several important ways. First, the\nstudy is restricted to assistance provided to disabled\nolder adults living in the community rather than the\nentirety of individuals of all ages and in all settings\nwho require assistance with daily tasks. Second, this\nstudy draws from a well-defined target population of\nindividuals receiving assistance and primary care-\ngivers actively providing help. Because of these\nissues, the number of caregivers identified here as\nproviding assistance is substantially lower than has\nbeen reported elsewhere (DHHS, 1998; National\nAlliance for Caregiving [NAC] & AARP, 2004).\nDespite differences in definitions of family care-\ngiving, our findings are consistent with other\npublished reports in several respects. For example,\nthe disproportionate representation of women,\nspouses, and children among primary caregivers as\nwell as the reported duration and intensity of\nassistance are comparable with the findings of other\nStone et al., 1987). Findings related to the extent to\nwhich primary caregivers were employed (NAC &\nAARP) or living at a distance are lower than has\nbeen reported elsewhere (Donelan et al.; NAC &\nAARP), but they are not unreasonable given the high\nlevels of disability in the sample population. The\nfinding that about half of all employed caregivers\nexperienced some level of work conflict is consistent\nwith other studies describing the considerable\neconomic and personal consequences that often\naccrue to employed family caregivers (Covinsky\ntook care to construct comparable study samples\nand to provide transparency in the treatment of po-\ntential threats to comparability posed by sampling\nand data-collection processes of the NLTCS and\nInformal Caregiver Survey. Nonetheless, different\nassumptions regarding the construction of the study\nsamples and the eligibility of helpers of indetermi-\nnate eligibility could change the magnitude of study\nfindings. For example, weighted estimates indicate\nthat the proportion of primary caregivers without\nsecondary caregiver involvement increased from\nanalyses based on the most extreme assumption that\nall helpers of indeterminate eligibility were in fact\neligible informal primary caregivers and that all had\nsecondary caregiver involvement reduced the mag-\nnitude of this difference from 18% to 8%. Similarly,\nsensitivity analyses related to key findings regarding\ndeclining numbers of primary caregivers and in-\ncreasing disability levels of chronically disabled older\ncare recipients persisted under the most conservative\nassumptions, albeit reduced in magnitude (Table 1).\nThus, despite a number of important data issues,\nwe believe the general trends reported here are\nrobust to the most obvious concerns regarding cross-\nwave comparisons.\nPolicy Implications\nThis comprehensive profile of primary caregivers\nand the disabled older adults to whom they provide\nassistance has considerable relevance to policy\nmakers charged with crafting sustainable long-\nterm-care systems. The cost of long-term care in\n(Congressional Budget Office, 1999). These figures\nare particularly impressive in that they exclude all\naccounting of family caregivers' efforts. The impli-\ncations of reductions in family caregivers' help could\nbe enormous. Other countries have moved to ex-\nplicitly recognize and reward family care as part of\nthe long-term-care continuum (Geraedts, Heller, &\nHarrington, 2000). There is some momentum in this\ncountry toward adopting consumer-directed models\nthat afford greater flexibility in directing payments\nto nonagency caregivers, including family, though\nefforts thus far have largely been concentrated\nwithin the Medicaid program (Benjamin, 2001;\nFoster, Brown, Phillips, & Carlson, 2005; Foster,\nBrown, Phillips, Schore, & Carlson, 2003).\nThe National Family Caregiver Support Program\nis the first federal initiative to explicitly recognize\nand support family caregivers. Stated goals of the\nprogram include dissemination of information to\ncaregivers so that they may better access supportive\nservices, organization of support groups, as well as\nthe provision of individual counseling, training, respite\ncare, and other supplemental services on a limited\nbasis. National program funding totals $155 million,\nwhich is small relative to the estimated contributions\nof family caregivers (e.g., Arno, Levine, & Memmott,\nconsiderable variability in the program administration,\ndesign, and service delivery of the National Family\nCaregiver Support Program, but that it has increased\nawareness of family caregivers (rather than only\nrecipients) as legitimate consumers of community\nIn fact, looking more broadly than the National\nFamily Caregiver Support Program, there is little\nconsensus regarding how to best support caregivers.\nNumerous caregiver interventions have cumulatively\nfailed to generate a strong evidence base about how to\nbest train and support caregivers in their diverse roles\n(Knight, Lutzky, & Macofsky-Urban, 1993; Soren-\nsen, Pinquart, & Duberstein, 2002; Zarit, Gaugler, &\nJarrott, 1999). In addition, most intervention studies\nhave targeted narrow populations of caregivers who\nprovide assistance to individuals with a specific index\nlimiting the ability to translate study findings more\nbroadly. Fragmented financing, multiple points of\nentry, variable service offerings, and lack of a stan-\ndardized approach to caregiver assessment cumula-\ntively impede family caregivers' access and use of\nexisting community services.\nThis study confirms the commitment and contri-\nbutions of primary informal caregivers to caring for\ndisabled older adults living in the community.\nMoreover, findings indicate that despite substantial\nincreases in age and disability among care recipients,\nthere were striking increases in the proportion of\nprimary caregivers providing assistance alone. These\ndata, in conjunction with projected increases in the\nnumbers of older people living with chronic illness\nand disability, underscore the importance of im-\nproving our understanding of what approaches most\neffectively sustain family caregivers. The findings\nindicate a very real need to systematically and\ncomprehensively monitor family caregiving and the\nimpact of caregiver-support initiatives in the coming\nyears.\nReferences\nArno, P., Levine, C., & Memmott, M.
