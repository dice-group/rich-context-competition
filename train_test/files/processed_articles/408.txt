The NHANES data show that eight of 10 US adults are exposed to detectable levels of chloroform.\nMedian (1.13 mg/m3), upper percentile (95th, 12.05 mg/m3), and cancer risk estimates were similar to those from recent US regional studies. Significant\npredictors of log personal air chloroform in our model (R2 \u00bc 0.34) included age, chloroform concentrations in home tap water, having no windows open\nat home during the sampling period, visiting a swimming pool during the sampling period, living in a mobile home/trailer or apartment versus living in a\nsingle family (detached) home, and being Non-Hispanic Black versus Non-Hispanic White, although the race/ethnicity estimates appear influenced by\nseveral outlying observations. Reported showering activity was not a significant predictor of personal air chloroform, possibly due to the wording of the\nNHANES shower question. The NHANES measurements likely underestimate true inhalation exposures since subjects did not wear sampling badges\nwhile showering or swimming, and because of potential undersampling by the passive monitors. Research is needed to quantify the potential difference.\nKeywords: chloroform personal air inhalation risk.\nIntroduction\nChloroform is a colorless, volatile liquid that is sparingly soluble\nin water and moderately lipophilic (Lide, 1996). Natural\nsources including sea water and soil processes account for 90%\nof emissions (Keene et al., 1999) while anthropogenic sources\ninclude releases from drinking water and wastewater treatment,\ncertain industrial processes, cooling towers, and swimming\npools (McCulloch, 2003). Most chloroform in the environment\npartitions to air, with the global average atmospheric\nIn mammals, inhaled chloroform is metabolized in the\nliver, kidney, and nasal mucosa to trichloromethanol, which\ndegrades to phosgene (US Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA, 2001a)). Phosgene reacts with nucleophilic groups on\nenzymes and proteins to form cytotoxic adducts (EPA,\n2001a). There is no current evidence of long-term bioaccu-\nmulation in humans (EPA, 2001a). Although an inhalation\nreference concentration has not been published, EPA\npublished an oral reference dose of 0.01 milligrams per\nkilogram body weight per day (mg/kg-d) based on animal\nevidence of hepatotoxicity (EPA, 2007). EPA classifies\nchloroform as a probable human carcinogen based on animal\nstudies showing that inhalation or ingestion at cytotoxic\ndoses produces hepatic and renal neoplasia (EPA, 2001a).\nEPA has published an inhalation unit risk of 2.3 \u00c2 10\u00c05 per\nmg/m3 and estimated air concentrations of 4 mg/m3,\nThe California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA)\n(CalEPA, 2002). There is limited evidence for mutagenicity\nor reproductive effects at doses below those causing systemic\nChlorinated water is thought to be the primary source of\nnon-occupational chloroform exposure among US adults\nThe present work was performed at the Department of Environmental\nand Occupational Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory\nUniversity.\n1.

Concentrations vary\nby region, day, and time with reported levels ranging from\nexperiments have shown that heating tap water gradually (as\nin a hot water heater) or boiling can affect point of use levels.\nWeisel and Chen (1994) recorded up to twofold increases in\npresumably from increased formation reactions among free\nchlorine and dissolved organic constituents. Krasner and\nWright (2005) on the other hand hypothesized that\nsimultaneous formation and volatilization were responsible\nfor the 34% decrease they observed in tap water chloroform\nafter boiling for one minute.\nChloroform's volatility and ubiquitous presence in tap\nwater may help explain why it is frequently detected in\npersonal air (e.g., air sampled from the breathing zone of\nsubjects) and indoor air at concentrations 10\u00ad100-fold higher\nthan outdoor levels. The EPA TEAM (Total Exposure\nAssessment Methodology) studies showed consistently higher\nlevels in personal than outdoor air in 24-h samples collected\nRecently, Weisel et al.

US adult volunteer\nstudies point to showering and/or bathing with chlorinated\ntap water as a major contributor to daily inhalation\nin bathroom air chloroform after subjects took hot showers\nin their study of household water use activities by seven\nvolunteers. Kerger et al. (2000) found that bathroom air\nchloroform increased 3 and 1 mg/m3 during showering and\nbathing respectively for each mg/l chloroform in water. Using\na mass balance approach, water use data, and exposure\nfactor assumptions including 1 mg/l tap water chloroform,\nMcKone (1987) estimated that showering contributes up to\n50% of lifetime chloroform inhalation exposures for the\naverage US adult versus spending time in the bathroom or\nremainder of the house. Additionally, recent biomarker\nstudies of US adults show that showering/bathing is\nsignificantly associated with increases in breath and/or blood\nchloroform, while other household water use activities such\nas washing dishes or clothes are not (Weisel et al., 1999;\nis also associated with elevated biomarker concentrations\nthough most studies have been conducted outside the United\nWe used multiple linear regression to investigate the major\npredictors of chloroform in personal air in the NHANES\n(US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC,\n2007a)). The NHANES data, which include chloroform\nconcentrations in personal air and household tap water in\naddition to socioeconomic data and information on activity\npatterns, provide a unique opportunity to evaluate predictors\nof inhalation exposures in a nationally representative sample.\nWe hypothesized that personal exposure microevents such as\nshowering/bathing and/or spending time at a pool would be\nsignificantly associated with chloroform concentrations in\npersonal air while associations with other exposure factors\nwould not. We also compared personal air levels to EPA's\ninhalation unit risk values to evaluate the distribution of\ncancer risk at the national level and among key subgroups.\nMethods\nNHANES Data Collection\nDetailed methods are available at the NHANES website\n(CDC, 2001). Briefly, a random subsample of subjects aged\n20\u00ad59 was recruited to participate in the VOC study during\nthe NHANES medical examination. Consenting subjects\nwore passive VOC exposure badges (3Mt Organic Vapor\ncontinuously for 46\u00ad76 h after the examination. Subjects\nwere instructed to wear it on the upper chest, leave it on a\nbedside table or clipped to a nearby lampshade while\nsleeping, and leave it in an adjacent room while showering\nsince humidity affects readings. Subjects were also asked to\nrecord hours spent indoors at home, indoors at work/school,\nand outdoors using an activity log, and instructed to collect a\ntap water sample from a bathtub or an outside faucet in an\nNHANES-provided container (CDC, 2001). When subjects\nreturned their samples, an NHANES interviewer adminis-\ntered a brief questionnaire to collect information on VOC\nexposure-related activities (CDC, 2001). Home examiners\ninterviewed and collected samples from subjects who could\nnot return to the trailer within 46\u00ad76 h; samples collected\noutside this window were considered invalid.\nSamples were analyzed at CDC or contract laboratories.\nBadge measurements below the analytical detection limit\nwere replaced with the detection limit, adjusted for badge\nwearing minutes, divided by O2 (CDC, 2005a). Water\nmeasurements below detection were replaced with the\ndetection limit divided by O2. Although badge field\nPredictors of chloroform in personal air among US adults Riederer et al.\nduplicates, field blanks, and positive controls were collected,\nresults for these quality control samples were not available in\nthe NHANES public release data.\nIn addition to tap water chloroform, we considered 30\nNHANES variables potential predictors of chloroform\ninhalation exposure. Of these, 17 were from the VOC\nQuestionnaire (CDC, 2001), eight from the Demographic\nQuestionnaire (CDC, 2005b), and three from the Housing\nCharacteristics Questionnaire (CDC, 2005c). Another, body\nmass index, was recorded during the NHANES examination\n(CDC, 2005d). We considered the variable indicating\nwhether subjects participated in morning, afternoon or\nevening examination sessions (CDC, 2005d) a proxy for\nthe time of day subjects began wearing the badge.\nWe downloaded the relevant data sets from the NHANES\nVOC Subsample weights (WTSVOC2Y) as well as the\nstratum (SDMVSTRA) and cluster (SDMVPSU) variables\nweighted statistical analyses. Certain NHANES data were\nupdated after their initial public release; all used in the\npresent study were updated as of June 2007.\nVariable Recodes\nWe preserved the NHANES categorical variable groupings\nbut recoded them so the group with the highest weighted\nfrequency in the VOC subsample was the reference group.\nMinor recodes included combining the ``something else'' and\n``dorm'' responses to the NHANES type of home question\ninto one category and transforming badge wearing minutes\nto hours. We treated household income (INDHHINC) as a\ncontinuous variable using the NHANES numerical cate-\ngories (1\u00ad11) instead of their corresponding income ranges.\nNHANES included two additional income categories (12,\nknow responses. We recoded Category 12 responses as\nmissing; this affected 3.2% of subjects. There were no\nCategory 13 responses.\nWe developed a new occupation variable to identify\nsubjects with workplace exposure potential. NHANES\nQuestion OCD230 asked subjects the industry they worked\nin while Question OCD240 asked the type of work they\nperformed. We created a variable (``occupation'') with four\nresponse categories: 0 F other; 1 F food preparation/store/\nrestaurant; 2 F manufacturing (paper, chemicals, food,\nelectrical/transport equipment); 3 F construction, and; 4 F\nno industry/job recorded. We considered Categories 1\u00ad3 to\nhave workplace exposure potential based on information\nfrom the 11th Report on Carcinogens (US Department of\nHealth and Human Services (DHHS, 2005)) and industries\n(Category 0) to have limited exposure potential.\nCategory 1 includes subjects who reported ``retail-food\nstores'' or ``retail-eating/drinking places'' in response to\nQuestion OCD230, as well as subjects who reported ``cooks''\nor ``miscellaneous food preparation/service'' to Question\nOCD240. We assumed these workers would spend part of the\nday in a kitchen around water use activities. If a subject said\ns/he worked in food preparation but as a waitress/waiter, we\ncoded her/him as Category 0, assuming s/he spent less time\naround water than cooks or dishwashers for example.\nCategory 2 includes workers in food/kindred products, paper\nproducts/printing/publishing, chemicals/petroleum/coal pro-\nducts, or transportation equipment industries. Textile/appa-\nrel/furnishings machine operators were also included in\nCategory 2 since one author (A. Riederer) observed extensive\nwater use on visits to US textile mills in the 1990s, and since\nthe textile response category to Question OCD230 applied to\nfinished products which we assumed do not require as much\nwater to manufacture as unfinished cloth. Category 3\nincludes subjects who reported working in construction\n(Question OCD230) and/or in construction trades (Question\nExploratory Data Analysis\nsampling protocol. Subsample weights were adjusted by\nCDC for non-response, and to match projected Census 2000\nweighted response frequencies and 95% confidence intervals\n(95% CIs) using PROC SURVEYFREQ in SAS 9.1 (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC, USA). We also conducted exploratory\nanalysis on the weighted and unweighted continuous\nvariables. Distributions of raw and log-transformed data\nwere visually evaluated for normality and outliers. Variables\nwith histograms appearing right-skewed were log-trans-\nformed for the regressions. We evaluated colinearity between\ncontinuous predictors using simple scatter plots. Last, we\ncalculated weighted cumulative percentiles of personal air\nchloroform and 95% CIs for the percentile estimates using\nthe DESCRIPT procedure in SUDAAN 9.0.0 (Research\nTriangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA).\nRegression Modeling and Diagnostics\nWe conducted weighted regression modeling in SUDAAN\nPROC REGRESS, using the NHANES fill-in values for\nmeasurements below detection. Model building was con-\nducted by first performing univariate regressions of log-\ntransformed chloroform badge concentrations on each of the\n31 initial predictors. We also included a quadratic term for\nbadge wearing time to account for potential non-linearity in\nresponse. Predictors with p-values of 0.2 or less were retained\nfor the multivariable analysis. These were assigned a random\nnumber and added one-by-one in ascending order to a\nmultivariable model fitted using PROC REGRESS. Pre-\ndictors with Pr0.2 were retained in each subsequent step.\nPredictors of chloroform in personal air among US adults\nRiederer et al.\nWe fit the final model and manually removed predictors with\ncriterion for statistical significance.\nWe evaluated model assumptions of normality and\nhomoscedasticity by examining plots of predicted values\nversus residuals as well as histograms and normal probability\nplots of residuals. Model fit was evaluated using the R2\nstatistic. Following Korn and Graubard (1998), we exam-\nined partial regression plots to identify potentially influential\nobservations then compared parameter estimates in the full\nmodel versus a model with each influential observation\nexcluded. Influential observations were excluded one at a\ntime in these analyses.\nCancer Risk Estimates\nWe estimated lifetime excess cancer risk for individual\nsubjects by multiplying her/his badge concentration by\nEPA's chloroform inhalation unit risk (EPA, 2005). This\nmethod estimates an individual's upper-bound risk of\ndeveloping cancer over a lifetime (70 years) of exposure at\nthe measured concentration. We estimated population risk in\nunits of excess cancer cases by multiplying each subject's\nindividual excess risk by her/his NHANES sample weight,\nthen summing across the total population or subgroup. To\nevaluate the distribution of risk burden within subgroups, we\ncalculated the weighted percent of each subgroup at the Z1\nWe considered subgroups with higher proportions of people\nat the Z1 in 104 risk level to bear a greater cancer burden\nthan subgroups with fewer at that level. For comparison, we\nrepeated these calculations using the CalEPA inhalation unit\nResults\nWeighted Detection and Response Frequencies\nChloroform was measured at levels at or above detection\nMeasurements were below detection in 20.0% of badge and\nwater samples respectively were missing. One water measure-\nment exceeded the upper bound of the calibrated range of the\nanalytical method but by o20% thus we included it in our\nregressions; excluding it did not change statistical outcomes.\nTable 1 shows weighted response frequencies and descrip-\ntive statistics for the regression predictors. Missing responses\nranged from 0\u00ad4.2% while refusals or ``don't know'' (not\nshown) accounted for o1% of responses.

Other\npopulation-based studies report similar associations between\nwater concentrations and personal or indoor air levels\nstudies report large short term spikes in personal or indoor\nair chloroform during showering/bathing and other specific\nhousehold water use activities (Kerger et al., 2000; Gordon\net al., 2006). Reported showering activity was not signifi-\ncantly associated with personal air chloroform in our model.\nWe believe this may be an artifact of the NHANES shower\nquestion, not an indicator of a true lack of association. The\nquestion asked, ``ydid you take a hot shower for five\nminutes or longer during this time?'' (CDC, 2001). Because\nmost (85.9%) subjects answered yes, there may not have\nbeen sufficient variance to detect an association in the\nunivariate regression. We did find a significant association\nbetween spending time at a swimming pool and personal air\nchloroform even though a small fraction of NHANES\nsubjects reported visiting a pool. This corroborates recent\nnon-US studies showing elevated indoor air chloroform\n\u00b4 vesque et al.,\nform was measured at 145 mg/m3 in swimming pool air in one\nUS study (Lindstrom et al., 1997) but we could not find more\nrecent estimates in the US literature.\nWe found a significant association between living in an\napartment or mobile home/trailer and elevated personal air\nchloroform. Keeping home windows closed was also\nassociated with elevated levels, illustrating the influence of\nair exchange rates. Although we were not able to test the\ninteraction between home type and window status due to\nsample size limitations, we believe the home type association\nmay be due to differences in air exchange rates (AER) and\nhome volumes. Sax et al. (2004) found that AER differences\nexplained seasonal variation in the indoor/outdoor air\nchloroform ratio in homes of New York City (n \u00bc 46) and\nLos Angeles (n \u00bc 40) teenagers; New York apartments\nsampled in winter with low AERs had the highest indoor/\noutdoor ratio. Weisel et al. (2005) found higher indoor air\nchloroform in apartments than single family homes in\nElizabeth and Los Angeles while in Houston they found\nhigher mean but lower median levels in mobile homes versus\nsingle family homes. Mobile homes in Houston and Los\nAngeles had higher median AERs than other home types,\nwhile single-family homes had higher rates in Los Angeles.\nWe are unable to explain the association between race/\nethnicity and personal air chloroform in our analyses, which\nappear influenced by several observations. The NHANES\nrepresents Mexican-Americans but not Other Hispanics,\nthus findings for this group should be interpreted cautiously\nCensus (``Black or African American'', 11.4%) (Census\nBureau, 2000). We only found one other study that tested the\nrace/ethnicity-chloroform association. The EPA Region 5\nstudy reported lower indoor air levels among Non-Hispanic\nWhites than other race/ethnicities though the difference was\nnot statistically significant (i.e., P40.05) (Pellizzari et al.,\n1999). It is difficult to explain why Non-Hispanic Blacks\nwould have higher chloroform exposures than Non-Hispanic\nWhites. This may be related to home type though we were\nnot able to test the interaction of home type and race/\nethnicity because of small cell sizes. Nonetheless, a crude\nanalysis of the weighted NHANES data showed that 38.6%\nHispanic Whites.\nDistribution of Cancer Risk Burden from Chloroform\nInhalation\nAll NHANES subjects had individual excess cancer risks\nexceeding 1 in 106, a level considered by EPA to trigger an\nevaluation of whether additional exposure reductions are\nneeded (EPA, 1999). Risk estimates for values below\ndetection were constructed using the CDC fill-in values.\nRisk estimates for these levels all exceeded 1 in 106. It is\nimportant to note that these are upper-bound risk estimates\n(EPA, 2005) and that lower-bound estimates could include\nzero if chloroform does not prove to be a human carcinogen.\nOther US studies show similar population risk estimates.\nLoh et al. (2007) estimated median and 90th percentile levels\nsimilar to NHANES using the CalEPA inhalation unit risk\nvalue, personal air data published since 1995, and a\nsimulated population of office workers and non-employed\nUsing the EPA inhalation unit risk, Sax et al.

To obtain stable P-values\nin weighted regression, the maximum number of estimable\nparameters is limited to the denominator degrees of freedom\nof the variance estimator (i.e., the number of primary\nsampling clusters minus the number of sampling strata)\nincluded 27 clusters and 13 strata, thus our regressions were\nlimited to 14 estimable parameters and we were not able to\ntest interactions between main effects. The combined\navailable would strengthen our analysis by increasing the\nnumber of estimable parameters, allowing testing of some\ninteractions. It would also potentially reduce the influence of\nindividual observations in the home type and race/ethnicity\nsubgroups.\nto use the OVM 3500 series of passive samplers to measure\nexposure to VOCs in general and chloroform in particular.\nPassive samplers for VOCs have been used extensively in\nboth occupational and community-based settings for the last\ntwo decades. Work by Chung et al. (1999), comparing\npassive samplers to canister whole-air samplers suggests\nnegative bias for the passive samplers, but further states that\ndifferences are likely less than 25%. More recently, Pratt\net al. (2005) have conducted a comparison of passive\nsamplers similar to those used in NHANES and canister\nwhole-air samplers for VOCs and support the small bias\nconclusion of Chung et al. (1999). Both of these studies\ninvolved laboratory and field components, but not personal\nmonitoring. For personal monitoring, concern has been\nraised that passive samplers, which rely on passive diffusion\nand assume an unobstructed pathway to the sample, may be\nadversely affected. Passive samplers of this type are subject to\nstagnation effects, resulting from insufficient air movement\nnear the badge and subsequent undersampling of bulk air, as\nwell as other mechanisms such as blockage by clothing,\nwhich may result in a low bias to the inferred exposure to\nVOCs. Further, effects of temperature and relative humidity\ncan also decrease the reliability of such samplers for personal\nmonitoring. However, Sexton et al. (2004a, b) have done\nextensive monitoring using the OVM 3500 series badge to\nmeasure personal exposures and have noted that personal\nexposure, as measured by a badge worn by the individual,\nnormally exceeds concentrations measured at stationary\nlocations either indoors or outdoors. While none of these\nstudies focused specifically on chloroform, the results are\nlikely applicable to this compound.\nAnother potential limitation lies in compliance with the\nbadge wearing protocol. A weighted total of 4.2% of subjects\ndid not answer the NHANES question on how long they\nwore the sampling badge, while 7.6% said they did not wear\nthe badge the whole time. Thus for these subjects the badge\nmeasurements may not represent the true exposures across\nthe entire sampling period. However, because the weighted\nmedian badge concentrations for these two groups (1.34 and\n1.03 mg/m3, respectively) both fall within the 95% confidence\nlimits of the median for subjects who reported wearing the\ndifference to be small.\nA third limitation lies in the NHANES sampling protocol.\nSubjects were instructed not to keep badges in the bathroom\nwhile showering/bathing. Explicit instructions were not given\nfor swimmers. Although this was the only practical option\nusing current technology, and other studies have used\nidentical protocols (e.g., Weisel et al., 2005), this likely\nresulted in measurements that underestimated personal air\nchloroform for subjects who showered/bathed or swam\nduring the sampling period. Volunteer studies from (Kerger\nsignificant increases in bathroom air chloroform during\nshowering/bathing. In their study of indoor air at five Italian\npools, Fantuzzi et al. (2001) found total trihalomethanes\nlevels collected poolside that were two times those measured\nat other pool areas. Erdinger et al. (2004) found higher levels\nin samples collected 30 versus 150 cm above the water at a\nGerman pool. Thus although a badge placed in an adjacent\nroom during a shower/bath, or near a pool during\nswimming, is likely to capture a fraction of the increased\nair chloroform resulting from those events, it is not likely to\ncapture the total inhalation exposure of the showerer/bather\nor swimmer.\nSimple calculations based on the Gordon et al. (2006)\nfindings may help illustrate the potential magnitude of the\ndifference. In their small (n \u00bc 7) volunteer study of indoor air\nchloroform during scripted household water-use activities,\nthese researchers found a mean concentration of 2.3 mg/m3\n(per mg/l in water) in bathroom air versus a median of 2.0 mg/\nm3 (per mg/l) in air of an adjacent room during a 10-min hot\nmedian (13.7 mg/l), this translates to a difference of 0.7 mg/\nm3-h that might not be captured by the sampling badge if it\nwere kept in an adjacent room instead of the bathroom\nduring the showering event. This 0.7 mg/m3-h is approxi-\nmately 1% of 61 mg/m3-h, or the median NHANES badge\nconcentration (1.13 mg/m3) times the median badge-wearing\nhours (53.6). Repeating this calculation using the 95th\npercentile NHANES tap water concentration (74.7 mg/l)\nproduces an estimate of 3.7 mg/m3-h, or 6% of the\nNHANES badge median expressed in mg/m3-h. Thus, a\nrough estimate of the amount of chloroform potentially\nPredictors of chloroform in personal air among US adults Riederer et al.\nsubjects taking one 10-min shower and 2\u00ad12% for subjects\ntaking two 10-min showers, depending on tap water levels\nand sampling duration. Future research to quantify\nthe difference would help produce more accurate estimates\nof inhalation exposures to chloroform in the general\npopulation.\n"
