There was also a comparison non-intervention (NI) group,\nand the groups were posttested. To teach the target affixes via PI, new structured input tasks were developed. In all, 101\nadult male and female lower-intermediate participants initially took part in the study, but this was later reduced to 71 as\na result of the pretest, and so on. The results were analyzed through MANOVA and paired t test. In recognition, PI and\nTI outperformed non-intervention, while PI and TI did not outperform one another. In production, TI outperformed the\nother groups, while the other groups did not outperform one another. More studies must be carried out before drawing\nany conclusions about the transferability of PI to output activities for teaching derivational affixes. The students were also\ninterviewed to survey their attitudes. Affectively, PI created self-confidence and an enjoyable atmosphere among the learners.\nAlso cognitively, PI was the only group that satisfied the participants in their ability to recognize and produce derivational\naffixes. We found PI a highly effective and positive approach for teaching recognizing derivational affixes. We also believe it\nto possess a high potential for teaching their production, as it gave the participants a good sense of self-confidence for the\nproduction of the affixes.\n",

It is composed of an explicit\npart based on a default input-processing problem and an\ninductive, implicit task-based part in the form of structured\ninput tasks. VanPatten and other researchers have shown the\neffectiveness of this intervention type in various studies with\nrespect to teaching the structure and grammatical morphol-\nVanPatten & Uludag, 2011). But its effectiveness concerning\nother language forms has not been sufficiently established\nyet as VanPatten and Uludag (2011) have put it themselves.\nThe main focus of this study was to investigate the utility\nand effectiveness of PI (VanPatten, 1993), which is mainly\nimplemented through structured input tasks as opposed to\ntraditional exercise-/item-based intervention, but this time in\nteaching English derivational affixes. There are both a quali-\ntative and a quantitative part to this study. The students were\ninterviewed to survey their attitudes toward learning under\nany of the instruction types investigated in this study. They\nwere also pretested, there was a comparison group, and the\ngroups were posttested under controlled conditions.\nBackground\nDifferent aspects of PI have been investigated and discussed\nin various contexts and by various researchers (e.g., Benati\nwas mainly inspired by VanPatten and Uludag's (2011)\nresearch on the transferability of training via PI to output\ntasks. In their study, they worked on the passive structure to\nsee whether input practice via PI, which is \"an input oriented\napproach to grammar intervention\" (p. 44), is transferable to\nlimited output conditions.

As mentioned above, many studies have shown the\neffectiveness of this intervention type with respect to teach-\ning the structure and grammatical morphology of language\n(e.g., Benati, 2001), but its effectiveness concerning other\nlanguage forms has not been sufficiently established yet as\nVanPatten and Uludag (2011) have put it themselves:\nPI has been researched in English, Spanish, German, French,\nItalian, and Russian to date. Within these languages, researchers\nhave examined both syntactic issues (word order and the role of\nnouns in sentences, including case marking, and causative\nstructures), verbal morphology (e.g., past, present, future, mood,\naspect, person-number), nominally oriented morphology (e.g.,\nagreement between nouns, adjectives, and participles), and other\nsurface forms of language. (p. 52)\nAs can be understood from the excerpt and a review of the\nliterature, there have been no efforts to examine the effec-\ntiveness of this intervention with content words or deriva-\ntional affixes (unlike inflectional affixes, which are functional\nrather than lexical). Nor have there been any claims about\nthis effectiveness. Maybe this is due to the principles of input\nprocessing proposed by VanPatten (2002b) such as the one\nthat reads \"[l]earners prefer processing `more meaningful'\nmorphology before `less' or `nonmeaningful' morphology\"\n(p. 758, in the table). PI, therefore, tries to help learners over-\ncome their processing problems (i.e., their less-than-optimal\nprocessing strategies) and process the ignored items more\nreadily.\nA processing problem refers to a mistake students \"make\nwhen trying to comprehend a particular kind of sentence and\nthen [they] are given examples to show why their `default'\nprocessing strategies may not work\" (VanPatten & Uludag,\n2011, p. 45). Actually during this explicit part of the instruc-\ntion, learners are provided with information on why they\nprocess a structure/item incorrectly as a result of a default\nway of processing sentences and are taught how to overcome\nthis problem. The processing problem discerned with regard\nto derivational affixes among elementary, lower-intermedi-\nate, and intermediate learners is that unless they are made\naware of the existence of a specific derivational affix in a\nnew word, particularly the less frequent derivational affixes,\nthey do not tend to notice it (Nation, 2001). In other words,\nlearners generally tend to perceive words holistically, unless\nthey are sensitized to derivational affixes during the later\nstages of their learning lives through different noticing activ-\nities. This is based on VanPatten's (2004b) most basic input-\nprocessing principle, that is, Principle 1, which reads \"[l]\nearners process input for meaning before they process it for\nform\" (p. 7, emphasis in original). In this regard, the first,\nsecond, and fifth subprinciples are of particular importance.\nThey read as follows:\nPrinciple 1a. The Primacy of Content Words Principle.\nLearners process content words in the input before anything\nelse.\nPrinciple 1b. The Lexical Preference Principle. Learne[r]s\nwill tend to rely on lexical items as opposed to grammatical form\nto get meaning when both encode the same semantic information.\nPrinciple [1]e. The Availability of Resources Principle. For\nlearners to process either redundant meaningful grammatical\nforms or non-meaningful forms, the processing of overall\nsentential meaning must not drain available processing\nLearners generally tend to rely on the contextual clues\nand the lexical items available to process meaning.\nStructured input activities \"contain input manipulated in\nparticular ways to push learners away from less-than-opti-\nmal processing strategies\" (VanPatten & Uludag, 2011, p.\n45, emphasis in original). They are asked to interpret sen-\ntences containing the target structure/item and this leads to\naltering their default processing strategies. More has been\nexplained about structured input under the treatments\nsection.\nWhat was probed to be done in this study was to investi-\ngate this rather untouched aspect of PI. The question was\nwhether PI could be effective in teaching the derivational\naffixes in language or it would lose ground to other tradi-\nBesides this comparison, the present research was des-\ntined to develop a specific structured input task catering to\nthe instruction of English derivational affixes. As the major-\nity of the studies carried out on PI so far have examined\ngrammar intervention, most of the structured input tasks\nBaleghizadeh and Saharkhiz 3\ndesigned cater to teaching the structure of language and there\nare almost no well-developed tasks focusing on derivational\naffixes, at least to the present researchers' best knowledge.\nTherefore, an effective task of our own was needed to be\ndesigned for the specific purpose of this study.\nBased on the problems and purposes stated for this\nresearch work, the following four categories of questions\nemerged:\nIntervention Versus Non-Intervention\nResearch Question 1: Will intervention make any statis-\ntically significant difference in the recognition of deriva-\ntional affixes?\nResearch Question 2: Will intervention make any statis-\ntically significant difference in the production of deriva-\ntional affixes?\nPI Versus TI\nResearch Question 3: Will there be any statistically sig-\nnificant difference between the effect of intervention\nthrough PI on the recognition of derivational affixes and\nthat of intervention through TI?\nResearch Question 4: Will there be any statistically sig-\nnificant difference between the effect of intervention\nthrough PI on the production of derivational affixes and\nthat of intervention through TI?\nPI\nResearch Question 5:As a corollary of Question 4 and as\nPI is an input-based intervention, will PI lead to the trans-\nfer of training from input to output with regard to deriva-\ntional affixes?\nResearch Question 6:As a corollary of Question 4 and as\nPI has been the main focus of this study, will PI after all\nbe effective in teaching the derivational affixes of\nlanguage?\nResearch Question 7: Will the structured input task cre-\nated for instructing derivational affixes in this study lead\nlearners to alter their \"less-than-optimal processing strat-\noriginal)? How will the task work in actual practice? Will\nit turn out to work well?\nQualitative Investigations\nResearch Question 8: What different patterns can be found\namong the attitudes the participants bear toward various\naspects of learning under any of these instruction types?\nMethod\nThis study was planned to compare the differing effects of\nthree instruction types on students' acquisition and use\npatterns of English derivational affixes both quantitatively\nand qualitatively. The purpose of the qualitative analysis was\nto gain more information than the mere numerical informa-\ntion on various instructions would provide.\nParticipants and Categories\nThe participants were chosen from among adult foreign lan-\nguage learners of both genders with age ranging from 18 to\n25, with just a limited number of exceptions of age about 30\nand 40. All the participants were BA/BS students of busi-\nness, management, physics, mathematics, education, and the\nlike at the Shahre Rey Branch of Islamic Azad University in\nTehran. All the students were attending their General English\ncourse and one of the present researchers was their instruc-\ntor. As all the participants were students of majors other than\nthe English Language (Literature, Translation, or Teaching\nEnglish as a foreign language [TEFL]), all of them were sup-\nposed to be lower-intermediate learners, and this was con-\nfirmed through devising the reading section of the paper\nversion of Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)\u00ae.\nThree instruction types for teaching English derivational\naffixes were examined. Two of these were the treatment\ngroups including a PI intervention based on VanPatten's\n(1993) PI theory and a deductive item-based intervention\n(hereafter the TI group [traditional intervention]), and the\nother one was an inductive, holistic non-intervention (hereaf-\nter the NI group [non-intervention]), which served as the\ncomparison group. Due to the common limitations at univer-\nsities, the three classes chosen were intact, but the three\ninstruction types were assigned randomly to each of the three\nclasses. The groups initially consisted of 38, 29, and 34 par-\nticipants, in the PI, TI, and NI groups, respectively. However,\nfor reasons that have been explained in what follows, these\nMorphemes\nRather than inflectional affixes, this study chose to examine\nthe effectiveness of PI with teaching derivational mor-\nphemes, which have more to do with the meanings of words.\nBased on the definition proposed for derivational morphemes\nphemes (i.e., affixes, either prefixes or suffixes) that change\neither the meaning of a word or its part of speech. For exam-\nple, the affix un- in unhappy is a derivational prefix that\nchanges word meanings and the affix -ness in happiness is a\nderivational suffix that transforms an adjective into a noun. A\nsample of all types of derivational affixes was selected in this\nstudy. The selection was founded on a categorization and\nsequencing of English derivational affixes for instruction\nbased on the difficulty criterion by Nation. He has listed the\naffixes under five stages from the easiest ones to the most\ndifficult (see Table 1).\nAs it shows, the third stage which stands in the middle and\nsuits intermediate learners includes the longest list. This list\n4 SAGE Open\nseemed to give the greater number of items to choose from,\nbut as some of the learners in the present study might have\nbeen familiar with some of them, it was wiser to pick the\naffixes in the last two stages to make sure that they were\nunfamiliar. Nevertheless, any final claims about the familiar-\nity of the learners with the selected items had to be based on\nthe pretesting results. There were 28 affixes in the last two\nstages, and to round the number of the affixes for our treat-\nments and tests, we added two other rather infrequent affixes\nfrom the third stage: -en (adjective- and verb-maker) and\nsemi-. Besides, two of the affixes selected (ex- and pro-)\nwere actually two affixes each that had the same form but\ndifferent meanings and functions. We did so to have more\nexample words for them at our disposal.\nPretesting\nFor each of the affixes, a recognition multiple-choice item\nwas designed. The stem presented a sentence including an\nunderlined word containing the affix. The options repre-\nsented different meaning alternatives for the word and they\nwere similar to each other except for the part related to the\naffix. Below, the reader is provided with two example\nitems--one for testing a derivational suffix and one for a\nderivational prefix:\nExample:\nThe depth of the hole made it difficult to be seen.\n1. making something deep\n2. how deep something is\n3. someone who makes things deep\nA co-pilot has a really difficult job.\n1. a pilot in the past\n2. an amateur pilot\n3. someone who helps the pilot\nIn the end, all the items were collected into a whole test\nand validated.\nAs the cut-off point, it was decided that, to account for the\nguessing scores, the students who gained any score amount-\ning to more than 25% of the total score (to be on the safe\nside) be excluded. Accordingly, as a whole, 15 of the partici-\npants who had gained 8 and more were excluded and, quite\nby chance 5 in each group. In addition, a number of the par-\nticipants who were present on the pretest were absent either\nduring the treatments or on the posttest. Therefore, 15 more\npretest scores were excluded: 10 in PI, 1 in TI, and 4 in NI.\nThus, 71 participants were left for the final posttest: 23, 23,\nand 25 in PI, TI, and NI, respectively.\nAny item with an item facility index of more than 0.25\n(more than 17 correct answers) was omitted, because the\naffixes tested by such items would be conceived of as too\nfamiliar for the learners. Four of the items were consequently\ndeleted: Item 1 testing the affix -able with 33 correct answers,\nItem 11 testing pre- with 22. So, the total score of the pretest\nwas changed to 26 from 30. These affixes were also deleted\nfrom the treatments and posttest.\nA one-way ANOVA showed no significant difference\namong the groups in their prior knowledge of the target mor-\nTreatments\nThree 30-min treatment sessions were allocated to each\ngroup. All the sessions were taught by one of the researchers,\nand they were all held in L2.\nIn NI, the students read passages including the affixes\nsilently. The texts were about miscellaneous topics, includ-\ning sports, navy, and science. Afterward, they were asked\nsome general and specific comprehension questions by the\nteacher and, next, they had reading aloud accompanied by\nTable 1.

All\nthe new words were defined and further sentential examples\nwere provided by the teacher to show their uses in sentences.\nIn the end, they worked on a vocabulary activity in which\nthey received a list of words to complete sentences including\na blank. There was no indication to affixes during any of the\nphases of their instruction (see Appendix A for the NI sample\nmaterial).\nIn TI, in each session the students were given explicit\nmorphological explanations on the target affixes, followed\nby traditional exercises which the students answered in pairs.\nFrom the second session on, before presenting the rest of the\ntarget affixes, the teacher answered the students' problems\nwith the previous ones and they reviewed them together.\nThere were two kinds of exercises in this group. In the first\none, the students added an affix to a stem/word to form a\ncomplete word based on the part of speech and a definition in\nfront of each word. In the second exercise, they were pre-\nsented with sentences including a blank and a word which\nwas provided in the end of each sentence in parentheses. The\nstudents added an appropriate affix to the word to fill in the\nblank (see Appendix B for the TI sample material).\nIn PI, in the first session, the students received explicit\ninstruction with examples on the target affixes and a process-\ning problem accompanied by structured input activities. In\nthe structured input activities, they were not asked to pro-\nduce the target affixes and did not receive any further explicit\nexplanation (VanPatten & Uludag, 2011). During the next\nsessions, the students only worked on more structured input\nactivities.\nIn this study, the PI learners were presented with a version\nof structured input activities which was specifically designed\nfor the presentation of derivational affixes, because there has\nbeen no structured input task with such an aim developed in\nthe literature, at least to the present researchers' best knowl-\nsessions, respectively, to cover the 30 min of instruction in\neach session. Each item presented them with a L1 sentence\nor a picture for which there were two English sentences to\nIn two thirds of the items in each activity, the sentences\nincluding the affixes were the correct answers and in the rest\nof the items the sentences not including them (see Appendix\nC for the PI sample material).\nPosttest and Analyses\nImmediately after the treatments were over, the posttest was\ngiven to the participants on the last session of the instruc-\ntions. There was a 3-week gap between the pretest and the\nposttest, which would neutralize almost any practice effect.\nThe posttest included two sections: a recognition test and a\nproduction test. The recognition posttest was of the same for-\nmat as that of the pretest, but new items were developed.\nThe production test included completion items in which\nthe participants were presented with a cue word in the end of\neach sentence in parentheses. The students were supposed to\nadd an appropriate affix to the cue word to fill in the blank.\nBelow, the reader is provided with an example item:\nExample:\nThe two students ------ to answer the questions. (operate)\nIn the end, all the items were collected into a whole test\nand validated.\nThere were one independent variable and two dependent\nvariables in the study. The independent variable was instruc-\ntion type with the three levels of PI, TI, and NI. The two\ndependent variables investigated in this study were the par-\nticipants' recognition and production scores.\nThe data in this design were analyzed using one-way\nMANOVA to find out whether there was a significant overall\ndifference and Tukey's post hoc test to compare each two\nmeans on each dependent variable.Also, separate t tests were\nrun between the pretest and the recognition posttest results of\neach of the three groups to check for the amount of gain in\ntheir recognition of the target affixes.\nQualitative Investigations\nThe qualitative part of this study contributed to the quantita-\ntive part by collecting non-numerical data on the partici-\npants' attitudes toward the effectiveness of different\ninstruction types for the acquisition of English derivational\naffixes. Scrutinizing this effectiveness does not necessarily\nneed to be done merely through experimenting with those\ninstructions. The participants' attitudes can be valid sources\nof information on the effectiveness of the instructions they\nundergo.\nWhat was interesting for the researchers to find out was to\ndetect whether studying derivational affixes under PI gave\nthe learners a cognitively and affectively more positive expe-\nrience than did studying under other more traditional inter-\nventions. To this aim, a structured interview was developed\nthat tapped their views toward various aspects of their class-\nrooms. A complete version of the structured interview is pre-\nsented in Table 2 below.\nThe interviews were carried out in the learners' L1 to\nensure maximum understanding and feedback. The inter-\nview was piloted with intermediate adult learners prior to the\nstudy, and it was made sure that it would elicit the informa-\ntion we were looking for, hence the validity of the items.\nResults and Discussion\nA one-way MANOVA was run for the posttest, and a signifi-\np < .0005. This shows that different instruction types did\nhave an effect on the learners' recognition and/or production\nof the target affixes. However, a partial 2 of .15 suggests\nthat only 15% of the difference found was due to the inde-\npendent variable, that is, the instruction types, and the\n6 SAGE Open\nremaining 85% was due to other intervening variables. Also,\nthe tests of between-subjects effects show that this difference\nhas been significant in both recognition and production:\nFrecognition\nFproduction\nTukey's post hoc test was run to compare each two means on\neach dependent variable (see Table 3).\nThe results of Tukey's post hoc test illustrate that both\ntreatment groups, that is, PI and TI, significantly outper-\nformed the comparison group, that is, NI on the recognition\nposttest, while no significant difference was found between\nPI and TI on this test. This can mean that intervention, as\nopposed to non-intervention, can make a positive difference\nfor teaching recognizing derivational affixes, but there is no\nconsiderable difference between the traditional deductive\nitem-based approach and more modern task-based\napproaches. Thus, teaching derivational affixes, regardless\nof the approach taken, leads to higher amounts of learning\nthan does not teaching them. In other words, we can feel safe\nthat if teachers spend time on teaching the affixes through\nmore direct instructional procedures, they will not be wast-\ning that time to gain nothing considerable in return. If teach-\ners do not probe to teach derivational affixes directly, their\nlearners will most probably gain much less than when they\ndo so directly. However, all these should be taken with\ncaution.\nIn terms of production, TI significantly outperformed the\nother two groups, while neither PI nor NI proved any better\nthan one another. This may signify that as PI is an input-\nbased approach, it cannot bear any better results than not\nteaching using derivational affixes in speaking and writing\nat all (i.e., non-intervention). It seems that the more tradi-\ntional deductive practice-based approaches work better for\nteaching the production of derivational affixes. This actually\nconnotes the lack of transferability of PI to output activities\nat least in terms of derivational affixes. Of course, there have\nbeen many studies that have supported the transferability of\nFern\u00e1ndez, 2008), and this study does not deny this transfer-\nability for other aspects of SLA. Even with respect to teach-\ning derivational affixes, we believe that as this was one of the\nfirst times that PI was devised for the instruction of deriva-\ntional affixes, there must have been definitely many short-\nages and deficiencies in the proper implementation and\nactualization of PI based on the principles established for it\nin the literature. These may have included factors such as the\nlength of instruction and the development of well-targeted\nmaterial.\nHowever, one highly important point should not be over-\nlooked. Not leading to any better results than the non-inter-\nvention instruction in the production of derivational affixes\nmay connote, but does not necessarily denote, the lack of\ntransferability of PI to output activities. Besides, the obser-\nvation that PI was significantly less effective than TI in\nteaching the production of derivational affixes does not mean\nthat PI itself has not been significantly effective in teaching\nthe production of derivational affixes. In sum, to make sure\nwhether PI is after all transferable to output activities or not,\na production pretest\u00adposttest design needs to be put up,\nwhich has, to our great regret, been one of the limitations of\nthis study.\nIn addition, the significant impact of PI on the recognition\nof derivational affixes should not be forgotten. After all, this\nwas one of the first times PI was devised for their instruction\nand it turned out to be considerably successful and even a bit\nmore so than the traditional deductive item-based approach.\nThis can be deeply promising for the advocates of PI. PI has\nbeen successful in a domain for which it has never made big\nclaims--that is, the instruction of derivational affixes.\nAs mentioned above, in this study, we also drew a recog-\nnition within-groups pretest\u00adposttest comparison. The aim\nwas to find out which group(s) had significantly improved\nfrom the pretest to the posttest. Separate t tests were run\nbetween the pretest and the recognition posttest results of\neach of the three groups. The results of these analyses plus\nthe descriptive statistics of the groups on all their tests have\nbeen tabulated in Table 4 below.\nAccording to Table 4, all the three groups significantly\nimproved since their pretest. This means that all the instruc-\ntion types were effective for teaching recognizing the deriva-\ntional affixes. Even the comparison group, which had not\nreceived any instruction on the target affixes, managed to\nmake significant progress. This may seem disappointing for\nthe results obtained by PI on the recognition posttest, but\nbefore jumping into any conclusion we should take a second\nlook at Table 3. Based on Table 3, PI significantly\nTable 2. Structured Interview About Participants' Attitudes\nToward Different Instruction Types for Derivational Affixes.\n1. How do you like the class atmosphere?

Although PI was slightly better than\nTI on the recognition posttest, it did not succeed to cause a\nsignificant difference. Again this can be attributed to the use\nof PI for teaching derivational affixes for almost the first\ntime in this study. Deductive item-based instruction of deri-\nvational affixes has been devised for many years in schools\nand institutes, but it has always received students' frowns\nbecause of the lack of attractiveness of its procedure. Maybe\nit is time to substitute this rather dull approach with more\nattractive activities that have proved effective in this respect,\nespecially PI, which is more likely to be welcomed by stu-\ndents due to its use of illustrations, as you will read in the\nfollowing section.\nSo far, the first six research questions have been dis-\ncussed.As for the seventh question about the structured input\ntasks created for instructing derivational affixes in this study,\nwe cannot have an outright answer. We do not exactly know\nwhether the learning brought about by PI in recognition was\ndue to the initial explicit part or the subsequent structured\ninput tasks. What is undeniable, however, is their attractive-\nness and novelty for the participants as described in the fol-\nlowing section. Therefore, even not to mention their direct\nrole, they can at least indirectly have a positive effect on stu-\ndents' learning. As you will read in the qualitative part, the\nstudents were deeply interested in the illustrations and the\ngeneral format of the activities in PI and invested more\nenergy and attention in their instruction. Nevertheless, to\nhave a better picture of how the structured input tasks influ-\nence the acquisition of derivational affixes more studies need\nto be done focusing on this specific aspect of PI.\nSurveying the Participants' Attitudes\nAs mentioned above, a structured interview was developed\nwhich tapped the participants' views toward various aspects\nof their classrooms. A complete version of the structured\ninterview is presented in Table 2. Each interview lasted for\nabout 5 min. To answer our eighth research question, the\ninterviews were analyzed almost based on Lynch's (1992)\nmodel of analysis of \"the effects matrix\" through \"general\npatterns,\" \"specific difference patterns,\" and \"specific simi-\nlarity patterns.\" This method of analysis mixes both qualita-\ntive and quantitative forms of data. The data are summarized\nin a table in the form of a matrix and then evaluated both\nqualitatively and numerically. We transcribed the learners'\nanswers to the questions in the interview and summarized\nthem in Table 5 below.\nIn each group, five of the participants were randomly cho-\nsen for the interview. All the three aspects mentioned above\nhave been discussed in what follows.\nGeneral Patterns\nA general comparison among the three groups of the inter-\nviewees' answers to the questions shows that the PI group\nHowever, PI received 6 minuses, TI 11, and NI 7. This gen-\neral comparison favors the PI and NI groups as opposed to\nthe TI group. Generally, the learners in the traditional deduc-\ntive item-based approach were not as positive about both the\naffective and cognitive aspects of the instruction of deriva-\ntional affixes as those in PI and NI.\nSpecific Difference Patterns\nRegarding the class atmosphere, the participants in PI had a\nrather highly positive attitude toward their instruction. The\nimportant point is that there was no negative attitude at all.\nOnly one of the interviewees gave a neutral response. The TI\ninterviewees were a bit negative. On average, their attitude\nwas not terrible, but TI was not very welcomed either. In NI,\nthe participants seemed to like their instruction in general,\nbut three of the interviewees did not sound that enthusiastic.\nIt was very interesting that the learners who had not\nreceived any instruction in terms of the affixes claimed to\nhave gained the highest amount of self-confidence, and all of\nthem agreed in that respect. In the PI group, all the learners\nTable 4.Within-Group t Test Results and Groups' Descriptive Statistics.\nRecognition posttest\nRecognition pretest\u00adposttest\ncomparison\nProduction\nposttest (out of\nGroups N X SD X SD t value df X SD\nNote.

The TI interviewees seemed to be at a\nbit lower confidence level in comparison with the other two\ngroups.\nRecognition turned out to be PI's strongest aspect. All the\nPI interviewees agreed on having improved considerably in\nrecognizing the affixes in texts. TI's average in this respect\nwas a bit low, and NI, though better than TI, was not as posi-\ntive as PI.\nTo our great surprise, TI had the lowest average in pro-\nduction, too. Most of the TI interviewees were negative\nabout their ability to use the affixes for producing words\nincluding them. The NI participants were just a little better.\nThe PI interviewees were largely positive about their produc-\ntion abilities, and two of them thought that in case of more\npractice and review at home they would gain more fruitful\nresults in future.\nFor two of the PI participants, the pictures were the sweet\npart of the instruction and one of them felt that he had gained\nmore information about the English language. Only one of\nthe interviewees in TI liked the change, and one in NI found\nthe information useful for her final exam at the university.\nOne interviewee in each of the TI and NI groups thought\nthat the instructions were over their heads, while two inter-\nviewees in the PI group asked for more instruction and pic-\ntures--a criticism that is only negative on the surface.\nSpecific Similarity Patterns\nThere were some similarities among the three groups in each\nof the questions, but here, we focus on just some of the most\nimportant aspects. In terms of the affective aspects, both PI\nand NI enjoyed warm receptions from the interviewees, but\nPI won the ground with regard to the cognitive aspect from\nthe other groups. All the three groups had gained consider-\nable amounts of self-confidence about learning and using\nderivational affixes after the instructions were over, and this\nshows that generally language learners welcome instruction\nTable 5.

Also, no parts of any of the instruc-\ntion types turned out to have severely bothered the learners.\nSummary\nGenerally speaking, PI seemed to be the most popular of the\nthree instruction types with the participants. Affectively, the\nlearners enjoyed their experience with the procedure and\ngained high levels of self-confidence. Particularly, they were\nvery positive about the illustrations. Actually, NI, too, was\nsuccessful in this respect but not as successful. This partial\naccomplishment, we speculate, is because of the inductive\nnature of NI, which does not make learners overly tired. TI,\ndue to its deductive, tedious procedure, looked a bit boring to\nthe learners.\nAlso cognitively, although this was TI that had gained the\nbest results on the recognition and production posttests as a\nwhole, PI was the only group that accomplished to satisfy the\nparticipants in terms of their ability to recognize and produce\nderivational affixes. They felt that they had become much\nbetter after the instruction. This was not the case with either\nTI or NI. Therefore, we think that PI can be deeply promising\nfor teaching derivational affixes. It is an approach highly\nwelcomed by learners because of its novelty, and this popu-\nlarity among its recipients is a point that not many instruction\ntypes have enjoyed.\nConclusion\nIn this study, we tried to investigate the utility and effective-\nness of PI (VanPatten, 1993), which is mainly implemented\nthrough structured input tasks in teaching English deriva-\ntional affixes as opposed to traditional deductive exercise-\nbased intervention.\nStatistically, PI proved quite effective for the recogni-\ntion of derivational affixes, but for any claim about the\ntransferability of PI to output activities for teaching deri-\nvational affixes, more meticulous studies must be carried\nout.\nConsidering the participants' attitudes, PI, and with a\nlower caliber NI, managed to create an enjoyable atmosphere\nin the class and positive attitudes of self-confidence among\nthe learners.\nBased on the results of both sections of the study, we find\nPI a highly effective and positive approach for teaching the\nrecognition of derivational affixes. We also believe it to pos-\nsess a high potential for teaching their production, as it gave\nthe participants a good sense of self-confidence for the pro-\nduction of the affixes.\nDull traditional deductive practice-based approaches have\nbeen exhausted for the instruction of derivational affixes,\nand we believe that it is time for the substitution of this\napproach with more popular and effective approaches,\nincluding PI, with all their novelties and attractions. This was\nwhat we actually probed to try in this study.\nAppendix A\nThe NI Sample Material\n1.
