Therefore, the question arises whether successful firms become MNEs or\nwhether going abroad improves home market performance. This paper investi-\ngates to what extent MNEs have superior performance characteristics, both prior\nto and after they have switched from national to multinational activities. In the first\ncase results are quite clear: Future multinationals outperform domestic firms. Since\nself-selection occurs, an endogenous treatment approach is necessary for comparing\nex-post performance of firms. Using probit estimates of the decision to become a\nMNE, Heckman's (1978) treatment model is applied to account for potential endo-\ngeneity issues. The results suggest that after switching, both productivity and wage\ngrowth are higher for newly founded MNEs than for national firms. Employment\ngrowth is superior before switching but does not exhibit significantly higher ex-post\ngrowth rates. Moreover, capital intensities at multinationals evolve towards the use\nof capital.\n",

The analysis is conducted both prior to\nand after firms have gone multinational. In order to assess a broad range of firm\nattributes, I have constructed five different performance measures: 1) firm size; 2)\ntotal factor productivity (TFP); 3) labour productivity; 4) average wage per firm; 5)\ncapital intensities. Since multinationals do not arise randomly \u00ad only good firms\naccept the risk to invest abroad \u00ad Heckman's (1978) treatment model is used to\naccount for potential endogeneity issues in the ex-post analysis.\nTheoretical predictions are clear cut if ex-ante (before switching) performance\ndifferences between switchers and nationals are considered. When starting up or ac-\nquiring foreign affiliates, firms need to overcome legal, cultural, and social barriers.\nOnly good firms are able to cope with this kind of fixed costs and, thus, self-select\ninto foreign markets. Whether the regime change from national to multinational\nactivities also improves home market performance after switching is less obvious.\nIf there is no other alternative to serve foreign markets besides the set-up or ac-\nquisition of an affiliate (horizontal perspective), becoming a MNE would have no\nnegative or even positive effects on domestic operations. If, in contrast, the purpose\nof a multinational's foundation is to vertically divide its production process, per-\nformance measures could rise or decline. The question whether investing abroad\nimproves home market performance or not is therefore essentially an empirical is-\nsue.\nMy findings provide clear evidence throughout the following points: During the\nyears prior to the regime change, switchers exhibit higher performance attributes\nin levels, i.e. they are larger in size, pay higher wages, produce with higher\ncapital intensities, and they are more productive. These results are confirmed\nby a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test on the equality of performance\ndistributions. For all firm characteristics, distribution functions for nationals lie\nto the left of those for switchers. In terms of growth rates, significant ex-ante\ndifferences between newly founded MNEs and national firms can only be found\nwith respect to the size of the operation. After the regime change, both productivity\nand wage growth are higher for switchers than for nationals. Capital intensities at\nmultinationals evolve towards the use of capital, and switching does not affect firm\nsize. Moreover, the implementation of Heckman's (1978) endogenous treatment\nestimator suggests that self-selection matters. Though results are somewhat mixed\nhere, I find evidence that TFP growth in the first year after going multinational,\nlabour productivity in the first and second period after becoming a MNE, and\ncapital intensities for the whole sample period are significantly influenced by\nselectivity issues.\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nDie vorliegende Arbeit untersucht, inwiefern sich der \u00a8\nUbergang von nationalen\nzu multinationalen Aktivit\u00a8\naten auf die Charakteristika des Mutterunternehmens in\nDeutschland im Vergleich zu rein national agierenden Firmen auswirkt. Die Unter-\nsuchung analysiert sowohl den Zeitraum vor dem \u00a8\nUbergang als auch die Jahre nach\ndem Regimewechsel. Um dabei eine m\u00a8\noglichst umfassende Auswahl von firmenbe-\nzogenen Eigenschaften abzudecken, werden f\u00a8\nunf verschiedene betriebliche Charak-\nteristika evaluiert: 1. die Firmengr\u00a8\no\u00dfe; 2. die totale Faktorproduktivit\u00a8\nat (TFP);\n3. die Arbeitsproduktivit\u00a8\nat; 4. durchschnittliche L\u00a8\nohne; 5. die H\u00a8\nohe des Kapi-\ntaleinsatzes. Da potentiell nur erfolgreiche Firmen das Risiko einer Auslandsin-\nvestition eingehen, k\u00a8\nonnten sich in der ex-post Analyse m\u00a8\noglicherweise Endo-\ngenit\u00a8\natsverzerrungen der \u00a8\nokonometrischen Sch\u00a8\natzungen ergeben. Um solche Prob-\nleme nachzuweisen und zu beheben, kommt Heckmans (1978) Treatment Modell\nzur Anwendung.\nBetrachtet man ex-ante (vor dem \u00a8\nUbergang zu einem MNU) Unterschiede zwis-\nchen national und international agierenden Unternehmen, so ergeben sich klar\numrissene theoretische Aussagen. Die Gr\u00a8\nundung oder der Erwerb ausl\u00a8\nandischer\nTochterunternehmen macht eine \u00a8\nUberwindung rechtlicher, kultureller und sozialer\nHindernisse notwendig. Da nur erfolgreiche Firmen dazu in der Lage sind, mit\nderartigen Fixkosten umzugehen, kommt es zur Selbstselektion solcher Firmen in\nausl\u00a8\nandische M\u00a8\narkte. Ob ein Regimewechsel von nationalen zu multinationalen\nAktivit\u00a8\naten auch nach dem \u00a8\nUbergang zu besseren Betriebsergebnissen auf dem\nHeimatmarkt f\u00a8\nuhrt, ist weniger offensichtlich. Besteht die einzige Alternative einen\nAuslandsmarkt zu beliefern darin, vor Ort ein Tochterunternehmen zu gr\u00a8\nunden oder\nzu erwerben, so sollte sich dies nicht negativ oder im g\u00a8\nunstigsten Fall sogar positiv\nauf das heimische Unternehmen auswirken. Falls andererseits ein multinationales\nUnternehmen zum Zwecke der vertikalen Zergliederung des Produktionsprozesses\ngegr\u00a8\nundet wird, kann dies die Charakteristika des Mutterunternehmens sowohl pos-\nitiv als auch negativ beeinflussen. Die Frage, ob Auslandsinvestitionen die Leis-\ntungsf\u00a8\nahigkeit des Heimatmarktunternehmens verbessern, ist daher vor allem eine\nempirische Problemstellung.\nDie vorliegende Arbeit kommt zu folgenden Resultaten: W\u00a8\nahrend der Jahre\nvor dem Regimewechsel besch\u00a8\naftigen zuk\u00a8\nunftige multinationale Unternehmen im\nVergleich zur ihrer einheimischen Konkurrenz mehr Personen, zahlen h\u00a8\nohere\nL\u00a8\nohne, produzieren mit gr\u00a8\no\u00dferem Kapitaleinsatz und weisen ein h\u00a8\noheres Produk-\ntivit\u00a8\natsniveau auf. Diese Ergebnisse werden auch von mehreren \"two-sample\"\nKolmogorov-Smirnov-Tests best\u00a8\natigt. Dabei zeigt sich, dass bezogen auf oben\ngenannte Charakteristika die Verteilungsfunktionen f\u00a8\nur nationale Unternehmen\nlinks von solchen f\u00a8\nur zuk\u00a8\nunftig international t\u00a8\natige Firmen liegen. Betrachtet\nman Wachstumsdifferenzen, so stellt sich heraus, dass signifikante Unterschiede\nnur im Hinblick auf die Entwicklung der Firmengr\u00a8\no\u00dfen (vor dem Regimewechsel)\nbestehen. Nach dem \u00a8\nUbergang zu internationalen Aktivit\u00a8\naten wachsen sowohl die\nProduktivit\u00a8\nat als auch die durchschnittliche L\u00a8\nohne schneller als bei rein national\nagierenden Unternehmen. Das Verh\u00a8\naltnis von Kapital zu Arbeit entwickelt sich\nin Richtung eines h\u00a8\noheren monet\u00a8\naren Einsatzes, ein weiterhin schnelleres Wachs-\ntum hinsichtlich der Besch\u00a8\naftigung bei den neu gegr\u00a8\nundeten multinationalen Un-\nternehmen kann nach dem Regimewechsel nicht mehr festgestellt werden. Dar\u00a8\nuber\nhinaus weist die Verwendung des Heckman (1978) Sch\u00a8\natzers Selektionsproblemen\neinige Bedeutung zu. So zeigt sich, dass das Wachstum der TFP im ersten Jahr nach\nder Gr\u00a8\nundungsentscheidung, die Arbeitsproduktivit\u00a8\nat im ersten und zweiten Jahr\nnach dem Regimewechsel und schlie\u00dflich der Kapitaleinsatz w\u00a8\nahrend des gesamten\nStichprobenzeitraums signifikant von Selektionsproblemen beeinflusst wird.\nContents\n2 Related Literature 3\n3 Data and Construction of Performance Measures 5\n4 How much better are Multinationals? 8\n5 Performance before Switching 11\n5.1 Ex-ante differences in levels . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n5.2 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the equality of distributions . . . . . . 12\n5.3 Ex-ante differences in growth rates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n6 The decision to become a multinational 17\n7 Performance after switching 21\n7.1 Theoretical considerations of post-investment developments . . . . 21\n7.2 Empirical considerations of post-investment developments . . . . . 23\nA Sample attrition of the Buba USTAN data set 28\nB Aggregated sector definitions 28\nC Construction of total factor productivity 29\nList of Tables\nVS.

The abrupt increase of multinational activ-\nities towards the end of the 20th century has raised concerns that domestic firms'\nforeign operations negatively affect home economies. Most managers and business\nleaders do not share this opinion. They consider international expansions of do-\nmestic firms as an important channel to enhance competitiveness. Economists can\ncontribute to the heated political debate by evaluating performance characteristics\nof multinational enterprises (MNEs) relative to purely domestic firms. Since multi-\nnationals do not arise randomly \u00ad only good firms accept the risk to invest abroad \u00ad\nselectivity issues need to be taken into account.\nIn this paper, I investigate to what extent MNEs have superior performance at-\ntributes, both prior to and after they have switched from national to multinational\nactivities. For this purpose the following questions are posed: How much better\nare multinationals? Do only successful firms invest abroad? And do MNEs grow\nfaster than national companies? To answer the first question I discuss differences\nbetween domestic firms, newly founded multinationals, and existing MNEs. The\nsecond and the third topics are covered by a comparison of new multinationals and\nnational firms before, at the time of, and after switching. To assess a broad range\nof firm attributes, I have constructed five different performance measures: 1) firm\nsize; 2) total factor productivity (TFP); 3) labour productivity; 4) average wage per\nfirm; 5) capital intensities. Selectivity problems necessitate applying an endoge-\nnous treatment approach for the evaluation of ex-post performance characteristics.\nTherefore, using probit estimates of the decision to become a MNE, Heckman's\n(1978) treatment model is used to account for potential endogeneity issues.\nTheoretical predictions are clear cut if ex-ante (before switching) performance\nI thank Sascha O. Becker, Marc Muendler, Joachim Winter, and Peter Egger for helpful remarks.\nSeminar participants at the Ifo Institute, University of Munich, Deutsche Bundesbank, and Claudia\nBuch in particular made helpful suggestions. I thank Heinz Herrmann, Alexander Lipponer, Fred\nRamb, and Thomas Wenger for access to and ongoing support with the BuBa MIDI and USTAN data.\nI gratefully acknowledge financial support from the VolkswagenStiftung under its grant initiative\nGlobal Structures and Their Governance, administrative and financial support from the Ifo Institute\nand the Deutsche Bundesbank. All remaining deficiencies are my responsibility.\ndifferences are considered. When starting up or acquiring foreign affiliates, firms\nneed to overcome legal, cultural, and social barriers. Only good firms are able\nto cope with this kind of fixed costs and, thus, self-select into foreign markets.\nWhether the regime change from national to multinational activities also improves\nhome market performance after switching is less obvious. Theoretical models in\nthis respect are ambiguous. If there is no other alternative to serve foreign markets\nbesides the set-up or acquisition of an affiliate (horizontal perspective), becoming\na MNE would have no negative or even positive effects on domestic operations.\nIf, in contrast, the purpose of a multinational's foundation is to vertically divide\nits production process, performance measures could rise or decline. Firm size, for\nexample, is expected to suffer from cost-saving motives. An overall gain in com-\npetitiveness through cost reductions, on the other hand, may increase the number\nof employees at the parent location. The possible co-existence of market seeking\nand cost-reducing forces also makes predictions about the effect of switching on\ndomestic productivity ambiguous. Learning effects due to new technological and\nmanagerial inputs may play a positive role. Contrariwise, the efforts of restructur-\ning a newly founded multi-plant enterprise could be accompanied by productivity\nlosses at the domestic operation. Similar pros and cons can be discussed for all\nperformance measures, and I proceed with a more extensive discussion of these is-\nsues in chapter 7.1. The crucial point, however, is that whether investing abroad\nimproves home market performance or not is, in the end, an empirical question.\nMy findings provide clear evidence throughout the following points: During the\nyears prior to the regime change, switchers exhibit higher performance attributes\nin levels, i.e. they are larger in size, pay higher wages, produce with higher cap-\nital intensities, and they are more productive. These results are confirmed by a\ntwo-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test on the equality of performance distri-\nbutions. For all firm characteristics, distribution functions for nationals lie to the\nleft of those for switchers. In terms of growth rates, significant ex-ante differences\nbetween newly founded MNEs and national firms can only be found with respect\nto the size of the operation. After the regime change, both productivity and wage\ngrowth are higher for switchers than for nationals. Capital intensities at multina-\ntionals evolve towards the use of capital, and switching does not affect firm size.\nMoreover, the implementation of Heckman's (1978) endogenous treatment estima-\ntor suggests that self-selection matters. Though results are somewhat mixed here,\nI find evidence that TFP growth in the first year after going multinational, labour\nproductivity in the first and second period after becoming a MNE, and capital inten-\nsities for the whole sample period are significantly influenced by selectivity issues.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Starting point is a brief\nsummary of the existing literature. An overview of the data and a short discussion\nof the different performance measures is provided in section 3. Section 4 compares\nexisting MNEs and switchers. Then I offer a detailed discussion of ex-ante differ-\nences in levels and growth rates, also including a set of Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.\nThe determinants of the switching decision are derived within a probit framework in\nchapter 6, and ex-post performance differences are discussed in section 7. Section 8\nconcludes the paper.\n2 Related Literature\nIn a theoretical model Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004) describe the relationship\nbetween firm productivity and the engagement in different stages of international\ntrade. Highly productive firms become multinationals (MNEs), less productive\ncompanies serve foreign markets by exports, and the least productive firms stay\non their domestic markets. Based on these predictions, Girma, Kneller and Pisu\n(2005) present an empirical investigation for the UK using the concept of statis-\ntical dominance. They clearly confirm that productivity distributions are ordered\naccording to the Helpman et al. (2005) paper. Girma et al. (2005) also try to test\nfor \"marginal firms\", i.e. they evaluate productivity differences between first-time\nexporters and nationals, on the one hand, and newly founded, foreign owned MNEs\n(non-UK MNEs) and domestic producers, on the other. In their investigations some\nweak evidence of self selection for newly founded (foreign) MNEs and even weaker\nsupport of superior productivity for marginal exporters is found. In a similar study,\nArnold and Hussinger (2005b) test the Helpman et al. (2005) setting for a sample of\nGerman manufacturers. Comparing the productivity distributions of purely national\ncompanies, domestic exporters, and firms with outward investment, their results ex-\nhibit clear support for the predictions of the theoretical model. In another recent\nstudy, Tomiura (2004) turns to a sample of 118 thousand Japanese manufacturers\nin order to conduct a productivity comparison between outsourcing, exporting, and\nFDI. He concludes that FDI firms are more productive than foreign outsourcing\nfirms, which are equally productive as exporters and clearly more productive than\ndomestic firms.\nEarlier research mainly focuses on partial tests of the relationship suggested by\nHelpman et al. (2005). Starting with the comparison of exporters and nationals,\nClerides, Lach and Tybout (1998) ask whether learning by exporting is of impor-\ntance. Their empirical investigations show that more efficient firms become ex-\nporters, but that there is no backward link between previous exporting activities\nand the firms' cost structures. A study with German data is Arnold and Hussinger\n(2005a). It is based on firm level data for the manufacturing sector in Germany and\ntries to reveal the causal relationship between export status and productivity. As in\nmost other studies on this topic, Arnold and Hussinger show that higher productiv-\nity leads to self selection into foreign markets, but being an exporter does not come\ntogether with productivity gains on the domestic market. Girma and Greenaway\n(2002) use matching methods, usually applied in the evaluation literature of active\nlabour market programmes, as a means to detect the direction of causality \u00ad from\nhigh performance to exports or vice versa. As an exception to other authors, they\nfind for a sample of UK manufactures that exporting increases firms' productiv-\nity causatively. Bernard and Jensen (1999) use a similar framework as I do when\nanalysing ex-ante and ex-post performance evolutions of newcomers on export mar-\nkets. They find distinctive evidence that successful firms \u00ad as measured in levels and\ngrowth rates \u00ad become exporters. However, their study provides less clear results\nwith respect to the benefits of breaking into foreign markets: employment growth\nand the survival probability seem to be higher for exporters but productivity and\nwage growth dominate the growth rates at national firms. Beyond other studies,\nboth Bernard and Jensen (1999) and my analysis do not solely focus on productiv-\nity measures but use a wide range of performance characteristics. The paper at hand,\nas opposed to Bernard and Jensen (1999), considers MNEs instead of exporters and\ntakes the endogeneity of the investment decision into account.\nApart from the relation between exporting and merely serving domestic mar-\nkets, some studies compare multinationals and domestic producers as well as multi-\nnationals and exporting firms. An example for the first case is Castellani and\nNavaretti (2004). Employing propensity score techniques for Italian manufacturers,\nthe authors analyse the effect of FDI on firm characteristics like employment or pro-\nductivity growth. The results suggest that foreign expansions improve the growth\nof productivity and output but exhibit no significant impact on employment. Egger\nand Pfaffermayr (2003), on the other hand, try to evaluate the investment behaviour\nof MNEs if they were purely exporting firms. In other words, they are searching for\nthe counterfactual domestic investment to foreign activities. Using three different\nmethods to account for the endogeneity of the FDI decision, Egger and Pfaffermayr\n(2003) show for a sample of Austrian manufacturers that foreign activities do not\ndiminish domestic investment in intangible assets, while they increase investment\nin tangible assets.\n3 Data and Construction of Performance Measures\nIn the study at hand I use data from the USTAN (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik) data\nmany that draws a bill of exchange in a given year is required by law to report its\nbalance sheet to BuBa, which collects this information in its USTAN data base when\nthe bill of exchange is rediscounted. The draft of bills of exchange remains a com-\nmon form of payment in Germany. However, increases in BuBa's value threshold\nfor reporting resulted in several drops of the sample and a decrease of the sam-\nthe described sample reduction on the distribution of the variables employment and\ncapital stock .1 The table implies the existence of an attrition bias with respect to\nlarge companies, i.e. in later years mainly smaller firms drop from the USTAN data\nbase. Among the variables extracted from USTAN are employment, firm age, in-\nvestment, tangible and intangible assets, profits, intermediate inputs, et cetera. All\nfinancial figures included in the analysis are deflated to unity at year end 1998 using\nthe German CPI (from the IMF's International Financial Statistics).2\nInformation on outward FDI from Germany is obtained from the MIDI database\n(Microdatabase Directinvestment) of the Deutsche Bundesbank at the level of Ger-\nman parents and their foreign affiliates. A firm is defined as a newly founded MNE\n(switcher) if the parent identifier appears in the MIDI dataset for the first time.3\nThat is a multinational emerges if it \"[...] acquires a substantial controlling interest\n1The table depicts summary statistics for the overall USTAN data set without any further adapta-\ntions.\nthe introduction of the euro in early 1999 makes December 1998 a natural reference date.\n3A parent appears before 1999 if it controls at least 20 percent of its foreign affiliates' equity and\nthe affiliates' balance sheet total is at least 1 million DM. After 1998 the affiliates had to satisfy either\nof the following two criteria: (i) the parent controls at least 10 percent of equity and the balance sheet\ntotal is at least 5 million EUR; or (ii) the parent controls at least 50 percent of equity and the balance\nsheet is at least 0.5 million EUR. Lipponer (2003) stresses that the modification of the notification\nlimit in 1999 changes the number of reported affiliates significantly. However, as table 1 shows, the\nnumber of newly emerging parent firms is not affected by this change. It seems somewhat surprising\nthat the number of switchers drops both in the MIDI and in the matched data set in 2001, although\nthere is no further modification of the notification limit.\nin a foreign firm or sets up a subsidiary in a foreign country\" (compare Markusen\nFirms from the MIDI database were string-matched by name to companies in\nthe BuBa USTAN data set.4 Overall, a total of 2,955 different firms were merged.\nIn Becker, Ekholm, J\u00a8\nackle and Muendler (2005b) (appendices A and B), the string\nmatching procedure is described in more detail.\nBoth the USTAN as well as the MIDI data sets are available in the form of an\nunbalanced panel. Firms in the USTAN data base can be followed throughout the\nyears 1992 to 2001 if they draw a bill of exchange every year.

The first step of the productivity (TFP) estimates refers to the time span 1992-2001, the\nsecond step and therefore the construction of TFP refers to the period 1993-2001, and the overall\n6Since for unmatched multinationals no parent information is available, performance attributes\nof matched FDI firms cannot be compared to characteristics of the overall number of multinationals\nin the MIDI data set.\n7In this paper firms are defined as legally independent operations that draws a bill of exchange in\na certain year.\nfirms founded for the mere purpose of acquiring or building up foreign affiliates,\nall parent companies that belong to the Nace 4digit sectors 6523 (other financial\nintermediation) and 7415 (management activities of holding companies) as well as\ncompanies with firm age below 5 years or firm size below 8 employees are removed\nfrom the estimation sample. Additionally, to prevent outliers from affecting\nresults, variable values larger than the 99% and smaller than the 1% quantile were\nexamined and if necessary dropped from the estimation sample. The large size of\nthe USTAN sample allows for the use of Nace 4digit sector codes. However, for\nsome estimations I have classified the firms into seven different industry branches.\nDetails of the aggregation can be found in table 8, appendix B.\nFive different firm attributes are employed in order to describe differences in\nthe performance of switchers and nationals: 1) firm size; 2) total factor productivity\n(TFP); 3) labour productivity; 4) average wage per firm; 5) capital labour ratios.\nAs usual, firm size is measured by the number of employees. Total factor pro-\nductivity is unobservable and therefore needs to be estimated. The strategy in my\nstudy is to restrict technology parameters to a Cobb-Douglas production function\nand view the residual from the relationship between output and input factors as TFP.\nAs is well known since the paper of Marschak and Andrews (1944), the correlation\nbetween unobserved, firm-specific productivity shocks and the firm's input choice\ncauses a simultaneity bias.8 In the literature different ways to deal with this prob-\nlem have been documented. Following Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and\nPetrin (2003), I use both investment in tangible and intangible assets and, in another\n8In addition, if companies with smaller capital stock are more likely to close down their opera-\ntions in consequence of a negative productivity shock, a selectivity problem occurs. In the USTAN\ndata set firms drop out of the sample if they either exit the market or do not draw a bill of exchange\nin a certain year. Since it is not possible to distinguish these reasons, the selectivity issue cannot be\naddressed with the data at hand.\nspecification, intermediate input goods as proxies to address the simultaneity prob-\nlem. Consequently, three different TFP variables are constructed: a) TFP Olley and\nPakes (O.P.), using a semiparametric estimation approach, including regional dum-\nmies, a time trend, and applying Olley's and Pake's investment proxy; b) TFP O.P.\nfirm age, as a) but using firm age as an additional control variable;9c) TFP Levin-\nsohn and Petrin (L.P.), using the Stata ado file levpet (see Levinsohn, Petrin and Poi\n(2003)), which applies intermediate input goods as investment proxy. Appendix C\nincludes a more detailed comparison of the different estimation methods.\nIn order to evaluate performance measures with respect to the firms' workforce,\nlabour productivity, as constructed by the ratio of value added over employment,\nand the average wage per firm, measured as wage bill divided by employment, are\nused in the analysis. Finally, to assess capital intensities among different firms,\ncapital labour ratios are used as a performance attribute.\n4 How much better are Multinationals?\nCommon sense leads to the conclusion that multinational enterprises exhibit su-\nperior performance characteristics compared to their domestic competitors with-\nout foreign affiliates. In this section, I discuss differences between non-MNEs and\nnewly founded multinationals, in the year of switching, as well as differences be-\ntween existing multinationals and national firms.10\nPerformance gaps between both groups are calculated as percentage values in\nthe following regression:\nlogPi,t\nMNEi,t\n(+ Ci,t\nstatei\nsectori\nyeart\n+ ui,t\nwhere Pi,t\ndepicts the corresponding performance measure, MNEi,t\nis a dummy\nvariable that indicates multinational activities, statei\n, sectori\n, and yeart\nrefer to\nregion, industry and time dummies respectively, and Ci,t\nstands for the additional\n9In order to increase the number of observations, I did not employ firm age as explanatory vari-\nable in a).\n10The data at hand do not include information about export activities of firms. A domestic en-\nterprise can therefore merely serve national markets or additionally be active on export markets. In\nthis respect, another caveat is the missing possibility to identify domestic firms which are owned by\nforeign multinationals. In a recent study, Criscuolo and Martin (2003) find evidence for what they\ncall the \"MNE effect\": MNEs, of foreign and domestic origin, are more productive than domestic\nfirms. Either of these points might affect the results of this paper in the same way: Switching pre-\nmia calculated on different occasions could be downward biased since the comparison group goes\nbeyond the definition of purely national firms in the above manner.\ncontrol variables age and size.11\nTable 2 provides estimation results of the above equation. Each cell includes the\ncoefficient of the MNEi,t\ndummy for another (dependent) performance variable.\nColumns (3) and (4) report the premia of already being a MNE between 1996 and\n2001, whereas columns (1) and (2) describe the premia of becoming a MNE for the\nperiod 1997 to 2001. In the later case, all existing MNEs as well as switchers before\nand after the time of switching were removed from the estimation sample. Columns\n(2) and (4) depict results after adding additional controls (Ci,t\n).\nThe performance gap for all firm attributes is positive and significantly different\nfrom zero.12 Largest differences are found with respect to firm size. The number\nof employees at existing multinationals is 130% to 140% higher than at national\nfirms. At the time of switching, newly founded MNEs are about twice as large as\nnationals.\nAll productivity measures exhibit a persistent efficiency gap. Differences in to-\ntal factor productivity range from 22% to 66%. As in the case of firm size, being a\nMNE goes along with a higher performance differential than becoming a multina-\ntional.13 This could be seen as first evidence for the existence of a positive perfor-\nmance dynamic after switching, i.e becoming a MNE could have a positive impact\non the post-investment productivity of parent firms.\nPerformance measures related to the firms' work force, labour productivity\nand average wages show positive differences for all specifications. Wages (value\nthan at national firms. In the yea of the regime change, MNE mark-ups for average\ndifferences might indicate a skill bias towards high skilled workers in the labour\nforce of MNEs.\n11The dimension of the domestic operation is approximated by the number of employees. It is not\nincluded if the dependent variable, Pi,t, is firm size.\n12To improve comparability between sectors I also constructed performance characteristics in de-\nviation of the corresponding sector means. The use of these relative measures as dependent variables\nin equation 1 did not alter performance premia in any important way. Another consistency check\nwas to construct equal sample sizes for each performance regression related to a certain column of\ntable 2. Again, results did not change in an important manner. Estimation results for both modifica-\ntions are available on request.\n13Specifications with additional control variables exhibit a difference of about five percentage\npoints between specifications (2) and (4), whereas columns (1) and (3), excluding the variables firm\nage and size, show larger differences of around 10 percentage points.\nSwitchersa Switchers, controlb MNE MNE, control\na Switchers are observed in the first year of being a MNE.

Switchers are observed between\nFinally, I also investigate performance distinctions with respect to capital labour\nratios. Differences in the capital intensities are between 18% and 21% for switchers\nand 14% and 33% for multinationals already active on foreign markets for a couple\nof years. This fits with the argument that being a MNE is accompanied by a shift\nin the firms' labour demand from production to non-production workers, meaning\nthat average wages and capital intensities are both higher at MNEs than at national\nfirms.\nTable 2 should not be misunderstood in view of a causal link between multina-\ntional activities and growing performance attributes at the home market. Rather, the\nresults reveal positive correlation patterns that confirm inherent performance differ-\nences for a series of firm characteristics. It is shown that multinational enterprises\nexhibit superior performance features. Differences are even larger if firms were\nalready active on foreign markets for a couple of years. The following chapters\ninvestigate the performance premia of switchers in more detail.\n5 Performance before Switching\nMany studies have shown that multinationals outperform firms that serve only do-\nmestic markets.14 Barba Navaretti and Venables (2004) argue that \"MNEs are larger\nand sometimes more productive than national firms.\" In a recent paper Helpman\net al. (2004) state that productivity differences on the home market lead to self-\nselection into foreign activities.\nWhen companies start up or acquire affiliates in foreign countries, they have to\novercome a number of barriers to entry. Caves (1996) claims in his book that \"the\nbusiness firm [...] has a clear-cut national base and identity, with its internal planing\nand decision making carried out in the context of that nation's legal and cultural\nframework.\" That is, when investing abroad, firms need to deal with fixed costs due\nto legal, cultural, and social differences. Hence, it seems obvious that only firms\nwith successful operations on domestic markets can handel the additional efforts\nthat accompany the setting up of foreign affiliates.\nIn this chapter two questions concerning ex-ante performance differences are\nassessed empirically: 1) Is there a performance gap (in levels) between switchers\nand nationals firms before switching? 2) What about performance growth in the run\nup to become a MNE? To back up these investigations, in section 5.2 a Kolmogorov-\nSchmirnov test is conducted.\n5.1 Ex-ante differences in levels\nIn chapter 4 evidence was found that multinationals at the time of switching have\nsuperior performance characteristics compared to their national counterparts. Con-\nsequently, the next step is to ask whether these differences also exist in the years\nprior to the regime change. To do so, the following equation is estimated:\nlogPi,T-t\nSwitchi,T\n(+ Ci,T-t\nstatei\nsectori\nyearT-t\n+ui,T-t\n,\n(t=1,2,3).15 Performance attributes are assessed over a period of three years be-\nfore switching. The corresponding time dimensions of the dependent variables in\nEach cell of table 3 includes coefficients of the Switchi,T\ndummy. Performance\ngaps for all firm attributes are significantly positive and \u00ad when taking confidence\nintervals on the estimators into account \u00ad roughly consistent over time.16 Again,\nfirm size exhibits the largest differences. These are between 100% (98% without\nadditional controls) in T - 1 and 96% (91%) in T - 3. Performance premia for\nswitchers with respect to total factor productivity range from 26% (53%) in the\nyear before switching to 22% (48%) three years before the regime change. More-\nwages, have a 23%-25% (22%) larger valued added per worker, and capital inten-\ntable 2 shows that performance differences, found in the year of switching, already\nexisted in about the same magnitude one to three years before the according firms\nbecame multinationals.\n5.2 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the equality of distributions\nTo back up the investigations in section 5.1 a number of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)\ntwo-sample tests on the equality of performance distributions are conducted.17 The\nKS test provides the possibility to determine differences in the distributions of firm\nattributes for switchers and non-multinationals. That is, it compares not only the\n15All other variables are defined according to the covariates in equation 1.\n16Performance measures in deviation of the according sector means and equal sample sizes did\nnot alter results.\n17These tests are implemented using the software package Stata. The KS test has no underlying\ndistributional assumptions. It is therefore a non-parametric test. Additionally, t-tests on mean-\ndifferences were accomplished. They confirm the findings in the KS setting.\na Performance characteristics of switchers are observed in the three years before switching (lag1 - lag3).\nb Coefficients in columns (2), (4) and (6) are estimated using firm age and firm size as additional control variables. In row (1)\nonly firm age is used as an additional control variable.\nc Each cell includes the coefficient of the Switchi,T dummy for another performance variable in the regression\nlogPi,T -t\n(+ Ci,T -t\n) + 1statei + 2sectori + 3yearT -t\n+ ui,T -t, where T is the date of\nswitching (1997-2001), t is the according time lag (t=1,2,3), Pi,T -t is the performance variable, statei is a vector of Ger-\nman state dummies, sectori is a vector of 7 aggregated industry dummies, and yearT -t are yearly time dummies. Standard\nerrors are in parenthesis. If a parameter fails to be significant at the 10% level, it is set in italics.\nd The number of observations refer to the overall number of firms in each performance regression (N overall P) and to the\nnumber of switchers (N treat. P). Performance measures of switchers are observed between 1994 and 2000. The formation\nof new MNEs (switching) is observed between 1997 and 2001. All existing MNEs as well as switchers before and after the\ntime of switching were removed from the estimation sample.\nfirst moments of the distribution functions but tests if the distribution (density) of\nPt\nwith respect to newly founded MNEs is to the right of the one for national firms.\nuse the above setting to check whether productivity levels of multinationals exceed\nthose of exporters, which in turn are questioned to be grater than the productivity\nlevels of purely national firms. Their studies accomplish a set of Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov tests on a contemporaneous basis, i.e. they ask whether existing MNEs\nare significantly different to nationals and exporters. Girma et al. (2005) also apply\nKS tests on a subset of first-time exporters in the period before they change export\nstatus and on a sample of foreign owned domestic firms in the year before they were\nacquired by foreign multinationals. Unlike the above studies, the paper at hand tests\nfor differences in parent characteristics between future multinationals and nationals\nup to three years before switching.\nTable 10 in the appendix provides results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for\nthree time lags. The first block (rows (1) - (6)) refers to performance differences\nin t - 1, the second one to t - 2, and the third block to differences in t - 3. The\nKS test makes use of the maximum vertical difference (D) between the distribu-\ntion functions of switchers (F(Ps\nt\n)) and nationals (F(Pn\nt\ninclude the largest positive deviations, D+ = max(F(Pn\nt\n) - F(Ps\nt\n)), in the cumu-\nlative fractions of both groups. The corresponding p-values are reported in the lines\nbelow.18 Thus, the hypothesis that the distribution function of Pt\nfor nationals lies\nto the left of the distribution function for switchers is tested by asking whether Pt\nfor nationals contains smaller values than for newly founded multinationals. Ac-\ncordingly, maximum deviations in lines (3), (9) and (15) are defined as the statistic\nD- = max(F(Ps\nt\n) - F(Pn\nt\n)) = min(F(Pn\nt\n) - F(Ps\nt\n)). These rows, together\nwith (4), (10), and (16), test the hypothesis that Pt\nfor nationals exhibits larger val-\nues than for switchers. Finally, row (5) of each block includes the combined test\nstatistic D = max(|D+|, |D+|).\nResults depicted in table 10 clearly confirm the findings in section 5.1.19 In\neach of the three years before switching, national firms exhibit significantly smaller\nperformance measures than future MNEs. For all firm characteristics, distribution\nfunctions for nationals lie to the left of those for switchers. The hypothesis that\nPt\nfor domestic producers exhibits larger values than for multinationals could be\n18All p-values presented in table 10 are based on on the asymptotic distributions derived by\n19Implementing KS tests with performance measures in deviation of the according sector means\ndid alter vertical differences D slightly but had no impact on the overall results.\nrejected overwhelmingly. Furthermore, p-values of the combined test statistics are\nnot higher than 0.003 and therefore reject the null hypothesis of the equality of\ndistributions clearly.\nHence, my investigations so far show that not only existing MNEs outperform\nnational firms but also newly founded MNEs during the time before switching have\nsuperior performance attributes compared to their national counterparts.\n5.3 Ex-ante differences in growth rates\nAt this stage of the paper a second question emerges. If level differences in per-\nformance attributes show stable premia for switchers, it seems natural to analyse\ndeviations of performance growth rates in the run up to becoming a multinational.\nFor that purpose the following regressions are run:\n[logPi,T\n- logPi,T-t\nSwitchi,T\n(+ Ci,T-t\n) +\nstatei\nsectori\nyearT-t\n+ ui,T-t\nwhere T is the date of switching (1997-2001) and t is the corresponding time lag\n(t=1,2,3).20 Growth rates are measured as yearly averages assessed over the three\npreceding years up to switching. So, the corresponding time dimensions of the\nThe coefficient 1 of the Switchi,T\ndummy measures the average differences\nin growth rates per year between switchers and multinationals. Table 4 depicts\nresults for the related time lags and all performance attributes. In the three years\nleading up to switching (columns (5) and (6)), employment (2 percentage points)\nand total factor productivity (1-2 percentage points) exhibit significantly higher\ngrowth rates at companies that become MNEs than at national firms.21 Average\nperformance growth during the two preceding years before the regime change\nis significantly larger (3-4 percentage points) at future multinationals only with\nrespect to employment. In the last year before investing abroad, again, only\nemployment turns out to have superior growth rates. These are 3-5 percentage\npoints higher at future MNEs than at domestic companies.\n20All other variables are defined according to the covariates in equation 1.\n21Performance measures in deviation of the according sector means and equal sample sizes did\nnot alter results.\na Growth rates are measured as yearly averages assessed over the three preceding years up to switching (lag1-lag3).\nb Coefficients in columns (2), (4), and (6) are estimated using firm age and firm size as additional control variables. In row\n(1) only firm age is used as an additional control variable.\nc Each cell includes the coefficient of the Switchi,T dummy of the following performance regressions [logPi,T\n-\nlogPi,T -t\n]/t = 0 + 1Switchi,T\n(+ Ci,T -t\n) + 1statei + 2sectori + 3yearT -t\n+ ui,T -t, where T is the date\n- logPi,T -t\n]/t is the yearly average growth\nrate, statei is a vector of German state dummies, sectori is a vector of 7 aggregated industry dummies, and yearT -t are\nyearly time dummies. Standard errors are in parenthesis. If a parameter fails to be significant at the 10% level, it is set in\nitalics.\nd The number of observations refer to the overall number of firms in each performance regression (N overall P) and to the\nnumber of switchers (N treat. P). Performance measures of switchers are observed between 1994 and 2001. The formation\nof new MNEs (switching) is observed between 1997 and 2001. All existing MNEs as well as switchers before and after the\ntime of switching were removed from the estimation sample.\nConsequently, the above findings may be interpreted as evidence that firms\npreparing for a forthcoming expansion to foreign markets have additional personnel\nrequirements. Unfortunately, with the data at hand a distinction between low and\nhigh skilled workers is not possible. Since theory predicts that firms demand dif-\nferent amounts of high and low skilled labour, this is perhaps a field that requires\nfurther research.\nMy findings up to this point show clear differences between future multination-\nals and national firms. In the years prior to the regime change, switchers exhibit\nhigher performance attributes in levels, they are larger in size, pay higher wages,\nproduce with higher capital intensities, and they are more productive. Furthermore,\naverage employment at firms that become MNEs is found to grow faster. Hence, it\nseems that success on the home market leads to self-selection into foreign markets.\n6 The decision to become a multinational\nTaking the selectivity issues raised at the end of chapter 5 into account necessitates\nmodelling the \u00ad possibly endogenous \u00ad decision to become a MNE. One of the\nmost common approaches to incorporate endogenous treatment effects is the Heck-\nman (1978) estimator. When using this method, it is necessary to employ a probit\nmodel that includes the determinants of the switching decision. A binary choice\nmodel suffers from the shortcoming that it does not allow the inclusion of (foreign)\nlocation specific variables.22 It is, however, possible to apply indirect measures that\ncontrol for host country effects. To construct such variables I use average foreign\naffiliate characteristics of existing MNEs. These attributes allow an augmentation\nof the probit specifications with information on host country specifics of existing\nmultinationals active in the same home market sector as potential switchers. Fur-\nther details of this kind of controls are discussed below.\nIn a recent study, Becker, Ekholm and Muendler (2005a) estimate reduced-form\nlocation choice functions in order to control for selectivity issues in a multina-\ntional's location-specific labour demand. In this section, I present an adapted ver-\nsion of their first-step, location-choice model to explain driving forces behind the\ndecision to become a multinational.\nIn period t - 1 a firm's management decides whether to invest in foreign loca-\n22Econometric models that allow us to control for country specific attributes are, for example, the\nconditional or the nested logit model. For a more elaborate evaluation of this problem, see Becker,\nEkholm, J\u00a8\ntions or not. Becoming a MNE in period t means producing a vector of final goods\nXi,t\n= (xH\ni,t\n, xF\ni,t\n) at home (xH\ni,t\n) and abroad (xF\ni,t\n), whereas staying means serving\nforeign markets by exports or producing solely for the national market (Xi,t\n= xH\ni,t\n).\nFor its switching decision the firm i maximises expected profits\n(i,t\n) = Ei,t-1\n(p Xi,t\n- ci,t\n(Xi,t\n, wt\nwhere p are final goods prices on competitive world markets, and ci,t\n(.) is a firm's\ncost function depending on output Xi,t\nand a vector of (home and foreign specific)\ninput prices wt\n. Given the above optimization problem, a firm's \"switching-rule\"\ncan be written as\nSwitch iff : Ei,t-1\n[i,t\n(xF\ni,t\n, xH\n) - i,t\n(xF\ni,t\n)] > Fi,t\nwhere Fi,t\nare sunk costs the firm faces when investing abroad, xF\ni,t\n is the part\nof the output vector that is produced in foreign locations, xH\n is the fraction of\nX\ni,t\nproduced at home in case of an investment aborad, and xH\n is the optimal\ndomestic output in case no foreign affiliates are founded.23 Using equation 4 in 5\nand adding a stochastic error term ui,t\nwith zero mean and variance 2\nu\nyields:\nSi,t\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[p X\ni,t\n] - Ei,t-1\n[ci,t\n(xF\ni,t\n, xH\n, wi,t\n)-\n-ci,t\n(xF\ni,t\n, wi,t\n)] - Fi,t\n+ ui,t\n0 otherwise,\nwhere Si,t\n= 1 means a firm decides to become a MNE, Ei,t-1\n[p X\ni,t\n] are ex-\npected revenues from producing the optimal amount of output, and the second\nterm on the right hand side of equation 6, Ei,t-1\n[ci,t\n(xF\ni,t\n, xH\n, wti,t\n) - ci,t\n(xF\ni,t\n=\n, wti,t\n)], depicts the cost benefits of producing abroad. Assuming ui,t\nto be\nnormally distributed gives rise to a probit model, where the probability to switch is\nestimated as\nP(Si,t\n= 1) = P(S\ni,t\n> 0) = P(ui,t\n> -Z\n - Y\nHere, S\ni,t\nis a latent variable (e.g. the propensity to invest abroad), Zi,t-1 and Ys,t-1\nare vectors that proxy the firm's expectations in period t - 1 with regard to the\ndecision rule of equation 6. Zi,t-1 exhibits variation on the firm level, whereas Ys,t-1\nvaries only over sectors. The dependent variable Si,t\nequals 1 if a firm becomes a\nMNE in period t. All existing MNEs as well as switchers before and after the time\nof switching were removed from the estimation sample.\n does in general not equal xH\n.\nTo proxy expected revenues, Ei,t-1\n[p xF\ni,t\n], I use the log of average affiliate\nturnover domestic competitors realise in their foreign locations in the year before\nswitching, i.e. the average revenue MNEs active in the same home market sector as\npotential switchers make abroad in period t-1. To approximate expected cost ben-\nefits, Ei,t-1\n[ci,t\n(xF\ni,t\n, xH\n, wti,t\n) - ci,t\n(xF\ni,t\n, wti,t\n)], parent firm charac-\nteristics like size (ln employment), ln liabilities/total assets, ln capital/labour ratio,\nln equity, and ln average wage are used. Additionally, as a sector-specific control\nvariable, the log of average wages domestic competitors pay in foreign countries\nare included. Since sunk costs cannot be directly measured, they are approximated\nby including the number of existing MNEs from the same sector in period t - 1. To\naccount for the firm's innovative abilities, the log of its intangible to tangible plus\nintangible assets ratio is included. For the purpose of controling intra-sector mar-\nket power, the proportion of each firm's value added to sector-wide value added is\nincluded. Finally, in most specifications firm age serves as an additional control.24\nApart from the value-added ratio, all sector-specific variables refer to NACE 2-digit\ncodes. Time dummies control for the foundation of MNEs in different years. All\nexplanatory variables are lagged one period.\nSince results of the probit estimates are of main interest with respect to the\nHeckman (1978) estimator applied in section 7, only the most important findings\nare briefly discussed at this point. Estimation results are depicted in table 5. Each\nspecification refers to another lagged productivity measure and is used as selection\nequation for one of the different dependent variables of equation 9. It becomes clear\nfrom either specification that size and productivity in t - 1 are important determi-\nnants of the choice to become a MNE, i.e. high values of these attributes increase\nthe probability to switch. Hence, findings in chapter 5 \u00ad large and productive firms\ngo multinational \u00ad are supported.\nIn line with the existing literature, I find that domestic firms with large intangi-\nble to total assets ratios are more likely to run business abroad than firms staying on\nnational markets. Intangible assets are supposed to have public good characteris-\ntics within multi-plant companies. Markusen (2002) generally names these kind of\nassets \"knowledge capital\". The particular characteristics of the knowledge capital\nshould help companies to overcome potential sunk costs. At this point, my findings\n\u00ad a high rate of intangible assets increases the probability to switch \u00ad might confirm\nMarkusen's theory.\n24In some specifications also firm age squared was included. However, I could not detect any\nsignificant influence and therefore did not report these results in table 5.\n(l.l.) labour productivity .351\nyear dummies yes yes yes yes\na Standard errors are in parenthesis: * significant at ten, ** at five, and *** at one percent.\nSurprisingly, I find a positive correlation between average wages domestic com-\npetitors pay at their foreign locations and the probability to go multinational. Two\narguments may solve this puzzle: First, assuming that the main motive behind in-\nvesting abroad is the access to other countries' markets, high wages in foreign loca-\ntions should simply reflect the fact that most FDI goes to places which are similar\nto Germany in relative factor endowments. Secondly, since Blomstr\u00a8\nom, Fors and\ndence that MNEs tend to locate the more skill-intensive activities abroad my results\nmay indicate a skill-seeking motive behind German foreign direct investments.25\nFinally, another interesting point is the negative influence of credit capital (short\nand long run liabilities/total assets) on the probability to become a multinational.\nThis could both be an indicator for the negative impact of credit constraints, on the\none hand, and \u00ad through the different financing structure of small, medium, and\nlarge firms in Germany \u00ad simply be another criterion for the size of an operation.\n7 Performance after switching\nResults in sections 4 \u00ad 6 provide clear evidence that successful firms \u00ad both before\nand at the date of switching \u00ad become multinationals. Hence, the next issue at hand\nis to investigate firm performance in a post-investment framework. The question at\nthis juncture is what happens to the efficiency of firms in the three years after their\nchoice to become a MNE?\n7.1 Theoretical considerations of post-investment developments\nTheoretical answers to this question are not clear cut. Concerning firm size, it\ndepends on whether the parent retains operations at home that are complemen-\ntary or substitutional to foreign activities. A substitutional relationship, which is\nlikely when cost-saving reasons play a decisive role (vertical FDI), comes along\nwith smaller operations on the home market. Contrariwise, even for purely cost-\nreducing FDI an employment gain at the domestic operation is possible if potential\ncost reductions allow the firm to increase overall market shares. Furthermore, es-\npecially when investing in industrialized countries, market access motives and the\n25To investigate this problem in more detail one needs access to both, the skill structure of foreign\nsubsidiaries and the skill distribution at the German parent firms. Unfortunately such information is\nnot available in the BuBa MIDI and USTAN data.\nproximity-concentration trade-off need to be considered (horizontal FDI).26 In this\ncase, instead of exporting goods MNEs produce at the foreign location. Thus, the\nemployment effect is twofold: On the one hand, the home operation could be larger\nif the firm exported goods to the host country. On the other hand, if there were no\nother opportunity to serve the foreign market besides the set-up of a foreign affiliate,\nbecoming an MNE would have no negative or even positive effects on domestic firm\nsize. Since, in reality, the decision to become an MNE is possibly brought about\nby the co-existence of both cost-reducing and market-seeking motives, the overall\neffect on the parent firm is ambiguous.27\nAnother effect I am interested in is the impact of the switching choice on produc-\ntivity. Again, different theoretical aspects should be considered in this respect. One\nargument for productivity increases at the domestic firm is the public good char-\nacteristic of firm-specific assets. Pfaffermayr (1999) tests for a sample of Austrian\nmanufacturers whether the volume of foreign output influences labour productivity\nat home through multi-plant scale effects. He finds that production at subsidiaries,\nAustrian firms run abroad, increases the productivity at domestic plants. However,\nthe reasons for productivity changes may work in both directions. Barba Navaretti\nand Venables (2004) argue that also changes in the composition of factor inputs\nand learning effects (technological and managerial knowledge) play a role. Since\ntechnological and managerial knowledge exhibit public good characteristics within\nfirms, it seems obvious that learning through switching \u00ad whatever motives (verti-\ncal, horizontal, or both) are behind the decision \u00ad should positively affect domestic\nproductivity. In case of changes in the composition of factor inputs, it is a priori not\nclear whether home market productivity gains or loses from the decision to found\nan MNE. Such changes are very likely to occur if the management vertically di-\nvides the production process, meaning that labour intensive production stages are\nshifted abroad. However, whether in that case efficiency at the remaining operation\nincreases or decreases cannot be predicted. Marin (2004) argues that Austrian and\nGerman firms take advantage of cheap and abundant high skilled labour in Eastern\nand Central Europe. Hence, in this situation the productivity evolution at the domes-\ntic location might suffer. Moreover, the tremendous efforts of restructuring a newly\n26In fact, a major part of German MNEs' foreign operations is concentrated in high- rather than\nlow-income countries.\n27Becker et al. (2005c) test for substitutability of labour in different world regions and Germany.\nThe study conducts analysis for existing MNEs (long- or medium-term perspective) and finds for\nboth industrialized regions (e.g. Western Europe) and for transition countries (Central and Eastern\nEurope) a substitutional relationship.\nfounded multi-plant enterprise may \u00ad at least in the short run \u00ad be accompanied by\nproductivity losses at the domestic location. To put it in a nutshell, with respect to\nthe productivity development after switching, theory provides a good rationale for\nboth the boost and the fall story.\nFinally, also the development of average wages is theoretically not unambigu-\nously predictable. On the firm level, increasing productivity should raise wages.\nThe displacement of labour intensive, blue collar jobs also implies the rise of aver-\nage wages. Otherwise, Marin's (2004) \"skill-searching\" argument could have the\nreverse effect and lower average wages at the domestic location. Moreover, market\naccess motives do not provide any clear cut predictions, either.\nTo draw a conclusion on the above considerations, the effect of going multina-\ntional on firms' size, productivity, average wages, and capital intensities is theoret-\nically ambiguous and it is therefore mainly an empirical question to explore how\nperformance differences evolve after the rise of a new multinational.\n7.2 Empirical considerations of post-investment developments\nAfter having discussed theoretical issues behind performance developments, an em-\npirical examination of the problem needs to be made. The easiest way of evaluating\nthe effect of a regime change on domestic firm attributes is to run simple OLS re-\ngressions of the firms' average outcome changes in T + t on the switching status\nand a number of initial control variables in period T:\n[logPi,T+t\n- logPi,T\nSwitchi,T\n+  Ci,T\n+\nstatei\nsectori\nyearT\n+ ui,T\nwhere T is the date of switching (1997-2000) and t is the time span we look ahead\n(t=1,2,3).

To incorporate endogenous treatment effects a Heckman (1978) esti-\nmator is used to compute the following regression:\n[lnPi,T+t\n- lnPi,T\nSwitchi,T\n+  controli,T\nstatei\nsectori\n+\nyearT\n+  [\n-(Z\n + Y\n)\n + Y\n)\n] + i,T\nS\ni,T\n + i,T\nSi,T\ni,T\nwhere [ -(Zi,T -1 \n+Y\n)\n+Y\n)\n] is called the inverse Mill's ratio (IMR),  is a stan-\ndard normal density, and  is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\nZi,T-1 and Ys,T-1 are variable vectors that proxy the firms' expectations in period\nT - 1 with regard to the decision to become a MNE.29 Estimates of the correspond-\ning coefficients of these variables are taken from table 5.30 Si,T\n= 1 means a firm\nchooses to change status from national to multinational, and S\ni,T\nis a latent variable\nthat describes the propensity to invest. The error terms i,T\nand i,T\nare supposed to\nbe bivariate, normally distributed with correlation  ([ i,T\n, i,T\n]  bivariate normal\nThe coefficient 1 of the Switchi,T\ndummy in 9 measures the average treatment\neffect (ATE), i.e. the expected impact of the switching decision on a randomly\ndrawn firm.31 A likelihood ratio (LR) test on the independence of equations 9 and 10\nallows us to formally test for the occurrence of selectivity issues. If selectivity\nproblems are of no relevance, the ATE is already described by the OLS estimates\nof the treatment dummy in equation 8. All p-values of the LR-tests are depicted\nbeneath the respective numbers of observations. Columns (1) and (2) of table 6\nreport the MNE premia in the first year after switching; columns (3) and (4) as well\na-vis the OLS regressions Heckman's procedure\ncomes along with a reduction in the number of observations, which is due to the unbalanced panel\nstructure of the data at hand. To arrive at comparable results, sample sizes of the OLS estimates were\nartificially reduced to match the observations of the Heckman (1978) estimator.\n30Post-investment growth rates of TFP O.P. firm-age, employment, average wages, and capital\nintensities are estimated using specification (2) of table 5 as probit equation. The growth of TFP\nO.P. refers to specification (1), TFP L.P. to column (4), and labour productivity to specification (3).\n31As opposed to the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), the ATE also makes statements\non units that would never be suitable for treatment. This problem can be reduced if firms were\nexcluded from the population that would never be eligible. Through the exclusion of existing MNEs,\nswitchers before and after the date of the regime change, and observations smaller and younger than\na certain threshold I've tried to adjust the estimation sample accordingly. Nevertheless, results are\nstill not comparable to the ATT. For a more elaborate discussion of this problem, see Wooldridge\nas (5) and (6) depict results for the subsequent two years. In columns (1), (3), and\n(5) OLS estimates are presented, columns (2), (4), and (6) include results using the\nHeckman (1978) estimator. As usual, I have dropped existing MNEs and switchers\nbefore and after the date of switching.\nReported p-values of the LR tests show that self-selection matters. Results for\nTFP growth in the first year after going multinational, labour productivity in the\nfirst and second period after becoming a MNE, and capital intensities for the whole\nsample period are significantly influenced by selectivity issues. Moreover, corre-\nsponding parameter estimates without endogeneity controls exhibit no significance\nCompared to national firms, average TFP growth in the first year after the regime\nchange is significantly higher at newly founded MNEs. A randomly drawn firm's\nproductivity benefits from the decision to become a multinational with a premium\nbetween 5%-7%. However, the effect lasts only for one year, i.e in later sample\nperiods no positive impact on productivity growth is found. This leads to the con-\nclusion that the internalization of the foreign plants' knowledge capital comes along\nwith an immediate increase in productivity at the domestic firm. Yet, these learning\neffects seem to be restricted to the first year after switching.\nAverage wages and capital labour ratios exhibit significant growth premia for\nall years under consideration. Apart from the results for period three, parameter\nestimates for average wages are not driven by self selection. Capital intensities, on\nthe other hand, are clearly influenced by selectivity issues during the whole sample\nperiod. Average growth rates with respect to wages (capital intensities) are between\n3-4 percentage points (1-2 percentage points) higher at newly founded MNEs than\nat national firms. These developments might also be the decisive points behind the\nrelative expansion path of labour productivity (2-9 percentage points). With a faster\ngrowing ratio of capital to labour and increasing average wages, it seems straight-\nforward to expect superior productivity growth rates at a just-founded multinational\nrelative to a purely domestic one. Here, it also fits well in that ex-post employment\ngrowth, though superior before switching, exhibits no significantly higher rates at\nnew multinationals. In other words, I found evidence that firms prepare for a forth-\ncoming expansion to foreign markets by hiring additional employees. These work-\ners then seem to meet the companies' requirements for the next three years, since\nemployment growth during the period after switching is no higher than at national\nfirms.\nSumming up, the above analysis presents evidence that becoming an MNE\nincreases post-investment performance with respect to productivity and average\nOLSb Heckit OLS Heckit OLS Heckit\na Growth rates are measured as yearly averages assessed over the three after switching (T + 1-T + 3).\nb Coefficients in columns (1), (3), and (5) are estimated using ordinary least square (OLS), parameters in columns (2), (4),\nand (6) refer to the Heckman (1978) endogenous treatment (Heckit) estimator.\nc Each cell includes the coefficient of the Switchi,T dummy in a regression that is either based on equation 8 (OLS) or\nequations 9 and 10 (Heckit).

Capital intensities evolve towards the use of capital, and switching does\nnot affect firm size.\n8 Conclusions\nThis paper investigates the extent to which performance attributes of multinational\nenterprises exceed those of purely national firms, both prior and after they have\nswitched from national to multinational activities. For that purpose a range of firm\ncharacteristics is evaluated. At the time of switching, newly founded MNEs exhibit\nperformance premia of 10% (average wages) to 100% (firm size) compared to their\nnationals counterparts. Further regressions show, that multinationals already out-\nperform national firms in the run up to invest abroad. Throughout this time period,\nthe performance gap ranges from 91%-100% with respect to firm size and exhibits\nvalues between 22%-53% for the different productivity measures. Moreover, fu-\nture multinationals pay on average 11%-13% higher wages, and capital intensities\nexceed those of national firms by 16%-25%. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n(KS) test on the equality of performance distributions confirms the above results.\nThe tests clearly show that distribution functions of all firm characteristics for na-\ntionals lie to the left of those for switchers. With regard to ex-ante growth rates\nit turns out that only firm size exhibits higher rates. Average differences between\nfuture MNEs and nationals are between 3-5 percentage points.\nThe use of an endogenous treatment model shows that after the decision to in-\nvest abroad, selectivity issues are of importance. I find evidence that TFP in the\nfirst year after going multinational, labour productivity in the first and second pe-\nriod after becoming a MNE, and capital intensities for the whole sample period are\nsignificantly influenced by the endogeneity of the switching decision. The dimen-\nsion of ex-post growth rate differences between newly founded MNEs and domestic\nfirms is 3-4 percentage points with respect to wages and 5-9 percentage points for\nthe different productivity measures. The growth rate premia for capital labour ratios\nis between 1-2 percentage points per year.\nThese results are in line with the opinion that international expansions of domes-\ntic firms are an important channel to raise overall competitiveness. The decision to\nbecome a multinational enterprise strengthens domestic operations. However, one\nhas to take into account that the presented results refer to short run developments.\nThe evaluation of performance measures at existing multinationals over a longer\ntime horizon is beyond the scope of this paper and may yield different results.\nAppendix\nA Sample attrition of the Buba USTAN data set\nemployment capital stocka\nmean std.dev. obs. mean std.dev. obs. overall obs.\na The capital stock is measured in thousands.\nbThe table depicts summary statistics for the overall USTAN data set without any further adaptations.\nB Aggregated sector definitions\n1 Agriculture and mining\n2 Food and textiles\n3 Machinery and equipment\n4 Wood, chemicals and others\n5 Commerce\n6 Finance and business\n7 Other services\nC Construction of total factor productivity\nAs for the estimation of total factor productivity, I classified the USTAN data set into seven\ndifferent branches (see appendix B). For each firm within an aggregated industry the fol-\nlowing Cobb-Douglas production function is considered:\nyi,t\n+ i,t\nLower case letters indicate logarithmic values of the according variables. Yi,t is the valued\nadded of firm i at time t, Li,t and Ki,t are its labour and capital inputs, Ai,t is the firm age,\nri is a regional dummy that distinguishes East- and West-German observations, tt is a linear\ntime trend, i,t is the part of productivity that influences the firm's input decision (unobserv-\nable for the researcher), and i,t includes both a measurement error as well as unpredictable\nshocks to productivity.32 Table 9 exemplifies estimation results of the above equation for\nthe sector Wood, Chemicals and Others during the period 1992 to 2001 using ordinary least\nsquares (OLS), firm-specific fixed effects (Within), Olley's and Pakes's (O.P.), and Levin-\nsohn's and Petrin's (L.P.) methods to control for endogeneity. A common feature of all\nestimation approaches is the assumption of constant, sector-specific production parameters\nover time, i.e. each firm active in the same industry produces with the same technology but\nwith possibly different amounts of factor inputs. In columns (1), (2) and (4) the simple OLS\napproach, which does not allow to treat i,t and i,t independently, is used. Columns (2) and\n(4) augment the first specification with the firms' age and investment as additional control\nvariables. The within estimator of column (3) considers i,t to vary over individual firms\nbut to be constant over time. The results in columns (5)-(8) are based on semi-parametric\nestimation methods similar to the one proposed by Olley and Pakes (1996). Finally, column\n(9) is estimated using the Stata ado-file levpet (compare Levinsohn et al. (2003)).33\nWhen applying the O.P. approach, the following assumptions are made: a) the inverted\ninvestment function can be written as i,t\n= f(ii,t, ki,t\n) (ii,t is the log of investment); b)\nlabour is the only variable factor, i.e. its demand is influenced by contemporaneous values\nof i,t; c) ki,t and ai,t are fixed variables influenced only by past values of the unobserved\nproductivity shocks (i,t-1). Therefore, equation 11 changes to:\nyi,t\n+ t\n(ii,t, ki,t\nwhere t\n+ f(ii,t, ki,t\n) and is approximated by a 3rd order polynomial in log\ninvestment and log capital. Equation 12 yields consistent estimates of 0, 1, 1, 2, and\n3, while the coefficient of logarithmic capital 2 is not identified. On this account, a second\nstep is necessary to get consistent values of 2. The second estimation equation is:\n+3tt is a shock to productivity common to all firms in the same sector, region\nand year.\n33Since the ado-file is very restrictive and does not allow to include other variables than capital\nand labour it mainly serves as an additional control specification.\nwhere i,t+1 = i,t+1 -E(i,t+1|i,t\n) and h(.) is approximated by a third order polynomial\nin ki,t and t. Estimation results of the O.P. approach are presented in columns (5) to (8).34\nNone of the results in table 9, columns (1), (2), and (4), account for the fact that ignor-\ning i,t causes an omitted variable bias. If the correlation between unobserved, firm-specific\nproductivity shocks and the firm's factor demand is positive, one expects positively biased\nOLS estimates. Turning to the O.P. and L.P. estimates should reduce much of the simultane-\nity problems. In fact, a comparison of columns (5) to (9) with columns (1), (2), (4) reveals\na decrease of the labour coefficient between eight percent in case of O.P. and, with sig-\nnificantly more observations at hand, nineteen percent in case of Levinsohn's and Petrin's\nmethod. The within estimator, though it suffers from the problem to model i,t as con-\nstant over time, also provides evidence for a positive bias in the OLS estimates. However,\nthe relatively low capital coefficients are a little worrying, since they could be caused by a\npotential selectivity problem that cannot be addressed with the data at hand.\nTo focus on three productivity measures only, the results of columns (5), (7) and (9) are\nused to calculate total factor productivity. For these specifications my TFP measures are\nconstructed as\nTFPi,t\n= exp(yi,t\n[- Ci,t\nwhere Ci,t are additional variables like firm age and other controls depending on the ac-\ncording specification. In order to gain observations, I constructed out of sample predictions\nfor firms where the investment or intermediate input proxy was not available.\n34Table 9 also includes a version where i,t is assumed to follow a random walk process (see\ncolumns (5) and (7)).
