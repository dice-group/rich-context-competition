When language learners attempt to express\nthemselves in L2 context, they encounter some barriers with\nregard to pragmatic content of their utterances. This, some-\ntimes, happens despite the learners' ability to use the lan-\nguage properly at syntactic and semantic levels. In fact, even\nthough they are highly proficient as far as grammar and lexis\nare concerned, L2 learners fail to express and interpret com-\nmunicative functions in a particular context (Brock &\nthe study of language from the point of view of the users,\nespecially of the choices they make, the constraints they\nencounter in using language in social interaction, and the effects\ntheir use of language has on other participants in the act of\nGiven that, Glaser (2009) declares that high level of prag-\nmatic competence in the target language has a constructive\neffect for successful communication within the L2 contexts.\nOwing to this, L2 learners need to be exposed to pragmatic\ncontent in their context of L2 learning.\nELT textbooks are among the various means used to pro-\nvide L2 learners with pragmatic content represented in the\nspeech acts such as request, refusal, and apology. According\nto Vellenga (2004), textbooks are among the most important\ninstructional materials that have to be considered as the vital\nbackbone for second/foreign language learning. As\nDiepenbroek and Derwing (2013) suggest, considering the\nsignificance of pragmatic knowledge in successful commu-\nnication, material developers must give special attention to\nthe important role of English Language Teaching (ELT) text-\nbooks in promoting learners' pragmatic competence in L2\nclassroom settings. Textbooks not only provide English as\nSecond/Foreign Language (ESL/EFL) learners with gram-\nmatical and lexical aspects of the L2, but they also present\npragmatic content that is necessary for the successful L2\nlearning.\nGiven the significant role pragmatic content plays in L2\nmaterial development for language learning, the purpose of\nthis study is to explore how pragmatic content, represented\nas three speech acts of requesting, refusing, and apologizing,\nis distributed in global and local ELT textbooks. Whereas\nglobal ELT textbooks are prepared according to global norms\nand are instructed around the world, local ELT textbooks are\n1Shiraz University, Iran\n2University of Tehran, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nHussein Meihami, Department of Foreign Languages and Linguistics,\nCollege of Humanities and Social Sciences, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran.\nEmail: s.hmeihami@rose.shirazu.ac.ir\nPragmatic Content in Global and Local\nELT Textbooks: A Micro Analysis Study\nHussein Meihami1 and Mobin Khanlarzadeh2\n Keywords\nglobal ELT textbooks, local ELT textbooks, pragmatic content, speech acts\n2 SAGE Open\nprepared according to the norms of a particular EFL context.\nThis research, then, is an attempt to measure the pragmatic\ncontent of both types of textbooks and finds out the differ-\nences, if any. Another concern of this study is to investigate\nthe strengths and weaknesses of these textbooks in present-\ning pragmatic content.\nLiterature Review\nWhether or not to include pragmatic content in ELT text-\nbooks has been a matter of controversy. On one hand,\nBardovi-Harlig (2001) states that textbooks cannot be con-\nsidered as reliable sources of providing learners with prag-\nmatic input and the inclusion of pragmatic content in ELT\ntextbooks should be done with care as it requires analysis of\nauthentic language. On the other hand, many researchers are\nof the opinion that pragmatic competence of L2 learners can\nbe improved through instructional materials such as text-\nBouton (1994), for example, asserts that many pragmatic\naspects of L2 such as conversational implicature can be\nlearnt through instructional textbooks, and without them, the\nprocess of learning will be slow or even impossible. Koike\nand Pearson (2005) attribute another advantage in using\ninstructional textbooks in pragmatic instruction. They\nbelieve that by using textbooks for instructing pragmatic\ncontent, language learners will have a higher chance of\nreceiving feedback on linguistic features at pragmatic level.\nAccording to Koike and Pearson (2005), pragmatic acquisi-\ntion is facilitated to the extent L2 learners have the chance to\nreceive feedback on pragmatic issues. Given the importance\nof pragmatic competence in the process of L2 learning and\nconsidering the significant role that textbooks can play in\nimproving learners' pragmatic competence, it is of a great\nimportance to review the literature for the studies which\nfocused on the comparison among different ELT textbooks.\nIn an analysis of pragmatic content of ELT textbooks,\nVellenga (2004) indicated that generally \"a phrase or two\" is\nconcerned with pragmatic content in each page of common\nELT textbooks. She also showed that \"the distribution of\nspeech act types across ESL and EFL textbooks did not\nappear to be patterned, nor based on frequency of speech act\noccurrence in natural language, and often seems counterin-\ntuitive\" (p. 9).\nAccording to House (1996), while grammatical and lexi-\ncal items were usually contextualized in the texts, pragmatic\ncontent was always included in the textbooks in a de-contex-\ntualized format. Diepenbroek and Derwing (2013) demon-\nstrated that textbooks tended to present pragmatic content in\nisolation and this usually caused problems in the process of L2\nlearning for several reasons. First, the significance of pragmatic\ncompetence in successful communication requires language\nlearners to select among different linguistic choices with regard\nto the already taught pragmatic content. Consequently, de-con-\ntextualization usually leads to their difficulty in deciding the\nappropriate form\u00adfunction relationship in authentic commu-\nnication. Nguyen's (2011) investigation could be a good\nexample for this matter. In her research on evaluating the\npragmatic content of the recently developed series of text-\nbooks for Vietnamese upper-secondary schools, she found\nthat there was not a sound relationship between the speech\nacts and their linguistic counterparts in these local textbooks.\nThe second reason is that de-contextualizing pragmatic con-\ntent may lead to learners' inability to select an appropriate\nspeech act in a specific situation due to nuance differences\namong different pragmatic structures (Cohen, 2005). Besides,\ntextbooks sometimes misrepresent or oversimplify the\nappropriate pragmatic content in a particular situation\nAccording to Sheldon (1988), \"textbook is the visible\nheart of any ELT program\" (p. 237). As textbooks are vital\nsources of L2 learning out of the classroom, their roles in\nhelping learners raise their pragmatic awareness becomes\nmore significant in EFL contexts. As a result, many investi-\ngations have focused on ELT textbooks in EFL contexts.\nIn a research study, Nguyen (2011) surveyed pragmatic\ntopics such as advising and apologizing in EFL textbook\nseries. These topics were not included homogenously across\ndifferent levels of the textbooks. The findings of her study\nalso revealed that although the speech act of \"opening a con-\nversation\" was included in all three levels of examined text-\nbooks, the speech act of \"closing a conversation\" was not\ngiven the attention it deserved. According to Nguyen, maybe\nmaterial developers consider conversation openers more\ncomplex than conversation closers for L2 learners of English.\nIn another study, Ekin (2013) examined how the speech\nact of suggestion was distributed in eight EFL course books.\nThe results of this investigation indicated that up to 70.8% of\nstrategies included in course books were about conventional-\nized forms. The findings further showed that suggestion\nstrategies included at the pre-intermediate level were more\nthan the ones included at the intermediate level.\nJiang (2006) conducted a study on the linguistic forms\nused to perform the speech act of suggestion in both real-life\nand ESL textbooks. She analyzed three recent and three old\nELT textbooks so as to compare the distribution of the speech\nact of suggestion in the real-life language use and that of ELT\ntextbooks. The results of her investigation showed that even\nthough the new generation of textbooks included more struc-\ntures regarding the speech act of suggestion, there was no\ndifference between the recent textbooks and the old ones in\nterms of real-life use of this speech act. She concludes that it\nis a necessity for ELT textbooks to include background infor-\nmation about the structures of pragmatic content in real-life\ncontext.\nIn a 4-month study done in Korea, Kim and Hall (2002)\ninvestigated Korean children's participation in an intensive\nreading program and its effects on their pragmatic compe-\ntence. To gather the data, the researchers examined the num-\nber of words, utterances, and talk management features\nMeihami and Khanlarzadeh 3\nchildren used during some role-play sessions. The results of\ntheir investigation showed that reading books in general and\nintensive reading in particular could help learners develop\nmany aspects of L2 pragmatic competence. In conclusion,\nthey emphasized the significant role which ELT textbooks\nplay in providing EFL learners with the chance to acquaint\nthemselves with pragmatic content in the second language.\nDue to the rising emphasis on the importance of L2 prag-\nmatic content in successful communication and as ELT text-\nbooks are one of the influential means to provide learners\nwith linguistic features at pragmatic level, especially in EFL\ncontexts, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the\ndistribution of pragmatic content occurrence represented as\nthree speech acts of requesting, refusing, and apologizing in\nglobal and local ELT textbooks. This study also aims to exam-\nine the strengths and weaknesses of elementary ELT text-\nbooks in terms of their pragmatic content representation.\nResearch Questions\nThis study attempts to answer the following questions:\nResearch Question 1: How frequent are the speech acts\nof requesting, refusing, and apologizing in global and\nlocal elementary ELT textbooks?\nResearch Question 2: How frequent are the strategies\nthat can be used to perform the speech acts of requesting,\nrefusing, and apologizing in global elementary ELT\ntextbooks?\nResearch Question 3: How frequent are the strategies\nthat can be used to perform the speech acts of requesting,\nrefusing, and apologizing in a local elementary ELT\ntextbook?\nMethod\nCorpus\nThe elementary level of three global ELT textbooks, includ-\ning Interchange by Richards (2005), Top Notch by Saslow\nand Ascher (2006), and American English File by Oxenden,\nLatham-Koeing, and Seligson (2008) along with the local\nelementary textbooks of ILI Series (Panel of writers, 2010),\ncomprised the corpus of the present study. The elementary\nlevel of these series, each, was composed of two or three\ntextbooks. It should be stated that the reliability of ILI ele-\nmentary level has already been confirmed by a panel of\nexperts in material design field. ILI textbooks are called local\nsince a local panel of ELT experts design them on the base of\nlocal needs and norms. Moreover, for the sake of consistency\nand ease of analysis, the books comprising the elementary\nlevel of a particular textbook were regarded as one elemen-\ntary book. For instance, American English File Starter and\nAmerican English File One were combined together and\nwere considered one elementary book, namely, American\nEnglish File Elementary. Therefore, Interchange Intro and\nInterchange 1, Top Notch 2A and 2B, and three ILI Series\nElementary textbooks were respectively regarded as\nInterchange Elementary, Top Notch Elementary, and ILI\nSeries Elementary.\nData Analysis Framework\nTo analyze the distribution of three speech acts of requesting,\nrefusing, and apologizing, three frameworks were used. As\nfar as the frequency of the speech act of refusal was con-\ncerned, Beebe, Takahashi, and Uliss-Weltz's (1990) frame-\nwork was used. In their framework, Beebe et al. (1990)\ndivided the speech act of refusal into two categories: direct\nand indirect. They also divided each category into some\nstrategies. While a response to an utterance such as \"I don't\nthink so!\" is categorized as direct/non-performative refusal,\nresponding to the same utterance by \"I feel terrible . . .\" is\ncategorized as indirect/statement of regret. While there are\ntwo subcategories for expressions of direct refusal, expres-\nsions of indirect refusal consist of 11 subcategories (see\nAppendix A).\nTo obtain the frequency of the request speech act in the\nELT textbooks, Blum-Kulka, House, and Kasper's (1989)\nframework was adopted. Blum-Kulka et al. (1989) catego-\nrized the request speech act into three strategies, including\ndirect strategies such as \"Clean up the kitchen,\" convention-\nally indirect strategies such as \"Could you clean up the\nkitchen, please?\" and non-conventionally indirect strategies\nsuch as \"You have left the kitchen in a right mess\" (see\nAppendix B).\nTo analyze the speech act of apologizing, a framework\ndevised by Olshtain and Cohen (1983) was used. In this\nframework, the speech act of apologizing was divided into\nfive categories of expression of apology, \"I am sorry\"; expla-\nnation or account of the situation, \"the bus was late\"; an\n"
