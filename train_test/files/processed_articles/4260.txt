Homely genres, according to Miller\n(1984, p. 5), are \"the `de facto' genres, the types we have\nnames for in everyday language.\" Examples of these particu-\nlar genres are wedding announcements, birthday announce-\nments, obituaries, and the like (Al-Ali, 2006). Wedding\ninvitation genre, as a homely genre, can be applied as a\nmeans of enhancing language and cultural awareness. \"This\nwould add depth to what is known and may broaden the field\nInvitation is \"a commemorative social action having the\nfunction of informing and requesting the presence or partici-\npation of a person(s) kindly and courteously to some place,\ngathering, entertainment, etc., or to do something\" (Al-Ali,\nken forms. \"Printed forms of invitation, in particular, share\ncertain generic features that set them apart from other text\nAmong invitations of different kinds, wedding invitation\ngenre is a ubiquitous genre that people around the world are\nwell acquainted with.

To fulfill this\npurpose, two groups of analysis were carried out, one by the\nauthors and one by nine sophomore undergraduate students\ntaking the English Genre Analysis course as part of their BA\nstudies at University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD). The two\ngroups were assigned to analyze at least three Bruneian wed-\nding invitations in terms of identifying elements such as\nmoves, obligatory and optional moves, move order and fur-\nther to explain in terms of the communicative purpose of the\ngenre why certain key linguistic features appear in the genre.\nThe results of the study indicated that the students managed\nto accurately identify the related moves and move order;\nhowever, they were less successful at explaining the linguis-\ntic features in terms of the overall communicative purposes\nof the genre.\nThere seems to have been no systematic investigation of\nthe wedding invitation genre in Persian, and this study is the\nfirst of its type. It is, therefore, of particular significance as it\nis an attempt to perform a genre analysis on Persian wedding\ninvitation announcements to identify their typical generic\ncomponent patterns, and further to understand how members\nof specific discourse communities in Iran construct, apply,\nand interpret this very specific genre to achieve their com-\nmunity goals, and why they write the genre in the way they\nThe Persian Wedding Ritual Pattern\nWedding is a joyous occasion wherein the bride and the\ngroom celebrate their union and formally announce the\nbeginning of their new life together. Among the myriads of\nwedding rituals around the world, the Persian marriage cer-\nemony is an ancient and a beautiful tradition celebrated with\nglory and distinction among a large gathering of relatives\nand friends. The history of Persian weddings goes back to\nthe Zoroastrian era (Cawasji Katrak, 1965), and it consists\nof a rich amalgam of traditions. To gain a better insight into\nthe nature of Persian wedding ceremonies, \"an understand-\ning of the broader socio-cultural context related to the social\nnorms and values of the conventionalized occasion\" is nec-\nence of religion on most aspects of life is evident. The state\nreligion in the country is Islam, with Muslims making up the\nmajority of the population. The marriage practices are gov-\nerned by Islamic prescriptions. Even in ancient Iran, the\nideal of marriage used to be highly religious (Cawasji\nKatrak, 1965). Moreover, Persian weddings have been par-\ntially influenced by patriarchy. Although in modern times\ncouples choose their spouse-to-be by themselves, family\nconsent in marriage is still valued in Iran. That is to say,\n\"usually the groom-to-be will ask the father of the bride-to-\nbe for her hand in marriage. This is a tradition that many\ncultures keep in showing respect for the elderly\" (Rezaei,\nModern Persian weddings encompass subtle traditional\nelements, yet there are variations in some rural areas or\nsmaller cities where some ethnic groups try to retain tradi-\ntions and rituals that might deviate from the modern wedding\n(Rezaei, 2009). The typical Persian wedding consists of two\nphases: the aghd (the ceremony) and the aroosi (the\nreception).\nThe aghd is a legal ceremony conducted by an officiator\nin which the couple sign a contract and formalize their rela-\ntionship as husband and wife. Dressed in a white gown, the\nbride sits next to the bridegroom wearing a suit. Before them,\nthere is a sofreh-ye aghd, that is, a spread or a tablecloth to\nwish the couple well in their union. \"Food and objects tradi-\ntionally associated with marriage are arranged on the sofreh\"\n(Batmanglij, 2004, para. 5), all of which are used symboli-\ncally. As the officiator is performing the marriage ceremony,\ntwo women who are happily married hold a square of silk or\ntulle over the marrying couple's heads, and other women, in\nturn, rub two sugar cones together to symbolize the raining\nof sweet joy and happiness down on the bride and the groom\n(Batmanglij, 2004). Having gotten the positive response\nfrom the bride, the officiator declares the couple husband and\nwife. At this moment, the newly-weds exchange rings and\nthey are showered with small golden coins, sweets, or noghl\n(sugar-coated almonds) as a means of insuring the new cou-\nple good luck.\nA follow-up to the aghd is the aroosi, which is celebrated\nimmediately after the aghd or some time later. \"The aroosi is a\nlavish meal, sometimes with a whole roast lamb as the center-\npiece\" (Batmanglij, 2004, para. 16). In addition to feasting, the\nreception usually includes a lot of dancing. The music band or\nthe DJ can provide a festive mood and a lively atmosphere for\nthis very special occasion. On the whole, the Persian wedding\nis an elaborate affair, especially among the affluent, requiring\na lot of preparation. However, there are companies that are\ndesigned to assist the couples in getting their marriage arrange-\nments, from catering to decorations, done.\nTheoretical Overview\nThe present study draws on Swales' (1990) genre analysis.\n\"Researchers from diverse fields, like rhetoric, writing, lit-\nerature, linguistics, anthropology, etc., have been trying to\nclarify the notion of genre. Each group has defined and char-\nacterized genre differently\" (Shokouhi & Kamyab, 2004,\nThe traditional approaches to the study of genre used to\nconsider genre as a classificatory category consisting of sta-\nble members with similar textual features. However, in the\nnew approaches to genre analysis, there have been attempts\nto reinterpret the notion of genre (Shokouhi & Kamyab,\nOne of the most influential definitions of genre in the new\nhas proposed the following definition for genre:\nSharif and Yarmohammadi 3\nA genre is a class of communicative events, the members of\nwhich share some set of communicative purposes. These\npurposes are recognized by the expert members of the parent\ndiscourse community, and thereby constitute the rationale for\nthe genre. This rationale shapes the schematic structure of the\ndiscourse and influences and constrains choice of content and\nstyle. Communicative purpose is both a privileged criterion and\none that operates to keep the scope of genre as here conceived\nnarrowly focused on comparable rhetorical action. In addition to\npurpose, exemplars of a genre exhibit various patterns of\nsimilarity in terms of structure, style, content and intended\naudience. If all high probability expectations are realized, the\nexemplar will be viewed as prototypical by the parent\ncommunity. The genre names inherited and produced by\ndiscourse communities and imported by others constitute\nvaluable ethnographic communication, but typically need\nfurther validation (p. 58).\nAccordingly, Swales (1990) conceives of genre analysis\nas \"a means of studying spoken and written discourse for\napplied ends\" (p. 1). In the study of written discourse, genre\nanalysis is conducted with the purpose of finding out how\nwriters conventionally sequence material to obtain particular\ngoals (Richards & Schmidt, 2002). \"The genre as a whole is\nmade up of a sequence of component moves, obligatory and\noptional moves, each of which carries out a minor function in\n\"Not all the moves are essential in a genre, and conventions\nacross disciplines and cultures may differ as to which ones\nare vital for achieving which purpose\" (Kachru & Smith,\nappear in the same order.\nData and Procedures\nFor the sake of data analysis, a corpus of 70 Persian wedding\ninvitation cards was collected. The Persian data, published\nfrom 1995 to date in Iran, was accumulated from within the\ncircle of the researchers' relatives and friends. To ensure that\nregional and cultural variations were taken into consider-\nation, the data were collected from among two different\nsocial strata: the upper social stratum and the middle-class\ngroup. The reason for not including the lower-class stratum\nin the data collection procedure was the scarcity of published\nwedding cards among lower-class families as they often can-\nnot incur the great expenses of holding wedding celebrations\nor even sending invitation cards, and in case there is a wed-\nding celebration, the guests are often invited over the tele-\nphone or by word of mouth for frugality considerations.\nThe Persian corpus was then analyzed following the frame-\nwork proposed by Swales (1990), which considers any given\ngenre as consisting of a series of component moves which,\ntogether, express the communicative purpose of the genre.\nThis study, therefore, was directed toward analyzing the\nwedding invitations in terms of their component moves to\ndetermine how Persian inviters accomplish the communica-\ntive purpose of this particular genre as a socio-cultural event.\nThe Persian invitations were further analyzed for their oblig-\natory and optional moves, and their move order. The analysis\nrevealed seven component moves within the generic struc-\nture of the Persian wedding invitations that will be discussed\nin detail in the following section.\nResults and Discussion\nIn this section, the genre analysis of the corpus at hand is\npresented, along with explanations of the lexico-grammati-\ncal features of the move structure of the genre. Yet, prior to\nour discussion of the generic structure of the Persian wed-\nding invitation texts, a brief overview of the nonlinguistic\nfeatures of the wedding cards including the graphic images,\ndecorative borders, visual organization of the text, to name\njust a few, seems essential for a comprehensive better under-\nstanding of the genre under investigation.\nNon-Linguistic Features of Persian Wedding Invitations\nWedding invitations are the first glimpse guests might\nhave of the magnificence of the celebration. Ranging from\npreprinted to custom-designed cards, Persian wedding\ninvitation texts are printed on light cardboards of unique\ncolors such as white, cream, golden, silver, beige, pink,\nand the like. The front page decorated with ribbon, pressed\nflowers, embossed images of wedding rings, hearts, roses,\nbouquets of mixed flowers, or a studio portrait of the bride\nand the groom almost always features either the first names\nof the bride and the groom in English or the formulaic\nphrase \"Message of Happiness\" (see Figure 1). Persian\nwedding cards are flavored with the beautiful art of cal-\nligraphy. The names of the bride and the groom, sometimes\nintertwined, are typed in a separate line using a larger font\nsize. Another nonlinguistic element that attracts attention\nin Persian wedding cards is the presence of decorative bor-\nders, including floral and traditional borders. The color of\nthe ink and the envelope are carefully selected to go with\nthe invitation design.\nGeneric Structure of Persian Wedding Invitations\nComponent move structure analysis of our sample of Persian\nwedding invitation texts revealed seven generic moves that\nare as follows:\nOpening. All the wedding invitation cards under scrutiny fea-\ntured this obligatory element that appears in central position\non the top of the invitations. In general, Persian wedding\ninvitations open with \"In the Name of God\" phrases as Bis-\nmillah Al-rahman Al-rahim is \"the formula recommended by\nthe prophet for use when beginning any event\" (Rippin,\n4 SAGE Open\nexamples of this component move, along with their English\ntranslation, appear below:\n1. be nam-e peyv\u00e6nd d\u00e6h\u00e6nde-ye q\u00e6lbha\nIn the Name of the One Who Joins Hearts Together\n2. be nam-e xaleq-e eshq\nIn the Name of the Creator of Love\n3. be nam-e xaleq-e h\u00e6sti\nIn the Name of the Creator of the Universe\nHowever, in 22.8% of the data under investigation, \"In the\nName of God\" phrases were replaced by \"Under theAuspices\nof God\" phrases (d\u00e6r p\u00e6rtov-e enayat-e p\u00e6rv\u00e6rdegar). This,\nin turn, is associated with Muslims' belief to commence any\nevent with a special mention of God.\nIdentifying the bride and the groom by first name. This generic\nmove that almost always (94.2% within our corpus) appears\nimmediately after the opening identifies the bride and the\ngroom by their first names. In 54.2% of the analyzed data,\nthe first name of the bride was mentioned on the right side\nbefore the forename of the groom on the left side (see\nFigure 2), whereas in 30% of the data the name of the\ngroom preceded that of the bride (see Figure 3). The first\nname of the bride on the right side was specially observed\namong the wedding announcements collected from upper\nclass people, while the first name of the groom on the right\nside was more rampant among the wedding cards from\nmiddle-class families. The appearance of the bride's name\nprior to that of the groom might express the very fact that\nthe position of the Iranian wife is one of the equality with\nher husband and \"the wife ranks . . . more as the equal of the\nhusband than his dependant\" (Cawasji Katrak, 1965, p. 5).\nOn the other hand, precedence of the groom's name over\nthe bride's name probably has its roots in the Islamic belief\nthat \"a man is thought to be the guardian of a woman and\nremains the instrument of social control after she marries\"\ntor of patriarchy in some families as well.\nUnlike the groom who is most often identified by his first\nname, the bride's forename is not always mentioned in the\nwedding invitation. Instead, the brides are identified by the\ntitle \"dooshizeh\" 2 (Miss) plus last name. This was observed\nin 7.1% of the data and especially among religious middle-\nclass families.\nThis tendency (i.e. the deletion of the feminine proper names)\nmost likely indicates an inherent preference on the part of the\ngroom and the bride's families to avoid mentioning the names of\nthe females in the invitations, either for religious or personal\npreferences. This practice is often witnessed among the nomadic\nand rural wedding ceremonies and in conservative urban circles\nAccordingly, \"calling a woman by her proper name is not\nopen to any male but is restricted to a socially identified cir-\nFinally, 7.7% of the data were solely on the last name\nbasis, not using first names at all. This practice was observed\nparticularly among families of middle stratum most likely\ndue to the reason mentioned above.\nAnnouncing the couple's marriage.This obligatory move\nwhich, except for 4.2% of the data, appeared in third position\nannounces that the bride and the groom will soon be united\nas man and wife exchanging marriage vows. Below are two\nexamples of this move:\n1. ba t\u00e6r\u00e6nnom-e h\u00e6sti h\u00e6mrah mish\u00e6vim v\u00e6 peyman\nmib\u00e6ndim ke h\u00e6misheh asheq bemanim.\nWe join the melody of life and pledge to stay in love\nwith each other for ever.\n2. d\u00e6r aseman-e zendegi-e xod jostejug\u00e6r-e setareh-i\nbudim be der\u00e6xshandegi-e xorshid v\u00e6 yaftim ancheh\nra mixastim.\nIn the sky of our life, we were seeking after a star as bright\nas the sun, and we found what we wished for.\nRequesting the participation of the recipients. This element is,\nin fact, an integral part of the wedding invitation genre that\nenables the inviters, usually the bride and the groom, or\nsometimes their parents to cordially and courteously request\nthe honor of the guests' participation in their celebration.\nThis move was identified in 84.3% of our corpus of analy-\nsis, and in the rest of the data (15.7%) there was no explicit\nFigure 1. A sample of the front page and decorative borders of\nPersian wedding invitation cards.\nSharif and Yarmohammadi 5\nrequest of participation as the function of this part is self-\nexplanatory, and sending wedding cards make the communi-\ncative purpose of the genre self-evident.\nIt is also noteworthy that, within the corpus, 87.1% of the\nwedding invitations were issued by the bride and the groom,\n7.1% by their families, and finally 5.5% by their fathers. As\nCawasji Katrak (1965, p. 11) puts it, this is probably due to\nthe fact that since ancient times in Iran \"the girl or the youth\n[has] had the freedom to choose with the consent and\napproval of parents her or his companion in life.\" Therefore,\nissuing the invitation on the part of the marrying couple is a\ngood indicator of this liberty. On the other hand, some cou-\nples prefer their wedding invitations to be issued in the name\nof their fathers or their parents for two reasons: first, \"accord-\ning to Prophet Mohammad, there is no marriage without a\nn.d., p. 347); second, it is often the case that the funding for\nthe wedding is provided by the couple's families.\nIdentifying the bride and the groom by last name. This obliga-\ntory move identifies the bride and the groom formally by\nmentioning their last names. In 82.9% of the data, this move\nwas placed in the fifth position, while in 17.1% of the invita-\ntions it occupied a second position.\nIt is often the case that the couple's first names and last\nnames are arranged in a crosswise manner resembling the\nletter X, that is to say the bride's last name is written beneath\nthe groom's first name with the groom's surname placed\nbelow the bride's first name. This might imply the fact that\nthe wedding is \"to some extent an alliance not only of two\nFigure 2. A sample Persian wedding invitation card typical of the upper social stratum.\n1. Opening\n2.

As in modern time the groom's\nfather or the bride's father or both sides communally finance\nthe marriage arrangements, the fathers are identified as the\ninviters in the wedding cards.\nAnother point that was noteworthy was that 7.1% of the\ncards used the titles Mr. and Miss prior to the couple's last\nnames. This was exclusively observed among middle-class\nfamilies.\nSituating the wedding ceremony.This component move con-\ntains explicit information regarding the day, the date, the\ntime and duration, the place of the wedding celebration, in\naddition to the reception. These variants are all obligatory,\nand always appear in the sixth position. An example of this\nmove is presented below:\n1. p\u00e6zirayi: p\u00e6njsh\u00e6nbeh // \u00e6z sa\u00e6t-e  ta pas-i \u00e6z sh\u00e6b\nbe s\u00e6rf-e shirini v\u00e6 sham\nneshani: xiaban-e q\u00e6srod\u00e6sht bashgah-e \u00e6fs\u00e6ran\nReception: Thursday, 86.4.21 from 8 p.m. until the wee hours of\nthe night for refreshments and dinner\nAddress: Afsaran Club, Ghasrodasht St.\nEach of these variants is going to be discussed in detail:\nDay variant.Among the days of the week, Thursday and\nFriday, in turn, had the highest frequencies of being selected\nfor the wedding ceremonies within the corpus of our study\ndays, working people in Iran work part-time; as a result,\nThursday evening is a convenient time to party all night long\nand to take it easy the next day, on Friday, on which day\npeople are off from work. As mentioned before, in the ana-\nlyzed data Friday had the second highest percentage due to\nthe very fact that it is a holiday in Iran and \"a traditional day\nto get married, according to Islamic tradition\" (Al-Ali, 2006,\nIt is often the case that if religious holidays or occasions\nin Iran happen to fall on a Saturday through a Wednesday\n(i.e., the other days of the week except for Thursday and\nFriday), marriage celebrations will be extremely frequent\nthen. As a matter of fact, a perfunctory glance at the calendar\nrevealed that this was especially true for our analyzed data.\nThis coincidence with a religious occasion is thought to\nbring the marrying couple good luck, and it is believed that\nthey will be granted blessings if they begin their connubial\nlife together on a sacred day.\nDate variant.In the Persian wedding cards studied,\nbesides the day of the week, there was a further specification\nof the date that is based on the Muslim solar calendar (Hejri)\nincluding the day, the month, and the year from right to left.\nOne point that was of special interest in the analyzed data\nwas that summer, with the frequency of occurrence of 42.8%,\nwas the Iranians' most favorite season for wedding festivals\nas during the summer people have more spare time, and sum-\nmer is the time of rejoicing, trips, parties, and so on.\nTime and duration variant.As for the time and duration\nvariant, it must be pointed out that Persian wedding ritu-\nals are usually held in the evening and take long for 5 or 6\nhours on the average (see Figure 2).

Situating the wedding ceremony\nNote that the groom's first name appears before the bride's name and the\noccasion is a lunch invitation.\nSharif and Yarmohammadi 7\nsometimes appears in wedding invitations, might be an indi-\ncator of a ceremony with lots of music and dancing. This\nis while in rural areas, in northern part of the country, and\nespecially among the nomadic tribes weddings are some-\ntimes celebrated early in the afternoon, and the guests are\ninvited to lunch (see Figure 3). In this study, 81.5% of the\ncards identified the evening as their time variant, and 18.5%\nof the invitations featured the afternoon for situating the time\nof the ceremony.\nReception variant.\nThe reception variant immediately\nfollows the time and duration variants. Generally, wedding\nguests in Iran are either invited for refreshments and dinner\n(see Figure 2), or merely for refreshments. Occasionally, the\nwedding reception is for refreshments and luncheon if the\nwedding is celebrated in mid-day or early afternoon (see\nFigure 3). Within our data, 87% of the invitations had been\nmade for refreshments and dinner, 10% for refreshments\nonly, and 3% for refreshments and lunch.\n\"The wedding refreshments will be the focal point for\nmany that attend the reception\" (Brown, 2008, para. 1).\n\"Wedding receptions are often long and guests will be look-\ning forward to something they can eat or drink while making\nconversation\" (Judkins, n.d., para. 2). \"Many wedding guests\nwill choose to attend the reception that follows the ceremony\nbecause they know there will be entertainment and refresh-\nOften candies and pastries, fruits, and sometimes tea,\njuice, or ice cream are served as refreshments. More extrava-\ngant weddings even serve coffee, nuts, dried fruits, finger\nfoods, or light snacks as refreshments. However, families\nwho are tight on budget usually cannot afford the high expen-\nditures of wedding feasts; therefore, they entertain their\nguests by refreshments only. In Persian weddings, dinner is\nserved buffet style (Rezaei, 2009). \"Jeweled rice, or sweet\nrice is always served, along with many other dishes and an\nNowadays, the wedding refreshments and the feasts are pre-\npared by caterers who provide food and services for social\nevents.\nPlace variant.Except for those invitations that contain\noptional components, other Persian wedding announcements\ndraw to a close with the place variant. In Iran, wedding cele-\nbrations are held in the residence of the groom's parents, gar-\ndens, wedding halls, hotels' reception halls, or large houses.\nAs data analysis revealed, 34.3% of the Persian marriage\nrituals took place in wedding halls, 28.5% in private gardens\nor gardens specially prepared for wedding celebrations, and\n37.2% in the groom's parental domicile or the house of a\nrelative. The address given usually includes the number and\nthe name of the street but not the name of the city or town.\nOther optional components.The data analysis revealed that\nalmost 67.5% of the cards contained optional elements\nincluding one or more of the following components.\nOne optional element that constituted 6% of our corpus\nwas an overt appeal to the invitees requesting them not to\nbring video cameras of any kind to the wedding party for\nreligious considerations. Devout Muslim women would not\nlike others to take their photographs, for it is religiously pro-\nhibited for men who are not close relatives to see the picture\nof a woman without hijab (head covering).Atypical example\nof this move has been presented below:\n1. lotf\u00e6n \u00e6z av\u00e6rd\u00e6n-e h\u00e6r guneh durbin-e film-\nb\u00e6rdari xoddari konid.\nPlease avoid bringing video cameras of any kind.\nAnother optional component that appeared in the analyzed\nwedding cards was the name of the publishing company\nwhere the cards had been published, along with its address\nor telephone number. This might be considered as a well-\npublicized attempt on the part of the publishing companies\nto advertise for their cards. 50% of our corpus of analysis\nmade a mention of the locale wherein the wedding cards had\nbeen published. It is also worth mentioning that in some\ncases, 3% in our data, the publishing companies wished the\nnewly-weds well congratulating them on their marriage.\nThe example of this move is as follows:\n2. peyv\u00e6nd-etan mobar\u00e6k.\nCongratulations on your marriage!\nSometimes, a map is included in the wedding cards as well,\nwith arrows indicating the best route to the place where the\nwedding celebration is held. 8.5% of the analyzed data con-\ntained this optional component move.\nThe results of data analysis have been tabulated in Table 1\nthat appears in the appendix.\nConclusion\nThis study, adopting a genre analysis approach, has identi-\nfied seven generic component moves based on which\nIranians, as members of a discourse community, construct\nand interpret wedding invitation texts in the Persian lan-\nguage. Of these identified moves appearing in a virtually\nfixed order, the first (opening), third (announcing the cou-\nple's marriage), fifth (identifying the bride & the groom by\nlast name), and sixth (situating the wedding ceremony)\nmoves seemed to be obligatory, with the rest (identifying the\nbride and the groom by first name, requesting the presence of\n8 SAGE Open\nthe recipients, and other optional components) conceived of\nas optional moves.\nFurthermore, taking the verbal presentation and the visual\norganization of the Persian wedding invitation cards into\naccount, attempts were made to explain each of the selec-\ntions made on the part of the users in the construction of this\ncommunicative event. The organizational details of this\ncommunicative event are embedded in the cultural beliefs\nand social values of the society in question. Focus on\nsocio-cultural norms related to wedding rituals has ascribed\nthe most influential role to religion in shaping the wedding\ninvitation genre in Persian in the way it is.\nIn summary, it would be worthwhile to compare and con-\ntrast similar genres across different cultures to come up with\ntheir \"universal or language specific tendencies,\" to use\nSwales' (1990) terminology (p. 64). Finally, it is hoped that\nthe results of this study can be considered as a stride, though\ntrivial, toward cross-cultural understanding.\nTable 1.
