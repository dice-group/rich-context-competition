Statins are effective\nlipid-lowering drugs, which inhibit choles-\nterol biosynthesis by inhibition of 3-hydroxy-\n3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase. Many stu-\ndies have shown that statins can reduce the\nincidence of cardiovascular events, such as\nmyocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovas-\ncular death.1,2 Moreover, evidence has shown\nthat statins have other effects that are inde-\npendent of their cholesterol-lowering func-\ntion, including inhibition of formation of\nfoam cells, stabilizing plaques, anti-inflam-\nmatory effects, and inhibition of platelet\nactivation.3\u00ad5 These characteristics of statins\nmay be not related to their cholesterol-low-\nering effects, which are called pleiotropic\neffects of statins. Several clinical trials have\ndemonstrated that statins significantly reduce\nthe risk of cardiovascular events in patients\nwith hyperlipidaemia, as well as normocho-\nlesterolemic patients.5,6 Results from these\ntrials indicate that the beneficial effects of\nstatins on cardiovascular events cannot be\nonly explained by their cholesterol-lowering\neffects. Therefore, further research is needed\nto clarify the exact mechanism of antiplatelet\neffects of statins.\nThis study aimed to investigate the effects\nof atorvastatin on platelet aggregation and\nwhether the effects are related to platelet\nconcentrations. Our findings may provide\nevidence of clinical use of atorvastatin in\npatients with or without hyperlipidaemia.\nMaterials and methods\nMaterials\nAtorvastatin was obtained from the\nNational Institute for the Control of\nPharmaceutical and Biological Products.\nADP, arachidonic acid (AA), collagen, and\nepinephrine (EP) were purchased from\nChrono-Log Corp.

These\nfindings indicated that atorvastatin could\ninhibit platelet aggregation in vitro, and\nthese inhibitory effects were related to the\nconcentration of platelets.\nRecently, statins have been shown to be\nthe most important class of lipid-lowering\nagents and are recommended as the first-\nchoice treatment for hyperlipidemia.12\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that\nhyperlipidaemia is associated with platelet\nhyperactivity.13 Platelet activation and\naggregation play important roles in the\npathogenesis of arterial thrombosis and the\noccurrence of acute coronary syndrome.\nMany clinical studies have shown that\npatients could benefit from statins by redu-\ncing myocardial infarction, stroke, and\nThe benefit of statin treatment on\npatients with coronary artery disease\ncannot solely be attributed to their lipid-\nlowering effects.2,16 Atorvastatin has been\nshown to dose-dependently reduce collagen-\ninduced TXA2 synthesis and platelet aggre-\ngation, which are unrelated to its cholesterol\nlowering effects.10 Additionally, direct\ninhibition effects of statins on platelet acti-\nvation are mediated by peroxisome prolif-\nerator-activated receptors and are involved\nin an interaction with protein kinase C-a\n(PKC-a) in platelets.17 Moreover, some\nstudies have showed that direct antiplatelet\neffects of statins are related to upregulation\nof nitric oxide synthetase and suppression of\nstudy, we used isolated platelet suspensions\nto exclude related factors, such as blood\ncholesterol levels, as well as other blood cells,\nwhich might interfere with platelet activity.\nAtorvastatin is extensively metabolized by\nincluding ortho- and parahydroxy atorvasta-\ntin.19 Our in vitro study could not completely\nprovide physiological conditions and repre-\nsent in vivo responses. This is because the\neffects of atorvastatin on platelet aggregation\nTable 3.
