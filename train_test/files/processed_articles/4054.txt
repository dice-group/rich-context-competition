    "abstract": "Abstract. The shading cue is supposed to be a major factor in monocular stereopsis. However,\nthe hypothesis is hardly corroborated by available data. For instance, the conventional stimulus\nused in perception research, which involves a circular disk with monotonic luminance gradient on\na uniform surround, is theoretically `explained' by any quadric surface, including spherical caps or\ncups (the conventional response categories), cylindrical ruts or ridges, and saddle surfaces. Whereas\ncylindrical ruts or ridges are reported when the outline is changed from circular to square, saddle\nsurfaces are never reported. We introduce a method that allows us to differentiate between such\npossible responses. We report observations on a number of variations of the conventional stimulus,\nincluding variations of shape and quality of the boundary, and contexts that allow the observer to\ninfer illumination direction. We find strong and expected influences of outline shape, but, perhaps\nsurprisingly, we fail to find any influence of context, and only partial influence of outline quality.\nMoreover, we report appreciable differences within the generic population. We trace some of the\nidiosyncrasies (as compared to shape from shading algorithms) of the human observer to generic\nproperties of the environment, in particular the fact that many objects are limited in size and elliptically\nconvex over most of their boundaries.\n1 ",

The pictorial cues enable monocular\nthree-dimensional spatial vision (Palmer 1999), and pictorial spatial vision (where binocular\ndisparity merely serves to reveal the picture surface as flat) (Koenderink et al 1994). Three-\ndimensional spatial vision on the basis of monocular cues is known as `monocular stereopsis'.\nThe shading cue is part of the optical interface of animals of many genera (Metzger 1975; Riedl\n1984), including homo, playing a key role in camouflage and foraging. For instance, animals\nliving on relatively featureless flattish terrain tend to be dark dorsally, light ventrally (Metzger\n1975). Such pigmentation implements a `countershading' that tends to optically `flatten',\nand thus `dematerialize' them, an important goal of camouflage. Newly hatched chicks peck\nat circular disks filled with linear luminance gradients in their visual fields (Hershberger\nat graminoid seed grains, thus promoting foraging success (Riedl 1984). In both examples\nthe direction of the luminance gradient is important.

It is a common\nunderstanding in the literature that the `light from above assumption' is a crucial part of\nthe optical interfaces of the majority of genera (Riedl 1984), including man (Brewster 1832;\nThe visual arts have exploited the shading cue since the earliest times, although only\nin recent times (middle ages in Western Europe) in a rational, explicit manner. In the\nnineteenth-century art academies, shading (or chiaroscuro) became an important aspect of\nthe curriculum, easily at a par with linear perspective. Students would spend years in the cast\nroom, patiently shading their drawings of plaster casts of classical sculptures. The shading\ncue was supposed to yield relief to otherwise flattish, cartoon-like drawings, the renaissance\ndistinction of rilievo (or the `reception of the light', also called colorire) and disegno (Baxandall\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, the shading cue was widely researched by the\nthen mainly phenomenologically oriented psychology of perception of continental Europe,\nespecially the Gestaltists of the Graz and Berlin schools. Most of our present understanding\nof the shading cue is due to this literature. Only much later, 1970s and '80s, the topic\nreemerged in the Anglo-Saxon literature of psychology (Ramachandran 1988a, 1988b). Even\nmore recently, 1980s till present, the topic emerged in computer vision (Forsyth and Ponce\nphenomenological, accounts. The earliest formal developments actually go back to lunar\nastronomy of the 1950s (van Diggelen 1951), but these appear to have remained ineffective\nwith respect to perceptual studies. Much of the interest has centered on the `light from above'\nambiguity of the cue (Hill and Bruce 1994).\nIn the current literature of the psychology of visual perception, formal accounts of the\nlevel of physico-mathematical detail as common in machine vision do not seem to play a\nmajor role. Conversely, the current literature of machine vision reveals little understanding\nof the achievements of psychology. This actually makes some sense, either way, because\nthe connection is rather less immediate than it is often made out to be. The relations are\nimportant for the present paper, which is why we start with a more formal discussion,\nalthough our contribution is mainly of an empirical, investigative nature.\n2 The shading cue, a formal account\nThe conventional stimulus of biological vision research, with respect to the shading cue, is a\ncircular disk filled with a linear luminance gradient, usually in a uniform surrounding field,\noften of roughly the average luminance of the disk (figure 1). It is frequently implied that this\nlargely exhausts the possibilities, apart from having more of the same, and that this stimulus\nmay evoke one of two alternative impressions, namely convexity or concavity. Although this\nis rarely explicitly acknowledged, in many experiments the stimuli are of this very type, and\nthe acceptable responses are limited to these alternatives, whereas the conclusions are of a\nvery general nature. Thus, we believe this characterization to be a fair one, although there\nare exceptions, of course.\nAlthough not often explicitly formulated, the conventional stimulus is evidently an\nattempt to isolate the shading cue proper. The choice of the circular aperture serves to\neffectively localize the cue; the degree of localization can be controlled through the choice\nof diameter. Since shading requires a finite area for its definition, a rotationally symmetric\naperture of limited size is the obvious choice. The choice of a linear gradient serves to define\nthe purely local structure of the shading. At any generic location (eg not an extremum) of\nan arbitrary shading pattern the structure can arbitrarily be well approximated by such a\nFigure 1. A conventional stimulus configuration in shape from shading psychophysics. The relevant\nfeature is supposed to be the linear gradient (changing from black to white from left to right). Here,\nthe gradient is put in a circular disk, superimposed on a uniform background of the average grey level,\nwithout encircling the circular shape in any other way. This is typical for many studies.\nlinear gradient if the aperture is appropriately restricted. The structure of the shading is then\nfully described by the spatial gradient of the illuminance, a vectorial point property. It seems\nlikely that the original choice for the conventional stimulus, sometime during the nineteenth\ncentury, was motivated by such considerations. It can easily be formalized in mathematical\nterms.\nIn a formal view, the linear gradient may thus be understood as a linear approximation to\narbitrary smooth luminance distributions; in that respect the choice is indeed a natural one.\nThe implication is that one understands the cue to be a local one; this is part of the linear\napproximation. In biological terms one assumes the existence of receptive field structures\ndedicated to the shading cue. In this respect, the conventional stimulus could also be called\na minimal stimulus because the linear gradient is an abstraction of the first-order differential\nstructure at a single point, rather than the pattern of illuminance over an extended surface\npatch.\nA general shading pattern will have the illuminance gradient changing from point to\npoint. It can be understood, at least in the formal sense, as a linear superposition of local\nsamples. In a reductionist framework it then makes sense to study the local case first, because\nit embodies the information that is provided by a single local gradient detector, which many\nhave posited to be the relevant information for the perception of local curvature. (In this\nrespect, the choice is similar to that of sine-wave gratings as a basis for the description\nof arbitrary illuminance patterns.) Psychophysical research on more complicated cases\ninvolving shading requires very different methods from the ones discussed in this paper\nOne conceptual problem with the choice of the conventional stimulus is the nature of\nthe boundary of the aperture, in this case a sharp, circular edge. This introduces ambiguity\nbecause the edge can be interpreted in a number of different ways as a depth or shape cue.\nWe consider this issue in this paper.\nOther conceptual problems have to do with the physics of illuminated, scattering, curved\nsurfaces. If the conventional stimulus leads to monocular stereopsis, then the observer\napparently made a number of implicit assumptions concerning the pictorial scene. The\n162 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\nphysics is complicated, but the conventional interpretation in psychology is in terms of\nLambert's cosine law. This ignores many factors, such as the location and nature of the\nsource, the physics of surface scattering, the effects of multiple scattering, and the effects of\nvignetting. Only when Lambert's law dominates is there a one-to-one relation between the\nradiance at the pupil of the observer's eye and the spatial attitudes of surface elements in\nthe scene. Thus the conventional interpretation is indeed a natural one. It is also the natural\nsetting for the simplest machine vision algorithms involving shading.\nPhysical optics yields a simple model for shading in the form of Lambert's cosine law.\nThis ignores a number of physical effects that are typically important in real settings, though\n(Forsyth and Zisserman 1991; Koenderink and van Doorn 1983). The illumination of a surface\nelement is proportional to the cosine of the angle subtended by its surface normal and the\ndirection towards the light source as seen from the surface. This relation has been known\nsince the eighteenth century (Bouguer 1729; Lambert 1760). In itself this relation is not\nimportant in vision, because observers sample radiance, not irradiance, whereas the relation\nbetween the two is often a complicated one. For typical surfaces the radiance depends\nboth upon the direction of illumination and the viewing direction. Only for Lambertian\nsurfaces does the viewing direction not matter and does one have a strict linear relation\nbetween the radiance received by the eye and the irradiance of the surface. Fortunately,\nmany diffusely scattering natural surfaces (like paper) are approximately Lambertian. Given\na smooth Lambertian surface, the luminance will thus co-vary with the direction of the\nnormal, the direction towards the source being generally fixed. Over small stretches the\nchange will be approximately a linear gradient. The luminance gradient thus reveals a change\nof the surface normal, that is to say, curvature, or shape. Not any aspect of surface curvature\nwill be thus `revealed', though, because rotating the normal about the light direction will not\nlead to any change of the cosine, and it consequently fails to imprint itself on the shading.\nApparently the shading cue is inherently ambiguous (see figure 2).\nUnderstanding the nature of this ambiguity of the shading cue is of obvious importance.\nIt is a complicated issue, though, and we will approach it in a number of steps.\nConsider a uniform patch in the visual field, and assume it to be due to an illuminated\nsurface of constant albedo (say, white paper or plaster), illuminated with a homogeneous,\nunidirectional beam. (Sunlight is an example; the technical term is collimated beam.)\nThis is perhaps the simplest example of `shading'. What inferences are possible? This\nis an instructive example. The magnitude of the luminance is clearly irrelevant; vision\nhas sufficient `constancies' to ensure that donning sunglasses is not going to change the\nperception of the geometry of the scene in front of you all that much. Thus, the relevant\n`observable' is simply the absence of a luminance gradient. It reveals the absence of surface\nnormal variations with respect to the (assumed a priori unknown) direction of the beam, so\nthe possible inferences are an arbitrary beam direction illuminating a surface that subtends\na fixed slant with that direction. Such surfaces include cones of rotation with axes coinciding\nwith the beam direction. These are evidently non-generic, though, because there is no reason\nwhy the scene should be `tuned' to the beam direction. Hence, a reasonable shape from\nshading algorithm will discard such (infinite) possibilities offhand. One ends up with planes.\nThe scene could be any plane, of any spatial attitude, illuminated from any direction. Thus,\nyou have a rather strong shape inference (a plane), although most of the scene geometry\nremains in doubt.\nNext, consider a linear gradient. It remains the case that the absolute luminance has to\nbe irrelevant; thus the `observable' is the relative luminance gradient, a contrast. It is clear a\npriori that the spatial attitude of the surface element will remain unspecified, and so will the\nslant of the beam direction with respect to the surface. The relevant `illumination direction'\nFigure 2. In the top row, a surface strip that curves along the direction of light flow. The blue arrows\npoint towards the light source; the red arrows are surface normals. The angle subtended by the normals\nand the light direction decreases gradually from left to right in the picture because the normal turns\ndue to the curvature. Due to Lambert's cosine law, the surface illumination increases gradually from\nleft to right, hence the curvature is revealed by the shading. In the bottom row, the strip is curved\ntransverse to the direction of light flow. The normals turn around the light direction, subtending a\nconstant angle with it. Due to Lambert's cosine law, the surface illumination is constant around the\nstrip. (This is not shown in the 3D rendering.) Thus, shading fails to reveal the surface curvature in this\ncase. This is the basic ambiguity of `shape from shading'. In the left column we show the 3D scene, in\nthe right column the shading.\nis the tilt (that is, the component of the beam direction at right angles to the surface normal\ndirection); we call it the `light flow direction', adopting the jargon of visual artists. One simple\nambiguity has to do with the slant of the beam with respect to the surface. The gradient\nmagnitude depends both on the curvature of the surface and on the slant of the beam with\nrespect to the surface, more curvature and less slant leading to a greater gradient. Thus,\nyou obtain a whole family of equivalent inferences. Another way of putting it is to say that\nshading does not reveal the depth of relief (see figure 3).(1)\n(1) Consider a shape z(x, y) = 1\n(ax2 +by2) in Cartesian coordinates, viewed from the direction of the\nZ-axis. The direction of the Z-axis is also the direction of the outward surface normal at the origin.\nMore generally, the normal is n(x, y) = {-ax,-by,1} 1+ a2x2 +b2y2. (The necessary differential\ngeometrical background is summarized in Lipschutz 1969.)\nLet the direction towards the source be i(t,s) = {cos(t)sin(s),sin(t)sin(s),cos(s)} where t denotes\nthe tilt, s the slant. Then the illuminance I(x, y) equals En(x, y)\u00b7i(t,s), by Lambert's cosine law. Here\nE is the normal illuminance caused by the beam, and the dot denotes the scalar (or dot) product.\nThus one has I(x, y) = E[\u00ada cos(t)sin(s)x \u00adb sin(t)sin(s)y +cos(s)] 1+ a2x2 +b2y2. The irradiance\nat the origin is I0 = I(0,0) = E cos(s), which is just Lambert's cosine law. The gradient at the origin\nx = y = 0 is g = grad I(0,0) = \u00adE sin(s){a cos(t),b sin(t)} (by direct differentiation with respect to x and\ny). Perhaps a perceptually more relevant entity is the gradient contrast, which is c = g/I0. One has\nc = \u00adtan(s){a cos(t),b sin(t)}. Thus the direction of the gradient is given by the angle  such that one\nhas tan() = b/a tan(t).\nThis completely summarizes the fundamental theory of the conventional stimulus. It relates the\nsurface shape (the ratio of principal curvatures b/a) and the tilt (t, reckoned with respect to a principal\n164 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\nFigure 3. The basic shading ambiguity. This shows only the effect of the tilt; there is an additional\nambiguity (known as the `bas-relief ambiguity' in computer vision) due to the slant. The rows show\nthe shading of the surfaces on the right for a variety of illumination directions (the tilt), as indicated by\nthe arrows. Notice that the conventional stimulus allows valid interpretations of any of the surfaces in\nthe right column. The `cap' and `cup' interpretations represent only part of the conventional response\ncategories.\nThe tilt is very important; the slant mainly effects the contrast. If the curvature is\northogonal to the light flow direction, like a cylindrical gutter illuminated along its axis,\nthis will fail to generate a gradient. Only curvature along the light flow direction, like a\ncylindrical ridge illuminated transverse to its axis, can lead to luminance modulations. This\nis an issue in cartography, where shading fails to reveal valleys and mountain ridges running\nalong the (virtual) illumination direction. If the results are not acceptable, cartographers will\noften (arbitrarily) change the tilt locally. The general rule is simple enough: curvature in the\ndirection of illuminance flow generates shading, whereas curvature orthogonal to it does\nnot.\nThe simple considerations discussed above have far-reaching consequences. If you\nobserve a luminance gradient, you thereby observe a curvature of the surface in the direction\nof the flow of illumination. However, the directions of principal curvature of the surface\ncould be anything, and you need to infer not only their orientations but two independent\nprincipal curvatures. The upshot is that anything goes shape-wise. The surface could be\n`convex' or `concave' (implication being `umbilical', that is to say, like the inside or outside\nof a spherical shell), but equally well cylindrical or saddle shaped. Thus the conventional\nresponse categories are artificially limited to two instances out of a continuum of principled\npossibilities. This is illustrated in figure 3.\nWe conclude that the conventional response categories--`cap' or `cup', both `umbilics'\nin the terminology of the geometry of smoothly curved surfaces--by no means exhaust the\nactually relevant response categories. A large part of the literature (virtually all that uses the\nconventional stimulus) suffers from this constraint. One wonders how this came to be.\ndirection) to the direction of the linear gradient. When t is known and  observed, the shape (b/a)\nis determined. If t is not know (the generic case) the shape and tilt are confounded. This type of\nshape ambiguity was considered by Freeman (1994) in global settings. Even in case t is known the\nmagnitudes of a and b are confounded with the slant s: this is the `bas-relief ambiguity' of machine\nvision.\nFor an umbilical b/a = +1, thus  = t (a cup), or  = t +180 (a cap), whereas for a symmetrical\nsaddle b/a = \u00ad1, thus  = t +90, or  = t +270. Thus the inference should be a saddle if the gradient\nis at right angles to the light flow. When c = {0,0}, s > 0, one possible inference is t = 0, a = 0, a cylinder\nilluminated along its axis.\nHere we meet our first research target: Why do human observers limit possible shapes to\numbilicals? Are human observers somehow unable to see saddle shapes? There is indeed\nsome historical indication for that. Leon Battista Alberti (1435) was an Italian intellectual\nwho wrote an important treatise on painting, which contains an `exhaustive' list of surface\nshapes. He writes (book I, paragraph 8):\nWe have now to treat of other qualities which rest like a skin over all the surface of the plane.\nThese are divided into three sorts. Some planes are flat, others are hollowed out, and others\nare swollen outward and are spherical. To these a fourth may be added which is composed\nof any two of the above. The flat plane is that which a straight ruler will touch in every part if\ndrawn over it. The surface of the water is very similar to this. The spherical plane is similar\nto the exterior of a sphere. We say the sphere is a round body, continuous in every part; any\npart on the extremity of that body is equidistant from its centre. The hollowed plane is within\nand under the outermost extremities of the spherical plane as in the interior of an egg shell.\nThe compound plane is in one part flat and in another hollowed or spherical like those on the\ninterior of reeds or on the exterior of columns.\nThus, Alberti lists the convexities and concavities, along with non-generic possibilities like\ncylinders and planes (having prior probability zero in the space of shapes), but he completely\nfails to list the (generic!) saddle shapes (figure 4). Alberti's list remained unchallenged for\ncenturies. The complete inventory of local surface shapes is due to Carl Friedrich Gau\u00df and\ndates from the early-nineteenth century (Gau\u00df 1827) (figure 5). Here, we focus our research\ntarget a bit tighter: Why are saddle shapes (figure 6) apparently ignored in human visual\nawareness?\nFigure 4. The inventory of local surface shapes from Alberti's De Pictura. Note the lack of hyperbolic\n(saddle) surfaces.\n166 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\nA well-known observation is that the same linear gradient leads to different shape\nexperience when rendered within different outlines. The same gradient that looks like a\nspherical shell in one case may look like a cylinder in another case. Given the ambiguities, it\nis not that surprising that perceptions may vary. What (perhaps) is surprising is that many\nobservers have strong convictions of various kinds. Apparently, observers use more cues\nthan just shading, and since it is not possible to present a `pure gradient', boundaries will be\npresent, and will be used as additional cues (see figure 7).\nFigure 5. The full set of local surface shapes can be naturally parameterized by a finite length segment.\nThe classification is due to Gau\u00df. From left to right, you have a concave umbilic, a concave cylinder, a\nsymmetrical saddle, a convex cylinder, and a convex umbilic. It is a continuous family; thus you have\nto imagine the interpolated shapes. The region between the cylinders comprises hyperbolic (saddle)\nshapes, whereas the outer regions are elliptic (like the inside or outside of egg shells). This rectifies\nand completes Alberti's list illustrated in figure 4.\nFigure 6. Left: a helicoidal (twisted) surface. Right: a square piece of it rendered as a `twisted thick\nplate', illuminated from above. Note that the luminance gradient is at right angles to the illumination\nflow direction, something that is impossible with spheroidal surfaces. It is still just a linear gradient,\nthough; thus saddles are possible interpretations of the conventional stimulus (figure 1), although\nthey are never reported.\nConsider how a `hard' outline, like that used in the conventional stimuli, may appear\n(figure 8):\n\u00b7 as an `occluding contour' as when looking at a sphere;\n\u00b7 as a `dihedral edge' as when looking at an internal edge in a cube;\n\u00b7 dihedral edges may also appear as occluding contours (artist call these `cutting edges');\n\u00b7 as the boundary of a surface patch, eg as when looking into a spherical cup (we will\nrefer to it as a `flag edge').\nIn case the outline has vertices (like a square), the interpretation may well change at a\nvertex. All such interpretations are generic, and it seems impossible to put a prior probability\ndistribution on them. However, it certainly seems the case that some interpretations are more\nFigure 7. Some, though by no means all, possible interpretations of the circular outline of the\nconventional stimulus (see footnote 1). Suppose the interpretation is `cap' (the left column), then the\noutline is often interpreted as an occluding contour (top) or a dihedral edge (bottom). In case the\ninterpretation is `cup' (the right column), the outline is often seen as a dihedral edge (top) or a flag\nedge (bottom). In the latter case the interpretation as an occluding contour does not work. Thus, the\ncup and cap interpretations are not symmetrical with respect to the possible interpretation of the\ncircular outline as a depth cue.\noccluding contour\nflag edge\ncutting edge\ndihedral edge\nFigure 8. Examples of occluding contours (the sphere), dihedral edges (internal edges of the cube),\nand cutting edges (external edges of the cube; both cutting edges and occluding contours), and flag\nedges (the edge of the hemi-cylindrical surface on the right).\nlikely than others, given certain contexts. Some things seem unlikely, though--for instance, a\nchange of interpretation along a smooth stretch of outline.\nSimple contextual changes near the outline will load the priors on the various possible\ninterpretations differently. Thus, one expects such modifications to change the experiences\nin the case of a single gradient; to investigate this is our second research objective.\nOf course, one expects frequent disagreements between the visual awareness of different\nobservers in experiments like these. Perhaps unfortunately, the literature is not provide a\nrich source of data on that issue. But even a cursory investigation reveals major differences\nbetween generic observers. For instance, we estimate that at least one out of five persons fails\nto see any shading induced relief at all, even when confronted with the standard stimuli from\n168 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\nthe literature. This became evident when recruiting observers for the present task. Note that\nwe did not continue testing these observers in the experiment reported below. Thus, the third\nresearch objective is to obtain an initial impression of the type of differences encountered in\nthe generic population.\n3 Experiment\nOur aim was to investigate the awareness of surface shape due to a single linear gradient of\ngiven extent in the presence of varying contexts. We considered different types of context,\nchanging background, nature of outline, and indication of illuminance flow direction.\nAs contexts we used:\n\u00b7 a uniform background of contrasting color, suggesting a distant backdrop (figure 9,\nupper left);\n\u00b7 a uniform background of the average luminance, suggesting a substrate of the same\nmaterial, the object most likely being `part' of it (figure 9, upper right);\n\u00b7 a uniform background of the average luminance, suggesting a substrate of the same\nmaterial, the object most likely being part of it, but `thickened' and apparently\nilluminated, so as to reveal the direction of illumination (figure 9, lower left);\n\u00b7 a uniform background of the average luminance with an aperture, suggesting a\nsubstrate of the same material, `thickened' and apparently illuminated, so as to reveal\nthe direction of illumination. The object is `seen through the aperture' and appears on\nthe blue backdrop (figure 9, lower right).\nFigure 9. The four contexts used in the experiment. At top left, the `blue sky' backdrop, it should appear\ntotally unrelated to the stimuli proper, thus favoring cutting edges and occluding contours. At top\nright, the `cartoon' background. It relates to the stimuli (same material) and thus favors dihedral edges.\nAt bottom left, a `thick pedestal'. Like the cartoon background, it favors dihedral edges, in addition it\nvisually specifies the illumination flow direction. At bottom right, the `window'. Here, the illumination\nflow direction is specified, but the stimuli appear (as seen through the aperture) in the `blue sky'.\nThese contexts can be combined with manipulations of the outline of the stimulus proper,\nthe region (circular or rectangular as the case may be) containing the linear gradient. We\nimplemented the following cases (figure 10):\n\u00b7 circles and squares (lined up with the gradient) without further embellishment (not\nillustrated);\n\u00b7 circles with a thin concentric annulus, modulated in gray level so as to suggest the\nbevel of a concave thick cup (figure 10, left);\n\u00b7 squares with two beveled sides of different gray level, so as to suggest a thick concave\ncylinder (figure 10, center);\n\u00b7 squares with two skewed beveled sides of different gray level, so as to suggest a thick\ntwisted plate (figure 10, right).\nFigure 10. Three types of outline. From left to right, a concave `circular thick plate', a concave\n`cylindrical thick plate', and a `twisted thick plate'. In all cases, the luminance gradient is the same,\nyet some observers are expected to have the compelling awareness of (from left to right) a concave\numbilic, a concave cylinder, and a saddle. The modulated outline yields a `minimum context' of a\nspecial kind; it is intimately connected to (part of) the object (not a mere background).\nIn cases where the illumination direction was `visually specified', we used a `drop\nshadow'.(2) In the absence of a drop shadow, the illumination direction remains optically\nunspecified.\nThis leads to a large number of combinations [especially taking illumination directions,\nprobe orientations (see below), and stimulus orientations into account], and combining and\nintermixing all these proved rather time consuming.(3)\n3.2 Principle of the measurement\nAlthough we are primarily interested in the pictorial relief (shape) evoked by the stimuli,\nit is not trivial to measure this. Remember that we consider surface shape in general, a\ntwo degrees of freedom (eg the ratio of the principal curvatures and the orientation of\nthe direction of largest principal curvature) set, much more intricate than the classical\nconvex\u00adconcave dichotomy.\nSince the absolute distance and the spatial attitude of the pictorial surface are not\nspecified through the shading (although fronto-parallelity is suggested by a circular outline,\netc), we avoid the use of depth estimates of pairwise depth comparisons. Instead, we used a\nconfiguration of three probe points, one bisecting the segment subtended by the other two in\nthe visual field (figure 11). The task then was to judge whether the center point in visual space\nis before, inline, or behind the midpoint of the segment in pictorial space. This reveals the\nsign of curvature in the direction of the segment. Repeating this for various orientations (at\n45\u00ba increments) of the segment allows us to classify responses as convex elliptical, concave\nelliptical, convex cylindrical, concave cylindrical, and hyperbolic (saddle shaped).\n(2) On drop shadows, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shadow.\n(3)For the majority of conditions (types of outlines x types of context), four illumination directions\nwere used, in combination with three probe orientations, and these were repeated three times. For the\ncylinder cases, two orientations were used, in combination with six illumination directions and four\ntrials.\n170 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\nFigure 11. Example of the probe configuration, in this case for the thick concave circular plate. The\nthree collinear points appear in any of four orientations, spaced by 45 increments. The task is to judge\nwhether the point in the middle is in front, inline, or behind the linear segment (in pictorial space) of\nthe two outermost points.\nObservers were members of the different laboratories who volunteered to participate (N =\n12). Two of them were authors; the remaining were naive regarding the details of the methods\nand the goals of the study. In addition, some others were given a few practice trials, but they\nwere not tested formally because they appeared unable to reach satisfactory monocular\nstereopsis at all.\nA session contained 432 presentations (see footnote 3); observers took about an hour to\ncomplete it. Each presentation started with an initial period of 2 s in which only the stimulus\nwas presented. Observers were instructed to attend to their awareness of surface shape. In\ncase they succeeded, they had apparently achieved monocular stereopsis. This period was\nimmediately followed by a period of 0.5 s in which the probe configuration was superimposed\non the picture. Observers were instructed to decide on the depth relation of the probe dots,\nthat is, to decide on the depth of the center dot in relation to the segment (in pictorial space)\ndefined by the two outermost ones. Then, both probe and stimulus disappeared, and the\nobservers were free to take their time to indicate their response by selecting the appropriate\nradio button.(4) The radio buttons were a triple, marked as `farther', `closer', and `in line'.\nTheir response time was recorded, although we did not analyze it in detail. (It was not the\nmeasure of primary interest since the instructions did not emphasize speed of responding.)\nIt was typically about two seconds (median). After responding, they could trigger the next\npresentation, and so forth till the conclusion of the session.\nThe pictures were presented on the LCD screen of a Macintosh notebook, subtending 37\u00ba\nof visual angle. Viewing distance was 50 cm. The stimulus window subtended 15\u00ba. The room\nwas darkened, but the observers were fully aware of the screen, and thus the fact that they\nwere looking at pictures rather than a physical scene. Viewing was binocular. The sequence\nof presentations was randomized over each session.\nAfter conclusion of the session, responses were sorted and combined in subsets pertaining\nto single pictures, thus only differing by the probe orientation. Thus, we obtained `convex',\n`concave', and `flat' responses for each of four probe orientations (differing by multiples of\n45\u00ba), relative to a fiducial orientation for the stimulus. Notice that flat is a distinct category\n(cylinder axes or asymptotic directions in the case of saddles). Thus, the task cannot be\nformulated as a two-alternative one. Since stimuli themselves were presented in various\norientations, again differing by multiples of 45\u00ba and including the horizontal and vertical, we\nobtained multiple responses for each relative orientation.\n(4)A radio button, or option button, is a type of graphical user interface element that allows the user to\nchoose only one of a predefined set of options. They were named after the physical buttons used on\nolder car radios to select preset stations--when one of the buttons was pressed, other buttons would\npop out, leaving the pressed button the only button in the `pushed in' position.\n3.4 Analysis of the results\nThe data allow for the investigation of interobserver consistency, the influence of context,\nillumination direction, and stimulus shape.\n3.4.1 Interobserver variability. The interobserver variability is quite low in the case of the\nconventional stimulus (see figure 1) presented in various contexts; the main variation is in an\nidiosyncratic tendency to fail to reach monocular stereopsis. This is evident from a tendency\ntowards essentially random responses. In figure 12 we plot the responses in barycentric\ncoordinates with all convex, all concave, or all flat responses as vertices; thus the center\nof the triangle represents equal amounts of convex, concave, and flat responses. Although\nresponses cluster near the convex vertex, there is a clear tendency towards the center of the\ntriangle.\nIn all other cases the interobserver variability is very striking. These cases are discussed\nbelow.\n-\nBlue sky\n-\nConvexity on pedestal\n-\nWindowed convexity\n-\nCartoon background\n-\nConcavity on pedestal\n-\nWindowed concavity\nFigure 12. These are results for the conventional stimulus, the circular disk with linear gradient. Since\na response is either convex (+), concave (-), or flat (=), it can be conveniently represented as a point in\na triangle [using M\u00f6bius (1827) barycentric coordinates].(5) We summarize the distributions through\nmedian and quartile regions (using linear interpolation between successive convex hulls). The leftmost\ncolumn has the blue sky context on top, the cartoon background at bottom. The center column has\nthe pedestal context, the right-hand one the windowed context. In the latter two cases, there is a\ndistinction between nominally convex and concave cases; in the former cases, such a distinction\ncannot be made.\n3.4.2 Influence of context and illumination flow direction. A major finding of this study is\nimplicit in the representation of the data in figure 12. These data are for the conventional\nstimulus, a circular disk filled with a linear luminance gradient. Irrespective of the nature\nof the background (blue sky, cartoon background, illuminated pedestal, or aperture), the\nresponses cluster on the convex vertex. Even the visually compelling illumination direction\nin the case of the illuminated pedestal is ineffective in yielding a convex\u00adconcave distinction.\nAlthough there may be statistically significant differences between these cases, they are\nevidently very minor. The preference for convex is perhaps surprising in view of the fact that\nall light directions occurred equally frequently.\n172 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\n3.4.3 Influence of stimulus shape. We have used both circular and square outlines. Does the\nshape of the outline make a difference on the pictorial relief? An answer to this question is\nimplicit in the data presented in figure 13. The result is not clear cut, though, because of\nrather strong idiosyncratic variations.\nIn the case of the circular disk, there are no significant differences between the responses\nfor the various orientations of the sampling array. In the case of the square, a number of\nobservers respond differently, though. A fraction (10\u00ad20%) of the observers experience the\nlinear gradient inside a square as essentially a flat surface (all bars predominantly yellow in\nfigure 13 upper and center panel). Some observers (about half) evidently experience a convex\ncylinder. This is true even if the cylinder is actually concave, but this need not surprise us: we\nalready know that observers often ignore context.\nThus, many observers experience a cylindrical instead of a spherical surface if the\nboundary shape is changed from circular to square. This is by no means a fixed rule, though;\nfor roughly equally as many observers the pictorial relief simply flattens out (the yellow in\nthe upper and center panels).\n3.4.4 Influence of boundary modulation. We consider three cases: the thick concave disk, the\nthick concave cylinder, and the thick twisted plate. We expected the first two to be similar\nand the latter case to be qualitatively different from these. We start with the thick concave\nWhereas the illuminated pedestal context is ineffective in revealing concavity, the\nboundary modulation evidently is, at least for many observers. For a few observers, the\nexperience of a concavity is absolutely compelling, though for many it evidently is not.\nThe case of the thick concave cylinder (bottom panel of figure 13) is very similar. Half\nof the observers have the compelling experience of a concave cylinder. The others have a\nmixed response. (One should remember here that we selected only observers who actually\nobtained stereopsis.)\nThe case of the thick twisted plate is especially interesting given the historical context\n(Alberti's `exhaustive' list of local surface shapes that remained unchallenged till Gau\u00df's\nwork). See figure 15.\nOnly one observer (JW) responds in a way that clearly reflects the `twist'. Apparently this\nobserver experiences a saddle shape. There is a wide variability in the responses of the other\nobservers. Some (three or four) appear to have the awareness of a convex cylinder, alternating\nwith flatness; the others show mixed responses.\n4 Conclusions\nWe may draw a few compelling conclusions from these data.\nAppreciable differences exist within the population in the ability to achieve monocular\nstereopsis. In the interpretation of the data one should take notice of the fact that we did a\nquick, informal screening before setting observers to the task. We discarded about one in five\noffhand, those who were apparently unable to achieve stereopsis in any case. Even in the\nones we set to the task, the results vary. For some the modulations of the boundary led to\ncompelling experiences of the type one expects from the analysis of the optics, but for many\nthese were apparently ignored.\nContext turned out to be ignored by all observers. This is true for the nature of the\nsubstrate (blue sky, cartoon background, illuminated thick pedestal) as well as for the visual\nindication of illuminance flow direction (thick pedestal, window). This is a rather striking\nresult, since most demonstrations of context seem convincing from a phenomenological\npoint of view.\nThe shape of the boundary evidently determines the shape of the pictorial relief. While\nthe circular outline invariably led to spherical (almost always convex) impressions, the\nFigure 13. For the case of the cylinder we have split the responses with respect to the probe orientation.\nThe orientation of 90 corresponds to the cylinder axis; the orientation of 0 thus should have the\n(absolute) largest curvature. The color code is: convex  Red(R), concave  Blue(B), flat  Yellow(Y).\nThus, the `veridical response' would be RRYR for the convex cylinder and BBYB for the concave cylinder\nand the thick concave plate [as, by a fortunate accident, exemplified by the first observer (AD)] in each\npanel. All observers are (arbitrarily) shown in alphabetical order of their initials.\n174 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\n-\nConcavity on pedestal\n-\nThick concave disk\nFigure 14. At left, the responses for a concavity in the pedestal context; at right, the responses for the\nthick concave disk in the pedestal context.\nAD\nFA\nHR\nJW\nKT\nMB\nMS\nMW\nNN\nRG\nSC\nSP\nThick twisted plate\nFigure 15. Again, we have split the responses with respect to the probe orientation. The orientations\nof 0 and 90 correspond to the asymptotic (flat) directions; the orientations of \u00b145 thus should have\nopposite curvatures. The color code is again: convex  Red, concave  Blue, flat  Yellow. Thus the\n`veridical response' would be Y(R/B)Y(B/R), although we cannot distinguish between R/B and B/R\n(unfortunately). The response of the fourth observer in the top row (JW) comes close to this, except\nfor the tendency to respond \"convex\" for the 90 asymptotic direction.\nsquare outline led to cylindrical impressions in many observers and led to uncertainty in the\nresponses of the others (a tendency to flatness instead of sphericity) (Cate and Behrmann\nBoundary modulations are very effective for a fraction of the observers. In the case\nof the thick concave disk and the thick concave cylinder, the boundary modulations\nled to compelling experiences of a spherical concave shell and a concave cylinder for\nsome observers, the boundary information apparently overriding the (strong) tendency\nto experience convexity. Others largely ignored this information, though traces can often be\nspotted in their pattern of responses (Cate and Behrmann 2010; Humphrey et al 1996).\nHuman observers have a strong bias towards convexity as opposed to concavity (Langer\nHuman observers ignore the possibility of saddle-shaped surfaces. In this case, we\nfound only a single exception, albeit a very significant one. Observers apparently notice\nthe inconsistency of their visual experience, as the response patterns clearly deviate from\nthose for the conventional case of the circular disk with linear gradient. However, they fail to\nreach a consistent, stable visual awareness of a definitely curved surface.\nAll this implies that one should take the established literature consensus with a grain of\nsalt. One reason may be that interobserver variability is not generally appreciated (for an\nexception, see Liu and Todd 2004) and possibly leads to suppression of reports. All this also\nindicates that theories based on machine vision algorithms of `shape from shading' are not\nlikely to be applicable as models of human monocular stereopsis. It would be easy enough\nto frame such theories that would beat our observers in the case of our stimulus set. But, of\ncourse, the stimuli are extreme abstractions of what occurs in natural images.\nThe data suggest to us that the human observer tends to assume the boundary to be\nan occluding one, and the background to be irrelevant. This would apply to many cases in\nthe real world, most cases where a small, convex object is seen against a relatively distant\nbackground. This would explain the problematic nature of saddle shapes (boundary a flag\nedge), and the precarious nature of square outlines (only part of the outline can be an\noccluding boundary or dihedral edge, the remainder flag edge). (See figure 16.) It also explains\nthe low frequency of concave responses, since these require either dihedral edges or flag\nedges. From a more general perspective, these assumptions boil down to genericity (general\nviewpoint, general position of unrelated parts) assumptions.\nFigure 16. Left: the spherical cap (like the spherical cup) fits a planar support by way of a dihedral edge\n(the black curve). Center: the convex cylinder may only share two of its generators with the supporting\nplane (the dihedral edges drawn in black). The remainder of the boundary has to `lift out of the plane'\nand become flag edge. Right: the square saddle patch does not `fit' the supporting plane at all. All its\nedges have to be interpreted as flag edges.\nIn retrospect, one may trace the curious lacun\u00e6 in Alberti's `exhaustive' list of surface\nshapes to this. The analog in geometry may be the fact that objects of limited size with\nsmooth skins cannot be bounded with overall hyperbolic surfaces (as proven by Hilbert\n1901), whereas they can with overall elliptic ones (as with an egg).\nThat the hyperbolic areas are typically ignored in human understanding of form is also\nevident from common academic practice. For instance, the sculptor/author Rogers (1969,\nSculpture students modeling from the living model used to be told to take care of the\npositive forms and leave the negative ones to take care of themselves. They would arrive\nat the hollow of an armpit or a navel or the channel of the spine by building up the convex\nshapes that surround them. By working in this way they would come to see more clearly that\nthese hollows are not concave at all but are formed by the grouping of convex forms which\nare blended together by the unifying effect of the skin.\nThis is illustrated in figure 17. The awareness of the channel between the two convexities\nemerges as a secondary effect due to the primary perception of the two convexities. Thus,\nthe fact \"that we can see hyperbolic regions\" (as was pointed out by reviewers of the present\npaper) is in no way at odds with the finding that human observers are largely 'saddle blind'.\nThe saddle regions appear default, as a kind of glue that patches the convexities together.\n176 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\nFigure 17. At left, an ovoid with two cups grafted on it; at right, an ovoid with two smoothly curved\nprotuberances. These hills have the same curvature as the cups at their summits, but they are joined\nto the overall ovoid by smooth fillets. The surface in between the hills then defaults to a smooth saddle\nor pass. If one sees the hills, one at least implicitly `sees the saddle', but it is by no means necessarily\nthe case that the visual system detects the saddle as an individual surface element. In many cultures\nthe form at left--which is locally all convex--would be considered an apt sculptural rendering of the\nform at right. This makes sense because the elliptical regions (ovoid, hills) look like `things', whereas\nthe fillet between the hills looks like nothing specific.\nIn summary, although perhaps surprising from the perspective of shape from shading\ntheory, our findings might be related to the (statistical) fact that many objects are small,\nbounded by elliptic, convex surfaces, and seen against backgrounds to which they bear no\nrelation.\n"
