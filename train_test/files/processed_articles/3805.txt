It\nwas hypothesized that the higher doses of\nlidocaine with venous occlusion would be\nmore effective for reducing pain compared\nwith 40 mg lidocaine.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nPatients with American Association of\nAnesthesiology physical status I or II who\nelective surgery at Ajou University Hospital,\nSuwon, Republic of Korea between 15 July\nwith a history of neurological problems or\nallergies and those who had taken medica-\ntions including sedatives and analgesics\nwithin 24 h of surgery, which may affect\nthe study results, were excluded. In addition,\npatients with a body weight of < 55 kg were\nexcluded as the maximum dose of lidocaine\nin these patients would be <1.5 mg/kg.\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom all patients and the study protocol was\napproved by the Ajou University Hospital\nInstitutional Review Board.\nStudy design\nPatients were randomly allocated into three\ngroups using a sealed-envelope method\nimmediately prior to induction of anaesthe-\nsia. Groups received: (i) 40 mg lidocaine\n(group L40); (ii) 60 mg lidocaine (group\nplacebo group was not included for ethical\nreasons. To preserve blinding, normal saline\n(0.9%) was added to give a total volume of\nstudy medication of 4 ml in groups L40 and\nL60. All study drugs were prepared just\nbefore injection at room temperature.\nMicroemulsion propofol (Aquafol\u00d5;\nDaewon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Seoul,\nRepublic of Korea), which contained 1%\n(PP188) as a nonionic block copolymer\nsurfactant, and 0.7% polyethylene glycol\n(PEG) 660 hydroxystearate as a nonionic\nsurfactant, was prepared in a 50 ml syringe.\nA commercially available, two-channel,\ntarget-controlled infusion (TCI) pump\n(Orchestra\u00d5 Base Primea with a two-infu-\nsion pump module: Module DPS\nOrchestra\u00d5 IS3; Fresenius Vial S.A.S,\nBrezins, France) was used for effect-site\nTCI of the microemulsion propofol.\nThe pharmacokinetic model used to calcu-\nlate target effect-site concentration (Ce)\nfor microemulsion propofol was that of\nBefore patients were transferred into the\noperating room, a 20-gauge venous cannula\nwas placed in a vein of the forearm. No\npremedication was given before the admin-\nistration of anaesthesia. On arrival in the\noperating room, patients underwent basic\nmonitoring including electrocardiogram,\npulse oximetry and noninvasive blood pres-\nsure measurement. After venous occlusion\nwas applied with a rubber tourniquet, the\nallocated dose of lidocaine was injected. The\ntourniquet was released after 1 min and\nmicroemulsion propofol was administered\nthrough the same venous cannula to achieve\na target Ce of 5.2 mg/ml at a maximum flow\nrate of 750 ml/h, which represented a bolus\n(the mean weight of the study patients)\napproximating to an infusion rate of\n2 mg/kg per min.\nStudy assessments\nPain was assessed by H.S.C., who was\nblind to the pretreatment lidocaine dose,\nfrom the start of the microemulsion pro-\npofol injection to the point of loss of\nconsciousness. The severity of pain was\ngraded on a four-point scale:15 `severe\npain' was manifest as a verbal response\naccompanied by facial grimacing or with-\ndrawal of the arm; `moderate pain' was\ndefined as grimacing or arm withdrawal\nnot accompanied by a verbal response;\n`mild pain' was recorded if after 30 s the\npatient had not experienced moderate or\nsevere pain but reported discomfort in the\narms when questioned; `no pain' was rec-\norded if the patient did not report arm\ndiscomfort when questioned.\nAfter loss of consciousness, anaesthetic\nmanagement was left to the discretion of the\nattending anaesthesiologist. All patients\nwere evaluated in the postanaesthesia care\nunit following surgery for abnormal injec-\ntion-site responses including erythema, phle-\nbitis, oedema and pain.\nStatistical analyses\nBased on preliminary unpublished data\nregarding the incidence of injection-site\npain obtained at Ajou University Hospital,\na total sample of 65 patients was determined\nto be sufficient to achieve 90% power to\ndetect differences with a type I error of 0.05\n(two-tailed) and a type II error of 0.10.\nBased on this assumption, a minimum of 22\npatients per treatment group was required.\nAssuming some patients would drop-out of\nthe study, the sample size was increased to\n23 patients per group.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 statistical software, version 11.0\n(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Data are expressed as\nmean \u00c6 SD or number (%) of patients.\nPatient characteristics were compared\nusing one-way analysis of variance or\n2-test, as appropriate. Differences in pain\ngrades between groups were analysed using\nKruskal\u00adWallis test or 2-test. Post hoc\ncomparisons were performed using Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U-test with Bonferroni's correc-\ntion. Results were considered statistically\nsignificant when the P-value was < 0.05.\nResults\nIn total, 69 patients undergoing elective\nsurgery were included in the study. One\npatient in group L40 was excluded from the\nanalyses because of concealed leakage\nbetween the line for fluid and the intraven-\nous catheter (Figure 1). Demographic data\nfor all patients included in the analyses are\npresented in Table 1; there were no signifi-\ncant differences between the three groups.\nTable 1.

There was no evidence of\nclinical symptoms or signs related to sys-\ntemic toxicity of lidocaine in any patient. No\npatients experienced any pain or abnormal\ninjection-site reactions postsurgery.\nDiscussion\nThe present study demonstrated that pre-\nwith venous occlusion significantly reduced\nthe incidence and severity of pain following\ninjection of microemulsion propofol com-\npared with 40 mg lidocaine. No significant\ndifference was observed in intensity or inci-\ndence of pain between patients in group L60\nand patients in group L80. This finding\nimplies that 60 mg lidocaine may be the\noptimal dose for reducing pain following\ninjection of microemulsion propofol.\nMicroemulsion propofol was developed\nas an alternative to lipid emulsion propofol,\nwhich is associated with problems such as\npulmonary embolism,16,17 bacterial infec-\ntion,18,19 hypertriglyceridaemia and pan-\ncreatitis.8,20 The first microemulsion\npropofol formulation was composed of 1%\n(Solutol\u00d5 HS 15; BASF, Seoul, Korea) and\n5% tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethylene\nglycol ether (Glycofurol; Roche, Basel,\nSwitzerland), and demonstrated effects bioe-\nquivalent to lipid emulsion propofol.2 As a\nconsequence of toxicities such as drug erup-\ntion, urticaria, fever and dizziness, increased\ntotal bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase,\nand chest discomfort, microemulsion pro-\npofol has been reformulated and now\nTable 2.

Published\nresearch has demonstrated that 81.9% of\npatients experienced moderate to severe\ninjection pain after microemulsion propofol\nadministration, with an average visual ana-\nlogue scale score (VAS; 0 mm, no pain,\nIn another study, the incidence of injection\npain (defined as VAS > 30 mm) following\nmicroemulsion propofol administration was\nreported to be 69.7% with a median VAS\nAmong the various methods proposed to\ndecrease injection pain, lidocaine pretreat-\nment with venous occlusion is one of the\nor 0.5 mg/kg lidocaine with venous occlu-\nsion of the upper limb is recommended for\nalleviating injection pain associated with\nlipid emulsion propofol administration.10,12\nUsing this strategy, the overall incidence of\npain on lipid emulsion propofol injection\nhas been reported to range from 8% to 42%,\nwhile the incidence of moderate to severe\npresent study, the overall incidence of injec-\ntion pain following microemulsion propofol\nadministration in patients in group L40 was\n77.3% and the incidence of moderate to\nsevere injection pain was 63.6%, which is\ncomparable to previous data.13 These find-\nings suggest that pretreatment with 40 mg\nlidocaine in the clinical setting is insufficient\nto prevent injection pain following micro-\nemulsion propofol. The present study also\nevaluated 60 mg and 80 mg lidocaine pre-\ntreatment. These doses were selected after\nconsideration of the established range of\nlidocaine doses used in the treatment or\nprophylaxis of ventricular arrhythmias29\nand by excluding patients weighing <55 kg\nsuch that the maximum dose of lidocaine\nused in the present study was <1.5 mg/kg.\nPotential mechanisms of injection pain\nfollowing propofol have been proposed,\nincluding triggering of the local kallikrein\u00ad\nkinin cascade,30 stimulation by direct con-\ntact between aqueous phase propofol and\nfree nerve endings in the inner venous wall,30\nor the pH and concentration of propo-\nlidocaine reduces propofol-induced pain\nremains unclear. It is possible that lidocaine\npretreatment in the present study may have\ninduced bradykinin generation associated\nwith activation of the plasma kallikrein\u00ad\nkinin system. Previous studies have,\nhowever, reported no evidence that the\ngeneration of bradykinin through activation\nof the plasma kallikrein\u00adkinin system was\nassociated with propofol-induced pain.9\nVenous occlusion, as employed in the pre-\nsent study, may have blocked the nerve\nfibres that are responsible for transmission\nof pain resulting from direct irritation of the\ninner blood vessel walls by propofol. This\ndirect anaesthetic effect of lidocaine is\nachieved when the dose is adequate and\nsufficient time for the drug to work is\nallowed: in previously published studies,\nhigher doses of lidocaine have generally\nbeen more effective than lower doses,32\nalthough it has been reported in a systematic\nreview of the literature that there is no\nobvious dose\u00adresponse relationship within\nresults of the present study demonstrate that\na lidocaine dose of at least 60 mg with\nvenous occlusion is required to reduce injec-\ntion pain following microemulsion propofol.\nMicroemulsion propofol was still found to\ncause moderate to severe pain, even after\npretreatment with 60 mg or 80 mg lidocaine.\nThis is probably because microemulsion\npropofol and lidocaine do not exert their\neffects on the same pain pathway, because\nthere was an insufficient time interval\nbetween lidocaine administration and\nrelease of the tourniquet, or insufficient\npressure was generated by venous occlusion.\nIn conclusion, the present study demon-\nstrated that prior administration of 60 mg or\n80 mg of lidocaine with venous occlusion\nwas more effective for reducing pain follow-\ning injection of microemulsion propofol\nthan 40 mg lidocaine. No further reductions\nin the incidence or severity of pain were\nobserved with 80 mg lidocaine compared\nwith the 60 mg dose.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
