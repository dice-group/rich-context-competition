Lachman*, Stefan Agrigoroaei\nPsychology Department, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States of America\n Introduction\nAlthough recent trends in the United States show improvements\nin functional health [1,2], increased levels of disability remain a\nmajor public health problem [3\u00ad6], especially in later life. Those\nadults with health risk factors such as being overweight [7,8],\nsmoking [9], and having alcohol problems [10], as well as those\nwith chronic health conditions [11] are more likely to have poor\nfunctional health [12]. A number of socio-demographic variables\nalso are related to functional health [13] including sex [14,15],\nrace [16\u00ad18] and socioeconomic status (e.g., educational attain-\nment) [17,19]. Yet, there is evidence that physical limitations and\ndisability at all ages can be reduced with modifiable lifestyle\nfactors, both by avoiding risk factors [20] and engaging in health-\npromoting or protective behaviors [21].\nWhereas most studies have concentrated on identifying risk\nfactors [22] for negative outcomes such as mortality and\nmorbidity, another approach is to examine the effects of health-\npromoting factors for maintaining good health, that is focusing on\nwhat to do rather than what not to do. This positive approach has\nbeen found to be more effective in behavior change for health\npromotion [23]. There is increasing evidence that specific\npsychological, social, and physical protective factors are associated\nwith better health in later life [24\u00ad27]. Among these factors,\nidentified as predictors of functional health. Moreover, a variety\nof studies have shown that control beliefs [44], social support\n[45,46] and physical exercise [47] are modifiable and thus can be\nsubject to interventions to reduce disability and improve functional\nhealth.\nControl beliefs involve the perception that one can influence\nwhat happens in one's life and to what extent one's actions can\nbring about desired outcomes such as good health. It includes\nbeliefs or expectations about one's abilities and perceptions about\nexternal constraints [48]. Stronger beliefs about control over\noutcomes are associated with better reported health, fewer and less\nsevere symptoms, faster recovery from illness, and higher\nfunctional status [49\u00ad52]. Control beliefs show a pattern of decline\nin adulthood, making older adults more vulnerable in terms of\nexpectancies about their ability to affect their health [48]. The\nsense of control is related to functional health, in part, because\nthose who have a higher sense of control are more likely to engage\nin health-promoting behaviors, such as exercising and eating a\nhealthier diet [53].\nSocial interactions involve a combination of supportive and\nstressful experiences. High quality social relationships are those in\nwhich support is relatively high and strain relatively low. Social\nsupport is associated with health in that those who are socially\nembedded and experience positive relationships are better off than\nthose who are isolated or involved in strained or stressful\nrelationships [34,37]. There is also longitudinal evidence for the\nrelationship between positive social exchanges and patterns of\nphysical disability [35], and socially vulnerable elderly are more\nlikely to show disability, frailty, and higher mortality risk [54,55].\nThe mechanisms that have been considered include physiological\nfactors such as stress hormones, immune functioning, and\ninflammatory processes that may be exacerbated for those with\nlow social support or social isolation [33,54]. Moreover, those who\nhave supportive relationships are more likely to reap the benefits of\na more active, engaged and healthy lifestyle [36].\nThe benefits of physical exercise for health are widely\nare likely to reduce or avoid disability due to the positive effects on,\nfor example, cardiovascular and pulmonary functioning, bone\ndensity, and muscle mass [57]. Nevertheless, exercise maintenance\nis challenging and the long term benefits of exercise interventions\nhave not been conclusively demonstrated.\nThe benefits of these factors for health have been considered\nseparately in past studies, rather than considered together to\nexamine their unique or combined effects, as we do in the present\nstudy. Another key contribution of the current study is to examine\nthe protective contribution of psychological, social, and physical\nfactors to functional health in conjunction with physical risk factors\nand health status. In a recent study, multiple risk factors were\nconsidered individually and in combination in relation to mortality\n[22,58,59]. They found the benefits of a combined measure in that\nthe more of the risk factors present, the greater the mortality risk.\nHowever, that study and others focus on the factors that should be\navoided, and whether having these factors results in bad outcomes.\nIn contrast, the goal of the present study was to consider the\nhealth-promoting role of engaging in psychosocial and behavioral\nfactors and their effects for minimizing declines in functional\nhealth. Moreover, we provided a conservative test because we\ncontrolled for the effects of health status and traditional physical\nrisk factors to determine if the protective composite would make a\ndifference beyond the factors that many studies have shown to\nhave detrimental effects on health. Thus, the goal of the present\nstudy was to examine the combined contribution of the health-\npromoting variables to long-term changes in health, and to\nconsider their possible protective effect in minimizing aging-\nrelated declines in functional health, beyond the role of socio-\ndemographic and physical risk factors.\nPsychological, social, and physical protective factors have\ntypically been examined in separate studies. More recently,\nhowever, there has been an emphasis on the contribution of\nmultiple factors in relation to health. For example, Kvaavik et al.\nbehaviors in which one person engages, such as smoking, heavy\ndrinking, unhealthy nutrition, and lack of physical activity, was\nassociated with a higher mortality rate. According to Kvaavik et al.\nthese behaviors, it is necessary to examine both their individual\nand combined impact on health outcomes.'' The procedure of\naggregating different sources of influence stems from the\nobservation that health-related lifestyle factors are not randomly\ndistributed in the general population, but that they tend to occur\nin combination with each other within individuals [60]. Other\nexamples of this multidimensional approach include computing a\ncardiovascular risk [61] index or marker of allostatic load [62],\nwhich include multiple health indicators and predict disease better\nthan individual indicators. Our goal was to consider the role of\nmultiple factors for maintenance of functional health in middle\nand older age. Only a modest literature has addressed the\nrelationship between protective psychosocial and behavioral\nof no studies showing their combined effects.\nWe predicted that, in combination, the protective factors would\nbe associated with functional health over a 10 year period, after\ncontrolling for relevant socio-demographic variables, health status,\nand physical risk factors. We expected that the more of the\npsychosocial and behavioral factors present at Time 1, the better\nthe maintenance of functional health. We also expected to find\nevidence for the individual, unique effects of a strong sense of\ncontrol over life outcomes, high quality of social relationships with\nfriends and family, and frequent vigorous physical exercise on\nfunctional health. Previous research has shown that age differences\nin disability are attenuated by physical exercise [39]. Thus, in the\npresent study we also predicted that the protective factor would\nserve as a moderator of age differences in functional health. We\nexpected that functional declines would be greater for older adults\nthan for the middle-aged and younger adults, and we examined\nwhether the protective effects would be most beneficial for the\nolder adults. Furthermore, we tested if change in the number of\nprotective factors over time predicted change in functional health\nwhile controlling the number of factors at Time 1.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics Statement\nEthical approval was obtained from the Social and Behavioral\nScience Institutional Review Board at University of Wisconsin-\nMadison and by the Committee for Protection of Human Subjects\nat Brandeis University. All participants gave verbal consent, which\nincluded assurance of voluntary participation and confidentiality\nof data. The ethics committees approved the waiver of written\nconsent. Such passive consent is customary for survey research by\ntelephone and mail questionnaire.\nSample\nParticipants were from the Midlife in the United States\ndesigned to investigate the role of behavioral, social, psychological,\nbiological, and neurological factors in understanding physical and\nmental health as people age.\nA national sample (N = 4,238) from the 48 contiguous states was\nselected using random-digit dialing (RDD) of telephone numbers\nwith age and sex information about the household composition,\nwith an overall response rate of 70% for the telephone interview\n[67]. The study also included siblings (N = 949) of the main\nrespondents, randomly selected from the RDD sample, as well as a\nsubpopulation of twins (N = 1,913) obtained after screening a\nPromoting Functional Health\nrepresentative national sample of approximately 50,000 house-\nretention rate, adjusted for mortality, was 75% (N = 4,955), with\ntypically found, those who participated at the second wave showed\npositive selection (Table S1) on most variables compared with\nthose who dropped out of the study. For more information on the\nsample see Radler and Ryff (2010) [68]. When we compared those\nwith complete data who were included in the present analyses\n(N = 3,626) with those excluded, we found the same pattern of\npositive selection (Table 1).\nMeasures\nFunctional Health. This measure was based on seven items\nfrom the Physical Functioning subscale from the SF-36 Health\nSurvey (a reliability = .90 at Time 1; a reliability = .92 at Time 2)\n[69]. Three items from the original scale were omitted: one item\nbecause it was not measured at Time 1 and the two others because\nthey directly referred to physical exercise, one of our predictors.\nThe seven items, which capture the extent to which the\nparticipants' health level limits them in doing different activities\n(e.g., lifting or carrying groceries, climbing several flights of stairs),\nwere averaged. The same items were used at both times of\nmeasurement. The scores ranging from 1 (a lot) to 4 (not at all)\nwere transformed so that the lowest possible score was 0 and the\nhighest possible score 100 [70]. A higher score indicates better\nhealth.\nProtective Factors. We examined three factors from the\npsychological, social and physical domains.\nControl beliefs at Time 1 and Time 2 were assessed with a 12-item\ncomposite (a reliability Time 1 = .85; Time 2 = .87). This measure\nof perceived control over outcomes in life was computed by\naveraging scores on two subscales from the MIDUS sense of\ncontrol scale [29], namely personal mastery (e.g., I can do just\nabout anything I really set my mind to) and perceived constraints\n(e.g., What happens in my life is often beyond my control). The\nscores range from 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree) and\nwere reverse coded for personal mastery. A higher value indicates\nhigher sense of control.\nFor quality of social support, we included items reflecting social\nsupport and reverse coded items for social strain for close\nrelationships. This measure (a reliability Time 1 = .87; Time\n2 = .88) was the average of the ratings on 12 items assessing\nsocioemotional aspects of social support (e.g., How much do\nmembers of your family really care about you) and 12 items\nassessing the social strain (e.g., How often do members of your\nfamily make too many demands on you) that the participants\nexperienced in their relationships with family, friends, and spouse/\npartner [37,71]. The scores range from 1 (never) to 4 (often), with\na higher value indicating greater quality of social support.\nFor physical exercise, participants reported the frequency of\nengaging in vigorous physical activities (e.g., running or lifting\nheavy objects) to work up a sweat, during the summer and winter\nmonths at Time 1 [39]. The total physical exercise score\nthroughout the year was the mean of summer and winter ratings,\nwhich ranged from 1 (never) to 6 (several times a week or more).\nAt Time 2, six questions assessing the participant's frequency of\nvigorous physical exercise were used. These questions referred to\nfrequency of physical activities separately for the summer and\nwinter months, in three different settings (i.e., home, work, and\nleisure), with ratings from 1 (never) to 6 (several times a week). We\ncomputed the mean across summer and winter in all three settings\nand we selected the exercise intensity and setting with the\nmaximum value to represent the highest frequency of physical\nactivity across all domains. At both occasions, higher scores\nindicate more frequent physical exercise.\nTo compute the protective composite at Time 1 and Time 2, for\neach factor we assigned the participants a score of 0 (below the\nmedian) or 1 (equal to or above the median) for control beliefs\nobtained by summing the 3 assigned scores. The total scores\nranged from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating a greater number\nof factors present at the higher, more desirable level. For\ncomparative purposes, an alternative method was used to compute\nthe composite. In this case we computed z-scores for each of the\nthree factors and summed them to create a continuous linear\ncomposite score, as recommended for examining sensitivity in\nTable 1.

The results using this\napproach (Table S2) were consistent with the median split\ncomposite results. For ease of presentation and interpretation,\nwe used the median split method for the analyses presented here.\nSocio-demographic Variables. We examined age, sex (21 =\nmen, 1 = women), highest level of education in years (ranging from\n6 to 20 years), and self-assessed race (21 = non Hispanic white,\n1 = all others).\nHealth Status. This measure taken at Time 1 assessed how\nmany of the following conditions the participants reported ever\nhaving: diabetes, stroke, lupus, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis,\nepilepsy or other neurological disorders, cancer, or heart trouble\n(e.g., heart attack). Participants were assigned a score of 1 for any\nof the chronic conditions. The final score could range from 0 to 7.\nPhysical Risk Factors. The waist circumference, a good\nindicator of obesity that is linked to disability [73], was\nmeasured in inches, at the level of the navel, by the participant\nat Time 1. For the data analysis, this variable was standardized\nSD = 5.71). For smoking, participants were asked if they smoke\ncigarettes regularly now (at Time 1, 21 = no, 1 = yes). For alcohol or\ndrug problems, participants reported at Time 1 if they have\nexperienced or have been treated for alcohol or drug problems\nData Analysis\nFor the analyses, we included the participants (N = 3,626) who\ncompleted all the measures of interest: the protective factors and\nthe covariates at Time 1 and functional health at both occasions.\nWe used hierarchical multiple regression to examine to what\nextent the individual protective factors and all possible combina-\ntions at Time 1 are associated with change in functional health\nover the 8 to 10 years, and whether the association with age is\nmoderated by the number of protective factors. Although there is\nmuch discussion about the best ways to examine change, the\nresidualized change method we used, in which we predicted Time\n2 while controlling for the level of health at Time 1, is the most\nstraightforward and widely accepted approach with two occasions\nof measurement [74]. The regression models also adjusted for the\neffects of socio-demographic variables, health status, and the\nphysical risk factors. For testing whether change in the number of\nprotective factors over time was related to change in health, we\nused the difference between the two protective composites (Time 2\nlevel minus Time 1 level) as a predictor, while adjusting for the\ncomposite score at Time 1, functional health at Time 1, and\ncovariates. For this analysis, we included the participants with\ncomplete longitudinal data on all measures including the three\nprotective factors at both time points (N = 3,578). We also\nexamined a model in which change in the protective factor was\nconverted to a categorical variable (i.e., decrease, stable, increase),\ncontrolling for time 1 level, and we found the same results.\nAs our sample also included siblings of the main respondents\nand a subpopulation of twins, we also ran models using the cluster\noption in STATA [75]. This model takes dependencies into\naccount using robust standard errors by clustering at the family\nlevel. We found the same results with this more conservative\napproach. We report the results for both the standard and\nclustered models in Table 2.\nResults\nThe means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations for all\nvariables are presented in Table S3.

Higher\ncontrol beliefs, greater social support, and more frequent physical\nexercise at Time 1 were associated with better functional health at\nboth occasions of measurement, respectively, [Time 1: r(3576) =\np,.001]. The same relationships with health were obtained with all\nvariables measured at Time 2, between functional health and\nFirst, we tested a model including all three dichotomous\nprotective factors at Time 1 (low/high levels).

The similar values of the standardized regression\ncoefficients provide a rationale for computing the composite with\nequal weights for each protective factor.\nTo test our main hypotheses, we conducted hierarchical\nmultiple regression to examine predictors of residualized change\nin functional health, with and without using the robust standard\nerrors (Table 2). The dependent variable was Time 2 functional\nhealth, and at the first step we controlled for Time 1 functional\nhealth, socio-demographic predictors, and health status; all were\nstatistically significant and accounted for 41% of the variance [F(6,\nwas associated with greater decline in functional health.

Moreover, all the individual protective factors\nexplained a significant percent of variance, over and above the role\nPromoting Functional Health\nTable 2.

On average, functional health declined\nsignificantly over the 8 to 10 years and, as expected, the declines\nwere greatest in later life. Yet, those who engaged in multiple\nfactors were protected in that they showed better maintenance of\nfunctional health. Whereas previous research has typically\nexamined one of these factors at a time {e.g., [54,56]}, we found\nthat each of the factors had a unique independent contribution,\nwith or without adjusting for the other factors. Moreover, the\nresults show evidence for the additive value of these factors, and\nthe more of them the better in terms of health outcomes. Although\nthe psychosocial and behavioral factors were beneficial for health\nat all ages, a key promising finding is that age differences in\nfunctional health were significantly attenuated and health declines\nFigure 1. The Estimated Means for Residual Change in Functional Health as a Function of the Number of Time 1 Protective Factors,\nAdjusted for Socio-demographics, Health Status, Physical Risk Factors, and Functional Health at Time 1, Derived from an ANCOVA\nFigure 2. The Predicted Values for Residual Change in\nFunctional Health by Age at Time 2 and Number of Protective\nFactors at Time 1, Adjusted for Socio-demographics, Health\nStatus, Physical Risk Factors, and Functional Health at Time 1;\nPromoting Functional Health\nwere reduced as a function of the number of protective factors\npresent at adaptive levels 8 to 10 years earlier. This is consistent\nwith previous findings on the potential of protective factors such as\nphysical exercise to reduce age differences in functional health\n[39]. The protective factors were found to have a differentially\nbeneficial effect at the oldest ages that is, among those who are\nmost at risk and vulnerable to functional declines. Among older\nadults who had all 3 protective factors at adaptive levels, their\nfunctional health was more comparable with the level of those in\nthe younger and middle-aged groups. The relationship between\nprotective factors at Time 1 and functional health at Time 2 is\nsignificant when controlling for Time 1 functional health,\nillustrating that the effects are related to long term maintenance\nor change in health, independent of initial level of health.\nMoreover, engaging in more protective factors over time was\npositively related to functional health, independent of the number\nof behaviors people adopted earlier in life.\nSome limitations of the study should be noted, especially the\nrestricted measurement of some variables (e.g., smoking, alcohol\nand drug problems, physical exercise). We used self-report\nassessments for all variables, and the relationships could be\naffected by a common measurement bias. Nevertheless, the\npsychosocial variables are typically measured using self report,\ngiven the focus on perceptions and expectancies. Moreover, the\nfunctional health measure has been well validated in relation to\nobjective indicators of disability in previous work [76]. In the case\nof both health and exercise, more objective measures (e.g.,\npedometers for physical exercise) may be examined in future\nstudies. Also, the generalizability of findings must be considered in\nlight of the positive selection of the longitudinal sample, although\nthe large probability base for the sample is an asset. Although the\npresent study design with two waves of measurement enabled us to\nexamine changes in health and protective factors, including three\nor more occasions will allow for consideration of the multi-\ndirectionality and consistency of these patterns using more\nsophisticated analytic models [77].\nThe study shows the importance of considering long-term\npredictors of functional health, with a goal of reducing disability,\nimproving quality of life, and reducing health care costs. Some\ngroups may be more susceptible to health problems and less likely\nto engage in the protective factors, such as those who are older or\nthose with lower socioeconomic status (SES) [24]. Acknowledging\nthese vulnerabilities could lead to targeted interventions to reduce\nage and SES differences in health. The lifestyle factors in midlife\n(e.g., the 50's) showed a protective effect for health in later life\n(e.g., the 60's) [78] and the more of them the better. The\npromising findings raise possibilities of examining the joint effects\nof other psychosocial and behavioral factors such as stress\nreactivity and regulation [79], spirituality and religious activity\n[80], nutrition and diet [81], and to investigate whether there\nwould be continued value added. Moreover, future work is needed\nto explore the mechanisms {e.g., stress hormones [82], inflam-\nmation [83], allostatic load [84]} that may be involved in linking\nthe protective factors to health.\nThe findings suggest that multifaceted psychosocial and\nbehavioral interventions that target multiple components such as\na sense of control, good quality social relationships with family and\nfriends, and physical exercise in early adulthood and midlife could\nhave a dramatic protective effect in reducing disability and\nmaintaining functional health and independence into later life\n[85], over and above the contribution of reducing physical risk\nmultidimensional interventions may be more effective than ones\nfocused on single dimensions for improving health quality of life.\nAn example is a clinical trial successful in reducing disability\namong sedentary older adults [41,86], by focusing on multiple\nfactors: improving the sense of control over exercise, increasing\nphysical strength with resistance training, and providing social\nsupport from an exercise trainer. This type of multimodal\nintervention is likely to result in higher compliance and better\nmaintenance than studies that rely only on changing physical\nactivity without the psychological mindset and social support\nneeded to promote long-term behavioral changes. Given the\nincreasing expenditures on health care for those over age 65 with\nphysical limitations during the last decade [6], the results are\nencouraging for the prospect of reducing public health expendi-\ntures for physical disability in later life.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Comparison of the Longitudinal Participants and the\nDropouts.\nTable S2 Hierarchical Multiple Regression with Functional\nHealth at Time 2 as Dependent Variable and with Socio-\ndemographics and Time 1 Variables: Functional Health, Health\nStatus, Physical Risk Factors, and Protective Composite (comput-\ned with continuous z-scores) as Predictors.\nTable S3 Means, Standard Deviations, and Intercorrelations for\nall Variables.\nTable S4 Hierarchical Multiple Regression with Functional\nHealth at Time 2 as Dependent Variable and with Socio-\ndemographics and Time 1 Variables: Functional Health, Health\nStatus, Physical Risk Factors, and all Combinations of Protective\nFactors as Predictors.\n"
