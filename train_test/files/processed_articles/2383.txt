    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: This study examined associations between perceived neighborhood illicit drug selling, peer illicit drug\ndisapproval and illicit drug use among a large nationally representative sample of U.S. high school seniors.\nMethods: Data come from Monitoring the Future (2007\u00ad2011), an annual cross-sectional survey of U.S. high school\nseniors. Students reported neighborhood illicit drug selling, friend drug disapproval towards marijuana and cocaine\nuse, and past 12-month and past 30-day illicit drug use (N = 10,050). Multinomial logistic regression models were fit\nto explain use of 1) just marijuana, 2) one illicit drug other than marijuana, and 3) more than one illicit drug other\nthan marijuana, compared to \"no use\".\nResults: Report of neighborhood illicit drug selling was associated with lower friend disapproval of marijuana and\ncocaine; e.g., those who reported seeing neighborhood sales \"almost every day\" were less likely to report their\nfriends strongly disapproved of marijuana (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.49) compared to those\nwho reported never seeing neighborhood drug selling and reported no disapproval. Perception of neighborhood\nillicit drug selling was also associated with past-year drug use and past-month drug use; e.g., those who reported\nseeing neighborhood sales \"almost every day\" were more likely to report 30-day use of more than one illicit drug\nreported no 30-day use of illicit drugs.\nConclusions: Perceived neighborhood drug selling was associated with lower peer disapproval and more illicit\ndrug use among a population-based nationally representative sample of U.S. high school seniors. Policy interventions\nto reduce \"open\" (visible) neighborhood drug selling (e.g., problem-oriented policing and modifications to the physical\nenvironment such as installing and monitoring surveillance cameras) may reduce illicit drug use and peer disapproval\nof illicit drugs.\n",

A rela-\ntively under-explored aspect of risk factors for illicit\ndrug use is one's neighborhood. Social epidemiology re-\nsearch shows that neighborhood environments can play\na significant role in drug use [5,6]. For example, previous\nstudies have examined associations between neighbor-\nhood socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., neighbor-\nhood poverty) and illicit drug use [7-14]. In addition,\nprior research shows that exposure to neighborhood vio-\nlence and crime is associated with illicit drug use [15-17].\nUsing and analyzing aggregate measures of neighborhood\nsocial disorder (including neighborhood drug selling as a\ncomponent), some other studies have found a relationship\nbetween neighborhood social disorder and illicit drug use\nleagues (2014) showed that neighborhood-level drug activ-\nity and social disorder were associated with heroin and\ncocaine craving among drug misusers [21].\nThe use of aggregate measures of neighborhood dis-\norder is described in the sociology and public health lit-\nerature including studies from the Project on Human\nDevelopment in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) [22-26].\nMultidimensional measures of social disorder are based on\nRaudenbush's ecometric theory, i.e., the reliability of a scale\nimproves as you observe multiple indicators, as opposed to\nsingle indicators [27]. In addition, the indicators are often\nclustered with each other and tend to co-occur. PHDCN\nmeasures of social disorder (based on ecometrics) are ap-\nplied to indicators obtained from systematic social ob-\nservation. However, when measuring a single individual's\nevaluation of neighborhood characteristics (as opposed to\nusing systematic social observation) it is may not be\nnecessary to apply aggregate measures of neighbor-\nhood characteristics (e.g. neighborhood disorder) [28].\nIn addition to neighborhood drug selling, aggregate\nmeasures of neighborhood social disorder often in-\nclude the following other components: individuals drink-\ning alcohol in public, individuals using or being addicted\nto drugs, unemployed individuals hanging out in the\nstreets, and prostitutes on the street [22,29].\nWhile informative, the previous research on the role\nof neighborhood factors and illicit drug use has typically\nnot explicitly and specifically examined neighborhood\nillicit drug selling, a potentially important factor in illicit\ndrug use on its own. Neighborhood illicit drug selling is\na distinctive indicator of neighborhood social disorder\nthat may be amenable to policy. We recognize that com-\nposite measures (e.g., of neighborhood social disorder)\ncan be important, but might diminish the importance of\nany one individual component and might be less trans-\nferable to policymakers [30-32] (as studies usually use\nand analyze aggregate measures of neighborhood social\ndisorder--not stratifying by the myriad social disorder\nFurther, while previous research on neighborhood factors\nand illicit drug use has used a variety of methods to\ncategorize neighborhood factors (e.g., survey, geographic in-\nformation systems [GIS]), additional research is needed to\nexamine perceptions of neighborhood characteristics, which\nmay be more closely linked to health and behavior than ob-\njectively measured neighborhood characteristics. It is also\nimportant to note that, based on our review of the accumu-\nlated literature, most previous research on neighborhood\nfactors in illicit drug use has used non-representative local\npopulations, which limits generalizability. We also note that\nneighborhood factors might not only influence illicit drug\nuse, but drug-related attitudes. Previous studies have exam-\nined demographic (e.g., age) and behavioral (e.g., drug use)\ncorrelates of peer drug-related attitudes such as peer illicit\ndrug disapproval [33,34], however, to our knowledge, studies\nhave not examined the effect of neighborhood characteris-\ntics on peer drug-related attitudes and thus represents a\ncritical gap in the literature. Importantly, sociological\nand psychological theories, such as Social Norms The-\nory [35] and the Theory of Planned Behavior [36], sug-\ngest that neighborhood illicit drug selling could be\nassociated with peer illicit drug disapproval. In addition,\ndisapproval and stigmatization towards illicit drug use has\npreviously been shown to be an important correlate of\nillicit drug use [37]. Research on how perceived neigh-\nborhood drug selling relates to both use and (peer) at-\ntitudes towards use would add to the literature as\nthere is a lack of information whether perception of\nneighborhood drug selling is a risk factor for use. Po-\ntential mechanisms linking neighborhood drug selling\nand drug use could be availability of drugs, perceived\nnormality of use, and perhaps pressure from drug\ndealers to use drugs. In addition, neighborhood drug\nselling and concomitant issues (including neighbor-\nhood violence) could be stressful and therefore influence\ndrug use. For example, in the context of neighborhood\nstress, adolescents might use marijuana given its well-\nestablished anxiolytic effects.\nThe primary aim of this study is to examine the asso-\nciation of perceived neighborhood illicit drug selling and\nillicit drug use among a large population-based nation-\nally representative sample of U.S. high school seniors.\nBecause peers (e.g., proportion of school friends using\nillicit drugs) can influence illicit drug use among adoles-\ncents [38,39], we additionally evaluated the association\nof perceived neighborhood illicit drug selling and peer\nillicit drug disapproval among the sample. Based on pre-\nvious theoretical and empirical research, we hypothe-\nsized that perceived neighborhood illicit drug selling\nwould be associated with higher odds for illicit drug use\nand lower peer illicit drug disapproval among our sam-\nple of U.S. high school seniors.\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/9/1/35\nMethods\nData\nMonitoring the Future (MTF) is an annual cross-sectional\nsurvey of high school seniors in approximately 130 public\nand private schools throughout 48 states in the US [40].\nSchools are selected through a multi-stage random sam-\npling procedure: geographic areas are selected, then schools\nwithin areas are selected, and finally students within\nschools are selected. MTF assesses content using six\ndifferent survey forms, which are distributed randomly.\nAll forms assess demographic characteristics and drug\nuse, however, only survey Form 4 assesses perception\nof drug selling in one's neighborhood and friend disap-\nproval towards use of various drugs. To increase power,\nwe combined data from the most recent five cohorts\ncols were reviewed and approved by the University of\nMichigan Institutional Review Board (IRB). We received\nIRB approval to examine data on MTF seniors from New\nYork University School of Medicine.\nNeighborhood illicit drug selling\nStudents were asked, \"During the past 12 months, how\noften have you seen people selling illegal drugs in your\nneighborhood?\" Answer options were: 1) \"Never\", 2) \"A\nfew times a year\", 3) \"Once or twice a month\", 4) \"At\nleast once a week\", and 5) \"Almost every day\". Answers\nwere coded into indicator variables with \"never\" as the\ncomparison.\nPeer illicit drug disapproval\nStudents were asked about their perception of friend dis-\napproval towards trying various illicit drugs, including\nmarijuana and cocaine. To assess disapproval towards\nmarijuana, students were asked: \"How do you think your\nclose friends feel (or would feel) about you trying marijuana\n(pot, weed) once or twice?\" Answer options were: 1) \"Don't\ndisapprove,\" 2) \"Disapprove\" and 3) \"Strongly disapprove.\"\nA similar question was asked with regard to use of cocaine.\nThese two variables were coded into indicators: \"disapprove\"\nand \"strongly disapprove\" and \"don't disapprove\" served as\nthe comparison.\nPast 12-month and past 30-day illicit drug use\nMTF asked students about use of various illicit drugs\nthat occurred within the past 12 months and within the\npast 30 days. Students were asked whether they used\nmarijuana (pot, weed, hashish), and other illicit sub-\nstances including cocaine, crack, LSD, hallucinogens\nother than LSD, heroin, MDMA (ecstasy, \"Molly\") and\nnonmedical use of narcotics (other than heroin), tran-\nquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), sedatives (e.g., barbitu-\nrates) and amphetamine. We then created a new variable\nwith four categories (one for 12 month use and one for\n30 day use): 1) no illicit drug use, 2) only marijuana use, 3)\nuse of one illicit drug other than marijuana, and 4) use of\nmore than one illicit drug other than marijuana. We com-\nbined use of multiple drugs into one category as an indica-\ntor of drug use severity.\nCovariates\nStudents indicated their age (dichotomized by MTF as\n<18 and 18 years), sex (male vs. female), and race/eth-\nnicity (defined by MTF as Black, White and Hispanic).\nMTF classified population density of students' residences\nas non-, small-, or large-metropolitan statistical areas\n(MSAs). Small MSAs are defined as counties or groups\nof counties with at least one city of 50,000 or more in-\nhabitants and the 24 largest MSAs are defined as large\nMSAs [40]. The remaining areas are defined as non-\nMSAs. MTF also assessed level of religious attendance\nand importance through two ordinal items. We created\na mean composite of these two items (range: 1\u00ad4) and\ndivided the scores into tertiles representing low (1.0-2.0),\nwere also asked about level of educational attainment of\neach parent through an ordinal item. We computed a\nmean score for both parents (or raw score if only one\nparent) and this was further coded into three groups\n(4.5-6.0) education. Students were also asked to indicate\nthe number of evenings they usually go out per week for\nfun and recreation. We recoded their responses to the\nand 3) 4\u00ad7 evenings. These covariates were identified a\npriori and coding of covariates was based on previous\nStatistical analyses\nAnalyses focused on MTF senior students with complete\nneighborhood illicit drug selling and peer disapproval data\ntistically significant differences between participants with\ncompleted neighborhood illicit drug selling and peer dis-\napproval data as compared with the entire sample existed.\nHowever, given the large size of the dataset this is not sur-\nprising. Because missing data can be common and prob-\nlematic, we evaluated missingness in the covariates. Since\nsome covariates were missing data (e.g., race/ethnicity\nfor covariates to have missing data in the regression\nmodels. In Table 1, we have included the number of miss-\ning values for each covariate: The range of missing data\nfor our covariates was 0.3% (age) to 23% (religiosity).\nThese data were missing not at random. We entered miss-\ning data indicators to ensure that these cases were not\ndeleted. This method has been used in previous MTF\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/9/1/35\ntiveness of the sample. Only 47.4% of the analytic sam-\nple had case-compete data; therefore, deleting cases\nwith any missing data would have resulted in the list-\nwise deletion of more than half the sample, reducing\npower and it's national representativeness.\nWe examined descriptive statistics (e.g., weighted per-\ncentages) for each covariate and then we fit all variables\ninto multinomial multivariable logistic regression models\nwith the four-category drug use variable as the outcome\n(one model for 12 month use and another model for\n30 day use). The comparison variable for both outcome\nvariables was \"no use.\" These models determined the\nconditional associations of perceived neighborhood drug\nselling and peer drug disapproval while controlling for\nall other covariates. The predictors in the model explain\nuse of 1) just marijuana, 2) one illicit drug other than\nmarijuana, and 3) more than one illicit drug other than\nmarijuana, compared to \"no use,\" similar to multiple\nbinary logistic regressions. This way each predictor is as-\nsociated with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95%\nconfidence interval (CI) for each of the three levels of\nthe outcome variable. We present AORs and CIs for\nperceived neighborhood drug selling and peer disap-\nproval.

Almost 62% of stu-\ndents reporting \"never\" seeing neighborhood drug sales,\nand 15.7% reporting seeing neighborhood drug sales \"a\nfew times per year\". Almost 60% of the sample reported\nthat their friends disapprove of marijuana use, of which\n35.5% reported that their friends \"strongly disapprove\".\nOn the other hand, 90.2% of the sample reported that\ntheir friends disapprove of cocaine use; 72.1% of the\nsample reported that their friends \"strongly disapprove\"\nof cocaine.\nThe majority of the sample reported no past-year illicit\ndrug use and past-month illicit drug use: 9.9% reported\nuse of more than one illicit drug in the past 12 months,\nand 4.1% reported use of more than one illicit drug in\nthe past month. The majority of users of illicit drugs\nother than marijuana also reported used of marijuana\n(data not presented in table). Specifically, for both 12-\nmonth and 30-day users of one illicit drug other than\nuse of marijuana. With regard to use of more than one\nmonth use of marijuana, and with respect to 30-day use\nof more than one other illicit drug, 58.3% also reported\n30-day use of marijuana.\nNeighborhood illicit drug selling and peer illicit drug\ndisapproval\nReport of neighborhood illicit drug selling was associ-\nated with lower friend disapproval of marijuana and co-\ncaine in multivariable models, controlling for socio-\ndemographic factors/ other covariates (Tables 2 and 3).\nFor example, those who reported seeing neighborhood\nsales \"almost every day\" were at lower odds of reporting\nnever seeing neighborhood drug selling and reported no\ndisapproval (Table 2). Similarly, neighborhood illicit drug\nselling was associated with lower friend disapproval of co-\ncaine (Table 3). Those who reported seeing neighborhood\nsales \"almost every day\" were at lower odds of reporting that\nof cocaine compared to those who reported never seeing\nneighborhood drug selling and reported no disapproval, for\nexample. In addition, as shown in Tables 2 and 3, odds for\nstrong friend disapproval towards use of each drug tended\nto be more robust (smaller) than non-strong friend disap-\nproval (\"disapprove\"), when significant. Perceiving drug sell-\ning once or more per week (or almost every day) was\nsignificantly (negatively) associated with friend cocaine dis-\napproval, but almost all levels of perceived selling in one's\nneighborhood were significantly negatively associated with\nfriend marijuana disapproval.\nNeighborhood illicit drug selling and illicit drug use\nThe multivariable associations between neighborhood\nillicit drug selling and past-year drug use are reported in\nTable 4, controlling for socio-demographic factors/other\ncovariates and peer disapproval of illicit drugs. Those\nwho reported seeing neighborhood sales \"almost every\nday\" were more likely to report 12-month use of marijuana\nuse of more than one illicit drug (AOR = 6.19, 95% CI:\nneighborhood drug selling and reported no 12-month use\nof illicit drugs. Those who reported seeing neighborhood\nsales \"almost every day\" were more likely to report 30-day\nseeing neighborhood drug selling (Table 5).

With regard to 12-month use, all levels of per-\nceived neighborhood drug selling tended to be associated\nwith higher odds of only marijuana use than use of only\none other illicit drug; however, odds tended to be much\nhigher for use of multiple other illicit drugs (Table 4). With\nrespect to 30-day use, the more frequent the witnessing of\nneighborhood drug selling, the higher the odds for drug\nuse (Table 5). Odds also increased accordingly for use of\nmore illicit drugs other than marijuana (e.g., frequent ex-\nposure to selling was associated with increased odds of\nonly marijuana use, even higher odds for other illicit drug\nuse, and much higher odds for use of multiple other illicit\ndrugs in the past 30 days) (Tables 4 and 5).\nDiscussion\nAdolescence is an important developmental period for the\ninitiation of illicit drugs [4,55,56]. In this study, among a\npopulation-based nationally representative sample of U.S.\nhigh school seniors, we found that perception of neighbor-\nhood illicit drug selling was associated both with illicit\ndrug use and peer disapproval of illicit drugs. Specifically,\nreport of neighborhood illicit drug selling was associated\nwith lower peer disapproval and more illicit drug use.\nFurthermore, increased frequency of witnessing neighbor-\nhood drug-dealing is associated with \"more severe\" use\n(e.g., more recent use, use of drugs \"harder\" than\nmarijuana and multiple illicit drugs). In addition, we found\nthat increased frequency of witnessing drug selling was as-\nsociated with lower levels of friend disapproval toward use\nof marijuana and cocaine. Disapproval (self-, peer-, and\nperceived societal disapproval) has previously been found\nto be a robust protective factor against drug use\nfrequency of witnessing drug selling in one's neighbor-\nhood is associated with lowered friend disapproval toward\nmarijuana, but much higher frequency of witnessing drug\nselling was needed in order for students to report signifi-\ncantly lower friend disapproval toward cocaine. Marijuana\nis the least stigmatized or disapproved illicit drug and\ncocaine use is more heavily stigmatized [37]. For ex-\nof an adult trying marijuana, but 86.0% of young adults\ndisapprove of an adult trying cocaine [61]. While use\nof a drug is generally associated with decreased disap-\nproval or stigma toward use [34,37], these findings add\nto our understanding in that witnessing drug selling in\none's neighborhood is also associated with decreases in\nfriend drug disapproval.\nTable 4 Association between neighborhood illicit drug selling and illicit drug use in past 12 months\n12-Month use of marijuana\nPerceived neighborhood drug sales\nNote: Comparison is 12-month use of no illicit drugs, N = 6,372.\nTable 5 Association between neighborhood illicit drug selling and no illicit drug use in past 30 days\n30 day use of marijuana\n30 day use of one illicit\nPerceived neighborhood drug\nsales\nNote: Comparison is 30 day use of no illicit drugs, N = 7,803.\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/9/1/35\nOur study adds to the burgeoning literature on the\nrole of the neighborhood social context on illicit drug\nuse among adolescents. By and large, our findings are\nconsistent with existing studies evaluating the role of\nHowever, because aggregate measures of neighborhood\nsocial disorder include other factors such as alcohol use,\ndrug use, drug addiction, and prostitution, it is unclear\nwhether multiple aspects of neighborhood social disorder\nare simultaneously needed to detect significant effects on\nillicit drug use. While multiple aspects of social disorder\nmay contribute to illicit drug use, aggregate measures ob-\nscure the importance of any one particular aspect on illicit\ndrug use. To our knowledge, this is the first study to\nexamine the effect of a neighborhood characteristic on\npeer drug attitudes and thus our study provides a new\ncontribution to the literature.\nThere are a variety of potential explanations for our\nstudy findings. First, neighborhood characteristics such as\nneighborhood drug selling may influence social norms,\nwhich, in turn, may influence perception of drug use and\nabuse and ones use and abuse of drugs [37]. Indeed, it is\npossible that individuals begin to become desensitized to\ndrug use when they frequently witness drug sales. When\ndrug use or drug selling becomes somewhat of a normal-\nized activity in one's view it thus seems that disapproval\ntowards use decreases, leaving individuals at higher risk\nfor drug use. Second, neighborhood drug selling and con-\ncomitant issues (including neighborhood violence) might be\nThird, witnessing drug selling may also be an indicator of\ndrug availability in one's neighborhood, potentially leading\nto use and abuse of drugs. For instance, exposure to users\nand familiarity with users has previously been found to be\nrobust risk factors for drug use [60,64]. Furthermore, neigh-\nborhood drug dealers might pressure purchase of drugs and\ndrug use among adolescents as well as other community\nmembers. Students reporting neighborhood drug selling\nmay be more likely to know the drug dealers, notice selling,\nor even purchase or sell drugs themselves. In addition to\nconfirming findings from our study in other samples, future\nresearch should identify mechanisms through which neigh-\nborhood drug selling might contribute to increases in illicit\ndrug use among adolescents, including the influence of\nneighborhood drug selling on social norms. Future stud-\nies should also examine temporal associations, which\nare needed to more carefully examine the direction of\nassociation.\nFindings from this study may be relevant to practice and\npolicy, including the potential need for neighborhood-\nlevel policy changes. Empirical evidence from the crimin-\nology and public health literature shows that drug-related\ncrime can be decreased by modifying the social and\nphysical neighborhood environment through a variety\nof strategies [65-68]. Policies monitoring illicit drugs\nmay reduce the availability of illicit drugs and therefore\nreduce neighborhood drug selling. For example, local\npolice attention in \"hot spots\" or areas common for neigh-\nborhood drug selling (known as problem-oriented po-\nlicing) may be a useful strategy for reducing \"open\"\n(visible) neighborhood drug selling [65,66,68]. In addition,\nadjustments to the physical environment (e.g., installing\nand monitoring surveillance cameras and landscaping\ntrees and shrubs) might also prove to be beneficial in re-\nducing open neighborhood drug selling [67,68]. It should\nbe noted that even in states where marijuana use is decri-\nminalized, sales and use in \"public view\" are still illegal\n[69]. Our study demonstrates the role of neighborhood\nfactors in shaping drug use among adolescents, and past\nevidence showing the effectiveness neighborhood-oriented\npolicing approaches suggests that neighborhood-level pol-\nicy changes may help reduce illicit drug use among this\npopulation.\nLimitations\nFirst, we recognize that reverse causality is a possibility:\nindividuals who used illicit drugs may report higher rates\nof neighborhood drug sales. As these are cross-sectional\ndata, temporal ambiguity is a concern; longitudinal study\ndesigns are needed to provide evidence of temporal\nordering. Additionally, natural experiments or policy\nchanges (e.g., police efforts targeting neighborhood\ndrug selling) could be evaluated and would provide\nthe strongest evidence for causality. As previously\ndiscussed, neighborhood-level factors can be mea-\nsured in a variety of ways, including objectively via\nsystematic social observation [70]. In this study, only\nself-reported information on one neighborhood factor\n(i.e., neighborhood illicit drug selling) was available to\nus. Therefore, same-source bias (also known as shared-\nobserver bias) might be an issue, as the exposure (per-\nceived neighborhood illicit drug selling) and the outcomes\n(peer attitudes towards illicit drug and illicit drug use)\nwere all assessed via self-report [71,72]. Because self-\nreported drug use information was collected, there\nmight be some misclassification, in part due to social\ndesirability bias. We recognize that we examined per-\nception of one's residential neighborhood, which is only\none neighborhood context. Spatial polygamy asserts that\npeople experience and interact with multiple neighbor-\nhood environments, which can influence their health and\nhealth behavior including drug use behaviors [73,74].\nBecause high school students spend significant amount\nof time at school [75], their school neighborhood en-\nvironment may influence drug use behaviors. While we\ncontrolled for several confounding factors, residual con-\nfounding may also be a concern (e.g., we were unable to\ncontrol for neighborhood poverty, residential stability and\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/9/1/35\nresidential selection because these variables where not in-\ncluded in the survey). Finally, missing data (especially\nligiosity, with data missing not at random) is somewhat\nproblematic. However, to maintain power and representa-\ntiveness we included missing data indicators for covariates\nin all analyses.\nConclusion\nWe found that perceived neighborhood drug selling was\nassociated with lower peer disapproval of illicit drugs and\nmore illicit drug use among a population-based nationally\nrepresentative sample of U.S. high school seniors. Policy\ninterventions to reduce \"open\" (visible) neighborhood\ndrug selling (e.g., problem-oriented policing and modifica-\ntions to the physical environment such as installing and\nmonitoring surveillance cameras) may reduce illicit drug\nuse and peer disapproval of illicit drugs.\nCompeting interest\nThe authors report no competing interest.
