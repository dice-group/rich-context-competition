The highest prevalence of obesity\nand overweight has been observed in black women and girls.\nObesity and hypertension frequently coexist. Within and\nacross populations, blood pressure levels and the prevalence of\nhypertension are related to adiposity. In the INTERSALT study,\nBMI was associated with both systolic and diastolic blood pres\nsure, unrelated to age, alcohol intake and dietary intakes of\nsodium and potassium, as measured by urinary excretion of\nthese electrolytes.6 Possibly related to the increased prevalence\nof obesity, in US adults the prevalence of hypertension increased\nThe present analysis was undertaken to evaluate the hypo\nthesis that the associations of actual blood pressure levels\nwith BMI and other indices of adiposity (waist circumference,\nwaist/hip ratio, waist/height ratio, percent body fat) are simi\nlar throughout the range of normotensive and hypertensive\nblood pressures. African Americans were the primary focus of\nstudy because of the high prevalence of both hypertension and\nobesity in this ethnic group. Additionally, data from NHANES\nparticipants were also analyzed to evaluate the adiposity\u00adblood\npressure relationship in other population groups, including\nnon-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white normotensive\nand untreated hypertensive individuals.\nMethods\nNormotensive and hypertensive African-American volun\nteers were recruited from a variety of community resources\narticles\nRelationship of Blood Pressure to Adiposity\n\n(community blood pressure screenings; radio, TV, and\n\nnewspaper \npresentations) and health providers in Milwaukee.\nAll volunteers identified themselves as black, Negro, or\nAfrican American and reported that both parents were\nAfrican American in origin and had English as their primary\nlanguage. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements\nwere obtained during a single, scheduled outpatient visit.\nHistorical information was obtained about the use of cigarettes\nand menopausal status in women. Following the blood pres\nsure measurement, peripheral venous blood was obtained for\nmeasurement of serum cholesterol concentration. All subjects\nranged in age from 18 to 55 years. Exclusion criteria included\nBMI >36kg/m2, diabetes mellitus, or current pregnancy.\nInformed consent was obtained by study personnel from\nall subjects, and the protocol was approved by the Froedtert\nMemorial Lutheran Hospital/Medical College of Wisconsin\nInstitutional Review Board.\njects were evaluated. Of the hypertensives, 56% were on anti\nhypertensive drug therapy. To eliminate the confounding\ninfluence of antihypertensive medications, among hyperten\nsives, the adiposity\u00adblood pressure relationship was analyzed\nonly in untreated individuals.\nBlood pressure was measured by trained and certified staff\nusing an aneroid sphygmomanometer with an appropriate cuff\nsize for arm girth. After seating the subjects comfortably for\nseveral minutes, two readings were taken in each arm and the\naverage of the arm with the higher measurement was used as\nthe blood pressure reading. Subjects were considered to have\nhypertension if their systolic blood pressure was 140mmHg,\ndiastolic blood pressure was 90mmHg, or if they were taking\nantihypertensive medications.\nAnthropometric measurements included height, weight,\nwaist circumference, and skinfold thickness measured at mul\ntiple sites. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1cm while\nthe subjects were without shoes, using a standardized Holton\nstadiometer. Body weight was measured with a calibrated\nbeam scale to the nearest 0.1kg with subjects wearing only\nlight indoor clothing. Waist circumference was measured\nusing a flexible, inextensible plastic graduated tape with sub\njects in the standing position and was taken at the narrowest\npoint between umbilicus and superior iliac spine. Hip cir\ncumference was measured in a horizontal plane at the level of\nmaximum extension of the buttocks. Subscapular, suprailiac,\nbiceps, triceps, and skinfold thicknesses were measured with\na standard protocol using a Lange skinfold caliper. All circum\nferences and skinfolds were measured three times and aver\naged. Based on skinfold measurements, percent total body fat\nwas calculated with gender-specific formulas using the Durnin\nand Womersley equation.8 Serum cholesterol was measured\nspectrophotometrically.\nThe relationship between anthropometric indices and\nblood pressure levels was also analyzed using data collected\nNational Center for Health Statistics, the continuous NHANES\nuses a complex, stratified, multistage probability cluster \nsample\ndesign.9,10 Selected subgroups, including non-Hispanic blacks,\nare oversampled to improve the reliability of statistical esti\nmates. The NHANES sample was limited to non-Hispanic\nblack or non-Hispanic white persons who had a physical exam\nwith a valid blood pressure measurement, were not pregnant\nat the time of the exam, and were not taking antihypertensive\nmedications. To match the demographics of the Milwaukee\nAfrican-American subjects, the NHANES sample was fur\nther limited to participants aged 31\u00ad55 years. As a result, the\nunweighted NHANES sample size included 3,090 persons.\nAnalyses were performed using appropriate survey estimation\ncommands in STATA v. 9 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).\nResults are presented as mean \u00b1 s.e. Two-way analysis of\nvariance was carried out to determine the significance of dif\nferences of variables, adjusting for sex and blood pressure\nstatus (hypertensive vs. normotensive). Correlations between\nblood pressure and anthropometric variables were evalu\nated with either Pearson's correlation coefficient for normally\ndistributed variables (before or after log transformation) or\nSpearman's correlation coefficient for variables that were not\nnormally distributed. These correlations were adjusted for\nage and sex, and in additional analyses, the correlations were\nadjusted for age, sex, and reported cigarette smoking status. A\nstepwise multivariate regression analysis was used to identify\nthe best anthropometric predictors of blood pressure. Because\nthe various anthropometric indices were correlated with each\nother, the multivariate analysis started with the most signifi\ncant correlate of blood pressure, and only those other indices\nthat added to the predictability of blood pressure were allowed\nto enter the model. Analysis of variance was used to test the\nstatistical significance of mean differences between gender\nand blood pressure (normotensive vs. hypertensive subjects)\ngroups, and the significance of differences between percent\nages was evaluated with the Chi square test. The significance of\ntrends across blood pressure quartiles was examined with one-\nway analysis of variance, using the bootstrap correction.\nResults\nwere evaluated. In the Milwaukee African-American sub\njects, height, weight, and waist/hip ratio were greater in males\nthan in females (P < 0.0001), whereas BMI, percent body fat,\nand waist/height ratio were greater (P < 0.0001) in females\n(Table 1). There were no gender differences in waist circum\nference. All indices of body size (except height) and adiposity\nwere greater in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects\ntensives were taking lipid lowering medications (P < 0.0001).\nExcluding these subjects, mean serum cholesterol concentra\ntion was higher in the hypertensives (P < 0.0001).\nOf the hypertensives, 56% were on antihypertensive drug\ntherapy. To eliminate the confounding influence of antihy\npertensive medications, among hypertensives, the adiposity\u00ad\nblood pressure relationship was analyzed only in untreated\nindividuals. Overall, combining normotensive and untreated\nhypertensive subjects (Table 2), systolic and diastolic blood\narticles Relationship of Blood Pressure to Adiposity\npressures were highly correlated (adjusted for age and sex)\nwith BMI, waist circumference, waist/hip, waist/height, and\npercent body fat (P < 0.0001 for each). Excluding subjects\ntaking lipid lowering medications, the blood pressure read\nings were also significantly correlated with serum cholesterol\n(P < 0.001). Based on a multivariate analysis including all\nanthropometric measures of adiposity as independent vari\nables in the model, taken together, all indices of adiposity\naccounted for 4.1% of the variation in systolic blood pres\npressure (P < 0.0001). In a stepwise regression analysis, only\nthe waist/hip ratio and the waist/height ratio remained in the\nmodel for systolic blood pressure; waist/hip ratio and waist\ncircumference remained in the model for diastolic blood\npressure. The waist/hip ratio accounted for 3.6% of the vari\nvariation of diastolic blood \nheight ratio accounted for less than 1% of the variation of\nsystolic blood pressure and waist circumference accounted\nfor less than 1% of the variation of diastolic blood pressure\nAmong only the normotensive subjects, there were again\nconsistent and highly significant correlations of both systo\nlic and diastolic blood pressure with each of the measured\nanthropometric traits and with serum cholesterol (Table 2).\nTaken together, all indices of adiposity accounted for 4.5% of\nof the variation of diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.0001). In a\nstepwise regression analysis, only waist circumference and\npercent body fat remained in the model for both systolic and\ndiastolic blood pressure. Waist circumference accounted for\nand 2.6% of the variation of diastolic blood pressure (P <\n0.0001); percent body fat also contributed to a smaller extent\nto the variability of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure\nhypertensive subjects, there were only a limited number of\nmarginally significant correlations between blood pressure\nand the measured anthropometric traits, and none of the\nanthropometric measures significantly contributed to the\nvariation in blood pressure. Blood pressure was also not cor\nrelated with serum cholesterol in hypertensive subjects. With\nthe sample size of 889 untreated hypertensive subjects, there\nto detect a correlation of 0.15 or greater. Consequently, it is\nunlikely that these analyses failed to detect a meaningful cor\nrelation in the hypertensive subjects.\nTable 1 | Mean (\u00b1 s.e.) anthropometric characteristics of normotensive and hypertensive Milwaukee African Americans,\nby gender\nNormotensives (NT) Hypertensives (HT) P value\nBMI, body mass index; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\naBlood pressure (BP) values exclude hypertensive subjects on antihypertensive drug therapy. bSerum cholesterol concentrations exclude subjects on lipid lowering medications.\nTable2|Correlationcoefficients(r)ofsystolic(SBP)anddiastolic\n(DBP) blood pressures with anthropometric indices and serum\ncholesterol, adjusted for age and sex, in normotensive (n =\nAmericans,combinedandseparatelybybloodpressuregroup\nNormotensives +\nHypertensives\nNormotensives\nonly\nHypertensives\nonly\nBMI, body mass index.\narticles\nRelationship of Blood Pressure to Adiposity\nThe differential associations of blood pressure with adipo\nsity between normotensive and hypertensive subjects were\nnot affected by gender, menopausal status (24% of women\nreported being postmenopausal), or smoking history. When\ndata for women and men were analyzed separately, similar to\nthe analysis in Table 2, within each gender there were highly\nsignificant correlations between blood pressure and each of\nthe anthropometric indices in normotensive, but not in hyper\ntensive subjects. Sixty one percent of normotensive and 66%\nof hypertensive subjects reported a positive cigarette smoking\nhistory (P = 0.064). Overall, all indices of adiposity were lower\nin smokers than in non-smokers (P < 0.0001). Further statisti\ncal adjustment for smoking history did not alter the correla\ntions of blood pressure with indices of adiposity or with serum\ncholesterol concentration.\nTo further evaluate the relationships between blood pres\nsure and body size, the combined sample of normotensive\nand untreated hypertensive subjects was divided into quar\ntiles based on their systolic blood pressure readings. Table 3\npresents the mean and median (and interquartile ranges)\nblood pressure readings, the actual blood pressure ranges, and\nthe mean values for the anthropometric indices for each of the\nsystolic blood pressures quartiles. BMI, waist circumference,\nwaist/hip ratio, and waist/height ratio all increased signifi\ncantly across the blood pressure quartiles (P < 0.0001). Both\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly cor\nrelated with each of the anthropometric indices in the \nlowest\nblood pressure quartile (Table 4). In contrast, there were no\nsignificant correlations of systolic blood pressure with any of\nthe anthropometric measures in the three upper quartiles.\nDiastolic blood pressure was also not correlated with the indi\nces of body size except for marginally significant correlations\nwith waist circumference in the third and fourth quartiles.\nNotably, the range of blood pressure values was not con\nstricted in the upper quartiles. Indeed, the largest blood pres\nsure range was observed in the highest blood pressure quartile.\nConsequently, the absence of correlation between blood pres\nsure and anthropometric traits in the hypertensive subjects,\ncannot be not accounted for by constricted blood pressure\nranges in the upper blood pressure quartiles.\nAmong NHANES participants, weight, BMI, waist circum\nference, and waist/height ratio were all greater (P < 0.0005)\nTable 3 | Mean and median systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP)\nblood pressures for each quartile (Q) of systolic blood pressure\nin the combined group of normotensive and untreated\nhypertensive Milwaukee African Americans\nSBP (mm Hg)\nDBP (mm Hg)\nBMI, body mass index.\n*P < 0.0001 for trend across quartiles; **Interquartile range in parentheses.\nTable 4 | Correlation coefficients (r), adjusted for age and sex,\nof systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures with\nanthropometric indices, within each quartile (Q) of systolic\nblood pressure in the combined group of normotensive and\nuntreated hypertensive African Americans\nTable5|Mean(\u00b1s.e.)systolicanddiastolicbloodpressuresand\nanthropometriccharacteristicsofnormotensiveanduntreated\nhypertensive NHANES participants, by ethnicity\nNormotensives (NT) Hypertensives (HT)\nBlack\nWhite\nBlack\nWhite\nAge\n(years)\nSBP\n(mm Hg)\nDBP\n(mm Hg)\nHeight\n(cm)\nWeight\n(kg)\nBMI\nWaist\n(cm)\nWaist/\nheight\n%\nSmokers\nBMI, body mass index; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; NHANES, National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\narticles Relationship of Blood Pressure to Adiposity\nin untreated hypertensive than in normotensive participants\n(Table 5). Combining normotensive and untreated hyper\ntensives, for both black and white participants, \nsystolic and\ndiastolic blood pressure values were significantly \ncorrelated\nwith BMI, waist circumference, and waist/height ratio\n(P < 0.0005). Similar to the results in the larger number of\nMilwaukee African-American subjects, in both black and\nwhite NHANES participants, systolic and diastolic blood pres\nsure values were significantly correlated (P < 0.0005) with\nthese anthropometric measures only in normotensive, but\nnot in hypertensive participants (Table 6). Overall, there was\nfound no difference in the percent of smokers between nor\nmotensive and hypertensive subjects, either in black and white\nethnic group analyzed separately. The BMI was lower in smok\namong blacks, waist circumference was also lower in smokers\n(P = 0.007). Further statistical adjustment for smoking status\nhad no effect on the significance of the correlations between\nadiposity and blood pressure or on the differences of these cor\nrelations between normotensives and hypertensives in both\nblack and white participants.\nDiscussion\nPrevious reports describe either a positive association of blood\npressure with anthropometric measures in predominantly\nnormotensive populations or the association of higher anthro\npometric measures with an increased prevalence or incidence\nof hypertension, but not with actual blood pressure levels in\nhypertensive individuals. The new information in this study is\nthe observation that the relationship of blood pressure to adi\nposity differs in normotensive and in untreated hypertensive\nindividuals.\nIn the Milwaukee subjects, systolic and diastolic blood pres\nsure values were highly correlated with indices of body size in\nnormotensive African-American men and women. In striking\ncontrast, there were no correlations of systolic blood pressure\nand only inconsistent, marginally significant correlations of\ndiastolic blood pressure with these anthropometric traits in\nuntreated hypertensive individuals. Furthermore, even among\nsubjectsintheupperrangesofthenormotensiveblood\npressure\ndistribution, there was no association of blood pressure with\nthe measured anthropometric indices. Several reports sug\ngest that the relationships of body size to blood pressure level,\nthe prevalence of hypertension, and mortality are weaker in\nAfrican Americans than in whites.2,7,11,12 Nevertheless, similar\nto the current observations in Milwaukee African Americans,\namong NHANES participants, correlations of blood pressure\nwith body size were observed only in normotensive, but not in\nuntreated hypertensive blacks or whites.\nTo a greater extent than BMI, increased waist circumference\nis associated with elevated arterial pressure and additional\ncardiovascular disease risk factors constituting the metabolic\nsyndrome.11,13,14 The waist/height ratio is also associated with\nthe metabolic syndrome, and in several populations the waist/\nheight and waist/hip ratios are more closely associated with\ncardiovascular disease than either BMI or waist circumference\nalone.15,16 Although the measurement of waist circumference\nincludes both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, vis\nceral adipose tissue independent of total body fat has been\nfound to be the most consistent correlate of hypertension\nand the metabolic syndrome.17\u00ad19 In the current study, in a\nmultivariate analysis with all measures of adiposity included\nas independent variables in the model, only waist circumfer\nence was predictive of systolic blood pressure in untreated\nhypertensive, but not in normotensive Milwaukee African\nAmericans.\nLongitudinal studies provide the most compelling evidence\nfor a causal relationship between weight gain and the subse\nquent development of hypertension.20\u00ad22 Conversely, pri\nmarily in short-term studies, weight loss is associated with a\ndecrease in blood pressure and hypertension prevention, even\nwhen dietary salt intake is held constant.23,24 The average\neffect of weight loss on blood pressure is small, and long-term\nresults are disappointing.22 In morbidly obese individuals, the\nSwedish Obese Subjects study suggests that the beneficial effect\nof weight loss on blood pressure during active weight loss may\nnot be sustained over time during weight maintenance.25 The\ncurrent demonstration of the association of adiposity with\nblood pressure in normotensive, but not in hypertensive indi\nviduals, raises the possibility that control of body weight may\nbe a more effective strategy for hypertension prevention than\nfor the treatment of hypertension.\nHypertension and obesity are multifactorial traits deter\nmined by a complex interplay of genes and environment.26,27\nAlthough weight gain may be a predisposing factor for the\ndevelopment of hypertension, our data are compatible with\nthe concept that the relationship between adiposity and blood\npressure is modulated by genetic and environmental factors.\nFor example, the Pima Indians have the highest prevalence of\nreported obesity in the world, but a low prevalence of hyper\ntension. Experimental evidence suggests that the lack of an\nincrease of sympathetic nervous system activity with increas\ning adiposity contributes to the low prevalence of hyperten\nsion in this population.28\nSeveral limitations of this study should be noted. Four blood\npressure measurements were obtained during a single outpatient\nTable 6 | Correlation coefficients (r) of systolic and diastolic\nblood pressures with anthropometric characteristics, by\nethnicityandbloodpressurestatus,adjustedforageandsexin\nNHANES participants\nBlack White\nNormotensive Hypertensive Normotensive Hypertensive\nBMI, body mass index; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; NHANES, National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\narticles\nRelationship of Blood Pressure to Adiposity\nvisit. Although a clinical diagnosis of hypertension is defined\non the basis of an arbitrary blood pressure value, by evaluating\ncorrelations of blood pressure with adiposity and by separating\nsubjects into blood pressure quartiles, we describe the relation\nship of adiposity to blood pressure across wide ranges of blood\npressure rather than focusing exclusively on one blood pres\nsure value. Nevertheless, the results of this cross sectional study\nshould not be interpreted to minimize the potential contribution\nof weight change to blood pressure change over time. The study\nwas carried out exclusively in African Americans. Although\ninclusion of NHANES data provided the opportunity to evaluate\nthe blood pressure\u00ad\nadiposity relationship in a population based\nsample of white subjects, this relationship should be explored\nin additional population groups. To eliminate the confounding\neffects of antihypertensive drug therapy, hypertensive patients\non drug therapy were not included in the analysis of the blood\npressure\u00adadiposity relationship.\nIn summary, in both blacks and whites, indices of adiposity\nwere greater in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects.\nIn both the Milwaukee subjects and the NHANES partici\npants, combining normotensive and untreatred hypertensive\nindividuals, blood pressure values correlated with adiposity.\nHowever, a relationship between blood pressure and adipos\nity was not observed throughout all blood pressure ranges.\nBlood pressure values were significantly correlated with adi\nposity only in normotensive subjects, but not in subjects with\nhypertension. These observations are consistent with the\nhypothesis that control of body weight may be a more effec\ntive strategy for hypertension prevention than for the treat\nment of hypertension.\n"
