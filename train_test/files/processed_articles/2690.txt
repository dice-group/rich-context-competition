However, the impact of these factors on the association\nbetween IRH and mortality was limited. Furthermore, when both SRH and IRH were included in the analytical\nmodels, the association between SRH and mortality disappeared, while the association between IRH and mortality\nstill persisted.\nDiscussion:Although there is some difference between IRH and SRH, IRH captures similar health information as SRH\nand is strongly predictive of mortality independent of SRH; thus, IRH could be a good supplementary measurement for\nwell-adopted SRH.\n",

E-mail:\ngudanan@yahoo.com\nDecision Editor: Jan Warren-Findlow, PhD\n Key Words: China--Interviewer-rated health--Mortality--Older adults--Self-rated health\nNumerous studies have shown that self-rated health (SRH)\nis a good measurement of health, and it is strongly asso-\nciated with subsequent health outcomes such as mortal-\nity (Borawski, Kinney, & Kahana, 1996; DeSalvo, Bloser,\nIdler & Benyamini, 1997). In the existing literature, a sin-\ngle item asking respondents to rate their global health is\nthe generally adopted measure of SRH; this persists even\nthough there have been attempts to use multiple-item scales\nof SRH (Bjorner and Kristensen, 1999) or comparative\nSRH--an evaluation of an individual's own health relative\nto that of age peers or to one's past health (Vuorisalmi,\nLintonen, & Jylh\u00e4, 2005). SRH has thus been proposed as\na cost-effective and reliable substitute for objective health\nindicators and a valuable complement to routine medical\ndiagnosis and screening (Federal Interagency Forum on\nAging-Related Statistics, 2003). A large number of studies\nhave already been conducted on this simple but effective\nmeasurement; yet, researchers continue to demand more\nresearch to better understand what affects the self-rating\nprocess of SRH, what health aspects it captures, what\nmakes up its mortality-predictive power, and how it varies\nacross populations and social/cultural contexts (Benyamini,\nSRH is essentially a subjective measurement that involves\ncomplex perceptions over multiple health or health-related\ndomains (Benyamini, Idler, Leventhal, & Leventhal, 2000;\nGoldman, Glei, & Chang, 2004; Kaplan & Baron-Epel,\n2003). Studies consistently show that the self-assessment\nof overall health may take into account not only physical\nhealth conditions (e.g., illnesses, diseases, or functioning)\nbut also other factors such as cognitive capacity, psycho-\nlogical well-being, clinical risk factors, health behaviors,\nhealth experience and history, health services utilization,\nmedication use, and social participation (Benyamini et al.,\nM\u00e4ntyselk\u00e4, Turunen, Ahonen, & Kumpusalo, 2003;\nDoorn, 1999). As a subjective evaluation, SRH is affected\nby a set of cognitive factors (Huisman & Deeg, 2010; Jylh\u00e4,\n2009). First, because the criteria used to judge global health\n(i.e., self-criterion) vary considerably across individuals,\nthis often leads to different ratings (DeSalvo & Muntner,\nwhom to use as a reference--namely, self-referencing (e.g.,\nage peers, ideal image or role models, or individual's own\npast health)--also affect the outcome of SRH (van Doorn,\n1999). Cultures, especially culture-based health values and\nbeliefs, play an important role in personal health percep-\nhas recently proposed a conceptual model to reflect such a\nsubjective process: individuals first prioritize biomedical or\nfunctional conditions and risk factors that form self-per-\nception; next, they compare their personal health to that\nof their chosen referent; finally, they take cultural/social\nnorms into consideration and express their assessment.\nAs SRH may introduce certain biases due to its subjec-\ntivity, researchers have also embarked on efforts to examine\nexternal evaluations of global health that can be completed\nby raters such as medical professionals, spouses/family\nmembers, or survey interviewers (Todd & Goldman, 2013).\nRelative to SRH, these external evaluations might be more\ncostly due to the intensive communication and observation\nrequired; however they may provide valuable complemen-\ntary information for SRH that could help increase the accu-\nracy of measurements of overall health and better predict\nsubsequent health outcomes (Ayalon & Covinsky, 2009;\nDeSalvo & Muntner, 2011; Giltay, Vollaard, & Kromhout,\nExisting literature on external ratings of health focuses\nmostly on evaluations by medical personnel (e.g., DeSalvo\net al., 1993). Studies have shown that physicians' ratings\nare valid predictors of patients' mortality, independent of\nSRH (Giltay et al., 2012). A medical professional's rating\ncould be more advantageous over SRH, as the former fol-\nlows a scientific evidence-based procedure that integrates\nobjective clinical data gathered via a diagnosis of diseases,\na review of medical history, an evaluation of symptoms,\na physical examination, and an assessment of risk factors\n(Giltay et al., 2012). However, health ratings made by non-\nprofessional persons such as spouses/family members, or\nsurvey interviewers have been studied infrequently, and the\nassociation between these ratings and respondents' mortal-\nity has not been well established. Several studies reported\nthat the health reports made by spouses could predict part-\nners' mortality--independent of SRH and other objective\nDoorn, 1998)--and that the combined use of spouse-rated\nhealth reports and SRH led to better mortality prediction\nthan the use of SRH alone (Ayalon & Covinsky, 2009).\nA more recent study further corroborated that compared\nto the subject's own rating, proxy-rating may evaluate the\nglobal health condition of the subject differently and pre-\ndict subsequent mortality differently (Vuorisalmi, Sarkeala,\nThe health ratings of survey interviewers, that is, inter-\nviewer-rated health (IRH), have recently gained increasing\nattention. Chen and Wu (2008) found that the SRH\u00admor-\ntality association among the Chinese oldest-old was sub-\nstantially attenuated by the inclusion of IRH. Based on\na survey of older adults in Taiwan, Smith and Goldman\n(2011) found that, in contrast to SRH, IRH gives more\nweight to certain health aspects such as physical function-\ning, and they proposed that IRH could be a complemen-\ntary measure to SRH. More recently, Todd & Goldman\n(2013) examined the predictive powers of SRH, IRH, and\nphysician-rated health for mortality over a 5-year period\nfor a cohort of Taiwanese elderly. They concluded that IRH\nperformed the best and thus advocated increased use of\nIRH at the end of social surveys to complement routinely\nadopted SRH.\nAs compared to SRH, IRH could have the following\nadvantages (Brissette, Leventhal & Leventhal, 2003): inter-\nviewers may develop a good understanding of the global\nhealth of a respondent based on onsite observations and\ncommunications; interviewers can capture valuable health\ninformation such as physical appearance and environmen-\ntal characteristics, which are outside of the range of objec-\ntive medical tests; interviewer evaluations are not affected\nby the self-serving biases of respondents; and based on their\nobservations of multiple respondents, interviewers often\nadopt a referent scheme that is clearer and more stable\nthan the vague and subjective ones used by respondents.\nMore importantly, IRH often incorporates the information\nof SRH, as IRH is usually done after the interview and the\ninterviewers already know the SRH of their respondents\nThis study examines the potential use of IRH as a com-\nplementary measure of SRH through a systematic compari-\nson of their components and mortality-predictive power\nin the Chinese elderly population. More specifically, we\naim to examine: (a) components of SRH and IRH for the\nelderly Chinese, (b) the predictive power of SRH and IRH\nwith respect to 3-year all-cause mortality, and (c) the extent\nto which each component of SRH and IRH influences the\nSRH\u00admortality and IRH\u00admortality associations.\nWe proposed a conceptual framework to guide the\nfollowing empirical analyses (see Supplementary Figure\nA). The possible components of SRH include multidi-\nmensional health conditions (e.g., biomedical conditions,\npsychological, and social well-being), which are based on\nmajor findings in previous research (e.g., Idler, Hudson, &\nA set of biopsychosocial factors from biological, psycho-\nlogical, behavioral, and social domains was also included\nin the conceptual framework. Research has shown that\nvarious demographic and socioeconomic factors in dif-\nferent populations are associated with SRH (Chandola,\nFerrie, Sacker, & Marmot, 2007; Han, Kim, & Lee,\nThirion, Vermeylen, & Niedhammer, 2013; Yamaoka,\n2008). Education, for example, has proved to be associ-\nated with SRH in many countries, regardless of the level\nof economic development (Furn\u00e9e, Groot, & van den\nPsychosocial and behavioral factors have also proved to\nbe highly associated with SRH (Mackenbach et al., 2002;\nMalinauskiene et al., 2011; Manderbacka, Lundberge,\n& Martikainen, 1999; Sargent-Cox, Anstey, & Luszcz,\n2010). Recent research has further revealed that SRH is\nstrongly associated with major biomarkers and certain\ngenetic components (Jylh\u00e4, Volpato & Guralnik, 2006;\nSvedberg, Lichtenstein, & Pedersen, 2001; Zeng, Hughes,\nLewis, Li, & Zhang, 2011). In addition, there is grow-\ning evidence that, independent of other possible influ-\nences, health conditions during childhood could exert\nlong-term effects on SRH in adulthood (French, Sargent-\nmental characteristics of the respondent's daily life,\nmacro socioeconomic conditions, and cultural values also\naffect health self-rating (French et al., 2012; Han et al.,\nMcDonough, 2011; Subramanian, Kubzansky, Berkman,\nIn the lower section of Supplementary Figure A, we\nincorporated external ratings of global health as provided\nby IRH. Similar to SRH that is affected by the personal\nand contextual characteristics of respondents, we proposed\nthat IRH is influenced by characteristics of both respond-\nents and interviewers and the respondent's multidimen-\nsional health conditions. Additionally, to reflect the fact\nthat IRH often incorporates information of SRH as it is\nusually asked at the end of the survey interviews, we added\nan arrow to link the SRH and IRH in the figure.\nData and Methods\nStudy Population\nChinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS),\nwhich were conducted in a randomly selected half of the\ncounties/cities in 22 Han-ethnicity-dominant provinces\nongoing project with the goal of interviewing all centenar-\nians in the sampled counties/cities as well as a compara-\nble number of randomly selected males and females with\napproximately equal sample size at each age from 65 to\n99. The data were collected through in-home interviews\nby trained interviewers who are local staff members from\nthe county-level network system of the National Bureau of\nStatistics of China. All interviewers have received 12+ years\nof schooling, and most have earned a college degree. Each\ninterviewer was accompanied by a local doctor, a nurse, or\na medical college student so that some health check-ups\ncould be performed. The sampling procedure and quality of\ndata have been detailed elsewhere (Zeng et al., 2008) and\ndescriptive documents are accessible via the CLHLS web-\nsite (http://centerforaging.duke.edu/chinese-longitudinal-\nhealthy-longevity-survey). Duke University Health System's\nInstitutional Review Board reviewed and approved ethics\nfor this survey, and informed consent was obtained from\neach respondent.\nDue to the availability of data on the major variables\nwere used in this study. The 2005 cross-sectional sample\ninitial respondents from the 2005 cross-sectional sample,\nand thus had mortality information, make up the 2005\u00ad\n2008 longitudinal sample. The response rate for each wave\nof the survey was around 90%. Respondents lost to fol-\nlow-up were excluded from the analyses because we were\nunable to determine their survival status in the 2008 survey.\nA sensitivity analysis of inclusion of those lost to follow-up\nwith imputed survival information from multiple imputa-\ntions with covariates produced similar results.\nIn the baseline survey of 2005, respondents were asked\nto rate their overall health as \"very good,\" \"good,\" \"fair,\"\n\"poor,\" or \"very poor.\" For this study, we combined the\n\"poor\" and \"very poor\" categories due to small frequen-\ncies. An additional category, \"unable to answer\" was des-\nignated for respondents who were too sick to answer the\nquestion (about 8%). We compared three approaches to\ndealing with this category: (a) dropping cases in this cat-\negory from the analysis, (b) coding them as \"poor/very\npoor,\" and (c) imputing values for these cases based on the\nresponses of the respondents with the same demographic\nand socioeconomic characteristics, health resources, and\ndisabilities. Because the results of the three methods were\nsimilar, we used imputed estimates for this category in the\nfinal analyses. In the 2005 wave, survey interviewers were\nasked to rate the overall health of the respondent after\nthe completion of each interview (i.e., IRH). Interviewers\ncould categorize respondents as \"healthy,\"\"fairly healthy,\"\n\"slightly ill,\" or \"moderately or severely ill.\"These four cat-\negories correspond to the four categories used to measure\nComponents of SRH and IRH\nIn the conceptual framework outlined above, the following\nhealth-related conditions were considered as components\nof SRH and IRH: Physical health, cognition, psychologi-\ncal well-being, and social participation. Physical health\nwas measured by disability, disease condition, and ill-\nness. Disability includes disability both in activities of\ndaily living (ADL) (Katz et al., 1963) and in instrumental\nactivities of daily living (IADL) (Lawton & Brody, 1969).\nADL disability was defined as a self-reported need for\nassistance in performing any of the following six tasks:\nbathing, dressing, eating, indoor transferring, toileting,\nand continence. Each item was assigned a value of 0 if\nno assistance was needed and 1 otherwise. The final ADL\ndisability score ranges from 0 to 6. IADL disability refers\nto a self-reported need for assistance in performing any\nof the following eight activities: visiting neighbors/friends,\nshopping, cooking, washing clothes, walking 1 km, lifting\nkg, crouching and standing up three times, and taking\npublic transportation. The coding of IADL was similar to\nthat of ADL, and the final score ranges from 0 to 8.\nDisease condition was measured in terms of self-reported\nnumber of chronic diseases (out of 25 listed in the question-\nnaire, including most of the major ones such as cardiovascu-\nlar diseases, diabetes, pneumonia, and arthritis) that affect\nthe respondents. With regard to illnesses, respondents were\nasked whether they had felt \"not well\" in the last 2 weeks\n(yes vs. no), and the number of hospitalizations or period\nof being bedridden they had experienced in the last 2 years.\n\"Not feeling well\" in the last 2 weeks reflects the respond-\nent's overall subjective or emotional state in a very recent\ntime period and it could more directly impact how respond-\nents rated their health status at the time of interview.\nCognitive impairment was measured by the Chinese\nversion of the mini-mental status examination (MMSE)\n(Wen & Gu, 2011), which tests seven aspects of cognitive\nfunctioning: Orientation, registration, copy and design,\ncalculation, recall, naming, and language (repetition, read-\ning and obeying, writing, and commands). We considered\na respondent's cognition as normal if the MMSE score was\n24 or higher; otherwise, the respondent was considered\nas cognitively impaired (Wen & Gu, 2011). Psychological\nwell-being was measured by two items: first, does the\nrespondent often look at the bright side of things (i.e., opti-\nmistic) (always/often vs. fair/seldom/never); second, does\nthe respondent feel as happy as when he/she was young\n(always/often vs. fair/seldom/never). Social participation\nwas defined as active if the respondent reported either\nplaying Mahjong with others or taking part in any form\nof social activities--both on a weekly or more frequent\nbasis; if not, the respondent was categorized as inactive. To\nassess whether study respondents used overall health in the\npast year as a reference when rating their current health,\nwe added a variable that measures self-perceived changes\nin global health in the past year (better, unchanged, and\nworsened).\nMortality\nMortality risk was the dependent variable in survival\nanalyses, which was measured by survival status (died or\nsurvived in the 2008 wave) and the duration of survival\n(days of survival between the two waves). The dates of\nwaves. For those who died before the 2008 interview, the\ndates of death were collected from officially issued death\ncertificates whenever available; next-of-kin and local resi-\ndential committees were consulted when a death certificate\nwas not available. Our supplementary analysis showed that\nthe data quality of death rates in the CLHLS from 2005 to\n2008 was high based on comparisons between the CLHLS,\nControl Variables\nThe analyses controlled for numerous factors that could con-\nfound the SRH\u00admortality and IRH\u00admortality associations\nMackenbach, Simon, Looman, & Joung, 2002); these fac-\ntors include demographic characteristics, early-life condi-\ntions, socioeconomic status (SES), social connection and\nsupport, health practices, life satisfaction, and family longev-\nity (a proxy for genetic traits). Two contextual factors, the\nlocal per capita GDP and average years of schooling in the\ncounty in which the study respondent was living at the time\nof survey (both measured in 2005), were also included in the\nmodel. To account for the substantial geographic variation\nin socioeconomic development across China, we included a\nregional measure with five categories: North, Northeast, East/\nSoutheast, Central China, and Northwest. Coding details for\ncovariates are not presented in the current manuscript due to\nspace limit, yet are available from the authors upon request.\nStatistical Analysis\nTo achieve the first research goal (i.e., examining the\nmajor components of SRH and IRH), we used the 2005\ncross-sectional sample and multilevel ordered logistic\nregressions based on the generalized linear latent and\nmixed models (gllamm) (see Skrondal & Rabe-Hesketh,\n2004). Two sequential models were designed for both SRH\nand IRH (see Table 2). We did not present models with age\nand gender as the controls only because the results are very\nclose to those with additional covariates. To achieve the\nsecond research goal (i.e., assessing the predictive power\nof SRH and IRH with respect to 3-year all-cause mortal-\nity), three models were conducted using data from the\nin Table 3); shared-frailty parametric models with random\neffects were employed in order to take into account the\ncorrelations between respondents within the same county\n(Gutierrez, 2002). In a similar vein as for the first goal, we\ndid not present models with age and gender as the controls\nonly. To fulfill the third goal (i.e., investigating the extent\nto which these components attenuate the SRH\u00admortality\nand IRH\u00admortality associations controlling for a number\nof covariates), six models were designed using the same\nlongitudinal sample for the second goal (See Models B-IV\nto B-IX in Table 3). In the sequential models for fulfilling\nthe second and third goals, we designed models including\nSRH and IRH separately and simultaneously not only to\ncompare the predictive power of SRH and IRH, but also\nto investigate how the SRH\u00admortality association changes\nwhen IRH is adjusted for.\nWith the exceptions of parental age at death, the propor-\ntion of missing values for all other variables in the analysis\nwas less than 2%. To reduce possible bias due to missing\nvalues in the analysis and inferences, we employed the mul-\ntiple imputation technique for all variables except parental\nage at death, for which we treated missing (around 20%)\nas a special category. We did not apply sampling weights in\nthe regression models because the CLHLS weight variable\nwas unable to reflect the national population distributions\nwith respect to variables other than age, sex, and urban/\nrural residence. All analyses were performed using STATA\nResults\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics for both the 2005\nple (all results were unweighted). As shown in the table,\nwith respect to elders in the baseline sample, about 10%\ndescribed their health as very good, 37% as good, 36%\nas fair, and 18% as poor or very poor; for IRH, the corre-\nsponding proportion of health ratings were 27% (healthy),\n56% (fairly healthy), 15% (slightly ill), and 2% (moder-\nately or severely ill). The distributions suggest that respond-\nents were more likely to report their health status as very\ngood or good, while interviewers seemed to favor the fairly\nhealthy category. The distributions of the major variables in\nthe longitudinal sample were mostly similar to those in the\ncross-sectional sample.\nTable 2 presents how the components were correlated\nwith poorer SRH and IRH. The overall patterns with\nregards to the components for SRH and IRH were simi-\nlar, showing that the components of SRH could also be\napplied to IRH. However, by looking into the 95% confi-\ndence intervals of odds ratios (not shown), we find some\ndifference in associates for SRH and IRH. For instance,\nIADL disability, ADL disabilities, and cognitive impair-\nment all had a stronger association with poorer IRH than\nwith poorer SRH. In Model A-II for SRH, the 95% con-\nimpairment, respectively; correspondingly, Model A-II\nMoreover, self-perceived change in overall health in the\npast year had a stronger influence on poorer SRH than\nresults imply that study respondents placed more emphasis\non their own perceptions and past experience when rating\nhealth, whereas interviewers emphasized more externally\ndetectable measures.\nAmong the individual-level biopsychosocial fac-\ntors, in the adjusted models, older age was associated\nwith lower odds of both respondents and interviewers\nreporting poorer health. For IRH, minority ethnic status\n(relative to Han status) was also related to lower odds\nof poorer health. There were significant geographic dif-\nferences in both SRH and IRH, with a larger variation\nfound for IRH. Higher SES in adulthood or old age was\nassociated with lower odds of poorer SRH and IRH.\nHigher levels of family/social support or connections\nwere positively associated with better SRH, but were\nnot associated with IRH. Current smokers, alcohol con-\nsumers, and those doing regular exercise had better SRH\nand IRH. Good life satisfaction was associated with bet-\nter SRH and IRH. Among the community level biopsy-\nchosocial factors, higher per capita GDP was associated\nwith lower odds of poorer SRH and IRH. The average\neducational level of residents in a community was posi-\ntively associated with poor IRH, but had no association\nwith SRH.\nSupplementary Figure B presents the proportion of\ndeath between the two waves in terms of ratings of SRH\nand IRH. Clearly, the mortality gradient across IRH\nratings is more pronounced than that across SRH rat-\nings. The relative hazards of 3-year mortality for differ-\nent ratings of SRH and IRH are summarized in Table 3.\nCompared to the ratings for very good SRH, the ratings\nfor good SRH, fair SRH, and poor/very poor SRH were\nity risk, respectively, controlling for a number of covari-\nates (Model B-I). The IRH\u00admortality association was\nalso significant. Compared to the healthy rating of IRH,\nthe relative hazards of ratings of fairly healthy, slightly\nTable 1.

The results for controls are not shown due to space limit, but available upon request from\nthe authors. Theta is proportion of variance among the total variance at the county level.\nThe remaining models in Table 3 demonstrate the extent\nto which the SRH and IRH components influence the SRH\u00ad\nmortality and IRH\u00admortality associations when all associ-\nates were controlled for. Model B-IV shows that, when the\nphysical health components were added to Model B-I, the\nassociation between SRH and mortality diminished. The\nSRH\u00admortality association became insignificant when IRH\nwas further included (Model B-VI). For the IRH\u00admortal-\nity association, it diminished as well once physical health\ncomponents were added in the model (Model B-V). But in\nthe presence of SRH in addition to physical health compo-\nnents, the IRH\u00admortality association had almost no change\n(Model B-VI). When components of cognitive function,\npsychological well-being, social participation, and change\nin global health in the past year were additionally included\nin the analyses, the SRH\u00admortality and IRH\u00admortality\nassociations continue to further diminish. Nevertheless,\nall poorer ratings of IRH continue to be significantly asso-\nciated with a higher risk of mortality compared with the\nhealthy rating.\nDiscussion\nSeveral recent efforts have attempted to introduce external\nhealth ratings such as IRH to complement SRH (Smith &\nSRH and IRH for Chinese older adults by examining their\ncomponents, their predictive power with respect to mor-\ntality, and the role of each component in influencing their\nassociations with mortality. The main insight of this study\nis that although some difference exists between IRH and\nSRH, IRH captures similar health information as SRH and\nis strongly predictive of mortality independent of SRH;\nthus, IRH could be a valuable supplementary measurement\nfor SRH.\nOur results show that ADL and IADL disability, chronic\ndiseases, recent illnesses and hospitalizations, cognitive\nfunction, psychosocial well-being, and social participation\nwere all important components for both SRH and IRH in\nChinese older adults. However, when the structure of these\ncomponents were compared with respect to SRH and IRH,\nthe respondents tended to place more emphasis on personal\nhealth experiences and perceptions (e.g., self-perception of\nchanges in health in the past year); by contrast, the inter-\nviewers relied more on externally detectable health condi-\ntions such as ADL and IADL disabilities. These findings\nare consistent with studies on Western populations (e.g.,\nBenyamini, Leventhal, & Leventhal, 1999; Brissette et al.,\nThe finding that the robust power of IRH in predicting\nmortality in the presence of SRH and a variety of covariates\namong Chinese elders echoes some previous studies that\nadvocated IRH as an excellent complement to SRH (Smith\nhow CLHLS interviewers evaluated respondents' health\nmay help explain the advantage of IRH to predict mortal-\nity. In the CLHLS, IRH was completed immediately after\nan interviewer finished collecting data from the respond-\nent. That is, the interviewer health evaluation was based\non rich information about the respondents. In particular,\nthe information of SRH was also incorporated into the\nrating process of IRH. Moreover, because interviewers\nusually investigated multiple respondents, they were able\nto develop a relatively objective standard for rating the\nrespondents in comparison to peers. Consequently, the\npersonal subjective biases of interviewers may have been\navoided to some extent. Furthermore, onsite observations\nand communications may have allowed interviewers to\ncapture unmeasured health information in their ratings.\nFor example, observing whether or not a bathing facil-\nity was available could help an interviewer understand\nwhether self-reported ADL difficulties in bathing were\nintrinsic or due to environmental barriers (Purser, Feng,\nYi, & Hoenig, 2012). The higher educational attainment\nof the interviewers than the respondents could also matter.\nOnly 38.9% of our respondents had received 1+ years of\nschooling; by contrast, most interviewers had received 12+\nyears of schooling, and their better health literacy may have\nallowed them to provide more accurate assessments of the\nglobal health of the respondents.\nOur findings on the value of IRH among Chinese older\nadults have broad implications for individuals, family, and\npublic health practitioners. From the perspectives of both\nindividuals and families, our study suggests that the health\nratings by a nonprofessional rater could still provide added\nvalue to health assessment in addition to the well-known\nSRH. Our study recommends the adoption of external\nhealth ratings such as IRH in social surveys and fieldwork.\nDoing so may help refine overall health measurements and\nimprove their accuracy and predictive powers on subse-\nquent health outcome such as mortality. In practice, we\nconsider it feasible to add a question regarding IRH at the\nend of survey questionnaires. Such an additional question\nmay not incur too much cost, but could provide a way to\nrefine health measurements including SRH (also see Todd\n& Goldman, 2013). If possible, we also suggest that sur-\nveys include a few more questions that would capture per-\nsonal information about the interviewer as a rater of IRH\n(e.g., demographic characteristics, education, occupations,\nhealth literacy, and information related to the subjective\nprocess of rating of study respondents). This information\ncould facilitate future studies to better understand how\ncharacteristics of interviewers might affect their health\nassessment of respondents.\nIt needs to be noted that we are not proposing to take\nIRH as an alternative or replacement to SRH. First, SRH\nshould be still preferred as an easier and more cost-effective\nhealth measure than IRH, as the latter usually involves face-\nto-face interviews. Second, as shown in our findings, unlike\nSRH, IRH is more likely to be based on detectable condi-\ntions of physical health, but unable to capture somatic and\nemotional states as effective as SRH. More importantly,\nalthough the predictive power of IRH for mortality is inde-\npendent of SRH, the rating of IRH is somewhat associated\nwith SRH because IRH was performed after interviewers\nacquired the information on SRH. Users of IRH should\ntreat this issue with particular caution, and future stud-\nies are encouraged to investigate the performance of IRH\nwhen measured without any information regarding SRH.\nThis study also has some other interesting findings. We\nfound that, among Chinese older adults, a higher mortal-\nity risk of fair or poorer SRH relative to very good SRH\nwas primarily explained by ADL and IADL disabilities.\nWhy was the SRH\u00admortality association more sensitive to\nADL and IADL disabilities than the other components in\nthis population? ADL and IADL disabilities are indeed the\nstrongest mortality predictors among the Chinese elderly\npopulation (Feng, Hoenig, Gu, Yi, & Purser, 2010). Because\nthe measurements of ADL and IADL disabilities are directly\nbased on respondents' daily experiences, they may be less\naffected by response errors than health measures that\nrequire more knowledge or more accurate memories such\nas self-reports of chronic diseases, psychological well-being,\nor hospitalization history. This could be particularly true in\nChina, where certain health indicators such as chronic dis-\neases may not be reported accurately by respondents who\nhave low educational attainment, few chances to undergo\nmedical examinations, and little access to advanced medi-\ncal diagnostics techniques. Results about associative fac-\ntors of SRH and IRH are also noteworthy. Current smokers\nand alcohol drinkers are found to be associated with better\nSRH in China, which is inconsistent with previous litera-\nture (Manderbacka et al., 1999). We speculate that poorer\nSRH among smoking quitters and the exclusion of fre-\nquency or amount of smoking/drinking in analyses may be\npartially responsible. Furthermore, smoking and drinking\nin East Asian cultures is indicative of the maintenance of\na social network, which, in turn, promotes psychological\nwell-being in late life (Gu, Feng, & Sautter, 2008). We have\nalso observed significant geographic differences in both\nSRH and IRH, especially the latter. Unobserved regional\nheterogeneity in culture, socioeconomic development and\naccess to medical resources may contribute to differences\namong respondents with respect to health awareness, lit-\neracy, and judgments in evaluating global health. Besides\nthese factors, interviewers' characteristics that are unavail-\nable for us to explore in this study may also contribute to\nthe geographic variation in IRH. We call for future research\nto shed more light on these issues.\nThis study has some limitations. First, like SRH, IRH\nis also subjectively determined by personal evaluations of\ninterviewers. Therefore, the characteristics of interviewers\nand the criteria they have used in health evaluations may\nhave affected the outcome of IRH. As our current data did\nnot contain such information, we were unable to explore\nthis issue. Second, our empirical findings to support IRH\nas a useful complement of SRH are based on a study of\nthe Chinese elderly population; these findings may not be\ndirectly generalized to Western societies as cultural and\nsocioeconomic contexts often affect health perceptions and\nreporting (Hanibuchi et al., 2012; McMullen & Luborsky,\nthink, it is very likely that IRH performs similarly across\ncultures. As we have discussed, most of the advantages of\nIRH over SRH--such as the incorporation of rich health\ninformation and the relatively objective evaluation frame-\nwork based on multiple respondents--may still apply in\nother societies regardless of the cultural and socioeconomic\nbackground. Lastly, the Chinese wording of the four cat-\negories for SRH--namely \"very good,\" \"good,\" \"fair,\"\nor \"poor/very poor\"--are not semantically the same as\nthe categories used for IRH--namely \"healthy,\" \"fairly\nhealthy,\" \"slightly ill,\" or \"moderately or severely ill.\" We\nhave translated these terms word-for-word based on their\noriginal meanings in Chinese. Although such semantic vari-\nance between the two sets of response items may introduce\nsome bias, it should not alter our primary findings, as they\nare still comparable schemes in the Chinese context. We\ncall for future studies to examine this issue by using exactly\nidentical response items for these two measurements.\nSupplementary Material\nPlease visit the article online at http://psychsocgerontology.\noxfordjournals.org/ to view supplementary material.\n"
