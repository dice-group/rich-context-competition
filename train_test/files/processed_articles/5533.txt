    "abstract": "Abstract\nBased on the idea that researchers may better understand attitudes regarding homosexuality by focusing on acceptance\nrather than heterosexism, we utilized an online survey to ask 437 undergraduate and graduate students at a medium-sized,\nMidwestern, public university to what extent they would agree that a list of 24 statements matched their views of what the\ncomplete acceptance of homosexuality in the United States would look like. The findings indicated that participants generally\nendorsed a range of statements, though the level of support and the number of endorsed items varied. The relationships\nbetween the items participants endorsed, and either their sexual orientation, experiences with gay men and lesbians, or levels\nof heterosexism, are also discussed, as are implications and suggestions for future research.\n",

Consider the problem of\nheterosexism or homonegativity, which the majority of the\nliterature in disciplines like sociology and psychology has\nunderstandably focused on reducing.Although this research\nhas been necessary and informative, it may be useful to\nincorporate an approach that focuses not on the problem of\nheterosexism but rather on what the world would look like\nif it did not exist and homosexuality was completely\naccepted. Worthington, Dillon, and Becker-Schutte (2005)\nappeared to support such a focus when they noted the\nfollowing:\n[R]esearch on heterosexual attitudes toward LGB [lesbian, gay,\nand bisexual] individuals typically relies on instruments that are\nintended to measure homophobia. In fact, the term LGB-\naffirmativeness (i.e., positive, affirmative attitudes toward LGB\nindividuals) is often assumed to be the absence (or reduction) of\nhomophobia and heterosexism, or it is not specifically defined at\nall. Therefore, as heterosexual attitudes toward LGB individuals\nreflect widening complexities, it is critical that scientific\nmeasurement provides increasing precision of range and\ndimensionality. (p. 104, emphasis in original)\nTo that end, we asked undergraduate and graduate stu-\ndents to what extent they would agree that a list of state-\nments represented or matched their views of what the\ncomplete acceptance of homosexuality in the United States\nwould look like. As we will discuss in more detail in the\n\"Measures\" section, the majority of these statements were\nderived from measures of heterosexism. While we agree\nwith Worthington etal. (2005) that the acceptance of homo-\nsexuality is more than the absence of heterosexism, this\nabsence would at least partially constitute acceptance, so the\nconceptualization of heterosexism can provide a foundation\nfor the conceptualization of acceptance. In addition, the lit-\nerature on heterosexism includes numerous measures that\ncover a range of attitudes and behaviors. Because these\nmeasures have already been created and tested, we decided\nto reframe them to address acceptance rather than create\ncompletely new measures.\n1Western Illinois University, Macomb, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJulie C.

First, the study was one of the\noptions provided to a subject pool, which included all of the\nundergraduate students currently enrolled in any general edu-\ncation course in psychology. Second, an email message was\nrandomly selected undergraduate students who were not part\nof the psychology subject pool, with a reminder email sent\nabout 1 week later. Third, we announced the survey at a meet-\ning of the university's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender,\nQuestioning, Queer, Asexual and Ally (LGBTQA) student\norganization, and the organization's president sent an email\nmessage with a link to the survey to the organization's mem-\nbers shortly after this meeting. This link was the same as the\nlink in the email sent to the 6,000 randomly selected students,\nwhereas a different link was provided to the psychology pool\nso their participation could be tracked and they would receive\ncourse credit. The participants solicited by email or the orga-\nnizational meeting did not receive any compensation. The\nresearchers did not have access to any identifying information\nfor the psychology subject pool. Regardless of how they were\nsolicited, students had until the end of the semester to com-\nplete the survey.\nSample\nrecruited from the psychology subject pool and 246 of whom\nwere solicited via email or the LGBTQAstudent organization.\nOnly 15 of the 246 participants responded after the project was\nannounced at the organization's meeting, so we estimate that\nthis is the number of participants solicited from the organiza-\ntion and that the remaining 231 participants responded to the\nrecruitment email, which had been sent more than 1 week ear-\nlier. This would provide a response rate of 3.9% for those who\nreceived the email; the response rate would be 4.1% if all 246\nrespondents were assumed to have been solicited by the email\nmessage. Although it is possible to calculate a response rate\nfor the psychology subject pool, such a rate would be tentative\nbecause of other factors that influenced participation (e.g., the\namount of credits students needed and their personal prefer-\nences for one study over another).\nTable 1 presents the demographic information for the\nsample and the population. The population data came from\nthe university and were based on the fall 2013 semester as\ndata for the spring 2014 semester were not publicly avail-\nable. The sample appeared to be largely representative of the\npopulation, and the difference in the percentages of graduate\nstudents may simply result from graduate students not being\nincluded in the psychology subject pool.\nProcedure\nThe survey received institutional review board (IRB)\napproval and was conducted online via SurveyMonkey. The\nfirst page of the survey contained the informed consent docu-\nment. The survey itself consisted of three sections, which\nassessed of heterosexism and other attitudes regarding\nhomosexuality, descriptions of the acceptance of homosexu-\nality, and demographic items, respectively. We will discuss\nacceptance first as it is the central variable.\nMeasures\nDescriptions of the acceptance of homosexuality.Given the\nrelative absence of literature that directly addressed the\nacceptance of homosexuality, we needed to construct\nthe measures of this concept. As noted in the \"Introduction\"\nsection, the literature on heterosexism provided some guid-\nance in the construction of these measures, which assessed\nthe extent to which participants agreed that a given statement\nmatched their personal definitions of acceptance. There were\n24 items, and participants endorsed each item using the fol-\nlowing options: strongly disagree, disagree, slightly dis-\nagree, slightly agree, agree, strongly agree, and unsure/\ndon't know. Table 2 provides the full wording of each item,\nand the items were preceded by the following phrase: \"If\nhomosexuality was fully accepted in our society, I would\nexpect that . . .\" In the following paragraphs, we will discuss\nour rationale for the inclusion of each of the 24 items.\nSix of the items (Items 1-5 and Item 10) addressed more\ntraditional forms of heterosexism, including viewing homo-\nsexuality as immoral and committing violent acts against\ngays and lesbians (Adolfsen, Jurjen, & Keuzenkamp, 2010;\nMorrison, Morrison, & Franklin, 2009; Rankin, Weber,\n1997). Including these items enabled us to assess whether the\nparticipants endorsed the decrease in heterosexism as part of\ntheir personal descriptions of the total acceptance of\nhomosexuality.\nEight other items (Items 11-18) addressed more expanded\nconceptualizations of heterosexism. The inclusion of these\nitems enabled us to determine whether participants endorsed\nthese additional ideas (or more accurately their reduction) as\npart of their descriptions of acceptance. Items 16 to 18\naddressed positive and negative stereotypes of gays and les-\nbians, as well as the belief that gays and lesbians are gender\natypical or nonconforming. These items addressed two of the\nforms of heterosexism discussed by Walls (2008). The first\nform was hostile heterosexism, or negative beliefs and atti-\ntudes about gays and lesbians (e.g., gay men are pedophiles\nand lesbians hate men), and the second was positive stereo-\ntypic heterosexism, or positive or neutral beliefs and atti-\ntudes that reinforced stereotypes about gays and lesbians\n(e.g., gay men are creative and lesbians are independent),\nincluding the belief that gay men and lesbians violate gender\nTollini and Herbstrith 3\nroles (e.g., Blashill & Powlishta, 2009). We included Item\n11, which addressed the absence of a negative reaction to\npublic displays of affection between same-sex couples,\nbecause Adolfsen etal. (2010) argued for including similar\nquestions because \"[h]ow people react to homosexuals in\ntheir personal environment or what they think of the visibil-\nity of homosexuality in public (like two men kissing) is not\ntaken into account\" in the literature (p. 1238).\nItems 12 to 15 were included to directly focus on \"affir-\nmative\" behaviors, to borrow language from Worthington\netal. (2005). These items specifically addressed heterosexu-\nals wanting to have gay and lesbian friends (Item 12), view-\ning gays and lesbians as beneficial to the country (Item 13),\nknowing the central figures and events in \"gay\" history (Item\n14), and attending \"Gay Pride\" parades (Item 15). Similarly,\nBrown, Clarke, Gortmaker, and Robinson-Keilig (2004)\nincluded measures that addressed participants' involvement\nin LGBT programs and interest in learning about LGBT con-\ncerns, history, and culture, and the item regarding a desire for\ngay and lesbian friends (Item 12) also connects to the litera-\nture on courtesy stigma (i.e., the belief that someone who\nassociates with gays and lesbians is also gay or lesbian, for\nexample, Neuberg, Smith, Hoffman, & Russell, 1994;\nSigelman, Howell, Cornell, Cutright, & Dewey, 1991).\nItems 6 to 9 were inspired by other literature related to\nheterosexism, though this literature did not focus on the\nmeasurement of this concept. Items 6 and 7 centered on the\nmeaning of \"fag.\" Although this term has generally been pre-\nsented as homophobic (e.g., Burn, 2008), a handful of\nresearchers have begun arguing that young men who engage\nin \"fag discourse\" actually focus on masculinity instead of\nsome people disconnect terms like \"fag\" from sexuality, they\nmay not view the elimination of such terms as one aspect of\nthe complete acceptance of homosexuality. Items 6 and 7\nwere included to assess this possibility. Item 8 was included\ngiven the literature that discussed people's, particularly\nmen's, discomfort at being hit on by members of the same\nsex (e.g., Pirlott & Neuberg, 2014) to see whether partici-\npants would endorse the absence of such discomfort as part\nof their personal descriptions of acceptance. Finally, Item 9\nwas included to address the concept of homohysteria, which\nMcCormack (2012) defined as \"the cultural fear of being\n\"the fear men maintain of being socially perceived as gay\"\n(p. 253). As with the previous item, this item was included\nbecause participants could endorse the absence of homohys-\nteria as part of their descriptions of acceptance.\nItems 19 to 23 were included because we believed par-\nticipants might endorse the ideas contained in them. The\nfirst two of these items addressed the ideas that acceptance\ncould be described as heterosexuals seeing sexual attraction\nTable 1. Sample and Population Demographics.\nGender\n Transgender male 0.2 --\n Transgender female 0.5 --\n Gender fluid 0.5 --\nRacial or ethnic identity\n Asian, Asian African, or Pacific Islander 1.1 1.1\n Native American or Alaskan Native 0.5 0.2\nClass rank\nSexual orientation\nBisexual/pansexual 9.6 --\nGay/lesbian/homosexual 8.2 --\n4 SAGE Open\nas the only thing differentiating gay men and lesbians from\nheterosexuals (Item 19) and as heterosexuals seeing homo-\nsexuality as just another form of attraction (Item 20). These\nitems were similar to questions Yang (1997) described\nbeing used in various polls, which asked participants\nwhether they viewed homosexuality as an acceptable alter-\nnative lifestyle. Similarly, Item 21 addressed the idea that\nacceptance could be described as heterosexuals not being\nconcerned about sexual orientation. Items 22 and 23\ndiffered from the items discussed so far in that they included\npeople having negative views of homosexuality within the\ndescription of acceptance. In these questions, respondents\nwere asked whether they would endorse heterosexuals not\nexpressing their negative views of homosexuality or not\nallowing those views to affect how they treated gay men\nand lesbians in their descriptions of acceptance. These\nitems were similar to those included among Worthington\nTable 2.

All agree categories = strongly agree, agree, and slightly agree.\nTollini and Herbstrith 5\nFinally, Item 24 addressed legal equality. This item was\nincluded given the extent to which legal equality has been put\nforward as a marker of acceptance in the literature (Brewer,\n2008) and included in previous surveys and polls regarding\nheterosexism or broader attitudes toward homosexuality\nAdditional demographic variables.In addition to the items\nincluded in Table 1, we also asked participants whether they\nwere members of the university's LGBTQA student organi-\nzation and whether they personally knew anyone who was\ngay or lesbian, with \"yes\" and \"no\" as the response options\nfor both questions. Participants who indicated they knew\nsomeone who was gay or lesbian were also asked to provide\nthe number of gay men and lesbians they knew.\nThese items, as well as the item that measured sexual ori-\nentation (see Table 1), were included because participants'\nsexual orientation, experiences with gay men and lesbians,\nand exposure to \"gay culture\" could all affect their knowl-\nedge of the lived experiences of gay men and lesbians. This\nknowledge could, in turn, affect which statements the partici-\npants endorsed. For instance, heterosexual participants with\ngay and lesbian friends may have heard from those friends\nabout being harassed when they engaged in public displays\nof affection. As a result, these participants may endorse the\nabsence of such harassment as part of their description of the\ncomplete acceptance of homosexuality. In addition, previous\nresearch has described how membership in LGBTQA orga-\nnizations affected members' identities and preferred strate-\ngies for seeking social change (e.g., Renn, 2007), which\nsupports the idea that organizational membership can affect\npeople's ideas. The contact hypothesis, which posits that\ninterpersonal contact with a minority group (e.g., gay men\nand lesbians) may lead to lower levels of prejudice (e.g.,\nsupports the idea that the number of gay men and lesbians\nknown to the participants, particularly the heterosexual par-\nticipants, could impact which statements they endorsed\nbecause increased contact could increase understanding.\nHeterosexism.We used Walls's (2008) Multidimensional\nHeterosexism Inventory (MHI) to measure participants' lev-\nels of heterosexism. The MHI included 23 statements, to\nwhich the participants indicated their levels of agreement.\nThe responses options for these items matched those for the\ndescriptions of the acceptance. Each item in the MHI\naddressed one of four different types of heterosexism Walls\ndiscussed. The first type was paternalistic heterosexism or\n\"subjectively neutral or positive attitudes, myths, and beliefs\nthat express concern for the physical, emotional, or cognitive\nwell-being of non-heterosexual [sic] persons while concur-\nrently denying, denigrating, stigmatizing, and/or segregating\nany non-heterosexual form of behavior, identity, relation-\nship, or community\" (e.g., \"I would prefer my daughter not\nbe homosexual because she would unfairly be stopped from\nwas aversive heterosexism or \"attitudes . . . that dismiss or\ntrivialize the importance of sexual orientation on life\nchances\" (e.g., \"Gay men should stop shoving their lifestyle\ntype was amnestic heterosexism or \"attitudes . . . that dis-\nmiss, belittle, or disregard the impact of sexual orientation on\nlife chances\" (e.g., \"Discrimination against lesbians is virtu-\nally nonexistent in today's society\"; Walls, 2008, p. 46). The\nfourth type was positive stereotypic heterosexism, which\nwas discussed above and was measured with items like \"Les-\nbians are better than heterosexual women at physically\ndefending themselves.\"\nFollowing Walls (2008), we conducted a factor analysis\nto confirm that the items intended to measure one type of\nheterosexism loaded on the same factor. Our findings, which\nare available upon request, were similar to Walls, and we\nfurther followed him by calculating four indices. Each index\nprovided the average score for the items that measured a\ngiven type of heterosexism. A higher score for each index or\nsubscale indicated stronger agreement to the items in that\nsubscale and, therefore, higher levels of that type of\nheterosexism.\nWe included the MHI because it can serve as a measure of\nthe participants' understanding of the discrimination and\nprejudice that gay men and lesbians experience. More spe-\ncifically, the items in the Paternalistic subscale acknowledge\nthis discrimination, whereas the items in the Amnestic and\nAversive subscales challenge or dismiss it. As we mentioned\nin the previous section, participants'beliefs about the experi-\nences of gay men and lesbians could affect their endorsement\nof the descriptions of acceptance. We expected that partici-\npants with lower scores on the Amnestic and Aversive sub-\nscales and higher scores on the Paternalistic subscale would\nbe more likely to endorse the descriptions of acceptance\nbecause these participants would arguably be more aware of\nthe various forms of discrimination gay men and lesbians\nface. The Positive Stereotypic subscale addressed a different\nset of beliefs, namely, the extent to which participants\nendorsed positive or neutral stereotypes of gay men and les-\nbians. Including this last subscale enabled us to determine\nwhether the participants' scores for this subscale correlated\nwith their responses to the descriptions of acceptance that\nfocused on positive or neutral stereotypes (Items 16 and 17).\nWe anticipated that participants with higher scores would be\nless likely to endorse these descriptions of acceptance\nbecause they may not view the elimination of these stereo-\ntypes, which they hold, as necessary for homosexuality to be\ncompletely accepted.\nResults\nAlmost three fourths of the sample selected either of the\nthree agree categories (strongly agree, agree, or slightly\n6 SAGE Open\nagree) for the statements regarding heterosexuals not hating\ngay men and lesbians, heterosexuals believing that only sex-\nual attraction differentiates gay men and lesbians from het-\nerosexuals, and full legal equality (Items 3, 19, and 24,\nrespectively; see Table 2). About two thirds of the partici-\npants selected any of the agree categories for the statements\nregarding heterosexuals not thinking homosexuality is\nimmoral, not thinking homosexual acts are disgusting, not\ncommitting violent acts against gay men or lesbians, not\nteasing or harassing gay men or lesbians, not being upset if\nthey found out someone they knew was gay or lesbian, not\nbeing upset if they saw a same-sex couple showing affection,\nattending \"Gay Pride\" parades, viewing homosexuality as\nanother type of attraction, not allowing negative views to\naffect how they treat gay men and lesbians, and not express-\ning negative views in front of gay men or lesbians (Items 1,\nof the participants selected any agree category for all of the\nremaining items except those regarding heterosexuals not\nusing \"fag\" at all, not being upset if someone of the same sex\nflirted with them or if someone thought they were gay or\nlesbian, wanting to have gay and lesbian friends, and know-\nSimilarly, the highest percentage of participants (45.5%)\nselected \"strongly agree\" for the item regarding legal equal-\nity (Item 24). The other items with the higher percentages of\nparticipants who selected \"strongly agree\" (30% or higher)\naddressed heterosexuals not hating gay men or lesbians, not\ncommitting violent acts against gay men or lesbians, not\nteasing or harassing gay men or lesbians, not using \"fag\" to\nrefer to gay men or lesbians, not being upset if someone they\nknew was gay or lesbian or if they saw a same-sex couple\nshowing affection, believing that only attraction differenti-\nates gay men and lesbians from heterosexuals, viewing\nhomosexuality as another type of sexual attraction, and not\nallowing any negative views to affect how they treat gay men\nrespectively).\nTo measure how many items each participant endorsed,\nwe created a variable that provided the number of items for\nwhich each participant selected any of the three agree cate-\ngories. To construct this variable, we first dummy coded all\n24 items, with participants receiving a value of 1 if they\nselected any of the agree categories, and then we calculated\na simple count of those dummy coded variables. The counts\nwere constructed so participants who selected \"don't know\"\nor skipped one or more of the acceptance items still had a\nnumber calculated. Only participants who skipped and/or\nanswered \"don't know\" for all of the items had a missing\nvalue. The count variable had a possible and actual maxi-\nmum of 24, and participants with higher values endorsed\nmore items. The distribution was negatively skewed, with a\nthe range was 24, the standard deviation was 8.10, the first\nquartile was 7, and the third quartile was 22.\nWe conducted additional analyses to see whether the\nnumber of items participants endorsed varied depending on\ntheir sexual orientation, membership in the university's\nLGBTQA student organization, and the number of gay men\nand lesbians they knew. For these analyses, we combined the\nsexual orientation minority categories because of their rela-\ntively low frequencies, and we transformed the variable\nregarding how many gay men and lesbians participants knew\ninto a categorical variable. The categories for this new vari-\nHeterosexuals had a significantly lower mean than non-\nsity's LGBTQA student organization had a higher mean than\nhaps because only 31 participants (7.3%) indicated they were\nmembers. There was a positive and significant relationship\nbetween the number of items participants endorsed and the\nnumber of gay men and lesbians they knew (Gamma = .262,\np < .001), though it should be noted that only 13 participants\n(3.7%) indicated they did not know any gay men or lesbians,\nand only 16 (4.5%) indicated they knew only one.\nAs the results for sexual orientation were significant and\nthe sample contained 85 (19.7%) nonheterosexual partici-\npants, we conducted additional analyses to determine\nwhether those participants were more likely to endorse cer-\ntain items than the heterosexual participants. The results of\nthese analyses, presented in Table 3, indicated that hetero-\nsexuals were less likely to select any of the agree categories\nfor all 24 items, and this difference was significant for all but\nthree of the items. The results were not significant for the\nitems that addressed heterosexuals attending \"Gay Pride\"\nparades, believing that only attraction differentiated gay men\nand lesbians from heterosexuals, and not expressing negative\nviews in front of gay men and lesbians (Items 15, 19, and 23,\nrespectively).\nThe final set of analyses included the MHI subscales. We\ncalculated Pearson correlation coefficients for the count vari-\nable and the Aversive, Amnestic, and Paternalistic subscales.\nTwo of these coefficients were significant. The Aversive sub-\nscale had a moderate, negative correlation (r = -.441, p <\n.001), and the Amnestic subscale had a weak, negative cor-\nrelation (r = -.212, p < .001). The higher the participants'\nscores were on both of these subscales, the more of each of\nthese two types of heterosexism they endorsed and the fewer\nof the acceptance items they endorsed. The Paternalistic sub-\nscale also had a weak, negative correlation, but this coeffi-\nFor the Positive Stereotypic subscale, we calculated\nGammas for the subscale scores and the responses to the two\nacceptance items that addressed positive or neutral stereo-\ntypes (Items 16-17).

The more participants agreed with the items in the\nPositive Stereotypic subscale, the less likely they were to\nDiscussion\nOverall, these findings demonstrate the value of applying the\n\"miracle question\" to people's attitudes regarding homosex-\nuality. One benefit is that separated but related concepts\n(e.g., homohysteria, \"fag discourse,\" courtesy stigma, and\ndifferent types of heterosexism) can be brought together to\naddress the argument that measures of heterosexism should\nbe more exhaustive (e.g., Adolfsen etal., 2010; Worthington\netal., 2005). Focusing on the acceptance of homosexuality\nrather than on the problem of heterosexism also provides\nvaluable information, which we will review below.\nWhile none of the 24 items were endorsed by all of the\nparticipants, there was a tendency for participants to endorse\nmultiple items. The most direct evidence of this trend is that\nthe participants tended to have scores on the upper end of the\ndistribution of the count variable. These findings indicate that\nthe participants generally endorsed relatively broad descrip-\ntions of the acceptance of homosexuality. It would appear that\nthe descriptions of acceptance are just as multifaceted as other\nattitudes regarding homosexuality, and future research should\nbe aware of and expand upon this finding.\nThe responses to the 24 items also indicate the potential\nimportance of items that were not included in the literature.\nThe most notable examples are the items regarding hetero-\nsexuals viewing homosexuality as just another type of attrac-\ntion and believing that only attraction differentiates gay men\nand lesbians from heterosexuals. Both of these items were\nendorsed by at least two thirds of the participants, though\nthey were not included in previous studies. Given their prev-\nalence, future research should arguably incorporate these\nmeasures, as well as determine whether people describe the\nacceptance of homosexuality in other ways that have not\nbeen presented in the literature.\nAnother contribution provided by the responses to the 24\nitems is that the participants were more likely to endorse\nsome items than others. More specifically, the items with the\nhighest level of support (70% or more of the participants\nselecting any of the three agree categories) addressed full\nlegal equality for gay men and lesbians, heterosexuals not\nhating gay men and lesbians, and heterosexuals believing\nthat only sexual attraction differentiated gay men and lesbi-\nans from heterosexuals. In contrast, the items regarding het-\nerosexuals not using \"fag\" at all, not being upset if someone\nthought they were gay or lesbian or if someone of the same\nsex flirted with them, wanting to have at least one gay or\nlesbian friend, and knowing about \"gay history\" had the low-\nest levels of endorsement, with less than 50% of the partici-\npants selecting any of the three agree categories for these\nitems. The majority of the items were between these two\nextremes.\nOne possible explanation for the different levels of\nendorsement is that the participants were more likely to\nendorse statements that were more commonly presented in\nthe public discourse regarding homosexuality. After all, this\ndiscourse has arguably focused more on legal equality, par-\nticularly in terms of marriage, than on having gay and lesbian\nfriends or teaching \"gay history\" (e.g., Brewer, 2008;\nMucciaroni, 2008). Future research could directly measure\npeople's exposure to the various discourses regarding homo-\nsexuality and assess the impact of this exposure on people's\nviews of homosexuality, including their descriptions of\nacceptance.\nA related explanation would be that participants' beliefs\nregarding homosexuality affected their endorsement of spe-\ncific items. For instance, the lower percentages for the items\nregarding the use of words like \"fag\" can be connected to the\nparticipants' disagreement regarding the meaning of \"fag.\"\nIn addition to the questions discussed in the \"Measures\" sec-\ntion, the participants were asked to what extent they agreed\nthat \"fag\" referred to a person being gay or lesbian. About\n60% of the participants disagreed with this statement. Having\na majority of the participants disagree that \"fag\" was con-\nnected to sexuality could explain why relatively smaller per-\ncentages of participants endorsed the \"fag discourse\" items.\nIn addition, the analyses with the Positive Stereotypic sub-\nscale of the MHI indicated that participants who held more\npositive or neutral stereotypes of gay men or lesbians were\nless likely to endorse the items regarding the elimination of\npositive or neutral stereotypes. Future research could further\ntest these connections, as well as seek out other possible\nexplanations for the variation in the participants' levels of\nendorsement.\nThe results of the analyses with the other MHI subscales\nsimilarly indicated that participants' beliefs about heterosex-\nism affected how many of the acceptance items they\nendorsed. The participants who agreed with the statements in\nthe Aversive or Amnestic subscales essentially did not\nbelieve that gay men and lesbians experienced discrimina-\ntion and prejudice, and these same participants tended to\nendorse a lower number of the acceptance items than the par-\nticipants who disagreed with the items in the Aversive and\nAmnestic subscales. These findings imply a connection\nbetween people's views of gay men and lesbians' experi-\nences and the breadth of their description of the acceptance\nof homosexuality. Future research can further explore this, as\nwell as address an unanticipated finding. The participants\nwho agreed with the items on the Paternalistic subscale also\ntended to endorse fewer acceptance items, though this cor-\nrelation was not significant. Because the items on this sub-\nscale imply that gay men and lesbians face discrimination,\nwe expected the opposite relationship.\nThe results of the analyses with the demographic variables\nprovided indirect support for the possible impact of beliefs and\ndiscourses, in that the participants with more experience with\nor exposure to gay men and lesbians endorsed more of the\nTollini and Herbstrith 9\nitems. More specifically, the nonheterosexual participants had\na significantly higher average than the heterosexual partici-\npants, and the averages also increased with the number of gay\nmen and lesbians the participants knew. Although members of\nthe university's LGBTQA student organization also had a\nhigher mean score than nonmembers, indicating that organiza-\ntional membership may also affect participants'descriptions of\nacceptance, this difference was not significant. Future research\ncan further explore the apparent impact of sexual orientation\nand interaction with gay men and lesbians, both to determine\nwhy only these items and not organizational membership\naffected participants' endorsement and whether participants\nwith different nonheterosexual identities and levels of experi-\nence are more likely to endorse certain items. The analyses\ncomparing the nonheterosexual and heterosexual participants\ndid not reveal specific items that nonheterosexuals were more\nlikely to endorse than heterosexuals, as nonheterosexuals were\nmore likely to endorse every item, and the data did not allow\nfor similar comparisons for members and nonmembers or for\npeople who did and did not know gay men and lesbians.\nAdditional research is certainly needed as this study was\npreliminary and essentially the first one that directly addressed\nthis topic. At the very least, additional research is needed to\ndetermine whether the results of the various analyses can be\nreplicated with other samples, including people who are not\ncollege students and samples with higher response rates.\nComparative analyses of the subsamples, which are available\nupon request, indicated that the participants from the psychol-\nogy pool were generally less likely to endorse the items than\nthe other participants. Because the subsamples in this study\nhad significantly different responses, replication would\nappear to be particularly important, as it would indicate how\ncommon the responses presented above are.\nFuture research is also needed to further test the items.\nThe fact that all of the participants did not select one of the\nagree categories for any of the items, particularly the one\naddressing legal equality, appears counterintuitive, as we\nwould assume that essentially everyone would endorse legal\nequality as a part of their descriptions of acceptance. This\nconcern has been allayed by the results of a small, separate\ninterview project we conducted, in which the seven partici-\npants did not mention the same topics. Even so, it would be\nbeneficial to have corroborating data from other samples.\nFuture research could also alter the wording of the accep-\ntance items so they are consistently in the same tense and, in\nso doing, explore the possible impact of the mismatching\ntenses in the questions used in the current study.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdolfsen, A., Jurjen, I., & Keuzenkamp, S.
