(Barkow, Cosmides\nWhat combination of selective forces caused the appearance of the various unique and\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\ndistinctive features of humans and their social life? (Alexander, 1990b; Baumeister, 2005).\nMany social science subjects are developing their fields of inquiry within such an\nevolutionary framework, including evolutionary biology, evolutionary ecology,\nevolutionary psychiatry, evolutionary psychology and cognitive archeology. In this paper\nwe ask: How has human information behavior evolved? We also explore the relationship\nbetween information behavior, as a socio-cognitive ability, and human evolution.\nAlexander's Ecological Dominance and Social Competition (EDSC) model\ncurrently provides the most comprehensive overview of human traits in the development of\na theory of human evolution, sociality and socio-cognitive abilities (Alexander, 1971, 1979,\nIrons, 2005). Alexander's model provides a basis for explaining the evolution of human\ncognitive abilities as it centers on the ecological dominance of humans in nature and their\ncompetence in social competition. Humans have become ecologically dominant via\nincreased inter and intra group competition and cooperation, and have developed various\nprovide an extensive overview of the strengths and weaknesses of Alexander's Model for\nfields such as evolutionary psychology and anthropology, and highlight the validity of\nAlexander's Model with support from the human fossil record and findings from studies of\nthe human brain and mind.\nIn this paper we briefly outline two views of human evolution, and then describe\nwhat is meant by a human socio-cognitive ability which is a uniquely human attribute\n(Alexander, 1990b). We then propose that information behavior is an important socio-\ncognitive ability and describe what is meant by the term information behavior from the\nperspective of information science, information theory/processing, evolutionary\npsychology and the emerging information behavior perspective. The paper then discusses\nhow information behavior is emerging as an important human socio-cognitive ability from\nan interdisciplinary perspective. Such reviews are a useful way of understanding the\ninterdisciplinary relations between fields incorporating evolutionary perspectives (Krill,\nHuman Evolution: Two Views\nInformation behavior is a uniquely human attribute that differentiates humans from\nother mammals due to unique attributes of the human brain. Somewhere along the\nevolutionary line the human brain diverged from that of other mammals. There are various\ntheories as to why this is so. One theory is that there is qualitative difference between the\nhuman brain as it is now and what it was in pre-human form. Spink and Cole (2006) refer\nto what is termed a great leap-type neurological transformation in the human brain (Ehrlich,\ncognitive architecture (Mithen, 1988, 1996) and enhanced working memory (Wynn and\n(1996), this dramatic transformation allowed Homo sapiens to survive while Neanderthals\ndid not. Human hunter-gatherers became dramatically more efficient in exploiting their\nenvironment, more able to cope with environmental extremes, and more flexible in social\nbehavior (Mithen, 1988). Mithen's Great Leap forward theory is a radical form of the\ntheory of punctuated equilibria which holds that evolutionary transformations took place in\nsudden, radical steps (Gould and Eldredge, 1977).\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\nThe opposite view of human brain evolution argues that the difference between the\npresent day human brain and that of our mammal and primate ancestors can be explained\nby increased brain size alone. There has been a sevenfold increase in brain size relative to\nbody mass from ape to present day human (Jerison, 1973). Often called \"the strong form of\nthe encephalization hypothesis\" or the unitary hypothesis (Donald, 1991, p. 106).\nAccording to this hypothesis, there was one evolutionary adaptation only in human\nevolution, that of brain size, with the gradual increase in size\nIn the Ecological Dominance and Social Competition / Cooperation (EDSC) model,\nAlexander (1990b) states that: \"During these several million years the hominid line\ndiverged far from that of the apes, especially in regard to brain size and function, and\naccompanying complexities of behavior, particularly social behavior\" (p. 3). The increased\nbrain size could have been due to a specific human behavior, with the increasing but\ngradual need for human cooperation among groups to survive in an environment where\ncompetition was not so much from the environment itself but from competition from other\ngroups. To compete and cooperate effectively, the human developed new types of behavior\nwhich in turn caused adaptations in the brain and other human physiology related to\ncommunication such as the larynx.\nAlexander (1990b) asks what sort of challenges could have caused the human\ndivergence to accelerate in its later stages. He concludes that the divergence may have been\ndue to the development of human socio-cognitive abilities. Alexander (1990b) defines\nsocio-cognitive ability as an attribute or trait that is unique and unusual to humans. These\nsocio-cognitive abilities, according to Alexander (1990b) led to human evolutionary\nphysical adaptations such as menopause, concealment of ovulation and altriciality.\nThese socio-cognitive abilities emerged and developed as humans evolved,\nallowing further selective human advantages due to these cognitive changes. Alexander\n(1990b) frames socio-cognitive abilities and human intelligence as a social tool and \"the\nhuman brain has evolved in the context of social cooperation and competition\" (p. 4).\nPhysical changes to the hominid form were caused by the brain as a social tool to increase\nintra-group cooperation in competition with other groups. Hidden ovulation, hairlessness,\nand menopause--usually such radical adaptations occur elsewhere in animal world when\nanimal entered new habitat (e.g., land to sea). But in humans it is Alexander's and other's\nview that these changes were due to social condition--brain as social tool--changing\nphysical attributes. As another example, Lovejoy (1980) argues that even the advent in\nhumans of bipedalism (standing erect), which involved huge risks (abandoning the safety\nof the trees, etc.) emerged in humans because of social stability or cooperation among\nhumans (pair-bonding, shared infant care etc.).\nIt is precisely Alexander's focus on the role he accords to society, competition and\nsocial cooperation in the development of human socio-cognitive abilities that we emphasize\nin this paper to balance the cognitive perspective of Mithen as we described in Spink and\nWhat we specifically set out to do here is to explore the notion that information\nbehavior is a socio-cognitive ability which developed as a result of both cognitive and\nsocial factors during human evolution. We highlight information behavior and the\nevolution of human cognition in terms of information behavior and information.\nThis paper next discusses socio-cognitive ability, and then outlines what is\ninformation behavior from various interdisciplinary perspectives. We then discuss how\ninformation behavior is a socio-cognitive ability that is related to and enables other socio-\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\ncognitive abilities, i.e., human ecological dominance, and social competition and\ncooperation.\nSocio-Cognitive Ability\nIn human evolution from primate to Homo sapiens, no intermediate line of species\nsurvived, which is unique in evolution. The hostile forces of the environment could not\nalone represent a challenge great enough to have caused the human-ape brain divergence\n(Alexander, 1990a,b). One view is that our human ancestors were in competition with other\nforms of hominoid (e.g., the Neanderthals), and the human brain transformed as Homo\nsapiens developed socio-cognitive abilities and cooperated together to successfully\ncompete against the Neanderthals. However, even when the Neanderthals died out the\nhuman brain continued to increase in size and functionality; in fact, the increase in size and\nfunctionality quickened. The more recent development of the human brain was caused by\nthe human need to cooperate within groups to compete against other groups of Homo\nsapiens. The \"cooperation-to-compete\" hypothesis is that only humans among and between\nthemselves could have developed a sufficiently large challenge to force the human\nadaptation process; that humans themselves became their own hostile force of nature.\nThe problems that have driven the evolution of human cognitive abilities are not\nproblems due to the physical environment but primarily social problems. Humphrey (1976)\ndescribes his hypothesis of the evolution of the brain as a social tool; the human race\nselected for individuals who were good at social manipulation (Alexander, 1990b). Dunbar\n(1993) proposes that language developed out of the need for maintain social organizations.\nEven mathematics, which is a sort of linguistic ability, is created and used to advance the\nsocial concerns of the group in competition with other, hostile groups.\nTo understand the evolution of our understanding of information behavior as a\nsocio-cognitive ability, we first discuss how the concept of information is evolving.\nInformation and information processing\nInformation\n(1991) influentially divided the definitions into three types: information-as-thing,\ninformation-as-knowledge and information-as-process. Information-as-thing is probably\nthe common conception of information--i.e., that information is additive and does not\ncreate a qualitative difference in the way the person receiving the information thinks.\nHowever, the information-as-process definition has gained favor in information science due\nin part to Brookes' (1980) influential fundamental equation which states that information\nmodifies the knowledge structure of the person receiving the information. According to\nBrookes, knowledge structures provide a mechanism that subjectively interprets sense data\nin the environment, transforming this data into information. The information-as-process\ndefinition is useful because it provides a framework for how the transformation of sense\ndata into information occurs.\nThe next section discusses how the cognitive sciences perceive information as\nprocess and explore information processing.\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\nInformation processing perspective in cognitive psychology\nInformation processing relates to the working of humans' cognitive architecture,\ninformation behavior models the behavioral manifestations of the information processing\ncognitive architecture (Atkinson and Shiffrin, 1968). The field of cognitive psychology\ninvestigates internal mental processes such as problem solving, memory, language and\ninformation processing within the context of understanding human thinking. The dominant\ntheory in cognitive psychology dealing with information is information processing theory\n(Newell, 1990). The theory concerns how the human cognitive system deals with\ninformation, how and why did it evolve with its particular characteristics.\nThe information processing view within cognitive psychology provides a useful\nframework for how humans are able to cognitively transform sense data from their physical\nand social environment into information that enables adaptive processes to occur. The\ndominant theory in cognitive psychology dealing with information is information\nprocessing theory. Information processing theory describes information flow from\nenvironmental inputs entering the human information processing system to memory\noutputs. These memory outputs can take many forms. Here we narrow the discussion to the\nprocess of how information structures are retrieved from long-term memory (LTM) in\nreaction to an environmental stimulus. These information structures enable the decoding-\ntype processing of the environmental stimulus, control how that stimulus is processed, and\nfinally how the new stimulus is encoded in LTM.\nThere are complicated, structure-oriented models of cognitive architecture\n(Anderson and Lebiere, 1998; Anderson, Taatgen and Byrne, 2005; Baddeley, Chincotta\nand Adlam, 2001; Miyake and Shah, 1999). However, for the present purposes, a well-\nknown model of cognitive architecture that describes the basic processes involved in\nhuman information processing is provided by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968). Here,\nenvironmental input is first registered in a sensory store then shifted to a buffer or memory\nstructure called the short-term memory store (STS). \"This store may be regarded as the\nsubject's working memory\" (Atkinson and Shiffrin, 1968, p. 12). In Atkinson and Shiffrin,\nthe STS can be in a separate physiological structure from LTS or simply \"a temporary\nactivation of information permanently stored in the long-term store\" (Shiffrin and\nAtkinson, 1969, p. 180). In the STS, the input is either not attended to, leading to eventual\ndecay or attended to and manipulated when appropriate stored information is retrieved from\nthe long-term memory store (LTS).\nInformation structures are retrieved from the LTS via a self-addressing memory,\nwhich can be compared to a library shelving system. In a library shelving system, books are\ngiven a call number via a classification scheme which indicates both the book's storage\nposition and the user's retrieval position on the shelf. In the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, to\nfacilitate matching the storage and retrieval system likewise \"mirror\" each other (Shiffrin\nPertinent to our article is a new environmental stimulus waiting processing in STS\nis matched to information structures in LTS via attributes or characteristics of the stimulus.\nA stimulus that is less familiar to the person takes longer to match than more familiar\nstimuli. Environmental stimuli causing humans to adapt to changing social and physical\nenvironmental conditions and their survival in that new environment are by definition\nunfamiliar to the human. Unfamiliar stimuli would have to be processed in some way,\ndespite a lack of match, probably according to the \"least effort\" principle. This favors our\nthesis that the matching mechanism between an unfamiliar environmental input and the\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\nLTS is set-up to select and retrieve social-themed information when processing new and\nunfamiliar environmental stimuli. A sort of default setting which through repeated selection\nwould become reinforced over time--thus reinforcing the \"social\" vector of evolutionary\nselection and adaptation.\nIn other words, the default setting for dealing with unfamiliar stimuli input from the\nenvironment means that the selection, adaptation and expansion of those same information\nstructures over the course of evolution will continue to be in the direction of ever more\nsophisticated \"social-themed\" information structures stored in the LTS.\nHuman information processing and the Atkinson-Shiffrin (1968) model of cognitive\narchitecture that determine cognitive information flow also determine information\nbehavior. Unresolved data and anomalies in the environment that enter the STS signal\nchanges in the human social and physical environment that may lead to thinking, problem\nsolving and learning activities that provoke information behavior. Information behavior\nplays the fundamental role of giving humans the ability to perceive changes in their\nphysical and social environment through the perception of sense data, then cognitively\ntransform this sense data into information, so that they can adapt to these changes. We have\ndefined this ability here as a human socio-cognitive ability.\nScholars from the information theory/processing perspective also discuss the role of\ninformation in human cultural evolution, and the relationship between human information\nprocessing and evolutionary theory. Stonier (1997) provides a theory of how the brain\nworks from an information systems perspective. Avery (2003) relates evolution and\ninformation theory via the second law of thermodynamics. Harms and Ruse (2004) create\nthe conceptual foundations for a science and theory of knowledge through the application\nof evolutionary theory. Yockey (2005) discusses the use of information theory and coding\ntheory in molecular biology.\nOverall, the information processing approach focuses on how the mind functions;\nfor example, how the left and right sides of the brain communicate or how fast neurons fire\n(Barkow, Cosmides and Tooby, 1992). This paper extends on the information processing\napproach to include consideration of information behavior. The next section of the paper\ndescribes what is meant by information behavior from the perspective of various scientific\nfields, including information science (non-evolutionary) evolutionary psychology and\nevolutionary information behavior.\nInformation behavior\nInformation science perspective\nThe field of information science includes the research area that studies human\ninformation related behaviors, including information seeking, information foraging,\ninformation retrieving, information organizing and information uses (Spink and Cole, 2005,\n2006). The information behavior perspective assumes that information is a cognitive\nconstruction by humans during their behavior within social, cultural and organizational\nenvironments (Spink and Cole, 2005). More specifically focused than information\nbehavior, Spink and Cole (2005) define information seeking as a sub-set of information\nbehavior that includes the purposive seeking of information in relation to a goal;\ninformation organizing behavior is the process of analyzing and classifying materials into\ndefined categories (which we extended to include human cognitive information organizing\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\nbehavior in Cole and Leide, 2006); and information use behavior involves incorporating\ninformation into an individual's existing knowledge base.\nResearch into information behavior in information science has largely built\ncontemporary non-evolutionary models incorporating concepts related to contemporary\nsocial psychology, marketing and consumer buying, have also study contemporary\ninformation behavior (Case, 2002. Information science has largely adopted a focus based\non solving the technological, psychological and social problems of the post-WWII\ninformation explosion and fulfilling Vannevar Bush's vision of the Memex machine (Bush,\n1945; Saracevic, 1999), which foresaw the development of computers and techniques that\nwould allow the more effective organization and retrieval of information (Saracevic, 1999).\nYet information behavior is a basic human behavior that has aided us in our survival\nfrom the beginning of human existence (Spink and Cole, 2005, 2006). Information science\nhas recently begun to be influenced by Evolutionary Psychology and exploring the central\nrole of information (Bates, 2005) and information behavior (Spink and Cole, 2006) as a\nmechanism of human adaptation and survival. Like the human behaviors surrounding food\nproduction, information behavior is a socio-cognitive ability facilitating adaptation and\nsurvival.\nThe next section of the paper outlines the current Evolutionary Psychology\nperspectives regarding information behavior.\nEvolutionary psychology perspective\nThe evolutionary psychology approach to information behavior has focused on the\nbehavioral aspects of humans and information behavior. Evolutionary psychologists and\nrelated researchers have written about information behaviors in an evolutionary sense. The\nhistory of information behaviors within evolutionary psychology is seen as related to the\nevolution of human behavior (Eibi-Eibesfeldt and Strachen, 1996).\nThe objective of evolutionary psychology is to explore functioning and\ndevelopment of the human mind from a human evolutionary theoretical perspective,\nincluding information behavior as a socio-cognitive ability (Barkow, Cosmides and Tooby,\nPaleolithic cultures, focusing on prehistoric cave art and the meaning that can be derived\nfrom what he and other researchers interpret as a method and mechanism for information\nstorage. Mithen (1996) advocates an interdisciplinary approach to scientific inquiry and has\nstated that \"almost all disciplines can contribute towards an understanding of the human\nKaplan (1992) as an evolutionary psychologist has written about some of the issues\ninvolved in a synthesis of humans, evolution and information. Kaplan (1992) states that\nwithin a framework of \"affective biases toward patterns of information\" he states that,\n\"...not only information in its own right, but the concern for information is considered a\nbasic part of the human makeup\" (p. 582). Kaplan (1992) sees \"concern\" as encompassing\na broad range of human affective relationships vis-\u00e0-vis information, such as \"the\nmotivation to seek information\" (p. 582) and asserts that a variety of \"human affective\nrelationships to information...remain to be identified and conceptualized\" (p. 582). Kaplan\n(1992) proposes several questions related to the nexus of humans, information, and\nevolution. He examines whether knowledge (i.e. information) has any relationship to\nhuman evolution.\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\nInterdisciplinary evolutionary psychologists Barkow, Cosmides and Tooby (1992)\nand Mithen (1996) discuss conceptual integration that created anchor point links with other\nfields. Tooby and Cosmides (1989) view cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology as\n\"sister disciplines\" (p. 46). They assert that \"the goal of evolutionary theory is to define the\nadaptive problems that organisms must be able to solve. The goal of psychological theory\nis to discover the information processing mechanisms that have evolved to solve them.\nAlone, each is incomplete for the understanding of human nature. Together they are\nIn addition, other evolutionary psychologists are exploring cumulating information\nbuilding as a major human ability (Coe, 2003) and the extraordinary range of information\nwe use in comparison with other species. The famous Harvard linguist Steven Pinker\n(1999, 2003) highlights the need to understand more about the extraordinary human ability\nof information transfer abilities enabled by linguistic competency.\nIn summary, various evolutionary psychology scholars are exploring information behavior.\nHowever, evolutionary psychology has not developed a coherent framework for\ninformation behavior as a socio-cognitive ability. The next section of the paper examines\nthe evolutionary information behavior perspective emerging from information science that\nis building a framework for information behavior as a socio-cognitive ability.\nEvolutionary information behavior perspective\nThe evolutionary approach to understanding information behavior is exploring the\ndevelopment of the information behaviors manifested and engaged in by humans and\nexploring how evolution shaped information behavior (Spink and Currier, 2006a, b). This\napproach is exploring how evolutionary changes in information behavior may mirror\ncognitive and societal development as humans endeavored to fulfill needs and resolve\nproblems of everyday life and survival (Spink and Currier, 2006a, and b).\nConsideration of evolutionary theory has recently emerged within the information\nSpink and Currier, 2006a, b). The nature of information (Bates, 2005) and information\nbehavior is being increasingly understood as a product of biological evolution (Spink and\nCole, 2005, 2006) within a heuristic conceptualization and interdisciplinary framework for\nexamining the nexus of human beings, information behavior's and human evolution. The\ngoal of this research is to understand how information behaviors may have changed and\nevolved across the arc of human existence and human evolution (Spink and Currier, 2006a,\nb).\nframework which encompasses an information behavior model, including information\nseeking, foraging, sense making, retrieving, organizing and use behaviors (Spink and Cole,\n2005, 2006). They argue that viewing information behavior from only one perspective, e.g.,\nthat humans are foragers for information, provides a limited understanding of information\nbehavior. Spink and Cole (2005, 2006) argue that humans engage in information seeking,\nforaging, sense making, retrieving, organizing and use behaviors at different times, and that\nthese behaviors often occur in parallel. For example, for different tasks that are being\nprocessed by a person at different information processing levels within cognition (Spink,\nCole and Waller, in press), a person may initiate an information seeking behavior and then\nswitch to information foraging and then switch to making sense of the information\nretrieved.\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\nSpink and Currier (2006a) examine the information behavior of various individuals\nfrom the past through their writings to begin the development of an evolutionary\nperspective for our understanding of information behavior, including Napoleon Bonaparte,\nCharles Darwin, Giacomo Casanova and others. They show that these persons of the past\narticulated aspects of their information behaviors, including information seeking,\ninformation organization and information use, providing tangible insights into their\ninformation-related thoughts and actions. Spink and Currier (2006b) also provide an initial\nchronological model of information behavior over human existence.\nThe underlying premise of Spink and Currier (2006b) is that: \"Among other things\nconsciousness implies the ability to think about times and places and events separated from\nour immediate personal circumstances. It implies the ability to use information from the\nsocial past to anticipate and alter the social future, to build scenarios, to plan, to think\nahead, and to anticipate possible outcomes and retain [them] to act in several alternative\nways, depending on circumstances that can only be imperfectly represented at the time the\nplans or scenarios are being made\" (p.7).\nIn summary, an important link has emerged across evolutionary psychology and\ninformation science that links information behavior and evolution. The next section extends\nthis interdisciplinary perspective further and discusses how information behavior is related\nto and is an enabling element in Alexander's Ecological Dominance and Social\nCompetition/cooperation (EDSC) model using Donald's (1991) theoretical framework.\nInformation behavior as enabler of EDSC\nAlexander's EDSC model designates human social cooperation within the group to\ncounter competition from other groups as the trigger that initiated physical\ntransformations/adaptations leading to human ecological dominance. In this article, we\ndiscuss how EDSC is driven by information problems related to intra group cooperation\nand inter group competition, leading to the need to gather, process, sort, organize and use\ninformation about the ecology, sociality, morality, creation of culture, competition and\ncooperation elements of human existence. Information behavior may have evolved as a\ngeneral adaptive protection from hostile forces and to enable human survival and\ncompetition/cooperation.\nInformation behavior is an adaptation based on a developing cognitive schema,\nhuman language systems/symbols that evolve within an individual based on innate\ndispositions, developmental learning, and human culture. Information behavior evolved as\na survival imperative that drove the need to collect, synthesize and use information about\nkin, during warfare about competitors, collaborators, mating strategies and sexual\nreproductive partners. Information behavior via environmental scanning and human\ncommunication is reflected in cave art (Mithen, 1996) and other forms of information\nstorage.\nHumans developed a unique socio-cognitive ability to cognitively create\ninformation that they then store, organize, retrieve and used. There is a critical need to\nunderstand and incorporate information behavior into an evolutionary and life-span\nunderstanding of human behavior. We begin this process by discussing the human brain as\na social tool and information behavior as a socio-cognitive ability inside the framework of\nDonald's (1991) seminal description of the evolution of the human brain due to human\nsocial forces of cooperation/competition.\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\nUsing Donald's (1991) approach, in the next section we propose an evolutionary\nframework model for EDCS.\nEvolutionary Framework for EDSC: Episodic, Mimetic and Theoretic.\nDonald (1991) in his seminal book \"The Origins of the Modern Mind\" gives a\nunitary theory framework for EDSC and information behavior as a socio-cognitive ability.\nObeying the unitary theory of the human brain's evolutionary development, the essence of\nhis thesis is that the human brain expanded in size but always had the cognitive architecture\ncapability for the sophisticated form of thinking we have today--\"a single adaptation--\nbrain-size--would suffice to trigger the novel cognitive capacities of humans\" (Donald,\nDonald (1991) divides the brain's evolution into three transitions, but with only one\nadaptation (increase in brain size). These transitions represent the evolution of human\ncognitive development from one way of modeling or representing the world around them to\na more complex way of thinking that allows more complex modeling. These transitions are:\nthe episodic to mimetic culture, the mimetic culture to mythic culture, and the mythic to the\ntheoretic culture, which is based on memory storage system (language and the rise of\nwriting). Episodic is what we share with apes and other primates.\nThe key to the brain's evolution was the human need for social communication.\nDonald (1991) operationalized social communication in terms of our cognitive architecture\nas the ability to create a whole object out of discrete elements in an increasing complex\nnarrative that was primarily developed for social reasons; for cooperation and control\nwithin groups to better compete and survive against outside groups. This social drive drove\nthe evolution of the human brain because social communication required an ever increasing\ncomplexity in methodology of human integration of the disparate elements of human\nexistence into a coherent narrative.\nGreat Leap forward theories of brain evolution such as the aforementioned Mithen\nmark the great adaptation, when humans acquired language, between Homo erectus and\nHomo sapiens. Donald differs from these theories because he sees the transition to\nlanguage as a logical extension of Homo erectus when what he calls the Mimetic stage of\nhuman brain evolutionary development occurred. According to Donald (1991), the\ndifference between this Mimetic stage of Homo erectus and the theoretic stage of Homo\nsapiens can be explained by a normal evolutionary transition of the human brain based on\nnatural selection. The important feature to underline in Donald's theory is that vestiges of\nall three transitionary stages of brain evolutionary development are still present in the\nhuman brain (Donald, 1991), influencing information behavior. As these vestiges are taken\ninto account in our model of EDSC, we will briefly describe each of these three transitions\nin the next sections.\nEpisodic Culture: Donald (1991) creates a classification of representational strategies based\non the evolutionary stages of the human brain according to the representations of human\ncognition; these are forms of mental models that allow humans to store information, that\norganize their cognitive processes, and that direct human behavior, including information\nbehavior. Humans and most other mammals create episodic memory representations; these\nare unreflective, concrete, immediate, short-term, situation-bound representations of what\noccurs in front of the mammal's perceptual system. Apes, for example, can remember\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\nsigns for events and things if they are thoroughly taught these things, but their\nrepresentation strategy is based on previous episodes of the same event or thing. The\nepisodic mind can, however, juxtapose discrete or separate objects into a perceived\nsituation, giving it extreme power and utility in human day to day life. For humans, \"the\ntype of memory that is important in social relationships is, above all, episodic memory\"\nEpisodic to Mimetic Culture: The first transition in the evolution of the human brain was\nfrom episodic to a mimetic representation capability, a transition which distinguished\nhumans from other mammals. The mental modeling becomes much more sophisticated\nwhere instead of specific events or situations human experience is modeled into some form\nof integrated form. An illustration of the \"integrative capability of mimesis\" is creating,\nduplicating and passing on rhythmic expressions of human experience (Donald, 1991).\nMimetic modeling is involved in the \"invention and practice of sport, games, dance, ritual,\nand craft\" but without verbal thought as mimetic culture is nonlinguistic. Donald\nhypothesizes that Mimetic skill developed for social reasons, but in any case once it was\nestablished Mimetic skill led to advances in cultural development; it provided society with\nthe skill to model itself (Donald, 1991). Mimetic culture is extremely useful today in civic\nand religious rituals where collective thought occurs; such exchanges are more common\nthan most modern humans think (Donald, 1991). Mimetic expression was present in Homo\nerectus in games, tool making and ritual and standardized gestures done in a social setting.\nMimetic representational capacity in Homo erectus, according to Donald (1991), set the\nstage for semantic memory storage, symbols, and the theoretic mind of Homo sapiens. In\neffect, mimetic representations serve as an interim stage between episodic and symbolic\ncultures in human brain development--i.e., the development of tools, for example, would\nhave required some form of rudimentary symbolic representation to pass on the skill to the\nnext generation.\nMimetic to Mythic Culture: The social role--i.e., to promote social cohesion and\ncooperation--of Mimetic skill was reinforced, according to Donald (1991), by the invention\nof myth. A society myth is a conceptual model of the human universe or existence inside\nthe objective or physical environment. Myth builds up over generations and is the narrative\nfor a specific human social group to be used to compete against other groups \"In\nconquering a rival society, the first act of the conquerors is to impose their myth on the\nconquered\" (Donald, 1991, p. 258). The power positions in that society are those who\nuphold and control the parameters of the group's predominant myth, the priests and\nshamans. The Mimetic skill is \"the prototypal, fundamental, integrative mind tool\"\n(Donald, 1991, p. 215), both at the level of the individual in the society and, more\nimportantly, for the social group itself, unifying its members to compete against other\ngroups it comes into contact with. The increasing size and complexity of larger social\ngroups, which could defeat smaller social groups they were in competition, required more\nefficient social relationships; they needed to be conceptualized and controlled. Language\ndeveloped to facilitate myth development and transmission, not as it is commonly\nconceived the other way around: \"The most important source of selection pressure for an\nimproved vocal apparatus would have been a mind that needed the features of vocal\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\nTheoretic Culture: Language was an adaptation \"that met specific cognitive and culture\nneeds,\" which can be specifically labeled as \"the formalization and unification of thought\nand knowledge\" into theoretic systems (Donald, 1991, p. 216). Theoretic thinking was a\nmuch more powerful form of thinking than what had come before in the Mimetic culture.\nTheoretic culture includes analytic thought, grammatical invention, memory-management\nskills, attentional algorithms and the development of theories linking concepts together in\nabstract thought (Donald, 1991, p. 378). Theoretic concepts create symbols such as the\nequal sign that are what Gregory (1981) calls \"mind-tools\", which capture a nascent mental\nmodel for a concept, allowing it to be used for storage, cognitive manipulation leading to\ngenerative information/knowledge processes.\nMythic to Theoretic Culture: The adaptive pressure driven by natural selection favored\nsocial groups with the greatest ability to symbolically model the world around them in a\ndistinctively human reconstruction of reality. This is speeded up by human drive to increase\nthe size of external memory in written text and computer systems.\nModel of Information in EDSC and Information Behavior\nFigure 1 starts from Alexander's (1990b) EDSC model and the centrality of man as\na social being in our evolutionary story, we model Donald's (1991) unitary theory of\nhuman brain evolution. Donald's (1991) theory provides an overview of the evolution of\nhuman cognition based on knowledge structures stored in the human LTS. These\nknowledge structures provide information processing mechanisms in the STS for decoding\nand encoding operations in human memory which take place when environmental stimuli\ninput enters the cognitive system.\nAccording to this thesis, human brain evolution is driven forward by inter-group\ncompetition leading to intra-group social cooperation, which over the course of human\nevolutionary history has created an ever more complex human ability to create mental\nmodels of the human physical and social environmental and the place of humans in that\nenvironment. The driving force of this evolution is to form the integration of human\nexperience into a coherent narrative of human existence. This narrative enables social\ncohesion within the group to more effectively compete against the other groups competing\nfor limited resources.\nIn Figure 1 we model the human socio-cognitive ability as a system of inputs and\noutputs. The inputs are sense data from the physical and social environment, anomalies and\nknowledge from the social group and the individual. The outputs are greater social\ncooperation leading to increased efficiency when competing with outside groups for limited\nenvironmental resources. The integrative mind tools are located in the middle of Figure 1\nand act as propulsions for transforming input data, anomalies and knowledge into social\ncooperation/competition outputs. We have listed the integrative mind tools systems of\nthinking capabilities vested in the human brain at various points over the course of human\nevolution, from episodic culture early on in evolution to theoretic culture in the present day.\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\nFigure 1: Information behavior framework: a socio-cognitive ability\nAccording to Donald (1991), these systems alternate control with each other\ndepending on the circumstances, driving information behavior. Cognitive aspects of human\nsocio-cognitive ability are briefly referred to at the top of Figure 1. Donald (1991)\nhypothesizes that while primates, as well as humans, have episodic memory (i.e., memory\nfor discrete events); the semantic drive to integrate the events of human existence into some\nsort of coherent narrative is a feature of cognition.\nIntegrative Mind\nMyth: Social\nTheoretic: Symbolic\nsystem: Cognitive\nData (informal,\nunsystematic,\nInputs\nKnowledge (positive\nOutputs\nMimetic System:\nsocial cohesion\nEpisodic System\nWhole: semantic brain\nInformation Behavior\nCooperatio\nAnomalies (negative\nDiscrete: episodic\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\nIn the Figure 1 model, we rely on two major components:\n1. that the evolution of the human brain is driven by human modeling of the\nenvironment by integrating discrete events and things together into an increasingly\ncomplex narrative; and\n2. that all phases of brain development are still present influencing information\nbehavior, the focus of the model, and should thus be accounted for in our model\nThis evolutionary perspective on information behavior and what constitutes\ninformation is a significant new view for information science. All phases of human\nevolution are present and operating in the human mind we have now, indicating that the\nepisodic, mimetic, myth and theoretic minds all contribute tools to the human arsenal to\nachieve the evolutionary outputs of cooperation and competition.\nIn the hybrid scheme proposed here, the functional locus of \"consciousness\" can\nshift, depending upon the representational system currently in command\" (Donald,\nAn important conclusion is that all four types of minds motivate information\nbehaviors.\nConclusion and further research\nIn this paper we have incorporated models and theories that highlight information\nbehavior as primarily a social construct, driven by a survival mechanism that found its\ncompetition for survival in other human social groups rather than the environment itself as\nwas the case with all other species. The evolution of social cultures created different human\nmethods of representing and modeling human thought, and the transition from one socially\nderived method of mental modeling, from episodic to mimetic to myth to theoretic, drove\nbrain development. Social cultures exist in the present human brain and thus influence\ninformation behavior.\nIn this paper we sketched the way intra-group cooperation to survive against inter\ngroup competition drives evolution. There is a communication aspect to creating\ncooperation. It drives the human to put a coherent narrative of human existence into\nsymbolic form so that it can be communicated to others in the group. Information behavior\nin terms of both inputs and outputs as described in Figure 1 takes on various forms to\nfurther this communication drive. Information behavior is a socio-cognitive ability which\nhumans have various aptitudes for; but on the level of Homo sapiens it is a species socio-\ncognitive ability that has ensured human cooperation, competition and survival, and lead to\nthe increased pace of our evolution in an environment where there are no rival species.\nFurther theoretical and empirical research is needed to more fully explore these\nissues and examine the nature of information behavior as a socio-cognitive ability to fully\ngrasp the relationship between information behavior and evolution. The evolutionary\napproach to understanding information behavior represents a significant intellectual shift\nthat promotes connections between the human past and present, and at all way stations\nalong the human evolutionary path. This approach reshapes the frame and refines the lens\nthrough which humans are able to look holistically at their past, present, and future\ninformation behavior's in a temporally-expanded information-relevant context.\nInformation behavior: a socio-cognitive ability\nReferences\nAlexander, R.D.
