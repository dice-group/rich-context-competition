Examples\nof such models include Villages, Naturally Occurring\nRetirement Community (NORC) Supportive Service\nPrograms, and Supportive Communities (Berg-Warman &\nBrodsky, 2006; Greenfield, Scharlach, Lehning, & Davitt,\n2012). Despite the emergence of these place-based initia-\ntives, there is still little research on the implications of neigh-\nbor relationships for psychological well-being. Research has\ncontinued to mainly focus on the role of families, or social\nrelationships in general, in the lives of older adults.\nTo address the lack of research in this area, we used\nDevelopment in the United States (MIDUS) to examine\nassociations between continuity and change in neighbor\nrelationships and psychological well-being among adults in\nmiddle and later life. Guided by a multidimensional frame-\nwork on social relationships, as well as on psychological\nwell-being, we explored whether either aspect of neighbor\nrelationships (frequency of contact and perceived support) is\nespecially important for particular dimensions of well-being\n(negative affect, positive affect, and eudaimonic well-being).\nMeaning of Relationships With Neighbors\nClassic theorizing on the significance of neighbor rela-\ntionships traditionally has emphasized their instrumental\nvalue. According to the theory of shared functions (Litwak\nand Szelenyi, 1969), neighbors are best suited for tasks that\nrequire proximity, immediacy, and menial instrumental\ntasks. Cantor (1979) also posited that neighbors are \"third\nin line\" behind family and friends to provide assistance to\nolder adults. Recent qualitative studies have further high-\nlighted the significance of helping among neighbors, with\nparticular attention to anticipated support. In-depth inter-\nviews with older adults have found that neighbors are per-\nceived as being especially important in case of an emergency\nand that being able to rely on neighbors can reduce con-\ncerns regarding personal safety (Lau, Machizawa, & Doi,\nHiller, 2007). Studies of caregiving among neighbors sug-\ngest that, most typically, neighbors assist each other with\ninstrumental and nonintimate tasks, such as bill paying\nGreenfield and Reyes\nand transportation, although in some cases, they also are\ninvolved in personal care (Barker, 2002; Nocon & Pearson,\nMore recently, scholars have described the role of neigh-\nbors beyond their instrumental value. Some studies have\nindicated ways in which neighbors socialize with each\nother without exchanging any instrumental support. For\nexample, observational and interview studies of older adults\nwithin their community indicate that neighbors' spontane-\nous interactions with each other in public spaces--such as\nat restaurants--provide a sense of community, structure\nand purpose, friendship, humor, and an outlet for personal\nexchanged support among neighbors suggest that although\nthe degree and complexity of help exchanged varies, neigh-\nbors who provide each other support typically are engaged\nin some degree of social activity with each other, such as\nNeighbor Relationships and Psychological Well-being\nDespite a preponderance of population research demon-\nstrating that positive social relationships are beneficial for\nindividuals' mental and physical health (e.g., Antonucci,\nUchino, 2004), quantitative studies that examine the con-\ntributions of relationships with neighbors for psychologi-\ncal well-being have been few in number. Many of these\nstudies have been conducted outside of the United States\n(e.g., Farrell, Aubry, & Coulombe, 2004; Morita, Takano,\nutilized regional or targeted samples. For example, a study of\nwidowers over the age of 60 years found that more frequent\nsocial contact with friends and neighbors was associated\nwith more positive affect and higher well-being, whereas\ncontact with children and siblings was not (Balaswamy &\nRichardson, 2001). Taylor, Chatters, Hardison, and Riley\n(2001) found that when African Americans had higher fre-\nquency of contact with neighbors, their life satisfaction and\nhappiness were greater (Taylor et al., 2001). Using popula-\ntion data from adults aged 70 and older in the Netherlands,\nCramm, van Dijk, and Nieboer (2013) found that exchang-\ning favors with neighbors and greetings among neighbors\nwere associated with higher levels of well-being.\nAlthough population studies have examined factors that\npredict the quality of relationships among neighbors (e.g.,\nCornwell, Laumann, & Schumm, 2008; Perren, Arber, &\nDavidson, 2004), few studies have used U.S. national data\nto examine associations between relationships with neigh-\nbors specifically and psychological well-being. For exam-\nple, a study by Mair and Thivierge-Rikard (2010) used data\nfrom the 1994 Americans' Changing Lives study and found\nthat higher scores on a measure that collectively assessed\nfrequency of visiting with friends, neighbors, and rela-\ntives were associated with higher levels of psychological\nwell-being among older adults. To the best of our knowl-\nedge, Shaw (2005) conducted the only study that used\nU.S. national data to examine associations between neigh-\nbor relationships specifically and one aspect of psychologi-\ncal well-being. Using cross-sectional data from adults in\nthe 1995 National Survey of MIDUS and controlling for a\nvariety of sociodemographic factors, this study found that\ngreater anticipated support from neighbors was associated\nwith a greater sense of control.\nThe Current Study\nThis study seeks to advance understanding of relation-\nships with neighbors and psychological well-being in three\nprimary ways. First, we utilized data from a longitudinal\nU.S. sample. Having a large and heterogeneous sample\nallows for statistical control of a variety of factors that\nmight render associations between neighbor relationships\nand psychological well-being as spurious. Such factors\ninclude adults' quality of relationships with family and\nfunctional health (Shaw, 2005) and sociodemographic\ncharacteristics (Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998; Ryff & Keyes,\n1995). Moreover, longitudinal data allow for drawing upon\na primary insight from life course and life span perspec-\ntives: that social relationships potentially change over time\n(Antonucci, Fiori, Birditt, & Jackey, 2010). Unlike previous\nquantitative studies, which largely have examined neighbor\nrelationships at a single point in time, our study consid-\ners that over a 10-year period, people's relationships with\nneighbors might change.\nAlso, this study examined several theoretically derived\ndimensions of psychological well-being. Guided by the\nidea that positive states of well-being are not synony-\nmous with the absence of negative states (Seligman &\nCsikszentmihalyi, 2000), we examined both positive and\nnegative affect. Negative affect involves experiences of\ndistressing moods and emotions--such as feeling sad--\nwhereas positive affect involves experiences of pleasant\nmoods and emotions--such as feeling cheerful. Moreover,\na growing body of research suggests that experiences of\npsychological well-being are not limited to affective states,\nor feeling good, but also include perceptions of how one\nis engaging with their psychosocial world, or doing well\nFollowing this theorizing, we examined eudaimonic well-\nbeing (Ryan & Deci, 2001), which addresses how adults\nview themselves with respect to important adult develop-\nmental issues, including having a sense of purpose, expe-\nriencing continued feelings of growth, and feeling mastery\nover one's own environment (Ryff & Keyes, 1995). Taken\ntogether, eudaimonic well-being addresses the extent to\nwhich adults are \"... fully functioning or optimally devel-\ning from Aristotle's classic theorizing--that well-being\nNeighbor Relationships and Psychological Well-being\nis not simply the presence of pleasure and the absence\nof \ndistress (Ryff & Singer, 2008). In other words, while\n\npositive and negative affect refer to people's feelings,\neudaimonic \nwell-being indicates their psychosocial func-\ntioning (Keyes & Annas, 2009). Eudaimonic well-being\nis consistent with an \"aging in community\" framework,\nwhich emphasizes psychosocial qualities that indicate\naging well in one's own community, such as opportuni-\nties to engage in new activities and interests, contribute to\none's \ncommunity, and leverage the environment to meet\none's needs (Scharlach & Lehning, 2013; Thomas and\nIn addition to considering multiple dimensions of psy-\nchological well-being, we also examined two dimensions of\nneighbor relationships: contact and support. Whereas contact\nis a structural aspect of social relationships, perceived support\nreflects, in part, the quality of interactions among relational\nactors (House, Umberson, and Landis, 1988). Given prior the-\norizing on the importance of relationships with neighbors both\nin terms of their instrumental utility, as well as their broader\nsociality, we expect that both dimensions of neighbor relation-\nships will be associated with better psychological well-being.\nIn summary, we posited the following hypotheses (H)\nand research question (RQ):\nAdults who experience continuously high levels of\ncontact with neighbors and adults whose contact\nwith neighbors increases over time will report better\npsychological well-being than adults who experience\ncontinuously low contact with their neighbors or who\nexperience a loss in contact with neighbors.\nAdults who experience continuously high levels of\nperceived support from neighbors and adults whose\nperceived support from neighbors increases over\ntime will report better psychological well-being than\nadults who experience continuously low-perceived\nsupport from their neighbors or who experience a\nloss in perceived support from neighbors.\nAre associations between neighbor relationships\nand psychological well-being specific to one par-\nticular aspect of relationships (contact or perceived\nsupport)?\nMethod\nA secondary data analysis was conducted with two-wave\n(T1) through random digit dial sampling of noninstitution-\nalized, English-speaking adults, aged 25\u00ad74, living in the\nUnited States. A follow-up study was conducted in 2004\u00ad\n2006 (T2). Participation at each wave involved an initial\n30-min telephone interview, followed by a self-adminis-\ntered, mail-back questionnaire.\nThe analytic sample for this study consisted of adults\naged between 40 and 70 years at T1 who also participated in\nthe study at T2. We used data from adults of at least 40 years\nof age to focus this study on people in middle and later life.\nAt T1, there were 1,848 respondents who met our initial\nanalytic sample criteria (i.e., aged between 40 and 70 years\nand completed both the self-administered questionnaire and\ntelephone interviews). By T2, 194 of these respondents were\nidentified as deceased. This yielded 1,654 potential respond-\nents at T2, of which 1,118 participated (i.e., completed both\na telephone interview and a self-administered question-\nnaire), making the longitudinal response rate 67.6%. We\nfound that participants who reported more negative affect,\nmore functional impairment, and who were black at T1 were\nmore likely to be nonrespondents at T2. Of the 1,118 par-\nticipants in our analytic sample, 4.2% (47 respondents) did\nnot have complete data across all of the variables. Given this\nsmall amount of item nonresponse, as well as no evidence\nfor systematic patterns of item missingness, we used listwise\ndeletion to handle missing data on account of item nonre-\nsponse. Tables 1 and 2 display descriptive statistics for the\n1,071 respondents included in the analytic sample.\nMeasures\nDependent variables.--At T1 and T2, negative and posi-\ntive affect were measured through a series of six items each\n(Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998), which asked respondents how\noften during the past 30 days they felt various moods and\nemotions. Items for negative affect included (a) so sad\nnothing could cheer them up, (b) nervous, (c) restless or\nfidgety, (d) hopeless, (e) that everything was an effort, and\n(f) worthless. Items for positive affect included (a) cheer-\nful, (b) in good spirits, (c) extremely happy, (d) calm and\npeaceful, (e) satisfied, and (f) full of life. These scales were\ndeveloped for use in the MIDUS based on several prior\nwidely used measures, and the six items for each were\nselected based on pretests for the MIDUS survey (see Carr,\nFriedman, & Jaffe, 2007, as well as Mroczek & Kolarz, for\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics for all Continuous Variables\nMean (SD) Range\nWell-being at T1\nWell-being at T2\nContact and support at T1\nOther at T1\nrespondents who were aged between 40 and 70 years at T1 and who participated\nin the United States.\nGreenfield and Reyes\nfurther discussion). Respondents answered each question\non a 5-point scale (1 = all the time; 5 = none of the time).\nScores on all items were averaged together and coded such\nthat higher scores indicated more negative or positive affect.\nCronbach's alpha at T2 was .84 for negative affect and .90\nfor positive affect.\nThe measure of eudaimonic well-being was a compos-\nite of participants' ratings of their psychosocial function-\ning across six interrelated domains (Ryff & Keyes, 1995),\nwhich has been used within other studies of social factors\nand psychological well-being (e.g., Bookwala & Boyar,\n2008; Human, Biesanz, Miller, Chen, Lachman, & Seeman,\nwith three items, including purpose in life (\"I have a sense\nof direction and purpose in life\"), environmental mastery\n(\"In general, I feel I am in charge of the situation in which\nI live\"), personal growth (\"For me, life has been a continu-\nous process of learning, changing, and growth\"), autonomy\n(\"In general, I feel I am in charge of the situation in which\nI live\"), self-acceptance (\"I like most parts of my person-\nality\"), and positive relations with others (\"People would\ndescribe me as a giving person, willing to share my time\nwith others\"). Respondents answered each question using\na 7-point scale (1 = agree strongly; 7 = disagree strongly),\nand scores were averaged together and coded such that\nhigher scores indicated more eudaimonic well-being. The\nCronbach's alpha for the 18-item scale at T2 was .83.\nRelationships with neighbors.--To measure relation-\nships with neighbors, four items were used from the self-\nadministered questionnaire at T1 to create two variables:\ncontact and perceived support. Contact with neighbors was\ncreated from two questions: \"How often do you have any\ncontact, even something as simple as saying `hello', with\nany of your neighbors?\" and \"How often do you have a\nreal conversation or get together socially with any of your\nneighbors?\". Responses were provided on a 6-point scale\n(1 = almost every day; 6 = never or hardly ever). Scores\nfor these two questions were reverse-recoded and averaged\ntogether such that higher scores indicated more frequent\ncontact with neighbors.\nPerceived support from neighbors was measured based\non responses to two items from a 4-item scale inquiring\nabout the participant's personal beliefs on neighborhood\nat T1 (Keyes, 1998): \"I could call on a neighbor for help\nif I needed it\" and \"People in my neighborhood trust each\nother.\" Respondents answered both questions on a 4-point\nscale (1 = a lot; 4 = not at all). Scores for these items were\nreverse coded and summed such that higher scores indi-\ncated higher levels of perceived support from neighbors.\nTo create variables indicating continuity and change in\nrelationships with neighbors, we conducted a median split\non the variables at T1, whereby participants were assigned\nto either the top or the bottom 50th percentile on contact\nand support at T1, as well as at T2. For contact, the median\nUsing these dichotomous scores at T1 and T2, participants\nwere then coded into one of four mutually exclusive cat-\negories for contact: continuously high contact (in the top\n50th percentile at both T1 and T2), continuously low con-\ntact (below the 50th percentile at both T1 and T2), gained\ncontact (in the bottom at T1 and in the top at T2), and lost\ncontact (in the top at T1 and in the bottom at T2). The same\nprocess was used to create a four-category variable for per-\nceived support.\nCovariates.--Measures of covariates included gender\n(female or male), education (less than high school, high\nschool graduate, some college, or college graduate and\nhigher), age, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Hispanic, or other race/ethnicity). We also\nincluded a measure of functional limitations at T1, which\nwas assessed with seven items referring to particular tasks,\nsuch as \"lifting or carrying groceries\" and \"walking sev-\neral blocks.\" Participants answered the extent to which\ntheir health limited them on each item on a 4-point scale,\nand scores were averaged together such that higher scores\nindicated greater functional limitations. Furthermore,\nTable 2.

Data are from 1,071 respondents who were aged between 40 and\n70 years at T1 and who participated in two waves of data collection for the\nused to create the multicategorical variables regarding contact and perceived\ntaken from T1 except for race/ethnicity and length of residence, which were\nused from T2.\nNeighbor Relationships and Psychological Well-being\nwe included a measure at T2 that indicated whether par-\nticipants reported living in their current residence for less\nthan 10 years, which served as a proxy for whether or not\nrespondents had moved between T1 and T2. (Because of the\nsecondary nature of this analysis, we did not have a direct\nmeasure of whether participants relocated between waves.)\nFinally, we included a measure of contact with family\nand friends, as well as a measure of perceived support from\nfamily and friends at T1. Scores on contact were calculated\nas the average of participants' responses to two questions\nregarding how often participants were in contact \"includ-\ning visits, phone call, letters, or electronic mail messages\"\nwith (a) any members of their family and (b) any of their\nfriends (1 = never or hardly ever; 6 = several times a day).\nScores on perceived support were calculated as the average\nof participants' responses to four questions regarding sup-\nport with family, as well as four parallel questions regarding\nsupport with friends, such as \"Not including your spouse or\npartners, how much do members of your family really care\nabout you?\" (Schuster, Kessler, & Aseltine, 1990; Whalen\n& Lachman, 2000). Responses were given on a 4-point\nscale, averaged together, and coded such that higher scores\nindicated more support from family and friends (1 = not at\nall; 4 = a lot).\nData Analytic Strategy\nWe estimated ordinary least squares multivariate regres-\nsion models. All models included the covariates and the\nrespective dependent variable at T1 (negative affect, posi-\ntive affect, or eudaimonic well-being) as independent vari-\nables. We standardized scores on psychological well-being\nfor ease of interpretability across the multiple dimensions.\nThe multicategorical variables indicating relationships with\nneighbors were entered as a block of three dichotomous\nvariables--continuously low, loss, and gain--with continu-\nously high as the reference group. The coefficients in the\nmodels, therefore, indicate whether people in each of the\nthree former relationship categories differ in psychologi-\ncal well-being from people who reported continuously high\ncontact or perceived support with neighbors. We first pre-\nsent models for contact with neighbors, followed by per-\nceived support from neighbors, and then a final model with\nboth contact and perceived support when prior models indi-\ncated statistically significant associations for both contact\nand perceived support.\nAs an analytic check, we tested all possible interactions\nbetween the covariates and the focal independent variables\nregarding relationships with neighbors.Across the 108 inter-\naction terms examined, only five were statistically significant\n(p < .05) and in no readily interpretable pattern. Therefore,\nwe present results for the analytic sample as a whole.\nGiven this study's focus on multiple dimensions of psycho-\nlogical well-being, we examined the correlations among the\ndependent variables. Correlations among the dependent vari-\nthe three dependent variables were related to each other as\naspects of psychological well-being, yet somewhat distinct in\nmeasuring different dimensions of psychological well-being.\nFurthermore, we examined correlations among the items\ncomprising the measure of contact with neighbors and per-\nceived support from neighbors. The correlation between the\ntwo items regarding contact was .58, and the correlation\nbetween the two items regarding perceived support was .47.\nGiven the relatively small size of this correlation, we esti-\nmated preliminary analyses to check whether multivariate\nresults differed when perceived support from neighbors was\nmeasured by either one of the two items. No differences\nwere found.\nFinally, given the multidimensional nature of the meas-\nure of eudaimonic well-being, as well as controversy over\nhow related-yet-distinct the component subdimensions are\n(see Abbott et al., 2006, for further discussion), we esti-\nmated models for each of the six subcomponents indepen-\ndently (i.e., autonomy, purpose in life, personal growth,\nself-acceptance, environmental mastery, and positive rela-\ntions with others). Results indicated that the final pattern\nof results, which used the composite measure, were overall\nconsistent across each individual subdimension.\nResults\nH1: Contact with Neighbors and Psychological Well-being\nModels 1a, 2a, and 3a in Table 3 present results from\nmultivariate regression models that examined associations\nbetween frequency of contact with neighbors and changes\nin psychological well-being over the 10-year study period.\nNo evidence of associations was found for negative affect\nor positive affect. In comparison with participants who\nreported continuously high contact with neighbors, nega-\ntive affect did not differ at a statistically significant level\namong participants who reported (a) continuously low con-\ntact (b = .010, n.s.), (b) loss in contact (b = .068, n.s.), and\n(c) gain in contact (b = -.048, n.s.). Similarly, positive affect\ndid not differ at a statistically significant level among partici-\npants who reported (a) continuously low contact (b = -.091,\nn.s.), (b) loss in contact (b = -.084, n.s.), and (c) gain in\ncontact (b = .022, n.s.) in comparison with participants who\nreported continuously high contact with neighbors.\nAssociations were found, however, with respect to\neudaimonic well-being. In comparison to participants who\nreported continuously high levels of contact with neigh-\nbors, participants who reported continuously low levels of\ncontact reported less eudaimonic well-being (b = -.178,\np < .01). Moreover, participants who reported declining\nlevels of contact with neighbors also reported poorer eudai-\nmonic well-being (b = -.151, p < .05). No difference in\neudaimonic well-being was found between participants\nwith continuously high levels of contact with neighbors\nand participants who gained in contact with neighbors\nGreenfield and Reyes\nTable 3.

Data are from 1,071 respondents who were at least 40 years old at T1 and who participated in two waves of data collection for the 1995\u00ad2005 National Survey of Midlife in the United States. All measures were\ntaken from T1 (1995) except for race/ethnicity and length of residential status at T2 (2005). Continuous variables were standardized at the sample means.\naReference categories\nTable 3 (continued)\nGreenfield and Reyes\nIn summary, these results provide partial support for H1\nregarding associations between contact with neighbors and\npsychological well-being. Participants who reported con-\ntinuously low levels of contact, in addition to participants\nwho experienced losses in contact, were at greater risk for\npoorer psychological well-being, specifically with respect\nto eudaimonic well-being.\nH2: Perceived Support With Neighbors and\nPsychological Well-being\nModels 1b, 2b, and 3b in Table 3 present results from\nmultivariate regression models that examine associations\nbetween perceived support from neighbors and changes in\nthe three dimensions of psychological well-being. Similar\nto the results for H1 regarding contact, no evidence of asso-\nciations was found for negative affect. In comparison to\nparticipants who reported continuously high contact with\nneighbors, negative affect did not differ at a statistically\nsignificant level among participants who reported (a) con-\ntinuously low support (b = .092, n.s.), (b) loss in support\n(b = .041, n.s.), and (c) gain in support (b = -.028, n.s.).\nFor positive affect, only one statistically significantt asso-\nciation was found. Participants who reported continuously\nlow levels of perceived support from neighbors reported\ncomparison to participants who reported continuously high\nsupport. Nevertheless, positive affect did not differ at a sta-\ntistically significant level among participants who reported\n(a) loss of perceived support (b = -.023, n.s.) or (b) gain in\nperceived support (b = .013, n.s.).\nAssociations also were found with respect to eudaimonic\nwell-being. In comparison to participants who reported\ncontinuously high levels of perceived support from neigh-\nbors, participants who reported continuously low levels of\nsupport reported less eudaimonic well-being (b = -.295,\np < .001). Moreover, participants who reported declining\nlevels of perceived support from neighbors also reported\npoorer eudaimonic well-being (b = -.202, p < .01). No dif-\nference in eudaimonic well-being was found between par-\nticipants with continuously high levels of perceived support\nfrom neighbors and participants who gained in perceived\nsupport from neighbors (b = -.094, n.s.).\nIn summary, these results provide partial support for H2\nregarding associations between perceived support from neigh-\nbors and psychological well-being. Participants who reported\ncontinuously low levels of perceived support were at greater\nrisk for less positive affect and less eudaimonic well-being.\nParticipants who reported loss in perceived support were espe-\ncially at risk for having lower levels of eudaimonic well-being.\nRQ: Associations With Respect to Specific Aspects of\nRelationships With Neighbors\nTo examine whether contact and perceived support\nfrom neighbors are independent predictors of eudaimonic\nwell-being, we estimated a final regression model (Table 3,\nModel 3c) in which the multicategorical variables for con-\ntact and support were both included as independent vari-\nables. In this model, participants who reported continuously\nlow perceived support, as well as those who reported loss in\nperceived support, demonstrated poorer eudaimonic well-\np < .01, for loss). However, associations between continu-\nously low levels of contact, as well as loss in contact, and\neudaimonic well-being were reduced in size and no longer\nstatistically significant (b = -.102, n.s, for continuously\nlow; b = -.105, n.s, for loss). In summary, these results\nsuggest that perceived support from neighbors is a more\nrobust predictor of eudaimonic well-being than contact with\nneighbors.\nDiscussion\nThis study used U.S. population data to examine link-\nages between continuity and change in relationships with\nneighbors over a 10-year period and psychological well-\nbeing among midlife and older adults. Guided by a mul-\ntidimensional perspective on social relationships (House,\nUmberson, & Landis, 1988), as well as on psychological\nwell-being (Ryff, 1989; Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi,\n2000), our study examined relationships with neighbors\nin terms of contact and perceived support, as well as psy-\nchological well-being in terms of negative affect, positive\naffect, and eudaimonic well-being. Overall, results indi-\ncated the importance of high levels of perceived support\nfrom neighbors for maintaining optimal levels of eudai-\nmonic well-being.\nMore specifically, evidence was found that participants\nwho had continuously low levels of contact or perceived\nsupport from neighbors over the 10-year study period,\nas well as those who lost contact or perceived support,\nwere at risk for poorer eudaimonic well-being over time.\nParticipants who experienced gains in relationships with\nneighbors had comparable levels of eudaimonic well-being\nin comparison with those who maintained continuously\nhigh levels of contact or perceived support with neighbors.\nThis pattern of results emerged even after accounting for\na variety of factors that could render such associations as\nspurious, such as gender, age, and contact and support from\nfamily and friends. Although prior theorizing on neighbors\nhas suggested this relationship to be a more peripheral\nsocial tie for adults in the United States relative to family\nand friends (e.g., Cantor, 1979), qualitative studies have\nindicated that neighbors can serve as a central source of\nsupport and meaning in adults' lives (Gardner, 2011) and\nthat people experience a sense of loss when such social\nnetwork members move away, die, or become unavailable\nFindings from this longitudinal, population-based study\nprovide support for these ideas.\nNeighbor Relationships and Psychological Well-being\nAccordingly, our study contributes additional empirical\nsupport for the importance of formal community initia-\ntives that aim to help people develop and maintain strong\nrelationships with neighbors. Results add nuance to this\ndirection by suggesting that such initiatives are especially\nimportant for promoting the more positive aspects of\nadults' psychological well-being. Although no associations\nbetween relationships with neighbors and psychological\nwell-being were found for negative affect, one association\nwas found for positive affect, and several associations were\nfound with respect to eudaimonic well-being. This pattern\nof findings suggests that supportive neighbor relationships\nare especially important for the positive and more develop-\nmental and functional aspects of mental health in middle\nand later life.\nOverall, findings support an \"aging in community\"\nframework (Thomas & Blanchard, 2009), which empha-\nsizes developing supportive relationships among commu-\nnity members not only for the sake of mitigating potential\nproblems in later life but also for promoting optimal func-\ntioning and quality of life. In other words, results indicate\nthat although strong ties with neighbors might not ward off\nfeelings of depression, they can yield psychological gains\nby helping people to feel fully engaged in adult develop-\nmental tasks, such as maintaining a sense of purpose and\nfinding opportunities for continued personal growth.\nThe domain specificity of associations between relation-\nships with neighbors and psychological well-being can help\nto provide insight into somewhat competing theories on the\nconsequences of social network changes in later life. On the\none hand, classic social scientific and gerontological theory\nsuggests that greater social integration--in terms of having\nmore social relationship partners, a greater number of social\nroles, and engaging in more social activities--should be\nassociated with psychological benefits (Adelmann, 1994).\nOn the other hand, contemporary life-span developmental\ntheory, specifically socioemotional selectivity theory, sug-\ngests that an overall shrinking of one's social network in\nlater life does not necessarily jeopardize well-being (English\n& Carstensen, 2014). This perspective posits that fewer\nperipheral social relationships result from a motivational\nshift when people change how they perceive the amount of\ntime in their lives; when viewing one's lifetime as more lim-\nited, people orient toward relationships, goals, and pursuits\nthat are most meaningful to them (Carstensen, Isaacowitz,\n& Charles, 1999). Results of this study demonstrate that\nlosses within more secondary relationships--such as those\nwith neighbors--might not jeopardize more emotion-based\naspects of well-being but still can jeopardize engagement-\nbased and developmental aspects of well-being. Insomuch\nthat eudaimonic well-being refers to how well one is func-\ntioning, results suggest that neighbors are indeed a salient\npart of many adults' \"psychosocial worlds.\" At the same\ntime, these relationships might not be as psychologically\ncentral as other ties--such as those with family and close\nfriends--to influence one's moods and emotions across\nan extended period of time. Future research that focuses\non continuity and change within a greater variety of social\nrelationships is necessary to examine the extent to which\nassociations between losses in social relationships and psy-\nchological well-being are specific to particular dimensions\nof well-being and domains of relationships.\nIn addition to highlighting the importance of relation-\nships with neighbors for eudaimonic well-being, results also\nsuggest that perceived support with neighbors is especially\nsalient in middle and later life. Although not an explicit\nhypothesis of our study, results for eudaimonic well-being\nprovided evidence for perceived support as a mediator of\nthe associations between contact and well-being, given that\nassociations between perceived support and eudaimonic\nwell-being accounted for the associations between contact\nand eudaimonic well-being. These results suggest that con-\ntinuously low levels of contact with neighbors is associated\nwith eudaimonic well-being because these participants have\nless perceived support from neighbors.\nFindings for the relatively greater importance of per-\nceived support in comparison with contact are consistent\nwith findings from prior studies that have examined other\noutcomes. For example, Shaw (2005) found that anticipated\nsupport from neighbors, but not contact, was predictive of\nfewer physical limitations. This pattern of results might be\nexplained by the differences between social processes versus\nstructure. Whereas contact is a structural aspect of social rela-\ntionships, perceived support is a process, which explains how\nthe relationship was developed, how it is maintained, and its\ndemands (House, Umberson, & Landis, 1988). Processual\naspects of social relationships are likely important elements\nof the pathways through which relationships with neighbors\ninfluence adults' psychological well-being over time.\nDespite the strengths of this study, including its use of\nlongitudinal national U.S. data, limitations render some of\nits conclusions as tentative. For one, our sample consisted\nof mainly white and highly educated people. This lack\nof diversity limits our ability to generalize these findings\nacross more racially/ethnic and socioeconomically diverse\npopulations. Given prior studies' findings on racial/ethnic\ndifferences in the experiences of neighbor relationships\nTaylor et al., 2001), examining the implications of neighbor\nrelationships in middle and later life with more racially/eth-\nnically diverse samples is essential.\nFurthermore, for the sake of analytic parsimony, this\nstudy examined relationships with neighbors independent\nof many factors that are associated with adults' psychologi-\ncal well-being, such as educational status, age, and func-\ntional limitations. Given the lack of available measures, we\nalso were unable to test subgroup differences by commu-\nnity characteristics, such as urban versus rural, which has\nbeen the focus of some prior research (Mair & Thivierge-\nRikard, 2010). Future studies guided by theory and research\nGreenfield and Reyes\non potential subgroup differences in neighbor relationships\nare necessary to address questions regarding the conditions\nunder which neighbor relationships matter the most. One\nparticularly important direction for such research is to draw\nupon social network techniques to examine how neighbor\nrelationships might influence individual well-being in the\ncontext of other potentially salient social relationships (see\nFiori, Antonucci, & Cortina, 2006). Such research might\nconsider not only primary ties with family and friends but\nalso more peripheral social relationships, such as those with\ncoworkers, service providers, leisure partners, and co-con-\nAnother limitation was the items used to measure per-\nceived support from neighbors. Given the secondary nature\nof the analysis, our study only had two questions availa-\nble to measure this construct, which limited the reliability\nof this measure specifically. We also lacked the ability to\nmeasure the quality of contact (both positive and negative\ninteractions) and received support, which previous studies\nhave found to be associated with psychological well-being\nin ways that differ from overall contact and perceived sup-\nFinally, although this study used longitudinal data over a\n10-year period, it presents correlations between changes in\nneighbor relationships and changes in psychological well-\nbeing. It is possible that declining levels of well-being pre-\ncede changes in relationships with neighbors (e.g., declining\nlevels of well-being cause losses in perceived support and\ncontact with neighbors), making it infeasible for this study\nalone to completely separate processes of causation from\nselection. Also, systematic differences in longitudinal attri-\ntion might bias the figures presented in this study (see\nRadler & Ryff, 2010, for a full discussion of attrition in the\nMIDUS study).\nDespite these limitations, findings provide support, in\npart, for current initiatives that focus on developing strong\nrelationships among neighbors to promote well-being in\nlater life. In addition to specific neighborhood-based aging\nservices program models--such as the Village model and\nNORC programs (e.g., Greenfield et al., 2012)--leading\nframeworks for age-friendly communities emphasize the\nimportance of opportunities for older adults' social par-\nticipation and inclusion in activities with other community\nmembers (Fitzgerald & Caro, 2013). Results of this study\nsuggest the need to foster more supportive neighborhoods\nwhere contact among neighbors is not only frequent but also\nsupportive and fostered over time. Findings also indicate\nthat enhancing relationships among neighbors is especially\npromising for optimizing developmental aspects of adults'\npsychological well-being. Continuing to advance research\non the diverse processes and contexts through which neigh-\nbor relationships influence individual outcomes will help\nto better fulfill the promise of these relatively overlooked\nrelationships as a potential resource for aging individuals\nand society.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by grants from the National Institute on Aging\n# 60184--Internship to Diversify Perspectives in Health Research [Project\n"
