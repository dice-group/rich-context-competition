    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Between 5% and 30% of children in high-income countries live with a substance misusing parent, the majority of\nwhich is below dependent levels. However, little is understood about the impact of nondependent parental substance misuse\nupon children. Methods: We searched the international literature using rigorous systematic methods to identify studies\nexamining parental substance misuse and adverse outcomes in children. The inclusion criteria were cross-sectional, longitudinal,\ncase-control, and cohort studies; of children aged 0\u00ad18 years whose parents are high-risk substance misusers; reporting on their\nhealth, psychological, substance use, educational, and social outcomes. Results: We identified 36 papers (from 33 unique studies),\nmost of which were assessed as being of medium to high methodological quality (N\u00bc 28). Parental nondependent substance\nmisuse was found to be associated with adversity in children, with strong evidence of an association with externalizing difficulties\n(N \u00bc 7 papers, all finding an association) and substance use (N \u00bc 23 papers, all finding an association) in adolescents and some\nevidence of adverse health outcomes in early childhood (N \u00bc 6/8 papers finding an association). There is less evidence of an\nassociation between parental substance misuse and adverse educational and social outcomes. The body of evidence was largest\nfor parental alcohol misuse, with research examining the impact of parental illicit drug use being limited. Conclusion: Metho-\ndological limitations restrict our ability to make causal inference. Nonetheless, the prevalence of adverse outcomes in children\nwhose parents are nondependent substance misusers highlights the need for practitioners to intervene with this population\nbefore a parent has developed substance dependency.\n",

Children\nwhose parents are dependent upon substances are more likely\nto suffer an injury (Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs,\nan injury of greater severity (Damashek, Williams, Sher, &\nPeterson, 2009) and experience health problems which their\nparents may not respond effectively to (Cleaver et al., 2011).\nPreschool children are at risk of delays in cognitive and lan-\nguage development (Barnard, 2007) and greater likelihood of\neducation deficits (Royal College of Physicians, 1995). They\ngo on to have lower educational performance in adolescence\n(Kolar, Brown, Haertzen, & Michaelson, 1994), resulting in\npoor life chances (Cleaver et al., 2011). Parental substance\ndependency has been found to negatively affect the structures\nand functions of the family (Velleman & Templeton, 2007).\nThis includes disrupting family routines and rituals (Holland,\n1 Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne,\nUnited Kingdom\n2 Northumberland, Tyne and Wear Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne,\nUnited Kingdom\n3 Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nRuth McGovern, Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University,\nBaddiley-Clark Building, Richardson Road, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4AX,\nUnited Kingdom.\nEmail: r.mcgovern@ncl.ac.uk\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tva\nForrester, Williams, & Copello, 2014), affecting the quality of\nthe relationship between the parent and the child (Cleaver et al.,\nharsh parenting (Kelley, Lawreence, Milletich, Hollis, &\nHenson, 2015), higher prevalence of domestic violence and\nother traumatic events (Sprang, Staton-Tindall, & Clark,\nMany factors have been highlighted as possible mechanisms\nthat impact upon the child, these include direct exposure to\nalcohol and/or drug use and to other users (Advisory Council\non the Misuse of Drugs, 2003), ineffective parenting practices\nand a reduction in parenting capacity brought about by the\nintoxicating effect of the substance and/or withdrawal from it\nparental emotional availability and warmth (Suchman, Roun-\nsaville, DeCoste, & Luthar, 2007) as well as greater likelihood\nof experiencing trauma such as abuse or neglect as a child\n(Dube et al., 2001). Due to the potential negative impact on\nthe child, parental substance dependence is often identified as a\nrisk factor in child welfare and child protection assessments. In\nEngland, 18% of all children in need assessments identify\nparental drug misuse and 19% identify parental alcohol misuse\n(Department for Education, 2016). In the United States, par-\nental substance misuse has been associated with up to two\nthirds of all child maltreatment cases (Traube, 2012).\nmay live with a dependent opiate-using parent (Department for\nparent (Pryce et al., 2017). A far larger number of children are\nlikely to live with substance-misusing parents whose use does\nnot meet the diagnostic criteria for dependence.

In the United\nKingdom, 30% of children aged under 16 years live with at\nleast one parent who misuses alcohol and 8% with a parent who\nmisuses illicit drugs (Manning, Best, Faulkner, & Titherington,\nexposed to parental problem, drinking, or illicit drug misuse\ners are misusing alcohol 1 year after delivery (Liu, Mumford, &\nStudy Objectives\nDespite the high prevalence of parental substance misuse that is\nbelow the diagnostic criteria for dependence, little is under-\nstood about the impact of such patterns of parental substance\nmisuse upon children. As the number of children living with a\nsubstance-misusing parent is higher than those living with\na substance-dependent parent, the greatest burden of harm on\na population level is likely to be experienced by these children.\nThe furthering of knowledge in this area is fundamental to\nenable effective and early responses to address the needs of\nthe families affected. This rapid evidence assessment reviews\npublished evidence reporting on adverse health, psychological,\nsubstance use, educational, and social outcomes of children of\nnondependent substance-misusing parents. We limit our review\nto high-risk patterns of parental substance misuse.\nMethod\nThe international literature was searched in November 2016\nusing electronic databases Medline (OVID), PsychoINFO\n(OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), SCOPUS, Applied Social Sci-\nence Index and Abstract (ProQuest), International Bibliogra-\nphy of Social Science (ProQuest), ProQuest Criminal Justice\n(ProQuest), ProQuest Social Science Journals (ProQuest),\nProQuest Sociology (ProQuest), Social Service Abstracts (Pro-\nQuest), and Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest). Due to popula-\ntion flux and changes in economic conditions, we restricted our\nsearch for evidence to publications from 1998 onward. A\nsearch strategy using mesh terms, thesaurus headings, Boolean,\nand proximity operators was adapted for each database and\nimplemented.\nReview Inclusion Criteria\nTwo researchers independently screened all titles and abstracts\nusing specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, retrieving full\narticles for all potentially eligible studies and evaluating in full\ntext. Discrepancies at each stage were resolved by discussion or\nby consulting a third researcher if consensus could not be\nreached. Studies adopting a cross-sectional, longitudinal,\ncase-control, and cohort design were included if the sample\nconsisted of children aged 0\u00ad18 years whose parents were\nhigh-risk substance misusers. To be included, studies must\nreport on parental substance misuse that meets one of the fol-\nlowing criteria:\n a pattern of alcohol consumption that leads to the pres-\nence of physical or psychological problems (typically\nover 35 units per week for women and over 50 units per\nweek for men);\n frequent illicit drug misuse (more than once per month\nas defined by the Crime Survey for England and Wales);\nand\n alcohol or illicit drug abuse defined as a maladaptive\npattern of drinking/drug use, leading to clinically signif-\nicant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least\none related problem in a 12-month period (failure to\nfulfill major role obligations, use in situations in which\nit is physically hazardous, alcohol or drug-related legal\nproblems, having persistent or recurrent social or inter-\npersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects\nof alcohol or drugs; American Psychiatric Association,\nFurther, studies were required to include comparison sam-\nples of children whose parents were not substance misusers.\nThe condition of interest was adversity experienced by the\nchild defined as any negative health, psychological, child sub-\nstance use, educational, and social effect. A health harm\nincludes direct impact (e.g., brought about by accidental inges-\ntion by the child or exposure to the substance or contaminated\nenvironments) or indirect impacts (e.g., child physical injury,\nhealth service usage, fatality); psychological harm such as\ninternalizing (e.g., emotional or behavioral problems that are\nfocused inward such as depression, anxiety, dissociative\ndisorder, and eating disorder) and externalizing problems\n(e.g., behaviors that are directed toward the external environ-\nment including physical aggression, disobeying rules, and anti-\nsocial and offending behaviors); substance use by the child\nincludes early onset of alcohol and/or drug use, frequent use,\nand experience of alcohol and/or drug problems; educational\nimpact includes school attainment, punctuality, truancy, or sus-\npension; and social impact includes parent\u00adchild relationship\nquality, family functioning and home environment, parent\nsupervision, and experience of abuse.\nPapers were excluded if 50% of the parent sample were\ndependent upon substances other than tobacco (defined as\nthose with a diagnosis of dependence, in receipt of agonist\nprescribing or attendance at treatment services); insufficient\ndetail is reported for the review team to confidently assess the\ncriteria for high-risk substance misuse levels; were reporting on\na qualitative study or were not published in English. The meth-\nodological quality of each study included was assessed accord-\ning to the criteria presented in the quality assessment tool for\nsystematic reviews of observational studies (Wong, Cheung, &\nHart, 2008). This scale is based on a cumulative score across\n5 items: external validity, reporting (2 items), bias, and con-\nfounding factors. Studies achieving 67% or more in scoring\nwere regarded as high quality, 34\u00ad66% medium, and less than\n34% low quality. We have standardized the language used\nwithin the review when referring to all studies meeting the\ncriteria for high-risk parental substance misuse. We use the\nterm parental substance misuse when referring to studies that\nreport on parents who misuse alcohol and/or drugs. When the\nsource study examines only alcohol or drug misuse, we use the\nterm parental alcohol misuse or parental drug misuse, respec-\ntively. Within the tables and figures, however, we will include\nfurther clarification relating to the specific levels reported upon\nwithin the source studies.\nResults\nDescription of Studies\nWe identified 36 papers (reporting on 33 unique studies) that\nreported upon adverse outcomes of children of nondependent\nparental substance misusers. The majority (N \u00bc 17) of the\nstudies were conducted in the United States, 5 in the United\nKingdom and 12 in other European countries and two other\ncountries worldwide (Australia and Korea). The sample sizes\nmethodological quality, 15 of medium quality, and 8 of low\nquality. We have divided the adverse child outcomes into phys-\nical health, psychological well-being, child substance use, edu-\ncational, and social.

While one study\nshowed no significant impact upon the support provided to the\nchild from the parent (van der Zwaluw et al., 2008), a further\nstudy reported that children of alcohol misusing parents were\nsignificantly less likely to feel emotionally close to their father,\neither due to the impact of alcohol misuse upon the father's\nbehavior, conflict within the home, abdication of family\nresponsibilities, or estrangement (Jennison, 2014). Parental\nbonding and the parent\u00adchild relationship were negatively\nrelated to both mothers' and fathers' alcohol misuse in other\nresearch (Shorey et al., 2013). There is conflicting evidence\nthat parental monitoring is negatively associated with parental\nalcohol misuse. One study reported a significant association\nbetween parental alcohol misuse and lower levels of parental\nmonitoring (Shorey et al., 2013), while a further study reported\nthat parental alcohol misuse was unrelated to a number of\nmeasures of neglectful parenting practices (Freisthler,\nA significant association with a particularly large effect was\nshown in a high-quality study of the number of children of\nsubstance misusing mothers who were placed in care (Raitasalo\net al., 2015). Children of alcohol misusing mothers were 5\ntimes more likely to be placed in care by their seventh birthday\nthan those raised by nonalcohol misusing parents. Those born\nto drug misusing mothers were over 7 times more likely to be in\ncare by the age of 7, while children whose mothers misused\nboth alcohol and drugs faced a 9-fold increased risk. These\nrelationships persisted after controlling for the child's gender\nand mothers' socioeconomic status. Once in care, children of\nsubstance misusing mothers were discharged 183% faster than\nthose children whose mothers did not misuse substances\n(Hussey & Guo, 2005). This somewhat counterintuitive finding\nis most likely to relate to an accelerated decision to place the\nchildren in permanent care however rather than reunification of\nthe family. Further, the low quality of this study means that\nfindings should be interpreted with caution. A cohort study of\nchildren taken into care also reported on the range of abuse\nchildren may experience while living within substance misus-\ning homes (Jeffreys et al., 2009). Due to the small sample size\nin this study, no statistical testing could be conducted. As such,\nthe existence of a correlation between parental substance use\nand abuse is unknown.\nDiscussion\nIt is clear from this evidence that nondependent parental sub-\nstance misuse is associated with adversity in children. This evi-\ndence is more pronounced when both parents misuse alcohol\nand/or drugs or when one or more parents misuse a combination\nof alcohol and drugs. In early childhood (0\u00ad7 years), the evi-\ndence from high-quality studies suggests an increased likelihood\nof experiencing an injury or health concern, resulting in the need\nfor medical care. The methodological quality of studies examin-\ning an association with diet, child weight, and dental health is\nhowever of low quality and should be interpreted with caution.\nMaternal alcohol misuse in particular is highlighted as a key\npredictor for poorer child health. This may in part relate to the\ngreater role mothers tend to play in the child's early years.\nHowever, there was a paucity of research considering substances\nother than alcohol and relating to fathers' substance misuse that\nmay result in a misleading focus on mothers.\nThe literature suggests that parental alcohol misuse\nincreased the likelihood of externalizing problems in children,\nwith a significant association being reported in all studies being\nof medium or high quality. There was less evidence for an\nassociation between parental substance misuse and internaliz-\ning difficulties such as depression and anxiety. Those showing\nan association were of medium quality and involved children\nexposed to parental intoxication or where family and/or par-\nental factors are present, while a high-quality study did not find\na significant correlation.\nThere was a large and methodologically robust evidence\nbase consisting of 23 papers, all finding a significant and pos-\nitive relationship between parental alcohol and/or drug misuse\nand the child's own use. The evidence appeared particularly\nstrong in families where both parents misused substances or\nwhen the child was directly exposed to the substance misuse.\nSocial learning theory explains that we learn behavior from\nobserving, imitating, and modeling those around us (Bandura,\n1997). It is possible that when children observe their parents\nconsuming alcohol and/or drugs, it encourages the develop-\nment of normative views about substance use. Further, the\navailability of alcohol or other substances within the home may\nincrease the likelihood of adolescent use (Peeters, Koning,\nThere is emerging evidence that parental alcohol misuse is\npredictive of educational challenges including truancy, school-\nrelated behavioral problems, and lower educational attainment,\nalthough the methodological quality of these studies varied.\nThe involvement of child welfare services as well as out-of-\nhome placements for children was also higher in children\nwhose parents misuse substances. The evidence for an associ-\nation with other social and relational difficulties is however\nmixed. There was some suggestion that parental alcohol use\nwas associated with lower levels of parent\u00adchild bonding, com-\nmunication, and overall relationship quality. However, evi-\ndence of neglectful parenting or inadequate parental\nsupervision was limited and at times contradictory and as such\ncaution should be exercised when drawing conclusions regard-\ning an association between parental substance misuse and the\nquality of parental supervision. Methodological issues further\nlimit the evidence.\nSocial workers often interact with families experiencing a\nwide range of difficulties. While social workers within chil-\ndren's welfare services consider it legitimate within their role\nto ask parents about their drug and alcohol use, they experience\ndifficulty in identifying parents who are substance misusers\n(Galvani, Hutchinson, & Dance, 2013; Loughran, Honhman,\n& Finnegan, 2010). Typically, they rely upon observations of\nthe parent's physical presentation and behavior, which is\nunlikely to detect levels of misuse below the diagnostic criteria\nfor dependence (Galvani et al., 2013). Furthermore, those par-\nents who are identified as being substance misusers often do\nnot receive an intervention, with parents expressing reluctance\nto engage with specialist drug and alcohol treatment providers\nas they did not perceive themselves as having a substance\nmisuse problem (Forrester & Harwin, 2006). This suggests that\nearly, opportunistic intervention delivered by a nontreatment\nspecialist may be more appropriate.\nThere is a large amount of high-quality evidence that has\naccumulated to support the effectiveness of alcohol screening\nand brief interventions with adults who have an alcohol use\ndisorder with nondependent populations in primary care setting\nno studies examining the effectiveness of screening and brief\ninterventions with substance misusing parents including those\nwhose children are involved with child welfare services. This\nrepresents a missed opportunity to intervene with this popula-\ntion before a parent has developed substance dependency. Such\nintervention has the potential to prevent the development of\nmore problematic patterns of use and prevent harm to children.\nSocial workers should engage in conversations with parents,\nwhich promote the parent's ability to link their substance mis-\nuse with adverse experiences and risk of negative outcomes for\ntheir child. Such an interaction may replicate the \"teachable\nmoment\" found to be conducive of behavior change following\nthe delivery of brief interventions within other settings (Babor\n& Grant, 1992) and improving outcomes for children.\nLimitations\nThe evidence examined within this review provides support for\nan association between parental substance misuse and a\nMcGovern et al. 9\nnumber of adverse child outcomes at different stages of devel-\nopment. There are however some notable gaps. In early child-\nhood (0\u00ad7 years), the literature focuses upon the relationship\nbetween mothers' substance misuse and child physical health,\nwith a paucity of research examining behavioral problems,\nparent\u00adchild bonding, or preparation for school as well as the\nimpact of fathers' substance misuse. In early adolescence\n(10\u00ad13 years), there is a lack of research into child education\noutcomes, and in each stage of adolescence (10\u00ad18 years),\nthere is a lack of research into parental substance misuse and\nchild health. There is limited research that considers parental\nillicit drug misuse throughout the child's development, with the\nmajority of research examining the difficulties in children of\nalcohol misusing parents.\nDue to the inclusion of cross-sectional studies, causal rela-\ntionships cannot be determined. Such naive comparisons of\nexposed and unexposed groups cannot adequately account for\nthe many potential confounders nor precisely account for the\nmeasurement of effect (Fewell, Davey Smith, & Sterne, 2007).\nFor example, genetic predisposition (Agrawal & Lynskey,\n2008) and the interaction between genes and the environment\n(Cleveland & Wiebe, 2003) may result in intergeneration trans-\nmission of substance misuse. Alcohol permissive parenting\nadolescent monitoring (Kerr, Stattin, & Burk, 2010), lower\nparent\u00adchild relationship quality (Donaldson, Handren, &\n2013), and greater family conflict (El-Sheikh & Flanagan,\nchild substance misuse. Furthermore, the direction of a\nreported relationship cannot be determined. For example,\nwhile children's conduct difficulties could be a result of par-\nental alcohol misuse, a parent whose child has conduct diffi-\nculties may struggle to cope with their child's behavior and\ntheir alcohol consumption may increase in response. While\nlongitudinal studies can highlight the temporal associations\nbetween variables and may offer greater insight into causa-\ntion, such inferences are reliant upon the timing of the beha-\nvior in relation to the outcome. For example, studies\nexamining the impact of parental substance misuse upon\ninternalizing difficulties in children may assess children prior\nto the emergence of any symptoms or early childhood expo-\nsure to parental substance misuse may be undetected due to\nbehavior change that predates study inclusion (Katikireddi,\nFurther Research\nFurther research into the impact of parental substance misuse\nupon the child is needed to address the gaps in the evidence.\nSpecifically, research examining the various impacts of both\nalcohol and illicit drug misuse throughout the stages of the\nchild's development. Future research should include both\nfathers and mothers and be sufficiently powered to enable\nanalysis of the impact of mothers' versus fathers' use upon\nmale and female children and utilize longitudinal design,\nwith regular follow-up throughout the child's development.\nThis would offer opportunity for causal inferences and also\nenable age-related and temporal associations to emerge.\nThere is also a need for more high-quality research examin-\ning the health, educational, and social impact of parental\nsubstance misuse. The significant variation in how substance\nmisuse patterns are described within research has presented a\ngreat challenge to this review and ultimately in the further of\nknowledge in this area. There is a need for consistency in the\nuse of terminology describing levels of parental substance\nmisuse in future research.\nIn considering the evidence for the impact of nondependent\nparental substance misuse on children, focus invariably is on\nrisks. There is also a need to consider the protective factors that\nmay be present, which may enhance child resilience to harm.\nThis review has highlighted evidence that an association\nbetween parental substance misuse is greater when both parents\nare substance misusers. Put another way, the presence of one\nnonsubstance misusing parent offers some protection. Using\nthe language of protection, rather than risk, affords an oppor-\ntunity to view such protective factors as a possible intervention\nmechanism to enhance resilience. Given the evidence identi-\nfied that factors such as maternal closeness, attachment, and\nparent\u00adchild relationship quality are moderators of adversity\n(Shorey et al., 2013), future research should include a range of\nmediators and, importantly, moderators of harm, which may\ninform intervention development.\nConclusions\nThe findings of this review suggest that the vulnerability to\nadverse outcomes is not restricted to children living with\nsubstance-dependent parents. Rather, children may be affected\nby a wider continuum of harmful parental substance misuse;\nchildren who are likely to be less visible to practitioners. While\npractitioners may find it challenging to identify parents whose\nuse is not within the dependent range (Galvani et al., 2013),\nintervening early in parental risk factors including alcohol and\ndrug misuse to safeguard children has been highlighted in gui-\ndance for health, social care, and third sector partners (Depart-\nAs the number of children living with a nondependent sub-\nstance misusing parent is likely to be greater than those living\nwith a substance-dependent parent, intervening with nondepen-\ndent parents is likely to bring about most benefit to children on\na population level. Working to promote resilience and to\nenhance the child's protective factors is also important. Parents\nwho do not misuse substances are a resource to this end. More-\nover, intervening before a parent has developed a dependency\nhas the potential to prevent the development of more proble-\nmatic patterns of use and prevent harm to children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors\nreceived funding from Public Health England to undertake this rapid\nevidence assessment.\nReferences\nAdvisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.
