There is some evidence that personality changes\nin a socially desirable direction may be adaptive for physical\nhealth and longevity (Mroczek & Spiro, 2007; Turiano et al.,\n2011). Although personality has been well documented\nas a significant correlate of cognitive performance (Meier,\nPerrig-Chiello, & Perrig, 2002) across the adult life span\nhave examined whether the patterns and magnitude of person-\nality change or stability are related to cognitive performance.\nThe objectives of the current study were to examine individual\ndifferences in the stability and change of personality traits\nin relation to cognitive performance and to consider whether\nthis relationship varies by age.\nBoth personality and cognition are core aspects of adult\nbehavior and functioning, and some have considered intel-\nlectual abilities to be a subcomponent of personality\nstudies have shown that there are associations between\nthese two major domains, especially using the five-factor\nmodel of personality traits and a wide range of cognitive\ndimensions. A large body of literature has established age-\nrelated declines in cognitive abilities including short-term\nmemory, verbal fluency, executive functioning, episodic\nand working memory, as well as reaction time. Even though,\non average, abilities decline, there are individual differences\nin the magnitude and patterns of change (Salthouse &\nFerrer-Caja, 2003). More work is needed to understand\nindividual difference factors such as personality traits that\ncould be related to such variations in cognitive aging.\nPersonality may serve as a protective resource or a source of\nvulnerability when it comes to changes in cognitive perfor-\nmance (Costa & McCrae, 1997; Costa, Metter, & McCrae,\nPersonality and Cognition\nWe first review the major findings linking personality and\ncognition in adulthood before turning to our main focus on\npersonality stability and change in relation to cognitive func-\ntioning. Although much of this work has been correlational\nand does not allow for clear conclusions about directionality\nor mechanisms, we present the most promising theoretically\nderived suggestions about the processes involved in these\nlinkages.\nNeuroticism is consistently linked to lower performance\nacross various domains including executive functioning,\ninformation processing, pattern analysis, memory, and crea-\ntivity (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997; Chamorro-Premuzic,\nPersonality Stability Is Associated With Better Cognitive\nPerformance in Adulthood: Are the Stable More Able?\nEileen K.

Although personality is relatively stable over time, there are individual differences in the patterns and\nmagnitude of change. There is some evidence that personality change in adulthood is related to physical health and\nlongevity. The present study expanded this work to consider whether personality stability or change would be associated\nwith better cognitive functioning, especially in later adulthood.\nMethod. A total of 4,974 individuals participated in two waves of The Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS) in\nAdult Cognition by Telephone cognitive battery at Time 2.\nResults. Multiple regression and analysis of covariance analyses showed that, consistent with predictions, individuals\nremaining stable in openness to experience and neuroticism had faster reaction times and better inductive reasoning than\nthose who changed. Among older adults, those who remained stable or decreased in neuroticism had significantly faster\nreaction times than those who increased.\nConclusions. As predicted, personality stability on some traits was associated with more adaptive cognitive performance\non reasoning and reaction time. Personality is discussed as a possible resource for protecting against or minimizing\nage-related declines in cognition.\nKey Words: Aging--Cognitive performance--Personality change.\nMoutafi, Furnham, & Crump, 2003; Moutafi, Furnham, &\nmechanisms are that individuals high in neuroticism are\ncharacteristically more anxious and prone to intrusive thinking\nand distraction, which likely impedes their ability to focus\non a task. Neuroticism is not necessarily linked to intelligence\nor inherent ability but is associated with an individual's\nability to perform in a given situation. Extraversion also is\nrelated to cognition but the directional nature of the rela-\ntionship varies. It has been associated with better creativity,\nspeed, long-term memory, and intelligence, but worse diver-\ngent thinking, crystallized intelligence, spatial orientation,\nreasoning, and verbal ability (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997;\nBaker & Bichsel, 2006; Chamorro-Premuzic, Furnham, &\nAckerman, 2006; Chamorro-Premuzic, Furnham, & Petrides,\nBoron, 2008). Extraverted individuals may be less invested\nin intellectual activities than social ones or are less likely\nto develop effective study habits or test-taking strategies\n(Chamorro-Premuzic, Furnham, & Ackerman, 2006). Further,\nextraverted individuals may be better at performing speed-\nbased tasks but worse at tasks requiring effortful processing\nbecause they are less inclined to deliberate over problems\nfor long periods of time but thrive in a setting where com-\npleting a task quickly is the goal (Baker & Bichsel, 2006).\nOpenness to experience has been consistently linked to\nintelligence and cognitive performance, specifically with\nexecutive functioning, divergent thinking, creativity, verbal\nability, verbal memory, spatial orientation, and inductive\nreasoning (Ackerman & Rolfhus, 1999; Baker & Bichsel,\nDeYoung, Flanders, & Peterson, 2008; DeYoung, Peterson, &\nDollinger, Holland, & MacDonald, 1995; McCrae & Costa,\nThose who are flexible and open minded are more likely to\nperform well on complex tasks and abstract reasoning than\nthose who are more rigid and narrow minded (Schaie, Dutta, &\nWillis, 1991). Conscientiousness shows positive associations\nto reasoning, speed, and academic performance but is nega-\ntively related to intelligence, verbal ability, reasoning, and\ndivergent thinking (McCrae & Costa, 1987; Moutafi et al.,\nBoron, 2008). Individuals who need to work hard to do well\non cognitive tasks may develop conscientious characteristics\nas a means of compensation, such that being more organized,\nmotivated, and deliberate may help him or her perform well.\nFinally, agreeableness, which is not typically associated\nwith cognitive ability, has been linked in a few studies with\nworse inductive reasoning, spatial orientation, and general\nlimited findings for agreeableness may be due, in part, to\nthe fact that it is a trait related to how a person interacts\ninterpersonally which may not affect their cognitive perfor-\nmance. However, the negative association may reflect that\nthose who are agreeable are not highly invested in demon-\nstrating cognitive competence but attain success primarily\nthrough their social skills. Further, having higher cognitive\nabilities may be associated with being less dependent on\npleasing others; in turn, being less agreeable may \"foster\nWhereas most studies reviewed earlier examined the\npersonality\u00adcognition relationships without consideration of\nage, some have specifically focused on older adults or com-\npared younger and older adults. Baker and Bichsel (2006)\nstudied the link between cognitive abilities and the \"Big\nFive\" in younger and older adults, who were either cogni-\ntively comparable or superior to the young adults. They found\nfor young adults, openness is a positive predictor of crystal-\nlized intelligence and short-term memory, whereas extra-\nversion is positively related to speed but negatively related to\ncrystallized intelligence. The cognitively comparable old had\nsimilar results, with positive links for extraversion and long-\nterm retrieval as well as openness and auditory processing.\nFinally, the cognitively superior old not only had a similar\nlink to openness and visual spatial ability but also in this\ngroup it was also beneficial to be high in conscientiousness\nfor auditory and short-term memory and low in agreeableness\nfor better crystallized intelligence (Baker & Bichsel, 2006).\nThis indicates that individuals who have exceptional cognitive\nperformance, or have been able to maintain good cognitive\nfunctioning into old age, may have a unique personality\nprofile. Crowe, Andel, Pedersen, Fratiglioni, & Gatz (2006)\nexamined the relationship between personality and risk of cog-\nnitive impairment in older adults. They measured extraversion\nand neuroticism at one time point and cognition at 25-year\nintervals and found that those with a combination of high\nneuroticism and high extraversion showed the greatest risk\nfor cognitive impairment and cognitive decline in adulthood.\nA recent study by Sharp and colleagues (2010) examined\nthe role of openness to experience in predicting cognitive\nchange. They found that openness was associated with better\ncognitive performance but not with maintaining cognitive\nfunctioning over time. Individuals high in openness may have\na cognitive advantage in later life, suggesting that being\nmore open to experience may serve as a protective factor in\nolder adulthood. These studies show that personality traits are\nrelated to cognitive performance in adults, and moreover, this\nrelation may vary across the adult life span. There are wide\nindividual differences in cognitive performance and pat-\nterns of change with aging, and personality factors may\nmoderate age differences or changes in cognitive performance.\nPersonality and Aging\nThere is a good deal of evidence that personality remains\nrelatively stable across the adult life span (Caspi & Bem,\nWeiss et al., 2005). There is some indication that personality\nis a resource that may be protective against declines in health\nand may be a contributor to successful aging and other behav-\nFunder & Colvin, 1991). \"Traits provide the stable structure\nof personality within which the aging individual copes,\nadjusts, defends, compensates, or adjusts\" (Costa & McCrae,\n1980, p. 97). Nevertheless, not everyone is stable, and there is\nevidence for both average, mean-level change (Schaie et al.,\n2004) and correlational, individual differences in change, and\nthe findings on the nature of change are mixed. Longitudinal\nwork has shown increases in extraversion, agreeableness and\nconscientiousness, and decreases in neuroticism across the\nhave found that extraversion is stable (Mroczek & Spiro,\nSchaie et al., 2004). One possible reason for the discrepant\nfindings is that most studies examine only general trait-level\nchanges, whereas the profile of change in extraversion may\ndiffer by specific facets, as reported by Terracciano, Costa,\nAn extensive body of research has examined individual\ndifferences in personality change across the adult life span;\nyet few, if any, have looked directly at the relation to adult\ncognition. Recent studies suggest that changes and stability\nin personality, specifically neuroticism, are related to later\nlife outcomes such as risk of dementia (Duchek, Balota,\nStorandt, & Larsen, 2007) and mortality (Mroczek & Spiro,\n2007). Further, the literature suggests a possible mechanism\nin that neuroticism change may be associated with mor-\ntality because individuals high or increasing in neuroticism\nmay engage in riskier health behaviors (Mroczek, Spiro, &\nand Arenberg (1980) suggested that the stable personality is\nthe adaptive norm. Further, the work of Roberts and colleagues\n(2000) has shown that personality becomes more stable with\nage and is by and large stabilized by age 50. Personality is less\nlikely to change in later life except in extreme conditions (such\nas major life events or disease). Given this, it seems reasonable\nto expect that personality change in later life would not be\nideal. Thus, stability in personality, in contrast to change in any\ndirection, may have a significant beneficial impact on later life\nhealth outcomes, including cognitive performance.\nThe Present Study\nThe overall purpose of this study was to examine the\nrelationship of personality to cognitive performance across\nthe adult life span in a large national sample, with four specific\nobjectives. The first goal was to explore personality, specif-\nically the big five traits (neuroticism, extraversion, consci-\nentiousness, openness, and agreeableness), in relation to\ncognitive performance across multiple cognitive domains\nincluding reasoning, reaction time, speed of processing,\nworking memory, episodic memory, and verbal fluency. The\nsecond objective was to examine the magnitude of individual\ndifferences in stability and change of personality over the\ncourse of 8\u00ad10 years. Third, we examined whether individual\ndifferences in stability and change of personality were related\nto cognition, that is, whether cognitive performance varies\nas a function of the magnitude and direction of change in\npersonality. Finally, we examined whether the relationships\nbetween cognition, personality, and change in personality\nvaried by age.\nOur first hypothesis was that personality would be related\nto cognitive performance. Based on patterns in prior work\nwith more age homogenous samples, we expected that neu-\nroticism would be negatively associated with performance\nand that openness and conscientiousness would be positively\nassociated with performance across all cognitive domains.\nFurthermore, we expected to find that extraversion would be\nassociated with poorer performance on tasks involving more\neffortful processing, specifically reasoning and episodic\nmemory, but faster performance on speed of processing and\nreaction time.\nOur second hypothesis was that there would be moderately\nhigh correlational stability, with some evidence for individual\ndifferences in rank-order change for personality from Time 1\nto Time 2. We also expected mean-level changes in personality\nfrom Time 1 to Time 2; specifically, that neuroticism would\ndecrease and that openness, conscientiousness, extraversion,\nand agreeableness would increase as suggested in past studies\nOur third hypothesis was that individual differences in\npersonality stability and change would be related to cognitive\nperformance, as has been found with regard to mortality\n(Mroczek & Spiro, 2007) and dementia (Duchek et al.,\n2007). Those who were stable in neuroticism, extraversion,\nopenness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were expected\nto have higher cognitive performance than those who changed\nin either direction.\nFinally, for our fourth hypothesis, we predicted that the\nrelationship of cognition with personality and personality\nchange would vary by age. We expected that stability of\npersonality would benefit the cognitive performance of older\nadults more so than younger adults (Costa et al., 1994).\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were community-dwelling adults from the\nMidlife in the United States Study (MIDUS), which was\nconducted at two time periods. Time 1 data were collected\napproximately 70% of the original sample, adjusted for\nmortality (Brim, Ryff, & Kessler, 2004). Compared with\nthose who dropped out, those who completed the study\nThere were no differences in age, level of extraversion,\nagreeableness, or openness.\nProcedures\nPersonality measures were collected at Time 1 and Time\n2 by mail questionnaire, and cognitive data were collected\nonly at Time 2 and by telephone.\nMeasures\nAge.--Age was computed by subtracting the interview\ndate from the participant's reported birthdate, rounded to a\nSD = 12.4). We computed a five-group age variable, which\nwas broken down by decade for the analysis of covariance\nEducation.--Education was measured categorically on\na scale of 1 to 12 and ranged from 1 = some grade school,\n6 = 1\u00ad2 years college, no degree, 9 = 4-year college degree\nHealth.--A health composite was computed, consisting\nof the number of chronic and acute conditions, and function\nlimitations were reported and recoded so that higher scores\nreflect better health.\nHearing problems.--Hearing was measured by asking\nparticipants to rate their hearing compared with others their\nage, on a 5-point scale (1 = excellent, 5 = poor).\nPersonality.--Personality was measured using the MIDUS\nsurvey questionnaire in which the Big Five personality traits\nwere assessed. Participants were asked the degree to which\nself-descriptive adjectives described them (Lachman &\nhas been validated and significantly correlates with the NEO\ntrait scales (see http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/psych/\nlachman/instruments/other-instruments.html). Each question\nwas scored on a 1\u00ad4 scale, with 1 = A lot, 2 = Some, 3 = A\nlittle, and 4 = Not at all. The variables were recoded so that\nhigh scores reflected higher levels of that particular trait,\nand means were calculated for each item set. Coefficient\nalphas are as follows: neuroticism (moody, worrying, nervous,\ncalm--not reverse coded) = .74; extraversion (outgoing,\nfriendly, lively, active, talkative) = .78; openness (creative,\nimaginative, intelligence, curious, broadminded, sophisticated,\nadventurous) = .77; conscientiousness (organized, responsible,\nhardworking, careless--not reverse coded) = .58; and agree-\nableness (helpful, warm, caring, softhearted, sympathetic) = .80\nCognitive measures.--All cognitive measures are part of\nthe MIDUS 2 Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone,\nwhich was designed to test areas of cognition that are sensitive\nto age effects (Lachman & Tun, 2008; Tun & Lachman,\nminimal fatigue effects. Interviewers first administered a\nnumbers-repeat task to make sure that participants were\nable to hear clearly. Hearing problems were negatively\ncorrelated with performance on the cognitive measures\n-.09, p < .001) and positively correlated with latencies for\nreaction time (RT = 0.08, p < .001), such that worse hearing\nwas associated with poorer performance, so this was included\nin all models as a covariate.\nWorking memory was assessed using the backward digit\nspan from the Wecshler Adult Intelligence Scale-III test\n(Wechsler, 1997) where participants were asked to repeat\nstrings of numbers in reverse order. Each level has an\nincreased number of digits, and participants have two\nchances to accurately complete each level. Scores range\nfrom 2 to 8 digits and scores represent the largest set size\nthat was correctly completed.\nProcessing speed was measured using a backward counting\ntask. Participants were given 30 s to count backward from\n100 as quickly and accurately as possible. The score is the\nnumber of correct numbers reported, subtracting skipped\nand erroneous numbers.\nReaction time latencies were measured using the Stop\nand Go Switch task (Tun & Lachman, 2008). Participants\ncompleted two single task trials with 20 blocks each, first\nwith a congruent response (to RED, say \"STOP,\" to GREEN,\nsay \"GO\"), then with an incongruent response (to RED, say\n\"GO,\" to GREEN, say \"STOP\"). In the mixed trials, partic-\nipants were given a cue to switch between congruent and\nnoncongruent responses. The task sequence was randomized,\nso switch cues were given at random intervals in order to\nincrease sensitivity to age effects (Tun & Lachman, 2008).\nFor the current analysis, the median reaction time score in\nseconds for the mixed trials in which individuals switched\nbetween congruent and incongruent cues was used.\nReasoning was assessed using a number series completion\ntask where participants were given a series of numbers (such\nthe progression. They received five series, with increasing\nlevels of difficulty. Scores were calculated based on the\nnumber of sets correctly completed for each level, for a\nhighest possible score of 5.\nEpisodic memory, immediate and delayed, was assessed\nusing the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (Lezak, 1995;\nlisten to a list of 15 words read aloud at the rate of one word\nper second. They were then given 1 min to recall as many\nwords as they could. One point was given for each correct\nresponse for a total possible score of 15. Episodic memory\ndelayed was not significantly related to personality, so it is\nnot included in the analyses.\nVerbal fluency was measured using the category fluency\nwere given 1 min to generate as many words within the\ncategory \"animal\" as they could. Scores were based on the\nnumber of unique words they could generate within 60 s.\nThe number of repeated words and intrusion errors were\nomitted from their final score.\nData Analysis\nPersonality and cognitive performance.--Six regression\nmodels were analyzed, one for each cognitive dimension as\nthe dependent variable (reaction time, speed, verbal fluency,\nreasoning, episodic memory immediate, and working mem-\nory). Age, education, sex, health, and hearing were entered\nas predictors in Step 1, and at Step 2 the five personality\ntraits from Time 2 were added. Interactions between centered\nage and personality were computed and entered into Step 3,\nbut none were significant so they are not reported below.\nFurther, speed of processing was not significantly predicted\nby any trait, so this model is not reported below.\nPersonality stability and change.--Change in personality\nwas computed by subtracting the personality scores at Time 1\nfrom Time 2 scores. The use of change scores is considered\nacceptable especially with just two measurement occasions\napproaches, such as multilevel modeling, require three or\nmore occasions. To examine whether those who were stable\ndiffered from those who changed (either increased or\ndecreased), we created categorical change variables and\nanalyzed them using a series of univariateANCOVA models.\nBased on the procedure used by Schaie (1984) and Willis\nand Schaie (2006), three personality change groups were\nformed, with change scores within 1 SD classified as the\nstable group, scores 1.0 SD below the mean were classified\nas the decrease group, and scores more than 1.0 SD above\nthe mean were classified as the increase group. For addi-\ntional follow-up analyses, the stable group was dichoto-\nmized (high and low) via median split at both Time 1 and\nTime 2, based on the raw score of each trait. Individuals\nwho were high at both Time 1 and Time 2 were labeled as\nstable high, whereas individuals who were low at both Time\n1 and Time 2 were labeled as stable-low.\nPersonality change, cognitive performance, and age\ndifferences.--The categorical change group variables (stable,\nincrease, decrease for each personality trait) were entered\ntogether as independent variables, in a univariate ANCOVA\nto determine the mean differences between these groups on\ncognitive performance after controlling for health, hearing\nproblems, sex, education, and age. We also examined the\ninteraction between age group and personality change\ngroup to determine whether the effects of personality change\non cognition varied by age.\nResults\nPersonality and Cognitive Performance\nEach analysis included all available cases. For demographic\nvariables, we found that age (-), education (+), health (+), and\nhearing problems (-) were significantly related to cognition.\nAlso, sex was significantly related, with men showing higher\nverbal fluency and reasoning and women higher episodic\nmemory and reaction time. The regression analyses showed\nthat, after controlling for age, sex, education, health, and\nhearing, personality added a significant amount of variance\nTable 1.

Change in openness was associated with reasoning\n(p < .01), and post hoc comparisons showed that remaining\nwith the best performance (p < .01).\nFinally, in support of our fourth hypothesis, we found that\nthe relation of reaction time to change in neuroticism varied by\nage (p < .05), such that, for older adults, those who increased\ncantly worse (higher latencies) than those who either re-\nDiscussion\nThe current findings show that individual differences in\nneuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness are\nrelated to cognitive performance across the adult years. As\nexpected, we found that there was relative stability, in terms of\ncross occasion correlations, from Time 1 to Time 2 (Costa &\nicism was negatively related to working memory (p < .05)\nand reasoning (p < .001) see Table 1. Extraversion was\nnegatively related to reasoning (p < .001) and marginally\nrelated to verbal fluency (p < .10), indicating that high\nextraversion is related to lower cognitive performance,\nwhich supports our hypothesis that extraversion would be\nassociated to worse performance on tasks requiring effortful\nprocessing. Openness was, as expected, positively related to\nalmost all aspects of cognition, including reasoning (p < .01),\nverbal fluency (p < .001), working memory (p < .05), and\nepisodic memory (p < .01). Agreeableness showed a few\nweak, although significant, negative associations with cog-\nnition, including verbal fluency (p < .05), reasoning (p < .05),\nand reaction time (p < .05). Conscientiousness was not\nsignificantly related to any cognitive domain.\nPersonality Stability and Change\nTo test the second hypothesis, we first looked at the\ncorrelations from Time 1 to Time 2. Correlational stability,\nthat is, the Time 1 to Time 2 correlation (Baltes, Reese, &\nNesselroade, 1977), was significant for all traits: agreeableness\nand extraversion (r = .70, p < .001). To analyze whether\nthere was mean-level change in personality, dependent t\ntests were computed, and results showed there were significant\ncorrelations from Time 1 to Time 2 were quite similar for\nboth older and younger adults, ranging from .60 to .71 for all\ntraits and across age groups (p < .001).

The findings for neuroticism\nsupport previous work, suggesting that high neuroticism\nmay interfere with performance, which could be explained\nby the heightened anxiety and intrusive thoughts associated\nwith neuroticism (Moutafi et al., 2005; Stelmack, Houlihan, &\nMcGarry-Roberts, 1993). For extraversion, our findings\nwere consistent with the studies showing that high extraversion\nis associated with lower performance on tasks that require\neffortful processing such as reasoning (e.g., Baker & Bichsel,\nassociated with better cognitive performance, which supports\npast work, suggesting that individuals high in openness\nhave high intelligence and cognitive ability (Ackerman &\nHeggestad, 1997) and indicates that individuals who are\nintellectually engaged, pursue new interests, and think crit-\nically may have higher cognition and may possibly maintain\nthis ability as they age (Baker & Bichsel, 2006; Lachman,\nAgrigoroaei, Murphy, & Tun, 2010). Finally, high agreeable-\nness was associated with lower performance, as supported by\nlimited other work (Baker & Bichsel, 2006). There were no\nassociations between conscientiousness and performance.\nAdding to the body of work on personality and cognition,\nwe found that individual differences in stability and change\nin personality were related to cognitive performance. Whereas\npast research has focused on concurrent relationships between\npersonality and cognition, the present study expanded the\nfindings by also considering whether individual differences\nin personality change were related to cognition in adulthood.\nWe found that stability is related to better reasoning perfor-\nmance and faster reaction time, than change in either direction,\nfor neuroticism and openness to experience. This indicates\nthat maintaining a consistent personality is more beneficial\nthan even socially desirable change (such as declining in\nneuroticism) for some cognitive abilities (with one exception\nfor neuroticism and reaction time, for which decreases were\nalso adaptive). Furthermore, we found that the relation\nbetween personality change and cognition varied by age\nwith respect to neuroticism, such that older adults who\nincreased in neuroticism had significantly lower reaction\ntime performance than those who either remained stable or\ndecreased in neuroticism. This suggests that the effects of\nneuroticism may become more detrimental with age, which is\nconsistent with research showing that increases in neuroticism\ncan have negative consequences for domains other than cogni-\ntion (e.g., physical health, mortality) in later life (Mroczek &\npattern also could be indicative of changes in the brain\nand health, which impact both neuroticism and cognition\nOur findings are consistent with the view that personality\nstability may serve as a protective resource throughout\nThe results show that personality stability is associated with\nbetter reasoning and reaction time than change in either\ndirection in some cases. In other cases, socially desirable\nchange and stability are both equally effective for cognitive\nperformance. This was the case for neuroticism, in which\ncase decreasing was as beneficial as stability for reaction\ntime. It will be important in future work to consider why\nstability may be beneficial for cognitive functioning. Theo-\nretical work suggests that personality (Costa et al., 1994)\nand behavioral consistency are adaptive (Funder & Colvin,\n1991). After many years, adults may become comfortable\n\"in their own skin,\" and this familiarity may breed adaptive\nfunctioning especially in the face of changes that could\noccur in health and cognitive functioning with age. In contrast,\nthose who experience personality change, for whatever reason,\nmay be at a disadvantage as they need to adjust to a different\nway of approaching the world. Another possibility is that\nchanges to personality could be caused by major life events\nor diseases such as dementia. In that case, the positive signs\nof stability for cognition may be a reflection of the absence\nof major upheavals in one's life (McCrae & Costa, 1994).\nAs Costa and McCrae have stated \"the durability of dispo-\nsitions despite biological, social and cognitive changes,\nmust result from some form of adaptation\" (Costa, McCrae,\ninterpreting our results. Nevertheless, more research is needed\nto address questions about the mechanisms that allow for\nmaintenance of personality and the effects on cognitive\nperformance. It is possible that maintaining low neuroti-\ncism and high openness in later life may help buffer\nagainst cognitive declines. Future examination of the un-\nderlying mechanisms (e.g., anxiety, social engagement)\nof these traits is needed to understand more precisely\nhow these processes operate.\nOne of the limitations of the current study is that we only\nhad cognitive data at one time point.

Reaction time scores by change in neuroticism and age group.\ninsights into the directionality and underlying mechanisms\nof the patterns observed in the current study, future studies\nshould examine change in both cognitive performance and\npersonality. We considered if stability/change in personality\nis related to individual differences in cognitive performance\nand whether the relationship differs by age. It would be\ninformative in the future to examine change in both personality\nand cognitive performance. This would provide additional\ninsight into the nature of the relationship including the\ndirectionality. It is possible that changes in cognitive perfor-\nmance, including the onset of mild cognitive impairment\nor dementia (Duchek et al., 2007), result in changes in\npersonality. We also acknowledge that we found a limited\nnumber of, albeit consistent, significant effects. Although we\nincluded five personality traits and six cognitive dimensions,\nwe found significant effects for just four of the relationships.\nNevertheless, of these significant associations, we found that\nstability was the most adaptive for cognitive performance in\ntwo of these associations, whereas for the other two effects we\nfound that change in the adaptive direction to be associated\nwith better performance. In future work, it will also be\nimportant to consider why these results were found for\nreaction time and reasoning and not for the other cognitive\ndimensions. Also, in future studies, it will be desirable to\ninclude more than two occasions of measurement. Although\nthe change score method we used is acceptable, when only two\nmeasurements are available (Rogosa, 1988; Rogosa & Saner,\n1995) especially given our large sample, which enhances\nthe reliability, we acknowledge that future studies would\nbenefit from having three or more measurements of person-\nality to adequately model change and test directionality\nusing other methods such as multilevel modeling.\nThe present results are a first step in demonstrating that\npersonality change is related to cognitive performance and\nthat maintaining a stable personality may be an asset for\ncognitive functioning, especially in later life. More research\nis needed to understand the processes involved in linking\nchanges in personality and cognition and to consider how\npersonality dispositions may serve as a protection or vulner-\nability for cognitive declines. This could allow researchers\nand clinicians to intervene more effectively into the lives of\nmiddle-aged and older adults to moderate declines in cogni-\ntive performance and competence. It could provide valuable\ninformation for tailoring interventions to individual differ-\nences in personality, especially for those who are experi-\nencing personality changes in later life.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by a grant from the National Institute on\nFoundation Research Network on Successful Midlife Development.
