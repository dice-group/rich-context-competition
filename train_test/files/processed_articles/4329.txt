Participants were asked to complete\nquestionnaires on sociodemographic data and provide opinions about C-section.\nResults: A total of 88 midwives and 22 obstetricians participated in the study. Approximately one-\nthird of midwives believed caesarean rates were high at their institution and more than 50%\nthought that the rate should be reduced. In contrast, although approximately 80% of obstetricians\nthought that caesarean rates in their institutions ranged between 25\u00ad50%, only 18% believed the\nrate was high and 68% believed that the rate of should be reduced. Midwives and obstetricians\ntended to agree on most suggested reasons for high C-section rates. When asked about\ninterventions that may reduce the C-section rates, midwives and obstetricians had opposing views.\nHowever, most participants agreed that prenatal childbirth preparation courses would be\nbeneficial.\nConclusions: This study showed that most midwives and obstetricians believe the rate of\nC-section at their institution is high and should be reduced.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/imr\n1Department of Nursing Science, Faculty of Medicine,\nInstitute of Health and Society, Oslo University, Oslo,\nNorway\n2Department of Health Management and Health\nEconomics, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Health and\nSociety, Oslo University, Oslo, Norway\n3Department of Health Policy & Management, Global\nHealth, Economics & Finance Concentrations, Jackson\nState University, Jackson, MS, USA\nCorresponding author:\nMustafa Z Younis, Department of Health Policy &\nManagement, Global Health, Economics & Finance\nConcentrations, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch\nEmail: younis99@gmail.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.\nsagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

In other countries,\nthis practice has been associated with a\ndecrease in the number of caesarean deliv-\neries.22,23 Other practices followed in Turkey\ninclude penalties (i.e. lower premiums) for\nphysicians and hospitals that are associated\nwith high numbers of C-sections and\nrewards (i.e. higher premiums) for phys-\nicians who encourage vaginal births.\nHowever, although studies report that vagi-\nnal birth after C-section is generally success-\nful7 as in several countries, Turkey has\nadopted a general policy of `once a caesar-\nthis study aimed to examine the opinions\nand attitudes of a sample of Turkish obstet-\nricians and midwives towards C-section and\nvaginal birth following a caesarean delivery.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe midwives and obstetricians involved in\nthis study worked in a state women's hos-\npital and two private hospitals in Gaziantep,\nTurkey (city population 1.8 million people).\nThe study took place between 01 January\nwas used to determine the sociodemographic\ncharacteristics of the study participants.\nQuestionnaire to determine participants'\nviews\nTo determine the views of the midwives and\nobstetricians on vaginal or caesarean birth\nfollowing a C-section, a 5-point Likert-type\nquestionnaire was constructed based on a\nrelated literature search. The questionnaire\nconsisted of 13 statements and participants\nwere asked to rate each statement as one of\nthe following: certainly do not agree, do not\nagree, not sure, agree, certainly agree.\nResponses were also scored 1\u00ad5, where\n1 \u00bc certainly do not agree and 5 \u00bc certainly\nagree. Of the 13 statements, eight were\nrelated to possible causes for high C-section\nrates and five were related to interventions\nthat may have affected the rates. A pilot\nstudy was performed using 10 midwives and\ntwo obstetricians (who also participated in\nthe actual study) to test the participants'\nunderstanding of the questionnaires. As a\nresult of the pilot study, statements 4 and 5\nwere amended.\nThe final 13 statements were as follows:\n(1) The increase in the rate of caesarean\nbirths is related to birth difficulties.\n(2) The increase in the rate of C-section is\nbecause of new developments in\ntechnology.\n(3) The increase in the rate of caesarean\nbirths is due to hospital management.\n(4) The increase in the rate of caesareans\nis due to the preferences of pregnant\nwomen and their family/relatives.\n(5) The increase in the rate of caesareans\nis due to the fear of malpractice.\n(6) The increase in the rate of caesareans\nis due to the high number of births in\nthe organization.\n(7) The increase in the rate of C-section is\ndue to the high number of previous\ncaesarean births.\n(8) The increase in the rate of C-section\nis due to the high number of women\nwho become pregnant at an advanced\nage.\n(9) The use of a partogram reduces the\nrate of caesarean delivery.\n(10) Getting a second expert opinion on the\ntype of delivery reduces the rate of C-\nsection.\n(11) Application of the external cephalic\nversion reduces the rate of C-section.23\n(12) Vaginal birth after caesarean birth\nreduces the rate of C-section.\n(13) Prenatal childbirth preparation\ncourses would decrease the caesarean\ndelivery rate.\nThe questionnaire was distributed to the\nparticipants by the two researchers\n(Menekse Aslan and Sezer Kisa) in a\nsealed envelope and completed question-\nnaires were returned in a sealed envelope.\nThe study was approved by Zirve\nUniversity Ethics Committee (15-February-\nor written informed consent was\nobtained from all participants before the\nstart of the study.

A P-value < 0.05 was con-\nsidered to indicate statistical significance.\nPaired Student's t-tests were used to com-\npare differences between the midwives and\nobstetricians in questionnaire scale scores\nand 2-test was used to evaluate differences\nbetween midwives and obstetricians in cat-\negorical data (the three categories were:\nagree/certainly agree; not sure; not agree/\ncertainly do not agree).\nResults\nFrom the identified local population of 120\nmidwives and 49 obstetricians, 88 midwives\nand 22 obstetricians participated in the\nstudy. The majority of participants were\nless than 40 years of age (mean \u00c6 SD age,\nexperience in the job (Table 1). All midwives\nwere women but the majority of the obstet-\nparticipants had 1\u00ad2 children, but while\nobstetricians had undergone a caesarean\ndelivery for their last child.\nWhen midwives were asked about caesar-\nean delivery rates in their institutions,\napproximately one-third (31%) of them\nbelieved the rate was high and more than\nhalf (52%) of them held the view that the\nrate should be reduced (Table 2). In con-\ntrast, although approximately 80% of\nobstetricians thought that caesarean rates\nin their institutions ranged between\nhigh and approximately two-thirds of them\n(68%) believed that the rate should be\nreduced.\nTable 1.

However, they dis-\nagreed on statements 1, 3 and 6. For state-\nment 1 (i.e. the reason for the increase in the\nrate of caesarean births is related to birth\ndifficulties) and statement 6 (i.e. the increase\nis due to the high number of births in the\norganization), obstetricians had signifi-\ncantly higher mean scores (i.e. agreed with\nthe statement) compared with midwives\n(P < 0.05) (Table 3). In contrast, for state-\nment 3 (i.e. the reason for the increase in the\nrate is due to hospital management), mid-\nwives had a significantly higher mean score\n(i.e. agreed with the statement) compared\nwith obstetricians (P < 0.05).\nSimilarly, when the responses were\ngrouped into three categories (i.e. `agree/\ncertainly agree', `not sure' and `not agree/\ncertainly do not agree') significant differ-\nences between midwives and obstetricians\nwere found for statements 1, 3, and 6\n(P < 0.05). In addition, a significant differ-\nence between the two groups was also found\nfor statement 4 (i.e. the increase in the rate of\ncaesareans is due to the preferences of\npregnant women and their family/relatives)\nwith more midwives than obstetricians\nagreeing with the statement (P < 0.05).\nWhen participants were asked their opin-\nions about interventions that may reduce the\nhigh C-section rates (statements 9\u00ad13), mid-\nwives and obstetricians had opposing views.\nMidwives tended to agree more with the\npropositions (i.e. use of partogram, getting a\nsecond expert opinion, application of the\nexternal cephalic version, advocating vagi-\nnal birth, prenatal childbirth preparation\ncourses) compared with obstetricians and\nthis was reflected by their significantly\nhigher mean scores for statements 9\u00ad12\n(P < 0.05) (Table 4).

Indeed, a report based on data\nfrom OECD countries concluded that C-\nsection rates are highest in Turkey (43%)\nand Mexico (42%) and lowest in the\nNetherlands (14%) where home births are\na common option for women with low risk\npregnancies.4,17 According to Turkey's\nMinistry of Health, caesarean delivery\nshould only be performed when there is a\nsignificant risk of maternal or fetal morbid-\nity or mortality.21 However, although the\nMinistry of Health does not look favourably\nupon elective caesareans, studies con-\nducted in Turkey have found that one of\nthe main drivers for C-section is maternal\nA large proportion of the obstetricians\nparticipating in the present study suggested\nthat birth difficulties were responsible for the\nhigh rates of caesarean deliveries. This\nfinding is in agreement with other studies\nthat found the principal indications (85%)\nfor caesarean delivery were labour difficul-\nties, fetal distress, breech presentation and\ntrast, midwives in this present study were of\nthe opinion that hospital management\npolicy was responsible for the high rates of\ncaesarean births.

In\nTurkey, as in several countries, a policy of\n`once a caesarean, always a caesarean' has\ngested that obstetricians have a substantial\ninfluence on the type of delivery and con-\ntribute importantly to the increase in C-\nsection rates.9 The report also concluded\nthat there was a direct association between\nthe number of midwives per head and a\ndecrease in caesarean delivery rate.9\nMost midwives who participated in this\npresent study agreed that a strategy for\nreducing high C-section rates was to obtain\na second expert opinion. Having the option\nto request a second opinion has been sug-\ngested as being a strong facilitator for\nencouraging women to choose the safest\nmode of delivery.23 However, a study from\nCanada found that some obstetricians\nbelieved that a second opinion should only\nbe obtained after a request from a family\npractitioner because of difficulties in the\nmedico-legal responsibilities between two\nobstetricians.23 Moreover, we believe that\nit would be difficult to insist on a second\nopinion for women who have already\ndecided to have a planned C-section. In\nTurkey, there is no legal obligation to\nrequest a second opinion but some countries\ndo require a second opinion for non-urgent\ncaesarean deliveries particularly in cases\nwhere caesarean delivery on maternal\nIn this present study, a large proportion\n47%) believed that encouraging vaginal\ndelivery following a caesarean birth for\nwomen who fulfilled the appropriate criteria\nwould reduce the rate of C-section.\nHowever, the obstetricians in the present\nstudy did not agree with this proposal. A\nstudy from Egypt concluded that obstetri-\ncians' perspectives towards caesarean deliv-\nery were influenced by feelings of insecurity\nabout performing problematic vaginal\ndeliveries, fear of legal liability, non-\norganizational practice and higher revenue\nfrom C-section births compared with\nuncomplicated vaginal births.11\nAlthough midwives and obstetricians in\nTurkey have the final decision on the mode\nof delivery, some patients insist on C-section\nwomen in India suggests that women do not\nrigidly adhere to a preferred method of\nbirth.7 In the Indian study, the majority of\nwomen reported that they would prefer a\nvaginal delivery and so patient preference is\nunlikely to be a principal driver for increas-\ning C-section rates.7 However, most women\nwere in favour of C-section if it was neces-\nsary to protect their health or that of their\nbaby.7,33 Data from a Turkish study of the\nviews of 49 family physicians on caesarean\ndelivery on maternal request, found that\n61% felt that there should be a medical\nindication for caesarean delivery.21 In con-\ntrast, another study from Turkey found that\n24% of medical students were of the opinion\nthat optional C-section can be performed\nwithout any medical indication.34\nThe majority of the participating obstetri-\ncians and midwives in this present study\nagreed with the hypothesis that prenatal\nchildbirth preparation courses would\ndecrease the rate of caesarean delivery.\nHowever, there are conflicting results in the\nliterature. One study showed that there is a\nneed for nurse-led relaxation classes and\nbirth preparation classes that may reduce\nC-section rates in low risk pregnancies.35\nHowever, a study conducted in Canada\ninvolving 1,318 pregnant women found that\nmany women were not prepared to make\ntheir own decisions on mode of delivery.36 In\naddition, another study concluded that\nobstetricians believed that informing women\nabout the risks and benefits of vaginal\ndelivery versus elective C-section was time-\nconsuming and may have no impact on their\nfinal decision, particularly when women\nA possible limitation of the study was\nthe small sample size and the unequal\nnumber of participants in each group (i.e.\n88 midwives and 22 obstetricians). In add-\nition, the questionnaire had not been exten-\nsively tested and so had not been effectively\nvalidated. Therefore, further studies are\nrequired to substantiate these preliminary\nfindings.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study\nsuggest that the following strategies could be\nimplemented and may result in a reduction\nof the C-section rate in Turkey: (i) prenatal\nchildbirth education classes should be\npromoted to increase pregnant women's\nknowledge about the risks and benefits of\nC-section compared with vaginal delivery;\n(ii) the knowledge and skills of midwives\nand physicians/obstetricians with regard to\nvaginal birth following a C-section should\nbe improved; (iii) unnecessary elective pri-\nmary C-section rates should be reduced\nwithout compromising maternal and fetal\nsafety; (iv) health policies that advocate a\nsecond expert opinion for elective C-section\nshould be initiated and could be used as a\nstrategy to reduce the primary C-section\nrate; and (v) further research is needed to\ndetermine the reasons for maternal elective\nC-sections.\n"
