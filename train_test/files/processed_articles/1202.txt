More than\nmiles were declared a disaster area (roughly equal to\nthe land mass of the United Kingdom).1 More than\npeople still remain missing.2 As one might expect\nbased on these facts, epidemiological data have\ndocumented an extremely high prevalence of psycho-\npathology in the population affected by  .3,4\nThe most representative epidemiological study esti-\nmated that nearly half of the pre-hurricane residents\nof the New Orleans Metropolitan Area and one-fourth\nof the pre-hurricane residents of the other areas\naffected by   had a DSM-IV anxiety-mood\ndisorder 5 months after the hurricane, with 30% of\nthose from New Orleans Metro and 12% of those from\nthe remainder of the hurricane area estimated to have\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).3\nThe destruction caused by Hurricane   has\nlingered much longer than that occurring after pre-\nvious hurricanes.5 Indeed, many people living in the\nareas affected by   continue to be without\nessential services 2 years after the storm. One might\nexpect from this that the typical pattern of recovery\nfrom post-disaster mental illness would be delayed.\nPrevious research has documented an inverse J-shaped\nrecovery curve for PTSD after traumatic events, with\nrecovery most rapid in the first year, more gradual in\nthe second year and stabilizing into chronicity after\n2 years.6 Although fewer studies have examined recovery\nafter natural disasters,7\u00ad9 the results are generally con-\nsistent with the larger literature in finding that a\nsubstantial proportion of post-traumatic mental illness\nresolves within 1 or 2 years. But there are exceptions. For\nexample, a longitudinal study of victims of the 1992\nHurricane Andrew in Florida carried out 6 and 30\nCorrespondence: Dr RC Kessler, Department of Health Care Policy,\nHarvard Medical School, 180 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA\nE-mail: kessler@hcp.med.harvard.edu\nwww.nature.com/mp\nmonths after the hurricane found that the prevalence of\nPTSD actually increased slightly over time.9 A similar\npattern has been found in long-term studies of refugees\nexposed to ongoing severe stress,10,11 whereas recovery\nhas been much more common in studies of refugees\nwhose objective life situations improved substan-\ntially.12,13 In the case of armed services personnel\nreturning from combat duty in Iraq and Afghanistan,\nthe even more extreme pattern has been found of PTSD\nsymptoms actually increasing over time.14,15\nIt would not be surprising, based on these results, if\na similar pattern of slow recovery or perhaps even an\nincrease in mental illness, compared to cases shortly\nafter the hurricane, was found in follow-up studies of\nsurvivors of Hurricane  . The current report\npresents data on this matter from the Hurricane\n  Community Advisory Group (CAG), a repre-\nsentative sample of pre-hurricane residents of the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-\ndefined areas in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi\ndirectly affected by  16\u00ad18 who agreed to\nparticipate in a series of tracking surveys over several\nyears to assess need for mental health services. The\nbaseline survey was carried out 5\u00ad7 months after\nthe hurricane and the first follow-up survey of the\nsame sample was carried out 1 year later. Results from\nthis two-wave panel sample are presented here on\ntrends in the prevalence and correlates of hurricane-\nrelated anxiety-mood disorders.\nThree results from the baseline CAG survey are\nnoteworthy as a backdrop to the current report. First,\nthe estimated prevalence of anxiety-mood disorders in\nthe baseline CAG survey was roughly twice as high as\nthe estimated prevalence found 3 years earlier using\nthe same measures in the sub-sample of the National\nComorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R)19 residing in\nareas subsequently affected by Hurricane  .4 We\nwill present data here on trends in this prevalence over\nthe subsequent year. Second, the socio-demographic\ncorrelates of these disorders were largely the same in\nthe CAG and the NCS-R, suggesting that the adverse\nmental health effects of Hurricane   were\nequally distributed across broad segments of the\npopulation. We will examine whether patterns of\nchange in these disorders over the subsequent year\nalso were consistent or varied across broad socio-\ndemographic segments of the population. Third, the\nprevalence of suicidality in the baseline CAG sample\nwas much lower than in the NCS-R despite the higher\nprevalence of anxiety-mood disorders. Subgroup ana-\nlysis traced this low prevalence of suicidality to\nwidespread feelings of optimism in the affected\npopulation that the practical problems of living created\nby the hurricane would soon be resolved. This\noptimism turned out to be unrealistic, as the subse-\nquent pace of government reconstruction efforts was\nslow. This raises the question whether the slow pace of\nrecovery resulted in a rise in the prevalence of\nsuicidality to a level more consistent with the high\nprevalence of anxiety-mood disorders in the popula-\ntion, a possibility that we evaluate here.\nMaterials and methods\nThe sample\nThe CAG target population was English-speaking\nadult (aged X18) pre-hurricane residents of the\ncounties (in Alabama and Mississippi) and parishes\n(in Louisiana) defined by FEMA as directly affected by\nHurricane   (www.fema.gov/hazard/hurricane/\n2005katrina). Pre-hurricane residents of these areas\nwere eligible for the sample regardless of whether they\nwere in these areas at the time of the hurricane and\nregardless of the extent they or their property were\naffected by the hurricane. Census data suggest that\nonly about 1% of this population was unable to speak\nEnglish, suggesting that the restriction of the sample to\nEnglish-speakers did not introduce major bias into the\nsample.\nRespondents were selected from three sampling\nframes: the telephone numbers (land lines and cell\nphones) of the roughly 1.4 million families that\napplied for assistance from the American Red Cross\n(ARC); a random-digit dial (RDD) telephone frame of\nhouseholds in the areas affected by the hurricane and\na supplemental sample of hotels that housed FEMA-\nsupported evacuees. Although the use of RDD might\nseem impractical in a population where many people\nevacuated, evacuation was much more common in\nNew Orleans Metro than the remainder of the affected\nareas. Furthermore, many evacuees had returned as of\nthe time of the survey. RDD was useful in contacting\nthese nonevacuees and returned evacuees. The vast\nmajority of evacuees, in comparison, applied to the\nARC for assistance and could be traced through\ncontact information provided in the ARC applications\nfor assistance. Other evacuees could be traced in the\nRDD sample through a call-forwarding service set up\nby Bell South in the wake of the hurricane that\nforwarded calls to phone numbers anywhere in the\ncountry requested by the person in whose name the\npre-hurricane phone was registered. More details on\nsampling and adjustment for overlap of the frames are\nreported at www.Hurricane .med.harvard.edu.\nThe baseline CAG survey was carried out between\nhurricane. A total of 1043 respondents completed\nthe interview, representing an estimated 41.9% of the\neligible households we screened. This low coopera-\ntion rate is due at least in part to the fact that we\nrequired a commitment from respondents for long-\nterm involvement in the CAG in order to participate\nin the baseline survey, as the main goal of the CAG\nwas to track the progress of recovery over time. An\nanalysis of data obtained from the full screening\nsample found that those who did not join the CAG\nwere similar to participants on all socio-demographic\nvariables, but had a somewhat higher level of self-\nreported hurricane-related stress exposure (assessed\nby asking respondents to rate their hurricane-related\nstress exposure on a 0\u00ad10 scale where 0 meant `no\nstress at all' and 10 meant `the most stress you can\nimagine a person having') and more psychological\nPsychiatric trends after Hurricane  \nRC Kessler et al\nMolecular Psychiatry\ndistress (assessed with a short series of questions\nabout frequency of common anxiety-mood symp-\ntoms). The median and inter-quartile range (IQR:\n25th\u00ad75th percentiles) of reported hurricane-related\nThe median and IQR of reported psychological\ndistress on a scale scored to have a 0\u00ad10 theoretical\nwas applied to the baseline CAG data to adjust for\nthese response biases. A within-household probabi-\nlity of selection weight was also used along with\na post-stratification weight to adjust for residual\ndiscrepancies between the CAG and the 2000 Census\npopulation on a range of social, demographic and pre-\nhurricane housing variables. The consolidated CAG\nsample weight, finally, was trimmed to increase\ndesign efficiency based on evidence that trimming\ndid not significantly affect the estimated prevalence\nof anxiety-mood disorders.\nDetailed personal contact information (current and\npermanent addresses, land line and cell phone\nnumbers, email addresses) and tracing information\n(contact information for three people who would\nknow how to find the respondent if he/she moved)\nwas obtained for all baseline CAG respondents. This\ninformation was used to find baseline respondents for\na follow-up survey carried out 1 year after the initial\ninterview. Some 815 of the baseline respondents were\nsuccessfully traced and interviewed in this follow-up\nsurvey (78.1% of the baseline sample). Minor differ-\nences in the composition of the follow-up sample\ncompared to the baseline sample in socio-demo-\ngraphic characteristics, traumatic stress exposure\nand mental health were adjusted for by using a\npropensity score adjustment weight20 applied to the\nconsolidated baseline weight.\nMeasures\nAnxiety-mood disorders. The K6 scale of nonspecific\npsychological distress21 was used to screen for\nDSM-IV anxiety-mood disorders within 30 days of\nindependent validation studies have shown the K6\nhas an area under the receiver operating characteristic\nDSM-IV anxiety-mood disorders that meet the\nseverity criteria for the Substance Abuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration's definition of serious\nmental illness (SMI)25 when compared to diagnoses\ngenerated from comprehensive diagnostic interviews.\nBased on these K6 validation studies, scores of 13\u00ad24\nwere classified probable SMI, while scores of 8\u00ad12\nwere classified probable mild\u00admoderate mental\nillness (MMI) and scores of 0\u00ad7 were classified\nprobable noncases. The designation of MMI is a\nresidual definition of respondents estimated to meet\ncriteria for a DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorder but not\nSMI. Previous research has shown that MMI is of\nconsiderable public health importance because of its\nhigh prevalence, burden and risk of transition to\nA small clinical reappraisal study of five respon-\ndents selected randomly from each of these three K6\ncategories (SMI, MMI and noncase) was carried out\nwith the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV\n(SCID).27 The syndromes assessed were DSM-IV major\ndepressive episode, panic disorder, generalized anxi-\nety disorder, PTSD, agoraphobia, social phobia and\nspecific phobia. Serious mental illness was defined as\na DSM-IV diagnosis with a global assessment of\ndiagnosis with a global assessment of functioning of\nX61. The SCID interviews confirmed K6 classifica-\ntions for 14 of 15 respondents. The exception was a\nrespondent classified as having SMI by the K6 but\nMMI by the SCID based on a global assessment of\nrequired to diagnose SMI). These results, although\nbased on only a small sample, suggest that the K6 has\nexcellent psychometric properties (estimated in the\nSCID sample weighted to adjust for the sample-wide\nK6 distribution), including sensitivity (1.0 for SMI,\nGiven the special importance of PTSD in trauma\nsituations, a separate PTSD screen was included\nbased on the 12-item Trauma Screening Question-\nnaire (TSQ),29 a validated screen for PTSD.30 Our\nversion differed from the original TSQ in using\ndimensional response options rather than a simple\nyes\u00adno response format to assess 30-day symptom\nfrequency (never, less than once a week, about once a\nweek, two to four days a week and almost every day).\nA clinical reappraisal study was carried out to\ncalibrate TSQ responses to DSM-IV PTSD with 30\nrespondents judging possible cases and 10 randomly\nselecting others. A cut-point on the factor-based 0\u00ad42\nscale of TSQ responses (12 items, each scored 0\u00ad4) of\n20 \u00fe was selected to approximate the SCID PTSD\nprevalence in the weighted (to adjust for over-\nsampling of screened positives) clinical reappraisal\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(0.91) were all excellent for this dichotomous screen.\nSuicidality. Suicidality was assessed with questions\nabout the occurrence of suicidal ideation (`seriously\nthinking about killing yourself'), plans and attempts\nwithin the past 12 months using questions originally\ndeveloped for the National Comorbidity Survey.31\nHurricane-related stressors. The baseline survey\nincluded 29 structured questions developed based\non pilot interviews about hurricane-related stressors.\nThese included traumatic stressors that occurred at\nthe time of the hurricane (for example, death of a\nloved one, a life-threatening experience that occurred\nto the respondent), highly stressful experiences that\noccurred in the aftermath (for example, homelessness,\nPsychiatric trends after Hurricane  \nRC Kessler et al\nMolecular Psychiatry\nphysical adversity) and chronic stressful experiences\nthat occurred in the first 5\u00ad7 months after the\nhurricane (for example, geographic dislocation,\nfinancial adversity). The latter set of questions was\nrepeated in the follow-up survey. In addition,\nrespondents were asked to provide a quantitative\nrating of the overall stressfulness of their situation by\nreporting `how stressful overall' they would say their\nexperiences related to the hurricane and aftermath\nwere on a 0\u00ad10 scale `where 0 means not at all\nstressful and 10 means the most stressful thing you\ncan imagine.' Based on the finding that responses to\nthe structured questions about specific stressors were\nstrongly related to responses to the global rating\nquestion, we focus on trends in responses to the latter\nquestion in the current report, distinguishing\nrespondents who reported severe (9\u00ad10), serious\nSocio-demographics. We examined associations of\nthe mental health outcomes with a number of socio-\ndemographic variables, including the respondent's\nage, sex, race/ethnicity, family income in the year\nbefore the hurricane, education, current health\ninsurance coverage and current living situation. Age\nwas coded non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic black\nand other (largely Hispanics and Asians). Family\nincome was coded in quartiles, where low was\ndefined as less than or equal to 0.5 of the\npopulation median on the ratio of per tax income to\nnumber of family members, while low-average was\ndefined 0.5 \u00fe through 1.0 on the same ratio, high-\naverage 1.0 \u00fe through 3 and high 3 \u00fe on this ratio.\nYears of education were coded in four categories:\n(college graduate). Health insurance was coded yes\u00ad\nno. Current living situation, finally, was coded in four\ncategories: living in the same house as before the\nhurricane, in the same county/parish but not the same\nhouse, in the same state but not the same county/\nparish and in a different state.\nAnalysis methods\nCross tabulations were used to examine patterns of\nonset, recovery and persistence of estimated DSM-IV\nanxiety-mood disorders that qualify for the designa-\ntions of SMI and MMI and of suicidal ideation, plans\nand attempts. The significance of differences in these\nprevalence estimates between the baseline and\nfollow-up surveys was evaluated using within-\nrespondent paired comparison tests. The effects of\nsocio-demographic variables and stress measures in\npredicting trends in these outcomes were estimated\nusing logistic regression analysis.32 When the baseline\nvalue of the outcome variable is included as a control\nin such equations to predict outcomes at the time of\nfollow-up, as it is here, the regression coefficients can\nbe interpreted as predictors of change in the out-\ncomes.33 In the absence of estimated interactions\nbetween the substantive predictors and the baseline\nmeasure of the outcome, the effects of the predictors\non change are assumed to be the same in predicting\nonset and absence of remission of the outcome. In\norder to determine whether the associations of the\npredictors with onset and absence of remission differ,\nwe evaluated the statistical significance of interac-\ntions of substantive predictors with baseline mea-\nsures of each outcome. Logistic regression coefficients\nand their standard errors were exponentiated to create\nodds-ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%\nCI's) for ease of interpretation. Because the data were\nweighted, the Taylor series linearization method34\nwas used to calculate design-based significance tests.\nMultivariate significance was evaluated using Wald's\nw2 tests based on design-corrected coefficient\nvariance\u00adcovariance matrices. Statistical significance\nwas evaluated using two-sided 0.05-level tests.\nResults\nTrends in DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorders and\nsuicidality\nThe estimated prevalence of any anxiety-mood\ndisorder did not change significantly between the\nbaseline survey (30.7%) and the follow-up survey\npositive (Table 1).

A similar\npattern exists for PTSD, where the majority of follow-\nup cases either already had PTSD at baseline (47.3%)\nor progressed from baseline SMI, MMI or suicidal\nPsychiatric trends after Hurricane  \nRC Kessler et al\nMolecular Psychiatry\nare delayed onsets (that is, no SMI, MMI and no\nsuicidal ideation at baseline). The proportions of\ndelayed onsets are comparable for suicidal ideation\n(24.1%) and somewhat higher for suicide plans\n(46.6%), while the proportions with persistence\nare lower than those for SMI and PTSD. The propor-\ntions that represent progressions (that is, from base-\nline cases with SMI, MMI or PTSD) are higher for\nsuicidal ideation (59.3%) than for SMI or PTSD and\ncomparable for suicide plans (27.4%) compared to SMI\nand PTSD.\nIt is noteworthy that the majority of respondents\nwith baseline SMI (51.1%) continued to have SMI at\nfollow-up, while 30.8% improved (that is, were\nclassified as having MMI, PTSD or suicidal ideation\nat follow-up but not longer classified as having SMI)\nand only a relatively small minority (18.1%) recov-\nered (that is, no longer met criteria either for any of\nthe following: SMI, MMI, PTSD, and suicidal idea-\ntion; Table 2, Part II). In the case of PTSD, 66.4% of\nbaseline cases continued to have PTSD at follow-up,\nwhile an additional 16.9% were classified as having\nMMI, SMI or suicidal ideation but not PTSD at follow-\nup, and only 16.7% recovered.

Respondent age\nsignificantly predicts increased prevalence of PTSD\n(highest increases among respondents ages 40\u00ad59)\nand suicidal ideation (highest increases among\nrespondents ages 18\u00ad39). Low family income predicts\nincreased prevalence of all three outcomes.

While significant in statistical\nterms, these associations are not strong in substantive\nterms.

As\na result, we cannot determine whether the significant\nsocio-demographic predictors are predicting delayed\nonsets of the outcomes, persistence or both.\nThe effects of hurricane-related stress\nOne possible explanation for the significant increases\nin the prevalence estimates of SMI, PTSD and suicidal\nideation is that hurricane-related stresses might have\nincreased over time due to the slow pace of recovery\nefforts. As it turns out, though, this is not the case. A\nsignificantly lower proportion of respondents re-\nported hurricane-related stress in the follow-up\nexists both in the New Orleans Metro sub-sample\nP < 0.001). The decrease exists not only for stress\nthat the SMI-PTSD increases exist only in the sub-\nsample exclusive of the New Orleans Metro Area, that\nthe decrease in hurricane-related stress is less\npronounced in New Orleans Metro than the remain-\nder of the sample. Indeed, the prevalence of stress in\nthe follow-up survey is significantly higher in the\nNew Orleans Metro sub-sample than in the remainder\nmeans that higher levels of residual hurricane-related\nstress cannot explain the fact that SMI-PTSD pre-\nvalence increased over time only among respondents\nnot from the New Orleans Metro Area.\nAnother possibility is that the psychological effects of\nhurricane-related stresses increased over time even\nthough the magnitude of the stresses themselves\ndecreased. A comparison of the cross-sectional associa-\ntions between hurricane-related stresses and the out-\ncomes finds some superficial support for this possibility\nwith regard to SMI, as the ORs linking stress with SMI\nin the follow-up survey are consistently larger than the\nparallel ORs in the baseline survey (Table 5). However,\nthese differences are not statistically significant\nTable 3 The effects of socio-demographic variables in predicting trends in estimated DSM-IV SMI and PTSD and suicidal\nideation in the panel sample (n = 815)a\nSMI PTSD Suicidal ideation\nAge\nIncome\nLiving situation\nDifferent town 1.0 --\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; OR, odd ratio; PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder; SMI, serious mental illness.\n*Significant association with the trend at the 0.05 level, two-sided test.\naMultivariate logistic regression models controlling for baseline values of the outcome variable and for differences between\nthe New Orleans Metro sub-sample and the remainder of the sample. Results are reported only for the total sample, not the\ntwo sub-samples, because no significant differences in results were found in the New Orleans Metro sub-sample versus the\nremainder of the sample (detailed results available on request).\nPsychiatric trends after Hurricane  \nRC Kessler et al\nMolecular Psychiatry\npronounced in the New Orleans Metro sub-sample than\nin the remainder of the sample (w4\ndetailed results available on request) This means that\nheightened reactivity to hurricane-related stress cannot\nexplain the fact that the significant increase in SMI is\nconfined to respondents in the sub-sample exclusive of\nthe New Orleans Metro Area. Furthermore, the pattern\nof higher ORs at follow-up than baseline does not hold\neither for PTSD or for suicidal ideation. In the case of\nsuicidal ideation, the rarity of the outcome required the\nstress measures to be dichotomized (severe stress vs all\nothers) to stabilize parameter estimates.\nThe model was expanded to study the effects of\nhurricane-related stress on trends in SMI, PTSD and\nsuicidal ideation. This was carried out by adding a\ncontrol for the baseline value of the outcome to the\nprediction equation along with measures of stress\nassessed in both surveys.

Stress exposure in\nthis model is associated with substantial variation in\nboth SMI and PTSD at follow-up, with ORs for serious-\nand socio-demographics.\nA good way to grasp the substantive significance of\nthese results is to examine standardized prevalence\nestimates of the outcomes SMI and PTSD at follow-\nup. The latter are prevalence estimates in which\nadjustments have been made to correct for the\nassociations of stress with baseline values of the\noutcomes, socio-demographics and sub-sample, so\nthat the effects of stress can be seen distinct from the\neffects of these other variables.

If we think of these associations\nas causal, the population-attributable risk proportions\nof SMI and PTSD due to hurricane-related stress\n(that is, the proportions of currently existing SMI\nand PTSD that would be expected to remit if all\nhurricane-related stress was resolved) are 89.2% for\nSMI and 31.9% for PTSD. (Detailed results available\nupon request.)\nThe best-fitting model is different for suicidal\nideation, as baseline stress and stress at follow-up\n(both dichotomized to severe-serious vs all others due\nto the rarity of the outcome and the nonlinearity of the\nassociation with hurricane-related stress) interact in\npredicting trends in suicidal ideation (w4\nP = 0.007). The best-fitting model is one that distin-\nguishes respondents with severe-serious hurricane-\nrelated stress in one or both surveys vs all others.\nAn additional complication, though, is that the effect\nof stress in this model differs significantly between\nthe New Orleans Metro sub-sample and the remainder\nof the sample (w4\nsubstantially higher among respondents not from the\nNew Orleans Metro Area (104.1) than from New\nOrleans Metro (2.2). The prevalence estimates of\nsuicidal ideation at follow-up among respondents\nwith severe-serious hurricane-related stress are 3.1%\nin the New Orleans Metro sub-sample and 13.0% in\nthe remainder of the sample compared to 0.3 and\n0.0% among respondents without severe hurricane-\nrelated stress. If we think of these associations as\ncausal, the population-attributable risk proportion of\nsuicidal ideation associated with severe-serious hur-\nricane-related stress is 61.6% in the total sample.\n(Detailed results available upon request.)\nDiscussion\nFour principal limitations of the study need to be\nnoted. First, mental disorders were estimated with\nscreening scales rather than with clinical interviews.\nIt should be noted, though, that the K6 screening scale\nmodified TSQ was found to be valid in our clinical\nreappraisal study. Nonetheless, screening scales are\ninevitably less precise than clinical interviews,\ngenerally leading to associations being attenuated.\nBased on this fact, the results reported here about\npredictors are likely to be conservative. Second, the\nbaseline CAG survey response rate was low and the\nsampling frame excluded people who were unreach-\nable by telephone. These problems presumably led to\nthe most marginalized segments of the population\nbeing under-represented in the sample, making the\nTable 6 The effects of hurricane-related stresses in predicting trends in estimated DSM-IV SMI and PTSD and suicidal ideation\nin the panel sample along with standardized prevalence estimates of the outcomes (n = 815)a\nSMI PTSD Suicidal ideation\nNew Orleans Metro Remainder of the sample\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; OR, odd ratio; PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder; SMI, serious mental illness.\n*Significant difference from respondents with no hurricane-related stress (scores of 0\u00ad2 on the 0\u00ad10 scale) at the 0.05 level of\nsignificance.\naMultivariate logistic regression models controlling for socio-demographics, baseline values of the outcome variable and\ndifferences between the New Orleans Metro sub-sample and the remainder of the sample. No significant differences in\nresults were found in the New Orleans Metro sub-sample versus the remainder of the sample (detailed results available on\nrequest).\nbStandardized prevalence estimates adjusting for the associations of stress levels with all other predictors in the models.\nPsychiatric trends after Hurricane  \nRC Kessler et al\nMolecular Psychiatry\nprevalence estimates reported here of anxiety-mood\ndisorders and hurricane-related stress conservative.\nThird, the ratings of hurricane-related stress were\nretrospective and subjective, raising concerns about\nbias related to current emotional functioning. Fourth,\neven though we interpreted the associations between\nhurricane-related stress and the outcome measures in\ncausal terms, it is possible that unmeasured common\ncauses (for example, pre-hurricane history of psycho-\npathology that influenced stressor exposure and post-\nhurricane mental illness) influenced the observed\nassociations. Caution is consequently needed in\ninterpreting these associations.\nWithin the context of these limitations, the pre-\nvalence estimates of anxiety-mood disorders both at\nbaseline and in the follow-up survey in the New\nOrleans Metro sub-sample are considerably higher\nthan those found in previous surveys of mental illness\nafter natural disasters in the United States, while the\nprevalence estimates in the remainder of the sample\nare comparable to those in previous studies.35,36\nPrevious reviews have noted that comparisons of\nprevalence estimates across disasters is challenging\ndue to the wide range of disaster experiences to which\npeople in disasters are exposed. However, broadly\nspeaking, the higher prevalence estimates of anxiety-\nmood disorders in the New Orleans Metro sub-sample\nare consistent with the results of studies that\nconsidered persons in highly disaster affected\nareas,37,38 while the lower prevalence estimates in\nthe remainder of the sample are consistent with the\nresults of previous studies in areas with lower\nThe significant increase in prevalence estimates of\nSMI, PTSD and suicidal ideation plans are different\nfrom the patterns found in other longitudinal surveys\nof mental illness after natural disasters, where\nprevalence typically decreases.7\u00ad9 As noted in the\nIntroduction, even in cases where there is no\ndecrease, the typical pattern is for prevalence to\nremain stable for some time rather than to increase\nsignificantly9 The increasing prevalence of SMI,\nPTSD and suicidal ideation plans in the CAG is\nconsequently striking.\nThe fact that the increases in SMI and PTSD are\nconfined to respondents not from the New Orleans\nMetro Area is difficult to interpret in light of the\nhigher levels of hurricane-related stress both at base-\nline and at follow-up in the New Orleans Metro sub-\nsample. It is possible to speculate post hoc that the\nmuch greater media attention directed at New Orleans\nthan the other areas affected by   might have led\nto a greater sense of abandonment among affected\npeople not from the New Orleans Metro Area, but we\nhave no data to evaluate this interpretation. Another\npossibility is that the increases in SMI, PTSD and\nsuicidality are partly due to increases in stressors that\nmight only be indirectly linked to the hurricane. This\npossibility is consistent with evidence from several\nlongitudinal studies that low-intensity ongoing stres-\nsors significantly predict long-term PTSD, presumably\nbecause these nagging stressors erode the resistance\nresources that would otherwise promote recovery.41,42\nHowever, it is unclear why such stressors might be\nmore prevalent among people not from the New\nOrleans Metro Area than from New Orleans Metro.\nFinally, there is the possibility that psychological\nvulnerability to such stressors is higher among people\nnot from the New Orleans Metro Area and that this\nheightened vulnerability explains why the increases\nin SMI and PTSD documented here were confined to\nthis sub-sample. Exactly this kind of difference was\nfound in our analysis of the association between\nresidual hurricane-related stress and suicidal ideation.\nHowever, caution is needed in interpreting this result\ndue to the small number of respondents with suicidal\nideation and the wide confidence interval of the\nestimated OR in the sub-sample of respondents not\nfrom New Orleans Metro.\nThe findings that young people, people with low\nsocio-economic status and people who were geogra-\nphically displaced are at comparatively high risk of\nanxiety-mood disorders and are consistent with\npreviously documented correlates of mental illness\nthough, these associations are modest in magnitude,\nsuggesting that the mental illness associated with\nHurricane   is distributed across the full range\nof the socio-demographic spectrum of the affected\npopulation. It is noteworthy in this regard that the\nsignificant upward trends in SMI, PTSD and suicid-\nality were found to be unrelated to sex, race/ethnicity,\neducation and health insurance status.\nThese results lead to four conclusions. First,\nhurricane-related stress clearly is playing a critical\nrole in the high prevalence of hurricane-related\nanxiety-mood disorders in this population. Second,\nthe fact that the associations between these stresses\nand the mental health outcomes considered here were\nstronger among affected people from areas other than\nthe New Orleans Metro Area suggests that undeter-\nmined stress and/or vulnerability factors are present\namong people from areas other than New Orleans\nMetro that should lead policy makers to focus special\nattention on the needs of these people. It is note-\nworthy that the opposite pattern was found in an\nearlier analysis of anxiety-mood disorders in the\nbaseline survey, where effects of the stressors that\noccurred during the hurricane and the immediate\naftermath were stronger in the New Orleans Metro\nsub-sample than the remainder of the sample.3 It is\nunclear why this geographic variation has reversed in\nthe subsequent year. Third, the observation that these\nadverse effects are only weakly related to socio-\ndemographic variables means that efforts to address\nthe needs for mental health treatment in this popula-\ntion need to deal with all segments of the population\nrather than target only specific high-risk population\nsegments. Fourth, the fact that hurricane-related\nstressors were still quite common in the population\nat the time of our follow-up assessment, which\noccurred nearly 2 years after the hurricane, and that\nPsychiatric trends after Hurricane  \nRC Kessler et al\nMolecular Psychiatry\nhigh proportions of the outcomes at follow-up were\nattributable to these continuing stresses suggests that\nefforts to address the problem of increased mental\nillness and suicidal ideation-plans among people\naffected by Hurricane   will require efficient\nprovision of practical and logistical assistance to deal\nwith the high remaining levels of stress. This may be\nparticularly challenging when it comes to helping\npre-hurricane residents of the affected areas who are\nnow living elsewhere in the country, but it is\nespecially important to reach these geographically\ndisplaced people because of their comparatively high\nrisk of SMI.\n"
