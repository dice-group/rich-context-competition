Introduction\nExcept for sexual assaults, it is a truism that men suffer more violent victimiza-\ntions than women. Consequently, social scientists have neglected gender as a va-\nriable of importance in the study of violent crime (Zimring, 2006). The result has\nbeen criminological and victimological research taking on an androcentric tone\nthat placed importance on men and overlooked crime against women (Cook,\nHow to cite this paper: Savard, D.

M. Savard\nbeen conducted on the long-term trends of male and female homicide victimiza-\nFreilich, 2005) as well as non-lethal victimization. To date, most studies that\nhave examined the gender gap in crime have focused on the long-term trends in\nmale and female victimization (Langton, et al., 2013). Indeed, this important\nbody of work has showed that the gender gap in crime is closing regarding vic-\ntimization, most notably for aggravated and simple assaults (Lauritsen & Heimer\nThe aim of this study is to examine the victimization of women in transit en-\nvironments and other public spaces that are often found near transit environ-\nments, and how the gender gap in victimization is affected within these spaces.\nThis is done by comparing 1) the types of crime women are targets of; 2) the\ntypes of public spaces women experience victimization; and 3) how transit envi-\nronments and public spaces shape victimization for women. The present study\nuses data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation by examining the victimiza-\ntion of women within transit environments and public spaces, and will fill in the\ngap of past research that examined the trends in victimization of women and\nmen. Routine activity theory will be used to explain how transit environments\nand public spaces shape victimization differently for women and men in terms\nof vulnerability to victimization. This study will explore how victimization varies\nwithin transit environments and public spaces often found adjacent to transit\nstops, and the types of crime women are victims of in these environments.\n2. Routine Activity Theory\nRoutine activities theory (RAT) is an influential perspective criminologists use to\nstudy what makes it possible for a criminal event to occur. Cohen and Felson\n(1979) explain that there are three necessary conditions for a crime to occur.\nSpecifically, crimes occur when a motivated offender, a suitable target, and the\nlack of a capable guardian come together in time and space. Environmental and\nland-use features may influence a motivated offender to victimize a woman in a\nparking lot with a connected bus stop (Loukaitou-Sideris, 1999).\nThe term \"suitable target\" was purposefully chosen by Cohen and Felson\n(1979) rather than \"victim\" because they wanted to include property as targets of\ncrime, in addition to people. The term \"capable guardian\" was chosen over police\nbecause informal guardians such as members of the public can also provide guar-\ndianship. Therefore, bystanders who happen to be around when the crime is being\ncommitted can be more effective capable guardians than the police, insofar as they\nare present when the crime takes place (Savard, Kelley, & Merolla, 2017).\nAn important aspect of RAT regards the convergence of the three concepts\ndescribed above in time and space. This convergence occurs in the routine activ-\nities of people as they go about their lives. Therefore, much of crime is a mun-\nD. M. Savard\ndane phenomenon that occurs during everyday life, rather than in exciting and\nabnormal circumstances. Cohen and Felson (1979) argued that predatory type\ncrimes were increasing in the United States in post-World War II because people\nwere venturing out of the household more, and leaving property unattended,\nunlike in past time periods.\n3. Research on Transit Environments and Other Public Spaces\nThe American Public Transportation Association in 2015 reported that 653 U.S.\npublic transportation systems operated buses in urban environments and 525\noperated buses in rural areas. Undoubtedly, many of the routes taken by these\nbuses had stops at or near shopping malls, grocery stores, universities, and\nparking lots/garages. This same association reports that for the third of Ameri-\ncans who resided in rural communities, public transportation was vital for them\nin terms of having access to education, shopping, entertainment, and employ-\nment. In fact, it was reported that 12% of public transportation users (e.g., bus\nriders) in 2013 used public transportation to get to and from school, such as a\nuniversity. In other words, public transit users may have to rely solely on public\ntransportation thereby rendering them \"transit captives\" because they have no\nother means of traveling when performing routine activities. Because females\nhave been identified as using public transit at higher rates (Yu & Smith, 2014),\nthey may have a higher risk of victimization in transit environments based on\noffenders' perceptions of vulnerability and target suitability. The nexus of per-\nceived vulnerabilities with transit environments in areas experiencing social dis-\norganization (Shaw & McKay, 1972) can exacerbate an already increased risk of\nvictimization. It may be that women are more vulnerable to victimization based\non perpetrators' perceptions of women being a \"suitable target.\"Female robbers,\nfor example, have been found to purposely target female victims because they\nview them as more vulnerable and least likely to resist (Miller, 1998).\nSome universities have bus lines dedicated to the thousands of university stu-\ndents, faculty, and staff to relieve crowding and reduce parking costs. The\nAmerican Public Transportation Association (2007) also reports that strategi-\ncally placing residential and commercial development near public transportation\nis a growing practice. This practice is referred to as Transit-Oriented Develop-\nment where housing, shopping, educational institutions, and employment are\nwithin reasonable walking distance to public transportation. Indeed, practices\nsuch as these coalesce shopping centers, grocery stores, universities, and parking\nlots/ garages with transit environments. This is important because research has\nshown a concentration of bus stops can have an impact on the overall crime rate\nin the surrounding area (Kooi, 2013). Research has also found that some public\nhave an impact on the overall crime rate for adjacent public spaces.\nTransit environments and public spaces, such as bus stops, shopping centers\nand grocery stores, can provide for the coming together of a motivated offender,\nD. M. Savard\nsuitable target, and lack of a capable of guardian where the motivated offender\nmay not be deterred because of his or her rationalizations of the number of vic-\ntims and the likelihood of not being apprehended for lack of capable guardians.\nPublic locations may serve as a \"critical intensity zone\" wherein there are\nenough suitable targets to attract motivated offenders but not enough capable\nguardians to deter them (Angel, 1968; Block & Block, 2000). The bystander effect\nand a desire for anonymity by citizens may also contribute to the victimization\nof suitable targets in public spaces (Chekroun & Brauer, 2002). Fear of crime in\nthese settings can influence the routine activities of people as well (Ceccato,\nal., 2014). In addition to this fear of crime, people may expect to experience an\nunpleasant event, such as observing a suicide on train tracks, while using the\nservices of a railway station (Shibata, et al., 2014). Transit environments within\npublic spaces can also serve as crime generators (Brantingham & Brantingham,\n1995). Crime generators are spaces offenders are attracted to, but do not have\ninherent criminogenic characteristics. Therefore, transit environments situated\nin or adjacent to certain public spaces can attract potential perpetrators.\nTransit environments may also foster offenders' journey to crime (Phillips,\n1980), but research has found little support that public transportation introduces\nnon-residential offenders to new hunting grounds (Sedelmaier, 2014). Crime at-\ntractors, on the other hand, produce crime in and of themselves because of the\nnature of their environment. Therefore, bus stops located near crime attracting\nenvironments such as bars, vacant/abandoned buildings, and derelict motels can\ncontribute to a criminogenic environment where people are waiting for buses and\nconsequently victimized (Loukaitou-Sideris, 1999). Because street robberies can\ncluster in time and space and occur in high traffic areas such as transit terminals\n(Glasner & Leitner, 2016) and areas surrounding bus stops have been identified as\nhaving higher rates of violent victimizations (Block & Davis, 1996; Caplan, et al.,\n2012), the concept of near-repeat victimization based on the closeness transit\nenvironments have to high risk locations can exacerbate an already criminogenic\nenvironment that are \"risky facilities\" to begin with (Clarke & Eck, 2007).\nHowever, research has identified a higher likelihood of robbery victimization\nwhen a bus stop is located near an ATM compared to only an ATM, but a lower\nrisk of robbery victimization when a bus stop is located near a bar compared to\nonly a bar (Hart & Miethe, 2014). Robbers tend to commit robberies in places\nthat fall within their routine travels and are close to their homes. The idea is that\nrobbers are not only more comfortable with operating in places they routinely\ntravel, but they may be aware of security measures meant to stop them before a\nrobbery is committed or apprehend them after a robbery is committed. There-\nfore, not only will robbers rationally choose to prey upon women because of\ntheir perceived vulnerable state, but will rationally pick an area close to their\nhome because this increases their chances of successfully victimizing women and\ndecreases their chances of being caught (Wright & Decker, 1997). Certainly, the\nD. M. Savard\nnumber of women and men who occupy any one location needs to be consi-\ndered when examining the situational contexts of criminal victimization, but\nperceived vulnerabilities from the perspective of the perpetrator can start to ex-\nplain why women may be more likely to be victimized in transit environments.\n4. Gendered Nature of Spaces\nGender expectations and the femininity and masculinity attached to gender help\nproduce the creation of gendered spaces such as the workplace and community\n(Spain, 1992). It is not so much a gendered space by its very nature as it is con-\nsidered a gendered space based on the feminine and masculine behaviors per-\nformed by women and men. In other words, behaviors at grocery stores and\nshopping malls are influenced by ideas of femininity and masculinity and what it\nmeans to be a woman or man. As people go about their routine activities\nthroughout the day, they travel to and visit places which are designated spaces\nfor men and women. Gender is intimately tied to society and has a profound\nimpact on how males and females act in particular social contexts. Therefore,\nshopping for clothes or groceries has feminine and masculine qualities attached\nto them. Gendered spaces are dependent upon what society says is appropriate\nbehavior for women and men and this determines if the behaviors performed at\neach respective location are considered feminine or masculine. Societal expecta-\ntions as they relate to gender heavily influence individuals' routine activities. In\nturn, broad social structural patterns influence violent victimization. For exam-\nple, macro-historical events and how women and men come to occupy certain\nspaces in society can explain how victimization is place based and translates into\npotential dangerous spaces. Specifically, women occupy these spaces because of\nstructural forces and historical influences, and consequently may be at a partic-\nular risk of criminal victimization in such spaces. However, the increased risk of\nvictimization is not linked to the behaviors being performed in each respective\ngendered space; rather, it may be that women are more vulnerable to victimiza-\ntion based on perpetrators' perceptions of women being a \"suitable target.\"It\ncould be the gendered nature of grocery stores and shopping centers that con-\ntribute to the number of women and men who occupy them where the prepon-\nderance of women and men occupying such spaces place them at an increased\nrisk of victimization based on vulnerability (Savard, Kelley, & Merolla, 2017).\n5. Hypotheses\nHypothesis 1: It is expected that females will be more likely than males to be vic-\ntimized in transit terminals, shopping centers, grocery stores, parking lot/garages,\nand universities.\nHypothesis 2: It is expected that females will be more likely than males to be\nthe victim of a simple assault in transit terminals, shopping centers, grocery\nstores, parking lot/garages, and universities.\nHypothesis 3: It is expected that females will be more likely than males to be\nD. M. Savard\nthe victim of an aggravated assault in transit terminals, shopping centers, gro-\ncery stores, parking lot/garages, and universities.\nHypothesis 4: It is expected that females will be more likely than males to be\nthe victim of a robbery in transit terminals, shopping centers, grocery stores,\nparking lot/garages, and universities.\n6. Data and Methods\nThe present study will use data from the National Incident-Based Reporting\nSystem (NIBRS) for the year 2014. Unlike the Uniform Crime Reporting System\n(UCR) which collects data at the aggregate level, the NIBRS collects incident-\nlevel data. Furthermore, the NIBRS expands the level of collection by including\n46 Group A Offenses, whereas the level of collection by the UCR only includes\neight Index offenses (Addington, 2007). A major advantage of the NIBRS is that\nthe victim type is identified (i.e., individual or business) and victims' demo-\ngraphic information is also collected. The location of where the incident oc-\ncurred is also collected in the NIBRS.\nThe purpose for conducting this project is to analyze data of simple assaults,\naggravated assaults, robberies, sexual assaults, and kidnappings that occur in\ntransit terminals and other public locations. A major goal of this study is to ex-\namine if the study variable locations are related to the gender gap in victimiza-\nin the 2014 NIBRS data. Of these numbers, females represented 65.1% of simple\nassault victims, 49.4% of aggravated assault victims, 86.9% of sexual assault vic-\ntims, 33.6% of robbery victims, and 83.9% of kidnapping victims. Notwith-\nstanding simple assaults, sexual assaults, and kidnappings, more men than\nwomen were aggravated assault and robbery victims. This research project will\nhypothesize that the likelihood of female victimization will be greater when ex-\namined in the context of transit environments and other public locations.\n7. Measures\n7.1. Dependent Variable\nAll of the variables in the study will include a series of dummy variables. Gender\nwill represent the one dependent variable in this study. Gender will be coded as a\ndummy variable, with males coded as 0 and females coded as 1. Unfortunately,\nthe data does not allow for examining other gender categories, such as trans-\ngendered individuals. The use of female as a dependent variable is not to predict\ngender. The study is using characteristics of a crime to discover the likelihood\nthat the victim is male or female.1\n1Each case in the data represents a criminal incident. The gender variable in the dataset represents a\nperson who was either a female victim or male victim. Therefore, within a given incident, the models\nare examining what the likelihood is that the victim is female or male. The models are not predicting\ntheir gender. For example, if one could imagine a large silo that contains crime victims, what would\nbe the likelihood that we would pull out a female victim or male victim?\nD. M. Savard\n7.2. Independent Variables\nTarget suitability will be operationalized using the victim's age and time of day.\n- 64, and 65+. The reference category will be victims 17 years of age and young-\ner. Time of day was coded into three separate dummy variables: 7 a.m. to 11\na.m., 12 p.m. to 4 p.m., and 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. The reference category will be 12\na.m. to 6 a.m.\nPerceptions that a victim or a law enforcement officer has regarding if an of-\nfender was using alcohol or drugs will be used to operationalize offender moti-\nvation. Routine activity theory assumes that offenders are rational beings who\nweigh the costs relative to the benefits before committing a crime. Therefore, an\noffender not under the influence of alcohol or drugs may be more effective in\nterms of evaluating the presence of capable guardians, particularly in public lo-\ncations. Motivated offenders not inhibited by alcohol or drug use may be more\nlikely to seek out environments where a pool of suitable targets is available. It is\npredicted that offenders who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs will be\nless likely to commit crimes against women.\nGuardianship will be operationalized using one indicator, where the incident\ntook place. NIBRS provides a comprehensive list of locations where criminal\nevents took place.2 Five public locations will be examined: grocery stores, shop-\nping centers, parking lots, universities, and transit terminals. Location will in-\nclude five dummy variables: grocery store (0 = No, 1 = Yes), shopping center (0\n= No, 1 = Yes), parking lot (0 = No, 1 = Yes), university (0 = No, 1 = Yes) and\ntransit terminal (0 = No, 1 = Yes). Notwithstanding transit terminals, the loca-\ntion variables were chosen to be included in the analysis because it is not un-\ncommon to find transit terminals, such as bus stops, located at or adjacent to\nthem.\nThere will be a number of control variables in the study, along with a number\nof interactions. The victim's race will be a control measure by using two dummy\nvariables, black and white, with other race serving as the reference category. The\nrelationship that the victim has with the perpetrator will include three dummy\nvariables: stranger, intimate partner, and acquaintance. The reference category\nwill be other family. There will be a total of five crimes that will be examined in\nthis study: simple assault (0 = No, 1 = Yes), aggravated assault (0 = No, 1 = Yes),\nrobbery (0 = No, 1 = Yes), sexual assault (0 = No, 1 = Yes), and kidnapping (0 =\nNo, 1 = Yes). There is a total of four values that will be used to constitute the\nsexual assault variable.\n2There are many locations identified in NIBRS data. These locations include but are not limited to:\n1) home; 2) bank; 3) bar; 4) alley; 5) church; 6) prison; and 7) playground. In addition to transit ter-\nminals, I chose shopping centers, grocery stores, parking lot/garages, and universities as study va-\nriables because of the number of bus stops that are located at or near these locations. For example, it\nis not uncommon for local municipalities to have ordinances/laws that require private properties\ngive access to public transportation (see Center for Urban Transportation Research, (2009), Public\nTransit Access to Private Property, January 2009.).\nD. M. Savard\n8. Analytic Strategy\nLogistic regression will be the statistical technique utilized in this research\nproject. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) will be used for all\nanalyses. Logistic regression is the preferred statistical technique when depen-\ndent variables are categorical in nature. As was described above, the dependent\nvariable in this study is dichotomous. Because the dependent variable is com-\nprised of two categories, the quantitative data will be analyzed using logistic re-\ngression. When the dependent variable is dichotomous and not continuous in\nnature, the logistic regression model allows for estimations of the coefficient that\nmeasure the effect predictor variables have on an outcome variable (Bachman &\nPaternoster, 2009). Pearson's correlation coefficients were used a priori to ex-\namine potential issues of multicollinearity.\n9. Results\nTable 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the study variables. Interestingly,\nover half of the crime victims in the study were women. It might be expected\nthat men would have a higher percentage of criminal victimization in the dataset\nbased on ideas of victimization and who is more likely to be victimized, but the\nNIBRS reports that more women than men are victims of crime. However, it is\nimportant to point out that men are still more likely to suffer violent acts of\ncrime, such as robbery and aggravated assaults. A possible reason for this dis-\nparity in crime victimization rates is that the NIBRS is a different measure of\ncrime and reports more different types of crime when compared to the UCR, so\nthis might serve as an explanation as to why more women are victims of crime in\nthe NIBRS.\nThe variables measuring target suitability includes victim's age, the time of\nday in which the crime occurred, and if the offender was perceived to have been\nunder the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. A not insignificant number of\ncrimes were perpetrated against individuals in the different age categories. Spe-\nproximately 2.3% were 65+ years of age. With respect to the first two age catego-\nries, these results are not surprising findings because these age categories are\nmore likely to visit places outside of the home when compared to other age cat-\negories. Also, it may be that people in these age ranges are more likely to travel\noutside of the home. Criminals may view women as suitable targets not just be-\ncause they are alone when visiting places outside of the home, but because they\nare viewed as more vulnerable and therefore unable to thwart any predatory at-\ntacks, such as a sexual assault. 16.2% of the crime victimizations occurred from 7\nfrom 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., respectively.\nThe locations used in the present study to measure guardianship had a rela-\ntively low base rate. In other words, both women and men are more likely to be\nD. M. Savard\nTable 1.

Even with these low base rates, it is still important\nto examine victimization in these spaces because, as it will be demonstrated be-\nlow, when individuals are victimized in these locations, it is more likely to in-\nvolve women with respect to certain situational contexts. 3.8% of crime occurred\nat parking lot/garages, 0.57% of crimes occurred at shopping centers, 0.33% of\nD. M. Savard\ncrime occurred at grocery stores, 0.29% of crime occurred at transit terminals,\nand 0.32% of crime occurred at universities. The first crime type, simple assault,\nconsisted of about 60% of the total amount of crime. 12.4% of the sample in-\ncluded aggravated assaults, about 6% of the sample included sexual assaults,\nabout 3% of the sample included robberies, and kidnapping made up about 1%\nof the sample. When looking at victim's race, about 68% of the crime victims in\nthe study were white and about 30% of the sample consisted of black victims.\nRegarding the nature of the relationship between the victim and perpetrator,\nabout 36% of the samples were victimized by an intimate partner, about 22%\nwere victimized by an acquaintance, and about 9% were victimized by a stranger.\nThe results of the logistic regression analysis models predicting variation in\nthe likelihood that women will suffer victimization in public spaces is presented\nin Table 2. First, it was predicted that the indicators of target suitability (time of\nday and victim's age) would be significantly and positively associated with the\nlikelihood that women would be victimized. In other words, and according to\nRAT, it would be expected that women would be more likely to be victimized\nduring the morning, afternoon, and evening hours. Furthermore, it would be\nexpected that women in each respective age category would be more likely to be\nvictimized compared to the reference group. According to Model 1, women 18 -\n29 years old, 30 - 49 years old, and 65+ are significantly more likely to be victi-\nmized. When a crime occurs between 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. to 4 p.m.,\nwomen are significantly more likely to be the victim of a crime. The indicator\nused to measure offender motivation was if the offender was perceived to be\nunder the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. The results indicate that women are\napproximately 8% less likely to be victimized by an offender who was perceived\nto be under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. If women are less likely to be\nvictimized in public locations where the incident can potentially be observed by\ncapable guardians, motivated offenders may view women as suitable targets\nbased on perceptions of vulnerability and choose to commit their crimes while\nnot under the influence because they do not want their mental state to be inhi-\nbited. This is not to suggest that women are inherently more vulnerable to victi-\nmization compared to men; rather, motivated offenders may perceive them to be\nvulnerable. Location of the crime was the one indicator used to measure guar-\ndianship. Women are significantly more likely to be victimized at shopping cen-\nters and transit terminals. However, women are about 17% less likely to be vic-\ntimized in a parking lot/garage and are about 11% less likely to be victimized at a\nuniversity. No significant findings were discovered for grocery stores. Therefore,\nHypothesis 1 was partially supported.\nHypothesis 2 predicts that women will be more likely to suffer a simple assault\nin the study location variables. These hypotheses were tested using Model 2 of\nTable 2. According to Model 2, women were less likely to suffer a simple assault\nat grocery stores, parking lots/garages, and universities. No significant findings\nwere discovered for shopping centers and transit terminals. Therefore, Hypothe-\nsis 2 was not supported.\nD. M. Savard\nTable 2.

M. Savard\nContinued\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses; *p < 0.05.\nHypothesis 3 predicts females will be significantly more likely to suffer aggra-\nvated assault victimizations in each of the study location variables. It was found\nthat women were less likely to suffer aggravated assault victimizations at grocery\nstores and universities, and no significant findings were discovered for the re-\nmaining locations. Therefore, Hypothesis 3 was not supported.\nRegarding robbery victimizations, women were significantly more likely to be\nrobbed at shopping centers, grocery stores, parking lots/garages, and transit\nterminals. Therefore, Hypothesis 4 was mainly supported. With respect to the\ncrime of robbery, this finding supports the study's claim that transit environ-\nments and public spaces shape victimization differently for women and men in\nterms of vulnerability to victimization. Model 1 indicates that there is a strong\nnegative main effect for robbery victimization, but when robberies are examined\nin the context of shopping centers, grocery stores, parking lots/garages, and\ntransit terminals; we see that the gender gap in robbery victimization flips where\nwomen are more likely to be robbed.\nThe gender gap in crime explains that men and women experience criminal vic-\nD. M. Savard\ntimization differently. Crime statistics, particularly those from governmental\nsources, consistently show that men outnumber women as suffering violent acts\nof crime. The one exception to this is that women are much more likely to suffer\nrapes. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to suffer aggravated assaults,\nrobberies, and murder. Researchers have studied trends in the gender gap in\ncrime and observed that this crime gap is starting to close. However, the closing\nof this gap is the result of men's victimization rates dropping and women's vic-\ntimization rates remaining stable over time (Lauritsen & Heimer 2008). The\ncurrent study investigated this gap in the research by attempting to use the ideas\nof routine activity theory (RAT) to understand how men and women experience\nvictimization in different situational contexts.\nDrawing upon insights from Cohen and Felson (1979), criminal victimization\ncan be explained as occurring during individuals' routine activities as they got\nabout their day, and can further be shaped by the interrelatedness of certain\nspaces. The idea is that women will be more vulnerable in these spaces because\noffenders view them as suitable targets. It was found that the odds of women\nbeing victimized in some public spaces were greater than men. Individuals' rou-\ntine activities generally take place in the morning to late evening hours. The re-\nsults indicate that women were more likely to be victimized during times when\npeople are more active in public locations.\nFrom a practical standpoint, a related perspective associated with RAT is\nCrime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED). The tenets of\nCPTED can be implemented in an effort to prevent and deter crime from occur-\nring in the study's location variables. This perspective assumes that there is a\nsymbiotic relationship between the environment and human behavior, and ma-\nnipulating the environment will also alter human behavior (Newman, 1973). Bus\nstops situated in shopping centers, for example, invoke natural surveillance.\nNatural surveillance consists of designing the natural environment to allow\npeople to freely overlook a property and have clear sightlines to potentially ob-\nserve criminal activity. Bus stops located at or near shopping mall parking lots\nbring people together on a consistent basis at all hours of the day and night, and\nefficient designs of these locations can go a long way in helping prevent crimes.\nThis is particularly important when considering the study's findings on robbery\nvictimization in public spaces. Hypothesis 4 A-E predicted that women were\nmore likely to be robbed in each of the study's location variables. Model 1 of Ta-\nble 2 shows a strong negative effect for robbery victimizations, but when rob-\nbery is examined in transit environments, for example, women start becoming\nsignificantly more likely to be robbery victims.\nThe interactions of robbery victimization by location show that the difference\nin this type of crime is smaller in transit terminals, shopping malls, grocery\nstores, and parking lots/garages. The study predicted that women would have a\ngreater likelihood of suffering robbery victimization in transit environments and\nother public spaces. Notwithstanding universities, support for using routine ac-\nD. M. Savard\ntivity theory as a theoretical explanation of how women and men experience vic-\ntimization in transit environments and other public spaces is particularly ob-\nserved in robbery victimizations.\nOftentimes, large regional shopping centers have enormous parking lots to\naccommodate the thousands of people who patronize them every day, and con-\nsequently the design of these parking lots can create desolate environments.\nPublic transportation can have an iatrogenic effect in that travelers are brought\nto locations where they can potentially be victimized. Therefore, a woman tra-\nversing a shopping mall parking after being dropped off at a bus stop may be\nvictimized by a motivated offender operating with impunity because of a lack of\ncapable guardians. Conversely, it also may be that a motivated offender utilizing\npublic transportation victimizes a shopping mall patron in a parking lot. Indeed,\npublic transportation can influence both victim and offending rates within the\ncontext of public locations. Paying attention to lighting, implementing patrolling\nsecurity guards, and operating CCTV may help with altering human behavior\nand ultimately prevent crime (Savard & Kennedy, 2014). However, the effec-\ntiveness of lighting may only be good insofar as it prevents specific types of\ncrimes and not crimes in general (Farrington & Welsh, 2002), whereas the effi-\ncacy of patrolling security guards and CCTV regarding their deterrent value\nSpeaking from the RAT perspective, visiting public spaces occurs during the\nroutine, mundane activities that women and men engage in on an everyday ba-\nsis. The ideas of RAT were used to examine specific crime type victimizations in\npublic spaces. When the crime of robbery is examined, the results indicate that\nwomen have higher odds of robbery victimization in all but one of the public\nspaces. Women were less likely to suffer robbery victimizations in general, but\nwhen looking at the situational dynamics of the crime, women are more likely to\nbe robbed in shopping centers, grocery stores, parking lots/garages, and termin-\nals. Robbers can be rational thinkers when committing their crimes because\nprior research has found that they target victims who seem vulnerable and do\nnot pose any threats (Felson & Messner, 1996). The crime selection type of an\noffender can be critical in terms of preventing crime in public spaces. For exam-\nple, robbery is generally not a crime type selected at random by an offender. The\nrational robber will be careful to look for escape routes when evaluating the sui-\ntability of a target and guardians who can offer protection. If offenders are ra-\ntional beings and weigh the costs and benefits before they choose to commit a\nrobbery, security measures such as enhanced lighting and random security pa-\ntrols may act as a deterrent. A threefold method can be used by increasing the\nlevels of personnel on buses to deter a robbery, having alarms on buses to thwart\na robbery, and placing locating systems on buses to apprehend a robbery suspect\nImplementing security measures (e.g., security guards, upgraded lighting,\nCCTV) within transit environments may help alleviate any inherent risks of vic-\nD. M. Savard\ntimization, but some transit environments may be more receptive to security\nmeasures in terms of preventing crime. The ideas of prospect, refuge, and escape\nproposed by Fisher and Nasar (1992) can help explain why crime may be more\nlikely to occur in some transit environments compared to others. Prospect refers\nto being able to scan a space without obstruction, refuge refers to being able to\nidentify safe harbor, and escape refers to being able to exit a space. Indeed, these\nconcepts have practical implications for the security and safety of transit envi-\nronments and other public locations. For example, a motivated offender may be\nable to more effectively surveil a bus stop location, take refuge after committing\na crime, and ultimately flee the area more effectively compared to an under-\nground station. In other words, bus stops provide an environment conducive to\npredation based on the concepts above, whereas underground stations may limit\na motivated offender's choices in terms of identifying a suitable target because\nthis environment improves guardianship (Uittenbogaard, 2014). Security practi-\ntioners can take advantage of the symbiotic relationship that exists between hu-\nman behavior and the unique features of some transit environments where secu-\nrity measures may be more effective and guardianship improved (Savard &\nKennedy, 2013). However, risks associated with theft and terrorism (e.g., biolog-\nical and chemical agents) are always present in underground subway systems\nbecause of available targets and the construction of these spaces (Newton, et al.,\nIn addition to solving specific crime problems in the community through a\nproblem-oriented response (Goldstein, 1990), another tactic grounded within a\nlegal framework is being utilized by law enforcement as a third-party approach.\nThird party policing is a method where policing agencies and local governments\nwork together to encourage properties that have been deemed a nuisance within\nthe community to address issues of crime (Mazerolle & Ransley, 2006). For ex-\nample, law enforcement and local municipal governments can use nuisance ab-\natement laws to force unwillingly problematic properties to deal with issues of\ncrime on their property (O'Connor, 1977). In other words, civil remedies in the\nform of regulations and statutes can be used as a method of crime prevention\n(Mazerolle & Roehl, 1998). Indeed, businesses being threatened with daily fines\nmay be an effective way to motivate them to deal with issues on their properties.\nTherefore, the use of third party policing can be used for properties adjacent to\ntransportation hubs that are contributing to the overall crime rate in the area by\nholding \"place managers\" partially responsible for the criminogenic environ-\n1998; Sampson, et al., 2010). Another area in which third parties can be held ac-\ncountable for crime on their properties is the use of expert witnesses in civil\nlawsuits. \"Social science in law\" can be used as a \"social framework\" to explain\nthe potential culpability or innocence of a property owner for a criminal victi-\nmization that occurred on his or her property (Monahan & Walker, 1990;\nD. M. Savard\nThe data used in this study is not without its limitations because it provides li-\nmited coverage and consequently is not representative of all police departments\nacross the United States. For example, of the 33 states that reported crime data\nmitted their crime data using the NIBRS (FBI, 2014). Even though the NIBRS\nimproves upon the UCR by eliminating the Hierarchy Rule, problems associated\nwith unreported crime or the \"dark figure of crime\" remains an issue for the\nNIBRS. Indeed, crime is brought to the attention of the police in two ways, ei-\nther they observe it themselves or it is brought to their attention by the citizenry.\nConsequently, issues of validity and reliability can be a problem for crime data\nthat is relied on being reported by law enforcement agencies. Even with these\nlimitations, researchers are starting to utilize and analyze NIBRS data in their\nAnother limitation of the study is the NIBRS's inability to allow for the identi-\nfication of a bus stop, for example, at or near a shopping center. Consequently,\nthere is no way to determine if the risk of victimization for women is greater at a\nbus stop located near a shopping center compared to a stand-alone bus stop lo-\ncated on a city street. It could be that stand-alone bus stops are more dangerous\nfor riders based on their isolation from nearby businesses, such as shopping\ncenters and grocery stores. Future research should distinguish between transit\nenvironments located at or near businesses and those that are solitary in nature.\nNIBRS also does not consider the \"environmental backcloth\" of transit envi-\nronments (Brantingham & Brantingham, 1993). Therefore, future studies should\naccount for the differences between transit environments and public spaces\nbased on their location, history, users, and how security measures are perceived\n(Savard & Kennedy, 2014). Examining the unique environmental characteristics\nof transit environments may allow for a more detailed understanding of victi-\nmization risk.\nIt is generally accepted among criminological and victimological researchers that\nmen outnumber women as being victims of crime, particularly violent crime.\nResearchers have started to challenge this generalized thinking by examining the\ngender differentiated trends in victimization. The study argues that this line of\nthinking has the potential to allow for a better understanding of the situational\ndynamics of criminal victimization among the genders. Using the RAT perspec-\ntive provides a theoretical lens through which the gender gap in crime can be\nviewed in transit environments. This theory allows for examining how everyday\nactivities of people shape their victimization in transit environments and public\nspaces. Overall, the study's findings generally supported the perspective that the\ngender gap in crime is impacted by routine activities within transit environ-\nments and the propinquity of public spaces.\nD.
