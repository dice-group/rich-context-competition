The female,\ntherefore, is in the position to exercise choice and to select those males who will maximize\nher fitness. It is theorized, for instance, that females have evolved preferences for specific\nmale traits such as the ability to acquire resources that would be beneficial for them and\ntheir offspring (Buss, 2003; Symons, 1989). Because some of these traits are unobserved, it\nis also hypothesized that males have evolved adaptations to reliably signal these traits to\nThis line of reasoning relies on the assumption that males and females are free to\ninteract with one another when selecting mating partners. However, the ethnographic\nrecord points to a different conclusion. In pre-industrial societies, free mate choice was an\nexception to the general rule of mating being controlled by close kin, rather than the\nElements of Parental Choice\nWestermark, 1925; Whyte, 1978). It seems, therefore, that free female choice may not be\nthe appropriate model for studying the evolution of human mating behavior (Cronk, 1991).\nBy investing more in her offspring, the female becomes a valuable reproductive\nresource for males (Trivers, 1972). Parents can then manipulate this resource to maximize\ntheir inclusive fitness (Hamilton, 1964). As mating is a matter of arrangement between\nfamilies rather than between offspring, an effective manipulation of the female offspring\nalso demands a degree of manipulation of the male offspring. Additionally, because males\nalso provide parental investment, parents have an incentive to control their male offspring.\nFurthermore, the large amount and extensive time of parental investment, along with the\nfact that parents are physically stronger than their offspring, are some of the reasons why\nthe former can effectively control the mating of the latter (Alexander, 1974; Flinn and\nLow, 1986; Trivers, 1974). However, the offspring are not pawns in the hands of their\nparents, and they can evolve adaptations to psychologically manipulate their parents as\nwell (Trivers, 1974). But parents can also evolve adaptations to counterbalance such\nmanipulation (Stamps, Metcalf, and Krishnan, 1978). Consequently, the balance tilts in\nfavor of the parents who can still control parental investment and are still physically\nstronger (Dawkins, 1989). Nevertheless, parental choice has its limits and the offspring can\nstill exercise choice even under strong parental control. Such mating choice can be\nexercised mainly within the institution of marriage, where the offspring can divorce the\npartners that their parents have selected for them. Extramarital relations is another way by\nwhich offspring choice can be exercised (Apostolou, 2006).\nThis model of parental choice fits the mating patterns found among modern\nforagers. In a sample of 190 such societies, in only 4% of them were individuals free to\nselect their mate with little or no influence from their parents (Apostolou, 2006). Because\nmost of human evolution took place when all humans where living as hunters and\ngatherers, a period often called the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptness (EEA) (Lee\nand DeVore, 1968; Tooby and Cosmides, 1990), a systematic study of modern hunters and\ngatherers can provide ecologically valid information for life during that period (Ember,\n1978). Consequently, because parental control over female mating is typical of these\nsocieties, it was inferred that parental choice rather than female choice has been the\nprimary sexual selection mechanism in the humans (Apostolou, 2006).\nThe evidence from modern foragers places under question the research on human\nmating, which is based on the assumption of free female choice. But, a revision of previous\nresearch and the advancement of research require a more thorough understanding and\ndescription of the parental choice mechanism. Towards this objective, the present research\nexplores the preferences that parents have when they are selecting in-laws.\nThe evolution of parental preferences\nAn adaptive problem that parents have to solve is to select in-laws that will\nmaximize their inclusive fitness. Evolutionary pressures over in-law selection were\nsubstantial during human evolution, because the selection of an in-law could bring\ntremendous survival and reproduction advantages to the parents and their family. For\nexample, in most of the pre-industrial societies, for the marriage to proceed, the son-in-law\ngives to the bride's family a substantial amount of wealth (bridewealth) or works for the\nparents for one or two years (brideservice) (Murdock, 1967). Apart from these immediate\nElements of Parental Choice\nbenefits, the son-in-law has long-term obligations to provide food and support to his\nparents-in-law, sometimes for as long as they live (i.e. the Seri in Central America: Felger\nand Moser, 1985, p. 6). Additionally, a marriage is an alliance between families, and such\nalliances can bring substantial benefits to the parents and their family. Last but not least,\nthe selection of an in-law who has high genetic quality, for example resistance to parasites,\nor genes that make him or her attractive to the opposite sex, can bring genetic benefits to\nthe parents in terms of higher survival or reproductive success of their grandchildren.\nPotential in-laws vary in all these dimensions (some are hard working, some are\nnot; some have good genetic quality. some do not, etc.), so they will also differ in their\nvalue as in-laws to the parents. Parents are expected to have evolved preferences for\nselecting as in-laws those individuals with the most beneficial traits for them. For example,\nparents who have a preference for an in-law who is a good provider are more likely to\nchoose such an individual, and thus are more likely to acquire a valuable resource for\nthemselves and their kin. Because of the fitness gain that this preference has generated for\nthe parents and their kin, it increases in frequency in future generations. Eventually,\nparents who have such preferences replace those who do not. Thus, the first hypothesis to\nbe tested is that parents, when selecting in-laws, have stronger preferences for some traits\nand weaker preferences for others.\nThe second hypothesis to be tested is that parental preferences are contingent upon\nthe sex of the in-law. Because males and females have different specializations and roles,\nparents will value different properties in a son-in-law than in a daughter-in-law. For\nexample, in the majority of pre-industrial societies, females are responsible for\nhousekeeping; thus, qualities associated with maintaining a household will be more valued\nin a female than in a male. Furthermore, males and females differ in their post-marriage\nobligations towards their parents-in-law and this will affect the latter's preferences.\nBecause of the asymmetry in parental investment, parents, by controlling their female\noffspring, can extract resources from their son-in-law on a long-term basis. They cannot do\nthe same with their male offspring. It follows that parents will place more emphasis on the\nresource acquisition capacities of their son-in-law. Finally, males and females are\nbiologically different. A female's reproductive capacity is highly constrained by her age,\nbut this constraint is much more relaxed in males. Consequently, parents will look for\nyounger daughters-in-law than sons-in-law.\nParents are expected to differentiate their preferences according to the sex of their\nin-law, but their preferences may also be dependent upon their own sex. However, most of\nthe traits that an in-law may have are equally beneficial to both parents and their kin. It is\nhypothesized therefore that parents will not differ in their in-law preferences.\nIn summary, three main hypotheses are tested: first, parents prefer certain\ncharacteristics more than others in an in-law; second, parental preferences differ according\nto the sex of the in-law; and, finally, parents do not differ in their in-law preferences.\nMethods\nresidents, completed an online survey. A private company was employed specializing in\nrecruiting participants for online research in psychology. The participants were selected\nfrom a large database of people willing to participate in online psychological research and\nElements of Parental Choice\nhave registered through the company's web site. The survey was forwarded to those\nparticipants. All parents received payment for completing the survey in the form of credit\n(about US$5) that could be used to purchase goods from online stores. Most of the\nparticipants were married (63%), followed by single (16.8%), engaged (10.8%) and\ndivorced (9.4%). Data from parents with adopted children were included in the survey as\nlong as they also had at least one genetic child. The age of the children of the participants\nwas not recorded.\nThe survey was divided into two parts. In the first part of the survey, demographic\ndata were collected (Table 1) and then the following hypothetical scenario was given:\n\"You have two children, one male and one female, and you live in a society where\nmarriages are arranged. It is your duty as a parent, through negotiations with other parents,\nto find an appropriate spouse for both your daughter and your son.\" Then, the participants\nwere asked to rate a set of characteristics in a potential daughter-in-law and son-in-law. In\nthe second part of the survey, a similar scenario was presented, but the participants rated a\ndifferent set of characteristics. Additionally, the participants were asked the following set\nof questions: how many grandchildren you desire; how old you would prefer your daughter\nto get married; how old you would prefer your son to get married; would you prefer your\nson-in-law to be older, younger, same age, no preference, as your daughter; would you\nprefer your daughter-in-law to be older, younger, same age, no preference, as your son.\nTwo instruments were used to assess parental preferences. The first one was\ninitially developed by Hill (1945) and was later used by Buss et al. (1990) and by Buss,\nShackelford, Kirkpatrick, and Larsen (2001) to assess mate preferences. This instrument\nwas employed in the first part of the survey in which participants rated 18 characteristics\n(see Table 2). Because this instrument was developed to measure mate preferences rather\nthan in-law preferences, certain adjustments were made. Love and attraction develops\nthrough courtship, but courtship does not exist or it is limited in arranged marriages. Thus,\nin the scenario in which parents choose the marriage partners for their offspring, it is not a\nvalid option for them to choose in-laws on the basis of whether their offspring loves them.\nThe \"mutual attraction-love\" item used in previous surveys was dropped because it applies\nonly when individuals select their own partners. Additionally, the wealth item was added\nto test specific hypothesis. Each characteristic was rated in the following four-point Likert\nscale: 3 = indispensable, 2 = important, 1 = desirable, but not very important, and 0 =\nirrelevant or unimportant.\nThe second instrument was developed by Buss and Barnes (1986) and is based on a\nlarger instrument developed by Gough (1973) to study family planning. Additional items\nwere added to test specific hypotheses, and a \"compatibility\" item was dropped because it\nwas not directly applicable in the current research. The final instrument included 16 items\n(see Table 3). Each item was rated in the following six-point Likert scale: +2 = very\ndesirable; +1 = somewhat desirable; 0 = inconsequential, or neutral; -1 = somewhat\nundesirable; -2 = very undesirable.\nMissing values accounted for no more than 1.5% of the responses for any item. The\nmissing values were replaced by the mean or the mode (in frequency data) of the series.\nFinally, online responses have been found to be as reliable as laboratory-based responses\nElements of Parental Choice\nDemographic information for part one and part two of the survey\nMales Females Total\nPart One\nNumber of\nChildren\nMale\nChildrena\nFemale\nChildrenb\nPart Two\nNumber of\nchildren\nMale\nChildrena\nFemale\nChildrenb\nNote.

Although there was no\nspecific hypothesis about whether the sex of the offspring affects parents' ratings, this is a\npossibility. As such, it was tested with a series of ANOVAs and chi-squares, which\nindicated that the ratings that parents have given are not affected by the sex of the children\nthey have.\nTo assess whether parental preferences are contingent on the sex of the in-law, a\nseries of paired-sample t-tests was conducted on each item of the two instruments and on\nthe age items in part two of section two. To examine the importance that parents attach to\nthe specific items, these items were ranked according to their means. Bonferroni correction\nfor alpha inflation was applied by decreasing alpha from .05 to .003 (.05/18), two-tailed, in\npart one and from .05 to .003 (.05/16), two-tailed, in part two. Also in the sub-section of\npart two, alpha was reduced with the same method from .05 to .01 (.05/5), two-tailed.\nElements of Parental Choice\nMeans and ranks of preferences concerning potential in-laws for the first part of the\nsurvey\nSon-in-law Daughter-in-law\nRank Characteristics Mean SD Traits Mean SD\nDependable\ncharacter*\nDependable\ncharacter*\nDesire for home,\nchildren\nDesire for home,\nchildren\nAmbition,\nindustriousness*\nEducation,\nintelligence*\nGood cook,\nhousekeeper*\nEducation,\nintelligence*\nGood financial\nprospect*\nAmbition,\nindustriousness*\nGood cook,\nhousekeeper*\nSimilar education\nbackground\nSimilar education\nbackground\nFavorable social\nstatus\nGood financial\nprospect*\nFavorable social\nstatus\nSimilar religious\nbackground\nSimilar religious\nbackground\nSimilar political\nbackground\nSimilar political\nbackground\n* The rating of the trait differs significantly according to the sex of the in-law (p<.003).\nElements of Parental Choice\nParental preferences\nWhen selecting in-laws, parents prefer certain traits over others. For both in-laws,\nparents place keen emphasis on personality characteristics, such as dependable character\n(ranked 1st in Table 2), and kind and understanding (ranked 4th in Table 3). Similarly,\nstrong emphasis is placed on being employed, which ranks 3rd for the son-in-law and 5th\nfor the daughter-in-law (Table 3). Perception of compatibility of the in-laws with the\nparents also receives a high ranking (4th for the son-in-law and 3rd for the daughter-in-law\nin Table 3). Additionally, good health is strongly preferred in an in-law, ranking 3rd for\nboth in-laws in Table 2 and 2nd in Table 3, again for both in-laws.\nTraits associated with resource acquisition abilities, such as industry, intelligence,\nfinancial prospects, and good earning capacity rank near the middle of parental\npreferences. Physical attractiveness is among the least preferred characteristics in an in-law\n(ranks 16th for the male and 14th for the female in Table 2 and 12 for both in Table 3).\nSimilarity in education, religion, and political background are at the bottom of parental\npreferences (Table 2). Likewise, being religious, and creative and artistic are traits that are\nnot given much consideration by parents. Finally, being wealthy is ranked low in the\nhierarchy of parental preferences, 13th for the son-in-law and 16th for the daughter-in-law\n(Table 2).\nSex differences between in-laws\nParental preferences are contingent on the sex of the in-law (Table 4). More\nspecifically, parental preferences for resource acquisition traits are stronger for a son-in-\nlaw than a daughter-in-law. This is the case in part one of the survey, in which parents\nplace more emphasis on such traits of the son-in-law, like ambition and industry [t(296) =\n(two-tailed), p\np\n2=.283)]. This is corroborated in part two, in which significant differences were found in\n(two-tailed), p\n2=.141)]. Consequently, in most of the traits correlated with resource\nacquisition capacity, the son-in-law receives a significantly higher rating than the daughter-\nin-law. Also, it seems that it is the potential to acquire resources rather than the resources\nper se that matters for the parents.

There was not a single case of parents preferring a son-in-law who is younger\nthan their daughter. On the other hand, when selecting a daughter-in-law, 15.8% of the\nparents indicated a preference for a younger female than their son, 29.2% for one of the\nsame age, 54.6% indicated no preference, and there was just one case in which an older\ndaughter-in-law was preferred.

In section two of part two, an independent samples t-test was\nconducted on the number of grandchildren desired. Also, a 2x2 mixed design ANOVA was\nconducted, with the preferred age of the offspring as the within-subjects factor and the sex\nof the parent as the between-subjects factor. Finally, a chi-square analysis was conducted\nto investigate the association between the sex of the parent and the age of son-in-law and\nthe sex of the parent and the age of daughter-in-law, respectively. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov\ntest was conducted on the difference in the ratings of the two in-laws and the sex of the\nparent. As before, Bonferroni correction for alpha inflation was applied.\nIn all the tests that were conducted, the sex of the parent did not achieve statistical\nsignificance, with the only exception of the good looks item in part one of the survey, in\nwhich there was a significant interaction between the sex of the in-law and the sex of the\n2=.035)]. Nevertheless, this was not corroborated in\npart two, in which no such interaction was found for the physically attractive item. It can\nbe concluded that male and female parents do not differ in their in-law preferences.\nDiscussion\nIn summary, parents have stronger preferences for certain characteristics in an in-\nlaw and these preferences are contingent upon the sex of the in-law. Also, male and female\nparents are in agreement on what they are looking for in an in-law.\nA possible criticism is that preferences measured here may simply reflect\nindividual mating preferences rather than parental in-law preferences. Similarly, of course,\nit can be argued that given the indication of strong parental control over mating in our\nElements of Parental Choice\nevolutionary past, there was no pressure for mate preferences to evolve. So what was\nmeasured in previous studies on individual mate preferences was in-law preferences. From\nthe present data, it is evident that in-law and individual mate preferences are distinct. More\nspecifically, it is known from previous research that males and females differ significantly\nin their mate preferences (Buss, 2003). For example, females value earning capacity in a\nmating partner more than males. If in-law preferences were simply individual mating\npreferences, we would expect that male parents would rate earning capacity in a daughter-\nin-law less than female parents would in a son-in-law. In other words, we would expect\nsignificant interactions to exist between the sex of the parent and the sex of the in-law in at\nleast six items (physical attractive, college/university graduate, good earning capacity,\ngood looks, good financial prospects, ambition and industriousness), and up to 11 items, as\nWith the exception of good looks in the first instrument, such significant interactions were\nnot found. It has to be then that the in-law preferences measured here are not simply\nindividual mate preferences.\nThe results presented here are consistent with an evolutionary framework, but\nalternative explanations based, for example, on social learning, cannot be excluded at this\nstage, at least not before cross-cultural research has been conducted. More specifically, as\nthis study is confined to only one culture, the specific cultural contributions in parental\npreferences cannot be controlled. Nevertheless, parental preferences have mainly been\noptimized by natural selection during the EEA and as such are likely be roughly consistent\nacross cultures. This prediction awaits further research, but current evidence is consistent\nwith this prediction. Specifically, parental in-law preferences in the UK are similar to those\namong modern hunter and gatherer societies. In hunter and gatherer societies, parents have\nspecific preferences when they are selecting in-laws. Resource acquisition properties are\nimportant for both in-laws, but more emphasis is placed on those of the son-in-law. When\nparents are selecting a son-in-law, they are looking for a good hunter who is industrious\nand has a good family background. When they are selecting a daughter-in-law, parents are\nlooking for an industrious individual from a good family. Parents prefer younger\ndaughters-in-law and older sons-in-law. Physical attractiveness is less important as a\nselection criterion for the parents. Finally, although male parents are reported to have more\ndecision making power than their wives, when it comes to marriage arrangements, both are\nin agreement on their selection criteria (Apostolou, 2006).\nParents may control whom their offspring will marry, but their offspring often have\ncontrol over how long the marriage will last. Among hunters and gatherers, divorce, which\napplies to both males and females, is almost as universal as marriage (Apostolou, 2006).\nBetzig (1989) found that, across cultures, the third most frequent cause of divorce is\ncruelty and maltreatment, and bad temper is also frequently reported as a reason for\ndivorce. There is no point to arrange a marriage that will be dissolved soon after it takes\nplace. Thus, parents should prefer in-laws with personality characteristics that will increase\nthe probability of a successful and lasting marriage. A marriage with a kind and\nunderstanding individual, who is emotionally stable and has a dependable character, will\nbe more successful than a marriage with an individual who does not share these\ncharacteristics. Furthermore, love and attraction between partners is likely to decrease the\nprobability of divorce. But parents cannot select an in-law based on such properties. What\nthey can do instead is to select someone with such traits that will make feelings of love and\nElements of Parental Choice\nattraction more likely to develop between their offspring and the in-law. This is another\npossible reason why traits like kind and understanding, dependable character and\nemotionally stable are strongly preferred by parents in an in-law.\nAlthough food is surprisingly abundant in many foraging societies (i.e. the !Kung:\nLee, 1979), its supply is not as predictable as in non-foraging societies and hunters and\ngatherers often live in feast-or-famine conditions (i.e. the Cheyennes: Hoebel, 1960, p.67).\nAlthough ancestral hunters and gatherers may have lived in more food rich areas (Shostak,\n1990), archaeological evidence indicates that they also faced frequent periods of food\nshortage (Yesner, 1994). An in-law that is good at providing food to his family and his in-\nlaws is a valuable resource for the parents. Also, because personality characteristics, such\nas dependable character, are good indicators that resources will be provided consistently\nover time (Buss, 2003, p. 32), this may be another reason why such traits are strongly\npreferred by parents.\nMoreover, parents may have an interest in forming an alliance between their family\nand a genetically unrelated family if such an alliance can be beneficial to them and their\nkin (Trivers, 1974). Marriage is an alliance between families. By selecting an in-law who\ncomes from a good family background, parents will form new alliances or strengthen\nexisting alliances between their kin and this family, which can provide a valuable source of\nsupport. Furthermore, the families of the in-laws will provide their offspring with support\nand resources, which in turn they could divert to their parents-in-law.\nThe health of a potential in-law is also a concern to parents, because it correlates\nwith a number of important variables such as hunting or gathering productivity. An\nunhealthy individual is unlikely to be productive in subsistence activities which are\nphysically demanding. Additionally, health correlates with life expectancy. It would not\ngenerally make sense for the parents to arrange a marriage with somebody who is likely to\ndie soon. Finally, good health correlates with the fecundity of the in-law, which is also of\nsubstantial interest to the parents.\nParents desire grandchildren because grandchildren will transfer their genetic\nmaterial to the future generations. When they were explicitly asked how many\ngrandchildren they desire, they responded an average of 3.91 (SD = 2.12). It follows that\nparents place emphasis on acquiring in-laws that are able and willing to have children.\nMoreover, age is an important factor that will affect fertility, especially in females who\nhave a shorter reproductive period than males. Among 10 hunting and gathering societies,\nthe average age of women at last birth was approximately 35 years (Kelly, 1995). Thus,\nparents look for daughters-in-law who are younger than their sons, because the latter have\nmore reproductive years ahead of them.\nOther traits, like chastity, beauty, and good heredity, may contribute less to the\nparents' inclusive fitness and that may be why they are less strongly preferred by them.\nBeauty, for example, although an indicator of genetic quality (Thornhill and Gangestad,\n1993), does not rank high in parental preferences. If parents choose a physically attractive\nson-in-law, this will benefit approximately 25% of their genes that they share with their\ndaughter. But, if they choose a son-in-law with high resource acquisition capacity, they can\nuse the resources he provides to benefit a much larger number of their genes which they\nshare with their kin, including their daughter. Ideally, then, parents might prefer an able\nand hard working man who is also physically attractive. But if they had to compromise\nbetween these two traits, they would compromise on beauty. For such a compromise to\nElements of Parental Choice\ntake place, they should evolve weaker preferences for beauty than resource acquisition\ncapacity in an in-law.\nThis argument also suggests that beauty can be an area of conflict between parents\nand offspring. The offspring will share with its partner 50% of its genes, which are only\n25% of the genes of its parents; consequently, the offspring might value beauty in a partner\nmore than its parents. Consistent with this, comparing the results from part one of this\nstudy with the Buss et al. (1990) study on mate preferences (to make the rankings\ncomparable, the wealth item was dropped from this study and the mutual attraction love\nitem was dropped from Buss et al. study, and the items were re-ranked), we find that males\nas well as females rank good looks higher (9th and 12th, respectively) than their parents\nTo conclude, despite the bulk of anthropological data indicating that parents\ndominate the mating choices of their offspring, the evolution of parental behavior with\nrelation to the manipulation of the mating of the offspring has received little empirical\nattention from evolutionary theorists. A possible reason for this is that most of the research\non mating is conducted in the western world, where parents may have a lesser role in the\nmating decisions of their offspring. The current model of parental choice may provide a\nuseful framework for understanding the evolution of human mating psychology and\nbehavior. Parental preferences are an important component of this selection mechanism\nand this research is one of the first attempts to empirically investigate these preferences.\n"
