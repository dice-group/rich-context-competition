Erlinger, MD, MPH\nBackground--Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is an important\nmarker of subclinical coronary heart disease. However, estimates of PAD prevalence in the general US population have\nvaried widely.\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index 0.90 in either leg. The\nprevalence of PAD among adults aged 40 years and over in the United States was 4.3% (95% CI 3.1% to 5.5%), which\ncorresponds to 5 million individuals (95% CI 4 to 7 million). Among those aged 70 years or over, the prevalence was\n14.5% (95% CI 10.8% to 18.2%). In age- and gender-adjusted logistic regression analyses, black race/ethnicity (OR\nPAD had 1 or more cardiovascular disease risk factors. Elevated fibrinogen and C-reactive protein levels were also\nassociated with PAD.\nConclusions--This study provides nationally representative prevalence estimates of PAD in the United States, revealing\nthat PAD affects more than 5 million adults. PAD prevalence increases dramatically with age and disproportionately\naffects blacks. The vast majority of individuals with PAD have 1 or more cardiovascular disease risk factors that should\nKey Words: peripheral arterial disease  epidemiology  risk factors\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) commonly results from\nprogressive narrowing of arteries in the lower extremi-\nties, due to atherosclerosis. Previous studies have shown that\nPAD is associated with a significantly elevated risk of\ncardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.1\u00ad3 However,\nestimates of PAD prevalence in the general US population\nhave varied widely.

Systolic blood pressure was measured on the right arm\n(brachial artery) and both ankles (posterior tibial arteries). If the\nparticipant had a condition associated with the right arm that would\ninterfere with measurement, the left arm was used for brachial\npressure measurement. Systolic blood pressure was measured twice\nat each site for participants aged 40 to 59 years and once at each site\nfor participants aged 60 years. Left and right ABI measurements\nwere obtained by dividing mean systolic blood pressure in the right\nand left ankle by mean blood pressure in the arm. PAD was defined\nOther Variables of Interest\nHypertension was defined as mean systolic blood pressure of\n140 mm Hg or greater, mean diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg\nor greater, physician diagnosis, or medication use. Mean blood\npressure was composed of up to 4 readings on 2 separate occasions.\nTotal cholesterol was measured enzymatically.20 Hypercholesterol-\nemia was defined as a total cholesterol level 240 mg/dL or higher,\nphysician diagnosis, or medication use. Diabetes was defined as\nself-reported physician diagnosis, use of diabetes medication, fasting\nPersons reporting \"borderline diabetes\" or solely reporting a diabetes\ndiagnosis during pregnancy were considered nondiabetic.\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function,\nwas estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)\nStudy formula21 based on serum creatinine, age, gender, and race. To\nappropriately estimate GFR, serum creatinine was calibrated to\naccount for laboratory differences between NHANES III and\nences would lead to an overestimate of the prevalence of PAD\namong persons with low GFR. Kidney function was categorized on\nthe basis of the classification system established by the National\nKidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative.21\nNormal kidney function was defined as a GFR 90 mL \u00b7 min1 \u00b7\nmildly decreased kidney function, and a GFR 60 mL \u00b7 min1 \u00b7 1.73\nm2 was considered low kidney function. There were too few\nindividuals in the severely decreased GFR group (GFR 30 mL \u00b7\nmin1 \u00b7 1.73 m2) to include these persons in a separate category.\nFibrinogen was measured quantitatively by the Clauss clotting\nmethod.20 High-sensitivity CRP was measured with a Behring\nNephelometer II Analyzer.20 In analyses, both fibrinogen and CRP\nwere categorized into quartiles. Body mass index (BMI) was\nestimated by dividing kilograms of weight by height in meters\nsquared and was categorized according to the classification system\nInformation on age, gender, race/ethnicity, and smoking was\nbased on self-report during the questionnaire portion of the survey.\nSmoking status was determined using answers to the questions,\n\"Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life?\" and \"Do you\nnow smoke cigarettes?\" During the interview, participants were also\nasked questions about their history of cardiovascular disease. For the\npurposes of the present study, prevalent coronary heart disease was\ndefined as self-reported coronary heart disease or previous heart\nattack. Congestive heart failure and stroke were also defined on the\nbasis of self-report.\nDetailed information about data collection in NHANES 1999\u00ad\nStatistical Analysis\nThe NHANES surveys are ongoing complex, multistage probability\nsamples of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United\nlow-income persons, adolescents, Mexican Americans, and non-\nHispanic blacks to provide more reliable estimates for these popu-\nlation subgroups.\nAnalyses were performed with SAS version 8.0 (SAS Institute\nInc) and SUDAAN software (Research Triangle Institute) to obtain\nunbiased estimates from the complex NHANES sampling design.\nStandard errors for all estimates were obtained by the jackknife\n\"leave-one-out\" method.

If risk factors\nremain stable, we expect an estimated 7 million individuals\naccording to census population projections.24\nPrevious prevalence estimates for PAD have largely de-\nrived from studies of subjects from clinical settings, which\nwould be expected to overestimate the burden of disease in\nthe general population.

The prevalence estimates and risk factor\nassociations in the present study are consistent with those\nobserved among middle-aged adults in US community-based\nstudies, such as the Framingham Offspring Study7 and the\nAtherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study,8 and among\nelderly individuals in the Honolulu Heart Program26 and the\nCardiovascular Health Study.2 The prevalence of PAD in\nthese other studies, which used similar diagnostic criteria,\nranged from 3% to 4% among middle-aged adults and\nThe results of the present study show that PAD dispropor-\ntionately affects older individuals and non-Hispanic blacks.\nThe excess PAD prevalence among blacks was not explained\nby known risk factors for PAD. This is consistent with\nprevious studies that have shown a higher prevalence of PAD\nin non-Hispanic blacks.27 We also demonstrate that there is a\nparticularly high prevalence of PAD among current smokers,\ndiabetics, and persons with low kidney function.\nPAD is also highly associated with traditional cardiovas-\ncular disease risk factors such as current smoking, diabetes,\nhypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, with 95% of persons\nwith prevalent PAD having at least 1 of these risk factors.\nNontraditional risk factors were also associated with preva-\nlent PAD. Both fibrinogen and CRP were positively associ-\nated with prevalent PAD after adjustment for potential\nconfounders. Although these findings might suggest a causal\nrole for inflammation in the pathogenesis of PAD, they may\nalso reflect a high burden of atherosclerosis in individuals\nwith PAD.\nThe rigorous methodology used in NHANES provides\nnationally representative estimates of the prevalence of PAD\nfirst NHANES survey to perform ankle-brachial blood pres-\nsure measurements on participants and hence allows for\ndirect comparison with prior prevalence studies in adult\nTABLE 2.

Despite these strengths, several limitations de-\nserve consideration. It is possible that the prevalence of PAD\nin the present study underestimates the true prevalence in the\npopulation. The use of a different cutpoint for ABI and/or the\ninclusion of measurements from the anterior tibial arteries\nmight have resulted in a greater sensitivity. However, the\nmagnitude of this problem is likely to be small because the\nsensitivity of our definition has been shown to be 90% in\nother studies.17\u00ad19 Additionally, the cross-sectional nature of\nNHANES limits conclusions about direction or causality\nof associations observed in the present study. The use of\nself-reported data for some risk factors could underestimate\nprevalence, especially for health conditions such as coronary\nheart disease. Furthermore, this study may be subject to\n\"survival bias,\" in that individuals with chronic disease or\nsevere risk factors may be less likely to participate in\nNHANES. However, this form of selection bias is likely to\nunderestimate observed associations between risk factors and\nTABLE 3.

In addition, there is a high prevalence of traditional\nand nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors among persons\nwith PAD. More than 95% of individuals with PAD have at\nleast 1 traditional cardiovascular risk factor, and the majority\nhave multiple risk factors. These findings highlight the\nimportance of aggressive risk factor management in persons\nwith PAD and in those at increased risk for PAD.\n"
