Rubenstein1\n'Department of Preventive Medicine and Environmental Health and 2The University of Iowa Cancer Center,\n \nBackground. Accumulating evidence suggests that physical activity may protect against the development of breast\ncancer, but less is known about the role of modest physical activity during the postmenopausal years and in the context\nof physical function.\nMethods. We evaluated this association in the Iowa 65+ Rural Health Study, a population-based, prospective cohort\nstudy of elderly adults. The cohort was linked to a population-based cancer registry for the years 1973--93, and the at-\nwere 46 incident cases of breast cancer.\nResults. Greater level of physical activity in women with no physical disabilities was inversely associated with\nbreast cancer risk {p for trend = .01). Compared to inactive women with no physical disability, women reporting mod-\nerate (age-adjusted relative risk [RR] = 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3-1.1) or high (age-adjusted RR = 0.2,\n95% CI .05-0.9) activity levels were at decreased risk of breast cancer. Women with any disability were also at\ndecreased risk of breast cancer compared to inactive women with no disability (age-adjusted RR = 0.4; 95% CI\n0.2-0.9). Adjustment for education, body mass index, age at menarche, age at menopause, previous use of hormone\nreplacement therapy, pregnancy history, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and alcohol use did not alter these associa-\ntions. In addition, these associations were similar after exclusion of cases occurring during the first two years of fol-\nlow-up, after adjusting for the number of doctor visits, and after stratifying by stage at diagnosis.\nConclusions. These data suggest that postmenopausal activity level, after accounting for physical disability, is\ninversely associated with breast cancer risk.\nTHE American Cancer Society estimated that more than\nin women age 65 years and older (2). The incidence rate for\nwomen under the age of 65, and the peak incidence rate of\n75-79 years (2). There is accumulating epidemiologic data\nthat physical activity may be inversely associated with\nbreast cancer incidence (3-10) and mortality (11), with only\none study each showing either a positive (12) or null (13)\nassociation. However, only five of these studies were able\nto adjust adequately for the potential confounding effects of\nstudies have assessed physical activity either by participa-\ntion in athletics in adolescence/early adulthood (3,10,13) or\nby job activity during adulthood (5-7,11). Only three stud-\nies have evaluated the role of physical activity in the post-\nmenopausal years (4,9,12), and none has evaluated physical\nactivity in elderly women in the context of physical func-\ntion, ignoring the fact that a large percentage of women\nover age 65 may not be physically capable of engaging in\nphysical activity (14). We therefore evaluated the associa-\ntion between postmenopausal physical activity in the con-\ntext of physical function and subsequent breast cancer risk\nin a population-based cohort of elderly women.\nMETHODS\ninstitutionalized residents aged 65 years and older of Iowa\nand Washington Counties, Iowa, were enrolled in the Iowa\nfour sites for the Established Populations for Epidemio-\nlogic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) (15). These two coun-\nties are primarily rural with several small towns of popula-\ncohort, only the 1,942 women completing the full-form\nbaseline interview were eligible for inclusion in this report.\nThe full-form baseline interview, conducted in the respon-\ndent's home by a trained interviewer, included questions on\na variety of demographic, health, and social characteristics,\nas previously described (15).\nData collection.--Demographic characteristics included\nage, number of years of education, and marital status. Par-\nticipants were asked about their menstrual history (age of\nfirst menstruation, age at menopause, and type of meno-\npause), pregnancy history (ever pregnant, age at first preg-\nnancy, and number of pregnancies), and prior use of hor-\nmone replacement therapy. Height and weight at baseline\nwere self-reported, and body mass index (BMI) was calcu-\nlated as weight (in kilograms [kg]) divided by height2 (in\nmeters [m]).\nThe physical activity measure integrated physical func-\ntion and physical activity in order to assess physical activity\nin the physically capable (see Table 1). Physical function\nwas assessed by self-report of ability to do heavy work\naround the house, walk up and down a flight of stairs, or\nwalk a half mile without help; it was based on the Rosow-\nBreslau Functional Health Scale (16). A woman was classi-\nfied as disabled if she could not perform any one of the three\nactivities. Physical activity in physically capable women\n(i.e., not disabled) was classified as inactive, moderately\nactive, or highly active, as previously reported (17). This\nscale was based on the following five questions: \"How often\ndo you: garden or do yardwork in season? do housework?\ntake walks? jog, bike ride, swim, or do other vigorous exer-\ncise? play horseshoes/golf or play other moderate exercise\ngames in season?\" Possible responses to each question\nincluded: do not do, everyday, several times a week, once a\nweek, several times a month, and once a month or less.\nAlthough we did not have information on activities not\nrelated to recreation or home maintenance, only 3% of the\nwomen were employed full-time at baseline interview.\nCohort follow-up.--Cohort members were contacted\nannually either by telephone interviewers (follow-ups at 1,\n2, 4, 5, and 7 years) or by in-person interviewers (follow-\nups at 3, 6, and 10 years) to update residence and vital sta-\ntus. Vital status was also followed passively through moni-\nTable 1. Criteria Used to Determine Physical Impairment and\nCriteria*\n1.

The reg-\nistry collects data including personal identifying informa-\ntion, tumor site, morphology, and extent of disease on all\npersons who were Iowa residents at the time of their diag-\nnosis. Topographic and morphologic data were coded using\nthe International Classification of Diseases for Oncology\n(ICD-O), 2nd edition (18). Linkage was conducted for the\nof social security number, first, last, and maiden names,\ndate of birth, city and zip code.\nStatistical analysis.--Of the 1,942 women who com-\npleted a full-form baseline interview, we excluded from\nanalysis women with any cancer detected in the cancer reg-\nadditionally self-reported a breast cancer at any time prior\nto baseline (n = 9). This approach is likely to have excluded\nthe vast majority of prevalent cancers (diagnosed after\ntheir baseline community 10 years or longer. This approach\nalso decreased the reliance on lifetime self-report of cancer,\nwhich is known to be of questionable validity in this\ncohort. In addition, we excluded women who had no data\non physical function and physical activity (n = 19).\nBecause we could only ascertain cancers occurring in\nIowa residents, each woman was allocated person-years of\nfollow-up from the date of her baseline survey to the date\ndate of emigration from Iowa, or date of death. If none of\nbecause of a move out of Iowa, and 39.6% were censored\nbecause of death. Incidence rates were calculated by divid-\ning the number of events by the numbers of person-years of\nfollow-up for each category of physical activity. Relative\nrisks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were\nused as the measure of association, and were estimated\nusing Poisson regression (19).\nRESULTS\n(range 65-102) who had no cancer in the cancer registry\nbetween 1973 and their baseline interview, had no self-\nreport of a previous breast cancer, and had provided data on\nphysical activity and physical function. During 16,857 per-\nof histologically confirmed breast cancer. The mean age at\nyears). Seventy-four percent of the cases had breast cancer\nthat was localized at diagnosis, and 26% had regional or\ndisseminated disease.\nApproximately 39% of the cohort reported one or more\nphysical disabilities at baseline (Table 1). The remaining\nwomen (i.e., with no physical disability) were categorized\ninactive (20.8%). The most common activity among active\nwomen was walking, and the range of this activity was\nthought to be very broad. Therefore, the active group was\ndivided into high versus moderate activity based on partici-\npation in vigorous sport or exercise to discriminate average\nactivity levels better (17). Of the women categorized as\nhighly active, 75% also reported walking at least weekly.\nBreast cancer cases, compared to noncases, had a higher\nmean weight, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure,\nbut were similar with respect to age, height, diastolic blood\npressure, and menstrual and reproductive history (Table 2).\nThere were no differences between cases and noncases with\nrespect to marital status, education, use of cigarettes or\nalcohol, and number of doctor visits in the last year. In con-\ntrast, cases were more likely to have ever used hormone\nreplacement therapy and were less likely to engage in phys-\nical activity or be physically disabled.\nTable 3 shows the distribution of selected breast cancer\nTable 2.

Compared to inac-\ntive women, women with a high level of physical activity\nwere on average 2.7 years younger, more highly educated,\nmore likely to be married, more likely to drink alcohol or to\nhave used hormone replacement therapy, and more likely to\nhave slightly lower systolic blood pressure. Women with a\nmoderate level of physical activity were similar in age, use\nof hormone replacement therapy, and systolic blood pres-\nsure compared to inactive women, but were less likely to\nbe married; level of education and use of alcohol were\nintermediate between inactive and highly active women.\nWomen with any disability were in general older, least\nlikely to be married, had the highest systolic blood pres-\nsure, and were more likely to have visited their doctor in\nthe past year. Across all groups, there was little difference\nin smoking status, height, weight, body mass index, dia-\nstolic blood pressure, mean age at menstruation, first preg-\nnancy or menopause, and mean number of pregnancies.\nWe found an inverse association between level of physi-\ncal activity in physically capable women and risk of breast\ncancer (Table 4). Compared to inactive women, women\nwho engaged in moderate (age-adjusted RR = 0.5) or high\n(age-adjusted RR = 0.2) levels of physical activity were at a\ndecreased risk of breast cancer (p for trend = .01). In addi-\ntion, women with any disability were at decreased risk of\nbreast cancer compared to inactive women with no disabil-\ncancer risk factors in this data set, including education,\nbody mass index, age at menstruation, age at menopause,\nuse of hormone replacement therapy, and systolic blood\npressure did not alter these associations (Table 4, Model II).\nFurther adjustment for other potential breast cancer risk\nfactors, including smoking, alcohol use, age at first preg-\nnancy, or number of pregnancies, also did not alter these\nassociations (data not shown).\nTo evaluate the possibility that subclinical breast cancer\nmight cause a decrease in physical activity, we excluded\nbreast cancer cases diagnosed during the first two years of\nfollow-up (n = 7); this had little effect on the relative risk\nestimates (Table 4, Model III). Another concern was whether\na detection bias might explain these data; that is, women in a\ncertain activity level may have been more likely to have\ntheir breast cancer detected earlier due to closer medical\nsurveillance. However, further adjustment of the full model\nfor number of doctor visits in the last year did not materially\naffect the associations (Table 4, Model IV). In addition, we\nstratified the outcome into localized versus regional or dis-\nseminated breast cancer at diagnosis, and refit separate mod-\nels (Table 4, Models V and VI, respectively). Because there\nwere only 12 cases with regional or disseminated disease at\ndiagnosis, study power was limited; nevertheless, the results\nsuggest an inverse association with physical activity regard-\nless of stage at diagnosis.\nDISCUSSION\nWe observed an inverse dose-response relation between\nincreasing levels of postmenopausal physical activity in\nphysically capable women and subsequent breast cancer\nrisk, which was not altered after multivariate adjustment for\nmajor breast cancer risk factors.

There was lit-\ntle evidence that these results were strongly influenced by\nsubclinical disease or a detection bias. To our knowledge,\nthe postmenopausal physical activity and breast cancer\nassociation has not been evaluated in the context of physi-\ncal function. While physical disability is not a major issue\nin younger or middle-aged populations, it is clearly an\nimportant consideration for elderly women in whom the\nprevalence is high (14).\nOur findings are consistent with the accumulating epi-\ndemiologic data that physical activity may be inversely\nassociated with breast cancer incidence (3-10). However,\nphysical activity in the postmenopausal years has been eval-\nuated in only three studies (4,9,12). Albanes and colleagues\n(4) reported an association between breast cancer risk and\nnonrecreational activity (RR =1.5 for least active vs quite\nin postmenopausal women. Friedenreich and Rohan (9)\nreported an inverse association between total weekly physi-\ncal activity and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal\nusing the Framingham study, found a positive association\nbetween level of total physical activity at the 1954 biennial\nexam (median age 50 years) and breast cancer risk (91%\ntile vs lowest quartile of physical activity; 95% CI 0.9-2.9).\nThe exact mechanism by which physical activity might\ninfluence breast cancer risk is not known, but the most com-\nmonly hypothesized mechanisms have focused on the modu-\nlation of endogenous sex steroid hormones by physical activ-\nity either through direct effects on the menstrual cycle (e.g.,\nage at menarche, anovulation, or age at menopause) or\nthrough effects on body weight (20). However, neither of\nthese mechanisms is particularly satisfying in explaining our\ndata. Physical activity levels in this cohort were overall very\nmoderate and are unlikely to be a significant determinant of\nbody weight for the majority of women. Physical activity can\nobviously no longer directly influence the menstrual cycle in\npostmenopausal women, although it could impact steroid hor-\nmone levels through other mechanisms. Higher levels of post-\nmenopausal physical activity could reflect higher activity lev-\nels in adolescence or adulthood, and therefore might represent\nthe continued long-term protection due to hormonal modula-\nTable 4.

Unfortunately we do not have\nany data to directly test this hypothesis in our cohort. How-\never, Dorgan et al. (12) observed in the Framingham cohort a\ncorrelation between physical activity level at examination 4\nsuggesting considerable shift in activity levels over time.\nAn alternative, and less explored, mechanism may be the\nmodulation of insulin sensitivity by physical activity. There\nis increasing evidence that insulin may play a role in the eti-\nology of breast cancer (21), in part because insulin is an\nimportant growth factor for human breast cancer cells cul-\ntured in vitro and it influences breast cancer cell cycle\nkinetics. Insulin can also cross-react with the IGF-I receptor\nas well as increase the bioavailability of IGF-I, and IGF-I\nitself has been implicated in breast cancer (21). Levels of\nserum C-peptide (a surrogate measure of insulin level) have\nbeen reported to be significantly higher in breast cancer\ncases compared to controls (22). Small variations in physi-\ncal activity in untrained individuals appear to affect marked\nchanges in the metabolic activity of skeletal muscle (23).\nExercise training programs are associated with improved\ninsulin action (and lower insulin levels) in trained athletes\n(23). This association extends to much more modest physi-\ncal activity in untrained individuals and appears to be inde-\npendent of age and level of obesity (24-25), although there\nare fewer data for women and the associations are often less\nstriking than those reported for men. This hypothesis is\nappealing because it provides a physiologic basis that could\naccount for a protective effect of modest postmenopausal\nphysical activity against breast cancer.\nIt is not clear why women with any physical disability on\nthe Rosow-Breslau Functional Health Scale would be at\ndecreased risk of breast cancer, and this finding needs to be\nreplicated before drawing any conclusions. Women in this\ngroup are known to be diverse in terms of the causes of their\nphysical disability, length of their disability, and the pres-\nence of comorbidity, and many are likely to be no longer\ndisabled within a relatively short period of time (14). Recent\ndata suggest that women with a history of wrist (26) or hip\nfracture (27) or lower bone mass (28,29) have a reduced risk\nof breast cancer. While osteoporosis and fracture are rela-\ntively common causes of disability in elderly women, we\ndid not have data on the cause or length of the disability, and\nthus cannot assess the direct relevance to our finding.\nThese data are obviously limited by the small number of\nincident breast cancers and the lack of data on physical activ-\nity during adolescence or adulthood, family history of breast\ncancer, body fat distribution, and diet. While we attempted to\ncontrol for medical surveillance for breast cancer by adjust-\ning for the number of doctor visits in the last year, this does\nnot directly address confounding by mammography or breast\nself-examination screening activities. However, the inverse\nassociation between physical activity and breast cancer\nremained after stratifying by stage at diagnosis, suggesting\nthat this was unlikely to be a strong bias. Our physical activ-\nity measure has not been validated; it is inversely associated\nwith total mortality and functional decline over 3 and 6 years\nof follow-up in this cohort (17). There are many strengths to\nthis study including the population-based prospective design,\nhigh participation rate, complete follow-up, use of a SEER\ncancer registry to ascertain breast cancer diagnoses, in-per-\nson interviews, assessment of the presence of physical dis-\nabilities, measurement of both recreational and home mainte-\nnance physical activity, and control for many of the major\nknown breast cancer risk factors.\nIn summary, we found an inverse association between\nlevel of postmenopausal physical activity in physically capa-\nble older women and risk of breast cancer. The biologic\nunderpinning to this finding is not known, but plausibly could\nbe related to the improved insulin sensitivity that occurs with\nmodest levels of physical activity. This hypothesis warrants\nfurther consideration, as it may have implications for the pri-\nmary prevention of breast cancer in elderly women.\n"
