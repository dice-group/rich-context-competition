Such body is portrayed as distinguishable from the law-abiding citizen and, in this\ncontext, the body of an individual who commits crime emerges as the non-normative\nbody par excellence, the body that transgresses the rules of law and social order. The\nphotograph plays a role in documenting and constructing this body through the represen-\ntation of the deviant other. This is illustrated by Sekula (1986: 7, emphases in original)\nwhen he says that the photograph `came to establish and delimit the terrain of the other,\nto define both the generalized look \u00ad the typology \u00ad and the contingent instance of devi-\nance and social pathology'.\nThe use of photographic portraits for the identification of the criminal body has long\nbeen a focus of interest in the social sciences, especially so when exploring the historical\nevolution of criminal identification practices and in reference to studies that considered\ncriminality as being physically manifested on the body. Indeed, from its invention in the\nearly 19th century, photography has been a vital element in the construction of the crimi-\n1986; Tagg, 1988). However, to date, there is a lack of empirical studies that have\napproached the consequences of such practices in the everyday contexts of the actors of\nthe criminal justice system.\nIn this article, we present findings from empirical work conducted in three Portuguese\nprisons where we discuss the role of prisoners'photographic portraits as observable bod-\nily economies (Walby and Carrier, 2010). Walby and Carrier (2010) use this concept to\nexplore the continuities of criminological discourses around the visible pathologic ele-\nments of corporeality. These authors consider the construction of the `criminal man'over\ntime and perceive the bodily economies as `cultural artifacts visualized, captured, con-\nstructed, and analyzed by criminologists' (Walby and Carrier, 2010: 262). This concept\nis then a valuable analytical tool to understand the `solidification [...] of criminological\npathologizations of the bios'(2010: 275) through the capturing of corporeality, for exam-\nple, by taking photographs.\nIn this article, we analyse how different social actors construct the criminal body\nby exploring the meanings attributed to the prisoners' photographic portraits. We\nexamine how such portraits mediate the relationship between the actors of the crimi-\nnal justice system in practice, namely prisoners, prison guards and probation officers.\nIn particular, we discuss how the photographic documentation of prisoners acts as a\nclassification device and a visual representation of the criminal. As Jonathan Finn\n(2009: 10) states: `visual representations of the criminal body emerge from continual\nnegotiations among humans, technology, and the social networks through which they\ninteract'. We argue that this representation, by portraying elements of unworthiness,\nunpleasantness and immutability, plays a significant role in the parole board's deci-\nsions and produces an embodied sense of identity and perpetuation of stigma. This\nwork critically contributes to the intersection of criminology and the visual (Carney,\nways in which the camera is used in the act of making the criminal visible' (Finn,\nMiranda and Machado 3\nMethodology\nIn this article, we draw on data from a wider qualitative study that explores the impacts\nof identification technologies (such as photographs, fingerprints, anthropometric meas-\nurements and DNA profiles) on the co-construction of the body and identity of the crimi-\nnal. If the prison was the laboratory par excellence in the development and use of\nfingerprints and anthropometric identification for prisoners, nowadays these elements\nhave almost disappeared in Portuguese prisons and only the photographic portrait\nremains. While walking through different areas of the prisons, including the library, the\ncafeteria, the infirmary, the school, the common room, the prisoners' cells and other\nspaces,1 it was often possible to observe boards on the walls where the prisoners' photo-\ngraphs taken upon their arrival are exposed. These photographs are also uploaded into\nthe prison services database and then attached to the prisoners'identification records and\nindividual identity cards. Such presence of the photographic portrait in the prison space\nhighlights the need to address the visual and its importance to meaning making. For this\nreason, in this article we focus our attention on photographs and the meanings attributed\nto them in the prison space.\nIn this article we explore the meanings attributed to the prisoners' photographic por-\ntraits not only from the perspective of prison staff \u00ad prison guards and probation officers\n\u00ad but also from the meanings constructed by individuals categorized as criminals, more\nspecifically, people serving a prison sentence. This empirical study draws on semi-\nstructured interviews, informal conversations and direct observation conducted in three\nmale prisons of different sizes, geographical locations and security levels between June\n2013 and June 2014. Using an interpretive and constructionist approach, our analysis\nstems from fieldwork developed by the first author in the prison context within the\nPortuguese criminal justice system.\nInterviews were conducted with 26 prisoners, 10 prison guards and eight probation\nofficers.2 In addition to these more structured instruments for empirical data collection,\ninformal conversations were held with various social actors who operate in the prison\nspace, and the social interactions that occur there were observed (namely the situations\nin which the prisoners are photographed).\nThe data were systematically coded following principles of analytic induction\n(Charmaz, 2006). Initially, we developed categories such as photographic portraits and\ncriminality/physique. We then subjected the data to multiple readings in order to develop\nthe initial categories into more abstract, focused codes. During this analytical process,\nmemo writing was used to support the interpretation and analysis of the data (Charmaz,\nThe data collected in this study are contingent on specific circumstances and a spe-\ncific judicial system; however, the questions and thoughts that can be raised based on this\nlocal material are relevant in a wider context. As Jackson (2009: 12) states, the poignant\nprisoner identification photographs used in his book Pictures from a Drawer\nare from a drawer in a particular prison in a particular place, but they could as well have come\nfrom a similar drawer in a similar prison [...] [as] there are things in and about [these images]\nof far wider moment.\nPhotography and the Construction of the Criminal Body\nBringing the camera close to the prisoner's face so that `his features are clear', a photo-\ngraphic portrait of the prisoner, similar to the photographs used in passports and citizen\nidentity cards, is taken.3 This portrait is then uploaded into the computer system and is\nused in the various paper identification records that circulate through several prison ser-\nvices and in the prisoner's individual identity card.\nThe inmate Jacinto (convicted for theft and other crimes with a sentence of four years)\ndiscusses these procedures and `how everyone does that [photographic portrait], so they\n[prison staff] can have it in the database and in the prisoner's cards'. As argued by Sekula\n(1986: 25, emphasis in original), in prison practice, photography aims precisely `to pre-\nserve a sufficient record of a personality to be able to identify the present description with\none which may be presented at some future time'. The face, as the part of the body that\nallows us to distinguish ourselves, our singularities and to be recognized by others/our-\nselves, is particularly relevant in this context where the photographic portrait is used for\npurposes of identification.\nConsidering Pavlich's (2009: 185, emphasis in original) discussion around criminal\nidentification as `a creative process rather than one of discovery', we must reflect on the\nprocess of creation of criminal identities through the use of methods such as photo-\ngraphs. As Pavlich (2009: 185) mentions, criminal identification `is constitutively\ninvolved in deploying the very identities it purports to discover; the \"known criminal\" is\nboth the starting and ending point of', in this case, the photography. As we will see, pris-\noners'photographic portraits play a role in this process by representing the criminal body\nas unworthy, unpleasant and unchanging.\nPortraying the unworthy: Photography and parole decisions\nThese photographic portraits have impacts on how the prisoners perceive themselves and\nhow prison staff attribute meanings to the prisoner. The embodied self is reconstituted,\nand the photograph participates in the construction of prisoner's identity, and through it,\nothers attribute meanings to the prisoner's face. As we will now explore, the parole deci-\nsion-making process is a noteworthy example that illustrates how the meanings attrib-\nuted to the photograph portray the criminal body as unworthy.\nWhen the parole board is considering the release of offenders from prison, each panel\nis usually comprised of different criminal justice actors. In the Portuguese penal system,\nwe would have the participation of the probation officer, the judge, the chief of the prison\nguards and a member of the board of directors of the prison. The parole board members\nwould then evaluate the prisoners' personality, progress and behaviour while incarcer-\nated. There are different factors that influence this evaluation, such as offenders'criminal\nhistory, mental health, institutional misconduct and participation in programmes appro-\npriate to the offence (Connor, 2016; Hannah-Moffat and Yule, 2011; Ministry of Justice,\nMost research on parole decision making highlights the use of discretionary judge-\nments during a process that mainly relies on evidence of progress and positive demon-\nstrations of change (Connor, 2016; Hannah-Moffat and Yule, 2011; Ministry of Justice,\nMiranda and Machado 5\n2010). There are various types of information that are included in the case file in order to\nevaluate whether an early release can be granted; such as the criminal record, programme\nreports, misconduct and disciplinary reports, adequate release plans and other profes-\nsional reports (such as psychological or psychiatric assessments). Such correctional and\nrisk assessment logics are paramount and during the parole board sitting these docu-\nments are available so board members `rely on the authority of file information'(Hannah-\nThe prisoners' identification records, which contain the respective photograph, are\nalso used when discussing each case. During this study, it was revealed that there is usu-\nally a demonstration of unpleasantness by the parole board members that is associated\nwith viewing the photographic portrait (`ugh, that's awful') in the prisoners' records.\nThis photographic portrait, as we will explore further in the next section, does not pro-\nvide a positive visual representation of change. This reaction allows us to question how\nthese portraits impact on the parole board's assessment and the decisions made regard-\ning the prisoners' release and future life.\nWe argue that the meanings attributed to the prisoner's photographic portrait have\nimplications when deciding whether that offender will be released.4 In the words of the\nprobation officer Renata (18 years of service), the prisoner's physical appearance shown\nin the photographic portrait `helps in thinking he is worthless'; that is, in not believing\nthat the prisoner can stop being a criminal. This process of attributing sense to photo-\ngraphs relates to a very explicit repressive logic of photography (Sekula, 1986: 10\u00ad11).\nThe belief that the surface of the body, and especially the face, conveys distinctive signs\nthat reveal the true, inner character of the person makes the photographs of criminals a\nmode of instrumental realism and a way of embodying the unworthy (Sekula, 1986: 10).\nPhotography has had the same function from the beginning of its creation to the\npresent that is grounded in the idea that it may be viewed as a medium for authentically\nrecording truth or artifice (Carrabine, 2014).5 As we will explore, photographs are\nalways ontologically fallible and partial and their uses in the prison represent tentative\nefforts to capture private selves, tackle emotions and stand up for an approach that is\nopen to the complex, or fragmented, meanings condensed in each and every image\nThe unpleasant and unchanging criminal body\nWhen exploring how the unworthy body is constructed through the meanings prison staff\nand prisoners attribute to the use of photographic portraits, there are two very significant\nelements that associate such portraits with a visual representation of the criminal: the\nperception of an unpleasant and unchanging body.\nThe photographic portrait is perceived as a representation of an `abnormal' and ugly\nbody, seen as unpleasant and repulsive. Such abnormality is inscribed on this body so the\nmarks of criminality are visible (Rose, 2000: 8). The focus on `ugliness' as a symbol of\ndeviance reveals a way of inflicting individual responsibility and relates to a physiogno-\nmic code of interpretation of the prisoner's portrait. The construction of the criminal sub-\nject cannot be dissociated from the construction of a law-abiding body, with ugliness\nbeing associated with the perturbing force of crime and social stability with beauty\n(Sekula, 1986: 22). Indeed, the guards and officers often used expressions such as `mean\nface' or `peculiar aspect' when commenting on photographic portraits of individuals con-\nvicted of crimes. This extract from the field notes illustrates the use of such expressions:\nThe guard did not always remember [the prisoners] I asked to call [for the interview]. `I need\nto check their face [in a derogatory way] if I do not know' [...] I asked him [the guard] what is\nthe purpose of the boards [with the prisoners' photographs] on the walls at the entrance. He\nexplained those were the prisoners that worked outside the prison [...] and asked me back `they\nlook mean, don't they?' Later on, Clara and Filipa, both working as probation officers in the\nsame prison, were looking at the photographs of a prisoner in the computer system while\ncommenting on how he looked evil. (Field note)\nThe repulsive and distorted physical aspect represented in the photographic portrait6\nis perceived by the prisoners as a deliberate act on the part of the prison guards, thus\nconveying associations with the idea of physiognomy studies that `facial attractiveness\nwas an indicator of virtue, while ugliness denoted vice' (Carrabine, 2014: 139). As men-\ntioned by Carney (2017: 281), `the photograph circulates as an ordering force of figura-\ntion and disfigurement' and `to disfigure is, in one way or another, to attack the body, to\ndeform it, to change its shape and its image' (2017: 285). The unpleasant photographic\nportrait has impacts on prisoners' feelings, as they perceive the portrait to be constructed\nin a way so they look ugly. The inmate Fl\u00e1vio (convicted for homicide with a sentence of\n20 years and no previous criminal record) describes below how the photographs taken\nby the guards transform them into `ugly beings' and represent them with a physical\naspect with which they do not identify or recognize themselves:\nThe person takes the photograph, and the guards distort it in every way, they give you a pointy\nface that looks like a monster. How so? They distort the photograph. Distort? Exactly. It\nhappens that I don't have here a photograph to show you, it is in my cell. But you can see on\nmy [prisoner identification] card what they do. They take a photograph, and then they distort it\nall, they make the face look pointy and pull [the features] [...] They make a person look like an\nanimal, a monster. Therefore, it is already not beautiful, but the person still becomes more...\nThe photographs are distorted, in your opinion? Not in my opinion, they really do that. [They\ndo it] to humiliate the person, I believe. You look at the photograph and think, `Looks like an\nanimal, looks like a monster.' Looking at that is traumatic.\nThe prisoners feel they are shaped to look like animals and ugly creatures through the\nuse of prison photographs and their portraits of `abnormal' bodies. We argue that these\nembodied lived experiences have an impact on their stigmatized identities as prisoners\nand on the construction of their self through processes of incorporation and exclusion\n(Goffman, 1963). The prisoners' photographs form the basis for a shared prisoner iden-\ntity. In the words of Katja Franko Aas (2004: 386): `categorical thinking is based on the\nbinary either/or logic that puts people or objects into categories, while obscuring the\nambiguities'. Following this categorical thinking, the photographs de-contextualize pris-\noners' personal positions and narratives in order to standardize their stigmatized identi-\nties based on their belonging to a specific social category (Aas, 2004; Goffman, 1963;\nRowe, 2011): the (un)worthy, the (un)pleasant and the (un)changing. This forms a\nMiranda and Machado 7\ncategorical view of criminals, prisoners and offenders. Again, in the words of Ces\u00e1rio,\nused as the epigraph to this article:\nYou can't look good in the photo. This is a prison... we can't look good. We can't repeat and\nget the second photo if we want. It is `stand against the wall', click and that is it. This is a prison.\nThe last element of the association of photographic portraits with a visual representa-\ntion of the criminal is the immutability of this body. The prisoners' portraits are taken\nwhen they arrive but they are not updated during their time in prison. Regarding this\npractice of not updating the photographs, the prisoners noted how they are no longer\nrecognized nor recognize themselves in the photograph initially taken because their\nappearance has changed over the years. Luis (convicted for robbery with a sentence of\n13 years and with previous criminal record) explores this when he explains how he does\nnot recognize himself in the portrait that was taken when he first got into prison. The\nsame happens when the prison guards look at that portrait:\nI can tell you that the photo they have of me \u00ad that's not me. And it is really different, very\ndifferent. One of these days... \u00ad I work in the school, I give support and look after the\nmanagement of it \u00ad and in the school, you have the photos and numbers of all the students and\neveryone that passes by. One of these days they were commenting that and my boss even called\nme and said `come here, see if you know this guy here' and I looked [at the photo] and said\n`that's me maybe 12 years ago', `but it does not look like you or anything', and I `nop, but you\nknow how it is... people get older, they change and create new habits, new hairstyles or this or\nthat and that makes a difference, as you can see', `you need to update this man, I don't recognize\nthis guy, so ugly' [laughs] always playing around.\nBoth probation officers, Renata and Mariana, explore the portrayal of this immutabil-\nity when discussing the use of their information system to document and evaluate prison-\ners' progress in the prison context. They highlight the positive changes prisoners go\nthrough during imprisonment and how that is not represented in the photographic por-\ntrait. In their words:\nThese photographic portraits are not updated, right? We all know that they come from the\nstreets, a lot of times homeless or drug addicts, those are the ones that will positively change\ntheir physical appearance and it would be important to update [their portraits]. (Officer Renata)\nI confess that in terms of photography I really do not... I do not value it for a simple reason.\nBecause it has a lot to do with their [prisoners'] appearance when arriving from the street.\nSometimes after a period of great human degradation that the person lives as homeless, where\nthere is a neglect in terms of how the person looks like and self-care... that very often shows\nhow they arrive at the prison. And then, once they start to regulate their conduct, their physical\nappearance also changes and, after a month or two, we see the person and we look at the photo\nwhen the person arrived and they do not match. (Officer Mariana)\nDuring the interviews, the probation officers argue that the prison guards should be\nmade aware of the importance of updating such photographs so that positive change is\nmaterialized. When discussing these issues with the guards, they acknowledge that\nprisoners' physical appearance usually changes drastically. However, since guards and\nprisoners interact on a daily basis, it is much more difficult for them to notice such\nchanges during their professional routine. Just like the guard Mateus says: `We are with\nthem [prisoners] every day. Those that notice such differences [on their physical appear-\nance] are those that do not have such a close contact with the individuals.' Nonetheless,\nguards still recognize that prisoners' portraits are not updated and, consequently, do not\nacknowledge how physical appearance changes during incarceration. In the words of the\nguards Valter and N\u00e9lson:\nSometimes they enter [in the prison] looking like vagabonds... and that is the most frequent\nsituation. Entering with a vagabond look, long hair, very thin and then, after a while, we look\nat them and almost do not recognize them... Better nutrition, short hair, trimmed beard...\n(Guard Valter)\nMost of the prisoners, maybe 90% \u00ad I could even show examples and call a random prisoner\nhere \u00ad let's say, one that arrived three years ago, and show the photo so you could see how he\nlooks like now... It is such a difference. It is not the same person. I think the photo... it should\nbe taken at x and x time, update the file [...] long beard, long hair, from the streets really, we\ncan't smell because the portrait does not allow it [laughs] otherwise you would notice the\ndifference [laughs]. (Guard N\u00e9lson)\nMost of the prisoners also report how bad they look in the photograph either because\nthey are `all bruised' due to physical assaults or their features are altered due to drugs.\nTheir physical appearance changes while serving their sentence. The prison space relates\nto the body, and the sentence time is inscribed on the imprisoned body (Moran, 2012;\nWahidin and Tate, 2005). Nevertheless, it is the photographic record `in which they are all\nmarked', which endures as a way of locking the past, as a criminal biography, and as a\nperpetuation of stigma through the materialization of ugliness as a sign of criminality. The\ninmates Luis and Jaime address this `mark' perpetuated by the photographic records that\nare seen on a daily basis on the walls of the prison and in the prisoner's identity card:7\nWhen I entered the prison, they took my photograph with a long beard [...] They take\nphotographs as we enter here, right? Some of us try to change this, but there is nothing we can\ndo. They take the photograph as we are; even all bruised, as we came from the police... [...]\nThis is almost like a form of humiliation, do you know what I mean? A form of humiliation?\nTaking the photograph? Exactly. Don't you think? I do [...] Being all bruised in a photograph\nthat is in a database, a card in which, every day, one is seen to circulate in the prison... it is\nnonsense. Don't you think? (Inmate Lu\u00eds)\nThe photo I have here on my prisoner's card is the photo taken when I got in for the first time,\nwhere I am all bruised. That's the photo from the first time I got arrested, now for the second\ntime the photo is exactly the same. (Inmate Jaime)\nThe narratives of prisoners reveal how the photographs taken for their identification\nin the prison are viewed as `deepening' the stigma of delinquency in their bodies and\nselves (Prainsack and Kitzberger, 2009: 69). These photographic portraits are central to\nthe construction, expression and experience of the `pains of imprisonment' (Sykes,\nMiranda and Machado 9\n1958), namely, the deprivation of autonomy and self-control. Through a process of\nobjectification of the body that reduces the prisoners to their physicality and, conse-\nquently, reduces their human agency (Aas, 2004), the photographs assume the role of\ninstitutionalized memories of their delinquency.\nPedro (convicted for rape, theft, robbery and other crimes with a sentence of 18 years\nand with previous criminal record) explores how his photographic portrait remained the\nsame during his imprisonment and how he would like to see that portrait updated (just\nlike the photograph in his citizen card8 that portrays his changing appearance). However,\nthe body portrayed in the photograph used during his imprisonment remains\nimmutable:\nThe photo I have there [prison's file] could be updated. Now I am a hard man and you have a\nkid there [in the photo]. They could take that one of the kid away and put one from now [smile].\nThe photo they have of me is like... 10 years old [laughs]. Not that long ago I went to... get the\ncitizen card and took some photos, new ones, and I asked the lady for a copy and everything \u00ad it\nis a photocopy but well \u00ad `it is to put in my cell as a memory so and so'. And here they could\nalso... they could take another photo and update what they have, but no. Here it's always the\nsame. They never change it. I can get in and get out now and get in five or six years again, they\ngo to the file and they will throw the photo from 2003 at me [laughs].\nThe photographic portrait of the prisoner standing against the wall will result in a\nutilitarian portrait that is part of the system of control (Jackson, 2009: 11). The partici-\npants explore such role of the portrait and that is exemplified by the words of Gaspar\n(convicted for drug trafficking, theft, robbery and other crimes to seven years and with-\nout previous criminal record) when he differentiates the photographic portrait, its role\nand uses according to where it was taken: inside or outside criminal justice institutions:\nIt is a weird situation, isn't it? When we are outside and take a photo... I used to live near this\nhistorical place with medieval walls and I would stay there taking photos... and now the guard\ntakes photos of me and it is strange. It feels weird, you already know that photo is related to a\ncriminal record.\nThese photographic portraits have the function of `[folding] a person into the controlled\nspace of a dossier [...] [that] contains the past and the future' (Jackson, 2009: 21). This\nbureaucratic dossier becomes a mirror of ourselves and `[turns] the infinitude of facts and\nemotions and connections that make each of us the ever-changing unique creatures we are\ninto manageable things' (2009: 21). The prisoners' perceptions of the photographs high-\nlight a complex process of emotional work (Chamberlen, 2015: 10) in which they articulate\nand frame their emotions by enacting them on their photographs. The inmate Nuno exem-\nplifies this when he says `there is no need to smile or anything. It is even better to have a\nserious [facial] expression, right? The person is not happy to be in prison, right?'\nBeyond the prison walls: Portraying the (mutable) criminal body\nDespite the changes physical appearance goes through during imprisonment, the photo-\ngraphic portraits perpetuate the image of an unchanging criminal body. Nonetheless,\nwhen the same body is subject to photographic identification procedures outside the\nprison, this body is portrayed as mutable. This mutable criminal body is constantly sub-\nject to photographic identification procedures, in particular, when in contact with the\npolice during criminal investigations.\nMost of the prisoners interviewed make a clear distinction for how photographic pro-\ncedures occur in prison and policing contexts. Nuno (convicted for homicide with a\nsentence of 20 years and with previous criminal record), for instance, describes how\npolice inspectors keep taking his photographs to update his changing physical appear-\nance in their database while he was being investigated as a suspect:\nI remember that I told them [police inspectors] that I already have photos and they [said] `we\nknow that but we need to update them', I don't know but they always take more photos because\nwe can look different, right?\nThe prisoners also explain that police photographic procedures are usually more exhaus-\ntive so the details of such physical changes are captured and stored. For that reason, photo-\ngraphs are usually taken of specific parts of their body and, in particular, their face. For\ninstance, scars, tattoos, beard, hair colour and length, are some of the physical features that\nusually change over time and are photographed in detail. Jaime (convicted with a sentence\nof 24 years, and with previous criminal record) exemplifies such detail when he describes\nthe moment police officers took photographs of his tattoos and a scar on his face:\nsecond time they got me, I had another tattoo and they took a photo of it. All the details, right?\nThey also took [a photo] of my scar \u00ad I opened my lip and got a scar and they also got that one.\nPedro also illustrates how his photographs were taken during criminal investigation in\norder to update photographs taken in the past by the police that did not portray his chang-\ning body and physical appearance:\nSome years passed by, right? And I was 18 years [last time I had photos taken] and had certain\nfacial features... young guy, right? I still feel young, despite I am 30, but they had to take [new\nphotos] anyway because they said my facial features changed a bit and then they never saw me\nwith a beard [...] They had me as a little kid, that face looking very... And they had to update\nit and this last time they took more photos. The officer `ah tattoos and all' and took photos of\nthem. Last time they got me I also had a different hair colour... [...] They only wanted to\nupdate the years that went by, the years I was in prison and now, suppose I go back to the streets\nand commit more crimes... If people see the 18-year-old photos certainly `it is not this one'...\nAnd they wanted something more... more up-to-date. (Inmate Pedro)\nThe differences in the practices within and outside prisons mean that the photograph\nis a site for advancing our understandings of the link between the `pains of imprison-\nwords, the `pains of imprisonment' (Sykes, 1958) are very much inscribed in and\nexpressed through the feelings of the prisoners when talking about their photographs and\ntheir temporality. These discourses reveal how prisoners understand incarceration\nthrough their photos and how the process of being photographed has a significant effect\non the sense of their own identities and stigma (Goffman, 1963).\nMiranda and Machado 11\nPrisoners consider that the manipulation of the photograph is a representation of the\nsubordination to the prison and the dispossession of agency, whereas prison staff con-\nsider the photograph to be a means of establishing discipline, control and social order.\nThe focus on faces in the photographs allows us to look at both identity formation and\npower relations. The photograph of the prisoner is a target of meaning attributions\nthrough which the photograph is being set in direct correlation with social and power\nrelations (Carney, 2017). Such relations projected in the uses and meanings attributed to\nthe prisoners'photographs convey the social and cultural environment of prisons and the\nrespective social hierarchy.\nAs means for identification and representation of the criminal body, photographs can-\nnot be viewed as passive or inanimate. As bodily economies (Walby and Carrier, 2010)\nparticipating as indicators of criminality, the meanings attributed to the photographic\nportrait of prisoners co-constitute the criminal body. Such portrait and the meanings\nattributed to it are a relational object that is not given or stable but that is enacted in prac-\ntices (Carney, 2017). From an embodied perspective, the photograph of a prisoner is a\nmaterialization of cultural norms co-produced to give meanings to the criminal body. In\nthe words of Chamberlen (2015: 11): `the body is a material entity and a cultural con-\nstruction. To the extent that bodies reflect social norms, they offer a unique perspective\non oppressive structures and environments such as the prison.'\nConclusion\nPhotographs can be seen as visual evidence of the difference between the criminal and\nthe non-criminal and as reinforcing an element of otherness (Carrabine, 2012, 2014;\nWe explored how these stories are materialized by the prisoner's photographic portrait\nby understanding the role of such portraits as observable bodily economies (Walby and\nCarrier, 2010) when making the criminal body visible.\nIn order to explore the contemporary use of photography, we discussed how individu-\nals with very different social positionings in the everyday life of prisons (prisoners,\nprison guards and probation officers) construct the criminal body through the use of\nthese portraits. We demonstrated how these portraits act as a classification device by\ndeveloping a conceptual analysis of how the criminal body is portrayed: as unpleasant\nand unchanging. We argue that the meanings attributed to these portraits have impacts on\noffender rehabilitation and reintegration by visually portraying the unworthy. The con-\nstruction of such criminal body cannot be dissociated from the construction of a law-\nabiding body (Sekula, 1981, 1986). For this reason, when considering the different\nfactors that influence parole decision making, the role of the prisoner's portrait must be\nhighlighted, as it does not provide the positive demonstration of change that is sought\nwhen making such decisions.\nThe criminal body is a stigmatized body and, through a process of objectification,\nthe prisoners are reduced to their physicality. The meanings attributed to these photo-\ngraphic portraits have impacts on their stigmatized identities as prisoners (Goffman,\n1963). There is an understanding of incarceration through such visual representations,\nas they are central to the experience of the `pains of imprisonment' and its link to pris-\nembodied self is reconstituted, and the photograph participates in the prisoner's identity\nconstruction, and through it, others attribute meanings to the prisoner's appearance. The\nways in which the criminal body becomes intelligible render different power relations\nvisible, as the prisoner's portrait expresses the social and cultural environment of the\nprison space and its social hierarchy.\nThis analysis contributes to the literature on the visual within criminology and, in\nparticular, on how the photograph is used to `figure' and `disfigure' (Carney, 2017) the\norder to continue exploring the meanings attributed to the physical appearance and the\naesthetics concerned with disorder, criminality and deviance. One challenge will be to\ndetermine how, in the near future, new and old forms of reading the criminal body can be\ncombined. New forms of identification and criminal suspicion (for instance, the collec-\ntion and storage of biometric or genetic information in large computerized databases)\nmay not replace the old methods but instead reinforce each other in shifting the focus of\ncontrol towards potential offenders and re-offenders. Further work focused on the use of\nsuch technologies and the role of the body as a source of identification but also of predic-\ntion of criminality is indispensable. For now, it remains an open question how the imbri-\ncation of old and new forms of identifying and making legible and transparent the\ncriminal body will change conceptions of human identity.\n"
