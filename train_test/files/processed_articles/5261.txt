    "abstract": "Abstract\nOxytocin is associated with social behavior. In humans, several studies have assessed the relationship between social\nbehavior and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)--rs53576--within the gene encoding the oxytocin receptor (OXTR).\nFewer studies have assessed the relationship between human sociability and the SNP rs3796863 found within the cluster\nof differentiation 38 (CD38) gene, whose product has been found to facilitate the secretion of oxytocin. This research\nexamines whether these polymorphisms are associated with facial age discrimination. Young adults (N = 43) were genotyped\nmale and female faces. Participants with the OXTR GG and the CD38 CC genotypes discriminated facial aging better than\nthose possessing at least one A allele at either locus. These polymorphisms appear to be associated with social information\nprocessing involved in facial age discrimination.\n",

Advances in molecular biology have\nenabled a much more informed study of the impact of spe-\ncific genes on social behavior. Limited research, however,\nhas attempted to link specific genes to psychological pro-\ncesses involved in social cognition, and none of this research\nhas examined the role of specific genes in facial age dis-\ncrimination. The current research examines the relationship\nbetween single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within\ntwo genes associated with social behavior and cognition,\nthat is, rs53576 located in the oxytocin receptor gene (here-\nentiation 38 gene (hereafter CD38), and the ability of young\nadults to discriminate facial aging in sets of faces ranging\nOxytocin, OXTR, and CD38\nOxytocin is a neurohypophysial hormone and nonapeptide\nneurotransmitterproducedinthehypothalamus.Oxytocinergic\nphysiology is associated with a range of social behavior, affili-\nation, and bonding (e.g.,Bakermans-Kranenburg & van\nThe OXTR gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor to\nwhich oxytocin binds (Gimpl & Fahrenholz, 2001).\nof OXTR, is associated with sensitivity to social stimuli and\nsocial behavior.

With age, the face elongates\nand becomes less rounded. There is a decrease in the size of\nthe forehead and eyes relative to the face and an increase in\nthe relative size and angularity of the chin. The placement of\nthe eyes moves above the face's midline, the nose becomes\nmore pronounced and elongated, and skin becomes coarser\nand more varied in color.\nEcological theorists (e.g., McArthur & Baron, 1983;\nto these facial features has a biological basis and is rooted in\nour evolutionary past. How others perceive and respond to\nthese features is associated with a number of social conse-\nquences. Youthful faces are perceived as cuter and evoke\nmore physical attraction than older faces (Alley, 1988; Gross,\nImmature faces are also perceived as more helpless and\ndependent than mature faces (Berry & Zebrowitz-McArthur,\nevolutionary and ecological perspective (e.g., Eibl-\npresumed that our response to faces is adaptive and stems\nfrom social selective pressures encountered in the course of\nhuman evolution. We ensure the survival of our young by\nhaving a genome that has been fine-tuned to bring about per-\nceptual skills allowing us to recognize immature faces as\nyoung and in need of succor, nurturance, and protection\nEvidence of a biological basis for age perception and\nassociating mental and physical states with facial age comes\nfrom several sources. Perception of immaturity in faces\noccurs very early in life. By 4 months of age, children are\nsensitive to the facial features associated with aging (Kramer,\nZebrowitz, San Giovanni, & Sherak, 1995; McCall &\nThe perception of youthfulness in young faces and its\nassociation with dependence is also found across cultures\n(e.g., Zebrowitz, Montepare, & Lee, 1993). Furthermore,\nparticular groups of individuals are deficient in their ability\nto perceive facial aging. Gross (2002) noted that, compared\nwith neuro-typical children, those with autism had difficulty\ndiscriminating aging in nonhuman faces.\nOverview and Hypotheses\nThe accurate perception of facial age is important to social\ninteraction and, perhaps, even survival. Little research, how-\never, has examined factors associated with sensitivity to facial\naging. Given genetic influence on social behavior (Knafo &\nPlomin, 2006), it is reasonable to assume that the physiology\nassociated with specific genes might influence the more explic-\nitly defined social cognitive processes associated with facial\nage perception. To date, no one has examined a genetic basis\nfor sensitivity to facial aging and facial age discrimination.\nIn the current study, young adults participated in a task of\nsocial cognition that required the detection of aging in sets of\nfaces. In addition to completing the age discrimination task,\nparticipants provided buccal cell samples that were subse-\nloci. Both OXTR and CD38 loci have been associated with\noxytocinergic signaling and social functioning. Based on past\nresearch, it was hypothesized that participants with the GG\ngenotype of OXTR or the AA/AC genotype of CD38 would\nperform better on the age discrimination task than partici-\npants possessing the OXTR GA/AA or CD38 CC genotypes.\nGiven the ecological importance of detecting aging in very\nyoung faces and a presumed biological disposition for doing\nso, it was predicted that individuals possessing the GG geno-\ntype of OXTR or the AA/AC genotype of CD38 would more\naccurately identify aging in younger rather than older faces\ncompared with participants with alternative genotypes.\nMethod\nParticipants\nPrior to beginning this study and based on similar studies\nneed to recruit between 40 and 45 participants. Our sample\nconsisted of nine male (two Asian-, two Hispanic-, five\nfemale (one Asian-, two African-, seven Hispanic-, 24\nadults. The distribution of participant genotypes at the OXTR\nand CD38 loci is shown in Table 1. Based on the convention\ndata from participants with the OXTR GA/AA and CD38\nCA/AA genotypes were combined for analyses.\nNeither OXTR nor CD38 allele frequencies deviated from\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium--chi-square goodness of fit:\nOXTR\nGross et al. 3\nrespect to the two genotyped loci, alleles segregated inde-\npendently within the sampled population--chi-square test of\nin accordance with ethical standards established by the\nAmerican Psychological Association and received $10.00\nfor their participation.\nFacial Age Perception Task\nParticipants were asked to respond to 10 facial age sets. Half\nof the face sets consisted of male and half of female faces.\nFor both male and female faces, one set consisted of faces\nTo construct each set, full face, color photographs were\nobtained of the same four individuals as they appeared at a\nyounger (e.g., 5 years old) and older (e.g., 8 years old) age.\nFaces had no adornment, a pleasant expression, and closed\nmouths. Photographs of the four younger and four older faces\nwere morphed into composite prototypical images of the\nyounger and older face. These younger and older prototypical\nfaces were then morphed across 28 steps to create the 10 sets\nof 29 faces that, within each set, gradually changed from the\nyoungest to the oldest face. Photographs were framed in oval\nmasks to eliminate hair and clothing (Figure 1). This proce-\ndure for studying facial aging was adapted from previous\nmethodology used to assess discrimination of social proper-\nties of the face (e.g., ethnicity, gender; for example, Corneille,\nHuart, Becquart, & Br\u00e9dart, 2004; Ng, Ciaramitaro, Anstis,\nParticipants were assessed individually. Using a computer\nprogram developed in PsyScope (Cohen, MacWhinney,\nFlatt, & Provost, 1993), participants were shown, one set at a\ntime, 10 sets of 29 faces. Stimuli were presented on a com-\nputer console. At the start of each trial, faces were randomly\nplaced into an array of 29, 4.5 \u00d7 5 cm windows. Participants\nwere directed to examine the faces in the array and to mouse-\nclick on the face that appeared the youngest. After clicking\non a face, the face was removed from the array and the par-\nticipant was instructed to, again, select the youngest appear-\ning face from the remaining 28. Participants continued in this\nfashion until all 29 faces in the set had been selected. The\ncomputer program recorded the order in which faces were\nselected and the amount of time that it took participants to\nmake their selections. Upon completing one set, another set\nof faces was presented on screen. Male and female face sets\nalternated between trials. The age of the face sets varied ran-\ndomly across presentations. Each participant responded to\neach of the 10 face sets.\nGenotyping\nImmediately preceding or following the administration of\nthe facial age discrimination task, participants rinsed their\nmouths thoroughly with 40 mL of bottled water. They then\nvigorously swished 10 mL of a .9% (m/v) saline solution\nabout the mouth for 30 s before depositing it into a conical\ntube that was placed immediately on ice.\nDNA was isolated from 200 \u00b5L of resuspended buccal\ncells obtained following an initial pelleting of 1 mL of the 10\nmL saline rinse obtained from participants. DNA isolation\nwas conducted using a QIAamp DNABlood Mini kit (Qiagen,\nValencia, CA) within 2 hr of sample collection for all partici-\npants. Genotypic calls were generated using TaqMan SNP\nGenotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)\npant were verified in duplicate at both loci. Reactions were\nconducted using a Type-it Fast Probe PCR Kit (Qiagen) in a\ncal reaction module (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Individual\nPCR reactions contained 1x Type-it Fast SNP Probe PCR\nMaster Mix, 1x TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay, approxi-\nmately20ngofparticipantgenomicDNA,and.5xQ-Solution.\nEach reaction was conducted in a total volume of 25 \u00b5L.\nThermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial step of 5\nat 60\u00b0C. Fluorometric readings for each reaction were\nacquired after every cycle. Genotypes were assigned using\nthe CFX Manager software (Bio-Rad).\nQuantification of Salivary 17-Estradiol\nSeveral previous studies examining individual differences\nwithin the OXTR and CD38 genes have attempted to control\nfor inter-subject variability in female sex hormone levels\n(e.g., Mareckova et al., 2014; Miyahara, Morita, Yamaguchi,\nNonaka, & Maeda, 2000) has found that estradiol concentra-\ntion in females may influence sensitivity to faces and it was\nanticipated that many participants in our sample would be\nfemale, salivary estradiol concentration (pg/mL) was assessed\nfor each participant and used as a covariate in our analyses.\nParticipants provided approximately 2 mL of saliva by way of\npassive drool immediately prior or subsequent to their com-\npletion of the facial age discrimination task. Saliva collection\nand sample storage were in accordance with methods detailed\nby Salimetrics. Samples were assayed at the Arizona State\nUniversity Institute for Interdisciplinary Salivary Bioscience\nTable 1. Distribution of Participant Genotypes: OXTR rs53576\nOXTR\nNote.

These relation-\nships were found for both accuracy and response rate. The\nresponse rate and accuracy measures identified the same\nalleles (i.e., OXTRA, CD38A) as conferring relative impair-\nment on the facial age discrimination task. Although this\nassignment of allele risk is internally consistent, it is at odds\nwith most literature regarding the CD38 locus (Feldman\nParticipants found some facial age sets to be more difficult to\ndiscriminate than others. Notably, they were less accurate when\ndiscriminating aging in older female faces. Presumably due to\nincreased task difficulty, participants took more time making\njudgments about female faces and 9- to 12-year-old faces (i.e.,\nfaces that, with 18- to 22-year-old faces, were least accurately\nFigure 2.

The\nincreased challenge of discriminating female faces, and older\nones in particular, may reflect the earlier maturation of female\nrelative to male faces (e.g., Ferrario, Sforza, Poggio, & Schmitz,\nmay have appeared more similar with respect to age-differenti-\nating features. In addition, mathematically averaged faces are\nperceived as more attractive than individual images used to gen-\nerate them (Rhodes, Sumich, & Byatt, 1999; Valentine, Darling,\n& Donnelly, 2004). Because attractive female faces tend to\nretain youthful features (Cunningham, 1986), it is possible that\nthe female face stimuli reflected an atypically low rate of aging\nthat decreased discrimination accuracy.\nYoung children's faces are perceived as helpless and\ndependent (Berry & Zebrowitz-McArthur, 1988; Gross,\n1997). Assuming that sensitivity to youthful features is, in\npart, based in our biology and has adaptive social conse-\nquences, it was anticipated that individuals having genotypes\nfavoring sociability would perform better when discriminat-\ning younger rather than older faces.\nAlthough both OXTR GG and CD38 CC genotypes\nwere significantly associated with better discrimination\naccuracy, contrary to what was anticipated, there was no\nGenotype \u00d7 Facial Age interaction. This suggests that\nindividuals with the OXTR GG and CD38 CC genotypes\npossess more generalizable (rather than age-specific)\ninformation-processing skills (e.g., scan rates, perceptual\ndisembedding, memory) or specific social information-\nprocessing skills (e.g., increased sensitivity to facial fea-\ntures and/or configurations) (Richler, Cheung, & Gauthier,\n2011) that sensitize them to facial aging across a wide\nrange of ages rather than only to younger faces and those\ntypically in greatest need of care.\nAn interaction between OXTR and CD38 on the rate of\nresponding was observed in two trending interactions.\nParticipants possessing both OXTR GA/AA and CD38 CA/\nAAgenotypes (i.e., at least one risk allele at both loci) tended\nto complete the facial age discrimination task more rapidly\nthan those possessing either genotype in isolation. In addi-\ntion, a CD38 \u00d7 Facial Age interaction was detected, in which\nCD38 CC participants spent more time discriminating 9- to\n12-year-old faces (the more difficult facial age discrimina-\ntion) compared with those with the CA/AA genotype at this\nlocus, whose rate of responding did not significantly differ\nacross any of the facial age groups.\nThese findings are in accordance with those noted by\nresponding more rapidly than those of CC genotype on an\nextended version of the Hariri Emotional Face Task (Hariri,\nTessitore, Mattay, Fera, & Weinberger, 2002). As this para-\ndigm involves a simple one target, two probe match to sam-\nple, it is understandable that the authors were unable to find\nsignificant effects for CD38 genotype on response accuracy,\nan outcome they themselves attributed to a strong ceiling\neffect. Notably, no ceiling effect was found in the present\nstudy, for which distinct main effects of the CD38 genotype\nupon facial recognition accuracy were observed.\nIn contrast to the Sauer et al. (2012) finding, the present\nresearch suggests a beneficial role for the CD38 CC geno-\ntype, potentially by way of its impact upon participants' rate\nof responding. Although Sauer et al. suggest that longer\nresponse latency to social stimuli is indicative of relative\nimpairment on a face recognition task, the present study\nfound no such relationship. In fact, a significant, moderate\ncorrelation was noted between rate of responding and\nresponse accuracy. Those who took more time to make facial\nage judgments discriminated facial aging better.\nAlthough it remains to be substantiated by further\nresearch, it is possible that those possessing risk alleles, as\nassigned within the context of this study, failed to recognize\nand compensate for the relative ambiguity of facial age in\ncertain stimulus sets. This interpretation is particularly com-\npelling when considering trends evident in participants' age\ndiscrimination accuracy when these data are collapsed across\nstimulus gender and both genetic polymorphisms. Notably, a\nstatistically significant decrease in facial age discrimination\naccuracy is present in responses to the 9- to 12-year-old con-\ndition relative to the 1- to 4-year-old and 5- to 8-year-old\nconditions. It is thus possible that individuals with the CD38\nCC genotype were uniquely in a position to perceive and\nrespond to this presumed change in difficulty (i.e., by slow-\ning down) in a way that facilitated a consistent, more accu-\nrate pattern of age discrimination across all age levels.\nThe present study was not without limitations. We note\nour small sample size relative to sample sizes found in con-\ntemporary genetic association studies. Nonetheless, we\nbelieve this study highlights an interesting question and pos-\nsible explanations regarding the relationship between genetic\nfoundations and social cognition.\nWe are also unable to fully account for the apparent\nadvantages afforded by the CD38 CC genotype within the\ncontext of our research task. Although social cognition is\ncentral to facial age perception, related research assessing\nthe CD38 locus in relation to social functioning has consis-\ntently identified the C allele and particularly the CC geno-\ntype as conferring risk (e.g., Feldman et al., 2012; Lerer\nSuch \"allele flips\" (i.e., study-to-study variations in indi-\ncating which allele is associated with risk) are not uncommon\nacross different association studies of oxytocinergic genes\narise due to genetic heterogeneity between the sampled popu-\nlations (e.g., diverging haplotypes, differing allele frequen-\ncies) as well as discordant environmental factors between\npopulations (Clarke & Cardon, 2010). It is unclear to what\nextent our sample may have differed from previous studies\nalong these parameters and we cannot exclude their potential\nimpact upon our assignment of allele risk.\nIt may then be premature to assign risk to the CD38 CC\nvariant. Feldman et al. (2012), for example, noted that\nGross et al. 7\nparents with the CD38 CC genotype had lower levels of\nplasma oxytocin and touched their infants less than parents\nwith alternate genotypes. However, the relationship between\nplasma and cerebrospinal fluid oxytocin concentrations is\nunclear (Winslow, Noble, Lyons, Sterk, & Insel, 2003). As\nplasma oxytocin is excluded from the central nervous system\nby the blood-brain barrier, its relationship to CD38 variation,\nalthough demonstrated, may have inconsistent bearing upon\nhuman social behavior and cognition.\nThe findings demonstrated by Lerer et al. (2010) in autis-\ntic children and their parents, however, may suggest a some-\nwhat counter intuitive explanation of CD38's role in facial\nage perception. Individuals with autism exhibit strength in\nspecific aspects of visual information processing, being\nadept at identifying fine detail in complex figures and sepa-\nrating figure from ground (de Jonge, Kemner, & van\nassessed participants' ability to make subtle discriminations\nwithin the context of a single stimulus set, it may have dis-\nproportionately favored individuals (i.e., those of CD38 CC\ngenotype) possessing greater aptitude for these feature-\nfocused, information-processing skills.\nConclusion\nThis research has suggested a relationship between two SNPs,\ncinergic signaling and facial age discrimination. For OXTR,\nallele assignments identified in this study are consistent with\nthose made in previous studies linking this polymorphism to\nsocial behavior. For CD38, a gene less studied in relation to\nsocial cognition, the risk allele identified in this study is differ-\nent from that identified previously. We have argued that, given\nthe lack of research on the CD38 gene and its social behavioral/\ncognitive correlates, it may be premature to conclusively state\nwhich allele of the CD38 SNP examined here is protective of\nfacial age discrimination ability. Nonetheless, it would appear\nthat facial age discrimination is one of a growing number of\nhuman social behaviors and cognitive processes appreciated as\nbeing impacted by oxytocinergic physiology and genes.\n"
