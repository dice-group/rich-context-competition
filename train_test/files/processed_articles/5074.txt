Introduction\nRecent research on jealousy has been predominantly inspired by an evolutionary\npsychological analysis of sex-specific differences in the responses to a mate's sexual\nand emotional infidelity (Buss, Larsen, Westen, & Semmelroth, 1992; Daly, Wilson,\ninfidelity could reduce a man's reproductive success because of the ensuing risk of\ninadvertently losing an opportunity to reproduce and of investing limited paternal\nresources for the benefit of genetically unrelated offspring. A woman's reproductive\nsuccess, in contrast, is endangered if she loses a male's resources and assistance in\nraising her offspring. A man's mere sexual infidelity does not necessarily imply the\nrisk of losing his paternal investment. Rather, this resource threat arises if he develops\na deep emotional attachment to another mate. As a consequence of these sex-specific\nreproductive threats, the male jealousy mechanism (JM) is hypothesized to be\nWhich Infidelity Type Makes You More Jealous?\nparticularly concerned with a mate's sexual infidelity, whereas the female JM is\nhypothesized to be particularly concerned with a mate's emotional infidelity.\nThe assumption of a sex-specific JM inspired an impressive body of research that\nhas been primarily devoted to testing the hypothesis that the female JM responds with\nstronger negative emotions to a mate's emotional infidelity whereas the male JM\ngenerates stronger negative emotions in response to a mate's sexual infidelity (Harris,\n2003). This hypothesis received considerable empirical support especially from self-\nreport measures of emotional distress using a forced-choice response format (e.g.,\nWiederman & Allgeier, 1993; Wiederman & Kendall, 1999). In each of these studies,\nthe participants had to indicate which form of a mate's hypothetical infidelity would\narouse more intense negative emotional reactions. Across different cultures, a clear\nmajority of women consistently chose emotional infidelity as more distressing or\nupsetting. In addition, men more often than women chose sexual infidelity as that\ntype of a mate's infidelity that would distress or upset them more. However, unlike\nwomen's preference, the men's preference for the predicted infidelity event was (a)\nmostly less pronounced and less consistent (cf. Harris, 2003), (b) varied between\ncultures (e.g., Buunk et al., 1996; Geary et al., 1995), and (c) increased with the\nexperience of a committed sexual relationship (Buss et al., 1992, Study 3).\nThe purpose of the present study is to deepen our understanding of the decision\nstrategies underlying men's and women's choices for one of the two response\nalternatives. Based on the evolutionary view of the JM as a content- and sex-specific\nprediction was tested that both men and women choosing the adaptively primary\ninfidelity type (female sexual and male emotional infidelity, respectively) can rely on\ntheir initial spontaneous response tendency rapidly activated by their sex-specific JM.\nIn contrast, men selecting emotional infidelity and women selecting sexual infidelity\nas more distressing need to engage in additional effortful and rational considerations\nof the possible trade-offs of the two presented options (DeSteno et al., 2002) the\noutput of which might subsequently be used to override their initial response\ntendencies in a final decision. Thus, the main prediction is that regardless of sex, the\ndecision processes resulting in the selection of the adaptively secondary infidelity\ntype (i.e., female emotional and male sexual infidelity) are more elaborate than those\nunderlying the selection of the adaptively primary infidelity type. These differences\nin the elaborateness of the decision processes should be reflected in longer decision\ntimes for the adaptively secondary infidelity type.\nTo test this prediction, the present study replicates and extends a scenario used by\nBuss et al. (1999, Study 2). In this scenario, the participants were asked to imagine\nthat their partner both formed an emotional attachment to another person and had\nsexual intercourse with that other person. Subsequently, they had to indicate which\nWhich Infidelity Type Makes You More Jealous?\naspect of the partner's involvement would upset them more. The present procedure\ndiffers from the Buss et al. (1999) study in one important aspect inasmuch as the\nscenario was not presented as a paper-and-pencil questionnaire; instead, all\ninformation was presented by means of a computer display. The use of the computer\npermitted a recording of the time the participants needed to reach a decision as an\nindicator of the elaborateness of the decision processes. As a further change, the\nparticipants were explicitly asked which aspect of their partner's involvement would\nmake them more jealous instead of the commonly used words upset or distress. One\nreason for explicitly asking for jealousy was that upset and distress might connote\ntwo different emotions (e.g., anger and sadness, respectively). Thus, it cannot be\nexcluded that men and women do not refer to the same emotion when choosing\nbetween the two infidelity types (e.g., men might refer to anger whereas women\nmight refer to sadness). Another reason was that distress and upset might not\nappropriately capture the complexity of the phenomenological experience of jealousy\nwhich could undermine the construct validity of this measure (DeSteno et al., 2002).\nThe participants were 100 female and 100 male students of various disciplines at\nthe University of Bielefeld, Germany. They were recruited in the University hall by\nthe female experimenter. Their mean age was 25.2 years (SD = 3.8). They were not\npaid for their voluntary participation.\nThe experiment was controlled by an IBM compatible microcomputer equipped\nwith an Intel 80486/100 MHz CPU. Instructions, scenarios and response alternatives\nwere presented on a 15'' computer monitor. ERTS (BeriSoft Corporation) was used\nfor event scheduling and response measurement.\nAll instructions were presented on the computer screen and guided the participants\nthroughout the experiment. The participants were informed that a series of scenarios\ndescribing various social situations would be presented on the screen and that each\nscenario would be followed by a forced-choice between two response alternatives A\nand B. More precisely, each scenario briefly described a social situation that was\nfollowed by a question asking for feelings, attitudes or action tendencies that might\noccur in the respective situations. The participants were instructed to vividly imagine\nthe situation and to subsequently press the spacebar in order to view the two pertinent\nresponse alternatives. The participants indicated their decision by pressing one of two\nWhich Infidelity Type Makes You More Jealous?\nlabeled response keys. Before the presentation of the first scenario, the participants\nwere informed more specifically that the social situations all referred to a committed\nromantic relationship that they had had in the past, that they were currently having, or\nthat they would like to have.\nThere were four scenarios. The contents of the scenarios 1 - 3 were unrelated to\nthe present research objectives. Their only function was to accustom the participants\nto the experimental procedure. Scenario 4 was a slightly modified version of the\ninfidelity scenario used by Buss et al. (1999, Study 2):\n\"Imagine you discover that your partner both formed a deep emotional\nand a passionate sexual relationship with another person.\nWhich aspect of your partner's involvement would make you more\njealous?\"\nAfter pressing the space bar, the scenario and the question disappeared and the\nfollowing two response alternatives were immediately offered:\n(A) the deep emotional relationship.\n(B) the passionate sexual relationship.\nThe sequence of describing the two aspects of the partner's involvement in the\nscenario and of their presentation as response alternatives were counterbalanced\nacross participants.\nThe participants were tested individually in a dimly lit laboratory room. Upon\narrival, the participants were seated in front of a computer monitor. In order to\nenhance the perceived anonymity of the study, the female experimenter informed the\nparticipants that her presence was not necessary because the computer would guide\nthem throughout the experiment. The participants were not informed about the\nmeasurement of the time expended on the task from the beginning of the presentation\nof the scenario until they pressed a labeled response key.\n3. Results\n3.1 Choice between the two aspects of involvement\nConsistent with previous findings with a German sample (Buunk et al., 1996),\nboth sexes reported more jealousy about the partner's emotional involvement;\nhowever, reliably more men than women (37% vs. 20%) selected their partner's\nsexual involvement with another person as making them more jealous, 2(1; N = 200)\nWhich Infidelity Type Makes You More Jealous?\nThe decision times were analyzed with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nwith sex and selected infidelity type (emotional vs. sexual infidelity) as the between-\nsubjects factors. Decision times exceeding the respective group means by more than\nthree standard deviations were replaced by the respective group mean. This criterion\nwas met by one male and one female participant both selecting emotional infidelity as\nmaking them more jealous.\nThe mean decision times for men and women selecting emotional or sexual\ninfidelity as eliciting more intense jealousy, respectively, are shown in Figure 1. The\ntwo-way ANOVA of the decision times yielded a reliable main effect for sex, F(1,\nrapidly than men (16.4 s vs. 20.8 s). The main effect for selected infidelity type was\nnegligible, F = 0.\nFigure 1. Mean decision times for women and men selecting emotional or sexual\ninfidelity as eliciting more intense jealousy.\nWhich Infidelity Type Makes You More Jealous?\nMost importantly, however, the predicted interaction between sex and selected type\nwith the predictions derived from the evolutionary analysis of jealousy, women\nselecting emotional infidelity reached their decision reliably faster than women\ncontrast, men selecting sexual infidelity reached their decision reliably faster than\n.035. Thus, the main effect for sex is mainly attributable to the fact that more women\nthan men chose the \"rapid\", adaptively primary infidelity type.\n4. Discussion\nIn accordance with the hypothesis derived from the evolutionary view of jealousy,\ndecisions for the adaptively primary infidelity type were made significantly faster\nthan decisions for the adaptively secondary infidelity type - irrespective of the\nparticipants' sex. These decision time differences suggest that men selecting sexual\ninfidelity employed less elaborate decision strategies than men selecting emotional\ninfidelity. Conversely, women selecting emotional infidelity engaged in less elaborate\nprocessing strategies than women selecting sexual infidelity. These findings support\nthe assumption that men and women selecting the adaptively primary infidelity type\nrelied on their initial response tendency suggested by their respective jealousy\nmechanism, whereas men and women selecting the adaptively secondary infidelity\ntype engaged in additional considerations that lead them to override their initial\nresponse tendency (for similar assumptions in overriding presumably evolved anger\nreactions resulting from unfair social behavior see Sanfey, Rilling, Aronson,\nNystrom, & Cohen, 2003). Additionally, these findings also contribute to the\nemerging evidence of sex-specific differences in the processing of cues to sexual and\nSch\u00fctzwohl (2004) reported that men and women more efficiently process cues to the\nadaptively primary infidelity type; additionally, in the Sch\u00fctzwohl and Koch (2004)\nstudy, men and women were found to preferentially recall cues to the adaptively\nprimary infidelity type. This preferential recall was significant for both men and\nwomen only when the cues referred to one's own mate infidelity but not when they\nreferred to an unknown member of the opposite sex.\nThe present findings also suggest that the forced-choice format does not\nnecessarily induce a method specific elaborate decision process that is independent of\nthe participants' sex and final decision as assumed by DeSteno, et al. (2002). These\nauthors argued that the results traditionally obtained with the forced-choice format\n(women preferentially selecting emotional infidelity and men sexual infidelity) is a\nmethod-specific artifact that is attributable to an effortful decision process invoked in\nall participants and that enables the participants - particularly women - to override\ntheir (sex-unspecific) initial response tendency towards sexual infidelity and to finally\nselect emotional infidelity. Moreover, if at all, this reasoning leads to the prediction\nWhich Infidelity Type Makes You More Jealous?\nthat women selecting emotional infidelity engage in a more elaborate decision\nprocess than women selecting sexual infidelity (who could rely on their initial\nresponse tendency towards sexual infidelity). Obviously, this prediction is clearly\nrefuted by the present findings.\nSome shortcomings of the present study which point in the direction of future\nresearch need to be addressed. First, it is conceivable, that men and women after\nengaging in elaborate processing strategies may still select the adaptively primary\ninfidelity type. Note that this possibility hampers the verification of the hypothesis.\nThe present findings, however, suggest that this might have occurred rarely \u00ad if at all.\nNevertheless, it would be desirable to identify additional evidence for the processing\nstrategies involved in the solution of the forced-choice dilemma. Second, although the\npresent study reveals first insights in men and women's processing strategies when\nconfronted with a forced-choice between sexual and emotional infidelity as the\ninfidelity type eliciting stronger feelings of jealousy, it does not specify the exact\nnature of the decision processes involved, particularly those that cause especially men\nand to a considerably lesser extent women to select the adaptively secondary\ninfidelity type. Thus, an important task of subsequent studies would be to detail the\nrelevant cognitive processes underlying the selection of the adaptively primary and\nsecondary infidelity type.\n5.
