The absence of a well-\ndeveloped theoretical methodological foundation has given\nrise to various challenges within this field, such as not having\na standardized approach to define \"meditation\" (Awasthi,\n2013), an inability to make sense of different types of medi-\ntation practices, along with other challenges (Awasthi, 2013;\nresearch has explored the psychological and neuroscientific\nperspective, little work has investigated the underlying phil-\nosophical grounding of contemplative traditions.\nConsidering that much of the understanding and practice\nof meditation within psychology arose from dialogue with\nWhittingham, 2010; Lutz, Slagter, Dunne, & Davidson,\n2008), this article carefully explores an ancient model of the\nmind known as \"the five aggregates\" portrayed in Buddhist\nteachings.1 This model is explored as a potential theoretical\nresource that could guide meditation/mindfulness interven-\ntions.

Practical applications of the five-aggregate\nmodel are also presented.\nThe Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind\nThe five-aggregate model of the mind describes subjective\nconscious experience from a first-person perspective, and\nthis model has been recently described as a useful theoretical\nresource that could have promising new directions for inves-\ntigating the mind (Davis & Thompson, 2013). However, this\nmodel has not been critically examined to explore whether it\ncould facilitate our understanding of the mind and to con-\nsider its potential applications in meditation interventions.\nThe five aggregates are described as constituting the basic\nBodhi, 1995, p. 27).

The term sensory conscious-\nness in this context refers to being conscious of something,\nand constitutes experiencing a sensory stimulus (i.e., visual,\ntactile, olfactory, auditory, or taste), or being conscious of a\nthought (a thought concerning the past, present, or future).\nThe teachings describe that sensory consciousness2 can result\nin the generation of any of the other three aggregates, namely\nfeelings, perception, or volition (Analayo, 2006).\nThe five aggregates are also described in terms of \"internal\"\nand analyze not only the external world but also observe and\nanalyze the internal world that includes attempting to under-\nstand the structure/function of various organ systems of the\nhuman body. For example, studying the musculoskeletal system\nin detail happens as observations (sensory consciousness), fol-\nlowed by perception (aggregate of perception). Furthermore, in\nstudying and analyzing the brain, it is the mind that makes infer-\nences (aggregate of perception) in terms of how the brain works\nas the brain cannot talk for itself. The mind also thinks about\nourselves and about the mind itself (as we are doing right now).\nThe description of the aggregates is in agreement with\nresearch investigations that show mental phenomena can orig-\ninate as a result of an input from the five senses, or as a result\nof a thought (known as \"stimulus independent thoughts\")\nthat intrudes into a person's awareness unintentionally\nSmallwood & Schooler, 2006). A great deal of research shows\nthat the generation of mental phenomena (that follow sensory\nconsciousness) happens automatically, and their generation is\nalso influenced by individuals' previously conditioned atti-\ntudes and past associations (Bargh, 2014; Dijksterhuis &\nUnderstanding the \"Stream of\nConsciousness\"\nWilliam James (1890), the father of American psychology,\nreferred to the constant change and wandering that happens\nin the mind as the \"stream of consciousness.\" Considering\nthe above discussion, this \"stream\" would represent moment-\nto-moment changes that happen in conscious experience\nconsisting of the five aggregates.\nIn terms of first-person analysis of the here-and-now\nmoment, the present act of reading this article constitutes\nvisual sensory stimuli, followed by perception that under-\nstands the meaning of the words. As one reads this article,\ndepending on the reader's conditioned attitudes and views,\nvarious feelings may come up. Intruding thoughts (stimulus-\nindependent thoughts that could relate to the past or the\nfuture) may also momentarily arise and cease. Because of\nvolition, one may either read on or put the article aside, per-\nhaps to read later. Any thoughts of disagreement or doubt\nthat may arise based on the content presented in this article\nalso represent volition.3\nTable 1. The Five Aggregates and Their Descriptions With Examples.\nAggregate Description Example/s\n1. Material form Elementary componentsa that make up not\nonly the physical body but the external\nenvironment.\nAtoms and molecules that continuously move to and\nfrom the body.\n2. Feelings Subjective affective repercussions of an\nexperience.\nPleasant, unpleasant, or neutral feelings.\n3. Perception Being aware of attributes of an object or an\nevent.\nRecognizing the color of an object, its shape, size, or any\nother perceptions that result from analyzing the world,\nour material bodies or the mind.\n4. Volitionb Reactive or purposive aspects of the mind\nthat include intention as well as behavior.\nVolition can manifest as follows: (a) Bodily behavior\n(any activity), (b) Verbal behavior (speech, scolding,\netc.), (c) Psychological behavior (proliferating thoughts,\ncultivating thoughts of compassion, analyzing, practicing\nmindfulness, etc.).\n5. Sensory consciousnessc Being conscious of something. Knowing a sensory stimulus (visual, tactile, olfactory,\nauditory, or taste) or a thought (concerning the past,\npresent, or future).\nNote. The teachings describe that all experienced moments (aggregates) are impermanent, arising, and perishing from moment to moment (Analayo,\naElementary components in original teachings refer to solidity, liquidity, heat, and motion (Analayo, 2006; Bodhi, 1995).\nbThis aggregate is sometimes translated as \"mental formations\" (Bodhi, 1995, p. 27), as it represents a wide range of mental factors of which volition\nconstitutes the major factor. Volition is described as having a conditioning influence on the manifestation of the other aggregates (Analayo, 2006, p. 110;\ncSensory consciousness can result in the generation of any of the other three mind-related aggregates. The six different ways this can happen (via the\nfive senses or as a thought) are generally presented as \"the six senses\" in the Buddhist teachings (Analayo, 2006, p. 204; Bodhi, 1995, p. 27). Sensory\nconsciousness could also trigger mental proliferation, which represents a series of mental events.\nKarunamuni 3\nThe present moment is experienced as a sensory stimulus\nrelating to visual, tactile, olfactory, auditory, taste or as a\nstimulus-independent thought. However, the past and the\nfuture are experienced as thoughts in the present moment. A\nsense impression in the present moment (such as something\none hears) can come up as a mental phenomenon a few\nmoments later in the future (i.e., thinking about what was\nheard). These sense impressions and mental phenomena\ncome to pass one at a time (Shapiro, Arnell, & Raymond,\n1997). Studies have also shown that the ability to attend to\nmoment-to-moment changes of this fast-moving mind stream\nis enhanced with meditation and mindfulness training (Cahn,\nIn Buddhist traditions, first-person analysis of the five\naggregates is carried out with the goal of gaining deep insight\ninto experience and to investigate the nature of conscious-\nterms of the first aggregate, the material form, the teachings\nconsider the similarity between material elements that make\nup the material body and elements in the external environ-\nment where materials are continuously moving to and from\nConsciousness is understood in these traditions by directly\nattending to the constantly changing mind stream, a process\nthat necessitates carefully monitoring the moment-to-\nmoment changes that happen in subjective experience. To do\nthis, however, the mind has to be calm. The normal tendency\nof the mind is to continually leap from thought to thought\nSmallwood & Schooler, 2006), resulting in mental prolifera-\ntions where all types of associations concerning the past,\npresent, and future can arise.5 Focused attention meditation\npractice that involves directing attention on a chosen medita-\ntion object (such as the breath sensation or body sensations)\nhas the goal of calming the mind, reducing distractions\nopen monitoring meditation (where one is attentive moment\nby moment to anything that occurs in experience without\nfocusing on any explicit object) is used to gain insight into\nthe nature of experienced phenomena (Analayo, 2006; Lutz\ntion forms the basis for mindfulness practice (Lutz et al.,\n2008) that is described as a state of non-judgmental aware-\nness of the present moment (Kabat-Zinn, 2005).\nOne insight gained by investigating this way is that all\nexperienced moments are impermanent, arising, and perish-\nThe teachings explain that consciousness is in a dynamic\ncontinuum of constantly changing experience, where past\nphenomena continue to influence and condition the ever-\nEach experienced moment arises if causes and conditions are\nthere for it to come up at that moment. The commentaries of\nBuddhist teachings list five causal laws or factors that can\ninfluence how the aggregates arise in the present moment\n(Mahathera, 1933). These are physical laws, biological laws,\npsychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws. Of\nthese, the first three laws are familiar to science. Volitional laws\nrefer to the aggregate of volition, and this aggregate is described\nas having a conditioning influence on the manifestation of the\n1933). Universal laws refer to laws of nature, such as the\nimpermanence of everything.\nIt is useful to note that other religious/spiritual traditions\nalso engage in the practice of meditation where the mind's\nattention is often directed toward a single point of reference\nMethodologies of Neuroscience\nScientific investigations that continue to advance the quality\nof life of people utilize third-person methodologies to sys-\ntematically study the physical and natural world. Likewise,\nmethodologies of neuroscience that investigate neural acti-\nvation patterns and pathways in the brain increase our under-\nstanding of neurophysiological underpinnings of mental\nphenomena, and such knowledge can have various practical\napplications. Uncovering both state and trait neurophysio-\nlogical changes that occur in the brain as a result of medita-\ntion practice also continues to provide important evidence on\nthe practical use of meditation, especially in terms of its\npotential clinical applications (Braboszcz et al., 2010;\nApart from biological factors, it should be noted that\nnumerous other non-biological factors contribute to our sub-\njective experience in the present moment. Furthermore,\nwhen the five-aggregate model is applied to moment-to-\nmoment changes that happen in consciousness, third-person\nmethodologies also ultimately involve observations (aggre-\ngate of sensory consciousness), conducting experiments\n(aggregate of volition), drawing conclusions (aggregate of\nperception), as well as carrying out interventions (aggregate\nof volition) that happen within an individual's mind stream.\nNeurophysiological studies that indicate an individual's\nintention to engage in a specific task is initiated as cerebral\nactivity several seconds before it enters the individual's\nHe, Bode, & Haynes, 2013) can be used to further illustrate\nthe point addressed above. In these experiments, the brain\ncortex activity of a participant is monitored by a researcher,\nand a participant is asked to initiate an activity (such as\npressing a button or moving a finger) as soon as he or she\nfeels the urge to do so. In such an experiment, the first-per-\nson experience of the research participant and the researcher\ncan be analyzed separately, in terms of the moment-to-\nmoment changes that happen in the mind stream of each\nindividual. In the participant, when he or she was given\ninstructions to engage in the experimental task (auditory or\nvisual sensory stimuli), after the participant understood the\n4 SAGE Open\ninstructions (aggregate of perception), the intention to initiate\nthe activity (aggregate of volition) was automatically generated\nin his or her mind, which the participant was aware of. In terms\nof the researcher's mind stream, first there was planning fol-\nlowed by conducting the experiment (aggregate of volition).\nObserving the brain cortex activity of the participant happened\nnext (visual sensory stimuli), followed by conclusions\n(aggregate of perception) relating to the activity of the par-\nticipant's brain.\nTwo Levels of Analyses\nMethodologies used in neuroscience versus analyzing the\nconstantly changing mind stream can be conceptualized as\nrepresenting two different levels of analysis. The former typ-\nically involves third-person analyses (that often combine\ndata from large groups of individuals) and has the aim of\ngenerating practical knowledge. Attempting to understand\nthe constantly changing mind stream however involves anal-\nyses conducted from a first-person perspective.\nA distinction between phronesis and sophia proposed by\nAristotle (Trowbridge, 2011) is useful to conceptualize these\ntwo levels of analyses. Phronesis represents practical knowl-\nedge that is concerned with living well in the social world.\nMajor religions often refer to this level of analysis as relative\nof science currently operates at this level of analysis. Sophia,\nin contrast, involves a level of analysis referred to as \"tran-\nscendent wisdom\" that is acquired through meditation and\ncontemplation. This level of analysis is often referred to as\nultimate or absolute reality by major religions (Bodhi, 2006;\nIn Buddhist traditions, analysis of the five aggregates is\ncarried out with the ultimate aim of \"enlightenment,\" which\nis described as seeing things just as they are, unadulterated\nby habitual reactions and projections (Analayo, 2006, p. 60;\ntions focus on intuitive knowing of ultimate reality\nApplications of the Five-Aggregate\nModel of the Mind\nResearch studies have shown that rumination and excessive\nmental proliferation are significant transdiagnostic factors in\nthe manifestation of a variety of emotional disorders\n(Brosschot, Gerin, & Thayer, 2006; McLaughlin & Nolen-\npractice of meditation not only leads to reductions in rumina-\ntion and mental proliferation (Gu, Strauss, Bond, & Cavanagh,\nbrings about several psychological benefits, including reduc-\ntions in anxiety, depression, and stress (de Frias & Whyne,\npractice of meditation has also been found to be beneficial for\nphysical health (Carlson, 2012; Robins, Kiken, Holt, &\nand therefore these practices are useful to be incorporated\ninto ordinary individual's day-to-day living.\nConsidering that the five-aggregate model of the mind\nsystematically describes one's content of experience in the\npresent moment, this model is an especially useful and rele-\nvant theoretical resource to guide meditation interventions.\nThe five-aggregate model of the mind can also be helpful for\nindividuals who engage in meditation practices to become\nmore attuned to one's own emotional changes in daily living\nsituations, and may also enable one to gain self-understand-\ning as well as wisdom into human experience.\nIf the five-aggregate model is used to comprehend the\npresent moment, it is possible to recognize that each mental\nphenomenon arises as a result of sensory consciousness.\nBeing cognizant of this has practical utility, especially when\ndealing with unpleasant thoughts. For example, one can be\nattentive to sensory consciousness (i.e., triggers) that brings\nabout unpleasant mind states, and even be prepared to face\nsuch reactions with mindful awareness.\nIt is also useful to consider how the volition aggregate can\nhave a conditioning role on the manifestation of the other\naggregates (as described in the five-aggregate model). Let us\nconsider an individual who has an aggressive tendency, and\nassume that this person received an auditory sensory stimu-\nlus that he or she interpreted as an insult (aggregate of per-\nception). Then, an unpleasant feeling (aggregate of feeling)\nwould automatically arise in his or her mind stream, which\ncould lead to the arising of anger and aggressive behavior\n(aggregate of volition). Aggressive behavior could lead to\nmany unfavorable repercussions to the individual, including\nhaving to face accusations, regret, and even depression (these\nare possible examples of manifested aggregates in the mind\nstream of this individual). Now, suppose this person trained\nin mindfulness meditation (aggregate of volition). Then,\nwhen an auditory sensory stimulus arises, he or she would be\nable to maintain awareness countering the impulse toward\neither reaction or suppression, and thereby deactivating the\nemotional and attentional pull of anger. This example is sup-\nported by research evidence that has shown practicing mind-\nfulness meditation reduces mind wandering, anger, and\naggression (Rodriguez et al., 2014; Shonin, Van Gordon,\nabove two scenarios are analyzed, it was volition (reacting to\nanger vs. being mindful and letting go anger) that resulted in\nthe difference in outcome in the individual's mind stream.\nAs described in Buddhist teachings, volition itself can\ninfluence other volitional activities. For example, the cultiva-\ntion of patience, self-control (engaging in ethical behavior,\netc.) and nurturing positive emotions such as compassion and\nforgiveness are described as supporting the progress of medi-\nAfter a period of systematic meditation practice, individu-\nals can observe the impermanence of all thoughts. This is\nillustrated in an intervention that targeted marginalized\nKarunamuni 5\nwomen with histories of trauma and was dealing with sub-\nstance abuse issues (Vallejo & Amaro, 2009). The study\nreports that following a mindfulness-based intervention,\nthese women were able to witness their own thoughts objec-\ntively without having to act on them, which is particularly\nuseful in working with impulse control when a craving\narises. One participant of this study described how she was\nable to watch distressing thoughts as passing clouds that\nThere is a substantial knowledge base on various neural\nstructures in the brain that are associated with healthy mental\nfunctioning (National Institute of Mental Health, 2005), as\nwell as an accumulating body of evidence that show medita-\ntion training brings about favorable changes in important neu-\n2013). Therefore, neuroscientific investigations of meditation\npractice can continue to play a role in both primary and sec-\nondary prevention of mental disorders. In addition, recent\nresearch has shown the feasibility of using real-time func-\ntional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) to link mea-\nsures of brain activity with reports of ongoing subjective\nRt-fMRI investigations may enable one to examine how the\nfive-aggregate model operates neurologically in real time,\nand such investigations may have practical applications. One\nrt-fMRI investigation that linked measures of brain activity\nwith reports of ongoing subjective experience showed that\nmeditators, but not non-meditators, were able to manipulate a\nfeedback graph volitionally (by focusing on their breath sen-\nsation), and this was associated with significant deactivation\nin the posterior cingulate cortex (the hub of the default mode\nnetwork that is linked to mental proliferation) in meditators\nbut not non-meditators (Garrison et al., 2013).\nSummary and Conclusion\nNumerous scientists have stated that the entire outside world\nis experienced within the brain.7 However, as explained in\nthis article, the brain is also analyzed within the mind's\nstream of experience. The mind stream of each individual is\nconstantly changing. In the Buddhist practice, it is this mind\nstream itself that is extensively investigated and analyzed\nfrom a first-person perspective. As described in the five-\naggregate model, the moment-to-moment manifestation of\nthe mind constitutes feelings, perception, volition, and sen-\nsory consciousness.\nAlthough scientific interest in meditation reflects a recent\nshift in cognitive science toward viewing first-person experi-\nence of participants as a valuable object of scientific investiga-\ntion (Braboszcz et al., 2010), there appears to be confusion in\nterms of clearly separating first-person and third-person analy-\nses due to the lack of understanding of meditation in the origi-\nnating traditions. Research in neuroscience uncovers various\nassociations between mental phenomena and neural activation\npatterns. Such investigations increase our understanding of\nbiological factors associated with mental phenomena and also\nprovide important evidence on the practical utility of medita-\ntion. When considering the moment-by-moment manifesta-\ntion of the mind, however, these investigations also represent\nobservations (sensory consciousness), followed by thoughts\n(perception) that happen within an individual's mind stream.\nConsidering that the five-aggregate model comprehen-\nsively describes the moment-to-moment changes that happen\nin the mind stream, it not only provides a guideline for medi-\ntation/mindfulness interventions and research but it could\nalso be helpful in instructing and teaching mindfulness.\n"
