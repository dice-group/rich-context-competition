    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe era of Big Data comes with the omnipresent metaphor of the Cloud, a term suggesting an ephemeral and seemingly\nendless storage space, unhindered by time and place. Similar to the satellite image of the Whole Earth, which was the\nicon of technological progress in the late 60s, the Cloud as a metaphor breathes the promise of technology, whilst\nobfuscating the hardware reality of server farms and software infrastructure necessary to enable the proliferation of (big)\ndata. This article presents projects from the fields of humanities, social sciences and the arts that formulate a response to\nBig Data and its human and automated practices, from data analytics dashboards to critical reflections on smart\ntechnologies and objects.\n",

A famous artwork from that era is Charles\nand Ray Eames's prophetic film, `Rough sketch for a proposed film dealing with the powers of ten and the relative\nsize of things in the universe' (1968), an interstellar roller-coaster ride by means of a vertiginous zoom that\ntraverses molecular, human, and cosmic planes. The film features a wide shot of the earth, which had been so\nardently campaigned for by Stewart Brand two years earlier. Brand, inspired by Buckminster Fuller's call for\nbetter depictions of the round earth, strove to convince NASA and the Russians to use their satellite photography\ntechnology to ``finally turn the cameras backward'' towards the earth (Brand, 1976; Leonard, 2003). He printed a\nfew hundred buttons and posters with the question, ``Why haven't we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?''\n(see Figure 1), which he sent to NASA and US government officials and sold personally on the campuses of the\nUniversity of California Berkeley, Stanford, Harvard, and MIT. Stewart Brand later became famous for his\nmonumental `Whole Earth Catalog,' the seminal 1968 book of do-it-yourself (DIY) counterculture that offered\ndescriptive and instructional entries on all varieties of eco- and techno-futurist practices, from organic farming and\nwind power generation, to desktop publishing and electronic synthesizers. Steve Jobs would later refer to the\n`Whole Earth Catalog' as a paperback Google, existing 35 years before the search engine came into existence\n1Faculty of Digital Media and Creative Industries, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Amsterdam, the Netherlands\n2Department of Interactive Media Design, Royal Academy of Arts, The Hague, the Netherlands\nCorresponding author:\nSabine Niederer, Faculty of Digital Media and Creative Industries, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Rhijnspoorplein 1, Amsterdam 1091 GC,\nthe Netherlands.\nEmail: s.m.c.niederer@hva.nl\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons NonCommercial-NoDerivs CC-BY-NC-ND: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Com-\nmons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) which permits\nnon-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work as published without adaptation or alteration, without further permission provided the\noriginal work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n(Dirksen, 2012). The catalog's first issue (1968) was adorned with that seminal photograph of the whole earth, seen\nfrom space.\nOnce a novelty, this view of the earth has been widespread over the decades, and further mainstreamed in the\n2000s by the visual characteristics of Google Earth and Google Maps. These applications have similarly sparked a\nwide variety of artistic and scholarly responses, varying from adding data layers (Parks, 2009; United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum, 2009), to visual explorations of anomalies in `texture mapping' (Valla, 2012)\nand festive live renditions of the now common `tiled' map imagery (Moniker, 2011). The earth as seen from\nouter space today may still function as a techno-historical perspective on contemporary visual and political\nframes of scalability and technological innovation, developed in the realm of science and the arts, and inspired\nby the current proliferation of data.\nIts present-day equivalent, the visual and textual symbol of the era Big Data, is not a victorious lens on the\nworld, but rather takes shape in the ephemeral image of `the Cloud.' The Cloud is a metaphor for a seemingly\nendless storage space, unhindered by boundaries of time and place. As such, it is also a euphemism that obfuscates\nthe ``planetary-scale'' of the hardware and software infrastructures that are necessary to deal with omnipresent\ndata collection and perpetual computer connectivity (Metahaven, 2012). The research projects and art works\npresented here provide novel responses, directly and implicitly, to the era of Big Data and its human and auto-\nmated practices such as crowdsourcing and data analytics.\nBehind the scenes of websites and platforms\nBy lifting up the polished interfaces of our everyday technology, research and software projects such as\nContropedia (2014) and Floodwatch (2014) provide behind-the-scenes views of everyday web destinations. With\nrespect to Contropedia, an online encyclopedia is an unlikely place to go looking for controversies. The\nFigure 1. Campaign button, 1967, by Stewart Brand. Urging NASA and the Soviet Union to release a photograph of the whole earth\n(Brand, 1967). Courtesy of Stewart Brand.\n2 Big Data & Society\ncollaboratively authored encyclopedia project Wikipedia, however, offering the complete editing history and talk\npage for each article, provides views of collaborative knowledge production. With these openly accessible history\ntabs and discussion pages, and furthermore its intricate administrative systems of editing policy, software robots\nand tool-assisted humans (Geiger, 2010; Niederer & Van Dijck, 2010), it is a place and platform par excellence to\nmap conflict and controversy dynamics.\nResearchers, programmers, and designers of four universities working together in the context of an EU-funded\nproject Electronic Maps to Assist Public Science (EMAPS) have created Contropedia, an analytical platform that\noffers novel visual analyses of the instances and objects of contestation within Wikipedia articles (see Figure 2).\nTheir key orientation towards these inquiries and their utility is that conflicts on Wikipedia ``often reflect larger\nsocietal debates'' (Borra et al., 2015).\nContropedia, presently developed for both the public and specific users such as scientists and decision-\nmakers, aims to extract such social controversies from Wikipedia and provide new insights into these through\nvisualization tools. Building its metrics on those of Wikipedia itself, and combining real-time data about editing\nand discussion activity, ``Contropedia,'' its founders assert, ``will allow for a deeper understanding of the sub-\nstance, composition, actor alignment, trajectory and liveliness of controversies on Wikipedia'' (Barcelona Media\nWhere Contropedia reveals the contentious dynamics of collaborative knowledge production which are hidden\nbehind the article view of Wikipedia, the browser extension Floodwatch (Figure 3) identifies and documents the\nusually invisible algorithmic dynamics that direct the advertisement selection during the split-second when you open\na website. The browser extension, with its tagline ``You are not your browser history!,'' collects all advertisements\nserved to you when surfing the Internet and then donates this data to researchers analyzing ad targeting. The\nresearchers aim to create the largest available dataset on advertising, to ``increas[e] awareness of how advertisers\ntrack your browsing behavior, build their version of your online identity, and target their ads to you as an\nindividual'' (Office for Creative Research and Soltani, 2015).\nFigure 2.

Courtesy of\nNiederer and Taudin Chabot 3\nSimilar views are provided by Ghostery, an anti-tracker browser plug-in that shows the alarming amount of\nactivity taking place behind the scenes of a website visit, offering you also the opportunity to read about these\ncompanies and decide whether you wish to block (a selection of) these newly identified, `invisible' tracers and\ntrackers (Ghostery.com). The publicly available Tracker Tracker tool by the Digital Methods Initiative\n(Amsterdam), which is built on top of Ghostery, aims to render visible parts of the cloud, expanding its view\nfrom ad servers to include widgets, social plug-ins, and other ``cloud technology'' (Digital Methods Initiative,\n2013; Martijn, 2013). Enter up to 100 websites into the tool and receive a list of all the little pieces of software\nloading in the websites.\nVisual analytics of platform content\nThe images created and uploaded to the web by individuals account for innumerable quantities of files added daily\ninto global circulation. With the rise of photography-driven platforms beyond Flickr, such as social media plat-\nforms Instagram and Pinterest, visual blogging platform Tumblr, and (Facebook) profile picture-based dating app\nTinder, the new self-portrait (the `selfie') is increasingly an object of scientific analysis and critique (Keenan and\nManovich et al. (2014) explores such an approach to this new photographic genre, and presents a comparative\nvisual analytics of selfies in five different cities across the world.\nSelfiecity is a visual analytics platform for selfies, which analyses a total of 3200 Instagram selfies from New\nYork, Moscow, Berlin, Bangkok, and Sao Paulo. The aim of the project is to systematically investigate patterns in\nselfie collections, on a demographic (do only young women take selfies?) and aesthetic level (e.g. how to pose and\nmake facial expressions). Selfiecity also presents visualizations of its findings (yes, men take selfies too, but the\nmajority is taken by women), called `Imageplots' (Figure 4). The `Theory' section of the platform is dedicated to\nessays about photography and the self-portrait in particular. Lastly, an interactive dashboard called\n`Selfiexploratory' offers the possibility to explore, re-order, and sort the collection through its various rankings\nand filters.\nFigure 3.

This fading of the boundaries between the animate and inanimate leads him to paint a world of\ntechno-animism conceptualized further for an exhibition proposal, which he made available on YouTube. At first\nglance, the video sketch `A proposal for a show' could be described as an eerie preview of a near-future Internet of\nthings, in which ``phones speak back, refrigerators suggest recipes, and websites seem to predict what we want''\n(Leckey, 2009). However, the exhibition's themes and concerns resonate far beyond this single concept, as the\nproject puts forward a monumental network of relationships and cross-references by juxtaposing artworks and\nartifacts culled from the gamut of history (Smith, 2013). A Soviet dog space suit and a `Singing Gargoyle' are\nshown together with a replica of William Blake's death mask and a Cyberman helmet from `Doctor Who,' drawing\nanalogies between the transformation of technical objects into communicators towards the realm of totemism. In\nconclusion of the exhibition in Brussels in January 2015, Leckey decided to xerox the whole project, resulting in\n`UniAddDum,' a collection of assorted 3D printed copies, 2D cardboard cut-outs, photographic reproductions\nand other forms all duplicating the original exhibit. In an assertedly pop manner he calls these objects ``dupes,''\nand presents them as an ``exhibition within an exhibition'' (Leckey, 2010).\nThe quantified event\nIn contrast with these playful duplicates stands the repetitive imagery presented in the installation `Deep Play.' The\ninstallation by the German artist Harun Farocki (1944\u00ad2014) consists of 12 different perspectives (each with its\ndedicated screen) of the 2006 `Italy vs France' Fifa World Cup soccer final in Germany, which was watched by\napproximately 1.5 billion viewers simultaneously (Farocki, 2008). The 12 screens meticulously deconstruct and\nreconstruct this mass media event. On one screen we see the game as it is broadcasted. On others we see live feeds\nfrom different angles and spaces in the stadium streamed in sync with the game, showing bored guards, corridors,\nback-rooms, parking lots, vexed coaches, 2D and 3D graphs, vector charts, and animation sequences. Layers\nof quantified data including distances and speeds of runs by the players, percentages of each team's ball posses-\nsion, number of shots taken--in fact every conceivable element of the match--are concurrently being analyzed\n(Figure 7) and broadcast simultaneously.\nFarocki is known for his documentary non-narrative audiovisual essays on the politics of imagery, in which he\ninterrogates institutions such as cinema and television (often with a rather dry, Brechtian voice-over).\nFigure 4.

A ten-minute\n6 Big Data & Society\nHis installation `Deep Play' inundates the viewer with a network of (played back) real-time data and imagery. This\nscreen architecture effectuates the removal of the viewer of the game, and instead turns our attention to the\napparatus that mediates the action, quantifies the process, and shapes our perception.\nRepetition and modulation of war stories\nArtist Omer Fast in his work addresses similar issues with the mediation of events, in his case related to the\nconventions of journalism, where he investigates the stability of the structures of narration and storytelling. In\nmultiple works he questions the propensity for converting traumatic and violent events into easily digestible media\nbytes. The short film `5,000 feet is the best' (Figure 7) is based on conversations that the artist had with a former\nPredator Drone operator (Fast, 2011). In this and other works, Fast interrogates conducting war at a distance,\nincluding the psychological effects on its operators and spectators.\nThe work is shown as an endless loop; however, the repeating parts are not symmetrical and instead seem\nconstantly modified. An example is the reversal he creates of the American occupation of Iraq, portraying an\nAmerican family navigating through checkpoints of a seemingly Chinese occupying army. The effect is unnerving\nas all the key visual elements like the car and the environment are typically American. In `5,000 feet is the best,'\nFast delves into the trauma of the drone operator but also exposes the possible delusions of language and images\nand their related degrees of interpretation.\nConclusions\nWhere the cloud--just like the image of the `whole earth'--functions as an optimistic symbol of technological\nprogress, the aforementioned projects offer critical assessments of this big data phenomenon and its associated\npractices. As Steward Brand's present-day activist (and hippie) counterpart, Jaron Lanier, writes in the preface to\nhis manifesto `You are not a gadget':\nIt's early in the twenty-first century, and that means that these words will mostly be read by nonpersons (. . .). The words\nwill be minced into atomized search engine keywords within industrial cloud computing facilities located in remote, often\nFigure 7.

They will be copied millions of times by algorithms designed to send an advertisement\nto some person somewhere who happens to resonate with some fragment of what I say. (2010: iv)\nAnalytical interfaces on platforms and data collections show the individual and collaborative dynamics of\ncontent as well as their formal features. Autonomous art projects provide critical views on smart technologies\nin domestic or global settings, ranging in the examples here from smart home appliances to drone warfare. In an\nera that produces content mostly for machines, to paraphrase Lanier, such analytical and aesthetic views offer a\nmuch-needed close reading of the data universe we both create and inhabit.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\nBarcelona Media, SciencesPo Me\n\u00b4 dialab, Digital Methods Initiative and DensityDesign (2014) Contropedia, Online Tool.\nAvailable at: http://www.contropedia.net\nBorra E, Weltevrede E, Ciuccarelli P, et al.
