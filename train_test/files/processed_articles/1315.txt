Non-fatal injury data from a special study of the\n2004 NEISS\u00adAIP were analysed which allowed up to five\ninjuries to be coded per case. National estimates of\nnumber and rate of injuries for 2004 were calculated, first\nusing principal injuries alone, then by including principal\nand secondary injuries.\nmotor vehicle occupants involved in a crash and treated in\nUS hospital emergency departments (EDs) in 2004. This\nrepresents a 67% increase in the total number of injuries\ncompared with an estimate of principal injury alone.\nIncidence of contusions/abrasions and lower trunk injuries\nrose most steeply among broad injury types, and whiplash\ninjury rose 18% in number and rate. A significantly lower\npercentage of cases with a single listed injury were\nhospitalised (5%) compared with those who sustained\nmultiple injuries (8%).\nConclusions: Based on an analysis of NEISS\u00adAIP special\nstudy data, the inclusion of both principal and secondary\ninjuries in national estimates of motor vehicle-related\noccupant injury would provide a more comprehensive report\nof non-fatal injuries treated in US hospital EDs. Other\ncountries with ED-based surveillance systems could consider\nreporting multiple injuries when assessing injury count\nassociated with motor vehicle trauma requiring ED care.\nMotor vehicle-related trauma is the leading cause\nof injury-related death and the fourth leading cause\nof non-fatal injury treated in hospital emergency\ndepartments (EDs) in the United States.1 2 This\nhigh degree of mortality and morbidity is partly\nattributable to the powerful kinetic forces often\ninvolved in motor vehicle crashes, in which multi-\nple serious injuries to a crash victim can often\noccur. Each separate injury suffered by a crash\nvictim requires time, money and ED resources for\nits care, and each therefore should contribute to\nthe overall count of injury attributable to motor\nvehicle-related trauma. Not all injury surveillance\nsystems, however, recognise multiple injuries per\nperson when calculating injury estimates. In many\nsystems, a principal diagnosis of injury serves not\nonly as the key inclusion criterion, but also as the\nsole injury utilised when calculating national esti-\nmates of total injury.3 This method could lead to a\nsubstantial underestimate of injury count in terms of\ntotal treated injuries, particularly when applied to\nthe study of motor vehicle-related trauma. An\nexample of such a system is the National Electronic\nInjury Surveillance System\u00adAll Injury Program, or\nNEISS\u00adAIP. This surveillance system has been used\nextensively to describe national estimates of non-\nfatal injuries in the United States for all causes and\nhas provided timely information about emerging\ninjuries related to consumer products.2 4 5 Although\nNEISS\u00adAIP collects valuable information on the\ndemographics, principal injury and disposition of\nincident cases of injury requiring emergency care\naround the country, secondary injuries are recorded\nonly in a short narrative section, at the discretion of\nthe coder, and remain uncoded.6 The purpose of this\nstudy was to examine the effect of routinely coding\nsecondary injuries in the NEISS\u00adAIP for inclusion\ninto national estimates of injury. This could allow\nnot only for a more comprehensive portrayal of\ninjury count, but also for a more accurate portrayal\nof national injury rates due to the inclusion of\nincident injuries identified among secondary diag-\nnoses. The value of coding multiple injuries is then\nfurther demonstrated by distinguishing persons with\nmultiple injuries from those with an isolated injury,\nand demonstrating how these two types of injury\ncases differ by ED discharge disposition.\nMETHODS\nNEISS\u00adAIP database\nThe NEISS\u00adAIP, maintained and operated by the US\nConsumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), is a\nnationwide probability sample of 63 hospitals used to\nmonitor injury-related visits at US hospital EDs.7\nParticipating hospitals are selected from five strata,\nfour of which are based on size (total ED visits) and\none other which represents children's hospitals. The\nsample is nationally representative, and cases are\nweighted by the inverse probability of selection, so\nthat national estimates of injury can be calculated,\nbased on initial visits for a given cause of injury. Data\nroutinely collected via the NEISS\u00adAIP include the\nbasic demographics of the case (including age, sex and\nrace), information about the cause of the injury\n(including the event, location, intent, mechanism and\nconsumer product involved), and medical informa-\ntion abstracted from the ED chart, such as the\nprincipal diagnosis, principal body region affected,\nand ED discharge disposition. CPSC classifies injury\nusing a unique system that separately codes diagnosis\n(eg, fracture) and body region (eg, head).6\nMethodologic issues\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nSpecial study data collection and subject selection (1 January\nA stratified random sample of 15 hospitals (three per stratum)\nwas selected from the 50 NEISS\u00adAIP hospitals which agreed to\nparticipate in the special study. In addition to routinely\ncollected data, a special screen in the data acquisition software\nrequired a NEISS coder to record up to four secondary injury\ndiagnoses per person (and their respective affected body\nregions), and to order these injury diagnoses as listed by the\ntreating physician. The special screen was triggered when the\ninjured person was identified as a ``motor vehicle occupant''\ninvolved in a collision, rollover, crash or some other event\ninvolving another vehicle or object.6 The type of motor vehicle\ninvolved in the crash could include cars, pickup trucks, vans,\nheavy transport vehicles, buses and SUVs, but did not include\nsmall recreational vehicles, such as motorcycles, ATVs, snow-\nmobiles and go-carts. This study was approved by CDC's\nInstitutional Review Board.\nClassification of injuries\nEach separate injury was assigned a number by its listing in the\nED record (first listed injury through fifth listed injury), and\nthese were then grouped into two categories: principal injuries\n(first-listed injury), and secondary injuries (second through\nfifth-listed injuries). Injury count was then calculated in two\nways: first by summing all principal injuries (total principal\ninjuries), and second by summing principal and secondary\ninjuries (total multiple injuries).\nCalculation of injury rates\nTo produce stable estimates, NEISS\u00adAIP injury categories for\ndiagnosis and body region were combined into five broad\ndiagnosis categories and seven broad body region categories. For\neach category, an incident case (person) was identified in two\nways: first by whether a given injury type had been listed as the\nprincipal injury for that person, and second by whether a given\ninjury type had been listed among any of the five possibly listed\ninjuries for that person. Due to the broad injury categories used\nin this study, a person could often have more than one injury of\na certain type listed among their multiple injuries. For example,\na sprain/strain injury could occur as both the first-listed and\nthird-listed injury treated in the ED for a given person. As fig 1\nshows, such a person would contribute two sprain/strain\ninjuries to the overall count of sprain/strain injury, but would\ncontribute only one case of sprain/strain injury to the incidence\nof sprain/strain.\nDefinitions of whiplash and traumatic brain injury\nSprain/strain injuries to the neck were used to define whiplash\ninjuries, while traumatic brain injury (TBI) was defined by\ncombining concussions and internal organ injuries of the head.\nAlthough these NEISS\u00adAIP codes can serve only as a proxy for a\nmore specific diagnosis, this technique has been used in past\nstudies to identify and study whiplash injury and TBI within\nNEISS\u00adAIP datasets.8 9\nCalculation of national estimates\nNational estimates were generated using SAS and SUDAAN\nsoftware. Each injury was assigned its own weight, based on the\ninverse probability of the selection of the hospital at which\nthe injured person was treated. National estimates were\ncalculated by summing the weights for each separate injury,\nand 95% CIs around estimates were calculated using a direct\nvariance estimation procedure that accounted for the sample\nweights and the complex sample design.10 For annual rate\nobtained from US Census Bureau bridged-race population\nTo verify that the sample of 15 hospitals from this special\nstudy could produce national estimates comparable to the full\nNEISS sample of 63 hospitals, demographic characteristics of\nthe two samples were compared and found to be similar. As\nexpected, the coefficients of variation for national estimates\nderived from this pilot study were greater than those for the full\n2004 dataset. Most national estimates and rates presented in the\ntables had coefficients of variation (CV) less than 30 and were\nconsidered to be reliable. However, a few estimates and rates\nhad CVs just above 30 and therefore are reported as possibly\nunreliable, likely due to the relatively small number of NEISS\nhospitals participating in this special study.\nComparison of persons with multiple versus isolated injury\nA person treated for ``multiple injuries'' was defined as one in\nwhich two or more injuries were listed in the ED record, while\nthose with only one listed injury were labelled as having an\n``isolated injury''. These two categories were compared by sex,\nage and disposition. x2 Tests were applied to test for statistically\nsignificant differences between proportions of the two groups.12\nRESULTS\nTable 1 compares the total number of principal injuries to the\ntotal number of multiple injuries, with results stratified by\ndiagnosis and body region. Total injury count attributable to\nmotor vehicle-related trauma increased 67% when calculated as\nthe sum of all listed injuries in the ED record. Contusions/\nabrasions and lacerations/avulsions were associated with the\ngreatest increases in count (110% and 62%), while fractures/\ndislocations rose 39%. Extremity injuries and lower trunk\ninjuries accounted for the greatest increases among body regions\n(122% and 113%), while the head and neck showed the smallest\nincreases in count (36% and 21%). In terms of more specific\ninjuries, an 18% increase in whiplash injury count was identified,\nas well as an 11% increase in the unweighted number of TBI\ninjuries. (Due to the small sample size, the increase for TBI\ninjuries could only be calculated using unweighted numbers.)\nTable 2 presents diagnosis-specific and body-region specific\ninjury rates. Contusions/abrasions showed the greatest increase\nin rate ratio by diagnoses (rate ratio = 1.61), while the lower\ntrunk region showed the greatest increase by body region (rate\nratio = 2.08). The rate for whiplash injury rose by a factor of\nTable 3 illustrates the distribution of individual injuries by\ntheir listing in the ED record. It shows that the first two listed\ninjuries account for nearly 90% of total injury count, with the\nsecond-listed injury alone accounting for 70% of the total\nsecondary injury count (ie, 2nd through 5th listed injuries).\nIn table 4, persons with multiple injury are compared to those\nwith isolated injury by sex, age and disposition. Nearly half\n(46%) of all persons in the database were treated in the ED for at\nleast two injuries. The larger proportion of both multiple injury\npatients and isolated injury patients were female. Those in the\n0\u00ad14 year-old age group were twice as likely to be treated for\nisolated injuries as for multiple injuries. Persons with multiple\ninjuries were significantly more likely to be hospitalised than\nthose with isolated injuries (8% vs 5% hospitalisation percen-\nMethodologic issues\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nDISCUSSION\nfor non-fatal injuries resulting from motor vehicle-related\ntrauma in the United States in 2004, they sustained a total of\ndescribes ED-treated injury count in terms of the number of\npersons injured (based on principal injuries alone), this study\nshows that total ED-treated injury count due to motor vehicle-\nrelated trauma would increase 67% by recognising and including\nup to five treated injuries per person.

This substantial increase in injury count and injury\nrates could have important implications when studying such\nissues as the cost of ED care, ED resource allocation, and the time\nrequired to treat motor vehicle trauma victims in the ED.\nAll diagnosis and body region categories incurred substantial\nincreases in total count with the addition of secondary injuries;\nhowever, these increases were not evenly distributed to all\ncategories in terms of relative frequency. While the rank order of\ndiagnosis types remained unchanged, the addition of secondary\ninjuries did change the relative frequency of injuries to certain\nbody regions, with extremity and lower trunk injuries rising in\nrelative rank order of frequency. Because the diagnosis\ncategories were very broad, a more specific injury was also\nchosen for further study. Whiplash has been cited as the single\nmost common non-fatal injury diagnosis listed by ED physi-\ncians in the United States.8 While its severity may vary\nconsiderably, whiplash is typically considered to be relatively\nminor in nature, and may often be listed by ED physicians as a\nsecondary injury for crash victims who were treated for\nmultiple injuries in the ED. As a result, whiplash is particularly\nprone to being underestimated by ED surveillance systems, such\nas the NEISS\u00adAIP, which include only the principal diagnosis in\ninjury estimates. In one study using NEISS\u00adAIP data, Quinlan et\ntreated in US EDs for whiplash injuries during the year 2000.\nwith a principal diagnosis of whiplash due to motor vehicle\ncrash injury in 2004, after including both principal and\nsecondary injuries, we estimated that the number of people\nThis suggests that the NEISS\u00adAIP may underestimate national\nwhiplash injury count by as much as 18%, which could have\nimportant implications for preventive measures which are based\non these estimates.\nThe inclusion of multiple injuries per person not only led to a\nsubstantial increase in the total number of injuries treated, but\nalso to an increase in diagnosis-specific and body region-specific\ninjury rates. This was not due to an increase in the total number\nof people injured in crashes overall, but instead to an\nidentification of new incident cases of injury found by utilising\nthe secondary injuries when determining incidence. It is\nnecessary to keep in mind that by recognising multiple injuries\nper person, it becomes possible for one person to contribute an\nTable 2 Unweighted and weighted number of incident cases of injury (persons) and associated rates;\ncomparison using principal and multiple injury incident cases\nCharacteristics\nUnweighted\nprincipal\ninjury\nincident\ncases\nWeighted\nprincipal\ninjury\nincident\ncases\nPrincipal\ninjury rate\n(per\npersons)\nUnweighted\nmultiple\ninjury\nincident\ncases\nWeighted\nmultiple\ninjury\nincident\ncases\nMultiple\ninjury rate\npersons Rate ratio\nDiagnosis\nBody region\nSpecific injury\n*The ``other'' diagnosis category includes internal organ injury and concussion.\nTable 3 Distribution of injuries by their listing in the emergency\ndepartment record\nInjury type\nDiagnosis\nlisting\nUnweighted\ninjuries\n% of total\ninjury\n% of total\nsecondary\ninjury\nTable 4 Distribution of sex, age and disposition for persons with\nmultiple injury versus isolated injury, 2004\nCharacteristic Multiple injury Isolated injury p Value\nSex\nAge (years)\nDisposition\n``Multiple injury'' is defined as a person who was treated for two or more injuries in the\nED record.\nMethodologic issues\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nincident injury to more than one diagnosis and body region.\nWhile at least one other study in the literature has demon-\nstrated an increase in the number of total injuries found by\nincluding multiple injuries in an injury surveillance system,13 no\nprevious study has utilised multiple injuries to identify new\nincident cases of diagnosis-specific and body-region specific\ninjury, and then use these to calculate revised diagnosis and\nbody region specific rates. We found that by body region, the\nnumber of persons with lower trunk injury rose most steeply,\nwith the rate of lower trunk injury doubling in comparison to\nprincipal lower trunk injuries alone. Furthermore, by diagnosis\ncategory, the number of persons with a diagnosis of contusion/\nabrasion increased the most relative to other diagnosis\ncategories, leading to a rate ratio of 1.6 compared to principal\ncontusion/abrasion injuries alone.\nAlthough up to five possible injuries per motor vehicle crash\nvictim were recognised in this study, the majority of total injury\ncount was recorded among the first two listed injuries. The sum\nof the first two listed injuries among all crash victims accounted\nfor 90% of the total injury count apparent among all five listed\ninjuries. These results suggest that by coding one additional\ninjury per case (principal or first-listed plus the second-listed\ninjury), the NEISS\u00adAIP could capture the majority of the motor\nvehicle-related injuries treated in the ED. Such a technique\nwould also prove useful considering the new case definition of\ninjury which has recently been recommended for national and\nstate injury surveillance systems which use hospital ED data.14\nThis new broadened definition includes injuries based on the\nfirst-listed diagnosis code or the first-listed external cause of\ninjury code, which could occur among any of the listed\ndiagnoses.14 Using this new definition and counting both the\nprincipal diagnosis (first-listed) and the second-listed diagnosis\nfor injury cases may provide a more complete assessment of the\ntotal number and rate of injuries in the population of interest as\na measure of injury count, while preserving the epidemiological\nintegrity of the data.\nIn this study, the inclusion of multiple injuries per case led\nnot only to a more comprehensive portrayal of count and rate of\ninjuries, but also allowed us to distinguish people with multiple\ninjuries from those with an isolated injury treated in the ED. We\nfound that persons treated for multiple injuries in the ED were\nsignificantly more likely to be hospitalised than those with an\nisolated injury, with hospitalisation percentages of 8% and 5%,\nrespectively (p,0.001). The ability to distinguish between\npeople with multiple and isolated injuries may be important\nwhen studying other outcome indices or patient populations.\nFor instance, the relationship between multiple injury and\nclinical outcome has been well studied among hospitalised\ndistinguishing multiple from isolated injury cases allowed a\nmore precise characterisation of the need for ICU care, as well as\nfor predicting mortality.13 In that study, although 22.5% of all\ntrauma patients with a principal injury to the head required\nICU care, this figure dropped to 13% for those whose head\ninjury was their only listed injury. Similarly, whereas 5.8% of all\ntrauma patients with a principal injury to the head died while\nreceiving hospital care, this figure dropped to 3.1% for those\nwith isolated head injuries.\nThe findings of this pilot study are subject to several\nlimitations, one of which is inherent to the small size of a pilot\nstudy. First, due to the small sample size and the stratified\nprobability sample design, national estimates of the number and\nrate of injuries for very specific injury types (other than\nwhiplash) were unreliable and not reported. Even when utilising\nvery broad injury sub-categories, a number of national estimates\nfor these sub-categories were unreliable and, therefore, not\nreported. Second, this sample was a stratified random sample\nfrom 50 of 63 NEISS\u00adAIP hospitals that agreed to participate.\nWhile the distribution of demographic characteristics of\npatients in our 15 NEISS\u00adAIP hospital subsample were similar\nto those in the full 63 NEISS\u00adAIP sample, it is possible that our\nsubsample differed in some unmeasured characteristics relevant\nto risk of multiple injuries, such as those associated with\nseverity of the crash (eg, speed at impact). Third, NEISS\u00adAIP\ncoders were trained to record ED discharge diagnoses in the\norder as listed in the ED record. While ED physicians typically\norder diagnoses in declining order of severity, physicians may\nuse different criteria for determining severity, and may vary in\nterms of the types of injury they choose to list in the ED record.\nFinally, this study was limited to motor vehicle-related trauma\ntreated in an ED setting; therefore, the findings may or may not\nbe relevant when counting multiple injuries per case associated\nwith other external causes of injury or in other treatment\nsettings.\nCONCLUSION\nMultiple injuries requiring emergency care are common among\npersons treated in the ED for motor vehicle-related trauma. In\nthis study, we have described the added number and increased\nrate of non-fatal injury that would be reported by a national\nsurveillance system of ED-treated injury if multiple injuries per\ncrash victim were included in national estimates. Although the\nunderlying relative distribution of injuries was largely unaf-\nfected by the addition of secondary injuries, this study has\ndemonstrated that the inclusion of secondary injuries allows for\na more comprehensive portrayal of the total count and rate of\nWhat is already known on this subject\nc With more than 2.6 million people treated in US hospital\nemergency departments in 2007, motor vehicle traffic\noccupant injury was the fourth leading cause for US hospital\nemergency department visits for non-fatal injury.\nc Many of these injured persons were treated for multiple\ninjuries, yet multiple injuries are not accounted for when\ndetermining national estimates of injury count by the NEISS\u00ad\nAIP. This study examines and compares the national injury\ncount determined by accounting for a single injury per person\nversus accounting for any multiple injuries.\nWhat this study adds\nc National motor vehicle occupant injury count rose 67% with\nthe inclusion of both principal and secondary injuries in\nnational estimates, and 90% of total injury count was captured\nby the first two listed diagnoses for each crash victim.\nc Rate of contusions/abrasions and lower trunk injuries rose\nmost steeply among broad injury types, and rate of whiplash\nc A significantly lower percentage of cases with a single listed\ninjury were hospitalised (5%) compared with those who\nsustained multiple injuries (8%).\nMethodologic issues\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\ninjury attributable to motor vehicle-related trauma treated in\nEDs in the United States. Furthermore, this technique allows\none to distinguish motor vehicle occupants with multiple\ninjuries from those which sustained an isolated injury, which\nmay be an important issue when studying injury outcome by\nhospitalisation, need for ICU care, risk of death, and risk of\ndisability. An important quality of a surveillance system is its\nsimplicity, and this study has demonstrated that by recognising\nand coding only one secondary injury in addition to the\nprincipal injury for each crash victim, an ED-based injury\nsurveillance system could capture up to 90% of the total\nnumber of injuries sustained. This addition is likely to be a small\ninvestment in time and resources for the administration of the\nsurveillance system and would significantly enhance the quality\nof its data. As a result, we would suggest that when developing\nand refining ED-based national injury surveillance systems\naround the world, administrators and public health officials\nstrongly consider coding for and including at least two injuries\nper trauma case in their estimates of injury count and rate.\nAcknowledgements: We thank Tom Schroeder, MS, Cathy Irish, and Laura Noble, at\nthe US Consumer Product Safety Commission for collecting and preparing the\nsurveillance data used in this study and for their collaboration with the National Center\nfor Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFunding: This study was partially funded by the National Center for Injury Prevention\nand Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nCompeting interests: None.\nEthics approval: This study was approved by CDC's Institutional Review Board.\nContributorship: Conception: Dr Ann Dellinger, AG.
