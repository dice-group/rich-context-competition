BMI is widely recommended\nas an indicator of overweight. However, whether BMI ad-\nequately estimates BF and has the same meaning in differ-\nent ethnic groups and youths has been questioned.\nResearch Methods and Procedures: Data come from 456\nFilipino, Chinese, Russian, and black South African youths,\n6 to 16 years old. Percentage BF and fat mass index (FMI)\nwere estimated by the deuterium dilution method. Skinfold\nthicknesses (triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac) and weight\nand height measures were collected. Percentage BF was\nregressed first on BMI and age and then with the addition of\nthe skinfold measures. Linear models were run separately\nby country and sex. The models were repeated with FMI as\nthe outcome.\nResults: The R2 values from the percentage BF models\nin the full models. The values were lowest among Russian\nmales  13 years and Russian females  13 years of age in\nthe reduced and full models, respectively, and were highest\namong Chinese females. Using FMI as the outcome did not\nmeaningfully change the results.\nDiscussion: The ability of BMI to adequately predict BF and\nthe additional predictivity of anthropometric measures varied\nwidely across the samples, making its uniform use as a proxy\nfor BF in youths from different countries questionable.\n",

Popkin*\n Key words: percentage body fat, deuterium dilution,\nBMI, developing countries, fat mass index\nIntroduction\nObesity is an established risk factor for cardiovascular\ndisease, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic health problems\n(1\u00ad3). The prevalence of obesity is increasing among youths\nand adults both in developed (4\u00ad7) and in developing coun-\ntries undergoing the nutrition transition (8\u00ad13). For chil-\ndren, the studies documenting these important trends often\nrely on weight-for-height indices to define overweight or\nobesity, despite the fact that excess body fat (BF)1 is the\nspecific factor associated with increased disease risk. Epi-\ndemiological studies of obesity could benefit from a simple\nand appropriate indicator for adiposity for use in different\nage and ethnic groups.\nAdiposity may be estimated through in vivo body com-\nposition methods such as underwater weighing, deuterium\noxide dilution, and radioactive potassium counting (14).\nHowever, these methods are expensive and/or invasive and,\nthus, not well suited to large epidemiological studies. In\naddition, the assumptions underlying these methods are\npopulation- and age-specific and may not be equally valid\nfor different age and ethnic groups (14,15). In contrast,\nanthropometry is inexpensive, practical, and easy to use in\nlarge population-based field studies, and age- and sex-spe-\ncific reference data are available.\nThe most common anthropometric indicator of BF is\nBMI (kilograms per meter squared).

Differences in the relationship between\nBMI and percentage BF have also been shown in popula-\nwhen compared with American whites. Within the U.S., the\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and\nHealth Study found that the BMI for lean 9-year-old black\nchildren was 3% higher than that for lean white children\nof the same age (24). Possible reasons for ethnic differences\nin the relationship between BMI and percentage BF include\ndifferences in fat-free body density, the distribution of sub-\ncutaneous fat, and limb length relative to trunk size (14,25).\nThese findings suggest that estimates of BF from anthro-\npometric indicators may produce systematic errors across\ndifferent ethnic groups (26). Thus, there has been an urgent\ncall for further research in diverse populations, especially\nthose from developing countries (20), to help clarify ethnic\ndifferences in body composition and to develop measures of\nBF that allow us to accommodate these differences.\nOur study addresses this gap by exploring the ability of a\nvariety of anthropometric indicators to predict body fatness\nin youths from four different countries: the Philippines,\nChina, South Africa, and Russia. Two different indicators of\nbody fatness are explored as standards against which the\nanthropometric measures are compared. These are percent-\nage BF and fat mass (FM) index (FMI) (FM per height\nsquared), both estimated using the deuterium oxide dilution\nmethod. FMI is included in addition to percentage BF\nbecause percentage BF, commonly considered to be the\nstandard of body fatness, has been criticized for ignoring\nbetween-subject variation in fat-free mass (FFM) (26). Dif-\nferences in percentage BF between two individuals could\nreflect either similarities in FFM and true differences in FM\nor could reflect similarities in FM and differences in FFM\n(26). This has led to the suggestion that FM and FFM, both\nderived from total body water (TBW) through the same\ndeuterium dilution method used to calculate percentage BF,\nbe normalized for height by dividing them by height\nsquared and used as distinct indices of body composi-\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nSubjects\nSubjects 6 to 16 years of age were recruited from local\nschools in Metropolitan Cebu, Philippines (n  87); Bei-\nJohannesburg, South Africa, where all the subjects recruited\nwere black (n  86). Sample sizes reflect exclusions due to\nage 17 years (3 in Cebu), age  6 years (1 in Russia),\nimplausible values of percentage BF (3) (2 in Russia and\n1 in South Africa), missing percentage BF measures (16 in\nCebu, 10 in China, and 7 in South Africa), missing sub-\nscapular skinfold (SF) measures (1 in Russia), and measure-\nments that caused violations in the assumptions of normality\nand linearity necessary for unbiased use of linear regression,\nas will be discussed further later (4 in Cebu, 4 in China, 2\nin South Africa, and 5 in Russia). The four country locations\nwere chosen to help derive estimating equations of percent-\nage BF for use in four ongoing longitudinal studies: the\nCebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, the Chi-\nnese Health and Nutrition Survey, the Birth to Ten study in\nSouth Africa, and the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring\nSurvey. These larger studies have been described in detail\nelsewhere (27\u00ad30). Parental consent was obtained for all\nrecruits, and the study protocols were approved locally and\nby the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of\nPublic Health Institutional Review Board.\nData Collection\nOn a specified day, subjects reported to a designated\nclassroom on arrival at school, after breakfast. Control\nsaliva samples were immediately collected in special tubes\n(Salivette, Starstedt, Newton, NC) by having children chew\non a cotton pellet for 45 to 60 seconds. Each child then\nreceived a 30-g dose of deuterium oxide (99% atom percent\nexcess; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA),\nfollowed by a tap water rinse. During the equilibration\nperiod, children remained in the specified classroom, with\ninvestigators present, reading or performing light activities.\nThere was no food intake during the equilibration period,\nand water intake was measured and considered in the cal-\nculations. Additional saliva samples were collected at 3.0\nand 3.5 hours after administration of the deuterium oxide.\nThe saliva samples were placed in tubes, then frozen and\nshipped to the Johns Hopkins Center for Human Nutrition\n(Baltimore, Maryland) for analysis. Data collection at all\nfour sites was completed by personnel who received train-\ning guided by the same techniques and training manuals.\nDuring the wait between the administration of the deute-\nrium oxide and the collection of the final saliva samples,\nanthropometric measures were taken by highly trained per-\nsonnel using standard techniques. Weight was measured to\nthe nearest 0.1 kg, and height was measured to the nearest\n0.1 cm. Triceps, suprailiac, and subscapular SFs were mea-\nsured to the nearest 0.1 mm. BMI was calculated for each\nindividual as kilograms per meter squared (2). Children\nwore light clothing and were barefoot or wore socks.\nEstimating Body Fat in Four Countries, Eckhardt et al.\nLaboratory Analysis\nSaliva samples were analyzed for isotopic enrichment by\ninfrared spectroscopy, as described elsewhere (31). Water\nwas extracted by vacuum sublimation and condensed in a\ndry ice-methanol trap. Deuterium absorbance was measured\nin duplicate at 2500 cm1 in a fixed filter, single-beam\ninfrared analyzer (Miran, Foxboro Analytical Co., South\nNorwal, CT). Interassay coefficient of variability was 3%.\nThe deuterium dilution space was calculated as (D/C)/wt,\nwhere D is the isotope dose, C is the tracer concentration in\nsaliva at equilibrium, and wt is body weight (kilograms).\nTBW was calucated from the deuterium dilution space\nassuming that this space corresponds to 104% of TBW.\nResults from the samples taken at 3 and 3.5 hours were\naveraged.\nCalculation of Percentage BF, FMI, and FFM Index\nPercentage BF was estimated based on the assumption\nthat the water content of FFM (fat-free hydration) is 76%:\nwhere weight is body weight in kilograms and TBW is in\nkilograms. FFM was estimated as suggested by Wells (26):\nFFM  TBW/FFM hydration\nFM was then estimated as follows:\nFM  body weight  FFM\nFM and FFM were then each divided by height squared to\nproduce the FMI and the FFMI, respectively.\nStatistical Analysis\nMultilinear regression estimating models were tested sep-\narately for each country and were stratified by sex. Percent-\nage BF and FMI were separately regressed on different\ncombinations of anthropometric measures to identify the\nbest predictors. Due to the wide age range in the Russian\nsample, models using the Russian data were further strati-\nfied by age (two strata of 13 and 13 years of age). Age\n13 was chosen as the cut point in creating these strata\nbecause it coincides approximately with puberty and be-\ncause it makes the two Russian groups comparable in age\nwith the groups from the other countries. Three sets of\nmodel specifications were tested for each outcome (percent-\nage BF and FMI). Model 1 included only BMI and age as\npredictors because these are often the only variables avail-\nable in large studies and because BMI is recommended by\nthe WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion to define overweight. Model 2 retained BMI and age\nand added triceps SF thickness. Triceps is the most com-\nmonly measured SF and represents limb fat. Model 3 re-\ntained BMI, age, and triceps SF and added suprailiac and\nsubscapular SFs, which measure subcutaneous trunk fat. We\nalso tested a fourth model using the sum of SFs as a\npredictor, but this specification did not improve the model\nfit in any of the samples, and in some cases lowered the R2\nvalues. Thus, only Models 1 to 3 are presented.\nFor each model specified above, several regression diag-\nnostics were performed. Cook and Weisberg tests for het-\neroscedasticity indicated no violations. The normality of the\nresiduals from each model was tested using the Wilkes-\nShapiro test, and subjects whose measurements caused vi-\nolations were excluded. After exclusions made due to nor-\nmality violations of the residuals, subjects with absolute\nvalues of Studentized residuals  3 and whose exclusions\ncaused increases of more than three percentage points in the\nR2 values for the model under scrutiny were additionally\nexcluded. Lowess smoothers were used to examine the\nassumption of linearity between the independent variables\nand the outcomes of interest. Subjects whose measurements\nresulted in gross violations of the linearity assumption were\nexcluded. Subjects who were excluded due to violations\nwith regard to any one model were excluded from all\nanalyses to ensure comparability among the models. These\ncriteria resulted in the exclusion of four subjects from Cebu,\nfour from China, two from South Africa, and five from\nRussia, as mentioned earlier. All analyses were performed\nin Stata for Windows (Release 6.0, Stata Corporation, Col-\nlege Station, TX).\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nMeans (SD) for the anthropometric variables and for\nage are presented in Table 1. Among males, Russians  13\nyears of age had the highest mean percentage BF (30.4%),\nwhereas South Africans had the lowest (19.4%). Among\nfemales, Russians  13 years of age had the highest mean\npercentage BF (36.0%), whereas Chinese youths had the\nlowest (19.0%). FMI followed the same pattern. Among\nmales, mean BMI was highest in the sample of Russians \n13 years of age (19.4) and lowest in the South African\nsample (16.3). Among females, mean BMI was highest in\nthe Cebu sample (20.6) and lowest in the sample of Rus-\nPercentage BF, FMI, BMI, and FFMI with data from all\ncountries combined were plotted against age among girls in\nFigure 1 and among boys in Figure 2. Because only three\nchildren contributed measurements at 6 years of age, they\nwere excluded from the figures; thus, the figures reflect data\nfrom ages 7 through 16 years. Also, it should be noted that\nalthough the data are pooled, different countries contributed\ndata to the graph at different ages. The age ranges of the\nSouth Africa. Despite these age differences, the same indi-\nEstimating Body Fat in Four Countries, Eckhardt et al.\nviduals contributed to each of the four graphs (percentage\nBF, BMI, FMI, and FFMI) at each age in both sexes; thus,\nsex-specific comparisons made among the graphs by age are\nvalid. Among girls, the graphs of percentage BF and FMI\nreveal similar shapes, with body fatness beginning high at 7\nyears of age, falling steadily until 9 years of age, then rising\nto its peak between 12 and 13 years of age before falling\nagain briefly through 14 years of age, and then rising again.\nThe graph of BMI, however, shows a fairly consistent\nincrease across age. The graph of FFMI also shows a steady\nincrease with age, except for one dip between 11 and 12\nyears. Among boys, the graphs of percentage BF and FMI\nshow body fatness beginning high at 7 years of age. Fatness\nthen decreases until 11 years of age, jumps up at 12 years of\nage, and then falls, with one small rise on the way, to its\nlowest level at 16 years of age. Again, the graphs of BMI\nand FFMI show a different shape with adiposity generally\nrising with age, aside from a few dips during early adoles-\ncence. Although the graphs reveal sex differences between\nfemales and males, the graphs from both sexes are similar in\nthat they make the shortcomings of BMI apparent: the\ngraphs of BMI do not track with the graphs of percentage\nBF. As Wells (26) has pointed out, BMI is correlated with\nboth FM and FFM and, thus, can act as a proxy for both but\ncannot distinguish between the two. For example, among\nboth boys and girls, the graphs in Figures 1 and 2 show that\nthe rise in BMI between 7 and 9 years of age reflects a rise\nin FFM, whereas FM and percentage BF actually dropped in\nboth sexes at the same ages.\nRegressions of Percentage BF and FMI on\nAnthropometric Measures\nThe R2 values and mean squared error (MSE) terms from\nthe regressions both of percentage BF and of FMI are shown\nin Table 2. The percentage of variation in percentage BF\nexplained by the independent variables was highest among\nfrom Models 1 to 3, respectively) and was lowest among\nCebu females, Russian males  13 years of age, and Rus-\nsian females in both age strata. The R2 values for these\ngroups ranged from 0.13 among Russian males  13 years\nyears of age in Model 3. FMI was predicted with consider-\nably larger R2 values (e.g., a range of increase in R2 values\nof 14 to 45 percentage points in Model 1) and much smaller\nMSE terms than percentage BF for all groups. That is, the\nanthropometric measures explained more of the variation in\nFMI than in percentage BF.\nThe regression coefficients from the regressions of per-\ncentage BF are shown in Table 3. BMI was positively\nassociated with percentage BF in all groups and was statis-\ntically significant (p  0.05) in all groups except among\nRussian males  13 years of age in Model 1. In Model 2,\ntriceps SF was positively associated with percentage BF in\nTable 1.

Referring back to Table 2, the gains in the\nR2 values with the addition of the triceps SF in Model 2\nranged from 0 percentage points among Chinese males to 25\npercentage points among Russian males  13 years of age.\nThe direction of the association of the subscapular and\nsuprailiac SFs with percentage BF in Model 3 was incon-\nsistent across the populations, across the sexes, and within\nthe sexes. The subscapular SF was statistically significant\nonly among Chinese children, and the suprailiac SF was not\nstatistically significant in any of the groups. With the addi-\ntion of the trunkal SFs in Model 3, the association between\nBMI and percentage BF switched from a positive to a\nnegative relationship among Cebu males, but the associa-\ntion was not significant. Again referring back to Table 2, the\nrise in the R2 values in Model 3 compared with Model 2\nranged from 0 percentage points among Cebu females and\nSouth African males to 7 percentage points among Chinese\nmales.\nThe relationship between the independent variables and\nFMI was virtually the same in all the groups as it was with\npercentage BF as the outcome. Thus, the coefficients from\nthe models of FMI are not included in Table 3. When\nconsidering all the models in all the groups, there were only\ntwo differences in the direction of associations between\nindependent variables and the outcome when using FMI as\nthe outcome instead of percentage BF; in each case, the\nassociations were not significant. There were more differ-\nences with regard to the significance of the different anthro-\npometric measures, but wherever a particular measurement\nwas significant using only one of the outcomes, there was\nnear-significance using the other outcome.\nDiscussion\nWhen judged by the percentage of variation in percentage\nBF accounted for by anthropometric measures, BMI was not\na satisfactory proxy for percentage BF even among Chinese\nchildren, for whom the R2 values in the models tested were\nhighest. Even with the addition of SFs, the highest R2 value\nreached for Chinese females in Model 3 was not as high as\nthat reached in regressions of percentage BF on a combi-\nnation of weight and SF thicknesses in the Pathways mul-\nFigure 1: Percentage BF, BMI, FMI, and FFMI by age among girls in the combined populations from Cebu, China, South Africa, and Russia.\nEstimating Body Fat in Four Countries, Eckhardt et al.\ntisite study of obesity in Native American children (31).\nThis indicates that BMI and other anthropometric proxies\nfor percentage BF should be used with caution among\nchildren from diverse ethnic groups. There are several pos-\nsible explanations for our findings.\nIn any study where anthropometric measures are per-\nformed and laboratory samples are collected, measurement\nerror and sample handling must be considered. Measure-\nment error was minimized by having trained personnel\nperform all measurements using standard procedures. Al-\nthough it is possible that there were slight differences\namong the sites in measurement technique, any errors likely\nwould be systematic within sites. Proper storage and ship-\nping of the saliva samples were ensured.\nBecause it was considered to be unethical to require\nyoung children to fast for the duration of time needed for\ndeuterium dosage and saliva collection (over 3 hours), chil-\ndren were allowed a light breakfast before saliva collection.\nAlthough specific dietary intake data were not collected, we\nestimate that food caused only a relatively small increase in\nTBW during the period of study. Food intake causes an\nexpansion in TBW due to metabolic water being produced\nby the metabolism of food-derived energy. Under the con-\nditions of light physical activity during the study and as-\nsuming an average respiratory quotient of 0.85, the rate of\nexpansion of the body water pool during the equilibration\nperiod would have been 0.04% per hour. Such a small\nmeasurement error would neither introduce major biases\ninto our results nor explain the differences across countries\nfound in our study. Although food intake also may have\naffected weight, it is unlikely that the weight of a light\nbreakfast differed significantly by site. Thus, any error\nintroduced would be systematic and would not affect the\nvalidity of our conclusions drawn from comparisons be-\ntween the groups. Similarly, because it was not considered\nappropriate to weigh adolescents without clothing, all sub-\njects wore light clothing consisting of a t-shirt, shorts, and\nsocks. Again, because it is unlikely that the weight of such\nclothes differed meaningfully by sight, the validity of our\ncomparisons is not compromised. However, the small sam-\nple sizes available in this study may have affected the fit of\nthe models.\nThe assumptions underlying the isotopic dilution method\nfor estimating BF must also be considered. This method\nrequires an assumption of the water content of fat-free body\nmass. This hydration fraction is known to decrease progres-\nsively with age to the adult value of 73%. We used a\nhydration fraction of 76% for the age range of the subjects\nFigure 2: Percentage BF, BMI, FMI, and FFMI by age among boys in the combined populations from Cebu, China, South Africa, and Russia.\nEstimating Body Fat in Four Countries, Eckhardt et al.\nin our study based on research by Boileau et al. (32), who\nreported factors of 75.6% in white and African-American\nprepubescent children (mean age 9.8 years) and 75.5% in\npubescent children (mean age 12.8 years). Their data indi-\ncate that the hydration of fat-free body mass does not show\nlarger differences with age until the postadolescent period\nand does not reach the adult value of 73% until age 22 years\nor later. A hydration fraction of 76% for youths has been\nused by other researchers as well (31). Although the use of\na single hydration coefficient for all the ages included in our\nstudy may introduce some error, the magnitude of this error\nwould be too small to explain the observed between-site\ndifferences in percentage BF. For example, in an extreme\nscenario in which the adult FFM hydration fraction (73%)\nwas used in combination with prepubertal tissue density\n(1.050), there would be a 4% error in BF estimates. Age and\nsex-specific ethnic differences in hydration of the FFM are\nBased on the evidence from Figure 1, BMI does not\ndistinguish between FM and FFM. Although BMI and FFM\nincrease steadily with age, FM does not. This indicates that\nat some ages, the increase in BMI reflects increases in FFM\nrather than FM and, thus, is a poor explanatory factor for the\nvariability in percentage BF.\nOne potential reason for the incongruities between BMI\nand the other estimates of adiposity is the failure to correct\nfor level of maturation. In a study exploring the relationship\nof BMI to percentage FM (PFM) in German youths, Shaefer\net al. (34) found that correction for pubertal stage signifi-\ncantly improved the prediction of PFM from BMI. For\ninstance, in boys, the total explained variance of PFM was\nincreased from 29% to 66% when pubertal stage defined by\nthe Tanner method (35) was included in a model regressing\nPFM on BMI. In our data, the coefficients for BMI were\nsignificant in all three models of percentage BF for Russian\nmales  13 years of age but were not significant in any of\nthe models for Russian males  13 years of age, differences\nthat may reflect the effects of puberty. Precise measures of\nmaturation were available only for the Cebu boys, for whom\npubertal stage data were collected. Surprisingly, inclusion\nof maturation corrections did not produce a more precise\nprediction equation in this case. Maturation stage was not\nmeasured among Cebu girls or in the other three samples,\nleaving open the possibility that maturation might matter in\nthese other groups.\nBMI and SFs explained more variation, and with lower\nMSE values, in FMI than in percentage BF. In Figure 1, we\nsee that trends in FMI and percentage BF are quite compa-\nrable and include large dips with age, whereas BMI in-\ncreased steadily with age. Thus, the improvement of the fit\nof the models when using FMI as the outcome rather than\npercentage BF is most likely the result of both BMI and\nFMI being adjusted for height in the same manner. Thus,\nalthough BMI has the same problem with regard to its\nrelationship with FMI that it does with percentage BF--\nnamely that it cannot distinguish fat from FFM--it does a\nTable 2.

This could\nindicate, for example, that Russian children  13 years of\nage had more subcutaneous fat that cannot be measured\nthrough SFs, whereas the Chinese children had more limb\nand trunk fat that was easily measured.\nThis paper contributes to the existing literature in several\nways. It responds to the growing need for body composition\nresearch in diverse ethnic groups, it explores whether FMI\nmight be more easily predicted by anthropometric measures\nTable 3.

First,\nchanges in BMI represent changes in FFM in addition to\nchanges in FM. In children undergoing dramatic changes in\nbody composition, BMI is a poor proxy for adiposity. BMI\nis a better indicator of adiposity in adults, in whom dramatic\nchanges in FFM are not common (in the absence of major\ndisease), and weight changes mainly reflect shifts in FM.\nSecond, future studies that relate anthropometric indicators\nto more direct measures of BF need to explore further the\ninfluence of maturation levels. Third, the ability of BMI and\nSF measures to predict adiposity differs substantially among\nchildren of different ethnic groups, which may reflect dif-\nferences in fat distribution. Thus, tailored estimating equa-\ntions that take into account such differences should be used\nwhen studying body composition in youths from different\nethnic groups.\n"
