Szinovacz, PhD2\nSeveral researchers contend that demographic and\nsocial changes have significantly altered the experi-\nence of grandparenthood during this century (Cher-\nassertion is limited. Past studies either refer to gen-\neral population trends (census) among the elderly or\nrely on mostly small or nonrepresentative samples of\nmates based on census data are questionable for sev-\neral reasons. First, grandparenthood constitutes a\ncountertransition; that is, a transition determined not\nonly by the grandparent's own characteristics and\nlife choices but also by those of his or her children\nand grandchildren (Hagestad, 1988; Sprey & Mat-\nexperience of grandparenthood reflect not only pop-\nulation trends in at least two generations but also be-\nhavioral dispositions within families. For example,\nage of transition to grandparenthood is contingent\non the timing of births among the grandparents as\nwell as their children, and specific fertility patterns\nsuch as teenage pregnancy are known to recur\nwithin families over several generations. Trends in\ngrandparenthood thus reflect complex generational\nand intrafamilial behavior patterns, which are diffi-\ncult to capture with census data. Furthermore, the\nonset of grandparenthood varies considerably. Thus,\nspecific characteristics of grandparents, such as their\ninvolvement in other roles, cannot be derived from\ndata on specific age groups. Also, census reports on\nsurrogate parenting are limited to \"current\" house-\n1This study was supported by a grant from the AARP-Andrus Founda-\ntion. The National Survey of Families and Households was funded by\nGrant HD21009 from the Center for Population Research of the National\nInstitute of Child Health and Human Development. The survey was de-\nsigned and carried out at the Center for Demography and Ecology at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison under the direction of Larry Bumpass\nand James Sweet. The field work was done by the Institute for Survey Re-\nsearch at Temple University.\n2Address correspondence to Maximiliane Szinovacz, Department of So-\nciology and Criminal Justice, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia\nholds among the population at large, leading to po-\ntential underestimates of this phenomenon.\nStudies on grandparents, on the other hand, rarely\nprovide generalizable data. Even the few large-scale\ninvestigations of grandparenthood performed during\nthe past decade are not truly representative. For\nexample, both Cherlin and Furstenberg (1986) and\nKing and Elder's (1995) studies focused exclusively on\ngrandparents of teenagers or adolescents, and\nBengtson and Harootyan (1994) referred only to\ngrandparents of adult grandchildren. Much of the\ngrandparent research further contains a gender\nand/or race basis: Studies often neglect grandfathers\nand address only specific racial/ethnic groups. In ad-\ndition, both census estimates and grandparent stud-\nies often fail to consider that selected grandparent\ncharacteristics (e.g., survival or involvement in other\nroles) vary for different grandchildren. For instance,\ngrandparents may survive well into the adulthood of\ntheir first-born but not their last-born grandchild.\nBecause of these limitations, we lack even a basic\ndemographic characterization of grandparents in\ngeneral and of specific aspects of current grandpar-\nenthood (e.g., timing, divorce, household composi-\ntion) in particular. As Aldous (1995) noted, such infor-\nmation is essential to assess grandparents' ability to\nprovide support when needed, to estimate the po-\ntential of multiple care needs in families (e.g., frail\ngrandparents and great-grandparents), or to deter-\nmine the prevalence of disrupted grandparent-\ngrandchild relations due to divorce. Demographic in-\nformation on grandparents also is sought by market\nresearchers as grandparents constitute an important\nand growing target for businesses selling merchan-\ndise for children and adolescents (Schlosberg, 1990;\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a nation-\nally representative demographic profile of grand-\nparents that addresses some of the most important\ncharacteristics of current grandparenthood, namely,\nprevalence, survival, timing, divorce, surrogate par-\nenting, and grandparents' other roles. Demographic\ntrends in grandparenthood identified in earlier stud-\nies are presented first and then contrasted with data\non current grandparents from a nationally represen-\ntative survey, the National Survey of Families and\nHouseholds (NSFH). Whenever sample size permits,\nthese data are presented by gender and race, thus\npaying tribute to the heterogeneity among today's\ngrandparents. A detailed discussion of grandpar-\nent-grandchild relationships would go beyond the\ndemographic emphasis of this article.\nLiterature Review\nPrevalence, Survival, and Timing\nHow many individuals eventually experience grand-\nparenthood depends on longevity and their own and\ntheir children's fertility and timing of parenthood.\nLife expectancy--both at birth and at typical child-\nbearing age --increased dramatically during this cen-\ntury (Watkins, Menken, & Bongaarts, 1987). Most in-\ndividuals in industrialized societies now survive well\nbeyond the usual age of becoming a grandparent;\nsurvive to become great-grandparents (Farkas &\nHogan, 1995). Thus, both the likelihood of surviving\nto grandparenthood and the duration of grandpar-\nenthood increased during this century (Cherlin &\nplies that most of today's grandchildren will have all\nor most of their grandparents survive at least during\npart of their childhood and adolescence, and many\nwill have surviving grandparents well into their adult\nyears. Uhlenberg (1996) estimated, for example, that\nby the year 2000 over one third of grandchildren will\nhave all of their grandparents survive to age 10, and\nthat three quarters will have at least one surviving\ngrandparent at age 30.\nEstimates of fertility for two successive generations\nare not readily available. Uhlenberg and Kirby (in\npress) estimated that the peak fertility during the\nbaby boom will lead to particularly low rates of\ngrandchildlessness during the last two decades of\nthis century, whereas declining fertility for more re-\ncent cohorts is likely to result in increased propor-\ntions of grandchildless individuals after the turn of\nthis century.\nMedian age of first parenthood underwent only\nrelatively minor changes during this century.\nStevens' (1990) estimates from census data indicated\nthat except for the baby boom period (when median\nage at first parenthood was 21-22 years), women's\nmedian age at the birth of their first child remained\n1980. However, both the relatively large number of\nteenage births in the later part of this century and the\nmore recent simultaneous trend toward delayed par-\nlikely to result in greater heterogeneity in the onset\nand duration of grandparenthood.\nHow many and how long their grandparents sur-\nvive also is contingent on grandchildren's birth order\nas well as on the birth order of their parents. Obvi-\nously, first-born children of first-born parents will\nenjoy surviving grandparents longer than children of\nany other birth order combination. Due primarily to\nthe sharp decline in number of births per woman\nduring this century (with some increases during the\nbaby boom), the interval between first and last births\nis now much smaller than it was at the beginning of\nthe century (Spanier & Click, 1980), so that differ-\nences in grandparents' survival between first-born\nand last-born grandchildren are minimized.\nThe reduction in fertility and in the interval be-\ntween first and last births during this century led\nsome researchers to assert that today's grandparents\nwill have launched their own children by the time\nthey become grandparents; that is, active parent-\nhood (children under 18 in the household) and\ngrandparenthood are seen as sequential rather than\noverlapping life phases (Hagestad, 1988; Hagestad &\nBurton, 1986). The only exception to this trend is\nnoted for parents of teenage parents and associated\nwith perceptions of \"off-time\" grandparenthood\nIncreased life expectancy and reduced fertility led\nto the characterization of today's families as bean-\npole families, a term reflecting the expanding ver-\ntical and declining horizontal extension of families\n(Bengtson, Rosenthal, & Burton, 1990; George &\nCold, 1991). The validity of this characterization for\ntoday's and future families remains debated (Farkas\nas more individuals than in the past may survive to\ngreat-grandparenthood, the duration of great-grand-\nparenthood and the prevalence of four-generation\nfamilies is not known. Also, grandparents of the baby\nboom cohorts will have several siblings and cousins\nthroughout most of their lives.\nAlthough increases in life expectancy during this\ncentury cut across all population groups, pronounced\ngender and racial or ethnic differences in life ex-\npectancy remain (Markides & Black, 1995; Moen,\n1995). The gender gap in life expectancy increased\nduring this century, leading to sometimes pro-\nnounced discrepancies in the survival of grandmoth-\ners and grandfathers (Baranowski, 1985; Kinsella,\n1995). The effects of continued lower life expectancy\namong racial or ethnic minorities, on the other hand,\nmay be partially offset by earlier childbearing among\nthese groups (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1990). In\naddition, age differences between spouses often\nlead to discrepancies in the survival of maternal and\npaternal grandparents. Age heterogeneity between\nspouses declined during this century from about 4\ncause two generations are involved, this means that\nage differences between maternal grandmothers and\npaternal grandfathers will have declined on average\nfrom 8 to 4 years since the beginning of this century.\nAlso, large age differences between spouses (10\nyears or more) were much more common at the be-\nginning of this century than they are today, as were\nmarriages in which husbands were younger than\ntheir wives (Atkinson & Glass, 1985). Consequently,\ntoday's grandchildren will be more likely than grand-\n38 The Gerontologist\nchildren in the past to have grandparents who are\nsimilar in age and less likely to have grandfathers\nwho are younger than grandmothers or who survive\ngrandmothers.\nOverall, this research implies that today's grand-\nparents will spend several decades as grandparents\nand will share their role as grandparents with other\ngrandparents (both their own spouse and the grand-\nparents from the other lineage). Similarly, grandchil-\ndren will have more surviving grandparents and will\nhave grandparents who survive for a longer time.\nTrends in fertility and the timing of marriage and par-\nenthood further suggest greater homogeneity in\ngrandparents' ages and in siblings' access to grand-\nparents and a separation of parent and grandparent\nroles during the life course. Declines in fertility cou-\npled with increased life expectancy are likely to lead\nto increased verticalization of families. However,\nteenage births and delays of parenthood in recent\ncohorts, as well as gender and racial or ethnic differ-\nences in life expectancy, will account for some het-\nerogeneity both in the onset and duration of grand-\nparenthood among diverse population groups.\nGrandparenthood and Life Course Transitions\nChanges in the timing and duration of grandpar-\nenthood have important implications not only for the\nexperience of grandparenthood itself but also for its\nintersection with other life events and transitions,\nboth grandparents' and grandchildren's. As several\ngrandparent-grandchild relationships are at least\npartially contingent on grandparents' and grandchil-\ndren's roles in other life spheres (e.g., marriage, par-\nenthood, labor force participation) and on the se-\nquencing of life transitions in each of these domains.\nGenerally, the onset of grandparenthood occurs in\nmidlife when involvement in other roles is at its peak\nintersecting life transitions has become increasingly\nimportant with the prolonged duration of grandpar-\nenthood (i.e., both grandparents and grandchildren\nwill undergo more life transitions as the duration\nof grandparenthood and the number of surviving\ngrandparents increase).\nAs far as marriage is concerned, several fundamen-\ntal changes in sequencing occurred during this cen-\ntury. Increases in longevity most likely led to a rever-\nsal in the timing of grandparenthood and\nwidow(er)hood. Whereas early in this century wid-\nowhood often preceded the launching of the last\nchild or occurred shortly thereafter, today's parents\ntypically enjoy a lengthy empty-nest period together\nbefore one partner dies (Spanier & Click, 1980; Uh-\nlenberg, 1980). Thus, today's grandparents are likely\nto experience the death of their partner well after\nthey become grandparents. Recent delays in parent-\nhood are likely to decrease the interval between\ngrandparenthood and widowhood but unlikely to\nfully reverse this trend.\nHowever, the postponement of widowhood into\nlater life does not necessarily mean that today's\ngrandparents will be significantly more likely to be\nmarried (and especially married to each other) than\ngrandparents in the past. Rising divorce rates during\nthis century and the gender differences in remar-\nriage (Bumpass, 1990) suggest that more grandmoth-\ners will enter grandparenthood as divorcees and\nmore grandparents of either sex will be married to\npartners other than the grandchildren's biological\ngrandparents.\nIn addition, more grandparents than in the past\nwill experience the occurrence of divorce and step-\nfamilies among their adult children. Glick (1989) esti-\nmated that close to one quarter of all children under\n18 live with single parents and an additional 14% live\nwith stepparents. Because stepgrandparenthood re-\nsults from both grandparents' and their adult chil-\ndren's divorces, the proportion of stepgrandparents\nmost likely exceeds the proportion of divorcees with\nchildren in either generation.\nChanges in labor force participation during this\ncentury also have major implications for the experi-\nence of grandparenthood. Three trends are particu-\nlarly significant; namely, the increased labor force\nparticipation of women (including women in their\n40s and 50s), the institutionalization of retirement,\nand the decline in retirement age (Szinovacz & Ek-\nerdt, 1995). The increased labor force participation\namong middle-aged women implies that many of\ntoday's grandmothers will be employed (especially\nwhen their grandchildren are still relatively young)\nand thus less available to care for grandchildren dur-\ning work hours. The institutionalization of retirement\nand reduction in retirement age mean, first, that\ngrandfathers will be more available for their grand-\nchildren. During the first half of this century many\nmen either did not retire at all (i.e., death occurred at\na time when they were still in the labor force) or sur-\nvived their retirement by only a short time, often ill\nimplementation of Social Security and pension plans\nas well as economic pressures led to a steady decline\nin men's retirement age at least since the 1950s (Szi-\nnovacz & Ekerdt, 1995). Thus, a larger proportion of\ntoday's men will spend close to a decade as grandfa-\nthers and retirees. Similarly, few women are em-\nployed beyond their mid-60s and many leave the\nlabor force in their early 60s or even in their late 50s\n(Szinovacz & Ekerdt, 1995). Thus, grandmothers of\nolder children are unlikely to be in the labor force,\nbut in contrast to grandmothers in the past they are\nmore likely to be retirees rather than long-term\nhousewives.\nIn general, then, today's grandparents are not nec-\nessarily occupying more roles than grandparents in\nthe past (e.g., grandmothers are more likely to be\nemployed but less likely to be active parents). Rather,\nthey are prone to undergo more life transitions dur-\ning grandparenthood. In addition, the rising divorce\nrate during this century has contributed to increas-\ningly complex family structures. It also implies that\ngrandparent-grandchild relationships can be dis-\nrupted not only by death but also by divorce in\neither the parents' or the grandparents' generation.\nHousehold Extension and Surrogate Parenting\nIn assessing trends in household extension, it is\nimportant to distinguish between upward and down-\nward extension; that is, whether adult children take\nin their parent(s) (upward extension) or whether\nadult children and their children reside in their par-\nents' household (downward extension), and whether\nboth, one, or neither of the grandchildren's parents\nlive in the household (Burton, Dilworth-Anderson, &\n1996). The distinction between upward and down-\nward extension typically (though not always) indi-\ncates whether the extended household is maintained\nto serve the grandparents' or the adult children's and\nthe grandchildren's needs (Aquilino, 1990; Lee &\nchildren's parent(s) offers rough estimates concern-\ning grandparents' responsibility for the grandchil-\ndren (i.e., whether they have full responsibility for\nthe grandchildren or function more as co-parents or\nhelpers to the grandchildren's own parents).\nSome evidence concerning trends in extended\nhouseholds and surrogate parenting is available from\ncensus data. The proportion of grandchildren core-\nsiding with grandparents (in both upward and down-\nward extended households) increased slightly be-\nnandez & Myers, 1993; Uhlenberg & Kirby, in press).\nThis general pattern varies by family structure and\nrace. The strongest decline in coresidence with\ngrandparents since the middle of this century oc-\ncurred among two parent families suggesting that\ntraditional extended households (children remaining\nin parents' household after their marriage and par-\nenthood) and/or adult children taking elderly parents\ninto their homes are becoming increasingly rare\n(Hernandez & Myers, 1993; Uhlenberg & Kirby, in\npress). This conclusion is supported by other census\nanalyses, which indicate a decline since mid-century\nin the proportion of elderly parents living with their\ntrast, the proportion of White grandchildren living\nwith single or no parents and grandparents declined\nAmong Blacks, the proportion of grandchildren liv-\ning with neither parent and grandparents declined\nportion of grandchildren living with single parents\nand grandparents increased from 3.1% to 5.7% dur-\ning the same time period (Hernandez & Myers, 1993).\nAdditional census data indicate that less than 10%\nof children lived at any one point in time in house-\nholds headed by grandparents since the middle of\nthis century. The proportion of children exposed to\nmuch less likely than other racial or ethnic groups to\nlive in grandparent-headed households. For exam-\nchildren lived in grandparents' households (Saluter,\nAssessments of current household structure may\nconsiderably underestimate lifetime exposure to ex-\ntended households. Earlier analyses of data from the\nfirst wave of the NSFH indicate that 18% of Blacks\nand 9% of Whites have ever lived in the household\nof a grandparent, whereas 11% of Blacks and 19% of\nWhites had a grandparent live with their family (Szi-\nnovacz, 1996). Thus, well over one quarter of the\nNSFH respondents experienced coresidence with\ngrandparents sometime during their childhood or\nadolescence, a percentage considerably higher than\nthat captured by the census data (see also Hernan-\nExpected Trends\nThe purpose of this article is to assess whether\nprevailing depictions of grandparenthood are accu-\nrate. The preceding literature review suggests the\nfollowing characterization of today's grandparents:\n1. Most individuals will experience grandparent-\nhood.\n2. The onset of grandparenthood typically occurs\nduring middle age. However, there will be some\nheterogeneity in the timing of grandparenthood.\nSpecifically, minorities and women will experi-\nence grandparenthood earlier than Whites and\nmen.\n3. Grandparents typically survive beyond their grand-\nchildren's adolescence, and grandchildren have\nseveral surviving grandparents by the time they\nreach adulthood (age 18). This trend should apply\nregardless of grandchildren's birth order.\n4. Because of gender differences in life expectancy\nand age differences between spouses, grandchil-\ndren should be most likely to have surviving ma-\nternal grandmothers and least likely to have sur-\nviving paternal grandfathers.\n5. The concept of the beanpole family suggests that\nthe majority of families will have a surviving\ngreat-grandparent or four living generations (or\nthat grandparents will have a surviving parent at\nleast while their grandchildren are still young).\n6. Grandparenthood and active parenthood have\nbecome sequential life phases. Thus, at the onset\nof grandparenthood most individuals will no\nlonger have dependent children in the house-\nhold.\n7. Widow(er)hood will typically follow rather than\nprecede the transition to grandparenthood. Con-\nsequently, only a minority of grandparents with\nyoung grandchildren will be widowed.\nstepgrandparents either through their own or\nthrough their adult children's divorces and re-\nmarriages.\n9. The majority of grandparents (both male and\nfemale) with young grandchildren will be em-\n40 The Gerontologist\nployed. The majority of older grandparents (age\n60 and over) or of grandparents with older grand-\nchildren will not be employed.\n10. Because the census data refer to living arrange-\nments of children rather than grandparents, it\nis difficult to estimate how many grandparents\nlive in extended households. The census data\nwould suggest that less than 10% of grandparents\nwill reside with grandchildren at any one point in\ntime, but a considerably higher proportion (20%\nor more) should have ever lived with grandchil-\ndren. Upward extended households should pre-\nvail among Whites, whereas downward extended\nhouseholds should be more common among\nBlacks.\nMethods\nSample\nThis study relies on Wave 2 of the NSFH, which\nNSFH is based on a multistage area probability sam-\nple, which was augmented by oversampling of mi-\nnorities, one-parent families, families with stepchil-\ndren, cohabitors, and recently married persons. The\noversample was achieved by doubling the number of\ntargeted households. The original sample (including\nthe oversample) consisted of 33,869 addresses. These\naddresses were first screened, and successfully\nscreened households were approached for inter-\nviews. Data for the first wave were collected from a\nrandomly selected household member age 19 or\nmore, his/her spouse, and a tertiary household mem-\nber (if the respondent was a child or other relative of\nthe householder). First wave interview response\nrates for the successfully screened households were\nsample, resulting in a total sample of 13,017 respon-\ndents. The response rate for spouses was 83.2%.\ninterviews, representing an attrition rate of 23.2%. To\nrestore the representativeness of the Wave 2 data,\nweights adjust for sampling and response rates at\nTime 1 as well as attrition in Wave 2. (For a detailed\ndescription of the study design and sample, see\nAll data presented here (except for those based on\ngrandchildren's responses) are weighted to adjust\nfor oversampling of selected population groups as\nwell as refusals and attrition. Because the grandchil-\ndren data rely on responses from \"focal\" children\n(one child age 9 or over was randomly selected to be\ninterviewed), they are not comparable to the total\nsample. Therefore, use of overall weights would be\ninappropriate, and special weights for the focal chil-\ndren are not available. The analyses presented below\nrely on different subsamples, contingent on the \"at-\nrisk\" population. For example, analyses of specific\ncharacteristics of grandparents are based on the sub-\nsample of current grandparents. The subsample sizes\nfor these groups are shown in the tables.\nMeasures\nData on the prevalence of grandparenthood rely\non two sources: respondents' own reports and inter-\nviews with focal children age 9 to 26. Respondents\nwere asked whether and how many grandchildren\nthey have and how old their youngest and oldest\ngrandchild is. In addition, they completed household\nrosters both for all current household members as\nwell as for children and spouse's children living out-\nside the household. The current household roster in-\ncludes information on all household members' rela-\ntionship to the respondent (including children,\nstepchildren, and grandchildren). Furthermore, re-\nspondents were asked to complete a series of ques-\ntions about children (own and stepchildren) both in-\nside and outside the household, including their ages,\nand for children age 16 and over, the respondents\nwere asked to answer questions about marital status,\nnumber of children, and whether the child has\nstepchildren. Existence and number of grandchildren\nfor respondents was derived from both the direct\nquestions about grandparenthood as well as the\nhousehold rosters. Comparisons of both measures\nnot only serve validation purposes but can also pro-\nvide some preliminary assessment on whether self-\ndefined grandparenthood differs from strictly biolog-\nical grandparenthood. Self-defined grandparenthood\nmay include stepgrandchildren as well as \"fictive\ngrandchildren\" who may have any blood or other re-\nlationship to the respondent. Grandchildren's re-\nsponses are based on questions about whether each\nof their grandparents is currently alive.\nTo estimate duration of grandparents' survival, the\ntiming of grandparenthood, as well as the prevalence\nof three- and four-generation families, the analyses\nfurther rely on questions about respondents' par-\nents. Specifically, respondents were asked whether\ntheir parents are still alive and, if alive, how old their\nparents are. If parents had died, information was ob-\ntained on the year of death and parents' age at the\ntime of their deaths. By converting all age data (e.g.,\nbirth of first child, birth of last grandchild, death of\nparent) to calendar years, it was possible to calculate\nparents' survival for specific grandparent transitions\n(e.g., birth of their first grandchild or great-grand-\nchild). It should be noted that nonresponses were\nrelatively high for these questions especially when\nparents had died a long time ago. Furthermore, some\nresponses were clearly invalid (e.g., age at birth of\nchildren or grandchildren was biologically impossi-\nble or highly unlikely). Because the validity of re-\nsponses about parents is sometimes ambiguous (for\nexample, men may have children late in life), births\nprior to age 12 and after age 49 were treated as miss-\ning, yielding altogether 5% missing responses for\nmothers and 14% missing responses for fathers. Cal-\nculations of respondents' own timing of parenthood\nand grandparenthood were based on responses con-\ncerning their own ages, the ages of their children,\nand the ages of their youngest and oldest grandchild.\nTo assess the prevalence of stepgrandparenthood,\nit is necessary to combine information on children\nand stepchildren with information on divorce in fam-\nilies. Stepgrandparenthood occurs when (a) individu-\nals with children have living stepparents, (b) individ-\nuals with stepchildren have living parents or\nindividuals with children from another person than\nthe current spouse have living parents-in-law, (c)\nwhen individuals' own children or their partners'\nchildren have stepchildren, or (d) when individuals\nor their partners' stepchildren have children. These\ndifferent types of stepgrandparenthood were de-\nrived from data on respondents' and their partners'\nchildren (based on the household and child rosters)\nas well as from information on the survival and mari-\ntal status of their parents and parents-in-law. The\nhousehold and child rosters yield the necessary data\non whether or not respondents' own or their part-\nners' children have children or stepchildren, whether\nrespondents' children are offspring of their current\npartners, and whether respondents have stepchil-\ndren. Because data on ex-spouses' children (who are\nnot respondents' own children) are fragmentary and\nex-stepchildren may not be defined as relatives, most\nof the analyses rely on married respondents and\nstepchildren from their current partners.\nThe analyses on stepparents rely exclusively on\nstepparents who are currently married to respon-\ndents' parents. This relatively narrow definition of\nstepparents seems warranted for both data availabil-\nity and conceptual reasons. Although the NSFH does\ncontain information on stepparents during respon-\ndents' childhood, no information is available on step-\nparents acquired after childhood but who are no\nlonger married to respondents' parents. From a con-\nceptual standpoint it also is not clear whether step-\nparents are still considered as such once their mar-\nriages to respondents' parents are dissolved by death\nor divorce. The overall prevalence of stepgrandpar-\nenthood was assessed by determining whether any\nof the relationships described under (a) through (d)\nabove was present for either spouse.\nThe analyses on household extension and surro-\ngate parenting rely mostly on information from the\nhousehold rosters. Respondents indicated whether\ngrandchildren or children (their own, their spouses',\nor in-laws) with children reside in the household. On\nthe basis of these data as well as on information con-\ncerning children's marital status, it was determined\nwhether grandchildren are in the household with or\nwithout their parents. Because coresidence with\ngrandchildren is not always indicative of grandpar-\nents' surrogate parenting, especially if the grandpar-\nent is not the householder, separate analyses were\nperformed for grandparents who are and those who\nare not household heads or spouses of household\nheads. The interviews further contained the question\n\"Did you ever have primary responsibility for your\ngrandchild(ren) for more than six months?\" Those\nanswering \"yes\" were classified as having been sur-\nrogate parents, regardless of whether or not they are\ncurrently surrogate parents. Analyses referring to this\nquestion thus represent lifetime experiences of sur-\nrogate parenting among today's grandparents. Fuller-\nThomson, Minkler, and Driver's (1997) analyses of\nthe NSFH data offer more detailed analyses of the\ncomposition of surrogate grandparents. However,\ntheir analyses focus on those grandparents who\nwere surrogate parents during the 1990s. They thus\nexclude those grandparents who stopped their sur-\nAssessment of the prevalence of three-generation\nhouseholds also relies on the household rosters.\nThree-generation households were defined as house-\nholds that include either a household member of the\nparent generation (respondents' own parent, step-\nparent, or parent-in-law) and respondents' children\n(including children-in-law and stepchildren) or\nhouseholds that include children (including stepchil-\ndren and children-in-law) and grandchildren or step-\ngrandchildren.\nTo arrive at estimates of grandparents' other re-\nsponsibilities, we considered their involvement in\nother family roles as well as their employment status.\nFamily responsibilities refer to the presence of a liv-\ning parent (in this case, only respondents' own par-\nents were counted), of dependent children (age 18\nor under) in the household, and of a spouse. Respon-\ndents were deemed full-time employed if they\nworked 30 h or more per week. Because involvement\nin such roles may change during grandparenthood,\nthe data are presented separately for all grandpar-\nents and for those with grandchildren age 5 or\nunder.\nResults\nPrevalence\nAs shown in Table 1, between one third and two\nfifths of all NSFH respondents are grandparents. This\nproportion increases to about two thirds when only\nindividuals \"at risk\" of grandparenthood (i.e., those\nwith children of childbearing age) are considered.\nEventually, though, very few individuals remain\ngrandchildless: Among those with children aged 40\nyears and over, close to 95% are grandparents. On\naverage, grandparents have five to six grandchildren.\nThe data further indicate that over 80% of today's\nfamilies contain three generations, and 16% have\nfour or more living generations. It should be noted\nthat the estimates of three- and four-generation\nfamilies shown here are likely underestimates. Be-\ncause the NSFH does not contain information on the\nsurvival of respondents' grandparents or the exis-\ntence of great-grandchildren, only adjacent genera-\ntions and grandchildren could be considered in the\ncalculations.\nPrevalence and number of grandchildren vary by\nboth gender and race or ethnicity.
