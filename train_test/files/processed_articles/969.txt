Together the approaches used indicated that the\nprimary sources of PA for this population are chores and active commuting. In all, 40% of the sample walked to school, less than\n1% rode a bicycle, 22% rode in/on motorized transport, and 37% used some combination of walking and motorized transport.\nFurther, gender differences exist for type, frequency, and duration of physical activities performed by Filipino youth. Specifically,\nfemales report engaging in few leisure-time physical activities and more household chores. In total, 48% of Filipino youth report\nwatching !2 h/day of television; relatively few youth (7%) report watching >4 h/day at this time. An 18% of males report no\nvigorous activities compared to 87% of females.\nCONCLUSION: Clear gender differences in PA patterns and levels exist in Filipino adolescents. Nonsport/exercise type activities\n(eg chores and active commuting) currently provide a large proportion of daily activity for both males and females, however. It is\nanticipated that as modernization and technological advancement continue in this developing country, these primary sources of\nPA will decrease.\nKeywords: developing countries; economic transition; tracking; energy expenditure; active commuting\nIntroduction\nObesity levels among adults and youth continue to grow\nto epidemic proportions worldwide.1 As researchers, we\nstruggle to understand the roles of physical activity (PA),\ninactivity, and food selection in this process. While it is\nbecoming clear that the shift toward greater obesity evident\nin Western societies is shared with youth and adults from the\ndeveloping world, little else is understood about their unique\npatterns of diet and PA.2 For example, much of what we\nknow about youth PA patterns is based predominantly on\nthe experience of developed countries, limiting our ability to\nunderstand the roots of obesity trends in the rest of the\nworld.3 Decreases in PA are likely to play an important role in\nthe development of overweight and obesity and a range of\nrelated health conditions, yet there is a scarcity of data on PA\npatterns of youth in developing countries.4\nThe Philippines is one such country in the midst of a rapid\nshift in diet and PA patterns that are linked with greater\nobesity, hypertension, and related problems among adults.\nAmong Filipino youth, high blood pressure and other early\nsigns of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are emerging, in\n*Correspondence: Dr C Tudor-Locke, Department of Exercise and Well-\nness, Arizona State University East, 7001 E. Williams Field Road, Mesa,\nE-mail: Tudor-Locke@asu.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nparticular among youth who have the lowest body mass\nindex (BMI) at birth, but the highest BMI in adolescence.5\nObesity has not emerged as a major problem yet among\nthese Filipino youth, but the BMI trends and emergence of\nCVD risk factors provide a strong rationale for examining the\nrole of PA.\nYouth is a time of transition as adolescents reprise social\nroles (eg leave school, find employment) and begin to take\non more responsibilities in preparation for adulthood.\nDramatic reductions in PA during this time of transition\nhave been well documented in developed countries; the\nsteepest declines occur between the ages of 13 and 18 y and\nare greater in females than in males.6 We do not know if the\nsame pattern holds true in developing countries; in a\ncountry that relies on subsistence agriculture, characterized\nby high levels of manual labor and low mechanization,\nfemale adolescents working as maids in the city are more\nphysically active (determined by objective monitor) than\ntheir rural counterparts charged with domestic chores and\nchildcare tasks.7 To better understand youth PA transition in\nthe context of developing countries, one strategy is to\nexamine thoroughly PA patterns at this important lifecycle\nthreshold.\nNo criterion standard exists to measure PA in field settings.\nSelf-report questionnaires are the most common method for\nassessing PA in large epidemiological studies of free-living\nindividuals, primarily because of their low cost, ease of\nadministration, and potential for nonreactivity.8 PA recalls\n(eg 24-h recall) and motion sensors are considered direct\nmeasures of PA. They are not without their own biases and\nlimitations, however. Issues related to individual recall\nability and response bias (recall bias, social desirability bias)\nare of concern for 24-h PA recalls,8 as are compliance issues\nfor subjects wearing motion sensors.9 Nevertheless, multiple\nfield measures are useful to understand overlapping and\ndiffering aspects of PA in free-living situations. Therefore, the\npurpose of this paper was to describe PA and inactivity levels\nof Filipino youth aged 14\u00ad16 y using multiple methods of PA\nassessment, and to assess the concordance between the\nmethods.\nMethods\nCebu  \nThe CLHNS is a community-based study of a 1-y birth cohort\nrandomly selected from urban and rural communities of\nMetro Cebu, the second largest and most rapidly growing\nmetropolitan area of the Philippines. The participants live in\ndiverse communities, ranging from densely populated urban\nand peri-urban neighborhoods to more isolated rural villages\nin the mountains or on nearby islands. Originally designed\nas a study of infant feeding patterns, the CLHNS is part of an\nongoing study of a cohort of Filipino women who gave birth\nconsisted of 3080 women having single live births. At birth,\nthe cohort was representative of births occurring in metro\nCebu in a 1-y period. The cohort of children born during that\nperiod, their mothers, other caretakers, and selected siblings\ncontinue to be followed through subsequent surveys con-\nterm objective of the project is to follow index children\nthrough adolescence and into the childbearing years. In\norder to shed light on the emerging trend of increased\noverweight, self-report measures of index children's PA\n(usual and 24-h recall) and objective monitoring of energy\nexpenditure as a result of PA were added to the survey in\npublications can be found at http://www.cpc.unc.edu?pro-\njects/cebu.\nSubjects\n14\u00ad16 y of age. All were part of the ongoing CLHNS. Teams of\ntrained local interviewers visited households to collect PA\ndata. Parents or caretakers also provided a wide range of\ndemographic, socioeconomic, and environmental data.\nimportant to first collect data on all of the females, owing to\ntheir earlier pubertal maturation compared to males.\nQuestionnaire data were analyzed from 1053 males (aged\njects (38 males and two females) reporting unrealistically\nhigh (above the 99th percentile of distribution) total\nmoderate (MOD) or vigorous (VIG) intensity PA levels. As a\nresult of the delayed data collection procedure in the\nCLHNS, males were uniformly older than females (t \u00bc 46.5,\nSubjects included in the most recent CLHNS follow-up differ\nin only small ways from those who were lost; initially, deaths\namong the cohort of single live born subjects (n \u00bc 155 in the\nfirst 2 y) were disproportionately among poorer, less edu-\ncated households. In contrast, migrants tended to be more\neducated, younger, and urban. However, in several studies,\nno bias in estimated relationships (eg effects of nutrition on\na health outcome) could be detected when using methods\nsuch as Heckman modeling.\nPA data\nThe PA questionnaire focused on MOD (3\u00ad6 metabolic\nequivalents (METs)) and VIG (>6 METs) intensity PA beha-\nviors at school and/or work, after school/work, and in\npersonal transportation. One MET is roughly equivalent to\nthe energy cost of sitting quietly (approximately 3.5 ml of\noxygen/kg body weight/min or 1 kcal/kg body weight/h).10\nClassification of intensity levels as light (o3 METs), MOD (3\u00ad\nPhysical activity in Filipino youth\nC Tudor-Locke et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nconsensus panel on PA and public health.11 An objective\nmeasure of energy expenditure as a result of PA was obtained\nusing a Caltrac accelerometer (Muscle Dynamics, Torrence,\nCA, USA). The 24-h PA recall allowed for the inspection of\nself-reported time use patterns.\nCLHNS PA questions. Adolescents registered in school\nwere asked a series of questions about their usual PA\nbehaviors (type, frequency, duration), focusing on in-school\nand after-school physical activities (exercise/sport and non-\nexercise/sport), work activities, commuting mode to school,\nand time spent watching television. Youth attending school\nwere asked to identify usual mode of commuting to school\nas: (1) walking; (2) bicycling; (3) riding a motorized vehicle;\n(4) a combination of 1 and 3; or (5) other. Reported time to\nwalk to the nearest public transportation was used to\ncalculate active commuting to school for youth reporting\ncommuting using a combination of walking and motorized\nvehicle.\nFor respondents not registered in school, questions\nfocused on job type, hours/week on the job, and time spent\nin physical activities after work (exercise/sport and non-\nexercise/sport). Types of activities performed were recorded\nverbatim and youth could volunteer as many activities as\nthey wished. CLHNS PA questions are included in Appendix\nA. For all activities identified, respondents were queried\nabout their frequency (days/week) and duration (minutes or\nhours/week). Frequency and duration of television watching\n(hours/day) were also queried. Questions about personal\ntransportation were not asked of youth not registered in\nschool.\nCaltrac accelerometer. The Caltrac accelerometer is a\nsmall, light-weight electronic device that uses microcompu-\nter technology to assess energy expenditure as a result of PA\nby monitoring vertical accelerations of the body.12,13\nCaltracs were worn in a pouch attached to a waist belt,\ncentered over either leg. Subjects were instructed not to\nremove the device, except for bathing or sleeping for\napproximately 24 h, or until the interviewer returned the\nnext day for retrieval. Time programmed, time retrieved, and\nenergy expenditure as a result of PA (kcal) were recorded.\nCaltracs were preprogrammed as per the manufacturer's\ninstructions for each individual by entering the subject's\nweight, height, age, and gender into the instrument's\nmemory. By design, Caltrac acceleration data are converted\nto energy expenditure as a result of PA by a proprietary built-\nin computer program and displayed digitally as kcal.\nUnfortunately, raw movement data (eg counts) were not\nobtained; at the time, energy expenditure was considered the\nmore appropriate estimate of PA.\n24-h recall. A 24-h PA recall protocol was used to identify\nall PA performed while wearing the Caltrac. The adolescents\nhad been advised to take note of their activities while\nwearing the accelerometer. The 24-h PA recall was prompted\nby the trained interviewers asking about segments of the day\nstarting when the Caltrac was first worn and ending with its\nretrieval. Youth were encouraged to account for the full time\nthat passed between Caltrac programming and retrieval.\nData treatment and statistical analysis\nCLHNS PA questionnaire. Two researchers separately as-\nsigned each verbatim-reported activity a MET value using the\nupdated Compendium of Physical Activities.10 Discussion\nand agreement resolved differences in assigned MET values.\nA MET is defined as the work metabolic rate divided by the\nresting metabolic rate. Active commuting to school by\nwalking/bicycling was classified as a MOD intensity PA.10\nMET values were also assigned to represent reported intensity\nof work activities. For example, work that required constant\nmoving and carrying light weight (eg 5 kg) was assigned a 3-\nMET value.10 Frequency and duration of reported activities\nwere used to construct time (minutes/week) spent in MOD/\nVIG physical activities. Admittedly, the energy cost of\nactivities is likely about 10% higher in children. Unfortu-\nnately, no youth-appropriate normative data are presently\navailable.\nTime spent in active commuting to school each week was\ncomputed assuming 2 trips/day, 5 days/week. Inactivity\nindices included no reported time in VIG activities and\nwatching television !2 and !4 h/day. The categories of\ntelevision watching were set to be congruent with a US study\nof television watching and body composition in youth.14\nQuestionnaire-derived PA data tend to be positively\nskewed with mean values biased by a few subjects perform-\ning a lot of PA and/or a large number of subjects performing\nlittle or no PA.15 Therefore, descriptive data are presented for\nthe proportion reporting any defined PA, and the median\nand interquartile range (IQR) of distribution for those\nreporting any of the defined activity.\nVerbatim-reported activities were further classified as\nexercise/sport (eg basketball, running, dancing, etc) or\nnonexercise/sport (eg fetching water, scrubbing the floor,\ngardening). Median time (min/week) was determined for the\nproportion of youth (by gender) reporting >0 min in each\nexercise/sport classification. Gender differences in propor-\ntions were tested using w2 tests; differences in time in\nexercise/sport classification were tested using nonparametric\n(two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum) tests.\nThe five most frequently reported activities for each\ngender by school registration status were determined. For\nsubjects not registered in school but employed, the top five\nmost frequently reported job PA requirements were reported\nfor each gender. Since questioning strategies differed for\nthose not registered in school, statistical analysis was not\nused to test differences between school registration status or\ncurrent working status.\nConcordance study. Since the most complete PA question-\nnaire data were collected from those youth registered in\nPhysical activity in Filipino youth\nC Tudor-Locke et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nschool, the concordance study of the PA questionnaire\nfocused on the data obtained from this subgroup. Data were\nfurther reduced to include only those youth wearing the\nCaltrac for 22\u00ad26 h with a similar amount of time accounted\nfor in the 24-h recall. Reported activities for the 24-h PA\nrecall were assigned corresponding MET values following the\nsame process used for the questionnaire. Total time in MOD/\nVIG activities was computed for the 24-h recalled period.\nSince recalled data were positively skewed, nonparametric\ntests were used to determine differences in time in recalled\nPA between genders. Energy cost of 24-h recalled MOD/VIG\nactivities in kilocalories (kcal) was determined using indivi-\ndual body weight16 and compared with Caltrac-derived kcal.\nAccordingly, a 40 kg youth who recalled walking for 30 min\n60 min)). Descriptive data (expressed as medians with IQR)\nfor the 24-hr recall included the number of episodes and\nsummed time (minutes) recalled for the five most frequently\nrecalled MOD/VIG activities for each gender.\nCaltrac outputs (kcal) were corrected for 24 h of observa-\ntion. For example, if a subject expended 250 Caltrac-derived\nkcal in 23 recorded hours of wear, then it was assumed that\nSince Caltrac data were normally distributed, descriptive\ndata are presented as means 7 standard deviation (s.d.).\nSince operation of the Caltrac accelerometer requires input-\nting gender, age, height, and weight data, the relationship\nbetween the Caltrac output and the normally distributed\ncontinuous variables (in this case, height and weight) was\nexplored with Pearson product\u00admoment correlation coeffi-\ncients. Independent t-tests were used to determine differ-\nences in Caltrac outputs between genders. Adjusted\nSpearman rank order correlations were calculated between\nCaltrac PA kcal, 24-h recalled time in MOD, VIG, total MOD/\nVIG activities and total kcal expended, and PA data taken\nfrom the CLHNS questionnaire (time watching TV, time\nactive commuting, time in MOD/VIG activities during\nschool, time in MOD/VIG activities after school, and time\nin total MOD/VIG activities).\nResults\nTable 1 presents subjects' background and household\ndescriptive data. Among the youth registered in school\nto school, less than 1% (12 males and one female) rode\nfemales) used some combination of walking and motorized\ntransport. Three females (representing less than 1% of the\nsample) reported commuting to school by some other\nmeans.\nTable 2(a) and (b) displays the five most frequently\nreported activities performed during school or after school\n(for those registered in school) and at work and after work\n(for those not registered in school) according to the\nquestionnaire. Chores predominate for both genders, in\nand out of school. Frequently reported physical activities\nduring school were of MOD intensity or higher. Males\nreported marching during school whereas females reported\ndancing or exercise. Both genders reported working in the\ngarden at school. Washing dishes (males and females),\nwashing clothes (males and females), and cooking (females\nonly) were frequently reported physical activities after\nschool/work that were lower than MOD intensity according\nrespectively).10 Males frequently reported playing basketball/\nsoccer after school or work. In contrast, females did not\nfrequently report participation in sport/exercise after school\nor work. Fetching water was a frequent chore reported by all\nyouth on the questionnaire, but males reported pumping\nwater as a separate frequently performed activity.\nTable 3 presents the proportion of Filipino youth regis-\ntered in school engaged in any MOD/VIG activities,\nspecifically active commuting to school, and during and\nafter school activities (classified as exercise/sport or not). For\nthose who reported >0 min, Table 3 also displays median\ntime spent in these activities. Table 4 presents median time\n(min/week) spent in MOD/VIG activities by Filipino youth\nnot registered in school, stratified by gender and current\nworking status.

Similar relationships were observed in\nSpearman rank order correlation matrices of direct (Caltrac\nand 24-hour PA recall) and indirect measures (CHLNS\nquestionnaire variables) by gender are presented in Table 7.\nIn both genders, Caltrac PA kcal was inversely correlated\nwith time reported watching television and positively\ncorrelated with time reported spent active commuting, in\nafter-school MOD/VIG activities, and in total MOD/VIG\nactivities.\nDiscussion\nThe most frequently reported physical activities according\nto both the PA questionnaire and the 24-h recall were\nchores, both during and after school. Activities related to\nclassroom maintenance (sweeping, scrubbing, cleaning)\nwere most frequently reported for both genders during\nschool. Otherwise, males marched while females danced or\nexercised within school time. Both genders also reported\nworking in the school garden, a feature of the Filipino school\ncurriculum. After school/work, domestic duties predomi-\nnated for both genders. These findings are consistent with\nother reports of developing countries where children and\nyouth are regularly engaged in domestic tasks, especially\nfemales.7 Only males reported frequent participation after\nschool in sport/exercise (specifically basketball and soccer).\nExamined by time in activity, more males than females\nTable 7 Spearman rank order correlation matrix for youth registered in school\nDirect measurements\nIndirect measurement\n(questionnaire)\nMinutes in MOD activity r (P) Minutes in VIG activity r (P) Minutes in MOD/VIG activity r (P) Caltrac kcal r (P)\nSelect variables Males Females Males Females Males Females Males Females\nTotal MOD/VIG activities\n(min/week)\nTable 6 Principal MOD/VIG activities of concordance study samplea of Filipino youth (data derived from 24-h PA recall)\nActivity N (%) No. of episodes, median (IQR) Summed time in min, median (IQR)\nIQR, interquartile range\naConcordance study sample: currently registered in school, wore Caltrac 22\u00ad26 h and accounted for 22\u00ad26 h on 24-h recall.\nbPreparing to leave for school was coded as Compendium PA 05165; a 3 MET walking PA that includes getting ready to leave, shutting/locking doors, closing\nwindows, etc.\nPhysical activity in Filipino youth\nC Tudor-Locke et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nparticipated in exercise/sport activities both during and after\nschool.\nA total of 51% of the total Filipino sample reported no VIG\nactivities. This is compared with 36% of US high school\nBehaviour Surveillance System (YRBSS).17 The YRBSS focuses\non participation in sport/exercise activities and includes a\nsingle question querying frequency of walking/bicycle riding\nat least 30 min at a time. No questions address occupation,\nerrand, or chore-related activities. Discrepancies in preva-\nlence estimates between these two countries may be\nattributed to measurement bias; leisure-time physical activ-\nities (ie sport and exercise), as we understand them in a\nWestern context, are not common in developing countries.7\nA similarly constructed instrument (as the YRBSS) was used\nto survey Singapore youth about PA behaviors; prevalence\nestimates were not reported.18 If youth PA patterns in the\ndeveloping country of Singapore are similar to those of\nFilipino youth, then an instrument focusing primarily on\nsports and exercise would be inappropriate. The current\nstudy indicates that this conclusion is more valid for\nadolescent females than males. This point is consistent with\na study of West African adolescent females that reported\nleisure-time/personal activities consisted of a shower, hob-\nbies, eating, resting, and social activities but not sport or\nexercise.7\nFilipino males reported watching television a median of\n2.3 h/day, significantly greater than the 1.8 h/day reported\nby females. In comparison, Singapore youth engage in 2\u00ad4 h\nof multimedia usage daily (combined television, video, or\ncomputer) with equal viewing time patterns between males\nreported watching television !2 h/day;14 48% of Filipino\nyouth watch television !2 h/day. Relatively few (7%) Filipino\nyouth (with the exception of females not currently registered\nin school or working) watch very high levels of daily\ntelevision, defined as !4 h/day. Comparatively, 26% of US\nyouth watched !4 h/day of television.14 Differences in\nmeasurement approaches used in studying these different\ncountries make more direct comparisons difficult. Apparent\ndifferences may also reflect television programming rele-\nvance and appeal or cultural differences in viewing habits.\nFor example, within Filipino communities, television own-\nership is not a prerequisite for television watching as people\nmay gather at the home of whoever has a television.\nRegardless, such high levels of inactive leisure pursuits are\nof concern. In the US, children who watch !4 h/day of\ntelevision have a greater BMI and greater body fat than\nchildren who watch less than 2 h/day.14 It will be important\nto follow international trends in PA and obesity, as television\nownership peaks and relevant and appealing programming\nincreases over time.\nCaltrac-derived energy expenditure as a result of PA was\nlargely modulated by gender, weight, and height in this\nrelatively homogenous sample with respect to age. This\nfinding is consistent with the results of a doubly labeled\nwater study in an ethnically diverse sample that included\nyouth from Guatemala;19 energy expenditure attributed\nsolely to PA in that study was positively related to weight,\nand both fat and fat-free mass. A review of several cross-\nsectional studies20 emphasizes that obese children are less\nphysically active compared to nonobese peers, but that a\ndifference in total energy expenditure is less apparent owing\nto confounding by body weight. Since energy expenditure is\nnot synonymous with PA,21,22 validation in this study\nreflects concordance between measures of different con-\nstructs with overlapping or shared dimensions. Relationships\nbetween the various methods of PA assessment used were\nstatistically significant and in the expected direction,\nlending confidence to the validity of the questionnaire used.\nThe primary caveat to interpretation is that correlation is\naffected by sample size; with very large samples small\ncorrelation coefficients will be statistically significant.\nInterestingly, walking was the most frequently reported PA\naccording to the 24-h recall, but not on the questionnaire.\nThis discrepancy is likely because of the perceived salience of\nwalking activities relative to the time frame questioned. The\n24-h recall asked youth to list details of every PA (physical or\nnot) engaged in over 1 day in recent memory. For example, if\na respondent indicated that s/he ``walked to fetch water and\npumped it,'' three separate physical activities would be\ncoded (walk, fetch water, pump water). In contrast, the\nquestionnaire asked what types of physical activities were\ntypically performed over a usual week. Thus, implicit in\nfetching water was walking and pumping. Walking was not\nspecifically queried on the questionnaire other than with\nregard to active commuting to school. Regardless, walking\n(in all its forms) is considered the least reliably recalled\nPA assessed by self-report.23\u00ad25 This is another example of\nthe potential benefit of combining objective monitoring\ndevices that are sensitive to walking with self-report methods\nof PA. PA data may be better interpreted from both\nperspectives.\nIt is anticipated that as modernization and technological\nadvancement continue in this developing country, the\nprimary sources of PA (chores and active commuting) will\ndecrease. Unless there is a concomitant increase in leisure-\ntime activities, a rise in the prevalence of obesity is expected.\nHalting modernization is not a likely option for prevention.\nMore viable approaches include implementing policies that\nfacilitate a healthy amount of daily incidental PA (eg public\ntransportation policies, walkable communities, car taxes) in\naddition to promoting attractive active leisure-time alter-\nnatives (eg community and cultural events, school physical\neducation, parks and greenspaces). Such strategies may be of\nmost importance to Filipino females who currently partici-\npate in relatively few active leisure-time activities.\nIn summary, assessed using a multi-method approach and\nconsistent with international understanding,26 gender\ndifferences exist for type, frequency, and duration of physical\nactivities performed by Filipino youth. The primary sources\nof PA for this population are chores and active commuting.\nPhysical activity in Filipino youth\nC Tudor-Locke et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nThese types of activities are likely to decrease as moderniza-\ntion continues. The impact of changes in youth PA patterns\nand relevant health outcomes will continue to be studied\nlongitudinally in this developing country as attempts are\nmade to understand how these PA patterns change with the\ntransition to adulthood and how they relate to obesity and\nother health problems.\n"
