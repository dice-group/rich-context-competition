    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this article, we define precognition as an atypical perceptual ability that allows the acquisition of non-inferential information\narising from a future point in spacetime. The Multiphasic Model of Precognition (MMPC) identifies two distinct phases: The\nfirst is the physics domain, which addresses the question of retrocausation and how it is possible for information to traverse\nfrom one spacetime point to another. We suggest that the solution might be found within entropic considerations. The\nsecond is the neuroscience domain, which addresses the acquisition and interpretation of retrocausal signals. We propose\nthat this occurs across three stages: (a) perception of signals from an information carrier, based on psychophysical variability\nin a putative signal transducer; (b) cortical processing of the signals, mediated by a cortical hyper-associative mechanism; and\n(c) cognition, mediated by normal cognitive processes, leading to a response based on retrocausal information. The model is\ncomprehensive, brain-based, and provides a new direction for research requiring multidisciplinary expertise.\n",

The inability to understand the\nnature of the experience, based on prevailing zeitgeists and a\ndualistic understanding of mind/consciousness (Marwaha &\nMay, 2015b), has led to ESP being interpreted as a paranor-\nmal ability.\nAcceptance and increased interest in the applied aspects\nof ESP were evidenced by the U.S. government's funding of\nwith defense contractors Stanford Research Institute (SRI)\nInternational and Science Applications International\nCorporation. The U.S. government established an in-house\neffort to apply ESP to problems of national interest during\nthe Cold War. This effort is best known by the program's last\nnickname, Star Gate. Practical examples showed that, if used\nproperly, ESP garnered limited, but sometimes critical, suc-\ncesses in intelligence gathering during the Cold War (May,\nRubel, & Auerbach, 2014). Unlike traditional academic\nresearch, the intelligence community was result-oriented: As\nlong as the data, when combined appropriately with other\nassets, provided useful information, the data were considered\nvalid. For some researchers, this provides evidence enough\nfor the existence of ESP.Although it remains a logical impos-\nsibility for many skeptics, for others, it is a logical possibility\n(Corry, 2015). In the Star Gate program, research was carried\nout in various aspects of ESP by investigating potential\nmechanisms such as that contained in physics, neuroscience,\npsychological factors, and fine tuning research protocols and\nstatistical applications for analysis of data. The results drawn\nfrom formerly classified1 300 technical reports and experi-\nmental data can briefly be summarized as follows: (a) There\nis statistical evidence for an information transfer anomaly\nthat we currently do not understand, (b) the second law of\nthermodynamics and the gradient of Shannon entropy are\namong factors that may influence the information transfer,\nand (c) the phenomenon so far resists training for excellence;\nrather, it is observed to be an innate ability in some individu-\nals (May & Marwaha, 2014). As the SRI meta-analysis has\nshown, \"At this time, there is no quantitative evidence to\nsupport a training hypothesis,\" that is, training for remote\nviewing ability is not effective (May, Utts, et al., 1989, p. 2).\nthe term \"anomalous cognition\" (AC) to refer to ESP phe-\nnomena. According to them, the earlier definitions of ESP\n1The Laboratories for Fundamental Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nEdwin C.

The \"anom-\naly\" in AC refers to our insufficient understanding of the\nprocess of AC, rather than its validity. ESP/psi/psychic expe-\nriences are the most popular terms as understood by the lay\ncommunity.\nAC research, particularly in the last 30 years, has accumu-\nlated sufficient evidence to establish the existence of infor-\nmation transfer through processes that we are only now\nbeginning to understand. Although it is beyond the scope of\nthis article to provide a complete analysis of the substantial\namount of experimental and theoretical work that has been\ncarried out worldwide since the 1930s, research across labo-\nratories provides statistical evidence for an information\ntransfer anomaly. Table 1 shows the most relevant set of\nmeta-analyses of various experimental AC paradigms.\nIt is not our intention to provide irrefutable evidence of\nAC; rather, we provide references from which this table was\ngenerated, to demonstrate that a substantial experimental\ndatabase exists that meets the standards of critical scientific\nmethodology. The meta-analyses in Table 1 take into account\nreasonable \"file drawer\" estimates (Iyengar & Greenhouse,\nBeginning in the 1970s, the research paradigm shifted\nfrom forced-choice studies to free-response methodologies.\nSome of these gave the first laboratory evidence for free-\nresponse precognition (PC) under strict laboratory condi-\ntions. Researchers examined various internal noise reduction\nmethods such as dreaming (Krippner, Ullman, & Honorton,\nPuthoff and Targ (1974) further modernized a concept from\ncalled remote viewing (RV). The references above are not\nmeant to be exhaustive; rather, they provide a flavor of these\ntypes of data.\nIn traditional remote viewing studies (Puthoff & Targ,\ndrive from the laboratory and drives to that location and\nremains there for approximately 15 min. An experimenter\nthen asks a participant to provide a description in words\nand drawings of a location that they would visit within an\nhour. The experimenter and participant of course are blind\nto that location. The assistant then returns to the laboratory\nand escorts the participant back to the site as a form of\nfeedback. Blind, rank-order quantitative analysis that com-\npares each response to the set of selected targets is carried\nout to assess the degree to which there is statistical evi-\ndence for PC (see May & Marwaha, 2014, for methodolog-\nical details).\nPrecognition--The Only Form of ESP\nWe present a brief rationale for our assertion that PC is the\nonly form of ESP (Marwaha & May, in preparation). First,\nwe offer a formal definition of PC based on the proposed\nmodel:\nPrecognition is an atypical perceptual ability that allows the\nacquisition of non-inferential information arising from a future\npoint in spacetime.2\nTable 1.

ESP = extrasensory perception.\nMarwaha and May 3\nFor two future points in spacetime, insufficient time has\nelapsed between them to allow for any causal relationship.\nProcedurally, in ESP experiments, it means that target\nstimuli are randomly generated after data collection is\ncomplete.\nClearly, PC has been substantially investigated and docu-\nmented (e.g., Honorton & Ferrari, 1989) and all the prestim-\nulus response and presentiment studies in which the stimuli\nare randomly generated post response (e.g., Mossbridge,\nTressoldi, & Utts, 2012). This list of studies, although not\nexhaustive, nonetheless, does provide substantial evidence\nfor PC.\nHowever, it might be argued that the substantial database\nexperiments including ganzfeld, remote viewing, and other\nESP studies wherein the target stimuli are available at the\ntime of data collection appear to provide a substantial set of\ndata that are not PC by definition. However, in these studies,\na participant may still have access to the target stimuli via\nPC. Feedback--associating a given trial with a given stimu-\nlus--regardless of to whom it is given and when, or even\nstored in a computer, provides a future-oriented possible\nsource for the ESP data (May, Lantz, & Piantineda,\nthis point that it is difficult or, perhaps, impossible to close\nthe future PC door.

The effect size for the\nThus, our assertion that PC is the only form of ESP stands\non solid ground so that it can serve as an axiom for the\nMultiphasic Model of Precognition (MMPC).\nThe Fundamental Questions in Precognition\nPC research examines the subjective experience of acquiring\ninformation from a future spacetime point. The fascination\nwith this aspect of human cognition focused early research\non the experiencer and the resulting experience. However, as\nresearchers delved further into the problem, it became appar-\nent that the picture was far larger than just human experi-\nence. The PC experience was a manifestation of far more\nfundamental questions--the nature of time, causality, and\ninformation. Thus, PC research, in its essence, addresses the\nfundamental problems of the direction of time, causality, and\ninformation flow (Marwaha & May, 2015a; May & Marwaha,\nThe most important and difficult questions in PC research\nare when, where, and how this information transfer occurs\nfrom a distant point in spacetime? Furthermore, what is the\ninformation carrier, and what are its properties? Answers to\nthese questions will help determining in which sensory sys-\ntem, if any, the carrier energy is being converted into electro-\nchemical signals. What is the transmission rate (bits/symbol)\nof the data, and what is its limit? At what point does the\napparent stochastic nature of the information occur: Is it at\nthe source, transmission, or at the detection point?\nIn addition, other questions include the following: Who\npossesses PC ability and why? Why can we not train for\ndeveloping a PC ability? Confidence calling is problematic\ngenerally; however, a recent statistical approach--figure-of-\nmerit--has shown promise (May, 2007). Why do we not see\nstable central nervous system (CNS) correlates for PC? Why\nmay personality correlations appear more as a procedural\nartifact rather than as something fundamental?\nThese and more questions have emerged in the 150 years\nof research in this field. Developing a model with so many\nblank spaces in the data is a challenging task; nevertheless,\nwe have enough to begin that process.\nMMPC\nAs with advances in any field, new developments are based\non the historical past and current thinking. We acknowledge\nthe foundations--across disciplines--on which this model is\nbased. Before proceeding with the model, we first introduce\nand clarify our temporal-based terminology.\nFigure 1 divides time into three parts: past, present, and\nfuture as viewed from a single reference frame. In this arti-\ncle, we adopt terminology from the future-centered per-\nspective (i.e., top half of Figure 1) because there is\nconsiderable interest in physics whether it is possible to\ninfluence the present by a future action. The term that is\nwidely used in physics for this concept is retrocausation\n(RC; Sheehan, 2011). RC is the notion that an event in the\nfuture can influence the present, and it is not that the pres-\nent can influence the past. We thus use the terms RC and RC\nsignals to refer to this temporal, information-centered per-\nspective for putative signals that originated from a future\npoint in spacetime. The bottom half of Figure 1 shows a\npresent-time, person-centered perspective, which is PC. We\nnotice that it is impossible for the present to affect or change\nthe past.\nFigure 1. The prefix retro means action or information from the\nfuture affecting the present.\n4 SAGE Open\nDefining the Problem Space\nThe MMPC is a signal-based, process-oriented model\ndesigned to determine the causal mechanisms leading to the\nexperience of PC. As a starting point, we have formally\ndefined the problem space of PC by considering two phases.\nPhase I falls exclusively within the physics domain (PD).\nIt addresses the question, \"How is it possible that informa-\ntion can go between two spacetime points and be used, espe-\ncially if the two points are acausally separated?\" It is related\nto how information is carried from an external source, which\nis distant in time and space, to the percipient.\nPhase II falls entirely within the neuroscience domain\n(ND)--internal to the human percipient. It addresses the\nexperiential part of the problem, that is, how the information\nis acquired by a putative sensory system, how this informa-\ntion is processed in the brain, and how it is expressed. We\ndefine the acquiring mechanism as a transition between the\nPD and ND.\nUsing vision as an analogy, Phase I consists of an electro-\nmagnetic (EM) carrier providing informational signals at the\nspeed of light. Photons strike the retina (i.e., transition\nbetween PD and ND for vision), which converts the EM\nenergy into electrochemical signals that are processed by the\nbrain (Phase II).\nThese domains divide the problem space within which a\nsolution for the complex problem of PC can be addressed.\nThese further consist of multiple discrete stages that can be\nexamined independently. Intrinsic to this perspective is that\ndifferent processes are involved in each phase and at different\nstages, which finally result in a conscious experience of PC.\nThe MMPC addresses both the PD and the ND by consid-\nering the well-established laws of the physical world and what\nwe currently know--and will know--about brain\u00adbehavior\nrelationships. Thus, the MMPC is a coherent assimilation of\nexisting concepts that we believe can lead to understanding the\nprocess of PC--from the point of information origin to cogni-\ntion. Although PC researchers have been examining both\ndomains, the importance of formally dividing the process into\ntwo domains permits allocation of problems to their respective\ndisciplines. Thus, researchers need not step out of their area of\nexpertise, enabling them to address the questions and formu-\nlate experimental hypotheses within their domain of profi-\nciency.As we will see in the details below, each segment of the\ntotal PC experience requires a different set of questions and\nexpertise. In doing so, it may be possible to obtain answers to\none segment, without knowing the details of another. For\ninstance, we may understand how the brain processes infor-\nmation, but we may not know how information is carried\nacross spacetime until physicists are able to decipher that\nproblem. We now consider the two phases in detail.\nPhase I: The Physics Domain\nPhase I falls within the PD. As stated, it addresses the ques-\ntion, \"How is it possible for information to propagate between\ntwo acausally separated points and be acted upon?\" It is related\nto how information is carried from an external source, which\nis distant in time and space, to the percipient. Although the\ndetails are beyond the scope of this article, we present a brief\noverview of this domain, to indicate to the reader that there are\nexperimental and theoretical bases for the question of how\ninformation is carried across spacetime, that is, from there\nThe primacy of entropy. As with any model development, we\nfirst must consider what data the model must be capable of\nexplaining. Because some experiments show that the quality\nof PC is significantly correlated with changes of entropy of\nsome aspect of entropy or its gradients will yield an under-\nstanding of the PD.\nThe concept of entropy arose from classical thermody-\nnamics. Although the mathematics of various theories rap-\nidly becomes difficult, the conceptual framework is rather\nstraightforward. One approach is to think of entropy as a\nmeasure of chaos or to the related idea of uncertainty. Ice, for\nexample, has much lower entropy than water. Why? Because\nthe molecules of water in liquid form are bouncing around in\na chaotic fashion, whereas in ice, these same molecules are\nall lined in an ordered array we call a crystal. Also, in liquid\nwater, the position of a given molecule is very uncertain,\nwhereas in ice, the position of a molecule is far more certain\nas it is trapped in a crystal and is not going anywhere (May\nA related concept comes to us as the second law of ther-\nmodynamics, which states that for isolated systems, entropy\ncannot decrease. Suppose you knock a glass (ordered sys-\ntem) to the floor and it shatters (i.e., a transition from low\ninto higher entropy). Now imagine picking up the pieces,\nplacing them on the table, and then knocking them to the\nfloor again as a bunch. What happens? The second law of\nthermodynamics tells us that the entropy can never decrease,\nwhich is what must happen if the shattered pieces are to\nassemble themselves into a glass when they hit the floor\nA closely related term is Shannon entropy. Building on\nand Weaver (1949) developed what is now called the\ninformation theory. This concept formalizes the intuitive\nidea of information that there is more \"information\" in\nrare events, such as winning the lottery, than in common\nones, such as taking a breath. Shannon and Weaver defined\nthe entropy for a given system as the weighted average of\nthe probability of occurrence of all possible events in the\nsystem. Entropy, used in this sense, is defined as a mea-\nsure of our uncertainty, or lack of information, about a\nsystem.\nMarwaha and May 5\nIn sensory systems, receptor cells are sensitive to incident\nenergy regardless of \"meaning,\" which is ascribed as a later\ncognitive function. Shannon entropy is also devoid of mean-\ning. Pixel analysis in photographs, for example, ignores any-\nthing to do with cognitive features. One way to think about\nthis is that each pixel has no information from its neighbor-\ning pixels (Tononi, 2012). From this point of view, a photo-\ngraphofanuclearblastis,perhaps,nomoreShannon-entropic\nthan a photograph of a kitten; it all depends on the pixel\nintensities, which were used to create the photographs (May\nOne important clue for why entropy is so important for\nPC was provided during the Star Gate program. During that\ntime, the team noticed that there was a class of operational\nPC missions involving intelligence gathering or simulations\nthereof, which appeared never to fail. These included under-\nground nuclear tests, stores of radioactive material, EM pulse\ndevices, static and dynamic rocket motor tests, and rocket\ndetails). For example, Figure 2 shows the complete AC\nresponse to a static rocket motor test.\nFigure 3 shows a schematic drawing of the site and a\nrecent Google Earth photo of the site 35 years later. What the\nparticipant labeled a \"rain-making\" machine is something\nthat is common on such tests. Water is sprayed on the motor\nduring the test to keep it from overheating. Figure 4 shows a\nmodern test firing for comparison. The important point of\nthis example is that the rocket motor was initially in a rela-\ntively low entropy state prior to the ignition and a high\nentropy state during the test.\nOne possible explanation might be that these target types\nshare a physical attribute; they all involve enormous expen-\nditures of energy in a short period. Of course, the first thing\nthat comes to mind is that somehow these short bursts radiate\nenergy in such a way that the CNS of the participants\nresponds accordingly--a traditional sensory explanation.\nHowever, this cannot account for the numerous examples\nwhen the remote viewing was carried out precognitively, that\nis, before the actual event had occurred.\nA second observation the model must cover is that there is\nan apparent entropic limit to the quality of the PC data (May,\nwhether that limit is imposed at the source, transfer, or detec-\ntion mechanism, or some combination of them.\nThe data of RC itself provide support for entropy being\nthe prime candidate for Phase I (seeMay & Marwaha,\n2014). These data suggest that at the macroscopic level, it\nis possible to obtain information from some non-inferential\nevent in the future. This, of course, violates the rules of\nmacroscopic causality and the profound understanding that\nFigure 2. Annotated response to a static rocket motor test in Utah.\n6 SAGE Open\ntime moves in one direction only. Yet, at the microscopic\nlevel (i.e., atoms, molecules), the equations of motion are\nall symmetric in time. In other words, time could move for-\nward or backward, and the collisions of molecules stay the\nsame.\nThis apparent paradox has been resolved now for more\nthan a century. At the macroscopic level, time moves in one\ndirection as a consequence of the second law of thermody-\nnamics. This law has not yet been violated. It is beyond the\nscope of this article to provide technical support of this state-\nment, but the textbooks of any mid-level collegiate course in\nphysics, thermodynamics, or statistical mechanics will pro-\nvide the details.\nThe argument for entropy as a PD candidate can be sum-\nmarized as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 the quality of RC data correlates significantly with\nentropic gradients of the target stimuli;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 the second law of thermodynamics can account for the\napparent paradox of time between the microscopic\nand macroscopic perspectives.\nEntropy gradients have also been used extensively to\nunderstand two traditional forms of information transfer--\nvisual and acoustic. In the realm of audio, for example, an\nindex of speech intelligibility is the cochlea-scaled entropy\n(Stilp, Kiefte, Alexander, & Kluender, 2007). In addition,\nspectral change, as measured by cochlea-scaled entropy, pre-\ndicts speech intelligibility better than the information carried\nby vowels or consonants in sentences (Fei & Loizou, 2012).\nHigh Shannon entropy of musical phrases affects the uncer-\ntainty of determining musical pitch (Hansen & Pearce, 2012).\nIn the visual arena, it appears that neuronal structures in the\nCNS take advantage of statistical aspects of subareas of the\nvisual scene to enhance visual recognition (Gerhard,\nWichmann, & Bethge, 2013); that is, sensory representations\nare adapted to the statistical regularities in sensory signals\nand thereby incorporate knowledge about the outside world.\nIn addition, entropy masking of a visual stimulus is related to\nlearnability; that is, high entropic masks make it difficult to\nunderstand visual stimuli (Delaigle, Devleeschouwer, Macq,\n& Langendijk, 2002). These references concerning entropy\nand the visual and auditory systems are not exhaustive and are\nFigure 4. Modern static test with \"rain-making machine.\"\nNote. Exiting water is in lower right of the image.\nFigure 3. Schematic drawing of test facility and a current Google Earth photo of the site.\nNote. The box in the upper portion of the photo represents the location of the geographical coordinates.\nMarwaha and May 7\npresented only as representative samples to illustrate the\nimportance of entropy considerations in the understanding of\nthe signal characteristics to the normal sensory systems.\nNorwich (2005) provides a succinct summary of the tight\nrelationship between physical entropy and the sensory\nsystems:\nWith reference to two specific modalities of sensation, the taste\nof saltiness of chloride salts, and the loudness of steady tones, it\nis shown that the laws of sensation (logarithmic and power laws)\nare expressions of the entropy per mole of the stimulus. That is,\nthe laws of sensation are linear functions of molar entropy. In\npartial verification of this hypothesis, we are able to derive an\napproximate value for the gas constant, a fundamental physical\nconstant, directly from psychophysical measurements. The\nsignificance of our observation lies in the linking of the\nphenomenon of \"sensation\" directly to a physical measure. It\nsuggests that if the laws of physics are universal, the laws of\nsensation and perception are similarly universal. [Emphasis\nadded]. It also connects the sensation of a simple, steady physical\nsignal with the molecular structure of the signal: the greater the\nnumber of microstates or complexions of the stimulus signal, the\ngreater the magnitude of the sensation (saltiness or loudness).\n(Abstract)\nMost of the sample articles cited above are based on labo-\nratory experiments. Because the known sensory systems\nappear to be sensitive to entropic changes at their sensory\n\"front ends,\" we feel it is not a surprise to find PC too is\nsensitive to entropic changes of the stimuli. As further sup-\nport for proposing that the PD for PC will be understood in\nterms of entropy, we describe one theoretical article on the\nfundamental aspect of entropy.\nVerlinde (2011) was able to derive the classical dynamic\nequations of Newton including his famous equation for the\ngravitational force between two particles from entropic con-\nsiderations only. These computations were carried out com-\npletely within the classical or semi-classical domains; that is,\nneither quantum mechanics nor general relativity was neces-\nsary for the calculations. He did develop the idea of an entro-\npic force. This entropic force is like all other forces in that it\nis a spatial gradient of some potential. In addition, Verlinde\nwas able to derive, again from first principles and gradients\nof entropy, the Einstein field equations of general relativity.\nThe important point here is the supremacy of entropy as a\nphysical concept. In fact, Verlinde goes so far to suggest that\nit is time to retire gravity as one of the four known funda-\nmental forces in that he shows that gravity itself is an emer-\ngent property of the more fundamental aspects of entropy\nand thermodynamics. Verlinde's work has spawned great\ninterest in the fundamental nature of entropy.\nFinal considerations for the physics domain. We have noted that\nthere is considerable experimental evidence that suggests\nentropic gradients may be important in understanding the\nPD; however, with regard to mechanisms, signal carriers,\nand transducers, the evidence is circumstantial. Clearly,\nmore work is needed. For example, there is a critical test of\nwaha, in preparation). In that study, they treat thermody-\nnamic entropic gradients at physical targets (as opposed to\nphotographic targets) as an independent variable and the\nquality of the resulting PC as a dependent variable. This\nexperiment will add valuable insights into Phase I.\nPhase II: The Neuroscience Domain (ND)\nBackground. Since the early 1940s, numerous attempts have\nbeen made to correlate laboratory-based PC performance\nwith individual differences in participants' personality and\nattitudinal characteristics to identify the underlying pro-\ncesses. Researchers have extensively explored various\ndimensions, such as beliefs and attitudes, moods, states of\nmind, and personality variables. Extraversion has been one\nof the most widely explored dimensions of personality in\nrelation to ESP. In a meta-analysis of 60 independent stud-\nies examining extraversion\u00adESP relationship, Honorton,\nlarge n. Even that correlation was thought to arise only due\nto the free-response data, in that extraverted participants did\nbetter than introverted participants did. The correlations of\nESP with personality variables as reported are unstable in\nthat they have not shown to be effective in identifying peo-\nple with a PC ability, as they are not systematic, are not\neasily replicable, and contain a confound in the data collec-\ntion methodology. In our analysis, the participant pool is\nbiased toward extraverts, as most of the studies use self-\nselected volunteers as participants. In addition, cognitive\nprocesses such as memory and subliminal perception have\nbeen examined for their relation to ESP (seeRao, 2011, for\noverview).\nAs the Star Gate program was tasked for applications, the\nneed to develop an effective tool to identify people with good\nPC ability was of paramount interest. In initial studies, the\nMyers\u00adBriggs Type Inventory, Q-sort (Block, 1961), and the\nPersonality Assessment System (Krauskopf & Saunders,\n1994), which uses the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale as a\nbehavioral measure of personality, were investigated for\ntheir potential use as screening tools (Humphrey, Lantz, &\nmethods was predictive of PC ability; the general conclusion\nwas that the best technique for identifying people with PC\nskills is assessing them on PC tasks. This notion is supported\nin a meta-analysis of 309 forced-choice PC experiments by\nHonorton and Ferrari (1989) who report \"studies using sub-\njects selected on the basis of prior testing performance show\nsignificantly larger effects than studies using unselected sub-\n8 SAGE Open\nNeurophysiological studies using technologies of the day,\nincluding electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencepha-\nlography (MEG; May, Luke, & Frivold, 1988; May et al.,\nTarg, Puthoff, & May, 1976), and functional magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (fMRI; Moulton & Kosslyn, 2009) have been\nused to investigate the cortical correlates of PC. To summa-\nrize the results of May and associates, (a) there were no stable\nconcomitant neural activities that seemed to occur during the\npoint of time when PC was supposed to have occurred. As\nunderstanding of the phenomena increased, they realized that\nthis was probably due to the fact that we could not determine\nwhen exactly the participant had received the information that\nhe was providing (i.e., before or during the test situation); (b)\nwe were, and are, still not sure about the form of energy car-\nrier for RC signals. This implies that we were, and are, essen-\ntially searching for the proverbial needle in the haystack of\nneural pathways. For starters, Persinger's (2015) extensive\nstudies with PC-abled participants have implicated the right\ntemporoparietal lobe as instrumental in their abilities.\nAs in the PD, we first must consider what data the ND of\nthe model must be capable of explaining. We begin, there-\nfore, with the appropriate observables assumed true:\nSpecifically, PC ability is seen in varying levels of profi-\nciency across the population, and no stable CNS and psycho-\nlogical correlates aside from a performance-based measure\non a PC task have been observed.\nPhase II of the model refers to the processes that occur\nonce the signals from any external source, including RC sig-\nnals, have reached the percipient's CNS, and the processes\nthat occur from perception to cognition of that data. This\nphase is primarily an implicit process. The MMPC decon-\nstructs this domain into three discrete but fluid stages: (a)\nStage 1--perception of RC signals from an energy carrier,\n(b) Stage 2--cortical processing of RC signals, and (c)\nStage 3--cognition. One aspect of our model is that Stages\n1 and 2 are critically different from normal perception in\nPC, following which, in Stage 3, normal processing occurs\nas it does for any other sensory input. Figure 5 illustrates the\nprocess of PC.\nStage 1: Perception of retrocausal signals.An important ele-\nment in the process of PC is the presence of a signal trans-\nducer to serve as an interface between the incoming signals\nand the processing of that data. For example, the visual\nreceptors in the retina are the transducers for signals from the\nvisible EM spectrum. We can keep the nature of a putative\nPC channel an open question until we have a better under-\nstanding of the PD. Nevertheless, we can work under the\nassumption that PC information is received and processed\ninternally in the same manner as are signals impinging on\nother sensory systems. As the nature of the putative RC sig-\nnal is presently unknown, we have to assume that it is differ-\nent from the normal thresholds perceived by us. This requires\nus to consider a possible variation in the transducer and the\nprocessing mechanisms.\nHypothesis of psychophysical variability in a signal trans-\nducer (Hypothesis 1.1).\nThis hypothesis poses that psychophysical variability both in\nCNS extent and function can account for variation in the\nreception of RC signals; that is, some individuals demon-\nstrate a PC ability, whereas others do not. Approximately 1%\nof the general population possesses a natural remote viewing\nyears of experimental work, PC ability is seen in varying lev-\nels of proficiency across the population, much like the vary-\ning levels of music ability for example.\nThis hypothesis suggests that individuals with PC ability\nare different from those without it at the level of sensory\ninput as follows: The RC signal is acquired by those with PC\nability due to a possible variation in a putative biological\ntransducer, which is the point where external signals are\ntransformed into biochemical/bioelectrical sensory signals\nand transmitted to the cortical structures where cognition\noccurs. These signals are connected and processed across\nmultiple cortical areas, which is part of Stage 2 of the MMPC\nas described in the following section. The question of what\nthe transducer is will be determined by our understanding of\nthe PD. (We note that this is the only part of the ND that is\ndependent on the PD. From Stage 2 onward, the ND is inde-\npendent of any PD considerations.)\nThis hypothesis is based on the fact that individual differ-\nences are the sine qua non of biological and psychological\nobserve, \"In the neuroscience of human behavior and cogni-\ntion, inter-individual differences are often treated as a source\nof `noise' and therefore discarded through averaging data\nfrom a group of participants.\" Thus, examining the variations\nin this \"noise\" is of utmost relevance for identifying the PC\nability in accordance with the MMPC.\nFigure 5. Phases I and II of precognition.\nNote. RC = retrocausation.\nMarwaha and May 9\nResearch in individual variations in the visual domain\nlends theoretical support for this hypothesis. Tahmasebi et al.\n(2012) report on the variability of functional organization\nrelative to brain anatomy. A two- to threefold inter-individual\nvariation in size of the visual cortex is seen in humans, a\nvariation that could lead to substantial difference in visual\nability. Similarly, variations in number of axons in the optic\nnerve, number of retinal ganglion cells in a single eye, and\nthe density of photoreceptors in the retina are also seen\n(Hofer, Carroll, Neitz, Neitz, & Williams, 2005; Kee, Koo,\nJi, & Kim, 1997; Quigley, Brown, Morrison, & Drance,\n& Smith, 1991), including the presence of tetrachromacy or\neven pentachromacy (Neitz, Carroll, Yamauchi, Neitz, &\ntery of tests that included orientation discrimination, wave-\nlength sensitivity, contrast sensitivity, vernier acuity,\ndirection-of-motion detection, and velocity discrimination,\nHalpern, Andrews, and Purves (1999) found that there was\nsignificant inter-individual difference in visual ability, which\ncould be the result of inter-individual variation in the amount\nof neural circuitry devoted to vision. These variations in the\ncortical structures and the retina--the visual system trans-\nducer--provide a basis for considering the presence of PC\nability and the individual differences seen in that ability.\nAs experimental results and theoretical considerations\nhave shown, the RC-signal carrier cannot be mediated by\nEM waves (Targ, May, et al., 1976). Nevertheless, we open\nthis door slightly to permit the possibility of variations in the\ntraditional sensory transducers, in that perhaps CNS struc-\ntures that are adjacent to expanded sensory sensitivity are\ninvolved in the detection of RC signals. We emphasize that\nwe are not proposing, therefore, that PC is carried on any EM\nwave regardless of its frequency.\nThe final processing of the RC signals thus obtained\noccurs in the brain, just as the brain is the final frontier for\ncolor perception. This leads us to Stage 2 of the ND.\nStage 2: Cortical processing of RC signals. Stage 2 of the model\ninvolves the processing of RC signals received as hypothe-\nsized in Stage 1.\nHypothesis of cortical hyper-associative mechanism\nConsidering the possible variation in the nature of an RC\nsignal, we may assume that it has characteristics that are dif-\nferent from known signals, and thus propose that RC signals\nare processed via a cross-modal mechanism leading to a PC\nexperience. We consider this notion by formulating the\nhypothesis of cortical hyper-associative mechanism\nCortical hyper-connectivity has recently been associated\nwith atypical perceptual abilities such as synesthesia\n(H\u00e4nggi, Beeli, Oechslin, & J\u00e4ncke, 2008; Ramachandran &\n2013) and savant skills in autism (Wallace, Happ\u00e9, & Giedd,\n2009). Hence, we borrow the term hyper-associative mecha-\nnism as used by Simner (2012) for describing the possible\nunderlying mechanisms for synesthesia. As Simner states,\n[there may be] one of any number of [original emphasis] possible\nneurological processes that might give rise to the \"open channel\"\nbetween different brain regions, which allows sound to be\ninterpreted as colour, taste as touch, touch as smell, and so on. In\nfact, this neutral term should cover not one of several possible\nmechanisms, but rather, one or more of these possibilities . . .\nWhether a functional connection is established by hyper-\nconnectivity, by disinhibited pathways, by other means, or\nindeed, a combination of these, the outcome is the opening of a\ncommunication between regions that would otherwise not\ndirectly interact to produce a conscious experience in the\naverage person. (p. 25)\nConsidering the possibility of a similarity in underlying\nmechanisms between synesthesia and the proposed internal\nPC mechanism, in our view, the synesthete population may\nbe a good point to start for examining this hypothesis.\nHowever, a crucial distinction between synesthesia and PC\nexperiences is that synesthetic experiences apparently may\noccur in the absence of an external signal. As Sean Day (per-\nsonal communication, 3 January, 2014) stated, \"Synesthesia\ndoes not convey information of any reality; it adds one or\nmore non-real perceptions to an initial inducing perception\nwhich may (or may not) be based upon reality.\" PC experi-\nences, as we propose here, arise due to the presence of exter-\nnal signals. Others have also claimed that synesthesia may\nactually underpin ESP experiences (e.g., Alvarado, 1994;\nFurther support for this hypothesis comes from a variety\nof atypical perceptual abilities. For instance, Loui, Li,\nHohmann, and Schlaug (2011) showed that people with the\nability to recognize absolute pitch (AP) possess higher\nwhite matter connectivity in temporal lobe regions respon-\nsible for the perception and association of pitch. These\nhyper-connected regions include the posterior superior and\nmiddle temporal gyri in both left and right hemispheres.\nAP possessors had significantly higher tract volume than\nnon-AP individuals. Bermudez and Zatorre (2009) suggest\nthat AP performance exists along a continuum. Ashwin,\nAshwin, Rhydderch, Howells, and Baron-Cohen (2009)\nreport that significantly enhanced perceptual functioning,\nabout 2.79 times better than the average, and attention to\ndetail, also known as eagle-eyed visual acuity, is seen in\nsome persons with autism spectrum conditions. The mech-\nanism for this may be at the level of neural hyper-\nexcitation and is likely governed by factors that give rise to\nnormal variation in visual acuity in typically developing\nindividuals. They speculate that this may be due to atypi-\ncally high numbers of foveal cone cells or to dopamine\nreceptors at the retinal or neural level (and perhaps\nincreased levels of dopamine in these areas), which may be\ncaused by hypomethylation.\nSuch observations provide theoretical and experimental\nsupport for the hypothesis in Stage 2 of the ND.As the exam-\nples above illustrate, individual variations in cortical struc-\nture and functioning give rise to atypical cognitions. By no\nmeans are these considered \"abnormal\"; rather, they arise\nfrom a complex mix of genetic, sensory, and cortical archi-\ntecture, and personal experiences that go into making each\nindividual experience unique. Similarly, PC ability may also\nbe one such atypical experience. Thus, we hypothesize that\ncortical hyper-associative mechanisms may permit the pro-\ncessing of information acquired from a synesthesia-like cou-\npling to an extended sensory variability through a currently\nunknown transducer, following which the implicitly acquired\ndata are further processed in the brain. Thus, there may be\nvariability at the point of sensory signal intake (for instance,\nneurotransmitters at the retinal level; Hypothesis 1.1) and\nstructural variability at the processing level (Hypothesis 2.1).\nAs Sagiv, Ilbeigi, and Ben-Tal (2011) have stated with refer-\nence to synesthesia,\nWe speculate that a broad spectrum of human experiences must\ninvolve some sort of synaesthesia-like cross activation. After all,\nnon-trivial mental function quite commonly requires the\nintegration of information across different domains of\nperception, cognition, and action. (p. 88)\ntions derive not only from sounds, touch, tastes, words, and\nso on, but also from more unexpected sources, such as the act\nof decision making, or very fine-grain motor movements, or\nnavigating social interactions, and so on.\"Sagiv et al. (2011)\nhave summarized the features of synesthesia: (a) It is present\nin 4% of the general population, (b) it is induced automati-\ncally, (c) there is permanence and regularity of synesthetic\nexperiences, (d) synesthetes take the experience for granted,\n(e) the experience shares much in common with ordinary\nperception, and (f) it may merely represent an augmentation\nof normal propensities for cross-modal interactions. Pointing\nto a genetic basis, Eagleman (2012) has found five families\nwith color-sequence synesthesia. Two of the best Star Gate\nremote viewers have twins with similar abilities, and, on a\npreliminary analysis, are synesthetes.\nIn summary of Stages 1 and 2, RC signals may be acquired\nby an individual with PC ability, due to psychophysical vari-\nability in signal transducer (Hypothesis 1.1); these signals\nare then processed in accordance with Stage 2. The cortical\nhyper-associative mechanism (Hypothesis 2.1) takes advan-\ntage of a possible increase in spectral range of EM and/or the\nperception of the RC signals that the brain can process.\nFurther support for the hypotheses put forth for Stages 1\nand 2 is found in experimental and applied research. Using\nneuroprostheses, Thomson, Carra, and Nicolelis (2013)\nreport a study with rats where they augmented the normal\nperceptual range to include the infrared EM spectrum, which\nis well outside the rat photoreceptors'spectral sensitivity. Via\nintracortical microstimulation, the rats were able to tran-\nscend the limitation of perceiving only those stimuli that can\nactivate their bodies' native sensory transducers. This lends\nexperimental support to the possibility of perceiving an\nextended EM spectrum as proposed by the MMPC. In addi-\ntion, sensory substitution devices (SSDs), which aim to com-\npensate for the loss of a sensory modality, typically vision,\nby converting information from the lost modality into stimuli\nin a remaining modality, lend support to the possibilities pro-\nposed in Stage 2. There is increasing speculation that SSD\nperception is an artificially induced synesthesia (for exam-\n(2010) points out, many forms of expertise depend on cross-\nmodal contingencies.\nStage 3: Cognition. Implicit learning is the normal means of\nacquiring information. It is characterized by two critical fea-\ntures: (a) It is an unconscious process, and (b) it yields\nabstract knowledge.As Lewicki, Hill, and Czyzewska (1992)\nstate, \" . . . the ability of the human cognitive system to non-\nconsciously acquire information is a general meta-theoretical\nassumption of almost all of contemporary cognitive psychol-\nogy.\" They further state that the \"final products of perception\n(i.e., subjectively encoded meanings of stimuli) is function-\nally independent from the information-processing algorithms\nand heuristics responsible for generating those subjective\nmeanings\" (pp. 796-797). The role of implicit learning in PC\nhas been well documented (e.g., Bierman, 2005; Carpenter,\nFollowing an extensive review of studies on PC and brain\nwaves, EEG and functional imaging correlates of PC and\npresentiment, and cerebral lateralization and PC, Williams\nand Roll (2008) concluded that there is considerable evi-\ndence that similar brain processes are used in PC as for nor-\nmal perception and behavior. Thus, in concurrence with\nBroughton (2006), we hypothesize that in Stage 3, cognition\noccurs in the same manner as for other sensory inputs.\nInfluence of emotions, memory, thinking, decision making,\nand so on occurs as it does for other non-PC activity for elic-\niting a PC response. Thus, we propose that in Stage 3, there\nis no distinguishing characteristic that differentiates the cog-\nnition of RC signals from that of normal sensory signals. RC\ninformation is acted on by the regular psychological pro-\ncesses and manifested through unconscious and conscious\nmeans such as feelings, dreams, language, art, decisions, and\nso on.\nAs stated in the introduction to this article, we strive to\nkeep what is known in physics, psychology, and neurosci-\nence as intact as possible. Therefore, it seems reasonable to\nassume that the processes involved in cognition of signals\nfrom normal sensory modalities will also be involved in the\ncognition part of RC signals. We have indicated in Stages 1\nand 2 of the ND of the model that high variability of senso-\nrial systems connected with a synesthesia-like coupling to\nother CNS structures may be the pathway of RC signals into\nthe CNS. Once there, the cognitive correlates of RC signals\nmay be indistinguishable from those of normal sensory sig-\nnals. This would suggest that it might not be possible to\nobserve CNS correlates to PC inputs simply because they\nwould be indistinguishable from other CNS correlates. This\nis particularly so because we are unable to determine what\nsignals to look for and unsure about when the RC signals\nwere received and processed by a transducer. For instance,\nthe percipient may have received them before being con-\nnected to the EEG gear or placed into an fMRI scanner, or, a\nday before or in the parking lot before entering the labora-\ntory, or perhaps the signals may have such a short duration\nthat they are missed by the hardware.\nFrom our current understanding, RC signals are generally\nnot robust and are difficult to detect. Moreover, they also\nappear to be statistically non-stationary; that is, statistical\nproperties vary with regard to when they are measured.\nWhere that apparent non-stationary aspect arises is unknown;\nhowever, there are only three possibilities--at the source, in\nthe transmission channel, or in the detection mechanism.\nTherefore, the cognition resulting from PC is unreliable.\nNormal psychological influences, such as memory forma-\ntion, emotional overlays, lack of attention or intention, ill\nhealth, effects of medications, and so on, will interfere with\nPC response formation as they do with other forms of cogni-\nTheorists such as Roll (1966) have proposed that PC\ninformation comprises the percipient's own future memory\ntraces and that the effect of the external (ESP) stimulus is to\nactivate memory traces rather than supplying new ideas or\nimages. Irwin (1979), in his information processing model,\nproposed that the PC-evoked memory information goes\nthrough several stages of unconscious or preconscious pro-\ncessing that will determine whether or not it emerges into\nconsciousness in much the same way that sensory informa-\ntion would be processed. However, various aspects of mem-\nory in relation to PC have been examined, but there were no\nsignificant relations between the two (Blackmore, 1980,\nAs PC is an unconscious process, we can assume that a\nPC-abled person is privy to a wider spectrum of information\nthat he incorporates in his daily life. Thus, in our view, mem-\nory may not play a role in the process of PC as outlined in the\nMMPC, but as a normal cognitive process that enhances or\ninhibits recall of perceptions. In this sense, memory is as\nimportant as it is for normal cognition and does not play an\ninstrumental role in the acquisition of RC signals. Thus,\nunlike Roll's analysis, the MMPC states that the most crucial\naspect in the PC process is the physics domain, and PC\ninvolves Stages 1 and 2 of the ND. The MMPC proposes that\nonce the information (PC stimulus--new information or\nimages) has been implicitly received, it is stored in the mem-\nory in the same way as is information to the other sensory\nsystems. It is retrieved when the need for it arises.\nFigure 5 illustrates factors such as attention, emotions,\nbeliefs, memory, creativity, uncontrolled random thoughts,\nintellectual decisions, linguistic influences, and so on (May\n& Trask, 1988) that may interfere with PC responses as they\ndo for the other senses. In the parlance of PC protocols, they\nare referred to as \"overlays.\" Thus, in a normal protocol in a\nPC session at our laboratory, a participant is asked to first\nnote down/illustrate the thoughts/images that are on the top\nof the participant's mind before the session begins. In this\nmanner, the cognitive overlays--the personal memories--\nare brought to the conscious level, and PC cognitions can be\nrecognized by the percipient as being distinct. In an experi-\nmental situation, an experienced PC-abled individual can\ndetermine information that is emerging from his own frame\nof reference as compared with that which is from newly\nacquired information.\nFamiliarity with certain varieties of objects is potentially\nproblematic. On one hand, it may make it easier for a partici-\npant to identify something for what it actually is; yet, on the\nother hand, such familiarity invokes responses that arise\nfrom that familiarity and not from PC information (i.e., fill-\ning in cognitive blanks) from previous experience and not\nfrom data. Experienced participants utilize normal meta-cog-\nnitive processes to provide further details about the target\nstimulus. Thus, they may respond with two categories of data\nfrom a distant spacetime event: (a) technical details derived\nfrom PC and (b) information arising from technical knowl-\nedge from the participant's own database of information.\nHowever, a participant who is not familiar with a submarine,\nfor example, and its relevance for the task at hand, may not\npay attention to the information that is being received and\nthus bypass it, much like inattentional blindness. It is also\ntrue that participants will describe an unfamiliar scene by\nreferring to similar situations of which they are familiar. For\ninstance, in the examples given in Figures 2 to 4, the partici-\npant described a \"rain-making machine.\" This person had no\nexperience with a rocket motor test or its associated equip-\nment, so she described the site in terms that were familiar to\nher. These included a rain-making machine, a locomotive,\nand tracks. What the participant labeled a \"rain-making\"\nmachine is something that is common on such rocket motor\ntests. Water is sprayed on the motor during the test to keep it\nfrom overheating (see Figure 4).\nMMPC and Other Psi Models\nDevelopments in recent years point to continued effort on the\npart of theorists and experimenters to understand the com-\nplex problem of psi. These data have given rise to competing\nand complementary models such as observational theory\n(Shoup, 2006) based in quantum mechanics, the model of\npragmatic information (von Lucadou, 1995) based on a\nquantum metaphor, consciousness-induced restoration of\ntime symmetry (Bierman, 2010), psychological models such\nas the activational model of psi (Vassy, 2007), and the first-\nsight model (Carpenter, 2012). Although a detailed discus-\nsion of these models in relation to the MMPC is beyond the\nlimited space for this article, a succinct explanation is illus-\ntrated in Table 2 wherein various models are placed in the\nappropriate domains of the MMPC. This brief illustration\nindicates that different models address specific problems in\ndifferent domains and stages of the total PC event.\nChallenges Posed by the MMPC\nThe merit of this model rests in viewing the seemingly uni-\nfied process of PC into the two distinct domains of physics\nand neuroscience. We can identify some challenges that each\ndomain poses.\nThe primary challenges are seen in the PD. Physicists are\nconsidering the possibility that the thermodynamic-derived\nsingle direction of time's arrow might be reversed on local or\nglobal scales (Sheehan, 2006). Various hypotheses, such as\nthe entropy model and quantum RC, are being investigated\nhowever, is determining the nature of an RCsignal carrier\nthat propagates backward in time.\nIntrinsically dependent on the carrier is the nature of\nRCsignal transducer that can convert the energy from the\ncarrier into a form that can be processed by the CNS. The\nnature of the transducer can provide clues to its location, just\nas the auditory receptors serve as a signal transducer for\naudio signals that can be subsequently processed by the cen-\ntral auditory system. Identifying the transducer in PC ability\nmay aid in exploring the physics domain for appropriate car-\nriers and vice versa. Recent research has further identified\nthe integration of touch and sound signals at the secondary\nKayser, Petkov, Augath, & Logothetis, 2005; Macaluso,\n2006). This opens the door for considering a variety of pos-\nsible signals that can be processed and perceived by the\nhuman brain. Experimental evidence for EM or acoustic sig-\nnals as possible carriers for PC has been ruled out (Puthoff,\nMMPC allows us to consider these channels with regard to\ntheir sensory CNS structures that may be optimized for\nRCsignal detection.\nThe challenges in the ND are, comparatively, not as oner-\nous as in the PD. Having bifurcated the problem space, ND\nexperimenters need not concern themselves with the chal-\nlenges posed in the PD. As outlined, the primary problem for\nthe ND is determining the nature of an RCsignal transducer\nand its cortical connectivity. This, in itself, will lead to a\nbreakthrough in our understanding of the PD as well as the\nThe basic process outlined in the MMPC opens the door\nfor exploratory research, particularly for Stages 1 and 2 of\nthe ND, which require expertise from a host of specialties. It\nis our sincere hope that experts from relevant disciplines\ntake up the challenges posed, and take PC research forward.\nWe strongly believe that there is no need for any further\nevidential studies for PC--a task that has been fulfilled\namply and successfully by ESP researchers over more than\nPredictions Based on the MMPC\nThe task for the next phase in PC research is well laid out in\nthe structure of the MMPC. The two domains and three\nstages provide guidelines for further research.\nAn experiment is currently underway to test the entropy\nhypothesis put forth in the PD. Because of the supremacy of\nentropy, the MMPC predicts that this experiment will show\nbetter PC when target stimuli are demarked with higher\nentropic gradients than those that do not (May et al., in prep-\naration). The PD section of the MMPC would predict a suc-\ncessful outcome of this experiment; namely, that a burst of\nthermodynamic entropy at a future remote site acts like a\nflashlight in a dark room allowing the participant to have a\nbetter understanding of what is at the target stimulus.\nIn our view, the stages outlined in the ND are stable com-\nponents of the model. Although we have proposed hypothe-\nses for each stage, there is substantial room for introducing\nnew and fine-tuned hypotheses within each stage.\nTable 2.

MMPC = Multiphasic Model of Precognition; CIRTS = consciousness-induced restoration of time symmetry.\nStage 1: Hypothesis of psychophysical variability in a sig-\nnal transducer. This stage is primarily an exploratory one.\nThe crucial test for this hypothesis is that individuals with\nknown and tested PC ability should be examined for possible\nvariations in structure and range in existing sensory trans-\nducers. We predict that (1) these individuals will have struc-\ntural variations in a sensory transducer, for example, as seen\nin tetra- and pentachromats, and (2) they will be the outliers\nin the range of sensory input processed. In essence, the focus\nis on individual data and not on averaged normative data.\nDetermining the variations observed in PC-abled individ-\nuals permits the screening of the general population for simi-\nlar variations and testing them to see the degree to which\nthey possess PC ability.\nStage 2: Hypothesis of cortical hyper-associative mecha-\nnism. Although this stage too is an exploratory one, it has\nscope for greater predictability. The key issue for this stage,\nas in the previous one, is mapping the cortical structure of\nindividuals with known PC ability--a relatively straightfor-\nward task. Furthermore, we have hypothesized that the\nnature of the RC signal and Stage-1 considerations may\nrequire cross-modal connectivity to process the signal. For\nthis, we have proposed a hyper-associative mechanism as\nseen in synesthetes. This gives rise to two predictions: (a)\nPC-abled persons will have some form of synesthesia--the\nnature and type being a secondary line of investigation--as\nobserved in appropriate diagnostic technologies, and as\ndetermined by standard synesthesia inventories, and (b)\nknown synesthetes will have PC ability as measured by stan-\ndard precognition tests (seeMay, Marwaha, & Chaganti,\nAs stated, Stage 3, cognition, is not instrumental to the\nprocess of acquiring RC information, although it does influ-\nence when, how, and in what form the information is mani-\nfested. As this stage is amenable to a wide variety of\nconsiderations--from neuropsychological to personality--\nwe discuss just a few predictions:\n1. The MMPC predicts that distinct CNS correlates in\nfunctional technologies such as EEGs and fMRIs will\nnot be observed during the process of PC tasking\nbecause (a) currently, we do not know what kind of\nsignal to look for, and hence what the concomitant\nEEG would look like. (b) Due to the very nature of\nPC, in principle, we cannot determine when/where\nthe RC signal was acquired. For example, as men-\ntioned, the RC signal might be acquired by the par-\nticipant before he arrives at the laboratory. (c) Once\nthe signal has been acquired, it may be processed in\nthe same way as normal cognitions, thus making it\ndifficult to determine whether a visual image is aris-\ning out of an RC signal, or it is information acquired\nthrough other sensory channels, or stored RC infor-\nmation that is being expressed in a visual or verbal\nform.\n2. Although the literature indicates that extraversion cor-\nrelates with PC ability, the MMPC predicts that there\nmay be no fundamental personality correlates for PC\nability. Fundamentally, the existence of the hypothe-\nsized PC transducers and the synesthetic ability and\npossible multisensorial processing are independent of\npersonality type. However, the possibility of a similar\nbiology may contribute to a similar psychology; how-\never, considering personality is also shaped by experi-\nence, there may be too many confounding factors to\npermit a \"precognitive-personality type.\"\n3. This model predicts that training for acquiring a PC\nability would be ineffective, although training to use\nthe ability effectively, as in response style, identify-\ning and ignoring cognitive overlays, and so on may\nbe possible; this is similar to learning how to use an\ninstrument when one has the inherent musical ability.\nThe MMPC model considers the internal processes\nmore analogous to acuity in the visual system; that is,\ncertain aspects of visual perception can be trained,\nbut acuity cannot be improved by training.\n4. The MMPC predicts that individuals with PC ability\nmay exhibit a high score on vividness of visual imag-\nery (Marks, 1973), reflecting their ability to translate\na pure RC signal into comprehensible cognitive con-\ntent. However, this may not be instrumental for the\nprocess of PC, as much as a consequence of the\nunderlying structures.\n5. Finally, because there is an obvious variation among\nindividuals in converting implicit information into\ncognitive awareness, the MMPC would predict that\nindividuals who are inherently better at the process\nwould also be better at PC. Because there are inde-\npendent measures of implicit learning, it renders this\nas a testable element of an aspect of the MMPC\nmodel.\nThe ND premise opens the door for genetic evaluation of\nthe PC-abled persons. The search is for the genetic basis of\nthe underlying variations, rather than a gene for PC per se.\nIn conclusion, according to the MMPC, PC is an atypical\nperceptual ability that allows the acquisition of non-inferen-\ntial information arising from a future point in spacetime.\nThe person-centric experience of PC is a manifestation\nof the fundamental problem of information-centric RC\nsignals.\nExamining the ND may yield information on the probable\nbandwidth on which RC signals may be carried and the sen-\nsory modalities that are involved. This may provide data for\nthe PD to explore to determine the nature of a possible RC\nsignal carrier. This opens the door to understanding the fun-\ndamental questions that the experience of PC has raised--the\nnature of time, causality, and information. Indeed, this is an\nenormous task, for which the MMPC provides the frame-\nwork for a research program.\n"
