Diversity among the older adult population is\nexpected to increase significantly; however, there is little\nknowledge about minorities' interests and expectations for\nretirement--especially among Hispanic, African Caribbean,\nand immigrant populations. Such knowledge is important,\ngiven that minorities have historically had different labor\nmarket experiences, family patterns, living arrangements\n(Lee, 2009), and health disparities (Hayward, Miles,\nCrimmins, & Yang, 2000), compared with non-Hispanic\nWhites. To increase our understandings of expectations and\nplans for retirement among adults reaching retirement age,\nthis community-based participatory study involved focus\ngroups with a diverse sample of adults living in Miami-Dade\nCounty, Florida.\nSocial and Economic Trends\nSurrounding Retirement\nMuch of the current interest in retirement trends has sur-\nrounded the experiences of Baby Boomers, a large cohort of\nsince January 1, 2011 (Robison, Shugrue, Fortinsky, &\nGruman, 2013). In addition to this cohort's size, there are a\nnumber of social characteristics among Baby Boomers that\ndiffer from previous cohorts of retiring adults: They are more\ndiverse, racially and ethnically (Colby & Ortman, 2014);\nthey also tend to be wealthier, are less likely to be married,\nhave fewer children (Robison et al., 2013); and they experi-\nence better physical health and have greater life expectancies\nCompared with prior cohorts, the Baby Boomer generation\nhas a higher percentage of minorities (Colby & Ortman, 2014)\nand many are also foreign-born (Gassoumis, Wilber, Baker, &\nTorres-Gil, 2009; Villa, Wallace, Bagdasaryan, & Aranda,\n2012). However, it is important to note that foreign-born adults\n1University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, USA\n2Florida International University, Miami, USA\n3United Way of Miami-Dade, FL, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nNicole Ruggiano, Associate Professor, School of Social Work, University\nEmail: nruggiano@ua.edu\n\"Work Is Like a Therapy That Prevents\nAging\": Perceptions of Retirement,\nProductivity, and Health Among\nMinorities and Immigrants\nNicole Ruggiano1, Janice O'Driscoll2, Andreja Lukic2,\nand Linda Schotthoefer3\n Keywords\nproductive aging, minorities, immigrants, retirement\n2 SAGE Open\nthe same experiences that make the American-born Baby\nBoomers socially distinctive from other generations, such as\nthe Civil Rights Movement, Vietnam War, and historical dis-\ntrust of their parents' generation (Pruchno, 2012). Economic,\nsocial, and health differences across various racial and ethnic\ngroups may also translate to special needs for certain subpopu-\nlations of Baby Boomers as they transition to and live indepen-\ndently during their retirement years. For instance, Gassoumis\nand colleagues (2009) reported that more than a third (37%) of\nLatino Baby Boomers living within the United States are non-\ncitizens, and Latino Baby Boomers are less likely than their\nnon-Latino counterparts to be English-proficient or to have\nattended college and are more likely to experience a disability\nor poverty. Lee (2009) reported that older minority women are\nless likely to have financial security than non-Hispanic White\nwomen during their retirement years. Helman, Greenwald,\nVanDerhei, and Copeland (2007) reported that even though\nAfricanAmerican and Hispanic workers are less likely than the\nAmerican workforce overall to be financially prepared for\nretirement, they are just as likely to feel confident that they will\nlive comfortably during their retirement years.\nEconomic Trends Surrounding\nRetirement\nIn addition to sociodemographic trends, recent economic\ntrends in the United States have had an impact on retirement\ncant impact on adults who were nearing retirement. During\nthis time, the collapse in the housing and stock markets\ndestroyed a significant amount of household wealth (Rosnick\n& Baker, 2009). As a result, the percentage of households \"at\nrisk\" for having inadequate retirement income by age 65,\nand many Americans reported being unable to retire at the tra-\ntime period demonstrated that many adults nearing retirement\nreported concern about not having enough savings (Maples &\nAbney, 2006). In addition, a large majority reported a lack of\nconfidence that they will have enough money to live comfort-\nably throughout their retirement years and expected to rely on\npostretirement employment to supplement their retirement\nincome (Duska, 2013). Despite the challenges posed by the\nrecession, Helman, Greenwald, Copeland, and VanDerhei\n(2015) reported that confidence among American workers\nabout their financial security for retirement has started to\nbounce back following the recession.\nExpectations and Plans Surrounding\nRetirement\nRecent studies on retirement have primarily involved statisti-\ncal analyses of large data sets (e.g., U.S. Census data, Health\nand Retirement Study data) to study actual economic and\nsocial behaviors and characteristics of those who are nearing\nor have entered retirement (Gassoumis et al., 2009; Lee,\nconducted to understand the attitudes, expectations, and/or\nconcerns toward aging and retirement. The Metlife Mature\nMarket Institute (2012) reported that the three largest con-\ncerns about transitioning into retirement are financial security\n(18%), ability to stay productive (16%), and ability to provide\nfor their long-term care needs or the needs of their spouse\n(13%). However, these studies did not highlight the specific\nconcerns and expectations among minority populations.\nOutside of economic reasons, there has also been an\nincreased interest in remaining productive during retirement\nyears. For instance, those approaching retirement often con-\nsider the role that volunteering may play in their life after\nleaving their full-time employment (Seaman, 2012). Also,\nmaintaining paid employment in later life has become more\ncommon and it has been established that an increasing num-\nber of older African Americans and Hispanics will be in the\nrelatively newer concept and refers to the contributions that\nolder adults can and do make to the larger society through\nactivities that may include volunteerism, paid labor, or other\nunpaid activities including civic engagement (Achenbaum,\n2009). However, there is currently a dearth of knowledge\nabout minorities' perceptions of productive aging. In their\nstudy on older Latinos, Hilton, Gonzalez, Saleh, Maitoza,\nand Anngela-Cole (2012) reported that financial well-being\nin later life and having security through employment, such as\nincome and health benefits, were part of participants'descrip-\ntions of \"successful aging,\" though \"successful aging\" and\n\"productive aging\" are typically considered to be different\nProductivity and Successful Aging:\nTheoretical Framework\nis influenced by three components: low risk of disease and\ndisability, high cognitive and physical functioning, and being\nactively engaged with life. The last of these components\nrelates very closely with retirement activities, because it\nincludes productive activities. Rowe and Kahn (1997) recog-\nnized that such productive activities can involve a myriad of\nthings that create value to the larger society and can be reim-\nbursed (paid) or nonreimbursed (voluntary, unpaid).\nProductive activities can also involve formal activities, such\nas maintaining paid employment in the labor force or volun-\nteering at a hospital, or informal activities, such as providing\nemotional or direct support to someone in the community\nwho is ill. Drawing upon prior study findings, they also iden-\ntified three predictors of productive aging: functional capac-\nity, where adults with high cognitive and physical capacity\nRuggiano et al. 3\nare more likely to be productive in later life; educational\nlevel, where those with higher levels of education demon-\nstrate more sustained productive activities; and self-efficacy,\nwhere those who are more confident in their abilities in later\nlife engage in more productive activities.\nContext of Current Study and Aims\nThis study took place in Miami-Dade County, Florida, where\nabout a half-million Baby Boomers reside (U.S. Census\nBureau, 2015). This was a community-based participatory\nresearch (CBPR) study, where \"community-based organiza-\ntions play a direct role in the design and conduct of the\nresearch study\" (Agency for Healthcare Research and\nQuality, 2003, para. 3). The study was initiated by the United\nWay of Miami-Dade County (herein after referred to as\nUnited Way), which established an Older Adults Initiative\nSteering Committee, comprised of academics, professionals,\nand community members. The purpose of the Steering\nCommittee was to help develop a policy and service agenda\nfor older adults in Miami-Dade County. The United Way was\nspecifically interested in addressing the future needs of older\nresidents, and therefore decided to focus their attention on\nthe needs and concerns of local adults who were approaching\nand/or transitioning into retirement age.\nThe Steering Committee became concerned about the\nextent to which existing research could be used to adequately\nengage in policy and service planning, given that Hispanics,\nAfrican Caribbeans, and immigrants were underrepresented\nor excluded in retirement research. Miami-Dade County is\ncomprised of almost 2.7 million people, where 15.1% of the\npopulation is 65 years old and older, 18.9% of residents iden-\ntify as Black orAfricanAmerican, 66.2% identify as Hispanic\nor Latino, and more than half are foreign-born (U.S. Census\nBureau, 2015). The local older adult population reflects this\ndiversity. According to the Florida Department of Elder\nAffairs (DOEA; 2015), more than one in five residents of\nMiami-Dade County is age 60 or older, with 18.1% of adults\nin this age group identifying as Black or African American\nand 67.5% identifying as Hispanic. The DOEA further\nreports that more than 40% of older adults have limited\nEnglish proficiency, almost 30% are medically underserved,\nand more than a third are Medicaid eligible.\nGiven the lack of representation of local populations in\nretirement research, the Steering Committee ultimately\ndecided to partner with local researchers to conduct a study\non local adults who are transitioning into retirement. The\nstudy examined the attitudes, expectations, and concerns\ntoward retirement among local adults between the ages of\n\"older\" Baby Boomers) and set out to address the following\nresearch questions.\nResearch Question 1 (RQ1): What are the experiences\nof adults in Miami-Dade County (including those who are\nHispanic, Haitian, and foreign-born) as they transition\ninto retirement?\nResearch Question 2 (RQ2): What are the concerns of\nthis population as they make this transition?\nStudy Method\nAs a CBPR study, the United Way played a significant role in\nthe design and implementation of the research. First, United\nWay partners drafted research questions that the lead\nresearcher and author helped revise. Then, they expressed\nthat they wanted to explore the research questions through\nfocus groups, so they regularly met with the researcher to\ncollectively plan the sample, and focus group guide and\nplans for implementation of these focus groups until a\nresearch design strategy was agreed upon. After the\nresearcher obtained an institutional review board approval\nfrom Florida International University, the members of the\nUnited Way obtained certificates in training for research with\nhuman subjects as well as training from the researcher on\ndata collection, and the community partners began recruiting\nparticipants with the support of their partnering agencies. All\nEnglish and Spanish-language data were collected, trans-\nlated (for Spanish), and analyzed by the researcher and/or\nUnited Way partners. The United Way decided to contract\nwith a consulting firm for Kreyol-language focus group data.\nThe CBPR design of the study made it possible to explore the\ntopic of retirement among populations who are difficult to\nengage in research, including Spanish-speaking Hispanics,\nKreyol-speaking Haitians, and immigrants.\nRecruiting Focus Group Participants\nParticipants were eligible for the study if they were born\nSpanish, or Kreyol; and were living in Miami-Dade at the\ntime of the study. To reflect the diversity of the region,\nemphasis was placed on recruiting participants who were of\nHispanic and Haitian ethnicities and focus groups were con-\nducted in English, Spanish, or Haitian Kreyol. All recruit-\nment, informed consent, and research materials were\ntranslated into Spanish and Kreyol languages. To assure\nquality in the translations, all Spanish-language materials\nunderwent initial translation (English to Spanish) followed\nby translation back to English by a second translator, and\nKreyol translations were conducted by a local professional\nconsulting firm with expertise with Miami-Dade's Haitian\npopulation.\nTo recruit focus group participants, local community agen-\ncies distributed informational flyers about the study to their\nclients. In addition, the project ran English, Spanish, and\nKreyol-language radio and newspaper advertisements in media\noutlets that target local residents who speak the respective lan-\nguage. Participants self-selected for the study by calling the\nphone number provided by the flyer and/or advertisement.\n4 SAGE Open\nUpon calling, a project team member who speaks the language\nof the potential participant explained the goals and methods of\nthe study, determined their eligibility for the study through a\nseries of screening questions, and scheduled the participant in a\nfocus group according to their interest and eligibility to\nparticipate.\nData collection involved nine focus groups, which took\nplace at Partnering Community Organizations between\nthere were five groups conducted in English (two with higher\nincome earners, one with moderate-income earners, one with\nmoderate- and low-income earners, and one with low-income\nearners); two groups conducted in Spanish (both with mod-\nerate- and low-income earners); and two groups conducted in\nKreyol (one with low- and moderate-income earners and one\nwith high-income earners).1 It is important to note that many\nof the participants were bilingual and selected a group based\non the language in which they felt most comfortable partici-\npating. Based on the community-partners'recommendations,\ngroups were also separated based on income level so that\nhigher income earners and low-income participants were in\nseparate groups. They indicated that this may increase the\ncomfort level among participants in sharing their experi-\nences with financial planning, retirement opportunities, and\nother lifestyle decisions that may be affected by income.\nData Collection\nAfter reading and signing a consent form to participate in the\nstudy, participants were asked to complete a demographic\nform, which was used to assess the overall characteristics of\nthe study sample. When all participants completed the con-\nsenting process and demographic forms, they participated in\na focus group that was facilitated by a member of the project\nwho was fluent in the preferred language of the participants\n(English, Spanish, or Kreyol). The focus group sessions\nlasted between 60 and 75 min and were guided by a focus\ngroup protocol. At the end of each focus group, the partici-\npants were each offered a US$20 supermarket gift card as an\nhonorarium.\nParticipants' experiences and expectations for retirement\nwere explored through more general questions and prompts,\nincluding \"Looking ahead 5 to 10 years from now, what do\nyou hope to be doing with your life?\" and \"Tell me about\nwhat you are currently doing or what you will be doing to\nprepare for the next 5 to 10 years.\"\nAnalyzing the Focus Group Data\nThe audiotapes were transcribed, translated to English, and\nchecked for accuracy. The project team entered the demo-\ngraphic information about participants in an SPSS file to\ngenerate frequencies for demographic characteristics. Using\nan interpretivist approach informed by grounded theory\nmethods, the focus group data underwent a systematic\nprocess of coding and theme development (Corbin & Strauss,\nsis software. First, two researchers (NR and JO) engaged in\nopen coding of the transcripts by independently reviewing\ncopies of the transcripts and unrestrictedly assigning words\nand phrases to segments of text that represented particular\nconcepts. Using constant comparison, they engaged in an\nongoing process of comparing codes with previous data to\nidentify concepts that were similar and different across the\ntranscripts. These activities resulted in a list of codes that\nchanged during analysis as codes were added, altered, and\ndeleted as needed. Then, the researchers engaged in axial\ncoding, where codes were reviewed to determine their accu-\nracy and creating larger, thematic categories from similar\nand related codes. Later in the analysis, these categories were\nused to create broader, thematic statements related to retire-\nment. To increase the trustworthiness of the findings, the\nresearchers assessed the data independently and held regular\nmeetings where they identified minor discrepancies in their\nanalyses. These discrepancies were resolved by discussing\nthe codes, categories, and themes until an agreement was\nreached. Finally, the researchers presented the final catego-\nries and themes to the community partners, where minor dis-\ncrepancies were resolved through discussion.\nStudy Findings\nOverall, the study included 50 participants,2 with the overall\nsample reflecting the racial and ethnic diversity of Miami-Dade\nCounty. Two larger themes with corresponding subthemes\nemerged from the data. The first theme related to Redefining\nRetirement, where many participants reported that retirement is\ndifferent for their generation than their parents' generation\nbecause they are \"different from their parents\" both socially\nand economically. They also expressed that they are redefining\nretirement by expecting to work in the paid labor force after the\ntraditional retirement ages of 62 and 65. The second larger\ntheme related to their Expectations and Experiences for\nTransitioning Into Retirement, which involved discussions of\ncontinuing with planned work activities for higher income par-\nticipants and unexpected and often unsatisfying employment\nstatuses for lower income participants. Participants across\nfocus groups reported an interest in volunteering. More detail\non the sample and these thematic findings are described below.\nStudy Sample Characteristics\nAs indicated in Table 1, the focus group participants varied in\nrace, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Out of the 50 par-\nticipants, 80% were women and the majority identified as\nbeing Hispanic (40%) and/or Black/African American (44%).\nForty-four percent indicated that they were born outside of\nthe United States. The most common (44%) level of educa-\ntion completed by participants was a 4-year college degree.\nOne in four had less than a high school education. At the time\nRuggiano et al. 5\nof their focus group, almost two thirds (64%) of respondents\nindicated that they were working in paid labor activities, six\n(12%) indicated that they were retired, and another six (12%)\nindicated that disability left them unable to work.\nRedefining Retirement\nWe are different from our parents. The term retirement was\nnot defined for participants by members of the research team.\nAlthough focus group participants did not inherently provide\ndefinitions for \"retirement,\" they acknowledged that their\nexperiences and expectations for retirement were different\nthan that of their parents' generation. Specifically, many\nreported that they perceived their parents as being \"older\" at\nretirement compared with the way Baby Boomers view\nthemselves today. For instance, Valerie, a higher income,\nnon-Hispanic White woman stated,\nIn my parents' generation, a 60-year old grandmother was\nsomeone who wore a housedress and an apron, gray hair was\npulled back in a bun and she's been a homemaker her whole life\nand her job was to make cookies for the grandchildren. We are\nnot that and we will never be that.\nAs a result, participants viewed themselves as having\nmore energy and ambition than their parents did when they\nretired. They identified exiting the paid labor force as being\nmore appropriate for someone much older than themselves\nand their vision of retirement involved the opportunity and\ninterest in engaging in an active lifestyle during later life. For\nexample, Elizabeth, a moderate-income, non-Hispanic White\nwoman explained,\nI do think that at our age we're not so old, as maybe our parents\nwere much older at our age. I think we're more active, we do\nTable 1.

(continued)\n6 SAGE Open\nmore things, and we're interested in more diverse things. But if\nI saw something interesting I might say \"Gee, I'd like to try\nthat.\"\nParticipants also indicated that it was \"easier\" for their par-\nents' generation to retire, which is why more of their parents'\nexited the paid workforce at traditional retirement ages than\nthose from their own generation. One reason provided for this\nis that the recent recession made it more difficult for those who\nare currently ready to retire. They also believed that there were\nmore policies, programs, and education available to their par-\nents' generation that helped them transition into retirement,\nwhich is unlike their experience today. One example of this\ncame from Daniel, a low/moderate-income Haitian man:\nI see that [retirement] was easier for [our parents] in the sense\nthat the economy wasn't as bad. It was easier for them to save.\nWhen retiring, a lot of them had already finished paying their\nmortgages. They built houses in Haiti. They have a pied-a-terre.\nWork as long as you can. Although participants felt that it was\neasier for their parents' generation to retire than their own,\nmost reported that they welcomed the opportunity to con-\ntinue working during later life for as long as they were physi-\ncally and mentally healthy enough to engage in productive\nactivities. There was a general sentiment across focus groups\nthat spending retirement years engaged in mostly leisurely\nactivities would be unsatisfying. For some, this meant pro-\nlonging retirement or not retiring at all; many participants\nadvised that their peers and future generations should con-\ntinue working in paid employment as long as it was possible.\nFor instance, Beatrice, a low/moderate-income Haitian\nwoman stated, \"As long as I'm healthy, I would like to work\nas long/late as I can.\" Similarly, Louise, a low-income Afri-\ncan American woman explained, \"That's why I would tell\nanybody that's working, young, older people, work long as\nyou can.\" It is important to note that in response to Louise's\nstatement, all the other focus group participants nodded and\nverbally reported their agreement.\nWithin the two Haitian focus groups, there was specific\ndiscussion regarding how working later in life is very impor-\ntant for maintaining good mental health as people age. One\nexample of this can be seen through Gregory, a low/moder-\nate-income Haitian man:\nI don't see myself retiring anytime soon. For me, work is like a\ntherapy that prevents aging. For example, some people start\ntheir retirement, they got depressed and they fall on, they let go.\nHowever, a few examples in my environment that some people\nthat are 75 years old and they continue working as head of their\norganizations. They functioned like they were in their 50s. The\nstress is less on them because they are working.\nThis focus on mental health was not discussed in other focus\ngroups, where the discussion on declining health focused\nmainly on physical health.\nAlthough working later in life is what most participants\nthought would be satisfying, there was an "
