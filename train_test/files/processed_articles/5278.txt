OPG acts as a decoy receptor for the\nreceptor activator of nuclear factor-b ligand (RANKL)\nand tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-induc-\ning ligand (TRAIL), regulates bone remodeling and\napplies antiapoptotic effects on endothelial cells, protect-\ning them against TRAIL-induced cell death.1\u00ad3 OPG, one\nof the major players in the balance between bone forma-\ntion and bone resorption, exerts osteoprotective effects by\ninhibiting osteoclast differentiation and activation and pro-\nmoting osteoclast apoptosis. However, in the clinical set-\nting, the association between OPG and bone mineral\ndensity (BMD) as well as fragility fractures remains con-\ntroversial. Increased OPG levels have been associated with\nhigher BMD of the lumbar spine in men and total body\nBMD in women,4,5 whereas in other studies a negative cor-\nrelation or no correlation was found.6,7 Recently, OPG has\nappeared to represent the molecular link between bone\nresorption and vascular calcification. Elevated serum OPG\nlevels have been reported in patients with coronary artery\ndisease and carotid atherosclerosis; further, increased OPG\nlevels were positively associated with severity of vascular\nEffect of angiotensin II receptor blockers,\ncandesartan, on osteoprotegerin level in\nhypertensive patients: Link between\nbone and RAAS\n Keywords\nAngiotensin II receptor blocker, osteoprotegerin, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\nDepartment of Arthroscopy and Sport Medicine, Wolfson Medical\nCenter, Israel\n2Department of Medicine, Wolfson Medical Center, Israel\n3Department of Endocrinology, Wolfson Medical Center, Israel\n4Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel\nCorresponding author:\nM Shargorodsky, Department of Endocrinology, Wolfson Medical\nEmail: marinas@wolfson.health.gov.il\nOriginal Article\n548 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(3)\ndamage, atherosclerosis progression as well as with inci-\ndent cardiovascular disease and mortality.8\u00ad10\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS),\nplaying an integral role in cardiovascular homeostasis, has\nrecently been considered as a possible link between bone\nand vascular disease. One of the final mediators of the\nRAAS cascade, angiotensin II (Ang II), indirectly pro-\nmotes the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts\nthrough the upregulation of the activator RANKL in osteo-\nblasts as well as stimulation of RANKL expression in\nosteoblasts and thereby osteoclastogenesis.11,12 Ang II may\nalso influence calcium metabolism by decreasing ionized\ncalcium and increasing the parathyroid hormone level.13\nAlthough previous studies have shown that interruption of\nthe RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors\n(ACEIs) is effective in increasing BMD and reduces the\nrisk of fractures,14,15 the results of trials evaluating effect\nof Ang II antagonist on bone metabolism are limited and\nequivocal. It has been shown that administration of an Ang\nII antagonist, losartan, had no effect on bone metabolism\nin normal rats,16 whereas another Ang II type 1 receptor\nblocker, olmesartan, ameliorates osteoclastogenesis\nthrough down-regulation of RANKL expression and\nimproves bone density in ovariectomized spontaneously\nhypertensive rats.17 Differences in the affinity to the Ang II\nreceptor as well as different immune and inflammatory\neffect may explain this variability.\nThe present study was designed to determine the effect\nof the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan\non circulating OPG levels in hypertensive patients with\nmultiple cardiovascular risk factors.\nMaterials and methods\nParticipants\nIn the present study, 69 hypertensive patients were\nrecruited from the outpatient clinic and evaluated for the\nstudy. Patients included in the study were stabilized on\ntheir previous medical treatment in the outpatient clinic\nfor up to three months before entrance to the study, with\nan effort to minimize treatment change during the study.\nTo optimize control of hypertension, individual medical\nadvice was given to every patient at the beginning and\noffered throughout the duration of the study. Oral antihy-\npertensive therapy, other than ARBs or ACEIs, was per-\nmitted in both groups. Following a three-month\nstabilization period, which included a washout period,\nall patients were consecutively randomized to two\ngroups: Group 1 included patients treated with oral can-\ndesartan in doses of 16\u00ad32 mg per day in addition to\nroutine standard of care (routine care + ARB), and Group\n2 included patients receiving routine standard of care\nother than ARBs or ACEIs, with no change to their treat-\nment (routine care).\nOf the 69 patients recruited to the study, 67 completed\nthe six-month treatment period (45 patients from Group 1\nPatients suspected of secondary hypertension, with\nhistory of major disease or surgery within the six months\npreceding entrance to the study, were excluded. Patients\nwith hemodynamic instability, unbalanced endocrine\ndisease, and any disease that might affect absorption of\nmedications were excluded, as were patients with plasma\ncreatinine > 2 mg/dl, elevation of liver enzymes to more\nthan twice the upper normal limit and electrolyte\nabnormalities.\nBiochemical parameters\nBlood sampling for full chemistry and metabolic parame-\nters, including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein\n(HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, tri-\nglycerides, fasting glucose, HbA1C, c-peptide, insulin,\nand C-reactive protein (CRP), aldosterone and plasma\nrenin activity were performed at baseline and at the end of\nthe study. Samples for serum aldosterone and plasma renin\nactivity were collected in a sitting position and measured\nusing commercially available radioimmunoassay\n(DiaSorin, Italy, catalog number REF CA1533). The lower\nlimits of the serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity\nwere 0.6 ng/dl and 0.1 ng/ml/h, respectively. The samples\nwere measured in duplicate.\nSerum OPG levels were determined by enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (BioVendor). The intra- and interas-\nsay coefficients of variation for OPG were 2.4%\u00ad7.0 %\nHomeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance\n(HOMA-IR) was calculated by the following formula:\nfasting plasma insulin (mU/ml) \u00d7 fasting plasma glucose\nStatistical analysis\nAnalysis of data was carried out using SPSS 9.0 statisti-\ncal analysis software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA,\n1999). For continuous variables, such as hemodynamic,\nbiochemistry and arterial elasticity parameters, descrip-\ntive statistics were calculated and reported as mean \u00b1\nstandard deviation. Normalcy of distribution of continu-\nous variables was assessed using the Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov test (cutoff at p = 0.01). Categorical variables\nsuch as sex and comorbidities were described using fre-\nquency distributions and are presented as frequency (%).\nContinuous variables were simultaneously across visits\nby group using GLM repeated-measures analysis.\nSignificant differences were compared using the t-test\nfor independent samples. Within a given treatment\ngroup, the Friedman test or GLM repeated-measures\nanalysis was used to compare differences across visits,\nfollowed post hoc by the t-test for paired samples of the\nWilcoxon signed ranks test as appropriate. Categorical\nvariables were compared between groups using the chi-\nsquare test.

As can be seen the two groups were similar with\nrespect to age, gender distribution, presence of cardiovas-\ncular risk factors, concomitant medications, baseline blood\npressure level and baseline OPG levels.\nBetween-group comparisons\nTable 1 shows that both groups of patients were similar at\nbaseline in terms of hemodynamic, metabolic and inflam-\nmatory parameters. There were no significant differences\nbetween the two groups in terms of systolic (SBP) as well\nas diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at baseline and after six\nmonths of treatment. Baseline OPG levels did not differ\nsignificantly by treatment group. However, post-treatment\nserum OPG levels were marginally lower in patients\ntreated with candesartan compared with the routine care\n(Figure 1).\nBaseline metabolic and inflammatory parameters\nincluding lipids, fasting insulin, C-peptide, and CRP did\nnot differ significantly between the groups. After the six-\nmonth treatment period, no significant difference in these\nparameters was detected by group. Serum creatinine and\nelectrolytes levels did not differ significantly between the\ngroups at baseline and at the end of the study.\nChanges in hemodynamic and\nmetabolic parameters in hypertensive\npatients treated with candesartan\nTable 2 shows hemodynamic and metabolic parameters in\nhypertensive patients treated with candesartan for six\nment (p < 0.0001).

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is\nthe first to estimate an effect of candesartan on a bone\nremodeling marker such as OPG.\nExperimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence\nhas shown that the RAAS plays an integral role in bone\nremodeling.\nUsing a chimeric model of transgenic hypertensive\nmouse expressing both the human renin as well as angio-\ntensinogen genes, it has been shown that activation of the\nRAAS induces high turnover osteoporosis with acceler-\nated bone resorption.11 Ex vivo cultures showed that Ang\nII increased osteoclastogenesis-supporting cytokines,\nRANKL and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),\nthereby stimulating the formation of osteoclasts. There\nhave been several reports on the effects of Ang II on bone\ncell function in vitro, including inhibition of osteoblastic\ndifferentiation and mineralization, stimulation of prolifer-\nation and collagen synthesis in osteoblasts, and stimulation\nof osteoclastic bone resorption.12,18,19 Furthermore, it was\nshown that ACEIs were effective in increasing BMD in\nwomen with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)\nDD polymorphism, which is associated with increased\nserum Ang II.20 However, ACEIs also regulate the brady-\nkinin-nitric oxide (NO) pathway as well as block Ang II\nproduction, different from ARBs. It is well known that the\nNO pathway regulates local blood flow in bone marrow\ncapillaries, which might enhance bone marrow formation.\nThus, the contribution of the NO pathway might have a\nrole in the prevention of osteoporosis by ACE inhibition.\nThe results of trials evaluating the effect of Ang II\nantagonist on bone metabolism are equivocal. It has been\nshown that administration of an Ang II antagonist, losar-\ntan, had no effect on bone metabolism in normal rats,16\nwhereas other Ang II type 1 receptor blocker, olmesartan,\nameliorates osteoclastogenesis through down-regulation\nof RANKL expression and improves bone density in ova-\nriectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats.17 Alterations\nFigure 1. Circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) by groups during the six-month follow-up.\nin the affinity to the Ang II receptor of the different repre-\nsentativeARBs may explain this variability.AmongARBs,\nolmesartan has been reported to show the highest level of\nbinding with the Ang II type 1 receptor and, thus, has a\nstronger and more sustained hypotensive effect than that of\nthe other ARBs. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of olme-\nsartan on albuminuria was prominent and not affected by\nthe dosing time, because olmesartan exhibits a strong anti-\nhypertensive effect that is sustained for 24 hours.\nFurthermore, additional properties such as reduction in\noxidative stress, stimulation of adipogenesis with subse-\nquent improvement in glucose transport and reduction in\nexpression of proinflammatory vascular cell adhesion\nmolecules, CRP and cytokines are different despite similar\nAnother important observation in our study is the\nincrease of CRP levels observed in the placebo group but\nnot in the candesartan group. The pre-and post-treatment\ncomparison of serum CRP levels was a secondary analysis\nand follows the statement that the between-group differ-\nence was not significant. Nevertheless, we think that the\nincrease in CRP levels observed in the placebo group but\nnot in the active treatment group is of interest. The findings\nof the present study concur with previous experimental and\nclinical trials that have demonstrated anti-inflammatory\nproperties of ARBs. Recently published data evaluated the\neffect of two different classes of antihypertensive agents,\nvalsartan and amlodipine, on CRP as well as osteopontin\n(OPN), a pleiotropic cytokine that has recently emerged as\na key factor in vascular remodeling and is regulated by the\nRAAS. The significant reduction of OPN levels was cor-\nrelated with the reduction of CRP levels, and the use of\nvalsartan as well as reduction of CRP were independent\ndeterminants of the reduction of OPN.23 Moreover, it has\nbeen shown that treatment with olmesartan as a mono-ther-\napy as well as co-therapy with pravastatin resulted in a\nhighly significant decrease of circulating levels of OPN in\na large cohort of patients with essential hypertension,\nwhereas OPN levels were correlated with a panel of adhe-\nsion molecules and inflammation markers such as interleu-\nkin-6 (IL-6), vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1),\nintercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and high-\nsensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).24\nThe present study has several limitations. We included\na relatively small number of participants, and larger stud-\nies are required to establish the impact of the RAAS block-\nade on bone metabolism as well as bone density and\nfractures rates to demonstrate the overall clinical impact of\nRAAS blockade in different populations, especially\npatients at increased risk for osteoporosis.\nAdditionally, since the present study focused on OPG\nassessment, the effect of candesartan treatment on differ-\nent bone remodeling markers such as OPN as well as\nRANKL and TRAIL expression will need to be evaluated\nby long-term studies in a hypertensive population.\nIn conclusion, significant changes in circulating OPG\nlevels in hypertensive patients treated with the ARB can-\ndesartan were not observed.
