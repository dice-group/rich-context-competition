This study estimates the effects of the transition to widowhood on changes in the social regulation of health\nand examines the consequences of this association for health and health risk behavior following spousal death.\nMethods. Analysis of longitudinal data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples Study tests the following\nhypotheses: (a) Widowed individuals experience greater declines in health regulation over time than their married\ncounterparts and (b) the extent to which widowhood undermines health and increases health risk behavior depends on\nwhether it is accompanied by a decline in health regulation.\nResults. Compared with their continually married counterparts, those who experience the transition to widowhood\nreport a significant decline in the frequency of health reminders and health assistance received from others. The decline in\nthe frequency of health regulation has important consequences for health behavior and health outcomes. Widowhood\nundermines health and increases health risk behaviors only when it is accompanied by a decline in health regulation.\nWidowed individuals who experience increases in health regulation show improvements in health and declines in health\nrisk behavior.\nDiscussion. Interventions targeted at improving the health habits of widowed individuals by mobilizing health-related\nsupport systems may be effective at minimizing the negative health consequences of spousal loss.\nASUBSTANTIAL body of evidence indicates that widow-\nhood is associated with declines in health and increases in\nmortality risk for surviving spouses (Martikainen & Valkonen,\nrange of mechanisms may account for this association,\nincluding the loss of social support, the stress of bereavement,\nand adjustments to managing a household alone (Ross,\nUmberson, Wortman, & Kessler, 1992). Research and theory\non the health benefits of marriage suggest that the social control\nand regulation of health provided by a spouse constitute an\nadditional mechanism that explains its salutary effects on health\ntend to encourage each other to engage in healthy behaviors\n(e.g., exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular\nmedical check-ups) and to avoid behaviors that might\ncompromise health (e.g., excessive alcohol consumption,\ncigarette smoking, and other forms of risk taking). Thus, the\ndeleterious health consequences of widowhood may be due in\npart to the loss of a primary source of health regulation.\nAlthough convincing evidence indicates that married individ-\nuals receive more frequent health-related reminders from\nsignificant others than the unmarried (Umberson, 1992), the\nimportance of this mechanism in explaining the negative health\nconsequences of widowhood, per se, remains largely un-\nexplored.\nThe aim of the current study is to examine the effects of the\ntransition to widowhood on the frequency of health reminders\nreceived from others. Previous research suggests that because\nspouses are a primary source of health reminders, the transition\nto widowhood will be associated with a decline in the\nfrequency of health regulation. I further hypothesize that\nchanges in the frequency of health regulation have important\nconsequences for the health and health-related behaviors of\nolder widowed adults. Specifically, whether the transition to\nwidowhood undermines health or increases risky health\nbehaviors should depend on the extent to which it is\naccompanied by a decline in the frequency of health regulation.\nWidowhood, Social Control, and Health: Understanding\nthe Pathways\nWidowhood appears to pose substantial health risks to\nsurviving spouses, especially to men (Martikainen & Valkonen,\nattempts to account for the negative effects of widowhood on\nhealth derives primarily from the larger research literature on\nthe association of marital status with health and well-being.\nDecades of research in the social and biological sciences\nindicate that married individuals feel healthier, have fewer\nillnesses, are less depressed, and live longer than the unmarried\nResearchers have only recently begun to identify and\nunderstand the mechanisms through which emotionally sup-\nportive social relationships, especially marriage, enhance\nhealth. The stress-alleviating role of social support has received\nthe most attention (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988).\nSupportive personal relationships such as marriage appear to\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2004 by The Gerontological Society of America\nenhance the immune system (Cohen, 1988; Kiecolt-Glaser &\nGlaser, 1987) and normalize cardiovascular reactivity to socio-\nenvironmental stressors (Cohen, 1988). In addition, the loss of\nthe marital role through divorce or widowhood is itself stressful\nand may expose individuals to additional strains such as financial\nproblems and secondary role changes (Booth & Amato, 1991;\nResearchers have given much less attention to examining the\nimportance of the controlling or regulatory functions of\nmarriage, which may promote healthy behaviors. According\nto this argument, marriage and other strong social ties affect\nhealth in part because significant others, especially spouses,\nencourage individuals to engage in behaviors that promote\nhealth (e.g., exercise, weight management) and to avoid risky\nbehaviors (e.g., smoking) (Umberson, 1992). In support of this\nidea, evidence indicates that married men are more likely than\nthe unmarried to have someone who reminds them to engage in\nhealth-enhancing behavior and to avoid practices that compro-\nmise health (Umberson, 1992). Further, the benefits of marriage\nfor health regulation seem to be especially important for men,\nin part because gender roles assign women primary responsi-\nbility for the care and health of the family (Nathanson, 1977;\nAlthough some research suggests that the health-regulatory\nfunctions of marriage are partly responsible for its salubrious\ninhibited stringent tests of this hypothesized causal pathway.\nMost significant is the lack of longitudinal data. In a cross-\nsectional study of marital status, social control, and health\nbehavior, Umberson (1992) found that being married is\nassociated with more frequent social control efforts. However,\nbecause socially isolated individuals are less likely than others\nto marry and less likely to receive frequent health reminders,\nselection of the most socially integrated individuals into\nmarriage may partly account for cross-sectional associations.\nIn the current study, measurement of the social regulation of\nhealth at more than one point in time allows for a more\nstringent test of a causal relationship because it facilitates the\nexamination of the effects of a marital transition (e.g.,\nwidowhood) on a subsequent change in the frequency of\nhealth reminders.\nIt is particularly important to understand the effects of the\ntransition to widowhood on health regulation, health risk\nbehaviors, and health outcomes. Because health declines more\nrapidly in later years when widowhood is most commonly\nexperienced, the widowed may be especially vulnerable to the\nnegative health consequences of unhealthy practices such as\nlack of exercise, improper nutrition, lack of sleep, or alcohol\nabuse--each of which may be influenced by the loss of\na spouse. In addition, socioemotional selectivity theory\nsuggests that widowhood may have especially significant\nconsequences for the control and regulation of health behaviors.\nAccording to this perspective, individuals narrow their social\nnetworks as they age and begin to focus more exclusively on\nprimary relationships such as marriage (Carstensen, 1992).\nThus, in later years, the spouse may become increasingly\nimportant as a source of both social support and the social\nregulation of health. If this is true, exiting marriage in later life\nthrough widowhood may have especially strong negative\neffects on health behavior and overall health status.\nThe Current Study\nPrior research has given little attention to establishing clear\nlinkages between marital status, the social regulation of health,\nand actual health outcomes. Marriage appears to be associated\nwith healthier behavior (Umberson, 1987) and more frequent\nhealth regulation (Umberson, 1992). More frequent regulation\nof health is, in turn, associated with positive changes in health\nentire research literatures in public health and health psychol-\nogy document the substantial effects of health behavior on self-\nassessed health, morbidity, and mortality. However, the\nfollowing possibility remains unexamined: The extent to which\nwidowhood undermines health and compromises healthy\nbehavior may depend on whether the transition is accompanied\nby a decline in the frequency of health reminders.\nIn fact, a central hypothesis of the current study is that the\ntransition to widowhood undermines health and healthy\nbehaviors only when it is accompanied by a decline in the\nfrequency of health regulation. Although I expect that the\ntransition to widowhood will be generally associated with\na decline in the frequency of health reminders (largely due to\nthe loss of the spouse--a primary source of such reminders), it\nmay lead to an increase in health regulation for those who\neffectively mobilize social support or for those whose spouse\ndid not provide frequent health reminders in the first place.\nWhen widowhood is accompanied by an increase in health\nreminders, the health and health-related behaviors of the\nwidowed should not decline and may even improve. Support\nfor these hypotheses could have important implications for\nmedical professionals and others who provide services to\nwidowed adults because it would suggest that health promotion\nefforts have great potential for reducing any negative effects of\nwidowhood on morbidity, mortality, and overall health status. It\nis important to note that although prior research indicates that\nmen may be especially vulnerable to the loss of health\nregulation with the death of a spouse, currently available\nlongitudinal data on widowhood and health regulation do not\ninclude a sufficient number of men to allow a meaningful\nanalysis of gender differences.\nMETHODS\nData\nData are from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC)\nStudy, which is a multiwave, prospective study of spousal\nbereavement. Two-stage area probability sampling from the\nDetroit (Michigan) Standardized Metropolitan Statistical Area\nwas used to recruit a sample of 1,532 married men and women.\nEligible respondents were English-speaking members of a mar-\nried couple in which the husband was age 65 or older. The\nresponse rate for the baseline interview was 68% and is consistent\nwith response rates obtained in similar studies in this area.\nInterviewers conducted face-to-face interviews lasting ap-\nResearchers tracked subsequent spousal death using monthly\ndeath records provided by the state of Michigan and by\nmonitoring the daily obituaries in Detroit-area newspapers.\nConfirmation of death and identification of the cause of death\nwere obtained from the National Death Index and from direct\nWILLIAMS\nexamination of death certificates. Of the 335 respondents\nknown to have lost a spouse during the study period, 316 were\ncontacted for follow-up interviews (19 of those who lost\na spouse died themselves during the interim). Of those\ncontacted, 263 (83%) participated in at least one of the three\nfollow-up interviews, which were conducted 6 months (T1), 18\nmonths (T2), and 48 months (T3) after the spouse's death. At\neach follow-up, every widowed person was assigned a same-\nsex, same-age-matched, nonbereaved control from the baseline\nsample who was also interviewed. Although all control subjects\nwere interviewed in the baseline sample, a given widowed\nperson may have been assigned a different age- and sex-\nmatched control at different waves (i.e., the control sample is\nnot the same at successive waves).\nAnalyses in the current study were weighted to adjust for\ndifferential response rates at baseline and unequal probabilities\nof selection. All models use data from the baseline (T0) sample\nwho were interviewed at 18 months post widowhood (T2) and\nwhose spouse was not living in a nursing home at the baseline\ninterview. Although preliminary analyses suggested that widow-\nhood may have different consequences for those whose spouse\ndies while in a nursing home, the small number of such\nrespondents prohibited meaningful analysis of these differences.\nMeasures\nTransition to widowhood. --A dummy variable indicates\nwhether respondents experienced a transition to widowhood\nbetween the baseline and T2 interviews. The variable is coded so\nthat 1 \u00bc transition to widowhood and 0 \u00bc continually married.\nSocial regulation of health. --The social regulation of health\nwas assessed at each wave with two items in which respondents\nwere asked to indicate how often someone (a) reminds you to\ndo things to protect your own health and (b) helps you to take\nmedications, eat a special diet for health reasons, or use health\ncare treatments at home (among those who are required to\nengage in these behaviors). Response categories for each item\nranged from never (1) to often (3). I standardized each item\nusing the baseline mean and standard deviation. For those who\nengaged in the behaviors outlined in item (b) above, I computed\nthe arithmetic mean of the two items. I used only the response\non item (a) for those who did not engage in the behaviors\ndescribed in item (b).\nChange in the social regulation of health among the\ncontinually widowed is included in some models. This variable\nwas constructed by subtracting the T0 value of health\nregulation from the T2 value and centering the difference at\nthe mean. I used an internal moderator of health regulation\nchange among the widowed to test the hypothesis that widowed\nindividuals experience a decline in health and an increase in\nhealth risk behaviors compared with the continually married\ncontrol group only when widowhood is accompanied by\na decline in health regulation. Therefore, I assigned a score of\n0 (the mean) to the continually married on this internal\nmoderator variable.\nRisky health behavior. --I constructed a dichotomous in-\ndicator of risky health behavior by assigning a code of 1 to\nthose individuals who reported any of the following four health\nbehaviors or conditions: (a) rarely or never walks or exercises\nfor pleasure and rarely or never participates in active sports or\nexercise; (b) has an unhealthy body weight (defined as a body\nmass index of ,18.5 or .25) (U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services, 2000); (c) currently smokes cigarettes;\n(d) gets ,7 hours of sleep per 24-hour period, including naps.\nHealth outcomes. --Two health outcomes were examined.\nSelf-assessed fair or poor health was constructed by di-\nchotomizing responses to the following question: ``How would\nyou rate your health at the present time?'' Responses of ``fair''\nand ``poor'' were combined into a single category and assigned\na code of 1. Those who responded ``good,'' ``very good,'' or\n``excellent'' received a code of 0. Self-assessed health is widely\nrecognized as a valid indicator of overall health status (Ferraro\n& Farmer, 1999) and is predictive of subsequent mortality\n(Idler & Kasl, 1991). Additional analyses in which this variable\nwas kept in its original ordinal form indicate that results from\nthe two approaches are very similar, but the dichotomized\nindicator produces slightly more robust results. Moreover,\nordered probit regression is appropriate when the self-assessed\nhealth variable is kept in its ordered form, and these results are\noften difficult for the lay reader to interpret.\nMorbidity is a dichotomous variable coded 1 if, in the last 6\nmonths, the respondent had one or more serious illnesses and\n0 if no serious illnesses were reported. The range of possible\nillnesses included lung disease, hypertension, heart disease,\ndiabetes, cancer, and stroke.\nSociodemographic and other control variables. --All models\ncontrol for a range of sociodemographic variables including sex\n(1 \u00bc female), education in years, age in years, race (1 \u00bc White),\nand total household income in dollars at baseline. Respondents\nprovided their total household income at baseline by indicating\nwhich of 10 income categories most accurately characterized\ntheir economic status. The midpoint of these categories was\nused to derive a continuous indicator of income. All models\nalso control for whether or not the spouse had an illness or\ndisability at baseline that required the provision of care (1 \u00bc\nyes). The provision of care to a spouse at baseline is positively\nassociated with subsequent widowhood but may also affect the\nbaseline measurement of health and health behaviors, especially\nwhen the baseline assessment is taken near the time of\nwidowhood.\nTime from baseline to widowhood. --A strength of the\nCLOC Study is that the time from widowhood to subsequent\nfollow-up interviews (12 months in the current study) is\nstandardized for all respondents. This eliminates the possibility\nthat group variations in time since widowhood are responsible\nfor group variations in the estimated effects of widowhood on\nwell-being. This approach, however, produces variation across\nindividuals in the amount of time elapsed between (a) the\nbaseline measurement and the death of the spouse and,\ntherefore, between (b) the baseline measurement and the\nfollow-up interview. In the current study, models assessing\nchange in health associated with the transition to widowhood\nestimate this association across a range of time periods. All\nanalyses control for the number of months between baseline\nand follow-up.\nMeans. --Weighted means and standard deviations of all\nvariables in the analysis are presented separately for widowed\nsubjects and the continually married in Table 1. Although\nwidowed and married individuals are closely matched on most\nsociodemographic characteristics, two noteworthy differences\nexist. First, those who experience the transition to widowhood\nbetween T0 and T2 report lower levels of health regulation both\nT2). This suggests that declines in health that accompany the\ntransition to widowhood may begin before the spouse's death,\nespecially when the death is preceded by a period of illness.\nAdditional analyses (not shown) indicate that the lower levels\nof health regulation preceding widowhood may be due in part\nto the provision of care to a sick or dying spouse at baseline--\na situation that is more common among widowed (.251) than\nmarried (.063) persons. The illness of a spouse not only reduces\nthe health regulation within marriage but may also isolate the\ncaregiver from other sources of health reminders (e.g., friends,\nrelatives). All longitudinal analyses in the current study include\na control for baseline differences in health regulation as well as\na dummy variable indicating whether the spouse required care\nat baseline. Although this approach should produce more\nconservative estimates of the effect of widowhood on health\n(especially among those for whom health regulation begins to\ndecline prior to widowhood), it helps to isolate the effects of the\ndeath of the spouse from (a) widowhood-related processes that\nbegin prior to the spouse's death and (b) any tendency of those\nwho infrequently engage in health regulation to be selected into\nwidowhood.\nSecond, although the average change in health regulation for\nthe widowed is negative, the average change in health\nregulation for the continually married is positive. Thus, whereas\nwidowed individuals experience a general decline in the\nfrequency of health regulation over time, their continually\nmarried counterparts experience an increase. This latter finding\nsuggests that, among the married, spouses and others may step\nup their health regulation efforts as individuals age and\nencounter age-related health problems of their own and health\nproblems and deaths of their contemporaries.\nAnalytic strategy. --All models control for the lagged\n(baseline) value of the dependent variable. The sign of\ncoefficients in lagged dependent variable models reflects the\ndirection of change in the dependent variable across the period\nof time under consideration (Kessler & Greenberg, 1981).\nThus, in the current models, a positive coefficient for the\ntransition to widowhood indicates that the transition is\nassociated with an increase in the dependent variable over\ntime (or an increase in the probability of scoring a 1 on\na dichotomous dependent variable), and a negative coefficient\nreflects a decrease in the dependent variable (or a decrease in\nthe probability of scoring a 1 on a dichotomous dependent\nvariable) relative to the change that is experienced by the\ncontinually married control group. Because this approach\nestimates the effect of the transition to widowhood on a change\nin the outcome of interest, it reduces the probability that\nobserved associations reflect selection of the least healthy\nindividuals (or those who receive little health regulation) into\nthe widowed status, perhaps due to an unhealthy environment\nshared by both spouses.\nRESULTS\nTransition to Widowhood and Social Regulation of\nHealth\nI first estimate the effect of the transition to widowhood on\nthe frequency of health regulation at 18 months post widow-\nhood, while controlling for prewidowhood health regulation.\nThe results are shown in Table 2 and support my primary\nhypothesis that, on average, the transition to widowhood\nTable 1.

Those who\nexperience the transition to widowhood report substantially\nlower levels of health regulation post widowhood than their\ncontinually married counterparts, controlling for prewidowhood\ndifferences in health regulation. In sum, the transition to\nwidowhood appears to be associated with a substantial and\nsignificant decline in the frequency of health regulation\ncompared with remaining continually married.\nIt is important to note that the means shown in Table 1\nindicate that, on average, widowed persons experience a small\ndecline in health regulation over time and married persons\nreport a small increase. Therefore, an accurate interpretation of\nthe multivariate results shown in Table 2 recognizes that\nwidowhood is associated with a decline in the frequency of\nhealth regulation relative to the change experienced by the\ncontinually married. Thus, the estimated negative effect of the\ntransition to widowhood on the frequency of health regulation\nshown in Table 2 exists because (a) widowed persons\nexperience an average decline in the frequency of health\nregulation over time and (b) widowed persons do not receive\nthe benefits of increased health regulation over time that the\ncontinually married experience. In sum, although widowhood\nappears to somewhat undermine health regulation for the\naverage person, it also comes at a time (in this sample) when\nhealth regulation is likely more important than ever, as\nevidenced by the increase in health regulation that occurs\namong the continually married.\nTransition to Widowhood, Risky Health Behavior, and\nHealth Outcomes\nModels assessing the impact of the transition to widowhood\non change in (a) the probability of exhibiting risky health\nbehavior, (b) the probability of reporting fair or poor self-\nassessed health, and (c) the probability of having a serious\nillness are shown in Table 3. For each dependent variable,\nModel 1 is the base model before interaction terms are entered.\nThe internal moderator of absolute health regulation change\namong the widowed is added in Model 2. Note that the internal\nmoderator does not assess health regulation change relative to\nthe continually married. Rather, it captures absolute declines in\nhealth regulation over time among the widowed. Preliminary\nmodels also assessed age differences in the effects of the\ntransition to widowhood (age 3 widowhood) on each outcome\nand age differences in the moderating effect of health regulation\nchange (age 3 health regulation change among the widowed).\nAge interactions terms were significant only in models\npredicting serious illness and are included in Model 2 for this\ndependent variable.\nThe significant coefficients for health regulation change\namong the widowed (health regulation change T0\u00adT2 3\nwidowhood) in all models support the primary hypotheses of\nthis study. The extent to which widowhood increases unhealthy\nbehaviors, undermines health, and increases morbidity risk\nrelative to remaining continually married depends on whether it\nis accompanied by an absolute decline in the social regulation\nof health. Specifically, the transition to widowhood is\nassociated with an increase in risky health behavior only when\nit is accompanied by a decline in the frequency of health\nregulation. For example, among those for whom widowhood is\naccompanied by a 1-SD decline in health regulation, the\ntransition to widowhood is associated with a .535 increase in\nthe log odds of engaging in risky health behavior (\u00c0.345 \u00fe\naccompanied by a 1-SD increase in health regulation, it is\nassociated with a 1.225 decrease in the log odds of engaging in\nwith the change experienced by the continually married.\nSimilarly, becoming widowed is associated with an increase\nin the probability of reporting fair or poor health, but only when\nit is accompanied by a decline in health regulation. For\nexample, when widowhood is accompanied by a 1-SD decline\nin health regulation, it is associated with a .011 increase in the\n\u00c01] \u00bc .011). In fact, when widowhood is accompanied by\na substantial 2-SD increase in health regulation, it results in an\nimprovement in health--a 1.249 decrease in the log odds of\nThe significant three-way interaction of widowhood and\nhealth regulation change with age indicates that the role\nof health regulation change in moderating the impact of\nTable 3.

This association is\nshown in Figure 1, which was constructed by calculating the\nestimated probability of reporting a serious illness at Time 2\nfor those experiencing the transition to widowhood at various\nlevels of health regulation change and for the control group\nof continually married adults. The predicted probability of a\nserious illness for the widowed individuals at each level of\nhealth regulation change is then subtracted from the predicted\nvalue for the control group. The y-axis therefore shows the\nestimated effect of the transition to widowhood on a change in\nthe probability of a serious illness at each level of health\nregulation change, within the range of the data.\nFor 50- and 60-year-olds, the general pattern of association is\nsimilar to that observed for self-assessed health and risky health\nbehaviors: increases in morbidity for the widowed persons who\nexperience declines in health regulation and decreases in\nmorbidity for the widowed persons who experience increases in\nhealth regulation. However, for 70-year-olds, although the\ntransition to widowhood is associated with a decline in\nmorbidity risk when it is accompanied by increased health\nregulation, it does not significantly increase morbidity risk even\nwhen health regulation declines. Similarly, for 80-year-olds,\nwidowhood appears to be associated with a small decline in\nmorbidity risk even when it is accompanied by a decline in\nhealth regulation. The decline in morbidity risk associated with\nwidowhood among the oldest adults likely reflects relief from\nthe strains associated with living with a sick or dying spouse.\nResearch indicates that older adults more often find themselves\nin the caregiver role and may be especially vulnerable to the\nstrains associated with providing care to a spouse (Marks,\n1996). Thus, the health of older adults may improve when\nwidowhood brings relief from care-provider strains.\nDISCUSSION\nContrary to the common belief that individuals often become\nill or die soon after the death of a spouse, the current study\nindicates that declines in health with widowhood are not\ninevitable. Instead, they are largely dependent on a process that\nis highly amenable to intervention: the social regulation of\nhealth. Two central findings support this conclusion. First,\nwidowed individuals report substantial declines in the fre-\nquency of health reminders compared with the continually mar-\nried. This reflects absolute declines in health reminders that\naccompany the transition to widowhood as well as the fact that\nthe widowed do not receive the advantage of increased health\nregulation over time that their married counterparts report.\nSecond, widowhood increases unhealthy practices, increases\nthe probability of experiencing a serious illness, and increases\nthe probability of reporting fair or poor health but only for those\nwidowed individuals who experience an absolute decline in\nhealth reminders and assistance received from others. Although\nwidowhood poses health risks, the current findings suggest that\ndeclines in health that tend to accompany widowhood are not\ninevitable. In fact, when widowhood results in increased health\nregulation, it may have positive consequences for some health\noutcomes.\nA limitation of the current analysis is the inability to assess\ngender differences in the links between widowhood, health\nregulation, health behavior, and health outcomes. Cross-\nsectional research indicates that because women more fre-\nquently regulate the health of their spouse than do men, the\npositive influence of marriage on healthy behaviors is greater\nfor men than for women (Umberson, 1987). Because widow-\nhood is much more common among women than among men,\nthe small number of men in the sample did not allow for\nseparate analyses by gender. It is likely that the effects of\nwidowhood on declines in health regulation are stronger among\nmen than women.\nThe current findings have important implications for medical\npractitioners, counselors, family members, and others interested\nin promoting adjustment to spousal bereavement. Greater\nattention to the health practices of older adults following\nwidowhood may go a long way toward offsetting the negative\nFigure 1. Estimated effect of the transition to widowhood on probability (Pr) of having a serious illness by age and change in health regulation.\nWILLIAMS\nconsequences of widowhood. It is important to note, however,\nthat not all attempts at health regulation are likely to be\nbeneficial. Some evidence indicates that negative social control\ntactics (e.g., pressure, inducing guilt) have little effect on\nbehavior change and may undermine psychological well-being\nand physical health (Lewis & Rock, 1999). Thus, the\nassociations observed here would likely be more robust if\nhealth reminders that are delivered and received in a positive\nmanner were distinguished from those perceived as negative.\nMoreover, being responsible for regulating another's health\nmay generate stress that can undermine the health of the person\nproviding health regulation and assistance.\nThe results of the current study suggest that health regulation\nis a primary mechanism through which marriage (and, perhaps,\nother personal relationships) influences health. However, much\nremains to be discovered about the dynamics of health\nregulation in marriage. A list of desiderata for future data\ncollection efforts includes (a) longitudinal assessments of\nvarious dimensions of health regulation activities (including\ngeneral health reminders and more targeted efforts to encourage\nspecific behavior such as weight management, nutritious eating,\nsmoking cessation, and exercise), (b) dyadic data from both\nparticipants in the health regulation process, (c) measures of\nhow health reminders are perceived by the receiver and the\nprovider (positive, negative, helpful, stressful), and (d)\na sufficient sample size to allow for the examination of gender,\nrace, socioeconomic, and life course variations in the predictors\nand consequences of health regulation.\nBetter data would allow researchers to investigate the\nprocesses through which dyads exchange health reminders\nand determine which conditions enhance the efficacy of health\nregulation efforts. Future research should also identify the\nsocial and contextual factors that characterize those individuals\nwho are most likely to experience declines in health regulation\nwith widowhood. Such information would be of great value in\ndesigning targeted interventions for those at greatest risk of\nhealth decline following widowhood. The results of the current\nstudy optimistically suggest that these declines are not\ninevitable.\n"
