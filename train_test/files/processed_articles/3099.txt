Sociodemographic correlates of treatment were far less numerous\nthan those of prevalence.\nConclusions Major depressive disorder is a common disorder, widely distributed in\nthe population, and usually associated with substantial symptom severity and role im-\npairment. While the recent increase in treatment is encouraging, inadequate treat-\nment is a serious concern. Emphasis on screening and expansion of treatment needs\nto be accompanied by a parallel emphasis on treatment quality improvement.\nDiagnosticandStatisticalManualofMen-\ntalDisorders,RevisedThirdEdition(DSM-\nIII-R) criteria.10 The NCS age range was\norolderintheECA.Theprevalenceesti-\nmatesofMDDintheNCSweresubstan-\ntially higher than in the ECA: 14.9% for\nDespitetheirdifferentprevalenceesti-\nmates, the ECA and NCS results were\nvery similar in finding early age of onset\ncal study showed that the ECA-NCS\nprevalence differences in the age range\ntiallyreducedbycombiningthe2waves\nof ECA data to make up for the memory\nprimingstrategiesandrespondentmoti-\nvation techniques used in the NCS.15\nAlthoughtheestimatednumberofin-\ndividualsinthetotalpopulationwhoseek\ntreatmentforamentalhealthproblemin\na given year was somewhat lower in the\nmonth treatment among respondents\nwhometcriteriaforMDDwashigherin\nthe ECA (53.9%) than in the NCS\nthatthehigherNCSprevalenceestimate\nincludedmoremildcases,withpatients\nwith mild MDD less likely to seek treat-\nment.

The even higher NCS es-\ntimates, which were published only\nafter the DSM-IV criteria were estab-\nlished, only reinforced this concern.15\nIndeed, a recent critique of the ECA and\nNCS argued that a substantial propor-\ntion of respondents classified as cases\nwere clinically insignificant, leading to\nan overestimation of the 12-month de-\npression prevalence of 29% in the ECA\ncritique was based on the use of im-\nprecise indicators for severity symp-\ntoms, raising questions about ad-\njusted prevalence estimates.30\nBased on the introduction of the\nDSM-IVcriteria,inconjunctionwithevi-\ndence of changes in treatment over the\npast decade, a new national survey of\nmental disorders was conducted in\nupdate information on the prevalence,\ncorrelates, and clinical significance of\nDSM disorders, and to study patterns\nand correlates of treatment and treat-\nmentadequacy.Thecurrentreportisthe\nfirstpresentationofresultsfromthisnew\nsurvey, the National Comorbidity Sur-\nvey Replication (NCS-R).31\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nThe NCS-R is a nationally representa-\ntive face-to-face household survey of\nselectedfromamultistageareaprobabil-\nity sample of the noninstitutionalized\ncivilian population in the 48 contigu-\nousstates.Theresponseratewas73.0%.\nAllrespondentswereadministeredapart\n1diagnosticinterviewasdescribedbelow,\npart 2 interview that included assess-\nmentsofriskfactorsandadditionalmen-\ntal disorders.

The sample\nreceiving part 2 was additionally\nweighted to adjust for differential prob-\nabilities of selection. The weighted\nsample distributions closely match\nthose of the US population on a vari-\nety of sociodemographic and geo-\ngraphic variables (TABLE 1).\nA probability sample of 308 NCS-R\nrespondents completed a clinical reap-\npraisalinterviewtoevaluatelifetimediag-\nnoses, and a nonoverlapping probabil-\nitysampleof335respondentscompleted\naseparatereappraisalinterviewtoevalu-\nate 12-month diagnoses.

Interviewers explained the study\nprocedures and obtained verbal in-\nformed consent before beginning the in-\nterview. Participants received $50 as a\ngift to thank them for participating. Re-\ncruitment and consent procedures were\napproved by the human subjects com-\nmittees of both Harvard Medical School\nand the University of Michigan.\nMeasures\nDiagnostic Assessment. The NCS-R di-\nagnostic instrument was an expanded\nversion of the WHO's CIDI,9 a fully\nstructured instrument for use by trained\ninterviewerswhodonothaveclinicalex-\nperience. Diagnoses are based on\nDSM-IV criteria.28 Organic exclusions\nanddiagnostichierarchyruleswereboth\napplied in making diagnoses. In addi-\ntion to the prevalence and correlates of\nMDD, in this article we also report co-\nmorbidity with anxiety disorders (panic\ndisorder,agoraphobiawithoutpanic,so-\ncial anxiety disorder, specific phobia,\ngeneralized anxiety disorder, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, and posttrau-\nmaticstressdisorder),substanceusedis-\norders (alcohol and drug abuse and\ndependence), and a group of disorders\nthat we refer to as \"impulse-control dis-\norders\" (intermittent explosive disor-\nder, antisocial personality disorder, bu-\nlimia, and pathological gambling).\nPrevious methodological research\ndocumented acceptable-to-good con-\ncordance between the NCS/CIDI diag-\nnoses and blind clinical diagnoses, but\nfound that the NCS CIDI overdiag-\nnosed MDD because of false-positive\nassessments of dysphoria and anhedo-\nnia.32 The CIDI false-positive assess-\nments included both respondents with\nclinically nonsignificant distress and\nthose whose symptoms did not persist\nfor most of the day, nearly every day,\nor for 2 weeks or longer. The NCS-R\nrevisions attempted to correct these\nproblems by including explicit probes\nfor severity of dysphoria and anhedo-\nnia, by requiring clinically significant\ndistress or impairment associated with\nthese symptoms, and by asking sepa-\nrate questions about symptom dura-\ntion (hours per day, days per week, and\nduration of depressive episodes).\nThe core of the clinical reappraisal\ninterviewswasthestructuredclinicalin-\nterview for DSM-IV (SCID),33 a diagnos-\ntic interview that requires clinical exper-\ntisetoadminister.Nonaffectivepsychosis\nandmaniawerenotincludedintheSCID\nbecause they are being assessed in sepa-\nrate, in-progress, focused reappraisal\nstudies.

All respon-\ndents to part 2 of the NCS-R were asked\nabout receiving 12-month treatment for\nemotional problems, the type of profes-\nsional seen, as well as use of support\ngroups, self-help groups, and hotlines.\nNumber and duration of 12-month vis-\nits also were assessed. Responses were\nused to classify 12-month treatment in\nthe specialty mental health (SMH) sec-\ntor (inpatient treatment or outpatient\ntreatment with a psychiatrist, psycholo-\ngist, any other mental health profes-\nsional, or a social worker or counselor\nin a mental health specialty setting, or\nuse of a hotline), the general medical\n(GM) sector (outpatient treatment with\na primary care physician, other medi-\ncal specialist, nurse, or any other health\nprofessional not previously mentioned),\nthe human services (HS) sector (outpa-\ntient treatment with a religious or spiri-\ntual advisor or with a social worker or\ncounselorinanysettingotherthanaspe-\ncialty mental health setting), and the\ncomplementary-alternative medical\n(CAM)sector(outpatienttreatmentwith\nany other type of healer, participation\nin an internet support group, or partici-\npation in a self-help group). In addi-\ntion, a pharmaco-epidemiologic sec-\ntion asked respondents about use of\npsychotropic medications in the past 12\nmonths. Information was recorded by\nhaving respondents give their medi-\ncine bottles to the interviewer to in-\nspect and to record the type of medica-\ntion, duration of treatment, maximum\nprescribed dose, and specialty of pre-\nscribing physician.\nBased on the above data, minimally\nadequate medical treatment for MDD\nwas defined as receiving either (1) at\nleast 4 outpatient visits with any type of\nphysician for pharmacotherapy that in-\ncluded use of either an antidepressant\nor mood stabilizer for a minimum of 30\ndays or (2) at least 8 outpatient visits\nwith any professional in the specialty\nmental health sector for psycho-\ntherapylastingameanofatleast30min-\nutes.

A standard bat-\ntery of sociodemographic variables (eg,\nage, sex, employment status, educa-\ntion, income) was administered to all\nrespondents. In addition, sample in-\nformation was linked to interview lo-\ncation records to classify each respon-\ndent by major census region (Northeast,\nMidwest, South, and West), and by the\nDepartment of Agriculture's urban-\nrural continuum of counties (major\nmetropolitan counties, other urban-\nized counties, and rural counties).\nInterviewer Training\nand Field Quality Control\nProfessionallayinterviewersfromtheIn-\nstitute for Social Research at the Univer-\nsityofMichiganadministeredtheNCS-R.\nMore than 300 interviewers partici-\npated in the study, each receiving 7 days\nof study-specific training and success-\nfullycompleting2practiceinterviewsbe-\nfore beginning production work.

None of these\nmeasures was significantly related to ad-\nequate treatment after adjusting statis-\ntically for clinical variables.\nCOMMENT\nThe NCS-R MDD prevalence esti-\nmates are intermediate between the\nECA and NCS estimates. Concor-\ndance between CIDI and clinical reap-\npraisal diagnoses in the NCS-R is higher\nthan in previous DIS and CIDI sur-\nveys.32,45 In addition, the QIDS-SR con-\nMDD cases. This improved accuracy is\npresumably because of CIDI modifica-\ntions in the NCS-R. The lower CIDI\nprevalence estimates than those in the\nNCS are consistent with the fact that\nthese modifications operated largely by\nreducing false-positive assessments.\nThe ratio of 12-month CIDI MDD\nprevalence to lifetime prevalence being\napproximately 40% is broadly consis-\ntent with ratios between one third and\none half in previous epidemiologic sur-\nveys.46,47 These ratios are consistent with\nboth retrospective reports in cross-\nsectionalcommunitysurveys7,11 andpro-\nspective assessments in a small number\nin suggesting that MDD is an episodi-\ncally chronic recurrent disorder.51\nThe NCS-R age-at-onset results are\nconsistent with previous surveys in\nfinding that MDD has an early onset dis-\nhort effect in NCS-R also is consistent\nrelated differential recall, differential\nwillingness to disclose, or other meth-\nodologic factors could play important\ngenuine increase in the prevalence of\nMDD in recent cohorts might have\nTable 9.
