    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Overweight and obesity have become a global epidemic. The prevalence of overweight and obesity\namong U.S. adolescents has almost tripled in the last 30 years. Results from recent systematic reviews demonstrate\nthat no single, particular intervention or strategy successfully assists overweight or obese adolescents in losing\nweight. An understanding of factors that influence healthy weight-loss behaviors among overweight and obese\nfemale adolescents promotes effective, multi-component weight-loss interventions. There is limited evidence\ndemonstrating associations between demographic variables, body-mass index, and weight perception among\nfemale adolescents trying to lose weight. There is also a lack of previous studies examining the association of the\naccuracy of female adolescents' weight perception with their efforts to lose weight. This study, therefore, examined\nthe associations of body-mass index, weight perception, and weight-perception accuracy with trying to lose\nweight and engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method among a representative sample of U.S. female\nadolescents.\nMethods: A nonexperimental, descriptive, comparative secondary analysis design was conducted using data from\nWave II (1996) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Data representative of U.S.\nfemale adolescents (N = 2216) were analyzed using STATA statistical software. Descriptive statistics and survey\nweight logistic regression were performed to determine if demographic and independent (body-mass index,\nweight perception, and weight perception accuracy) variables were associated with trying to lose weight and\nengaging in exercise as a weight-loss method.\nResults: Age, Black or African American race, body-mass index, weight perception, and weight perceptions\naccuracy were consistently associated with the likeliness of trying to lose weight among U.S. female adolescents.\nAge, body-mass index, weight perception, and weight-perception accuracy were positively associated (p < 0.05)\nwith trying to lose weight. Black/African American subjects were significantly less likely than their White\ncounterparts to be trying to lose weight. There was no association between demographic or independent variables\nand engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method.\nConclusions: Findings suggest that factors influencing weight-loss efforts, including age, race, body-mass index,\nweight perception, and weight-perception accuracy, should be incorporated into existing or new multi-component\nweight-loss interventions for U.S. adolescent females in order to help reduce the national epidemic of overweight\nand obesity among U.S. female adolescents.\n* Correspondence: jyost@mcmaster.ca\n1School of Nursing, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, CA, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2010 Yost et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The latest estimates among chil-\ndren and adolescents in 34 countries indicate a preva-\nlence of overweight ranging from 5.1% to 25.4% and\nobesity from 0.4% to 7.9%. Overweight and obesity also\nrepresent a national epidemic in the United States,\nwhere the prevalence of overweight and obesity has\nalmost tripled among children and adolescents in the\nlast 30 years. Data from the National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey indicate the prevalence of over-\nweight U.S. adolescents (12 to 19 years old) increased\nthe United States second among countries with the\nhighest incidence of overweight and obesity (25.1%) [1,3]\nUnder the influence of numerous factors, overweight\nand obesity develop from an imbalance between energy\nintake and expenditure [4,5]. Overweight and obesity in\nchildhood and adolescence can lead to consequences\nextending into adulthood, such as type 2 diabetes,\nhypertension, atherosclerosis, and poor quality of life\n[4]. To avoid such consequences, developing effective\ninterventions for overweight and obese children and\nadolescents has become a major public health issue [6].\nResults from recent systematic reviews demonstrate that\nno single, particular intervention or strategy successfully\nassists overweight or obese adolescents in losing weight\n[7,8]. Instead, researchers suggest that effective interven-\ntions for adolescents consist of multiple components,\nincluding behaviour skills, behaviour change, and paren-\ntal involvement to promote healthy diet and nutrition\nand to increase physical activity (PA)/exercise [7-9].\nDespite recommendations for healthy weight-loss\nbehaviours, adolescents engage in numerous unhealthy\nweight-loss behaviours [10], such as taking diet pills,\nlaxatives, and diuretics, employing self-induced vomit-\ning, and skipping meals [11-14]. Evidence suggests that\nfemale adolescents engage in unhealthy weight-loss\nbehaviours more frequently than do male adolescents\n[11,13]. In addition, unhealthy weight-loss behaviours\nare more likely to occur among overweight or obese\nfemale adolescents [15,16] and among female adoles-\ncents who perceive themselves to be overweight or\nobese [17,18]. Consequently, female adolescents need\neffective, multi-component, weight-loss interventions\nthat promote healthy weight-loss behaviours.\nAn increased understanding of factors that influence\nfemale adolescents' desire to lose weight and their\nchoice of health-promoting weight-loss behaviours will\nhelp develop more effective weight-loss interventions.\nTherefore, the purpose of the present study was to\ndetermine whether body-mass index (BMI) and weight\nperception are associated with trying to lose weight and\nengaging in exercise as a weight-loss method among\nU.S. female adolescents.\nReview of the Literature\nThe following literature review was conducted in order\nto identify what is known and not known about the\nvariables under consideration in this secondary analysis\nstudy. The strengths of previously conducted studies\nconsidering similar variables included the use of large\nprobability samples representative of U.S. and interna-\ntional populations of adolescents, objective measure-\nments of height and weight, and consideration of\nassociations between variables and trying to lose weight\namong female adolescents. However, these previous\nrelevant studies also included the following limitations:\nconvenience samples that limited generalizability beyond\nthe studies' population; participants' self-reports of\nheight and weight; and the researchers' use of tools\nwith insufficiently reported and/or lack of validity and\nreliability, which undermined external and internal\nvalidity and included various classifications of actual\nweight (BMI) and weight perception. Considering such\nlimitations and in an effort to improve the ability to\nsynthesize previous findings, only studies that used\nprobability-sampling methods were included in the fol-\nlowing literature review.\nResearchers report a significant percentage of adoles-\ncents are trying to lose weight, ranging from approxi-\nin Quebec, Canada [20]. The most consistent demo-\ngraphic finding is that female adolescents in the United\nmore likely to be trying to lose weight than are their\nmale counterparts. For example, Ojala et al. [22]. esti-\nmated that, among their sample of adolescents from\nover 30 countries, 19.8% female adolescents were trying\nto lose weight compared to 7.5% male adolescents in\nA limited number of studies have considered demo-\ngraphic variables other than nationality, such as race/\nethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status (SES), among\nadolescents trying to lose weight. Research findings of\nU.S. adolescents demonstrate either that no relationship\nexists between race/ethnicity and trying to lose weight\n[21] or that Black/African American female adolescents\nare less likely to be trying to lose weight than their His-\npanic and White/non-Hispanic White counterparts\n[11,25]. In addition, study findings show a significant\npositive relationship between age and trying to lose\nweight in U.S. adolescents [26] and worldwide [22], in\nthat older adolescents are more likely to be trying to\nlose weight. Lastly, among demographic variables in a\nsample of female adolescents from five major U.S. cities,\nresearchers found no evidence of a relationship between\nSES (as measured by parental education) and trying to\ncontrol or lose weight [21].\nPrevious study findings indicate BMI and weight per-\nception are associated with obese and overweight ado-\nlescents' efforts to lose weight. Researchers report that a\nsignificant positive association exists between trying to\nlose weight and BMI among adolescents in the United\nfindings indicate that obese female adolescents are sig-\nnificantly more likely to be trying to lose weight than\noverweight female adolescents [22]. Researchers also\nreport that a relatively large percentage of U.S. adoles-\ncents who perceive themselves as overweight are trying\nto lose weight (70.3%) [26], with greater percentages of\nWhite/non-Hispanic White adolescent females who per-\nceive themselves as \"too fat\" trying to lose weight, com-\npared to Hispanic and Black/African American\nadolescents [16]. These data and associations are lim-\nited, however, as the only significant positive association\nbetween weight perception and trying to lose weight\nwas reported among a sample of adolescents in Beirut,\nLebanon [23]. However, again, the finding is limited due\nto its lack of generalizability.\nStudies present conflicting data on whether U.S. ado-\nless likely [15,25] than U.S. adolescent males to exercise\nas a means to control and/or lose weight. Nevertheless,\nstudy findings indicate exercise is the most common\nbehaviour among U.S. and international female adoles-\ncents trying to control or lose weight [22,28]. Research-\ners also report that African American [15,25] and\nHispanic [25] female adolescents in the United States\nare significantly less likely to exercise than their White\ncounterparts. Although no studies have considered the\nassociation between adolescents' weight perception and\nengaging in exercise to trying to lose weight, researchers\nreport a significant positive relationship between BMI\nand engaging in exercise to trying to lose weight among\nU.S. female adolescents [25].\nThus, based on findings reported in the literature,\nfemale adolescents are more likely than male adoles-\ncents to be trying to lose weight and are most likely to\nengage in exercise to do so. However, limited evidence\ndemonstrates associations between demographic vari-\nables, BMI, and weight perception among female adoles-\ncents trying to lose weight. Furthermore, previous\nstudies have not examined the association of the accu-\nracy of female adolescents' weight perception with their\nefforts to lose weight. To fill this gap in the literature,\nthe current study focused on identifying whether BMI\nand weight perception are associated with trying to lose\nweight and engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method\namong U.S. female adolescents. This study addressed\nthe following research questions: (a) Are BMI and\nweight perception associated with trying to lose weight\namong female adolescents, controlling for age, race/eth-\nnicity, and SES?; and (b) Are BMI, weight perception,\nand trying to lose weight associated with female adoles-\ncents' report of engaging in exercise as a weight-loss\nmethod, controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and SES?\nMethods\nDesign\nThe current study was a nonexperimental, descriptive,\ncomparatory secondary analysis of data from the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [30].\nn.d.a). Add Health was a longitudinal, school-based\nstudy that collected data on a variety of health-related\nbehaviours in a nationally representative sample of U.S.\nadolescents in grades 7 through 12. Using a multistage,\nstratified, school-based cluster sampling design, Add\nHealth subjects were first enrolled during the adminis-\ntration of an in-school questionnaire in 1994 (Wave I,\nStage 1). One year later, additional subjects from school\nrosters were enrolled during in-home interviews (Wave\nquently followed over time during in-home interviews 2\nSample for the Present Study\nThe present study included females aged 13 to 18 years\nold on whom data were collected during in-home inter-\nviews at Wave I and Wave II of the Add Health study.\nFemale subjects were excluded if they (a) were not\nincluded in the core sample; (b) were younger than\n13 years or older than 18 years at Wave II; (c) were\nmissing data for age, race/ethnicity, or SES; (d) reported\npregnancy at Wave II; and (e) were determined to be\nphysically disabled during data collected at Wave II. The\nAdd Health public-use data set provides data for more\nthan 2,000 female adolescents at Wave II who met\ninclusion criteria. Due to the large sample available for\nthe present study, a power analysis was deemed unne-\ncessary upon statistical consultation.\nData Collection\nData for the present study were obtained from data col-\nlected from the Add Health study. From April to\nAugust 1996, highly structured in-home interviews were\nconducted by trained interviewers using computer-\nassisted self-interview for Add Health Wave II data col-\nlection [31]. All measures were self-reported, except for\nheight and weight, which were measured by the trained\ninterviewers immediately following the interview.\nDemographic data for the current study were obtained\nfrom the Add Health Wave I in-home interviews (Stage\n2), which followed the same data-collection procedures\nas described for Wave II. Although further information\nis available from the Add Health Web site http://www.\ncpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth, Add Health-sponsored\npublications lack information regarding the validity and\nreliability of the study's in-home interviews. In addition,\nrecommended techniques were not available in the cur-\nrent secondary analysis study [32].\nMeasures\nDemographic Variables\nEach subject's age was calculated by subtracting the sub-\nject's date of birth from the date of data collection\nrecorded on the laptop computer used for data collec-\ntion. Subjects ethnicity was identified as Hispanic or\nLatino or not Hispanic or Latino. Subjects also self-iden-\ntified themselves into one of the following race cate-\ngories: White, Black or African American, American\nIndian or Native American, or Asian or Pacific Islander.\nFor the current study, subjects' socioeconomic status\nwas operationalized to include two separate measures.\nResearch on health-disparities lacks accepted measures\nof socioeconomic status [33-35]. Although single and\ncomposite measures exist, evidence suggests that occu-\npation may not be a useful indicator of adolescents' SES\nand that educational attainment, which is not inter-\nchangeable with family income, is the most widely used\nindicator of adolescents' SES [33,35]. Therefore, in the\ncurrent study, the two operationalized measures for SES\nwere highest maternal educational attainment and family\nincome [1994 household total income (in thousands of\ndollars) before-tax and household income received in\n1994 (including income from all household members,\ndividends, welfare benefits, and other sources)].\nBody-Mass Index\nThe measure used for actual weight, BMI, was calcu-\nlated as weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in\nmeters) [kg/m2]. Although standardized classification\nsystems of overweight and obesity for adolescents do\nnot exist, classifying adolescents' weight based on age-\nand gender-specific BMI cut-off points is accepted\nworldwide [36]. In the present study, classifications from\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nwere used to identify female adolescents' BMI for age\nand gender as obese (> 95th percentile), overweight (85th\nto 95th percentile), or normal weight (< 85th percentile).\nDichotomous variables were created to identify subjects\nas obese or overweight.\nWeight Perception\nAs an important perceptual dimension of body image,\nweight perception is defined as the perception of one's\nbody weight [37]. In the Add Health Wave II in-home\ninterviews, subjects' weight perception was assessed by\nthe question, \"How do you think of yourself in terms of\nweight?\" Response choices included \"very underweight,\"\n\"slightly underweight,\" \"about the right weight,\" \"slightly\noverweight,\" or \"very overweight.\" The responses of\n\"very underweight,\" \"slightly underweight,\" and \"about\nthe right weight\" were collapsed into a single \"not over-\nweight\" response of weight perception.\nAccuracy of Weight Perception\nTo measure the accuracy of subjects' weight perception,\neach subject's BMI and weight perception were com-\npared. From this comparison, four variables were cre-\nated. The first variable (reference category) indicated\nsubjects who were not overweight or obese and per-\nceived themselves in any of the weight perception cate-\ngories (very underweight, slightly underweight, about\nthe right weight, slightly overweight, or very over-\nweight). The second variable indicated overweight or\nobese subjects who underestimated their weight. Despite\nbeing overweight or obese, these subjects did not per-\nceive themselves as overweight (weight perception was\nvery underweight, slightly underweight, or about the\nright weight (Overweight or Obese, Not Overweight\nweight perception). The third and fourth variables indi-\ncated subjects with a degree of accuracy in their weight\nperception. These subjects were overweight or obese\nand perceived themselves as either slightly overweight\n(Overweight or Obese, Slightly Overweight weight percep-\ntion) or very overweight (Overweight or Obese, Very\nOverweight weight perception) (Table 1). Due to the\nsmall number of female subjects who were obese and\nperceived themselves very overweight (n = 88), it was\nnot possible to construct a separate weight perception\naccuracy variable for subjects whose BMI percentile\nindicated they were obese.\nTrying to Lose Weight\nTo determine whether subjects were currently trying to\nlose weight, responses to the question, \"Are you trying\nto lose weight, gain weight, or stay the same weight?\"\nwere examined. To create a variable that identified sub-\njects who were currently trying to lose weight, the\nresponses \"gain weight\" and \"stay the same weight\" were\ncollapsed together into \"not trying to lose weight.\"\nEngaging in Exercise as a Weight-Loss Method\nAn aim of this study was to determine whether BMI and\nweight perception are associated with trying to lose\nTable 1 Classification of Weight Perception Accuracy\nWeight Perception\nBMI\nClassification\nNot\nOverweight\nSlightly\noverweight\nVery\noverweight\nOverweight or\nObese\nInaccurate\nUnderestimation\nAccurate\nEstimation\nAccurate\nEstimation\nweight and reports of engaging in exercise as a weight-\nloss method among U.S. female adolescents. Upon\ndetermining subjects were trying to lose weight, they\nwere identified as engaging in exercise to try to lose\nweight if they answered \"yes\" to the \"Exercise\" response\nto the question, \"During the past seven days, which of\nthe following did you do in order to lose weight or keep\nfrom gaining weight?\"\nData Analysis\nData were analyzed using STATA, a statistical software\npackage, to account for the Add Health study's cluster\nsampling with unequal probability design and using Add\nHealth sampling weights for cross-sectional analyses,\nwhich allowed for a nationally representative sample of\nU.S. female adolescents [38]. Results were considered\nstatistically significant if the p-value was less than of\n0.05. Initial analyses included descriptive statistics for\nsample characteristics and a summary statistics of vari-\nables. Chi square statistics determined relationships\nbetween dichotomous variables. After determining the\npresence of low to modest correlations between all inde-\neach model, survey-weighted logistic regression was per-\nformed to determine the effect of a dichotomous or\ncontinuous independent variable on the probability of a\ndichotomous dependent variable. Wald tests, when\nappropriate, were performed to determine the signifi-\ncance between the independent variable and dependent\nvariable [39]. For each of the current study's research\nquestions, three models were used to predict the depen-\ndent variable. The first model contained only demo-\ngraphic variables. The second model contained\ndemographic variables as well as BMI and weight per-\nception as independent variables. The third model con-\ntained demographic variables and variables indicating\nsubjects' weight perception accuracy as independent\nvariables.\nResults\nSample Description\nOf the 2,510 subjects in the Add Health public-use data\ncore sample, a total of 2,216 subjects were eligible for\nsecondary analysis in the current study, after applying\ninclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects were 13 to 18\nwhich depicts the sample's demographic variables, most\nsubjects were non-Hispanic (88%) and White (69%);\nhowever, other ethnic (Hispanic) and race categories\n(Black or African American, American Indian or Native\nAmerican, and Asian or Pacific Islander) were also\nrepresented in the sample. Although 85.1% of the sub-\njects' mothers reported having graduated from high\nschool or earned a General Equivalency Diploma, this\npercentage was slightly lower than the 1994 percentage\n(91.6%) of educational achievement rates for a high\nschool diploma or greater in the U.S. for females 24 to\n64 years old [40]. In addition, the subjects' median total\nhousehold income ($40,000) was slightly higher than\nWeight Related Variables\nBody-Mass Index\nThe majority of female adolescents in this study sample\nwere not overweight or obese (72.63%) (see Table 3).\nHowever, significant racial differences existed in the\nsample's weight status. Black/African American and\nAmerican Indian/Native American female adolescents\nhad the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity.\nChi-square statistics indicated Black/African American\nfemale adolescents were significantly more likely to be\noverweight or obese than female adolescents who were\nWhite, Asian/Pacific Islander, or in the race category of\n\"Other\" (p < 0.01). American Indian/Native American\nfemale adolescents were significantly more likely to be\noverweight or obese than White (p < 0.05) or Asian/\nPacific Islander (p < 0.01) female adolescents. Asian/\nTable 2 Descriptive Statistics for Demographic Variables\nVariable (n) n %\nNote. a in thousands of dollars\nPacific Islander female adolescents were the least likely\nto be overweight compared to female adolescents in all\nother racial categories (p < 0.01).\nWeight Perception\nIn the study's sample, most female adolescents perceived\nthemselves as not overweight (60.99%) (see Table 3).\nAmerican Indian/Native American female adolescents\nand female adolescents in the \"Other\" race category\nwere most likely to perceive themselves as overweight.\nChi-square statistics demonstrated that American\nIndian/Native American and \"Other\" female adolescents\nwere significantly more likely than Black/African Ameri-\ncan female adolescents to perceive themselves as\noverweight (p < 0.05). Subjects in the \"Other\" race\ncategory were also significantly more likely than their\nWhite counterparts to perceive themselves as over-\nAccuracy of Weight Perception\nIn addition to descriptive statistics, chi square statistics\ndemonstrated a significant difference in the accuracy of\nfemale adolescents' weight perception, based on their\nactual BMI weight classification. Of the female adoles-\ncents who were overweight or obese, 79.06% accurately\nperceived themselves as either slightly or very over-\nweight (p < 0.05). In addition, almost 20% of the over-\nweight or obese female adolescents inaccurately\nunderestimated their weight as not overweight (see\nSignificant racial differences also existed in the sub-\njects' accuracy of weight perception. Overweight or\nobese Black/African American female adolescents were\nmore likely to underestimate their weight than were\nfemale adolescents. In addition, overweight or obese\nAmerican Indian/Native American female adolescents\nwere significantly more likely than their Asian counter-\nparts to underestimate their weight (p < 0.05).\nTrying to Lose Weight\nApproximately half of the female adolescents in the\nsample were currently trying to lose weight, while the\nother half indicated they were not currently trying to\nlose weight (see Table 3). Across all models used in the\nstudy, age was significantly associated with trying to lose\nweight: With each increasing year in age, subjects were\np < 0.05) (see Table 5). In the third model (demographic\nvariables, plus variables indicating weight perception\naccuracy), race was significantly associated with trying\nto lose weight: Black/African American subjects were\n0.6 times less likely to be trying to lose weight than\ntheir White counterparts. A significant positive associa-\ntion with also emerged between BMI and weight per-\nception. Overweight and obese subjects were two to\nfour times more likely to be trying to lose weight than\nsubjects who were not overweight or obese. Also, sub-\njects who perceived themselves as slightly or very over-\nweight were 13 to 25 times more likely to be trying to\nlose weight than subjects who did not perceive them-\nselves as slightly or very overweight (see Table 5).\nWald statistics indicated that, compared to the over-\nweight subjects, the obese subjects were significantly\nmore likely to be trying to lose weight (F = 6.72, p <\n0.0006), with no difference between a weight perception\nof slightly overweight and very overweight (F = -0.96,\np 0.392). In addition, compared to the variable of BMI,\nthe variable of weight perception was significantly asso-\nciated with greater odds of trying to lose weight; Wald\nstatistics were significant (p < 0.05) for the difference\nbetween these two variables. All weight perception accu-\nracy variables were also positively associated with trying\nto lose weight. Overweight or obese subjects who accu-\nrately perceived their weight as either slightly or very\noverweight were significantly more likely to be trying to\nlose weight than overweight or obese subjects who inac-\ncurately underestimated their weight as not overweight\nsubjects who were overweight or obese and perceived\nthemselves as overweight were the most likely to be try-\ning to lose weight (OR = 22.62), no significant difference\nemerged between these subjects and those who were\noverweight or obese and perceived themselves as slightly\nEngaging in Exercise as a Weight-Loss Method\nAmong the subjects who were currently trying to lose\nweight (46.95%), the majority reported engaging in\nTable 3 Descriptive Statistics for Body Mass Index (BMI)\nPercentile, Weight Perception, Trying to Lose Weight,\nand Exercise as a Weight-Loss Method (N = 2216)\nVariables (n) n %\nExercise as a Weight-Loss Method if Trying to Lose\nexercise as a weight-loss method (76.54%) (see Table 3).\nHowever, BMI, weight perception, and weight percep-\ntion accuracy were not associated with the odds of enga-\nging in exercise as a weight-loss method. Across all of\nthe study's models, only the maternal educational attain-\nment category of completing a General Equivalency\nDiploma was significantly associated with the likeliness\nof engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method (see\nTable 6). However, interpretation of this significance\nmay be considered inappropriate because the General\nEquivalency Diploma category was one of multiple cate-\ngories for maternal educational attainment that con-\nsisted of a small proportion of subjects (4.75%).\nDiscussion\nBody-mass index, weight perception, and weight percep-\ntion accuracy were positively associated with trying to\nlose weight in the study's representative sample of U.S.\nTable 4 Cross Tabulations for Weight Perception Accuracya (N = 2163)\nWeight Perception\nBMI Percentile Not Overweight Slightly or Very Overweight\nn (%) n (%) n\nNot Overweight or Obese\nOverweight or Obese\nTable 5 Results of Survey-Weighted Logistic Regression for Trying to Lose Weight\nVariable\n(reference category)\nRace\nMother's Highest Level of Education\nActual Weight/BMI\nWeight Perception (WP)\nWP Accuracy\nNote. a OR = odds ratio; b CI = confidence interval. c p < 0.05.\nfemale adolescents, after controlling for selected covari-\nates. Overweight or obese female adolescents in the\nstudy were more likely to be trying to lose weight than\nthose who were not overweight or obese, a finding that\ninternational [20,23] adolescents. In addition, the obese\nfemale adolescents in the current study were signifi-\ncantly more likely to be trying to lose weight than those\nwho were overweight, another finding consistent with\nprevious research on international adolescents [22].\nBecause the likeliness of the obese female adolescents in\nthe present sample to be trying to lose weight was\ngreater (4.14 times more likely than other female adoles-\ncents) than the likeliness of their international counter-\nparts (1.95 times more likely) [22], it is plausible that\nobese U.S. female adolescents are more likely to be try-\ning to lose weight than obese female adolescents in\nother countries.\nResults from the current study also demonstrated that\nU.S. female adolescents who perceive themselves as\nslightly or very overweight are significantly more likely\nto be trying to lose weight than are those who do not\nperceive themselves as overweight, with no difference in\nthe likeliness of trying to lose weight between a weight\nperception of slightly overweight and very overweight.\nThis finding is comparable to a previous study of ado-\nlescents in Beirut [23] and addresses the lack of studies\nconsidering such an association in a sample of U.S.\nfemale adolescents.\nThe current study's finding that weight perception has\na stronger association than BMI with trying to lose\nweight may raise concerns, because the association\nbetween weight perception and trying to lose weight is\noften related to eating disorders. However, such con-\ncerns may be assuaged by the finding that overweight or\nobese female adolescents with an accurate weight per-\nception are more likely to be trying to lose weight than\nthose who inaccurately perceive their weight. Further-\nmore, the study's overweight or obese female adoles-\ncents who underestimated their weight (20%) were\nsignificantly less likely to be trying to lose weight than\nthose who accurately perceived their weight as either\nTable 6 Results of Survey-Weighted Logistic Regression for Engaging in Exercise as a Weight-Loss Methods\nRace\nMother's Education\nActual Weight/BMI\nWeight Perception (WP)\nWP Accuracy\nNote. a OR = odds ratio; b CI = confidence interval. c p < 0.05.\nslightly or very overweight. Further studies are needed\nto determine the consistency of these findings among\nboth U.S. and international female adolescents. In addi-\ntion, researchers and clinicians who design weight-loss\ninterventions for female adolescents are encouraged to\nconsider weight perception accuracy, not just BMI or\nweight perception.\nAdditional studies with longitudinal designs are also\nneeded to determine the validity of the association\nbetween age and efforts to lose weight among female\nadolescents. Results from the current study demon-\nstrated older female adolescents are more likely than\ntheir younger counterparts to be trying to lose weight, a\nfinding that is consistent with previous research [22,26].\nHowever, studies have also demonstrated negative [42]\nand nonsignificant [25] associations between adoles-\ncents' age and efforts to lose weight. Consistent findings\nfrom future research will allow clinicians to identify\nwhether weight-loss interventions should be aimed at\nolder, younger, or all female adolescents.\nWeight-loss interventions targeted towards or designed\nspecifically for Black/African American U.S. female ado-\nlescents may also be needed. Black/African American\nfemale adolescents in the study had a relatively high pre-\nvalence of overweight and obesity (38.19%) and a low\nprevalence of perceiving themselves as slightly or very\noverweight (36.94%). Also, compared to the other race\ncategories in this study sample, Black/African American\nfemale adolescents who were overweight or obese were\nthe most likely to inaccurately underestimate their weight\n(10.74%), and they were significantly less likely than their\nWhite counterparts to be trying to lose weight.\nThis study identified significant associations between\nBMI, weight perception, and weight perception accuracy\nwith trying to lose weight. In addition, a relatively large\nnumber of this study's sample reported engaging in exer-\ncise as a weight-loss method (n = 796). Thus it is surprising\nthat these variables were not associated with engaging in\nexercise as a weight-loss method. It is possible that female\nadolescents may engage in other healthy, unhealthy, or\nextreme weight-loss behaviours in addition to or in place\nof exercise. Including additional weight-loss behaviours in\nthis study's regression models may have strengthened the\nmodel, possibly allowing for significant associations. Thus,\nadditional healthy and unhealthy weight-loss behaviours\nare recommended in future research on the associations of\nBMI, weight perception, and weight perception accuracy\nwith engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method among\noverweight and obese female adolescents.\nLimitations\nUse of the Add Health data [30] in this secondary-analy-\nsis study limited the statistical analyses of data and the\ngeneralizability of the study's findings. The Add Health\nsample was selected from a school-based sample; thus,\nfindings are only generalizable to U.S. female adoles-\ncents enrolled in school. Furthermore, the underlying\nsurvey design of the Add Health study did not allow for\ninferences of cause and effect. Although a well-powered\nstudy sample with data from more than 2,000 subjects\nwas available for analysis, there was a relatively small\nnumber of subjects who were overweight or obese,\nwhich did not allow for separate analyses for overweight\nand obese subjects. The weight perception accuracy\nvariable, therefore, combined subjects who were over-\nweight with those who were obese, and statistical analy-\nsis was unable to consider differences in weight\nperception accuracy between overweight and obese sub-\njects. Also, the conceptualization of weight perception\naccuracy and the subjects' interpretation could have\naffected their responses, making it difficult to \"match\"\nthe BMI categories of overweight and obese with the\nweight perception categories of slightly overweight and\nvery overweight. In terms of validity and reliability,\nthere was a lack of reported measures, and recom-\nmended techniques were not available for this second-\nary-analysis study.\nConclusions\nBased on the findings of this secondary analysis of data\nfrom the Add Health study [30], BMI, weight percep-\ntion, and weight perception accuracy are significantly\npositively associated with the likeliness of trying to lose\nweight among U.S. female adolescents. However, BMI,\nweight perception, and weight perception accuracy are\nnot associated with the likeliness of engaging in exercise\nas a weight-loss method among U.S. female adolescents;\nnevertheless, this finding does not indicate that such\nassociations do not exist. Considering the strengths and\nlimitations of this study, results should be interpreted\nwith a degree of caution. Although this study's results\nsupport findings from previous research regarding ado-\nlescents' efforts to lose weight, the current investigation\nis the first known study to consider the association of\nweight perception accuracy with trying to lose weight\nand engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method\namong overweight or obese U.S. female adolescents. To\nhelp reduce the national and worldwide epidemic of\noverweight and obesity among female adolescents,\nweight perception accuracy, as well as age and race,\nmust be considered as significant factors associated with\nweight-loss efforts among female adolescents.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research uses data from Add Health, a program project directed by\nKathleen Mullan Harris and designed by J.
