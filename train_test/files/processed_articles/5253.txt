The\ntwo participant groups' CR strategies were found to be cross-culturally different and were found to be dependent on\nthe participants' respective cultural backgrounds. In addition, the data collected emphasize the fact that cross-cultural\ncommunication is a transactional mutual process and that both native and nonnative speakers of English are equally\nrequired to adjust their communicative behaviors to develop intercultural communication. The 30 American students and\n30 Tunisian students filled a Discourse Completion Test (DCT) with 8 contextualized situations and sat after that for a\nsemistructured interview. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed for analysis.\n",

While I was waiting for a\nfriend at a clothing store, a British woman stopped me and\nsaid, \"You look very beautiful in pink!\" This utterance might\nsound simple but, for me it was confusing and problematic.\nThe answer in my mind was, \"What does she want?\" But I\ndid not reply. She went on and added, \"I like the way you\ndress.\" What I thought about at that moment was that her\nutterance was an indirect question about the place from\nwhich I bought my clothes as it was very common in a\nTunisian context to say, \"I like your outfit; where did you get\nit from?\" However, for fear that this would not be the appro-\npriate response, I remained silent and perplexed. The woman\nthen left with a strange look on her face and kept turning\nbehind looking my way as she made her way outside. I felt\nso embarrassed and I remember even trying to avoid\nencounters and possible interactions with native speakers\n(NSs). The puzzling question, however, was, \"Why, in spite\nof my ability to utter grammatically correct sentences, was I\nunable to communicate effectively with a NS?\"\nWhen engaging in conversations with NSs syntactic accu-\nracy alone does not guarantee an effective communication\nfor a nonnative speaker (NNS). Trosborg (1995) claimed,\n\"No error of grammar can make a speaker seem so incompe-\ntent, so inappropriate, so foreign, as the kind of trouble a\nlearner gets into when he or she does not understand or oth-\nerwise disregards a language's rules of use.\" (p. 3). In fact,\nsuch errors are often evaluated as signs of impoliteness on\nthe part of second or foreign language users involved\n(Barron, 2003). Even advanced learners can face difficulties\nwhen attempting to interpret NSs' intentions. Indeed, NNSs,\nwho may understand only the literal meaning of words, can\nexperience cross-cultural pragmatic failure.\nPragmatic failure is defined as, \"the inability to under-\nstand what is meant by what is said\" (Thomas, 1983). To put\nit differently, pragmatic failure is the inability to interpret\nutterances the way the speaker intends them. In fact, prag-\nmatic failure can generate frustration, misunderstandings,\nand cross-cultural communication breakdowns (Wolfson,\n1989). This article is based on acknowledging that people\nfrom different cultural backgrounds may behave differently\nand that perceptual differences can make communication\nbetween members of different cultures challenging (Wolfson,\n1981). The compliment response (CR) speech act is selected\ngiven the fact that compliments may occur at almost any\npoint within a speech event (Wolfson & Manes, 1980).

First, it examines the CR strategies used by speakers\nof American English (AE) and Tunisian learners of English.\nSecond, it explores the reasons behind the way the two\nparticipant groups respond to compliments. Following\nthe examination of these two goals, the researcher hopes to\npropose ways to facilitate communication between the two\ngroups based on the assumption that communication is\ntransactional and that it is not the responsibility of one party\nto be aware of cross-cultural differences and to make adjust-\nments to successfully communicate with the other.\nPragmatics Across cultures\nThis research is grounded in three main fields, namely,\ncontrastive pragmatics, cross-cultural pragmatics (CCP),\nand interlanguage pragmatics (ILP). Contrastive pragmat-\nics' major principle is to make a particular language the\nobject of study and then compare its linguistic realizations\nto other languages (Riley, 1981). It investigates how com-\nmunicative functions are realized in different languages.\nWierzbicka (1991), however, suggested that people from\ndifferent cultures speak differently not because they have\ndifferent linguistic codes, but because these linguistic codes\nare used differently. In other words, people from different\ncultures speak differently because of the influence of some\ncultural norms that are reflected in speech acts. The field\nCCP, thus, has developed out of the field contrastive prag-\nmatics. The ideas of the field of CCP can be summarized as\nfollows: People in different countries speak differently and\ntheir different ways of speaking can be accounted for in\nterms of independently different cultural norms. To put it\ndifferently, the way people from different cultures produce\nand perceive speech acts is determined by the underlying\ncultural norms and values. Investigations of pragmatics\nacross cultures have led to the question of how language\nlearners identify, perceive, and produce a particular speech\nact in a second or foreign language, hence, the field ILP.\nILP is defined as \"the investigation of NNSs' comprehen-\nsion and production of speech acts, and the acquisition\nof L2-related speech act knowledge\" (Kasper & Dahl, 1991,\np. 215). It focuses on how learners realize speech acts and\ndemonstrates that even advanced learners can fail to convey\nor comprehend intended meanings (Thomas, 1983).\nUniversalityVersus Culture Specificity\nThe conceptualization and production of speech acts is not\nidentical across cultures and languages and the strategies\nused to perform a particular speech act are not governed by\ndetermined universal principles. Austin (1962), Searle\nconceptualization and realization of a specific linguistic\nbehavior was identical across cultures and languages and\nthat the strategies used to perform a particular speech act\nwere governed by determined universal principles. Fraser,\nRintell, and Walters (1980) expressed the view that \"Every\nlanguage makes available the same set of strategies--\nsemantic formulas--for performing a given speech act\"\n(p. 79) suggesting that people in different cultures used the\nsame strategies in performing speech acts. In other words,\nculture may not have an impact on the way speech acts are\nperformed. A similar belief is displayed by Clark and Shunk\n(1980) on the production of the speech act requesting \"when\npeople make requests, they tend to make them indirectly.\nThey generally avoid imperatives like tell me the time\"\nAlthough the studies mentioned above were conducted\nonly on English speakers' performance of speech acts, the\nfindings were, for ill or for good, extrapolated to all cultures\nand languages. Clark and Shunk's use of the adverb \"gener-\nally\" implies that because English people do not use the\nimperatives in their requests, people in the entire world are\nexpected to do the same. Indeed, the universalistic stance pro-\njected by authors like the ones mentioned above was rejected\nby Wierzbicka (1985) who contended that the universality of\nspeech acts was a mere illusion and that researchers who\nthought that speech acts were governed by universal mecha-\nnisms seemed to \"take it for granted that what seems to hold\nfor the speakers of English must hold for people generally\" (p.\nbetween Australian English and Polish in the production of\ndifferent speech acts. She gave the example of a Polish woman\nwho greeted an English visitor using the imperative \"Mrs.\nVennisa! Please! Sit! Sit!\" (p. 147).\nWierzbicka (1985) then noted that the use of the impera-\ntive made the utterance, when heard by a NS of English,\nsound like a command to a dog because English people\nwould avoid the use of the imperative and substitute it with\ninterrogative forms like \"will you sit down?\" (p. 147). The\nconceptualization and production of speech acts are, there-\nfore, not universal but determined by the specific cultural\nnorms embedded in each society. When studies compare the\nperformance of speech acts of two different cultures, strate-\ngies used to perform a certain speech act seem to differ.\nAccordingly, the present study on the CRs of speakers of AE\nand Tunisian learners of English is a culture-specific study\nas it compares the speech act CRs in two different cultures.\nA CR is a \"verbal "
