In common\nwith other research funders around the world, we believe\nthat many of the increasingly rich and complex datasets that\nare generated by the research we support have to date been\nlargely untapped resources of considerable value. Through\nmaking these data more widely accessible and useable to\nother researchers, they can be used to advance avenues of\nresearch that were never envisaged by the original data gen-\nerator, as well as to verify published research findings.\nIn this light, many funders have introduced explicit poli-\ncies on data management and sharing that require the\nresearchers we support to maximize access to datasets in a\ntimely and appropriate manner and with as few restrictions\nas possible (Wykstra, 2013). In implementing their policies,\nfunders are aware that there are significant challenges to\novercome. Different research disciplines are at very differ-\nent stages in terms of developing the infrastructures,\nresources, and skillsets needed to manage and share data.\nSome sections of the research community have been much\nquicker to embed data sharing practices than others, and\nacross the research enterprise, incentive structures do not\nyet recognize adequately the cost and effort required to gen-\nerate and make available high quality data resources.\nFurthermore, for many areas of biomedical research that\ninvolve the collection of data from patients and populations,\nlimits on data sharing are required to safeguard the privacy\nof research participants.\nPublic health and epidemiology research has been high-\nlighted as an area in which tremendous benefits could be\ngained from data sharing, but where the community has\nbeen relatively slow to embrace it and where key enabling\ninfrastructures are not yet in place (Pisani & AbouZahr,\n2010). This is in part the result of some justifiable barriers\nand concerns (van Panhuis et\nresearchers who invest significant time and effort in com-\npiling large-scale long-term datasets from cohorts and pop-\nulations are understandably reluctant to share these data\nbefore they have had sufficient time to conduct and publish\ntheir own analyses. This concern is amplified for research-\ners in resource-poor settings, where fears are particularly\nacute that the benefits will be lost to better resourced groups\nwith enhanced capacity for data analysis. There may also be\nparticular ethical risks to individuals and populations in\nthese settings who may be at heightened risk of stigmatiza-\ntion or harm if their privacy is compromised.\n1The Wellcome Trust, London, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nDavid Carr, The Wellcome Trust, 215 Euston Road, London NW1 2BE,\nEmail: d.carr@wellcome.ac.uk\nSharing Research Data to\nImprove Public Health:\nA Funder Perspective\nDavid Carr1 and Katherine Littler1\n Keywords\nbiomedical research ethics, data sharing, data release, research data, research governance, low income countries, clinical\nresearch, health policy\nWhile recognizing the need to address these concerns,\nwe would argue that there is an \"ethical imperative\" to sup-\nport data sharing to ensure that datasets collected at consid-\nerable expense using public and charitable research funds\nare used in a manner that achieves the greatest possible ben-\nefit to health and society. Following a lengthy period of dis-\ncussion and debate, a group of 17 global health research\nfunders from across the world came together in 2011 to\npublish a joint statement of purpose on sharing research\ndata to improve public health (Walport & Brest, 2011). The\nstatement articulated a shared vision to increase the avail-\nability of health research data in ways that are equitable,\nethical, and efficient and will accelerate improvements in\npublic health.\nTo advance this vision, the partner funders established\nthe Public Health Research Data Forum (www.wellcome.\nac.uk/PHRDF) as a mechanism to help coordinate funder\nactivities and develop joint activities to further the goals of\nthe joint statement. Over the last 3 years, the Forum has\ncommissioned several major projects to investigate key\nissues and challenges associated with increasing the avail-\nability and use of health research data--publishing reports\non data citation (Rans, Day, Duke, & Ball, 2013), enhanc-\ning data discoverability (Public Health Research Data\nForum, 2014), and enabling data linkage (Public Health\nForum partners have been aware from the outset that it\nwill be vital to build and maintain the trust and support of\nall the stakeholders involved in the research process. These\ninclude researchers who generate and wish to use data,\nresearch institutions, local ethical review bodies, and criti-\ncally, the research participants and populations who are\nmaking their data available for research. We are also very\nmindful that the policy and governance frameworks that are\nrequired to achieve this may be highly context-dependent--\nrecognizing that the way our policy requirements are imple-\nmented in practice needs to be adapted in line with the\nvarying values and cultural norms that exist in different set-\ntings across the world.\nFrom an early stage in the Forum's existence, it became\nclear that while we had some evidence on the views of\nstakeholders in high-income settings on the use of personal\ndata in research, next to nothing was known about the per-\nspectives and expectations of research participants and\nstakeholders in low- and middle-income country (LMIC)\nsettings. On behalf of the Forum partners, the Wellcome\nTrust commissioned the research reported in this special\nedition to target this critical evidence gap--linking the\nexpertise of the Ethox team at the University of Oxford with\nresearch studies in Kenya, India, South Africa, Thailand,\nand Vietnam. A key objective of the project from the outset\nwas to produce a toolkit that would enable the methodolo-\ngies and resources developed through the project to be\napplied and built upon in other settings.\nThe findings reported in the articles published here cast\nvaluable new light on the views of LMIC stakeholders on\nthe opportunities and challenges associated with data shar-\ning, revealing not only some common themes between the\nfive study sites but also some important differences. To mark\nthe culmination of the project, the Forum partners held a\nworkshop in Cape Town, South Africa on March 29 to 31,\n2015, to discuss the preliminary findings of this work with\nkey African research stakeholders, and consider the key\nopportunities and challenges for advancing data sharing in\nan African context.\nDiscussions in Cape Town emphasized the need for data\nsharing to be underpinned by fair and equitable terms,\nwhich ensure benefits are delivered to local communities\nand that local capacity to analyze and use data is enhanced.\nThere is a strong preference from LMIC researchers for\ndata to be shared (at least in the first instance) in a context\nof established and trusted collaborations and networks:\nConcerns are amplified significantly when stakeholders are\nasked to consider sharing data to users with whom these\nlinks do not exist.\nSecond, protecting the privacy and confidentiality of\nresearch participants is clearly of paramount concern. A key\nchallenge in establishing effective governance frameworks\nis balancing the need to ensure that data can be shared for\nbeneficial purposes with the need to create proportionate\nsafeguards to guard against these risks. A related challenge\nis the need to understand and develop the governance mech-\nanisms that are necessary to underpin and legitimize broad\nconsent models that allow for data to be used for beneficial\nresearch purposes that may currently be unforeseen.\nFinally, there was a clear consensus that the importance\nof building trust and trustworthiness in frameworks estab-\nlished to enable data sharing cannot be over-emphasized.\nThere is a need to actively engage key stakeholders in an\nongoing dialogue around the benefits and risks, and to\nestablish transparent and accountable data governance\nprocesses.\nThe outcomes of this project will play a major role in\nhelping to shape the future priorities of the Public Health\nResearch Data Forum. Moving forward, it is likely that the\nfocus of the Forum will transition from commissioning\nresearch toward the development of resources, training\nmaterials, and technical support for researchers and institu-\ntions that aid them in establishing the infrastructures and\npolicy frameworks needed to enable data sharing in differ-\nent settings. The toolkit created through this research is the\nfirst major resource of this type.\nWe hope that this research will also make a broader\ncontribution to discussions on the interplay of funder\npolicies with appropriate local and national polices, and\nspecifically how implementation of funder policies can\nbe adapted locally to take account of contextual differ-\nences. It is also absolutely clear that the issues around\n316 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 10(3)\ndata sharing are inextricably linked with broader issues\nin global health research--such as capacity building and\nbenefit sharing--and a holistic perspective is required.\nBuilding on the discussions at Cape Town, the Forum\npartners are committed to facilitating an inclusive and\nwide ranging discussion on these issues--with the ulti-\nmate goal of ensuring that the benefits of data sharing are\nrealized at both a global and a local level.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest\nwith respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle: David Carr and Katherine Littler are employees of the\nWellcome Trust.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nPisani, E., & AbouZahr, C.
