In social science, economic expansion and\npopulation growth are often utilized as predictive variables\ndriving energy use patterns. This article asks whether the\ninverse of energy consumption (energy depletion) is associ-\nated with threatening disruptions to social order.\nThe focus on energy withdrawal reflects long-standing\ncriminological concerns regarding inequality and commu-\nnity decay. Although energy use has been overlooked as a\npredictive variable in macro-level criminology, recent\nresearch (primarily in the fields of economics and geophys-\nics) suggests that there is substantial inequality across spatial\nunits in access to (and utilization of) affordable energy\nresources (Buzar, 2007; Rosas-Flores, G\u00e1lvez, & Zayas,\ncriminology places on inequality in predicting aggregate pat-\nterns of criminal activity, it is surprising that criminologists\nhave not yet evaluated such a relationship.\nWork in the field of environmental sociology and geo-\nphysics both underscore the robust association between\nenergy supplies and social life and suggest energy use should\nbe closely correlated with quality of life indicators.1\nGeophysicists who focus on energy depletion have already\nsuggested economic degeneration associated with energy\nshortages may present challenges to socioeconomic func-\ntioning and social order (Friedrichs, 2010; Hirsch, Bezdek,\nIf energy use relates to human quality of life (Meadows,\nMeadows, & Randers, 1992), consideration should be given\nto potential effects of a withdrawal of affordable energy on\nvarious quality of life indicators, including aggregate-level\ncrime rates.

If energy depletion scenarios become reality, several\nnew challenges for national and local criminal justice agen-\ncies tasked with providing formal social control can be\nexpected. This is true especially in geographic areas that\nexperience the negative aspects of general inequalities and\nalready manifest heightened rates of violent crime. The lit-\nerature on violence and inequality is extensive and provides\ngrist for thinking about links between natural resource dis-\nparities and social control.\nLiterature Review\nThere are two areas of literature taken into consideration in\nwhat follows. One aspect of review draws attention to arti-\ncles in peer-review journals and agency technical reports that\nfocus on energy consumption and depletion effects. The\nimplications of this area of literature suggest that energy use\nand quality of life indicators are likely empirically knotted\nGriethuysen, 2010). If access to affordable energy resources\nbecomes problematic, one plausible hypothesis is that qual-\nity-of-life for people in the most energy dependent areas will\nsuffer.\nThe second body of work considered is fused from two\ndistinct areas of sociology: environmental sociology (that\naddresses energy use) and criminology (that addresses\ndiverse structural determinants of aggregate-level crime\nrates). Research from environmental sociology suggests\nenergy use is associated with varying economic conditions\n(Clement & Schultz, 2011; Costanza, Farber, & Maxwell,\nfocused intensively on documenting empirical links between\nconditions of inequality and diverse indicators of crime\nSampson & Wilson, 1995). Research efforts in these two\nrespective fields have rarely informed one another. This\narticle seeks to place them in near enough proximity to\nbegin the process of empirically evaluating the merits of this\nhypothesized link.\nLiterature on Oil Depletion\nThe first researcher to posit that the world's petroleum sup-\nply was a finite resource was Hubbert (1956) who estimated\na mathematical model predicting a 1970 peak in continental\nU.S. oil production. Although many of his contemporaries\nignored Hubbert's research, when conventional oil did peak\nin 1972 (see Figure 1), economists and geologists revisited\nhis research, and subsequently expanded and refined the\nmodel. H\u00f6\u00f6k et al. (2009) recently developed updated esti-\nmates for world oil production and their results point to a\ndisquieting depletion scenario (also see Campbell, 2002).\nA major concern in energy literature today regards energy\ninputs required to facilitate stable expansion of the economy\n(Howland, Murrow, Petraglia, & Comings, 2009; Korowicz,\n1992). A growing body of research articulates a straightfor-\nward insight that energy is essential to practical life in a very\nconcrete way, affecting the production of pharmaceuticals,\navailability of transportation, development of all phases of\nagricultural production, transportation, storage, and prepara-\ntion, as well as virtually all aspects and phases of industrial\nproduction, the production of media, and delivery of\neducation.\nAccording to Korowicz (2010), a single barrel of crude oil\ncontains the equivalent in energy of a person working 40\nhours a week 52 weeks a year for 12 years. The world\nFigure 1. Annual U.S. crude oil field production.\nHelms and Costanza 3\nconsumes approximately 85 million barrels of oil each day,\nother energy sources notwithstanding. Drawing on standard\nphysics, energy use represents the ability to get work done.\nThe loss of even a small amount of this premium source of\nenergy would present substantial challenges, likely resulting\nin a severe reduction in society's capacity for completing\ncritical work. Any such energy withdrawal would appear to\nnecessitate a shrinking of productive capacity.2\nHeinberg (2005) emphasizes that extraction shortages in\nthe U.S. have been offset by an increased reliance on\nimported oil and, to a lesser extent, conversion of some areas\nto nuclear power. The most recent journalistic reports, avail-\nable on the Internet, of the evolving nuclear disaster at\nFukishima highlights the complexity and substantial risks\nassociated with relying on nuclear technology to power the\nglobal economy of the future. Absent an obvious replace-\nment for the foundational energy platform of oil, energy sup-\nply deficits are likely to undermine social stability and\nimpose new requirements on social control agencies3\nDeffeyes (2008) explains that geophysicists and econo-\nmists have worked over the past 30 years to develop a defen-\nsible model for estimating the rate of oil and natural gas\n(2005) authored a highly regarded report strongly supporting\nthe modeling efforts of peak oil theorists, which, in sum, has\nsought to document using a variety of methodological\napproaches decline rates by well, field, region, and the world\ncal reports and publicly available research papers from Saudi\nenergy experts to develop his thesis that the Saudi oil fields,\nwhich represent approximately 20% of the total proven\nreserves worldwide, were on the cusp of experiencing an\nirreversible decline.\nLiterature on Sustainability and Natural\nResource Extraction\nHeinberg (2005) emphasizes that the critical determination\nrelating to sustainable production of energy resources\ninvolves what is referred to as energy return on energy\ninvested (EROEI). If it takes more energy than is contained\nin a barrel of oil to explore and discover, extract, process,\nrefine, store, and transport that barrel of oil to market, then\nthat barrel will not be extracted. He argues that this relation-\nship between the energy return on energy investments affects\nproduction processes at the level of individual wells, fields,\nproducing countries, regions, and for the world collectively.\nConcurrent literature (King & Fritsch, 2008) suggests that\npricing for oil products influences the rate of investment to\ndiscover new sources of oil, but new discoveries have\nremained flat for many years while physical depletion of\nexisting resources has expanded annually. Greenham (2012),\ndrawing from an investment model of causation, asserts that\nslowing the decline in the availability of oil will require a\ndoubling of the price of oil in the next decade. Greenham\nrefers to the phenomenon of \"economic peak oil,\" which he\ndefines as \"the point at which the cost of incremental supply\nexceeds the price economies can pay without significantly\ndisrupting economic activity at a given point in time.\" He\ncontinues, saying that \"Beyond this `pain barrier,' the level\nof oil prices will have a dramatic effect on a nation's people\nand its economy, threatening stagnation and hardship.\" We\nconcur with this conceptualization, noting that geological\nphysicists with their emphasis on underground forces, energy\nresearchers with their focus on EROEI, and those emphasiz-\ning economic peak oil all point to a similarly distressing\nfuture characterized by a diminishing supply of easily acces-\nsible and affordable liquid fuels based energy, the driving\nforce in any modern economy.\nWorldwide estimates for liquid fuels show a peak in avail-\nhas been increasing at a spectacular pace.4 All of the previ-\nously cited energy researchers seem to concur that the 21st\ncentury will herald the opening of a gap between expanding\nworld demand for new energy and a moderately declining\navailable supply. A variety of monographs and peer reviewed\narticles in the field of geophysics point to anticipated diffi-\nculties for population groups and their respective govern-\nLimitations in Environmental Sociology\nEnvironmental sociologists have noted the link between\nenergy consumption patterns and global inequalities\n(Clement, 2010) drawing attention to ecological dimensions\nof inequality. The following quote from a recent article sums\nup the way that sociologists have viewed energy consump-\ntion: \"The point needs to be made that urbanization drives\nenergy use not just because it amplifies economic activity\nbut also because human activity, in general, is heightened in\nagree, but note that the social science literature never directly\nempirically evaluates conceptual links between energy\nresources and shifting requirements for effective social\ncontrol.\nIn sociological literature, energy use is usually explained\nas a function of population growth (Meadows et al., 1992),\neconomic growth (Paul & Bhattacharya, 2004) and often as a\nlogical cause of environmental pollutants (Alam, Bala, Huq,\n& Matin, 1991). Environmental sociology squarely focuses\non economic growth relative to energy usage (Cheng, 1995;\nChontanawat, Hunt, & Pierse, 2008; Hondroyiannis, Lolos,\nenvironmental sociology are the ancillary concerns of crimi-\nnology; the functioning of communities and the conse-\nquences of a negative rate of growth. There is some\nconsideration to the issue of global inequality relative to\n4 SAGE Open\neven in this research, there is little evident consideration of\nquality of life effects associated with anticipated energy\nwithdrawals.\nThe upshot of environmental sociology is that it empha-\nsizes diverse ecological resource disparities and their conse-\nquences for social functioning. Bunker (1985), for example,\nargues that third world countries struggle with comparatively\nmassive drains in resources and energy when attempting to\ncompete with industrial core nations on the export market.\nAs noted previously, for most energy researchers, energy use\ndrives urbanization because it augments economic activity\n(Lee & Chang, 2008). Energy consumption has been asserted\nas a predictive variable of air pollution and economic GDP\n(Lutzenhiser, 1993) but the lines between inequality in the\nconsumption of energy and area crime have not previously\nbeen conceptualized and studied empirically. We address this\ngap in the literature with an analysis of the effects of energy\nconsumption patterns on instrumental crime in the United\nStates.\nCrime and Inequality Literature\nInfinite growth cannot continue unabated in a finite world\nand when conditions supporting such expansion hit their\npeak and thereafter become less available at affordable\nprices, there will undoubtedly be environmental and crimi-\nnological consequences that follow. Standard macro-level\ncriminological literature has provided myriad predictive\nvariables in the attempt to account for variation in rates of\ncrime. Much of the aggregate crime research emphasizes\nconcepts such as poverty, cultural capital, and various dimen-\nsions of social inequality. Despite this focus, inequality of\naccess to affordable energy has never been studied directly as\na predictor of aggregate crime. This is surprising, as energy\nuse patterns have been linked so closely to economic growth\nand quality of life in environmental sociological research.\nWe note, parenthetically, that the introduction of new vari-\nables into criminology has been rare over the last 40 years.\nTaking as a point of departure insights from the inequal-\nity-crime research, this article evaluates a hypothesized\ninverse association between aggregate energy use and vio-\nlence rates. The potential effects of structured inequality on\naggregate crime rates has been tenaciously debated\nSampson, Morenoff, & Raudenbush, 2005). Aggregate\nincome inequality (Hipp, 2007; Hooghe,Vanhoutte, Hardyns,\nPalme, & Schnabel, 2012), among other predictors have all\nbeen conceptualized and operationalized as sources of crime\nvariation. Structural research has also focused on race, eco-\nnomic inequality, and other social disadvantage indicators\nbut the empirical results have often been characterized by\nmixed or contradictory findings (McCall, Land, & Parker,\nfinding is in the race-crime area of research, with most stud-\nies reporting a positive race effect (Kovandzic, Vieraitis, &\nEconomic inequality has been the focus of violence\nresearch (J. R. Blau & Blau, 1982; Jacobs & Richardson,\nMessner & Tardiff, 1985). Poverty is also seen as an impor-\nhas been theorized as a key source of \"economic-induced\nto patterned violence, but the evidence, as in other areas of\ncrime research, has been inconsistent. Kapuscinski,\nBraithwaite, and Chapman (1998) report that unemployment\nis not associated with homicide rates. Cantor and Land\n(1985) report mixed results, whereas Parker and McCall\nployment effects on violence rates. City size has also been\nstatistically held constant in most instrumental violence\nWilliams, 1984) with similarly mixed results.\nSocial Disorganization and Theoretical\nLinks\nA review of social disorganization literature provides foun-\ndation for many of the theoretical links that are advanced in\nthis article. Prior studies have documented a link between\nenergy use and the economy; we suspect that energy con-\nsumption is an important correlate with social cohesiveness\nand collective efficacy in neighborhoods. In communities\nthat have experienced decay, economic deprivation is often\nthought to significantly influence variation in violence pat-\nterns and social control responses (Costanza & Helms, 2012;\nneighborhoods are often substantially disenfranchised, hav-\ning limited control over the actions of neighborhood resi-\ndents and limited ability to influence the decisions of\npoliticians and actions of police (Kaylen & Pridemore,\n2013). Poverty, family disruption, restricted labor markets,\nsocial and economic marginalization, and political disenfran-\nchisement have all been linked to violence rates in urban\njurisdictions in the United States (Jacobs & Richardson,\nSocial disorganization studies do not characterize the\ndiverse array of deprivations as having a natural and immu-\ntable source, but rather these are seen as politically and\nsocially determined. In the following sections, we seek to\ndevelop a research approach that emphasizes this critical\nenergy-crime connection. We do not ignore previous research\nconcerns, but rather, we seek to develop a more complete\nHelms and Costanza 5\naccount by conceptualizing and then assessing correlational\nevidence regarding energy inequality effects on patterns of\ninstrumental crime in U.S. counties.\nTheory and Hypotheses\nAcross communities, patterns of energy consumption vary\nsubstantially. Structural inequality studies (with their focus\non skewing of advantages and concentration of community-\nlevel violence) are suggestive for the purposes of research\ndeveloped here. We propose that the skewed ability to con-\nsume energy represents a facet of social inequality. We\nhypothesize criminal consequences associated with this dis-\nparate consumption of energy resources.\nThe research presented below advances a social ecologi-\ncal explanation of crime to explain variance in street robbery\nrates across counties. Concepts addressed in this article\nextend beyond traditionally used indicators of disorganiza-\ntion, as we seek to address the broader issue of energy con-\nsumption and how it relates to crime. When discussing\nenergy consumption, we address the fundamental link\nbetween areas and resources and note that certain geographic\nregions are energy rich while others are energy poor\n(Jorgenson et al., 2010). We focus first on the energy-com-\nmunity violence hypothesis and then proceed with other\nwidely utilized controls from the extant literature on com-\nmunities and crime.\nEnergy Consumption and Instrumental Violence\nGeological physicists have for many years provided monthly\nupdates to the world energy picture, based on rigorous mod-\neling efforts. The ASPO (Association for the Study of Peak\nOil & Gas\u00adIrish Chapter, n.d.), in an extensive collection of\n100 published newsletters, has demonstrated that oil and\nrelated liquid fuels are becoming increasingly scarce and\nmore difficult to process at a reasonable investment cost.\nAdvanced industrial societies can anticipate reductions in\nliving standards resulting from the peak energy scarcity situ-\nSuch reasoning finds anecdotal corroboration with the\njournalistic linkage between sudden resource shortfalls and\nviolence, and draws from observations surrounding natural\ndisasters (Van Heerden & Bryan, 2006). Research docu-\nments how populations respond to abrupt and protracted dis-\nruptions in flows of energy and other related critical resources\nthesis implies an evolving structural set of problems with\nsubstantial social control implications, a set of problems that\namount to what one author has referred to as a \"long emer-\nAny substantial disruption to a stable supply of energy\n(regardless of the source of that disruption) would be a\ndeeply influential determinant in the overall crime patterns\nof any American community. Critical to this notion is the\nunderstanding that this model does not depend on the truth\nof the geological resource scarcity model to predict deleteri-\nous effects for any area faced with reduced access to energy.\nGiven the link between energy consumption and community\neconomic well-being in the United States, any disruption to\nstable and affordable energy due to either above ground\n(political) or below ground (geological) causes would (in\ndue course) necessitate a community reset to a reduced living\nstandard.\nWith the foregoing considerations in mind, one plausible\nhypothesis stemming from this thesis is as follows: the\ninability of areas to access and consume energy resources at\nreasonable cost can be expected to produce aggregated risks\nof instrumental forms of social expression, including pat-\nterns of heightened disorder and crime. Energy consumption\npatterns across units should be inversely associated with\nrespective rates of instrumental crimes.\nAdditional Conceptual Controls\nMany variables have been assessed for their empirical asso-\nciation with instrumental violence in previous research.\nAlong with the skewed ability to consume energy, several\nfactors are likely to be predictive of aggregate crime pat-\nterns, and so it is appropriate to statistically control for these\nin the presence of the energy consumption indicator. The\nlogic for these statistical controls follows.\nConcentrated Disadvantage\nConcentrated disadvantage has been a widely utilized con-\ncept and predictor variable in violence research. Literature\non violence highlights several conceptually distinct (but\nempirically overlapping) structural factors that should be sta-\ntistically held constant to increase the precision of estimated\neffects. Land, McCall, and Cohen (1990) emphasized over-\nlapping features of social structure that have been linked\nwith community disorganization and crime. The basic insight\nis that overlapping features of social inequality are constitu-\ntive of a condition that increases the propensity for violence\nacross neighborhoods and communities. Conditions includ-\ning race, poverty, and income inequality have been shown to\nexhibit overlapping effects on violence rates in previous\nstudies (Hagan, 1997; Morenoff, Sampson, & Raudenbush,\npractice of previous structural research in constructing a\ncombined indicator of concentrated disadvantage. We expect\nthe following: In counties where an indicator of concen-\ntrated disadvantage is heightened, the rate of instrumental\nviolence should be expanded.\nUnemployment\nUnemployment has been the focus of a great deal of research\nrelating to punishment (Chiricos & Delone, 1992). The\n6 SAGE Open\nrelationship extended to instrumental violence (robbery) is\nstraightforward. Where unemployment is heightened, there\nis more pressure to resolve economic strain through redis-\ntributive violence. Jacobs and Helms (1997) draw on insights\nfrom Blau (1964), arguing that \"redistributive violence is\none method the dependent can be expected to use to over-\ncome their disadvantaged position in unbalanced exchange\nwell that a high unemployment rate contributes to reduced\nlegitimate opportunities and may result in \"economic-\ninduced strain\" (p. 464). If this argument has merit, we\nexpect the following: Heightened unemployment should be a\npositive correlate with instrumental crime. But where the\nunemployment rate is reduced, crime should be curtailed.\nBlack/White Median Household Incomes\nTwo alternative models have been prevalent in studying the\nrelationship between racial income ratios and violence. A\nconflict hypothesis sees greater inequality resulting in the\nheightening of criminal patterns of economic redistribution,\nhere operationalized as robberies. In this model, greater dis-\nparity in incomes, representing minority disempowerment in\nrelationship to Whites, would be a factor shaping robbery\npatterns. And so we expect to observe a negative sign on the\ncoefficient. Alternatively, a racial competition model con-\nceptualizes that as Blacks approach parity with Whites, a\nrange of social difficulties tends to take shape. This would\nlikely be a consequence of greater direct competition for eco-\nnomic resources and shifts in status differentials across racial\ngroups, as well as the separation of middle-class Blacks from\nan increasingly concentrated class of minorities who have\nbeen economically marginalized. A consequence of rising\nexpectations is the tendency for violence as expectations are\nnot fully (and equally) gratified. In this competition model,\nthe relative equalizing of group social power should heighten\ncompetition over the distribution of limited resources and\nmay trigger diffuse mechanisms that contribute to and result\nin heightened rates of robbery. In other words, we would\nexpect to observe a positive coefficient if the competition\nmodel is supported.\nHousehold Instability\nInformal controls are plausibly weakened by rapid turnover\nin any community. Early social ecology literature recognized\nthe degrading influences associated with population turnover\nas local communities attempted to establish governing norms\n(Sampson, Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997; Shaw & McKay,\n1942). To address these concerns, we include a statistical\ncontrol that seeks to isolate influences for a widely recog-\nnized dimension of neighborhood stability, household moves\nin the last 5 years. Areas with high turnover should on aver-\nage be less able to informally govern public spaces and con-\ntrol economically marginalized members. One expected\nresult of this weakening of informal social control is that in\nareas with higher rates of household moves, we should see\nheightened rates of robbery. But in areas characterized by\ngreater household stability, the robbery rates should be\nreduced.\nPopulation Size\nLarger populations produce more interpersonal exchanges\nand provide greater opportunities for crime as more potential\ntargets are available for victimization. Highly populated\nareas also allow individuals to remain anonymous and so\nmay be related to lower societal control on criminal activities\nand situations that may result in violence (Felson, 1995). All\nof these factors suggest that population size should be related\nto the level of violence, and so we include population as a\nstatistical control. Larger populations should be associated\nwith heightened rates of crime, while less populated counties\nshould experience reduced crime.\nThe Strength of Police Forces\nFinally, policing has been theorized as providing a deterrent\neffect but research has to date failed to provide unambiguous\nevidence in support of the deterrence hypothesis (Walker &\nare most concentrated in areas with heightened social control\nties most affected by social and economic marginalization\nare generally areas that most strongly utilize police services.\nMoreover, these same areas may have strong political inter-\nests in maintaining reserve capacity to address socially\nthreatening disruptions with enhanced police-administered\nviolence. With this in mind, we posit a positive empirical\nlink between area police resources and crime. As police are\nhired to provide routine service while also providing reserve\ncapacity to manage social threats, it would not be surprising\nto find that personnel are most concentrated in the most\ncrime-prone areas. Formally, we expect that the strength of\npolice forces will be closely correlated with the crime rate. In\nother words, we expect to observe a positive association\nbetween police (whose presence affords reserve capacity to\nhandle serious disruptions to social stability while also\nremaining responsive to ordinary demands for service in\nhigh demand areas) and patterns of instrumental crime.\nRegional Dummies\nWe control for regional effects with a series of dummies. In\nthe various models, we include dummy indicators for the\nNortheast, Midwest, and South, with the Western region\nserving as the omitted (reference) category. A dummy\napproach is useful because regions may differ substantially\nin terms of their respective cultures and economic require-\nments even as jurisdictions within any region remain\nHelms and Costanza 7\nrelatively similar to each other. Moreover, a dummy approach\ncan assist in reducing spatial autocorrelation (for an addi-\ntional statement to this effect, see Helms, 2009). Finally, the\ninclusion of regional dummies can be expected to capture\nsystematic influences on the robbery rates indicator that are\notherwise unmeasured and untheorized. For all of these rea-\nsons, we include regional dummy indicators in the analyses\nbelow.\nMethod\nResearch Design, Sample, Dependent Variable,\nand Method\nThis study uses a cross-sectional research design and sample\ndata on 868 U.S. counties to assess diverse correlates of\ninstrumental crime.6 The dependent variable in this study is\nthe per capita rate of robbery. Information used to construct\nthe robbery rate indicator was taken from the Uniform Crime\nReport, published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for\nthe year 2001. As the per capita rate exhibits positive skew,\nwe logged the indicator. As some counties reported 0s, we\nadded a 1 prior to logging. Therefore, the indicator used in\nthe analysis below is the natural log of the rate of robberies\n(+1). We note here that robbery is an instrumental crime cen-\ntered on the acquisition of resources, and it is also a crime\ninvolving either force or the threat of force and so it is an\nevent that involves substantial risks as well as the potential\nfor economic rewards. Robbery is a particularly relevant\nfocus for this research because the primary thesis focuses on\nthe role of inequality in energy consumption in the produc-\ntion of crime.\nThe robbery indicator, we note, has characteristics of left\ncensoring.7 When an outcome variable is characterized by\nthe presence of 0s, this may result in estimation difficulties\nthat cannot be easily remedied using standard ordinary least\nsquares (OLS). In such a data analytic situation, one alterna-\ntive is to explicitly model the presence of left censoring with\na Tobit model (StataCorp, 2008). In the analysis that follows,\nwe assess statistical results produced using a Tobit estima-\ntion procedure.\nIndependent Indicators\nIndependent variables used in this analysis were taken from\nthe U.S. 2000 Census and were merged with other data\nsources. The energy use indicator is an aggregate estimate of\ntotal energy consumption from all sources measured in tril-\nlions of British Thermal Units. Data used to construct this\nindicator were taken from the U.S. Energy Information\nAdministration. We standardized the indicator, dividing by\ntotal population and multiplying by a constant. To correct for\npositive skew, the indicator is logged.\nSocial disorganization indicators were constructed by\ncombining U.S. 2000 census data and U.S. Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis data. Structural researchers have\nincreasingly focused on a confluence of variables that\ntogether have been linked with socially disadvantaged condi-\nuse a constructed indicator of concentrated disadvantage\nbased on the results of an un-rotated principal components\nanalysis.\nStrong factor loadings on indicators for poverty, percent\nBlack population, and the Gini coefficient computed on fam-\nily incomes indicated substantial overlap in the regression\nspace; therefore, these indicators were used to construct the\ncombined index of concentrated disadvantage. In addition,\nunemployment is operationalized as the percent unemployed\nas reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The popu-\nlation indicator exhibited skew and so it is logged.\nNeighborhood instability is measured as the percentage of\nhouseholds that experienced a move in the past 5 years.\nRacial economic inequality is operationalized with a ratio\nindicator of Black to White median household incomes.\nPolice and Regional Variation Indicators\nPolice capacity was operationalized with an indicator of the\nnumber of badged deputies per 10,000 county population.\nWe rescaled the indicator by applying a natural log to address\npositive skew. Regional variation is addressed with a series\nof dummies. We follow convention and develop dummy\nindicators for the four major regions (South, Northeast,\nMidwest, and West). The West is treated as the reference or\nomitted category in the analyses.\nThe basic model should result in positive coefficients on\nindicators of concentrated disadvantage, unemployment,\nhousehold instability, and population size. Also, for reasons\nnoted above, the police rate should exhibit a positive and sig-\nnificant effect on the robbery rate. We are agnostic regarding\nthe sign of the coefficient on the Black\u00adWhite median\nincome indicator; the energy consumption indicator should\nexhibit an inverse relationship with the dependent variable.\nState dummies are not explicitly theorized and may take\neither a positive or negative sign in the analyses.\nAnalyses\nPreliminary Analysis of Data\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics for all of the indicators\nused in the analyses. Table 2 includes zero-order correla-\ntions. We note that correlations among the respective inde-\npendent variables are all modest. Table 3 includes estimates\nfor three alternative specifications of the robbery rates model.\nThe first model focuses on the energy consumption-instru-\nmental violence hypothesis. Model 2 retains the energy indi-\ncator but includes diverse indicators from the social\ndisorganization literature and also the police rate. In the final\nmodel, all of the foregoing indicators are retained and\nregional dummies are introduced.\n8 SAGE Open\nResults: County-Level Influences on Instrumental\nViolence Rates\nThe first model presented in Table 3 provides initial evidence\nof a significant inverse association between the energy con-\nsumption indicator and the dependent variable (-3.90**).\nThis result offers confirmation that areas experiencing a high\nlevel of per capita energy consumption are linked with\nreduced rates of localized instrumental violence. This impor-\ntant result, however, must be treated tentatively because the\nmodel does not contain any of the plausible social disorgani-\nzation controls theorized above. We note that the overall\nmodel is significant (2 = 15.14**), but the pseudo R2 for the\nmodel is rather small (.005), implying that only the barest\namount of variance appears to have been accounted for with\nthis specification. Having said this, we note that the signifi-\ncant likelihood ratio chi-square tells us that our model as a\nwhole fits significantly better than an empty model (i.e., a\nmodel with no predictors).\nModel 2 introduces an array of theoretically plausible\ncontrols into the instrumental crime model. After having\nexpanded the model, we note the persistence of the energy-\nrobbery rates empirical link. The tabled results in Model 2\nagain prove consistent with the energy withdrawal-instru-\nmental violence hypothesis. Across the sample, counties\nwith the highest levels of energy consumption experienced\nthe lowest rates of robbery (-3.38**). After introducing the\nseries of social disorganization and police rate indicators, we\npseudo R2 = .275). Model 2 shows support for a variety of\nadditional hypotheses. The sworn police rate exhibits a sig-\nnificant positive effect (1.91*) suggesting that augmented\nlaw enforcement services are closely correlated with height-\nened crime. The combined indicator of concentrated disad-\nvantage exhibits a close positive association with violent\ncrime in many empirical studies and this result is reproduced\nhere as the indicator is highly significant with a positive sign\nInstability (7.97**) also are each shown to exhibit a positive\nand highly significant association with the dependent vari-\nable. The coefficient for the Black/White income ratio is sig-\nnificant and exhibits an inverse association with the robbery\nrate (-5.50**). According to our conceptualization of this\nindicator, the result is most consistent with a conflict hypoth-\nesis. Where inequality is greatest economic stress and related\nsocial tensions likely contribute to expanded criminal redis-\ntribution of scarce and valued resources. One surprise in the\nanalysis is associated with the unemployment indicator.\nRather than exhibiting the expected positive association,\nimplying that the presence of larger unemployed populations\nwould be a predictor of increased instrumental crime, we\nobserved the opposite effect. The percentage of the labor\nforce currently experiencing unemployment is a negative\npredictor of the robbery rate (-3.29**). One possible expla-\nnation for this result is linked to unemployment benefits as a\nfactor reducing immediate economic stresses for recently\nunemployed individuals. In addition, those recently unem-\nployed are most likely strongly tied to labor market processes\n(in other words, informal controls on behavior) and may be\nunlikely candidates for street robbery in the absence of quite\nstrong catalyzing circumstances. On the other side of the\nequation is the effect of unemployment on the circulation of\npeople with economic resources. Heightened unemployment\nmay be a factor that actually reduces the circulation of lucra-\ntive targets (individuals with cash and other material posses-\nsions)inopportunisticsocialenvironmentssuchasdowntown\nbars, sporting events, and other inviting settings for crime.\nBut the effect extends to others who may feel economic anxi-\nety, and therefore curtail their own social activities. The net\nresult of these processes might be a reduction in criminal\nopportunities and thus a reduced rate of instrumental crimes.\nThe empirical results of this study appear consistent with\nsuch alternative theorizing concerning the unemployment-\ncrime link.\nModel 3 retains all of the previously discussed indicators\nand introduces regional dummies into the Tobit model in the\nattempt to further assess the effects of energy inequality on\ninstrumental crime rates. The overall model appears slightly\nenhanced with the introduction of the regional dummy vari-\nsumption indicator remains a strong negative predictor of\narea robbery rates (-3.00**). All of the previously discussed\nindicators remain significant with consistent signs on the\ncoefficients. The respective dummy indicators represent rel-\native mean differences when compared with the omitted cat-\negory (West region). All of the dummy indicators are\nsignificant, implying that these areas of the country experi-\nence significantly heightened rates of robbery relative to the\nWestern region, holding constant a diverse array of structural\nindicators.\nWith regard to our focal hypothesis, the inclusion of con-\ntextual controls in Model 2 and then regional dummies in\nModel 3 resulted in only modest changes in the estimated\nTable 1. Descriptives (868 Observations).\nVariables M SD\nNote. D = dummy.\nHelms and Costanza 9\ncoefficient. This result is reassuring because it suggests that\ndiverse specifications of the robbery model produce stable\nestimates on the key hypothesized relationship. The only\nnotable differences in results across Models 2 and 3 are a\nslight reduction in the unemployment coefficient and corre-\nsponding significance level (dropping from .01 to .05) and an\nenhanced coefficient and significance level on the police rate\nindicator.\nWhat makes for a most interesting discussion is that other\nindicators drawn from the research on crime proved signifi-\ncant in the various models but did not eliminate the relation-\nship between patterns of energy consumption and\ninstrumental violence. The estimated coefficient for an index\nof concentrated disadvantage proved positive and statisti-\ncally significant in this model. Counties characterized by\nsubstantial social hardship and economic disadvantage\napparently experienced heightened rates of instrumental\ncrime. Both the population indicator and indicator of house-\nhold instability exhibited positive and significant associa-\ntions with the robbery rates as anticipated in the theory\nsection. More heavily populated counties and counties with a\ngreater percentage of households experiencing recent moves\nwere both associated with heightened instrumental crimes.\nAreas characterized by larger populations and greater popu-\nlation movements apparently are welcoming environments\nfor robbery because these conditions foster anonymity that\nfavors criminal actors in selecting targets, timing attacks, and\nfacilitating escape from the scene of the confrontation.\nThe Black/White income ratio in this model is significant\nand exhibits a negative sign on the coefficient, yet does not\nundermine the effects of the energy consumption indicator.\nWe note that this result is evident after isolating important\ntheorized structural controls that have been extensively con-\nceptualized and evaluated in the crime research. Although\nregional dummies are all significant predictors of instrumen-\ntal violence in the third model, they do not obscure the sig-\nnificant relationship between energy consumption and\ninstrumental violence patterns. This provides for interesting\nspeculation, as certain areas of the country are thought to be\nmore dependent on gas, oil, coal, or hydroelectric resources.\nOstensibly, the relationship between energy consumption\nand violence should have been nullified while controlling for\nthe effects of regions, as it is known that there is tremendous\nvariability in access to respective sources of energy across\nareas, and particularly regions. In fact, after controlling for\nregional variation and a diverse set of structural controls and\nTable 2. Zero-Order Correlations (868 Observations).\nNote. D = dummy.\nTable 3.

Areas with greater utilization of\nenergy resources (our global indicator captures all sources\nincluding personal and household use, transportation, public,\nand industrial uses among other uses within any area) are\nassociated with reduced instrumental violence but areas less\nable to effectively utilize energy resources to address social\ndemand for goods and services were associated with height-\nened rates of instrumental violence.\nLimitations of the Data\nBefore proceeding to conclusions, it is necessary to discuss\nvarious limitations inherent in this analysis. The data include\nobservations from a single year and may not accurately cap-\nture the volatile dynamics of energy or crime. Using cross-\nsectional data, we must infer causal connections that are\ninherently time dependent by observing variation across\nunits at a single point in time. We acknowledge this limita-\ntion and strongly encourage other researchers to develop\nmulti-year data to advance this hypothesized link between\nenergy inequality and community violence. We also acknowl-\nedge limitations in the generality of our findings both with\nregard to the United States as a whole and to areas beyond\nthe United States. The data used in this research represents a\nsample of the large number of counties in the United States\nand these were originated by their sources for diverse pur-\nposes, not the least of which included the study of police\nadministration (i.e., Law Enforcement Management and\nAdministrative Statistics [LEMAS] data from the Federal\nGovernment). The questions animating original data collec-\ntion efforts and sampling methodologies across data collec-\ntion projects may have produced biases that we are unaware\nof as consumers of secondary data.\nRegarding comparisons with processes in areas beyond\nthe United States, we note that Muntaner, Lynch, and Smith\n(2001) have pointed out that neighborhood dynamics vary\nfrom country to country. In some countries, the state is the\nprime arbiter of economic redistribution, while in other\nnations there may be common enemies that force social\ncohesion. Zureik (1988), for example, pointed out that in\nareas such as Palestine where value systems differ traditional\ntheories of deviance may not apply. We note as well that\nsocial welfare and health and retirement systems vary sub-\nstantially across countries. All of these considerations may\nmediate the effects of energy consumption patterns on rates\nof instrumental crime.\nThis only serves to highlight the fact that the present\nresearch pursues insight concerning a tentative hypothesis\nand provides analysis of this conceptualized relationship for\none advanced society. It would be presumptuous to assert\ngenerality beyond the units under study. Indeed, we hope that\nthis inquiry will stimulate additional assessment of the thesis\nusing alternative methods and perhaps cross-national data to\nassess the generality of these findings.\nFinally, we note that the time period under study offers a\nconservative test of the thesis because the pricing of oil was\nrelatively inexpensive at the time of the study's data genera-\ntion and citizens in the United States had not yet encountered\nthe full discourse on terror and associated resource wars that\nensued over the following decade. We strongly encourage\nfurther research into this thesis because these questions, in\nour view, are of critical importance to society; we are on the\ncusp of a period of uncertainty because resources are\nexpected to become increasingly scarce and the struggle over\naccess to and control of resources is expected to escalate.\nConclusion\nEconomists tend to view efficiency gains related to energy\nconsumption favorably. Utilization of fossil fuels facilitates\neconomic expansion. Economic expansion is thought to be a\nfactor in the stabilization of communities. Stable communi-\nties experience lower crime rates. Although it may be a bitter\npill to swallow, social scientists (especially criminologists)\nmust eventually come to terms with the importance of natu-\nral resource extraction on community safety and well-being.\nThere are some very practical examples of this link in action\nthat we see in everyday life. Energy is essential to all facets\nof modern urban life, including maintaining police forces\nand implementing various initiatives that seek to stabilize\ncommunities. Central to this analysis is the realization that\nstable economic expansion under current conditions of\nextreme complexity and economic interdependence requires\nperpetual expansion of energy inputs. We note as well the\ncritical role energy plays in the growth of the economy as\nrepresented in the system of money and the issuing of debt\n(for a full review of this aspect, see Martenson, 2011).\nThe widening gap between available energy at a low cost\nand demand for energy under conditions of economic expan-\nsion may one day result in a failure of supply to meet demand.\nThe practical result of this realization is that for economi-\ncally marginalized areas the ability to deliver goods and ser-\nvices must reflect that shortage. For communities on the\neconomic margins, this means that some goods and services\nwill become less available for consumption if there is a fail-\nure to continue to supply local economic processes.\nThe situation proposed is somewhat similar to the with-\ndrawal of industry from any given area. For communities,\nthe worst-case scenario may be the increasing presence of\npoverty for ever larger percentages of the local population,\nand, for those who cannot gain access to the most basic level\nof resources, starvation or freezing to death from lack of\nelectrical, steam, or gas heating. Another possibility is that\nindividuals will innovate and turn to criminal behavior to\nensure basic needs are met. If such a scenario plays itself out,\none would expect an uncertain social environment and per-\nceived need to incorporate defensive strategies to mitigate\ncriminal risks. That said, we note that even though we cannot\npredict on a given day (or on a given street corner) what\nperson will engage in a robbery, we can certainly develop\nHelms and Costanza 11\ninsights concerning aggregate patterns of robbery. The\nempirical results of the foregoing study provide preliminary\nevidence consistent with the hypothesized energy with-\ndrawal-instrumental violence association.\nAlthough these alternative futures may appear distant and\nunlikely to the educated and socially mobile reader, the\nproven depletion of oil energy reserves may already have\nasserted itself into community. The American landscape is\nreplete with bust-towns that once relied on natural resource\nextraction to drive the local economy. However, when con-\nsidering the fate of such places, it should be pointed out that\noil-depletion would eventually reach into all communities,\nnot just those that are currently or have been in the past sub-\nject to economic and social dislocation. In this context, we\nstrongly encourage readers to access and review the excel-\nlent summary by Korowicz (2010) on the relationship\nbetween an exponentially growing demand for energy and\nthe stable functioning of the complex and highly interdepen-\ndent just-in-time delivery systems that support the function-\ning economy.\nAlthough political venues are continually in flux, the\nsocioeconomic impact of inequality that correlates with vio-\nlent crime appears stable. Energy distribution as it is viewed\nhere represents a distinct dimension of inequality, a general\nconcern that has been firmly established in the literature on\ncrime. The foregoing analysis provides evidence of an\nempirical link between a global indicator of resource inequal-\nity and patterns of increased violent crime. In future research,\nwe may seek to find what aspects of energy distribution are\nspecifically linked to community development and enhanced\nquality of life. But for now, it would behoove civic leaders to\nseek changes in policy that would address future inequalities\nin the distribution of energy. The price of oil has risen to\nmore than US$100 a barrel and current political machina-\ntions such as the \"war on terror\" have substantially factored\ninto the resource supply equation. This is readily observable\nin the U.S. government's sustained expansion of a world-\nwide-militarized presence, with a notable focus on energy\nresource-rich areas. But we also observe political decisions\nfavorable to private investments in fracking technologies,\ndevelopment of ethanol, deep water drilling, and exploration\nof the far reaches of the North Pole in the milieu of melting\nice sheets, among other energy development supports.\nIn consideration of the heightening strain on the global-\nized energy system (associated with both geological and\npolitical forces), we note escalating security developments at\nhome and abroad and speculate that law enforcement and\ncorrectional agencies are very likely to experience a tighten-\ning of resources that will hamper administration and plan-\nning for emergent social control challenges. One plausible\napproach is to prepare for anticipated crises in the criminal\njustice system and wider communities by articulating poli-\ncies that focus on the impact of energy distribution within\ncommunities.8 The reality is that the federal government\nappears preoccupied with other matters. The overextension\nof the United States in world military conflicts has been\nmatched with domestic developments sustained over many\nyears in the form of a buildup of militarized police forces\nlockdown of Boston, Massachusetts (in response to the\nrecent bombing at the annual Boston Marathon), and the\ninternational crisis stemming from Edward Snowden's whis-\ntle-blowing regarding National Security Agency (NSA)\nmonitoring of electronic transactions and communications\nare indicators that the U.S. government is currently highly\nsensitized to state security. But there has been a marked fail-\nure to address the nation's overwhelming reliance on fossil\nfuels or to take obvious steps in redirecting government\nresources to develop meaningful alternatives.\nThere are several recommendations for contingency plan-\nning in the presence of predictable social developments asso-\nciated with energy scarcity in the near term. We have\nhighlighted that reduced energy consumption is linked with\nreductions in the scale of economic functioning. We have\nalso noted that according to several experts, the primary cat-\nalyst for economic growth (oil) is being depleted. Radical\npolicy addressing alternatives to oil and fossil fuels are a\ngambit that the U.S. federal government does not appear\nwilling to risk. However, results presented in this article\nclearly would seem to support development of solar, wind,\nand hydroelectric power if America is to counter rising\nenergy costs and also, incidentally, may be a factor in miti-\ngating the risk of rising violent crime rates.\nIt seems pertinent to focus intensively on developing fed-\neral policies that address more than just the symptoms of the\nproblem. If global oil shortages are a phenomenon that will\nplay out over the life of the current or next generation, surely\nthis development will manifest in concrete difficult realities.\nSuch realities we can expect might include reductions in eco-\nnomic security, diminished employment opportunities, and a\ndecline in the effectiveness of public sector services such as\nschooling and other assistance programs.\nDuring the 1930s, several policies were developed to\nbegin to address social welfare needs and thereby allay fears\nand create hope among the generation suffering through the\nGreat Depression. Backers of these policies were accused of\nbeing \"communists.\" The emergence of an extensive social\nwelfare safety net was delayed by the emergent affluence of\nthe postwar era. In anticipation of evolving structural prob-\nlems due in part to energy depletion, the state could take\nadvantage of its ability to marshal resources and target such\npolicies with an eye toward extracting the meritorious fea-\ntures of previously attempted social welfare assistance. We\nnote in this context that the federal government has an ability\nto extract usable resources and target their uses in ways that\nare unmatched by local governments and private interests\nFinally, we point out the need to develop police and com-\nmunity response options to prepare for and confront the\nhuman and social consequences of energy scarcity. Recent\ndevelopments in the criminal justice profession reflect a\ngrowing awareness of the limits of economic and budgetary\nexpansion. In addition to the corrections system beginning to\nquestion the utility of mass incarceration for non-violent\ncrimes, policing has changed as well. Currently, most fed-\neral, state, and local agencies list as part of their mission\nstatement the need to respond to the possibility of terrorist\nactions. Fortunately, along with martial developments, there\nhave been some very positive changes in the organization of\npolice services that reflect a pro-social orientation concern-\ning the police role. Obviously, there are potential threats and\nopportunities present in both of these developments, both for\nlaw enforcement and for the communities they serve.\nCoercion when held in reserve has a powerful effect on com-\npliance with legitimate authority edicts. But coercion alone\nwill never suffice in controlling an angry and desperate pop-\nulation in the face of resource shortages. Police and local\nofficials need to work closely with local citizens to develop\nsystems of resilience and support in advance of anticipated\nproblems. This is a generally good idea for any enlightened\nleadership, but it is critical in the presence of sustained pro-\ncesses of declining resources, a condition anticipated by\nresearchers who study energy and limits on future energy\navailability.\nWe wholeheartedly invite crime and justice researchers to\nevaluate with other data and modeling techniques the empiri-\ncal and conceptual links developed in this article. This is par-\nticularly true with regard to the energy indicator and its\nrelationship to social order and related concerns about social\ncontrol. We can hope that a pandemic crisis will be averted\nby miraculous as yet un-invented technologies, but should\nalways ponder new areas of insight. The failure to articulate\nthis area of discourse could leave citizens and governing\nofficials (as well as researchers themselves) confounded at\nthe rapid scale of changes and also misinformed about plau-\nsible links between social conflict and resource limits both at\nhome and abroad. We strongly encourage research by aca-\ndemics and attention to these issues in both federal and local\npolicy arenas. With empirically grounded insight, we can\nhope to counter the worst possible outcomes and contribute\nto greater effectiveness of response in the face of a rapidly\nunfolding and highly uncertain future.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. Various reports (e.g., Hirsch, Bezdek, & Wendling, 2005,\n2010) have already done the difficult work of marshaling com-\npelling evidence that the peaking and subsequent decline of\nliquid fuels will result in unrivaled difficulties throughout the\nworld for modern governments and the societies they govern.\nAs we note in the main text, Korowicz (2010) takes these and\nother similar studies as a point of departure while pointing\nout a wide range of adverse near term consequences likely to\nemerge in response to the anticipated near term energy with-\ndrawal from the world economy.\n2. Ruppert (2009) refers to energy and economic systems as\nSiamese twins. They expand and contract in concert. This is\ninexorably the case because new energy is required to expand\nthe economy and any reduction in the available supply of\nenergy necessarily will result in a corresponding reduction in\nproductive capacity and destruction of market demand.\n3. The webpage for Association for the Study of Peak Oil & Gas\u00ad\nIrish Chapter (n.d., ASPO-USA) documents these statements\nwith the following: Historical proof of Peak Oil is demon-\nstrated by the work of M. King Hubbert, who, in 1956, cor-\nrectly predicted that U.S. oil production would peak between\nanalysts believe that we are now at or near the top of the curve\nof global oil production (for the US case, see Figure 1). Peak\nOil is not about \"running out\" of oil, but the curve does illus-\ntrate the quantity and pace at which humanity has extracted\nand used oil. With a rising world population and large develop-\ning countries like China and India experiencing rapid growth,\nstripping supply. During the second half of 2008, high oil\nprices plus financial turmoil and the economic slump actually\nreduced demand for oil, thus prices crashed. But the reprieve\nwill only be temporary because more oil is being consumed\nthan found; despite the latest technology, few major oil fields\nhave been discovered since the mid-1970s. The most valuable\nand widely used source of energy on earth is gradually become\nharder to find and more expensive, setting the scene for con-\nsiderable social and economic change worldwide.\n4. We note a related concern associated with anticipated world-\nwide declines in energy, here. The ability of exporting nations\nto continue to supply oil and energy exports will very likely be\naffected negatively due to growing domestic demand in source\ncountries for this declining resource. This scenario implies that\nas resources worldwide become increasingly scarce, the quan-\ntity of exports will contract at a rate higher than the decline\nrate for the world as a whole. For the most energy depen-\ndent nations, such as the United States, substantial reliance\non imported fuels presents a critical strategic challenge that\nhas been the focus of intensive and often secretive efforts to\ndevelop and deploy the means to secure a stable future supply\nof energy. Central to these policy developments is an acute\nawareness that access to and consumption of critical energy\nresources underwrites continuing expansion of the economy.\n5. Sampson and Wilson (1995) note the \"unproductive mix of\ncontroversy and silence\" surrounding discussions of race and\ncrime as criminologists are loath to openly discuss issues that\nmight be misconstrued as racist.\n6. Original construction of the data focused on research surround-\ning police administration and related police outcomes and used\nLaw Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics\n(LEMAS) data. LEMAS data collection is based on a sam-\npling procedure that insured all urban agencies were included\nas well as a stratified random sample of smaller jurisdictions.\nHelms and Costanza 13\nConsequently, data used in this analysis cannot assess energy\nconsumption patterns for all U.S. counties but is limited to a\nlarge representative sample.\n7. Robberies are on the upper end of an inclusive range of instru-\nmental criminal activities recorded by police, many of which\nlie below the threshold for inclusion in the robbery category.\nFor example, larceny, burglary, and auto theft are each instru-\nmental crimes but are considered lesser crimes. Indeed, these\nare the core categories of property crimes in the Uniform\nCrime Report, while robbery is included as one of the four\nviolent crimes. In addressing robberies, we consider the fact\nthat these events involve force or the threat of force while tak-\ning possession of property and so it is a serious instrumental\ncrime posing substantial risk for both victims and offenders,\nif caught and prosecuted. The robbery indicator exhibits some\nzeros across the sample of counties but this should not imply\nthat these are free of all instrumental crimes. Indeed, we might\nexpect to still observe many lesser categories of instrumental\ncriminal activity even if there are no recorded robberies for the\nyear. But as our recording instrument does not include these\ncategories, the data record is censored at zero. Under such\ncircumstances, an alternative to ordinary least squares (OLS)\nmay provide a more consistent estimate of effects. Tobit is a\nmethod that seeks to explicitly estimate effects under condi-\ntions involving censoring on the outcome indicator. For this\nreason, we present the results based on a Tobit model.\n8. Community resilience is not something that can be expected to\narise suddenly and successfully. It must be fostered and devel-\noped, and this is something that requires thoughtful efforts,\nplanning, and resources in its own right. This extends well\nbeyond a focus on reducing the risk of crime; the implications\nfor food security, social mobility, and a wide range of neigh-\nborhood and community systems for delivery of essential\nsocial services (schools, sewage and water treatment facilities,\npower generation, parks, emergency services and social con-\ntrol, among others) are susceptible to disruption and should\nbe given full consideration in any contingency planning sur-\nrounding future energy security.\nReferences\nAlam, M.
