However, understanding the extent to\nwhich inequities in different types of food resources exist\nin different types of the US communities is limited by\nseveral factors.\nFirst, research has focused on `food deserts', generally\ndefined as areas with limited access to affordable fresh\nfoods from supermarkets (see reviews8e11). Subse-\nquently, `food swamps',12 13 characterised as neigh-\nbourhoods with disproportionate access to convenient,\nenergy-dense nutrient-poor foods sold by convenience\nstores and fast-food restaurants, emerged as important\ndimensions of the food environment. Thus, attention to\na variety of food resources, such as supermarkets,\nconvenience stores and fast-food restaurants, may be\na more useful approach to examining neighbourhood\nSecond, most existing food access initiatives target low-\nincome dense urban areas, yet inequities in access to\nhealthy foods may be even more pronounced in\nsuburban and rural areas due to greater dispersion of\nresources and car-dependent infrastructure.14 In addi-\ntion, geographic distribution of food outlets relative to\nhomes, transportation infrastructure and other\nresources differs across urbanicity,16 17 perhaps due to\ndifferences in travel times to community resources18 and\npopulation density. Yet few studies examine how ineq-\nuities in availability of food resources might vary by\nurbanicity,9 19e21 and limited understanding relies on\ncomparisons across small geographically specific study\npopulations (eg, New Orleans compared with Texas\ncolonias). Generalisable understanding requires large\nnational study populations.\nThird, allocation of food resources according to\nincome has received the most focus, with some exami-\nnation of race/ethnic differences. Consideration of\nneighbourhood socioeconomic status alone has not\nother neighbourhood characteristics underlie food\nresource allocation. Patterning by race/ethnicity may\nfurther compound patterning according to income and\nwould underscore the importance of culturally sensitive\npolicies. However, the joint role of neighbourhood race/\nethnic composition and neighbourhood income has\nreceived little attention.25\nUsing Geographic Information Systems-derived\nneighbourhood characteristics from a national sample of\n13 995 young adults across the USA provides variation\nand sufficient sample size to examine disparities in\nneighbourhood food resource availability according to\nincome, race/ethnicity and urbanicity. We examined the\njoint role of neighbourhood race/ethnic composition\nand neighbourhood poverty across non-urban, low-\ndensity urban and high-density urban areas. Specifically,\nwe tested whether individuals living in neighbourhoods\ncomposed of populations with high proportions of\nimpoverished and minority residents had lower avail-\nability of grocery/supermarkets and greater availability of\nfast-food restaurants and convenience stores (compared\nwith lower poverty areas with high proportion of non-\nHispanic white populations), and whether this distribu-\ntion varied across less urban and more urban areas.\nMETHODS\nStudy population and data sources\nOur study sample is derived from respondents aged\nof the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(Add Health), a nationally representative prospective\ncohort study of adolescents of the US school-based\nSubjects eligible for inclusion in the analytic sample\nweights. The Add Health sample was collected under\nprotocols approved by the Institutional Review Board at\nthe University of North Carolina. The survey design and\nsampling frame have been discussed elsewhere.26 27\nWe used the Add Health Obesity and Neighbourhood\nEnvironment database (ONEdata), a Geographic\nInformation System that includes time-varying commu-\nnity-level data geographically linked to respondent resi-\ndential addresses geocoded with street-segment matches\n(n\u00bc13 039), global positioning system measurements\neach respondent location (neighbourhood buffers) and\nblock group, tract and county attributes from time-\nmatched US Census and other federal sources were\nmerged with individual-level Add Health interview\nresponses.28 The number of census block groups\ngroups.\nOf 14 322 Wave III respondents with sample weights,\n327 (2.3%) with missing food environment or the US\ncensus data were excluded, leaving an analytic sample of\nStudy variables\nGeographic Information Systems-derived neighbourhood data\nFor our central analysis, we used residential locations\nlinked to attributes of areas within 3 km straight-line\ndistance (Euclidean buffer) and along the street network\n(street network buffer) surrounding each respondent's\nresidential location in Wave III (2001). The 3 km buffer\nwas designed to capture distances readily accessible by\nwalking and driving to neighbourhood diet- and activity-\nconducted with 1 and 8 km buffers. Neighbourhood\nfood environment, socio-demographic and urban indi-\ncator data were merged with individual-level Add Health\ninterview data.\nFood environment\nFood resource data were obtained from Dun and Brad-\nstreet, a commercial data set of the US businesses. Food\nAre neighbourhood food resources distributed inequitably in the USA?\ngroup.bmj.com\nbmjopen.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nresources were classified according to 4- and 8-digit\nStandard Industrial Classification codes. Three cate-\ngories of food resources were used: (1) fast-food restau-\nrants, defined as fast-food chain and non-chain\nrestaurants, excluding food stands and cafeterias; (2)\ngrocery stores and supermarkets, defined as indepen-\ndent and chain grocery stores and supermarkets and (3)\nconvenience stores, defined as variety and convenience\nstores and food stores attached to gasoline filling\nstations. Full details are described in online appendix A.\nWe characterised neighbourhood food resource avail-\nability as the count of each type of resource per roadway\ndistance within a 3 km street network buffer, which\nrepresents availability to resources relative to the street\nnetwork and potentially reflects routes of travel.31 While\nothers have used measures such as the modified retail\nfood environment index,32 which measures the avail-\nability of healthy relative to unhealthy food stores, ratio\nmeasures may obscure differential variation across food\noutlet types. Since this is a major focus of the current\nstudy, we use absolute measures of fast food, conve-\nnience stores and supermarkets and examine each\nresource type separately. In addition, by controlling for\npopulation density, we capture resources relative to what\nmight be expected with respect to population distribu-\ntion. Given the variation in classification of the food\nenvironment in the literature (see review33), we present\nfindings across several different food environment\nmeasures (eg, count per population, distance to nearest\noutlet).\nGiven the importance of scaling resources by general\nurban development, we created measures of resources\nper 100 km of secondary/connecting and local neigh-\nbourhood and rural roads using street data obtained\nronmental Systems Research Institute (http://www.esri.\ncom) in Redlands, California, USA. We selected the 3 km\nstreet network buffer after evaluating associations with\nresource availability and sensitivity of buffer size. We thus\ndefined neighbourhood food resource availability as the\nnumber of outlets per 100 km of roadway within a 3 km\nnetwork buffer to account for differences in food\nresource counts according to the amount of commercial\nactivity in an area.\nNeighbourhood socio-demographics\nCensus block groups were used to define neighbour-\nhoods because smaller units are more likely to adhere to\nindividually perceived neighbourhood boundaries34 and\nare more socio-demographically homogeneous. Using\nthe federal definition of `poverty area',35 36 we dicho-\ntomised neighbourhood poverty into >20% or #20% of\npopulation below the federal poverty level. We defined\nneighbourhood minority population as percentage of\npopulation of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity and\nneighbourhood-level education as percentage of popu-\nlation $25 years with college or greater education. While\nother studies have used a neighbourhood deprivation\nindex to provide an `empirical summary of total area-\nlevel variance explained by the census variables',37 we\ninvestigated neighbourhood race/ethnicity and income\nas separate constructs. We focus on these two specific\ncharacteristics to address the theoretical processes of\nresource placement in areas with greater purchasing\npower (income) and political leverage associated with\nthe majority race. To evaluate potential interaction of\nneighbourhood poverty status with minority population,\nwe created a categorical variable: (1) low poverty/low\nminority, (2) high poverty/low minority, (3) low\npoverty/medium minority, (4) high poverty/medium\nminority, (5) low poverty/high minority and (6) high\npoverty/high minority.\nNeighbourhood urbanicity\nMost studies characterise urbanicity based on population\ndensity.19 We improve on such traditional definitions by\nusing the US Census-defined urbanised areas (UAs) that\nwere used to classify residential locations as non-urban\n(outside UA) or urban (inside UA). Within urban areas,\nwe used Fragstats38 software with the US Geologic Survey\nNational Landcover Data to distinguish: (1) low-density\n(#95% (75th percentile) developed land cover) and (2)\nhigh-density (>95% developed land cover) urban areas\nbased on the area of developed land as a proportion of\ntotal area within 3 km after excluding water and ice. Our\nmeasure of developed land cover provides an indicator\nof urban development that is independent of population\ndensity and correctly classifies areas as within or outside\nthe UA (receiver operating characteristic curve\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive analysis\nAvailability of food resources and socio-demographic\ncharacteristics were compared across non-urban,\nlow-density urban and high-density urban strata. We\nexamined urbanicity-specific tertiles of neighbourhood\nminority population (table 2) to address non-linear\nassociations with food resource availability measures. All\nstatistical analyses were weighted for national represen-\ntation and corrected for complex survey design using\nMultivariable regression analysis\nWe fit multivariable linear regression models to predict\nfood resource availability as a function of neighbour-\nhood poverty and minority population where our\nconstructed variable combining neighbourhood poverty\n(high and low) with levels of minority population (low,\nmedium, high) explicitly estimates interactions relative\nto the theoretically most advantaged neighbourhoods\n(low poverty/low minority). Given that food resources\nand neighbourhood socio-demographics varied dramat-\nically across urbanicity, comparability across socio-\ndemographic and geographic subpopulations was\ndifficult, even with our large sample size. Nonetheless,\nwe have large samples of individuals and block groups\nAre neighbourhood food resources distributed inequitably in the USA?\ngroup.bmj.com\nbmjopen.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nacross urbanicity strata, with adequate variation across\nneighbourhood socio-demographics (table 1). All\nmodels were weighted for national representation,\ncorrected for clustering on our primary sampling unit\n(schools) and controlled for continuous neighbour-\nhood-level education and population density dichotom-\nised into urbanicity-specific quantiles. Given that schools\nand census block groups are not geographically nested,\nwe did not use multilevel analysis. Furthermore, multi-\nlevel analysis of unbalanced sparse data within census\nblock groups can result in biased estimates.39\nTo aid interpretation of the model results, we used the\nestimated model coefficients to predict food resource\navailability across levels of neighbourhood-level poverty\nand minority population within the low-density urban\nstratum, where the strongest disparities were observed.\nComparative analyses\nIn order to assess whether different neighbourhood\nbuffer sizes were needed in urban versus non-urban\nareas, we compared and found similar patterns for the\n1 km buffer in urban areas and the 8 km buffer in non-\nurban areas. In addition, we assessed alternate measures\nof food resource availability to compare our main\nmeasure findings with commonly used though concep-\ntually different metrics: count per population2 and\ndistance to nearest outlet.4 14 40 Specifically, we\ncontrasted our roadway-scaled measure with: (1) density\nEuclidean buffer and (2) minimum distance to the\nsingle nearest food resource within 8 km Euclidean\nbuffer. We repeated identical multivariable regression\nmodels with alternate measures, except models with\npopulation-scaled measures did not control for popula-\ntion density. Results for food resources per 100 km of\nroadway within a 3 km network buffer are presented in\ntext, while results for all other measures are shown in\nonline appendices B and C.\nRESULTS\nNeighbourhood availability of grocery/supermarkets,\nconvenience stores and fast-food restaurants varied\ndramatically across non-urban, low-density urban and\nhigh-density urban areas, with greater availability in\nhigh-density urban areas (table 2).\nIn multivariable analysis, availability of grocery/\nsupermarkets and convenience stores for low-density\nurban residents did not differ according to neighbour-\nhood poverty; rather, lower availability of food stores was\nobserved with greater minority populations (table 3).\nFood stores were more equitably allocated in non-urban\nneighbourhoods. Interestingly, greater availability of\nfood stores was often found in high-density urban areas\nwith high proportions of low-income residents, but this\nrelationship with neighbourhood income did not hold\nin neighbourhoods with high proportion of minority\nresidents.\nFast-food availability was greater for residents in high-\npoverty neighbourhoods, with strongest associations in\nlow- and high-density urban areas (table 3). Among\nthose living in neighbourhoods with high poverty,\ngreater minority population incurred additional\ninequities in food resource availability, particularly in\nlow-density urban areas. In a notable exception, in high-\ndensity urban, high-minority areas, fast food was less\navailable in high-poverty neighbourhoods.\nFigure 1 presents predicted food resource availability\n(based on the table 3 models) and more clearly illus-\ntrates the differential associations with poverty versus\nrace/ethnicity in non-urban, low-density urban and\nhigh-density urban areas.\nIn general, estimated patterns of disparities were very\nsimilar between roadway-scaled, population density and\ndistance measures (online appendices B and C).\nDISCUSSION\nWe assessed inequities in grocery/supermarket, conve-\nnience store and fast-food restaurant availability by\nneighbourhood poverty and minority population in\na large diverse national sample of residential neigh-\nbourhoods of young adults, representing 7588 census\nOur findings suggest that inequities in neighbourhood\nfood resource availability do exist, but not always where\nprior research suggests.

In the USA, we also note\nthat the distribution of poverty has shifted away from the\ndense inner cities. Data from the 2010 census suggest\nthat counter to the assumption of `White Flight' out of\ninner cities, racial minorities, foreign-born and low-\nincome people were more likely to live in metropolitan\nsuburbs in 2010 than the cities they lived in during\nneighbourhood food resource availability observed in\nlow-density urban areas in our 2001 data may become\nmuch more important as poor and minority populations\nincreasingly reside in suburban neighbourhoods. Our\nfindings suggest that in addition to increasing grocery\nstore availability and limiting fast-food availability in\ndisadvantaged dense urban areas, rural and suburban\nareas should be targeted for food environment\nimprovements. While this idea has been suggested by\na series of studies in rural Texas,20 our national study\nfurther supports more focus on rural and suburban food\nenvironments.\nRelationships between food resource availability,\nneighbourhood poverty and minority population were\nnotably distinct in high-density urban areas. It is possible\nthat fewer significant findings in high-density urban\nareas might reflect lower statistical power due to smaller\nurban block groups) or greater variability in high-density\nurban relative to other areas. Yet, the pattern of findings\nsuggests variation across the spectrum of urbanicity.\nFirst, our finding of greater availability of grocery stores\nTable 2 Means (SD) of food resources* (count per 100 km secondary and local road within 3 km network buffer around each\nneighborhood povertyx { and minority populationx **\nNeighbourhood\nN\nGrocery/\nsupermarket\nConvenience\nstores Fast food\nPer cent povertyx {\nwithin 3 km\nPer cent minority\npopulationx ** within 3 km\nNon-urban\nLow-density urban\nHigh-density urban\n*See online appendix A for Standard Industrial Classification codes for grocery/supermarkets, convenience stores and fast food.\nyMeans (SD) corrected for clustering and weighted for representation.\nzNon-urban: distance to urbanised area (UA) >0; low-density urban: distance to UA\u00bc0 and % developed land cover, excluding water and ice\n(land developed) #95%; high-density urban: distance to UA\u00bc0 and % land developed >95%.\nxCensus block group.\n{Greater than 20% of population below the federal poverty level.\nAre neighbourhood food resources distributed inequitably in the USA?\ngroup.bmj.com\nbmjopen.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nTable 3 Associations between high neighbourhood poverty* and urbanicity-specific minority compositiony and high neighbourhood and food resourcez availability (b\nFood resource (count per\nroad within 3 km network\nbuffer)\nNeighbourhood Non-urban Low-density urban High-density urban\nPer cent poverty* **\nwithin 3 km\nPer cent minority\npopulationy **\nwithin 3 km b coefficient (95% CI) b coefficient (95% CI) b coefficient (95% CI)\nConvenience store Low Low 0 0 0\n*Greater than 20% of population below the federal poverty level.\nzSee online appendix A for Standard Industrial Classification codes for grocery/supermarkets, convenience stores and fast food.\nxLinear regression models, controlling for per cent college educate and population density.\n{Non-urban: distance to urbanised area (UA) >0; low-density urban: distance to UA\u00bc0 and % developed land cover, excluding water and ice (land developed) #95%; high-density urban: distance to\nUA\u00bc0 and % land developed >95%.\n**Census block group.\nyyStatistically different (a\u00bc0.05) than low-minority population, within poverty status stratum.\nzzStatistically different (a\u00bc0.05) than low-poverty status, within minority population stratum.\nAre neighbourhood food resources distributed inequitably in the USA?\ngroup.bmj.com\nbmjopen.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nand convenience stores in high- versus low-poverty areas,\nbut only in areas with predominately white populations,\nsuggests the presence of complex economic and social\ndrivers in where food stores choose to locate. Second,\nfast-food availability was generally greater in high-\npoverty, high-minority areas, but this was not true in\nhigh-minority, high-density urban areas. This finding is\nconsistent with prior evidence11 47 that perceived or real\nracial tensions or safety concerns may also influence\nopening and closure of food establishments.\nFindings using our main roadway-scaled measures and\npopulation density measures were nearly identical as they\nlikely capture resources scaled by commercialisation and\ndevelopment indicated by population and roadways.\nSlight inconsistencies in results for the minimum distance\nmeasures may reflect greater variation that results from\nusing a single data point (nearest outlet) to characterise\navailability compared with incorporating data from\nmultiple food resources within an area. Minimum\ndistance measures also do not account for differential\ndistribution of food resources according to the popula-\ntion and development density.\nStrengths and limitations\nThis study did not look at extreme poverty nor consider\na large array of other factors linked with urbanicity. It is\npossible that disparities in food resources in dense urban\nareas may be evident only under extreme neighbour-\nhood poverty that we did not examine in our analysis.\nMore refined analyses of dynamic effects among social\nand economic environments and food resources are\nbeyond the scope of the present analysis, though they\ncertainly warrant further attention. Moreover, other\nproximity to other resources47 could also relate to actual\nor perceived access to food resources.\nThe benefit of business record data, which provides\ncomparative national food resource data, must be\nbalanced with their limitations. Business record\ndata contain error, which can bias results either towards\nthe null if misclassification is non-differential or away\nfrom the null in the case of differential misclassification.\nIt is also possible that the accuracy of business records\nvaries by area socio-demographics and/or urban-\nicity.49e53 Neighbourhood audits (street-by-street data\ncollection by researchers) better capture broader\ndimensions of food access, such as food prices or\ncultural preferences, but they are not feasible for large\nnational samples across thousands of census blocks\ngroups. These intense audits are generally performed in\nsmaller geographic areas and thus preclude broad\ncomparisons across neighbourhood type and socio-\ndemographics. We were unable to ascertain food sold at\neach establishment and relied on generalisations\nregarding healthy (grocery/supermarket) versus\nunhealthy (convenience store, fast-food restaurant)\ntypes of establishments.\nAlthough supercentres have recently gained a signifi-\ncant share of the food retailing market, during the\ncontemporaneous study period, supercentres held only\nLow\npoverty\nHigh\npoverty\nLow\npoverty\nHigh\npoverty\nLow\npoverty\nHigh\npoverty\nNon-urban Low density\nurban\nHigh density\nurban\nGrocery/supermarket\nsecondary/local\nroadway\nLow\npoverty\nHigh\npoverty\nLow\npoverty\nHigh\npoverty\nLow\npoverty\nHigh\npoverty\nNon-urban Low density urban High density\nurban\nConvenience store\nLow\npoverty\nHigh\npoverty\nLow\npoverty\nHigh\npoverty\nLow\npoverty\nHigh\npoverty\nNon-urban Low density\nurban\nHigh density\nurban\nFast food restaurant\nLow minority\nHigh minority\nFigure 1 Predicted neighbourhood food resource availability (count per 10 000 population) for various neighbourhood poverty*\nand minority populationy levelsz. *Greater than 20% of population below the federal poverty level. yPer cent non-Hispanic White\nzNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health Wave III (young adulthood: 2001e2002), corrected for clustering and weighted\nfor representation.

For these reasons, supercentres\nwere not addressed.\nFurthermore, due to lower participation of illegal\nimmigrants in the census, the US census data may\nunderestimate neighbourhood minority population and\npoverty. Our 3 km network residential neighbourhood\nbuffer may not accurately reflect food purchasing areas\nfor different urban settings and socio-demographic\nsubgroups; this is a topic worthy for future study. In\naddition, this is a cross-sectional study and thus does not\ncapture changes in food environments over time.\nDespite these limitations, our study is an essential step\nin understanding the allocation of theoretically healthy\nand less healthy food resources across social and\ngeographic space over the entire USA, and our findings\ncan inform measurement and design in future individual-\nlevel and longitudinal studies. Our study benefits from\nthe variation in neighbourhoods of a large population\nthat enables comparisons across multiple socio-demo-\ngraphic and urban strata within a single study. Further-\nmore, our study capitalises upon national data with\nroadway-scaled measures of neighbourhood food\nresource availability within 3 km residential network\nbuffers for each observation. In addition, we used detailed\nmeasures of urbanicity derived both from the US census\nand land cover data allowing a more refined urban/rural\nclassification than the traditional urban/rural dichotomy.\nIn sum, our study benefits from several innovations and\ndepth of coverage that has been heretofore unaddressed\nin a large geographically diverse study.\nPolicy implications\nMany state and national efforts focus on providing\nhealthy eating options for poor inner-city neighbour-\nhoods, many with high-minority populations. Strategies\ninclude providing produce carts in low-income neigh-\nbourhoods in New York City,55 directly or indirectly\nsubsidising supermarkets,56e59 banning fast-food restau-\nrant construction in selected urban areas,60 as well as\nlegislation considered at the national level.61 Our results\nsuggest that less urban areas might benefit from similar\npolicies.\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that common assumptions\nregarding income and race/ethnic subpopulation\ndisparities in food resources may not be universally true\nacross the spectrum of urbanicity. We observed an asso-\nciation between greater neighbourhood poverty and\nminority population with greater availability of fast-food\nrestaurants in urban areas. Conversely, disparities\nin grocery/supermarkets were primarily observed in\nlow-density urban areas. Our findings suggest that\npoverty and race may play distinct roles in how food\nresources are allocated and that underlying social\ncomplexities should be further explored in dense urban,\nsuburban and rural areas.\n"
