These threats have\ntwo purposes. The purpose of direct deterrence is to deter a direct attack on\nthe defender. The goal of extended deterrence, conversely, is to deter attack\ntwo basic kinds of deterrence situations: immediate and general. Immediate\ndeterrence \"concerns the relationship between opposing states where at\nleast one side is seriously considering an attack while the other is mounting\na threat of retaliation in order to prevent it\" (Morgan 1983:30). Classic\nA previous version of this paper was presented at the 2002 annual meeting of the Peace Science Society,\nTucson, AZ. I would like to thank Frank Zagare, Paul Senese, Paul Hensel, Sara Mitchell, Pat James, and\nJerome Venteicher for helpful comments and suggestions.\nAddress correspondence to Stephen L.

General deterrence, by contrast,\n\"relates to opponents who maintain armed forces to regulate their relationship\neven though neither is anywhere near mounting an attack\" (Morgan 1983:30).\nThus, general deterrence has less to do with \"crisis decisionmaking\" than\nwith everyday decisionmaking in conflictual or adversarial relationships.\nHuth (1988) combines these two kinds of deterrence situations with\nthe two types of deterrent threats to form four categories of deterrence:\ndirect-immediate deterrence, direct-general deterrence, extended-immediate\ndeterrence, and extended-general deterrence. Unlike many other works on\ndeterrence, this paper focuses on direct-general deterrence.\nThe need for immediate deterrence indicates that general deterrence\nhas previously failed (Danilovic 2001). If general deterrence succeeds, crises\nand wars do not occur. Since general deterrence necessarily precedes\nimmediate deterrence, the analysis of general deterrence is more fundamental\nto an understanding of international conflict than is an analysis of immediate\ndeterrence. Furthermore, because of selection effects, examining immediate\ndeterrence without consideration of general deterrence can lead to mislead-\ning empirical results. As Fearon (2002:15) observes, \"hypotheses that are\nvalid for general deterrence should appear exactly reversed if we look at\ncases of immediate deterrence.\"\nUnfortunately, a divide exists between formal theories and the empiri-\ncal analysis of deterrence. One reason for this divide is that while formal\ntheories have focused on general deterrence, the quantitative literature has\nfocused almost exclusively on immediate deterrence (Huth 1999). Important\nexceptions include Weede (1983), who examined extended deterrence in\nthe cold war, and Sorokin (1994), who examined the impact of alliance for-\nmation on extended general deterrence within the Arab\u00adIsraeli conflict.\nGiven their focus on extended deterrence, these studies are unable to pro-\nvide insight on direct general deterrence. Huth and Russett (1993) did\nexamine direct general deterrence within the context of enduring rivalries.\nThey find that the balance of forces, arms races, and domestic conflict are\nall important determinants of deterrence outcomes. However, they do not\ndirectly test any specific theory of deterrence; indeed, formal theories of\ngeneral deterrence have never been subjected to direct empirical testing.\nIndeed, this problem has unfortunately plagued formal theories through-\nout political science (Green and Shapiro 1994), not only in the study of\ndeterrence. This is unfortunate since deterrence theory appears to shed\ngreat light on the dynamics of deterrence, yet without extensive empirical\nanalysis, one cannot know how well these theories explain real-world phe-\nnomena. One reason for this lack of testing is that, while selection of imme-\ndiate deterrence cases has received a great deal of attention (for example,\ngeneral deterrence cases have remained elusive.\n62 S. L. Quackenbush\nThis paper has two related purposes. The specific purpose is to fill this\nevidentiary gap by subjecting perfect deterrence theory--a recently devel-\noped theory of general deterrence--to a systematic test. I do so for several\nreasons. First, perfect deterrence theory (Zagare and Kilgour 2000) is sup-\nported by a formal logic with explicit theoretical expectations that facilitates\nempirical testing. Second, several preliminary tests of perfect deterrence\ntheory have rendered promising, albeit provisional results (Senese and\n(1999) points out, standard formulations of deterrence--to the extent that\nthey have been explored empirically--are without compelling support.\nThe more general purpose is to develop the conceptualization and pro-\ncedures to make such a test possible. This is necessary to bridge the divide\nbetween formal theories and quantitative analyses of deterrence. Key con-\nceptualizations include case selection for direct general deterrence--I argue\nthat identifying opportunity for conflict is the key. In addition, this paper\noffers the first direct test of incomplete information equilibrium predictions\nmade by formal deterrence theory. Conducting such a test requires mea-\nsurement of the utilities the actors have for the different outcomes that may\nemerge, so a modification of the measurement procedures developed by\nBueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992) is used. Also, since incomplete infor-\nmation equilibria depend on each state's estimate of the opponent's credi-\nbility, a nonlinear transformation technique is developed to estimate the\ncredibility parameters.\nTo test perfect deterrence theory, I examine general deterrence from\ntheory's unilateral deterrence game, I more fully discuss the research design\nused to test them, including case selection, measurement of variables, and\nstatistical method. In the next section, I discuss the empirical results and the\ntheory's ability to explain general deterrence and international conflict. The\nresults indicate that perfect deterrence theory is well supported by the\nempirical record. Finally, I compare these findings to previous results sup-\nporting Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman's (1992) international interaction\ngame that is the basis of one of the most influential and important theories\nof interstate conflict.\nPerfect deterrence theory is an axiomatically distinct theoretical alternative\nto classical deterrence theory, which focuses on ideas such as brinkmanship\n1In addition, Danilovic's (2002) empirical findings are consistent with the theory.\n  63\nfocus on testing equilibrium predictions of the Unilateral Deterrence Game\ndeveloped by Zagare and Kilgour (2000: chapter 5).2 Furthermore, unlike\nmost previous tests of game-theoretic models, I focus on incomplete infor-\nmation conditions, since incomplete information is an important factor lead-\nFigure 1 shows the structure of this game, which has two players,\nChallenger and Defender. At node 1, Challenger can choose whether to\ncooperate or defect: if he cooperates, the Status Quo remains unchanged; if\nhe defects, Defender has an opportunity to respond. At node 2, Defender\ncan choose whether to concede or defy. If she concedes, the outcome is\nDefender Concedes (DC), but if she defies, the next choice is Challenger's.\nAt node 3, Challenger can choose to concede, resulting in Challenger\nDefeated (CD), or defy, resulting in Conflict (DD).\nChallenger's utilities for outcome x are cx\n, whereas Defender's utilities\nare dx\n, as indicated in Figure 1. Perfect deterrence theory highlights the\n2Perfect deterrence theory relies on three core models: the Unilateral Deterrence Game, the Generalized\nMutual Deterrence Game, and the Asymmetric Escalation Game (Zagare and Kilgour 2000). The latter\ngame focuses on situations of extended deterrence, and is therefore inappropriate for the current focus\non direct deterrence. Furthermore, the unilateral deterrence game, unlike the mutual deterrence game,\nallows for differentiation between states within a dyadic relationship. Accordingly, I focus on testing\nequilibrium predictions of the Unilateral Deterrence Game\nFIGURE 1 Unilateral deterrence game. Challenger defects initially with probability x.

L. Quackenbush\nimportance of two variables: capability and credibility. A state's threat is\ncapable if the threatened party believes that it would be worse off if the\nthreat were carried out than if it were not. For example, if Defender has a\ncapable threat, then Challenger prefers Status Quo to Conflict.\nCredible threats are believable, and in order to be believable, they must\nbe rational to carry out (Zagare 1990). Therefore, a state that prefers conflict\nto backing down has a credible threat, and is said to be \"Hard.\" On the\nother hand, a state that would rather back down than fight has an incredible\nthreat, and is said to be \"Soft.\"\nZagare and Kilgour (2000) provide complete solutions and discussion of the\nUnilateral Deterrence Game. The equilibria are presented briefly in the\nappendix, as is an original analysis of the situation where Defender's threat\nis not capable. These equilibria are the basic predictions of perfect deterrence\ntheory to be tested. However, one cannot observe directly what equilibrium\nis present at any one time; only the outcome can be observed. Therefore,\nthe equilibria must be further explicated to generate specific outcome pre-\ndictions for the wide variety of conditions that may exist in reality. Three\nsituations may arise, each generating different predictions.\nThe first condition that may exist is where Challenger prefers the Status\nQuo to Defender Concedes. Given no incentive to defect, Challenger will\nalways cooperate, leading to the Status Quo. Secondly, if Challenger prefers\nConflict to the Status Quo, then Defender lacks a capable threat. The solution\npresented in the appendix shows that in this case the outcome is Conflict if\nDefender is Hard, and if Defender is Soft the outcome is Defender Concedes.\nLastly, the most complicated scenario is when Challenger prefers\nDefender Concedes to Status Quo and Defender has a capable threat. In this\ncase, only Certain Deterrence Equilibria make a unique outcome prediction\n(Status Quo) over their entire range of existence. Multiple outcomes emerge\nat intermediate (Separating Equilibrium) and low (Bluff and Attack Equilibria)\nlevels of Defender credibility.\nUnder a Separating Equilibrium, the player choices are completely\ndetermined by their type. Therefore, Hard Challengers always defect at\nnode 1. A Hard Defender also always defies, so if both players are Hard, the\noutcome is Conflict. However, a Soft Defender always concedes, so the out-\ncome (with a Hard Challenger) is Defender Concedes. But if Challenger is\nSoft, he will always cooperate, resulting in Status Quo.\nWith an Attack Equilibrium, Challenger always defects initially, regard-\nless of type. Therefore, the outcome reached is largely determined by\nDefender's type. If Defender is Hard, she will defy and the outcome is Conflict\nif Challenger is Hard as well. But in the unlikely event that a Soft Challenger\n  65\nfaces a Hard Defender, then the outcome is Challenger Defeated. A Soft\nDefender always concedes, so the outcome is Defender Concedes.\nUnfortunately, the Bluff Equilibrium does not provide unique outcome\npredictions for each pair of player types like the other equilibria do. A Hard\nChallenger always defects, as does a Hard Defender. Therefore, Conflict\nresults if both players are Hard. However, a Soft Defender defies with some\npositive probability, so the outcome (with a Hard Challenger) will be either\nDefender Concedes (if Defender concedes) or Conflict (if Defender defies).\nA Soft Challenger also defects with some positive probability. So if a Soft\nChallenger faces a Hard Defender, the outcome will be either Status Quo (if\nChallenger cooperates) or Challenger Defeated (if Challenger defects ini-\ntially). If both players are Soft almost anything can happen. If Challenger\ndefects initially and Defender concedes, the outcome is Defender Concedes.\nBut if Defender surprises Challenger by defying at node 2, then the out-\ncome is Challenger Defeated.3 Finally, if Challenger cooperates, the out-\ncome is Status Quo.\nOne additional equilibrium--Steadfast Deterrence Equilibrium--exists.\nAs with the Certain Deterrence Equilibrium, Status Quo is the only possible\noutcome. However, this equilibrium exists at intermediate and low values of\nDefender credibility, and thus coexists with equilibria of other types. Therefore,\nthrough the Steadfast Deterrence Equilibrium, perfect deterrence theory pre-\ndicts that the Status Quo is always possible as long as Defender's threat is\ncapable. Thus, Zagare and Kilgour's (2000:149) claim that successful \"deter-\nrence could conceivably emerge under (almost) any conditions in a one-sided\ndeterrence relationship.\"\nThese three basic conditions--1) where Challenger prefers Status Quo to\nDefender Concedes, 2) where Defender lacks a capable threat, and 3) where\nDefender's threat is capable--cover the entire range of possibilities. The out-\ncome predictions for each scenario are summarized in Table 1 and serve as\nthe equilibrium predictions to be tested in the empirical analysis to follow.\nWith the equilibrium outcome predictions now made, I turn to a presentation\nof the research design used to test these predictions. I will discuss the selec-\ntion of cases, measurement of the dependent and independent variables,\nand the statistical method used in turn. The lack of quantitative testing of\nformal deterrence theory has been driven in large part by the difficulties\npresented by these issues. These conceptualizations are crucial not only for\nthe specific task of testing perfect deterrence theory but also the more\n3Since Challenger is Soft, he will always concede at node 3.\n66 S. L. Quackenbush\ngeneral task of making such tests possible and thereby somewhat bridging\nthe divide between formal theories and quantitative analysis of deterrence.\nCase Selection\nCase selection has been the biggest obstacle to the empirical analysis of\ngeneral deterrence (Huth 1999). The only previous quantitative study focus-\ning on direct general deterrence is by Huth and Russett (1993:63, emphasis\nadded), who argue that \"the population of enduring rivalries in the interna-\ntional system includes all dyadic relations in which a dispute created the\npossibility of one or both parties resorting to overt military force to achieve\na gain or redress a grievance.\" According to this line of reasoning, then,\nenduring rivalries are the proper cases for the study of general deterrence.\nSimilarly, Diehl and Goertz focus attention on rivalries, whether or not they\nbecome enduring, and argue that \"the rivalry approach provides a solution\"\n(Diehl and Goertz 2000:91) to problems with deterrence case selection.\nAccording to Diehl and Goertz (2000), a dyad is in a rivalry if they\nengage in a militarized interstate dispute. Thus, selecting all rivalries as\ncases of general deterrence would capture (by definition) all failures of\nTABLE 1 Equilibrium Outcome Predictions for the Unilateral Deterrence Game with Incom-\nplete Information\nExistence conditions\nRestrictions on\nchallenger\nRestrictions\non defender Predicted outcome\n> cDC\n\u00ad \u00ad Status Quo\n> cSQ\n\u00ad dDD\n> dDC\nConflict\n\u00ad dDC\n> dDD\nDefender Concedes\n> cSQ\nand cSQ\n> cDD\nCertain Deterrence Equilibrium\npDef\n\u00ad \u00ad Status Quo\nSeparating Equilibrium\n> cCD\n> dDC\nStatus Quo, Conflict\ncs\n\u00a3 pDef\n\u00a3 ct\n> dDD\nStatus Quo, Defender Concedes\n> cDD\n\u00ad Status Quo\nBluff Equilibrium\n> cCD\n> dDC\nStatus Quo, Conflict\npDef\n< cs\nand pCh\n\u00a3 dn\n> dDD\nStatus Quo, Defender Concedes,\nConflict\n> cDD\n> dDC\nStatus Quo, Challenger Defeated\n> dDD\nStatus Quo, Defender Concedes,\nChallenger Defeated\nAttack Equilibrium\npDef\n< cs\nand pCh\n> cCD dDD\n> dDC\nStatus Quo, Conflict\n> cDD\nStatus Quo, Challenger Defeated\n\u00ad dDC\n> dDD\nStatus Quo, Defender Concedes\nNote: For definitions of threshold parameters ct\n, cs\n, and dn\n, see the appendix.\n  67\ngeneral deterrence.4 However, deterrence in dyads that have not fought\nwould be ignored, which is particularly problematic because those are the\ndyads where deterrence has always worked. Furthermore, identification of\nthe length of a rivalry, and thus the span of general deterrence, requires the\nassumption that the rivalry begins either with the first dispute (and thus\ndeterrence failed when it was attempted for the first time), or at some arbi-\ntrary length of time before the first dispute and after the last.5\nTherefore, the rivalry approach is limited as a path to general deterrence\ncase selection. However, one can safely assume that every state wishes to\ndeter attacks against itself--this is the basic rationale for the maintenance of\narmed forces (Morgan 1983). This assumption is equivalent to the alliance\nportfolio literature's assumption that every state has a defense pact with itself\npart of general deterrence case selection is not determining who makes deter-\nrent threats (everyone does), but rather what states the threats are directed\nagainst. General deterrent threats are directed against any state that might\nconsider an attack; these are states that have the opportunity for conflict.\nThus, the key to selecting cases of general deterrence is identifying\nopportunity for conflict.7 To identify cases where opportunity exists, I\nuse the recently developed concept of politically active dyads (Quacken-\nbush 2006a). A dyad is politically active \"if at least one of the following\ncharacteristics applies: the members of the dyad are contiguous, either\ndirectly or through a colony, one of the dyad members is a global\npower, one of the dyad members is a regional power in the region of\nthe other, one of the dyad members is allied to a state that is contiguous\nto the other, one of the dyad members is allied to a global power that is\nin a dispute with the other, or one of the dyad members is allied to a\nregional power (in the region of the other) that is in a dispute with the\ncally active dyads are able to identify opportunity as a necessary condi-\ntion for international conflict, while previous measures of opportunity\n4This is, of course, classifying militarized interstate disputes as general deterrence failures.\n5This length of time could be assumed to be 10 years, for example. Thus, if two states last disputed in\n6In other words, every state threatens to respond if attacked, even though it may not actually carry out\nthe threat if attacked (just as defense pacts are not always honored when tested).\n7Thus, I argue that even \"friendly\" dyads, such as the United States and Canada, use general deterrence\nto regulate their relationship. Each has an incentive to prevent the other from challenging the status quo;\nindeed, deterrence has failed between the United States and Canada six times since 1974. Furthermore,\nsince identifying opportunity for conflict is the key to general deterrence case selection, some may con-\nclude that any study that uses politically relevant dyads (or politically active dyads) is an examination of\ngeneral deterrence. While there is some merit to that view, most studies of international conflict do not\nhave the same focus on the credibility and capability of threats that deterrence theory does, so such a\nblanket statement is not necessarily valid.\n68 S. L. Quackenbush\nsuch as politically relevant dyads and regional dyads are unable to do\nso. Thus, we can have confidence that all politically active dyads could\nfight if they had the willingness to do so. The goal of deterrence is to\ndissuade other states from attacking the deterring state. In other words,\nstates seek to ensure that other states--those with the opportunity to\nattack--do not gain the willingness to attack, and they do this through\ndeterrence. While other empirically verified causes of war certainly\nimpact deterrence outcomes, opportunity is the key to general deter-\nrence case selection.\nSome readers might be concerned that there is no attempt to determine\nwhether the challenger actually intends to attack, and thus, whether the lack\nof an attack can meaningfully be considered general deterrence success.\nThis issue does not actually pose a problem for the analysis here. The pre-\ndictions being tested, from Table 1, are about particular game outcomes, not\na dichotomous measure of deterrence \"success\" and \"failure.\" Furthermore,\nthese predictions explicitly cover the case where the challenger has abso-\nlutely no interest in attacking. While the three non-status quo outcomes are\nessentially different categories of general deterrence failure, the status quo\noutcome is not necessarily the result of successful deterrence. For example,\nif Challenger prefers Status Quo to Defender Concedes, the only rational\noutcome is Status Quo. Although Challenger's decision to not challenge the\nstatus quo in this case is not really \"successful deterrence,\" it is predicted by\nperfect deterrence theory.\nFor the cases that are selected (because they are politically active), I\nemploy a directed-dyad-year unit of analysis. Within a directed dyad, the\ndirection of interaction is important; for example, United StatesJapan is\none directed dyad and JapanUnited States is another. The Unilateral\nDeterrence Game theoretically differentiates between the roles played by\neach state in a dyad, so employing directed-dyads enables empirical differ-\nentiation between the states in a dyad as well. Furthermore, since each state\nin a politically active dyad has the opportunity for conflict with the other,\neach state has an opportunity to challenge the status quo. Therefore, each\nstate is considered to be a potential challenger. For example, in the United\nStatesJapan directed dyad, the United States is Challenger and Japan is\nDefender, while in the JapanUnited States directed dyad, Japan is Chal-\nlenger and the United States is Defender.\nBecause most international relations data are based on annual\nobservations, the year is the time period used for the cross-sectional\ntime series data analysis conducted here. Therefore, each politically\nactive directed-dyad-year constitutes an observation. Since general deter-\nrence deals with the outbreak, rather than the continuation, of interna-\ntional conflict, I eliminate dyad-years marked by a conflict continuing\nfrom the previous year as well as `joiner' dyads. Furthermore, I drop the\ndirected dyad BA in years with a continuing conflict in the directed\n  69\ndyad AB.8 This results in a total of 384,865 politically active directed-\nDependent Variable\nThe dependent variable for this analysis codes which outcome--Status Quo,\nDefender Concedes, Conflict, or Challenger Defeated--of the Unilateral Deter-\nrence Game occurred for each observation. These game outcomes are\ndetermined by using version 3 of the militarized interstate dispute (MID)\ndata set (Ghosn, Palmer, and Bremer 2004). If no dispute was initiated for a\ngiven directed dyad year, the deterrence outcome is coded as Status Quo.\nThe coding of the other deterrence outcomes is not as straightforward,\nbut it is possible by utilizing information from both the outcome and the\nhostility level of the MID data set. The outcome variable of the MID data\ncategorizes whether the outcome of a dispute is victory, yield, stalemate,\ncompromise, released, unclear, or joins ongoing war. More information is\nneeded, however, in order to capture the deterrence outcome rather than\njust the dispute outcome. This additional information is provided by the\nhostility level of each state in a MID, which is coded using a five-point\nscale. The hostility level indicates whether no militarized action was taken\nby that state, a threat to use force was made, a display of force, an actual\nuse of force, or war.\nDispute initiation is equated to Challenger's defection at node 1 of the\nunilateral deterrence game. However, to determine what outcome--Defender\nConcedes, Challenger Defeated, or Conflict--is reached following Challenger's\ninitial defection, it must be determined which player, if any, conceded. Unfor-\ntunately, the MID data do not indicate the sequence of events within a dis-\npute. Nonetheless, the outcome and the hostility level variables can be used\nto determine what game outcome best corresponds to each dispute.\nIf both sides use force, or the outcome is \"joins ongoing war,\" the\ngame outcome is coded Conflict. If mutual use of force did not occur, then\na \"victory by A\" or \"yield by B\" is coded as Defender Concedes, whereas a\n\"victory by B,\" a \"yield by A,\" or a \"released\" outcome is coded as Chal-\nlenger Defeated.10 If there was no mutual use of force and the outcome was\n\"unclear,\" \"stalemate,\" or \"compromise,\" then I compare hostility levels to\ndetermine the outcome.\n8For detailed discussions of directed-dyads and joiners, see Bennett and Stam (2000c).\n9Because of missing data, the number of observations actually used in the analyses is reduced further.\nEUGene, version 3.1 (Bennett and Stam 2000a) was used to construct the data set.\n10The released outcome is \"identified whenever the seizure of material or personnel culminates with\ntheir release from captivity\" (Jones, Bremer, and Singer 1996:180). In game terms, Challenger backed\ndown in the end. Analyses (not reported here) reveal no significant differences between dropping\nreleased cases or including them.\n70 S. L. Quackenbush\nIf one state escalates to a higher hostility level than the other, it is rea-\nsonable to infer that the other state has conceded at some point rather than\nto defy by continuing to escalate.11 Thus, if Defender's highest hostility level\nis lower than Challenger's, then the outcome is Defender Concedes. But if\nDefender escalates to a higher hostility level, the outcome is Challenger\nDefeated. Finally, if both states escalate to the same hostility level, the outcome\nis coded Conflict.\nVariables for the individual outcomes are combined into a single cate-\ngorical variable. The resulting variable, called game outcome, is the dependent\nvariable for the analyses to follow.\nIndependent Variables\nIn order to test the predictions summarized in Table 1 for each observation,\nplayer types and credibilities must be measured. This requires measurement\nof the utility that each player has for the various outcomes in each dyad\nyear, a quite difficult task. Indeed, it has never been done with respect to\ndeterrence theory.\nThe utilities for each outcome of a deterrence situation can be specified\nin terms of the costs and benefits of that outcome. For the two outcomes\nfollowing a concession--Defender Concedes and Challenger Defeated--the\nutility comes from the size of concession and the cost associated with that\noutcome.12 The utility for Conflict is a lottery between receiving one's\ndemand and conceding the stakes to the other player, weighted by the\nprobability of victory.13\nFollowing this logic, each player's utility for each outcome can be\nexpressed in mathematical form. Accordingly, Challenger's utility for each\noutcome is operationalized as\n11Similar game outcome coding procedures have been employed by Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman\n12Following Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992:43), I assume that the cost of conceding \"after absorb-\ning a first-strike blow is larger, the greater the power of the rival:\" gx\n).\n13I assume that domestic costs (fx\npx\n) rise with the subjective probability of victory, since \"the more\npowerful participant in a dyadic relationship bears a greater burden for finding a peaceful resolution of\ndifferences. Domestic populations are assumed to dislike bullying and to punish those who employ vio-\nlence if their power should have made them persuasive enough to resolve their disputes without it\"\ncSQ c\nu SQ\ncDC c c c c\nu p\n= -\n( )\n  71\nand Defender's utilities are operationalized similarly, where \nx\nis the size of\nthe demand made by state x, px\nis the probability x wins, fx\nis the domestic\npolitical cost associated with the use of force by x, gx\nis the cost borne by x\nupon giving in, and wx\nis the cost borne by x in a conflict.14\nBueno de Mesquita (1975) developed a technique to measure state's\nutilities based on their portfolios of alliance commitments. This technique\nhas been refined over time, and the procedures outlined by Bueno de Mesquita\nand Lalman (1992: appendix 1) serve as the baseline for the measurement of\nthe individual components of equations 1 through 4 used here. States' utili-\nties are measured using the similarity of foreign policy portfolios and risk\nattitudes (Bueno de Mesquita 1985). The probabilities of victory are esti-\nmated using relative power and estimates of the likelihood of intervention\nby third parties.15 In addition, several important changes have been made to\ntheir procedures; details of these changes are provided in the appendix,\nalong with an explanation of the nonlinear method developed to measure\neach state's credibility parameter.\nOnce the utilities, credibility parameters (pDef\nand pCh\n), and threshold\nvalues (ct\n, cs\n, and dn\n) are measured, the equilibrium outcome predictions\nfor each politically active directed dyad-year are made according to the cri-\nteria specified in Table 1. This results in four dummy variables: predicted\nStatus Quo, predicted Defender Concedes, predicted Challenger Defeated,\nand predicted Conflict. Each of these variables equals 1 if the corresponding\noutcome is predicted in equilibrium for the current observation, and 0\notherwise.\nSince not all of the outcome predictions in Table 1 are unique, these\nvariables are not mutually exclusive. That is, a value of \"1\" for predicted\nStatus Quo does not indicate that each of the other variables equals \"0.\" For\nthose observations where multiple outcomes are predicted in equilibrium,\nthe variable for each predicted outcome takes the value \"1.\" Therefore, each\nof these four variables will be included in the multinomial logit models;\n14These utilities for the various outcomes are equivalent to the utilities of some of the outcomes specified\nby Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992). Specifically, cSQ\n= UA(SQ), cDC\n= UA(CapB\n), cCD\n= UA(CapA\n),\nand cDD\n= UA(WarA\n). The only exception is that no distinction is made here between the costs borne by\nthe attacker and target in a conflict--they are assumed to be equal (w). Although Bueno de Mesquita and\nLalman distinguished between the two cost terms theoretically, in their empirical testing the cost terms\nwere assumed to be the same (a = t).\n15Complete details of the measurement procedures are provided by Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman\ncomponents drawn directly from Bennett and Stam's EUGene software.\ncCD c d c c\nu p\n= - -\n[ ( )]\ncDD c c c c c c c c c d c c c c\np u p p p u p p\n= - - - + - - - -\n[ ( ( ))] ( )[ ( ( ))]\n \nf w f w\n72 S. L. Quackenbush\ntogether, they serve as the primary independent variables for the prediction\nof game outcomes.\nCONTROLS\nThese independent variables constitute the equilibrium outcome predictions\nof perfect deterrence theory. However, a number of alternative explanations\nof international behavior exist. Therefore, several control variables, repre-\nsenting the major foci of recent conflict studies, are used to test the robust-\nness of the results obtained. Some of these variables (particularly relative\npower and S score) are components of the utility functions that form the\nbasis of the equilibrium predictions to be tested. However, it is possible that\nthese variables exert an independent influence on deterrence outcomes in\naddition to their influence on equilibrium predictions. Furthermore, since\nthese individual components are combined in a different, nonlinear fashion\nwithin the unilateral deterrence game to generate equilibrium predictions,\nmulticollinearity between the equilibrium predictions and the control vari-\nables is not present.16\nThere is little dispute that relative power has an important effect on interna-\ntional conflict behavior. Most significantly, its importance has been high-\nlighted in previous empirical studies of deterrence (for example, Huth 1988).\nIt is therefore important to control for the effect of the balance of forces in\nthe present analysis. I use the composite indicator of national capabilities\nfrom the Correlates of War project (Singer, Bremer, and Stuckey 1972) to\nmeasure military capabilities for each state. To determine the balance of\nforces in a dyad, I create a ratio of Challenger's capabilities to the total capa-\nbilities of the dyad. The final variable, balance of forces, ranges from 0\n(when Challenger is weak compared to Defender) to 1 (when Challenger is\nvery strong compared to Defender).\nSignorino and Ritter's (1999) S score measures the similarity of foreign policy\npositions between states. Although S is an important component of the\nmeasurement of utilities employed here, it is possible that similarity in foreign\npolicy positions has an independent effect on the outcome of international\ninteractions. Therefore, I include it as a separate variable, which ranges\n16Correlation between outcome predictions and control variables ranges from 0.002 to 0.25.\n  73\nfrom \u00ad1 to 1, with positive values indicating increasingly similar alliance\nportfolios and negative values representing increasingly dissimilar portfolios.\nDISTANCE\nGeographic proximity has repeatedly been found (for example, Bremer\n1992) to be an important predictor of international conflict. To control for\nthe effects of proximity, the distance between states in a dyad is measured.\nI take the natural logarithm of the distance between capital cities, except for\nthe USSR and United States when other cities are included, and states with\nland borders are considered to be zero miles apart (Bennett and Stam\nDEMOCRACY\nThe democratic peace literature (for example, Russett and Oneal 2001) has\nrepeatedly found that democracies have seldom if ever fought one another.\nFurthermore, Schultz (2001) has found that democracy has an important\neffect on credibility. It is therefore important to control for the effect of joint\ndemocracy on deterrence outcomes. To measure democracy, I use the polity\n2 variable, which ranges from -10 to 10, of the Polity IV data (Marshall and\nJaggers 2002). I use the minimum democracy score for the dyad as a variable\nin the empirical analyses.\nThe final control variable is of more a methodological than substantive char-\nacter. Beck, Katz, and Tucker (1998) have argued that it is important for\nstudies of conflict using pooled dyadic time series to account for time\ndependence within dyads. In other words, while the standard statistical\nassumption is that each observation is independent, observations of different\nyears of the same dyad are not truly independent. I account for time depen-\ndence by employing Beck, Katz, and Tucker's method of including peace\nyears and three cubic spline variables that account for time dependence.\nStatistical Method: Multinomial Logit\nBecause the dependent variable, game outcome, has more than two unor-\ndered categories, the appropriate statistical method to use is multinomial\nlogit. Since there are four categories, three equations are estimated. These\nequations independently estimate the effects of the independent variables\non producing outcomes Defender Concedes, Challenger Defeated, and Conflict\nrelative to the Status Quo.\n74 S. L. Quackenbush\nTwo alternative models are available for empirical analysis of the multi-\nple, unordered categories of the dependent variable employed here. The\nfirst of these is strategic probit, which Signorino and Tarar (2006) utilized for\na unified theory and test of extended immediate deterrence. Strategic probit\nprovides a method for integrating the theoretical and empirical models,\nwhile accounting for nonmonotonic influences of independent variables\nprobit would provide an excellent avenue for empirically determining the\nimpact of factors such as balance of forces, arms races, and domestic conflict\non general deterrence. However, since strategic probit uses a different solu-\ntion concept (quantal response equilibrium vs. perfect Bayesian equilibrium)\nand different information conditions (complete vs. incomplete information)\nthan perfect deterrence theory, an empirical analysis using strategic probit\nwould not be a test of perfect deterrence theory's equilibrium predictions,\nwhich is the purpose of this paper.\nThe second alternative would be a nested logit model. Nested logit\nmodels are models of a decision process that is made in stages in which the\ndecisions at later stages are limited by those made in earlier stages. This\nseems to fit nicely with the game structure examined here, where each\nnode of the Unilateral Deterrence Game would correspond to a different\nstage of the nested logit model. Unfortunately, nested logit is also not\nappropriate here, for two primary reasons. First, as with the strategic probit,\nit would not provide a test of the equilibrium predictions of perfect deter-\nrence theory. Secondly, nested logit models are unable to account for strate-\ngic interaction between multiple decisionmakers, and are thus only\nappropriate for analyses of a single decisionmaker's nested decisions\nWhile the multinomial logit model is also a decision model that does\nnot account for strategic interaction, that does not pose a problem for this\nanalysis. Strategic interaction between Challenger and Defender is taken\ninto account through perfect deterrence theory, which makes equilibrium\noutcome predictions prior to the empirical analysis. Thus, the theory is\nthe \"decisionmaker\" (deciding which outcome(s) is predicted for each\nobservation), and the purpose of this analysis is to test how well the theory\nmakes those decisions.\nRESULTS\nI begin testing the equilibrium predictions of perfect deterrence theory out-\nlined in Table 1 through a base model--incorporating only the four outcome\nprediction variables and the peace years spline variables--shown in Table 2.\nThis model fits the data significantly better than a model including only the\nconstant term.\n  75\nBeginning with predicted Status Quo, one can see that the coefficient\nfor this variable is insignificant for all but the Conflict equation. This indi-\ncates that predicting the status quo has no significant impact on the occur-\nrence of Defender Concedes or Challenger Defeated, while it increases the\nprobability of Conflict. This latter result is quite surprising; if robust, this\nfinding would be problematic for the theory.\nThe impact of each of the non-status quo outcome predictions on the\noccurrence of game outcomes is in line with expectations. The prediction of\nDefender Concedes makes Defender Concedes significantly more likely to\noccur, and significantly increases the probability of Challenger Defeated and\nConflict. Similarly, predicted Challenger Defeated makes all non-status quo\noutcomes, most importantly Challenger Defeated, more likely to occur. The\nprediction of Conflict also has a significant impact in each equation. In\nother words, if Conflict is predicted, all non-status quo outcomes (most\nimportantly, Conflict) are more likely to occur.\nTo examine the robustness of these results against alternative explanations,\nthe full multinomial logit model was run including the control variables. The\nfull model, shown in Table 3, produces a highly significant fit to the data.\nThe results of the full model indicate that the predictions of perfect deter-\nrence theory are quite robust.\nUnlike the base model, predicted Status Quo is found to reduce the\nprobability of any non-status quo outcome, although the coefficient for the\nChallenger Defeated equation is not significant. Thus, although the results\nfor this variable were somewhat contrary to expectations in the base model,\nafter other factors are controlled for the expected pattern emerges.\nTABLE 2 Multinomial Logit Results without Control Variables\nOutcome\nVariable\nDefender\nConcedes\nChallenger\nDefeated Conflict\nSeb\nNote: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Status Quo is the reference category. Peace years cubic spline\nvariables not shown. Standard errors are robust standard errors adjusted for clustering within dyads.\n76 S. L. Quackenbush\nThe other key variables continue to be positive and significant across\nall three equations. Therefore, perfect deterrence theory's predictions of Status\nQuo, Defender Concedes, Challenger Defeated, and Conflict are all strongly\nsupported by the empirical record, and these predictions are robust against\nalternative explanations.\nThe results for the control variables are mostly in line with previously\nestablished expectations. The balance of forces has a positive coefficient\nthroughout, although it is not significant for the Challenger Defeated equa-\ntion. Distance, democracy, and peace years all reduce the probability of\neach non-status quo outcome, although democracy is surprisingly not sig-\nnificant for the Challenger Defeated equation. The S score only has a signif-\nicant impact on Challenger Defeated, which is in the expected negative\ndirection.\nThese results for the prediction of game outcomes are more easily\nunderstood through examination of predicted probabilities. The value for\nthe predicted outcome is set to 1, the values for the other outcome predic-\ntions is set to 0, and the control variables are set to their means.\nTABLE 3 Multinomial Logit Results with Control Variables\nOutcome\nVariable\nDefender\nConcedes\nChallenger\nDefeated Conflict\nSeb\nNote: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.

To ease interpretation, the Status Quo column of\nTable 4 shows the predicted probability of each outcome given a prediction\nof Status Quo. The other columns show the change in the predicted proba-\nbility of a given outcome when a non-status quo outcome is predicted. For\nexample, predicting Defender Concedes decreases the probability of Status\nQuo by 0.19%, increases the probability of Defender Concedes by 85.71%,\nand increases the probability of Challenger Defeated and Conflict by\nPrediction of any non-status quo outcome reduces the probability of\nthe Status Quo, although not by the largest of margins. The prediction of a\nconcession by Defender greatly increases the probability of a Defender Con-\ncedes outcome (an increase of over 85%), the prediction of a defeat for\nChallenger greatly increases the probability of Challenger Defeated (an\nincrease of 300%), and the prediction of Conflict has a large impact on the\nprobability of Conflict (an increase of 250%). Each of these results is in line\nwith expectations.\nAstute readers will note that although predictions of Defender Concedes\nand Conflict have their largest impact on the appropriate outcome, they also\ngreatly increase the probability of other non-status quo outcomes. This\nshould actually be expected, since each of the equations is a comparison\nbetween a non-status quo outcome and the status quo. When a non-status\nquo outcome is predicted, it should make the status quo less likely to occur.\nIf the status quo is less likely, then all non-status quo outcomes (even those\nnot specifically predicted) are more likely.17\n17Thus, the key results are the direction and significance of the outcome predictions on those outcomes\n(e.g., of predicted Defender Concedes in the Defender Concedes equation). Note that each of these coef-\nficients is positive and highly significant.\nTABLE 4 Impact of Outcome Predictions on the Predicted Probabilities of Outcomes\nPredicted outcome\nOutcome\nStatus\nQuo\nDefender\nConcedes\nChallenger\nDefeated Conflict\nNote: These predicted probabilities were calculated using the results of the full model (Table 3). The\nvalue for each predicted outcome was set to 1, the values for the other outcome predictions set to 0,\nand the control variables were set to their means.\n78 S. L. Quackenbush\nNonetheless, prediction of Challenger Defeated has a larger impact on\nthe Defender Concedes and Conflict outcomes than on the Challenger\nDefeated outcome. This indicates that the model has some difficulty in dif-\nferentiating between concessions by Challenger and Defender. However,\nWald tests for combining outcomes confirm that the model is able to distin-\nguish between each of the outcomes, again significant at the <0.0001 level.\nA further test of the model's empirical fit is provided by block tests of\nstatistical significance, as shown in Table 5. These tests clearly demonstrate\nthat the full model provides a better fit than the null model. Furthermore,\nremoving any single equilibrium prediction produces a significantly worse\nfit to the data than the full model, as does removing the set of all four equilib-\nrium predictions. Thus, we can have confidence that each outcome prediction\nof perfect deterrence theory provides an important contribution to explain-\ning the dynamics of deterrence.\nOne unusual feature of this test of perfect deterrence theory is that the\ntheory does not provide unique outcome predictions in most cases; rather,\nbecause of multiple equilibria, two or three different outcomes are possible\nin many observations. Table 6 helps to clarify the empirical implications of\nTABLE 5 Block Tests of Statistical Significance\nVariable removed df Log-likelihood Probability\nTABLE 6 Comparison of Predicted and Observed Outcomes\nObserved outcome Percent correct\nPredicted outcome(s) SQ DC CD DD Total Total Non-SQ\nNote: Outcomes are abbreviated as follows: SQ: Status Quo; DC: Defender Concedes; CD: Challenger\nDefeated; DD: Conflict.\n  79\nthese nonexclusive equilibrium predictions. Each row shows the number of\nobservations that correspond to each group of predictions from Table 1,\nseparated by the outcome actually observed. Thus, for example, there are\n21,563 observations where the predicted outcome is either Status Quo or\nDefender Concedes; of these, 21,391 actually result in the status quo, and a\nfurther 110 result in a concession by Defender, for a total accuracy rate of\n99.71%. One can see that each of the predictions is about 99% accurate,\nexcept for the unique predictions of Defender Concedes and Conflict, which\nare less than 1% accurate.\nClearly, the accuracy of these latter predictions is problematic. As\nTable 1 makes clear, these unique predictions of Defender Concedes or\nConflict occur when Challenger prefers Conflict to Status Quo. In that\ncase, Challenger's only rational course of action is to challenge the status\nquo, leading to one of those outcomes. This is the prediction of perfect\ndeterrence theory; however, it must also be the prediction of any theory,\nsince that is the only logical result of those preferences. This result is\nclearly a product of error in the measurement of utilities. For instance, despite\nthe maintenance of the status quo throughout, Conflict is the predicted\nbecause throughout, the United States is measured to prefer Conflict to\nthe Status Quo. While the United States almost certainly did not truly have\nthat preference, it is the best estimate produced by the measurement of\nutilities employed here, based on the method pioneered by Bueno de\nacknowledge that the procedures they developed \"may introduce consid-\nerable measurement error,\" concluding that this \"suppresses . . . our\nresults.\" Hence, future research should seek to improve our measurement\nof utilities; once that is done, one would expect support for perfect deter-\nrence theory to be even stronger.\nSince non-status quo outcomes are rare events, one could achieve 99%\naccuracy by simply predicting the Status Quo for every observation. However,\nin so doing, one would achieve 0% accuracy of non-status quo predictions.\nAs one can see from Table 6, the non-status quo predictions here are about\n49 percent accurate (with the accuracy of individual predictions between 14\nand 82 percent accurate). Thus, perfect deterrence theory provides a pro-\nportional reduction in the error of non-status quo predictions of 20 percent.\nAlthough improvement is always possible, these results nonetheless support\nperfect deterrence theory.\nThese results for perfect deterrence theory can be put in perspective\nby comparing them with an alternative theory of international conflict.\nBueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992) constructed the International Inter-\naction Game to analyze relations between states. Although this is not the\nway they present it, theirs is essentially a theory of general deterrence.\nFurthermore, it has been extensively tested by Bennett and Stam (2000b) in\n80 S. L. Quackenbush\na multinomial logit analysis quite similar to that conducted here. Therefore,\nit is useful to compare the results found here to the results obtained by\nBennett and Stam.\nOnly five outcomes emerge as equilibrium predictions of the Interna-\ntional Interaction Game: status quo, acquiescence by A, acquiescence by B,\nnegotiation, and war. However, six different outcomes of the IIG--status\nquo, acquiescence by B, negotiation, capitulation by A, capitulation by B,\nand war--are realized. Thus, one equilibrium prediction (acquiescence by A)\nnever occurs in reality, and two other outcomes that do occur (capitulation\nby A and capitulation by B) are never predicted in equilibrium. In the Uni-\nlateral Deterrence Game, however, all four possible outcomes occur in both\npredictions and the historical record.\nIn addition, the multinomial logit results obtained here provide much\nstronger support for perfect deterrence theory than the support Bennett and\nStam (2000b) found for the International Interaction Game. As Bennett and\nStam (2000b:473) note, only two of the equilibrium predictions \"are helping\nto differentiate non-status quo outcomes from the status quo.\" Compare this\nto the Unilateral Deterrence Game, where each outcome prediction helps to\ndifferentiate between the status quo and non-status quo outcomes. If perfect\ndeterrence theory is more consistent with the empirical record than \"one of\nthe most important theories of international conflict\" (Bennett and Stam\nCONCLUSIONS\nA divide exists in the literature between formal theories and quantitative\nanalyses of deterrence, largely because formal theories of general deter-\nrence have never been subjected to direct empirical testing. This paper has\nsought to bridge this divide in two ways.\nFirst was to develop the conceptualization and procedures to make\nsuch direct empirical testing possible. Key conceptualizations include case\nselection for direct general deterrence--I argue that identifying opportunity\nfor conflict is the key. In addition, procedures to measure the actors' utilities\nfor the different outcomes were developed. Also, since incomplete informa-\ntion equilibria depend on each state's estimate of the opponent's credibility,\na nonlinear transformation technique was developed to estimate the credi-\nbility parameters.\nUsing these procedures, I have endeavored to fill a large void in the lit-\nerature by testing perfect deterrence theory, focused on the theory's\nUnilateral Deterrence Game with incomplete information. I used multino-\nmial logit methods to examine the prediction of particular game outcomes.\nThe results indicate that the theory is well supported by the historical\nrecord.\n  81\nThe results of this research have important policy implications as well.\nThe policy recommendations of perfect deterrence theory and classical\ndeterrence theory are diametrically opposed on many issues (Zagare 2004).\nFor example, classical deterrence theory argues that national missile defense\nundermines the stability of deterrence (for example, Powell 2003), whereas\nan application of perfect deterrence theory demonstrates that national missile\ndefense enhances deterrence stability (Quackenbush 2006b). However, policy\ndiscussions in academia and government are generally based on classical\ndeterrence theory. Given its strong empirical support, coupled with logical\nand empirical limitations of classical deterrence theory (Zagare 1996),\nperfect deterrence theory would provide a much better basis for analyzing\nvarious aspects of national security policy. This could be done by applying\nperfect deterrence theory to case studies of particular events (for example,\nthe analysis of the war in Kosovo by Quackenbush and Zagare 2006) or to\nthe analysis of particular policy issues (for example, the analysis of national\nIn addition, perfect deterrence theory provides a natural basis for further\nempirical research on the dynamics of deterrence. First, future research\nfocused on improving measurement of utilities would be particularly\npertinent. Also, direct tests of further formal theories--not only theories of\ndeterrence--are of vital importance for improving our understanding of\ninternational interactions. In addition, this analysis was focused on only one\nof the theory's three core models, applied across all observations. Thus, this\nanalysis may have underestimated the theory's explanatory power. One\navenue for future research is therefore to conduct a more nuanced test incor-\nporating models of mutual and extended deterrence. And finally, further the-\noretical expansions of perfect deterrence theory--such as an incorporation\nof more nuanced bargaining elements like endogenous stakes--would\ngreatly improve our understanding of the dynamics of deterrence.\nREFERENCES\nBeck, Nathaniel, Jonathan N.

Challenger estimates the\nprobability that Defender is Hard, pDef\n, and Defender estimates the proba-\nbility that Challenger is Hard, pCh\n(where 0 < p < 1 in each case). They find\nfour major types of perfect Bayesian equilibria. Each equilibrium specifies\nvalues for four important parameters: xH\n(xS\n) = probability that a Hard (Soft)\nChallenger defects at node 1, and yH\n(yS\n) = probability that a Hard (Soft)\nDefender defies at node 2. Certain Deterrence equilibria exist where [xH\n, xS\n;\nyH\n, yS\n ct\n; Steadfast Deterrence equilibria exist where\n[xH\n, xS\n; yH\n, yS\n< ct\n; Separating equilibria exist where [xH\n,\nxS\n; yH\n, yS\n pDef\n ct\n; Bluff equilibria exist where [xH\n,\nxS\n; yH\n, yS\n] = [1, v; 1, u] when pDef\n< cs\nand pCh\n< dn\n; Attack equilibria exist\nwhere [xH\n, xS\n; yH\n, yS\n< cs\nand pCh\n dn\n. The region of\nexistence for each equilibrium is defined by a combination of three critical\npoints. These critical points, defined below, are necessary to empirically\ngenerate the equilibrium predictions tested here:\nMeasurement Details\nThree important changes are made here to Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman's\nmeasurement procedures. First, I use Signorino and Ritter's (1999) measure of\nforeign policy similarity, S, as the basic building block for these measurements\nof utility. Secondly, I constrain the political cost term to be non-negative to\nprevent this \"cost\" term from providing an artificial boost to the utility for\nConflict. Therefore, I use the equation .\nThe third important change in Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman's mea-\nsurement techniques made here deals with the costs borne by a state in giving\nin (gx\n) compared to the costs borne by a state in conflict (wx\n). While Bueno\nde Mesquita and Lalman simply assume that gx\n= wx\n= 1, this sets the cost of\nbacking down equal to the cost of fighting. Unfortunately, this assumption\nmakes Conflict preferred to concession in almost all circumstances. In other\nc\nc c\nc c\nc\nc c\nc c\nd\nd d\nd d\nt\ns\nn\n=\n-\n-\n=\n-\n-\n=\n-\n-\n+ -\n; ; .\nfx x\nmax[u (SQ),0]\n=\n  85\nwords, if it is assumed that gx\n= wx\n, then almost all possible threats are cred-\nible. Clearly this is a problem; states often prefer to back down rather than\nfight, since the costs borne by a state in giving in are generally less than the\ncosts associated with conflict. Therefore, it is assumed here that gx\nand wx\nWith these modifications to the procedures laid out by Bueno de Mesquita\nand Lalman (1992), each state's utilities for each outcome are measured. The\nindividual components of these utilities are calculated using EUGene (Bennett\nand Stam 2000a). These raw utility values (which can range from -3 to 2) are\nnormalized to the interval from 0 to 1.\nSince I am testing predictions based on incomplete information condi-\ntions where player types are not common knowledge, Challenger's estimate\nof the probability that Defender is Hard (pDef\n) and Defender's estimate of\nChallenger's type (pCh\n) are needed. I develop a nonlinear transformation of\nthe difference between the utility for conflict and a concession, which I call\nU = U(conflict) \u00ad U(back down), to the interval between 0 and 1 while\nalso accounting for the impact of risk propensity.
