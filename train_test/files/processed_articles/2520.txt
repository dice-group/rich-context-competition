The current study sought to determine whether differences in\npsychiatric medication use might help to explain the negative findings. METHODS: In a nationally representative sample, 5692 sub-\njects were queried for cancer history, psychiatric diagnoses, and psychotropic medication use. The LTCS were defined as those indi-\nviduals who were 5 years from diagnosis and whose cancer was in remission or cured. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals\nwere obtained from multivariable logistic regression models evaluating the relationship between cancer status and use of psychiatric\nmedications. The interaction between case/control status and psychiatric diagnoses was also tested in a logistic regression model to\npredict psychotropic medication use. RESULTS: A total of 225 participants met the criteria for LTCS and 3953 met the criteria for\ncancer-naive controls (CNC). The LTCS were no more likely than CNC to carry a psychiatric diagnosis. Despite the LTCS reporting\nsomewhat greater psychotropic medication use compared with the CNC (28.8% vs 22.3%), unadjusted and adjusted differences did\nnot reach statistical significance, possibly due to sample size. The interaction between case/control status and carrying a psychiatric\ndiagnosis was not found to be significantly associated with receiving a psychiatric medication. CONCLUSIONS: LTCS and CNC dem-\nonstrated comparable rates of psychiatric prescription medication use. The relationship between taking a psychiatric medication and\ncarrying a psychiatric diagnosis was not found to be significantly different between the case and control groups. These findings con-\ntribute to an emerging hypothesis that in general LTCS are not a particularly psychiatrically vulnerable group.

Between 1971 and 2007, cancer survivors, defined as individuals living with a history of cancer, increased from\n1.5% to 3.9% of the US population.1 In 2012, approximately 64% of US cancer survivors had been diagnosed with cancer\nwithin the previous 5 years, and 15% within the previous 20 years.2 Expansion of the cancer survivor population has justi-\nfiably prompted inquiries into whether survivors carry a distinct symptom burden that invites tailored medical or mental\nhealth care. In fact, in a previous publication, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although not specifically\naddressing mental health issues, called for the implementation of \"evidence-based cancer plans that include all stages of\ncancer survivorship.\"3\nIn general, cancer survivors require mental health treatment at higher rates than cancer-naive controls (CNC).4-6\nAlthough this appears to be the case for cancer survivors in general, investigations of long-term cancer survivors (LTCS),\nstrictly defined as individuals surviving >5 years after diagnosis with cancer in remission or cured, indicate that this subpo-\npulation is not appreciably different from their cancer-naive peers with respect to several neuropsychiatric domains. When\ncompared with controls in large nationally representative databases, cancer survivors who are 4 years from diagnosis do\nnot appear to demonstrate increased rates of current major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic\nstress disorder, panic disorder, or cognitive symptoms.7-10 In the single instance in which a positive association was found,\nthe results were potentially confounded by the inclusion of LTCS who were still undergoing active cancer treatment, as\nCorresponding author: Ilana M.

Evidence suggests that a substantial per-\ncentage of patients with cancer who are in active treatment\nreceive psychotropic drugs. A large case-control study\nbased on insurance data in the Netherlands demonstrated\nthat patients with cancer are significantly more likely than\nCNC to receive prescriptions for psychiatric medica-\ntions.12 Another study determined that >50% of a wait-\ning room sample of patients with breast cancer had been\nprescribed either an antidepressant or anxiolytic.13 Plausi-\nbly, some patients with cancer might continue to receive\npsychiatric medications after the completion of active can-\ncer treatment, or remain better connected than their\ncancer-naive peers to systems of providers that might pre-\nscribe them.\nThe National Comorbidity Study Replication\n(NCS-R) provides a rare opportunity to probe this ques-\ntion. In the study, a total of 9282 individuals in a proba-\nbility sample (weighted to approximate the 2000 US\ncensus) were interviewed regarding psychiatric disorders,\ntreatments, and risk factors. A subset of 5692 participants\nwas also queried about cancer status and history. The cur-\nrent study harnesses these rich data to compare LTCS and\nCNC with regard to use of psychiatric medications.\nNational Comorbidity Study Replication\nThe NCS-R is a psychiatric, cross-sectional, cluster area\nprobability study conducted by trained lay interviewers in\nthe contiguous United States. Complete methodological\ninformation is available elsewhere.14 Investigators identi-\nfied potential participants through a multistage sampling\nprocess that consisted of probability samples, first of\ncounties or metropolitan areas, then units of 50 to 100\nhouseholds, and then a single household. Once a house-\nhold was identified, researchers selected a potential partic-\nipant randomly from among English-speaking individuals\naged 18 years. Residents of military bases, nursing\nhomes, and chronic care facilities were excluded. The\noverall participation rate was 74.6%.\nof the survey, which covered lifetime psychiatric disorders\nand demographic data; a subset of participants\noversampled those with psychopathology and included all\nparticipants with a lifetime psychiatric disorder, 59% of\nthose who were below the threshold for a psychiatric dis-\norder or who reported ever having received mental health\nservices, and 25% of those who neither met the criteria for\na lifetime psychiatric disorder nor reported ever having\nreceived mental health services. Part 2 of the survey col-\nlected data regarding risk factors, additional psychiatric\ndiagnoses, and medical comorbidities. The final data were\nweighted to adjust for differential probabilities in selec-\ntion, nonresponse rates, and poststratification differences\nin demographic variables. For these analyses, we used the\npublic access NCS-R database.15\nSample\nParticipants who indicated that they had a history of can-\ncer were queried regarding the type of cancer, date of diag-\nnosis, and current status (\"in treatment,\" \"cured,\" \"in\nremission,\" or \"don't know\"). In the current analyses, we\nconsidered an LTCS to be someone who reported having\nbeen diagnosed with cancer after the age of 18 years\n(because of the effects cancer might have on psychological\nmaturation) and who at time of the interview was either\ncured or in remission and at least 5 years from diagnosis.\nThe CNC group consisted of individuals who denied can-\ncer histories.\nMedications\nIn addition to the number of prescription and nonprescrip-\ntion medications (psychiatric or otherwise) a subject had\nused in the 7 days before the interview, the investigators\ngathered detailed information regarding psychotropic medi-\ncation use under the supervision of a physician within the\nyear before the interview. Interviewers provided subjects\nwith a list of 215 psychotropic drugs, both brand name and\ngeneric, and were instructed both to continue probing until\nall drugs were mentioned and to consult medication bottles\nfor names when participants encountered memory lapses\n(discussions were held in a respondent's home).14 These\nmedications were categorized in the original NCS-R data-\nbase under the following umbrella headings:\n\"antidepressants,\" \"sleeping pills/sedatives\" (ie, nonbenzo-\ndiazepine, benzodiazepine receptor agonists), \"tranquilizers\"\n(ie, benzodiazepines), \"amphetamines/stimulants,\" and\n\"antipsychotics.\" Because chronic pain is a common report\namong LTCS, we added an umbrella term of \"psychotropic\ndrugs with possible pain indications.\" These medications\noccasionally are used, either on-label or off-label, to manage\nPsychiatric Drugs in Cancer Survivors vs Controls/Braun et al\nneuropathic pain and include tricyclic antidepressants, fluox-\netine, fluvoxamine, gabapentin, and venlafaxine (duloxetine\nwas not in widespread use when the NCS-R was adminis-\ntered). For each psychotropic medication, subjects were\nasked to identify the reason for taking it and the prescriber\n(\"psychiatrist,\" \"general or family physician,\" \"some other\nphysician,\" \"some other health professional,\" and \"no one\nprescribed the medication\"). The latter 4 categories were\ncombined as \"other\" in the current analyses.\nCovariates\nDemographics\nAge, sex, marital status (married/cohabiting, divorced/\nseparated/widowed, or never married), race (white, black,\nHispanic, or other), education (<12 years, high school\ngraduate, some college, or college graduate), and house-\nhold income are among the demographics collected by\nthe NCS-R and adjusted for in the study's regression\nanalyses.\nPsychiatric Variables\nThe NCS-R relied on the World Health Organization's\nWorld Mental Health Composite International Diagnos-\ntic Interview hierarchical algorithm to determine psychi-\natric diagnoses based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria. A psy-\nchiatric diagnosis was established only if the participant\nmet the criteria in the year before the interview.\nMedical Variables\nTwo physical health variables were evaluated: a subjective\nhealth status rating (\"excellent,\" \"very good,\" \"good,\" \"fair,\"\nor \"poor\") and a yes/no response to whether a subject had\nbeen limited within the last 3 months as a result of health\nproblems. In the regression analyses, we grouped subjects\ninto those with fair or poor health status and those with\ngood, very good, or excellent health status. If a subject indi-\ncated that she or he was limited within the past 3 months,\nshe or he was included in the fair/poor status group, regard-\nless of how she or he responded to the initial query. Simi-\nlarly, a conglomerate chronic pain variable was constructed\nbased on yes/no responses to the questions of whether the\nsubjects ever had: 1) arthritis/rheumatism; 2) chronic back/\nneck problems; 3) frequent/severe headaches; 4) medically\nunexplained chronic pain; or 5) any other chronic pain?\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses used the NCS-R's weights to obtain estimates\nrepresentative of the US population in 2000. Part 1\nweights were used for the analysis of variables from part 1,\npart 2 weights were used for the analysis of part 2 varia-\nbles, as well as for the regression analysis, in which varia-\nbles from both parts were included.15 Analyses were\nconducted using SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS\nInstitute Inc, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN statistical soft-\nware (version 10.0.1; RTI International, Research Trian-\ngle Park, NC), as appropriate.\nAnalyses were restricted to subjects aged 30 years\nbecause no LTCS aged <30 years existed in the current\nstudy sample. Significant differences between groups with\nregard to demographic and psychiatric covariates were\nassessed using 2-sided Student t tests for continuous varia-\nbles and chi-square tests for categorical variables. For each\noutcome variable (use of a particular psychotropic medi-\ncation class), we fit serial multivariable logistic regression\nmodels to evaluate the association with case/control status\nadjusting for other independent variables (covariates).\nThe first model was unadjusted; the second was adjusted\nfor demographic variables (age, income, sex, marital sta-\ntus, ethnicity, and education); and the third was adjusted\nfor demographic, medical (lifetime history of having had\nchronic pain and a self-reported overall physical health\nrating), and psychiatric (presence within the last 12\nmonths of major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxi-\nety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder,\nand alcohol or drug abuse) variables. From these models,\nwe generated unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with\n95% confidence intervals. Tests were 2-sided and P values\n<.05 were deemed statistically significant.\nTo understand whether the relationship between\npsychotropic drug use and psychiatric diagnoses differed\nby case-control status, we conducted separate bivariate\nanalyses for cases and controls evaluating the association\nbetween psychotropic medication use (yes/no) and the\npresence of a psychiatric diagnosis within the past year\n(yes/no). Unfortunately, not all DSM-IV diagnoses were\navailable in the NCS-R and our conglomerate variable\n(\"carrying a psychiatric diagnosis\") consisted of attention\ndeficit disorder; agoraphobia with and without panic dis-\norder; alcohol abuse and dependence; anorexia; binge eat-\ning disorder; bipolar disorder I, II, and subthreshold;\nbulimia; conduct disorder; drug abuse and dependence;\ndysthymia; generalized anxiety disorder; intermittent ex-\nplosive disorder; major depressive episode; panic attack\nand disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder; social phobia;\nspecific phobia; and nicotine dependence. We tested the\ninteraction between case-control status and the presence\nof a psychiatric diagnosis for its ability to predict use of\npsychotropic medication in the logistic regression models,\nunadjusted as well as adjusted for the abovementioned de-\nmographic and medical variables.\nOriginal Article\nRESULTS\nOf the 5692 NCS-R subjects who were queried regarding\ntheir cancer history, 225 were identified as LTCS and\nwere 159 subjects who reported cancer histories but did\nnot meet the criteria for LTCS. Table 1 shows the distri-\nbution of characteristics by cases and controls. In compar-\nison with CNC, LTCS were likely to be older (mean age\noverall P 5.002). Although they were found to be no\nmore likely than CNC to meet the criteria for a DSM-IV\ndiagnosis, they were significantly more likely to report a\nlifetime history of having experienced chronic pain\nbers of prescription and nonprescription medications,\nnote that these variables were included as covariates in the\nstudy's multivariable regression models.\nFor LTCS, the median age at the time of the cancer\ndiagnosis and the number of years from diagnosis were\nerror, 1.4), respectively.

Although a trend toward LTCS tak-\ning more antidepressants and sedatives existed, this small\ndifference (6.5%) was neither clinically meaningful nor\nstatistically significant. Strikingly, with the exception of\ninsomnia, the reasons that LTCS and CNC turned to psy-\nchiatric medications were identical. In addition to the ab-\nsence of a main effect, no significant interactions were\nfound; the relationship between taking a psychiatric medi-\ncation and carrying a psychiatric diagnosis was not signifi-\ncantly different for LTCS and CNC. Taken together,\nthese findings suggest the absence of a prominent thera-\npeutic bias toward LTCS. Furthermore, the results of the\ncurrent study depicted a LTCS population with rates of\npsychiatric illness that were no higher than those of CNC,\nif with a suggestion of elevated medical involvement (they\nrelied on greater quantities of total prescription and over-\nthe-counter medications).\nThe findings of the current study reinforce an\nemerging hypothesis that, on the whole, posttreatment\nLTCS resemble the general population with regard to\nsion excludes cancer survivors who are <5 years from di-\nagnosis as well as those >5 years from diagnosis but still\nwith active disease. Nonetheless, this news will likely reas-\nsure patients in active treatment or early survivorship who\nare diagnosed with depression, anxiety, or cognitive symp-\ntoms and fearing symptom permanence. It invites further\nresearch into 1) subpopulations of LTCS who might be\ndifferentially vulnerable to long-lasting neuropsychiatric\nsequelae; and 2) the possibility that LTCS experience\nnonspecific psychiatric distress or isolated symptoms,\nsuch as insomnia, that in themselves do not meet the crite-\nria for a psychiatric syndrome.\nThere are several important limitations to the cur-\nrent study. First, NCS-R data, including health status,\nwere gleaned through self-report and did not rely on\nobjective measures such as medical records. Second,\ndetails of the subjects' cancer histories (eg, cancer grade,\nstage, and treatment characteristics) were lacking. Third,\n225 cancer survivors may not allow for enough power to\ndetect subtle differences between groups with regard to\nsome of the variables of interest, including the use of psy-\nchotropic medications. Particular types of LTCS may\nhave significantly higher rates of psychotropic drug use\ncompared with controls, but were either excluded from\nthe study by virtue of being institutionalized or were too\nsmall in number to impact the study's findings. For exam-\nple, the median duration since cancer diagnosis was\napproximately 14 years (a finding common to\npopulation-based studies of LTCS), raising the possibility\nthat increased rates of psychiatric disorders exist among\nLTCS closer to the time of diagnosis and treatment.4,7-11\nParticularly because modest psychosocial interventions\ncan improve mental health among LTCS, another weak-\nness is that the number of individuals who answered\nqueries regarding psychotherapy were too small to be\nincluded in analyses.18 Finally, the current study\nneglected subsyndromal dysphoria and anxiety, as well as\nillness concerns (ie, fear of disease recurrence) that are\nlikely to be prevalent among cancer survivors but do not\nnecessarily trigger psychiatric diagnoses. The results of the\ncurrent study should not be taken to negate the existence\nor functional impact of these psychological symptoms for\ncertain LTCS.\nThe current study also possesses important\nstrengths. The majority of studies evaluating the mental\nhealth of LTCS have focused on one or a few cancer types,\nchiefly cancers of the breast and prostate.16,18 By contrast,\nthe current study used a nationally representative sam-\npling methodology supporting maximal ecological valid-\nity. Second, the NCS-R allowed for precise, Structured\nClinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID)-based defi-\nnitions of psychiatric diagnoses. Similarly, the NCS-R\nwas rigorous in its data collection with regard to medica-\ntion use. Expert synthesis of the pharmacoepidemiologic\nliterature indicates that, overall, individuals are able to\naccurately report current and past medication use, partic-\nularly when the process is aided by a list of drug names, as\nit was in NCS-R interviews.19 Furthermore, interviewers\nwere trained to be persistent in their quest for a complete\nlist of psychotropic drugs used by respondents. Because\ninterviews were conducted in the respondent's home,\ninterviewers were encouraged to review medication\nbottles.\nThe role of the psychiatrist or other prescriber treat-\ning LTCS encompasses a set of issues beyond writing pre-\nscriptions. Experience in working with patients with\ncancer helps providers to recognize the range of expected\nand reasonable emotional states in cancer survivors in\ncomparison with physically healthy patients with mood or\nanxiety disorders that require drug interventions, and also\nto work with long-term survivorship comorbidities and\ndrug interactions that are less commonly encountered by\ngeneralists. Nonetheless, the findings of the current study\nmay have implications for the allotment of specialized\nmental health resources for cancer survivors. For example,\nPsychiatric Drugs in Cancer Survivors vs Controls/Braun et al\nthe increased education of mental health generalists\nregarding cancer-specific considerations may enable the\nmajority of LTCS to receive quality care in a community\nsetting as opposed to a cancer center or other cancer-\nspecific setting. In a resource-constrained environment,\nfurther research into the question of how to appropriately\nallocate mental health resources for cancer survivors is cer-\ntainly warranted.\nThis research was generously supported by a Harvard Medical\nSchool Shore Award.\nDr. Rao received consulting fees from the Dana-Farber Cancer\nInstitute for statistical analysis performed as part of the current\nstudy.\nREFERENCES\n1.
