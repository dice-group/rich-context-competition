Cultural messages transmitted through media may\naffect other behaviors related to mental health such as eat-\ning disorders and aggressive behavior,18,19 and media ex-\nposure may similarly contribute to development of depres-\nsion through reinforcement of depressogenic cognitions.20\nFor example, certain electronic media exposures are satu-\nrated with highly idealized characters and situations, and\nconstant comparison of one's self with these unattainable\nimages may result in depression.16,20-22 Related to this, me-\ndia messages often contain simplistic stereotypical por-\ntrayals of sociodemographic factors such as sex, race/\nethnicity, sexual orientation, and occupation.23-27 Because\nadolescence is an important time of self-definition, expo-\nsure to such simplistic portrayals can interfere with nor-\nmal identity development, potentially producing dyspho-\nria.28 Othermediaexposuresarehighlynegativeandanxiety\nprovoking,29-31 andrepeatedexposuretothesemessagesmay\nengender a negative and fearful perception of the world,\nwhich can also result in depression.16,17 In addition, me-\ndia commonly used by adolescents contain multiple ref-\nerences to risky behavior including substance use or abuse,\nviolence, and sex,32-37 and adolescents who engage in these\nbehaviors may come to regret them and become prone to\nHowever, it should also be noted that exposure to cer-\ntain media content might reduce the likelihood of de-\nveloping depression.41,42 Humor, an important element\nof entertainment, is frequently portrayed in television pro-\nmedical studies have shown that mirthful laughter can\nreduce stress,46 and laughter therapy has emerged as a\npossible therapeutic method.41 Humor has even been\nfound to be beneficial among depressed and terminally\nill patients.47,48 Life-affirming media messages may simi-\nlarly protect against depression.\nAlthoughsomehaveinvestigatedarelationshipbetween\nelectronic media and mental health, these studies gener-\nally have been cross-sectional and have focused on anxi-\nety.Forexample,somestudieshaveshownanassociation\nbetweenposttraumaticstressdisorderandexposuretotele-\nvision images of terrorist incidents.49,50 Similarly, exces-\nsive use of certain media has been associated with social\nanxietyanddeclineininterpersonalrelationships.9,51 How-\never, there is limited information about the relationship\nbetween media exposure and future development of de-\npression in a nationally representative population.\nThe purpose of this study was to assess empirically\nthe association between electronic media exposure in ado-\nlescence and subsequent development of depressive symp-\ntoms in young adulthood.

Our\nfinal study sample consisted of 4142 individuals who did not\nreport depression symptoms above threshold at baseline and\nwho had complete depression data at baseline and follow-\nviewed at baseline.\nMEASURES\nDepression\nThe Centers for Epidemiologic Studies\u00adDepression Scale\n(CES-D) consists of 20 items that have been successfully used\nfor screening and quantifying the severity of depression in gen-\neral populations, and shorter versions are commonly used.54,55\nNine CES-D items were included in baseline (wave 1) and 7-year\n(wave 3) assessments in the Add Health study. We formed our\ndepression scale using all 9 items. These items asked respon-\ndents how often in the last 7 days they had experienced spe-\ncific depressive symptoms (Table 1). Each item was scored\non a scale of 0 to 3, corresponding to responses of \"never or\nrarely,\" \"sometimes,\" \"a lot of the time,\" and \"most or all of\nthe time.\" We summed these responses to form depression scores\nat each time point ranging from 0 (no symptoms of depres-\nsion) to 27 (severe symptoms of depression). The 9-item de-\npression scale was internally consistent at baseline (Cronbach\nAmong adolescents, the complete 20-item CES-D scale\n(range, 0-60) has strong predictive validity for depression at a\nthreshold score of 24 for female adolescents and 22 for male\nadolescents.55 We scaled our cutoff scores on the basis of the\nnumber of items in our scale, resulting in depression cutoff scores\nof 11 or higher for female adolescents and 10 or higher for male\nadolescents (scale range, 0-27). Others have used similar meth-\nods to define a threshold for depression when using Add Health\nMedia Exposure\nAt the Add Health baseline evaluation (wave 1), information\nwas collected about media exposure in 1995. Participants were\nasked to report hours of exposure during the last week to each\nof 4 types of electronic media: television, videocassettes (DVDs\nwere not widely introduced until 1997), computer games, and\nradio. We analyzed exposure to each media type as a continu-\nous variable in hours per day. We also created a summary mea-\nsure of media exposure equal to the sum of the hours per day\nof exposure to each of the 4 media types.\nSociodemographic Covariates\nThe Add Health survey assessed relevant sociodemographic co-\nvariates known to be related to depression and/or media ex-\nposure. Sex was self-reported. Age at follow-up was computed\non the basis of the participant's date of birth and date of in-\nhome survey. Race was self-reported as any combination of\nwhite, African American, Asian, American Indian, and other.\nEthnicity was self-reported as Hispanic or not Hispanic. As a\nproxy for socioeconomic status, we used maternal educa-\ntional level (did not graduate from high school, graduated from\nhigh school or received a general equivalency diploma, had fur-\nther education after high school but did not graduate from col-\nlege, graduated from college but did not pursue further edu-\ncation, or had an advanced or other degree). The survey also\nincluded the participants' marital status and highest level of edu-\ncational attainment at follow-up.\nMethods of Analysis\nTo compare demographic and media use variables between par-\nticipants who did or did not exhibit depressive symptoms at\nfollow-up, we used t tests for continuous variables and 2 tests\nfor categorical variables. We used P.05 (2-tailed) to define\nstatistical significance for all analyses. We conducted these analy-\nses using wave 3 sampling weights.\nWe then used multiple logistic regression to assess the\nindependent association between each media exposure at\nbaseline and presence of depression at follow-up. We\napplied sampling weights for wave 3 of the Add Health study\nin all of our regression models. In addition to excluding all\nparticipants who were depressed at time 1, we controlled for\nbaseline CES-D score in all analyses. We searched for inter-\naction terms between media use variables and sex because\nmedia use is strikingly different between male and female\nusers8 and because representation of male and female indi-\nviduals in media are different.52 Participants with missing\ndata were not included in our analyses. This did not affect\nour results because less than 2% of wave 3 participants had\nmissing data for this analysis.\nOur primary models included all measured covariates. To\ntest the robustness of our results, we conducted all analyses using\nstepwise backward logistic regression with criteria for re-\nmoval from the model of P.15.\nTable 1.

These results held despite controlling with\nmultiple covariates, including baseline CES-D score. Ex-\nposure to videocassettes, video games, and radio were not\nassociated with development of depression. The associa-\ntion of certain media exposures in this study with the sub-\nsequent presence of depressive symptoms is consistent\nwith the findings of others who have associated media\nexposure with other mental health conditions.18,58\nOf the various media exposures measured in the Add\nHealth study, we found television and overall media ex-\nposure to be most closely linked to depression. These find-\nings are consistent with the hypothesis that excessive me-\ndia exposure may detract from protective experiences or\nlead to poor sleep. Among the 4 media exposures mea-\nsured, television viewing is unique in that it consumes a\nlarge amount of time,8 and participants who had the high-\nest levels of baseline television exposure were most likely\nto develop depression (Figure 2A). Although radio expo-\nsure is also large, it more commonly is present in the back-\nground and frequently accompanies other activities.8\nHowever, the finding that television was the medium\nmost strongly associated with the development of de-\npression in young adulthood is also consistent with the\nhypothesis that the specific content of certain media may\nlead to depression. For example, television contains more\nadvertising than either videocassettes or computer games,\nand advertisements are often designed to make the viewer\nbelieve that he or she requires a certain product or life-\nstyle to feel adequate.59 Although radio also contains ad-\nvertising, the combined visual and aural experience of\ntelevision may be more effective and compelling.60\nAnother difference between videocassettes and televi-\nsion is that content on videocassettes is generally specifi-\ncallychosenbytheviewer,whereastelevisionismorelikely\ntobeprovidedbydefault(ie,channelsurfing).31 Television\nalso contains the most compelling and dramatic news re-\nports, many of which are anxiogenic,49,50 and repeated ex-\nposure to these messages may lead not only to anxiety but\nalso to depression.3,16 Television also seems to contain the\nIn general, television is no more likely than other me-\ndia such as movies or music to contain risk-taking behav-\nior.33,35,36 Thus, our results suggest that the mechanism by\nwhich media exposure may influence development of de-\npressionisrelatedtoacombinationoffactorsincludingdis-\nplacement of protective experiences, poor sleep, self-\ncomparison with unattainable images, stereotyping, and\nanxiety-provoking content.\nAlthough we did not find that overall exposure to any\nof these types of media was associated with less depres-\nsion, this does not rule out the hypothesis that certain\nhumorous or life-affirming media exposures may re-\nduce the likelihood of depression.41,42 Because we were\nnot able to differentiate specific exposures, certain ex-\nposures still may be beneficial to some. However, it is\nnoteworthy that this study shows that total television and\ntotal media exposure are associated with an increase, not\na reduction, in depression.\nIt was an interesting and unexpected finding that young\nwomen did not exhibit a stronger association between\nmedia exposure and development of depression. In-\ndeed, they had significantly lower odds of developing de-\npression in the model involving total media exposure.\nMen and women use different coping mechanisms when\ndealing with depression; women are more likely to in-\nternalize and ruminate about their condition, whereas men\nare more likely to engage in externalizing or distracting\nactivities.63,64 Similarly, adolescent girls may develop closer\nand more intimate social ties than their male counter-\nDaily Hours of Exposure\nParticipants Who Developed Depression by Follow-up, %\nTelevision\nRadio\nA\nDaily Hours of Exposure\nParticipants Who Developed Depression by Follow-up, %\nVideocassettes\nComputer games\nB\nFigure 2.

Thus, excessive time devoted to me-\nIt is also possible that actual media content may have\nmore of a detrimental effect on male psychologic devel-\nopment than has been previously appreciated. The domi-\nnant fiction of idealized masculinity and sex roles to which\nboys are exposed while watching television may rein-\nforce feelings of marginalization and worthless-\nbination with preexisting negative cognitions may make\nunpopular or rejected boys feel even more outcast. Fu-\nture research may explore questions such as these by ex-\namining moderating effects of other factors such as\nstrength of interpersonal relationships on the link be-\ntween media use and depression.\nThese findings have implications for clinicians work-\ning in a variety of fields. Psychiatrists, pediatricians, fam-\nily physicians, internists, and other health care provid-\ners who work with adolescents may find it useful to ask\ntheir patients about television and other media expo-\nsure. When high amounts of television or total expo-\nsure are present, a broader assessment of the adoles-\ncent's psychosocial functioning may be appropriate,\nincluding screening for current depressive symptoms and\nfor the presence of additional risk factors. If no other im-\nmediate intervention is indicated, encouraging patients\nto participate in activities that promote a sense of mas-\ntery and social connection may promote the develop-\nment of protective factors against depression.\nHelping children at risk of depression to bolster so-\ncial support and involvement in activities is routine for\nchild psychiatrists and other mental health profession-\nals who work with adolescents; however, these clini-\ncians may also want to consider an assessment of tele-\nvision exposure as a marker of vulnerability to the\ndevelopment of depressive symptoms. Further research\nwill be necessary to understand how television expo-\nsure may correlate with the development of depressive\nsymptoms in psychiatric clinical populations or with the\nclinical course of diagnosed depression. At the popula-\ntion level, as our understanding of the links between the\nmass media and adolescent depression become further\nrefined, prevention programs may wish to incorporate\nthese research findings into educational efforts aimed at\nadolescents and their families.\nOur study was limited in that we relied on self-report\nof media exposure. Although self-report of media habits\nis subject to recall bias, it is currently standard practice in\nresearch of this type when it is not feasible to use recog-\nnition measures.37,69,70 It should also be noted that our in-\ndependent variables were based on a single point estimate\nof media exposure, and there is no assurance that this re-\nmained stable over time. It is also disappointing that the\nbaseline survey did not assess Internet exposure; how-\never, this is a known limitation of the Add Health survey.\nInsofar as the dependent variable, the Add Health study\nincluded only 9 items from the CES-D at follow-up, pre-\nventing us from using the complete 20-item scale.

Another limitation\nof the CES-D in general is its lack of specificity; for ex-\nample, it tends to detect anxiety and depression.\nIt should be emphasized that, although our study\nshowed a longitudinal association between media expo-\nsure in adolescence and development of depressive symp-\ntoms at later follow-up, this association does not neces-\nsarily imply causality. For example, it may be that\nadolescents with preexisting vulnerability to later devel-\noping depression are differentially attracted to watch-\ning television, perhaps owing to behavioral inhibition or\naversive interpersonal and family relationships.\nIn conclusion, the present study breaks new ground\nin linking media use in adolescence to the development\nof depressive symptoms in young adulthood, especially\nrelative to television exposure and overall media use.\nThe study also highlights a previously unappreciated\npotential vulnerability to media exposure in male ado-\nlescents in particular. Its longitudinal design and large\nnationally representative sample are important\nstrengths. Despite this study's limitations, these findings\nsuggest important directions for future research and\ninterventions with the goal of reducing the massive toll\nof depression.\nCorrespondence: Brian A.
