    "abstract": "Abstract\nPeople typically process information to confirm their prior held attitudes and stereotypes. As the\npolitical relations between NATO and Russia have distinctively drifted apart in recent years, we\nwere interested in how far old-established color depictions referring to the Cold War's\ndemarcations (USSR \u00bc red; NATO \u00bc blue) might reinforce people's political perception of an\nEast versus West antagonism nowadays. Participants received a fabricated news article in which\nboth world powers were either depicted on a map as Russia \u00bc red and NATO \u00bc blue or vice versa\n(Study 1). Testing a different sample in Study 2, we fully removed color assignments and used\nhachured distinctions or no distinctions at all. We revealed that perceived political distance\nbetween both sides increased particularly for participants with negative attitudes toward Russia,\nbut only when Russia was depicted in red. Thus, colors referring to the old-established Cold War\npatterns can indeed shape the political perception and reinforce stereotypical East versus West\nthinking.\n",

Along with the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, threatening\nEast versus West depictions returned in common news coverage, often accompanied by\nillustrations visualizing old-established Russia versus NATO stereotypes (referring to the\nformer USSR with red and to the NATO member states with blue; Gebauer, Raab, &\nCarbon, 2016). In fact, research has shown that color can increase the perceived\npolarization between Democrats and Republicans among the American electorate\n(Rutchick, Smyth, & Konrath, 2009), and that subtle visual metaphors depicted on a map\ncan affect people's attitudes (Schoormans, Carbon, & Gattol, 2011).\nIn many real-world contexts, like when reading a newspaper or watching the newscast,\npeople do not process information in a neutral way; instead, they search for information\nthat confirms their prior held attitudes and stereotypes (Kruglanski, 2004), even affecting a\nmental distance gap between East and West (Carbon & Leder, 2005). Following these ideas, we\naimed at investigating how far participants' perception--especially for those holding strong\nattitudes against Russia--of the political relationship between Russia and the NATO members\nmight be affected by the mere visualization of the territories of both power blocks. In Study 1\n\u00bc 23.1 years, SD \u00bc 2.4), we implemented a map either visualizing the\ntypical colorization used during the Cold War, that is, Russian territory in red and NATO\nterritory in blue, or showing an inversed and thus atypical color assignment (Figure 1, left\nclassifications and replaced them either with hachured distinctions or no graphical distinction\nat all (Figure 1, right column). All participants were invited to read and to evaluate a fabricated\nnews article that was the same in both studies and conditions and only differed in the type of\nmap embedded. The text described the armament of Russia as well as of the NATO states in a\nmatter-of-fact style, with an equal amount of text for both sides. A pretest (N \u00bc 20; 14 female;\nMage\n\u00bc 28.2 years, SD \u00bc 9.0) showed no significant difference between the level of induced\nthreat regarding the written description of Russia (M \u00bc 3.30, SD \u00bc 1.56) and the NATO\np\n\u00bc .05. Before reading the fabricated\nnews article, all participants in both studies, which were conducted simultaneously in July 2015\nto ensure a maximum of comparability, were asked to rate on a 6-point semantic differential\n``Who is to blame for the Ukraine Crisis?'' (NATO vs. Russia). Blame scores did not differ\np\n\u00bc .009. After participants read the article, they were asked to rate the perceived political\ndistance between both power blocks using the following item: ``The political distance between\nthe NATO states and Russia seems extremely strong to me'' (1\u00bc strongly disagree, 7 \u00bc strongly\nagree). As a last step, all participants were debriefed in Study 1 as well as in Study 2.\nIn Study 1, regressing political distance scores onto map condition (Russia red vs. Russia\nblue; dummy coded), blame assessments (continuous and centered), and their interaction\nR2 \u00bc .080 (Figure 1; bottom of left column). The interactions in Figure 1 are plotted at one\nstandard deviation above and below the centered mean of the blame assessment scores (Aiken\n& West, 1991). Simple slope analysis revealed that blame assessments (Russia high) significantly\nand positively predicted political distance scores in the Russia\u00bc red condition, b \u00bc .81,\nt(71) < 1, p \u00bc .492. Additionally, among participants with high blame assessments toward\nRussia, political distance scores were higher in the Russia\u00bc red condition, b \u00bc 1.01, SE \u00bc .77,\nt(71) \u00bc 2.14, p \u00bc .036. There was no simple effect of condition, in contrast, among participants\nStudy 2 showed that regressing political distance scores onto map condition (hachured vs.\nplain gray; dummy coded), blame assessments (continuous and centered), and their\ninteraction revealed neither a main effect for map condition, b \u00bc .09, SE \u00bc .32, t(66) < 1,\nFigure 1.

Bottom row showing mean\nratings for the perceived political distance between the NATO and Russia by map condition (Study 1;\nRussia \u00bc red vs. Russia \u00bc blue and Study 2; hachured vs. plain grey) and prior held blame assessments\n(continuous and centered variable) for the Ukraine Crisis. Error bars indicate \u00c6 1 standard error of the mean\nGebauer et al. 3\nR2 < .001. Consequently, simple slope analyses showed no significant effects, all ts\n< 1 (Figure\n1; bottom of right column).\nResults indicate that colors depicting the old-established Cold War patterns can indeed\naffect participants' political perception of an East versus West conflict that has come full\ncircle. Such color schemes can induce a higher perceived political distance, especially for\nthose who strongly blame Russia for this crisis. Thus, these depictions might not affect\npeople per se but can confirm and reinforce prior held attitudes--whether the strong effect\nof the color red in our study can be attributed to a kind of red-negative-associations or\nstereotypical red-Soviet Union-associations cannot fully be decided within the scope of the\ncurrent study; also note that although red \u00bc negative stereotypes have been documented so\nfar, other authors also claim positive relations with the color and others fail to find any main\neffect of red at all (Hesslinger, Goldbach, & Carbon, 2015). To create a better understanding\nof colors and political thinking, future research might extend these findings to other\nantagonistic country pairs (e.g., India and Pakistan1), where neither is associated with the\ncolor red. However, our findings are a first step toward a fairly undiscovered field of\npsychological research and are in accordance with former findings showing that prior\nattitudes can bias information processing (Kruglanski, 2004) and mental representations\n(Carbon & Leder, 2005; Hesslinger et al., 2015). Additionally, findings might help to better\nunderstand the power of specific depictions in news coverage by applying these ideas to the\ndomain of color-induced stereotypes.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nNote\n1.
