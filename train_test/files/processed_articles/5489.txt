    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nIn multiple sclerosis, microglia/macrophage activation and\nastrocyte reactivity are important components of the lesion\nenvironment that can impact remyelination. The current\nstudy characterizes these glial populations relative to\nexpression of candidate regulatory molecules in cuprizone\ndemyelinated corpus callosum. Importantly, periods of\nrecovery after acute or chronic cuprizone demyelination\nare examined to compare conditions of efficient versus\nlimited remyelination, respectively. Microglial activation\nattenuates after early demyelination. In contrast, astrocyte\nreactivity persists throughout demyelination and a 6-week\nrecovery period following either acute or chronic demyeli-\nnation. This astrocyte reaction is characterized by (a) early\nproliferation, (b) increased expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary\nacidic protein), Vim (vimentin), Fn1 (fibronectin) and CSPGs\n(chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans) and (c) elaboration of a\ndense network of processes. Glial processes elongated in the\naxonal plane persist throughout lesion areas during both\nthe robust remyelination that follows acute demyelination\nand the partial remyelination that follows chronic de-\nmyelination. However, prolonged astrocyte reactivity with\nchronic cuprizone treatment does not progress to barrier\nformation, i.e. dense compaction of astrocyte processes to\nwall off the lesion area. Multiple candidate growth factors\nand inflammatory signals in the lesion environment show\nstrong correlations with GFAP across the acute cuprizone\ndemyelination and recovery time course, yet there is more\ndivergence across the progression of chronic cuprizone\ndemyelination and recovery. However, differential glial scar\nformation does not appear to be responsible for differential\nremyelination during recovery in the cuprizone model. The\nastrocyte phenotype and lesion characteristics in this\ndemyelination model inform studies to identify triggers of\nnon-remyelinating sclerosis in chronic multiple sclerosis\nlesions.\n",

The complex reactions of astrocytes and mi-\ncroglia are key components of the pathological environment.\nAstrocytes, more so than microglia, are associated with tissue\nmodifications that form barriers to regeneration, such as\naxon growth and remyelination (Sofroniew and Vinters,\n2010). In demyelinating diseases, the progression of astrocyte\nreactivity and the associated regulatory signalling in the\nlesion environment that inhibit remyelination are poorly\nunderstood.\nIn the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis, astrocyte scar\nformation is considered a prominent feature of the sclerotic\nlesions observed in chronic cases. Furthermore, remyelinating\nand non-remyelinating regions of multiple sclerosis lesions\nexhibit differential astroglial phenotypes (John et al., 2002; Nair\net al., 2008). Inflammatory mediators in this autoimmune\ndisease can induce reactive changes in astrocytes (John et al.,\n1 These authors contributed equally to this work.\n2 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email regina.armstrong@usuhs.edu).\nAbbreviations: BMP4, bone morphogenetic protein 4; CNS, central nervous system; CSPG, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan; Ct\n, threshold cycle; Cy3, indocarbocyanine; FGF2,\nfibroblast growth factor 2; Fn1, fibronectin; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; Glu1, glutamine synthetase; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; IL-\n1b, interleukin 1b; Itgam, integrin alpha M; LIF, leukaemia inhibitory factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion; MOG, myelin oligodendrocyte\nglycoprotein; Nes, nestin; PFA, paraformaldehyde; Plp1, proteolipid protein; Ptprz1, phosphacan; QPCR, quantitative PCR; TGFb, transforming growth factor b; TnC, tenascin\nC; TNFa, tumour necrosis factor a; Vim, vimentin.\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\n2005). Breakdown of the blood\u00adbrain barrier can also stimulate\nastrocyte reactivity. Inflammation and blood\u00adbrain barrier\nleakage are associated with active multiple sclerosis disease\nstages. It is not clear how these processes may contribute to the\nphenotype of astrocytes associated with non-remyelinating,\nsclerotic lesions of chronic, inactive multiple sclerosis lesions. It\nis also not known whether the duration of astrocyte reactivity\ninfluences the astrocyte phenotype and progression of sclerosis\nin chronic lesions.\nThe cuprizone neurotoxicant model of experimental\ndemyelination is advantageous for characterizing the glial\nresponse during prolonged demyelination and differential\nremyelination. Cuprizone ingestion causes oligodendrocyte\nloss and microglial activation without a marked lymphocytic\nresponse (Matsushima and Morell, 2001). These pathological\nfeatures are similar to pattern III lesions of multiple sclerosis\n(Lucchinetti et al., 1999). Early microglial activation initiates\na cascade of signals that stimulates astrocytes to express\nsignalling molecules which contribute to demyelination,\nindicating a key role of reactive astrocytes in the progression\nof demyelinating disease (Kang et al., 2012). The ability to\nremove the demyelinating agent simplifies studies of the\nremyelination phase. When used as a short-term protocol,\ncuprizone produces a single episode of `acute' demyelination\nfollowed by efficient spontaneous remyelination. More\nprolonged cuprizone ingestion results in a continuous\n`chronic' demyelination state which subsequently remyeli-\nnates poorly. Therefore cuprizone can facilitate comparison\nof the tissue environments associated with efficient against\nlimited remyelination (Armstrong et al., 2006; Mason et al.,\nAstrogliosis in the cuprizone model has typically been\ncharacterized using immunohistochemical detection of GFAP\n(glial fibrillary acidic protein) either to count the number of\nastrocytes or measure immunoreactivity in a region of interest.\nAstroglial activation begins during initial stages of cuprizone\nand continues through at least 12 weeks of cuprizone\nexpression remains elevated for several weeks (Plant et al.,\n2005). However, the astroglial response to injury is much more\ncomplex than GFAP staining intensity or astrocyte cell number\ncan capture. More thorough characterization of the astroglial\nreaction is required. Astroglial characteristics may be especially\nimportant in the cuprizone model with respect to envir-\nonmental features that influence differential remyelination\nfollowing acute versus chronic cuprizone. Therefore studies are\nneeded to phenotype the astrocytic response in the period\nafter removal of cuprizone from the diet.\nThe current studies characterize microglial activation and\nastrogliosis throughout acute and chronic cuprizone demye-\nlination with a focus on the subsequent recovery periods on\nnormal chow. We find that astrocyte reactivity, in contrast\nwith microglial activation, continues during chronic demye-\nlination and through a 6-week recovery period to allow for\nremyelination. A battery of immunohistochemical and his-\ntological indicators is used to phenotype the astrocytic re-\nsponse. QPCR (quantitative PCR) gene arrays further\ncharacterize the pattern of genes expressed in the corpus\ncallosum throughout the periods of cuprizone treatment and\nrecovery. These arrays include analysis of indicators of\nastrogliosis and candidate genes in the lesion environment\nthat may stimulate astroglial responses and/or regulate the\nextent of remyelination. These QPCR arrays are the first to\nexamine expression patterns of environmental signals for\ncomparison between recovery periods with distinctly different\nremyelination efficiencies, i.e. robust remyelination after an\nacute episode of cuprizone demyelination as compared with\nlimited remyelination capacity after more prolonged cuprizone\ntreatment.\nMETHODS\nCuprizone model\nThe cuprizone model was performed as in our previous studies\nof short- and long-term administration protocols (Armstrong\n6 mice (6\u00ad7 weeks of age) were purchased from Jackson\nLaboratories and housed two per cage on a 12 h light\u00addark\ncycle at the Uniformed Services Health Sciences animal\nfacility. Food and water were provided ad libitum. To induce\ndemyelination, 8-week-old mice were fed a 0.2% (w/w)\ncuprizone diet [finely powdered oxalic bis(cyclohexylidene-\nhydrazide); Sigma-Aldrich] mixed into milled chow (Certified\ncuprizone continuously for either 6 weeks for `acute' or 12\nweeks for `chronic' demyelination models. After cuprizone\nfeeding, mice were returned to normal chow for either 3- or\n6-week periods to evaluate spontaneous recovery. Control\nmice were fed normal chow without cuprizone and analysed\nat ages matched to the start of cuprizone (8 weeks) and the\nend points of each time course for 6 weeks of cuprizone and\n6 weeks of recovery (20 weeks) or 12 weeks of cuprizone\nand 6 weeks of recovery (26 weeks).\nAnalysis of tissue sections\nMice were perfused with 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde) and\nbrains were dissected prior to overnight post fixation in 4%\nPFA. Brains were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight,\nembedded in Tissue Tek OCT, and stored at 280\u00b0C. For immu-\nnohistochemical analysis, 15 mm coronal sections were cut and\nmounted on Superfrost Plus slides.\nMOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) was detected\nwith the monoclonal antibody 8\u00ad18C5 (Dr Minettia Gardinier,\nDepartment of Pharmacology, University of Iowa, Iowa City,\nIA U.S.A.).

In combination with GFAP immunostaining,\nKi67 was detected following heating in Antigen Retrieval Citra\nSolution (Biogenex). Vim (vimentin) was detected using a\nmouse monoclonal antibody (Millipore). Fn1 (fibronectin) was\ndetected using a rabbit anti-Fn1 antibody (Chemicon,\nMillipore). A mouse monoclonal anti-chondroitin sulphate\nantibody (Clone CS-56, Sigma) was used to immunostain the\nGAG (glycosaminoglycan) moiety of CSPGs (chondroitin\nsulphate proteoglycans). DSD-1 is the mouse homologue of\nrat Ptprz1 (phosphacan) and was detected with a monoclonal\nagainst DSD-1 (Millipore). Anti-CD11b (Abcam) was used to\nidentify microglia/macrophage cells. Anti-CD36 (Abcam) was\nused to identify endothelial cells of blood vessels. Primary\nantibodies were detected with Alexa FluorH 555-conjugated\ngoat anti-rat IgG, Alexa FluorH 488-conjugated goat anti-\nrabbit IgG (Invitrogen), Cy3 (indocarbocyanine)-conjugated\ndonkey anti-mouse IgG F(ab)2\n(Jackson Immunoresearch), or\nCy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgM (Jackson\nImmunoresearch). For collagen histology, paraffin sections\nwere stained using Masson's Trichrome Blue (Sigma) stain to\ndetect collagen fibres. Corpus callosum myelination status and\nastrogliosis was estimated based on the area of MOG or GFAP\nimmunostaining, respectively, quantified in coronal sections\n(Armstrong et al., 2006). An index of proliferation was\ndetermined by counting all Ki67 immunolabelled nuclei in\nthe corpus callosum. MOG, GFAP and Ki67 were quantified in\nthe corpus callosum between the midline and the point\nunder the peak of the cingulum. At least three sections per\nmouse and three mice per condition were included in the\nquantification.\nCustom array analysis of gene expression\nRNA was isolated following a modified protocol from\nSABiosciences (Zhou et al., 2012). At least three mice were\nprocessed for each experimental condition and control group.\nBriefly, the corpus callosum was microdissected on ice,\nhomogenized in 0.3 ml of TRIzolH (Invitrogen) and stored at\n280\u00b0C. An additional 0.7 ml of TRIzolH was added to the\nsamples when the RNA was isolated according to the ma-\nnufacturer's instructions. The RNA was purified using the RT2\nQPCR-Grade RNA Isolation Kit (SABiosciences, PA-001). Purity\nreadings were determined with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer\nsamples were re-purified according to the SABiosciences\nprotocol. Purified RNA samples were converted into cDNA\n(600 ng per reaction) using the RT First Strand Kit\n(SABiosciences, C-03) and used at 5 ng/10 ml in QPCR arrays.\nA custom 386-well plate (SABiosciences) was designed for\nQPCR expression analysis of 96 genes relevant to character-\nization of astrogliosis and the cuprizone lesion environment\n(Supplementary Table S1 available at http://www.asnneuro.\nexperimental conditions were run as a set of three disease\ntime points and one control time point without cuprizone\ntreatment. For each time point, cDNA was pooled from three\nmice of the same condition. Each experimental and control\ncondition was run as technical triplicates on three different\nplates. Raw Ct (cycle threshold) values of 0 (failed reaction)\nand above 35 (below detection threshold) were excluded.\nValues from four housekeeping genes (Tbp, Hprt1, Actb and\n18 sRNA) were used for loading normalization and quality\nscreening for each sample. Relative changes across the\ndisease time course and control ages were determined using\nthe DDCt method relative to gene expression values for\ncontrol mice (no cuprizone; 8 weeks of age matched to 0\nweek of cuprizone treatment). GenePattern 2.0 was used for\nanalysis of relative mRNA expression patterns (Reich et al.,\nStatistical analysis\nPrism 5.0 (GraphPad, Inc.) was used for graphing and statistical\nanalyses. One-way ANOVA measures were used to determine\nsignificant differences between cuprizone treatment groups\nacross the disease time course.

In the corpus callosum of\nnormal adult mice, GFAP is present in fine processes of\ndistributed astrocytes and CD11b immunoreactivity is present\non small microglia with branched processes (Figure 2A). After\n3 weeks of cuprizone feeding, CD11b immunolabelled cells\nare present at a very high density in the corpus callosum\n(Figure 2B). At this early time point, astrocyte reactivity was\nalso evident based on increased GFAP expression, hyper-\ntrophy, and disorganized process distribution (Figure 2B).\nCD11b immunoreactivity is attenuated at 6 weeks and further\nreduced at 12 weeks in contrast with the persistent astrocyte\nreactivity detected by GFAP immunohistochemistry\n(Figures 2C and 2E). Astrocyte reactivity continues to be\nevident at 6 weeks after the removal of cuprizone from the\ndiet (Figures 2D and 2F), indicating that astrocyte reactivity\nmay influence remyelination following acute and chronic\ndemyelination.\nAstrogliosis is induced for prolonged periods with\ncuprizone treatment\nGFAP immunoreactivity was further examined for changes in\nastrocyte morphology and distribution (Figure 3) that\nindicate progressive stages of astrogliosis (Nash et al., 2011;\nSofroniew and Vinters, 2010). In non-treated adult mice,\nastrocytes are distributed in discrete territories throughout\nthe corpus callosum (Figure 3A).

Nes (nestin) is an intermediate\nfilament protein that is up-regulated in astrocytes following\nsome forms of CNS damage. With cuprizone treatment, Nes is\nonly significantly increased at the 3-week time point, which\nis consistent with a previous immunohistochemical study of\nNes expression (Gudi et al., 2011).

Table 2\nshows the fold-change values of growth factor and inflammat-\nory signalling components that clustered with GFAP across the\nacute and chronic demyelination and recovery time courses.\nInterestingly, the set of 22 candidate genes that correlate most\nclosely with GFAP is the same in both the acute and chronic time\ncourses. Among the genes clustering with GFAP (Figure 8), the\nfold change values and extent of correlation are highest during\nthe acute demyelination and recovery time course (Figure 10).\nDuring the chronic time course, several growth factors,\nincluding FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2) and IGF-1 (insulin-\nlike growth factor 1) maintain high GFAP correlations at or\nabove the acute levels. However, TGFb (transforming growth\nfactor b) signalling components, BMP4 (bone morphogenetic\nprotein 4) and LIF (leukaemia inhibitory factor) do not correlate\nas well with GFAP during the chronic time course.\nMicroglia are important contributors to the expression of\ninflammatory signals and growth factors in the cuprizone\nlesion environment.

However, Itgam\nand several genes clustering nearby (i.e. Itgam through BMP4)\nexhibit normalization during chronic cuprizone (blue shades at\n12 weeks in Figure 8B) that is not observed for GFAP (red\nshades at 12 weeks in Figure 8B). These findings are consistent\nwith the early-stage activation of microglia yet prolonged\nastrocyte reactivity that was observed in our immunohisto-\nchemical analysis of CD11b and GFAP expression (Figure 2).\nDISCUSSION\nThe current study characterizes the expression of candidate\nregulatory molecules in cuprizone demyelinated corpus\ncallosum to compare conditions of efficient with limited\nremyelination. Our analysis demonstrates that astrocyte\nreactivity persists during remyelination, in contrast with\ntransient microglial activation, and therefore may be an\nimportant component of the lesion environment during the\nrecovery period to influence remyelination efficiency.\nCuprizone mediated demyelination in the corpus callosum\nresults in severe, diffuse astrogliosis. Astrocytes exhibit\nincreased expression of GFAP, Vim, Fn1 and CSPGs with a\ndense elaboration of processes and proliferation occurring\nduring an early disease stage. Astrogliosis continues through-\nout the period of active demyelination. Prolonged astrocyte\nreactivity does not lead to progressive severity of astrogliosis or\ntransition to a compact barrier or fibrotic scar. However, after\nremoval of the demyelinating agent astrocyte reactivity does\nnot normalize rapidly. Up-regulation of GFAP and Vim persists\nfollowing either acute cuprizone demyelination in conjunction\nwith extensive spontaneous remyelination or chronic demye-\nlination with poor remyelination. Surprisingly, array expression\nanalysis of candidate genes most closely correlated with GFAP\nin the corpus callosum tissues showed that the top 22 genes\nare shared between the acute and chronic time courses. The set\nof inflammatory mediators and growth factors that clusters\nwith GFAP is most strongly up-regulated during acute\ndemyelination.\nCharacterization of astrogliosis in the cuprizone demyelina-\ntion model provides an important comparison with astrocyte\nreactivity stimulated by distinct mechanisms of CNS damage,\nsuch as penetrating injuries, ischaemia or inflammation.\nAstrocyte reactivity is heterogeneous with differential pheno-\ntypes dependent upon the inducing stimulus (Zamanian et al.,\n2012). Comparison of an ischaemic stimulus [MCAO (middle\ncerebral artery occlusion)] with an inflammatory stimulus [LPS\n(lipopolysaccharide) injection] showed differential expression\namong four established markers of reactivity in cortical\nastrocytes. MCAO induced elevation of GFAP, Vim, Nes and\nTnC while LPS elevated GFAP and Vim expression without up-\nregulation of Nes or TnC (Zamanian et al., 2012). In contrast\nwith MCAO or LPS, the cuprizone model involves white matter\nastrocytes with demyelination as the predominant stimulus\nand occurs over a time course of several months. Astrocytes in\nthe cortex exhibited cuprizone effects of hypertrophy and\nincreased GFAP but these effects were less pronounced than in\nthe corpus callosum (Figures 2\u00ad4), which is consistent with\nGFAP data from others (Buschmann et al., 2012; Gudi et al.,\n2011). Relatively mild changes were observed in the corpus\ncallosum across the cuprizone time course for Nes and TnC as\nwell as S100b and Glu1. The dramatic and prolonged elevation\nof GFAP and Vim in demyelinated white matter, as well as in\ncortex with diverse injury models (i.e. MCAO and LPS), shows\nthat up-regulation of these intermediate filament proteins is a\nconsistent marker of reactive astrocyte phenotypes.\nAstrogliosis in multiple sclerosis lesions varies with\nautoimmune activity, blood\u00adbrain barrier integrity, location\nwithin the lesion area and disease duration (Lassmann, 2005;\nWu and Raine, 1992). Astrocytes express GFAP and Vim in\nFigure 7 Chronic cuprizone treatment does not result in collagen\ndeposition\nMasson trichrome histological stain to detect collagen fibrils (blue) along\nwith cytoplasm (pink) and muscle fibres (red) in a positive control section\nthrough a segment of intestine (A).

However, another study showed\ndemyelinated inactive multiple sclerosis lesions had increased\nlevels of TnC but not TnR while neither tenascin was\nincreased in demyelinated active lesions (Mohan et al.,\n2010). An increase of astrocytes expressing GFAP can be\nassociated with actively demyelinating through early remye-\nlinating multiple sclerosis lesions (Schonrock et al., 1998).\nAstrocytes undergoing proliferation, identified by Ki67, were\nrelatively rare or absent in multiple sclerosis lesions but most\nfrequently observed in early active and early remyelinating\nconsistent with findings in the cuprizone model (Gudi et al.,\n2009) and current study (Figure 3). Accumulation of fibrillar\ncollagen is associated with perivascular inflammation in\nmultiple sclerosis lesions (Black et al., 2010; Mohan et al.,\n2010). The cuprizone lesions did not exhibit an astroglial scar\ninterface with areas of fibrillar collagen. This result is\nconsistent with the cuprizone mechanism of demyelination\nand indicates an absence of astroglial barrier formation that\nFigure 8 QPCR custom array heat map of relative gene expression throughout the time course of acute (A) or chronic (B) cuprizone\ntreatment and recovery\nRNA was isolated from the corpus callosum of mice at each time point shown along the top of the heat map.

Chronic cuprizone lesions did show a dense network of\nthin astrocyte processes expressing GFAP and Vim similar to\nthe astroglial morphology observed in chronic multiple\nA major effect of astrocytes in a lesion environment is\nthrough expression of extracellular matrix molecules. Fn1 is\nnormally present at low levels in the adult white matter but\nwas increased in the corpus callosum during acute cuprizone\ndemyelination. Deposition of Fn1 has been reported in active\nbut not inactive multiple sclerosis lesions (Sobel and Mitchell,\nlesions was associated with extravasation from blood vessels\nor localized to astrocytes. Expression of Fn1 in white matter\nmay inhibit oligodendrocyte process outgrowth and myelin\nsheath formation (Siskova et al., 2009).\nCSPGs in glial scars inhibit axon regeneration (Bartus et al.,\n2012). Our array analysis indicated that Ptprz1 expression\nclustered with GFAP, in contrast with the other CSPGs\nexamined (neurocan, Ncan; brevican, Bcan; aggrecan, Acan;\nNG2, CSPG4) or the xylotransferase enzyme isoforms (Xylt1,\nXylt2) that initiate glycosylation of CSPGs. While NG2 is\nexpressed by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, astrocytes\nexpress each of the other CSPGs. Increased expression of\nCSPGs in reactive astrocytes may be mediated by BMP4 or\nmay have differential effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cell\nresponses. Immunolabelling confirmed expression of phos-\nphacan/DSD-1 in cuprizone lesions (Figure 9). Ptprz1 can be\nexpressed by astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes in the\nCNS (Faissner et al., 2006). Given that DSD-1 is a secreted\nprotein, additional studies would be required to determine\nthe cellular source(s) of DSD-1 during cuprizone demyelina-\ntion and recovery. Both the pan-CSPG antibody CS-56\n(Figure 5) and the DSD-1 antibody (Figure 9) consistently\nexhibited normalization of immunoreactivity following acute\ndemyelination that was less evident following chronic demy-\nelination. In vitro studies have indicated that neurocan and\nPtprz1 inhibit oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation\n(Siebert and Osterhout, 2011). However, Ptprz1 bound to\ncontactin-1 on the surface of oligodendrocyte precursor cells\ninhibits proliferation and promotes differentiation into\nmature oligodendrocytes based on analysis of glial popula-\ntions in Ptprz deficient mice (Lamprianou et al., 2011).\nFurthermore, Ptprz2/2 mice exhibit impaired recovery from\nexperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis that is assoc-\niated with increased apoptosis of oligodendrocytes (Harroch\net al., 2002). In a lysolecithin mediated demyelination,\nPtprz2/2 mice exhibited accelerated axon loss (Huang\net al., 2012). Therefore primary and secondary effects of\nPtprz isoforms could be involved in neuron-glial interactions\nin lesions. In multiple sclerosis biopsies, Ptprz1 is expressed in\nlesion areas with cells expressing PLP, which together with\nthe mouse studies indicates a potential role of Ptprz1 in\noligodendrocyte survival and remyelination in demyelinating\nThe current data from our QPCR analysis provides an\nimportant comparison of expression patterns during the\nrecovery phase following acute against chronic demyelina-\ntion. Our previous cuprizone QPCR study, using independent\nsets of mice, provided similar results for GFAP and Vim along\nFigure 9 DSD-1 proteoglycan expression in lesioned corpus callosum\nImmunohistochemistry of coronal sections through the corpus callosum\nshowing labelling with a monoclonal antibody that is specific to the secreted,\ntruncated variant of the Ptprz1 gene, DSD-1 proteoglycan (red) and GFAP as\nan indicator of astrocyte reactivity in lesion areas (green) along with DAPI\nnuclear stain (blue).

However, acute and chronic\nrecovery periods were not examined for comparison. Another\ngroup performed an Affymetix GeneChip array study of corpus\ncallosum tissues following acute and chronic cuprizone but\nlimited the recovery interval to only 2 days after return to\nnormal diet (Kipp et al., 2011). The majority of hybridization\narray studies using the cuprizone model have focused on\ndemyelination progression and the role of inflammatory\nfactors during acute demyelination showed results similar to\nthe current study with significantly increased expression of\nof IGF-1 and FGF2 in microglia isolated during acute cuprizone\ndemyelination complements in situ analysis, indicating\nexpression of these growth factors in both microglia and\nastrocytes in demyelinating lesions (Armstrong et al., 2002,\n2000). Thus, both astrocytes and microglia may contribute to\nthe significant increase of expression of IGF-1 and FGF2 during\ndemyelination. The presence of a specific growth factor and\ninflammatory signals in the lesion environment indicates\npotential activity, but extensive in vivo analyses are required to\ndelineate functional effects on remyelination (Moore et al.,\n2011). Studies in the cuprizone model using transgenic or\nknockout mice indicate a role for IGF-1 in supporting oligo-\ndendrocyte survival and FGF2 as an inhibitor of oligoden-\ndrocyte progenitor differentiation (Armstrong et al., 2006;\nAfter 3 weeks of cuprizone, IL-1b (interleukin 1b) and TNFa\n(tumour necrosis factor a) are among the most highly up-\nregulated genes in our analysis (Table 2: Il1b, TNF). IL-1b and\nTNFa can be secreted by astrocytes or microglia and are\ninvolved in microglial activation (Nair et al., 2008). Microglial\nactivation is strong during the initial phase of demyelination\nand much less robust during the chronic phase, as shown in\nFigure 2 and at additional time points in our previous study\n(Xie et al., 2010). Importantly, early microglial activation and\nrelease of inflammatory signals, such as IL-1b, can activate\nCD3 T-cells and initiate a cascade resulting in astrocyte\nsecretion of TNFa, chemokines and ROS (reactive oxygen\nspecies) that induce demyelination at 3\u00ad4 weeks after\ninitiation of cuprizone (Kang et al., 2012).\nTogether, these studies demonstrate several key findings\nthat are important in the interpretation of environmental\neffects on remyelination capacity. Astroglial reactivity\npersists throughout the period of cuprizone feeding, in\ncontrast with microglial activation which is more transient.\nThe astroglial response is relatively similar during the recovery\nphase following acute or chronic demyelination even though\nthe extent of remyelination is significantly different. Signals\nthat may inhibit the efficiency of remyelination following\nchronic demyelination do not appear to be significantly\nincreased after chronic demyelination. Therefore inhibitory\nmolecules may simply have a greater effect when the pool of\noligodendrocyte progenitors is reduced compared with the\namplified progenitor pool that is available after acute\nTable 1 QPCR values for characterization of astrocyte reactivity\nThe order of genes listed is according to the hierarchical clustering to GFAP shown for the chronic time course heat map.
