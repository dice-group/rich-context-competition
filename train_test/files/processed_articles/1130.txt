In this paper, we present findings from an exploratory study of single nucleotide polymorphisms\n(SNPs) in the CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 genes with tobacco and alcohol phenotypes, including frequency of\nuse and three subjective response factors occurring shortly after initiation of use. Subjects were 1056 ethni-\ncally diverse adolescents ascertained from clinical and community settings. The most significant associ-\nfactors to initial tobacco use. These findings were replicated in a separate community sample of 1524 families\nparticipating in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Both CHRNB3 SNPs were found to be\nassociated with similar measures of subjective response to tobacco. These results indicate that early subjec-\ntive response to nicotine may be a valuable endophenotype for genetic studies aimed at uncovering genes\ncontributing to nicotine use and addiction.\nINTRODUCTION\nTobacco and alcohol use among adolescents and young adults is\na pervasive public health issue, with serious economic, medical\nand social consequences. Tobacco use is responsible for 20%\nof preventable deaths in the United States (Centers for Disease\nControl, 2002) and alcohol is the leading cause of injury\nrelated deaths in individuals under 21 (National Institute of\nGenetics of alcohol and tobacco use\nAlcohol and tobacco use, abuse and dependence are complex\ntraits caused by a combination of genetic and environmental\nfactors (1\u00ad4). Both genetic and shared environmental influ-\nences contributed to smoking status in a cohort of Australian\ntwins, and monozygotic twin correlations for age of onset of\nsmoking were higher than dizygotic twin correlations (5). Her-\nitability estimates of 80% for regular tobacco use and 60% for\nnicotine dependence (6) and 64% for alcohol dependence (5)\nhave been obtained from twin studies. In addition, it has\nbeen shown that alcohol dependence and smoking were trans-\nmitted within families and that common and drug-specific\ninfluences were factors in this transmission, suggesting that\nthere may be a common factor in nicotine and alcohol depen-\ndence (7). Likewise, twin studies suggest evidence for\ncommon genetic influences on the use and problem use of\nNicotinic receptors\nNeuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are the\nprinciple target of nicotine.

In\ncombination, both subunit types contribute to unique pharma-\ncological and physiological responses involved in drug\nexposure, neurotransmission, and the integration of sensory\ninformation. There are two main classes of nAChR subtypes:\nthose that are sensitive to aBungarotoxin (aBtx), consisting of\nthe a7\u00ada10 subunits, and those that are insensitive to aBtx,\nmade up of a2\u00ad6 and b2\u00ad4. The receptor binding site is\nlocated between two identical subunits in the homomeric a7\nreceptors, or between a and b subunit in the heteromeric\nreceptors. Different combinations of a and b subunits in het-\neromeric receptors contribute to differences in the pharmaco-\nlogical properties of the receptor binding site. A variety of\ndifferent combinations of a and b subunits have been\nobserved, with differing stoichiometries (i.e. two a and three\nb or three a and two b), which have been shown to be differ-\nentially expressed in different brain regions under a variety of\nconditions (such as low temperature or exposure to nicotine).\nThe a5 and b3 subunits carry neither type of binding site and\nare thought to contribute to receptor targeting, localization and\nreceptor permeability (14).\nSome of the known nAChRs are expressed on cell bodies,\nbut most are expressed on nerve terminals where they modu-\nlate the release of neurotransmitters including glutamate,\ngamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), serotonin, norepi-\nnephrine and dopamine (15). Identifying the subunit compo-\nsitions of the nAChRs that influence dopamine release has\nbeen of marked interest given that dopamine seems to play\nan important role in modulating the reinforcing effects of vir-\ntually all drugs of abuse, including nicotine and alcohol\nmice coupled with immunological (18) and functional (19)\nassays indicate that dopaminergic nerve terminals may\nexpress as many as four distinct nAChR subtypes: a4b2,\nSeveral studies have examined the nAChR genes and\nsmoking and nicotine dependence. SNPs in the CHRNA4\ngene have been associated with tobacco related behaviors\n(20\u00ad22). Most studies of the CHRNB2 have not found evi-\ndence for an association (21\u00ad24), but two recent reports\nhave shown a possible role for this gene in age of initiation\nof smoking in women (25), and in smoking and alcohol sub-\njective response phenotypes (20). Other individual SNPs in\nseveral nAChR genes have been explored for possible inter-\naction affects with a variety of background factors, psycho-\nlogical characteristics and neurocognitive measures, but\nthese findings must be considered exploratory because they\nwere identified after multiple tests and have not been repli-\nemerged as strong candidates for nicotine dependence in two\nrecent reports of a genome wide association and a high-\nthroughput candidate gene survey (27,28).\nIn any genetic study, determining an appropriate phenotype\nis crucial to the analyses, but it can be difficult to determine in\nadvance which phenotype might be more likely to be associ-\nated with a particular gene or specific SNP. Here we have\ntaken the approach of using one sample of subjects to\nexplore multiple alcohol and tobacco phenotypes for possible\nassociations with SNPs in the CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 genes,\nthen using a second sample to replicate our findings. In the\nexploratory study, we tested conventional phenotypes of\nalcohol and tobacco behaviors (i.e. age of initiation, number\nof days used in past 6 months, typical pattern of use, peak\nuse, frequency of use, sensitivity and dependence/abuse) and\nantecedent phenotypes (subjective effects) for associations\nwith four SNPs in the CHRNB3 gene and three SNPs in the\nCHRNA6 in a population of ethnically diverse young adults.\nBased on findings in this first sample, we conducted a replica-\ntion study of specific SNPs and a single phenotype using a\nfamily-based, independently ascertained community sample.\nRESULTS\nDemographics (CADD)\nOne thousand and fifty six individuals met the inclusion cri-\nteria for this study. Seventy four percent are Caucasian (n \u00bc\n(n \u00bc 43), and the remainder are `other' (n \u00bc 58). The mean\nsubjects were male.\nDemographics (Add Health)\nOne thousand five hundred and twenty four families (1445 sib-\npairs and 79 sib-trios) were included with a mean age of\nthe families were Caucasian, 20% were African American,\n7.7% were Asian, 1.7% were Native American and the\nremaining 1.9% were not identified.\nSingle marker analyses (CADD)\nAllele frequencies for SNPs genotyped in the Colorado Center\non Antisocial Drug Dependence (CADD) are presented in\nTable 1. All SNPs were in Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium\nacross all ethnic groups. The three CHRNA6 SNPs had signifi-\ncantly different allele frequencies compared to Caucasians:\nP , 0.0001). There were no ethnic differences in allele fre-\nquencies for any of the CHRNB3 SNPs.\nCHRNB3. Table 2 summarizes the association results in\nCHRNB3 for all of the tobacco phenotypes for the entire\nsample adjusted for race. There were no significant associ-\nations with any of the alcohol phenotypes (data not shown).\nSeveral SNPs were associated with the three subjective\nfactor scores and more detailed analysis of these is presented\nin Table 3.\nTable 3 shows the statistically significant association results\nfor individual SNPs and tobacco subjective responses. The\nsixth column presents the b estimates from the linear\nregression analysis in WHAP. Evidence of association was\nfound between the CHRNB3 SNPs and the three subjective\nfactor for tobacco in the full sample, the most highly signifi-\nassociated with the positive factor for tobacco, with rs4950\nsample and two ethnic subgroups. An association was\nand the tobacco negative physical factor, again with rs4950\nassociations were also present in the Caucasian and Hispanic\nsubgroups (Table 3).\nCHRNA6. Table 4 shows the results for all of the tobacco\nmeasures in CHRNA6 for the entire sample adjusted for\nrace. The tobacco positive factor showed an association with\nassociation was also seen in the Caucasian group (P \u00bc 0.05)\nbut not in the Hispanic sample (Table 3, bottom). There\nwere no significant associations with any of the alcohol\nmeasures (data not shown).\nHaplotype structure in CADD\nThe r2 values for the four SNPs within CHRNB3 and three\nSNPs within CHRNA6 were calculated using the Haploview\nprogram (29). Figure 1 shows the block structure for both\nCHRNB3 and CHRNA6 for the full sample, Caucasians and\nHispanics, using the Gabriel 95% confidence interval and a\nminor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.04. In the full sample, a\nhaplotype block was assigned to all four of the CHRNB3\nblock was assigned to two of the CHRNA6 SNPs, with r2 esti-\nmates ranging from 0.91 to 1.0. These block structures are\nsimilar to those available at HapMap for Caucasians. In\nCHRNB3, there is a large block across the 50 end of the\ngene, but no LD structure is given for the 30 end, likely\nbecause most of the SNPs in that region are quite rare so it\nmay not be able to be calculated with reliability. For\nCHRNA6, there are a few different putative blocks depending\non the algorithm used, as seen in Figure 1.\nHaplotype analysis in CADD\nCHRNB3. Haplotypes with a frequency less than 1% were\nexcluded. The b-coefficients for the quantitative traits are\nlinear regression estimates, while for binary traits, an odds\nratio can be obtained by taking the exponent of the\nb-coefficients. The omnibus test compares each estimated\nhaplotype while controlling all others.\nTable 5 shows the omnibus results of the separate haplotype\nanalysis of the four SNPs in CHRNB3 and the three SNPs in\nCHRNA6.

There\nwas suggestive evidence for an association with the\nfactor. The most robust results appeared to be with the two\nwhich consistently showed significance in the Caucasian\nsubgroup. This may be related to the fact that the other two\nCHRNB3 SNPs are relatively rare, providing less power to\ndetect an effect and that SNPs genotyped for the 30 end of\nthe gene have not completely saturated LD in that region. It\nappears that the A\u00adA alleles in these two SNPs act overall\nto reduce subjective responses, while the G\u00adG alleles are\nassociated with increasing response (i.e. answering `yes' to\none of the items on the questionnaire).\nThere were no significant associations between the patterns\nof use phenotypes for either tobacco or alcohol and the\nCHRNB3 or CHRNA6 SNPs. However, since the three sub-\njective factors themselves are highly associated with tobacco\ndependence, it is possible that subjective effects may act as\na mediator between the genotype and dependence.\nIn the Add Health sample, only four SNPs, the two\nCHRNB3 SNPs with the most robust results in the CADD\nSolid evidence for an association with all three of the puta-\ntively associated SNPs was detected using a PC approach\nincorporating nine subjective effects items. Secondary ana-\nlyses examining the correlation of individual items suggest\nthat `dizziness,' `pleasurable buzz or rush,' and `relaxed'\nare subjective effects that contribute significantly to the\nassociation of all three SNPs. However, there may be differ-\nences in how some of the other items (coughing and unplea-\nsant sensations) are `loading' onto the two SNPs in\nCHRNB3 compared to the SNP in CHRNA6. This is in\nagreement with the pattern of results detected in the\nCADD sample, suggesting that perhaps both genes are\nimportant in mediating subjective response, and that mul-\nFigure 1.

It is clear that dopaminergic\nneurons in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), particularly\nthose that originate in the ventral tegmental area and terminate\nin the nucleus accumbens play vital roles in regulating reward\nsystems in the brain (33,34). Rats and monkeys will actively\npress a lever or perform an operant response to obtain stimu-\nlation from electrodes implanted in the MFB. The rewarding\neffects of MFB stimulation are enhanced by virtually all\ndrugs of abuse, including nicotine, and are attenuated by\ndoses of dopamine receptor antagonists that do not disrupt\nbehavior (35). These findings are consistent with the obser-\nvations that pretreatment with dopamine receptor antagonists\nwill decrease intravenous self-administration of nicotine in\nrats (36). It may be that the significant associations that\nwere detected between the CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 genetic\nmarkers and subjective effects reflect influences of a6/\nb3-containing receptors on the major brain reward pathways.\nPotential function of the CHRNB3 and CHRNA6\nstudied SNPs\nUsing the publicly available program Transcription Element\nSearch System (TESS; URL: http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/\ntess), we investigated the putative transcription factors that\ncould bind to the genomic regions of the two CHRNB3\nSNPs implicated in this study. The 50-UTR region of the\nCHRNB3 (exon 1) displayed a rich variety of putative tran-\nscription factor binding sites, and the rs4950 SNP located in\nthis region appears to be in close proximity to the binding\nview of these potential transcriptional activation-binding\nsites surrounding the variations examined in the CHRNB3\nlocus, it is possible to speculate that these SNPs may have\nan effect on the expression of the b3 receptor subunits. For\nmatch to a COUP-TF1 factor, a retinoic acid response factor\nThe significance of these results is unknown, but one possi-\nbility is that nAChR subunit gene expression may be modu-\nlated by retinoic acid-mediated actions, for which there is\nStrengths and limitations\nThere are several strengths and limitations to this study. Both\nsamples included large samples. A wide range of information\nabout smoking and alcohol behaviors were collected, allowing\ncomprehensive analyses in the original sample.

While we did not correct for multiple\ntesting, all significant P-values were derived from empirical\ntests based on 500 permutations. However, given the fact\nthat we were able to replicate the association with three\nspecific SNPs and early subjective response to nicotine in a\nTable 5.

Single marker analysis results for Add Health\nSNP Gene Power P-value Heritability\ncompletely separate population-based sample, the issue of\nmultiple testing in the first sample is addressed.\nIn addition, this study relied on retrospective reports of\ninitial subjective responses to tobacco or alcohol among\nthose who had already met frequency of use criterion.\nHowever, many studies have shown that adolescent self-\nreports of substance use are reliable and valid (39,40).\nSummary\nWe found evidence for association between allelic variants in\nthe CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 genes and early subjective reac-\ntions to tobacco use in a selected sample and in an indepen-\ndently ascertained population-based sample. The PC analysis\nused in the Add Health study suggests that three individual\nitems (dizziness, pleasurable buzz or rush and relaxed) are\nmajor contributors to the association with these genes.\nHowever, since the three subjective effects factors identified\nin the first sample are highly correlated with each other (P\n, 0.001), it suggests that strong reactions from tobacco use\nin general are likely to be associated with these genes. This\nis consistent with our previous finding of an association\nbetween an SNP in the CHRNB2 gene and alcohol subjective\nresponse in this same population (20).\nThe results from this study add to the growing literature\nexamining the role of nicotinic receptors and nicotine depen-\ndence phenotypes. There have been previous reports of associ-\nations between CHRNA4 haplotypes and smoking-related\nphenotypes (20\u00ad22), and limited evidence for an association\nwith CHRNB2 (20,25). However, the recent findings from a\nlarge genome wide association (27) and candidate gene\nstudy (28) have provided additional support for the importance\nof these receptors and nicotine dependence. Future studies\nshould include a more in-depth analysis of these genes by\nre-sequencing to identify novel SNPs and provide better cov-\nerage of the full variation in the region. Ultimately, molecular\napproaches aimed at understanding how these variants may (or\nmay not) affect gene function will be necessary to improve our\nunderstanding of the complex genetic interactions contributing\nto tobacco use behaviors.\nSubjects (Center for Antisocial Drug Dependence \u00ad CADD)\nOne thousand and fifty six individuals were drawn from the\nCADD family, twin and adoption samples. Adolescents in\ntreatment for substance abuse and delinquency were recruited\nfrom the Colorado Adolescent Substance Abuse family study,\na study of the familial transmission of substance abuse and\nassociated psychopathology. Unselected adolescents were\nrecruited from the Colorado Twin Registry, a community-\nbased sample of twins living in Colorado, and the Colorado\nAdoption Project, an ongoing, longitudinal adoption study of\nthe genetic and environmental influences on behavioral, cogni-\ntive and emotional development (41).\nTwenty-six percent of the sample was drawn from clinical\ntreatment centers, whereas the remainder was ascertained\nfrom community based centers. All subjects were between\nthe ages of 17 and 21, and only one subject per family was\nincluded in this study.\nSubjects (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth \u00ad Add Health)\nAll subjects were selected from the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add Health is an\nongoing nationally representative probability based sample\nof adolescents in the United States. The current analyses\nwere conducted among respondents in the sibling-pairs sub-\nsample, for which phenotypic data and DNA were available.\nin the final analyses. Information regarding the study design,\nsampling strategy and collection of DNA within this sample\nis available elsewhere (42). Study protocols were approved\nby Intuitional Review Boards (NC and CO, USA), and sub-\njects provided written informed consent.\nAssessments\nAll CADD subjects completed the Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module (43), an\nassessment valid for adolescents (39). It asks the number of\ntimes subjects had used alcohol or tobacco. Those who\nreported meeting specified thresholds (six or more alcoholic\ndrinks in your lifetime and/or used tobacco almost every day\nfor a month) were asked follow-up questions about abuse\nand dependence symptoms. Scoring algorithms based on life-\ntime substance-related problems were used to derive the\nnumber of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-\norders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) abuse and dependence symptoms\nfor tobacco and alcohol. Subjects meeting use criteria also\nwere asked a series of twenty three questions aimed at asses-\nsing the early subjective responses to each drug (44). These\nquestions were asked as: In the period shortly after you used\ntobacco/alcohol, did it make you feel (subjective effect)?, to\nwhich subjects answered yes or no to items such as\n`depressed,' `irritable,' `mellow,' `energetic,' `sociable,'\n`anxious,' etc (20). Binary variables called `tobacco sensi-\ntivity' and `alcohol sensitivity' were created from two items\n`nauseous' and `dizzy' such that if the response is `yes' to\neither of these items it is coded as 1, otherwise it is coded\n0. In addition, a complete description of three factors\n(adverse, negative physical and positive) that were identified\nusing factor analysis of these items is described in a previous\nstudy (20). These three factors, along with the other pheno-\ntypes examined for each drug, are presented in Table 7.\nTable 7.

Subjects' ret-\nrospectively reported whether they had positive and negative\nexperiences following their first few cigarettes when they\nstarted smoking. A total of nine items (pleasant sensations,\nrelaxation, a pleasurable rush or buzz, nausea, unpleasant sen-\nsations, difficulty inhaling, heart pounding, dizziness and\ncoughing) were assessed.\nSelection of SNPs and genotyping\nCandidate polymorphisms for the CHRNA6 and CHRNB3\ngenes were identified using the Celera Discovery System data-\nbase and the public database, dbSNP (Table 1). Located on\nand has at least two alternatively spliced transcripts (Fig. 3).\nspliced into at least two different transcripts.\nCriteria for selection included validation status of the SNP\nbased on the public dbSNP database and from the Celera Dis-\ncovery System, MAF greater than 0.10 (if known), and\nlocation in the gene such that the SNPs would be approxi-\nmately evenly distributed throughout the gene. The structures\nof the CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 genes, and the SNPs selected,\nare shown in Figure 3.\nGenomic DNA was isolated from buccal cell swabs and pre-\namplified using standard methods (45). Data obtained using\nthis DNA are of high quality; these methods have been\nshown to be reliable for genotyping (46). TaqManw assays\nfor allelic discrimination (Applied Biosystems) were used to\ndetermine SNP genotypes, per instructions of the manufacturer\ninstruments. We genotyped the 1056 subjects in the CADD\njects in the Add Health sample for four SNPs (rs4950,\nStatistical analysis (CADD)\nThe twenty-three items assessing the subjective responses to\nalcohol and tobacco were subjected to initial PC factor analy-\nsis using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS, v. 9.1) PROC\nFACTOR command as described previously (20). Three\nfactors were retained and labeled on the basis of similar symp-\ntoms: adverse (e.g. depressed and paranoid), negative physical\n(e.g. dizzy and nauseous), and positive (e.g. energetic and\nsociable) based on the labels used by others (47).\nThe r2 values between all SNP markers, MAFs and tests for\nHardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium were calculated using Haplo-\nview (29). WHAP was utilized to test the effects of individual\nSNPs in a linear regression-based test of association with quan-\ntitative phenotypes (http://www.broad.mit.edu/personal/shaun/\nwhap/). Within WHAP haplotypes were also estimated using\nSNPHAP (http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/clayton/software/)\nand simultaneously tested for association (48). We found that\nhaplotypes assigned by WHAP (SNPHAP) and those assigned\nwere corrected for ethnicity. In WHAP, the three largest ethni-\ncity groups, Caucasian, Hispanic and African American, were\ndummy-coded as three covariates that were included in the\nregression model. Since there was strong evidence for differ-\nences in individual SNP frequencies between ethnic groups,\nas well as differences in haplotype frequencies, results from a\nprimary analysis of the full sample, followed by results of ana-\nlyses of the two largest ethnic groups, Caucasians and Hispa-\nnics, are shown. All reported significant P-values are\nempirical values obtained from conducting 500 permutations,\nbut have not been corrected for multiple testing, although all\nof the phenotypes are highly correlated.\nStatistical analysis (Add Health)\nThe statistical package FBAT-PC (50) was used to analyze the\nfour SNPs genotyped in the Add Health sample with the nine\nsubjective response items. This approach is based on the com-\nbined linkage-association analysis originally described by\nFulker et al. (51) and extends it to incorporate a traditional\nPC approach whereby a multivariate series of correlated phe-\nnotypes are reduced to one, univariate phenotype for testing.\nFigure 3. Schematic of CHRNA6 and CHRNB3. Boxes represent exons separated by intronic regions in each gene. In the CADD sample, four SNPs were gen-\notyped in CHRNB3, with their rs numbers and gene locations indicated, where bp provides the number of nucleotide base pairs between each SNP. Three SNPs\nwere genotyped in CHRNA6.\nIn the context of genetic applications, a lesser-known PC\napproach involves maximizing the heritability (52). Using\nquantitative traits, this translates to maximizing the variance\nof the phenotype that is explained by a particular marker\n(i.e. the marker-specific heritability). Extensions of this\napproach were developed for family based samples (49) in\nthe genetic association framework in FBAT-PC where a phe-\nnotype (a maximally heritable PC) is constructed first using\nthe between-family information and the phenotype is sub-\nsequently tested using the within-family information. In this\nstudy of the Add Health sample, a specific a priori hypothesis\nabout which SNPs would be most significant with a subjective\neffects phenotype was predefined based on the results from the\nexploratory study in the CADD.\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported by Colorado Tobacco Research\nConflict of Interest statement.
