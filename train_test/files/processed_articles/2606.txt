Studies indicate relationships among\nmutual friends are a major influence on adolescents' risky behaviors. Social\nNetwork Analysis (SNA) can help understand friendship ties affecting individual\nadolescents' engagement in these behaviors. Moreover, a systematic literature review\ncan synthesize findings from a range of studies using SNA, as well as assess these\nstudies' methodological quality. Review findings also can help health educators and\npromoters develop more effective programs.\nObjective. This review systematically examined studies of the influence of friendship\nnetworks on adolescents' risk behaviors, which utilized SNA and the Add Health data\n(a nationally representative sample).\nMethods. We employed the Matrix Method to synthesize and evaluate 15 published\nstudies that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria, retrieved from the Add Health\nwebsite and 3 major databases (Medline, Eric, and PsycINFO). Moreover, we\nassigned each study a methodological quality score (MQS).\nResults. In all studies, friendship networks among adolescents promoted their risky\nbehaviors, including drinking alcohol, smoking, sexual intercourse, and marijuana\nuse. The average MQS was 4.6, an indicator of methodological rigor (scale: 1\u00ad9).\nConclusion. Better understanding of risky behaviors influenced by friends can be\nuseful for health educators and promoters, as programs targeting friendships might\nbe more effective. Additionally, the overall MQ of these reviewed studies was good, as\naverage scores fell above the scale's mid-point.\nSubjects Global Health, Public Health\n",

In the report, the number of adolescents who \"had\nsexual intercourse with four or more persons (15.3%)\" (Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, 2012d), and \"used chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip on school property on at least\n1 day (7.7%)\" demonstrated a general increase (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nHow to cite this article Jeon and Goodson (2015), US adolescents' friendship networks and health risk behaviors: a systematic review of\n2012e). On the other hand, the number of those who \"ever had at least one drink of alcohol\non at least 1 day\" showed a slight decrease from 72.5% to 70.8% during that time (Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, 2012a).\nBased on these data, we asked: \"What may have shaped these trends over time?\" In\nattempts to answer this question, researchers have indicated that risky health behaviors\namong adolescents are strongly influenced by their peers or friendship relationships\nthis knowledge, the literature on health risk behavior during adolescence has focused,\ntraditionally, on individual adolescent risk taking behaviors (e.g., whether adolescents\nengaged in smoking, drinking or sexual activity, as well as frequency or intensity\nof engagement) as the unit of analysis. More recently, however, advanced analytical\nmethodologies--including Social Network Analysis (SNA)--have led to the study of\npatterns in health risk behaviors influenced by peer or social contexts (e.g., friendship\nnetworks and affiliations).\nAssessing patterns has highlighted the utility of SNA for in-depth understanding of\nthe risky health behaviors among adolescents based on their relationships or interactions\nwith other peers (Ennett et al., 2006; Haas, Schaefer & Kornienko, 2010). SNA is an optimal\nresearch tool because SNA maps out relationship networks among different people in a\nsocial group context (Valente, Gallaher & Mouttapa, 2004). Additionally, utilizing SNA,\nresearchers can describe the patterns of structural connectivity using a visual analysis of\nthe networks or by generating statistical descriptions (Crnovrsanin et al., 2014). Therefore,\nSNA can help understand various risk behaviors that can be affected by other people\n(Smith & Christakis, 2008) and can help researchers assess adolescents' risky behaviors\nwithin peer networks, as well as identify the structures of friendship ties that can influence\nbehaviors.\nIn the US over the last decade, researchers have studied peer effects upon adolescents'\nhealth risk behaviors using network structure data from the National Longitudinal Study\nof Adolescent Health to Adult Health (Add Health). The Add Health study gathers data\non adolescents' health risk behaviors from a stratified sample of high schools (grades\n7\u00ad12) nationwide, thus generating representative data. Furthermore, the Add Health\ndata focus on social contexts (i.e., friendships and family relationships) that influence\nadolescents' health-related behaviors (Harris et al., 2009). Data are collected from\nin-school questionnaires and in-home interviews with adolescents, their peers, parents,\nand school administrators (Harris et al., 2009).\nSeveral researchers have analyzed the Add Health data using social network analysis,\ndemonstrating that SNA is a useful method for assessing both the structure of peer\nrelationships, and/or friendship networks (Fujimoto & Valente, 2012a; Mundt, 2011). These\nstudies indicate that either friendship ties or peer effects among adolescents can function as\ncausal factors directly influencing peers' risk behaviors such as drinking and smoking. Also,\npeer influences affect behaviors both positively and negatively, depending on adolescents'\nperceptions of friends' behaviors (Sieving et al., 2006). Despite its valuable contribution,\nresearch utilizing Add Health data varies in focus, with researchers examining many\ndifferent types of friendships and various adolescent behaviors, such as drinking, tobacco\nuse, and sexual intercourse.\nThe purpose of this study, therefore, is to answer the following questions through\nsystematically reviewing the extant literature: (1) Which risky health behaviors have been\nexamined using SNA and the Add Health data; (2) What findings have been identified in\nthis literature relevant to friendship networks' impact on adolescents' risk behaviors; and\n(3) What is the methodological quality of this body of literature?\nSystematic literature reviews contribute to a body of literature by organizing and\nassessing scientific findings to effectively demonstrate both the accuracy and reliability\nof evidenced-based information (Mullen & Ramirez, 2006; Mulrow, 1994). A long-term\ngoal of this review is to lend further validity to applying SNA as a method for studying\nadolescents' health-risk behaviors and assist future researchers in developing guidelines for\nimplementing network-based intervention programs.\nBACKGROUND\nNational data, collected every two years by the YRBS and hosted by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), report that risky behaviors including tobacco\nuse, drinking alcohol, and sexual intercourse at a young age have been health concerns for\nUS adolescents for more than 20 years. For instance, between 18 and 47% of adolescents\nin grades 9 through 12 engaged in smoking , drinking alcohol, or were involved in sexual\nThese behaviors are the main health challenges for adolescents because continued risky\nbehaviors are associated with increasing health problems. Previous studies have indicated\nthat smoking and drinking alcohol at an early age can lead to poor health, an increased risk\nfor alcoholism (Englund et al., 2008), and chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular and cancer)\n(Sawyer et al., 2007). Moreover, early sexual activity among adolescents can increase the\nrisk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (Kaestle et al., 2005) and the\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (Parillo et al., 2001).\nIn addition, researchers have reported that if adolescents are involved in a risk behavior,\nthey are more likely to engage in different risk behaviors simultaneously. Johnson et al.\n(2000), for instance, identified a correlation between tobacco use and alcohol consumption\namong adolescents. Authors found adolescents who smoke are more likely to engage in\nbinge drinking, simultaneously. Likewise, adolescents used to drinking heavily are more\nlikely also to smoke regularly.\nSexual behavior\nAdolescents who engage in unprotected sexual behaviors have a considerably higher risk of\nexperiencing an unintended pregnancy or contracting STIs, including HIV (Tapert et al.,\n2001), than those who do not engage in these behaviors. As of 2011, the YRBS reported that\nthe percentage of adolescents (grades 9 through 12) responding positively to the question\n\"ever had sexual intercourse\" was 47.4% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\n2012d). Although this percentage is high, it represents a decline: in 1991, more than half\n(54.1%) of adolescents in grades 9 through 12 reported that they had engaged in sexual\nintercourse.\nDue to its many negative health and psychosocial consequences (not the least of which\nare sexual abuse and statutory rape), having had sexual intercourse before the age of 13 is\nanother problematic behavior among adolescents. Rates for this behavior have plateaued\nAlcohol use\nIn the United States, alcohol use by adolescents is illegal (under age 21) and also remains\na public health problem because it is associated with different risk behaviors, including\ntobacco use and unprotected sexual intercourse. Data from the YRBS documents that,\nin 2011, an estimated 70.8% of adolescents reported they \"ever had at least one drink of\nalcohol on at least 1 day\" during their lifetime (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nBy 2011, 38.7% of adolescents reported that they had \"had at least one drink of alcohol\non at least 1 day\" during the 30 days before the survey (Centers for Disease Control and\nTobacco use\nSmoking is related to morbidity and mortality, and is a leading cause of chronic diseases\n(e.g., cardiac disease and vascular disease).

We searched\npublications that specifically used the Add Health data, catalogued by the website for\nthe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health in Carolina Population\nCenter at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. However, because the search engine\nin the website was limited, it became necessary to identify additional articles through\nother electronic bibliographies. We identified and retrieved, therefore, all peer-reviewed\njournal articles housed in three additional electronic databases (Medline, Eric, and\nPsycINFO), and searched using variations of MeSH terms combined with Boolean\noperators (e.g., sexual behavior, drinking behavior, adolescent, and, social network, or\nnetwork analysis). Additionally, we searched reference lists from each study, for additional\narticles. Using the Scopus database, we conducted further searches based on the first and\ncorresponding author(s)' names listed in the retrieved reports.\nSearching databases for this review initially yielded 4,455 results. Of these, 2,147 were\nidentified in the Add Health website, 2,240 in Medline, and 68 in Eric and PsycINFO.\nAfter identifying irrelevant topics and removing duplicates in an initial screening step,\nwe identified 87 relevant studies. Among these, 73 were excluded based on our criteria.\nTo be included in our review studies needed to: (1) be published in a peer-reviewed\nnetworks' influence on adolescents' risky health behaviors; (4) focus on adolescents (aged\n12 to 18 years old) in grades 7 through 12 (as these are the grades utilized in the Add\nHealth data); and (5) utilize the Add Health data. We excluded studies if (1) only abstracts\nwere published; (2) articles did not use SNA to study adolescents' risky health behaviors;\n(3) studies employed SNA, but did not utilize the Add Health data; (4) studies focused\non the relationship between friendships and adolescents risky behaviors; and (5) studies\nemployed hypothetical models or simulation modeling to examine the Add Health data.\nThus, we identified 14 articles eligible for full-text review. Moreover, we retrieved\n1 additional article through retrieved studies' reference lists, and through first and\ncorresponding author searches in Scopus. This study was published in 2001, but we\nincluded it in this review, because it met our other criteria. Finally, 15 articles met our\ninclusion criteria, and became the final sample in this review (see Fig. 1 as an adapted\nPRISMA flow diagram) (Moher et al., 2009).\nSubsequently, we employed a review matrix to organize the information extracted\nfrom each article. The review matrix (see Table 1) included information for each study\non: authors, sample, focal variables (behaviors studied), purpose, use of theory, statistical\nanalyses, key findings, and suggesting prevention/intervention programs.\nFigure 1 PRISMA flow diagram of reviewed studies.\nWe assessed each article's methodological quality employing a numerical score that\nreflects specific features of a study's design and analyses (Goodson, Buhi & Dunsmore,\n2006; Jeon, Chen & Goodson, 2012). In this review, each study received a methodological\nquality score (MQS), reflecting its performance on the criteria outlined in Table 2, to\ninclude: whether studies examined a single or multiple risk behaviors; if studies utilized an\nestablished theoretical framework; if the report contained visualizations of the networks;\nif the report presented visualizations of the analysis; if the study tested specific hypothesis;\nif the report explained the types of data analysis employed; and whether researchers made\nrecommendations for developing programs, based on their findings. The scores ranged\nfrom 1 to 9 with a higher value representing better methodological quality.\nRESULTS\nStudies' characteristics\nFifteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = 14) were conducted in the\nUS, and one paper, in France.

These studies examined the frequency of sexual\nintercourse as being influenced by close friends. Researchers used the questions: \"Have you\never had sexual intercourse?\"; \"In what month and year did you have sexual intercourse\nmost recently?\"; or \"If you had sexual intercourse, your friends would respect you more\"\nfrom a section on \"Motivations to Engage in Risky Behaviors.\"\nTwo studies (Clark & Loh\u00b4\njuana use as influenced by peer groups. In this study, researchers used the questionnaire\nitem: \"During the past 30 days, how many times did you use marijuana?\" In these studies,\nauthors examined the frequency of marijuana use as influenced by adolescents' friendships.\nEven though the Add Health questionnaires have items addressing two different\nbehaviors in tandem (e.g., sexual intercourse + drinking; and sexual intercourse + drugs),\nnone of the reviewed studies examined more than one behavior at a time.\n(2) What research findings have been identified in the literature relevant to friendship\nnetworks' impact on adolescents' risk behaviors?\nAlcohol use\nAs mentioned previously, eight reviewed studies investigated the relationship between\ndrinking alcohol and friendship networks (drinking frequency and amount of drinking).\nFor instance, the study conducted by Fujimoto & Valente (2012a) examined how various\nfriendship types influenced adolescents' substance use, including drinking (frequency).\nAuthors classified three types of friendships: mutual friendships, directional friendships,\nand intimate friendships (see Fig. 2 for diagrams of the three types of friendships examined\nby Fujimoto & Valente, 2012a). A mutual friendship was defined as reciprocated friends\n(knowing each other as friends). A directional friendship was defined as an unreciprocated\nnomination that originated either from an ego or from an alter (i.e., ego-nominating\nfriend and alter-nominating friend). An intimate friendship was defined as closest or best\nfriends who were being first nominated (Fig. 2). These three friendship types were based on\nfriendship nominations that students were asked to make as they nominated five best male\nfriends and five best female friends from the Add Health data.\nFujimoto & Valente (2012a) found mutual friends were more likely to influence their\nfriends' drinking behavior (frequency) than a directional friendship in the previous year\n(AOR = 2.07; p < 0.001). Moreover, in the directional friendships among unreciprocated\nalters, the authors found ego-nominating friends (Fig. 2) were slightly more influential in\nadolescents' drinking behavior than alter-nominating friends (AOR = 2.02; p < 0.001).\nParadoxically, for the intimate relationships (Fig. 2), the study indicated that non-best\nfriends were more likely to influence adolescents' past year drinking than best friends (AOR\nFujimoto & Valente (2013) also examined the influence on adolescents' drinking (and\ndrinking frequency) of friends and affiliated members in sports and club activities.\nAdolescents were asked in which school organized clubs or sports they participated. Based\non this information, authors divided activities into 12 types of sports and clubs, such as\nplaying chess, studying French, and basketball.\nMoreover, Fujimoto & Valente (2013) categorized friendships as (1) all nominated\nfriends (adolescent nominated the alter as a friend, the equivalent to \"directional\nfriendships\" in Fig. 2), and (2) only reciprocated friends (both adolescents mutually called\neach other friends) (Fig. 2). Fujimoto & Valente (2013) then created affiliation models\nbased on nominated friends (i.e., General affiliation--the influence from all members'\nfriendships; Nominated-friends' affiliation--the influence from adolescents who were\nnominated as friends; and Nonfriends' affiliation--the influence from adolescents who\nwere not nominated friends). Affiliation models based on reciprocated friends were\nalso developed (i.e., General affiliation--the influence from all members' friendships;\nReciprocated-friends' affiliation--the influence from adolescents who had at least\none reciprocated friend; and Nonreciprocated-friends' affiliation--the influence of a\nnonreciprocated friend).\nIn the nominated friends' general affiliation model, sports members influenced adoles-\ncents' drinking and frequency of drinking (AOR = 1.20; p < 0.05), and club members\nonly affected adolescents' drinking (AOR = 1.46; p < 0.01). This study additionally\nFigure 2 Diagrams of the three types of friendships examined by Fujimoto & Valente (2012a). (A)\nMutual/Reciprocated friendships.

In the nominated-friends' affiliation\nmodel, this study indicated club members significantly influenced adolescents' drinking\nnonfriends' affiliation model, club members who were not friends were more likely\nto affect drinking and drinking frequency of adolescents (AOR = 1.37; p < 0.01). In\nthe reciprocated friends' affiliation model, sports members who were mutual friends\nwith adolescents significantly influenced drinking and frequent drinking (AOR = 1.16;\np < 0.01). Moreover, club members who were mutual friends were more influential\nin adolescents' drinking and frequency of drinking (AOR = 1.22; p < 0.001) than the\nresults based on the nominated-friends affiliation model (p < 0.01). Additionally, in the\nnonreciprocated friends' affiliation model, club members significantly influenced drinking\nUniquely, this study showed that club members who have no friendship ties with others\ninfluenced other adolescents' drinking behavior within the affiliation friendship networks.\nThis finding can be explained by the fact that club members do not need to be intimate\nfriends to be connected to each other, because they share many common interests and\nbehaviors, even if they are not friends.\nIn another study, Jaccard, Blanton & Dodge (2005) evaluated how close friends influence\nadolescents' binge drinking. In this study, close friends were defined as those who were\nnominated by adolescents. Authors found a statistical significance in the behavioral\nsimilarity (binge drinking) between adolescents and their close friends ((unstandardized\nregression coefficient) 0.15; p < 0.006). Additionally, the study demonstrated that when\nadolescents' drinking behavior changed between Wave I (1995) and Wave II (1996) of data\ncollection, their close friends' binge drinking also changed accordingly during the same\ntime period ((unstandardized regression coefficient) 0.12; p < 0.05).\nThe other five studies showed similar findings, indicating that friendships that matter,\namong adolescents, were more likely to exert influence upon adolescents' drinking\nbehavior. For instance, among these five studies, Clark & Loh\u00b4\nparticipation in drinking alcohol by the male peer group in the same school year increases\nby 25%, the adolescent's probability of drinking alcohol increases 4.5%\" (p. 773). Likewise,\nthe study by Ali & Dwyer (2010) showed that if the number of close friends who drink\nincreased by 10%, other adolescents' drinking would increase by 2%. Authors also found\n\"a 10% increase in drinking among grade-level peers ...associated with a 4% increase in\nindividual drinking\" (p. 340).\nTobacco use\nSeven of the fifteen studies reported friendship influence on adolescents' frequency of\nsmoking. For instance, Ali & Dwyer (2009) categorized peer network as not only close\nfriends who were nominated by the adolescents, but also those who were classmates and\nothers from the same grade in school. A key finding from the study was that \"having\nup to 25 percentage of close friends as smokers increases the probability of smoking by\n5% ...whereas being in a class containing up to 25% smokers increases the likelihood of\nIn another study, Fujimoto & Valente (2012b) investigated the influence of peer networks\non adolescent's substance use (smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol), based on\ncontagion mechanisms, in terms of cohesion and structural equivalence. Cohesion referred\nto relationships within a network, for which there are direct ties or exchange of influence.\nStructural equivalence referred to relationships among adolescents who occupy similar\npositions as others within friendship networks (see Fig. 3 for diagrams of cohesion and\nstructural equivalence in a network). Authors defined peers as those who were nominated\nby friends. In their analysis, they utilized a network exposure model to assess both cohesion\nand structural equivalence measuring peers' risk taking in terms of social distances (at four\nsteps away from other adolescents--friends of friends of friends of friends). The results\nindicated \"the odds ratios for cohesion exposures to smoking were statistically significant\nup to distance two (but not significant for distances greater than two) with the highest\nThese findings suggest that direct or indirect friends (a friend or the friend of a friend)\nwere more likely to influence adolescents' smoking behavior than friends at distance three\nor four (the friend(1)-of-a-friend(2)-of-a-friend(3), or the friend(1)-of-a-friend(2)-of-a-\nfriend(3)-of-a-friend(4)). Moreover, the researchers found that for structural equivalence\nexposure to smoking, \"...exposure effects were statistically significant for all distances with\nthe highest in magnitude at distance one (OR = 1.99; p < 0.001), followed by distance\nadolescents, who were one and two steps away in the network structure, were more likely to\naffect adolescents' smoking behavior than adolescents at three or four steps away in terms\nof social distances.\nThe other five studies showed similar results, namely, that various close friendships,\nsuch as best, popular, and mutual friends, were more likely to influence adolescents'\nsmoking behavior than non-close friends. For instance, Alexander et al. (2001) indicated\nthat if adolescents have best friends who are cigarette smokers, those adolescents'\nprobability of smoking increases two fold. Similarly, the study conducted by Pollard et\nal. (2010) demonstrated that \"...a greater number of one's best friends (who) smoked, and\nincreases in the perceived number of best friends who smoked over a one-year period, were\nassociated with greater odds of an adolescent being [a smoker]...\" (p. 682).\nSexual intercourse\nThree studies focused on how adolescents' friendships influence each other's sexual\nbehavior (specifically, intercourse). For instance, Sieving et al. (2006) classified close friends\nas those who were being nominated. Close friends were based on friendship nominations\nby students who were asked to nominate best male and female friends. Researchers found\nFigure 3 Diagrams of cohesion and structural equivalence in a network. (A) Cohesion: C has a direct\ntie with A and is influenced by A. The relationships between A\u00adB and A\u00adD are not cohesive, because the\nties are indirect and there is no exchange of influence. (B) Structural equivalence: B\u00adC and C\u00adD are\nstructurally equivalent ties, because the individuals occupy the same position in the network.\nthat \"...for every 1% increase in sexually experienced friends at Wave I (1995), the odds\nIn another study, Ali & Dwyer (2011) defined peer group as not only close friends who\nwere nominated by adolescents, but also those who were classmates and others from the\nsame grade in school.

They\nfound \"...of target individuals whose closest friends engaged in sexual activity across the\ntwo waves (Waves I and II), 56% also engaged in sexual intercourse across the waves\"\nAll reviewed studies examining sexual behaviors examined single behaviors; examined\ntwo or more behaviors in tandem, such as sexual activity with alcohol consumption, even\nthough the Add Health data contains this information.\nMarijuana use\nAmong the 15 studies reviewed, two examined the influence of friendship networks on\nadolescent's marijuana use. Tucker et al. (2014) examined how different types of friendships\n(i.e., friend reciprocity, friend popularity, and popularity difference) affected adolescents'\nmarijuana use in two saturated schools samples (i.e., school 1 and 2) at Wave I and\nII. Friend reciprocity was defined as mutual friends (being nominated by each other\nas friends). Friend popularity was defined based on \"the total number of friendship\nnominations received by a nominated friend at a given wave...\" (p. 68). Popularity\ndifference was defined as \"the difference in number of friend nominations received...\" (p.\n68). Researchers found that two friendships (i.e., reciprocity and friend popularity) were\nmore likely to influence adolescents' marijuana use. Regarding friend reciprocity, authors\nfound \"in school 1, there was a significant positive interaction between friends' influence\non marijuana use and friend reciprocity...adolescents tended to adopt the (marijuana) use\nbehaviors of their mutual friends...\" (p. 72). For friend popularity, the researchers found\nthat there was only statistical significance in school 2, indicating popular friends were more\nlikely to influence adolescents' marijuana use.\nThe second study, conducted by Clark & Loh\u00b4\neac (2007), examined peer group effects on\nadolescents' alcohol, smoking and marijuana use. However, in this study, authors did not\nfind that friendships influenced adolescents' marijuana use.\n(3) What is the methodological quality of this body of literature?\nAs previously mentioned, we assigned a methodological quality score (MQS--with a\npossible range of 1 to 9 points) to each reviewed study. Table 2 presents the distribution of\nreviewed studies in terms of the MQS criteria. The average MQS was 4.6 (SD = 1.24), with\nactual scores ranging from 2 to 7 points. Among the 15 studies, seven (46.7%) scored below\n4.5. The main problems affecting studies scoring below average were lack of visuals for the\nnetworks and/or for the analyses.\nEleven reviewed studies (73.3%) focused on studying a single behavior (most com-\nmonly, smoking or drinking). Four studies (26.7%) analyzed two or more behaviors, such\nas alcohol and tobacco use, but each behavior was examined separately. None examined\ntwo or more risk behaviors simultaneously (e.g., sexual intercourse with drug or alcohol\nconsumption).\nRegarding using or adopting theoretical frameworks, while the majority (10 studies)\nemployed a theoretical framework, five studies (33.3%) failed to do so. Among the\n10 studies employing a theoretical framework, six (40%) provided some theoretical\nexplanation or rationale and four studies (26.7%) presented a scientific or behavioral\ntheory: Social Learning Theory and Social Comparison Theory. Eight studies (53.3%)\ndid not test a hypothesis. Seven reports (46.7%) tested a proposed hypothesis such as\n\"...influence from mutual friendships has stronger influence on adolescent drinking and\nsmoking than non-mutual friendships\" (Fujimoto & Valente, 2012a, p. 137) or \"adolescents\nwith higher proportions of sexually experienced close friends are more likely to initiate\nsexual intercourse than others\" (Sieving et al., 2006, p. 14).\nOnly one reviewed study (6.7%) provided visual graphics for the networks examined,\nwhile four studies (26.7%) provided illustrations for how friendship influences egos\nand their alters. Fourteen studies (93.3%) employed and reported both descriptive and\ninferential statistics in their data analysis. One study (6.7%) reported only inferential\nstatistics. More than half of the reviewed studies (66.7%) made recommendations for\nprevention or intervention programs, based on their network-related findings. Lakon,\nHipp & Timberlake (2010), for instance, propose in their study: \"These friendship pairs\ncould be targeted for a school-based intervention, either to help both adolescents in a pair\nremain nonsmokers or so that they could help each other stop smoking\" (p. 1226\u00ad1227).\nDISCUSSION\nThis systematic review consolidated a segment of the current research employing SNA\nfor studying adolescents' health risk behaviors. Specifically, we synthesized findings from\nnetwork analyses based on the Add Health data, and assessed each analysis' methodological\nquality (presented in Table 2).\nIn this review, fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies found that,\nin general, various types of friendships exert influence upon adolescents' health risk\nbehaviors. Across reviewed studies, having friends engaging in risky behaviors is a negative\npredictor of adolescents' healthy behaviors or a positive predictor of risky ones.\nMore than half of the reviewed studies examined friendship network effects on\nadolescents' risky behaviors either at a single point in time, or over time. Based on these\nstudies, we learn that individuals who have friends or are linked to friendship networks\nexhibiting risky behaviors (e.g., smoking or alcohol consumption) are at increased risk for\nengaging in these behaviors both initially, and over time.\nThese findings from the Add Health data mirror results from a longitudinal study\nconducted in Finland. Mercken et al. (2012) assessed the relationship between substance\nuse (alcohol consumption) and friendship networks among Finnish adolescents at\ndifferent data points (i.e., time 1, time 2, time 3, and time 4). The results demonstrated\nthat friends with risky drinking behaviors influenced adolescents to engage in similar\ndrinking behaviors over time (between time 1 and 2). These results indicate, therefore, that\nSNA can account for the role of time in risky behaviors with more nuanced information\nthan traditional longitudinal designs (Rothenberg et al., 1998).\nThe reviewed studies highlighted that SNA can help researchers better understand the\ncomplex mechanisms underlying the connection between friendships among adolescents\nand risky behaviors. Even studies that utilize SNA but are not included in this review\nmention SNA is a helpful tool for understanding adolescent behaviors as an outcome\nof social relationships, as well as for understanding changes in behaviors and friendship\nSmith & Christakis, 2008), because friendship ties and behaviors occur inside the structure\nof dynamic interpersonal relationships among adolescents (Steglich, Snijders & Pearson,\n2010). For instance, adolescents may choose friends having similar behaviors as theirs, or\nthey may change their behaviors to develop new friendships or to match the behavior of\nexisting friends. SNA, thus, can help explain peer selection, as well as lead to modeling\nchanges in behaviors as a function of ties over time (Christakis & Fowler, 2007; Luke &\nIn addition, SNA also allows better understanding of phenomena that cannot be\nadequately studied with traditional linear analyses. In particular, linear analysis cannot\nprovide measures of structural linkages among individuals located inside a network, as\na supplement to measures of an individuals' health risk behaviors. Using SNA, however,\nresearchers are able to account for, and examine network dynamics and structure, such\nas density (i.e., the number of actual connections as a function of the total possible\nconnections in a network) or degree (i.e., the number of ties, in and out, with other\nindividuals in a network) (Valente, 2010), the impact of a network structure upon\nhealth behaviors, as well as the role of individuals as a function of their placement in\nthe network. Moreover, SNA can create visualizations, depicting ties among individuals\n(Scott & Carrington, 2011; Valente, 2010), showing how an individual's position may act as\na mediator for positive or negative behavioral influences. For instance, the reviewed study\ncarried by Kreager & Haynie (2011) found that \"indirect ties to a drinking peer through\na romantic partner are associated with significantly higher future drinking than is the\ndrinking of more proximal friends or romantic partners\" (p. 756).\nWhen SNA is employed in the study of health behaviors, it can not only identify\nstructural and relational factors associated with behavioral changes in individuals or\ngroups, but also provide information that can be used for developing effective network-\nbased intervention programs to reduce health risk behaviors. In a study conducted by\nValente et al. (2007), for instance, the authors compared changes in adolescents' substance\nuse (i.e., cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine) between a control group receiving\nan evidenced-based prevention program and a network group receiving peer-leader\nintervention as a network prevention program. The results indicated that using a\npeer-leader program targeting the network was more effective in reducing substance use\nafter a one-year follow-up assessment.\nWhen assessed for overall methodological quality, the mean MQS for the studies\nreviewed herein was 4.6, an indicator of good quality relative to our seven criteria (a\ntheoretical range of 1\u00ad9 points). Although the body of evidence we reviewed exhibits good\nmethodological quality, because scores fell above the theoretical mid-point of our scale, not\nsupplying illustrative visualizations showing the connections among individuals in net-\nworks, the absence of theoretical frameworks, and not examining two or more behaviors in\ntandem, affected the overall quality of this body of research, vis-`\na-vis our criteria.\nOne common weakness was the absence of either graphs depicting the networks or visu-\nalizations that could help understand the proposed analyses. Providing visualizations can\nimprove the clarity of, and highlight structural relationships within networks, more easily\n(Crnovrsanin et al., 2014). For instance, Mundt (2011) depicted a visual network of alcohol\ninitiators and alcohol abstainers from their sample. The graphics the author provided help\nus understand not only the relationship among these adolescents, but guide us to a better\nunderstanding of the network measures themselves (i.e., differences between networks'\ndensity and degree are made more meaningful, when accompanied by a visual aid).\nAnother methodological weakness we identified was the reviewed studies' lack of a\ntheoretical framework to examine adolescents' risky behaviors. The absence of a theoretical\nframework in research can lead to overlooking of salient factors and examining spurious\nones. Conversely, using a theoretical framework can facilitate identifying possible causes\n(Goodson, 2010; Green, 2000). Theory helps develop programs, and findings from studies\nthat use theory can be useful for determining the type of intervention that best suits risky\nbehaviors. Understanding of social networks is growing, based on the increasing amounts\nof data being collected. Nonetheless, in order to develop effective interventions that target\nadolescents' networks, theoretical explanations of the mechanisms affecting behaviors\nwithin a network become even more important. Using available theories of networks,\nadolescent development, and structural influences on behavior, researchers can shed light\nupon the data they are now collecting and, over time, build the knowledge-base on this\ntopic.\nA further weakness of the reviewed studies was examining behaviors, individually.\nStudies focusing on two or more behaviors in tandem would allow for a better holistic\nunderstanding of the role of friendship networks in the dynamics of adolescents' risky\nbehaviors, given that risk behaviors rarely happen in isolation. There is abundant\nevidence documenting adolescents' engagement in multiple risky behaviors carried out\nsimultaneously. In the review conducted by Cooper (2002), for instance, the author found\nthat college students who drink alcohol were also involved in having sexual intercourse.\nSimilar to Cooper's review (2002), a study from Johnson et al. (2000) also identified that\nwhen teens engage in high levels of alcohol consumption, they also were more likely to\nsmoke.\nSimilar to the reviewed studies, this review also carries important limitations. First,\ndespite our attempt to locate all studies employing SNA utilizing the Add Health data, it\nis possible our search did not capture all existing studies, given that we limited the search\nto published reports. Second, to assess the methodological quality of this literature, we\nadopted and created the MQS criteria based on previous systematic reviews. The precise\ncriteria we use in this review, therefore, have not been tested for their ability to generate\nvalid and reliable assessments and could, therefore, be biased.\nDespite these limitations, this systematic review demonstrated the important role of\nfriends and friendship networks on adolescents' risky behaviors and the benefit of a SNA\napproach for better understanding of this role and its complex mechanisms. Moreover,\nthis review is unique not only because it lends further validity to SNA as a method, but\nalso because it synthesizes findings from high quality studies based on a national sample.\nIdentifying how friendships or friendship networks function as pathways for adopting\nrisky behaviors can also help health educators and promoters to design guidelines for\nnetwork intervention programs to reduce adolescents' risky behaviors.\nFunding\nThe authors declare there was no funding for this work.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors declare there are no competing interests.\nAuthor Contributions\n\u00b7 Kwon Chan Jeon conceived and designed the experiments, performed the experiments,\nanalyzed the data, contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools, wrote the paper,\nprepared figures and/or tables.\n\u00b7 Patricia Goodson conceived and designed the experiments, reviewed drafts of the paper.\nSupplemental Information\nSupplemental information for this article can be found online at http://dx.doi.org/\nREFERENCES\nAlexander C, Piazza M, Mekos D, Valente TW. 2001.
