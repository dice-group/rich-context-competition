This\narticle responds to those views and argues that evolutionary psychology shows great\npromise in contributing to the explanation of contemporary ethnic identities and\nethnic conflict. The authors argue that an evolutionary psychology approach\nembraces research conducted through conventional social science approaches, helps\nto complete explanations of the proximate causes of ethnic conflict, and can recast\nthought and encourage new areas of research about important issues in the ethnic\nconflict field. Illustrations are provided in support of each of these points. Some of\nthese arguments have been heard before with respect to the general role of\nevolutionary theory in explaining social phenomena but they are arguments we think\nbear repeating and illustrating in the context of the study of ethnic phenomena.\nBefore examining the ways that evolutionary psychology can contribute to social\nscience explanation of ethnic phenomena, we summarize the general evolutionary\npsychology approach to the study of social behavior.\nKeywords: affective intelligence model, Balkans, Bosnia, ethnic conflict, fitness\ncliff, inclusive fitness, intolerance, kinship bonding, martyr, nationalism, proximate\ncause, Rwanda, social norms, threat\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\nEvolutionary Psychology Approach\nAn elaborate description and defense of the general evolutionary psychology\napproach to the study of social science phenomena is found in Tooby and Cosmides\n \nphenomena and ethnic conflict are human social phenomena there is no obvious\nreason why evolutionary psychology cannot be applied to their study and, indeed,\nample reason why it makes sense to do so. Van den Berghe (1981), Johnson, (1986)\nand Salter (2000), for example, have strongly suggested that psychological\nmechanisms revolving around kinship bonding are pivotal in generating ethnic\nbehaviors.\nMore broadly, an evolutionary psychology approach posits that, through the\nprocess of natural selection, humans have acquired a diverse array of mental\nmechanisms. Each one is designed to respond to the demands of a specific\nenvironmental problem or task that is relevant to the survival and reproductive\nsuccess of the individual and has been repeatedly encountered by humans in the\nenvironment of evolutionary adaptation. Persistent exposure to a particular\nenvironmental problem over large numbers of generations results in the evolution of a\nwell-defined adaptation in the form of a psychological mechanism.\nIn general, evolved psychological mechanisms are thought to operate in an\nalgorithmic fashion. Scanning and filtering functions of a mechanism identify\nenvironmental stimuli that constitute a particular environmental problem or task and\nelicit specific emotions and behaviors that address the problem or task in ways that\ncontribute to its adaptive resolution. Evolved psychological mechanisms are thought\nto exist for addressing innumerable problems and tasks such as: mate choice, hunting,\nalliance formation, and reputation-building, to name only a few. Among the\nproblems and tasks relevant to ethnic phenomena are: group bonding and cooperation\nfor both benign and malevolent purposes, and responses to the menace of group threat\nand conflict.\nEmbracing Conventional Research\nResearch that adopts an evolutionary psychological approach can be quite\ncomplementary with traditional social science research that addresses these same\nethnic phenomena. When developed insights of evolutionary psychology are\nbrought into the analysis explanations can be expanded and given more meaning. To\nthe point, an especially crucial aspect of the explanation of ethnic phenomena\ninvolves the description of human nature. The most common way of facilitating\nexplanations among traditional researchers is to adopt ad hoc and implied\nassumptions about human nature and to investigate causal factors consistent only with\nthose assumptions. In contrast, evolutionary psychologists do not take \"nature\" for\ngranted and, instead, hypothesize about the relevant mechanisms of the human brain\nthat come into play as humans engage in ethnic behaviors. They bring novel\nelements to an explanation by fleshing out hypotheses about the possible connections\namong environmental stimuli, mental activity, and actual behaviors that generations\nof adaptations have given us. Evolutionary psychology approaches synthesize\ntraditional dichotomies between so-called nature and nurture by acknowledging the\ninteraction between environment and culture on the one hand and the genetically-\n \ninspired mechanisms and molds of human social behaviors on the other. Ultimately,\nbehaviors result from these interactions as environmental events trigger mental\nmechanisms, shape the paths of human development, and even co-evolve with the\nThe evolutionary concept of \"inclusive fitness\" (developed by Hamilton\nDawkins (1979, 1982)) has provided a dramatic boost to the explanation of social\nbehavior. Inclusive fitness refers to the idea that humans enhance the spread of genes\nlike their own by acting beneficently towards close kin and that natural selection\nwould have favored genes that expressed such beneficent behavior. While the basic\nconcept is widely accepted in the evolutionary psychology field, the role of inclusive\nfitness in explaining the existence of altruism and bonding for groups larger than\nfamilies and clans is still developing. Van den Berghe (1981) and Johnson (1986)\nhave emphasized evolved mechanisms that activate kinship bonding whenever\nhumans recognize appropriate \"markers\" in others (i.e., encounter specific initiating\nenvironmental stimuli) such as ethnic features, language, and mere association.\nThese markers serve as indicators for whomever might qualify as remote or perceived\nfamily among the multitudes of contemporary societies. Rushton (1989) identifies\nphenotypic similarities as the stimuli that initiate kinship bonding mechanisms.\nGoetze (1998) argues that all of these psychological mechanisms likely evolved in\nhunter-gatherer society but their ability to generate bonding in large-scale groups\nderives, in part, from the mobility of modern humans and the difficulties in mobile\nsocieties of actually locating real kin. Hence, humans exhibit at least minimal\nbonding emotions and behaviors with large numbers of surrogate family.\nIn traditional research, debate about the depth and durability of ethnic\nattachments has been carried on between the primordialists who see such bonding as\nstrong, extremely durable and originating far into a sometimes mysterious past and\ncircumstantialists who see group bonding as ephemeral and interest-driven (Scott,\n1990). While not sealing the case for primordialism, inclusive fitness concerns\nprovide at least some scientific footing for the position and reduces some of the\nmystery about group origins by demonstrating how strong, durable ethnic group\nattachments might have formed and persevered.\nAn historian, Peter Mentzel (2000) utilizes the concept of a kinship bonding\nmechanism to explore variation in the origins of nationalist loyalties and viable\nnation-states in the Balkans, especially as they developed under the rule of the\nOttoman Empire. To begin, he notes that nationalism, the politically active\nexpression of ethnic identity, resulted in more effective and stable nation-states in\nCroatia, Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria than in the territories largely populated by\nAlbanians. The former can all point to politically autonomous units emerging as the\ncohesion and strength of the Ottoman Empire waned. By the 19th century, Serbia\nestablished a full-fledged nation-state that would endure through the Yugoslav period\nand maintain its cohesiveness despite disastrous attempts by Serbian political elites to\nestablish a Serbian Empire all its own, despite the essential loss of the region of\n \nKosovo, and despite the economic deprivations imposed by NATO bombing and a\nregime of economic sanctions. In contrast, an Albanian political entity did not\ndevelop until the Yugoslav era, failed to incorporate the lion's share of the adjacent\nAlbanian population, and has continued in a status so fragile that a collapsing\npyramid scheme nearly tore the fledgling Albanian state asunder.\nA traditional issue for scholars and for Mentzel is explaining the development\nof nations or nation-states and in the particular case, why the Croats, Serbs, Bulgars,\nand Greeks, and even Bosnians have been successful at state-building and the\nAlbanians were relatively unsuccessful. A traditional answer has been to assert that\nnationalisms are constructions of political elites designed to serve their political ends\nand that elite manipulations are the focal point for understanding the building of\nbegs the question, however, of why such constructions would have resonated with\nmass populations or why they would have failed to do so.\nMentzel's analysis provides a persuasive connection between elite\nmanipulations and the responses of the masses. Following the work on kinship\nbonding and especially that of Johnson (1986), he argues that kinship is the\nfoundation stone for the often cooperative, emotional and fairly durable attachments\nthat individuals make to larger social associations and, ultimately, to national groups.\nThe evolved psychology of kinship is not perfectly refined and humans react in kin-\nlike manner (forge strong attachments to nonkin) when the triggers of kinship\nattachment are invoked. Calls to protect the Motherland, for example, can stir the\nsacrificial behaviors of broad classes of unrelated peoples. This can work even when\npolitical leaders -- and institutions more generally -- lack a democratic base of\npublic legitimacy. The archetypal case is Josef Stalin's appeal to fight for 'Mother\nRussia' against the German invaders. Not everyone listened, but the point is that even\nStalin eschewed an ideological or personal appeal in this instance, understanding at a\nfundamental level that kinship had the best chance of working under the most dire of\nconditions.\nMentzel's unique contribution here is in showing how a layered development\nof ever larger associations could produce national level associations and how the\nabsence of this line of development serves as an obstacle to the leap from direct kin-\nbased groups to the enormous and often demanding associations of nations and\nnation-states. He argues that clan-based associations needed to pass through\nintermediate associations that were constructed on evocation of kin sentiments before\nthey could make the leap to national groups. In the Balkans, the intermediate\nassociations that would perform those functions were the \"autonomous confessional\nassociations,\" more commonly thought of as religious associations. Except for\nCroatia, the growth of Balkan nationalisms could be traced to the religious \"millets\"\norganized in the Ottoman Empire. According to Mentzel, these formal, nonterritorial\nassociations were coterminous with the less formal religious groups that had\ndeveloped as large-scale, transcendent replacements for earlier clan associations.\nThe evocation of kinship had enabled these religious associations to emerge and were\n \ngiven added impetus by Ottoman organizational schemes. These events had\nsucceeded in pushing social organization into large-scale associations that were,\nnonetheless, cemented by deep-seated emotional attachments. The final step in the\ntransition to nationalisms was to define territories and add political status to these\nlarge-scale associations. Nation-states in the Balkans can be seen as territorial and\npolitical extensions of religious associations or, as in the Bosnian case, as more or\nless tenuous alliances among these associations.\nAlbania is the exception. Religious associations apparently never succeeded\nin forging clan associations into transcendent associations. Albanians adhere in\nsignificant numbers to Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity, and Islam but those faiths\ndid not serve to organize clans or to evoke extensively the triggers of kinship\naffiliation that an organization of clans would have enabled. Interclan relations and\namalgamations were not coterminous with religious affiliation. Lacking religious\ngrounds, elites attempted to build national identity out of a sense of common\nlanguage, but this effort was limited by the obvious reality that Albanians spoke two\nTo restate all of this one could argue that Albanian nationalists faced\nsuch a difficult task precisely because they needed to confront (and\nattempt to co-opt) kinship relations such as the Albanian clans directly\nwithout being able to use confessional group attachments as an\nintermediary or disguised kinship association. Hence, Albanian\nnationalist intellectuals stressed linguistic nationalism in their attempts\nto build an Albanian national consciousness, an effort made difficult\nbecause of the Gheg/Tosk division.\nEfforts to develop national identities and states in most Balkan communities\nsucceeded because of a progressive effort to expand the scale and depth of\nassociations that elicit kin-based affiliations. Efforts to forge a national identity in\nAlbania have not yet culminated in comparable success because the evocation of\nkinship affiliation was not or could not be used to forge a progression of supra-kin\nassociations. In paralleling traditional scholarship and in studying the construction of\nnational identity, Mentzel has rendered the variation in a truly important and widely\nstudied political phenomenon more understandable by elaborating on a fundamental\nconcept from the repertoire of evolutionary psychology. Hopefully, Mentzel's work\nwill inform and enrich the continuing work of traditional scholars in this field.\nCompleting Explanations\nThe categories of research examined here are by no means exclusive.\nMentzel's research was clearly directed at completing an explanation of national\nidentities. Because it was so firmly embedded in traditional historical research, we\nchose to use it as an example of the first category, \"embracing conventional\n \nresearch.\" The research reported on below could also be placed in the same category.\nWe place it in the category of \"completing explanations,\" however, because of its\npotential in making complete an explanation of ethnic conflict where the lack of\ncompleteness is especially salient.\nThis research (Goetze and Smith, 2004) demonstrates how evolutionary\npsychology has the potential for playing an important role in constructing\nexplanations of ethnic conflict that include the proximate causes of ethnic conflict.\nThis suggestion actually runs counter to the positions of Hislope and Harvey who, in\nreview the contributions of evolutionary theory to the study of ethnic conflict. These\nauthors argue that evolutionary theory has the capacity to identify only the distal\ncauses of ethnic conflict.\nWhile acknowledging that evolved traits are important in such distal\nof proximate explanations:\nA second reason for the inclusion of genetic factors when a dependent\nvariable appears explained by culture revolves around the difference\nbetween proximate and distal explanations. While culture may stand\nin an unmediated and direct causal path to any given behavioral trait,\nwhat makes the cultural factor possible could be a certain biological\npredisposition, a gene, or a novel turn in the evolutionary history of\nthe species. Hence, exploring distal causal factors helps to complete\nthe chain of causation and provides an understanding of why things are\nthe way they are. If sociobiologists were to frame their study in such\nexploratory \"distal\" terms, it is likely they could silence some of their\nmore severe critics.\nLater, Hislope (2000, p. 174) offers his view on the extent of the reach of\nevolutionary theory - the longest reach being in the cultural evolutionary variant:\nThe argument advanced herein is that the articulation of cultural\nevolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology,\nbut its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of\ncontingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary,\nproximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly\nelucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate\nbest at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and\nfrom the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display\nshortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in\nnature.\nLikewise, Harvey (2000b, p. 184) finds evolutionary theory wholly inadequate for\n \neven contributing to the explanation of micro events such as the outbreak of war and\nethnic violence:\nResearch on evolutionary theory, phenotype matching and kinship\naffiliations is extremely useful for understanding the root causes of\npatriotism, nationalism (both ethnic and non-ethnic), xenophobia, and\neven racism. But it cannot explain ethnic war - that particular subset\nof human social interaction that involves a high level of inter-group\nviolence and hostility. Nor can it account for variations in the severity\nand timing of ethnic violence more generally. Stronger explanations\nfor this variability focus on environmental forces, some of which\nunderscore the prominent role played by ethnic elites in the\nmobilization process.\nWe can easily share the observation that evolutionary theory has previously offered\nlittle in the way of adding to proximate explanation of ethnic conflict. That condition\nis, we believe, only temporary and Hislope and Harvey have underestimated the\npotential that evolutionary psychology offers in forming proximate explanations of\nsocial behavior including the outbreak of ethnic conflict. Again, we do not claim that\nevolved mechanisms are the only source for constructing explanations of social\nbehaviors. We agree with Hislope that monocausal explanations of social phenomena\nare unlikely to be sustainable. We do argue, however, that evolved psychological\nmechanisms typically play large roles in accounting for most social behaviors\nincluding the outbreak of ethnic conflict. And, what often seem to be cultural events\nindependent of and cut off from evolutionary processes may themselves have evolved\nas functional adaptations that complement or activate embedded psychological\nmechanisms.\nIn a preliminary study of the triggers of ethnic conflict, Goetze and Smith\n(2004) report on a mechanism derived from evolutionary psychology premises that\nillustrate these interactions in the context of group mobilization for conflict. In\nparticular, they posit an alarm mechanism that disposes individuals to organize in the\ndefense and offense of their ethnic group when viable and deadly threats to the\nsecurity of their group are experienced. The behavioral manifestations of this\nmechanism are precisely the organization of group defense and offense when threats\nare encountered and, as activating stimuli, the dissemination of threats (cultural\nphenomena) by political elites who wish to engender a conflict situation.\nWhy would humans possess such a mechanism? Alexander (1979, section 4)\nhas speculated that humans developed alarm mechanisms that might even be specific\nto human threats as a result of cumulative experiences in the environment of\nevolutionary adaptation. Once humans had emerged as the dominant species able to\ndefend against nonhuman predators, their most feared competitors were other humans\nand especially other humans who were organized as a group for the purpose of\npredatory mayhem. Behaviors that served as responses to threats from other humans\n \nmay have been necessary for immediate survival and became adaptive as threat\ncircumstances were repeated over the generations.\nOne can imagine that an array of menacing stimuli provokes defensive\nreactions and that an array of behaviors could manifest those reactions. A plausible\nspeculation is that murderous threats and actions directed at members of an ethnic\ngroup due to their ethnic identity are included among the array of menacing stimuli.\nLikewise, behavioral dispositions to organize group defense or offense in the face of\nthose threats are included among the array of adaptive reactions. Empirical evidence\nthat such connected stimuli and behaviors are universal across cultures and group\nconflict conditions would constitute considerable support for believing them to be\npart of an evolved psychological mechanism - their universality arguing for\nadaptations formulated early and effectively in the EEA. Goetze and Smith (2004)\nreport on two such cases of intense, violent ethnic group conflict in Bosnia and\nRwanda, respectively, and examined the circumstances that preceded the outbreak of\norganized hostilities in each case.\nIn Bosnia in 1995, the contagion effect of group hostilities in neighboring\nregions was clearly in play. Croat and Serb (officially, Yugoslav) forces had recently\nengaged in a full-scale war and tensions in Bosnia about what Serbs in the region\nmight do next were certainly high. Serbian elites within Bosnia who controlled\ntelevision transmissions began disseminating reports of Muslim atrocities against\nSerbian villagers in which the latter were reportedly murdered by the former. No\ndocumentation that these events actually occurred has been put forward suggesting\nvery strongly that the reports were concocted by Serbian elites in order to send off\nalarm bells in the minds of the Serbian masses. In many Serbian villages, the\norganization of militias soon followed and these militias were, in turn, often\norganized into more regular forces for carrying on systematic hostilities within\nBosnia.\nThese media messages about Muslim atrocities were, of course, available to\nMuslim elites and masses and one would expect that Muslims would organize militias\nin alarm over Serbian activities. Yet initially, Muslims did not commence\norganization of communal militias on a widespread basis. Perhaps the messages did\nnot deliver the same provocative stimuli as they delivered to the Serbs. More likely,\nhowever, reactions are conditioned by the degree of vulnerability of the group to\nassaults by other groups. Groups that are most vulnerable and relatively defenseless\nagainst communal assaults, as the Muslims were at that time, have often tended to\nkeep a low profile reminiscent of the \"freeze\" tactics that other small mammals\nassume when confronted with superior predators. A \"rational\" explanation of this\nbehavior is that individuals in vulnerable groups assess that their own defense\npreparations could provoke other groups into preemptive assaults and that the balance\nof forces does not offer favorable outcomes to the vulnerable group. Humans surely\nmake calculations of this sort but only evolutionary psychology offers an explanation\nas to why some manner of calculation clicks on in these types of situations - such\nsituations have been repeatedly encountered in the environment of evolutionary\n \nadaptation and selection favored mental mechanisms that could generate behaviors\nthat optimally responded to the threats to survival and reproduction.\nIn Rwanda in 1994, Hutu elites disseminated messages over mass media that\nmade reference to Tutsi atrocities committed against Hutu villagers, but Hutus\nrequired little convincing as the reality of recent Tutsi assaults on Hutus in\nneighboring Burundi was common knowledge. Again, the atmosphere was already\ntense and Hutu elites needed only to persuade Hutus that similar massacres could\neasily occur in their own country. In fact, the media campaign was geared primarily\nto spurring the organization of Hutus for the purpose of massacring Tutsis and\neliminating the latter from the country.\nAt least within Rwanda itself, Tutsis lacked resources to mount any kind of\ndefense against what developed as genocidal killing. Hence, in most regions of the\ncountry, their reaction was predictably oriented toward the \"freeze\" alternative and\nlittle organization was observable among them to combat Hutu assaults. Only the\nregions bordering Uganda experienced a military response. Tutsis had held important\npositions within the Ugandan army and constituted an important proportion of its\nmanpower. Out of that military diaspora, a Rwandan army (Rwandan Population\nFront or RPF) was forged that ultimately invaded Rwanda and drove out the Hutu\nmilitias as well as the regular Hutu army units. All of this happened despite the\nrelatively small numbers of Tutsis in the Rwandan population (at any time no more\nthan 20%) and despite the nearly successful attempt at massacring the entire Tutsi\ncivilian population. Perhaps two-thirds of the Tutsi population would be slaughtered\nbefore the RPF would take control of the country. The massive acquiescence of the\nRwandan Tutsis was notable for its uniformity of form -- almost no civilians\nattempted any resistance or attempted to organize a resistance - and its universality -\nall civilians appeared to react in the same fashion. An evolved psychological\nmechanism that generates uniform behaviors in response to similar and powerful\nstimuli offers as much explanation as any for the lack of variation in behaviors, a\npattern that seems anomalous from a common sense point of view.\nAt the same time, variation in response to murderous threats was clearly\napparent across the Balkans and Rwandan cases and across the groups within the\nBalkans. Goetze and Smith posit that a complex of stimuli that include murderous\nthreats and perceived military capabilities affect whether freeze or mobilization\nresponses emerge. Another possibility is that perceived credibility of reports of\nmurderous assaults shapes mobilization responses. Clearly, false reports of group\nassault will encounter different responses from one society to the next. Some\nsocieties will be disposed to accept these reports as true. Others will dismiss them\nrapidly as without substance. In the USA, reports from white supremacists groups\nthat Jews and African Americans are murdering whites are generally not believed.\nThe important issue then becomes: what are the environmental conditions that nurture\ndisbelief in one society or, conversely, what are the environmental conditions that\nmake such reports credible?\n \nRecasting Thought\nEvolutionary theory can recast thought, encourage new areas of research, and\ngenerate novel hypotheses about important issues in the ethnic conflict field and help\nto determine which areas of research are especially important.\nThreat Mechanism\nA unique question raised by an evolutionary psychology approach is exactly\nhow does an evolved psychological mechanism function? How do specific behaviors\nconnect algorithmically with specific environmental stimuli? Marcus, Wood, and\nTheiss-Morse (1998) attempt to isolate the workings of what they call a threat\nmechanism. In particular, they develop a model that connects specific environmental\nstimuli with a set of behaviors that they label intolerance. They are interested in\nintolerance directed at members of an out-group, typically some manner of ethnic or\nracial group. The primary problem, as they see it, is to identify the environmental\nstimuli that provoke intolerant behaviors. Identifying the right stimuli can be\naccomplished, however, only by gaining understanding of the process through which\nstimuli are translated into behaviors.\nThey begin their model-building task by first reviewing features of two\ngeneral models that have been used to explain threat behaviors -- a rational actor\nmodel and a symbolic politics model. The salient features of a rational actor model\ninclude an assessment mechanism that initiates intolerance behaviors whenever\nthreatening stimuli are perceived. More specifically, the mechanism surveys the\nenvironment and assesses the probability of a dangerous event occurring. Intolerance\nbehaviors are seen as coping devices designed to ameliorate or nullify the danger. An\nindividual might attempt to deprive a group of political rights, for example, if\nmembers of that group are engaging in behaviors that have a high probability of\ninfringing on the status of one's own group.\nA symbolic politics model identifies provocative behavior as the mere\npresence of a member of a group that is associated with a threat earlier in one's life or\nthe presence of some symbol of the group. People respond to these symbols in\nintolerant ways not because they pose real threats or even a probability of real threat\nin the contemporary environment but because the symbols acquired a negative\nvalence (through cultural transmission or conditioning) at a distant time in the past.\nEnvironmental stimuli are not assessed through rational calculation that evaluates the\ndegree of threat but almost subconsciously in a way that arouses emotional responses.\nBy triggering affect and emotion, intolerant behaviors are set in motion. The type of\nstimuli that initiate this sequence are deviations from norms - an action, event, or\nperson that represents a violation of the status quo and carries the associated negative\nvalence.\nMarcus, Wood, and Theiss-Morse (1998) find fault with these models and\npropose a new model that corrects for deficiencies. They cite previous work (Kinder\n \nand Sears, 1981) that demonstrates that the degree of threat posed in a contemporary\nenvironment fails to elicit appropriately measured intolerance responses and other\nbrain may not be adept at processing threats in a conscious calculated manner. They\nnote that rational calculation of threat is unlikely to be the process invoked in\nthreatening circumstances because rational calculation is a relatively time-intensive\nprocess and threats need rapid responses. Hence, the subconscious, affective system\nof processing is more likely to be invoked because this system processes stimuli at\nvery rapid speeds.\nHowever, the notion that even the affective system is triggered to produce\ncoping responses by high values on a differentiated threat dimension may by\nmisguided. The degree of immediate danger is not likely to be the activating stimuli.\nInstead, the authors suggest that threat responses tend to be provoked when out-\ngroups are perceived to be engaging in violations of accepted societal norms - in\nother words, alarm bells tend to go off when out-groups are disrupting the societal\nenvironment - an intriguing conclusion that suggests a new class of behaviors that\nought to be examined in the search for proximate causes of ethnic conflict.\nIn a clever experimental design, Marcus, et al (1995) tested the validity of the\nrational choice model, the symbolic politics model, and their own affective\nintelligence model. First, subjects were given the opportunity to rate a wide variety\nof different groups according to their likes and dislikes. This procedure enabled\nsubjects to \"rely on their previously secured affective disposition ...\" Two weeks\nlater the same subjects were confronted with alternative scenarios involving actions\nof groups that they had rated as \"least-liked.\" The actions were distinguished by\nwhether the disliked groups were moving into positions in society where they could\npose danger to the subject or by whether the actions of the group violated accepted\nnorms of social or political behavior. Thus, the scenarios created an opportunity to\nassess, on the one hand, the likelihood of threat and, on the other hand, the violation\nof social norms. In an initial study, the subjects were presented with written\nscenarios and in a subsequent study, subjects were presented with actual news\nbroadcasts. The results were similar in both studies. They found that the degree of\nthreat did not provoke differences in tolerance/intolerance evaluations as measured by\na post-experiment questionnaire. However, violations of social norms did elicit more\nintolerant responses, thereby, supporting that aspect of the affective intelligence\nmodel that identifies norm violations as the environmental activators of the\nmechanism that generates intolerant behaviors.\nIn a follow-up experiment; Marcus, Wood, and Theiss-Morse (1998) also\nmeasured the affective-anxiety levels of subjects as they were being exposed to news\nbroadcasts that did or did not display violations of social norms. They found that\nanxiety levels were significantly higher when violations of social norms were present\nin the news broadcasts, again lending credence to the notion that processing of the\nthreat was taking place on an emotional level rather than on the level of rational\n \ncalculation.\nMany real-world cases of conflict offer at least casual support for the affective\nintelligence model. Recent developments in the Arab-Israel conflict comprise a case\nin point. During that summer of 2000, President Clinton attempted to broker an\nagreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority that would settle\nlongstanding, even ancient, land claims. The bargaining focused on what percentages\nof the West Bank and Gaza Strip would be controlled by the Palestinian Authority,\nafter further devolution of authority from Israel. While no meaningful agreement on\nthe main issues emerged between representatives of the respective sides, both Yasser\nArafat and Ehud Barak seemed open to continuing negotiations, with either Clinton\nor (more likely) someone else as the intermediary. In other words, the \"peace\nprocess,\" as it became known, seemed to be moving forward in an incremental\nfashion, subject to the usual short-term disappointments such as those experienced in\nthe summer meetings. The likelihood of violence in the conflict, in at least an\nimpressionistic sense, seemed at an all-time low.\nAll of this changed dramatically and in a manner consistent with the\nframework of affective intelligence soon after negotiations lapsed. A visit by Ariel\nSharon to the Temple Mount in the early fall of 2000 ignited street violence from\nPalestinians at a level not seen since the Intifadah of the late 1980s. This simple act,\nby one person, brought the logic of affective intelligence into play.\nThrough his visit to a site holy to both Jews and Arabs in the Old City of\nJerusalem, Sharon violated what appeared to be a basic social norm within the peace\nprocess. As a living symbol of Israel's incursion into Lebanon in 1982, Sharon,\nwithin the context of the winding down of the Arab-Israel conflict, would not be\nexpected to enter a high-profile point of dispute such as the Temple Mount. For\nPalestinians this constituted an extreme departure from what appeared to be a long-\nterm commitment by Israel to self-restraint. Thus Sharon's visit became the stimulus\nfor a Palestinian response that, in the language of Marcus, et al., consisted of\nintolerance behaviors. As would be expected by the logic of affective intelligence,\nthe processing of threat appeared to be taking place on an emotional level and largely\nin the form of social norm violations rather than through rational calculation.\nMarcus and his colleagues presented us with a model of how an evolved\npsychological mechanism processes threat stimuli and converts these stimuli into\nintolerance behaviors. Their work exemplifies the fruitfulness of examining the\nactual workings of psychological mechanisms that come into play as ethnic group\nconflicts develop and argues strongly for a research program that examines the\nworkings of a range of psychological mechanisms that may be involved in the\nelicitation of ethnic behaviors.\nThe affective intelligence model describes a psychological mechanism that\ngenerates intolerance behaviors. Some of the details of that model may have\nrelevance for developing more refined explanations of other ethnic phenomena\nincluding mobilization for violent group conflict. Reports of ethnic massacres signify\nan extreme degree of threat and it is hard to dismiss the influence of these reports in\n \ntriggering group mobilization. However, massacres are also clear violations of social\nnorms and these aspects of massacres may play a more prominent role in activating\ngroup responses than one might initially think.\nSuicide Bombing\nBehaviors surrounding suicide bombing are not exclusively ethnic\nphenomena, but are important and frequently overlap with ethnic phenomena,\nespecially when a bombing targets a group that is of a distinctly different ethny.\nAtran and others1 have explored the genesis of suicide bombing and, in\nparticular, why individuals become suicide bombers. These authors utilize several\nideas from evolutionary psychology to generate novel hypotheses about the motives\nof suicide bombers and about the factors in their environments that could generate\ntheir terrorist behaviors.\nKrueger (2003) whose profiles of Palestinian suicide bombers reveal few traits that\nset them apart from other individuals in their societies. Suicide bombers are at least\nas educated and at least as economically well-off and employed as the general\npopulation. Moreover, they are not notably more religious than others at least prior to\ntheir recruitment into terrorist organizations. Importantly, they also exhibited no\npattern of personality pathology that could have set them apart from others. Hence,\nthe socio-economic and personality profiles of suicide bombers offer few obvious\nclues about why they choose this line of work and puts scholars at something of a loss\nin trying to explain these choices. Where can we look then to answer why individuals\njoin terrorist organizations and engage in suicide bombings?\nSuicide bombers may not be very different from the general population in\ntheir societies. However, it does not follow that the societies themselves are profiles\nof normality. Acknowledging this environmental condition and drawing inspiration\nfrom evolutionary thought, Atran and his commentators derive at least three\nexplanatory hypotheses. The first is a sociobiological one that focuses on individual\nmotives. The second hypothesis points to macro-environmental conditions that create\nso-called \"fitness cliffs.\"2 And, finally, a third hypothesis points to the fictive kinship\nof the small group environment of terrorist organizations as a determining factor in\nsuicidal behaviors. These are interwoven hypotheses in the sense that the explanation\nembodied in the first hypothesis sets the stage for the second and third hypotheses.\nAmong the few distinctive traits that stand out among suicide bombers are\ntheir maleness and unmarried status. Lacking children of their own and any\nimmediate prospects of bearing any, unmarried males might be more inclined to\nsacrifice, up to forfeiture of their own lives, for the sake of the welfare of others who\nare born and nurtured by others but perceived to be kin. The resort to the sacrifice of\none's own life for perceived kin may make sense, however, only in a society where\nconditions in the environment have resulted in diminished life prospects. The choice\nto engage in suicide bombing can be viewed then as a fundamental inclination to\n \nenhance one's inclusive fitness. However, single unmarried status hardly serves as\nthe sole condition pushing young males into such drastic acts. In societies\ncharacterized by violent military occupation, inadequate medical care, and minimal\neconomic opportunities life tends to be brutish and short. The prospects for fruitful\nand fecund family life are especially dim for unmarried males and the support of\nalready existing kin might assume relatively higher adaptive value than marshalling\nresources for one's own future, i.e., where the cliff of fitness abruptly descends.\nMartyrdom can bring financial rewards to existing kin but more importantly, confers\nstatus on entire clans. Suicide bombings typically impose damage on society's\nenemies and are viewed by many as enhancing future outcomes for that society.\nEvents with origins exogenous to the society may created the fitness cliff or\nrender it dramatically steeper. The occupation of Palestine by Israeli troops is an\noften cited example of an event that has eroded the life prospects of Palestinians. In\nexplaining why Palestinians take up suicide bombing, Jessica Stern (2003: 38)\nremarks in her book on religious terrorists: \"Hopelessness, deprivation, envy, and\nhumiliation make death, and paradise, seem more appealing.\" She goes on to cite an\nelderly resident of Jenin: \"Look around and see how we live here... Then maybe you\nwill understand why there are always volunteers for martyrdom Every good Muslim\nunderstands that it's better to die fighting than to live without hope.\"3 Life tends to be\nshort in Palestine, employment opportunities few even for the well-educated, and the\nreproductive prospects for unmarried males relatively unfavorable. In these\nconditions, dying in the interests of altering the fitness cliff for the Palestinian\ncommunity could, in theory, be a superior means of transferring one's genes into\nfuture generations in these conditions. Still, if unmarried male status and oppressive\nconditions were sufficient to generate suicide bombers then one could expect most\nunmarried males in such societies to engage in such extreme terrorism and it appears\nthat they do not even though in some societies (e.g., Palestinian society) over 70% of\nthe population supports \"martyrdom\" operations (Atran, 2003: 5).\npuzzle derives from the interactions within terrorist organizations. Atran proposes\nthat the influence of the terrorist organization, in particular, the influence of the small,\nterrorist cell explains the final commitment to suicide. Arguably, the unit for which\nhumans are most willing to sacrifice and the unit exercising the greatest influence on\nhumans is the family. Natural selection provided humans with mechanisms that\ncreated tight, emotional bonds with immediate kin. As Goetze (1998) argues,\nhowever; mobility, modern society, and globalization have torn people away from\ntheir natural families. Modern humans, still operating with the mechanisms of\nkinship that evolved in hunter-gatherer society, now find themselves in search of\nsubstitutes. The small, terrorist cell serves as a meaningful substitute to family and it\nis not surprising that members end up forming strong emotional bonds with each\nother as well as the typical sacrificial inclinations of close family. Leaders of\nterrorist organizations cultivate and manipulate these emotional bonds and steer their\nexpression toward political goals of the terrorist organization.\n \nLike any hypotheses, these three need to withstand evaluation through\nempirical comparisons. Indeed, some scattered evidence casts doubt on the accuracy\nof elements of the hypotheses. The \"fitness cliff\" hypothesis presumes that life\nopportunities for potential suicide bombers have recently plummeted. Yet, Atran\nreports that most bombers, while sometimes underemployed for their education\nlevels, have relatively positive life opportunities -- certainly no worse than that of\ncomparable individuals in their societies. Even the sociobiological hypothesis is\nchallenged by data indicating that over one-third of the suicide bombers of the\nLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka and over two-thirds of bombers of the\nreported in Stern, 2003: 53). Despite these disconfirming data, these hypotheses still\nprovide some compelling and novel insight into some emerging and unexpected facts\nabout the activities of suicide bombers. The disparity between these data and\nhypotheses raises new issues about how situational factors and environmental\nconditions may differ across these societies and may even be activating different\nmechanisms that, nonetheless, result in similar behaviors, that is, suicide bombing.\nAs they are refined with empirical observations, these hypotheses seem likely to\ncontribute in meaningful ways to explanation of these crucially important\nphenomena.\nAll of these cases demonstrate that there need not be antagonism over the\napproach taken by traditional scholars and practitioners of evolutionary psychology.\nTraditional research provides valuable data and important elements of useful\nexplanations. Clearly, an evolutionary psychology approach can contribute to these\nexplanations in multiple ways. It can extend traditional research on ethnic\nphenomena, fill in proximate explanations of ethnic conflict, or open up new areas of\nresearch and thought. Most studies of ethnic phenomena using an evolutionary\npsychology approach fulfill more than one of these missions.\nNotes\n1.
