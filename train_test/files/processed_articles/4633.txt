In women with male fetuses, Ang II positively correlated\nwith birth weight (p = 0.028) and prorenin negatively correlated with placental weight (p = 0.014). Female fetuses had\nhigher umbilical artery resistance indices (p = 0.019) that were related to maternal prorenin concentrations (p = 0.007).\nConclusions: In early human pregnancy, the maternal RAS is influenced by fetal sex. The lower Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratios in\nwomen with female fetuses may contribute to the lower maternal peripheral microvascular flow as described previously\nand the lack of any positive effect of Ang II on fetal growth, as seen in women with male fetuses.\n",

The renin\u00adangiotensin aldosterone system\n(RAAS) is a hormone cascade responsible for blood pres-\nsure homeostasis and is upregulated during pregnancy.1\u00ad3 A\nsignificant increase in plasma volume is essential for a suc-\ncessful pregnancy; these changes in plasma volume are\nmediated in part by the actions of angiotensin (Ang) II on\nthe adrenal cortex, which releases aldosterone and stimu-\nlates fluid retention.4\nAng II has vasopressor effects, increasing systemic vas-\ncular resistance through central and peripheral actions. The\nRAAS is activated in early pregnancy to maintain blood\npressure as maternal peripheral blood flow increases, par-\nticularly in the skin,5 kidneys6 and uterus.7 A rise in glo-\nmerular filtration rate (GFR)8 and an increase in\nprogesterone levels9 occur early in pregnancy and would\npromote salt excretion if not offset by an activated RAAS.\nAs well, sodium retention has to occur to allow for the\nincrease in maternal blood volume and to meet the demands\nof the growing fetus.\nIn pregnant women, plasma levels of active renin, and\nits precursor prorenin, are increased. Prorenin levels\nincrease to 100 times those of active renin, while in non-\nUnder physiological conditions, 2% of this prorenin will\nspontaneously activate,13 thereby adding to the circulating\nrenin enzyme activity.

Ang I is cleaved by\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to produce Ang II.\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the predomi-\nnant enzyme for producing the heptapeptide Ang 1-7, with\nthis reaction 500 times faster when using Ang II as the sub-\nstrate rather than being generated from Ang I.19 Renin and\nprorenin are also influenced by sex, being lower in the cir-\nculation in women than in men, possibly because the influ-\nence of oestrogens on AGT generates more Ang II leading\nto negative feedback on renin release.20,21 Conversely,\nBroughton-Pipkin et al.,22 who examined the renin and\nangiotensin levels in children less than 8 years of age, have\nfound that plasma renin activity and Ang II levels are lower\nin boys than girls.\nAng peptides have been measured in pregnancy and\nAng 1-7 also increases throughout gestation.25 Ang II has\nnot been measured in early gestation at the same time as\nAng 1-7. Ang 1-7 has been shown to be a vasodilator by\ninducing endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production,26\nkinins27 and prostaglandins28 so the balance between the\nlevels ofAng II andAng 1-7 may be important in regulating\nmaternal vascular tone. Interestingly, in preeclampsia and\ngestational diabetes Ang (1-7) levels are low in late gesta-\ntion.29,30 In order to fully elucidate the functional role of\nthese peptides in pregnancy and the use of Ang 1-7 and/or\nAng II as potential biomarkers for pregnancy pathologies\nsuch as preeclampsia and gestational hypertension in which\nthe RAAS has been implicated,31 we first needed to estab-\nlish the normal levels of these peptides and other compo-\nnents of the RAAS in early gestation in women with\nuncomplicated pregnancies.\nWe therefore tested the following hypotheses: first, that\na factor associated with fetal sex alters the balance between\nthe Ang II and Ang 1-7 axes of the maternal RAS; second,\nthese sex-based differences in angiotensin peptides are due\nto differences in the upstream components of the RAS, i.e.\nprorenin and ACE; third, since the circulating RAAS is a\nkey regulator of cardiovascular and renal function and Ang\nII is a pro-inflammatory peptide,32,33 these differences in\ncirculating RAAS components would affect other measures\nof maternal cardiovascular and renal health as well as a\nmarker of inflammation (C-reactive protein; CRP). Finally,\nwe postulated that differences in Ang peptides, and there-\nfore differences in the vasodilator/vasoconstrictor balance,\nwould alter uterine artery and umbilical artery resistance\nindices as well as fetal growth.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy design\nThe current study is a nested case-control study within the\nAdelaide Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE)\ncohort. Women attending the Lyell McEwin Hospital\n(South Australia, Australia) were recruited, after giving\ninformed written consent, if they were nulliparous with a\nsingleton pregnancy, less than 15 weeks' gestation and had\nfewer than three previous terminations of pregnancy or\nmiscarriages. Samples collected at 15 weeks' gestation\nwere selected if women had no pregnancy-associated com-\nplications (n = 131), that is, if they remained normotensive\n(<140 and/or <90 mmHg prior to labour), showed no pro-\nteinuria, delivered a live born baby who was normally\ngrown after 37 weeks' gestation and had no other sign of\npregnancy complications. All the women included in the\ncurrent study self-reported as being Caucasian, except for\none who was listed as a Maori/Cook Islander. Ethics\napproval for this work was given by the Central Northern\nAdelaide Health Service Ethics of Human Research\nSample collection\nNon-fasting blood was collected into ethylenediaminetet-\nraacetic acid (EDTA) vacutainers at 15 weeks' gestation by\nvenepuncture from patients who had been either sitting or\nsupine for 10 minutes (min). Blood pressure and other clin-\nical measurements were also recorded at this time. Mid-\nstream urine was collected into 50 ml pots. All samples\nwere placed on ice before processing and storage at \u00ad80\u00b0C\nwithin 30 min of collection. Doppler sonography was con-\nducted at 20 weeks' gestation on the umbilical and uterine\narteries to measure blood flow resistance. Birth and placen-\ntal weights were measured following delivery. Maternal\ndaily cigarette consumption from before and during preg-\nnancy was also recorded.\nLaboratory measurements\nPlasma Ang II and Ang 1-7 were measured at ProSearch\nInternational Australia Pty. Ltd. (Malvern, Victoria,\nAustralia) using a direct radioimmunoassay employing\ndelayed tracer addition. Ang II assay sensitivity was 4\npmol/l; with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation\nof 6.4% and 12%, respectively. Cross-reactivity to Ang I,\nand <0.1%, respectively. Cross-reactivity to Ang III and\nAng IV are 98% and 100%, respectively, as these peptides\nhave the same c-terminal as Ang II. Quality controls for\nsensitivity was 13 pmol/l; with intra- and inter-assay coef-\nficients of variation of 4.5% and 10%, respectively. Cross\nreactivity to Ang I, Ang II, Ang III and Ang IV were 0.11%,\n1-7 to Ang II ratios were derived from the plasma concen-\ntrations of these peptides.\nMaternal plasma concentrations of ACE (Duoset, R&D\nSystems, MN, USA) and prorenin (Molecular Innovations,\nMI, USA) were measured using commercially available\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits and conducted\naccording to manufacturer's instructions.\nBiological analytes were measured by SA Pathology at\nthe Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (South\nAustralia, Australia). Plasma and urinary electrolytes\nwere measured using ion-selective electrodes, while cre-\natinine was measured using the Jaff\u00e9 method and CRP\ndetermined with an immuno-turbidimetric assay. All\nassays were read on an Olympus AU5400 Chemistry-\nImmuno Analyzer.\nData analysis\nThe rate pressure product, which is an indirect measure of\ncardiac work, was calculated by multiplying heart rate and\nsystolic blood pressure. Plasma creatinine was used as a\nsurrogate measure of GFR because equations that derive\nGFR from the plasma creatinine cannot be used in preg-\nnancy because of the physiological changes in GFR and the\nprogressive changes in body weight.34 Urinary protein to\ncreatinine, urinary albumin to creatinine and urinary\nsodium to potassium ratios were determined and the frac-\ntional excretion of sodium calculated from the formula:\nWhere UNa and PNa are urinary and plasma sodium levels\n(mmol/l), respectively, and UCr and PCr are urinary (mmol/l)\nand plasma creatinine levels (\u00b5mol/l), respectively.\nValues are expressed as medians and interquartile ranges,\nunless otherwise stated.

GraphPad Prism\n5.0 was used to generate box and whisker plots.\nResults\nThe only difference in maternal physiological variables,\nmeasured at 15 weeks' gestation, between women who\nsubsequently delivered a female baby compared with those\nwho had a male baby was higher umbilical artery resistance\nindices at 20 weeks'gestation in women who carried female\nfetuses (Table 1).\nPlasma Ang II levels were higher in women with female\nfetuses compared with women carrying a male fetus (n =\ntive of fetal sex (Figure 1). Therefore, Ang 1-7 to Ang II\nratios were lower in women carrying female fetuses com-\npared to males (p = 0.016, Figure 1). The total concentra-\ntion of Ang II plus Ang 1-7 was similar in both groups of\nwomen, as were plasma ACE concentrations and prorenin\nconcentrations (Figure 2). At 15 weeks' gestation, maternal\nheart rate, blood pressure, rate pressure product, plasma\nurea, plasma sodium, plasma creatinine, urinary albumin to\ncreatinine ratio, urinary protein to creatinine ratio and the\nurinary sodium to potassium ratio were not affected by fetal\nsex (Table 1).\nCRP concentrations were inversely related to maternal\nprorenin concentrations (Figure 3), as was placental weight\nif the fetus was male (Table 2). In women with female\nfetuses, maternal prorenin concentrations at 15 weeks'\nFigure 1.

There was a positive relationship\nbetween Ang II concentrations at 15 weeks' gestation and\nmale birth weights that was not seen if the fetus was female\n(Table 2). There was also a positive correlation in women\ncarrying male fetuses, between Ang 1-7 and maternal heart\nrate and plasma sodium concentrations.\nOnly one relationship between the limited measures of\nrenal health that we could obtain and the maternal RAS was\nfound. In women carrying female fetuses, plasma creati-\nnine (a surrogate measure of GFR) was positively related to\nplasma ACE concentrations (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nThe observations that Ang II concentrations are higher if\nthe fetus is female and Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratios lower sup-\nport our hypothesis that the balance between these RAS\npeptides is influenced by the sex of the fetus. Our second\nhypothesis was that any differences in the Ang II and Ang\n1-7 axes of the RAS were associated with differences in\nFigure 3.The effect of fetal sex on relationships between the maternal RAS and CRP. (A) There was a positive relationship between\nmaternal plasma Ang II and CRP (p < 0.01, R2 = 0.12); whilst (B) maternal circulating prorenin levels showed a negative relationship\nwith plasma CRP (p < 0.02, R2= 0.07) irrespective of fetal sex.

Since there were no dif-\nferences in prorenin or ACE levels between the two groups,\nthe higher Ang II concentrations in women with a female\nfetus did not depend on parallel differences in those factors\nthat control its production, which we measured. There was\nalso no difference between the two groups of women in the\ntotal concentration of Ang peptides measured. Taking these\ntwo observations into account, the sex-specific differences\nin maternalAng II concentrations and in theAng 1-7 toAng\nII ratios in these women could be due to a greater rate of\nconversion of Ang II to Ang 1-7 in women carrying a male\nfetus. ACE2, which converts Ang II to Ang 1-7, is found in\nabundance in the syncytiotrophoblast of both the early- and\nlate-gestation placenta,35\u00ad38 where it could convert maternal\nAng II, perfusing the intervillous space to Ang 1-7. Thus\nthe sex difference in the Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratio could be\nconferred by exposure of maternal Ang II to male\nsyncytiotrophoblast.\nLevels of Ang II and Ang 1-7 were measured in blood\ncollected in EDTA tubes. This was because they were col-\nlected for a multicentre study looking for biomarkers of\npregnancy outcome. At the time of collection, peptides of\nthe RAS were not considered and so tubes containing pro-\ntease inhibitors were not made available to the clinic. There\nmay have been some post-collection activity of proteases\nnot sensitive to EDTA. It is unlikely that either ACE or\nACE2 were active post-collection since both are inhibited\nby EDTA39 and plasma ACE2 activity is blocked by an\nendogenous inhibitor.40 Be that as it may, this does not\naccount for the striking sexual dimorphism in theAng 1-7 to\nAng II ratios. The greater amount of Ang II in women carry-\ning female fetuses and the lower Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratios are\nindicative of a lesser rate of conversion of Ang II to Ang 1-7\nin these women. Adult males have higher circulating ACE2\nactivity than that of adult females41 and ACE2 activity is\nhigher in the kidney of male mice due to an increased\nenzyme velocity.42 We suggest that if ACE2 in the syncytio-\ntrophoblast35\u00ad38 of women carrying male fetuses also exhib-\nits the same higher enzyme velocity, Ang II would be more\nrapidly converted to Ang 1-7 by the male placenta.\nOur third hypothesis was that differences in circulating\nRAS components would affect other measures of maternal\ncardiovascular and renal health, as well as a marker of\ninflammation (CRP; Table 2). Overall there were no sex-\nspecific differences in maternal cardiovascular function or\nin indices of renal health at 15 weeks' gestation. Although\nseveral sex-specific relationships between RAS compo-\nnents and measures of cardiovascular and renal health were\nfound (Table 2), the sex-specific mechanisms behind these\nrelationships are unclear. While these are only associations\nand require experimental validation, they may imply sex\ndifferences later in gestation in women who develop gesta-\ntional hypertension or preeclampsia.\nStark et al.43 found that near term, women carrying a\nfemale fetus had lower peripheral microvascular skin\nblood flow than women carrying a male fetus. We think\nthat the higher Ang II concentrations in women carrying a\nfemale fetus and the consequent lower Ang 1-7 to Ang II\nratios could explain this difference in maternal skin blood\nflow. Ang II is both directly and indirectly a potent vaso-\n1-7 to Ang II ratios in women carrying a female fetus could\nresult in increased vascular tone. The study by Stark et al.43\nalso showed a greater increase in maternal peripheral\nmicrovascular flow in response to corticotrophin-releasing\nhormone (CRH) in women carrying male fetuses. This\nmight also be explained by our finding that Ang 1-7 to Ang\nII ratios were higher in women carrying male fetuses\nbecause both Ang 1-7 and CRH increase endothelial NO\nTable 2.The effect of fetal sex on relationships between the maternal RAS and estimates of maternal health, including\ncardiovascular health, laboratory measurements and obstetric data.\nMaternal characteristics Female Male\nr p n r p n\nCardiovascular\nPlasma analytes \nObstetric data\nAll data were collected at 15 weeks' gestation, except the obstetric data, which were measured at 20 weeks' gestation by Doppler sonography; birth\nand placental weights were collected at term. Pairwise Spearman correlations were used to identify relationships of interest with statistical signifi-\ncance set at 5%. RAS: renin\u00adangiotensin system; Ang: angiotensin; ACE: angiotensin-converting enzyme; RI: resistance index.\nIf, as postulated above, ACE2 activity is greater in the\nmale fetus and in its placenta than the female, then this\ncould also explain the lower umbilical artery resistance\nindices of male fetuses compared with female fetuses, since\nACE2 is also found in abundance in the fetal endothelium\nIn both groups of pregnant women, Ang II and CRP con-\ncentrations were directly related. CRP is a non-specific\nmarker of inflammation. Ang II is commonly regarded as a\npro-inflammatory peptide which has been shown to stimu-\nlate CRP synthesis in vascular endothelial cells,32 as well as\nmacrophages,33 and blockade of the Ang II-AT1\nreceptor is\nassociated with decreased plasma CRP concentrations.46\nCRP is synthesised by the liver in response to factors\nreleased from adipocytes and is known to be associated\nwith obesity.47 We cannot explain the negative correlation\nseen in both groups of women between maternal prorenin\nand CRP. Although it may occur indirectly through nega-\ntive feedback effect of Ang II on renal prorenin production,\nwe found no evidence for a negative relationship between\nprorenin and Ang II in maternal plasma in this study (data\nnot shown).\nFinally, we postulated that differences in Ang peptides,\nand therefore differences in the vasodilator/vasoconstrictor\nbalance, would be associated with altered uterine artery and\numbilical artery resistance indices as well as fetal growth.\nHere we have shown that there is a positive relationship\nbetween maternal Ang II levels and birth weight in women\ncarrying male fetuses but neither Ang peptide was related\nto uterine or umbilical artery resistance indices in this con-\ntrol population. In contrast, a positive correlation between\nmaternal prorenin and umbilical artery resistance indices of\nfemale fetuses and a negative correlation between maternal\nprorenin and placental weight of male fetuses was observed,\nsuggesting that prorenin within the utero-placental circula-\ntion has adverse effects on fetal health and well-being.\nIn conclusion, in healthy pregnancies with normal out-\ncomes, maternal plasma Ang II concentrations were higher\nand Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratios were lower at 15 weeks' gesta-\ntion if women were carrying a female fetus. This could\naccount for the higher maternal peripheral vascular tone seen\nat term in pregnancies carrying female fetuses compared to\nthose with males.43 There is no evidence that these differ-\nences are due to higher concentrations of prorenin or ACE. It\nis possible that the rate of conversion ofAng II toAng 1-7 by\nACE2 is slower in women bearing female fetuses.\nThis work shows for the first time that early in normal\nhuman pregnancy the concentration of two biologically sig-\nnificant angiotensin peptides in the maternal circulation is\ninfluenced by fetal sex. The higher Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratios\ncould explain findings by others that maternal microvascu-\nlar skin flow is higher if a woman is carrying a male fetus,\nas Ang 1-7 is a vasodilator and Ang II is a vasoconstrictor.\nThe higher umbilico-placental vascular resistance of female\nfetuses and the negative impact of high maternal prorenin\nlevels on placental weight if the fetus is male further sug-\ngest that the intrauterine RAS may influence placental\ndevelopment and function.\nThis study also highlights the need to take into account\nfetal sex when studying the role of the maternal circulating\nRAS in pregnancy.\n"
