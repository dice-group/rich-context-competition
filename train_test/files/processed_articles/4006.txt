This cross-over study investigated the acute effect of a single\nwalk on BP and tested whether polymorphisms of the ACE gene might explain the variation in BP responses.\nMaterials and methods: Thirty-four healthy medicated individuals were randomized to one control and one walking\nsession at 60\u00ad75% of heart rate reserve. Subjects left the laboratory wearing an ambulatory BP monitor until waking the\nnext morning.\nResults: Overall, systolic BP was somewhat lower following the walking session (p=.06), which could be attributed to\na consistently lower systolic BP for 5 h after exercise (p-interaction<.04) compared with control rest. Similarly, II/ID\nindividuals had a lower systolic BP (p-interaction=.02) and diastolic BP (p-interaction<.01) for 5 h after walking compared\nwith control rest. Among DD individuals, a single walk did not induce a reduction in BP (p-interaction>.05).\nConclusions: Our results showed that postexercise hypotension can occur after a walk at moderate intensity in\ncarriers of the I allele; we were not able to demonstrate this in DD individuals. Our results suggest that genetic variation\nin the ACE gene might affect the BP response to exercise, although more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n",

Indeed, earlier\nstudies already demonstrated that individuals with the\ndeletion polymorphism (DD) of the angiotensin convert-\ning enzyme (ACE) gene have higher circulating ACE lev-\nels compared with individuals with the insertion\npolymorphism (II),28\u00ad30 resulting in a higher BP and an\nincreased risk for hypertension in DD homozygotes.31\u00ad34\nLess is known about the role of the RAAS system and its\npolymorphisms in BP reduction following a single exer-\ncise session. It is generally accepted that in most subjects,\nPEH is due to a persistent drop in vascular resistance,\nwhich is not completely offset by increases in cardiac out-\nput.35 Although the mechanisms of the vasodilatation\nunderlying this PEH largely remain to be elucidated,\nchanges in the sympathetic nervous system and nitric\noxide (NO) have all been implicated,35\u00ad38 with studies\ndemonstrating an association between RAAS and these\nmechanisms.39,40 Similarly, ACE polymorphisms have also\nbeen shown to be related to NO release postexercise, with\ncarriers of the I allele presenting greater NO bioavailabil-\nity after a single bout of aerobic exercise compared with\nDD individuals, and consequently larger PEH.40 Finally,\nexercise also triggers an increase in release ofAng (1\u00ad7) as\nwell as ACE2, which are vasodilators, leading to greater\nNO production and resulting in a reduction in BP.36 To the\nbest of our knowledge, only a few studies have directly\ninvestigated the effects of ACE polymorphisms on post-\nobserved a lower SBP in DD individuals compared with\nindividuals with an I allele after light-intensity exercise\n) but not following moderate intensity exer-\n). On the other hand, Santana et al.40\nshowed a significantly larger decrease in SBP over the\ncourse of 1h after a maximal incremental cycle test and a\nsingle bout of exercise at 90% of anaerobic threshold in II/\nID individuals compared with DD.\nNevertheless, participants in these studies were unmed-\nicated healthy patients, or had been treated with medica-\ntion but undergone a washout period before enrollment in\nthe study. However, today, 58.9% of the population are\ntreated with BP-lowering medication.42 Therefore, it\nwould be of interest to see whether exercise still has some\nadjunctive effect in reducing BP in patients already treated\nwith medication. Therefore, given the current limited and\ninconsistent results, we aimed in the present study (1) to\ninvestigate the acute effect of one single walking session at\nmoderate intensity on PEH and (2) to test whether poly-\nmorphisms of the ACE gene contribute to the variation in\nPEH response in medicated patients.\nMethods\nSubjects\nPotential participants were recruited by means of\nannouncements in journals and magazines and on the\ninternet. After being screened and signing the informed\nconsent, 34 individuals (Table 1) performed one control\nsession and one exercise session. The inclusion criteria\nwere: healthy men or women without known cardiovascu-\nlar or pulmonary disease, age 40 years, non-smokers,\nclinically diagnosed with hypertension according to the\nSeventh Report of the Joint National Committee on\nPrevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High\nBlood Pressure5 and having been treated for at least\nmonths with antihypertensive medication acting on\nRAAS. The study was approved by the Research Ethics\nCommittee of the State University of Londrina - Brazil\nStudy design\nThis study was performed as a randomized controlled\ncross-over trial. During the screening visit, patients\nreceived information about the study and filled in a ques-\ntionnaire about their habitual physical activity behavior,\nmedication and medical history. In addition, anthropomet-\nrics (height and weight) and resting BP were assessed, and\nvolunteers completed a maximal graded exercise test on a\ntreadmill (T170, h/p/cosmos, Traunstein, Germany) until\nvolitional exhaustion using an individualized ramp proto-\ncol.43 The criteria for test interruption followed the recom-\nmendations of the American Heart Association.44 The\noxygen uptake was evaluated continuously by a breath by\nbreath analysis of expired gases (QuarKCPET, Cosmed,\nRome, Italy), and a polar heart rate (HR) monitor (FS1,\nPolar, Kempele, Finland) was used to assess the HR. Peak\noxygen consumption (VO2 peak\n) was defined as the mean\noxygen uptake of the final 30 s of the exercise test. The\nmaximal duration of the test was between 7 and 12 min.\nThis test was used to define the target HR for the exercise\nsession and to evaluate the current physical fitness of the\nparticipants.\nFollowing this visit and having signed the informed\nconsent, participants returned to the laboratory twice, dur-\ning which they completed the control and the exercise\n722 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nsession. The randomization order was determined by a\ncomputer program (http://www.random.org/). All tests\ntime of day for each individual patient to control for diur-\nnal variation in BP and to avoid any influence of time of\nmedication intake. All measurements were performed by\nthe same investigator (KG).\nExercise and control intervention\nEach session started with a 10min seated rest period, after\nwhich BP and HR were measured by means of an auto-\nmatic device (Omron HEM 742 INT, Comfort, Japan).\nThis pre-intervention BP was measured three times with a\nmin interval between measurements. Following pre-\nintervention measurements, each volunteer performed one\nof the two sessions in random order: a control session of\nseated rest and one walking session of 55min, including a\nwarming up and cooling down of 5min each and 45min of\nwalking at 60\u00ad75% of HR reserve. During the supervised\nwalking session, training intensity was controlled by a HR\nmonitor (FT1, Polar, Kempele, Finland).\nAmbulatory blood pressure monitoring\nAfter the exercise and control sessions, individuals left the\nlaboratory wearing an ABP device (Meditech, ABPM04,\nBudapest, Hungary) on the left arm until waking the next\nmorning. The ABP monitor was programmed to measure\nmin, and the first BP reading was assessed\n30min following the sessions. Patients were instructed to\nproceed with their normal daily activities and were asked\nto fill in an activity diary. Daytime ABP was defined as the\nnighttime BP was defined as the mean BP of all values\nally checked and invalid measurements were excluded. A\nreading was considered invalid if it differed by more than\n40 mmHg from the previous and the next reading and this\ncould not be explained by a change in physical activity. We\nsubsequently manually calculated hourly averages on the\nedited data.\nBlood sampling and ACE genotyping\nBlood samples (5 ml) were collected from the brachial\nartery during the screening visit and prepared by an inde-\npendent biochemical laboratory (The Novaes Center for\nClinical Analysis), after which they were stored at -80\u00baC.\nGenotyping was performed by the polymerase chain reac-\ntion (PCR) method45 at the Laboratory of Biomechanical\nand Molecular Biology (University of S\u00e3o Paulo). DNAwas\nextracted from whole blood and the ACE gene (II/ID and\nDD) was determined by means of a two-primer system (I/D:\nTable 1.

The DNA was amplified for 30\ncycles with denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at\nthermal cycler (MJ Research, PTC-200, Peltier Thermal\nCycler, USA). The PCR product is a 190 bp fragment in the\nabsence of the insertion and a 490 bp fragment in the\npresence of the insertion. A third fragment with an inter-\nmediate molecular weight is present in PCR from hete-\nrozygotes, and likely corresponds to a heteroduplex DNA\nfragment.46 Amplification products were visualized after\nelectrophoresis in 1% agarose gels with loading buffer\n(Figure 1).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed by means of the\nStatistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 17.0,\nChicago, USA). The data are reported as mean and stand-\nard error for continuous data and number (%) for dichoto-\nmous data. The Shapiro\u00adWilk test was used to check the\nnormality, followed by Mauchly's and Greenshouse\u00adGeiser\nfor the sphericity. Independent Student's t-tests were used\nto compare pre-intervention data across the different poly-\nmorphism groups, and dependent Student's t-tests were\nused to compare pre-intervention BP between sessions.\nCategorical variables were compared by means of 2 tests.\nTwo-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated\nmeasures was performed to compare ABP (SBP and dias-\ntolic blood pressure (DBP)) over time and between the two\nexperimental sessions. When applicable, the least signifi-\ncant difference (LSD) post-hoc test was performed. BP data\nare reported for 5 h because this is the time period over\nwhich PEH was sustained following the exercise session.\nTo test whether the observed genotype frequencies were in\nHardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium, a 2 test with one degree of\nfreedom was used. Statistical significance was established\nas p<.05 (one-tailed).\nResults\nSubject characteristics\nThe general characteristics of the subjects are presented in\nyears (range 40 to 79)) were overweight or obese individu-\nals with controlled (n=20) or uncontrolled (n=14) hyper-\ntension and above average physical fitness for individuals\nof their age.47 Baseline characteristics were similar for the\ntwo genotype groups. ACE allele and genotype frequen-\ncies in our population did not differ significantly from\nHardy\u00adWeinberg expectations (p allele frequency = .49; q\nallele frequency = .51).\nBlood pressure response\nOverall study sample. As shown in Table 2, pre-interven-\ntion BP was not different between the sessions (p>.05).\nFollowing the walking session, no differences could be\nobserved for average daytime, nighttime or 24h ABP\n(p>.05) compared with a non-exercise control session.\nThe hourly mean BP for 5 h following the interventions\ncan be seen in Figure 2. Over the course of 5 h, one single\nwalk induced a significantly more pronounced reduction\nin BP compared with control for both SBP (p-interac-\ntion=.04) and DBP (p-interaction=.001). Further, when we\ncalculated the average change over the 5 h period, Figure 3\nshows that the average decrease in DBP (-6.5\u00b11.5mmHg)\nwas significantly larger (p=.01) compared with\ncontrol rest (-3.1\u00b11.5mmHg), and there was a borderline\nnon-significant (p=.06) larger reduction in SBP\n(-5.7\u00b12.6mmHg) following exercise compared with a\nnon-exercise control session (-1.3\u00b12.6mmHg).\nACE polymorphisms (II/ID and DD).

As demonstrated in Figure 5(a), the exercise-\nmmHg) was signifi-\ncantly larger compared with the non-exercise control\nFigure 1.

However, as\ncan be seen in Figure 4(c) and (d) and Figure 5(b), partici-\npants homozygous for the D allele of theACE gene showed\nno significant change in BP following the interventions\n(p-time >.05 for both; p-interaction > .05 for both).\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was (1) to assess the acute effect\nof a single walk at moderate intensity on PEH and (2) to\nexamine the effects of the ACE polymorphisms on the PEH\nresponse to this walk in 34 hypertensive medicated men\nand women. Our results demonstrate that a 45 min walk at\nmoderate intensity already results in BP reductions that last\nfor a 5 h period compared with a non-exercise control ses-\nsion. Our results further show that carriers of the I allele\nexperience this PEH following a single walk, whereas a\nreduction in BP is not observed among D homozygotes.\nThe acute effects of aerobic endurance exercise on BP\nhave been widely studied among different popula-\ntions48\u00ad52 and using a wide variety of exercise proto-\nfollowing aerobic endurance exercise is a low-threshold\nphenomenon. They reported that the immediate\nBP-lowering effects of short-duration (15 min), lower-\nintensity exercise (40% VO2peak\n) are comparable to those\nof higher amounts of exercise (30 min at 60% VO2peak\nIn line with this, Mach et al.56 reported that PEH occurred\nafter any duration of moderate-intensity endurance exer-\ncise in the laboratory. In our study, we used moderate-\nintensity walking, which could easily be incorporated\ninto daily life and can safely be performed by any\nTable 2.

Our results are in line with previous studies\nthat have already demonstrated that PEH is a low-intensity\nthreshold phenomenon. Namely, for 5 h after the walk-\ning session, both SBP (-5.7\u00b12.6 mmHg)and DBP\n(-6.5\u00b11.5mmHg) were lower compared with a non-exer-\ncise control session, suggesting that a simple brisk walk,\nwhich is accessible to a large proportion of hypertensive\npatients worldwide, might already result in significant\nhealth benefits. As is well known, the primary recom-\nmendation for the treatment of high BP starts with life-\nstyle modification; however, if the BP is not sufficiently\nlowered, treatment with antihypertensive medication is\nnecessary.5 Previous studies have reported that BP con-\ntrol at normal levels is difficult, with only 25\u00ad62% of\nmost hypertensive patients receive antihypertensive med-\nication. In Brazil, 76% of patients are using drug ther-\napy.60 In view of the importance of external validity to\ncontribute to strategies for BP control in hypertensive\npatients, we included medicated patients. To our knowl-\nedge, this is the first study to investigate the acute effects\nof exercise on BP in patients treated with ACE inhibitors\nor angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Previously,\nCiolac et al.13 investigated a single aerobic exercise effect\non ABP in long-term-treated hypertensive patients. They\ndemonstrated for the first time that a single session of\naerobic exercise reduced ABP in long-term-treated\npatients. In line with this, Melo et al.61 showed reductions\nFigure 3.

Further,\nFagard17 concluded that exercise characteristics, such as\nintensity, frequency and duration, explain only 4.9% of the\nvariance in SBP and 1.1% in DBP in response to exercise.\nAdditionally, the HERITAGE62 study concluded that 30%\nof the variance in resting BP can be explained by genetics.\nThis all suggests that genetic variation between individu-\nals might also help to explain part of the different responses\nIn this study, we focused on the effect of ACE polymor-\nphisms on PEH. We observed a BP reduction after a simple\nwalk in subjects who carry the I allele, while we were una-\nble to show this effect in DD individuals. Others have\nshown that individuals carrying an I allele (II/ID) are less\nprone to develop hypertension, and the present results sug-\ngest that they are also more responsive to the PEH effect.\nThis was explained by the observation of higher levels of\ncirculating ACE in DD homozygotes compared with indi-\nviduals carrying the I allele.28 However, our results further\nsuggest that this lower risk for hypertension might also be\nexplained by their better responsiveness to exercise,\nalthough this should be confirmed in larger studies. Our\nresults are in line with those of Santana et al.,40 who\nshowed that only individuals carrying an I allele presented\nreductions in SBP after an incremental test and after 20\nmin of exercise at 90% anaerobic threshold. Earlier studies\ninvestigating the chronic effects of exercise on BP found\nsignificant reduction in BP after 10 weeks of training only\nin individuals with an I allele, and not in DD homozygotes,\nwhile Hagberg et al.63 found larger reductions in BP fol-\nlowing exercise in II and ID genotype individuals com-\npared with DD individuals.\nOn the other hand, Blanchard et al.26 demonstrated that\nSBP was lower for 14 h after exercise at light but not mod-\nerate intensity in homozygous DD individuals compared\nwith II/ID, suggesting that intensity might influence the\nrelationship between ACE polymorphism and PEH.\nFinally, Taylor-Tolbert et al.41 reported larger reductions in\nBP in II and DD compared with ID 24 h after a single bout\nof vigorous exercise. However, it is difficult to compare\ntheir results with ours, as they compared ACE homozy-\ngotes (II and DD) with ACE heterozygotes (ID).\nThe present study was not designed to examine possible\nmechanisms that could explain the different response\nbetween the ACE polymorphisms. However, it has previ-\nously been shown that the DD allele of ACE is associated\nwith higher ACE circulating levels, resulting in a higher\nBP due to an increase in Ang I and Ang II, triggering vaso-\nconstriction, water retention and sodium reabsorption, and\nresulting in a higher blood volume.28 Others showed that\nhigher activity of Ang II may blind the vasodilatation\ninduced by bradykinin, resulting in reduced NO bioavail-\nability.31 Although we did not evaluate NO bioavailability,\na previous study demonstrated that ID/II individuals have\nan increased NO release post incremental exercise test\ncompared with DD individuals.40 Further, Tanriverdi\net al.65 showed greater endothelium-dependent vasodilata-\ntion in II-homozygous athletes compared with DD or ID,\ndue to increased NO bioavailability and bradykinin con-\ncentration. These mechanisms might in part explain the\nPEH response, taking into account that bradykinin and NO\nFigure 5. Mean SBP and DBP change at 5 h monitoring following exercise or control session in the II/ID group ((a), N=24) and the\nDD group ((b), N=10) (overall study sample N=34).\nData are reported as mean\u00b1SE.\nThe present study has some limitations. We only evaluated\ninsertion/deletion polymorphisms of the ACE gene, and did\nnot include other polymorphisms or parameters of the RAAS,\nsuch as plasma renin levels, ACE plasma levels, angiotensin\nlevels and angiotensinogen. Based on a previous review by\nPescatello et al.,67 we calculated that we would need a sample\nsize of 33 patients to detect an absolute net difference of 4.7\nmmHg, assuming a standard deviation of 8.5 mmHg with a\nstatistical power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05. Although the num-\nber of participants in the DD group corresponds to the overall\nrepresentation of this group in the general population, this\nlower number of participants might have resulted in a lack of\npower to detect changes in BP following exercise.\nConsequently, we lacked the power to perform a three-way\nANOVAin which we could have included the polymorphism\ngroups as a covariate. Therefore, we suggest that the results of\nthis study should be interpreted as hypothesis generating, and\nfurther studies are needed to confirm our findings.\nConclusions\nIn hypertensive subjects receiving medications for the\nRAAS, a single walk at moderate intensity promotes a\nreduction in BP compared with a rest session. Overall, a\nsingle walk at moderate intensity promoted somewhat\nlarger reductions in BP compared with a control rest ses-\nsion. Further, our results suggest that this PEH might be\ninfluenced by genetic factors.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nKFG is supported as a doctoral fellow by the Brazilian Agency for\nSupport and Evaluation of Graduate Education - CAPES founda-\nresearch fellow by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO);\nMDP is supported by the Brazilian Council for the Scientific and\nReferences\n1.
