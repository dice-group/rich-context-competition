To determine the extent to which office-\nbased rheumatologists provide primary care to patients\nwithout rheumatic diseases or provide principal care to\npatients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\nMethods. The National Ambulatory Medical Care\nSurvey was used to determine national probability\nestimates of the nature and types of conditions treated\n1,074 patient visits, the rheumatologists recorded up to\n3 diagnoses and 3 patient-reported reasons for the visit,\nas well as information on the treatments provided at the\nvisit.\nResults. In only 9.8% of new consultations and\n11.9% of return visits was neither a rheumatic disease\ndiagnosis nor a musculoskeletal complaint recorded,\nindicating that the rheumatologist was likely acting as a\nprimary care provider at a minority of patient visits.\nAmong continuing patients with RA, the patient's pri-\nmary reason for the visit was something other than a\nmusculoskeletal complaint in only 9.9% of visits, and\nany nonrheumatic complaint was recorded in 30.4% of\nvisits, indicating that at only some visits was the rheu-\nmatologist acting as the principal caregiver. In addition,\nonly 31.1% of visits included the provision of medication\nfor a nonrheumatic condition.\ntologists involved the provision of specialized or consul-\ntative care to patients with rheumatic diseases or mus-\nculoskeletal complaints, and few visits were made by\npatients without either indication. Provision of princi-\npal care by rheumatologists to patients with RA is not\ncurrently widespread.\nThe continued oversupply of specialist physicians\nand perceived need for more primary care physicians has\nfocused the attention of health care planners and poli-\ncymakers on the role that specialists play in providing\nprimary care. Specialists may provide primary care in\none of two ways: by being a primary care provider to\npatients who have no medical condition relating to the\ngiven specialty, or by providing primary care along with\nspecialized care to patients who have a chronic illness\nrelated to the specialty. This latter mode of providing\nprimary care along with specialized care has been\ntermed \"principal care,\" to distinguish it from primary\ncare in general. For most persons in the US, access to\nspecialists is not restricted by administrative barriers,\nand patients may refer themselves to specialists. Con-\ncern has been expressed that underworked specialists\nmay spend a substantial amount of time providing\nprimary care that, while comparable in quality with the\ncare provided by generalists (1\u00ad4), often involves greater\nuse of health care resources and higher costs (5\u00ad7).\nSpecialists who provide primary care are often required\nby health care insurers to choose to provide either only\nspecialty care or only primary care. However, having\nspecialists provide principal care may be attractive be-\ncause the efficiency of this mode of providing effective\nprimary and specialty care may offset any associated cost\ndifferences.\nThere is little information available about the\nroles of rheumatologists in the provision of primary care,\nprincipal care, or strict specialty care. A national survey\nin the mid-1970s indicated that more than half of visits\nto rheumatologists involved principal care, but that\nSupported in part by the Maudie Long Gift Fund at the\nVeterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System.\nMichael M.

Ward, MD, MPH,\nSubmitted for publication June 8, 1998; accepted in revised\nstudy did not examine primary care separately (8).\nSurveys of community-based rheumatologists in the\nmembers of the American College of Rheumatology\n(ACR) showed that primary care visits accounted for\nonly 6% of visits (Sheahan K, ACR: personal commu-\nnication). These surveys did not include assessments of\nthe provision of principal care by rheumatologists, an\nimportant omission given the recent endorsement of\nprincipal care by the ACR (11).\nIn the present study, data from the National\nAmbulatory Medical Care Surveys were used to investi-\ngate the nature and types of visits by patients to a\nrepresentative national sample of rheumatologists in\nwith which rheumatologists provided primary care by\nexamining the proportion of visits by patients without a\nrheumatic disease or musculoskeletal complaint. The\nprovision of principal care was also examined by inves-\ntigating the presenting complaints and treatments of\ncontinuing patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a\nsubgroup likely to receive principal care from rheuma-\ntologists.\nMETHODS\nThe National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey gath-\ners data on aspects of medical care provided to ambulatory\npatients in physicians' offices. The survey is a research study\nconducted annually by the National Center for Health Statis-\ntics (NCHS); it provides nationally representative data on the\nuse of ambulatory medical care services, derived via a multi-\nstage sampling scheme (12). This scheme includes probability\nsampling of defined geographic areas, sampling of physician\npractices within those areas, and sampling of patient visits\nwithin those practices. Practices that were eligible for sampling\nincluded those of all office-based physicians listed in the\nAmerican Medical Association or American Osteopathic As-\nsociation master files who were principally involved in patient\ncare and who were not federal employees. Specialty designa-\ntions in these master files are those reported by the physicians.\nIn the present study, data from the surveys conducted from\nvisits by patients age 18 years and older. The number of\nphysicians included in the surveys in each year ranged from\nvisits to 39 rheumatologists.\nThe sampling unit of the survey was the patient-\nphysician visit. For each visit, information was collected on the\npatient's demographic characteristics, the reasons for the visit\nas reported by the patient (up to 3), physician diagnoses by\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clin-\nical Modification codes (up to 3), whether or not the physician\nhad seen the patient previously, diagnostic and preventive\nhealth care services provided at the visit, medications, and\ndisposition. The patient-reported reason for the visit was\ncoded using a detailed scheme based on reported symptoms\n(general symptoms or those referable to 1 of 9 organ systems),\nspecific diseases, injuries, diagnostic or preventive services,\nprovision of specific treatments (i.e., immunizations) or test\nresults, or administrative reasons (12).\nTo determine the proportion of visits to rheumatolo-\ngists that involved strictly the provision of primary care, the\nproportion of visits in which none of the 3 physician-reported\ndiagnoses included a rheumatic disease diagnosis and none of\nthe 3 patient-reported reasons for the visit included a muscu-\nloskeletal complaint, symptom, or disease was computed.\nVisits for laboratory testing, test results, injections, prescrip-\ntion renewal, and those termed \"progress visits\" by the patient\nwere all considered to be rheumatic disease\u00adrelated visits.\nProportions were computed separately for visits by new pa-\ntients and visits by continuing patients. To provide an indica-\ntion of the role of primary care in the work of rheumatologists\ncompared with other medical subspecialists, similar analyses\nto hematologist-oncologists, 766 visits to nephrologists, and\n793 visits to endocrinologists included in the survey.\nTo calculate the proportion of rheumatologist visits\nthat involved principal care, the patient-reported reasons for\nthe visit among continuing patients with RA were analyzed.\nThis subgroup was chosen for analysis because continuity of\ncare is one of the markers of principal care, and because\npatients with RA represented the largest diagnostic subgroup\n(n  285) likely to receive principal care from rheumatologists.\nCare for nonrheumatic complaints is an indication of compre-\nhensiveness, another hallmark of principal care. Therefore, the\nextent of provision of principal care among these patients was\nestimated by computing the proportion of visits in which a\nnonrheumatic complaint was reported by the patient to be the\nprimary reason for the visit, and the proportion of visits in\nwhich a nonrheumatic complaint was included among the 3\npossible recorded reasons for the visit. As in the above analysis,\n\"progress visits\" and visits for laboratory testing, test results,\ninjections, and prescription renewals were all considered rheu-\nmatic disease\u00adrelated visits.\nThe proportion of visits in which nonrheumatic medi-\ncations were prescribed, ordered, or administered was also\ncomputed. In contrast to merely noting the presence of a\nnonrheumatic complaint, the provision of medication for a\nnonrheumatic problem signifies recognition by the physician of\nsome responsibility for treating the problem and serves as a\nmore specific indicator of a principal care relationship. In this\nanalysis, analgesics, antiinflammatory and second-line anti-\nrheumatic medications, medications for the prevention and\ntreatment of osteoporosis, and medications for peptic ulcer\ndisease were considered to be medications for rheumatic\ndiseases. All other medications, including antidepressants,\nwere considered to be nonrheumatic medications.\nProvision of preventive care is also a marker of prin-\ncipal care. Therefore, the likelihood that continuing patients\nwith RA treated by rheumatologists would receive counseling\non diet, weight reduction, cholesterol levels, exercise, and\nsmoking cessation was compared with the likelihood that such\ncounseling would be provided in 32,647 visits by continuing\npatients of general internists, family physicians, and general\npractitioners included in the survey. The relative likelihood of\neach type of counseling by rheumatologists compared with\ngeneralist physicians was computed as an odds ratio, based on\nlogistic regression models with adjustment for patient age, sex,\nand race. Generalized estimating equations were used to\nadjust for the effects of clustering of patients by physician (13).\nTo produce unbiased national estimates of patient\nvisits and medication use, and to account for the complex\nsampling design of the National Ambulatory Medical Care\nSurvey, the NCHS has assigned weights to each visit that adjust\nfor the probability that a given visit was selected, for nonre-\nsponse, and for selection by physician specialty (12). These\nweights inflate the number of visits in a manner that permits\nextrapolation from the sampled visits to the entire US popu-\nlation. For example, the 1,074 visits to rheumatologists repre-\nsent 24.7 million such visits nationally, and the 285 visits by\ncontinuing patients with RA represent 5.7 million such visits\nnationally. All data on proportions of visits presented here are\nbased on these weighted estimates. Standard errors and 95%\nconfidence intervals for these proportions were computed\nusing formulas provided by the NCHS (ref. 12 and Shimizu I,\nNCHS: personal communication). All statistical analyses were\nperformed using SAS programs (Statistical Analysis Systems,\nCary, NC).\nRESULTS\nOf the 1,074 sampled visits to rheumatologists,\nyears or older. Seventy-two percent of visits were made\nby females, and 90.7% by whites. Fifty-nine percent of\nvisits were made by patients with private medical insur-\nance (including 15.7% with prepaid insurance), 32% by\npatients with public insurance, and 9% by patients\nwithout medical insurance. New consultations com-\nprised 12.3% of visits, and continuing patients accounted\nfor 87.7% of visits. Joint pain (not otherwise specified)\nwas the most common primary patient-reported reason\nfor the visit, for both new consultations (15.3%) and\ncontinuing patients (17.9%). Four of the 10 most com-\nmon primary reasons for new patient consultations and\nfor continuing patient visits were for pain in specific joint\nareas, and \"arthritis\" was reported as the primary reason\nfor the visit by 7.5% of new and continuing patients. RA\nand osteoarthritis (9.7% of new consultations, 10.3% of\ncontinuing visits) were the most common principal diag-\nnoses reported by rheumatologists. Diagnostic or evalu-\native tests were ordered at 95.5% of new consultations\nand 90.2% of continuing visits. Medications were or-\nvisits.\nAmong new consultations by rheumatologists,\n22.0% of visits were by patients who did not report a\nmusculoskeletal complaint, and 19.9% of visits were by\npatients who did not have a rheumatic disease diagnosis\n(Table 1). Among continuing patients, these proportions\nTable 1.

Compared with\nother medical subspecialists, rheumatologists had\namong the lowest proportion of primary care visits.\nThese findings indicate that physicians in other medical\nsubspecialties are more likely to see patients with con-\nditions outside of their specialty than are rheumatolo-\ngists, whose practice is largely restricted to patients with\nrheumatic conditions.\nTo assess the provision of principal care by\nrheumatologists, the presenting complaints of continu-\ning patients with RA were examined. In 90.1% of visits\npatient's principal reason for the visit was a musculo-\nskeletal complaint. Diffuse joint pain was the single most\ncommon reason for the visit (41.8%), while \"arthritis\"\nwas the reported reason for the visit in 13.0%. In only\nreason for the visit not a musculoskeletal complaint. A\nnonrheumatic complaint was recorded as any of the 3\npotential reasons for the visit in 30.4% of visits (95% CI\nraised in only a minority of visits.

Compared with visits to generalist physicians,\nvisits by patients with RA to rheumatologists were\nsignificantly less likely to include counseling on choles-\nterol and weight reduction (Table 2). For example, visits\nto rheumatologists were only 56% as likely to include\ncounseling on weight reduction as were visits to gener-\nalist physicians. Counseling on diet, smoking cessation,\nand exercise did not differ significantly between these\nprovider groups.\nDISCUSSION\nThe findings of this study indicate that most of\nthe work of rheumatologists is focused on providing care\nto patients with rheumatic complaints. Only about 10%\nof visits to rheumatologists involved patients with nei-\nther a musculoskeletal complaint nor a rheumatic dis-\nease diagnosis. Such visits for conditions or concerns\noutside the rheumatologists' area of specialty expertise\nmost likely represent visits for primary care. The pro-\nportion of primary care visits in this study was closely\ncomparable with the proportion of primary care visits\nreported in a recent survey of ACR members (6%). In\nearlier surveys that indicated much higher proportions\nof primary care visits to rheumatologists, the estimates\nmay have been inflated due to the instruments' record-\ning of only whether the principal diagnosis was of a\nrheumatic disease rather than also noting secondary or\ntertiary diagnoses, and not considering patients' present-\ning complaints (9,10). Alternatively, changes in referral\npatterns and health care practices over the last 20 years\nmay have also decreased the proportion of patients\nwithout rheumatic complaints who are seen by rheuma-\ntologists.\nPrincipal care appeared to be practiced more\ncommonly than primary care. Based on both the patient-\nreported reasons for the visit and the provision of\nTable 2.

This esti-\nmate is intermediate in relation to 2 previously reported\nestimates of the proportion of principal care provided by\nrheumatologists (8,14), but the operational definitions\nof principal care differed between these studies. Aiken\nand colleagues reported that 52.9% of visits to rheuma-\ntologists involved principal care, which the authors de-\nfined as visits by continuing patients for whom the\nrheumatologist reported providing the majority of the\npatient's care (8). A recent study of visits by Medicare\nbeneficiaries to 57 rheumatologists in Washington state\nfound 19.2% of visits to be for problems other than\nrheumatic diseases (14). Neither report stated whether\nthe patients seen by rheumatologists had any rheumatic\ndisease or musculoskeletal complaint, and therefore\nthey did not precisely distinguish whether these visits\ninvolved principal care by rheumatologists to their pa-\ntients with rheumatic conditions, or primary care.\nContinuity, comprehensiveness, and preventive\ncare are among the major hallmarks of primary care\n(15), and are also the hallmarks of principal care. In this\nstudy of principal care, the analysis was restricted to\ncontinuing patients with RA, thereby ensuring the re-\nquirement for continuity. Although the main assessment\nof principal care was based on the comprehensiveness of\ncare provided these patients as determined by examining\nthe types of patient complaints noted and treated, the\nprovision of preventive care to this subgroup was also\nexamined. Counseling on cholesterol levels and weight\ncontrol was less commonly provided on visits by RA\npatients to rheumatologists than on visits by other\npatients to generalist physicians, in analyses that in-\ncluded adjustment for group differences in age, sex, and\nrace. While patients with RA may be less in need of such\nservices, it may also be that rheumatologists were less\nlikely to provide these services because they did not see\nthemselves as the principal care provider for most of\nthese patients. These results support the view that\nrheumatologists provide principal care to only a portion\nof their continuing patients with RA.\nThe strengths of this study are its large size and\nnationally representative sample, and the availability of\ndata not only on physician diagnoses, but also on pa-\ntients' presenting complaints and treatment. However,\nthis study is limited, as are most previous studies of this\ntopic (8,9,14), by the need to infer the provision of\nprimary care and principal care from the nature of the\nconditions reported and treated, rather than assessing\nthem in a more direct way. It was also not possible to\ndistinguish whether principal care was provided as a\nresult of an explicitly established relationship between\nthe patient and his or her rheumatologist, or whether\nthis care was of a more incidental nature. The finding\nthat many rheumatologists prescribed nonrheumatic\nmedications, but that they did so infrequently, suggests\nthat most of the primary care they performed was\nincidental. Knowing the extent of dedicated principal\ncare relationships between patients and their rheuma-\ntologists would be more important than knowing the\nextent of incidental primary care provided by rheuma-\ntologists.\nBecause the survey sampled only single patient-\nphysician encounters, the range of providers who treated\neach patient (information that might have corroborated\nwhether rheumatologists were the primary or principal\ncaregivers for individual patients) also could not be\nexamined. The sample size did not permit adequate\nstudy of the relationship between the patient's type of\nmedical insurance and receipt of principal care. Infor-\nmation on the work setting of the physicians, which\nmight have influenced their propensity to provide pri-\nmary care or principal care, was not available.\nMost of the work of rheumatologists is within the\ndomain of their subspecialty, and little of their work is\ndevoted to providing exclusively primary care. Although\nevidence of principal care relationships between rheu-\nmatologists and patients with RA exists, these relation-\nships are not widespread, and may more often represent\ncare for incidental problems rather than dedicated prin-\ncipal care relationships. Additional research is needed to\ndetermine if patients who receive principal care from\nspecialists have comparable or better health outcomes at\nlower costs than patients who see both specialists and\nprimary care physicians. While adoption of this ap-\nproach to patient care would not be difficult and may be\nclinically effective and cost effective (11), doing so would\ninvolve a change in the current nature of rheumatology\npractice.\nREFERENCES\n1.
