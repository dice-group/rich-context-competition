It is usually\nbilateral, and is caused by termination of\neyeball development after closure of the\nembryonic fissure. The condition is occa-\nsionally sporadic, and can be either auto-\nsomal dominant or recessive. The main\nclinical manifestations are microcornea,1\nshortened axial length,2 narrow palpebral\nfissure3 and thickened scleral wall,4,5 with\ncomplications including glaucoma, uveal\neffusion, exudative detachment of the\nretina and intraocular haemorrhage being\ncommon.\nThe majority of research into pure micro-\nphthalmia has concentrated on the retina,\nwith the result that pathological changes to\nthe cornea are not well understood. The\naims of the present study were to determine\nthe typical corneal changes of pure micro-\nphthalmia using a corneal topography\nsystem, and identify characteristics that\nmay assist in early diagnosis.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective case\u00adcontrol study\nrecruited patients with pure microphthalmia\nwho attended the Department of\nOphthalmology, First Affiliated Hospital\nof Nanchang University, Nanchang,\nJiangxi Province, China or Department of\nOphthalmology, Third Affiliated Hospital\nof Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi\nProvince, China, between October 2011 and\nJune 2014. Exclusion criteria were: factors\ninfluencing refractive errors (including ker-\natoconus, corneal laser surgery, trauma,\netc); history of contact lens use; familial\nkeratoconus; chronic keratitis and conjunc-\ntivitis; atopic disease; other systemic disease.\nPatients with secondary glaucoma were\nrequired to maintain normal intraocular\npressure, a transparent cornea (determined\nvia corneal endothelial mirror), a normal\nratio of hexagonal cells to corneal endothe-\nlial cells and normal cell densities.\nThe control group comprised healthy age\nand sex-matched volunteers recruited from\nindividuals undergoing routine health\nscreening at the First Affiliated Hospital of\nNanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi\nProvince, China with uncorrected visual\nacuity score > 1.0, no history of trauma, no\ncontact lens use, no refractive surgery, and\nnormal eye development.\nThe study was approved by the ethics\ncommittees of the First Affiliated Hospital\nof Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi\nProvince and the Third Hospital of\nNanchang City, Nanchang, Jiangxi\nProvince, China, and was performed in\naccordance with the Declaration of\nHelsinki for research involving human sub-\njects. All participants provided written\ninformed consent prior to enrolment.\nDiagnosis\nAll participants gave a detailed disease\nhistory and underwent slit-lamp examin-\nation, inspection shadow optometry, auto-\nmatic refraction meter examination and\ncorneal topography. Ocular axial length\nwas measured with A-mode ultrasonic diag-\nnostic equipment, with the mean of five\nrepeated measurements used for analysis.\nCorneal topography\nAll participants underwent corneal topog-\nraphy analysis using the Orbscan IIZ\u00d5\nCorneal Topography System (Bausch and\nLomb, Bridgewater, NJ, USA). With the\nparticipant seated, the lower jaw was lifted\nand the head restrained with the eyes\nlooking at the front lamp. The eyes were\nkept open with light focusing at the centre of\nthe pupil for 2 s, and corneal images were\nexported to a computer system. Images\nincluded a colour-code chart, anterior and\nposterior corneal surface elevation maps,\na corneal surface gravity map and refractive\ncorneal thickness figures. A total of nine\ncorneal regions were identified, analysed\nand read.\nStudy parameters included central thin-\nnest corneal depth, degree of corneal astig-\nmatism (mean A), simulation of corneal\nastigmatism (sim A), mean keratometry\n(mean K), simulated keratometry (sim K),\nirregularities in the 3 - and 5-mm zones, and\nthe mean thickness of nine distinct corneal\nregions (2 mm diameter circles, 3 mm from\nthe optical axis; one at the central cornea\nand eight in the periphery). Corneal topog-\nraphy was classified based on anterior cor-\nneal surface refraction (round, oval,\nsymmetrical bowknot, asymmetric bowknot\nand irregular), corneal surface elevation\nmaps (symmetrical crest, asymmetric ridge,\nincomplete crest, island, and unclassified)\nand corneal thickness maps (circular, oval,\neccentric circular and eccentric oval).\nEach eye was examined three times and\nthe best corneal topography images were\nanalysed. When the image of the central\ncornea was unclear due to dry eye, eye\nmovement, poor eye fixation or blinking,\nthe examination was repeated until a distinct\nimage was obtained. Binocular images were\nused for statistical analyses.\nStatistical analyses\nThe sample size for the study was set to 12\n80% confidence. Data were presented as\nmean \u00c6 SD (range). Between-group differ-\nences in sex were analysed using contingency\ntables. Data regarding age, axial length,\ndioptre, corneal refractive power and cor-\nneal topography parameters were compared\nusing one-way analysis of variance or\nStudent's t-test. Function and sensitivity\nindices were determined using discriminant\nanalysis. All statistical analyses were per-\nformed using SPSS\u00d5 version 19.0 (SPSS\nInc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows\u00d5. P-\nvalues < 0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nThe study recruited 12 patients with pure\nmicrophthalmia (4 male/8 female; mean age\n12 control subjects (5 male/7 female; mean\nwere no statistically significant between-\ngroup differences in age or sex.\nData regarding optical characteristics are\nshown in Table 1.

The prognosis is\npoor, and patients are prone to secondary\nglaucoma, uveal effusion and other fundus\ndiseases. Pathological examination of the\neye reveals abnormalities in the arrangement\nof scleral collagen fibres together with\nglycosaminoglycan deposition,6 leading to\nthe formation of a thickened and imperme-\nable sclera.7 This results in obstructed vortex\nvenous backflow and subsequent chronic\nchoroidal effusion, ciliary body,choroidal\ndetachment and nonporous retinal detach-\nment.8 The size of the anterior segment of\nthe eye in is normal patients with pure\nmicrophthalmia, but the volume ratio of\nthe crystalline lens is significantly increased.3\nIn addition, choroidal detachment can push\nthe lens iris diaphragm forwards so that it\nbulges and impinges on the anterior cham-\nber, leading to secondary angle closure\nglaucoma.9 Shortening of the posterior seg-\nment can lead to subtle retinal folds, chor-\noidal folds, uveal effusion syndrome and\npigmentary retinopathy.10 Diagnosis of pure\nmicrophthalmia depends largely on clinical\npresentation and associated ocular imaging,\nincluding type A or B ultrasonography and\nultrasound biomicroscopy.\nPatients with pure microphthalmia exhib-\nited a shortened eye axis, smaller corneal\ndiameter and high central corneal curvature,\nas well as significantly higher mean K, sim\nK, mean A and sim A compared with\ncontrol subjects in the present study. In\naddition, 75% of eyes from patients pure\nmicrophthalmia exhibited false keratoco-\nnus. Changes in corneal shape and thickness\nmay prove useful for a greater understand-\ning of pure microphthalmia.\nThe shape of the central cornea is import-\nant for understanding its refractive index.\nThickness measurements at nine corneal\nlocations determined that 75% of eyes in\nour patient group were in a state of false\nkeratoconus. In patients, the central and\ntemporal corneal areas were the thinnest,\nwhile the thickest areas were in the nasal and\nsuperior regions. This may be due to\nglycosaminoglycan depositions in the scleral\nand corneal fibres resulting in abnormal\ncollagen or elastic fibres, or damage and\nthickening of the sclera and cornea. Since\ncentral corneal thickness may affect intrao-\ncular pressure,11 its measurement could\nhelp with correct diagnosis of early glau-\ncoma in patients with progressive pure\nmicrophthalmia.\nThe present study has several limitations,\nincluding its small sample size and bias\nassociated with the single-centre design.\nIn conclusion, we describe changes in\ncorneal morphology that could be useful in\nborderline situations to confirm the diagno-\nsis of pure microphthalmia.\nTable 3.
