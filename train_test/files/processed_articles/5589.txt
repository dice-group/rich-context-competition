    "abstract": "Abstract\n\"Climate change scepticism\" is a familiar concept in popular and scholarly discourse and generally refers to a family of\narguments and individuals that reject, dispute, or question the orthodox view of the climate issue. At close range though,\nit is evident that the concept is often used casually, without consideration of the complexity of the category it represents.\nScholars have varied interpretations of the concept and sometimes actively dispute its meaning and reach. The article\nproposes that the sceptic phenomenon can be variegated according to the types of sceptic critiques and, additionally,\naccording to sceptics' attitudinal characteristics. Taxonomies are proposed for each. The types of sceptic arguments are\norganised in a conceptual hierarchy consisting of two classes of critiques (\"core\" and \"concomitant\"), three centers of\nscepticism (\"evidence,\" \"process,\" and \"response\"), and seven specific objects of scepticism. For the attitudinal characteristics\nof sceptics, the article takes stock of the different motives, modes, and certainties of belief among sceptics. It proposes some\nrelabeling of the category and subcategories to more accurately describe nuances in sceptic positions, as well as to dispose\nof unproductive labels. The article suggests how the refined conceptualisation might help observers and policy practitioners\nto manage the sceptic challenge in a more discerning and constructive fashion.\n",

The concept has a strong nega-\ntive connotation because nonacceptance of the mainstream\nthesis is generally considered indefensible given the estab-\nlished nature of the science and the gravity of the problem.\nThe concept is often used as a means to isolate and delegiti-\nmise arguments and individuals assigned to the category.\nMainstream exponents have little difficulty labeling critics of\nthe orthodoxy as \"sceptics\" or \"deniers.\" For many main-\nstream adherents, it does not matter if one positively rejects,\ndisputes, or is merely unconvinced, ambivalent, or agnostic\nabout the core climate claims. The net effect is the same: non-\nacceptance of a thesis about which no doubt should exist.\nThis article critically reexamines the conceptual constitu-\ntion of the category. It is noted that sceptics from different\nwalks of life and with different levels of expertise deliver a\nwide array of critiques at the mainstream thesis and display a\nwide range of intensities of belief (or nonbelief). Some act as\nvocal public champions of the sceptic cause while others\nreservedly express unease about the reliability of the science.\nSome evidently exploit the issue for personal gain and others\nare seen to raise their critiques as concerned and responsible\ncitizens. These shades of the phenomenon are largely lost in\nboth the public and scholarly discourse where the blanket\nlabels climate change scepticism/denial and climate change\nsceptic/denier still dominate. And on occasions where the\nconcept is being disentangled, some contestation of the con-\ncept and its labels remains evident (Capstick & Pidgeon,\nFollowing Capstick and Pidgeon's (2014) identification\nof \"two broad treatments\" of the concept, namely, in relation\nto its epistemic and behavioural senses, this article sets out a\nscheme for its further delineation (p. 390).

It is argued that these three conceptual\n1The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nWillem Van Rensburg, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Brisbane,\nEmail: w.jansevanrensburg@uq.edu.au\nClimate Change Scepticism: A\nConceptual Re-Evaluation\nWillem Van Rensburg1\n Keywords\nclimate change, global warming, scepticism, skepticism, denial, science communication, climate policy, climate mitigation,\nIPCC\n2 SAGE Open\nstations allow observers to draw important qualitative dis-\ntinctions between sceptics based on where their scepticism is\nanchored. It also helps to show the various ways in which\nsceptic logic \"flows,\" for instance, from the evidence center\nto the process and response centers, or from the process cen-\nter to the evidence and response centers. It is an important\nproposition in this analysis that the process center is under-\nrated as a primary source of scepticism from which sceptics\nmight derive their evidence and response misgivings. The\narticle also reflects on the attitudinal variety among sceptics,\nthat is, their different qualities of belief, as well as the labels\nto describe these. Effort is made to dispose of inaccurate and\ncounterproductive labeling practices.\nImproved conceptualisation of climate change scepticism\nhas both academic and practical benefit. The following areas\nstand out where advances could be made in reducing misin-\nterpretation of the phenomenon and mismanagement of the\nsceptic challenge.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Climate change scepticism among elites and intellec-\ntuals is often constructed as rooted in and motivated\nby extraepistemic concerns. The scholarly narrative of\nthe scepticism of elites is that it is primarily an artifact\nof material, political, and ideological forces and that\nthe evidence dispute is a mere smoke screen for these\nforces to play out (see Gelbspan, 2004; Hamilton,\n2010). The story of climate change scepticism is one\nof self-interest and manipulation, of how a scientific\ncontroversy was fabricated to confuse the public and\ndecision makers, and delay decisive action against cli-\nmate change. The logic in this story line is that scep-\ntics are actually defending, knowingly and\nunknowingly, vested economic interests (those with a\nstake in the continuation of a fossil fuel\u00adbased energy\neconomy) and the prevailing neoliberal free market\nparadigm (which includes the notions of individual\nfreedom, small government, and economic growth).\nAlthough such observations about climate change\nscepticism and sceptics are well founded, they have\ncome at a cost. Sceptic elites of various persuasions\nand motivations have come to be understood as disin-\ngenuous. Engagement of sceptics has become cli-\nch\u00e9d--married to the idea that there simply must be\nextraneous reasons for someone to doubt the main-\nstream climate view.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Another area of potential misjudgment emanates from\nthe tendency of exponents on both sides to draw stark\nbattle lines between \"credible experts\" and \"fraud-\nsters,\" between \"sound\" science and \"junk\" science,\nand between respectable scientific establishments and\npseudoscientific lobbies. These debates are important\nin helping to clear the scientific air, but when they are\nsweepingly cast as a battle between right and wrong,\ncompetent and incompetent, and reputable and disrep-\nutable, the opposing side is reduced to a one-dimen-\nsional stereotype. In the process, opportunities are lost\nfor the constructive engagement of amenable sceptics.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Potential miscalculation might also occur through mis-\ninterpretation of sceptics' \"extended\" critiques.\nSceptics very rarely confine their critiques to the phys-\nical evidence of climate change. They often, and\nexpectedly so, extend their arguments to climate rele-\nvant topics, such as debates about the integrity of the\nscientific processes behind the evidence for dangerous\nhuman-caused climate change or debates about soci-\nety's response to the climate issue. The dilemma is that\nalthough their extended arguments are commensurate\nwith their readings of the science, sceptics are not the\nonly proprietors of these arguments. Many nonscep-\ntics, particularly among right-wing partisans but not\nexclusively so, are, just like the sceptics, concerned\nabout perceived deficiencies in the processes behind\nclimate science and/or climate policy responses. It is\nimportant, therefore, to place the respective types of\nsceptic critiques into proper perspective.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Most mainstream adherents view the sceptic chal-\nlenge as a grave threat to the credibility of climate sci-\nence because it is perceived to undermine the science,\nrather than enhance it. Cook states that climate change\nscepticism is \"the complete opposite\" of genuine sci-\nentific scepticism: \"It's coming to a preconceived\nconclusion and cherry picking the information that\nbacks up your opinion. Global warming scepticism\nisn't scepticism at all\" (Mulvaney, 2010). The prob-\nlem with this kind of generalised dismissal of climate\nscepticism is that sceptics invert such dismissals as\nproof of their initial concern that scientific processes\nare not transparent and open to scrutiny. There is a\nneed, therefore, to consider if and how sceptics' cri-\ntiques might be used constructively to demonstrate\nrigour and due process in climate science.\nThe rest of the article is organised into two main sections,\nthe first to investigate the types of sceptic critiques, that is, the\nobjects of scepticism, and the second to investigate the attitu-\ndinal variety among sceptics, that is, their motives, modus\noperandi, and the certainties of belief that they bring to the\ndebate. Each section ends with a proposal for a taxonomy.\nThe conclusion of the article raises some practical applica-\ntions of a refined conceptualisation of the phenomenon.\nObjects of Scepticism\nEvidence Scepticism (Trend, Cause, and Impact\nScepticism)\nRahmstorf (2005) pioneered the trend\u00adattribution\u00adimpact\ntypology of climate change scepticism, which disentangles\nVan Rensburg 3\nsceptics' challenge of the scientific evidence of anthropo-\ngenic climate change. This approach assumes that sceptics\nfollow a \"stepped\" pattern of scepticism with trend scepti-\ncism, that is, denying a significant warming trend or pro-\nclaiming a cooling trend, at the pinnacle. Attribution\nscepticism would be one step down on the scepticism ladder\nbecause it might accept the trend claim but not that humans\nare primarily responsible. Impact scepticism would be\nanother step down because it might accept that humans are\naltering the climate but downplays the scale of potential neg-\native effects from climate change. The trend\u00adattribution\u00ad\nimpact typology enjoys wide currency. Wikipedia (2014)\ndefines climate change denial as a set of organised attempts\nto downplay, deny, or dismiss the scientific consensus on the\nextent of global warming (trend claim), its significance\n(impact claim), and its connection to human behavior (attri-\nbution claim). The typology has also been expressed as\n\"stages\" of denialism, where a sceptic might start off as a\ntrend sceptic but, as the evidence of global warming mounts,\nmigrate to attribution scepticism and, again, as the evidence\nof human influence on the climate mounts, migrate to impact\nRahmstorf's typology is realistic and useful because it mir-\nrors the evidence claims made in Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) assessment reports, the most authori-\ntative account of the mainstream thesis. The first three chap-\nters of the last complete IPCC Assessment Report, AR4\npublished in 2007,2 respectively deal with the trend of climate\nchange, its causes, and its impacts (see Pachauri, Reisinger, &\nCore Writing Team, 2007). AR4 states that \"Warming of the\nclimate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from obser-\nvations of increases in global average air and ocean tempera-\ntures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global\naverage sea level\" (p. 30). This is the so-called trend claim. It\nalso finds that \"Most of the observed increase in global aver-\nage temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due\nto the observed increase in anthropogenic GHG concentra-\ntions\" (p. 39).This is the so-called attribution claim. Regarding\nthe impacts of climate change, the report describes different\nscenarios for different warming stabilisation levels. At a 2 \u00b0C\nabove 20th-century average temperature stabilisation level\n(the lowest modeled by AR4), it foresees \"hundreds of mil-\nlions of people exposed to increased water stress,\" \"increased\ndamage from floods and storms,\" \"changed distribution of\nsome disease vectors,\" and \"increased morbidity and mortality\nfrom heat waves, floods and droughts.\" These, and many more\nregion specific predictions, are the so-called impact claims.\nThese claims are fairly unequivocal, and mainstream\nexponents generally accept them as the core claims of the\nmainstream climate thesis about which no doubt should exist.\nSometimes, sceptics respond to the core claims in equally\nunequivocal terms, such as in the following examples:\nEarth's temperature is currently cooling slightly, ocean heat is\ndeclining, global sea-level rise has not accelerated (although the\nclimate models predict that it should) and tropical storm energy\nThe warmists are correct that CO2 is a greenhouse gas and it\ncauses warming, that CO2 levels have been rising, and that it has\nbeen warming. Serious sceptics agree with all that, but point out\nthat it does not prove that something else isn't causing most of\nThere is no evidence that man's production of carbon dioxide is\ncausing more extreme weather events. Any change caused by\nman will be gradual and there will be plenty of time to adapt, as\nhumans have always done. Most people will hardly notice it.\nMore typically, however, sceptic responses are convo-\nluted, which can make it difficult to pinpoint their specific\nobjects of scepticism, as seen in the following statement\nfrom the Australian sceptic group, The Carbon Sense\nCoalition (Forbes, 2013a). The author's comments appear in\nsquare brackets.\nThe so called greenhouse gases (mainly water vapour and\ncarbon dioxide) have the ability to absorb radiant energy and\ntransmit it to their surroundings [accepting the potential\ncontribution of CO2 to global warming] . . . carbon dioxide\noccurs in tiny trace amounts in the atmosphere, and any surface\nheating it could do is already being done by water vapour [not\nrejecting but downplaying the attribution claim], which is more\nabundant and affects far more energy wavelengths. . . . It\nprobably makes the nights slightly warmer, especially in higher\nlatitudes during winter; and it probably has little effect on\ndaytime temperatures [limited acceptance of the trend claim].\nBut additional carbon dioxide in the biosphere gives a major\nboost to all plants which feed all animals [downplaying negative\nimpacts]. It is not a pollutant, anywhere [rhetorically\nindemnifying CO2]. (http://carbon-sense.com/, The Carbon\nSense Coalition, The Global Warming Gas, or The Bread and\nIt is proposed here that the trend, attribution, and impact\nobjects constitute the core of the concept \"climate change\nscepticism\" because they correlate directly, one-to-one, with\nthe core assertions of the mainstream climate thesis. If the\nconcept is to be preserved in its commonsense meaning as\nthe antithetical climate view, that is, not just any problematic\nclimate view, then the primacy of its grounding in the evi-\ndence dispute should be accepted. That the evidence dispute\nshould serve as the definitional heart of the concept is implic-\nitly recognised in studies that present frameworks that place\nthe evidence dimension at the \"top\" or categorically preced-\nexplicit in this regard when they find that attribution scepti-\ncism was \"a common source of impact, mitigation and global\nco-operation scepticism\" (p. 25).\n4 SAGE Open\nThe importance of specifying the evidence dispute as the\ndefinitional heart of the concept will become clearer in the\nsubsequent sections that discuss sceptics' \"extended\" argu-\nments, that is, aspects of the climate debate that are natively\ncommensurate with evidence scepticism but not dependent\non it (collectively referred to as \"concomitant\" objects of\nscepticism).\nProcess Scepticism\nSceptics make various critiques of the scientific, bureau-\ncratic, and political processes behind mainstream climate\nscience. Their arguments about the scientific processes\ninclude that the massive funding of climate research has\nbecome a biasing factor in climate research, that important\n\"new\" and contradictory research is habitually overlooked\nin mainstream climate research, that there are serious lapses\nin peer review and oversight of published research (in par-\nticular, IPCC reports are seen as consensus documents,\nrather than scientific \"truth\"), and that overreliance on and\nmanipulation of computer modeling is distorting climate\nresearch. The political decision-making processes relating\nto the climate issue are also directly and indirectly ques-\ntioned by sceptics when they claim that the climate issue\nmight be a hoax or conspiracy and that prominent main-\nstream exponents and the media exaggerate the climate\nThe context of these suspicions is that the public is being\nmisled and that public decision-making processes are\ndistorted.\nAlthough sceptics' process critiques are well recognised\nas an integral part of sceptic arguments, these have hitherto\nnot been presented as a separate center of scepticism.\nCapstick and Pidgeon (2014) place doubts about the conduct\nof science, the reliability of mainstream climate expertise,\nand the portrayal and communication of climate science in\nthe same category as the disputation of the physical evidence,\nwhich they collectively call \"epistemic scepticism\" (pp. 390-\ntional purpose, namely, to cast doubt on \"the status and\ngeneration of knowledge around climate change.\"\nIt is argued here that sceptics' process critiques require a\ndistinct conceptual status. The concept process scepticism\nsets apart a group of sceptic arguments that are not dependent\non either evidence or response scepticism but enables and\nstrengthens them. It is proposed that \"process scepticism\" is\na strong center of scepticism and that many sceptics are\nindeed anchored in this center, rather than the detailed tech-\nnical contests around the evidence or how society should\nrespond. The process critiques (e.g., there is a lucrative cli-\nmate industry, scientists pursue funding and shut out dissent-\ningvoices,themediaexaggeratesthethreat,environmentalists\nand socialists drive the climate agenda) appeal intuitively to\nsceptics, who are strongly oriented in the climate issue by\ncognitive, cultural, and ideological predispositions (Kahan,\ncess critiques are conspicuously present in the affective\nimagery cognitive processes responsible for climate change\n\"Process scepticism,\" therefore, offers a conceptual\noption that allows observers to draw distinctions between\nthree centers of scepticism, the other two being evidence and\nresponse scepticism. It helps to differentiate sceptics of the\nphysical evidence who extend their sceptic assault to process\nissues (and ultimately the response question) from those who\nhave no clear knowledge of, or judgment about, the evidence\nand ground their apprehensions in perceived process irregu-\nlarities and response deficiencies.\nProcess critiques also differ from evidence critiques in\nthat they can be held by nonsceptics. Mike Hulme, a former\nlead author at the IPCC and patently nonsceptical of the\nmainstream thesis, has been publicly critical of the IPCC's\nemphasis on \"consensus building\" (Hulme & Mahony, 2010,\npp. 10-11), its reluctance to allow scrutiny (Hulme &\nMahony, 2013), as well as the apparent closing of ranks by\nthe climate scientists at the center of the so-called Climategate\nrevelations (Hulme, 2013b). Process scepticism is therefore\nopen to sceptics and nonsceptics alike, whereas evidence\nscepticism, by definition, excludes the nonsceptics.\nResponse Scepticism\nSeveral observers recognise that scepticism of the public and\nprivate responses to the climate issue is an important center\nof scepticism. Hamilton (2013) argues that response scepti-\ncism is one of the common themes in the family of sceptic\narguments:\nFirst, they deny that climate change is occurring. Then they say\nthat if it is occurring it's not due to humans. Then they claim that\nif it is due to humans, the effects are trivial. If the effects are\nshown to be non-trivial, they opine that the benefits will exceed\nthe damage. If the damage is shown to predominate, they say the\ncost of avoiding the damage is too high.\nPainter is more emphatic and includes \"policy sceptics\"\nCapstick and Pidgeon (2014) offer a two-pronged typology\nwith \"response scepticism\" as the second type next to \"epis-\ntemic scepticism\". In their conceptualisation, \"response\nscepticism\" concerns \"(D)oubts about the efficacy of action\non climate change; doubts about the personal and societal\npropose five dimensions of scepticism, the first three of\nwhich relate to the evidential base of climate science, and the\nlast two, which they call \"mitigation scepticism\" and \"global\nco-operation scepticism,\" relating to society's response to\nthe climate issue (p. 3). For some, response scepticism repre-\nsents the epitome of climate change scepticism. SourceWatch\ndefines a \"global warming sceptic\" as\nVan Rensburg 5\nany position within the umbrella group, \"opponents of effective\nglobal warming action,\" where \"effective action\" entails putting\na price on fossil fuel emissions, such that their true cost becomes\nclear and the economic \"invisible hand\" can wreak its market\nIt could be argued that sceptics would be impelled, on the\nbasis of their contrary reading of climate science, to oppose\nclimate mitigation responses. The majority of sceptics do, in\nfact, follow the logic of their evidence scepticism through in\nthis way. Yet, some scholars caution that there is no straight\nline between scientific evidence and one's choice of response;\nthat a certain reading of the science does not necessarily\nimply a certain policy preference. Research has shown that\npeople's support for climate mitigation depends significantly\non factors other than their assessment of the probability and\nseverity of future climate risks. Lee and Cameron (2008)\nfound that willingness to pay for climate mitigation varies\naccording to the domestic instrument of choice, as well as the\ninternational level of cooperation. The point is also argued\nphilosophically, for instance, Hulme (2013a), who calls for a\n\"repoliticise(ation of) climate change, to challenge the scien-\nticism which suggests that science should trump politics\"\n. . . science has little or no special role in determining should we\nact to curtail climate change and how we should act. This path\nmust be picked up by economists, social scientists, ethicists,\nhumanists, and the general public. (p. 336)\nThe ambiguity between science and policy is nowhere\nclearer than in the case of the impact sceptics. Impact scepti-\ncism is commensurate with a wide range of possible policy\nresponses. Some impact sceptics dismiss mitigation because\nfor them it is addressing a nonexistent problem. Others have\na pragmatic view, believing that even if they do not expect\nsevere negative climate impacts, climate mitigation mea-\nsures might deliver positive spin-offs in terms of greater\nenergy efficiency and the promotion of cleaner technologies\n(Van Rensburg, 2012). In addition, impact sceptics find\nthemselves aligned with nonsceptics who oppose mitigation\nbecause they doubt the cost-effectiveness of such measures,\nnot because they doubt the negative impacts of climate\nchange. The controversial Danish economist Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg,\nwho advocates an alternative response path purely based on\ncost\u00adbenefit considerations, is an example (Lomborg, 2009).\nThe differences between impact scepticism and response\nscepticism blur when sceptics appropriate the arguments of\nnonsceptics like Lomborg to open another line of attack\nagainst the climate change orthodoxy and its supposed eco-\nnomic imperatives.\nThe ambiguity of opposition to climate policies is also\ndemonstrated by left-wing critiques of carbon pricing mech-\nanisms. A few examples from the Australian context are\nquoted here. The Green Left Weekly (Butler, 2012), the\nmouthpiece of a socialist environmentalist activist group,\ndescribes the climate change debate as a \"fake\" debate\nbecause the outcomes of the two big national parties' (the\ncenter\u00adright Liberal\u00adNational Party [L-NP] Coalition and\nthe center\u00adleft Australian Labor Party [ALP]) climate poli-\ncies would be very similar. Calling the L-NP Coalition \"cli-\nmate deniers\" and the ALP climate \"pretenders,\" it argues\nthat even though the ALP is more ambitious than the L-NP\nCoalition, its policies too would be too little too late. \"To act\nslowly or to act not at all matters little. Both will bring the\nexact same result--an unspeakable future of climate catas-\ntrophe.\" The group is convinced that the reigning economic\nmodel cannot solve the climate problem: \". . . the biggest\n(problem) is that it assumes we can solve the climate crisis\nwith the same kind of thinking that got us into it.\" Carbon\npricing, as an \"indirect lever to bring emissions down\" is dis-\nmissed in favor of \"direct measures\" such as the outright pro-\nhibition of fossil fuel extraction, closing fossil fuel\ninfrastructure and deploying renewable sources of energy.\nThe Green Left Weekly argument is echoed by the leftist blog\nEn Passant (Passant, 2013), which describes the \"discourse\nbetween the Government and Opposition\" as \"irrelevant.\"\n\"Labor doesn't have a commitment to the environment. It\nhas a commitment to capitalism and getting elected.\" Just\nlike the Green Left Weekly, it argues that carbon pricing will\nnot solve the problem--\"capitalism cannot address climate\nchange.\" En Passant calls for \"system change\" before there\ncould be any hope of addressing climate change.\nThese sentiments are not confined to Australian environ-\nmentalists. Naomi Klein, Canadian anticorporatism, antiglo-\nbalisation, and environmentalist writer and activist, believes\nthat the environmental movement is in \"deep denial\" about\nthe failure of carbon pricing to deliver big emission cuts\n(Mark, 2013). She argues that climate initiatives like the\nKyoto Protocol, the UN Clean Development Mechanism,\nand the EU Emissions Trading Scheme have \"disastrous\"\ntrack records. They have not reduced emissions, are charac-\nterised by \"no end of scams,\" and have resulted in a massive\n\"corporate giveaway.\" Caught up in the \"neoliberal eco-\nnomic orthodoxy\" many environmentalists have bought into\nthe notion that corporations are part of the solution. She\nargues that environmentalists should have \"fought back,\"\n\"defend(ed) the values it stood for,\" and \"resist(ed) the\nsteamroller that was neoliberalism.\" She argues that environ-\nmental victories in the past have come through \"command-\nand-control\" pieces of legislation; a \"top-down regulatory\napproach.\"\nResponse scepticism is the most distant from evidence\nscepticism, which is the definitional heart of climate change\nscepticism. Because it speaks to matters of governance that\nhave relevance quite independent from the climate issue, like\nthe desired level of government regulation, the timing and\nefficacy of tax/pricing mechanisms, and strategic consider-\nations of a nation's global responsibilities and capabilities,\nresponse scepticism is accessible to a much wider general\naudience. Reserving a unique conceptual space for response\n6 SAGE Open\nscepticism allows discrimination between sceptics who are\ngrounded in evidence critiques and those who are more con-\ncerned about the broader governance issues associated with\nclimate responses.\nProposal for a Taxonomy\nFigure 1 shows how the aforementioned types of sceptic\narguments can be conceptually organised. At the lowest level\nof classification, sceptic critiques belong to one of seven spe-\ncific \"objects\" or targets of scepticism. Considering the\nnature of each of these specific sceptic targets, three \"cen-\ntres\" of scepticism emerge. The three centers--evidence,\nprocess, and response--provide a neat categorisation that\nprovides a home for the technical evidence dispute, a home\nfor arguments about the processes through which the evi-\ndence pass beyond the laboratory, and finally a home for\narguments about how society should respond to the evidence\n(or perceived lack of evidence). At the top level of categori-\nsation, the centers of scepticism divide into two broad classes\nof sceptic arguments. The evidence critiques are labeled core\nand definitional--\"core\" because of their antecedent nature\nand \"definitional\" to preserve the integrity of \"climate\nchange scepticism\" as the antithetical climate view. The pro-\ncess and response critiques are labeled concomitant3 because\nthey are commensurate with but not dependent on evidence\nscepticism. The core class of critiques defines a sceptic as a\nsceptic and attracts the concomitant class of critiques that are\nhighly congruent with and supportive of evidence scepti-\ncism. In many cases, the concomitant arguments dominate\nsceptics'argumentative rationales. They are widely acknowl-\nedged as integrally part of the sceptic identity.\nThe distinction between core and concomitant types of\ncritiques remain important though. An individual's scepti-\ncism might primarily reside in the concomitant objects, from\nwhere evidence deficiencies are inferred, without the person\nmaking (or able to make) an informed assessment of the\nphysical science. Individuals who are rooted in the concomi-\ntant objects of scepticism might be expected to be less rigor-\nous and less intense when they profess their views because\nthey have not committed to one or more of the core evidence\nobjects, like the more virulent and outspoken sceptics.\nObservers and policy practitioners dealing with the sceptic\nchallenge need to approach the concomitant critiques with\ncaution because they can be, and are, held by nonsceptics as\nwell.\nTable 1 provides some examples of typical sceptical\nclaims associated with each object of scepticism.\nThis taxonomy makes clear the bases for drawing dis-\ntinctions among sceptics and their arguments, and might be\nused as a practical tool to classify sceptics, bearing in mind,\nthough, that sceptics can be rhetorically skillful and that\nthey often couch or hedge their claims. Also, most sceptics\ncritique a casual mix of variously the evidence, processes,\nand responses associated with the mainstream view, which\ncan make it difficult to determine their essential dispute or\nconcern. The challenge, from an analytical point of view, is\nto establish where the weight of an individual's sceptic\nclaims rests, or which object(s) are instrumental in their\narguments. Such analysis would allow meaningful and pur-\nposeful discrimination within the sceptic category, the\nimplications of which are highlighted in the \"Conclusion\"\nsection.\nThe article now proceeds to deal with additional bases for\nvariegating the sceptic phenomenon. These are collectively\ncalled \"attitudinal\" characteristics because they speak to the\ncharacter or quality of sceptics' beliefs, which might be evi-\ndent through their presumed motives, the way they conduct\nthemselves, and the degree of certainty with which they\nexpress their views (boldness of language).\nEvidence\nImpact\nCore\n(class of definional arguments)\nCause\nTrend Scienfic\nknowledge\ngeneraon\nprocesses\nClimate\ndecision\nmaking\nprocesses\nPolicy\ninstruments\nPolicy style\nResponse\nProcess\nConcomitant\n(class of extended arguments)\nCentres of\nscepcism\nObjects of\nscepcism\nFigure 1. Conceptual hierarchy of sceptic critiques.\nVan Rensburg 7\nAttitudinal Characteristics of Sceptics\nDifferent Motivations and Modes\nSome observers have tried to distinguish between sceptics on\nthe basis of their motivations and, consequently, the modes\nthey have chosen for airing their views. Most of these\nattempts are premised on the argument that some sceptics are\nmerely using their climate views to advance their material\nand/or ideological interests, and because of this deception,\nthey should be considered qualitatively different to those\nwho are truly mistaken or misguided about the climate issue.\nPainter thinks it is useful to distinguish between \"organ-\nised scepticism linked to well-funded bodies\" and \"individ-\nPowell (cited in Walker, 2014) distinguishes between \"pro-\nfessional science deniers\" who do it for money or ideological\nreasons and scientists who are \"contrarian by nature,\" who\nrevel in being different and provocative and seriously believe\nthey are advancing the science by questioning the orthodox-\nies. This typology is closely replicated by Diethelm and\nMcKee's (2009) distinction between those driven by \"greed,\"\n\"ideology,\" or \"faith\" and those driven by \"eccentricity and\nidiosyncrasy\" (p. 3). Rahmstorf (2005) proposes three scep-\ntic \"archetypes\": paid lobbyists (those in the pay of fossil\nfuel interests), Don Quixotists (those who are \"emotionally\ncommitted\"), and eccentrics (scholars from other scientific\ndisciplines) (p. 79). Hamilton (2014) offers three categories\nof sceptics based on their inner motives: first, the manufac-\nturers of doubt, who deceive the public with their lies; sec-\nond, the repeaters of the lies, who amplify the views of the\nmanufacturers for political and personal reasons; and third,\nthe consumers of the lies (the public), who are seduced by\nthe manufacturers and repeaters and resort to \"casual denial\"\nfor any number of psychological reasons.\nWhat these different typologies have in common is that\nthey make a basic distinction between those who have ulte-\nrior motives with their climate scepticism and those who are\nsimply mistaken and/or misguided. For many observers, this\nis an important distinction because it adds a moral dimension\nto their analysis. It is a distinction fraught with danger\nthough. It would be extremely difficult (impossible indeed)\nto factually show or in some other way objectively assess\nsomeone's inner motivations, especially when the person in\nquestion is suspected of being disingenuous. And by assign-\ning some inner extraepistemic motivation to participants in\nthe debate, by claiming some corruption of the mind by\nmoney, ideology, or politics, resentment and polarisation in\nthe climate debate is merely perpetuated and exacerbated.\nA distinction cast, though, between original thinkers (the\noriginators of sceptic critique) and the propagators or repro-\nducers of their thinking, might circumvent the problem of\ninner motivation and moral character, without blunting the\naccountability of the most egregious sceptics for their\nactions.

The underlying\nassumption of such a distinction is that the originators actu-\nally scrutinised the science and that the reproducers are\naccepting what they say on trust and intuition. A greater\nonus, therefore, rests on the originators to get their science\nright, particularly if they arrive at antithetical conclusions.\nThey can and should be judged to a higher standard because\nthey speak from some position of authority and command the\ntrust of others.\nDifferent Certainties of Belief\nThere are qualitative differences between someone who\nemphatically rejects the mainstream climate thesis, someone\nwho disputes aspects of it, someone who feels doubtful, and\nsomeone who feels undecided (agnostic). Most common in\nthe literature is a twofold distinction between \"rejectionists\"\n(those who dismiss the mainstream climate thesis or key\naspects of it outright) and those who are uncertain or harbor\nreservations about the veracity of the scientific claims. In a\nstudy of public opinion in the United States, Leiserowitz,\nMaibach, and Roser-Renouf (2009) found a range of seven\nclimate change opinion categories,4 two of which correspond\nto climate change scepticism, namely, \"doubtful\" and \"dis-\nmissive.\" The \"dismissive\" category differs from the doubt-\nful category in terms of the strength of their belief and their\nactive engagement of the issue (Leiserowitz et al., 2009, p.\n4). Cook et al. (2013) distinguish between those \"uncertain\"\nof the mainstream thesis and those \"rejecting\" it (p. 3).\nPainter's (2012) typology talks of those holding a \"falsely\nbalanced view\" (not knowing what to believe) and those\nholding a \"dismissive view\" (believing that the climate is not\nchanging or that humans are not responsible for changes) (p.\n\"sceptical\" group that is doubtful about climate change and a\nmuch more active and organised \"denier\" group that is work-\ning to discredit climate change science (p. 5). The distinction\nbetween rejectionists/dismissers and doubters provides a\ngood measure of the intensity of their beliefs, for the rejec-\ntionists are unlikely to embark on the level of activism and\ncategorical denial characteristic of their group if they did not\nhold such beliefs deeply. Studies have, in fact, found that\ncertainty of belief is an important distinguishing quality\nbetween groups of sceptics, with the rejectionists feeling\nvery certain about their views, whereas those who are uncer-\ntain/reserved feel less certain about their views (Leiserowitz\nThe reject/dismiss category is stable and does not reduce\nto subcategories. The doubtful category, however, subdivides\nin multiple ways, depending on the analyst's preferences.\nLeiserowitz et al.'s (2009) \"doubtful\" category is subdivided\ninto three: those believing in the trend of climate change but\nnot its human cause and seriousness, those not believing in\nthe trend, and those who don't know (p. 4). Brin (2010a,\n2010b) identifies three sceptic groups that are distinct from\nthe extreme category, namely, climate agnostics, climate\ndenial followers (the gullible, \"koolaid-drinking\" tools of a\npropaganda machine), and rational, open-minded, prosci-\nence people who are motivated by curiosity to ask legitimate\nquestions of the mainstream thesis.\nThere is no easy way to describe and identify the finer\ndistinctions among the doubtful sceptics. Several problems\nare apparent. First, how do we \"spot\" or \"prove\" a sceptic if\nthe individual is very circumspect in his or her views and\nadept at expressing them in sophisticated ways. And even if\nsomeone's scepticism is quite apparent from his or her public\nexpressions, how do we know to what degree he or she has\ntailored the tone and explicitness of his or her expressions to\nthe audience? Second, what amount of criticism and what\ntone would place one sceptic in a more extreme category\nthan another? How do we distinguish between the incessant,\nvocal, and brazen sceptic on one hand and the occasional\nsceptic voice on the other if they share exactly the same criti-\ncisms? And finally, people can be inconsistent when they\nexpress their views. Their arguments might be convoluted, or\nthey might modify their views over time--the so-called\n\"water sloshing in a shallow pan\" effect described by Revkin\n(2010). When individuals are ambiguous in their views,\nwhich expression at which point in time would mark the per-\nson as a particular type of sceptic?\nThese problems should not preclude us from trying to dis-\nentangle the sceptic phenomenon in terms of the different\nqualities and intensities of belief of sceptics. Before attempt-\ning to capture these differences in a taxonomy, the next sec-\ntion first highlights the complexity of settling on a label that\nunites the sceptic category and that does not foreclose options\nfor further subclassification.\nLabeling Complexities\nAlthough there might be general agreement about who quali-\nfies as \"climate change sceptics,\" the label sceptic is con-\ntested. Climate sceptics claim the label because they believe\nthey are simply fulfilling the inclination and duty of any true\nscientist, that they are in fact serving science with their scep-\nticism, and that the mainstream scientists are the ones stuck\nin a rut of groupthink, captive to the vested interests that\nhave accumulated around a supposed climate change \"indus-\ntry\" (Carter, 2008). In contrast, various scholars argue that\nthe \"scepticism\" practiced by climate change sceptics is not\nscepticism in the true sense of the word, and that the label is\nAs a consequence, scholars have been looking for alterna-\ntive labels for the sceptic phenomenon. A popular alternative\nis climate change or global warming \"denial,\" which\nVan Rensburg 9\nscholars have tried to ground theoretically (see Cook &\nnotation with Holocaust denial, indiscriminate use, and com-\nmonsense meaning have all caused serious trouble in the\nclimate debate. Sceptics find the label extremely divisive, to\nthe degree that responses to the label foreclose any meaning-\nful debate. When asked what it would take for him to accept\nthe orthodox position on climate change, Anthony Watts, the\ncreator of one of the most visited sceptic blogs on the\nInternet, Watts Up With That, responded that a \"starting\npoint for the process\" would not begin with more facts but\ninstead with a public apology from the high profile scientists\nwho have labeled him and his colleagues \"deniers\"\n(Merchant, 2011). Politicians who have had to navigate the\nclimate issue also reflect on the counterproductive effect of\nthe label, like formerAustralian Prime Minister John Howard\nIncreasingly offensive language is used. The most egregious\nexample has been the term \"denier.\" We are all aware of the\nparticular meaning that word has acquired in contemporary\nparlance. It has been employed in this debate with some malice\naforethought.\nThe denial label is, strictly speaking, misrepresenting the\nsceptic view. The majority of climate sceptics accept that the\nclimate is changing; many of them agree that human activi-\nties are playing a part in the phenomenon, and a select few\nwould even concede that humans might be the dominant\ncause of current climate trends (the so-called impact scep-\ntics). The trend\u00adattribution\u00adimpact typology, in fact, implies\nthat sceptics are disagreeing with parts (rarely all) of the\nmainstream climate thesis. Furthermore, critique of per-\nceived exaggerations of climate claims, rather than outright\ndenial, is a central feature of sceptic discourse. Whitmarsh\n(2011) found that the perception that media communication\nof climate change is alarmist is the single most common\ncharacteristic among sceptics. It is, therefore, not surprising\nthat sceptics would rhetorically exploit the semblant misrep-\nresentation behind the denier label. By emphatically arguing\ntheir acceptance of climate change and a human contribution\nto it, they are ostensibly positioning themselves closer to the\nmainstream science, portraying their own views as critical\nimprovements of the science, and discrediting their detrac-\ntors for misrepresenting them by calling them climate change\ndeniers.\nAnother alternative label in limited use is \"contrarian\"\nIt carries two commonsense meanings, namely, a position of\nfact, such as in the Oxford Dictionaries (2013): \"opposing or\nrejecting popular opinion or current practice,\" or an attitude,\nsuch as in the Collins English Dictionary (2013): a \"contrary\nor obstinate person.\" It is not an ideal term because of its low\ncurrency (Painter, 2012) and of its connotation with flip-\npancy and obstinacy, which applies to a good number of\nsceptics but certainly not to all. Finally, Jones (2011) pro-\nposes \"confusionists\" as an appropriate label because it best\ndescribes the main goal of climate change scepticism,\nnamely, to promote confusion among the public.\nIn most cases, an observer's choice of label is probably\nfairly arbitrary. It is likely that many observers simply persist\nwith the commonly used \"sceptic\" for purely pragmatic rea-\nsons while acknowledging its messy relationship with labels\nThe article now turns to the task of selecting and justify-\ning categories and labels to describe different qualities of\nscepticism and organising these in a taxonomy.\nProposal for a Taxonomy\nFor the overall category, preference is given to Anderegg,\nSchneider, Harold, and Prall's (2010) label, \"unconvinced of\nthe evidence (UE)\" (p. 12107)5 It accurately reflects the epis-\ntemic position of the full range of sceptics, from the agnostic/\nundecided and doubtful to those who actively dispute or\nreject some or all of the core mainstream claims. The label\nunconvinced avoids contestation over the badge scepticism,\nthe positive scientific norm to which both sides in the debate\nare laying claim to. Avoiding the \"scepticism/sceptic\" badge\naltogether would help to limit tangential arguments about\nwho are truly following the scientific tradition, and would\ndeny the semblance of credibility enjoyed by sceptics, many\nof whom in actual fact practice a very low standard of scien-\ntific scepticism.\nSubcategorisations are shown in Table 2. At the first level\nof subcategorisation, the scheme accommodates the wide\nagreement among scholars and observers that there is a sig-\nnificant qualitative difference between the most extreme\nsceptics and the rest, hence the uncertain\u00adreject dichotomy.\nIt is appropriate to use the label uncertain to separate the\nmilder forms of scepticism from the rejectionists. The rejec-\ntionists represent the most vociferous and blatant sceptic per-\nsuasions. They are also far from uncertain in their views.\nStudies have shown that those at the most extreme end of the\nscepticism scale feel very confident in their dismissal of cli-\nmate change evidence (Leiserowitz et al., 2009; Whitmarsh,\n2011). The taxonomy steers clear of the labels denier and\ncontrarian due to their semantic connotations to Holocaust\ndenial and personal pettiness.\nThe third and final level of subcategorisation subdivides\nthe \"uncertain\" group into agnostics, doubters, and disputers\nto reflect varying degrees and intensities of scepticism in this\ngroup. Including the agnostic/undecided here alongside the\ndoubters and disputers is justified because the net effect of\ntheir position is the same as that of the other sceptics, namely,\nnonacceptance of core climate change claims that should be\nbeyond doubt, given the established and advanced nature of\nthe science, the exceptionally high degree of scientific con-\nsensus prevailing, and the severity of the problem. The dis-\ntinctions drawn in the taxonomy are, admittedly, subjective,\nbut they are necessary to capture finer nuances in the sceptic\nphenomenon.\nThe proposed taxonomy reflects different intensities of\nclimate change scepticism. For instance, a person emphati-\ncally rejecting the entire mainstream climate thesis is more\nlikely to hold such views strongly and to actively chal-\nlenge mainstream science than someone who is merely\ndoubtful of some key claims. A degree of mobility between\nthese categories can be assumed. For instance, it is con-\nceivable that extraneous events like a particularly hot sum-\nmer may shift someone from \"doubtful\" to \"undecided\"\nand vice versa. The most extreme end of the spectrum can\nbe expected to be stable because the individuals at this\nposition are likely to have rationalised their views at length\nand may find themselves heavily invested in this position\nin terms of professional prestige and opportunities for pub-\nlic exposure. Unavoidably, the labels are open to some\ndegree of interpretation and are not entirely mutually\nexclusive. They do draw recognisable distinctions though,\nand dispose of the two most problematic ones, namely,\n\"sceptic\" and \"denier.\"\nConclusion\nThis article proposes a conceptual design of climate change\nscepticism that might help an observer to draw both gross\nand subtle distinctions in the phenomenon. The evidence\nchallenge is placed at the core of what it means to be a cli-\nmate sceptic, with concomitant objects of scepticism moved\nto more neutral conceptual ground. The different certainties\nof sceptic belief are also relabeled for greater semantic accu-\nracy and to dispose of toxic labels. These design elements\nmight help to counter the potential pitfalls in prevailing\nassessments of climate scepticism, noted at the beginning of\nthe article, and might provide important pointers for those\nconcerned with meeting the sceptic challenge.\nFirst, renewed recognition of the nuances in the sceptic\nphenomenon might help to counter the unintended but\nunfortunate ideologising of the debate that had occurred due\nto the intense interest in the extraepistemic drivers of scepti-\ncism. Much of the mainstream response to climate change\nscepticism fail to convince sceptics precisely because the\nscience is skirted for the sake of a grand theory that casts\nsceptics as ill-intentioned rather than ill-informed. And once\nthe motivations of a participant are questioned, there could\nhardly be any chance of constructive dialogue and critique\nthat might improve the quality of the science, the articula-\ntion of the science, or the debate in general. The right\u00ad\nwrong, serious\u00addisingenuous dichotomies that dominate so\nmuch of the debate has made it difficult to engage sceptics\nin a discerning fashion, to direct chagrin at the egregious\nsceptic arguments, and give leeway and credit to those scep-\ntic arguments made in good faith. Pigeonholing sceptics\nwho are sincerely concerned about aspects of the science\nwith those who are egregious and entrenched in their scepti-\ncism has an unnecessarily polarising and politicising effect\non the participants in the debate and their followers.\nSecond, greater awareness of the distinction between core\nand concomitant objects of scepticism might encourage\nobservers and policy practitioners to target their responses.\nClimate change scepticism hinges on the evidential chal-\nlenge. Without a credible (in the eyes of the broader public)\nevidential challenge, either through direct contestation of the\nphysical evidence or doubts about the evidence inferred from\nperceived process or response deficiencies, climate change\nscepticism unravels. By focusing on the core (and presum-\nably refutable) sceptic challenges, observers and policy prac-\ntitioners might avoid getting drawn into the ultimately\npolitical and moral debates typical of sceptics' extended cri-\ntiques. Sceptics have in the past benefited from the resonance\nthat their policy critiques have enjoyed among nonsceptic or\napathetic partisans who oppose incisive climate mitigation\nmeasures, for various reasons. Without negating the potential\nvalue of addressing sceptics' extended arguments (i.e.,\nagainst incisive climate mitigation) in creative ways, the\nvalue of a focused, resolute, and sustained response to scep-\ntics' evidence claims should not be underestimated. It could\nbe argued that the evidence debate provides a neutral and\nstable access point to sceptics and that successful engage-\nment of sceptics on purely evidence-related matters would\nflow on to affect the credibility of sceptics' extended\narguments.\nThird, systematising and formalising the task of classifying\nand labeling sceptics (by use of the two taxonomies) might\nmake it easier to distinguish between those sceptics who stand\ncloser to the mainstream view, and might be amenable to\nTable 2. Certainty of Sceptic Belief: Categories and Labels.\nUnconvinced(instead of sceptical)\nUncertain\nReject/Dismiss (instead of denier\nor contrarian)\nAgnostic/Undecided Doubt Dispute\nMILD\nSCEPTICISM\nEXTREME\nSCEPTICISM\nargumentation methods and communication strategies, and\nthose who are too extreme and entrenched in their views.\nFinally, relocating sceptics' critiques of the scientific and\nbureaucratic processes behind mainstream climate science\nand the implied response imperatives of the mainstream the-\nsis to more neutral conceptual ground \"unmerges\" the scep-\ntic identity and reclaims these issues as legitimate concerns\nfor everyone, not just sceptics. By lowering the defenses on\nthese issues, it might be possible to dislodge the perception\nthat sceptics are the drivers of public reticence and political\nindecision in climate matters. By treating the process and\nresponse issues as areas of legitimate disputation rather than\nan elaborate complex of sceptic provocation, observers and\npolicy practitioners might demonstrate their commitment to\na careful and thorough test of ideas, which might be all that\nis needed to convince those sceptics who are uncertain rather\nthan dismissive of mainstream climate science.\nFuture Research\nCapstick and Pidgeon's (2014) recent investigation of the\nclimate change scepticism concept detected a latent con-\nstruct in the general population's view about climate change,\nwhich they call \"folk psychology.\" This construct includes\nintuitive lay assumptions about human nature, such as \"peo-\nple are too selfish to do anything about climate change\" and\n\"it is not in human nature to respond to problems that won't\nVan Rensburg (2013) identified a host of myths of human\nnature that are particularly recurrent in sceptic discourse, like\nhumans are intelligent, resourceful, resilient, and able to\nadapt to changing environments, yet are also limited in their\ntrue ability to understand, let alone influence or control, the\ncomplex and powerful global climatic system. It is not sur-\nprising that these notions are present in the context of climate\nsceptical thought for they serve an integrative purpose and\nprovide continuity between received information and innate\ninformation. However, it could be argued that folk psychol-\nogy constructs are independently important, that is, that they\nimmediately orient people when they are confronted with the\nclimate issue and that they powerfully colour received infor-\nmation about the evidence, processes, and responses to do\nwith climate change. If that were the case, folk psychology\nmight be identified as a key center of climate scepticism\n(fourth center?), with implications for our conceptual under-\nstanding of the phenomenon.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. A note on terminology: \"Climate change\" is used as shorthand\nfor human-caused or anthropogenic climate change. Because\nthe element of human causation is so central to the climate\nissue, its specification in the label is generally regarded unnec-\nessary. The term is equivalent to the mostly U.S. use of \"global\nwarming.\" In regard to the labels \"scepticism\" and \"sceptics,\"\nthis article argues for more nuanced terminology; however, in\nthe interests of familiarity to the reader, they are used from the\noutset. These terms enjoy wide currency in scholarly, media,\nand popular discourse, and several prominent writers belong-\ning to the category self-describe as \"sceptics\" (Painter, 2012,\n2. The first installment of AR5, its Working Group 1 report,\nwas published in September 2013. In terms of core claims,\nthis report corresponds very closely with AR4. It is not used\nas reference in this article because the examples of sceptic\nclaims analysed here were made in the context of the AR4\nreport.\n3. The label concomitant is preferred as its dictionary meaning\nsuggests that it accompanies a preceding object and often in a\n4. The so-called seven climate change \"audiences\" are labeled\nalarmed, concerned, cautious, disengaged, doubtful, and\ndismissive.\n5. Although I propose that the label unconvinced should replace\nthe label sceptic for the overall category, I have no illusions\nabout the semantic appeal of the compound \"climate change\nsceptic(ism)\" or its entrenchment in popular and scholarly use.\nI would hope, though, that in time the label unconvinced would\nbring more clarity to the discussion.\nReferences\nAkter, S., Bennett, J., & Ward, M.
