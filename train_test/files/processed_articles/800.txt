    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This DataWatch examines national trends in the provision of uncom-\nby modest growth through 1990, a time during which managed care was becom-\ning established in some regions. There was then another spurt in uncompen-\ndisproportionate-share payments. Uncompensated care growth again slowed\nnot to have kept pace with growth in hospital expenses or the number of uninsured.\nHowever, the trend data do not suggest a large-scale reduction of effort.\nBECAUSE THE UNITED STATES lacks universal entitlement,\nthe health care system relies on charitable care by medical\nproviders to serve the 40.6 million uninsured.1 Hospitals, in\nparticular, serve as providers of last resort, a role enforced through\nlegal sanctions against turning away patients with life-threatening\nor urgent conditions. The $17.5 billion in hospitals' uncompensated\ncare costs in 1995, which represented 6 percent of hospital expenses,\nis testament to hospitals' vital role in protecting access to care.2\nHospitals have been able to fund uncompensated care through a\ndelicate balance of internal and external cross-subsidies. To a large\nextent, this balance depends on hospitals' ability to receive reim-\nbursement from paying patients that exceeds the cost of treating\nthose patients, a practice referred to as cost shifting. In a few states,\nthese cross-subsidies are made explicit through uncompensated\ncare trust funds as part of all-payer hospital rate-setting programs or\nthrough the establishment of indigent care subsidies that offset\nsome of the costs of charity care.3 Explicit recognition of the burden\n]oycc Mann is a resident consultant at RAND in Santa Monica, California, and a re-\nsearcher at the California Institutefor Public Health.

Recent analyses by the Prospective\nPayment Assessment Commission (ProPAC) show a striking rela-\ntionship between fiscal pressure from private payers and uncompen-\nsated care provided by hospitals.5 ProPACs findings indicate that\nhospitals facing the most fiscal pressure from private payers greatly\nUnder Medicare's system of national payment rates, hospitals\nface the risk of incurring financial losses on the Medicare share of\ntheir business, which is not inconsequential given that Medicare\naccounts for some 40 percent of hospital revenues on average. This\nwas particularly a threat in the 1980s as Medicare phased in national\ndiagnosis-related group (DRG) payment rates, and many hospitals\nexperienced negative Medicare margins.6\nThe growth ofmanaged care was spurred by the lifting of freedom-\nof-choice guarantees that had precluded payers from limiting sub-\nscribers' choice of provider. This mechanism strengthened the con-\ntractual relationship between payers and providers, which led to\nincreasingly sophisticated specifications about payment terms, fi-\nnancial incentives, and utilization oversight. In so doing, it shifted\nbargaining power from providers to payers. The least price-sensitive\ncustomer segment (the privately insured) became the most price-\nsensitive and had the contractual means to enforce price discipline.\nIn this DataWatch we use data from the American Hospital Asso-\nciation's (AHA's) annual surveys to construct a profile of the provi-\nsion ofuncompensated care by U.S. hospitals. The descriptive analy-\nses report on trends in the aggregate amounts of uncompensated\ncare over time and examine how the burden of uncompensated care\nis distributed by hospital characteristics such as ownership, teach-\ning status, Medicaid volume, Medicare fiscal pressure, and competi-\ntive market pressure. We identify the traditional providers of un-\ncompensated care and examine the extent to which competitive and\nmanaged care pressures place them at financial risk for the future.\nStudy Description: Data And Variable Construction\nThe core data source is the AHA Annual Survey of Hospitals for\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S - Volume 16, Number 4\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Un-\ncompensated care costs consist of charity care and bad-debt charges\ndeflated by a hospital's cost-to-charge ratio.7 To report changes in\nthe uncompensated care burden over time, we constructed several\nrelated measures. To adjust for inflation, we used the AHA hospital\nmarket basket index (which adjusts for changes in the cost of hospi-\ntal inputs) and report each year's uncompensated care costs in terms\nof 1995 constant dollars. However, the rate of change in uncompen-\nsated care costs depends to some extent on the choice of an inflation\ndeflator (for example, use of the Consumer Price Index produces\nslightly different results). Using the ratio of uncompensated care\ncosts to total hospital costs circumvents this problem.\nTo adjust for increases in the number of uninsured persons, a key\ndeterminant of the demand for uncompensated care, we calculated\nthe amount of uncompensated care per uninsured person.8 To nor-\nmalize for the many factors that influence growth in hospital costs\n(for example, technological advances, changes in medical practice\npatterns, and inflation in the prices of medical inputs), we con-\nstructed the ratio of uncompensated care costs per uninsured per-\nson to covered costs per insured person. Covered costs are estimated\nas total hospital expenses less uncompensated care costs. This ratio\ncan be thought of as the amount of hospital expenses devoted to the\nuninsured relative to the insured. For example, a value of 0.30 indi-\ncates that for every dollar of care provided to an insured person,\nthirty cents of care is provided to uninsured persons.\nEstimates of insurance coverage are taken from the U.S. Census\nsurvey methodology in 1988).9 Medicaid share is the proportion of a\nhospital's days that are accounted for by Medicaid patients. Medi-\ncare fiscal pressure was measured as the financial gain or loss under\nMedicare relative to a hospital's total expenses. The Herfindahl In-\ndex was used to measure hospital competition and was constructed\nusing patient origin data available on the 100 percent MEDPAR file\nof Medicare hospital discharges obtained from the Health Care Fi-\nnancing Administration (HCFA).10 Health maintenance organiza-\ntion (HMO) penetration was calculated for each Metropolitan Sta-\ntistical Area (MSA) as the proportion of the total population\nenrolled in an HMO. This measure was available only for hospitals\nlocated in an MSA. These hospitals are divided into three groups:\nlow-penetration areas with less than 10 percent of the population\nenrolled in HMOs, high-penetration areas with more than 20 per-\ncent HMO enrollment, and the middle group in between.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S - ] u ! ) / A q u s t J 9 9 7\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

After the peak of\n1987, the amount of uncompensated care per uninsured person (in\nreal terms) declined through 1995. The sizable increases in the level\nof uncompensated care during the early 1990s were outpaced by\ngrowing numbers of uninsured persons.11\nWhile uncompensated care per uninsured person appears to have\ndeclined through 1995, the ratio that normalizes changes in uncom-\npensated care costs by changes in total (compensated) hospital\ncosts for the insured population shows a decline only through 1992,\nafter which the ratio is stabilized at about 0.36.

The tertile of hospi-\ntals that serve the greatest share of Medicaid patients accounted for\nwell over half of the uncompensated care in the country.\nThe major role in uncompensated care delivery played by hospi-\ntals with a large Medicaid load has enormous implications for states\nthat are shifting Medicaid recipients into managed care settings.\nFirst, if HMOs serving Medicaid patients squeeze hospital payment\nrates and utilization as anticipated, hospitals that historically have\ndepended on Medicaid revenue to meet their bottom line will be\nmore adversely affected than other hospitals will. Second, if Medic-\naid managed care is successful in mainstreaming recipients (as some\nbelieve could happen with the entry of commercial HMOs into the\nMedicaid market), traditional indigent care providers may see their\npaying patient base evaporate, leaving them with an even greater\nconcentration of uninsured and indigent patients but without the\nrevenue to support their care. Even if the shift in patients is minimal,\nit may be enough to greatly reduce disproportionate-share pay-\nments (which are linked to Medicaid volume, not uncompensated\ncare). These payments have played a critical role in stabilizing the\nfinancial status of high-volume Medicaid hospitals.\nMedicare providers. Medicare fiscal pressure may have played a\nrole in reducing growth in uncompensated care delivery.

HMO penetration was measured only for hospitals\nlocated in MSAs; the sample for the six competition/HMO penetration categories excludes non-MSA hospitals.\nin the least competitive markets accounted for a much lower share\nof hospital business (22 percent) and an even smaller share of un-\ncompensated care (18 percent). On average, uncompensated care\naccounted for 7.4 percent of expenses among hospitals in the most\ncompetitive markets compared with 5.3 percent in the least com-\npetitive markets. Hospitals in the most competitive markets tend to\nbe in large cities, are bigger in size, have a larger Medicaid mix, and\naccount for more of the public and major teaching hospitals (charac-\nteristics associated with higher levels of uncompensated care).\nIt is not necessarily competition per se that will induce reduc-\ntions in uncompensated care. Rather, it is the combination of com-\npetition plus greater price sensitivity introduced by managed care\nthat could lead to pressures to slow the growth of uncompensated\ncare. Within each market category (the most and least competitive\ntertile of hospitals), we look at differences in uncompensated care\nprovision associated with differing levels of managed care penetra-\ntion (Exhibit 3). The sample is restricted to hospitals in MSAs\n(where there are more reliable measures of HMO penetration).\nA clear pattern emerges when comparing HMO penetration\nwithin the same type of hospital market structure: The greater the\ndegree of HMO penetration, the lower the provision of uncompen-\nsated care relative to the hospital's size, with the effect being\nstronger in the most competitive markets. This can be seen by exam-\nining the ratio of \"Share of UC\" to \"Share of expense,\" which shows\nthat all hospitals in the most competitive markets within MSAs\nprovide a greater than proportionate share of uncompensated care,\nbut that this contribution is greater among hospitals in areas with\nlittle HMO penetration (a ratio of 1.58 versus 1.15 in areas with the\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S - Volume 16, Number 4\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

On average, uncompensated care takes up\na smaller portion of hospital expenses in areas with more extensive\nHMO penetration (7.6 percent versus 10.5 percent in more competi-\ntive markets and 4.6 percent versus 5.8 percent in less competitive\nmarkets). While a multivariate model should be used to control for\nthe various determinants of uncompensated care delivery, these bi-\nvariate results suggest that managed care may indeed lead to pres-\nsures to reduce uncompensated care.\nConclusions\nOur examination of uncompensated care trends shows that the\nand then declined slightly in 1995. The increase in uncompensated\ncare levels after 1988 appears not to have kept pace with growth in\nhospital expenses or the uninsured population. However, the de-\nclines in the relative level of effort were fairly modest and do not\nsuggest a large-scale reduction of effort.\nAlthough changes in uncompensated care have been modest in\nthe aggregate, there have been significant distributional shifts\namong hospitals in two categories: (1) Hospitals serving a large\nshare of the Medicaid population experienced increases in uncom-\npensated care relative to hospitals with a low Medicaid load; and (2)\nhospitals that experienced financial losses in their Medicare busi-\nness reduced uncompensated care levels relative to hospitals with\nfinancial gains under Medicare.\nAlthough it is descriptive, this DataWatch provides suggestive\nevidence that higher levels of managed care penetration are associ-\nated with lower levels of uncompensated care delivery, controlling\nfor hospital market structure. Whether this relationship is attribut-\nable to hospitals' cutting back on uncompensated care once man-\naged care firms enter a market or to managed care firms' choosing to\nenter those types of markets where uncompensated care is lower to\nbegin with awaits further multivariate analyses that model these\ndynamics over time. Even in the latter case, however, continued\nexpansion of managed care throughout the country, particularly in\nlight of the decline in insurance coverage, may undermine the ability\nof hospitals to continue to provide uncompensated care.\nThis DataWatch is based on apresentation at the conference, \"What Is Happening to\nthe Safety Net?,\" sponsored by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RW]F) in\ncollaboration with Health Affairs and the Alpha Center, 9-10 January 1997, in\nWashington, D.C.

Because uncompensated care includes both bad debt and charity care, some\nportion of uncompensated care is generated by insured patients who are\nunable or unwilling to pay the share of costs for which they are responsible.\nInconsistencies across hospitals in the definition and allocation of charity care\nversus bad debt make it difficult to precisely identify the amount of charity\ncare provided.\n3. These rate-setting programs, which were implemented in the 1980s, have been\ndiscontinued (except in Maryland).\n4. The Medicare and Medicaid DSH programs differ in terms of the magnitude of\ntotal payments, the criteria for identifying DSH hospitals, and the formula for\nallocating payments to qualifying hospitals. DSH funding is much greater\nunder Medicaid than it is under Medicare ($19 billion versus $3.7 billion,\n5.

More recently, the pressure from Medicare has eased partly because of pay-\nment increases and partly because of stronger efforts by many hospitals to\ncontrol costs.\n7. The annual survey reports tax appropriations, but in many cases these funds\nsupport activities other than indigent care. Since there is no direct measure of\nsubsidies earmarked for indigent care, the measure of uncompensated care\nused in this study does not net out indigent care subsidies.\n8. The amount of uncompensated care per uninsured person is an admittedly\ncrude measure, since insured patients as well as uninsured patients generate\nuncompensated care. Few studies document the relative proportion of un-\ncompensated care attributed to insured persons.\n9.
