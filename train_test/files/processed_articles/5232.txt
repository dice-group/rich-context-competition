    "abstract": "Abstract\nAlthough many schools are equipped with the latest instructional technologies, multiple studies have indicated that more\nthan half of the teachers equipped with computers only use them for administrative functions, and only half of their students\nreport using technology more than once a week. Many faculty members lack the technological proficiency needed to take\nadvantage of these new technologies, making them unable to bring these technologies into the classroom and leading to\nmany standing unused in the classroom.This study analyzes teachers' perceptions of technology use in the classroom by\nsurveying those who participated in the TeachUp! technology empowerment program created and developed by Digital\nOpportunity Trust USA, Inc. (DOT USA).The results show that teachers who were part of DOT USA's TeachUp! program\nperceived a significant increase in the areas of student engagement, student excitement, student acceleration of learning, and\nstudent proficiency with computer technology.The analysis has indicated that faculty members need not only to learn how\nto use technology at a basic level but also to learn how to integrate that technology into their curricula. In addition, newer\nteachers from digital native generations must be taught how their acquired skills can be used to integrate technology into the\nclassroom curriculum to provide complex cognitive engagement for their students. It is essential that the role of the teacher\nas a professional in the classroom not be discounted when evaluating classroom curriculum development and strategy,\nincluding those that would integrate various technologies.\n",

Today its usage extends well beyond graphing calcu-\nlators, interactive whiteboards, I-clickers, laptop computers,\nand iPods. Prensky (2001) first coined the term \"digital\nnatives\" to represent those younger generations that grew up\nwith technology integrated into their everyday lifestyles.\nSince then, research has focused solely on digital natives as\nhave noted that digital natives use technology differently\nfrom their parents and teachers, especially those who are\nmembers of nondigital native generations (Powell, 2007;\nPrensky, 2006). An abundance of research focuses on these\ndigital natives in the K-12 classroom, but many digital\nnatives have actually entered the workforce (Rainie, 2006)\nand have chosen the field of education--often as teachers or\npreservice teachers (Dutt-Doner, Allen, & Corcoran, 2005).\nLei (2009) noted that the current research trend is to focus on\ndigital natives as professionals pursuing careers in educa-\ntion. This trend includes research aimed at understanding\nthese teachers in the classrooms, their perceptions, their use\nof technology, and their perceptions of the benefits for stu-\ndents who use technology in the classroom. This then takes\nan additional step as teachers must find ways to teach using\ntechnology, which provide complex cognitive engagement\nthat in turn allows students to invest themselves in the learn-\ning process (Warschauer, 2007). Central to these ideas is the\nconcept of the teacher as a professional in the classroom\ncomparable with a lawyer in a law firm or a doctor in a hos-\npital. From there, one is able to value the perceptions and\njudgments of the teacher on technology use in the classroom\nand learning.\nTeachers as Professionals\nIn the modern United States, the role of the teacher as a pro-\nfessional has become ambiguous. Professionalism is often\ndiscussed in terms of standards and performance (Rodd,\ntions of professionalism as valuing male attributes, includ-\ning rationalism, competitiveness, and individualism. These\nsame attributes from the consumer-centric mentality were\n1Texas A&M University, Kingsville, USA\n2Kingsville Independent School District,TX, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLori Kupczynski,Texas A&M University, 700 University Blvd. MSC 223,\nTeacher's Perceptions ofTechnology\nUse in the Schools\nMarie-Anne Mundy1, Lori Kupczynski1, and Rick Kee2\n Keywords\ndigital natives, instructional technologies, curriculum, technological proficiency, professional development\n2 SAGE Open\nalso found to be similar to the perceptions of parents about\nteachers. Thus, this marginalization reduced teachers to the\nrole of a service provider, rather than a professional.\nIn the United States, notions of professionalism are cen-\ntered on accountability, whereas a popular Italian concept--\nthe Reggio Emilia context--of professionalism in early\nchildhood education describes professionalism in terms of\ntrust. In the Reggio Emilia approach, the guiding principal\nis that programs should reflect the beliefs and values of the\ncommunity. Therefore, various programs would differ based\non the diverse communities practicing Reggio Emilia. In\nthis approach, the understanding of the teacher as a profes-\nsional, by the community and parents, allows the teacher to\nfreely make autonomous and trustworthy decisions, as well\nas continue his or her professional development, which\nstems from observation, conversation, debate, and reflec-\ntion on his or her personal work. Terzi and Cantarelli (2001)\nstressed that this reflection enriches the educator's knowl-\nedge and contributes to trustworthiness.\nThe professionalism of a teacher can also be compared\nwith professionalism in other sectors such as law or medicine.\nAs with professionals in these sectors, teachers work in an\nenvironment where their obligations are understood by tradi-\ntion rather than specifically outlined in a job description\nmodels of evaluation used in other sectors should be applied\nto teaching because teaching is \"best conceived of as a profes-\nsion, whatever the proportion of teachers that rise to or reject\nthat conception\" (p. 3). Griffin (1990) offered four proposi-\ntions to make teaching as attractive as other careers. These\ninclude perceiving teaching as intellectual, understanding\nthat teachers are central to decision making in schools, under-\nstanding that the work of the teacher is determined and\nrewarded based on school needs and expectations as well as\nindividual professional choices, and, finally, understanding\nthat teachers engage in professional development to ensure\nthat they maintain their understanding of their profession.\nFinland has become a country with one of the world's\nhighest performing educational systems due to education\nreforms seen in the last decade (Hargreaves & Shirley,\nclear reflection of the overall "
