Thus, the pre-\nsent study investigated the association\nbetween meteorological factors and lower\nrates of respiratory tract infection in chil-\ndren admitted to Shenmu Hospital and\nShenmu Second Hospital (Shenmu\nCounty, Yulin City, Shaanxi Province,\nPatients and methods\nStudy population and data collection\nThis retrospective observational study\nincluded medical records from children aged\n16 years, admitted to Shenmu Hospital and\nShenmu Second Hospital, and discharged\nCases with a primary discharge diagnosis of\nlower respiratory tract infection (including\npneumonia, bronchiolitis and bronchitis, in\naccordance with the International Statistical\nClassification of Diseases and Health Related\nother associated comorbidity (e.g. obesity,\nphysical disability, allergic conditions) were\nincluded in the study.11 Respiratory tract\ninfections were diagnosed according to the\ndiagnostic standard of Practical Pediatrics,\nRecords included chest X-radiographs\nobtained according to clinical indication\n(which included all children with a suspected\nlower respiratory tract infection). All chest\nX-radiographs were retrospectively evalu-\nated by an expert radiologist. Sputum cul-\nture data were obtained for cases in which\nsputum had been produced.\nHospitalization records for all children\naged 16 years, including those admitted\nwith respiratory tract infection, were col-\nlected each week of the year over the study\nperiod, to represent all seasons and extremes\nof meteorological factors. During the cor-\nresponding time-period, data from daily\nmonitoring of atmospheric meteorological\nfactors were collected from Shenmu County\nMeteorological Bureau, Shenmu County,\nYulin City, China, including daily mean air\ntemperature, atmospheric pressure, rainfall,\nhours of sunlight, wind speed and relative\nhumidity. All of the meteorological moni-\ntoring sites for Shenmu County provided\nhourly measurement data of meteorological\nfactors. Methodology described by the\nAmerican Heart Association was used for\ndata selection and analyses, according to\nwhich measurements were taken at monitor-\nstation kit (including thermometer, barom-\neter, rain gauge, anemometer and hygrom-\neter [Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne,\nMA, USA]).13 All sensors were integrated\nwhich controlled the sensors and stored the\nraw data using HOBOware\u00d5 Pro software\n(Onset Computer Corporation). Hourly mean\nvalues were used to calculate the 24-h mean of\neach factor, from which weekly 24-h mean\nvalues were computed. Weekly 24-h mean\nvalue was subtracted from each 24-h value for\nthat week; each subtracted value was then\nsquared and the sum of the squares calculated\nfor each given week. The sum was divided by 6\n(7 days of week minus 1) to obtain the\nvariance and the SD was calculated.\nThe Shenmu Hospital Institutional\nReview Board waived the requirement for\nethical approval, as the study did not dir-\nectly involve patients or clinical samples.\nA written request from the authors to collect\ninpatient data was approved by the head of\nthe Paediatrics Department and the execu-\ntive director of Shenmu Hospital.\nStatistical analyses\nData are presented as n patient incidence\nand mean \u00c6 SD for lower respiratory tract\ninfection hospitalization rate and meteoro-\nlogical factors (air temperature, atmospheric\npressure, rainfall, hours of sunlight, wind\nspeed and relative humidity), respectively.\nPearson's correlation coefficient was used to\nassess the correlation between meteoro-\nlogical factors and lower respiratory tract\ninfection hospitalization rate. Stepwise\nmultiple linear regression was performed,\nwith main meteorological factors as inde-\npendent variables, to investigate the regres-\nsion relationship between the independent\nvariables and respiratory tract infection\nhospitalization rate. Shapiro\u00adWilk test was\napplied to assess distribution of the popula-\ntion. SAS\u00d5 software version 9.3 (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for\nthe statistical analyses.

Cold\nand low humidity favour spots of low acidity\nin skinfolds, resulting in the growth of\nmicro-organisms and their penetration into\nthe skin; (iii) low humidity causes removal of\nwater vapour from the body cells, which in\nturn leads to microfissures in the nasal\nmucosa during cold weather and in centrally\nheated rooms; (iv) cold causes constriction\nof peripheral blood vessels and reduces\nblood flow, resulting in drying and cracking\nof nasal mucosa; it also depresses ciliary\nmovements in the respiratory tract, thus\nincreasing vulnerability to infections.4\nFactors that affect general resistance of\nthe body through influence on spread of\ninfections include: (i) the impact of weather\nand climate on social habits, such as crowd-\ning in rooms, shutting windows and doors\n(i.e. reducing ventilation), and changing\nclothing and diet;3 (ii) the influence on the\nsurvival of micro-organisms and viruses; (iii)\nthe effect of meteorological factors on\nspread of infectious agents through the\natmosphere. For example, Gram-positive\nbacteria and influenza viruses have\nbeen shown to die more quickly with high\nhumidity and air movement.3,21 Studies of\nFigure 2. Scatter plot showing standardized predicted values versus standardized residuals for lower\nrespiratory tract infection-related hospital admissions in children aged 16 years (from Shenmu County, Yulin\nCity, Shaanxi Province, China).\nschool-age children mostly confined within\nclassrooms have found that the degree of air\ncirculation in the classrooms greatly affects\nthe incidence of respiratory disease.22 Thus,\nlow humidity and reduced air movement in\nwinter appears to favour the development of\ninfectious respiratory diseases.\nStudies have suggested that air tempera-\nture has the most notable influence on the\nincidence of respiratory tract infections;\nhowever, different views exist regarding\nthis relationship. Some scholars believe\nthat air temperature and respiratory tract\ninfection rate are negatively correlated,23\nwhile some scientists report a positive cor-\nrelation between them.24\nA study into the correlation between\nclimatic factors, including humidity, and\nclinical illnesses found that upper and\nlower respiratory tract infections were nega-\ntively correlated with relative humidity.25\nThese data concur with the present study,\nwhich found an increased incidence of lower\nrespiratory tract infection with decreased\nhumidity, resulting in increased numbers of\npaediatric hospital admissions.\nIncidence of acute respiratory tract infec-\ntion is reported to be correlated with\ncrowding; exposure to crowded conditions\nhas led to an increased risk of acute respira-\ntory tract infection.26 During winter in\nShenmu the temperature falls to around\nare confined indoors either at home or in\nclassrooms and outdoor activities are mark-\nedly reduced. This may make it easier for\ninfection to spread, leading to high numbers\nof hospital admissions during winter.\nThe spread of viruses is thought to be\ndirectly related to human mobility through\ntransportation.27 The fact that human travel\nis a cause of infection spread confirms that\ninfected humans are a source of pathogens.\nThus, human confinement to a specific area\ndue to travel-hindering weather conditions\ncan lead to increased disease incidence in\nthat area. The confinement indoors of the\nchildren of Shenmu during winter may thus\nbe the cause of increased incidence of lower\nrespiratory tract infections in the county.\nThe influenza virus has been shown to\ntransmit through the air most readily in\ncold, dry conditions, whereas higher tem-\nperatures of $30C tend to block aerosol\ntransmission.21 Viruses with lipid envelopes\ngenerally tend to survive longer at lower\nlipid-enveloped respiratory viruses, includ-\ning influenza. Minimal survival for both\nlipid-enveloped and nonlipid-enveloped\nviruses occurs at an intermediate relative\nalso demonstrated a high incidence of the\nlipid-enveloped respiratory syncytial virus\nfollowed by influenza A virus.\nGram-positive cocci are most prevalent in\nindoor and outdoor air, followed by\nGram-positive rods (e.g. Bacillus and\nActinomycetes species), Gram-negative\nrods and, lastly, Gram-negative cocci. For\nsome airborne Gram-positive bacteria\n(Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus haemo-\nlyticus, Bacillus subtilis and S. pneumoniae\n[type 1]), death rates are lower at lower\nrelative humidity levels.28 In the present\nstudy, the primary causative bacteria for\nlower respiratory tract infection in children\naged 16 years were S. pneumoniae and H.\ninfluenzae type B.\nStudies on aerosolized Mycoplasma spe-\ncies have shown that survival is optimal at\nhumidity, and worst between these two\nextremes; this reveals that mycoplasma sur-\nvives well at lower humidity.28 There is a\nstrong association between ventilation and\ncontrol of airflow direction in buildings and\ntransmission and spread of infectious dis-\neases. Reduced ventilation and crowding\nmay contribute to the observed excess of\nlower respiratory tract infections among\nyoung children.29 The present study also\nsuggests an association between reduced\nventilation and crowding and lower\n38 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1)\nrespiratory tract infections among young\nchildren, as a large number of children\naffected were of kindergarten age (1\u00ad4\nIn the present study, mean values of lower\nrespiratory tract infection-related hospital\nadmissions and meteorological factors were\ncalculated per week, annually. Following\nPearson's correlation coefficient analysis of\nmeteorological factors, the multivariate\nlinear regression model was fitted. The multi-\nvariate linear regression model, multicolli-\nnearity of the independent variables, residual\nnormality and homogeneity of variance\nobserved in the present study support the\nreliability of the results.\nThe present study found that the rate of\nlower respiratory tract infection-related hos-\npital admissions was significantly correlated\nwith air temperature, atmospheric pressure,\nrainfall and relative humidity, but was not\nstatistically correlated with sunlight inten-\nsity and wind speed. In addition, the rate of\nlower respiratory tract infection-related hos-\npital admissions was found to decrease with\ngradual increase in temperature and relative\nhumidity. This information is essential from\na public health perspective when planning\nappropriate cold risk-management strate-\ngies. Information regarding the trends and\nseasonality of respiratory viral infections in\nthe community is a first step in enabling\nhealthcare providers to implement strategies\nto prevent and minimize infection, and to\napply early therapeutic options to high-risk\npatients. A limitation of this study is that the\nsample size and power were not pre-\ndetermined.\nIn conclusion, the results obtained in the\npresent study show that seasonal variations\nin meteorological factors are correlated with\nrates of respiratory tract infection-related\nhospital admissions in children. To the best\nof the authors' knowledge, this is the first\npublished report showing seasonal patterns\nof respiratory infections in Shenmu County.\nThe results demonstrate the importance of\nepidemiological surveillance of respiratory\ninfections in all regions of China, and sug-\ngest that future studies are necessary to\ncorrelate clinical aspects with climatic\nvariations.\n"
