    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: The peak shift model predicts that the age-profile of a pathogen's prevalence depends upon its transmission\nrate, peaking earlier in populations with higher transmission and declining as partial immunity is acquired. Helminth\ninfections are associated with increased immunoglobulin E (IgE), which may convey partial immunity and influence the peak\nshift. Although studies have noted peak shifts in helminths, corresponding peak shifts in total IgE have not been\ninvestigated, nor has the age-patterning been carefully examined across populations. We test for differences in the age-\npatterning of IgE between two South American forager-horticulturalist populations and the United States: the Tsimane of\nBolivia (n = 832), the Shuar of Ecuador (n = 289), and the U.S. NHANES (n = 8,336). We then examine the relationship between\ntotal IgE and helminth prevalences in the Tsimane.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: Total IgE levels were assessed in serum and dried blood spots and age-patterns\nexamined with non-linear regression models. Tsimane had the highest IgE (geometric mean = 8,182 IU/ml), followed by\nShuar (1,252 IU/ml), and NHANES (52 IU/ml). Consistent with predictions, higher population IgE was associated with steeper\nincreases at early ages and earlier peaks: Tsimane IgE peaked at 7 years, Shuar at 10 years, and NHANES at 17 years. For\nTsimane, the age-pattern was compared with fecal helminth prevalences. Overall, 57% had detectable eggs or larva, with\nhookworm (45.4%) and Ascaris lumbricoides (19.9%) the most prevalent. The peak in total IgE occurred around the peak in A.\nlumbricoides, which was associated with higher IgE in children ,10, but with lower IgE in adolescents.\nConclusions: The age-patterning suggests a peak shift in total IgE similar to that seen in helminth infections, particularly A.\nlumbricoides. This age-patterning may have implications for understanding the effects of helminths on other health\noutcomes, such as allergy, growth, and response to childhood vaccination.\nCitation: Blackwell AD, Gurven MD, Sugiyama LS, Madimenos FC, Liebert MA, et al.

Blackwell1,2,3*, Michael D. Gurven1, Lawrence S. Sugiyama2,3, Felicia C. Madimenos2,3,\nMelissa A. Liebert2,3, Melanie A. Martin1, Hillard S. Kaplan4, J.

Helminth infections show\ncharacteristic age-patterning, peaking around puberty and then\ndeclining during adulthood [3\u00ad5]. However, this pattern varies\nwith infection prevalence and intensity, tending to both peak and\ndecline earlier in populations with higher rates of transmission.\nThis ``peak shift'' is thought to result from the interaction between\nthe rate at which new individuals are infected and the rate at\nwhich partial immunity is acquired [1,2]. According to this model,\nwhen transmission is high infection occurs more quickly, leading to\na higher prevalence at a younger age. However, earlier infection\nalso leads to an earlier acquisition of immunity, leading to a\ndecline in prevalence following the peak.\nAlthough studies have found age-patterns in helminth preva-\nlences consistent with this hypothesis, few studies have examined\nwhether the age-patterning of immune responses follows similar\npatterns. Those studies that have examined the age-patterning of\nimmune responses have generally focused on parasite specific\nimmunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE) [6\u00ad11]. These have\nshown age-patterns that resemble the age-specific prevalences of\nparasites. However, in addition to specific responses, helminth\ninfections are associated with a general shift in the host immune\nsystem towards a TH\n2-biased phenotype, characterized in\nparticular by increased production of total IgE. Although specific\nresponses are thought to participate in protection against infection\nand thus the generation of peak-shift patterns, an examination of\ntotal IgE levels is also critical for understanding the effects of\nhelminths on health and immune function. Due to stimulation of\nTH\n2 responses, total IgE is likely to represent the total burden of\nmultiple helminth species infection better than species specific\nimmunoglobulins. Like specific IgE, total IgE levels are elevated in\ninfected individuals and fall with treatment [12,13], and have been\nshown to correlate with specific IgE for Ascaris lumbricoides and T.\ntrichiura [14]. However, total IgE levels in heavily parasitized\nindividuals remain elevated compared to individuals in industri-\nalized countries for substantial periods of time [15], suggesting\npersistent changes in host immune function.\nMounting an immune response is energetically costly, necessi-\ntating reductions in competing life history demands, including\ngrowth, reproduction, and survival [16\u00ad17]. Higher total IgE\nlevels are associated with poorer growth and shorter adult stature,\nsuggesting a trade-off between growth and investment into\nimmune response [18]. Moreover, the shifting of immune function\ntowards a TH\n2 phenotype may reduce TH\n1 responses, decreasing\nthe effectiveness of vaccines or increasing susceptibility to viruses\nThese effects may depend, in part, on the timing of exposure, as\nexposure to helminths during critical periods may bias the\ndevelopment of immune function or a child's growth trajectory.\nHelminths infect more than one seventh of the world's population,\nand given the peak-shift pattern, a disproportionate number of\nthose infected are schoolchildren [22]. As a consequence, age-\npatterns in helminth infection and immune response are likely to\nhave significant consequences on growth and development.\nAlthough several studies have reported that IgE increases\nquickly in the first 5\u00ad10 years of life and then levels off [23,24], few\nstudies have carefully examined the age-patterning of total IgE\nand we know of no published studies that have compared age-\npatterning in IgE across multiple populations. As a marker of\nhelminth infection and TH\n2-biasing of T-cell responses, an\nunderstanding of the age-patterning of total IgE is important for\nunderstanding the broader consequences of helminth infections on\nlife history parameters. The current study describes in detail the\nage-patterning of IgE levels in three populations. These include\ndata from the United States collected by the National Health and\nfrom two populations of South American forager-horticulturalists:\nthe Tsimane of Boliva and the Shuar of Ecuador. First, we test for\npredicted associations between population mean IgE level and the\nage-pattern of IgE. Second, using Tsimane data we examine the\nrelationship between age-patterning in IgE and age-patterning in\nhelminth infections.\nMethods\nStudy Populations\nShuar. Shuar are Amerindians from the Amazonas region of\nEcuador [25,26]. Shuar live across a wide range of circumstances,\nbut a large portion of the population continues traditional\nsubsistence based on horticulture, hunting, and fishing.\nApproximately 40% of Shuar children are stunted, a higher\nprevalence than is found in other indigenous and non-indigenous\nchildren living in the same area [27]. Although we know of no\nstudies examining helminth infections in the Shuar, recent studies\nreport infection rates of around 50% in other Amazonian\nEcuadorian populations, with Ascaris the most prevalent parasite\n[28,29]. Shuar data were collected as part of the Shuar Life\nHistory Project (www.bonesandbehavior.org/shuar) in a village\nthat has been previously described [18].\nTsimane. Tsimane are forager-horticulturalists that live\nalong the Maniqui River in lowland Bolivia. Tsimane subsist\nprimarily on cultivation of plantains, rice, manioc, and corn, as well\nas hunting, fishing, and gathering. Tsimane show high levels of\ninflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein [30\u00ad32].\nHelminth infections are highly prevalent, with hookworm (Necator\namericanus or Ancylostoma duodenale) being the predominant parasite,\n50% of children are stunted [35,36]. The data for this study were\ncollected as part of the Tsimane Health and Life History Project\n(http://www.unm.edu/,tsimane/), in sixteen villages representing\na range of environmental and economic situations (interior forest,\nriverine, acculturated, non-acculturated).\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES). NHANES is a large-scale, national survey of\nhealth, nutrition, and social factors conducted by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics and Center for Disease Control. This\nThe sample includes 8,336 individuals, 88% percent U.S. citizens,\n26% African-American, and 11% other ethnicities.\nEthics Statement\nFor Shuar, permission to conduct the study was first obtained\nfrom the Federaci\n\u00b4on Interprovincial de Centros Shuar (FICSH),\nthe elected representational organization for Shuar affairs. Second,\npermission was obtained from elected village leaders. Third, a\nvillage meeting was held in which a village-level consent form was\nread aloud, the study explained, questions answered, and a\ncommunity decision reached about whether to allow the study.\nIndividuals were informed that they could choose not to\nparticipate, participate only in individual portions of the study,\nor participate in the full study. At the time of data collection,\nindividual oral consent was obtained, with individuals able to opt-\nin or out of individual components of the study (e.g., to provide\nblood spots or not). For subjects under age fifteen (the local age of\nconsent) both parental consent and child assent were obtained.\nOral consent was used for two reasons: 1) many Shuar are non or\nAuthor Summary\nInfection with parasitic worms, known as helminths, alters\nthe immune system, causing individuals to produce high\nlevels of a type of antibody known as immunoglobulin E\n(IgE). IgE is typically very low in western populations, but is\nmany times higher where helminth infections are com-\nmon, particularly indigenous populations in South Amer-\nica. Helminths infect more than one seventh of the world's\npopulation. Since helminths tend to infect people at\nyounger ages in areas where they are more common, a\ndisproportionate number of those affected are schoolchil-\ndren. In this paper we examine IgE levels in two\nindigenous South American groups in comparison to\nlevels in the United States. In these groups we find that IgE\nlevels are not only higher, but that they also reach their\nhighest levels at earlier ages in more infected populations.\nThis finding is important since effects on immune function,\nincluding IgE production, may have additional conse-\nquences if they occur at young ages, changing the\ndevelopment of allergy and asthma, growth, and response\nto vaccines.\nEvidence for a Peak Shift in IgE\nsemi-literate or have only a few years of schooling, and 2) many\nShuar are suspicious or uncomfortable with signing documents\ndue to a history of territorial land disputes and wariness about\nsigned documents leading to ownership conflicts. An independent\nbilingual Shuar village leader, nurse, FISCH official or assistant\nwas present to translate as needed during group and individual\nconsent and study procedures. The study and consent procedures\nwere approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the\nUniversity of Oregon.\nFor Tsimane, informed consent was obtained at three levels: 1)\nfrom the Gran Consejo Tsimane, the local Tsimane government\norganization that represents Tsimane interests and oversees all\nprojects, 2) community officials and participants in village\nmeetings, and 3) individual consent during medical visits and\nbefore each procedure. After explanation of a formal protocol by\nbilingual Tsimane assistants, consent forms were signed for literate\nparticipants, and verbal approval with fingerprint signature given\nfor non-literate participants. Tsimane consent procedures were\napproved by the IRBs at the University of New Mexico, University\nof California, Santa Barbara and the University of Southern\nCalifornia.\nBlood Collection and Analysis\nShuar. Shuar samples were collected following standard\nprocedures to collect dried blood spots [37]. IgE levels were\ndetermined by ELISA at the University of Oregon, following a\ncommercially available protocol (Bethyl Labs, Inc.: #E80-108 and\n#E101) adapted for use with blood spots [38]. Blood spot\ncollection and IgE analyses have been previously described [18].\nTsimane. Tsimane blood samples were collected by\nvenipuncture during annual medical exams conducted by\nBolivian physicians. Serum was frozen in liquid nitrogen for\ntransport to New Mexico. Two rounds of samples were collected.\nby TriCore Laboratories (Albuquerque, NM) for total IgE\nand analyzed in the laboratory of JJS at the University of Oregon\nusing the same commercial ELISA kit used for Shuar samples\nrepeated measures for individuals included in the first batch of\nsamples. These samples were excluded so as not to confound\nlongitudinal and cross-sectional data. After excluding these cases,\nthe first and second samples did not differ in geometric mean IgE\nNHANES. NHANES samples were collected by venipucture\nby trained phlebotomists. Determination of total IgE was done using\nthe ImmunoCAP 1000 system (Pharmacia Diagnostics) by the\nDepartment of Pathology Immunology Laboratory at Elmhurst\nMemorial Hospital, Elmhurst, IL. Details can be found at http://\nwww.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_05_06/al_ige_d_met_\nspecific_ige_total_ige.pdf.\nComparability of Blood Samples. A handful of studies\nhave compared IgE in dried blood spots to IgE measured in serum\nand found results to be virtually identical [39,40]. Additionally, the\nELISA procedure used to determine blood spot IgE in this study\nhas been validated against controls with known IgE levels [38]. To\nverify the comparability of IgE obtained from dried blood spots\nwith that obtained from serum, six matched blood spot and serum\nsamples were analyzed using both methods. The values obtained\nfrom dried blood spots were highly correlated with the values from\nUsing linear regression, the following conversion factor was\nobtained to convert dried blood spot values into serum values\nprior to other analyses: IgEserum\nFecal Analysis\nTsimane fecal samples were analyzed using two methods. From\nhelminth eggs and larvae by direct identification on wet mounts.\nAs described in greater detail elsewhere [33], duplicate mounts\nwere prepared with 0.9% saline solution and iodine solution,\nrespectively, and examined at 100x and 400x for helminth eggs\n(hookworm, A. lumbricoides, and T. trichiuris), and larvae (S.\nstercoralis). Beginning in 2007, fecal samples were also preserved\nin 10% formalin solution following direct identification, and later\nquantitatively analyzed using a modified Percoll (Amersham\nPharmacia) technique [41].\nOf the two methods, the Percoll technique is more sensitive,\nproducing slightly higher detection rates than direct identification\n(59.4% vs. 51.9% infected). These differences may be due to the\ngreater efficiency of the Percoll technique in detecting eggs in\nfibrous stools and at low-intensities [41]. However, for the present\nstudy the differences between the two methods were not\nqualitatively great enough to justify using only data produced by\none method or the other. We therefore aggregated data from the\ntwo methods, coding individuals as either infected or not infected if\nhelminths were detected by either method. In total 1,495\nindividuals had Percoll results, with the remaining 3,610 having\nonly direct results.\nAge Estimation\nBirth dates accurate to the month were available from health\nclinic and school records for most Shuar children. For Shuar\nadults, birth dates on government identification were cross-\nchecked with extensive genealogical information collected from\nmultiple informants. Tsimane genealogies were collected during\ndemographic interviews done on individuals over age 18\n(n = 1,098). Tsimane ages were estimated based on written\nrecords, such as those kept by Catholic missionaries, demographic\ninterviews with independent cross-checking of genealogies and\nreproductive histories with multiple informants, and the use of\nphotographs of people with known ages [42].\nFigure 1. Distribution and geometric mean value of IgE\nantibody levels in three populations. Density plots were\ngenerated with a Gaussian smooth with bandwidth 0.5.\nEvidence for a Peak Shift in IgE\nData Analysis\nPrior to data analysis, IgE values were converted into\ninternational units (1 IU = 2.4 ng/ml). IgE is log-normally distrib-\nuted in all three populations (Figure 1), so values were natural log\ntransformed (lnIgE) before all analyses. For t-tests, reported means\nare geometric means calculated by taking the exponential of the\nmean log values used in the t-test. Descriptive statistics and t-tests\nwere done in PASW Statistics 18.0 (formerly SPSS Statistics, SPSS\nInc.). All other analyses were done in R 2.10.1 (www.r-project.org).\nGeneralized additive models (GAM; [43,44]) were used to\nexamine the non-parametric age pattern of IgE levels for each\npopulation. Models were fit with the gam procedure in package\nmgcv using thin plate regression splines [45,46]. Since the cases in\neach population were not evenly distributed by age, initial basis\nknots were specified for each population based on even ten-\npercentiles of the age distribution, allowing knots to be spaced with\nan equal number of cases between them (Figure 2). Apart from the\nbasis knots, smoothing parameters were generated automatically\naccording to gam defaults [45]. GAM models included an\nintercept, a sex factor, a spline for age, and a spline for age-by-\nsex interaction.\nIn initial models, similar IgE levels at birth were predicted\namong Shuar and NHANES, with the Shuar model predicting IgE\nof 7 IU/ml for females and 9 IU/ml for males, and the NHANES\nmodel predicting 15 IU/ml for females and 21 IU/ml for males.\nHowever, due to the relatively low number of Tsimane under age\nfive, initial Tsimane models were essentially straight lines, with\npeak IgE predicted at birth. A number of studies have found\nFigure 2. Models for IgE by age in Tsimane, Shuar, and NHANES. A) Generalized additive models for Tsimane (top, blue), Shuar (middle,\ngreen), and NHANES (bottom, yellow). Points show the mean lnIgE value for males (triangles) and females (circles) between knots specified in the\ninitial model basis (vertical lines), while lines indicate the thin plate regression spline for each sex. For all three populations males have the higher fit\nline. Numbers indicate the estimated ages at which the initial peak in IgE occurs. Shading indicates local 95% confidence intervals for the spline, with\ndark areas indicating overlap between male and female confidence intervals and light areas indicating no overlap. B) Ordinal step models and non-\nlinear regression models. Ordinal model parameters were entered in stepwise fashion according to AIC minimization, resulting in the final models.\nNumbers indicate a significant transition at greater than the age given, symbols the significance of the parameter in the model: t p#0.10, * p#0.05,\n** p#0.01, *** p#0.001. Dashed lines indicate the model fits for non-linear models, including the population specific models in Table 3 (red), and the\ninteraction models in Table 4 (Model 1 in green, Model 2 in brown, and Model 3 in blue). For simplicity only the models for females are shown.\nEvidence for a Peak Shift in IgE\neven in infants of mothers with helminth infections and high IgE\n[53,54]. Given the convergence of the other two models and these\nprevious findings, we used dummy cases with age zero and IgE\nequal to 15 IU/ml to anchor Tsimane models to a similar\nintercept at birth. Dummy cases were included in GAM models\nbut not in any other statistic.\nGAM models with a binomial logit-link function were also used\nto estimate odds-ratios for Tsimane helminth infection by age.\nAssociations between helminth infection and IgE levels were\nestimated in linear models controlling for infection with other\nhelminths, sex, and age.\nIn addition to GAM, two other methods were used to verify age\nshapes and compare populations. In the first, a stepwise linear\nregression was used to identify critical age-related changes in lnIgE\nfor each population. Dummy variables were coded for each\nunique age indicating whether a case was greater than the given\nage (e.g., [55]). Starting from a model with only an intercept and\nsex term, stepAIC (package MASS) was used to enter and remove\nage variables to minimize model AIC [56].\nFor the second test we constructed non-linear models composed\nof linear segments linked together, with model terms representing\nthe point at which the linear segments are stitched together. In this\nmodel, model terms directly represent critical ages, such as the age\nat which the model peaks, so differences in critical ages between\npopulations can be tested using population interaction terms. The\nbasic model is:\nln IgE\nzbS\nSexz\nX\nbi\n\u00f0 \u00de\n\"\n\u00f0 \u00de\n!\nz\nai\n\u00f0 \u00de\n#!\nze\nare the ages at which the slope changes and\nequals zero, b1\nare the slopes for the segments, and\nadditional terms b0\nand bs\nrepresent the intercept at age zero and\nsex effect, respectively. Three logistic functions serve to ``turn-on'',\n``turn-off'', and maintain the value reached at each age transition.\nThe models were fit such that a1\nis the initial age where rapid\nincreases in IgE level out, a2\nis the age at which IgE peaks for the\npopulation, and a3\nis the age at which IgE reaches mean adult\nlevels. Models were solved using nls (package stats) using the nl2sol\nalgorithm. Initial values specified based on GAM regressions and\nonly individuals under age 50 were used for modeling.\nResults\nAge-Pattern of IgE\nOf the three populations, Tsimane had the highest IgE levels\nml), and NHANES (52 IU/ml) (Table 1). IgE distributions were\nskewed but largely normalized by log-transformation (Figure 1).\nAll three groups differed from one another in pair-wise\ncomparisons (all t-test p-values ,.001 after Bonferroni correction).\nIn all three populations, males had higher IgE than females.\nNHANES males had IgE levels 60% higher than females (65.9 vs.\np = .03), and Tsimane males had levels 16% above females\nUpon initial visual examination of the data, age patterns were\nobserved to be non-linear. We therefore used thin plate regression\nsplines in GAM models to examine the age patterning of IgE\n(Figure 2A). Age terms were significant in all models (Tsimane:\ndifferences in level, all three populations had similar age-related\nIgE profiles, characterized by a rapid increase before age five, a\npeak in the juvenile or adolescent period, and a decrease into\nadulthood. However, a number of features differ between\npopulations. Principal among these is the age at which IgE\ninitially peaks. Tsimane IgE peaked at 7.3 years for males and 7.2\nyears for females. Shuar IgE peaked at 10.2 for both sexes.\nNHANES IgE did not peak until age 16.9 for males and 16.4 for\nfemales. Fitting a linear model to the three population points for\neach sex suggested that for males the peak age decreases by 1.98\nTable 1.

Values in parenthesis are plus or minus two standard deviations for log transformed values: em62*s, where m is the mean of ln(IgE)\nand s is the standard deviation of ln(IgE).\nEvidence for a Peak Shift in IgE\nyears for every one unit increase in population mean lnIgE\nWe next used stepwise linear regression with ordinal age\nvariables to identify ages at which important transitions in IgE\nlevel occur and to test the significance of these changes (Figure 2B).\nTsimane transitions included an increase at age three (b = 1.06,\nincreases were present in the model after age one (b = 0.48,\nSince neither of these models directly tests for differences\nbetween populations or allows for the comparison of shape\ndifferences in age curves or peaks, we devised a non-linear\nmodeling procedure in which four linear segments are used to\nmodel the age profile (Figure 2B). These models include three ages\npoints that correspond to the point at which the rapid increases in\nearly life levels off (a1\n), the age at which IgE peaks in the\npopulation (a2\n), and the age at which IgE reaches adult levels after\nthe peak (a3\n). Three slopes (b1\u00ad3\n) describe the change in IgE\nbetween age points (birth \u00ad a1\n). A sex term\naccounts for the difference between males and females (bs\n).\nModels were first fit for the three populations independently\n(Table 2). Model parameters conformed well to predictions from\nGAM models, with peak ages (a2\nfor Tsimane, Shuar, and NHANES respectively. The ages of\ninitial slope change and final adult level also corresponded to peak\nages, with both ages earliest in Tsimane and latest in NHANES.\nMoreover, all model parameters were highly correlated with IgE\nlevels (Figure 3). Age terms, initial slopes from age zero, and sex\ndifferences all correlated with mean log IgE (a1\nfirst peak and the final peak, and the decrease from the final peak to\nadult levels correlated with untransformed population geometric\nmean IgE (b2\nTo compare populations on these terms we first attempted to fit\nmodels with population interaction terms for each parameter.\nHowever, this model, with 21 parameters, was too complex for the\nmodel algorithms and the data available, and failed to fit. Instead\nwe simplified the models based on the relationship between model\nparameters and population mean IgE levels. In the first of these\nmodels we included parameter by population IgE interaction\nterms (Table 3, Model 1). This model verified interactions between\npopulation IgE and all model parameters, with each one unit\nincrease in log IgE associated with a 0.37 year decrease in the age\nof the initial slope change, a 1.70 year decrease in the age of peak\nIgE, and a 4.10 year decrease in the age at which levels dropped to\nadult mean values. The initial rate of increase in IgE was also\nsignificantly related to IgE mean levels indicating bother faster and\nearlier acquisition of high IgE in the Tsimane and secondarily the\nShuar.\nIn the second, third, and forth models we tested population\ndifferences in the ages at which slopes change, using population\nfactor terms rather than interactions with population IgE. In\nModel 2 all three ages were left independent and the Shuar were\nused as a contrast group, since they lie between Tsimane and\nNHANES. In this model NHANES a1\nwere significantly\nTable 2.

Although all three Tsimane ages were early than\nShuar ages, none were significantly so, although all three were\nsignificantly earlier than NHANES ages when the model was run\nwith NHANES as the contrast group (not-shown). Given the\nstrong correlation between all three ages and mean IgE levels, we\nsuspected that multicollinearity between terms might be reducing\nparameter significance. We therefore examined how a1\nmight be included as functions of a single age term. By fitting\nlinear models to the parameters in Table 3 we found that\nin Model 3, removing a1\n. In this model with a single age\nterm to describe the shape, ages in both Tsimane and NHANES\nwere significantly different from Shuar ages, with the overall age\nshape shifted earlier in Tsimane and later in NHANES.\nTsimane Age-Pattern of Helminth Infection\nOverall, 57% of Tsimane participants were infected with at least\none helminth species, with hookworm (45.3%) and A. lumbricoides\n(19.88%) the most prevalent, and S. stercoralis (5.6%) and T. trichiura\n(3.2%) less common (Table 4). In order to compare the IgE age-\npattern with helminth infection patterns, we examined likelihood\nof helminth infection by age in the Tsimane sample using logistic\nGAM models (Figure 4). By sex the only significant difference was\nin A. lumbricoides infection, with women being more likely to be\nof hookworm infection is highest in adults over age 45, but also has\na small peak at age 12.8. In contrast, the odds-ratio for infection\nwith A. lumbricoides peaks sharply at age 8.1 and then declines,\nmirroring the IgE age-pattern more closely. The odds-ratio for\ninfection with S. stercoralis peaks somewhat later, around age 24.9.\nThe odds of T. trichiura infection is essentially flat with respect to\nage, reflecting the low prevalence of T. trichiura. Overall, the odds-\nratio for having any type of helminth infection peaks at age 11.1\nand then declines until age 45, at which point it increases again.\nOdds-ratios closely mirror actual prevalences by age group\n(Table 4). For infected individuals we also examined whether\negg/larva burden showed age-patterning. The only significant\nage-pattern was a slight decline in hookworm burden with age up\nto about age thirteen (not shown). Other egg/larva burdens did\nnot show age-patterning independent of changes in detection\nprevalence.\nAssociation between Helminth Infection and IgE Levels\nWe examined the association between helminth infection and\nIgE levels in our Tsimane sample using regression models to\ncontrol for co-infection status, and with the sample divided by age\ngroup (Figure 5). Hookworm infection was significantly associated\ninfection was significantly associated with higher IgE levels in\nt = 22.45, p = 0.02). Although non-significant, T. trichiura infection\nshowed a pattern similar to A. lumbricoides in those 10 and younger\nwith IgE levels only considering the overall sample (b = 0.32,\nFrom the total sample, 459 individuals had IgE levels and full\nPercoll egg/larva counts. Of these, 195 were positive for\nhookworm, 89 for A. lumbricoides, 18 for S. stercoralis, and 16 for\nT. trichiura. Examining infected individuals only, egg/larva counts\nwere not significantly correlated with lnIgE, either in the overall\nsample or with the sample dived by age.\nDiscussion\nWe report on the age patterning of IgE in three populations:\nU.S. residents, Ecuadorian Shuar, and Bolivian Tsimane. The\nhighest known IgE levels are found among lowland South\nAmerican populations [18]. Tsimane IgE levels fit this pattern\nand resemble the levels of other South American groups with low\nlevels of market integration (e.g., [14,57,58]). Tsimane levels are\nsignificantly higher than typical values in the United States, even\nfor individuals reporting high levels of allergic symptoms (based on\nNHANES data, analysis not shown). In contrast, despite\ninhabiting a similar neotropical environment, Shuar display lower\nIgE, resembling other South Americans living in rural areas\n[12,13,59]. However, Shuar IgE was also significantly higher than\nNHANES values.\nAlthough many studies have reported elevated IgE levels in\npopulations infected with parasites such as helminths and malaria,\nvery few have carefully characterized the age-patterning of IgE,\nFigure 3.

The lower\nshows fits between slope parameters and geometric mean IgE by\npopulation. Note that the fit for B1 is linear with regard to log IgE, but is\nshown on the lower graph due to the parameter scale. Correlation\ncoefficients for all parameters are given in the text.\nEvidence for a Peak Shift in IgE\nand none that we are aware of has tested for a peak shift. A\nnumber of studies have noted that IgE is very low at birth, but\nHowever, most of these studies have been conducted in North\nAmerica or Europe, and most report that IgE is relatively stable\nafter age five or six without characterizing the degree of stability.\nOne of the few studies to report detailed age profiles found an\ninitial increase to age nine, a slight decrease, and then a second\nTable 3.

All age functions\nwere significant at p,0.001, except the age function for T. trichiura, which was non-significant.\nEvidence for a Peak Shift in IgE\npeak at age fifteen in Croatian children [61]. The shape of the\nincrease, with an initial peak and then a second peak, is\nremarkably similar to the age profiles seen in this study for the\nNHANES and Shuar sample. Our results suggest that IgE does\nreach an initial plateau between ages three and five, but continues\nto increase slowly before reaching higher peaks at age seventeen in\nthe U.S, age ten in the Shuar, and age seven in the Tsimane. It is\nimportant to note that although we report the peaks for simplicity,\nthe overall shape of the pattern is more important than the peak\nitself. This includes a faster rate of increase at an earlier age, an\nearlier peak, and an earlier decline to adult levels.\nThe age-patterns we report in this study are consistent with\nmathematical models for what is known as the peak shift [1,2,62].\nThe peak shift model predicts that immunity will develop earlier in\npopulations with higher exposure and transmission rates and\nsubsequently decline earlier as cohorts acquire partial immunity.\nThe peak shift hypothesis was formulated with regard to helminth\ninfections. Typically, helminth infections peak just before or\nduring adolescence [1,4,5,22]. Although data on helminth\ninfections was only available for one of our three populations,\nwe suggest that the IgE levels and peak ages reported in this study\nfor Shuar and Tsimane are likely the consequence of high\nhelminths loads since helminths are a primary cause of elevated\nIgE in rural populations. The IgE patterns reported also match\nexpectations from helminth infections. The lack of helminth data\nfor the NHANES participants may also not be much of a\nlimitation, as what studies exist support the assumption that\nhelminths among US residents are likely to be much less prevalent\nthan among either Shuar or Tsimane. There are few recent\nAmericans were infected with A. lumbricoides, 2.2 million with T.\ntrichiuris, 0.7 million with hookworm, and 0.4 million with S.\nstercoralis [63]. Given the US population in 1972, these are\nrevises Warren's estimate for S. stercoralis to a current estimate of\nwere positive for A. lumbricoides, 1.2% for T. trichiuris, 1.5% for\nhookworm, and 0.4% for S. stercoralis [65]. A similar study\nfound that 0.4% were positive for A. lumbricoides [66]. These\nestimates are clearly much lower than the prevalences we report\nfor Tsimane and the prevalences reported for other ethnic groups\nliving near the Shuar, enough so that the exact prevalence is not\ncritical for interpreting our findings.\nDue to TH\n2 biasing, total IgE may be a better index of total\nhelminth load than specific IgE levels. However, the lack of\nparasite-specific IgE in these data sets is also a limitation in that we\ncannot state how much parasite-specific IgE contributes to total\nlevels. It may be that Shuar and Tsimane differ less in the total\nhelminth prevalences than they do in prevalences of particular\nhelminth species. Using helminth infection data for the Tsimane\nwe were able to examine associations between helminth species\nand total IgE. We found that the overall age-pattern for IgE in the\nTsimane resembled the age-pattern for A. lumbricoides infection. A.\nlumbricoides infection was associated with higher IgE levels in\nThese data suggest that this species may contribute more to the\nage-pattern of IgE than others. Hookworm and Strongyloides\ninfection were also associated with higher IgE in the overall\nsample, but showed less age-pattern in association. Future studies\nwill need to investigate this in more detail by examining specific-\nIgE and extending into other populations.\nThe association between IgE and A. lumbricoides is consistent\nwith other studies showing that total IgE is correlated with specific\nIgE to A. lumbricoides [14]. The positive association between A.\nlumbricoides and IgE in participants under age ten and the negative\nassociation after age ten may also suggest that IgE conveys partial\nFigure 5.

Parameter significance: * p#0.05, ** p#0.01, *** p#0.001.\nEvidence for a Peak Shift in IgE\nimmunity to A. lumbricoides [67,68]. Other studies that [69] have\nfailed to find increased resistance with higher IgE may have not\ntaken this age-pattern into account.\nOther parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum, also raise total IgE\nlevels [70]. However, malaria is unlikely to be an important factor\nfor the populations studied in this paper. Although malaria is\npresent in parts of Shuar territory, it is not present in the villages\nwhere the data for this paper were collected, and very few\nindividuals in the area report having had it. Malaria also appears\nto be absent from the Tsimane territories, with no Tsimane\nreporting malaria in extensive health interviews.\nFinally, in all three populations IgE levels were higher in males.\nAlthough noted in many studies (e.g., [23]), the reason for this sex\ndifference is not entirely clear. The only significant sex difference\nin helminth infections was in A. lumbricoides, with slightly more\nwomen being infected. Due to the higher IgE in males, it is\ntempting to hypothesize that this is due to increased resistance in\nmales. However at present this is merely supposition. It is just as\nlikely that Tsimane women are infected more frequently because\nthey spend more time in direct contact with children, who\nthemselves have the greatest number of A. lumbricoides infections.\nIn addition to its importance for theoretical models describing\nthe epidemiology of infections, an understanding of the age\npatterning of IgE may have public health implications. In\npopulations with higher parasite transmission rates, exposure\ntriggers an elevation of IgE at earlier ages. More rapid and heavy\ninvestment in earlier immunocompetence may be favored with\nhigh exposure, even at the expense of other investments, such as\ngrowth. In Shuar children high IgE levels are associated with\nincreased stunting [18]. It seems plausible that insults to growth\nmay be most pronounced in populations in which peak infection\nrates occur during critical growth periods, such as early\nadolescence. Additionally, the timing of infection may affect the\ndevelopment of immune function in other ways, for example by\naffecting the TH\n2 balance, with consequences for the later\ndevelopment of allergy [71]. Although these hypotheses remain to\nbe tested, they suggest that interventions might be developed with\nthe specific goal of shifting infection peaks toward less critical ages.\n"
